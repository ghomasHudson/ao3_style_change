Once he’s back at home, John ignores the hints of a migraine burning his temples, takes out his laptop, and searches Molly Hooper's name. The first website that’s returned is the Time Magazine article that was mentioned in the photo caption at the library. It’s dated from two years ago.
Brook’s smile is bright against his olive skin, and premature crows feet settle at the corners of his heavily-lashed eyes. His sports coat and slacks are neatly pressed, hanging comfortably on his lean, muscular frame. His face is dusted with nearly two days of scruff, and thick waves of dark hair lay tastefully disheveled at the top of his head.
"Who was?"
Sherlock grumbles a bit, complains that shrinks are useless in this case, and he stands up to go make them tea.
So John leans back onto the pillow, and Sherlock fulfills his promise. Accompanied by a chorus of moans and sighs of pleasure, John’s body writhes and surges beneath him, and he tells Sherlock that he's fucking perfect—a perfect genius, and a perfect lover, and a perfect husband.
“I’ve, erm—” Sherlock swallows thickly; he’s so close that John feels his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat. “I’ve never done this with someone before.”
John’s on top of the world. He’s got William’s attention—not that he cares, of course—and he’s about to take a pretty girl home.
Gabriela ignores him, squinting at him suspiciously. “Are you booking The Woman on the website under your own name?”
This isn’t where John wants to be.
Sherlock sets a lingering kiss to the crown of John’s head. They hold on until they no longer can.
“When we arrived...” Gabriela explains, “...the door was cracked open and the lights were on. We thought that whoever was here may have picked up Sarah’s wallet, so we went in.”
John asks approximately four thousand more silly questions, and Sherlock still has to tell him the answer.
“True,” John says. “One never knows when they might need to capture a criminal for kissing purposes.”
He’s dressed quite strangely as well. I presume he doesn’t want anyone to recognise him while he removes my corpse from the premises. -SH
"Petting! It's...unusual!"
Sherlock glances over. Lestrade is standing before the hooded figure, engaged in a deep conversation.
She reaches towards the stereo. “Different music?”
“God help us,” John says.
As they pull from their embrace, Sarah’s eyes fall to something directly behind him. Her smile fades, and her eyes grow wide, leaving her expression somewhere between fascinated and unsettled.
John finally cracks an authentic smile. "For someone with no relationship experience, you're incredibly insightful."
“That’s where you’re incorrect.” Sherlock flicks away the second dandelion and adjusts his body so he’s facing John. “You believe that time is linear; that only the past can be remembered. But in fact, time and space move forwards and backwards and up and down and all sorts of ways. A memory can occur tomorrow, or yesterday, or six thousand years from now, or it can even be happening right this instant. It may be here, or in another universe, or in fifteen universes at once.”
John chuckles and turns to the next page of music. "I don't believe that. Do you?"
“Erm. Yeah.” He stops typing. “Why?”
Before John even comprehends what’s happening, Moriarty turns to run. He's unnaturally fast; quickly making it to the corner of the house and disappearing into the shadows.
John sighs heavily. "I know this is sudden, but...I need to get downtown before midnight. There’s someone I've got to see.”
John chuckles at William's adorably befuddled expression. “No, you idiot." He pulls William's head towards him. "I’ve just missed you. That’s all," he says, brushing their lips together.
“Mm. When’s the last time you ate?”
“You…erm, missed a spot,” John murmurs. “Here. Let me help you.” He brings his hand to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, using his thumb to wipe off the last bit of buttercream. He waits for Sherlock to end the moment somehow—by letting go of his hand, or moving away from his touch, or—anything.
"Good point.” John brushes his callused fingers over Sherlock's cheekbone. Down his jaw. “And probably this.” Down his neck. "And this." Across Sherlock's silk shirt, just over his clavicle.
Once the two of them are eventually dressed, John pulls himself into his bed, and Sherlock wedges in next to him. Since John's leg cast was removed a few days ago, they've been able to make it work—a tight fit with Sherlock's long, lanky legs—but he doesn’t seem to mind. No doubt it's a thousand times more comfortable than whatever hell he's been putting his spine through the past few weeks, sleeping somewhere in between a hospital chair and John bed.
Paralysed and suffocated by a blanket of grief, John collapses onto Sherlock’s body, and he weeps.
Gabriela and Sarah exchange apprehensive glances. “That’s what we wanted to show you. Follow us."
“Sherlock,” John continues softly. “Do you realise how much better my life is with you in it? I've never told you, really. But yeah. You...made me feel alive when I was nearly dead, you know? And you bring me joy every single day. Even on the days I want to wring your neck,” he laughs. “You...make me very happy, Sherlock, and I can’t quite imagine my life without you. I don't think I want to, actually."
“Mmm." John enthusiastically reaches into the drawer and takes out the tube. But before he begins anything new and exciting and possibly quite kinky, he simply places a kiss on Sherlock’s lips. “Will you turn over onto your stomach for me, Sherlock?”
“Yes.” Sherlock finds her reaction puzzling. Why would Molly Hooper be so profoundly happy about the two of them being in love? “Apparently it’s been the case for some time. Who could possibly have known?”
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, unable to meet his eyes. “Goodnight.”
When in doubt, however, he’s learned that kissing is the obvious solution—so he seals their mouths together.
“This was written two years ago,” John says, inhaling sharply through his nose. “I don’t give a fuck about what happened to Sherlock two years ago. I saw him just last week. Yeah. At Christmas. And I definitely wasn’t getting sucked off by a corpse. Not really my thing.”
"Oh. Could you pass me your laptop...please?"
"Blood aeonium," he whispers.  A succulent hybrid that he's had an affinity for since the first time he saw it. He's always wanted one for himself, but it's so rare that it only grows at one nursery in the world, and he's never been lucky enough to obtain one.
“What?”
"No. The other one," she says playfully.
John pats him on the back, passes over his card, and leaves him to fend for himself. “Yep. That’s the one. Cheers.”
It's not because he desperately longs for John. Or craves the king-sized warmth that emanates from his fun-sized body. He doesn't try to guess the temperature of John's skin. Doesn’t observe John's REM cycle patterns, or the twitching of his eyelids while he dreams. Doesn’t watch John’s chest rise and fall as he breathes twelve to fourteen times per minute.
"When a person washes with soap," John muses, staring intently at the ceiling. “...they get clean. But does the soap also get dirty?"
John presses his lips into a thin line. “You
Gabriela pushes a long, silky strand of hair behind her bare shoulder. “We ought to have you come over sometime,” she replies, her dark eyes glinting. “Perhaps you’ll be able to tell her yourself.”
He pauses; this must be the new place his classmates have been raving about. Apparently, they make fantastic drinks—and damned if he isn’t still yearning for that Old Fashioned.
He retrieves his phone from his pocket to send a message to Gabriela.
"Beg your pardon," Lestrade says, because he is the biggest idiot of all. "I'm still confused."
you." He slides his fingers over William's neck, over his cheeks, and through his curls. "So I’m going to kiss you now, and if you kiss me in return, that will speak more clearly to me than a hundred words.”
Sherlock swallows thickly. “And was it clear, as well, the manner in which I had my lips attached to your lips?”
The scent stings John’s throat before he tastes it, but he takes William by the wrist, wrapping his lips around his fingers and savoring the drink’s heat.

I've been putting the finishing touches on this chapter for a week now. If I don't publish it tonight, I'll probably turn into a pumpkin. So here it is. Sorry in advance for any typos! I'll fix them tomorrow, once I'm no longer in danger of becoming a giant gourd.
"John," Sherlock breathes. "John, John, John."
John gulps. “And I would kiss you like you were the most precious thing on Earth. And I would make sure you felt safe, and valued, and—and also, loved.”
No. He
“God, you're perfect," John says as he makes love to him, in a dozen different ways, in so many words.
"John," Sherlock whispers as his heart drops to his stomach.
"Of course." John gives Sherlock a reassuring smile, taking his hand hand into his. "Would not want that."
"Sherlock."
Sherlock.
"No. I trust both of them implicitly." Sherlock releases the embrace, leaning back to gaze at John, and he notes the sad expression from earlier has returned. He decides he doesn't like it one bit, and then decides he's going to kiss it away. So he shifts forwards, bringing their bodies closer.
John continues to stare at him quizzically.
John chuckles softly, and they stare at each other for far too long. Sherlock becomes dizzy, and he forgets so many words—until he remembers the most important one.
“Yes, of course.”
She’s probably not.
Molly halts what she’s doing and peeks up at him quizzically through her goggles. “Does he typically sleep in your bed?”
"Good." Sherlock smiles sinfully at him before returning to their kiss; desperate and open mouthed and depraved.
It’s Sherlock—it always is, he supposes—memories of Sherlock flashing before him with perfect clarity. Every moment they’ve shared since the first, when Sherlock seemed to know more about John’s life than John did. There are memories of the small things, too (which don’t seem so small right now). The way Sherlock’s coat rustles in the breeze while his long legs carry him down the alleyway. The way his brow furrows whenever he’s confused or displeased. The crows feet around his eyes, and how they deepen when John causes him to laugh until he can hardly breathe.
"Then, I would take you into my hands," Sherlock murmurs, his confidence surging with his desire. "...and I would use my hands to slowly take you apart. And I would use my mouth to pleasure you more deeply than you've ever been pleasured before. And I would bring you to orgasm so explosively that you would forget to breathe, and your heart monitor would think that you've flatlined."
“Look!” Mrs. Hudson shrieks, pointing to the planchette. “It’s moving!”
"A-ha! I knew it!" Molly grins and drops her scalpel into her tray. Remaining seated in her wheeled office chair, she rolls towards him. "Tell me more!”
that night, anyway?” John asks her, referring to the night of Stamford's birthday. Now that he understands Mary's relationship to Sherlock, it makes even less sense. “Were you actually angry?”
“Oh. Pity.” William pushes past him, pressing his hipbones into his side as he sets the cake onto the table. “Off to meet your girlfriend, then?”
I didn’t want to die. I died because I had to.
"With my one good hand."
“Me.” He extends his index finger towards John’s chest. “You.” He nods. “Sex. That is the solution."
"You've got some very good ideas," Sherlock reassures him.
Before, he felt that he already knew what he needed to know about Sherlock. But there's an empathy that comes only from learning the truth of his past; and he aches, knowing all he’s endured. Taking the fall for a murderer—his former mentor, a man he admired for years. Faking his own death, giving up his entire life, leaving the people he loved behind. Starting over in an unfamiliar place, never knowing if or when it would all come to a grinding halt. Falling in love, despite knowing that it would have to end. Trying all he could do to keep John at a distance, but failing, only to have his worst fears become reality.
That evening, Sherlock arrives at half seven. He apologises for being late, citing an errand he had to run, but he doesn't expand upon that.
will regret it.”
Sherlock grazes his thumb over the tip and brushes his lips against John's ear. "Now that I've given you all of me," he breathes, "What comes next, John?"
Once the noises of pleasure die down, John tries with all his might to hide his raging hardness.

bond becomes stronger.
I promise love confessions and smut in the next (and final! Really!) chapter.
Hello from the other side of the most brutal writer’s block I’ve experienced in my 4 years as a writer! I made it out aliiiiive
John pulls away from the comfort of Sherlock’s shoulder to take a look at his face. He can’t help but smile; a confident Sherlock is sexy as hell, but a flustered Sherlock is impossibly endearing. "You thought, perhaps...?"
"Sherlock, I—“
“That’s wonderful news,” he says, if only reciting the words.
(John swears a lot when he comes. Sherlock already knows this, because the walls in their flat are thin. And today, he's saying some of the filthiest things Sherlock has ever heard come out of his mouth, and it’s fantastic.)
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” John teases. “My mouth will go nowhere near yours until we have a thorough discussion.”
“Yes. How’s that going?” he asks.
Perhaps John is happy to be here, Sherlock thinks. Alone. With him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Anyhow, now that we've got that cleared up—" He looks back to Lestrade, who has his phone to his ear and appears to be engaged in a conversation.
Sherlock hums happily, eyes falling back to John’s lips. “Thank you for the beautiful gift, by the way. It was worth the wait.”
"Wait." John feels like a bit of an idiot. "You never told me that."
When he finally pulls away, John grins up at him, eyelids heavy, and it's Sherlock who can't produce words.
Sherlock removes his phone from John’s view. “Does that somehow affect his ability to kiss?”
“Ask her about what?” Sherlock doesn’t look up from the bowels in his hands.
John freezes mid-sentence, bewildered by the interjection. "I hadn't really considered that you'd be into that, but—"
mouth.”
"Then I can only assume your hesitance is out of concern for me. But please don’t be afraid; I'm not as breakable as you think.”
“Don’t forget why we’re here, Gab,” he says gently. “First work. Then play.”
“Right.”
“I suppose you’re right. Thank you, Molly.”
That’s when he understands Mary's willingness. Why she would reach beyond her duties to help Sherlock and himself. He nods again. “Alright.”
John shrugs. “Lucky you.”
“And the same goes for the backup pistol she left in the limo." He pulls a second gun from his coat pocket. "Though I'm sure she didn't think I'd use that single bullet to kill her." Carelessly, he tosses both guns to either side. John knows they're both likely empty, but he throws his body protectively over Sherlock’s, and in doing so, knocks him over as well.
“John?”
to say no. So I told myself that it was simple, uncomplicated. No meeting beyond these walls, but most importantly: no sentimental attachments.”
"You’ll be alright." John leans forwards, slowly bringing his lips to his.
“John,” he whispers.
“Tea!” He pulls himself from John’s wicked grasp, shaking off his own apparent hysteria, and darts towards the kitchen.
“You’re welcome. But there is a final one I must show you; one you already know well.” He holds his hands out once more.
Sherlock separates his middle and ring fingers, peeking out from between them. “Is that what you’d want?”
Why must it be so difficult to tell Sherlock how he feels? He's certain it's not a secret any longer. Not after the googly eyes and the squished together body parts. Not after the spike in his resting pulse rate and the mass exodus of his vocabulary.
What a question. What a question that’s completely normal to ask, but that John and Sherlock have not planned for at all.
But when he involuntary shifts his hand on her back a miniscule amount, she wraps her fingers tightly around his upper arm. It happens so quickly that he doesn’t notice she’s even moved until he feels the searing pain of her nails digging into his skin.
Though it isn’t John’s time to die, not yet—even now, his “life review” would be pretty impressive. He’s cured people. He’s saved people. He’s seen murder and war and peace. He’s seen much of the world, and he’s seen things much of the world wouldn’t believe.
“I can’t accept an apology for that, Sherlock. You did nothing wrong.”
had sex before."
"What do you mean?"
"Yes. If you were my husband."
He places a hand on Gabriela's hip, taking his cock into the other one.
"Geese are aggressive bastards!" Sherlock whines. “They've got serrated tongues! People have died, John!"
shares his bed with John because
"We’re in loooooove,” Gabriela interrupts, slipping her hand further between Sarah’s legs.
Before John can even make it past the threshold of his hotel room, he’s got an armful of tiny redhead wrapped around him.
"Are you
The night is crisp with mid-Autumn air, a steady breeze rustling Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock lives only a short walk from campus, and Brook often accompanies him when it’s late. In between, the walk is mostly silent, though Sherlock’s brain stirs excitedly over the workings of their case.
John takes another drink. Yeah, he’ll be going home alone tonight.
"Tell me something about yourself that I don't already know," he blurts.
And if he and John can fool the world into thinking they’re in love, they can fool the world into thinking they’re not.
“Sorry,” she mumbles, yawning once more. “It suddenly hit me how sleepy I am.”
John finally sits next to Sherlock, his body quite obviously tense.
"Bit too close there, love," John whispers. And his lips are on Sherlock's neck, his cheek, his jaw, his temple; they are kissing him everywhere they can possibly reach.
Though it’s dark, he notes that Brook’s expression conveys a similarly emotional state—a rare combination of pride and awe.

"Shut up. You're the one who’s got grey hair."
This is how he finds himself at the bar’s entryway door, and this is how he meets Molly Hooper. And this is how he learns that she’s in love with William.
There’s a knock at the door. John’s voice. “Sherlock?”
Gabriela laughs. "I mean, we don't go crazy. But as long as we're open about it, we trust one another. And at the end of the day..." she takes Sarah's hand. "She's the one."
"Do not compare yourself to John. He is a hundred—a thousand times more human than you are, and I will always choose him over anyone and anything, including my own life."
“I suppose so,” Sherlock says distantly.
"No. Although it could be partnered with certain herbs.”
And yet, two minutes later, they’re all gathered in a circle on the floor holding hands. Donovan says that she’s excited because this reminds her of Halloweens with her grandmother. Anderson says he’s excited because this reminds him of a pornographic film he once watched. Most of the others are fairly certain they’ve seen the same film.
He continues to apply the perfect amount of pressure to Sherlock's biceps, making his way over his shoulders and down his arms bit by bit. Sherlock's eyes drift closed as his surroundings and the knots in his body melt away. John massages his upper back and over his spine, in deliberate, unhurried strokes, and Sherlock releases a rattling sigh; all that's left is the feeling of John’s hands on him and John’s legs around him.
Love.
John. In mere weeks, you have given me enough happiness to last an entire lifetime. Every kiss from you was worth at least a thousand more. I will never forget you.
Irene returns, wearing the same dress she arrived in, and the three women make towards the door. As Irene passes John, she pauses, leaning in to kiss him on the cheek. “Take care, darling,” she says. “See you soon.”
“Goodnight, Gabriela,” he replies, but she’s already out like a light.
Sherlock drags his lips downwards along John's abdomen as he lowers himself to the floor. Spreads John's legs apart and wedges himself between them. Kisses the peak of John's right hip bone, manuevers his tongue over, trails it inwards across John's lower pelvis to the other hip. Glides his lips and tongue down his inner thigh and then back upwards, pausing to lick circles at his pubic bone.
John’s chest stirs, his nerve driving him forward yet one more step. “And so have I.”
“I’m happy to help." The driver turns the steering wheel, pulling the limousine out into the street. “Sherlock’s one of my closest friends. He misses you terribly, you know.”
Here, in this room, perhaps they’ve found a way to love without consequence. A way to love without pain.
“The raw chemistry, the passion we have—it’s unprecedented. I have never experienced anything like it. I believe we both dove into this headfirst, deliberately not thinking of the consequences. Perhaps we were convinced there wouldn't be any. But that’s no longer the case.” His lips form into a thin line, and his head falls. “I broke my own rule. And for that, I deeply apologise.”
Sherlock centers himself, sighing into John’s warm mouth as he nibbles at Sherlock’s bottom lip. He sweeps his tongue over it, and nibbles again, knotting his fingers through Sherlock’s curls and pressing his head in to deepen the kiss. Sherlock's mouth falls open, and he  wraps his long arms around John’s waist and inhales, and he's drowning in sensations: he’s tasting John and smelling him and holding him and loving him all at once.
“J-John…” he chokes, as if he’s swallowing back fear. He’s terrified, John realises.
The unanticipated move causes an immediate wave of excitement to wash over Sherlock’s body. He squirms beneath John as the tips of John’s lips brush against his jaw. “Yes, John?”
Sherlock breathes steadily. In, out, in. Completely still.
For a few seconds, John is rendered speechless, and all he can do is smile at him tenderly. “I love you, Sherlock,” he finally says. “I know my words aren’t as…poetic as yours. But they’re the words I came here to say, and I just want to be sure that you hear them.”
He watches as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson fall to their deaths, amidst stifled sobs and hushed words—still clinging tightly to one another.
It's a good thing John's lips are suctioned to Sherlock's neck, because Sherlock is so startled that he nearly leaps up from the table and launches the smaller man towards the source of the voice.
"And you could maybe...stop doing that?”
“Alright.” The man draws playful circles with his thumb near John’s pulse point. “Then I will simply inform you that you’re in the best seat at the bar, having ordered nothing. And the longer you sit here without ordering, the more of my time you waste. So if you could order immediately, it would be quite convenient. Otherwise, I must request you take your little peep show elsewhere.” He exhales a final breath on John’s neck before pushing himself away.
Sherlock leans back in his chair. His cheeks are bright red. He fidgets a bit more.
The Strand, closed, with no explanation. The blood-red letters "IOU" splattered onto the door. William's disappearance. Molly's photograph on the wall, and the mysterious, flickering message: GET SHERLOCK.
Love you guys so much. Thank you for reading, and take care of yourselves 😘
"Fair point, I suppose."
“No.” Sherlock still refuses to break eye contact or pull away. “You should leave.”
But as much as he loves these two women deeply—and would do anything for them—the bond he shares with John is different. Molly and Mrs. Hudson are his friends. They're his family. John is his friend, and John is his family, and his home. And his comfort and his peace, and his conductor of light, among so many other things, countless and nameless.
that we're together?"
"What the fuck indeed," Sherlock repeats in a deep, booming voice, echoing John's adorable swear.
When John arrives, the sky is pitch black and covered in clouds. The frigid wind even pierces through his winter coat. But it doesn't compare to the chill that runs through him as he approaches The Strand. Perhaps it was the crowds and the New Years energy the night before, but tonight, the building looks different. It looks utterly abandoned and empty, as though it belongs in a ghost town.
The two of them
He doesn’t want to.
It isn’t as though either of them can easily run off; they’re stuck here, stuck to endure the result of any embarrassing situation that may arise.
So he lets Sherlock kiss him, slow and lazy. Lets him brush his tongue against his as John brushes his fingers through the curls at the nape of his neck. (They're his second favourite group of curls, after the errant ones, of course, which he tucks away for Sherlock as often as he can).
“You continue to surprise me, John,” he says quietly.
Finally, he takes a deep breath, and he opens it.
"They're molecules!" She dashes over with excitement, tripping on her cape while doing so. "...I think."
Sherlock doesn’t really know when it became Christmas. The days blend together when there’s nobody around to yell at you to go to bed, that you have to sleep because you’re actually human (sometimes) and your body needs it. But lo and behold, the clock strikes across the street at the cathedral, one two three, four five six, seven eight nine, ten eleven twelve.
"And! Also!” Sherlock states, “I didn't call out
"Tell me."
John tilts his head up and puts his lips on Sherlock's, and he tells Sherlock that he loves him.
He still wears his wedding ring.
“Yeah,” Molly nods. “We know. Gabriela filled us in on all of that.”
He flinches at the sound of John's voice—feeling guilty, as though John might read his thoughts.
John says nothing. But when she opens her arms to offer an embrace, he pulls her in immediately. They stand there, silent, until the crowd begins to die down.
Donovan regards Sherlock and John with her typical Look of Disdain, appearing not to notice that the two of them are practically frotting atop a flimsy table.
"Alright."
"John,” Sherlock argues. “Really, it's not a problem. It happens all the time.”
"You are?" Sherlock's voice jumps a half register. He draws a breath. "Of course you are. I mean, being married to me is—"
not know you are both of those things.
“Were you planning on ordering, or did you choose to sit here because it makes your voyeurism more convenient?”
“Yes, she’s here. It’s fine. She already knows all of the important details, such as your status ‘down there.’”
Sylvia?”
a dream.
"Which will lead you to William!" Gabriela concludes happily.
"Hey, Sherlock."
He doesn’t know how long he works at Sherlock’s upper body, trying to remove his clothes—
Sherlock gives him a grateful look of relief before shoving both hands into his pockets, spinning on his heels, and exiting the room.
Molly's eyes are sympathetic. "And have you talked to him about the things that happened to you before? Explained why you're hesitant?"
Sarah bursts into laughter. “I mean, technically, I fell on my head, so that’s only partially true. Anyway, Gabriela took me to the ER, stayed with me, and took me home the next morning. She put me to bed, and I woke up in her arms, and I haven’t really left her side since.”
her, only during the part where you tell her, you
Sherlock wants to tell John that where he is at the moment, lying next to him—it feels even more home than home. Instead, he simply says: "Yes."
The two of them have been awake for all of three minutes - and yet, Sherlock is flushed and breathless by the hurried nature of their lovemaking. The speed at which things are accelerating is quite gratifying at the moment, of course; yet unusual. Their morning kissing sessions are mostly unhurried, and often more sensual than sexual. But right now, John glides his fingers over the curves of Sherlock's lower back, his lips pressing against his neck with enough pressure to bruise--and Sherlock is hungry for more.
Sherlock crooks an eyebrow, nods slowly, and mouths a very subtle and very sarcastic “
He and John never speak of this again. They don’t need to; they’ve said goodbye far too much in this particular lifetime.
It contained useless descriptions such as “you see a future together,” blah blah blah, “united passions, sees you for who you truly are.” Drivel drivel drivel, “makes you laugh, you could spend hours doing nothing with them and have a wonderful time.” Et cetera, et cetera, “their happiness is essential to your own, and it feels as though they are the best person in the world.”
"Sherlock,” John whispers. Oh, it’s good to see him. Though Mycroft’s words hover over John like summer rain clouds, the heaviness in his chest lifts instantly.
"Got a bit of dust there," he says.
He finally allows his touch to roam downwards, fingers trickling back and forth over John's shoulders. "What would you have me do?" he murmurs, sliding his thumb over John's collarbones. "If I were your husband."
"What time does the show begin?" he asks.
John’s got questions, but the desire to consume William overtakes him completely. He thrusts his tongue into him, thrashes and sucks and licks until William's arsehole is wet and pink and throbbing, but he doesn’t stop to come up for air—he doesn’t need to. This is only a dream, after all, and breathing is boring.
"I—” John begins. But the words dissolve on his tongue.
"John's in there," Sherlock rebuts. He takes a step backwards, imagining a conversation about the weather forecast, and how he will quickly need to "go" to "sleep".
“So,” John says. “Our first big holiday together is practically in the books. How are you feeling about that?”
Dim light. Blue walls and floors, spotted with blue squares like a Monet. The overpowering scent of chlorine and water.
Sherlock's brain nearly shuts off entirely. But he distantly remembers learning that there are more than four thousand nerve endings where the two of them are currently touching--and at the moment, every last one is lit with a pleasure brighter than a pure white flame.
“She’s simply shy. Perhaps she’s intimidated by your…”
"So...?" Sherlock whispers back. "Am I to presume that Donovan and Anderson decided to dress up as people with actual personalities for Halloween?"
When he lifts his gaze to Sherlock, Sherlock is looking back at him. His expression is somewhat forlorn—but very much needy and desperate.
John’s heart flutters.“Oh,” is all he says. “Yeah, ha. Of course.”
Mycroft simply ignores them, continuing to glare out the car window.
John laughs quietly. "Attorney. Funny."
Also, it’s adorable that he’s small but fierce and brave and a bit scrappy, sort of like a Pomeranian
"No need to thank me." Holding Sherlock closer, John closes his eyes and presses their cheeks together. Sherlock's skin is as smooth as ivory, and he smells like merlot and the rain.
“Tonight will be different.” John lowers Sherlock so his legs are around his waist. “As will every night hereafter.” He firmly kisses Sherlock on the mouth. “I hope you’re okay with that.”
Is it “I love you” or is it “I want you,” and does the meaning hold true for a lifetime, or only for a night? Does a kiss mean love, or is it more? Does a kiss mean love, or is it less?
Sherlock purses his lips together. Frankly, he doesn’t even care to enjoy John’s heavenly John-scent anymore, so he pushes himself away.
"He's got chapped lips. Callused hands. Unique tan lines. Highly developed muscles in one forearm due to years of repetitive wrist movements." Sherlock encloses his fingers and slides his hand upwards and downwards in a demonstrative motion.
And here’s a chapter that’s twice as long than the other ones, which I wrote in two days, cuz, that’s how it goes I guess 😘 ❤️ 🥰
Sherlock crooks one eyebrow before he continues, taking a step forwards between John's legs. When he crouches down, the errant curl trickles out over his forehead.
How is it that Sherlock Holmes, who knows an awful lot, has never known something as simple as a kiss?
“Where exactly do you need to go?” Sarah asks.
John climbs over him, placing his hands and legs on either side of Sherlock’s body. “Can I undress you, too? Or are you required to kick me somewhere first?"
And that's the story of how Sherlock and John become fake married.
“Bye, freak,” Donovan calls out to Sherlock. “Bye, freak’s boyfriend.”
“Doctor Brook? Good afternoon. I’m Sherlock Holmes, your new teaching assistant.”
But every bit as quickly as it begins, it ends.
John sighs with frustration—again, frustration. It’s the only identifiable, quantifiable emotion that William seems to evoke in him.
His touch is so electric that Sherlock nearly falls off the sofa. "Mmm?"
I died because I knew who Moriarty was.
John is kissing Sherlock, and he's not quite certain of how they got here, and he's even less certain of whether they ought to be. And this is likely a terrible idea, he thinks, but sometimes the worst ideas are also the best ones.
William moves his lithe, long body in luxurious waves against him, his tongue and his humid, uneven breath in his ear. He licks at John's jaw and neck, slides his lips over John's skin until their mouths finally come crashing back together.
They solve the murder in less than forty-five minutes, and on their way back, John takes Sherlock into an alleyway to kiss him until the stars come out. Days later, with the sound of fireworks and Auld Lang Syne fading into the background, he kisses Sherlock at midnight.
Sherlock smiles. “More than okay.”
Sarah sighs. “Oh my god, Gab. There’s a time and a place, and this is not—“
courageous, but there's got to be something that makes you shiver a bit."
"I suppose that's one way of putting it." John laughs, taking Sherlock's hand into his, a gesture that causes Sherlock's heart to become briefly tachycardic. "God, I can’t wait until we’re home to kiss you again. I saw a stage prop storage room on the way in. Looked empty."
"Oh, shit. Oh, god." John's face, already overheating from the temperature and the passion, positively catches on fire. He takes a step away from Sherlock, and another, and another. "I'm so sorry, Sherlock. I shouldn't have done that."
John presses a delicate kiss to Sherlock's collar bone. "I'm here. You didn’t lose me. And you won't lose me. I promise."
Sherlock rests his head in his hands. "Who else?"
"Oh." He closes the book. "Sorry. Can't promise that."
John nods and smiles, and Sherlock walks towards the door, puts his coat on silently, and reaches out towards the door handle.
"It was
“How much time do you have?” he asks.
at his curls—and oh, Sherlock likes that quite a lot.
The words, in any succession, feel like an error.
Leaving it all behind. Baker Street, 221B. Not actually leaving it all behind.
Gabriela raises it, wrapping it around Sarah, and Sarah slides her hand in between her legs. She rubs vigorously at Gabriela’s clit over the crotch of her lace underwear until it becomes soaked with her arousal. Then, she glides her fingers underneath, sliding them in and out of her wetness.
"Buttercream filling?" Sherlock takes yet another step closer.
Received ✓
"Fucking hell." John's voice is raw from emotion. "You've gone and left me speechless again."
“Did you continue to see him after that?” he asks.
With a rattling sigh, Sherlock lays his sweat-drenched head on John’s chest, crying out earnestly with each thrust.
“The queen has arrived,” he says.
As he smiles and nods along, his aimless gaze inevitably hones in on Sherlock’s beautiful lips. Oh, those lips. They will be the death of him. Those criminal, savage, murderous lips. They ought to be locked up, really. By John's lips, perhaps.
Once Sherlock and John return to their flat, they remove their costumes and carry out their bedtime routine; it all happens much more silently than Sherlock would like.
"Covalent bonding," Sherlock corrects him. "But yes, I believe so."
It’s whatever-o’clock, and everyone (except for Death, probably) feels fantastic—due to good company and Mrs. Hudson’s Famous Fun Brownies. Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and Donovan are chatting at the dining room table with a bottle of wine; Anderson and Lestrade are in the kitchen debating the existence of the Illuminati. John and Sherlock are still on the floor, but at some point, they seem to have traded places; it’s now Sherlock who lies in John’s lap as John strokes his curly locks of hair.
Sherlock walks into the flat at half eleven. His bedroom door is open and the light is still on.
Sherlock appears too exhausted to argue. He takes John lightly by the arm, guiding him to the vehicle—but Mycroft holds up a stiff hand to stop him.
“Mm,” Sherlock mumbles.
With John's words, Sherlock's heart feels bigger than his sternum. He isn't exactly sure at which point his arms become fully wrapped around John's body, John's head buried in his chest. He also isn't sure when he begins to place delicate kisses on top of his head, or when he became the type of person to comfort another. There is no limit to the odd things his love for John causes him to do.
He returns to his book, desperately attempting to retain any of the knowledge he’s taking in. But everything useful is immediately replaced with memories of the scent of William’s shampoo. The way his fingers felt against his skin when they brushed over his cheek. The sounds he made when he breathed John’s name against his neck as he arched his body into his.
John knows he and Sherlock aren't a couple, of course. But sometimes, over the candle's flame, he imagines that they are. When Sherlock looks at him that way—what choice has he got?
“Molly, no,” Irene protests.
William tilts his head upwards. His eyes are wet with tears, and he clears his throat as if he may choke on the words. “I’m afraid I have fallen quite deeply in love with you.”
John's breath hitches. "What are you—?”
“Yes.”
John groans with embarrassment. “Thank you. I suppose I gave you a good opportunity to pay it forward.”
As she falls back onto her pillow and shuts off the light, John's chest swells with affection for her. Her open, loving heart; the innocence she possesses, regardless of her intelligence, strength, and wit. The way people seem drawn to her like magnets, and yet she doesn’t bat them away, as other beautiful women might do; instead, making an equal place for each of them.
John quickly collects himself, letting go of William’s collar. “Doesn’t matter. Just...look, this isn’t about me, alright? It’s my friend’s birthday, and I’d like to buy him a drink or two. So could you just get over this...whatever it is...and make a bloody Crown and Coke? And an Old Fashioned for me, if it’s not terribly inconvenient of me to ask that you do your job?”
John’s head and heart and limbs and every organ in his body work in unison, begging him to say the words. Sherlock watches him, as well—expression gentle and fierce at once. He's got a way of doing that; of peering through your skin and bones and seeing right into your soul.
Up next: A mysterious person by the name of “Greg” appears at the door. A surreptitious hooded figure sips Pilsner in the corner.
“Ah,” John acknowledges. Then, he turns his attention back to Mary, still hoping to offer her comfort, but she refuses to meet his eyes.
"Fantastic?" Sherlock offers.
John feels an unbidden heat climbing up his neck.  “I—I don’t know.” Suddenly, he feels timid. “Would you like to tell me?”
John shakes his head vigorously to pull himself back to reality. "Yes?”
"John.”
“Oi.” John punches the proton back. ”Sherlock, perhaps we ought to put away the costumes for a bit?”
John undoes the first two buttons of Sherlock's collar. He kisses his clavicle and shoulders; he slides his tongue over the pulse point on his neck. He nibbles at his jaw and at his earlobe, murmuring words of affection.
"Ah." The medic smiles, suddenly pleasant. "Hop in."
The landing, and Molly Hooper. And Molly’s bungee cord, and Molly’s net, and the harness that Molly engineered. A harness that’s small enough to be hidden beneath one layer of clothing, yet strong enough to hold two men dropping from the second highest building in the Western Hemisphere.
Mary awaits them at the top of the driveway; John and Sherlock walk over to meet her. Somewhat unexpectedly, Sherlock sets a hand on her shoulder and kisses her cheek. “Thank you for doing this,” he says.
“...Told her what?!” John asks. “It’s not fair to leave us hanging!”
"No."
"Goodnight, Sherlock." John reaches to the foot of the bed, recovering the elements he threw off in his earlier bout of rage. "I'm going to have nightmares about my fingers being crushed. Thanks for that."
His generosity
He pauses again, as if waiting for Sherlock to protest.
many other ways to spend the next few minutes that don’t involve your brother.” He kisses Sherlock’s shoulder.
John spits out his tea. The distance it spews from his mouth is actually quite impressive; a droplet even lands on the arm of Sherlock’s chair.
For a short time, Mary stares down at her hands on her knees, saying nothing. John wonders if she’s already regretting her decision. But she finally turns to him, her eyes apprehensive.
John’s mind is blank as he tries to process what’s happening. “Yeah, good. You? Is Sherlock with you?”
“Of course we didn’t.” Irene says over her shoulder. “It’s our job to
Sherlock brushes a quick, barely-there kiss onto John’s temple. “Please. John, can you do this for me?”
But the time will soon come when they will be allowed to enter the world anew; and it will be as beautiful as if they were seeing it for the first time.
Sherlock regards him silently for a moment before leaning in and whispering against the shell of his ear.
"Indeed." Sherlock pushes a few wet curls back from his forehead, his gaze luminous, even in the darkness. He shivers, and John notices that he's still standing partially in the rain.
“You left this at the table.” A hand rests lightly on John’s shoulder.
Gabriela lifts her arms and laces her fingers together behind her head, giving Sarah free reign of her body. She takes note, massaging her chest through her shirt, flicking and squeezing and twisting her nipples until they grow visibly hard.
John releases a breath that’s somewhere between a laugh and a gasp. “What do you mean?”
"Yeah, Sherlock?"
He nods. “I know.”
Sherlock would have to be mad to do so.
They both breathe heavily. This is a line they've never crossed—but they've come too far, now. Sherlock needs to know what's on the other side.
Sherlock sighs in response. It sounds like a happy sigh.
He runs his fingers over the cool, rich, blood-red rosettes, clustered over yellow star shapes; it's even more beautiful than he remembers. Even in its plain glass vase, it's breathtaking.
"Yes, of course."
“I suppose I deserved that,” John says as his laughter fades, and Sherlock does not disagree with him. In fact, Sherlock does not do anything. Because John looks up at him, his hair tousled from the fall, and it’s quite distracting. And as they lock eyes, it begins to feel like a fragile moment Sherlock doesn’t want to break. Here, lying on the kitchen floor with John—amongst the dust and the likely remnants of body parts—is something completely new to him, and yet it feels wholly familiar.
The sofa creaks beneath them as though it may break, but that’s of no concern to them at the moment.
“We can get a message to them, letting them know you’re alright,” Lestrade says. “But we won’t be able to tell her of your situation or whereabouts.”
He wonders if Sherlock loved him, too, that night; pressing him against the wall and claiming him as his own, crushing their lips together until they were bruised.
Sherlock sighs dramatically. “If you hope to earn my forgiveness, John, you’ll need to remove your clothes.”
"And earlier!" Sherlock moves to the edge of his seat, giving his friend a sidelong glance. "You complimented me. What is it that you said? I can't seem to recall…"
"What? Why on earth are you calling me? Go back to your date!"
John unfolds his arms and sets his hands onto his own hips, dragging his tongue over his bottom lip. “Have I ever mentioned you’re kind of adorable when you’re angry?”
John doesn’t break his gaze, even though it burns him. “It’s like you said earlier. I suppose I just needed a drink.”
Elizabeth Stride. Elena Sharpe.
One thing he hopes goes uncatalogued, however, is the sudden sound of Mrs. Hudson’s door swinging open—and the resounding sigh of relief that follows.
“So you’re...going to Vegas?”
“John,” he says with a deep sigh of resignation. “You have to go."
“Good.” He lifts her hand to his mouth to kiss the back of her palm, and she hums with happiness. “I’ll visit the loo and then order an Uber for us.”
Sherlock's eyes fall to the same spot, and it seems as much of a surprise to him as it does John. He pulls his hand away quickly and mumbles an apology.
"Not really. Three hundred pounds a bottle, perhaps."
He’s got Stamford, of course—and he's thankful to be here, with him and his girlfriend, at 9 pm on Christmas Eve, inside Random Club #347—but there’s only so much third-wheeling one can do. So he drinks, and his gaze falls to the happy couple, and he wonders why he's feeling anything for them other than happiness.
the most. I hope that’s alright.”
The final bit he remembers from the Cosmonaut magazine: “...love is friendship set fire.” Fire? Is that, perhaps, what he felt in his gut when John touched him? A figurative flame, and not simply mild indigestion?
“I’ll find a way to make it up to you.” John grins, pressing his hips forward into Sherlock’s, proof of his already burgeoning hardness. “Now. I was told you were going to take me to bed.”
"Macarons?" With a sudden keen interest, Sherlock cranes his neck, seeming not to notice his computer sliding off his lap. "What kind of macarons?"
? Move! I need to make tea!”
(See the end of the chapter for
John gulps. “Good.”
"No. You're afraid of—" John pauses. It appears he's attempting to subdue a wave of laughter; he fails this attempt. "—geese."
Moriarty laughs a low, unpleasant laugh. “This is Mary's gun. And Mary is—was—a creature of habit. She was extremely sure of her own skill; and she never put more than a single bullet in her gun.” To prove himself, he pulls the barrel out and turns the gun upside down. It's empty.
John opens his mouth to speak.
"John hit his head," Sherlock offers.
“I can’t believe this is happening,” John remarks quietly as he removes Sherlock's final piece of clothing.
John breaches him with the tip of his cock. He utters more filthy words beneath his breath as he takes hold of Sherlock’s hips and guides him down, inch by tortuous inch.
“Sherlock,” John exhales. “Is this real?”
Mary laughs again, and John can’t help but join her: the two of them, reminiscing over the events of that evening as though they were old friends—it’s nice, he thinks. It feels good to have some distraction from what lies ahead of them; the anxiety that gnaws at his stomach.
“I seriously don’t care, dude.” She shrugs. “Let's stay for some cake. It won’t hurt.”
After about five minutes of William blatantly ignoring him, he finally gives into his vexation. “Oi!” He calls out. “I’ve been waiting for—”
“Oh. No. William, I didn’t mean…” His hands fall lightly to William’s shoulders. “I just meant that, as long as we continue...whatever this is, I want to be sure it’s exciting for you."
that I cannot seem to solve anything of importance.”
“Yes?” John asks.
“Good." Sarah bends down to collect her clothing from the floor.
A grin overcomes John’s face. “I know." And he turns to leave.
"Yeah?"
“Bart’s? For a case?” It suddenly occurs to John how much he misses going on cases, but he makes every attempt not to convey his burst of melancholy.
Molly rolls her eyes. “Of course not! It’s time for us to do the seance!” she explains, as if it’s obvious knowledge—though it was more likely plotted sometime in the past few minutes over a bottle of wine.
He turns to go, awaiting a goodbye that doesn’t come.
He gratefully accepts, wrapping himself up and downing half the glass in one gulp. “What time is it?” he asks.
“I don’t believe you’ve told me your name, officer,” John says, moving forwards.
Sherlock laughs. “I do enjoy bartending. But I suppose my passion is helping people. We’re alike in that regard. Whereas you heal their bodies, I heal their hearts.”
Sherlock finally flashes the tiniest grin. “Isn’t it? Kissing may lead to feelings of sentimental attachment, which are quite a threat to one’s sanity.”
Sender: Mike Stamford
"Sherlock," John sighs happily.
“Gabriela remains with her family for the time being. Sarah has been made aware of the situation, minus some of the specifics—so have Mike Stamford and his partner, Elizabeth."
The planchette stops moving again.
Sherlock smiles against the pillow. "John?"
“What the hell happened?” he asks hoarsely, his head throbbing as he becomes settled within his surroundings. "You—" he points a shaky finger at Moriarty. "You shot yourself! I watched you hold the gun to your own ribs and pull the trigger!"
He bends forwards to kiss John on the mouth. "The before times were terrible. And I understand why you might be afraid to face those feelings. But I was in the same place you were back then, and I am in the same place you are now. This time, however, we're in the same place at the same time. And anywhere we go, we go together."
John allows himself a few more seconds to admire Sherlock's beauty. He then turns over, shuts off the bedside lamp, and settles in for sleep.
He wavers between the desire to immerse himself into John deeply and swiftly; or to gently sink into his cherished body. He does his best to alternate between the two, and his skin buzzes from a spark deep in his waist that explodes outwards like a firework, sprawls out like a budding rose, and in the deafening silence and blind darkness he could swear he’s seeing stars.
“Mrs. Hudson says she’s sorry as well.” Sally waits another moment. “Do you have more things you’d like to say?”
Sherlock grins. "Are you ready?"
Suddenly, the lights in the room flicker off. Then, back on. He turns his head—a framed photograph on the wall catches his eye. It’s a portrait of a young woman wearing a cap and gown. The inscription reads:
Received ✓
Nevertheless, Sherlock continues to guide him steadily over his swelling hardness as his other hand wanders to the front of John's boxers—and he wraps his own fingers around the astoundingly stiff and (truly) generously-sized member.
Sherlock opens his eyes. John’s respirations are accelerated—though he appears to be sleeping. No. Sherlock peers closer; John’s eyelids are too steady. He isn't sleeping. He's only pretending to be sleeping.
John is shaking with laughter as he turns towards the nightstand. "To be fair, I don’t know what I was expecting," he mumbles to himself.
"Yeah?"
He kneels down next to him, setting a hand gently on his shoulder. “Sherlock?"
John gazes up at him, a lump forming in his throat. “You look…”
His phone buzzes, and he becomes flustered as he pulls it from his pocket.
John inserts his hands beneath his pants, tentatively flicking his thumb over the head of his cock.
Sherlock looks up from his laptop to the corner where his violin lay atop its case. He plays his violin for nobody now. He rattles off speedy deductions to a vacant room where there is nobody to remind him of how impressive and amazing he is. He has nobody to make tea. He has nobody to be angry with him about the body parts in the fridge and the bullet holes in the wall (Mrs. Hudson gave up on all of those things long ago).
The two women moan and sigh together, and Sarah murmurs sweetly to Gabriela that she loves her more than anything in the universe.
“One would think we might have,” Sherlock asserts, “…if you had been more, erm, dexterous.”
, while you were at
Because that’s what love is, right? It would seem so. For that, and countless other things, Sherlock loves him too.
Sherlock pauses, gazing down at John. The candlelight flickers on his skin; his cheeks are a deep red, and his lips a dusky pink. His forehead is drenched with sweat, and his formerly combed-back hair has become unkempt, strands of it sweeping down his face.
Sherlock scowls at his response and playfully crawls his fingers up the inside of John's arm.
“Hm?” John tries to restrain his overwhelming curiosity. “What was it you were hoping to practice?”
Sherlock thinks of how his prior self might not have so easily let a problem like this go—allowing it to simply be solved in due time. But it’s just as Sylvia (who doesn’t exist) said: Settle down. Not every question in the universe must be answered immediately.
John smiles, his gaze becoming far off as he retrieves the memories. "Alright. I've got it."
"What?!" John bolts upright, quickly reaching for his crutches.
Sherlock pauses. “Am I?”
John squeezes back, and Sherlock doesn't let go until morning.
Sarah’s tongue thrusts and swirls into Gabriela as she pants and gasps her way to orgasm. After she rides out her pulsating body, the two of them stand. Sarah takes Gabriela's face into her hands and kisses her, and they slide their tongues together, sharing and savouring Gabriela's sweet taste.
"I would kiss you,” John says, “...but I think it might cause fission."
“Nonsense.” Sherlock bends down to knock on pieces of floorboard, inch by inch. “However, Mrs. Hudson deserves every penny for putting up with that imbecile of a husband for so many years.” He pulls at a board, yanking it loose. It reveals an empty space beneath, and he looks up at Mrs. Hudson with a triumphant grin.
Glancing up briefly from his phone, he notices William looking over, hands on his hips, tapping his foot impatiently. He wants John to leave. But John is nothing if not stubborn, and he doesn’t have the capacity for any more bullshit tonight. So he lifts his glass from the bar and points to it. “I’ll have another one, please.”
Molly quickly glances at John, searching for an explanation.
Sherlock sighs. “So what do you suggest I do?”
Then, words begin scrolling over the screen on an infinite loop, one line after the other.
John abruptly tightens his hold on him. “That’s your interpretation? Because right now, it seems I’m the one holding the pistol to your head.” He cocks the gun, if only to demonstrate a point.
“Nnnnnnngggg?” John croaks, coming to in a daze. “You okay, Sherlock?”
John continues to fuck him—he fucks him so hard he fears he’s going to break him, but he physically cannot make himself stop, fucking him harder and faster until he's throbbing and pouring himself into William's heat.
William brushes their lips together. “There may be clouds hiding them from view,” he says. “...but that doesn't mean they aren't there.”
Eventually, John becomes fully awake. He’s dizzy and slightly nauseous and he's got no idea how much time has passed. But although the world is a bit swirly, he sees Sherlock sitting next to him.
And with that, Anderson and Donovan slither away like garter snakes into the night.
“CBD regulates imbalances in the endocannabinoid system,” Molly continues. “Helps the neurotransmitters do their job. Takes the edge off for people with anger issues. Oh, I’m very tired.” She yawns. “Must be the marijuana, too. Goodnight!” She turns back away from him and lays her head on her hands.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock remarks. “Just a bee sting.”
He lets out a low whistle. "Oh, damn. You're right. They're gorgeous."
John lets his eyes fall closed.
Sherlock bolts up from his chair. “I’m going across the road to the cafe.” He turns stiffly towards Elisa and extends his hand. “Nice to meet you, Doctor Torres.”
“Goodbye, Sherlock.” John waves him off.
The restroom door swings open.
They both say it at once: the three words that Sherlock never, ever, ever thought he would say.
It’s not the strangest thing to occur this year by a long shot, and it’s barely been twenty-four hours.
If she’s surprised or caught off guard by his question, she doesn’t show it. No hitching of her breath or quickening of her pulse; no movement, yet no signs of hesitation.
She rolls her eyes at him and swats him on the arm, just as a car rolls up outside and honks its horn.
“You can call me William,” he purrs into his ear.
“And?” John presses. “What else?”
His eyes continue to bore into Sherlock. Sherlock focuses intently on a wilting lily. He sort of wishes he could wilt right now.
”John!” he groans dramatically.
"Petting?"
allowed to admire John’s balls.
"Mm. Oh, John."
His words are cut off by the other man’s lips devouring his, open and wet and desperate. A stifled groan escapes John's throat as he presses closer, his thin cotton shirt rough against John's bare chest. Shifting his leg between John's, he lifts his arms above his head, pinning him to the wall, sliding his tongue hungrily over the insides of John’s mouth.
John's eyes grow wide as he pretends to be affronted. "Why would I do such a thing?"
“Home.” John feels a rush of bliss spread through his chest. “Our home, correct? In the year—“ he ventures a guess. “Eighteen hundred and—“
All he knows is that the man he loves more than anything in the universe is in his lap, frotting against him, kissing him desperately as though he knows it will be the last time.
"Hilarious." John takes a deep breath. "Just maybe watch out for my feet, alright?”
"Lucille."
“Sherlock doesn’t have an umbrella,” John says aloud, for some reason, reckoning he can catch up with him before he gets too far. He flies out the door and down the stairwell, grabbing an umbrella on his way. He flings open the front door, and runs outside into the pouring rain, and—
John remembers, yet again, that he loves him.
Who knows what tonight will bring, after all? Is it possible that he’ll find comfort in the familiar: a few drinks and Sarah’s bed? He never really felt a spark with her, but perhaps it’s safer that way. Because a spark, he’s learned, can burn an entire house down.
"Yes. As much as I could have, given my breadth of knowledge. But it doesn't matter. It wasn’t until I met John Watson—and found a part of myself I didn't know I'd been missing—that I learned love's true meaning."
She pulls back to look at him, her thick eyelashes as dark as the black polish on her nails. Her hair is swept to one side in a loose ponytail, and her smile sparkles like the silver hoops dangling from her ears. Her strapless dress is elegant and sensual, hugging her waist and hips, and she unconsciously smooths it down to keep it from creeping up her thighs.
He looks back over at her. She’s in a deep sleep, breathing heavily. He feels a bit guilty for going into this situation without telling her, but he’s got no other choice. And he's certain that if she knew the reason, she’d understand.
I was telling you about a moment ago?"
It’s really quite lovely, his laugh. He laughs with his entire body—this is something Sherlock knows about him, but it’s the first time he’s
Sherlock frowns. He worries again about John's head injury. "And what about you? What will your contribution entail?" He moves closer to the edge of his chair and closer to John, waiting for his answer, because it's very important that he hear every word of the plan.
“No! Yes!” Sherlock huffs with frustration. “No, I wanted you to kiss me, but then—then you
John stirs. "Hey," he says with a yawn and a smile. "You’re home."
“No. John—” And in what seems to be yet another bout of temporary hysteria, Sherlock’s hand flies out towards his, fingers clinging to the sleeve of his jumper (holy god it’s soft). He tugs at it lightly.
“You as well.” She shakes his hand.
“Mmm.” Sherlock snakes his arms around John’s waist. “Need you closer, please.” With that, he pushes himself in, pressing their bodies together as tightly as they will go. He wedges his head into the crook of John's neck, not allowing for a single inch of space, and he scoops him in for a firm, full embrace.
This must be what it's like to be happy, he thinks. And although he's got no means for comparison, it must mean that John is a wonderful fake husband.
: Everyone
Because John knows this flight of fancy will end after the sun goes down. He knows why, and he knows how. So even as the temperature falls outside and raindrops become snowflakes whispering against the windowpane—John continues to burn.
It's unknown how many women fell victim to the Whitechapel Murderer, but it's widely accepted that there were at least five--commonly referred to as the "canonical five." Quite fitting that Moriarty's letter was written after their fifth victim. And furthermore, Sherlock realises a commonality in the names of the victims:
“So happy indeed!” Sherlock bats his eyelashes at John coquettishly. At this point, he’s simply playacting. “If you really love me, John, you’ll get me the beautiful blood succulent!”
Richard Brook was Moriarty.
“John!” Sherlock can’t contain the gasp that escapes him as he clings tightly to John with every limb.
John has nearly forgotten; the name already feels natural on his tongue. “Yes.”
“Argh! Get out of my brain!” John throws his anatomy textbook to the ground. An elderly woman looks up from her tea. John snarls under his breath and leans down to pick it up, noticing that it’s landed directly on an enormous diagram of the male reproductive system. He swipes it off the ground angrily.
He expects Sherlock to respond with his typical sharp wit and playful defiance. He doesn’t. He meets John's eyes, instead, and doesn't look away.
Gabriela is lying in the bed next to him, leaning against the headboard, staring at an open book in her lap.
It’s enough for now. Out of sight, out of mind.
Sherlock knows he came to the kitchen for a reason, but he can’t recall what it was. He’s certain John will be the death of him in one way or another.
“Obviously!” Sherlock cries out. “What I meant was... why is there thunder in January?”
“John.” Sherlock gives Molly a knowing wink, and she groans. “John, am I your boyfriend, or am I simply an incredibly sexy, charming genius you put your lips on in your spare time?”
The two men kiss and fumble at one another's clothes until they reach their candlelit bedroom. They collapse into a magnificently large bed, where they explore one another’s bodies with eager tongues and fingertips. They hold each other and whisper words of endearment until they can no longer bear the wait.
William loosens his grip on him—but he doesn’t let go entirely. He leans away, his gaze falling to the ground.
It’s Sherlock who says it first, his chin resting on the crown of John’s head, both of them light headed from their kiss.
"Hm. I’d like to kiss you in Paris, in front of the Eiffel Tower. In Bali, on a white sandy beach. In the chilly autumn rain. On Christmas morning, beneath the mistletoe. In front of—"
“You can, if you’d like.”
Not that Sherlock’s touched it. He's managed to keep his hands to himself. He tries not to think of it—though he does find himself thinking a whole lot about when John was touching
As they approach Mrs. Hudson’s flat, John appears to consider the size of his balls and wires. "Not sure if we'll both fit through the door at the same time, Sherlock. Or, you know...fit anywhere at the same time.”
wrong." Molly points her chopsticks at him in accusation. "He claimed that's when he
”I don’t know, Sherlock. I’m heavier than I look. All muscle mass, mind you.”
John decides to humour her, but he makes her something resembling coffee from an oddly-shaped pouch and a clunky machine in the corner of their room. She kicks off her shoes, curls up onto the side of the bed and thanks him.
John. Every hour, every moment of every day, for as long as you will allow—and that, to me, is the loveliest thing of all."
“Yes.” Sherlock brushes his lips against John’s. “I suppose we always do.”
"Sit down, John.” William grins. “It's time for cake."
John laughs, and his laughter is such beautiful music that Sherlock wants to cry. Hm.
Alternate chapter title: The One Where They Finally Have Sex in a Bed 😆
They talk about everything and nothing until the sun comes up. Sherlock refuses to sleep, he says, because he doesn’t want this perfect day to end. John kisses him on the shoulder and promises that tomorrow will be even better.
“I don’t know if you actually have Halloween wherever you are!” Molly continues awkwardly. “Although...perhaps every day is Halloween there, so there’s nothing special about tonight! Anyway. I’ll just get started with a few questions. First off...I work with dead people. Have we met?”
"Yes, John. A wedding, perhaps?" he echoes in jest.
Today 8:09 AM
Even on my worst days—and there are many—he makes me smile without even trying
“Well.” Sherlock brings the scarf to John’s coat collar, circling it around his shoulders with a grin. “I’ve got no interest in keeping it. I wonder what that says about me?”
"Do you mind if I—?"
Sarah nods. “When I saw you... I was shocked at how immediately afraid I became. Afraid of what Nicholas might do to you. More than I was ashamed of you seeing me, I was afraid of
John frowns back.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Fine. What about
answers only."
The flight to Vegas the next day is six hours and is mostly uneventful. John and Gabriela are seated next to an overly-talkative woman in her sixties who chats with Gabriela for what seems like hours.
"Nonsense. I must have mentioned it."
Not even the alcohol can dull the booming bass that erupts from the speakers, or the clamoring of hundreds of drunken people. It doesn’t dull the bright lights, either, or the scent of various colognes battling the smell of sweaty bodies.
He returns moments later, and shortly thereafter, the psychiatric specialist visits. Coincidentally, she's someone John knows from his undergraduate program.
“Of course I was bloody angry!” she says. “He was being a complete dick. To you and me both.”
Sherlock moans softly, "John." John hums lowly in response, pulling
John thinks Sherlock is better than he gives himself credit for, but he doesn't argue. His mouth is far too busy for that.
“Wow. Okay.” John carefully sets a hand on William’s shoulder and gives it a few stiff pats. “First of all—not trying to kill anyone. Secondly—I was reaching for the bottle of Belvedere.”
"It truly isn't," Sherlock states coolly.
John takes another small step towards him. "I won't."
John frowns. “Then why are we—” He pauses. A surge of panic. “Sherlock, are we...dead?”
“Go to bed,” he tells himself. It’s what John would say if he were here.
"One of us thinks of an object, and the other has to guess what it is. Would you like to play?"
Sherlock swallows thickly again, taking both of John's hands. "Good. Now come with me; I've got somewhere I want to take you."
"You okay?" John asks, his hands in his lap. "You suddenly got quiet."
John halfway expects her to be joking. “I can’t ask you to leave your own party. I can just... get an Uber.”
It's a bottle of whisky.
John’s fingertips brush lightly at his back, coaxing him to their own rhythm. Gradual and hushed, a crescendo; slow, then fast, then slow again. Steady beat,
“Cops came. Turns out he was already being investigated for a load of other white collar bullshit. So they took him away. As they were driving off, my clumsy ass slipped on the stairs, and I hit my head.”
Molly first frowns at John like he’s mad, and then she beams warmly at him. “Ah, so you know William? Nice to meet you, John. I’m Molly.” She holds her hand out to shake his. “That a London accent you’ve got?”
"Sure. I suppose."
"Of course I did." Or Molly did. Whatever.
John's orgasm brings Sherlock to his own nearly immediately. He moves faster and faster and faster until the waves of unadulterated pleasure pulsate erratically into John's hand. The room falls thoroughly silent but for their own gasps and moans and sighs and mutterings of one another's names—until they've wrung one another out completely.
Stamford nudges him lightly. “Gonna stop off at the loo. Then I’ll find a seat for us.”
He squeezes his shoulder. Sherlock's pulse quickens.
"Me, too," William says, and kisses him back.
After another moment of silence, Molly and Mrs. Hudson smile and nod, murmuring their approval, and they retrieve their hands to eat their dinner.
And there it is: the same look on her face that he saw before.
John fits easily into Sherlock's heat; it’s a path his body knows well.
It’s William’s day off, so John insists on helping prepare the drinks. He’s always wanted to make a drink behind a bar. William is hesitant, but he agrees—until John reaches for a bottle of vodka, and he leaps across the bar to intervene.
John kisses Sherlock’s right collarbone, and then the left. "Alright."
He hears footsteps on the staircase within seconds. "John, are you alright?" Sarah and Gabriela come through the door.
A sudden wave of drowsiness overtakes him. He glances over at the clock; it’s already half past one in the morning.
John begins to come, fast and hot and completely untouched, spilling himself onto Sherlock’s stomach as he calls out his name in return. “I love you, Sherlock,” he says. “I love you with everything I am, everything I always was, and everything I ever will be.”
John leans in to press their foreheads together. "Really.” He smooths down the sides of Sherlock's hair. "So you see why I was hesitant?”
Sherlock extends his arm towards the wall behind John and leans against it for balance. With the leverage, he continues to steer his hips forwards and backwards, rubbing their naked cocks together. The friction it creates is sublime. John exhales shakily, his eyes twisting shut. The room becomes filled with every sigh and moan that isn't captured by their mouths sliding together ravenously.
John falls silent. His eyes dart across the room, settling on a banner that hangs over the door.
"Tell me your fondest childhood memory," Sherlock suggests, realising that he knows very little of John's past.
Mycroft cuts him off. “Sherlock, I believe it would do you both well to remain silent for the entirety of this ride.”
Sherlock crinkles his brow in disgust. "You mean peanut butter and jam."
Or perhaps the universe is finally conspiring to get the two of them back together.
He doesn’t like that he’s lying to her, but he hopes it’s for good reason.
They talk. Just talk. Not about serious things, of course. They don't talk about things like their feelings, or fake marriage, or why John's suddenly got a beard now. They play silly games. They share things about themselves. They reminisce about things from long ago. Sherlock greatly enjoys it—especially the part where there is no kissing. Because they are Sherlock and John: two friends who are not married. Two roommates, just sharing laughs and memories. Laughs and memories only. Laughs and memories, and a bed. Yes, a bed. For medical reasons. Medicine. Science. They're sharing a bed for science.
On day two, he concludes that trying not to think about William isn’t doing him any good. Perhaps the solution is the exact opposite: to think over the situation as much as possible in hopes of gaining some understanding of his own frustration.
Making his way to the El Cortez on foot, John tries to wrap his head around all that’s happening. In just a couple of hours, he’ll be looking at Sherlock. He thinks of his eyes—green, blue, and gold. He can’t help but wonder: will they be harsh with anger when he arrives, or will they soften at the sight of him?
“You’ve never held anyone?”
John is trying to get me drunk on a two hundred pound bottle of wine. Send help. -SH
But he could really use a drink.
John pulls himself from Sherlock’s body, quivering with anticipation as he settles on his back. He takes a deep breath, spreading his legs apart, offering himself to Sherlock completely.
The two men stand there, completely still. Sherlock’s jaw trembles as John’s hovers inches from his, their bodies fitting comfortably together from chest to pelvis.
With a shivering exhalation, he tucks both hands behind John's head, pushing him in for a kiss that's deep and wet and passionate. They've spent many hours practicing before this particular kiss. This kiss is different. It's open-mouthed and messy, it's teeth and lips and tongues; it's full of lust and potential.
“Well,” John says. “That’s too bad, because it’s actually quite amazing.”
He pulls him from the table and kisses him passionately.
“Of course. I’m sure I’ll even pick up a few things we can try.” And they kiss. With tongue and everything.
The sun sets over the snow-dusted city landscape—turning the sky six shades of purple and blue.
"Clearly. You got us married."
She finally lowers her pistol to the ground. “Who do you think, John?”
”No. I was
"Did you go in already?" John asks.
“Oh.” Sherlock looks down at his attire, pretending not to notice how absolutely fucking gorgeous he is. “Yes. I’ve got a few errands to run, and then I’m heading over to Bart’s.” He checks the time on his phone and begins to rise from his chair. “Actually, it’s time for me to get going.”
“How can we help you, love?" Sarah asks.
A smile tugs at Sherlock’s lips. “It’s half past one. Technically, it’s already morning.”
Flashbacks from earlier this morning suddenly fill John’s head. Jim, the limo driver. His polite smile; the Irish accent. “Sherlock is one of my best friends,” he said.
“Those are Sherlock’s beehives,” Mary answers. “Guess he’s always loved keeping them, but the climate in Boston wasn’t ideal. He insisted on getting them here as soon as he arrived.”
"I don't know what any of that means."
"I'm sorry, Sherlock, I didn't realise it was—"
things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things—”
"You and I are no longer friends," he tells her.
a threat to
They talk about everything and nothing until the sun comes up. Sherlock refuses to sleep, he says, because he doesn’t want this perfect day to end. John kisses him on the shoulder and promises that tomorrow will be even better.
“Yes, Sherlock?”
"John." Sherlock hovers over him timidly, unsure of whether he's welcome to take the seat beside him.
He frowns at her. “Pardon?”
"I think I would.”
“You look nice.” John gestures towards Sherlock’s crisp black dress shirt and bespoke trousers. “Have you got plans?”
"Meeting you was quite inconvenient, you know."
He probably would have broken his beautiful neck if John weren’t there. John, with the reflexes of a soldier and tiny, remarkably strong arms. John, who quickly moves to catch him, spinning his flailing body towards himself for balance. John, whose hands settle protectively onto his hips. John, who doesn’t back away, even when Sherlock expects him to.
Marci. The one who stormed out of The Strand after William viciously insulted her, and John simply stood there and allowed it to happen.
The man coughs daintily into one curled up hand. “Do you love him, Mister Watson?” he asks, reaching for a glass of water.
But before he can, the man’s radio receives an incoming message.
Thank you to Marina for pointing out my mistake with the Russian surnames! 💜
"John."
Sherlock is ejected from his Mind Palace. “Come in.” His voice his hoarse; he wonders how long John’s been waiting. There’s really no way of knowing. It could have been hours.
when he's tipsy. He’ll go on about one topic until you’re sure there’s nothing left to say—and somehow, he’s able to drag out many false finales before the end.
but look directly at him.
The pure joy on is face is something Sherlock has rarely seen; it's irresistible and achingly beautiful, even in the darkness.
John tucks his hands beneath Sherlock’s buttocks and pulls him in, maneuvering him until he’s settled into the perfect position. Sherlock releases a rattling sigh as he begins to rock back and forth, rubbing the sensitive flesh of their cocks together.
Sherlock's eyelids drift shut, and he exhales another shiver. “I will never grow tired of the way your body reacts to my lips alone.” He rolls his hips into John’s, showing that he’s every bit as erect. “Come along; I will give you the rest of me.”
“Nothing to get ruffled over, mate. You and Watson will have your own room." His voice grows a bit more serious. "But honestly, Sherlock. You ought to give your brother a bit of credit. Even though you might not see all of it, he's taking numerous and tedious measures to keep you alive."
"But don’t you think maybe you should check?” asks the brain. “Just to make sure that nothing has changed. Because you kissed.”
John takes a seat on the sofa. He decides to waste no time. “You've brought me here to tell me more about Sherlock?"
None of that, however, compares to the craving he has for the taste of William. He wonders if the rest of him tastes as sweet as his mouth does.
"Of course." John flattens his palms over his knees. "So. Care to share what's going on in that beautiful brain of yours?"
"Sherlock, are you alright?"
"And then there was Angelo, and Irene..."
“There has always been something between us,” Sherlock continues. “It may not have a name, but it's there. You and I appear to have a chemistry that is, at the very least, undeniable—at its highest level, unprecedented. And I
"No," she muses. "You're not really the flower type, are you? And I suppose John knows that, since he's in love with you."
And there John is. All of him. He sits upright, his bedsheets tangled at the foot of the bed. His skin is dewy and glowing and freshly showered; his hair tousled and damp. The only thing he wears is a thin cotton towel draped over his waist.
John stares back blankly, his mouth hanging open. “I… Sherlock. I haven’t got a clue what you're referring to. We haven’t talked about this, not once. I think I’d remember—“
"It does.” And it looks like it's something John ought to wear for the rest of his life. "You must have deduced the exact size of my finger using some of your fancy techniques."
John refuses to let that happen.
Moriarty’s words are startlingly soft, even childlike. “I don’t understand why you love him. He is quite ordinary, you know.”
John smiles, wraps his arms around her shoulders and thanks her again. He hugs her for nearly a full minute. It’s fine—he’s got a minute to spare.
“But those things never actually happened. It can’t be a memory, Sherlock, if there’s nothing to remember.”
“It really is,” John agrees.
“By whom?” John asks.
“Right? What is it with old people and Wheel of Fortune?” Anderson asks.
There is neither sorrow nor joy in John's words. "It's four forty-two, according to the sky," he says.
And John wears shining armour quite well—but even John's armour gets dinged up on occasion. These are the times he's
"Yes," John whispers. "And you? Is this where you slept?”
John rolls onto the bed beside him, sighing happily. “Congrats, Sherlock. Your solution truly did work.”
And finally, Sherlock lays his head down next to John’s, and John wraps his arm around him, and he strokes and kisses his hair until they fall asleep.
He deletes it. He opens his photo album and goes through picture after picture of Sarah. Delete. Pictures of the two of them together. Delete, delete, delete.
“It’s simple. Everyone holds up five fingers. We all take turns confessing something we’ve never done before. Any person in the room who has done that thing puts down one finger. Last person to remain with fingers up is the loser.”
"It fits perfectly," he says.
"Yes. I like the way it sounds." Sherlock dips his head back, exposing his Adam's apple for John to put his lips on. "Should I stop?"
John can't wait to watch Gabriela kneel down and take Sarah apart with her mouth. He licks his lips in anticipation.
Sherlock feels John biting off a laugh; he slides his tongue over his bottom lip before steadily explaining himself. “We can do that as well, if you’d like...but I was referring to sexy costumes. Fantasy type things, roleplay, you know...just something to add even more fun.”
"It's fine, Sherlock. " John smiles tightly. "I'm fine. I don't need to know. You aren't entitled to share your past with me."
It goes exactly how he suspected. His friends are all liars. Except for John, who just keeps looking over at him and smiling. He knows Sherlock can read him like a book, so there’s no point.
Strong arms are around his waist, dragging him back from the edge. His eyes fly open.
"Alright. I won't deny that she cares about me. She is, however, annoyed by my 'questionable pastimes.' I'm surprised she hasn't evicted me by now."
alright?”
“I’ve been hunted for the past three years, and I’ve got a brother high up in the government. I have access to state of the art protection. Nobody ever suspects an apparently plain undergarment.”
He has absolutely no plan, but he knows he’s got to see William. He's got to try. He can’t give up, not without one final chance to be with the man he loves.
Sherlock releases John's arms, peels his body away, and reaches to the bedside table for a bottle of lube.
“I tried to forget about you, but over the next few days, I thought of little else.” He presses the palm of his hand into his thigh anxiously. “I tried to keep you at arm’s length—but I couldn’t say no to you. I didn’t
John turns back. “Are you certain you want—?”
Ten minutes ago, Sherlock was ready to die.
It's half eleven; an hour past the time someone usually comes to help John out of his wheelchair and into his bed.
John stands, frozen, just a few meters away. He always thought, when this moment came, he’d know what to do. But all he can do is watch.
"Always," Sherlock replies. "You can talk to me about anything, you know."
tall, handsome genius has saved my life more times than I can count.”
Lestrade nods, opening the car door to exit the vehicle. “But as I’m sure you know by now, there’s much more to the story. We can go into more details later.”
It's not as though Sherlock regrets what they did, though it does scare him. He wonders if John regrets it. He wonders if John is going to stop wanting to share Sherlock's bed with him. He even wonders, for a moment, if he's fled the flat altogether, escaping down the stairs on his tiny, semi-broken legs.
Oh, boy. He’s got some thinking to do, hasn’t he? So he weaves his fingers together beneath his chin, closes his eyes, and retreats to his Mind Palace. There, he revisits one afternoon months ago, when he sat in the waiting room of John’s clinic after his phone had died (he was so enthusiastic to share updates on a case that he couldn’t possibly wait until John got home).
“Goodnight,” Sherlock says with a giddy sort of smile, unable to contain the excitement of the case bubbling in his chest. “Thank you for walking me home. And thank you for tonight. It was fantastic, as always. Another perfect ending to another wonderful year.”
