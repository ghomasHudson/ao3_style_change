The client who had dropped the information into his lap this morning had been surprisingly convenient. Too convenient to be accepted at face value, of course. The moment she mentioned the scars he’d surreptitiously sent a text to one of his homeless network who worked the Baker Street underground station and was never far off. He was waiting for the girl on the street when she left and a text confirmed he’d followed her directly to the funeral home where she worked, no deviation. Only partly satisfied Sherlock had done a quick search while John was upstairs getting dressed. It revealed Hannah Walsh had been a member of Facebook since 2008 (not a new identity) and a subscriber to John’s blog since 2010 (not a new interest).
The brief telegram “REQUEST CONSULTATION BAKER STREET MORNING THIRD MARCH STOP A HEACHAM” had been welcome enough. Holmes had his lean months, even in busy years. Crime had been nodding of late - at any rate, the sort of crime that interested him.
“Ah, Watson. Well-met. We have been invited for supper. It is a rational household and dressing for the occasion is, thankfully, optional. Come along!” And he spun on his heel.
She glanced over at the untidy nest of newspapers on which sat, like broken eggs, our empty teacups.
I saw where this was headed. The scene in his head was as clear to me as if he had painted it on the sitting room windows and drawn aside the curtains with his usual flourish.
"Read 'em?" snorted Kitty. "Bobsy-boy," – she was perhaps three years his senior, but all the weary wisdom of those hard years and the harder ones before them laced her tongue with scorn – "Most likely women don't tell
“Then tomorrow morning, starting before dawn. You are a patent medicine all to yourself, doctor. Watson’s Early Evening Restorative.”
It was only after no little turning of mental cogs, cranked by a power that in my partner would have been called logic but in mine would be more truthfully termed serendipity, that the sight of a golden guinea placed in an upturned palm brought a name to mind as we travelled westward once more, through the City warrens around the Bank and along the Strand.
John Watson is a true healer, with a great heart and a rich fund of sympathy for his fellow man. But there are days when he is frustrated in his art, feeling seedy, oppressed by sticky weather (it
Silence first, though, as I stopped his mouth and my own by their joining. A first kiss, soft, thrilling. A second, deeper, satisfying. The third, the spark of tinder. Four, kindling the hunger that burns. Kisses beyond counting, leaping flames in the hearth.
“Ha! Another pattern drawn over the print; so near in shade that it is easily missed. Drawn in poison, judging by the fourth and fifth test, see… here. Only wipe a cloth over it – a pillowcase, a nightgown – and contact with the skin brings slow and certain death from failure of the vital organs.  Slow, certain and cruel.”
“The grass is nothing, Mr Holmes. The wall is everything. We have endured men perched in trees, men on ladders with theodolites, men with binoculars, men applying for work who say that other men sent them. Every pretext to cover spying out the land...”
He unbuttoned me, divided my smallclothes and drew me out, playing supple grip and twist games one-handed as once I did, as once I daresay did he, in those days, those years before. The blade he kept ever at his own throat, even when I sank to my knees, terrified that I might hurt him but utterly unable to stay standing. His eyes were grey stars in the hour before dawn and his gaze held me with that same strength as his fingers did.
After that, I never wrung anything but sighs, groans and the odd astoundingly filthy, whispered word out of him. He never bucked and thrust as he did when his prick was in my mouth, only lay like deep snow at midnight, shivering now and then, no hand on himself or on me, only his gothic labyrinth of a mind, twisting with perverse pleasures.
"I've made a proper fool of myself, haven't I?" he said at last, studying the badge on his helmet as he held it in front of him in both hands.
I placed a vial of clear liquid upon the blotter. Readers of the Strand might have preferred it smashed to more dramatic effect, but his desk was a fine piece in French walnut and not at all at fault for having such an owner.
Meantime I worshipped at his feet – at one perfect foot. Offerings of kisses I gave to it, of laving tongue and humming breath, of the tracery of fingertips and the buttressing of thumb-presses: at last setting the arch against my groin and rubbing myself against his passive heel shamelessly, opening my own trousers for ease and access.
She knew, of course. Clean linen starts and ends soiled, and she was married once. Never a single word on the subject; nary so much as a look, mark you. Only safety and sanctuary, only well-trained maids who knocked and waited and who never dusted too early in the morning. If Sherlock Holmes ever in his adult life loved a woman, with all the intensity and carelessness of his singular nature, it was our landlady.
He aimed a shy and charming smile in my direction and waggled his eyebrows.Ever since our intimate friendship took a turn for, well, the very intimate indeed, I have become something of an expert in Watsonian smiles. I make my bread and cheese – and the tobacco bill – by mastering the most arcane knowledge of crime and human folly. The Fortnum’s pickle on a silver fork, the Havana cigar that is more than mere sustenance, comes from the most specialised study of all – his moods, his desires, his pleasures – the contentment of  a lover in which I have found, somewhat to my surprise, the summit of mine.
"Do you not think that the sulphur cockatoo there bears a distinct resemblance to Chief Inspector Pearson?" was the only response. I had to admit, privately, that the way it pecked at a cuttlefish bone in angry stabs, hopping about and making a great deal of noise, an untidy crest of improbable yellow peaking on its head, had a familiar feel. For a minute or two Holmes lingered, his attention divided between bird and keeper, surely contriving to retain every last detail of both. Then with an airy wave he turned away. The keeper winked at us both and went back to his sweeping.
I fear that my collar ends were twisted, my tie askew and I very possibly had on odd socks as I opened the door. The visitor hobbled in, took the measure of the stairs with a sigh and put out her left arm. The footman was at her side in a second but she waved him away, silently waiting for me to step up to the courtesy. Thus we made our way up to the sitting room, preceded by the footman, whose eyes were round as billiard balls as he turned at the corner of the landing and looked back to me and to the lady leaning in to me, wheezing as she reached the first floor. She was quite a weight, but it would not have been the act of a gentleman to even hint at that, nor at the cramp which was beginning in my bad leg.
"Yours is manifestly not the only hair shop in London." Two million women could hardly be served by an establishment six hundred feet square. "If it is only artifice or vanity this person condemns, why not spread the venom more widely? Put every such dealer in fear, and all their customers. Something more personal is surely intended. Forgive me," for I saw Kitty anticipate my next question and grow pale, "The
Even as I pumped his hand and congratulated him, a diagnosis formed. If a lump appears where it should not, expect a bruise following. If a policeman, and this one above all others, appears at a suspiciously convenient moment, expect Sherlock Holmes leading. Yet this must be more than a mere pantomime for my benefit. Constable Wiggins, however, would not be drawn.
“I beg you do not misunderstand me, my dear fellow. My dear Watson. John. I have never loved – but one. Never made room for another’s love – but one. It is spring, the very time for new beginnings. High summer will come, autumn and winter too – we shall spend them all together, if you will permit it. Just now, though: just now, I would wait. Live with this understanding a little while longer, before we have declarations and
I hadn’t even to put a hand to myself before we convulsed, Holmes first and I, ever following, after. Words had left us a while back, but if anyone had passed the door, they would have needed none to hear quite well  enough what we were about.
He searched my face, to see if I took his meaning, and what I might make of it if I did. I am, it is true, sometimes slow on the uptake. He tried again, stressing his words with a lift of his expressive brows.
Solely, it transpired, the vital fact that might have saved Butterworth significant expenditure of breath. In each case the assailant, hanging back in the shadows of a side alley, had thrown the acid from some distance in a round glass vial that had shattered on impact, so that the lady's hair was first to dissolve, only then her shawl or coat. In other words, the missile had been bowled.
"It never will, so long as humankind endures. I could chain myself to that wheel until they peel me off it dead or doddering, and still it would turn. Watson, I am not like you: so full of the milk of human kindness that they could make cheese out of you. If at times – in those powers you speak of - I am more than you, then I am less too. I have no vocation.  I have only choice. And this is mine: to set right what I can as it is brought to me, and to leave the rest to Providence."
I settled myself for an evening in the company of him I loved best. Idle talk, he called it, with a gleam in his eye. The exchange of confidences –
This fire I give myself to, in this fire I would gladly die. Watson’s hand around my cock was urging me on, coaxing my flesh to desperation, stroking me past reason to mindless rut.
Of two members of the clan Wiggins, a zookeeper, a musician and a chandler’s assistant. Somehow, it didn’t have the right ring to it. I sat down again.
“I will move the hives, then.” I was still not certain whether to see him off or to hear him out, for he had the air of one who makes an opening gambit in a chess game with a view to a long contest.
I’d had enough common sense to cover my teeth, at least, but a novice must take direction. It was clear he had done this before - had it done to him, for him, many a time. I had the fleeting wonder why he did not take me in his mouth instead.  Then I knew it was all of a piece with him:  his daily choice to risk failure, disappointment and frustration, to ask of people more ordinary than he more than they might be able to give. He lived for the drama of what might happen next, in the boundless confidence that whatever it was, it was better that he fly and fall than that he never took flight.
I admit I had some notion that behind the heavy door dripping with moisture and set in an equally wet brick wall up a short lane in Limehouse, would be a gang of Chinese labourers bending over vats and hot irons, and that we would have to converse by signs or find a youngster to translate. Instead the face that broke into a gap-toothed grin at the sight of us was red from the heat where it was not pasty white from lack of sunshine, and from his broad country speech the man’s ancestors might have been at Hastings ‘gainst the Conqueror.
"Wherein lies the beginning of wisdom," Miss de Merville put in gently, before I could roundly agree with him.
"Yes," he replied to my question before I could actually get it past my open mouth. Where he had learned them I could only imagine.
A sallow-faced man with a neat but full black beard, wearing a suit cut in the fashion of an Indian clerk and swathed in a shawl big enough for an elephant, peered at me through pebble glasses from underneath the brim of a deep umbrella. His voice was soft, his words a little accented but perfectly clear.
Oh, indeed. London life was never so complex as it was at his journey’s end, when I wanted only that Holmes should devote himself with interest to the solution of a problem that grew larger every day, but of which I still could not bring myself to speak.
We lunched on meat pie and smoked eel at an establishment in the Tower Bridge Road that he had evidently been to before, although not with me, as he pointed out this and that East End delicacy which he claimed to be "better that you’ll get at the Savoy".  Holmes spent the meal sipping at a bottle of porter straight from its neck, his silk hat balanced on his knees beneath a napkin, which was as distracting to me and fascinating to the other patrons as if a gorilla had walked in and ordered half a pint of cockles. He assured me that I already, did I but know it, possessed all the information I needed to divine the nature, purpose and next steps of our journey – "some few, strictly incidental, details excepted."
“Sir, they beg you at least examine the end hive. Her Majesty is nearing the end of her reign; a successor will soon emerge.”
What a sight.  Head thrown back, hair a halo around his head on the pillow, eyes screwed shut, mouth slack-jawed and dry-lipped ‘til he licked away the last trace of me, broad chest heaving. I was quite up for some shouting myself, but I doubted he was quite up to making me, just then. Instead I settled myself beside him and shifted into a contented tangle of limbs.
As we stepped back out onto the Strand, provisioned and paid-for, I was in the act of hailing another cab when a sharp tug on my sleeve held me back.
He had stumbled up the seventeen steps and through the sitting room door as if he’d alighted from a pumpkin pulled by mice, and he looked as if it had transformed from a golden coach on the way, with him still inside. Hat and hairpiece he tore off and flung at the hearth.
He was oddly pale for a man who had survived far worse with only a snarl and a shrug. The way he put away a glassful of French cognac surprised me too. I started to doubt my diagnosis.
"You know this person?" I asked my friend. Both of them laughed, not precisely unkindly but I could not help but feel nonetheless it was at my expense.
Even as I said the words, I was shrinking in my seat in anticipation of the coming explosion. Silence, or perhaps strangling myself with my own stethoscope, would surely have been preferable.
He always smiled when I gave him back his own words like this, when I presented him to himself as I do in the stories, those paragons of misdirection. It is true, I have had no declarations on bended knee, no love letters and, even if the law were other than it is, I should not expect to be greeted at our front door with a kiss. Devotion crept up on us unawares, inverted attraction persuading us against our will and we are, when all is said and done, English gentlemen for whom enough is quite as good as a feast.
At the last, what deity there may be that watches over inverts, addicts and consulting detectives who are both, surely heard John Watson’s shout.
I am well used to his habits of concealment. Holmes at heart is an incorrigible tease. He taunts clients with his deductive tours-de-force, dangles vital clues before honest, befuddled members of Scotland Yard, and leads me a merry dance – lately, by night as well as day. The particulars of those nocturnal teases are not for publication, naturally: I mention them only for the purpose of illustration. Pleasurable anticipation is one thing, however – downright obfuscation is merely infuriating.
She had changed her hair. No doubt for someone else's. When I last saw her, going back down to the cells after sentence, she had been a wraith, whittled to less substance than ever by incarceration, but still the Miss Kitty Winter I had first met, the very spirit of vengeance. The judge had heard, in chambers, more details of Gruner's sordid habits than I had cared to learn and decreed a mere six months without hard labour as her punishment. Knowing the Bermondsey slums she came from, Wandsworth prison was certainly not significantly worse lodgings. Watson wouldn't have it of course. A lady in distress brings out all his best – or most irrational, depending on one's point of view – instincts, and he was all set to swear that her maiming the Baron was an accident. He only backed off when I told him, quite accurately, that she had already told the police not only that Gruner deserved worse, but she wished she'd done it years ago.
“Because, Mr Holmes, word gets about, just as you say. The ‘word’ in Arlesey is that my sister and I have been educated above our prospects; that we put on airs and dare to argue against the dispensations of Providence; that we are, in a word, bluestockings, whom no man should care to have in his house. ”
I looked at him then, because his voice stumbled over the last of it and I had to be sure. Sure that it was not that he merely preferred what was familiar to a change. Sure that he needed me.  Sure that he would not have stopped me even so. My heart was pierced in that moment.
Regular readers of my work will be aware that his view of the law is a matter of honouring the spirit, whilst often disregarding the letter. Laws that stand to protect the innocent and weak, that hold to account the responsible and the strong – Holmes holds these self-evidently to be just and unbreakable, save by cads and curs. Laws that protect only ignorance and fear, or stand in the way of uncovering deeper truths and bringing about natural justice, he takes little note of and himself often breaks without a second thought.
I chuckled. “You tell me this as if it were news, Holmes. I have lived with you, on and off, for years.”
“Good God, Watson, John, you lovely boy, get on your knees. Here it is, now, swallow it down for Christ’s sake before I spend on your shirt. Ah!”
To my knowledge, he had not often said it, nor even once, but I let that pass, for it did sit with the comparative indifference I had noticed at Arlesey towards the misses Heacham. Nevertheless, I could not see what, aside from those trousers, they would have to hide.
How aptly named. I waited, with a book from the kiosk, until hunger drove me to the public house down the street. An indifferent lunch and a pint of flat beer later, I went back to the ticket office. No-one had called for me, or left a note. The foreman at the goods yard told me that “that tall bloke” had not said how long he wanted his cases kept safe, that it was no skin off his nose, what was another package among a hundred, they could stay there a week for all the difference it made to him.
Stung, I desired to sting in return: to pierce the amour of his smug, infuriating, unassailable confidence. I puffed up my chest and prepared for battle, striding across the room until I could make him hear me without even raising my voice.
Straight back to ordering again. No surprise there. I covered my head with the bedclothes and took charge of what I found under them, which was a rather fine cockstand, considering the short time he’d had to grow it. I applied myself to the task of orally reducing him to abject pleading before much more time should pass.
So it was that when I brushed off the familiar name with a nod and a shrug, he did not press me, but only set again to grumbling complaint about the misuse of the English language, ranging far and wide from the article that had started it.
He looked up, his face moving in and out of the shadows, lit by a flickering flame refracted through a lurid blue solution in a beaker of twisted glass.
He wanted me to make the first move. I poured him his drink and set it down beside his chair with a theatrical sigh.
It was an iron-hard, bone-dry February. The London sky that might otherwise have been clear, crystalline blue shading to purple and indigo as night fell was draped instead in a veil of smoke. Half a million coal fires were coughing out their lives above the rooftops and four million souls huddled around hearths that might be expansively gracious, bravely keeping up appearances or simply squalid, so long only as they were warm.
He had not wanted to suspect her, he told us. He had read of the attacks and persuaded himself that someone hated the victims for quite another reason, that they were connected by something other than Number 94. But she was not naturally cruel, in fact the very opposite and, tormented by regret, she had at last confessed all to him. She had promised it would stop if only he could find a real cure, so that they might have a real marriage.
"Enough funds for comfort.  Careful choice of location. For me, the sense of a life well-lived, a vocation well-discharged."
He sat with it in his lap for a moment, contemplating. Then he sprang up, went to his desk and did as I asked. The lock clicked, he put the key back on his watch chain. Moving to his chemical table, he began to set up retorts and spirit burners.
I write remembering both great and small who are lost to us. The highest and the lowest came to our door in all weathers and all conditions of heart, and most of them left lighter in spirit than when they arrived at number two hundred and twenty-one, B.
Holmes raised one eyebrow, though his smirk told me I was allowed to have my grouse for the past week and a half’s famine.
“More…personal offers have disturbed our peace. We do not mingle, you must understand: do not dine out save at the houses of one or two intimate friends; do not receive guests from the neighbourhood, do not go to church. An offer of marriage from a gentleman one has never met, and whose real motives must be plain merely from his address, is a positive insult. It is not the only such insult I have had; the latest, only last week.”
“Indeed.  Bees cannot survive if they lie, Mr Holmes. What is to us a virtue, is to them an instinct towards the propagation of their species. The community is all, and they find the preoccupation of the human species with individuality the most baffling, yet fascinating, of all the differences between us. They form theories about all of us who keep close contact with the hive.”
Besides, chemistry to him was a thing of transcendent beauty, and poison a hideous scar on its face.
I confess it took me a second or two to remember, to take in what he was trying to tell me. It had been too easy. Something was missing. We did not have enough evidence to lay before the authorities and Brace knew it, for he knew the law of evidence, for all that he dealt day by day in commonplace commercial disputes over contracts and interest rates. So why was he so eager to come with us and hand himself in?
He paused, knocked out his pipe on the arm of the chair and put it back in the rack. To do so, he had to cross to my side of the hearth. What he did not have to do, was to go at once to his knees by my chair and take hold of my hand. Yet there it was, my hand clasped between his long, fine fingers, even before I yelped with the shock of it. There was his narrow face, inches from mine, grey eyes fixing me with a look that I could not fathom: half yearning, half apology.
I have many faults; I freely admit it. I give generously to cards and the turf, though they seldom return the favour.  Given the chance (which when Holmes is on a case would be a fine chance indeed), I would lie in bed until noon. I revel in my enjoyment of expensive women and inexpensive wine. I am an accomplished liar in print, an almost-waste of a medical education and latest of all, a filthy-minded, socially reprehensible (though absurdly happy) sodomite.
For the first time in my life, I had put all the pieces together and all of them fitted. And Sherlock Holmes was applauding me, a small shower of ash sprinkling onto the rug as he clapped.
As in all our history it had turned out to be the ‘incidental’ details on which the whole case, and oftentimes a human life, depended, this was less helpful than perhaps he intended. It came down, as ever, to trust – and I had long ago given all mine into his long, white hands and steady gaze.
He jumped up and ran to the window, looking back at me with exasperated fondness, but the client had already come in and was clipping the stairs with a rapid and distinctly feminine tread. The Police, then, stood confident in their powers. A victim?
He was laughing, laughing in that peculiar soundless way he had when amusement and a summons to action wrestled together for his attention.
“You must forgive our intrusion into the sanctum of your home, and the fact that it must be brief. We have escaped from a tedious reception at the Palace through a side-door and will doubtless be missed before the hour is up. But on this day, since Mr Holmes has
Our client, in her library, greeted us over half-moon glasses and a book: a book which revealed itself, as she laid it on the table beside her, to be in the original Greek. Holmes registered this as he did everything else in the room - sharp, quick glances eating up every clue and signifier, making ready to show off his wares.
I watched them set off down the Embankment, tall and confident. There was definitely something about a uniform. Ah, the many days when it helped me into a woman’s favour. Long past now, of course, for so many reasons including the dear, dry voice that interrupted my musings.
He perched on the window seat looking out over the garden and folded his arms, admiring the camellias and himself in equal proportions.
"Set a thief to catch a thief. One solicitor to find another. There is a brotherhood amongst them as there is in any profession. You let me publish it only a few months back – the Norwood builder…" Watson was glowing with verve, with the knowledge that he was really on to something. I could have kissed him there and then in the street.
I tipped my hat in haste and was on the pavement hailing a cab by the time Watson had done with making our excuses. Freshly laid tarmacadam streets rumbled under our wheels and scraped beneath the horse's hooves. Stone setts were out: the motorcar was coming.
I jumped back to awareness and a careless apology, making light, always making light. A damned fool. I snatched up my napkin, tossed it on the table and started to get up.
I know that you have his card in your pocketbook." He was already pulling it out. 'McFarlane' had written to Doyle thanking Watson for the care with which he had rendered the story but also for the tact in concealing his real name, which was printed on thick, ivory card in curlicues announcing his office to be in Essex Street, a mere quarter mile away.
How you like, my dear Holmes. If it was never to be stolen embraces at dead of night, only “little fairy –tales” of romanticised mystery born and baptised in ink in those Baker Street rooms, only the press of his hand  on my shoulder or the whisper of breath in my ear: I was up for it, for him, ready and willing.
My insides clenched like a mailed fist. I glanced toward the lurking livery standing by the door; he nodded once. Our exalted guest lifted her veil.
I have had fleeting lovers, hardly worth the name: an hour, a night, a summer weekend. Suitors, teasers, snatchers, voyeurs. None can match him, my spouse of Baker Street.
“I am biding my time, Watson,” he replied at last. “The rest will follow, if only I dare be bold enough.”
"Pretence: the very word. Why would you say I continue in my line of work, if not as a profession? Art for art's sake? Justice? Success?"
I always did, and not only to see him home safe. One way or another, I have been waiting for Sherlock Holmes all my life. Waiting to meet him, waiting to question, praise and scold him as he expected or deserved, waiting at a church door for him to see me off as I married away, waiting to welcome him back from the dead after he’d fled in the opposite direction, waiting for a friendship not granted to many in this world and offered like the
I checked the wings of the stage, the exits from the grand hall, even the public convenience. Nothing. I do not mind admitting I was in a sour temper by the time I emerged from the Crystal Palace to find him loitering beside a stone fountain with an expectant, not-at-all-contrite expression.
"Now, sir, that's what we in the Force call what you'd say 'word on the street', 'the usual sources'. What we know, hence our 'intelligence'." He was so proud of his sliver of learning that it was almost a pity to demolish him.
“I did not say I agreed with it, Holmes! It is a fact that prosecutions for obscenity have been brought, and succeeded, where the intention was simply education, or to campaign against anything from Malthusianism to the Roman Catholic Church.  People do hold such views. Perhaps your journalist was only being careful.”
I knew what he was asking, and when I took down my copy of the Medical Register to see what practice in Eastbourne I might be able to buy into, so too he had my answer.
Instant obedience was my reward. Not slavish, never that: not my Watson. As soldier and surgeon both, he knows command is three parts trust to one of authority. Why he trusts me, half-mad and wholly incorrigible as I am, is a blessed mystery into which I don’t enquire. I take it as gospel, just as I caught his hand by the wrist, then, and kissed a leisurely, feather trail from thumb pad to crook of elbow. Always the rough with the smooth, in love-making as in matrimony. Always mine, as I am his.
It was the nature of our work together to find out people’s secrets – jealousy, greed, hatred. Love. Passion. So it was inevitable from time to time, in the years following, that we would uncover love stories I could only tell by covering them up again, could only write of indirectly - avoiding words like a game of Taboo. Lovers became sisters; life-mates became house guests; masters and servants only passed each other in the hall.
Lions growled and Tasmanian tigers yipped; emus grumbled and hyenas laughed. Somewhere in the depths of the Reptile House, an Indian swamp adder doubtless slithered, but we did not get so far. At the great aviary Holmes stopped, then let out a piercing whistle that drove clouds of birds into the air in a firework display of colour and movement. Presently a figure scuttled out from one of the man-sized doors at the back of the cages, its face first scowling at the disturbance but breaking into a grin as it came closer. The keeper was young, stocky and dressed in rough serge and a peaked cap. He carried a broom bearing worn bristles and a number of inevitable stains.
There is, I think, no need to grace the culprit with so much as a pseudonym. The case itself was, as Holmes put it, “worth a fee but not worth the printing ink.”
I could hardly believe this was happening. It was a stage play come to life, and my scripted line must be:
We have been treated to some memorable Sunday morning feasts in our time. Smoked scotch haddock, eggs Benedict, Spanish-cured ham
The good doctor could offer little hope, although he doubted aloud that 'cure' was quite the word. There were quacks a plenty, claiming to turn black into white for the right price. But he had never known real medicine to effect such a change.
It was all my thought of the evening, right up to the hour of retiring to bed. Sentiment, avoid sentiment at all costs. Even if the alternative is stiff-necked pride. Yet my dreams – my dreams were of a firm handclasp, the soft cough before the gentle enquiry or the loving rebuke, the halting step, the unfaltering courage. Near midnight I woke with a start, swore like a sailor and dressed haphazardly before lurching down the narrow staircase and snatching a  blank telegram form from between the pages of “Highways and Byways in Sussex” in order to jack-knife it to the mantelpiece.
He smiled like a proud teacher at a prize giving.  Unfortunately I then proceeded to drop the prize-book open-faced down on the dusty schoolroom floor and then trip over it.
“By-blow smuggled in? Hardly enough reason to hide her away – people are, as you do very often say, unobservant, and take things to be as they expect. Or they may instead be friends, as close as sisters. Whichever it is, surely it makes no difference to their plight.”
“I know at least two of them who would be hearing nothing they had not already done themselves. Not with me,” he added hastily, seeing my expression.
“My Lord. My…word.” He was naked in an instant, gloriously naked. He’d been comfortably naked all evening under the dun woollen flannel, soft as lawn from years of wear. I started hastily on my own clothing but he stopped me at shirtless and barefoot.
Before he had finished speaking I was there, crouching over him my head between his splayed thighs, both of us head to end, the coverlet thrown around my shoulders, my tongue sounding him, bitter and sweet, my balls cradled by two slick fingers greased from heaven knew where he had magicked up something better than spit.
but it shows no real sign of having been read and holds pride of place in the bookcase containing those volumes meant for show, not use. Oh, do not protest, madam, every library in every country house has one. The book you
Our client had worn a red camellia in the buttonhole of her coat, on the morning she came to call at Baker Street.
“Today, my dear Watson, you woke in a lather and for want of a seeing-to. We shall remedy that presently. Next you partook of Bright’s Coffee (special chicory blend, no accounting for taste) and lime marmalade on toast. Mrs Pelham has called again today whilst I was out – she of the gardenias and the cap set firmly at you – beware! Lunch was a chop and supper a ham sandwich. Bradley’s are out of your favourite cigarettes, so you smoked an inferior brand and drank superior brandy to make up for it.” He kissed me, deep and slow. “Your new toothpowder is flavoured with cinnamon. I will allow it.”
His gloved hand brushed mine in the act of surrender. I enjoyed the contact for that fraction of a second, as I enjoyed all such accidents. Together, since I had first recognised in myself the source of that pleasure, they might add up to as much as an hour of bliss. One cannot help but crave time – we are mortal creatures – and a year's worth would not have been enough. A lifetime would have fallen short. And yet every instant was perfect and sufficient in itself. The paradox of desire.
We had the place blissfully to ourselves: not that, had she been at home, Mrs Hudson would have dreamt of disturbing us nor even acknowledging what she undoubtedly knew what we were up to. Blindness and deafness are, contrary to first intuition, essential qualifications in a good landlady. Holmes had been hard on a case for weeks, and when he was, that was the only thing he was hard on. Success meant satisfaction in more ways than one, and around tea time a telegraph boy, working the holiday, had pushed through the press of people and delivered success in a tersely-worded telegram.
In a green sea lapped with lace like the foam on the shore he surged and drew back, quickening his strokes, inch by inch, moment by moment, urging on my cries with whispers deep and dirty as ditchwater, light and fresh as spring, blessing me, cursing me, Adam’s apple moving under the knife.
“An apt turn of phrase, in the circumstances. What you have said is only part of the reason we avoid conversation – ‘trivial’ or otherwise. The other is that the general run of humanity, that is to say non-members, so very often avoid saying what they mean. The faculty of communication is too important to waste.  No-one can be perfectly candid in his speech unless he be a boor or a saint; no-one can force candour upon another. The Diogenes stops word games at the gate by stopping words altogether. Better say nothing than prevaricate. The man who creates fiction out of real life – not quite the thing. ”
I waited. The London train came and went. After half an hour, Holmes had still not emerged. As I had no idea what he was looking for or why, I could only hope that he had not somehow got on the train by a back way and left me behind, and that the end of my vigil should not be a telegram from Town bearing brisk apologies and brisker instructions.
have to worry about money ever again. You make fun of my stories but they have sold – by the hundreds of thousands. Especially once Doyle got the Americans interested. What about you? You yourself can hardly pretend you are in the game for bread and cheese anymore."
No reason to conclude, then, simply because we were here, that crime was the thread I had been bidden to follow. It wove its way in and out of London, the metropolis’ many parts standing for the warp on the frame, a pattern burned out of the whole cloth by these disappearances and reappearances of Holmes…and blast it, he had done it again as I stood puzzling on the pavement.
I wriggled this way and that, trying to catch sight of everything and wishing I had not tucked my notebook away in my valise. A precisely-tuned cough turned my attention to Holmes who, ever since we had left the railway station, had sat silent and still, brows drawn over the coming case, hands clasped under his chin in prayer to the god of reason. I was about to apologise for disturbing his concentration when I took in his dry, indulgent smile, and the used envelope and stub pencil he was holding out to me.
if that isn't a straight menace and has to stop!" She glared, then flushed and busied herself turning pages. Miss de Merville gamely pretended not to have noticed her language. Watson, by contrast, winced visibly but he drew out his notebook and consulted them on the particulars.
As matter of fact I was pretty well acquainted with Sir Mancherjee Bhownagree, the Member of Parliament for Bethnal Green, but to reveal how would be a breach of professional confidence.
“I told her that I could divert all attempts to acquire or to mine her estate – I shall have any future correspondence for ‘Mr Heacham’ dealt with by a solicitor who is in my debt – and that I could not see why that should not be the end of it. When she hesitated, I told her that she should not be ashamed of her nature. I could have meant her intelligence, her reticence, even her looks. But when she glanced, without a second thought, at the camellia garden, her fear came into focus. She loves another woman, body and soul, and has not yet altogether shaken off society’s incomprehension of nature’s true variety.”
“Tut. The conservation of energy, remember. Heat cannot of itself pass from one body to a hotter body. I am a cold fish, as has been established; ergo the source must be you, or else we were acted on by forces additional to the system.”
"Am I," I repeated slowly and deliberately, caressing his palms with my thumbs, "the sort of man whom you can trust with such a confidence? With precisely
And here I am, playing word games again. Behind a drawn blind and a locked door – though foolish, I was not stupid – we kissed to exhaustion, panting between bouts. We never reached my room. We did it there and then, utterly unable to stop the rush of blood and heat: wrestling clothes away, stumbling to the couch where we fell on each other like beasts, hands on bare skin, bared cocks, the strange and wonderful sensation of another man’s prick swelling against my palm, of seeking him splayed out on the familiar, battered velvet cushions, of hearing the familiar, cool voice of reason hoarse with desire and proposing all manner of unreasonableness.
Love was the only thing he didn’t make me wait for. That was a glorious surpise which he sprang on me in the summer of ’95. I’m pleased to report he has sprung on me with delicious iregularity – in every sense of the word - ever since. We had to snatch the hours in secret, of course. Absent the odd dangerous and, precisely because dangerous, exciting tryst among the thick underbrush of woods in high summer, from midnight until dawn was our time,. And what time we made of it. Just as well we neither of us spent our days tied to a desk or minding a machine.
"Now sir, there's really no call for that." He wagged his finger under my nose. "I wasn't born yesterday."
So as we walked the streets, quiet today without the rumble of market barrows, shouting costers or the tramp of dockers bound for the Surrey Quays, I determined to be at peace with myself and with him, to treat this as a holiday outing, to stop asking direct questions – and to solve the damn puzzle before it was handed me on a dish like a naval treaty.
"I did, all save they what’s here already. They’ll be sent out as by your instructions once they’re all done with."
The face he made as he turned to look back over one shoulder might have pickled a whole jar of walnuts. Both of us were panting; I from the exertion, not to mention contortion, of acting as lady’s maid to someone a head taller than me - he, so fast and shallow that I half-expected him to pitch forward onto the nightstand and end up face down and senseless amongst the debris of powder and hairpieces.
In scarcely ten minutes more I was thankful to be in a cab at last, headed, by Holmes’ command, for Victoria Station, yet despite my entreaties he refused to lay out the game ahead, only bidding me "observe and deduce" as he had so often done before.
Well, others may reap it now. I have laid down my sickle. I keep bees; I live apart from society's scrutiny in a house bounded only by acres of my own land, by flowers and sheep and the sea; and I am protected by the judgement of appearances.
Holmes, who had been known to make a choice statement or two of his own about educated women, and handled money with as little attention as he could possibly manage, could still be moved by this appeal – to be allowed to be different, as his fame allowed him to be.
"For a special occasion, perhaps," she allowed. "Not today. Yet for some it is a near-daily indulgence. It is these who have been assaulted with prussic acid in the street and as far as I can determine, each one was a customer at the exclusive
As for sodomy, I had a means of escape. Foote and all the other brawny, golden-haired Adonises after whom I pined, unrequited, in the years after him were only half my dreaming. Voluptuous maidens and statuesque matrons of many lands put themselves conveniently – sometimes it seemed continuously - in my way. I am not ashamed to say I feasted from the banquet of womanhood and gave every dish its due.
Holmes froze in his seat. I gave the stage my full attention but allowed myself a small smile and a sideways glance for a candid camera snap of his face, scarlet and silenced.  I hope I did not spoil the performance for him; he observed afterwards that the composer certainly ought to become less well known the more people heard his music.
"You really supposed they were going to tell you?" wondered Watson. "Imagine it were your most intimate secrets, probed by strangers, in however worthy a cause. Surely you would – for decency's sake
Holmes of course, could never stick to a script. He would have truth and not fiction, however much it stung me. He pressed my hand, compelled me to look at him again, and spoke with a fervour he usually reserved for the courtroom.
of Xenophon which no man – excuse me, I think no lady either – picks up purely for pleasure. You are using for a bookmark a postcard of the exterior of Girton College for women as it appeared before the newest buildings were complete; you were not there by then. In the bookshelves you use often, are well-thumbed works on natural science by the dozen. Incidentally, you want the translation of Strecker’s organic chemistry with annotations, not the original: I can recommend it.”
He stopped in the midst of swirling the glass in his fingers to warm the spirits and shot me a look of mingled surprise and speculation.
Holmes, by contrast, cared little for imposition and asked whenever he felt the need of me. He needed me for his pleasure, for the works of justice which were his posterity, and I answered every time. When he asked me to go to the Continent with him in that spring of 1891, it was understood that it might be the last case; that his career might end. He had, perhaps, even an inkling of how, for all he soothed me with a tale of prosperous retirement crowning his greatest success.
John continued to sip his whisky. He watched Sherlock: his posture, his movement. He remembered that evening at Baker Street. Sherlock had been a shockingly good teacher. Shocking because the discretion required to teach ran counter to his personality. John wondered if he could remember a time when Sherlock had been as patient as he was taking him through the steps that night.
The detective was an enigma far too difficult for John to solve. He claimed to view his body merely as ‘transport,’ and displayed annoyance about having to attend to any of its needs—food and sleep being the most pressing John had to fight for in order to prevent Sherlock from collapsing (as he’d done on one or two occasions before John had gotten better at surreptitiously monitoring both). Yet there was no one who could attest to the time and money Sherlock spent on his appearance better than John. For all he seemed to neglect his body, he spent an inordinate amount of time maintaining its attractiveness. Their bathroom was filled with expensive shampoos and soaps and styling products. One look at his wardrobe would be enough to know the skew of its fashion to comfort ratio.
“Oh, deary I’m so happy you’re home safe and sound,” she said, giving John a tight hug. He realised with a start that he hadn’t seen her, or anyone except Sherlock, since he’d come home from the hospital. Was that Sherlock’s doing, he wondered, keeping people away until John felt better? There had been no clients, no Lestrade, no cases—as far as he knew Sherlock had never even left the flat until today.
Sherlock pointed to the suite on the top floor at the end of the building; large windows faced the avenue, the alley and the street behind. “That’s his flat there,” he said. He clapped his hands and whirled around to face John. “Ok,” he said. “I need you to shout at me.”
“I know,” he said tetchily. “I’m a doctor, remember? There’s nothing catastrophic bacteria can do just in the time it takes me to type up these notes.”
Sherlock took a fourth cigarette from the pack. They were good for brainwork. They were going to help him find a solution that would allow him to have what he wanted. There were so few things he wanted, and with cigarettes, cocaine, and heroin off the table, he needed something on the table. Preferably an army doctor, preferably shirtless— Sherlock fumbled trying to light the cigarette in his hand.
— And what if he did? Was John ready for that? For what that would mean? John felt his heartrate increase. He had started this, and he really
“It has nothing to do with ‘turning gay,’” she continued, anticipating his argument. “If you were attracted to him, it wouldn’t mean you suddenly like men when you never have. It would only mean you like
Alexa stood in front of John’s chair and reached out her hand. He took it uncertainly and allowed her to pull him to his feet. She gave him a coy smile before stepping forward.
There was a silence and John, who'd been staring at Sherlock, reminded himself to blink. The deductions went fast and John often found himself transfixed. It was genius, truly amazing and Sherlock had done it based only on his sense of smell.
“I told him to keep his pants on,” Sherlock said and John laughed harder, which seemed to make Sherlock laugh harder too. He felt lightheaded, and suddenly appreciated the supportive wall at his back.
Sherlock’s hands were on him in a flash. He grabbed John by the shoulders and shoved him back into a tree, pinning him there.
He leapt off the couch and the poem dropped to the floor. Sherlock would have left it there, but he hesitated, considering. He snatched the piece of paper up and jammed it into his pocket on his way out the door.
John’s eyes flicked over his ex-flatmate. He wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure about anything. He wanted to leave the steps and go off into the London night. With Sherlock there was no telling what could happen any time you walked out the door. He wanted to get his gun and jump into the cab and go wherever Sherlock would take him, even if it was just for chips, or cake (
Sherlock looked up at him. “You’re going that way.” He pointed to a fence John hadn’t noticed before. The gate was open and there was a narrow path through the grass leading out beyond the garden.
“Find anything interesting?” John asked evenly, careful not to further aggravate the world’s moodiest detective.
John had kicked the sheets off of his legs, lying on his back, upper body twisted in them. He moved again, violently tossing to his right, and flipping onto his back again.
"Do it and you'll be Pillock Holmes in the next five posts." He was failing miserably to sound stern. His sides hurt from laughing. His cheeks hurt from smiling.
John's dominant streak, which mostly lay dormant during their work together (asserting itself only when necessary—a few memorable occasions), but which Sherlock had observed in his interactions with women and sometimes in their own domestic life when they'd lived together ("Sherlock, you will put your dishes in the dishwasher, or I will put your mould cultures in the dishwasher"), was activated by being placed in the leading position. Instinctually he used the hand on Sherlock's back to gently pull him forward and push him back in a way Sherlock didn't have to instruct him to do.
One of Sherlock’s neighbours, high out of his mind, hadn’t minded (or possibly noticed) when Lestrade followed him into the building. He sprinted up the stairs. He pounded on the battered door of Sherlock’s flat and then had little trouble breaking open the rusty lock. He knew he’d have a difficult time explaining this if Sherlock was only out at the supermarket, but Lestrade walked further into the flat and Sherlock wasn’t out.
are you in my bedroom, and why am I not asleep?" His alarm was set for seven. He had to be at the surgery at eight. He was owed another hour of sleep.
In an instant he was able to clear the mess in mind palace. All damage repaired, everything put back into place: pristine. He could do it now because it was important now. He needed his brain in top form. He’d studied this poison and determined it to be irreversible. It was an impossible task and he would have to do it. There was no alternative. He
What had Sherlock’s expression been? Had he rolled his eyes? Been irritated? No, John didn’t think so. He’d been amused, hadn’t he? Trying to stifle a smile—
Not the other way around. Sherlock thought he could kiss him like that and then walk out without a word? Three days and no word?
“He has been instructed to kill you,” Moran explained. “You may fight to determine your own fate—for tonight at least.”
Mary opened her mouth to protest and then closed it again. It was no use. Looking at the insistence in John’s face—his mind entirely occupied by one track—she could see the truth. Sherlock would always be John’s priority. She and Sherlock had been the two people John loved most in the world, and now that she was out of the running it was only Sherlock. And, if she were being truly honest with herself, it had probably always only been Sherlock. John had only started up with her when he thought Sherlock was dead. And in those years everything John did—his actions, his words, his gestures, his abstracted expressions—everything was shot through with Sherlock’s memory. Even his proposal to her had referenced him: “
“I, erm, I saw how you killed Moran. They did a story on the telly. They don’t know who shot him, but obviously I do.”
John stilled and took a deep breath. His eyes flicked up and locked on Sherlock's. Sherlock's muscles tensed but he willed them to ease. He was role modelling, after all.
people a bit,” John said, figuring he could at least remind Sherlock there was such thing as a moral compass, even if neither of them found much cause to use it.
“He’ll need three times the dose of heroin you gave me.” It was a rough estimate, but Sherlock could size people pretty well.
John smiled to himself, wondering when he had become such a total nutter. It was probably the day he'd agreed to move in with Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock laughed and stopped and turned to face John. The cool night air intensified the heady rush coursing through him: endorphins flooding in the wake of adrenaline. God, he had almost shot the explosive vest, taking the building and everyone down in one rhapsodic wave of destruction. What fun. John’s flushed face mirrored Sherlock’s own high, and he wondered how he’d ever been satisfied doing this alone.
“No need, no need, I assure you. They are in the exact spot they ought to be. You lack only one more thing to bring the art of apiculture to perfection, or as near to it as this fleeting world can offer. Your reputation as a master of mysteries is evidently not confined to the realm of human error and wickedness.”
So, I married my lost heiress. Holmes cast his aspersions on that, and any, marriage, came to the wedding, threw rice with devastating accuracy and spent the reception competing with the two fresh-faced young constables who patrolled Baker Street to come up with the queerest crime they had each ever investigated. From their red faces I imagined he had trumped them with the story of Henry King, otherwise the Queen of Tarts, who was arrested and served two years' hard labour for offences committed at a pastry shop in Cock Lane whilst… well, I believe the Daily Telegraph carried an expurgated version.
Ah, there it is: that word. Love. I do not hear it a tenth so often as I write it nor even say it myself, for a certain party has an aversion to saying it aloud; he claimed once that it brought him out in a rash.  Yet if that is the price of being loved by Sherlock Holmes, I’d pay it with interest the rest of my life. Indeed, I sincerely hope I shall.
“I should think so. My uncle died barely four months after arriving in Calcutta. I’d have been very surprised to think that he had time to marry meanwhile.”
Back at Baker Street, after he had heard out my own astonishment at the bohemian style at Low Hall – I admit this took quite some time – I asked Holmes how it was that the appearance of a supposed owner of the property would answer all the ladies’ complaints. What of the constant intrusions into their privacy?
To Sherlock Holmes, nature is first and foremost a matter of science. He admires its works, but rarely glories in them. Instead he observes nature; he dissects it; he pins it to a card. For me, his humble companion John H. Watson, MD, it is a work of art.
We shared a brougham of the General's. Watson looked particularly handsome in a herringbone cutaway coat and grey flannels. What? If he can wax lyrical about the physical charms of other men in the pages of the Strand, surely I may do so concerning my own intimate friend in the privacy of a personal account, my sole confidant a surplus
Ordinarily, let us be clear, I have no particular objection to rut. But I do not care to break a promise.
"Tell me, Watson," asked Holmes, leaving off his manicure and lighting a cigarette, "what would you say are the essentials for a happy retirement?"
A kiss that would loosen my tongue, indeed it was. A kiss that tugged at my soul without grace or mercy, that twisted it free from all restraint until I was sucked under with the tide and the sea, the sea called me, took me breathless to a foreign, familiar shore.
We were back at Baker Street, toasting the conclusion of the case with as much fine brandy as would serve to dampen the call of 'Norbury'. It was not that I was ungrateful for the reminder – I was truly, infinitely obliged to him. Truth may be unwelcome but be truth nonetheless. For I had come to see, a realisation of months now, that it had all become a performance, a feat of keeping up appearances. That I was not the man I had been; that more and more I jumped from clue to conclusion without the chain of reasoning being tested for strength first. I was starting to resemble the work of fiction that Butterworth thought I was.
“Not at all. The dances have quite another purpose which I am not at liberty to disclose, having been sworn to secrecy. I daresay in a lifetime or so – a human lifetime, that is – observation will winkle it out. I know what they say about us because they speak to me. Or rather, we understand each other, for naturally they lack the vocal apparatus to reproduce human speech.”
Which was the great and which the little death? Mary followed Holmes within a year. Her loss broke me along the cracks opened at Reichenbach, rubbing salt into the stripes I had given myself for being only half a husband. When he unmasked in my consulting room, I fainted from the pain of that as much as from the joy of seeing his face, naked with apology and seduction both, asking me to come with him once more.
One corner of his mouth twitched but he carried on filing. I stood up and struck a courtroom attitude, one thumb tucked in my waistcoat pocket.
He twisted underneath me and was free, crouching on the Turkey rug, my wrist still trapped in his grip, the tip of the scalpel put to his throat as he stared, smiling like a tiger, up into my startled face.
We carried on that morning as two gentlemen of leisure, giving no thought to earning our daily bread but a considerable amount to hunting down a musical offering that Holmes had not already been to twice or dismissed once. When at last we sat in the Queen’s Hall in front of an orchestra about to introduce a minor Hungarian nobleman’s symphonic soul to the London public, my friend casually reached into his coat pocket. He started, then began to rifle through his clothing, muttering loud enough to turn outraged eyes on both of us.
“We do not forget, Mr Holmes, Doctor Watson. We shall never forget. And now, we regret that our presence is required elsewhere, for duty’s sake. Good evening to you.”
"No, sir, just here for you today. Although there’s an odd Sunday to make up here and there, when particular ships are in; I don’t mind it. S’not as if I have far to come." She tossed her head in the direction of the low windows at the top of the tall old building behind us and I understood that this place stood her for lodging as well as employment. "Mrs Gill’s a decent sort. We sticks together."
“Mr Holmes. Bohemian as ever. We have often thought that a relaxation in protocol must go along with your unique habits of thinking, and you have once more proved us correct.”
"She'd lost it all. Not a scrap left. She hadn't been ill, hadn't shorn it on that account, certainly hadn't…" she paused, but I well knew that Wandsworth would have had all her own hair soon after she got through the gate, and made money on it too. "Just fell out in a few days. Pretty thing, too."
It is a sign of the singular characteristics peculiar to my companion Sherlock Holmes that certain words, and even more so certain...mental scenes, have a power to interest him - to stimulate him - to an extraordinary pitch.
But he said no more, only disappeared to the great within, where cogs whirred in the intricate machine of deduction inside his head, gears cranking, connections being made. It seemed that like everyone else, I should have to wait for the striker on the bell to tell me the time, to tell past, present and future.
I had heard of him; my housekeeper swore by the parsonage honey as a cure-all for all kinds of minor ills. Nevertheless, I had come up to inspect the frames, and saw no reason to stop on his account. From a safe distance he watched me lift the top off the first hive and apply the smoker. A few bees, not sufficiently overcome, floated up in his direction and circled his head once or twice before drifting purposefully into the pasture beyond. I thought to bid him take care but his attention was no longer on me but on the insects, not out of any kind of fear but rather, intense concentration. He murmured something I couldn’t catch.
Dr Theophilus Simpson was a wiser man than that and called in the police. They proceeded to dim the lamps of wisdom and task him with wasting police time. Thus it was that next morning, on a baking hot Friday in June, he sought a second opinion in the sitting room at Baker Street.
“You respected Miss Emily Davies a great deal, but did not love her, spent two years sharing her roof but left for lack of encouragement rather than funds. Your father, I think, needed you at home. You study the classics because you wish to improve your mind, but science has your heart.”
"Hum. Just as well," he said to himself and returned the key to Maisie with thanks again. "Not in fact at work I hope, Maisie?"
I was not entirely sure this made rational sense, although I was entirely sure I should not say so.  He was as entitled as anyone (nay, perhaps more) to make a decision merely because he wanted to.  And now we were drawing up beside the familiar front door.
I confess it was a low trick, but I was working from instinct and the peculiar urgency of acute embarrassment.  I brushed the back of his calf with my ankle. The chairs were so close-set that no-one else could have seen it, and only we two knew what it meant in any case. It was our signal – commonplace, perhaps, but Holmes’ public distaste and his private cravings have rarely matched. A signal that, whatever else we were doing at the time, by the end of the day I desired – nay, expected – to occupy the side of Holmes’ bed next to the wall, wrapped close in his long arms and legs, our breaths calming together into satisfied harmony.
Back, as always, to business. What Watson calls my intuition and I, my instinct – dictionary quibbling over the same faculty, a measureless sea across which the boat of deduction strikes out for land – broke over the shore of my brain with a whisper:
“Not at all. Yet you do wish this miracle of the clamp to take place elsewhere than on your own property.”
“Tsk, Watson. Attend to the precision of my terms. I did not say you were. I asked if you had *taken* my razor. Theft is but one explanation. Borrowing is the most obvious alternative, but one must never simply assume intent.”
At the last word, he gripped the back of his chair with such strength he looked to break it and turned to me with a look of pure hatred - for he knew I was not his ally and that somehow I had guessed his secret. Those whom the world calls perverted must either bend under its shaming power or rage against it.
We settled in each others’ arms. Half the night at least we could linger there, before the world and its laws had their way and we must part, that the tyranny of ‘decency’ might have its sway.
To be faced with a shop window full of hair when ones hairbrush is in a similar state is a lesson in the ruthlessness of nature and the determination of society to cling to pretence in the face of that imperative (the parallel to my other problem is, I trust, not difficult to appreciate). Yet there it was, a herd of pretence – a flock of artifice: bundles and locks of luxuriant tresses in shades and shapes both found in the wild and shaped by the hand of man – or in this case, woman. We were set down in a side street and let in through a workshop door. Half a dozen bent backs greeted us; the workers underneath the wide windows turned their pieces this way and that, threading and stitching.
Tender, sweet and tipsy, he stumbled with me to the bed, shedding half his clothes on the floor, tangling in and between the sheets and around and above me, by turns covering me and baring himself. I stilled his hand at his trouser buttons.
The bed was gone, the spring mattress, the roof and walls with them, the only places on earth that existed were the two where our bodies joined, where I took him in, working on him and being worked, mouth filled with his heat, cock full to bursting from the pressure inside me of his busy fingers finding the same spot again and again, arched between two points electric and earthed, on fire from the charge running through me.
Holmes craned his long neck to the corner of the big room, acres of drying sheets festooned from lines crisscrossing every spare space. A youth with flaming carrot coloured hair and an equally carroty crop of freckles on every part of him exposed above the collar and past the ends of his rolled-up shirtsleeves wove between them like a midshipman dodging the boom,  a great white bundle of more sheets (dry and folded) balanced on his head. He seemed oddly familiar.
“Spot of plantarfascial strain. The only cure is rest.  Best lie up here for a bit, old man. I’ll ring for tea.”
I shook myself. Familiarity: that was the key. Red hair, Red-Headed League, Red Circle… No, beyond mere word association. The reader will surely sympathise with the plight of a man with a memory that just refuses to surface, a word poised on the tip of one’s tongue. The harder one pursues, the more it makes for cover. Not unlike my friend, I thought, as all at once I noticed he too had eluded me and was busy wherever he was, whatever he was busy about. A minute or so later he reappeared, paid Clark his account in coin and saluted him as we left the premises.
"Fine. But don't come back here with Risk or some bollocks. Pick something appropriate for our… current mental… functioning…" Words were so funny. John's face hurt from laughing. They'd been laughing all night. Mood-elevator drugs were good for mood elevating.
John grinned despite his exhaustion. He was rarely able to surprise Sherlock and he had to appreciate the moment. He dropped his bags beside his armchair and flopped down into the seat. He drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair and looked curiously up at Sherlock. “Are you all right?”
Sherlock shrugged. “Suit yourself. Just remember our dear landlady has recently learned how to use the camera function on her phone.”
Of course John was aware of the probability that Sherlock was simply telling him what he wanted to hear so that John would let him up, but then John also knew he had to trust him. Nothing would work between them if he didn’t trust Sherlock. So, despite the number of times Sherlock had lied to him, tricked him, drugged him, etc. he knew that one more time, as always, he would have to accept Sherlock’s words unquestioningly. He had to believe in the core of himself, which was forever believing in Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock felt John’s eyes on his fingers as he disinfected the cut and wrapped gauze around it. It was deeper than it had originally looked through the tear in John’s sleeve. John murmured some instructions about fastening the gauze and put his hand to it when Sherlock finished and stepped back.
John unstuck his tongue from the roof of his mouth and peeled his eyes open. His head throbbed in protest at the influx of light and it was more than a few moments before he understood that he was in Sherlock Holmes’ bed.
When he found himself half-sitting on the edge of the kitchen table John pulled back and Sherlock's eyes fluttered open. John was looking at him with an expression that made Sherlock’s breath hitch. It was predatory. He could feel the intensity of John’s want electrifying the air between them.
“She’s smart. She knew what I was going to do,” Sherlock mused as they walked. “I didn’t expect her to kiss you though. She added a bit of drama to the scene.”
The boy forced him roughly down into the chair and used a zip-tie to lock the handcuffs to the back of it. He stepped back when he was finished.
distress his brain might use it as a defence mechanism—an attempt to comfort the way his nanny used it to comfort him as a child.”
Sherlock swallowed, shutting his eyes. Ah yes, the reason his desk was currently underwater in his study and there were rapids in the hallways. John. The inopportune, heart-quickening aesthetics of John in the dark of the room, the soft glow of streetlamps, the sturdy lines of torso beneath light t-shirt, the smooth planes of his face.
“Yes. She’s apparently well known in the vicinity. Her name is Annie Chapman or Annie Siffey — most people know her as Chapman. ‘Dark Annie,’ they called her. As you know, it’s not unusual for this class of woman to be known by two or even more surnames: They often adopt the name of whatever bloke they happen to be living with at any given moment. At this particular moment Dark Annie was living without a man, and she had no permanent address, but she usually dossed down right here in number 29.”
Captain Mycroft, however—twelve years old at the time and Shezza’s most formidable enemy—was prepared for this, sometimes engaging in a bit of swordplay (stealing the plastic sword from Redbeard’s collar) if he was feeling indulgent. He was already part of the fencing club at his school and he corrected Sherlock’s posture, teaching him about lunges and parries.
“He’s an assassin,” Mycroft was saying. “He had a successful career being paid to kill various criminals and gang leaders by various criminals and gang leaders.”
Sherlock looked up at John, who seemed to be having trouble maintaining eye contact. "I assume you haven't eaten today," he said. He was right. "And I know you didn't eat yesterday."
“As soon as it stops suiting my purposes so nicely,” Sherlock said, moving from where he was leaning on the table to drop down into his chair across from John. “I would ask you to have a seat, but you’re clearly just on your way out.”
Sherlock Holmes was in trouble. And not the fun kind either. He paced the living room of 221B Baker Street with his hands clasped behind his back, occasionally throwing dirty looks at his laptop. Normally he liked trouble, sought it out even. It thrilled him to push his luck to the last, relying on the speed of his calculations under pressure... or sometimes relying on John to intervene and shoot someone.
John was Sherlock’s biggest weakness, according to the criminal world. And they were right. They’d confirmed it more than once with Semtex and American agents with guns and fire. They were right.
He lying on the floor, on his side, thank god—he must have known to roll himself while he was still conscious. Vomit on the floor, on his jogging bottoms, his t-shirt soaked through with sweat. Overdose. Lestrade was dialling the ambulance as he fell to his knees to check the boy’s vital signs. The pulse was faint but blessedly present.
There would be no mind games. He wasn’t Sherlock and Moran was no Moriarty. While a consulting detective and a consulting criminal might die a thousand deaths, he and Moran could each die once. They were two ordinary men. One real death each. The fate of all ordinary people.
With some resignation John took the detective’s (for once ungloved) hand, feeling the warmth of his skin tingle up his arm. When he got to his feet he felt incredibly light. His skin was humming, nerves seeming to respond in double to any contact. As a doctor, John did not condone the use of recreational drugs; however, he had to admit that the current sensation was not unpleasant. His hand felt cold when Sherlock let it go.
“He was arrested ten years ago in connection with a case Sherlock was able to assist Scotland Yard with. Reeves wasn’t the man they were looking for, more like a smaller fish caught in the net with the larger one. He was sentenced to life in prison but it appears an interested party has been able to negotiate parole for him.”
“Yes, I remember the name because I felt it was ironic: ‘Neighbourly Movers.’ I thought it wasn’t very ‘neighbourly’ to be making a racket at midnight. Are you going to fine the people who live there?”
Sherlock turned his head fully this time when he said, “Based on the timing of the texts you sent me yesterday I deduced it was you who… brought me here last night.”
With considerable effort Sherlock dragged his attention back to his laptop. Using Mycroft’s money to buy the chemicals had solved this particular problem, but Mycroft—or more accurately Mycroft’s minions—would be examining his accounts at any moment, and he expected he would be in for a lecture. Sometimes he wished Mycroft were more old-fashioned. Sherlock could tolerate most traditional forms of torture better than he could withstand a lecture about responsibility from his brother.
Lestrade had come through with the promised grave exhumations. Sherlock had been at the morgue all day overseeing the autopsies and testing blood samples.
“The men who died were chosen for the experiment because they were single,” Sherlock continued, evidently eager to get back to his successful unravelling of the mystery. “The killer didn’t plan on Brandon kissing someone directly after walking out of the club.”
Mycroft sighed. “Oh Sherlock, such drama. Has it even crossed your mind that I have your best interests at heart?”
Sherlock crossed the room in a few strides and stopped directly in front of John, towering over him and glaring. Sherlock, John had understood from the day they’d met, had little concept of personal space and often stood inappropriately close for an Englishman. But John, used to this, met Sherlock’s gaze easily and held his ground.
Out in the living room John quickly scribbled Sherlock a prescription for oxycodone. He was not at all enthusiastic about giving his ex-addict (currently high) flatmate prescription-strength painkillers, but he knew that as soon as the heroin wore off his neck was going to hurt like hell. He would need these, there was no question.
“She was unlucky,” Sherlock said. “It seems likely that she was chosen randomly for an experiment to test the poison. They might have killed her after to cover up the evidence.”
Then there were voices. Bizarrely, Mycroft’s was first. Something about an injection. Murmuring of other voices—he couldn’t hear them. Only Mycroft. He caught enough words to understand he was in a hospital. Coma, it seemed. And then there was Molly’s voice. She was crying. And then Mary’s, telling him everything would be ok. But where was Sherlock?
to John, the way it had almost happened today… Sherlock’s eyes flicked down at the bandage and he found he didn’t have the words to finish the thought.
The warmth of Sherlock’s body spread through John’s limbs, thawing his numb skin. He felt his nerves prickling like pins and needles, like waking up. He held tightly to Sherlock as the fog dissipated and the garden began to vanish. He would have been falling, he knew, if it weren’t for the weight of Sherlock in his arms, anchoring him while the chaos of the in-between rushed around them.
“All right, Sherlock, I don’t care,” John said, feeling resignation sweep through him as he suddenly became aware of how tired he was.
John, he knew, would attribute this behaviour to guilt—Sherlock being the indirect cause of the injury. It wouldn’t be the first time John was wrong.
John was kissing him slowly, deeply, intensely, and Sherlock felt warmth spreading from his core out through the rest of his body. He held the back of John’s head. His hair was cold and damp from the shower: a pleasing contrast to the heat of his skin. He wrapped his arm around John’s back, feeling the energy in the tension of his muscles, smooth in their movement beneath his hand.
He looked over at the detective and was dismayed to see The Look on his face. The ‘we both know what’s going on here’ look. It was John's more diplomatic (and shorter) name for the ‘I’m very annoying (with my designer shoes and my poncey, curly hair), and I’m about to get us both into really deep shit’ look.
“I can read your thoughts before you’ve even entered the flat by your tread on the stairs. Do you think I don’t know when you lie?”
He hadn’t come to any solution. There was a reason he kept these Feelings locked away. They were too dangerous. His brain was a delicate instrument, finely tuned to excel at its craft above and beyond all limits of expectation. He’d made the choice to sacrifice the emotion that would clutter it, slow it down, long ago.
They won by a significant margin and it wasn’t until after the necessary handshakes and polite refusals to join his teammates at the pub, and less polite refusals to introduce them to ‘his friend,’ that John turned to look back at Sherlock. He was half-surprised to see him still standing there. His eyes were fixed on John where he stood in the centre of the field and the stare was piercing enough, even from a distance, that John had to look away.
The consulting criminal removed the snorkel piece of the mask from his mouth. He grinned. “Come on in, Sherlock. The water’s fine.”
“We have a bet going that you’ll kill yourself—finish what you started up on the roof of Barts. I think you will. Because you’ll have to watch John die knowing you weren’t smart enough to save him. I think that’s worth killing yourself over, don’t you?”
Sherlock grinned. “So he’ll have a story to tell. I'm sure we did him a favour. This may be the one decent story he has in the whole of his unremarkably dull life.”
No, this card problem more likely had to do with Sherlock’s inability to recall collecting payment from any of his clients recently—he had just as much difficulty remembering trifling facts as he did unpleasant ones—and if John had done it the cheques must be somewhere in one of these piles that were taking up his worktop space. The thought of rifling through all the papers in 221B to find some old cheques was appalling enough that Sherlock shuddered.
The reasoning was elementary. Even if Mycroft had never said anything, Sherlock would have come to the same conclusion. He didn’t like people and they didn’t like him. As he grew up it was clear there was no one worth his time, let alone any kind of risky emotional investment. It was obvious. He hadn’t needed Mycroft to tell him that. He would have put the pieces together on his own.
Greg Lestrade was standing in their living room and he was not at all happy. Sherlock was pinning pictures to the wall, looking very annoyed about being interrupted. John was sitting at the table with his cheek resting on his fist, content to be a witness rather than a participant in this particular conversation.
by Jane Austen. If he had ever known who Jane Austen was he must have deleted it. But unless Emma was a dictator in an oil-rich country he supposed his brother wouldn’t have any interest in the material.
But more often lately his dreams found him in Magnussen’s office, watching Mary smirking and pulling the trigger and blood staining Sherlock’s shirt as he fell backward, fell through the floor, fell away where John couldn’t follow him, couldn’t save him...
He was tall, but not so tall as I, and he shrank further when we faced him as a pair, protesting that he had not the least idea what I was talking about but that he was a busy man, as he was sure were we, and if there was a purpose to our visit we had better state it.
“That’s it, John, come darling, come to me, come for me, come quick or come slow, come how you like but do it, do it for me, I want it, I want you, only you, you know it, that’s it, John…”
"Here." He had spotted it first. "Catherine Anne Pearsall. Condition:  spinster. Age 26; profession of father, Solicitor. Married at The Union Chapel, Islington on the 14th of May. Groom - William Henry Brace, bachelor. Age 40. Occupation, Solicitor."
Holmes put down his cup and saucer without reply and commenced to shape his nails, the file’s ivory handle sweeping briskly back and forth as if it were his violin bow sketching a difficult cadenza. He gave it that steady concentration which suggested his real attention was quite elsewhere.
She smiled as she placed it in front of her chief tenant with all her usual care. Then she promptly astonished us both by pulling up a chair and sitting down.
Foote. Formerly master at Durham School. Bane of my boyhood. Excellent teacher of a subject I loathed. Athletic, handsome, charming. Cutting, cruel, a roaring snob. It did not do to come from a modest background, nor to disdain the classics, if one wanted his approval. I failed on both counts.
He nodded. A flush had crept up from the line of his collar to both cheeks. It made him look…not younger, but more vital, more a man who might still have those animal instincts, might flush with passion as much as from modesty. What might he look like in his crisis, spread out supine under me, shaking, panting, stark naked; or half-dressed from urgency, shirt open and missing buttons, splayed against the wall as I sucked him off like a powdered Piccadilly renter?
“All in good time. We must leave. Be so good as to find a carter to take us back to the station, and pay the innkeeper’s bill.”
“For two days I have practised that character in spare moments, and here you are not taken in for more than a minute. It is as well I am a moderately successful criminal agent: evidently, I should not make a career upon the stage.”
I showed him how, coming behind him and rubbing my chest against his back, holding him to me by the waist, resting my cheek against one fine-boned shoulder blade, bending to blow soft breaths up his spine from the cleft in his muscular arse to the nape of his long neck.
Tea, Mrs Hudson’s finest seedcake and good, hot buttered toast were laid on for us by the maid. I indulged, one ear cocked, as Holmes ventured downstairs. Judging by the sound of the resulting explosion, I had the best of it on two counts.
"It is the custom of ladies," she continued, "to supplement what nature has given them with sundry switches, rats, nets, baskets and braids – made from the shorn hair of other women – cut and plaited, dyed, bleached, curled, pinned and mounted…"
"Very well. Lay on, then." All the fight went out of him in a puff, as man in the ring folds at a lucky blow to the solar plexus.
I wanted to make some joke about being a doctor - and an officer - not a batman, but as I tugged the stocking over the high arch of his left foot he hissed and bared his teeth. I rotated the ankle joint with care. Nothing amiss there. Likewise no bruising at the toes, no crushing. The sole, however, proved tender to the touch and unyielding of movement.  Rigging up a cold compress was the work of a moment and I found I had not altogether lost my dressing skills as I wound the linen bandage gently snug.
We reached the main gate of the ‘Zoo’ and with scarcely a pause, Holmes slipped from beneath his coat and flourished before the gatekeeper’s nose a pair of Fellow’s admission tickets, signed by no less a personage than Alfred Russel Wallace, OM, FRS, etc, etc.
“I find that, like Miss Anne Heacham, I do not care for novels,” he said, at long last. “Nor, for that matter, shorter fiction. Too little unvarnished truth; too much playing to the crowd.”
A brace of uniformed policemen looked at me sideways as they emerged from the Yard, putting on their helmets. One of them winked at me. He had red hair.
Sherlock Holmes loves an audience. I know it. My readers know it. Scotland Yard definitely knows it. It came to pass the next morning that we discovered someone else in the household with a flair for staging. I called on ‘downstairs’ to ask when breakfast might be served, only to find the kitchen door firmly shut against me.
"Simple? No. Likely – yes, very likely indeed. So likely I have already staked my reputation on it."
Attack as my defence, with my tongue teasing his bottom lip and a hard, squeezed handful of buttock making him start, he faltered and let go for the barest instant. In the next, I had rolled on top of him, pinning arms and legs spread-eagled, ruddy against white linens, struggling without conviction against my greater strength.
Yet woe betide the man who gives so much as a shadow of a hint that his tastes may stretch further, that his attention can be captured by a delicate female ankle… but by a broad set of male shoulders equally. Or, in one case, a narrow set of them. By a brilliant mind and a sudden, violent laugh; by a temper like a flame and a heart that burns for justice - heedless, heartless ‘society’ be damned.
“Ha!” he cried at last, when we had nearly recovered ourselves. “I have just now remembered the ending to the tale of a waiter named Banks and a certain tongue-tripped luminary of New College, Oxford.”
He sat down with a bump. The folds of mouse-coloured silk parted around his upright prick and we both heard its summons rise clear above the murmur of good manners.
He should not have been who he is, otherwise. I should not have been who I am if I did not know how much he was offering, and what it cost him to do it, to speak of it at all. That precious gift of understanding, and the promise to entertain more, I accepted with a full heart. He is not a calculating machine, whatever Doyle may say. That is a reputation written on sand, and I knew that the tide would come in. As, in the fullness of time, it did.
“Dear Doctor Watson. How often at Balmoral have we read your thrilling stories aloud around the fire on a cold winter’s evening. Such a comfort to know our realm has such a clever, stout defender of the law, and a companion so loyal. The two of you set an example, throughout the Empire, of English manliness and true, loving friendship.”
Now he was worrying me.  On the journey back he was quiet but keen-eyed, crouching forward in his seat and turning his head this way and that, searching the streets about us. He had shed the breezy confidence of the morning. I tried to jolly him, saying that he knew better by now than to expect me to match him. I even dared a hand on his knee, under the blanket. It never failed to make him smile – sun from shadow.
He waved a hand carelessly. "Oh, as to that, certainly. The occasion, though – the occasion. Ah, Watson, there I confess myself a coward.  Come, let’s go h- back to Baker Street." He started up the street, scanning for an approaching cab.
Holmes had arrived before us, having lost both dressing gown and erection, wearing a velvet smoking jacket I had given him the Christmas before. He stood by the mantelpiece, plainly panting for tobacco but unable to indulge. I felt a similar, though not identical, deprivation.
He palmed my rising cock, dark head thrown back, planting his feet astride so as not to fall to his knees with the power of it.
I felt far too sweaty and rumpled to be presentable, however ‘rational’ the company, but if she noticed (and she did) Miss Anne forgave me. Holmes had done it again – turned a reserved and doubtful client into a loyal acolyte, quite prepared to accept that all would be well, now he had attended to the problem. She did not gush, of course, did not fawn. It was not her nature. Yet she was in such peace of mind that not only did she welcome us at her table, we were given the rare privilege of an introduction to Miss Emma.
, was proof only of how dangerous sentiment was. For it was surely no more than sentiment – weak, useless, corrupting – that kept me returning to the subject of John H. Watson, MD. That tempted me to wire and ask him to visit, instead of waiting for him to write to me. That asked whether, in his new life, he still gave an un-reminded thought to a retired detective beyond the adventures we once shared.
“Then I should say we need a courtroom. Not there, though. My room, upstairs. I don’t fancy your collection of felons as the public gallery.”
We strolled arm in arm, two gentlemen. In my head, we strolled hand in hand, two criminals. Arm, hand, what difference? We were two yet one, had been from the first. What law can there be against such? One may as well command water not to flow. The true obstacle was my own cowardice.
Caught a little off balance, he stumbled backwards, righted himself against the chemical table and started to laugh even as he cradled his jaw and inspected his fingers for blood.
"You have set them right too: the young people. Set them up in their positions through your contacts and hiding places."
As I fought to keep the scrap of paper on my knee from being whipped out of my hands by the March winds, and scribbled down the impressions which appear, with a little polish, at the start of this tale, the road began to follow the line of a Carr-stone estate wall at least seven feet high. After a few hundred yards of this, we turned suddenly sharp right, through a pair of ancient gates down an avenue of limes.
“No, Watson. John. I want…Pain and pleasure run along the same courses. ‘Nervous arrangements’ have it so, do they not?”
I have set pen to paper myself to repay Watson in kind - created a magician's box of mirrors to make him disappear from my own story at the point he, in fact, became its major theme. The last London case – the correspondence club seem preoccupied with dates, a futile wish for precision that will probably drive them all stark mad in the end – was neither the colourman nor the soldier, and Watson never did 'desert me for a wife'. I think he would be as like to jump off Westminster Bridge and fly as desert me - one of many honours I do not deserve.
I did as he bid and palmed my own prick roughly as he took his pleasure, his pleasure that gave me so much mine that it took only a score of strokes to bring me off too. Climax crushed me against his groin, though I was braced on both arms against the frame of the furniture, his hands a vice in my hair. There was no breaking free and no wish for freedom, only his ending. It so came swiftly on, that when I drank his seed it was as much from surprise as from desire.
I should soon have run out of the words he craved had he not turned and let me hold him, for then the words came easy, then he stripped me to my skin and took me to my bed and still he asked me, asked for word and deed both.
I may say it here, in a story that shall never cross an editor’s desk nor see a letterpress. I may say that I loved him. That I love him still, that I live and will die loving him – as friend, as master, as more. As everything, body and soul.
“I’m afraid you’ll have to find a carrier,” I said, wondering what exotic quest had brought him to the middle of the English countryside. “It’s nearly three miles, if you mean Low Hall.”
We were not so frequently there as the reader might think: Holmes avoided the physical machinery of the law whenever he was able.  He preferred its agents to come to him, or to meet them at the scene of crime, which for him was as good as his own hearth. Nor did he very often attend court – preferring to stay at arms’ length from official justice.
We stood at a sloping reading-stand, heads close together, sharing breathspace, scanning the pages of the Registry of Marriages for the previous quarter.
He swept onto the chair opposite her and leaned in, piercing her with one of his intense, scrutinising stares. If she flinched, and strong men had done so before her, there was no outward sign.
Accurate, though unnecessarily puckish. He reminded me of someone whom I shall not name, for the reader can easily guess, and the reminder stung. It had been several months since I had laid eyes on my friend. I remarked that I supposed the bees would vote with their feet, or at any rate their wings, if the accommodations were not to their liking. He hesitated, pressed both hands to his mouth – as he might have held his nose before jumping into a lake – and took his chance.
Flipping his dressing gown back as dramatically as one can manoeuvre a dressing gown, Sherlock sat down in front of his laptop and retried the purchase, this time using Mycroft’s credit card information. It worked.
He looked over and was surprised to see Sherlock glance at him with what almost looked like uncertainty. But it was gone from his face almost as soon as he’d seen it.
John thought about this. “Or it means he’s a person, and people—normal people who don’t have any detail-awareness superpowers—sometimes mistake navy socks for black ones. Especially blokes.” John was thinking about the number of occasions he’d done this himself. He resisted the urge to lift his trouser legs to check if he’d done it today.
Well, Sherlock hadn’t said a word about it. And of course John didn’t ask. But Sherlock was glaring at him now. Did that mean—had he not slept with Janine at all? Had he never slept with anyone, ever? Was this the one thing Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t do for a case?
He walked around to the other side of the bed, shrugging off his jacket and pulling the dog tags over his head. He sat down on the edge of the bed, undoing his boots, slightly amazed to think the night had started off as innocuously as dressing up to go to a work party. But that was life with Sherlock.
“There is no reason.” She knelt down in front of Sherlock, pushing her hands up his thighs and spreading his legs. “She was an angel. It’s true some clients become angry, or jealous, but we have good security.”
The detective’s expression was blank, but John knew Sherlock was reading his mind and correcting him, the same way he’d done on the couch just a few nights ago:
No, he belonged on the battlefield and he was content to die there. He wasn’t afraid. The needle in his vein now wasn’t about where he was going. It was about who he was leaving behind. Any consideration of
Sherlock could not believe he was going to die surrounded by these guys. On the other hand, if he had to guess who Moriarty would choose to be part of his London gang… Insanity loves company.
, how had they ended up like this? Granted he had been used to sleeping with another person for the majority of the past three years and he supposed he might have the unconscious muscle memory to cuddle up to a body next to him, but
Lestrade remembered the junkie kid he’d met all those years ago: wild and haunted, an unmistakable aura of death around him. Lestrade would have guessed the unfortunate boy wouldn’t make it to twenty-five. And how old was Sherlock now? Thirty-two?
“I need to go out for a minute,” he said, voice low. Sherlock’s eyes were closed. He didn’t respond. “I’ll get Mrs. Hudson to sit in the living room if you need anything. I’ll be right back. Ok? Sherlock?"
“But you were so happy! It was such a beautiful wedding,” Mrs. Hudson said tearfully. “What happened? Do you want to talk about it? You can tell me everything. You must want to talk to someone about it.”
John turned his attention out the window. For someone so averse to intimacy (and people in general), Sherlock really didn’t mind being touched. Or at least being touched by John. It was one of the many mistakes he had made in understanding Sherlock over the years, and lately he was being corrected about it quite often. Of course he and Sherlock had been in close spaces before, but these days they seemed to end up in contact more than ever. Maybe he was being overly sensitive, but it was hard not to think about it now with the detective was sprawled over him. And wasn’t it just the other morning they had woken up quite literally in each other’s arms?
He smiled in disbelief. Sherlock knew his measurements. John had never told him. He’d gone up and down in weight in the last two years, but the suit was precise. John supposed that’s what you get when you live with a snobbishly fashionable consulting detective.
Low blood pressure. The poison. Moran’s poison. The one he had spent the past week studying and hadn’t noticed the symptoms being displayed in his own flat.
Sherlock smirked, “I don’t know much about the world of prostitution, but I’m sure they’ve seen weirder.”
“No, Sherlock. Between years in prison and six months in the field we both know which is the kinder option for you.”
“Gallagher!” he called to one of the two police officers who were in conversation by the barricade tape. “Get Mr. Holmes here the file on Rodgers,” he said as the officer approached.
Molly watched him with wide eyes. He was mad, absolutely mad. He wasn’t speaking English anymore. He was swaying on his feet. He could collapse any minute.
John shoved his hands back into his hair. He breathed, trying to ground himself as the oppressive fog threatened to envelop him. There was a light wind rippling the grass beneath his knees. He couldn’t feel it. He couldn’t feel anything. He wasn’t real; he was a shadow of a dream. There was nothing to keep the fog from flowing through him, erasing him. He was numb. He needed something to stabilise him, something that could prove he had solid form: mass and weight—something that could keep him whole even as his skin turned translucent and felt himself disappearing, becoming nothing more than the fog itself.
and you can’t think of anything to do with your time? Why don’t you go out and win the Nobel Prize, or break the boundaries of human knowledge with string theory? I don’t know; why don’t you invent a bloody cure for cancer? There must be a better use of your talents than lying around here and whinging at me all the time. …You total prat,” he added for emphasis.
“This coming from the man who grows mould experiments in the kitchen sink,” John said, grabbing a clean t-shirt and his pyjama trousers.
in his entire life he’d never had a kiss like that (only kissing Sherlock the other day in the kitchen could rival it). He should have known tapping into an emotional side of Sherlock would be as explosive and dangerous as any other side.
The heavy thudding of some kind of dubstep or drum and bass or whatever the kids were calling it these days preceded their entry into the building.
It was a shame Tweedledum had already aligned himself with Moran. Sherlock rather liked his conversational skills.
John swallowed. Was this it? Was he finally getting an answer to what had been one of the most mysterious facets of Sherlock Holmes? John knew that in some ways it was none of his business, but in other ways he was fantastically fucking
John was listening with rapt attention. This was more about Sherlock’s childhood than he’d ever heard.
But Sherlock wasn’t paying attention. A phone had materialised in the hand that wasn’t gripping John’s. “Excellent!” he shouted looking at the screen. And he started laughing.
“It’s not impossible,” Harry repeated, bringing John’s attention back. “Look, you can bugger off and forget I said anything if you’re positive you could never love him. But I’ve read your blog, John, and the way you write about him, the way you describe him—I  just don’t want you to be a dickhead and automatically rule out the possibility just because you believe ‘straight’ is some kind of authoritative, prison cell of a concept. I have friends from all points on the spectrum, and I’ve had friends who’ve made themselves miserable over these stupid labels. Stupid words. I thought I could save you both time and pain by telling you what it takes a lot of dumb twats years to figure out: Don’t let a word prevent you from doing whatever the hell you want. You shouldn’t give a fuck about what label it would fall under, or what anyone else would think. You’re a free adult. Why should you care if some random wankers can’t categorise you into their simplistic little thought boxes? You don’t owe anyone anything, and it’s none of
Was there a word to describe Sherlock Holmes standing on a corner in slanted streetlight? Both ‘hero’ and ‘villain’ vied for the spot but neither fit. He looked like something from out of John’s dream, was what it was. One of those dreams when John had woken up in Mary’s bed panting, as though he’d been running through London with Sherlock all night, the detective’s face lingering before him as the sunlight of reality swept the dream away. The scene was breathtaking in its own right—it always had been, each night-time hunt when John glanced over at the detective and saw the play of gold light and shadow across Sherlock’s features—something he'd spent two years thinking he'd lost forever. It was here, now, overwhelmingly close, almost painfully real, and John found the words blurring in his mind as he took in the heat of Sherlock's eyes on him and the arrogant authority of his stance.
Of course John’s craving for dangerous situations would spill over into a desire for dangerous people. Sherlock had seen both on his initial read of Dr. Watson.
“Oh, erm, hello, my name is Molly Hooper. I work with Sherlock, er, sometimes. I work in the morgue at Barts.”
“It’s not Sherlock’s fault. The situation is what it is. You both care for John. Tough tits. You’re going to have to find a way to deal with it that doesn’t involve killing each other.”
“Nightmare,” John said curtly. He flicked his eyes up at Sherlock for a fraction of a second before looking back down at his sheets. Embarrassed. “Sorry if I woke you.”
Sherlock turned back to look at the door he had just come through. He was neither gratified nor surprised to see a sniper, gun drawn and ready, now filling the opening.
But of course John would see Sherlock’s call from the rooftop of Barts as a mirror of his own distress when they’d met in the lab. Except Sherlock had saved John and John hadn’t saved Sherlock. He couldn’t have. There was nothing he could have said. There was nothing he could have done. It was rigged. Sherlock was always going to jump. He was always going to die. John’s part in it had only been for show.
