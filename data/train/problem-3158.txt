If I haven't said so before, I'm always grateful for each and every reader I have and for any comments you care to bestow upon me.  It makes me happier than you know.
Sam, naturally, remembers none of this but the aftermath brought him his family and chronic Omega Drop Syndrome (ODS). The condition leaves Sam prone to severe emotional and physical collapses that can be life-threatening if left unchecked.  Meds help but Sam is forever going to need an anchor.  That’s been Dean or his parents, mostly Dean, his whole life. Even when Dean left home, he was faithful with letters and calls.  And the odd mixtape even though Sam tried to tell him no one actually uses cassettes anymore. He smiles at the memory of his brother’s affronted face that day. He blows out a breath.
For making that stupid deal in the first place. But he couldn't really stay mad at him, he never could.
He looks back up at them, tears falling down his cheeks to mingle with the rain steadily pouring down on him. Cas is smiling brightly, their eyes light up and they close the remaining space between them.
Hope you all enjoy this one!!
Dean is still half on Cas' lap, but he couldn't care less right now.
, that annoyed
He was also done with getting drunk every other night and feeling sorry for himself. He supposes Cas had something to do with all his sudden 'love yourself' philosophies.
Everyone is back and Chuck is gone, and hey Jack's God now.
At 7pm he checks out and continues on the road to California. With working the job he has and previous experience hunting, he doesn't need much sleep to be fully functioning for more than 24 hours.
Yeah okay, Dean's turned sappy, but after all the crap he's been through, he's entitled.
All he needs to do now is get up the guts, pull through and actually say what he's been wanting to say for years.
When the water is half gone and the sleeping pill swallowed, Sam helps him to lie down on the bed. “It’s not memory foam, but it’s better than nothing. I’ll clean your room—”
“Fuck.” Dean turns from Castiel, closing his eyes tight. “How long? How long have you know this was happening?”
, not meeting his eyes. “It would, perhaps, be better to show you. Your bedroom would be ideal. It's longer than mine, more room to spread out.”
Before he even thinks about it, his hand is on Cas’s back. One finger runs lightly along…
Dean reaches out automatically to grab onto Cas’s bicep, helping to steady him. His other hand rests, without thinking, on the back of Cas’s head, his thumb stroking the small hairs there.
It’s too damaged. There’s nothing he can do.
Out of habit Dean turns his head to the side when he vomits. It would’ve grossed Lucifer out at least a little bit had he let the bile out on his shoes, but this is Cas, Cas is still in there, and it’s ingrained in his very being that he can’t do anything to hurt Cas.
Dean. You have to do it now, or else—”
It’s true and he knows it, knows what it would cost him to reenter the horror movie setting in his bedroom, but it’s his penance. He’s gotta pay.
Dean nods, taking the blade. “How… how exactly am I gonna do this?”
Dean has read that expression before, about people’s legs turning to jelly, and he always thought it was kind of dumb. His world has been shaken, shattered even; he’s been torn to pieces emotionally and physically and he knows on a literal and figurative level what it feels like to get your heart torn out, but… jelly?
He has to choke a peal of hysteric laughter. How long has he fantasized about those words said in that gravelly voice? And how fucked up is it that his answer is the same even in this messy, uncomfortable, godawful and god-forsaken context?
“Yeah. Yeah, of course.” Sam squeezes his shoulder and then stands, adjusting the blankets. “Get some rest, Dean. Things’ll be better in the morning.”
And, of course, the ash and feathers and bone. The worst of it is on his bed, but the remains of Castiel’s wings are spread across his room in dusty black piles that he’ll never be able to sweep away. Whole feathers lie scattered in every corner. There seem to be so many on the floor, when there were so few on Cas’s wings.
Hazel-green eyes meet blue ones and Castiel can feel the burn sliding up his neck to his face.  The man regards him curiously and Castiel decides he must leave.  Pulling bills from his wallet, he leaves the meal price plus a generous tip for Beth.  He stands and walks quickly toward the door.  Castiel signs
“Such a pretty, pretty Feeder my Castiel found for himself.”
have started by the time Sam drops into one of the well-worn chairs and lets his head fall onto crossed arms. Mary’s hand slides under Sam’s too-long hair and presses gently against his nape. The pressure point there instantly renders Sam immobile but since Mary is a Beta and his mother, the young Omega feels soothed not dominated.  She holds him still until Sam’s body catches up with his emotions. His breathing hitches with sobs but eventually they fade and Mary releases Sam. He sits up and wipes his eyes on the sleeve of his Henley.
“Yeah, we didn’t exactly grow up in three star hotels.  Man, remember that place in Tulsa?”
of all people … Bobby groans and takes another drink. The house has wards and every defense they can think of; it now even boasts a holding cell built to contain Dean until they can break the vampire’s thrall. Taking down a centuries old predator like Castiel is just part and parcel of their lives but Dean’s intervention … it pains Bobby to take away something that seems to make Dean so happy even if it’s also so very, very bad for him.
Dean feels the vampire's hand slide into his hair. When the fingers tighten, he winces but manages to keep his eyes shut. Castiel's breath is hot against the shell of his ear and when the vampire speaks again, it's like a thousand ants march directly down Dean's ear canal into his brain.
The phone slips out of his grasp a couple of times but when he sees it's barely after four a.m., Dean flops back onto the mattress.  Even more awesome. Dean squeezes his eyes shut and threads his fingers into his hair where he grips it until he can feel his scalp protest painfully.  As a small child, Dean learned how to dream lucidly so he could wake himself up and prevent any unwanted sending. As he got older, he learned to lock down his mind so nothing broke loose while he slept.  Even his usual nightmares - which are nothing compared to these latest monsters - were securely held behind his shields.
?" Dean asks, confused.  "What did I do?"
Sam thinks he should have expected the smack to the head.
“Mr. Winchester, welcome back.  I want you to blink once for 'yes' and twice for 'no' -- do you understand?"
The vampire suddenly drops Sam into a pained heap on the floor. He twists away and shifts into his smaller, human form.  Castiel stands with his back to Sam, hands tight fists at his sides. He’s naked and vulnerable to the two Hunters in the room with him. Sam pushes himself up and sidles slowly around Castiel to Bobby’s side. The older man sits up with a pained grimace and looks at Sam in confusion.
Dean gets up and walks back into the kitchen to the paper towels.  He bunches up a handful and runs them under the faucet.  He's got to clean up he mess.  He doesn't know when Castiel will be back and the vampire will be angry if he doesn't have everything clean.  He has to be good.  Sammy's life depends on him being good.  He can't fuck this up.  The link is silent.
Dean grins and stands.  As he walks through the kitchen he sees his not-so-little brother sitting cross-legged on the floor, making notes on his laptop from a book far thicker than anything Dean has ever read.  Sam can read Braille but he’s not limited to it.  His sense of touch is so refined he can actually pick up the infinitesimal layer of print in almost any book.  His fingers slide over the book and the keys of the laptop click away seemingly of their own accord.
“Oh come on!” Dean protests. “I’ve had broken ribs before, I’ll be
Sam gives a watery laugh and nods. He kisses his mother good night and dreams of laughing green eyes and the scent of cedar - Dean’s scent - and everything is ok for the moment.
"She went to talk to the nurse and see if we can get an update.  He's still in surgery," Sam murmurs.
He holds Sam’s limp form against him as the human’s heartbeat falters and slows. Jake sneers.
“So explain it to me, Castiel. Tell me why I should trust that you won't turn Dean over to the Powers-That-Be the minute you locate him,” Sam demands, picking up his laptop.
A harsh gasp breaks the darkness and Jake jerks around to see a tall man walking into the illuminated circle around them. He blinks and then his eyes narrow.
Tears flood and spill onto the floor.  Dean scrubs harder.
Castiel blushes but nods. [That would be nice, Dean.]
Sam rolls his eyes.  “Come on, Dean. You made the deal because he threatened me.  I know he can compel with his voice so you’ve got to consider anything about him suspect.  Whatever the reason, Castiel’s had his fun; he needs to release you now.”
and I will be present.  But not for a while … I can’t promise I’ll keep my temper if you two try anything.  The bond needs to solidify a little more and you need to learn some manners.  If I hurt Sam, he’ll be a long time healing.  Or I might accidentally kill him – he’s more fragile than you now.”
Wide hazel eyes snap open.
Dean looks apologetically at Castiel and slides into the mind of his lover. Castiel winces. Dean finds no sign that Castiel intended to betray him. He does, however, feel the deep affection Castiel had for him evaporate beneath hurt and confusion.
Dean blinks, confused. Mike and Jessica disappear in that vampire way of theirs and Castiel scoops Dean up like a freaking kid.  He doesn’t protest though.  It feels nice, honestly but he wonders if Cas is upset at the way things are going.
Sam springs to his feet. The table wobbles and his mug tumbles over, spilling coffee over the surface and off to the deck. “Wait, what?! You never —“
“That was just the first day and I thought I was stuck here for the rest of my days … might as well get the lay of the land,” Dean reasons.
. He takes what he can when he can because he
"Of course he will, you're his soulmate.  I'll just tell him --"
“Mmm, the anguish of one brother suffering for another,” Castiel taunts. His expression is somber when he turns to Dean. “Would you truly die for your brother, Dean?”
Jack chooses this moment to whine irritably at the brothers and they fall fondly quiet. Dean tucks Jack a little closer and slips off to sleep bathed in the smell of peaches.
"Castiel is a real sweet guy but kinda scattered sometimes...he shot out of here so fast earlier he forgot his phone."
Dean’s eyes spill the tears that have been building.
Dean doesn't even think about it ... he always uses his ability during sex. Usually, it's a road map for him to follow so he knows where his partner wants to be touched and how. This time, however, he's learning what makes Castiel groan the normal way – trial and error. But his ability lets him feel exactly what Castiel is feeling ... it's an odd echo of his own body's response to Castiel's hands. He has to pull back when Castiel wraps his lips around Dean's cock.
Castiel’s fingertips brushed over the back of Dean’s hand. “And how many not so fluently?”
... oh my God -- I would
Castiel’s fangs emerge. “If Dean has been turned, I would imagine he will be destroyed by our First.”
“C-cas … do-don’t …”
"Be good out there, Winchester."
Castiel sighs. “Dean, you know you have to rest to let your injuries heal.  My feedings will help but your body is still mortal and bound to this world’s rules.  I’m anxious for you to be better as well – I’m losing business working out of my home garage.”
“You’re —”
“Shit, sorry, Sammy.  You ok? I forgot about the enhancement stuff.”
Sam’s mind tries to make sense of what he’s hearing while his heart twists painfully at the sounds coming from Bobby.
Castiel nods. “A vampire’s venom enhances the Feeder’s physiology. After a few weeks, Dean’s sense of taste and smell was clarified. He went on a ‘mission’ as he called it to find something he could stand.  That is the result. It’s quite popular from what the owner has told me. His best selling blend.”
Dean blinks owlishly at the vampire, then an image of cargo pants appears in Castiel’s head. He sighs.  Going to the dresser, he finds a worn – honestly, is
"Still smarts."
“Sorry,” he sniffs.
“Your brother orders that blend custom ground from a local shop.”
“Jam?” Dean asks, amused.
"I'm not, I'm just --"
, Dean sends.
Dean looks up from where he’s been straightening tools.
"Days."
Castiel throws his head back and laughs again but this time Jake shivers at the black madness rippling through the sound.  He jolts when the vampire’s head snaps forward and twin blue flames focus on him.
Ellen looks between the two brothers.  Sam looks like a very large kicked puppy and Dean has the sort of face that makes you want to forgive him because he’s so adorable.  Ellen isn’t impressed.
"Why?" The voice asking the question is hoarse and it's only because Castiel's hearing is enhanced that he understands it.
Dean and Sam have an understood truce that they don't use their abilities when pranking one another. The one time Dean broke the rule, he nearly got Sam hurt. He'd used his ability to trick Sam into thinking he was awake one night. The younger Winchester began walking in his sleep, running into walls and other furniture with a confused look on his face. Dean thought it was hilarious until Sam had walked out of the bedroom and straight to the stairs. Dean had managed to wake him up in time for Sam to use his own ability to keep from falling down to the first floor.
”Castiel has reason enough for that but he hunts discreetly when he chooses to,” Mike says softly.  He meets the Hunter’s eyes again.  “Castiel took you as his Feeder to humiliate you.”
A few days later, Balthazar Novak walks up to the door of his brother's house. He rings the doorbell and waits. Castiel opens the door and Balthazar is struck by how pale his little brother seems. His blue eyes, normally so bright, are now faded and there is a sadness in them that Balthazar hasn't seen since their mother died.
“Sam ... have that order up in just a sec,” Beth says cheerfully when the younger Winchester walks in the door.
Dean can hear the gentle, sleepy confusion of his younger brother's thoughts. He swallows a lump in his throat ... he's losing everything tonight. He's going to pay for thinking he could ever let his guard down. Dean leans forward on his steering wheel, tears falling unheeded. He sends to Sam, filling the space between them with love and a desperate urgency.
Dean looks at the man who has, on more than one occasion, expressed the opinion that Dean is only using Benny's generosity for his own gain.  It's a fair concern and Dean knows it.  He frowns and stands up.
Dean hops out of the truck with a wince but he only goes as far as the front door, waiting for the vampire who’s destroyed his life to help him upstairs. Dean wakes up screaming for Sam but Castiel doesn’t appear to comfort him.  Dean feels oddly bereft.
"Yes.  Everything is as you requested and we can leave when you're ready," Victor replies.  He doesn't look at Dean again as Castiel leads him onboard.
"Dean ... ha ha ... Dean, I'm sorry.  No, wait, ha ha ha ... I'm really am ..." Castiel gasps as Dean stalks past the shaking vampire and down the stairs.
“I feel like … it’s like I don’t even know who Dean
Sam stares at the tabletop which blurs and ripples through his tears. He wipes angrily at his eyes but the drops continue to splash in the tabletop. Bobby clears his throat roughly.
Dean's distracted mind has been a source of irritation for Bobby and a goldmine of teasing from Sam. It's also been a bit of a hazard ... Dean forgets who is around a couple of times at the shop and answers questions or fetches things that were never asked for out loud. Bobby, especially, hopes this date will quiet Dean's mind a little so he can focus.
Sam nods and slides on to a stool at the counter. He carries the typical blind man's cane but his ability lets him 'see' the world around him. Dean said it was the coolest thing ever the first time he'd looked through Sam's inner eyes when they were nine and five respectively. Thanks to Hollywood, Dean now calls it his “Neo-vision” after Keanu's character.
No sooner does Castiel’s attention shift to Dean then the intruder attacks again. Castiel’s wings burst forth as he takes his Dark form but in such close quarters they are more hindrance than help. He needs to protect Dean ...
“Yeah, Dean … I -- I overstepped, man.  I -- I shouldn’t have said what I did.”
squeak thank you very much - until he's laying back against Castiel's chest.  He's about to protest when he feels the vampire's fangs slide into his neck and the familiar warmth begins to flow over him.
He walks over and tenderly trails fingertips over his grandson's dark hair.  John had been less than thrilled when Dean had returned home pregnant sans Alpha.  He'd taken a bat to a fence post and battered it into splinters just to keep himself from saying something he would regret.  When he'd walked back into house, he'd hugged Dean and told him that they would help him as much as they could and did they need to bury an Alpha.  The tears that had followed had washed all the shame from Dean and John would always be grateful he kept his tongue for once.  He chucks Sam's jaw gently.
Sam frowns at the table, his hands now tight fists clenched before him. Mary glances over and shakes her head sadly while the milk warms.
The voice, however, seems to have the ability to understand wounded victim gibberish because he exhales in relief.
Dean bristles. “I knew enough to track your sorry ass.”
“Master?”
the one who broke through, Winchester?” Castiel mused to himself.
Castiel parks his truck inside the small attached garage and grins.  "Of course not ... she's mine."
Outwardly, Dean’s mind is more or less offline but there’s just enough operating system left running to ensure his responses match expectations. When Master decides to use his new toy, Dean will present and moan and make all the noises Master likes. Dean will be exactly the submissive, pleasure-drunk, obedient Feeder Master craves.
me?" Dean retorts.  He chuckles.  "You just spent a couple hours --"
Dean shrugs. “Easier to say than Cas-tee-el, I guess.  Sorry.”
Castiel tries and fails to hold back his snort.  Dean's eyes fly open and he stares at the vampire, completely nonplussed.  Castiel's lips tremble as he tries to fight back the laugh but in the end he throws his head back.  Dean frowns and crosses his arms.
Mary turns from straightening bed clothes to see her son in tears. Outwardly, he’s six-foot-four and twenty-three but Sam’s misery wipes all the intervening years away to leave him as young and vulnerable as his sleeping nephew. With the deftness of a mother who has raised two sons to adulthood and become a protective grandmother, Mary tucks Jack back under covers and presses a soft kiss against his forehead. She tugs Sam to his feet and steers him down the hall to the kitchen.
“Hey! Didn’t know you were stopping by,” he calls from the bottom of the stairs.
Dean’s gasps come quicker and quicker. His whole body shakes like Cas’s did when he was trying to fight off Lucifer, and he doesn’t even bother trying to still it. He doesn’t know where his heart is anymore; he can feel it in every part of his body.
The dry feathers rustle with the wryness in Cas’s voice, and for a moment Dean can picture what the wings must have been like in all their glory, reacting to Castiel’s every mood and thought. How they would have flared out wide and intimidating in the face of a threat, or how his feathers would’ve bristled when Dean annoyed him enough to earn a bitchface.
Cas smooths his hands down his coat as he descends. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think to inform you.”
Suddenly he’s four years old and clinging to his dad’s hand two, maybe three days after the fire, when they’d gone back to see if there was anything left to salvage. Dad had wanted to leave him and Sammy with a babysitter but Dean had clung to him, refusing to be separated until he relented and brought them along. He hasn’t thought about that days in years, managed to bury it down as he accumulated countless other traumas, but right now—
“Fuck!” One hand holding the sword into the wound that’s steadily leaking silver light, he presses the other hand hard into the small of Castiel’s back, trying at once to comfort him and to hold him still. “Cas! Cas, what—”
Dean stares at the skeletal wings as they stand like that. When Cas was human and on the streets by himself, did they hurt? Have they been rotting slowly all these years, right in front of him as he was too preoccupied with Gadreel and the Mark of Cain and all his other fuckups to notice?
But it’s Cas’s. And it’s still beautiful.
“What’s up?” Dean asks.
He buries the blade to the left, to where the wing should be connecting. All at once the feeling of being connected to a live current comes back, and at first he’s jolted, almost lets go of the blade, but then it feels like the grace is connecting him to the sword, like his hand has become so powerfully magnetic that he couldn’t pull away if he tried.
“Okay. Fine. Okay.” He picks Castiel’s sword up, having dropped it in the aftershock of the severing, and forces himself back onto his bed to kneel above Castiel once more. The absurd thought intrudes that for all the many times he’s thought about getting Cas in bed, he never pictured this scenario.
There’s still a slurry of blood and rot, like before. But in addition to the silver-blue of Cas’s grace, there’s also something hot and red originating from below and snapping like lightning up the wing, tightening around the bone and muscle in a vein-like fractal.  It tangles with Cas’s grace, entwining and crackling around it. It’s almost like they’re fighting, this fiery essence—the stolen grace that hasn’t yet turned to poison?—against the cool of Castiel’s true self.
And things don;t get any clearer once they're in his bedroom.
He’s leaning against the wall and Sam is drying him off, still telling him it’s going to be okay. Then he’s in Sam’s bedroom, pulling on a pair of boxers Sam tossed to him, and then being guided down onto a mattress that’s similar to his own, but still wrong in every way. Then Sam is handing him a bottle of water and a small pill because he had to have been on the floor for hours and he’s dehydrated and exhausted, and once he drinks some water he needs to sleep off the shock, and I know if I leave you alone you’re just gonna get drunk and that’d make you feel even worse tomorrow, Dean.
Blood and rot pour out from the gash. Not the first time Dean’s nose has been assaulted by those particular odors, but no matter how used he is to handling fresh corpses, this is worse. Of course it is. This is
He presses the tip of the sword into the base of Castiel’s wing, just enough to split the skin. Blood and something black and vile wells up under the silver blade.
He doesn’t know what he’s touching. All he can think about are the leviathan, but even that isn’t quite right. These… welts? on Castiel’s back aren’t thin or vein-like, though they’re the same shade, like there’s black sludge underneath his skin. But these are thick vines creeping out from his shoulder blades and down either side of his spine, the skin that borders them an angry, inflamed red. Like tree roots, Dean thinks as he traces the curvature of one mark. Like something poisonous is preparing to sprout from Castiel’s body.
He looks back up. “Can I see them? Your wings?”
One last sardonic smile. Dean can’t look away from his eyes. When the red glow of Lucifer’s grace fades, it takes with it the tears and broken veins, and he could almost convince himself he’s actually looking at Castiel.
Except for the part where he really fucking can, apparently.
Dean still remembers the way he felt when Castiel had unfolded his wings for the first time, in that barn all those years ago. Even through the heart-stopping fear, his chest had filled with awe at the way that the air crackled around his skin, at how the shadows had unfurled against the sigil-covered wall.
sound safe.
“I’ve still got a working pair, thank goodness. I could never imagine being so useless.” Lucifer laughs,stepping back. “Anyway, I better go back looking for a way to bring down Auntie Amara. But this was fun, Dean. Love to do it again sometimes.”
His fingers clench and unclench around the blade. Cas has done as he asked, lying on his bed with his chest propped up with Dean’s pillows. His wings almost touch the walls on either side of his bedroom.
Cas sighs, long and slow, and turns around.
He twists his wrist back and forth, trying blindly for a sawing motion, and this seems to do the trick: with a sound like a bone cracking against a rocky surface, something shatters underneath Castiel’s skin. Castiel screams. His grace flares bright enough that Dean loses his grasp on the sword in a desperate attempt to shield his vision. The solid wall of heat makes him flinch back; he can’t help it, and then he’s falling off the bed.
He remembers the chaos of the Cage. He hadn’t been paying attention to Cas, not really. And the last words that Cas had managed to get out before he lost control—
He knows he shouldn’t be so forward, so tactile with Castiel because every touch just makes him want more, but he can’t help himself. Maybe it’s because he grew up holding and comforting Sam whenever he was hurt. Probably it’s something else.
“And then,” Not-Cas, Probably-Lucifer continues with a grotesque wiggle of glee, “and then he really thought you wouldn’t do it. Right up to the moment you stabbed him in the back, he really, truly believed that you’d realize it wasn’t him. Cas is really sold on the idea that you’ve got something special, some ‘profound bond,’ did you know that?”
“I’m sorry.”
Dean touches the joint where the left wing fans out, and as soon as his hands have made contact, burnt feathers crumble off beneath him. Castiel flinches.
And he doesn’t try. Because Cas is right, and he knows this is the right place. He has to squint to even get an idea of what he’s doing, Cas’s form is so awash in silver light. The blade presses up against something hard and unyielding, that makes his hand almost feel like it’s burning. This, he knows, is the wing, the sword acting as a conduit between Cas’s true angelic self and Dean, in all his human weakness. In another scenario, the energy rushing through him might be awesome in the original sense of the word; as it his, he can’t really appreciate the glory of practically touching an angel’s true form when his whole purpose is that he’s about to mutilate it beyond repair.
Cas dips his head. “As you wish.”
“Sorry,” he says. “Shit. Sorry. Cas, what is this? What do you need from me?”
“Oo-kay.” That’s not weird. That’s not waking up something he hasn’t ever let himself feel. Nope.
His eyelids throb yellow with the aftershocks of whatever just happened and he wants to keep them squeezed shut until the burning stops, but above him, Cas is gasping, panting, small pained noises that sound almost like sobs falling from his lips, and Dean can’t, won’t, prolong this anymore than he has to.
Cas flinches when Dean presses down, so he immediately drops his hand. It was enough to let him feel him the marks weren’t hard, like they looked. He couldn’t tell what it was beneath the skin, but it could be pus. Or just blood.
He shakes his head. He thinks. He doesn’t know what calm feels like anymore.
Cas frowns. “That’s factually inaccurate. Sam, Rowena, and I were all more responsible than you.”
The blade feels heavy in his hand, though whether that’s because of the moment or because of some inherent difference in Castiel’s weapon, he doesn’t know. He stares at it. “Cas…”
He twists the blade slightly to the left, towards where the wing should be, and in response something like a low electric current flows up the metal. His fingers tingle like they’re dipped in sparkling water.
Dean forces himself to look at Cas, who’s still lying face-down, clenching the comforter, also now covered in a ashy dust, with both of his tight fists. The muscles of his back are clenched so tight it looks painful.
He couldn’t argue with Cas even if he was capable of forming coherent sentences right now. Once more, he forces the blade into Cas’s back, deeper than it seems like it should go. Rot oozes out below, looking almost purple in the glow of the grace that spills out alongside it. He twists until the sword meets something hard, that he knows from years of anatomy lessons with Alistair has no place in a human back.
“I had to heal it quickly so I wouldn’t fall. Hence the blemish.”
“No.” Dean grabs his brother’s wrist, calling on energy he thought he’d wasted ages ago on panic and on tears. “Don’t.”
“I’d tell you that Castiel says hi, but between you and me, the guy’s crying too hard to say anything.” Lucifer rolls his eyes and the illusion breaks; he has none of Cas’s dry, brusque humor. “Some people just can’t take a little pain, am I right?”
And isn’t it just so fucked up that he’s out here mutilating his best friend’s body, and yet Cas is the one comforting him. Isn’t that just his life.
“The bed. It’ll be more comfortable for you than bending over a table or something.”
He picks his sword up off the bed, where Dean must’ve dropped it when faced with the sight of his wings, and holds it out to Dean. The bunker’s fluorescent lights glint off the silver in flashes that look a little like an angel’s grace, when it’s burning out through the eyes of their vessel.
“Yes. Use the blade to dig under where the wing connects. You’ll perceive my human form as you do so, but the wings are part of my true form, and that’s where the blade is acting. You’ll know when you’re in the right place.”
He shakes his head. “What you did, that’s gonna leave a mark. Though if it makes you feel any better, it’s not the first scar he’s gotten ‘cause of you.”
Yep. He’s on fire. He knows, of course, that Cas is just referring to all the times that they sat together watching movies, Cas absorbed in the action playing out on Sam’s laptop, Dean preoccupied with the reality of having Cas in his bed. His dick kinda needs to be reminded, though. However much this situation is fucked-up and inherently unsexy and he probably shouldn’t even be remembering that he
“Sorry,” he says again, as if that one word is capable of encapsulating everything he regrets.
They remind him of trees left after a forest fire, their burnt and barren branches extending hopelessly out into the sky. Blackened muscle barely clings to charred bones. The remaining feathers hang limp and scraggly. He can smell ash.
Dean pauses. He flexes his fist, heart already starting to speed up. “Yeah?”
The wing shudders. The bones flex, what feathers remain flaring out. For a moment the wing stretches in the air, though Dean is almost certain that it shouldn’t be able to, that he had to have severed whatever connection it has to Cas’s vessel. But it stays upright all the same. And at the base…
“I know. Just gimme a sec.”
And then it’s like he’s tapped into a larger network and his hand is no longer his own, like whatever force gives Cas his powers has taken control of him as well. Something makes him press down even deeper, jerk the sword in a way that he wouldn’t on his own, and then there’s a cracking even louder than before and when he yanks the blade out, it’s like it’s a magnet, the poison dragged out in a thick river at its tip. It takes all of his instincts as a hunter to not drop it.
That’s what Cas’s wings are now. The complete breakdown of what should have been indestructible; a constant gone up in flames. Seven years ago, when Dean had seen the shadows of the wings, he had never imagined that they could be ruined so completely. But here they are now, burnt husks slowly poisoning Cas, threatening to take away the presence that he’s become so accustomed to, he doesn’t know what he’d do without it.
He opens his eyes again and, not really thinking about it, runs his fingers over one of the blackened wing bones. There’s a bump, in the center, not at the joint, where it seems like the wing was broken once. Must’ve been a hell of a wound for it to have left a mark like that, Dean thinks.
Cas doesn’t look like he agrees, but he doesn’t push the matter. Just glances around, not meeting Dean’s eyes. Which is the first sign, or at least the first sign that Dean really picks up on, that something’s wrong.
“Fuck!”
“Dean! Dean, stop!”
Cas isn’t joking.
“I haven’t thought about it in years. It wasn’t exactly the worst damage ever done to them.”
Cas doesn’t answer. Which is. Not good. Because he kind of needs Cas to be okay right now, because god knows that he sure isn’t.
“Oh,” says Not-Cas. “Oh, that was fun. I didn’t plan on showing myself to you—mm, but you were going to find out soon enough, I suppose.”
For a second something changes. Some sort of ripple runs up Cas’s body, but he clenches his teeth and again growls out, “No!”
He turns the blade over and over. Uncomfortable doesn’t begin to cover it, not really. Lightheaded. Sick. Horrified.
Still, his mind makes the connection now, and so it’s no surprise to him when, in the slit he’s carved in Castiel’s back, he can see grace softly pulsing up from beneath the gore.
“Let me do this for you,” Sam says, prying off Dean’s fingers one by one, and then pressing his hand between his own. “Don’t make yourself go through that. You’re hurting as it is, and you gotta be in a good headspace if we’re going to be fighting the Devil.”
Nothing to lose now.
Cas doesn’t answer, but he thinks he feels some softening in the tension beneath his hand. He sighs, kneads his fingers down into the quivering muscles once more, as if such a tiny gesture could mean anything in the face of the magnitude of the pain he’s about to cause, and then pierces Castiel’s skin.
He can’t do this. It’s too much.
“Tell me there’s a way to cure this,” Dean says, swallowing hard. “There’s—there’s gotta be. There are so many books here; something’s gotta have an answer. We just need to look—”
He doesn’t say anything, though. Just shrugs his shirt off, letting it fall into the growing pile of discarded clothing. For a moment, they just face each other.
“Easy there, tiger. Guess you’ve really lost your stomach for torture.” The smirk on his face, that’s all Lucifer. “Too bad. Word on the street was, you were pretty good at it.”
“No. There’s no time.” Another full-body shudder. “You’re in danger, Dean; you have to run; I said yes, I’m
He’s several steps toward the kitchen already when Cas calls, “Wait.”
“Cas, you gotta let me treat that,” he says, swallowing down his urge to be sick. “Let me just get the first-aid kit and clean it, at least—”
Castiel’s eyes glow red for a moment, and behind him spreads the shadow of two perfect wings, still full of feathers, arching up proudly towards the ceiling. It’s funny—he always kinda thought Lucifer’s wings would be bat-like, more at home on a gargoyle than an angel, but of course that doesn’t make any sense. Why should Lucifer’s look any different than any other angel’s, than Castiel’s wings should look, if there was any justice in the world?
“Yeah. Uh. Do I just… cut?” It sounds dumb, but he can’t risk fucking this up. Not when he could hurt Cas in the process.
Sam says that they’ll take care of this like they always do. “We’ve beaten him before and we’ll do it again. We’ve saved Cas before and we’ll do it again. It’s gonna be okay, Dean, but you’ve got to get some rest. Calm down. Please?”
“What have you done,” he breaths out. “What – what have you
The walk to the bedroom takes place in silence. Dean feels like he should be saying something; it's been long enough since he last saw Cas that he should have plenty to catch him up on, but no words are coming. Everything feels so off that he can't pinpoint exactly what's wrong.
Dean’s head swims. He’s too hot and too cold all at once, and he can’t form cohesive thoughts above the staccato of his heartbeat. “Cas?”
He arches off the bed, body twisting from side to side. That red light flares up again, bright enough that Dean shuts his eyes for a split second, and when he opens them, it isn’t Cas on the bed.
“Keep going,” Castiel orders. “It won’t feel any better if it’s slow.”
He’s going to faint. He can’t breathe, his heart is racing, and he’s going to faint, and his last hope is that the devil is the father of lies. “Was it real? Did I—really—”
His head swims, and he becomes aware once more that he’s gasping for breath. The feather falls to the floor – better dropped than further broken in his hands, which are now clenched into tight fists, an attempt at pain, anything he can hold on to, anything that can make him feel stable.
because you’ve been too busy trying to fix everything I screwed up?”
always been a good distraction from everything he wants to avoid.)
Cas hadn’t called in advance to say he’d be coming home, so it’s a surprise – a good one – when Dean sees him step through the door.
Things don’t get better for a long time.
“Up at Jody’s. She knows a guy who knows a guy who thinks he might have a lead on a Hand of God, but he’s super paranoid. Said he’d only meet with Sam, and only at Jody’s place. Guess he got wind that I was the one that set the Darkness free.” Dean shrugs, like it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t. Not really. Not like he expects gratitude for all the other times he saved the universe. Not like the guy is wrong.
“As I said. I’m
Unlike the left wing, this one doesn’t go in a burst of light so intense that he’s forced to look away on fear of blindness. He
He’s been stitching up bodies and setting bones since his dad taught him at six years old, but something tells him this isn’t something ordinary sutures or casts could fix. He’s lying. He’s sure Cas knows it, too, but he has to say it. Needs Cas to know where the exits are if he decides to leave the horror show that’s about to happen.
Taking a deep breath, he kneels on his mattress. This whole situation is already more intimate than it had any right to be, so, throwing decorum to the wind, he crawls forward until he’s straddling one of Cas’s legs, carefully positioning himself so that certain parts of him aren’t pressed against Castiel.
“Let me make it clear that I’m
Dean shrugs again. “Yeah, well, I took it away from Cain in the first place, so. Not much to argue about.”
He screams once, twice, three times, maybe more, but he isn’t aware of anything at all until a hand shakes his shoulder, and he forces his eyes open to see Sam above him, a look of abject panic on his face. “Dean? What the hell happened?”
Did you really mean what you said?
I finally earned enough money to get my own place. I move in Monday.
He can hear the crashing of waves in the distance and imagines the dark, stormy blue colours the ocean must be, the same blue he sees now in front of  him.
then I'd say a couple weeks at most." Maisie looks back to the nurse, smiling politely. "Thank you." Meg nods and walks away.
Here's my added bit to the stages!! :)
You were right though, happiness
Cas, I love you too.
“Dean?”
Castiel hugs him back with just as much enthusiasm. "Hello Dean." he says quietly into the nook of Dean's neck.
The transition from hunting to having a normal life with a normal job was easier than he expected. With Chuck gone, there were no more monsters coming after them and with Rowena as queen of hell, no more demons either. Rowena did a good job of keeping them in line, no demons allowed on earth and no more demon deals.
It should be so easy. Loving them is easy, so why is it so hard to say? Why doesn’t he know how to?
While seemingly perfect on the outside, on the inside was a brewing storm of self hatred which lead to lies, fights, alcohol and eventually...
It's so much better in the having. And you do, have it- me- you always did. You can have all of it because Cas, I love you too." Cas is smiling so big and Dean can't resist any longer. He grabs Cas' face and kisses him.
looked taken aback for a second, but recovered quickly. "You can't have him, he made a deal." Jack nodded, as if the fact didn't effect him or his plans in the slightest. "I know, but he is needed and you have a obstreperous empty." Jack smiled at

Dear Cas,

Dean shrugs on his jacket and grabs his bag, shouldering it, as he heads out the front door to his Baby. It's his turn to pick up Cas for school and he's leaving early, hoping to get a caffeine fix before making their way to school. He had already texted Cas to ask if he wanted anything.

It's reaching about nine in the morning when he arrives in California. It takes him another two hours to catch a break, eat and relieve himself, and then set on to Sam Eileen's house.
It seemed that time had passed a lot farther than Castiel first assumed. He was of course extremely happy for Sam and wondered who the lucky bride-to-be was. He wondered if Dean too, had moved on, had found someone.
He parks in the lot and takes his keys out the ignition. "So what is it you wanted to say about the holidays?" Cas bites his lip and starts fidgeting nervously. "Dean I- You have to know that it wasn't my intention to go this early, but my dad-" "He booked your flight earlier than planned didn't he?" Deans lip curls in anger. It's not fair! He can't do that just because-
Dear Cas,

Hope you enjoyed this one!!
Dean grins back and allows his hand to be taken and dragged into Cas' room. "Let's listen to more songs! And then maybe we can 'fool around' later on." Dean's eyes widen and he swallows, mouth suddenly dry, but doesn't protest and follows him.

Eileen teaches Jack ASL, he's a fast learner, and Cas smiles fondly at him.
He hears Dean talking to Jack in the kitchen and makes a decision. He could sit here in the bathroom and dawdle or he could face up and go sit in the lounge. He slips into the lounge, taking a seat on the loveseat. Sam and Eileen give him a strange look, but otherwise don't say anything.
They each take turns reading and passing the papers, Dorothy being the last to read them. Castiel is the first to speak up. "You got in?" He gives her a small, but proud, smile and passes the paper to Dean. "On a full scholarship?!" Dean's face is full of pride. "Holt shit, that's great Char!" Sam says. Dean passes them to Dorothy. She reads them and then her face breaks into a wide smile. "This is brilliant!" She hands the papers off and crushes Charlie in a warm hug.

Sam and Eileen are getting married in about a month!! I'm best man, of course and– surprisingly (or not)– Charlie is best woman!
I moved in, the place is quite sweet- if not a bit lonely- with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a small living room and kitchen. Kinda looking forward to having my own kitchen.
Sam and Eileen bought a house! A full on 3-bedroom, white picket fence, picture-perfect home. I'm real happy for them.
When they landed on earth, it was no where near where Castiel expected to land. It was in front of a huge, white, double story house. It had a huge window that peered into a sitting area and a wooden front door with a doorbell and a neat front yard. Before Cas could ask where they were, Jack spoke up, "Sam prayed to me. He says he's getting married soon."
He doesn't know what he'd do if Cas was actually back. Hug him? Kiss him? Yell at him for leaving?
A rustle, sounds of scrambling, and then a second someone was plonking themselves next to Charlie on the window seat. "Too much noise?" The newcomer asks, turned to look at Charlie with a lopsided smile.

They've been sitting in comfortable silence for a few hours, when nurse Meg taps on the doorframe and comes in. "Ma'am it's time for your grandfather to eat and take his meds." she says boredly, "You can stay if you'd like." she adds, almost as an afterthought. Maisie looks at her watch and then smiles politely at her, but shakes her head. "No thank you, it's time for me to go anyways. Bye pops, see you soon alright?" she smiles at him, trying to hold back tears. He smiles at her knowingly, sadly. "Is it time already? oh alright, bye Maisie. Tell your mother I send my love." She nods, not trusting her voice, and gets up to wrap him in a tight hug. He hugs her back tightly, her vision blurs. She subtly wipes her eyes with the back of her hand before pulling back and putting on a brave smile. As she walks out she hears, "...is it really necessary to take these now, if I'm going t-" she doesn't stay to hear the rest of it.
These two idiots were in love, but through undesirable circumstances, they never told each other how they felt. This might be another cliché one, but a much more interesting one at that.
face towards Castiel and gave him a sinister, almost gleeful, smile that failed to make Dean look as beautiful as he truly was. "Castiel,"
Sam still did a bit of hunting, opting for working the phones like Bobby had, dealing out hunts to other hunters and helping out folks new to hunting.

In the two days that follow, Castiel decides to get a job working as a cashier and start saving up to go to college. Sam and Eileen offer to pay for him, but he declines, wanting to do this one thing himself.

"Are you and Dorothy a thing now?" "Did you propose? No wait– Did Doro propose?" "Did you two finally kiss?" Charlie rolls her eyes fondly at them and shakes her head. "None of that guys, sorry." Her smile fades a bit, wishing she could tell them otherwise. But then someone is covering her eyes and shouting, "Guess who!" Charlie tries, and fails, to pry the hands blocking her vision and says, "Oh, I don't know. Jo? Meg?" Castiel winces at the last one and Charlie, who managed to get a peek through the fingers, grins. Dean slaps her arm. "Alright, alright. Only joking. Doro?" The hands leave her face and Dorothy steps into view, seating herself between Charlie and Dean. She smiles wide at her.

If only I'd fucking known that it was Chuck, not Billie. She wouldn't have come after us–me.
Dean packed quick, he didn't need much for a two week stay at Sammy's, and was out the front door of his house in less than ten minutes, leaving Henry James behind and becoming Dean Winchester again. He unlocked the impala and tossed his duffel bag in the backseat, then hopped into the driver's side of his Baby and started her up.

She hopes Novak can rest easier now he has his other half. After everyone leaves, she walks up to the headstones, touches them both and says, "I hope you're both at peace. Rest easy. I love you." she then walks away, tears sliding silently down her face.
Dear Cas,
~ ◇ ~
For a while he was so angry at him for dy- leaving. For saying what he'd wanted to hear for so long and then just
48 hours. Castiel is slightly anxious. He's worried about, what he's sure is an inevitable, rejection. He's worried Dean might hate him for his feelings, or even for dying. He's scared to lose Dean as a friend. Dean's friendship is something he values very much and he would hate to lose it.
Goddammit was it me? Did I do something? Is it something I did, is that why you won't come back?
I love you
At about noon the next day, he decides to take a break and checks into the nearest hotel for a few hours of sleep. He sets his alarm for later in the evening and settles comfortably in the fluffy hotel sheets. He can afford a bit of luxury now.

that he loves another man?
First day on the job. Firefighting is actually pretty rough, well the paperwork anyway, I've been saving a lot of folks though. Besides, there's nothing I can't handle.
I wish you were here to fill the empty spaces though...
He quickly sent Sam a message saying he'd be there in about two days and then he went straight home to pack a bag for a fortnight.
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Now! Onto the story:
I tried praying again. I really fucking hope prayers can be reached into the empty.
She can see his mind has drifted off to past times. It’s getting late and she needs to get back home if she wants to get enough rest for work tomorrow. She gets up, “I’ll come back tomorrow, ok?” He breaks out of his staring match with the window and looks at her. “Sure, Maise.” He gives her a small smile and goes back to staring out the window. She smiles back and walks out, back to her car.
I hope you know, I love you.
“I love you too.” They smile and lean in again. Dean holds them tight as they kiss. They get lost in the gentle push and pull of their lips, the only sound they hear is the distant pattering of rain and their deep breaths mingling.
" Cas rubs his back in soothing circles and he leans into the touch. "I know, Dean. If I could do anything about it I would, you know that." He sighs again, but forces a smile on his face that comes out more bitter than anything. "So just how much earlier are you leaving?" Cas looks out towards the coverage of the trees, where the Park is just behind them, a sad look in his too-blue eyes.
“You take me, asshole,” Dean snarls.
Dean growls.  The sound grinds its way out of his chest like gravel shifting in a glass.  It’s a barely human sound and when Sam looks over at his older brother, his blood feels like ice in his veins.  Two black orbs devoid of anything
Benny shakes Castiel's hand and much to his surprise, signs easily. [Nice to meet you ... don't believe nothin' this smooth-talker says.]

know he’s different?  He was born without functioning vocal cords so he can’t talk or make any sound at all.  He can, however, hear every thought of every person within a specific radius that seems to enlarge the older he gets.  Sam can’t see but he could rearrange all the furniture in the house while he reads.
Dean bounds up the steps to follow Castiel who’s already walking through the house to the back.  Sam pauses at the entrance. After a moment’s hesitation, he presses his fingertips just around the edge of the door jamb.  The tiny smear of silver he leaves on the wood when he removes his hand is immediately soaked into the wood in the barely noticeable pattern of a miniature ancient rune.
look back at him.  Castiel lays a firm hand on Sam’s forearm.
Dean?”
Dean finds the work calming – busy enough so he doesn’t have to think but simple enough for him to be good at it. He picks up new techniques through his ability so he seems like a fast learner. Garth is making an effort to learn sign which Dean finds touching. He gives Garth a new sign every few days and the young man seems to be picking it up. Dean glances over when Garth’s voice falls into expectant silence. Dean skims over Garth’s mind to find the question he asked.
I could have told you your regular clothes are in the dresser.” Castiel opens a drawer and Dean sees his jeans and shirts clean and neatly folded.  He tosses an outfit to Dean.  “I’ll help you.”

“It’s on your left shoulder-blade,” he says.

"Where's your mother?"

A touch so soft it's barely a tickle slides across the back of Dean's neck.  Numbness creeps up his legs and Dean suddenly finds himself crashing to the floor.  He scrabbles against the linoleum but his arms are alien attachments on his body now.  The paralysis seeps upward at an alarming rate, helped no doubt, by Dean's pounding heart rate.  His struggles are little more than spastic muscle jerking. He feels a hand clench in his hair and pull up his head.  Dean's chest feels like someone is sitting on it.
"Not talkative, huh?  That's ok -- you won't have to talk much after we're done with you."
“I’ll explain on the way home,” Castiel says.
"You think I don't get that?  You know what happened to my dad after we lost my mom.  I'm not about to cause issues, Benny," Dean warns his friend.
Dean nods.
Dean takes the hand that's resting against his chest and looks at it.  It's larger than his own with long digits jointed in a way Dean's pretty sure doesn't occur in nature.  The skin enclosing those fingers is dark, almost black.  What's inside him pulses with heat and then a long, whip-like tail suddenly slithers between Dean's legs to wrap itself around his sack.  Dean moans softly and remembers eyes that burned like coals, wings that blotted out the light.  He taps a fingertip against a razor sharp obsidian talon.
Right.
The wing won’t break no matter how much pressure he puts on it. There’s gore running in long streaks down Cas’s back. Every moment he wastes is another second of agony for Cas, another prolonging of his pain at Dean’s hands.
(Probably because what he’s about to do is even more fucked up than admitting his maybe-crush on his decidedly male-vesseled best friend. The reemergence of his latent bisexuality frightens him, but he’d take an identity crisis every day if it meant not having to hurt Cas. His dick
Dean almost jumps when he feels Cas’s hand patting his knee, the angle, and the fact that Cas can’t see what he’s doing, making the gesture kind of awkward. “It’s for the best, Dean,” Cas reminds him. “I wouldn’t be here if there was another way.”
. Loud and raw, it starts as just a wordless cry, pure pain turned to sound, but then it breaks into words:
a dick, let alone one that perks up at the most inappropriate moments.
He shudders, his remaining wing pulling in close to his shoulders for a second. The dark poison that leaks from the opposite wound is pulsing around its base, just under the surface, like it could burst out of his skin at any moment. Again, Dean is reminded of the leviathans and how their possession had rotted Castiel from the inside.
Before he can get too lost in the maze of everything he regrets, Cas gasps and arches beneath him. Dean’s eyes snap down just in time to see one of the veins of poison
“It’s not import—”
“Okay.” He takes a deep breath. He desperately wants to shut his eyes, but something tells him that he can’t really afford to do that just now.
to look away from what’s happening, but of course he can’t. He’s always born witness to the consequences of the horrors that have happened at his hand.
God. Why is he thinking so much about his dick now, of all moments?
“You should use my sword. I forged it myself, with my own grace. That should help it draw out the foreign substance.”
Right now Castiel’s wings remind him of the remnants of his childhood home. Support beams that still stretched in the room that had once been a kitchen, burnt and blackened but somehow recognizable. The couch he once watched cartoons on, the fabric gray and curling up to reveal the foam underneath. Ash everywhere. As soon as he’d gotten there he had wanted to leave, but he didn’t ask Dad, just clung tightly to Sam’s stroller and made himself look, bear witness to the destruction of his childhood.
Sam has been researching the connections between claimed Feeders and their vampire. Lore says the link between the pair is built from the consistent feeding of the vampire. Telepathic bonds often form and the older the vampire, the stronger the ability to hear human minds. Knowing this, Sam
Castiel smirked and his eyes flashed red.  “If I wanted to distract you, Dean, I can think of far more enjoyable ways than humorous jabs.”  A frown creased the vampire’s brow. “Not that I’m going to be able to indulge myself while your brother is here, apparently.”
Castiel regards her steadily.  "What if Dean --"
“Get out of here before you break something, Dean,” Bobby snaps.
Feeder."
Dean rolls his eyes. “Told you I’m not kneeling for you … and what do you mean, he’s more fragile?”
Since admitting to himself how he felt about Castiel, using the honorific ‘master’ seemed perfectly natural to Dean.  It appeared to calm his vampire as Castiel studied the former Hunter for a long moment before closing his eyes and returning to his own human visage.
“Alright, Dean. I'll spare Sam on one condition.”
"Shhh, my pretty Feeder ... no one else will ever touch you like this again.  Your blood, your body, your very breath is mine Dean Winchester.  No other will share my bed while you live, my lovely one.   And because I Feed from you, Death will not seek you out for a very, very long time. You are mine and I do not share."
The other Omega closes his eyes for a moment.  Tears sneak out but a tension in his body seems to release.  When Dean opens his eyes, he immediately looks at Dr. Barnes with a silent plea.  She chuckles.
life?  And stop fucking talking like I’m not sitting right here!”
.  Not even the surprise announcement that Dean was pregnant felt like this.
Dean comes down toweling off his damp hair.  He tosses the towel at his brother and then ducks when it is stopped midair and launched back at him.  It lands in a wet heap on the floor.  Dean smirks.
"You were in a car accident, sir ... your jaw is broken and we've got a neck brace on you.  Just relax and we'll get you out of there, ok?"
"How about I blast a little Zep in here?  Liven things up --" Dean jokes, pulling out his phone.
Snapping the wrist-band into place and tucking his wallet in his back pocket, Dean follows a guard out the last two doors.  The familiar buzz and clank of doors rolling back are sounds he hopes to never hear again in this lifetime.  He steps out the man door set into the main gate without a backward glance.  A bus idles on one side of the parking lot.  The small cluster of inmates released at the same time as Dean either head for it or for a familiar car.  Dean scans the vehicles glinting in the midday sun, praying to see a particular black shape.  He swallows the jagged rock of disappointment that suddenly appears in his throat when he doesn't see it.  He'd told himself not to hope but apparently he hadn't listened to himself very well.
Mike regards the human with a narrow gaze.  "Are you still going to sit there and tell me you chose this willingly?"
Bobby just looks at him. Dean’s love life has never been more than a night or two with a woman. Bobby knows he has been with men even if Dean thinks he’s kept it secret. It makes sense … Dean’s ability allows him to be attracted to more than just the physical so it wouldn’t make any difference male or female. Of course, Bobby suspects that’s also why he won’t stay with anyone – he can see beyond the façade people put up for the world. What he sees isn’t always so nice, according to the little Dean says about it
”Shut up.  I owe you no matter what you say. If this is how I get to pay it back then you just lay there and let it happen.”
“Excuse me ... would you be Sam Winchester?” a clipped British accent inquires.
Dean breaks off as a green shirt drifts out of his closet.
The vampire steps into Dean's line of sight. He doesn't look like the bloodthirsty monster of a moment ago. In fact, if they'd met on a city street only a few months ago, Dean probably wouldn't have given him a second glance. Castiel Novak wears jeans and a tight black Henley with a light gray pattern swirling on it – crosses, ironically. His blue eyes are bright and an almost genial smile bends the thin lips upward. Dean watches as the creature stands in front of him, arms crossed. Castiel taps a finger against his chin thoughtfully.
"Yes, Dean?"
Dean seems to deflate into the bedding. Sam squeezes Dean’s good hand and steps away.
Dean gasps in mock horror and presses his fingers to his lips while flailing the other hand in distress.
[You were?]
Castiel regards the smug grin with annoyance. His privacy has always been sacrosanct yet now he has a
Dean is distracted for the rest of the day. He drops tools and trips over things until Bobby finally loses patience.
"Mom, that's just a --"
Inwardly, Dean crouches in a foxhole and waits.  Compartmentalizing doesn’t even
you, Sam. To him, you are worth any risk, any sacrifice - it was nothing for him to give up his life if it meant that you and Bobby were safe. When that sacrifice morphed into something else between he and I … you crushed him when you attacked the one thing he claimed for himself. He was inconsolable after I returned from bringing you home.  How can you call yourself his family?  Family accepts and loves without conditions or judgement.”
“Cas?” Dean calls softly.
The pilot, who'd ignored Dean until this point, curiously looks over at the man.  Before Dean can even draw another breath, he's on his back with a long, wicked looking blade pressed against his neck.  The sound that Castiel makes is one Dean hopes he
"Mmmm .... you smell divine, my pretty one."
again. He’s finally found someone who wants him and isn’t going to leave him. Why the hell would he ever give that up?  His entire life he’s been the caretaker but whoever took care of
Carter snorts. “I didn’t say he had to stay in bed – just relatively still.  No activity more strenuous than walking to the bathroom.  And I don’t recommend that without assistance.”
Castiel shivers. “He came upon me at the stables and claimed knowing my bent.”  He looks into his brother’s amber gaze.  “Never did I reveal such to him.  Never would I have risked all for his like.”

“I want many things.” He echoes his thoughts. “I want Sam to go to college, I want to see Led Zep live, I want a normal life.” Cas stares at him, their frown deepening.
He's been trying to keep his hope at a low simmer, because what if it's just that? Hope. False hope even? He would be absolutely crushed if he let his hopes get any higher than his head and it turned out there's no Cas.
I hope that all my friends, and I, get their happy ending, in the end. I hope the lovers get their everlasting love and I hope we all, audience included, find and create our own stories from here on out. Because, my lovelies, the story doesn't end here.
He hears Sam tell Dean that Jack is in the kitchen, he immediately goes into flight-or-fight mode. He chooses flight. "Excuse me, Jack." he says hurriedly and then darts into the bathroom in the passage.
and scratched messily at the bottom:
After dinner, they all sit around the lounge, watching whatever is on and commenting on it. There's a reverent calmness in the air, the sort of peace Dean had only ever dreamed of. He finally had everything he wanted, a good and honest job, his family around him. It all feels too good to be true.

Fuck you. Fuck you and your stupid sacrifice.
I hate that you never got to hear it, but I guess that's my fault. You deserved so much better Cas.
I need you Cas.
Eileen still hunts sometimes, but she's settling down nicely with Sam. Sammy told me he wants to propose to her soon, damn I'm so happy for them.
Blue eyes flash before him. Soft hands, holding onto his. He remembers. The lingering looks, stolen kisses, tangled sheets, hushed in secrets. The medic van. The gunfire. The blood, so much blood.
The other bedrooms, across from each other, consisted much of the same double-sized bed and wardrobe. The sheets of all the guest rooms were white.

he stops as he sees Dean, but instead of being embarrassed, he smiles wide and pauses the song. "Dean!" Dean smiles back and moves to stand inside the room. "Hey buddy, what you listening to?" Cas' smile gets bigger and he replies, "Melanie Martinez! Her music is truly good! And she sometimes sings about real issues going on in the world and-" Dean can sense a rampage coming on and he intends to stop him right there, but he just looks so
He tries to get himself together, but he's just
First: a lil background!
Maisie walks into her grandfather's room to see him sitting at the window again. He looks paler and more tired than ever, but he also looks infinitely happier, almost glowing with it. "Pops!" she goes to sit next to him. "You look happy." His smile brightens as he turns to her. "I am." he states simply. "How come?" Maisie inquires, smiling too. He goes back to staring out the window, smile never fading. "Well Maisie you see, I'm going to see him soon." he doesn't elaborate. Maisie frowns in confusion, she doesn't know of anyone that's been coming to see him. "Who, pops?" He glances at her out of the corner of his eye, but says nothing. His smile just gets bigger and he gets this excited gleam in his eyes. She leaves it and turns to look out the window too.
Eileen tells him how Dean had mourned him like a depressed widow after
Sam startles, like he forgot they were still standing in the doorway, and steps aside to let Dean in.
"Is this because of what happened?" Dean asks. Cas presses his lips together and nods stiffly. Dean curls his hands into a fist and frowns. "He can't just do that-!" "Yes he can Dean and you know it. You know he feels about- about people
Dean had just been about to get some coffee from the bunker's kitchen when he heard it. A carousel sort of tune rang out through the bunker and Dean was utterly confused by it. Why on earth was there a carousel noise in the bunker? And why was it coming from Cas' room? And then he heard it- lyrics. A woman was singing along to the carousel-sounding tune.
I deserve a break. Sammy too.

Abandoning his coffee, he went up to Cas' room to see what was going on. Cas, not realizing Dean was standing there watching him, was still singing at the top of his lungs.
he would have said it back. But then Cas was gone and it was too late.
“Dean, why are you saying this?”
Sam tries to assure him that Dean doesn't hate him and everything will be fine once he gets here, "You'll see." But nothing Sam says can assuage his worrying.
Disapproval is definitely not what is going through his mind right now, oh no. Images of him and Cas growing old together flash through his mind and he smiles. There's just one thing he needs to make sure of and his face takes on a serious expression. "And are
It's been a long day, but it is a Thursday and Maisie has to see him. So she drives out to Ocean Elderly Home. She checks in with the secretary and a nurse leads her to a small room right at the back of the Home, the one with the best view of the ocean. The nurse, Meg, leads her to the door and then leaves. She stands at the door frame, just taking in the room. It’s a small, but spacious room. Filled by a single bed in the middle of the back wall, a small bedside table holding a lamp, a small dresser against the right wall and a tiny wardrobe against the wall next to the door. Across the room from the dresser, is a huge singular window that takes up most of the wall, complete with a window seat. In front of the window is a set of chairs, in which one is occupied by a man with light grey hair and bright green eyes, gazing out the window.
As their long-life, and current, best friend I can tell you with confidence that their story has yet to end in such a melancholy way.
The two sat there for a while, in comfortable quiet, just staring at the stars and leaving the party goers behind.
Hey everyone, I won't say the ending is up for interpretation because that's rude so basically it is Cas and I might do a follow up fic on that...
The kiss is messy and mostly teeth clanking together, because they both can't contain their smiles. When they eventually pull apart, they're tearful, but smiling brightly.
Charlie smiles, its just like Doro to make ingenious plans for the future to solve their current dilemmas. "That sounds brilliant Doro." Dorothy nods and says, "Of course it is. So, should we swear on it?" Charlie narrows her eyes and says, "Unbreakable vow me, Bellatrix." Dorothy laughs and pulls a ribbon from the inside of her jacket. "Always prepared." Dorothy nods then stands up, off the seat. "Now let me just get my wand, Snape." Charlie fake gasps and puts a hand over her heart. "How dare you call me after that traitor, that triple agent death eater!" Dorothy rolls her eyes and replies easily, "Please, you love Snape more than your own best friends." Charlie grins and leans back on the window seat, hands behind her. "You got me, now go fetch yer wand Harry!" Dorothy shakes her head in exasperation and goes to pick up the nearest stick.
I know you're still out there! I don't know why you refuse to come back, everything is okay now.
his first paycheck. He told him that Dean had a house of his own in Kansas. Sam was very proud of his big brother, and so was Cas. Cas thought to ask if he had anyone, but decided against it.
He's coming to visit!! I assume for the wedding as he's bringing gifts and that's what's coming up.
Cas, bless him, just cradles him in his arms and rubs his back. "I know, I'm sorry Dean." Dean turns his face up from where its now resting on Cas' shoulder. "No, you have absolutely
Dean walked hesitantly up to the desk, cleared his throat and said "Chief." The man looked up and immediately broke into a smile. "James! What can I do for you?" Dean gave a small smile and replied, "I was just wondering if I could take a couple weeks leave?" He hoped to high hell that he could at least get a week. "You sick boy?" He looked Dean up and down, as if assessing his health. "Uh, no Chief. It's a bit of a family emergency."
He knew from the moment he quit hunting that he wanted to work as a fireman. He could still save people and if anything looked particularly supernatural, he would refer the case to someone else. He was done with any and all things supernatural, save Jack of course. So he had signed up as soon as he could.
"Hello, Dean." he smiles brightly, brighter than the sun. He stares, drinking in the sight of him. "Hey Cas." Cas stares back, taking in everything as well. Then Dean is rushing forward, and Cas is too. They meet halfway, crushing their lips together in a messy kiss. They're both laughing and crying, joyfully. They hold onto each other tightly, not willing to let go again. "I missed you!" Cas says through a watery smile. "I missed you too. So much." Dean cries, clinging tighter, leaning his head on his shoulder. "I'm sorry I never kept my promise." Cas says shakily, hugging Dean a bit more tighter. "No, no sweetheart, it's alright. I guess in the end, I kept your promise." He smiles. They laugh and lean back, just enough to slot their mouths together again, less messy this time.

He stops at the nearest café and gets himself a regular black coffee and gets Cas his usual. The drive from there to Cas' is short and within minutes he's parked in front of a rumpled looking Cas. His shirt untucked and his sweater is wrinkled slightly, like he'd slept in it.
