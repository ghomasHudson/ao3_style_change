“Precisely, and they are fantastic! They’re homemade right here in our facility,” Mary explains, “They have a small core filled with both fertility and slick hormonal coadjuvants. They will be absorbed as the shell melts from the body’s internal heat, lubing the omega as well. …with a tiny bit of ginger added to the mix. It adds an itch to the concoction that drives both parties even more wild to “scratch it”. It also helps reluctant bitches to “let go” faster.”
Resolution of the case in hand, they stood and made to leave without a single glance to Magnussen, but before they could make to the door he said: “Still stand on my opinion over the English.”
With a dissatisfied countenance Mary studies the scant wetness gathered, rubbing it between the pads of her thumb and the other fingers. “Did you notice any substantial slick discharge since the heat started?” Mary asks Mrs. Adler.
Shushing him she moves the hand already caressing the omega’s belly to the side, and with it she grips around one of the omega’s protruding hipbones and pushes down, stilling the last frantic movements of the omega’s pelvis.
That morning had begun in an excellent way. First, there were the aftereffects of an enthralling dream, quietly disposed with a lavish wank in the shower. Then, there was finding the protagonist of said dream waiting for him in the kitchen. Perched on a chair, still soft faced and sleep-rumpled, he greeted him with a sweet smile and two freshly made cups of tea already settled in front of him.
“I know, I know. I’ll be quick!” She chides with good humour while kneeling between the omega’s feet. Today John seems even more eager than usual. She wonders if maybe this omega, while playing all coy and reluctant, is furtively teasing the poor alpha with his persuasive pheromones, begging for his big knot to take him at once, like the filthy omega bitch he pretends he isn’t.
A firm, single tug at the leash reminds the omega to carry on, and he obediently follows, entering the brightly lit room right after his mistress.
The three of them walk up to the simple but peculiar breeding stand; it consists of a legless, padded metal base laying on the floor, with two fully movable sort-of-stirrups rising from both corners of its lower side.
Standing before his desk Magnussen greeted them, radiating a specious jovial attitude, which didn’t reach his eyes. John felt his hackles already rising in instinctual alarm.
She starts to unbind the omega’s limbs and John resumes his affectionate lapping over whatever part of the omega he is able to reach, once he finishes pumping another copious load deep inside the omega’s womb.
While John stood there, aggressively brooding at the duo, Janine received the call with the instruction to escort them in.
Confused by the lack of slick he even tries a couple of unconvinced licks, but quickly loses interest when the only thing he gets is the flavour of the homemade lubricant and a shudder from the omega.
After she first goes to spread the stirrups wider, with every last possible inch, she reaches down with both hands to gently pinch the omega’s folds at both sides, her fingertips sinking a little in the ripe flesh. Then, she pulls to part them completely. The lewd manoeuvring forces them wide apart, so the exposed slit is coerced into being pulled open a little.
Panting softly, he frenziedly tosses his head left and right, as much as the carabiner binding his collar to the stand allows him. Glazed eyed, the omega is dazed and subdued by pleasure. The only thing not completely yielding is the stubborn tightness of his little cunt still gripping her finger.
It’s only after Mary begins to murmur overly sweet encouragements and pet the omega’s lower abdomen that he relaxes a little, letting out short, breathy sighs. The slick is still stubbornly absent. This time the skim becomes a firm, shallow push and she is able to sink the tip of her forefinger inside the hot tightness.
“Shh. I’m here. You are OK.” John was making soft shushing sounds, trying to soothe Sherlock a little. With his free hand he grabbed the bottle and brought its rim to encircle the slit of Sherlock’s penis.
The omega lets out a surprised yelp and jolts at the short contact with his tender core. Understanding dawning in his eyes, now completely sobered and as big as saucers, they quickly rush down to glue themselves to the huge cock trying to pierce him—his breath already starting to go erratic.
Mary works to quickly stuff the tightly furrowed pucker with the two spare bullets, and start spreading the lube inside. This time the omega takes them with a jolt of his pelvis and a grunt, followed by a low, nervous howl.
Seeing his mistress leave, the omega lets out a long, pitiful howl of despair, but she is already gone without even a glance back.
A still beet red Sherlock was keeping on avoiding eye contact with him, but as he wasn’t stopping him either, John carried on and quickly unbuttoned and unzipped the trousers. Opening and lowering the two flaps, he tried to uncover as much as possible of the front of the pants.
And now they were in the man’s lair, waiting to be summoned inside his office, Sherlock, amiably speaking with Janine about God only knows what, still too much friendly and familiar with each other, in spite of all that fake engagement fiasco.
Sherlock’s posture became even more stiff, stealing a couple quick glances in Magnussen direction, his erection started to dangerously wane, so John began to gently stroke him. “Sherlock, close your eyes. Pretend he isn’t here.” He put his hand briefly in front of Sherlock’s eyes to coax him to close them.
Sherlock briefly closed his eyes in despair, his face drained of all his colour, his shoulders hunched ever more, but his hands returned to the papers over the table.
Once inside Mary crouches in front of him and pets the soft curls on top of the omega’s head. “What a pretty, big boy, we have here!” Then she hooks her left hand under his jaw, lifting it after a quick check on his already over-excited pulse point.
Maybe she has been a little too crass but it doesn’t seem to bother Mrs. Adler, who laughs amusedly.
When the omega’s toes start to curl and uncurl in an almost rhythmical movement, she escalates her motions with increasingly tantalizing stimulation. Now tormenting the engorged labia and the brightly flushed  flesh within with a more vigorous kneading, but always receding to a scant, maddening skim when passing directly over the dip of the aperture. Little upset cries leaving the omega’s parted lips at every tease.
At the beginning of the frankly negligible intrusion the omega startles, letting out a prolonged and pitiful whimper and tightens  around her digit like a vice.
As Sherlock began his examination of the papers, the magnate filled the detective’s glass to the brim. Cold water already condensing the jug surface and shortly after the glass one too.
“Before calling you I caught him riding one of the antique armchair armrests. This slutty, silly bitch was definitely drenched then, he made quite the mess. But since I spanked and cleaned him, no more showed.”
As it was immediately clear that Sherlock was going to ignore it, Magnussen reproached him with a sly smile. “Don’t be rude. I might be offended by it and decide I no longer want to let you play with my toys.”
Since stepping into the room, John never took his dark possessive eyes off the young omega, but he sits obediently still and steady. The alpha has a placid confidence developed through good training and the assuredness of a well-known routine. (Be a good boy and let the mistress finish preparing the omega, fuck the omega-bitch sooner.) Mary will be always proud of the prime example of an alpha stud breeder she has made out of him. Although she must admit that he was always quite the perfect stud, she just added a bit of discipline.
Without letting himself the time to change his mind, John took Sherlock’s right hand with care and held it tight in his left one. Ready to immediately release it, if the contact seemed unwelcomed.
“Good boy,” she says, and concludes the long stroke with a couple of firm, pleased pats over his perky buttocks, just above where his little pussy sits, inciting what appears as a pretty strong yearning cramp, going by the noticeable clench in the area and the little cry the omega breathes out. The naive bitch may still be oblivious to the meaning of what is happening, but his body is already eager, gagging to be filled and bred.
Eager to gorge himself on the omega’s untouched softness, the alpha springs up and trots toward the omega’s groin, starting to inquisitively sniff at it. He even sticks his nose between the cheeks and folds a few times to better smell the state of the heat, making the omega whimper and his skin erupting in gooseflesh.
Wasting no more time he lifts his broad trunk to bracket the omega’s torso with his arms, and lowers his pelvis to align his already leaking cook with the unclaimed slit, then pushes forward, in vain. While his glands end up hitting the entrance at the first attempt, the tip fails to breach the too-snug target and it ends slipping upward, gliding between folds and hitting the underside of the omega cocklet.
Less than two minutes later Mary is back, this time followed by the alpha, collarless and proud. With a rolling gait he goes to placidly sit in his usual corner, near the large window and not too far from the omega’s feet. From there he will monitor all the preparatory work, and as always, patiently waiting for his treat at the end.
Humming in understanding, Mary returns her attention to the clenched slit and begins to gently tease it around with the pads of two fingers: splaying, rubbing, and spanning them, playing with the inner labia too.
As he felt Sherlock become fully hard, he stopped his stroking, but rested his hand over the detective thigh, ready to resume his work as soon as necessary.  Sherlock was visibly struggling to concentrate, face aflame, but carried on with his research, “interrupted” every so often by John’s ministrations every time his erection started to subside.
“All right, you’re now all lubed up and ready,” Mary says, as she gives the omega a couple final thrusts. Then she pulls her finger out and shuffles to the side, sitting next to the omega’s slim hips.
Rage was gnawing at John, but he tried to quell it down and think of a solution. What he came up with, he didn’t like, but they didn’t have much time, and it seemed the only viable “solution” at present, or at least the lesser evil.
Picking up the first suppository, she warms it in her hand for a moment until a thin sheen of slippery lube start to melt and coat it. Ignoring the resumed whimpers of the now still omega, she briefly teases his slit with the tip, then, with a quick push, shoves it in, stopping just shy of burying all of it inside. The omega cries out while the small object easily parts the clenched muscles and nestles within.
Sherlock’s breath hitched at the first minimal touch to his genitals, his posture gone even more rigid. John in reflex broke immediately the contact hand still hovering near yet.
Noticing how, despite his fragile and dazed state, Sherlock was trying to outright resume his work, still flushed and still studiously avoiding to make eyes contact. John kept on gently soothing him with a centering hand placed over his shoulder, thumb softly stroking a sharp collarbone. Leaving it there, till Sherlock stopped trembling some minutes later.
When even a reproachful growl from the alpha fails to quell the unruly omega, she start to wonder if his anatomy really is too undersized to take John’s sizable cock unaided. Maybe in this instance it would be better to do an exception to the standard procedures of letting nature take its course, and try to stretch the omega a little herself beforehand. But before she even has the time to finish the silly thought, John takes more control and lunges to bite the spot near the omega’s scenting glands. His teeth piercing the gentle flesh in the crook of the omega’s shoulder with a firm and controlled grip, despise his rutting state—still mindful to not maim the taut muscle like a vicious stray alpha from a shady kennel would do.
Magnussen’s remark made John pause a moment. It came like a complete shock for him. What about Irene?! And above all, what about bloody Janine, whom after the break-up didn’t miss an instant to tell to the world about all the vigorous and acrobatic sex she had with Sherlock. He knew the papers were exaggerating about it, but some truth must have being there, buried among the rubbish.
Ignoring the teasing, John made Sherlock open his legs a little more, and snaked his hand lower, inside the front of Sherlock’s pants, wriggling it, till with some effort, he was able to lift the testes and push his fingers behind them.
“Sherlock, show belly!” The omega watches across the room towards his mistress, nervous, but gingerly obeying once she give a single nod for him to comply.
Once Sherlock complied, and started to relax, beginning to recover his hardness, John’s pace sped up a little. Now rhythmically sliding the foreskin over the head and back down to fully expose the shining glands to the air. Sherlock was rock hard by now, a little drop of precome already beginning to swell from the tip. “When you feel you are close to finish you must tell me,” John warned and then let his thumb glide over the glands, then sweeping over the tiny wet slit and smearing the precome all around.
If the omega didn’t catch already it means he can’t catch at all. But she’s sure that John’s intensive fucking took care to break any possible biological hesitations. No omega, not even a less fertile male one, could come out from this without pups.
Before the bright flush that has begun to spread across his chest ends its conquest of the rest of the omega’s pale body, Mary stops and pulls her finger out, leaving him bereft and crying for more. Hungry for a kind of completion he still doesn’t fully understand.
After a brief moment of startled tension the simple act of affection elicited in Sherlock,  he let go a soft sight and  mildly relaxed, following by a shyly reciprocating the hand-holding.
After all, John is her favorite, handy and loyal, and he brings in a lot of money, so it’s only right to spoil him sometimes.  An omega all for himself would be a befitting gift.
Tiny distressed high pitched sounds were escaping Sherlock, but even after many minutes lost in intense stimulation, he wasn’t able to let himself completely go. John was beginning to worry about chafing, so he decided a change of strategy was in order.
Mary smirks. “Since you seem to like him so much, we’ll ask Mrs. Adler to bring him here more often to “play” with you. Do you like the idea, eh Johnny-boy?!” She pets him on the head, the alpha responding to her words with an enthusiast bark of joy.
Trembling a little himself from the nervousness , John reached his right hand across, toward Sherlock’s lap, hoping that Magnussen didn’t plan to add new stupid rules for him too.
She takes note on how very sensitive he is, but is also a bit annoyed over how much he still needs the temper tantrums fucked out of him. It’s clear to her that he really needs a big alpha knot to teach him how to submit to his essential nature— a pliable vessel to be filled with fertile alpha sperm.
As the omega is already beginning to sober, Mary proceeds to perform the same operations as before, this time however her focus switches a little below, her fingers move to brush over the omega’s pink anus. It tightens even more under the brief contact.
““Down! Here!” Tugging at the omega’s collar she guides him to rest down over the padding. The omega follows, a bit hesitant.
John was craving to physically comfort the man he loved, and with him, himself too, but he didn’t want to risk to worsen the situation, adding to the distress of the detective with a more intrusive act, like the bear hug he was actually burning to give to him.
After an initial moment during which his lively eyes seem to scan Mary from head to toe, he shrinks in on himself a little and never strays from his mistress’s shadow all the way through their stroll across the facility.  His curiosity for the new place is evident in the roving of his eyes, only timidly hesitating in front of the threshold of the breeding room reserved for him. Once they reach it, the omega stiffens up and plants his four limbs firmly on the floor before entering, and sniffs the air with a perplexed tilt of his head.
She gets up and walks to the sink placed on the wall behind the omega’s head. After she finishes washing her hands, she opens one of the blue lockers near it, and from within she retrieves a small, white box, and a pair of nitrile gloves that she puts on at once. “The slick should return soon, especially with an alpha close by… but since no one likes to wait…”
“Oh, we have plenty of them in the other breeding rooms, but we prefer to use this one when the bitch is still a maiden like Sherlock. It makes sure alphas do not lose themselves too much in the rut, so they can see their bitch’s face and constantly check if they are only throwing a tantrum or are really struggling. Lasting damage is rare, virtually non-existent if the alpha-studs are well trained like ours, but we don’t want to take any chances, we are a professional facility.” She shrugs. “Alphas tend to work themselves more into a frenzy when they breed maiden omegas, and therefore-”
His hips busy in lazy and light grinding motions, John is knotted again to the omega, but what surprises her is to see him intent in gentling the omega by lapping his face with tender care, long wet stripes crossing from jaw to cheekbones. Exhausted— the omega lays closed-eyed and boneless under him, all the past energy and spirit drained by the alpha’s unrestrained lust, leaving behind in its wake only worn out and compliant flesh. The only clue that he isn’t passed out being the minute trembling of his eyelashes and the slight furrowing of his eyebrows.
John never missed the lecherous gazes and the not so subtle, spine-chilling “flirting” Magnussen pressed against Sherlock every time they were forced to meet him. Even though the detective always tried to stay above it, burrowed in his arrogant and cold persona, John could see past it. He could see how every single instance of Magnussen’s predatory behaviour left Sherlock rather disconcerted. What John could do to minimize any opportunities for Sherlock to meet with Magnussen he did, and when said meetings where inevitable, at least he tried to always escort him, never to leave him alone with the disgusting man.
Mary know the tastes of her customers and she caters to them even in the breeding rooms’ look. It’s the small things like these that make the difference between a reputable breeding center and a first class one. Her customers don’t seek only good pedigree studs for their pets, they pay extra for the vanity of luxury services all around.
“Sherlock, please! Give me the permission to sock this bastard fucker and I’ll do it. With delight.” Currently John didn’t mind the troubles a similar feat could cause him, if in exchange he could save Sherlock from this torture.
Disturbed from the scene, John forced himself to bring back his full attention to a very flustered Sherlock. He stuck his fingers inside Sherlock’s pants, finding them already a bit wet near the head of his penis. Tugging them a bit down, he let the livid shaft spring free, uncovering it to his sight. At the same time a shuddering breath left Sherlock’s chest.
Mary steers the omega to stay over the padding on the base, then she unhooks the leash from his collar.
Even though there isn’t slick dripping down his thighs yet, it is quite obvious that the presenting heat has already set in considerably. The clammy appearance of his skin, and the already quite rigid state of the little cocklet hanging between his thighs, are all dead giveaways of his state. Plus, there is the puffy, flushed mound of his minute sex peeking from behind with its still discrete, thin slash of bright cerise flesh splitting it in half— a promise for alphas of the lusty conquest still concealed within its soft folds.
The fingering seems to quickly coax the omega into a new state of careless obedience, and he now takes the meagre imitation of fucking with complete abandonment. His hips undulating with the rhythm of her pumping, timidly seeking to soothe the burning longing inside of him.
Magnussen began to pour the water in his own glass with smooth movements, and without even sparing a look at them and with a hint of pretended boredom in his tone, he explained: “Well Mr. Holmes, the game is quite simple: inside one of this binders there are some information you’ll find very useful for your ongoing case. You have all the time you need to peruse them, but as soon as you leave the table, the game is over and I get back my documents.”
The trap has been set carefully, as to leave no chances of winning for the detective. The game was rigged, and since the start Sherlock was a mere puppet in it, forced to play for Magnussen own sick pleasure.
John was careful to tantalize but not induce the orgasm. Sherlock was already stifling all sort of whines.
Once the first one goes in, she picks up the second suppository without wasting another instant. This time however her finger buries it fully inside the omega’s body, continuing to push both bullets as far up the canal as her finger can reach. Then she crooks it a little and starts energetically fingering the hole, pumping and twisting her finger around a few times with purpose, testing and spreading the quickly melting lube more uniformly inside.
Everything stills and hushes in a long moment of respite— John catches his breath and savours the maddening grip around his glands— the omega is frozen in evident shock from the alienness of the huge intrusion forced so unexpectedly inside of him. As soon as the alpha resume his forward conquest, however, the omega comes to and lets out a sharp shriek, followed by a long string of broken wails, while uselessly trying to fight against the violation.
“While I prepare Sherlock, you can sit on one of those chaises,” Mary says, while motioning to Mrs. Adler to pass her the leash. “If I remember correctly yesterday you told me that you’ll need to leave us soon, right?” She asks.
A little more than half an hour later, looking like nothing bad ever happened, Sherlock finally found the data they needed to resolve the case. It was a seemly negligible line buried in an ordinary curriculum (the killer’s one, according to Sherlock), which kick started a brilliant deductions string from the detective.
The magnate ignored Sherlock’s firm request for an explanation, and herded the two guests towards the boardroom, where he motioned them to sit at a long, glass topped table. In front of them, on top of the table, were a dozen big binders divided in two tall stacks, all of them overflowing with documents.
A thin trickle of clear urine begins to leak slowly from the, now soft, omega’s cocklet, pooling first in his navel, and ending by spilling lazily down from one side of the omega’s graceful waistline.
She returns to her spot at the omega’s feet where she knees and places the little plastic box on the floor, beside his pelvis. She opens the lid and picks four thumb-sized, off-white bullets from within, arranging them in a single orderly row on the now closed lid.
The alpha doesn’t relent and continues thrusting forward and retreating with quick jabs of his cock, poking repeatedly at the omega’s cheeks and perineum in a punishing hunt, his livid glands leaving behind smears of glossy precome over pale and gentle skin.
John understood and decided to take action quickly, and again started to palm the other man groin, reassured in finding the trousers fabric still dry. His touches started soft and then increased in intensity as he felt the detective’s penis gradually stiffen more under the stimulation.
John lets go of his hold on the flesh near the omega’s long neck, and licks away the scarce blood spilled, leaving an arched ornament of neat ruby indents over the omega’s fair skin.
The omega quivers, laying with his thighs forcedly splayed open and framing the sides of his own torso. The head of his tiny erect cocklet almost poking him in the underbelly, his cunt and pink pucker completely exposed, clenching and unclenching around nothing. Restless.
Turning her eyes toward John she calls him, signalling that now he can approach the omega and give in to his instinct. Doing his part of the job at last.
Before sitting himself in front of Sherlock and while newer removing his gaze from him, Magnussen directed Janine to go fetch three tall glasses, and to fill a big water jug with the bottles inside the little fridge in a corner of the room. Glasses arranged and jug positioned at the center of the table, between the three men, Janine was dismissed to leave and return to her desk.
Between thin ankles, the sweet mound of his pussy unveils. Soft folds slowly blossoming together with the parting of his white thighs, revealing more and more of the pulsing, cerise flesh surrounding the little slit of his tender vaginal passage.
She doesn’t like to force things too much in front of the owners; from experience she knows that they usually prefers to be entertained with a bit of a show, so she likes to take her time.
Mary passes a finger over the little streak of clear proto-seminal fluid having landed on the omega’s taunt belly, and proceeds to smear it all over his lips. The omega lets out a tiny whimper and start to convulse under another orgasm fit. With a smug tone she asserts, “See?! You took it as I said, and you liked it, you little slut.”
She moves beside him and proceeds  to stroke the almost translucent skin of the omega’s back, from his nape to the curve of his buttocks, noting with satisfaction how, once her hand comes to touch the place over his sacrum, the omega lets out a content sigh, his hips unconsciously tilting slightly upward, urging the deepening of the contact by instinct.
Omega now secured to the breeding stand, Mary leaves the room to go fetch John, the stud booked for this session. Hopefully the omega would use the time alone with his mistress to relax a little and get used to his bound state.
With a slow swiping of her thumb she brushes the omega’s unique cupid’s bow, then begins inserting the digit between his plush lips and slowly dragging the omega’s lower one down. She inspects his teeth and gums for any disease sign. She finds none, only healthy and soft mucosa. The omega stares at her a bit startled, but lets her do as she wants.
“Well, I can tell you that it will be worth your time. Try the whirlpool in the bath. It’s amazing.”
But today he had seen how Sherlock had looked at him, really looked at him, when he stood in front of the mirror. Obviously, it was the uniform. He also responded well to orders. The moment John got really fed up with him and yelled with his parade-ground voice, he always hurried to comply and behaved orderly.
“One drink should be fine.” He picked up his bag, Greg's bag, and followed her back into the drawing-room. Again, there was no one else present. Mycroft pulled out his card and handed it over.
“Sherlock will want details but I am pleased to hear that you had a good time with Mycroft. What will happen next?”
He elegantly stood and walked to the light. He looked more closely at the cuffs around his wrists and held them close to his eyes. He somehow caught the clamp on his left nipple and pulled. He hissed and jumped on the spot. He even swore. He normally didn’t swear but he let go of his control because he was all by himself.
“I am feeling a bit scrutinised. Why are you watching me?” Sherlock felt a bit caught out but considered the question. He was surprised himself when he replied:
“I got interrupted by the enema set. But I will get comfy now.” He smiled and sauntered back into the bath. John smiled and looked forward to later that evening.
“I’d rather be naked then.” Sherlock was pouting and John sensed a temper-tantrum. Being a little bit on the edge he asked:
“You could have said something while you were in bed. You could have asked him for more. Show him or even provoke him.” Greg carefully suggested.
“But why?” He whispered close to his ear and John felt his hair tickle him. His own hair stood up and he closed his eyes. He had no answer for Sherlock.
Half an hour later they sat inside a pub looking out over the water. Rogers had gone inside first and cleared a table for them. They kept close but not too close.
“There is something you are thinking about. Tell me, please. I want no more unsolved issues between us.” Mycroft just said.
He strained his neck and felt John’s hair tickle his lips. He strained as much as he could and opened his mouth to catch a strand of his blond-grey hair between his lips and teeth. Then he pulled sharply.
“No, I don’t think it’s necessary. What now?” Suddenly Sherlock’s mobile rang and he raised a brow. It was Mycroft’s ringtone. He looked at John.
“Get up there.” It was a woman and he climbed onto it. She checked on his long legs and seemed to be pleased.
„I see you like this. That's good. Always show me, do you understand?“ He seriously said and Sherlock nodded.
But John topped it when tightening little bells around his nipples and a feather on top of the head. Sherlock blushed and John smiled smugly looking him up and down.
“Can I assist you then? Please?” He had lowered his voice and stared into her eyes when asking. She started to sweat and the heat crept up.
“Oh, it seems to be an electric one. I see. Nice, really.” John grinned and tried several settings making Sherlock twitch and move and groan and moan before him.
They fucked him several times, both oral and anal. When Sherlock felt exhausted and hungry, they made a break. John tied the poor man into a hog-tie on the ground, a very wicked hog-tied with bound toes pulled down, an electric anal-hook leading up sending hard pulses into him and an over-sized ball-gag that made his jaw hurt. He cried and groaned when they left him behind.
He needed to stay alive. He must do what they asked of him. He wanted to see John again. He wanted to be with John again. He hated himself for having treated John so badly.
“I am sorry, Master, but I need to come. It hurts. Please? I need to come. Master, please?” Sherlock almost came when he heard this, but he held himself back by pure force of will.
“Not yet. Now I will fuck it right here. And it will behave like the perfect sub it is.” Sherlock swallowed but lowered his head quickly. The dom pushed him back and clapped his hands to get everyone's attention.
. He must speak to Mycroft about it so he could speak with the butler. Surely, he could make him change that.
“I have, Sherlock.” He pulled him closer by his hand and took some strands of his wavy hair. And then John kissed him. Sherlock stilled completely. His eyes were closed. He seemed to be shocked but then a hitched noise erupted and he kissed John back. He could smell John close again and he felt happy. He really couldn’t remember when he had felt like this the last time. Perhaps he never had.
The examination was over quickly and Sherlock didn’t make a fuss. Dr Malvin promised to share the results as soon as possible and left again.
“That's right. But I might dress you into several outfits just to show new clients the way I work.” Now Sherlock looked up.
“You are a saint, Mycroft.” He smiled up at him and spread both arms and legs to let Mycroft wash him.
Sherlock was rendered speechless. John looked smug. Their eyes met and Sherlock pulled John into his arms and snogged him senseless. John came when Sherlock touched the place behind his balls.
Perusing the omega’s smooth inner flesh, she observes, “Hmm… still seems far too dry…”, right before passing her index finger between his sensitive labia. The omega freezes— the moment when at the end of its short journey the finger glides over his slit, he lets out a gasp, and blinking furiously starts to fidget, trying to close his trapped knees.
Mary senses the change immediately; she feels the omega relax under her fingertips, the little slit letting itself be completely pried open. An exquisite hollow ellipse, receptive and ready to be appeased of its aching hunger.
When she comes back, the scene she finds makes her brows jump to her scalp, both in surprise and amusement.
Struggling with his fastened collar, which prevents him from straining his neck too much, the omega sends quick, uneasy glances toward the shorter but strong-looking alpha staring at him.
“Come for me sweetheart,” and finally Sherlock yielded and came with a half chocked cry and an aborted thrust. John’s closed fist was singlehandedly enclosing Sherlock’s glands and, with his thumb and pointer finger, holding the plastic bottle finish adherent to the penis tip, in order to prevent any possibility of spillage. “Good! Let it all go Sherlock.”
Neither of them was so naïve to believed that Magnussen could do something useful out of the goodness of his heart or compassion for the victims. The true question was what he would require in exchange for this favour.
Once they were alone inside the elevator, John turned his head to look at Sherlock. The man was staring expressionless in front of himself. To the untrained observer he could have looked like the poster boy of impassibility, but John immediately noticed the soft trembling of his hands betraying the humiliated and overwhelmed state he was trying to dissimulate.
Now Mary can see the outset of the inflating knot assaulting the omega’s entrance and slipping in after a couple of energetic attempts, enabling the alpha to bury himself fully with a satisfied grunt. An eager pistoning begins immediately. John doesn’t spare himself, pulling out to the very tip and sinking fully back in with obvious enthusiasm.
“Oh shush.” She chides, when the alpha lets out a short growl of annoyance before complying and proceeding to lift his torso away.
Mrs. Adler smiles, delighted by the compliment. “Thank you. Kate misses having cute pups around. And we already have plenty of inquiries from people interested in buying one of Sherlock’s. So why wait and force him to suffer through his heats alone?!”
Not leaving too much time for the omega to think about it, the alpha re-attempts to sink himself in, but this time he is hampered by the omega futilely yanking at his restraints in a panic induced frenzy. Whimpering softly, the omega wiggles his pelvis left and right, trying to avoid the intrusion.
A last strenuous thrust enables the alpha to sheathe himself to the very hilt with a powerful roar of triumph, knot slipping completely inside and concluding his expansion there. The omega’s cunt squeezing around the base and doing its part in locking them together. The omega comes immediately with a sequence of silent shudders, his womb beginning to milk the alpha’s knot right away. For at least half an hour it’ll be busy with squeezing and twitching around the full length invading it, periodically taking in pulse after pulse of warm alpha’s seed, every one of its little inner crevices flooded full and claimed.
“Gregory!” Mycroft got to his legs and yelled his name. Sherlock twitched curled up in his chair. By now he had managed to pull up his legs and placed his head between his thin thighs.
“Good morning, John. I'll get ready for the day. I obviously slept in. I am sorry.” But John shook his head.
He sighed, he knew his parents were for once making an effort but he wasn't sure if this was going to be best choice. He sighed, and read farther into Dr. hunter's file. She was currently a faculty member at UCSF. According to her school records, she wanted to be psychiatrist, but couldn't complete her med rotations due to tactile difficulties caused by CIPA, she settled on still pursuing her doctorate in psychology and neurological biochem. He was curious as to why she moved to the US, but her visa records wasn't available on such short notice.
John was close to cumming, and he picked up the speed of his thrusts chasing that release. He quickly grabbed Sherlock by the hips again and started to really pound into him, he was letting some rather undignified grunts loose, but he didn’t care it just felt too damn good, anyways Sherlock was being equally loud and it wasn’t like anyone would be able to notice them over the sound of the rave. John delivered one last final thrust into Sherlock before just stopping the ride out the tail end of his orgasm, he stroked Sherlock’s cock all the way through it but by the time he soft again, sherlock was still hard.  John didn’t want Sherlock to be left hanging. He stood up, Sherlock letting out a small whine when he slipped out.  John quickly found a second condom amongst Sherlock’s stuff. He roughly grabbed Sherlock by the ankle and flipped him on to his back.
“That really seemed like a fairly unethical thing to say in the world of testing,” said Molly slightly shocked at Mike’s response.
Sherlock sped up his thrusts as he felt his orgasm hit him. He emptied himself into John’s warm hole about the same time John also started cumming all over his stomach . Sherlock ran his hand through John’s mess spreading it all over John. He still held onto John as he let himself go soft inside of a fidgety John.
"Yes tomorrow morning will work out, but can we alternate between times to ensure that we capture different parts of the day," said Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson side eyed them, "you could've repaired it when rebuilding your apartment, your rent wouldn't have covered the permits needed to repair that."
Solomon opened the letter and read it. "Hmm okay every thing should be order with this letter, and I can call Dr. Thompson for final confirmation latter. Is there a size consideration?" Asked Solomon.
“In which case it became my turn,” said Wolf, “she fucking pepper sprayed me. Basically the woman had a surprising lot of weapons hidden in her clutch, because apparently the colonies are scary.”
He leaned towards Sherlock and in a commanding whisper that only caused Sherlock to take in even more breaths, “I want you to sit next to me.”
Sherlock nodded, and let John take Sherlock by the arm as they walked to the diner. Sherlock was surprised to see Molly, the girl who always snuck him into the lab at St. Bart’s there as a waitress.
All of them made their way to the chip card machines, Sherlock emptied out the content of the cart to the machine and started to try running it, it was almost going well, when suddenly.
Ella laughed, "oh, hmm let him come, I can spring a session on him, maybe he can work on the control issues he has because between him monopolizing your time and him sticking his nose in everyone's business I think he needs to get in a fight, it would be good for him.
“At this point I decided that this was the US, so it would take a hell of a time to find my sealed records, so I gave it one more time, and she managed to grab me by my hair and hurled me into a fucking Our Lady of Guadalupe statue,” said Aithne. “Which gave way to her bursting through the doors of the church.”
Sherlock was sweating and swearing as he bounced on John’s cock. He didn’t dare touch his cock because he knew the moment he touched his cock he was probably going to start cumming immediately. And he went on like that, for quite some time, because he would stop whenever he felt just on the edge of coming. He wasn’t exactly to pleased at how long he had to wear that cock ring so he might as well get John back in the best way possible. He looked back at John and smirked.
Sherlock nodded, "you can take a break if you want, I can handle them just try to stay in the area, in case I need you to come up with some fake emergency but you don't have to if you feel it isn't safe to be nearby. I just want you to be sure that our home is always going to be safe for you and Rosie."
“Oh that was brilliant John, overloading the somatosensory cortex with rapid extremes in temperature to make me feel things deeper and tricking my body into thinking I actually got stabbed,” exclaimed Sherlock, pulling John into a kiss. He smiled at John when he pulled back.
Mike stood up, “hey John, I think you need to go to the morning after clinic, since it will open in a hour and you need to meet the rest of the staff.”
The trio looked at Sherlock fairly stunned, Sherlock never likes anyone and for him to make such a comment was unprecedented.
"Of course I am, but only if you want me to. I mean I am not exactly parenting material, but I really love taking care of Rosie. It's like...I just really like taking care of Rosie and I can't really see myself with anyone but you, John.  I love you and even with all we have been through I still love you. I may not be that affectionate or even that receptive to the love that comes my way. I do know that I love you. I mean I never dreamed that anyone could love me, so this is more than I ever expected for myself. I mean I don’t know how long this can happen, but I am going to enjoy for as long as I possibly can,” said Sherlock as he wrapped Rosie up in a towel and carried her out of the tub.
Sherlock deepened the kiss, moaning into John's mouth, he wondered how it would feel like to run his tongue across other parts of John's body and allowing John to do the same. He suddenly tensed up and with a loud moan he came.  He rolled over and immediately felt the discomfort of the air hitting the wet spot on his pants.
Kayla gestured at the cake on the ground, "how do you think that got there? Toby has been trained to only bark when someone is having a seizure.”
Mycroft stomped to the side before darting the inwardly to lunge at Ella who quickly stepped to the side and parried against Mycroft. Her foil slid agains Mycroft's, the green and red lights flashed at the exact same time.
Sherlock twitched, “to be honest I don’t even know but I’m trying my best to avoid boredom because I don’t want another trip to the country side, and you look like you need some company.”
He pushed Sherlock into one of the shower stalls and John went to grab his caddy of shower supplies. He joined Sherlock in the stall still in his black undersshirt, he was slightly relieved that Sherlock didn’t ask him why. He turn on the warm water, he pulled Sherlock down so that his mouth was right at Sherlock’s ear level, “remember to stay quiet, especially now, we wouldn’t want any of my fellow soldiers finding out about you.” He gently pressed a kiss against Sherlock’s cheek before picking up the soap. He began scrubbing Sherlock down with some rather lazy circles, getting every inch of Sherlock, even taking the time to wash out the lube that was smeared all over his ass. He pressed Sherlock against the wall and kneeled down to start rimming Sherlock’s ass.
John laughed, "oh it had's it's ups and downs but yes I have to admit it was a pretty good day." He pressed a kiss into the back of Sherlock's neck.
“Where she caused hell by bursting into a fairly loud anti-Catholic rant that was dripping with racist coded language,” said Josephine. “Where my dad, the church deacon, told her to leave and she left but not before knocking over a set of flowers.”
Solomon nodded, "okay I mean all of our dogs are well trained for every kind of environment. So I can take you out back and you can meet the dogs that are currently available. If none of them suit your needs we can always help you find a shelter dog and train one up for you."
He took John’s hand and pulled out a pen from his little bag of essentials. “Hurry back, it’s 221 B Baker Street, even if you aren’t kicked out; you know you want to live with me.”
“Yes it is Irene and her wife, Kate, asking if we want to visit them in San Francisco during September for Folsom Street Fair. She is also asking who was Top or did we switch fuck? She is also asking about your cock. I am not sure how to reply,” Said Sherlock as he read his messages. “Oh there is one from my parents asking when the wedding date is?”
Just a silly little update to celebrate the fact that NHS has finally joined the rest of the world and covering PrEP. So yup.... enjoy.
“Oh she is in her mind office,” exclaimed Athina as she took a closer looked at her sister, “she does this when she has gone into auto pilot when she has to keep repeating herself. She probably working on billing codes.”
“Where are your manners?” He hit him on the back this time and grabbed into his curly hair to pull him up. Tears streamed out of his eyes when the man shook him brutally.
The soldier knelt down and carefully looked at everything but refrained from touching the victim. But finally, he looked into his eyes and Sherlock even returned the gaze.
“Listen to me very carefully, Detective Inspector.” He said roughly whispering. “Tonight, I will make you call me
And this time Sherlock not only pulled his hair but also held him down. John had excellent body control. He also was disciplined. He did not choke. He breathed when he could and held his breath when needed.
“Very good. Now line up and push. I feel and you see how wide I am. It will be tight, yes. But you won’t hurt me.” Sherlock assured John who swallowed and crept closer.
The next date was with another woman and right before John wanted to leave, Sherlock donned his coat and scarf. John looked at him pocketing his wallet and mobile.
“Mr Holmes, it’s nice to see you again.” Sherlock smiled rather thinly and held his hand in a tight grip.
“Will you tell me?” Sherlock stood and smirked. Mycroft was able to see the bruises and light rope-burns from the washing-line. Mycroft raised a brow but waited until Sherlock was clad in pyjamas and an old well-worn tee. They walked over and sat in the living room. Sherlock was still relaxed and sort of happy, so he even offered a drink.
“Here you are.” Sherlock took the mug and looked at his brother who just raised an eyebrow. He sighed and looked at John.
After two strong orgasms, Sherlock slept all through the night. He had no nightmares and felt warm and taken care of. His dom had been so good to him and he promised to himself he would behave. He would be good for him.
“Then drop this ridiculous sheet.” John dropped it and stood there all naked. He watched him and saw his flanks tremble in anticipation. It went oh so well.
He showered and got dressed. He let Sherlock sleep. He had been working hard yesterday and he had cried. He was exhausted when he had come to bed.
“No, he didn't. I think he knows already. There were several people with different cars in the area. I believe they were his. But since they didn't interfere, they were left alone.
He knew Sherlock would take his time in the bath and just climbed back into bed. On the way, he grabbed his mobile. There were several texts from Greg.
They heard footsteps and a door being opened and closed again. They quickly disappeared from the aisle and were gone when John Watson left the room. He walked towards the stairs and Mycroft lifted his rifle. He exhaled and pulled the trigger. There was no question about it. He hit him right in the middle and the bullet's force pushed him forward and down the stairs.
Mycroft helped him into his car and they rode away. He typed something into his mobile and when they arrived at his place, the doctor just drove up, too.
He had lost a lot of his strength due to the silver being used on him. In here, all the devices were silver, too. It kept hurting him without a break. And it sucked the power out of him, enabled him to use any magic himself. James Moriarty very well knew what he was doing and made this Sebastian do it for him.
He could try and call Mycroft. He surely would know the solution but that would be cheating. On the other hand, it was a challenge and John hadn’t said what was forbidden or even if something was forbidden.
Afterwards, he looked at him and let him lick his dick clean. He put it back into his trousers and wiped Sherlock's face clean of any cum that was left there. Then he backhanded him hard and made his head fly to the side.
“Show our client how eager you are to please him.” That was a sentence which triggered his cock to swell. The man was indeed very pleased.
„Feel free.“ Sherlock chose one from the wall and fastened it around his head. A wide ring-gag was placed behind his teeth and the strap beneath his chin was buckled tight. The drooling instantly started. Both John and Sherlock looked at their work.
On his way, John took a box meant for evidence and stepped up to him. He knew it would be useless to remind him that he could have sent a text for him to make him come along. Instead, he just placed the box by his side.
“I have warned you, Sherlock. Don’t mess with me.” Sherlock was pressed into the mattress and his prick suddenly became extremely interested. He couldn’t suppress the moan. In return, he felt John’s hard cock pressed against his back.
“You feel like a bloody virgin, bitch. You are so tight.” He groaned and kept slapping him while he pushed faster and faster into him. He dished out no pleasure, he never touched his prostate. He just hurt him. He shot his load into him and quickly pulled out making it hurt a lot.
“After we had been so brutally disturbed, I looked at the place where the corpse had been brought to. It was the rather large kitchen fridge. I found scratch marks on the door and traces on the ground. The place where the plastic bags are stored was disturbed. The person who had taken the body probably was alone because on his or her way out, he or she bumped against several things both in the kitchen and on the way out. That way I followed the markers and estimated where they would lead to. That I told Lestrade and left again.”
Sherlock showed his fangs. John stared at him and drily swallowed. Then he cleared his throat and very carefully stood. Sherlock watched but let him get up taking a few steps back.
“You read a whole fucking lot. You made me hard by talking about it. Are you sure you want to try all this?”
“Anthea has been given time and place for the collection. She will be joined by my most trusted man and pick up Sherlock. The moment she is gone, the troops will storm the place and every identified bidder will be arrested.” Greg looked very pleased but John looked right into his eyes.
Suddenly he heard his bedroom door being opened and turned around. And there was Ian. He wore one of his pyjamas that were quite a bit short on him and made him look funny. His hair was a mess but he looked good.
His cock stood straight up in front of him and he was so hard. He imagined being on his knees servicing John. He sucked him first but soon got face-fucked. John touched his throat and he swallowed obediently around him. John came deep down his throat making him swallow it all. He still was so hard. John went around and knelt behind him. He took his prick and told him to shut up. But he couldn't. He moaned and shifted in his grip.
“Well, it was a bit weird. His injuries aren’t too bad. He is weak and feeling sick because he had swallowed too much of Thames.” Both men grinned. “But he had a crying fit. He kept clinging to me and didn’t want to be left behind. He never reacted like that before.” John was clueless.
Mycroft had even provided lunch. John sat down with him and just waited. When they were sipping their drinks, Mycroft looked up.
Sherlock watched his brother and wondered if he should ask for another one. It was hard but finally he looked up at Greg and held out his plate with a shaking hand.
“Yes, Sir, I will do that for you. Whatever you want...” Sherlock grinned and reached between his legs to get the lock off. The cage came off without a key and John knew he had been tricked. Sherlock gave him a few strokes before he continued finger-fucking him. It took him barely half a minute until John came. He held him when taking the leather off of his body and gently lowered him down.
Of course, John still handled him roughly but that was all fine. He sometimes even enjoyed it when John let him come and didn’t hit or whip him too badly. He took care of him. No one ever had. He sighed and had more coffee when a house-slave entered the room and brought a parcel.
“Kneel!” He yelled into his ear. Sherlock was a dom and therefore didn't flinch. He simply knelt. He wanted to avoid any provocations.
He hurried downstairs and had a quick look on his way into the bath but it was unharmed. He smiled. This was his home.
“I was sad. I did it wrong. Again. I didn’t mean to upset you.” Sherlock tried to find the right words.
They entered a large bedroom with a wonderful four-poster. Sherlock was impressed. This man must be rich. He had a large house, a beautifully furnished home.
“It is not allowed to answer their questions or even look at them. It will only listen to me and my orders.”
“Sir, your brother will need shoes.” The medic simply stated and Mycroft knew he actually hadn't thought about shoes.
Sherlock had left Ian in a strop. He was angry. How could he? He wasn't stupid! He had been, yes. And he knew that. But in general, he wasn't. Not at all.
“I will pick some special blood for Mycroft as a surprise.” Sherlock drove into a dangerous part of London and John worried about their car when they left it behind.
“Yes, we will do that. When do you need to be picked up tomorrow?” He expectantly looked at him. Sherlock looked into his mobile and told him.
The ordeal was over quite soon and Sherlock remembered he was to be changed into a pony now. It was new to him and he wondered if it would hurt a lot. He never had been a pony; he only was a dog and once even a pig.
Suddenly he dashed deeper into the grounds with John on his heels. He picked up a shoe and a few metres on the second.
“Would you like some ice-cream?” He licked his lips and nodded. John brought ice-cream for everybody. He poured chocolate sauce over his own and Greg's. Mycroft looked at the ice-cream.
John tried to analyse his feelings for his slave. Even though sometimes it didn’t feel like a slave anymore. OK, he had bought it but somehow it was different. He sighed. He was even referring to it as
He stared at John who stood in front of the oversized mirror already clad in his uniform. Sherlock swallowed. He would really need to shower soon. He closed the door and slowly approached.
“Had worse…” It was everything Sherlock said and he just slept on. John sighed and lifted him up. Normally, Sherlock would protest instantly because he didn’t like to be touched.
Sherlock counted the whole time and thanked him profoundly, his voice loud and clear. The crowd cheered and clapped along.
“You are simply fantastic, Mycroft…” He roughly whispered and cupped his face with a trembling hand. Mycroft blushed and cast his eyes.
“He still wants to see me?” Mycroft asked looking at John with a hopeful expression on his face. John thought how very similar the brothers actually were. He gave him a smile.
A while later, Mycroft texted his men and they went downstairs for breakfast. Greg chose a full English while Mycroft simply had a few tomatoes, cucumbers, and scrambled eggs.
Beforehand they had argued about the Christmas Tree. Sherlock hadn’t been happy about finding one inside his living room. But he understood that John liked it. Perhaps he even needed it.
„Yes, absolutely! This is amazing! I am so excited! So many things to see, examine and look at!“ He started to hop on the spot. John looked around and saw nothing.
Greg slept without being disturbed. Mycroft even let him sleep in. He had checked his schedule and found there was nothing on.
And he knew what would be next and he was right. A plug was pushed inside his arse making him yell again and his arms almost broke his hold but he managed. Attached to the plug was a horse-tail and the hair brushed against his thighs. It was attached to the harness, too, and so were his arms on his back.
“Are you sure you want to wear one of your better suits? You might ruin it.” Now Mycroft really wondered what to expect. Unconsciously, his hand moved over the fabric of his beautifully tailored suit.
“Yes, later you may feed off me. Later as in tonight.” Then John left and prepared his blood. He had three mugs and belched again. John sat by his side.
“OK, I’ll go and get him. Just don’t get angry with him. As far as I understood, he tried to work something out with Sherlock regarding what happened to you. He was extremely upset when we met him. He even cried. Just consider what you have in him, OK?”
He watched John with several girlfriends over the weeks and he didn’t like that. The few times he brought them home; Sherlock had locked himself into his bedroom or blocked the bath for hours. John hadn’t liked that and after that Sherlock simply left 221B when John had company.
“No.” He swallowed thickly feeling his saliva pooling in his mouth. He felt awful. John saw this and handed over a rubbish bin which sat between Sherlock’s knees. He bent his head over it.
The next day Greg slept in while Mycroft had arranged his day off. He even talked to Sergeant Donovan himself and made her understand. She actually did and was glad someone cared for her boss like that. Even if it was Sherlock’s brother. She didn’t say that because she wanted to keep her job.
“It looked at the formula and it noticed something. I don’t want it to hold back. Tell me what it found. If it can do it better, it will do it.” Then he just closed his eyes and placed his palm on Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock moved closer and tried to sleep, as well. The warm hand helped and he fell asleep.
After he was done with the official documents, he looked at several pictures of Greg in uniform. They had been taken secretly without him knowing. Mycroft licked his lips. This was beyond sexy and he adjusted his cock.
“Are we expecting guests?” Sherlock asked looking at the different things John had prepared and laid out. It was obvious to him that two guests were coming over.
“I mean, have I been good enough so he booked a session?” Sherlock roughly asked and Ian handed him a bottle with water.
They walked up to the wall shielding the back-yard and Sherlock sat down leaning against it. Greg did the same. And then Sherlock explained what had happened and what Mycroft was planning to do.
“Now I am going to make you beautiful again.” And he brought the device to pierce him. He also brought nipple rings and the Prince Albert. Sherlock wondered how he would fit it through the cage.
“I am very happy for you. I already told Mrs Turner next door that you finally got over it.” She looked very pleased and walked back into her flat.
“May I put you on speaker? OK.” He did and everybody could listen to the rough voice coming out of the mobile's speaker.
He turned him on his back and placed his hand around his throat. Sherlock's eyes widened in shock and fear and his lips stood open. John tightened his grip and pulled him up. Sherlock's nostrils flared because he didn't get enough oxygen. He pressed some more and hissed out the next order.
“Shouldn't you be thanking me? Thanking me for training you properly?” John circled him again and finally picked up a riding crop. He once hit him hard on his lower back and dropped it again.
“I am glad you came, Mycroft. Come and sit with me. Please.” Greg gently took his hand and pulled him into the living room. Mycroft relaxed and sat down.
“Take this off, Sherlock. Please, take this off.” Sherlock did as being asked and placed it on his night-stand. He stood and looked at John.
John approached him and hugged him. Sherlock sighed and clung to him for a while. No words were needed.
“Shut it!” John loudly said and pressed his hands into Sherlock’s body. He could feel his bones and name them.
“Well, yes. I was a bit worried because I couldn't find you. Cook told me you haven't eaten.” Sherlock shook his head.
“Here you are, John. Freshen up a bit and wake up properly. I’ll be right here waiting for you.” John thankfully smiled and took some clothes. He quickly showered and carefully washed his hair relieving it of the blood crusty strands.
He sat up and slowly stood stretching his long and lithe body. He looked around for something to drink and found nothing. He drank directly from the tap. He padded over the floor and found his socks and trousers. He dressed into them and then John started to wake.
“Thank you for cooking, John.” He knew the game was off, that’s why he called him John. He wondered if he should try to explain what had gone through him earlier today but then decided it was too soon. John had wanted him to think. So, he estimated the time in which a proper thinking could happen.
“Sherlock, please. Come on and have a look.” He let go of his hand and led the way. John moved his fingers into a fist and back. He felt almost icy and his hand was tingling. The door was opened and an elderly lady stood in the doorway.
“You are in need of some training, slut. Get down on your knees and chest on the floor.” John dropped down and obeyed. This position exposed him even more. He really tried to hold still when Sherlock’s finger pressed inside but he just kept wiggling and hissing.
“You will wait just here. I will take care of you after I have sent our guest on his merry way.” Sherlock nodded his head. John followed their guest outside and closed the door. Sherlock relaxed just a little bit. It seemed his dom wasn't angry or upset. He must have been good enough for him. Perhaps he would allow him a nice evening. Sherlock really hoped for it, just like the one after their first scene had been.
When Jim let go of him, he made a step back watching Sebastian sway on his knees. He licked his lips and opened his eyes. There was adoration and love showing in his green eyes. Jim made a move and he stood up again. Jim stood close to him and leant against his body. Sebastian pulled him close and had his arms around him. His fingers slowly stroked over the expensive fabric of his mate's suit. He liked to do this and Jim let him.
Ian stood in front of his door and closed his eyes for a moment. Then he straightened up and knocked.
“See you soon, love.” And she left the flat. John sat down in an armchair whose back was covered by a woollen blanket.
Then he was standing on a battlefield. There were many corpses but there were also many people still alive. John felt the hunger grow while looking around.
“Let me hold your hand, please.” Ian whispered into the dark and placed his hand into the middle. It took Sherlock a moment to react. The blanket rustled when he moved and his hand was placed into Ian's. He closed his fingers around Sherlock's and held him. He didn't speak.
Right then Sherlock remembered. That had been it. When John had come back, he had been furious when Sherlock smelled of smoke. He had snatched his wrist and pushed him down on the desk. He had tied his wrists on his lower back and ripped down both his trousers and boxers. And then he had spanked him with a wooden ruler until he sobbed and cried and begged for mercy.
John quickly started the stopwatch on his wrist watch. He put Rosie down in case he needed to provide some medical intervention. Rosie went straight to the biscuits.
“Yeah the outfits and location really don’t help,” Said John bursting out in laughter. A moan was heard, John raised an eyebrow,
“He was proven wrong, Mrs Hudson,” replied John, he was holding back a laugh. Mainly because this was a rare occurrence, and he didn’t want to kick Sherlock while he was already down.
Crystal smirked, "yes, I mean honestly I don't even get why we have the court order, I mean obviously they fucked up. You would think siblings killing abusive parents with a ridiculous amount of CPS reports against them would be excused a little bit. I mean I don't think I'll  kill again. I don't know about Charlie. Maybe he would, I could see him going for a killing spree of child abusers. But I mean all he is doing now is living in a radical faerie collective, they say he is happy."
“You owe me a change of clothes before you dump me back out there okay,” Said Billy, “Also why does William have a normal sounding name but you gots a name like Mycroft, that just seems like a name that we have to make  fun of a lad over.”
To be honest, I am pretty sure that a pediatric assessment for gender dysphoria would be much longer, but I do have to deal with a lot of psychiatrist who apparently figure out a kid's transness immediately after they start doing sand tray therapy because one of the tell tale signs is burying the main figure after a moment of distress. So yup, that's where this was all coming from.
In the early day of William’s transition, he tried out different names. Sometimes, Papa and Dad would take him to different restaurants and cafes to see how it felt to react to the name. But sometimes his Dad would say something that made him think twice about a name.
Sherlock's mind decided to pause, he gritted his teeth, and nervously drummed his fingers. Toby barked and pawed at Sherlock's hand. Sherlock snapped back into the moment.
Uncle Rudy raised an eyebrow and looked at Sherlock from the rear view window, “Sherlock I know you sometimes struggle, and I understand the world must be so maddening for someone with your mind. But I want you to know that I am proud of you for the progress you made. I know a lot of people don’t say things like that to you, but you deserve that. At the same time don’f be so mean to Mycroft, he does so much for you that I think you need to show a bit more gratitude.”
Ella looked at the two of them, "okay we get the dog idea is probably a go, and hopefully it works out? Is there any other issues you are dealing with?"
John looked at Sherlock, “Okay what’s your solution?” He watched as Sherlock dramatically got up and left the flat.
Sherlock shook his head, “I want you in me.” He rubbed himself more against John’s still clothed lap.
John smiled, “okay how about this I am going to lie still, and you can explore whatever you want within reason, I’m not in the mood for any vivisection,” he paused as Sherlock laughed. “I know you wouldn’t do that, but at the same time I just feels like it needs to be stated.”
Hiram looked at his oldest daughter and smiled, “so you finally found her? I bet that is real exciting for you, I hope it goes well for you, but I swear to g-d you better not set any fires or maim anyone after meeting with her. I also hope you keep all your hair this time.”
John shook his head, "no I trust Sherlock to make terms that can benefit Rosie and me, I don't want to make it unbalanced."
"Yeah I really don't get why mother is so set on making sure one of us follow her foot steps. Most parents would be happy with so many STEM doctors in one family," said Aithne.
Ella looked at Sherlock with a bit of concern, well as much concern as one could have while maintaining some semblance of a neutral expression, "Sherlock you can tell me, I can even have John leave the room if you want."
Molly cocked her head to the side as she looked at John and Sherlock, “you know what Sherlock you have been full of surprises tonight, look at you all smiling and apologizing, I don’t know what to make of it.”
"It is kind of irrational, and I know it is a huge risk, but I can't just leave her," replied Aithne.
He opened the jar and let some of the solid oil liquify in his hand before rubbing it on the part of his cock that wasn’t already in Sherlock.
“Okay Boy, for every thing I find dirty, will count as one slap, is that clear?” Said John as he ran his hands through Sherlock’s hair.
John replied, "Well you have gotten old enough for your own room. Also I like staying with Sherlock and I think Sherlock likes me staying with him."
William looked at Papa, but started looking at his hands he tapped his fingers a few times before he softly said, “it was a gift for a specific person.”
“Okay true, selling tainted product would’ve gotten us into a lot of trouble and his creepy guardian did make us that offer we would’ve been foolish to turn down.”
“He went to a warehouse rave in East London, after that, I don’t know what else,” snapped Billy as he awkwardly stumbled out of the car trunk. “I mean do you have a picture of the guy, I mean I wasn't there but I mean I know people, maybe I can identify the man, who managed to get Wi... Sherlock to stay more than just the time it takes for him to cum.”
Sherlock turned onto his knees slightly spread out with his ass resting on his ankles, his hands resting on his thighs. He looked up at John.
William tries to be a messenger of positivity but his dad has feelings about William's ability to do as he says.
Sherlock turned to John and nodded vigorously as he returned to scrubbing the floor just as vigorously.
Sherlock, just realized what he had just done, and couldn’t stop staring at that damn Scopolamine patch still hanging off the side of his head.  He took a deep breath and in his sternest, most authoritative voice he could muster, he said, “John I want you to forget today, I want you to forget the entire contents of this Wednesday. You are going to count up to 100, take off the patch from the side of your head, and you are going to go back to Mary, and you are going to forget that this day even happened. If anyone asks, you just had a normal day okay John, you are going to forget that this day ever happened.”
“Yeah it is going to be pretty hard saying you aren’t gay with those photos flying around,” Said Sherlock.
“Are you just going to stare, private? Or are you going to get on with it?” John said with his Captain voice but chuckled at Sherlock’s reaction, he was looking at him all wide eyed and is mouth was just hanging open, almost like a kid on Christmas getting exactly what they dreamed of.  John reached into the holster pocket of his harness and pulled out a condom, he opened it, and held it over his cock. “Almost forgot that, safety first, but I bet a nasty boy like you would suck me off even without one.”
John looked at Sherlock, “Sherlock, I am in the long haul for this if you are.” He handed Sherlock Rosie’s pajamas. “And I know you have a hard time believing this is even happening, but know that I do love you, and I will keep working to make sure you can be sure that this is actually happening and will keep happening.” He helped Sherlock get Rosie into her pajamas.
“Believe me when I say it wouldn't have worked with any one else, you’re his best shot at a successful flat mate, but don’t worry it will be fun,” said Mike, “it will give you all the adventure you need.”
Kayla came back with a box, "okay Sherlock, we got Toby's bed, her toys, and a bag of dog food. She already has her vest, collar, and lead. So if anything you are all set." She handed the box to John, and pulled out a business card and handed it to Sherlock. "Here's my card, so you can contact me directly for scheduling training sessions. I prefer text message."
“Again Sherlock, just remember you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do and we can stop at any time. Sherlock, you are in control of this okay,” said John trying to make his voice sound full of assurance.
John and Sherlock sat in the back of the car trying their best to keep a straight face. They just had bail posted for them, and they weren’t quite sure who did it. They just knew that bail had been paid and the officer who released them shoved them into the back of a black sedan. They were also realizing that maybe fucking in the clinic bathroom to celebrate the fact that they both had clean STI tests, wasn’t the best idea. But they were ridiculously happy to be fluid bound and get rid of the condoms. Sherlock was a little too pleased with the cum that was still leaking out of him, John spent the last couple of days holding off orgasms to really give Sherlock what he was waiting for.
“Hey John, long time since I heard from you; someone said you were off in some foreign land getting shot at, what happened?” Asked Mike.
John nodded, "that's fine, and thank you for pushing your comfort zone a little bit tonight. It was an enjoyable experience, I hope you enjoyed it too."
Sherlock looked at the bartender in a fairly practical get up of a mechanic jumpsuit with some reflective tape. “Jeanine, I guess I’ll trust your decisions on the drink if it means less trips to the counter,” replied Sherlock. “Do you got a plug on E at this venue?”
"But honey aren't you the one who has to do most of the shooting to protect this man," said Ella smirking under her mask.
Aithne sighed, “ah yes when they all start sharing using stories which triggers someone to relapse… that is never a fun day here.”
John and Sherlock looked up there was a large group of people on the roof and they were cheering, “Hey boys that was super hot!” “if you ever need an extra, I volunteer!” “That was hottest example of safer sex in an alley, I have ever witnessed.” “Have you heard about PrEP?”  John and Sherlock both looked at each other and started bursting out in laughter.
Sherlock looked at John with a pout, “why would you even bother with politeness? People rarely return equally.
So basically when I started writing this, I was under the impression that there was a significant onus on the trainer like it is here, but apparently the UK has an intense scheme for it all.
“I feel like a naughty child being sent away.” Greg murmured when leaving after John. John quietly laughed.
Afterwards he had only gone to clubs or picked someone up in a bar but he had never been in a serious relationship again. He wondered if he should have seen the danger coming from John Watson, should have seen the signs of abuse. Was he to blame for Sherlock's pain as well?
“I am still a bit frail. I will have a salad later.” He avoided the second question because what he needed was right in front of him.
“Pick anything you like. Perhaps you would like to freshen up, too? Towels and everything are right there.” He pointed towards the bath and Sherlock happily accepted. Ian was glad he was feeling better and the moment the door was closed he adjusted his cock again. He shook his head and went back into the kitchen. He actually had enough supplies because he liked to eat fresh. He started on pasta with a green pesto and mushrooms. And he created chocolate mousse because by now he knew about Sherlock’s sweet tooth.
John was in pain. He was kneeling for hours or so it seemed. He was waiting for his dom to come back. He needed to show him how good he was, how his behaviour had improved. He didn't like to be punished for talking back.
“I'll go back to Baker Street and search the flat for Sherlock's belongings. Somehow, I don't think John destroyed them. He surely stored them somewhere. We can make up his room in here with some stuff from his home. I will also go and buy clothes for him. Clothes of the sort he never owned, like a pair of jeans, t-shirts and sneakers.”
Very slowly, the blanket was pulled down, and Sherlock turned his head to look at him. He looked totally confused. He also seemed to expect a scolding, that was the way he looked, Ian thought.
“John, what happened? What is it?” Greg asked but didn't want to pass by David. Mycroft looked worried.
“See you later, Sherlock. You know where to find me.” Sherlock didn't reply and Ian left. He was confused. And sad. He didn't understand what had happened. Again, Sherlock's behaviour left him utterly clueless. This wasn't just being a brat. This was quite a bit more.
“What's wrong?” He quietly asked. Now Sherlock lowered his head and just stood there. He didn't move and he didn't reply.
“I need to get to know you better, much better, to completely understand your behaviour. I don't mind you being you. I love you...” Ian whispered.
“The treatment, the first, is done. My back hurts a bit now but it's all fine. I am feeling well and want to go home. But no one wants to let me leave.” He pouted.
“Don't you want to know about today's agenda?” Sherlock wasn't sure what the proper answer was and his eyes just widened with a bit of panic. John felt good when seeing that.
A head harness came next that got attached to the chair, too. A force-feeding gag followed and Sherlock knew what was happening to him. It was humiliating but it wouldn't hurt. That's why he didn't fight and stayed pliable.
“I will talk to Molly personally and I will try to withdraw money. I will come with you. We will protect him, no matter what.” Now John's mobile dinged.
“And sometimes on your knees being fed? You ate out of bowls, as well, am I right?” Sherlock nodded.
“There was a terrible accident on the motorway. We could save some, but not all. There was blood everywhere, body parts. I suffered a flashback. I got triggered. I…” John shook his head and scrunched his eyes closed.
John shook his head. Had his plans done this to him? He had to cancel his plans if this was the reaction. He couldn't risk to be ashamed on stage with a fainting sub.
“I have already given the order and now wait for the result being texted to me.” They looked at each other.
Both of them knew that he could just force them to stay. He could hypnotise them without a problem. Instead, he very politely asked them, begged them, to stay behind. At the end John nodded and so did Greg.
He quickly ripped his coat open and pulled it over Sherlock Holmes’ shoulders catching his arms. They stuck by his side and he couldn’t get them up. At the same time, he hooked one foot behind his knees and pulled. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he fell on his knees between John’s legs.
“Come on, I want to sit with you for a while.” John said after he had cleared away the dishes. He pointed towards the sofa and Sherlock quickly followed him. He found his place between his dom's legs and on his chest.
“Of course, slut. It may have some more!” And the riding-crop hit him exactly twenty times, crisscrossing the welts and making them bleed.
“Well, it’s just that I am wondering how fast you had yourself back under control. I mean you suffered through various states this afternoon and now you seem to be just normal, untouched even.” Greg tried to explain but sounded rather helpless.
“Sherlock, you are a saint! And I didn't even start telling you what I found.” Sherlock didn't know how to react and just shrugged while setting up the table. Mycroft joined them and looked at the things on the table.
“No, really, you are a person who can tell a story. I’d like to hear it.” Sherlock watched them interact and was glad this worked out. He considered Greg his friend and he wanted him to be happy. And if Mycroft would be the one so be it. He would do anything to make his brother happy, too.
Instead, he concentrated on giving him pleasure. He felt their erections touching and groaned into his mouth. He wanted him to touch back but he never would. Not without being told. And John decided. He knew what he wanted before he went into battle.
Sherlock fell back on the mattress and checked his body and mind for long minutes. He took stock of everything but found nothing bad.
By afternoon, he had rolled up his shirtsleeves, got rid of his jacket and had tousled hair. That was how Greg found him calling out.
But his life, it wasn't like this. His life was different, very much so. His days and nights were filled with violence and rape. He had scars and bruises all over his too-thin body. He had been pierced. He had been forced to appear in scenes in front of a camera. He had been rented out.
“Huhu, boys. I thought you might want a snack?” Sherlock happily smiled and John thanked her. She came over to Sherlock and the counter and placed her offerings. It smelled delicious. Then she looked at Sherlock.
Sherlock cried and whimpered. Tears and snot and saliva covered his face. He had no idea how long his ordeal lasted but suddenly his throat and mouth were filled with cum. He almost choked and the man pulled out shooting the last part all over his face and neck.
“Don’t you have to go to work?” Mycroft shook his head. He could work from home later after Gregory had left.
“Hush, I am not hurting you. I just want to tell you that I am leaving you alone from now on. I just got the most wonderful tongue-lashing in history of mating. I let you go.” He took his hand away and stood above him.
“He was all by himself in the woods. The last thing I saw was a pair of legs dressed in camouflage before I passed out.” They looked at each other.
on John Watson now. Be prepared to take care of the debris.” He grinned and straightened up. Mycroft looked clueless and Greg just shook his head.
John licked his lips and finally took a bunch of fries. They finished everything and Sherlock’s hands and mouth were greasy.
He felt his balls pull up and wanted to pull him off but couldn’t. Sherlock pushed down at the same time and John stuck partly down his throat when he came. He felt him swallow his load and nothing went to waste.
“Yes, Master.” Sherlock did a quick wash and returned into the studio where his dom already held the baby-clothes. Sherlock got dressed up and this time he let his hair open. John once brushed it before he shoved a huge pacifier-gag into his mouth and buckled it with multi-coloured straps.
Several times he stopped and let Sherlock have a look. Only when his hair reached his shoulder-blades he stopped him.
By time the water moved higher and higher. His waist was covered by now and he was trembling badly. He pressed desperately against the pole but wasn’t able to push it back and out. He saw black dots and his nose was clotted. He tried to free it and snot ran over his chin.
“Inflamed? Why? Where? Did you get in contact with something poisonous?” Sherlock asked coming closer and looking him over.
“Yes, of course. But those are business meetings all over the world. This is a weekend with you and it’s very different from anything I have ever done. I completely rely on you.” They looked at each other until a grin came up on Greg’s face.
“Would you like a massage, John?” It was the only thing he could offer to make him relax. Except for the sex. But he could give him a massage with a
Mycroft hadn't expected something like this. At first, he simply looked down at his younger sibling who now slowly fell on his hands and lowered his head. All the time he sobbed and with a last heart-wrenching sound he fell to the side.
“Sherlock? What happened? What's wrong? Are you hurt?” He didn't answer him. He felt his pulse by taking his wrist. He felt his clammy skin and he could hear him sob. Now he moved his fringe off his forehead.
“I am happy in our relationship. Don’t assume things, OK? I will take our relationship wherever we want it to go. But you can’t expect me to know things if you don’t talk to me.”
“Don’t you dare and stop now.” His fingers held several strands of his hair and pulled his head to the side. Sherlock’s hands stayed where they were and he just smiled perkily.
“No, I haven’t since I had no money. And would you order? I’d be grateful…” Their eyes met and Sherlock placed his large hand on his shoulder on his way to the kitchen to fetch the menus.
John quickly walked home and back to Baker Street. The window upstairs was open and he could hear him play the violin. It sounded lovely, slow, and just beautiful.
“Yes, thanks, John, for the nice evening and your fantastic advice.” John grinned and patted his arm.
Sherlock rubbed his hands and waited for him to come back. When he did, John was wearing wide trackpants and a soft, old t-shirt. He looked great.
Well, he didn’t make it in time. Sherlock rolled over the edge and clung to the man. Both of them fell into the Thames and John swore. It was cold and Sherlock was fully dressed in his coat and everything. The weight would pull him down and he was hurt already.
„But in here you are a dom, too. You can do whatever you want. We will share this forever, till the end of days. You and me, we can do everything.“ John roughly whispered and Sherlock felt the warmth surrounding his heart.
“Sherlock? Take this for your hair.” He placed several scrunchies and hair clips on the table in front of him. Sherlock looked at them and then at John.
“I have been married for years until my wife cheated on me. She was bored because I spent too much time at the office and with Sherlock.”
“No, not at all. He surely knows what he wants and what he is doing. But no more.” They looked at each other.
“There is no reason, young man. I am here right now and so are you. Nothing more is needed today.” They looked at each other and Greg joined them.
“There you are. This way you can’t soil anything.” John slapped his cheeks several times making him groan.
“The same here.” John quietly chuckled and splashed through the foam. Suddenly his stomach rumbled and he sighed.
“My brother always took care of me. I never cared about finding a mate. I was always interested in other things such as odd criminal cases, experiments, or the newest science. When I am into something, at work so to say, I never eat. So, several times I have been close to death. That’s why I had to stay with Mycroft, my brother. He makes sure I feed from time to time. This is my first time after many years that I try to live on my own. Also, I suppose he wants me to take responsibility.”
He hurt. The silver sipped slowly into his body. The bit was made from pure silver, too, making his teeth hurt as hell. He groaned.
John continued to stroke the front of Sherlock’s trousers, he started to unzip Sherlock’s fly and let his trousers fall down to his ankles. He as now stroking Sherlock through his pants. John was satisfied by the heaving breaths Sherlock was taking. “Oh i’ll touch you but any good soldier knows being able to follow orders is essential, and you have shown that you are capable of following orders, so far, but you lack focus,” said John, he delivered a sharp jab to Sherlock's side. John chuckled at the  Sherlock stagger, and laughed more at Sherlock tripping over his pants.  John managed to grab Sherlock before he hit the ground and pinned him against the wall. “Private I am only going to give you 20 strokes, if you don’t cum by the end of those strokes you don’t get to cum at all. Do you hear me Private?” Said John rather pleased at seeing Sherlock conflicted over having such a set time to cum. “You are allowed to lower your arms now, i’ll even let you touch me, but you need to keep count.” John stepped on Sherlock’s trouser’s, “you’ll need to step out of those we can’t have you falling, it’s Pride no one is going to question you being just in underwear.”
“Oh g-d yes, keep going, I want to fucking feel you always,” shouted John. He was moaning loudly occasionally letting out a grunt when Sherlock managed to deliver a hard thrust to the perfect spot. He started yelling when Sherlock lifted him by the hips and rolled them onto their side as Sherlock continued with his hard thrusts as he wrapped a hand around John’s cock. Even though it didn’t seem possible, John only got louder and Sherlock was just as loud as Sherlock delivered log strokes to John’s incredibly large cock. Sherlock was constantly changing his grip on John’s cock occasionally swirling a thumb over the head of his cock or running apply pressure to some of the veins with each stroke. John was pretty sure that they were loud enough to be heard in the whole building and maybe even the street. Yet It didn’t really matter because Mrs. Hudson was visiting her sister and brought Rosie along with her because her sister absolutely insisted on meeting her “honorary grand daughter.”
John stared at Sherlock, slightly shocked but incredibly amused. He broke out into even more laughter. “How about we start with a round two and see where it goes?”
“More Sherlock, I need fucking more,” begged John. He tried to push himself up a little into a position that would make what he really wants.
The Pup had managed to get so overwhelmed and frustrated from the lack of stimulation that he eventually passed out into nap mode. His Master knocked him over and stood over him, he knew just what he had to do to his naughty Pup, and things were about to get rather knotty.
“Don’t worry, I just want to actually feel you, and I can’t feel you with all of the padding on my chest,” Said John as he leaned forward to remove the shirt, he was wearing.
And well he did violate the no overnight guest rule and he saw that one cranked up too many times to an eviction.
Mycroft nodded in acknowledgment, "okay we'll handle the question at a later date, and I'd say it was a good night but things went wrong."
“Oh a ‘no’ that’s understandable, I see how that would be frustrating. Okay, boy, I want you to lie across my lap, face the mirror so that I can see your pretty face. Since this is our first session that isn’t pick up play, I am not going to use any impact toys, just some good old fashion over the knee spanking. Remember it is 10 strikes for the mess on the floor, 1 for the greasy counters, and that is being doubled for the refrigerator incident. So 22 is the total count. Do you think that is fair?” Asked John, while watching the mirror to see if Sherlock appeared to be listening. He smiled as Sherlock nodded and scrambled to flop across John’s lap rather gracelessly. While gently rubbing lazy circles into Sherlock’s ass, he emphasized “I want you to keep count, after each stroke you are going to thank me okay. Is that clear?”
Solomon nodded, "okay, I think all of them are fine with that, but Bosco might need a bit more play time because he can get easily bored and that's when he goes into the food, but when he is on the clock he is a good dog. Maybe we can have Sherlock be the deciding factor? Shall we go out for a walk?" Bosco, Toby, and Bopper all looked at Solomon enthusiastically.  Solomon rolled towards a closet, that Golem opened for him.  Solomon whistled and pointed at a shelf, Golem reached up and pulled down a box. He clicked the clicker four times, and Bosco, Toby, and Bopper lined up. Solomon pulled out some blue vests that said "service dog" on it and placed one on each. He fitted each dog with a vest and a lead and handed all the leads to Sherlock.
“Afghanistan, how did you know?” Replied John, he was growing more and more interested in the man the more he talked.
"Well he is going to have to play some part of this, because this is a family wide effort and he needs to see Eurus as a person and not a prisoner or an asset," said Violet. "Anyways it might be good for you as siblings to give it a try to learn about each other together in a new environment."
William nodded and grabbed his Papa’s hands, “hurry I want to get done with this before dad needs the kitchen for dinner.”
“I’m not going to be petty about it out loud, but I am certainly going to remember it,” said John with a smile. He walked up the steps to 221 b only to find Sherlock sunk down his chair deep in thought. John gave Sherlock another fond smile.
“You know for someone who always says that they prefer to be alone and says you don’t have friends, you got some dedicated emotionally invested watchers right there,” said Mrs. Hudson as she opened the door to her flat.
John handed Solomon the letter from Ella. "An apartment, we live on the second floor but the apartment itself is 2 floors as well," said John.
Sherlock was basting in the praise, it was pretty obvious that this was a man who was always brilliant but never received much credit for his brilliance. “Do you realize you are doing that out loud?”
John woke up with Sherlock’s head still in his lap, the sun was now low in the sky, and his mind temporarily drifted to ideas for dinner. But of course, his cock decided to take the wheel. He was amused that Sherlock was just nuzzling his crotch like it was his favorite pillow. He was reminded of how they started all of this, a few months ago when he found Sherlock in a pup hood and John took the first steps toward breaking that barrier of firmly not touching each other. Yet, when that barrier was finally crossed, it was like a dam was burst and nothing was going to stop it. Sherlock was absolutely voracious when it came to his sexual appetite since him and John started all of this. He highly doubted many people went from virgins to being able to take a fist and a cock up the ass in just a matter of months. Sherlock told John that he was making up for lost time.
“Thanks a lot John, you just had to be a total cock!” was heard from the end of the alley, Mike came rounding the corner. He looked looked absolutely frantic, he threw a sweatshirt at John and a pair of light blue boxer briefs at Sherlock. “Of all the alleys you could’ve picked it had to be the one next to the party full of all the sponsoring agencies and companies of our program. You couldn’t have waited till you got to the apartment! The snapchat story of this party is mostly pics and video of you both hooking up. John you might as well go into Infectious Disease as your new specialty because an incident like this will follow you around but you’d probably win the trust of many a client because obviously you are not in a position to judge.”
“I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid,” shot off Sherlock in rapid fire.
John relieved the pressure as soon as Sherlock stopped wiggling and he went back to running gentle circles into Sherlock’s ass. “Okay Boy, we are half way through your punishment, if you get through the second half of the punishment without any wiggling, I’ll let you cum immediately after. But if you wiggle, I am going to leave you on the edge of cumming until I am done with all of your holes.”
John didn’t know what to do, he went up to Sherlock and wrapped an arm over his shoulder, “it’s Sherlock and I would suggest you go apologize to Sherlock before I make you apologize.” He smiled as Sherlock leaned into his touch, he tried not to make the smile too noticeable. He did have to look intimidating to the big hairy leather man after all.
"I dare you to post it on YouTube," joked Aithne "I mean just the twin factor makes it gold, but the fact that it is Sherlock would probably bring on so many views."
“Tell me where you want me to cum Sherlock? On you or in you?” He said with a hard thrust into Sherlock, causing Sherlock to gasp, and grab onto the sheets, his cock dribbling out even more fluid.
“I am not about to piss the bed,” Replied John. “Why would you even invest in water proof sheets?” He felt Sherlock awkwardly shift. “Let me guess you want to see me take a piss.”
"Okay how about Danny gets a raise because you are really pushing "other duties as assigned" for him as well, and we both get one week long vacation guaranteed a year," replied Andrea.
John frowned, "Sherlock, I am never going to be bored with you, when you were gone, I wasn't really living. I was lost without you and the life we had together, I was almost back to how I was before I met you. I am pretty sure your brother snuck in and stole my gun at some point because it was only after you returned that I was able to find it again."
And the fact that Sherlock let out a muffled moan and sucked at John’s fingers when that happened meant they were going to have to explore that a little more.
“So is Blaze co-parenting all of the kids in that house or just Wolf’s kids?” Asked Hiram, still slightly confused at the family dynamics of his children. “I mean does that make me a grandparent, I mean honestly i’d like to know, because i’d like to know just how much Christmas shopping I need to do and how many college funds I am going to need to set up. Lord knows your mother isn’t thrilled with any of this, but I mean that's why I have been trying to get the divorce so that I can freely handle the funds. I mean I am definitely glad she didn't get spiteful with the money before most of you got control of your accounts, again sorry, Athina, I am ridiculously sorry I couldn’t hold off until you were thirty. Setting up the college accounts are best done at birth, and Blaze’s kids are already 7 and 9.”
“Sherlock why would you need scopolamine patches? They only give that to really bad nausea and motion sickness,” inquired John, as he placed his arms down after they were gently nudged down by Sherlock.
"Okay how about we just all agree mistakes have been made and that we can't change that, but we can change how we move forward," said Siger
The man struggled but he was pretty easy to take down and it made sense, his pressure point did involve him needing to get into the study for one of the new HIV drugs. So really, Mycroft knew the sack was a bit of an overkill, but he couldn’t be seen as soft should he be caught. It was already bad enough that people had a problem with him because of Uncle Rudy taking the obvious shine to him, and it really wasn’t just because they were family. Mycroft already proven to Uncle Rudy that he had the ability to the work… after all you can’t exactly be soft and do what they had to do to keep their family safe, sacrifices needed to be made after all and that was why Uncle Rudy was so willing to turn his head away from all the co-ordinating Mycroft was doing to ensure that Sherlock wasn’t going to be getting his hands on drugs anytime soon. Because Mycroft knew his parents couldn’t take loosing another child. Mycroft tossed the young man fairly unceremoniously into his trunk and drove to one of the many warehouses he used for scaring people into action.
Sherlock frowned when he turned it over seeing scratches at the charging port as well. “Mrs. Hudson, do you consume any substances outside of your herbal soothers, in particular alcohol?” He handed Mrs. Hudson her phone back.
“Well we both have reputations to hold, but can we just go without the sack,” Said Billy as he stepped into the trunk.
"And you seemed to have a seizure while trying to get out, you couldn't help it, I am okay, you are okay. There is no permanent damage. Like I said it's all okay, we are fine, and I'll get a non-slip mat for the tub as soon as possible. Better we find out we need one with us than with Rosie right," said John as he stretched out his arms inviting Sherlock into a cuddle.
Violet and Siger nodded their heads enthusiastically, and Violet replied, "okay Sherlock darling, just call us or text us when you next want us to come over, we will be in the city for the next couple of weeks because we have some business in the city that we need to take care of."
John was walking down the hall to the emergency clinic. When he got the text, “meet me at the toilets on the 2nd floor?” He blushed, and responded, “it will take me 10 minutes to get to the clinic and probably 30 minutes to introduce myself and get to know all the staff. That leaves me with 20 minutes.”
He remembered talking to the couple and in particular, the husband who was the human pup. The pup said that their experiences with Pup Play didn’t even have a sexual aspect. It was more of a matter of just diffusing all the stress caused by the constant bombardment of new info that his brain could barely manage to process. The pup said that putting on the hood and entering the mindset of a pup managed to quiet things for a bit. Which Sherlock found to be a bit appealing, after all his past drug use was mainly propelled by the urge to dull the part of his brain that was constantly analyzing the world around him.
“Yes, but pretend I didn’t say anything,” Said Mycroft brushing himself off. “Actually just pretend this meeting never happened. Pack up, I’d offer you a ride but he would accuse me of meddling.”
Sherlock handed John his phone, “so are you still interested in the flat?” He wasn't trying to show it but deep down Sherlock hoped John would say yes to the flat, he also hoped that John would also be amenable to other activities. Those activities involved the safer sex kits in his pocket, it was fairly rare when people told him no when it came to him coming on to them. He was amused to see that there was a black and white checkered hanky tied around John’s neck, the orange hanky in his right pocket, and drab green hanky sticking out of his left pocket, Sherlock had a fleeting thought of ‘finally a verse who is top leaning and a military man top, who is also open to suggestions AND they play safe’. It was like Scruff Christmas for him... who was he kidding it’s a Pride festival, it’s like the high holy day of cruising apps.
Joey looked around, “so you know the scene that Moira caused at your wedding,” he gave a look at Josephine and Scott.
Solomon returned with Golem, and handed Sherlock two envelopes, "one is the paperwork for Toby, and the other is a receipt for proof of donation for Mycroft."
The divider rolled down, “if Mycroft is a drama queen, I must be the empress of drama,” said the older man John didn’t recognize.
Sherlock smiled back and got off of John’s lap, he removed his leather jacket, and started tugging John into the direction of his bedroom, “let’s not accidentally mortify Mrs. Hudson with our ventures,”
“Yeah... part of me thinks the older man is giving Sherlock some sort of reward for eating and I am pretty sure it involves the fact that the older man’s hand is currently on Sherlock’s lap… excuse me but I think I am going to have to remind someone that they are in public,” replied Molly, she never liked telling couples to stop because they always got so defensive at this hour. Yet she was not in the mood to be cleaning up cum from play she had nothing to do with. It really isn’t one of those things you can ignore and leave for the next staff member, there was the concern for basic decency and sanitation. No one needs to see that while eating. She sighed and approached Sherlock and John’s table and saw that John was only holding on to Sherlock’s thigh, so not as bad as it could be. “Is everything all right here? interrupted Molly, she could hear John whispering a number into Sherlock’s ear with every bite he took.
Mycroft gritted his jaw for a beat before responding, "Mother, I can assure you that every citizen of the U.K. Has to live with some level of surveillance. This is perfectly normal."
Violet and Siger both looked at Sherlock and John’s joined hands as they took seats on the couch under the spray painted happy face. They smiled and at almost at the same time, “is there anything Sherlock that you wish to share with us?”
"Yeah that's kinda gross," said Blaze rolling his eyes. "Does it bother you because while your body cannot feel pain, your ego is ever so easily bruised."
Scott laughed, “Josephine, that is a good question,” he draped an arm around his wife’s shoulders. “I am going to have to make an executive decision here, Aithne, Athina, Francis, Dad, and Blaze when he comes back from his little strop, we are not going to talk about the scene in front of the kids. I mean I don't mind if we have people from the scene coming around especially given that some of us are already co-parenting some of the kids in poly families. It would be impossible to separate the aspects but oh boy do I not need the term ‘daddy’ being weird for my kids to use.”
John offered his hand and Sherlock took it, "Sherlock I am going to stay here with you, but thanks for giving me that option."  John squeezed Sherlock's hand tightly and smiled. He turned on the kettle. Essentially setting the clock on a time to return to the awkwardness in the sitting room.
"Tuesdays it is," replied Crystal and they opened the top 5 files, okay it looks like they are all in the same hospital. Do you want them back to back or do you want a break between each one?"
“Do you really think so little of me? You did just imply that my use will literally kill you,” snapped Sherlock.
John grabbed one of the cakes, “don’t hold them both and expect her to make a choice, she might expect both of the cakes to be chosen.”
PrEP is indeed a pill that one can take every day to prevent HIV by 99% but that is if and only if you take it every day. The average drops down to 90% if you are missing 1-2 pills a week. So far the only conversion that happened with a 100% daily adherence participant was someone who had a primary partner who was not taking his meds regularly so his partner's HIV, was one already resistant to PrEP. But yeah I can talk about PrEP all day.
Basically the entire group of siblings were all just in a minivan driving on a winding road with the driver playing tug of war with the passangers. The navigator riding shot gun is just trying to make sure the occupants of mini van is trying to ensure everyone has what they need while trying to keep the van on the road and heading in the right direction. Which was a fairly funny way of putting things because the time the siblings realized something was off about their family life was the day their mother insisted on taking them all to Blackpool at 3 am. It was a week after Aithne returned home from the farm, she was fighting her mother tooth and nail over every little thing and she refused to let her out of her sight at any given time. Athina the surprise baby, was only 6 months old. They weren't too sure where their dad was, but by that time they all knew that if their mother wanted to do something ridiculous, it was just easier to go with her than argue.
"Why does things have to change?" Spat out Mycroft, he stood up and picked a seat even farther away from his parents. He sat with his legs crossed and gripping at the arm rests slightly, leaning forward. Mycroft noticed his father copying the same body language, he laughed internally, Siger might be aiming to subtly open his trust. Mycroft knew that trick.
John sighed, “We set the mark for these things Sherlock. People are often times more willing to be polite to other folks being polite.”
"No Mycroft there is no position in the world that needs persuasion like that," snapped Violet. "I swear Mycroft, I am starting to feel like you actually like hurting your siblings."
He reached over to the end table and grabbed some lube. He drizzled it over his fingers and let some drip all over Sherlock’s ass. He started to work open Sherlock’s hole and was pleased at how much Sherlock’s body was willing to take him in, he looked forward to plunging his cock into Sherlock’s warmth. He shoved Sherlock off his lap and on to the floor, he paused for a moment and was about to be very concerned when he realized he made a miscalculation on how high they were off the ground. And was slightly embarrassed that he pushed the lanky man who was essentially a human puddle at that point off a rather tall bed, er maybe he didn’t even try to brace his fall sometimes that helps. He peered over the edge of the bed at Sherlock. And mildly panicked at how still Sherlock was on the ground.
Kayla came up to them, "okay Sherlock, Toby. That was a fantastic. You are working together rather well."
John admired his work, he had his Pup suspended upside down and the tunnel plug was still firmly in place. He was amused at just how dead to the world his Pup could be in moments like this. He for a moment wondered if they went a step too far, and wondered what the folks who owned this cottage would think of their activities, but judging by the fact that the shower and every single toilet had an attached showershot and enema kit and the sheer amount of anchor points and soundproofing. This place was built for such activities. He hoped… it would be really awkward if this turned out to be some kind of murder cabin. He was sure his Pup would have figured it out by now if it was a crime scene… also the Pup did say that this was supposedly listed on KinkBnB. He pushed the moment of pause far away from him, as he decided to push through to the next risky act. They both had agreed everything was yes until no after all.  He pulled out the tentacle probe, it was 4 feet of silicone with suckers along the length. He rubbed his Pup’s stomach, which was the smallest it had been in the past couple of days. He slowly started to feed the tentacle into the tunnel plug, with each inch he could see his Pup’s stomach expand. He smiled and rubbed the developing bump. He would take a few moments to check on his Pup’s wellness before feeding his Pup’s hole with more inches of the tentacle. He smiled smugly as he got all four feet into his Pup. He lightly traced the ridges in his belly bulge with his finger, and smiled. He followed the trail with some light kisses. He heard a whimper.
John ran after his dad, and tackled him knocking the knife out of his hand and down a storm drain. John knew he was a smaller man than his dad and despite being a compact mass of muscles through rugby his dad was still stronger. He held on as best he could but his dad managed to pin him down and rained down on him a large amount of blows. He swore he could hear someone calling his name. But couldn't see anyone but his dad, Harry was long gone, John hoped she got to a better place. He could hear a dog bark but he didn't know where it came from, did something just lick on him... he opened his eyes.
He turned to Sherlock who was staring at John absolutely speechless. John laughed and pressed a soft kiss to his open mouth.
Molly Hooper, one of the folks who worked at the forensic lab of St. Bart’s, stepped up to the testing RV. She called out, “hey Mike, if you are already friends with a person can you still take their test?”
“Okay the numbers talking to you is helpful at work but is helpful outside of work?” Asked Aithne as she inched closer to her brother.
He noticed that his Pup had woken up again, he crouched down and looked his Pup in the eyes. He smiled and kissed his Pup on the snoot and brushed away some tears. “You know what I think you have been a Pup for far too long, and I miss the pretty sounds you make,” John pulled off the pup hood, “boy.”
Still William was not happy with the situation involving his documents, but his dads were on the case. William overheard Papa arguing with Uncle Mycroft at Christmas Dinner, “It’s just data on some form, Mycroft, you are the British Government, you can change one little name and a gender marker and no one will blink an eye. You can do it from your laptop.”
“I really want to taste you, I want to feel you coming down my throat,” Said Sherlock burying his face into John’s clothed chest, the dog tags making a noticeable noise. “Let’s get tested, and on three months do another round of confirmatory tests that proves we have been monogamous, and then let’s do away with the condoms. You got my attention, I find you extremely attractive, and we are going to be sharing financial responsibility, the only thing missing from this formula is time. And I mean if these past couple hours keep up like this, you are going to have me for an awfully long time. Let’s get tested.”
So... in writing this I learned that the United States of America has a significantly fucked service dog program when compared to pretty much every where else. I mean yeah I got friends with seeing eye dogs and others with balance or assistance dogs. But they didn't have to jump through as much hoops (unless you count the financial hoops) that disabled folks in other countries do.
John stared at Sherlock slightly taken aback, "Oh g-d yes," John got up and started heading to the bath room. He turned on the faucet, started running a hot bath, he poured a ridiculous amount of bubbles, and got in. There was a thick layer covering the surface.
Sherlock bounded down the steps faster than John, and as john got closer to the bottom he saw sherlock darting out the front door. John was a bit confused, he really wanted to spend some time with Sherlock. John sat on the sofa a bit perplexed at what just happened, with a twinge of feeling rejected kicking in. But the door opened, and Toby came running in along with Sherlock.
Which made John feel a flash of panic but immediately pulled the hood off Sherlock and waited for him to catch his breath and stop dangerously flailing before unstrapping Sherlock and pulling him into a hug.
John started laughing, "Don't you get used to it, that couch already has the starts of an indent in your exact shape."
When he was satisfied with just how flustered Sherlock became. He grabbed both a hot blade and a cold blade and pressed them together in hopes that they were close enough that Sherlock’s brain would read it as one blade. And he held the blades over Sherlock’s thigh near where the initial cut was made and he raised his hand slightly and then pushed into Sherlock’s skin as hard as he possibly could. John could hear a muffled scream, and he saw Sherlock’s absolutely explode with an orgasm. But he heard the three sharp taps that was their non-verbal safeword.
John returned the smile to the best of his abilities despite being rather annoyed at being left in this situation.
Sherlock nodded and started to struggle with his belt and zipper, but eventually he got it. His tried to stroke himself through his pants and he gasped, and pulled his hand away it was too sensitive.
sink more into Sherlock’s hole. He took a deep breath as John fully entered him slowly, it felt like his body was just pulling John in. He bucked slightly to urge John into moving, which caused him to feel a whole new round of sensations that left him gasping.
Ella replied, "yes, also let me pull up the paperwork for a service dog, that way you can get on the list as soon as possible. And do you want me to sign an ROI so that you can bring it over to Daniel, if you decide to see him?"
Mycroft looked at them, pulled his appointment book closer to him, flipped through the pages. Stopped, pulled out another looked through the pages of the one and repeated the process for a few more books. He turned to his parents, "it has been 2 years since any credible threat came your way, otherwise for Sherlock 2 weeks, but that was more of a potential relapse episode that he avoided by changing the park he was going to take Rosie to, he saw some folks he used to use with, wisely he went in the other direction." He went to take another sip of the overly sweet tea, he got up and added more tea to his cup to dilute the syrup concoction in his cup. His parents stare at him. "I know the polite thing to do is offer you both a cup of tea, but I have learned a long time ago, not to offer people a hot cup of tea during a tense conversation in this office." He tried to laugh, but it got stuck in his throat.
John noticed Sherlock was drifting off a little bit, he grabbed Sherlock by his hair, “pay,” John shoved the full length of his cock into Sherlock’s mouth, feeling little resistance as he pushed down sherlock’s throat. He pulled back till it again the tip of his cock rested on Sherlock bottom lip, “attention Private!” John thrust the full length of his cock back down Sherlock's throats as if to punctuate each syllable. He held Sherlock's head down, his cock buried down his potential flat mate’s throat. John looked down at Sherlock and smiled, Sherlock was looking at him completely in bliss, he was not struggling against john’s grip. “You are choking on my cock right now and you aren’t even struggling. Private you either don’t care about living, stubborn, or too stupid to live when your body is telling you you need to breath.”  There was long strings of spit already dribbling spent the sides of Sherlock’s mouth, “boy I bet you won’t even breath without my permission at this point, you’re so far gone.” He felt the urge to push Sherlock a little further, he was curious to see just how far Sherlock was willing to go in this situation. He lowered one hand to stroke Sherlock's long neck, he gasped as he felt how much Sherlock’s throat contracted around John’s cock. He jerked Sherlock off his cock, “breath,” he ordered.
“Brilliant,” said John, he realized he hadn’t stopped smiling at the entire time he was I Sherlock’s presence, it was the longest time he smiled in quite some time.
Irene laughed openly, “you know what, I might just give you one on the house just let me find Kate, to see if she is okay with it.” She pushes back Sherlock, her coat rubbed against Sherlock in a way that felt wrong, he started downing his drinks in hopes of getting to that point of intoxication where that sensation would be okay. He finished both drinks rather quickly to the dismay of Janine.
Sherlock watched his son go up to his room, and eventually heard some rather loud music being blasted. Sherlock figured that he could restart the little adventure, as long as they stayed in their bedroom. “So Captain John Watson, will you surrender that booty or not?”
“Thank you Daddy, I love you too.” Sherlock leaned against John and jumped a little bit as he felt the shower shot enter him again. He winced as he felt himself fill up with water again, but he held it in for as long as he could before letting loose again.
Kayla laughed, "aww I can already tell y'all a hella fun bunch, this is going to be a great couple of weeks." She turned to Mrs. Hudson, "I like you, you remind me of my mom, she always be  trying to get my big brother and his husband to admit they were a couple, but like they were like best friends since childhood, and you know toxic masculinity is a thing, so like they were 30 by they time they got cuffed. And they kept saying they weren't like that, but mom kept finding them doing couple stuff like all the time. She one time got out her camera phone and took pictures of them napping because they feel asleep cuddling. Like half their wedding slide show was pics taken by our mom. She also has a soft spot for lotto scratchers, like the car is always filled with that scratcher dust." She smiled to herself, "ugh sorry for the overshare."
For weeks, William used the name and loved how it fit, eventually he used it every where. Even the folks at school knew to call him “William” but his peers refused to accept the new name and when his dads talked to the school, the school said, that it wasn’t their responsibility to make sure other kids treated his son nicely. So Papa exposed all the secrets of the school administration, and quickly got him enrolled in a new school, one that William loved so much more than his old school.
Ella looked at Sherlock wide eyed, "so is there any kind of business you don't have someone who owe you a favor."
John chuckled, "looks like we are going to have to move this to where you are lying down and not going to topple us over. But I do love your enthusiasm."
This ficlet was inspired by this post. https://kitten-kin.tumblr.com/post/190717018495/okay-but-john-making-dad-jokes
Kate laughed, “wait Clara with that one girlfriend who suffers from hardcore internalized homophobia or Clara the baker whose on again off again date mate is vegan is incredibly judgmental of us all who partake in animal byproducts or the Clara who has that super intense on again off again relationship with that one alcoholic who argues in the bar..”
Sherlock cracked a small smile at John’s words before descending deeper into his mind palace to re-examine his observations and how changes in built materials have rendered some of the observations obsolete.
"Hello Mycroft," greeted Ella, "welcome to our home, I am sure you have all kinds of questions, and between Andrea and your brother I have so much to talk with you about. So you can keep running and we forget all about this, or we can do a little wager to set up who gets to ask the questions and who has to answer."
Mycroft whispered "you didn't like that I told you no on reducing the surveillance, so you went to mummy. For that I might as well come up with new ways to keep track of you."
But oh boy if any of you all learned anything about PrEP or PEP please say so because I want to justify to the agency that doing a dirty fan fic battle would indeed count as a public health education event. But basically I just want to see what all the folks at the different agencies would be willing to send in.
"No we figured that out, I'm on Grindr, Frances had Scruff until he met his husband and they decided to go monogamous, with exception of occasional threesomes, Scott has Recon when he feels a bit poly and he gets the okay from his wife, and dad has Craigslist and occasionally Growlr," said Blaze as if he was convinced that it was the best possible solution.
"I mean if it makes you feel better it is in a gun safe when not in use and totally out of reach from Rosie," said John trying his best to sound responsible to Ella.
John started to deliver slow, long strokes occasionally changing angles until Sherlock arched his back and gasped rather loudly. Finding the right spot he started to thrust into Sherlock a little bit faster, he smirked as Sherlock gasped. He pulled out completely and added more oil, he pushed the solid oil into Sherlock and was a little fascinated with watching it liquify, but when he was satisfied with the amount of lubrication, he once again lined his cock against Sherlock’s hole and immediately started pushing in. As he is thrusting he decides he wants to get closer to Sherlock, so he grabs Sherlock’s ankles and hitched them over his shoulders essentially folding Sherlock over, he shifted his hands to grip onto Sherlock’s hips. It once again changed the angle which left Sherlock absolutely breathless but throwing his head back in pleasure, John delivered some playful nips to Sherlock’s exposed neck.
He quickly called Willow, “Hey Willow, don’t get mad, what’s your legal name and your birthdate? Thanks!” William quickly opened the only file in the entire system related to Willow’s name. He quickly found the part of the record where it said, that Willow’s parents didn’t approve of the blockers and changed the answer to her parents giving approval.
Mycroft walked around his library and pulled at a precise sequence of books revealing a hidden drawer. He sighed, he always hated the leg work, but he wanted this to be done with as little people as possible knowing, because as much as he hated to admit it. Anthea was right about how getting ella's notes would betray the trust of many of his colleagues. He pulled out a kit for lock picking and a few other gadgets that broke codes and disrupted signals. He donned an outfit that made it easy for him to blend into a crowd while hard to be seen, it was also made for ease of movement in case things get really hands on.  It took him forever to find a shoe that matched his desires for style while serving practicality. He decided to opt out of getting the driver to take him there, and looked at his garage, he didn't drive it for quite some time, he had a decent personal car that was average and forgettable. Well he had other cars too, eye catching cars that people envy but that's for fun, not work; the ugly, little late model hatchback that people just ignore was perfect for times like this.
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock with an audible pop, he winked at John as he took a step way to his bedroom.
I'm not going to lie, I really don't know much about fencing other than in high school I used to sit in on a class because the girl I really liked was on the team. Boxing and cane fighting was the things I was trained in but like technique is not my strong point.
Aithne was on the floor staring at her brother rather confused as to why she was on the floor. “What the fuck man?”
"Of course My that is a huge achievement. And we are for the most part proud of you, sure you could've handled somethings better but we didn't exactly set you up for success when it comes to interpersonal matters. We realize now that while we like our solitude, it was not exactly the best setting to have kids in, socializing you all better probably would've stopped somethings," replied Violet. “But in all seriousness, we know that you have all this surveillance because you want to stop bad things from happening to us, and has those actions stopped the bad things from happening?”
"Exactly," replied Solomon. He whistled four times, and all the dogs lined up. He bends down and removes the work vests off bosco and bopper. "Hey Sherlock, you can walk Toby back. Rosie and Mrs. Hudson , can you walk Bosco? he should be manageable for you both. John, can you take care of Bopper? Okay, looks like we are all set." He presses the clicker, "home." Golem lines up next to Solomon, and he grabs Golem's harness. They all start walking back down the street. Sometimes Solomon would spread up but golem would slow him down enough to stay with the flow of foot traffic. They reached the door of the kennel, and entered.  "Okay let's get the papers started. I mean you got the vest, and the lead. And I'll give you all of Toby's toys and her bed. And you'll get a bag of dog food as well that way you know what to feed her. Otherwise, she is all up to date with shots, she has been spayed and chipped. And there isn't any fee for her dog license since she is a service animal. If you come to our clinic, the vet fees are waved for the first 5 years, but otherwise you can always pick your own clinic, I mean I am sure there is a vet out there who owes you a favor."
John smiled because Sherlock’s ass marked so easily and he imagined what he could do to that skin when they build up to other implements for impact play. He thought about how pretty Sherlock’s skin would take to a cane or a crop, and oh how he is going to have to try that one sooner than later. “Stop wiggling, Boy,” Said John as he dug his finger into a spot that anlot of the over slaps over lapped and was already form a small bruise.
Sherlock laughed, “you might think I mean well, but I am a sloppy train wreck who gets easily bored, you are a magnificent fuck and the first person I haven’t been able to read in an instant, so this is a fairly selfish endeavor on my part.” Sherlock gave John a playful shove and ran ahead. He memorized the buildings of London a long time ago and he had an education idea on where John actually lived so he was heading that way.
back straight and his knees af at 90 degree angle. The grit of the ground dug into his knees, it in a way kept him grounded, the pain stopped him from his mind wandering. He kept his mouth open, because he really truly was going to take whatever John gave him, also it had been proven that in general water sports and consumption on urine was fairly safe. He did always like sex to be on the filthier, rougher side, but he saw the current regiment of HIV medications and he had no intention of going down that path. So while he couldn’t enjoy the feeling of someone’s release dripping out of him, which was pretty much one of the odd things he missed about sex while high; that lack of inner voice that would tell him not to risk seroconversion.
“Okay fine,” the man stood up and went toe to toe with John. “Sherlock is not a man who makes friends very easily nor do people ever like him enough to stay pass all his little observations and insults. And even though he doesn’t admit it, he does indeed fall apart when people leave him. He just got out of rehab, and he is quite elastic on building connections when he gets out. So he will forget about you if we pull the bandaid off, so give me any city in the world that isn’t London and I’ll assure you that you will have a comfortable place to live and a job I am sure you will enjoy. Take the offer, because if you cause him to relapse I am going to make sure no one finds your body and you are just going to exist as a fleeting memory of a few people.
Mike raised an eyebrow at Molly, and softly said “oh Molly, no, just no.” Mike sucked in a deep breath. “No.”
“Hopefully it will but who is going to be the next gay boy is she going to crush on,” replied Kate. “The sooner she gives up on boys the sooner she’ll be happier.”
"Siger, are you saying I am not proud of all my kids? I don't exactly see you writing anyone about them." Snipped Violet.
“Bodily harm, arson, and possibly questions about some blood samples so that we can learn more about possibilities for creating a new class of pain medication?” Said Josephine with a slight smile.
"You have a wedding ring on, and two different shades of lipstick on your neck, one more likely for a women our age, but the other shade the lipstick is more like one would see on someone in their early 20's and at worst someone in their late teens. Aren't you a little too young to be dating a girl half your age," snipped Sherlock.
Sherlock took the glass and started drinking in large gulps, he tried to keep eye contact with John as he drank. Some drops of water started to dribble down his neck. As he continued drinking, he started to attempt to remove his clothing with his free hand.
Sherlock peeked up, he was hyped at the idea that John would want to repeat this and he was always down for experiments. He moaned as John took a firm grip again, “four, Five!” He was surprised by the sharp bite he received to his left nipple.
"Is this your 'you break his heart, I break your heart speech,' because I think you made that clear when we first met," replied John. "Also I learned from this experience and I do my best to avoid what sets me off, and that is why I am just going to try and walk away now, before things escalate. I also don't think Sherlock likes being left alone with your parents. You don't have to trust me, but you are going to have to trust Sherlock, we all are."
“You have got to love how William thought going with that middle name was a good idea, I mean who calls themselves Sherlock?” Said Hiram.
"I paid my rent and probably paid more than everyone else, kept my mess to my room alone, and I was constantly repairing everything in the house. I also have a distinct memory of them all gathered at my door, saying that they were surprised I was still in school and that the main reason they kept me around was that they all felt that no matter how bad things were for them, they still weren't me. But that might have been the drugs talking or they said that because of the drugs," replied Sherlock, he started off with rathe pressured speech, but ended up using a clipped tone. He never talked about his drug use with his parents, but he knew they activated the  drug abuse clause of his trust fund, so hasn't been able to draw too much from it. It was annoying at first but ultimately it mean that he needed a flat mate and that's how he got John.
“Darling, I am sure you got enough will pow-OUCH! William you don’t bite people,” said John quite cross at the fact that his son decided to bite him just because he managed squeeze out a name pun again.
Mycroft nodded and took a mental note to narrow the search to doctors in the army with the last name Watson. “Thanks you for the information, also is the arguing a contributing factor to why Sherlock doesn’t like going to that particular group given that it seems like it would be the best match.”
Sherlock nodded, "and I promise to be mindful when making decisions that affect all of us. At the same time I hope we never end up in that position again."
Two weeks later their mother came back and acted like nothing unusual happened, she wouldn’t let Aithne leave her side, and the rest of the siblings didn’t really think too much of it because when Aithne first came back they were told by her psychiatrist that Aithne wasn’t going back to residential treatment but rather they were going to test out a form of treatment usually aimed at kids who were very detached and insecure, which required her to spend every moment by her mother's side. They worried about Aithne, but they weren’t sure what to do about there mother, she seemed to act like she always had before the Blackpool incident. Their dad took a sabbatical to ensure that their mother couldn’t possibly dream up another way to try and force them all to be together forever. Time moved on, their mother took on a nasty habit of pushing and pulling all her kids, but the siblings all had each other and a dad who tried to be everything they needed to overcome the short comings in their relationship with their mother.
“Daddy, I need to go potty, and I don’t want to ruin your work, it’s so pretty,” replied Sherlock he shifted side to side to relieve some of the urge to go.
Mrs. Hudson smiled, “oh you are certainly changing for the better, let’s hope it sticks.” The bell rings, “that might be him, I’ll leave you be, but will you be needing the extra room?”
Sherlock turned to take a look at her, John was approaching her. “Fuck... that might be the brother, and judging by what she said about him, he is not the best person for her right now.”
He strolled up to the front door, and made quick work of the door, he didn't hear or see any alarms, which he thought was a bit suspicious for someone who was so secretive in her billing to NHS. He shrugged his shoulders and followed the map to the safe according to Anthea's plan. He found the safe built into the side table next to a desk in what one would consider the office.
“Sherlock! You just had sex!” Cheered the group of them. “And it felt so good! Someone let a penis go inside of them. Ooooh you’re not going back to the not having safer sex ways of the past.”
They looked at each other and Ian closed the door and set his backpack down. He came closer but only very slowly.
“Thank you, Master...” His fingers twitched. His stomach rumbled but he didn't react to it. But John did.
“Very good, John. Get back up again.” John slowly moved and placed himself back over Sherlock's lap. He rubbed over his abused cheeks and he groaned. They were still hot and red. Sherlock parted his cheeks and pushed two fingers into him. John made very wanton noises and panted again. Soon he also cried again. Sherlock stimulated him without mercy. He couldn't come with the cage on and he wriggled and desperately cried.
Sherlock sat in their room and wildly typed into his computer. He only woke the moment when he couldn’t read his notes anymore because it was getting too dark.
The feeling was alien being wrapped up like this. Now he knew why John had made him drink the beer. Fuck. He would soil himself and piss into the foil. It would be a messy business, a smelly one, too.
John stood to make a chocolate mousse. Right when he put cream on top, Mycroft opened the door. Greg looked up and a broad smile came up. But after a second it was gone again. Mycroft looked at him and tilted his head. His eyes shone. He shed his coat and placed his umbrella by the door.
“Sure. Sit. Or not. I’ll be with you in a minute.” He pulled a bottle from the shelf and opened it. He poured wine for both John and himself. He even carried it over to him.
“Perhaps I should reach subspace. Whatever that means.” Again, they looked at each other. Sherlock changed into explaining modus and John listened.
“What is its name?” Sherlock swallowed. He hadn’t been using his name for ages now and he needed to clear his throat.
And he had given him boxers. He had bought the silky things himself and had everything placed into his wardrobe.
“You know, I also could collect everything into a bottle and make you drink it later. Or I could force it into your backside with the kitchen funnel. It just might start all over again.” Sherlock looked up and his stare was wondrous. Could he believe what he had just heard?
“Thank you, Sherlock. I had no idea.” Sherlock smiled and nonchalantly shrugged. Then he closed the door again. John quickly started the bubbling and enjoyed the massage all over his body.
“Before you retreat upstairs …” John’s heart was beating fast and Sherlock stared at his neck and swallowed.
Sherlock was fuming. He rested on his front because his back hurt. Why did he have to stay here? It made no sense. He was awake and alert. He felt good, very good. But the nurses insisted on him staying for a few more hours.
The moment John was completely naked Sherlock looked him over for minutes until John started to shift and twitch.
After some minutes of brutal beating, John parted his cheeks and pushed two fingers into him. Sherlock panted and tried to relax but didn't manage. He remembered pleasure but this was only pain given to him.
“I would like to find out how far you have come to explore your sexuality with your good doctor.” Mycroft asked bluntly. Now Sherlock sighed. Deeply.
„Would you like to take some of it home for experiments? It's probably better than roadkill.“ John suggested and Sherlock again knew why he liked him so much. They were both very sick specimen.
“I love you very much. Therefore, I am asking you if you would give me the honour to marry me.” He opened the box and held it out so Mycroft could see the ring. It was golden and on the inside was the date engraved when they had first been together.
“Thank you…” He hugged him again and this time he pressed on his neck to pull him down. He wanted to kiss him on the cheek but Sherlock saw it coming and turned his head. He actually made their lips touch for the very first time.
Suddenly their eyes met and both men smiled at each other. Sherlock increased his speed and John pushed back. Skin slapped on skin and John hooked his ankles around Sherlock’s waist pressing all the way up. The friction and Sherlock’s cock over his prostate became too much and John suddenly tensed and came. He shuddered and yelled through his multiple orgasm. He also clenched and wasn’t able to control it.
“I am about to leave and don’t want you to get bored. As promised, I have something for you to keep you busy.” Sherlock’s eyes darted around John but couldn’t find anything remotely interesting; except for John himself of course.
“Well?” He said and John swallowed. Very slowly, he lifted his hands and pulled the strings open to be able to pull his trackpants down.
“No, not really. I have been talking to these women over there and their husbands. I haven’t noticed anyone leaving though. I am sorry, Sherlock.”
Since no one had called John and asked him to come and rein Sherlock in, he bought ice cream on the way home. It was today’s reward for good behaviour.
He sat there for hours until it was dark. John moved around over his head and returned sometime later to sit in his armchair. Sherlock didn’t move from the floor where he sat on his heels. He kept staring at the back of John’s armchair.
At first, he cried for a while. He didn’t bother to get up and blow his nose. He didn’t bother to eat or drink. A while later, he fell asleep and hung there with his legs over the armrest while evening became night and the room became dark.
The soldiers stood and, on their way out, naturally collected all the evidence. Mycroft was extremely pleased with this team. Well, it actually was
“No, I haven't. I wasn't tired. I enjoyed doing what I liked.” His joy was obvious and it made Greg happy, too.
“Greg, I am not stupid, you know? I know what you are doing.” Greg opened his eyes wide which normally helped. But not with John it did.
“Very well. Why don't you get dressed and join me in the kitchen? We can prepare dinner together if you like?”
“It was my brother who showed me. He is the most perfect dominant. He showed me because sometimes he needs to come down as well. And he can’t do these things in public. He needed a confidante.”
“You underestimate our good doctor, Myc. He surely would do anything for Sherlock but he would never betray us. Never.” Greg was convinced and somehow it impressed Mycroft.
“I declare this session open. Get up and undress. Place your clothes neatly on the small table over there. Come back to me and fold your hands on your nape.” Mycroft stood and swallowed. He slowly walked over to the table and started to undress. He folded his pullover followed by his t-shirt. He toed off his shoes and socks and they went under the table with his socks inside his shoes. He opened his belt and climbed out of his jeans.
“I advise using the bathroom now, Gregory.” He told him. Greg quickly hurried to comply. Mycroft listened to the water run and Greg rummaging through his things. He licked his lips and looked forward to the next few hours. He would drive him mad with lust and desire. He would make him beg. He would make him kneel and shiver before him.
He carefully reached out and placed his palm flat on his chest. Sherlock twitched but didn’t move away. His heart was racing and he felt hot.
The man still glared at Sherlock. Then he looked at John who simply let the camera run while he handed over the remote for the collar.
The next moment Sebastian was almost clear and he was flat on his back looking up at Mycroft. He felt good, warm, aroused. He closed his eyes and quietly moaned.
The nurse was rather pissed. Sherlock was rather pleased. John didn’t question Sherlock pulling him away to the morgue.
Sherlock looked at him and was very pleased so far. He had expected something else to happen but probably his interfering brother had called the local police after having sent Lestrade on his way. Sometimes, his interferences were good. Like now.
„Oh, OK.“ He shut the water off and took a riding crop. He once smacked it on the man's legs and yelled.
“I am sorry. I kept watching until you had fallen asleep. I wanted a drink. I was selfish again. I am sorry.” Sherlock said.
Only now Greg shed his jeans and underwear. He just had to smile and rubbed over his stomach. He actually rubbed the ejaculate all over his skin making him moan.
Sherlock’s hair was all open on the ground since the pen he had stuck into it had gone lost during the sex. John hooked his finger into the ring attached to his collar and pulled him up.
“Are you trying to woo me?” John thought it was a joke and smiled. Sherlock slowly undressed until he stood only clad in his boxers and the mask in front of John.
“That behaviour had completely stopped after John Watson had stepped into his life. By now we all know how he achieved that. I have to admit that I prefer Sherlock like he was before. Him being obedient and quiet never felt right.”
“I know. I also know you are way too thin. I’d only like you to try. If you don’t like it I’ll do something else.”
John soon had three fingers inside but knew it would never be enough. And Sherlock had said he liked it like this. He wiped his fingers clean and used Sherlock’s dress shirt.
