Instead he nodded. “Of course, Dean. It won’t happen again.”
His sexuality wasn’t a huge part of the reason he’d dropped out of seminary, but it played a small part. Of course it did. Unavoidable, really, when you’re constantly hearing from other older or more fundamentalist Christian men that homosexuality was and would always be a sin, that God would never forgive those who acted on their inclinations, and even, from the more extreme classmates he’d met, that it was akin to pedophilia and bestiality.
They drove in silence to Cas’s apartment, and Dean realized belatedly that he had never seen it. His brain worked overtime, questions passing through his mind like, what if he had misread the situation? Cas kept to himself on the ride over, nodding along to Dean’s music and looking completely at ease. What if Dean was wrong about Cas clearly wanting to do something vaguely dirty with him and Cas threw him out angrily, never speaking to him again?
Dean nodded sympathetically. “I hear you. My dad would’ve beat my ass if I left a sink full after dinner. Everything had to be done as soon as possible. ‘Why do tomorrow what you can do right this fuckin’ minute,’ right?”
Dean stood up, and Castiel found he could not breathe. His eyes wandered over every lithe muscle, every sinewy ridge of Dean’s chest and abs and torso, and sweet Jesus he was going to Hell. Yep, he was going to Hell and he was going to burn alive and the Devil would have so much fun making Castiel his plaything and he would deserve every second of punishment and torture for practically drooling over this man. His friend. A man sent to help him.
He refrained from going outside to see if Dean needed water, sunblock, a sandwich, a hat, a sweater in case the sun dipped behind some clouds gathering in the east that threatened to overrun the nice day, help, or anything else he could think of. He knew his helper hadn’t had much time to himself; Castiel had kept him busy all week with cleaning and reading his work. And now Dean was outside doing whatever he pleased to Castiel’s garden, and Castiel had no idea if Dean really knew how to design planter boxes and oh God, maybe he should go out there and check on him, just for a moment, just to see how everything was coming along.
“You said you were working on it when you broke your arm. I could help you with that.”
“Uh… I need to go! Bye!” Castiel squeaked, and it took a few tries before he could blindly pull at the door handle. He let it slam behind him, not even bothering to put the bottle of water down, leaving Dean out in the yard, wiping his brow and watching Cas beat a hasty retreat.
“I can come now.” And Castiel closed his laptop and straightened his notebooks and followed Dean outs into the sunshine.
Castiel definitely did not mean to put it that way and he hid his shame in another huge bite of bacon. He did, however, momentarily forget how idiotic he sounded as he watched Dean eat. It was as though Dean had never had a good homecooked meal, and this wasn’t even the best Castiel could do. When he really wanted to—needed to, rather, when he craved comfort food in the form of scratch-made chicken and dumplings or a sizzling pan of steak fajitas or the occasional crisp edges of salted caramel brownies, Castiel could throw down in the kitchen.
Castiel scowled down at the slice of bread he was slathering with mayonnaise as he tore clean through it. He tossed it in the trash, wincing and apologizing inwardly for wasting food, and grabbed another piece out of the bag.
A few minutes passed before Dean joined him, and he didn’t seem to care that his breakfast was lukewarm. He still shoveled it in like it was the best thing he’d ever tasted, and he thanked Castiel profusely for making him food and waiting for him instead of just throwing it away when he didn’t come to the breakfast table on time.
Dean chuckles, turning off the engine and pocketing his keys. “Nah, nothing like that. Well, I mean… It’s just—”
“Yes, that’s true. I just wanted to catch up with you. I feel like we haven’t seen each other in forever.”
“Thanks for getting that,” Dean said, reaching around Castiel to grab his glass off the counter. His hand brushed Castiel’s hip and he took an infinitesimal step forward.
“Sorry, I don’t mean to be nosy. ‘S just, I thought all priests had to wear their garments or whatever all the time.” He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and leaned back in his chair, tipping it on its back legs.
“Why do you care?” Dean mumbles under his breath as he reaches into the fridge to grab a beer, and Cas’s head jolts up.
Dean pokes at his plate, saying nothing for a moment. Then, trying to lighten the mood, or at least lighten his own, he asks, “Yeah? You trying to set me up or something?”
couch. In their spot. They had just spent the weekend—had two great nights in a row, ordering in sesame chicken and dumplings to share on Friday and splitting Dean’s homemade pizzas on Saturday (veggie for Cas, meat lovers for himself), and watching bad horror movies that Cas has never seen before—on that couch. In that spot. The spot that is now tainted by Cas’s
“Me too. Uh, missed you, that is.”
Things like, “I like spending time with you, Cas,” after they’d wrapped up another evening with a nightcap and a hot fire spreading warmth throughout the den.
He was starting to feel grateful for it.
“Oh God!” Cas groans and he covers his face with his hands.
Dean had managed to reconstruct the planter’s boxes that Castiel had haphazardly put together; it wasn’t that his original boxes were shoddy, just that Dean clearly had so much more skill with a hammer and nails, or even Castiel’s old drill. They looked perfectly neat, straight lines and sharp corners sanded down. Dean had even stained them dark so they blended better into the whole garden setup.
“Do you feel as though you’re able to help others better when you help yourself, Dean?” Castiel ventured to ask, trying not to stare at him over the top of his computer. He saw out of the corner of his eye the soft backlighting against Dean’s hair, now slightly less slicked down, a little fluffier as they reached the end of the day. Castiel watched as Dean rubbed his knuckles against one side of his jaw, thinking about his answer.
Damnit.
He looked at their glasses and saw that his had surprisingly emptied during their conversation, and that Dean was draining his last drops.
And once in a while that he missed Cas.
He squeezes his eyes shut and keeps drinking, ‘til his vision starts to go fuzzy around the edges and he gets warm and sleepy. He can already feel the growing headache at the back of his head and he burrows deeper under the blankets, throwing them over his head completely.
“Cas, Cas, wait. Wait!” he says a little louder than he means to, and Cas pulls back, fear and shame in his eyes.
Cas licked the buffalo sauce from his fingertips and Dean stared shamelessly at him.
Sweet Christ, Castiel really was hard up for human contact.
And Castiel was off, unable to stop babbling about his plans. He pointed to all the areas that needed a good weeding, some root killer to stop the invasive, annoying shoots from coming back. He stretched his good arm wide and his bad arm as far as it would go explaining to Dean how he wanted it to look, boxes built to house his plants. Lavender, sage, thyme and mint plants so he could have fresh herbs that he couldn’t grow in just a windowsill; geraniums and hollyhocks as his perennial flowers; and poppies and zinnias if he could swing it, bursts of bright reds and purples and pinks all over.
“No, thank you, Dean. Really, this place is spotless. I didn’t realize how much I’d let it go over the last couple of years and now, with this,” Castiel said, holding up his broken arm, “I can’t get on my hands and knees too much.”
Dean didn’t notice him standing there, and thank goodness for that. Castiel was definitely going to Hell for it but he looked his fill as long as he could.
He hadn’t realized that Dean joined him outside until he heard soft grunts and banging around in the backyard. Though thrown for a moment, Castiel resumed his warrior pose, eyes closed, brow relaxing again. Noise, he could work through. One summer there had been a particularly loud descent of woodpeckers fighting with an echo of mockingbirds near his house; combine that with a parliament of screech owls and Castiel had an absolute cacophony surrounding him at all hours of the day and night.
Because that’s what he was, in essence, doing. Giving into cowardice, unable to calm himself enough to face Dean, Cas was fleeing.
“Does this guy seriously only have one mug?” Dean said, holding Castiel’s favorite yellow-and-black striped bumblebee cup a tad too precariously in one hand.
Dean doesn’t know what a head massage from Cas feels like, and he would really like to find out, but he doesn’t say that to Gabriel. When he returns, triangle of drinks in hand, the three of them don’t talk about anything of much importance, other than classes, professors, other students, their jobs, and Gabriel’s girlfriend, Kali, with whom he’s now on completely great terms again.
Castiel stared at him. “I’m not – Dean, I’m not a priest.”
Prayer was usually his first resort, but now he prayed constantly, and not just on his knees by his bedside, hands clasped in front of him. Asking for guidance, asking for absolution, for forgiveness, for whatever God or anyone who was listening would give him. He prayed during his yoga and meditations in the morning, silently over his meals before he picked up a fork, every time he headed outside to watch as Dean worked, and regularly in the shower when temptation threatened to overtake him.
Then again, at night his head was filled with all the terrible and delicious thoughts of Dean chopping wood shirtless, making breakfast and dancing around the kitchen
Dean nodded.
“Thanks, man. Guess I should hit the hay too. ‘Night.”
But Cas took two strides over and grabbed Dean by his coat, and before Dean realized what was happening, Cas pressed his mouth to a very surprised hunter.
Castiel needed to be fair and give him a chance to help, but he also reminded himself to keep his distance too.
Dean drinks as much as he can without barfing and swallows the pills, already feeling a little better, and if he smiles despite the hangover, nobody needs to know.
On his way up the stairs to bed, Castiel poked his head into the den and saw that Dean had not only finished chopping the wood, but he had also replenished Castiel’s fireplace supply in the large rack next to the mantel. Something tugged at Castiel’s heart and he squeezed his eyes shut before going up for the night.
So much for his plans, Dean thinks. It appears that they’re finally spending the night together at home. Cas has several large, heavy textbooks spread out on their tiny kitchen table and he’s poring over notes written in his neat, cramped penmanship. He looks up as Dean comes through the front door and shrugs off his coat, shaking water from his hair. He asks again.
Dean didn’t call Castiel out on his lies; all he said was, “Okay. Next time, check your phone or call me back. Please.”
Not that there would be anything to do about it, other than call someone to take Dean’s body away, and Jesus, why was Castiel thinking about the man dying? He shook his head again, this time to clear it.
“Dean, it was always you,” Cas says first, and Dean surges forward, kissing him thoroughly, slick tongue against Cas’s lips and tongue and the back of his teeth, and they stay like that for minutes, hours, days, Dean doesn’t give a single shit how long it is—he keeps kissing Cas like it’s his lifeline.
They finished their evening in relative silence, Castiel trying and failing to concentrate on rewriting the following week’s sermon. The next one would be about not coveting, and rather than using the Exodus verse regarding the Ten Commandments, Castiel instead had chosen James 4:2-4: “
“So? S’not booze, Cas, you’ll be fine.”
Then he remembered that Dean would only be with him until his arm healed. Five weeks. That was all.
jealous, not in the slightest, why would he be, that’s ridiculous, but Dean catches sight of the soft smile on Cas’s face as he zips up his jacket. He takes another deep breath, realizes Cas is joking, and rearranges his face in an easy grin.
“Bisexual, thank you very much. Kali doesn’t usually care who I hit on, as long as I come home to her, but something about my buddy Bart rubbed her the wrong way,” Gabriel clarified, not even hesitating.
He held his hand out for Dean to give him back this upcoming week’s work. What he didn’t expect was the look of confusion on Dean’s face to return. Dean instead placed his own hand in Castiel’s and pulled himself out of the too-comfortable armchair.
They didn’t speak of these quiet, sad moments, hushed messages left while Sammy slept in the next bed at their motel or curled up against the passenger-side door of the car as Dean drove one-handed down a lonely highway. But Cas always texted him back the next morning, and when Dean saw the message blinking on his phone screen, an “
It warmed him from the inside out, and even when he felt himself growing tired, his eyes itching with the need to stop focusing so intently on miniscule penmanship inked on translucent sheets of paper, Castiel was reluctant to head up to bed.
Dean didn’t even have space to be annoyed that his little brother already knew, his heart full to bursting as he gently set his phone down again and rolled over to cuddle up behind a sleeping Cas, thinking about getting breakfast at their diner in the morning.
Dean looked at him as though asking for an official Red Ryder carbine action two-hundred shot range model air rifle for Christmas, all hope glinting in his green eyes, and Castiel couldn’t help but smile at him. It was as if he were the one indulging Dean in his ultimate fantasy to become an exterior decorator, rather than the fact that Castiel desperately needed the help if he was going to have any seeds planted in time for harvesting or blooming this year.
At length.
He pushed the thought of a parade of gorgeous homecoming vets out of his mind. Dean was still talking when Castiel looked up at him, and Castiel really hoped his face wasn’t as red as it felt. It wouldn’t do to be blushing and tripping over his own tongue like a schoolgirl with a crush when this man was supposed to be helping him and—according to the letter—living with him for the next five weeks. It seemed Dean needed a home as much as Castiel had one to spare, and the interruption was only the second crisis Castiel had to deal with.
Stupid, he thinks, taking pleasure that none of their dates have helped them dress.
Cas nods. “He’s been having trouble with his girlfriend so I invited him over. I thought the three of us might be able to go out, maybe cheer him up. I wouldn’t have had him here if I knew it would bother you.”
Dean read in silence mostly, his lips moving occasionally. It was very distracting for Castiel, who was trying and failing to focus on next month’s schedule. He rarely re-ran material and tried to make sure his work was original and unique and pertinent. A pile of fan letters lay open and scattered around him as he picked through them for new ideas.
Castiel couldn’t argue with that. “Agreed,” he replied.
“I’m teasing you,” Castiel said gently, and Dean burst out laughing.
He resolutely returned outside, bringing an ice-cold bottle of water for Dean and a mug of tea for himself, along with his work. He would not be chased from his routines or his space in his home, no matter how much Dean liked to look at him.
Not that he would have minded that at all. But Dean definitely would, so he stayed put, content with Dean’s fingers squeezing his own.
“Like ‘em chunky, huh, Cas?” Dean winked again, and how was it possible that the man could get away with doing that so often?
“I do something wrong, Cas?” Dean asked, and Castiel looked over to see the other man’s eyes wide and shiny.
Reaching out, Castiel shook the man’s hand, noting the callouses and rough skin under his own, silently wondering what it would feel like to have that hand touching him elsewhere and then cursing himself for even thinking something so—so
Then coffee turned into dinner as the sky grew shadowy outside, the long lines of daylight stretching and disappearing from the sky as the hours passed. They ordered plates of appetizers to share, wings and chicken fingers and disco fries and onion rings, the greasiest comfort food they could think of. They both needed it, and Dean didn’t even care about the heartburn he’d probably have later. He just liked watching Cas sucking the meat off a drumstick and thinking about how his lips might look—
” lighting it up, his face hurt from smiling so hard.
“You always double-dip, which, I might remind you, is incredibly unsanitary.”
.” About thirty seconds passed before Sam responded.
you, Sammy. I freaking knew it,” he’d said to his younger brother, and Sam had rolled his eyes and pursed his lips in response) Dean had invited Dr. Novak out for a drink, just to say thank you.
Dean had said he would save his famous five-alarm chili, which “all the guys in my unit loved, Cas, I’m telling you, you gotta try it,” Dean said, looking proud of himself, for Sunday, since it needed all day to cook slow on the stove and they’d already spent the day doing a bunch of nothing. Instead they made a quick carbonara, Dean whipping together the silken sauce with ease while Castiel tossed a simple salad with some Italian dressing. Castiel was glad he’d picked up some crusty bread on a whim at the store when they’d gone food shopping, rather than wait to grab some from his favorite local baker at the market, since that would have left them significantly carb-less.
Dean hovers in the doorway for a minute more before crossing over to Cas. He tries not to think about the sudden stabbing pain he feels somewhere around his diaphragm. Managing to finish buttoning Cas into his shirt, like he’s a small child or something, Dean retreats before he catches another whiff of the cologne Cas is wearing. For Soraya. For his date. With her.
“’M here, ain’t I?” Dean asked, not unkindly, and again Castiel nodded. “And you could never be a burden.”
“Yes, thank you. I don’t usually wake before the sun. I suppose I’ll just have to ignore you clattering around in here,” Cas replied, blowing on his coffee before taking a sip. “How did you sleep?”
“Nah, I’m still getting my benefits from the service,” Dean said. He brushed his hands together and then wiped them on his pants, and Castiel determinedly did not look down. “I can pay for whatever I need, and then if I need anything else for your project, I’ll let you know.”
Taken aback and a little teary, Castiel told Dean how impressed he was with his work. “You’ve really made this look so much more beautiful than I ever imagined.”
As it turned out, despite his internal panic at mentioning it, Castiel wasn’t the one to bring it up. That night, after a lot of heavy lifting and hot bowls of fresh corn chowder, complete with crusty bread and bacon bits and swirls of sour cream mixed in, while Cas was taking notes from the last of that week’s letters, Dean picked up a framed picture off the shelf.
He busied himself clearing their empty plates, rinsing them and leaving them in the sink for later. “Sure, Dean. If you want, you can proofread them before I send them out. I usually work on a couple at a time so I don’t procrastinate and forget until the last minute.”
He definitely noticed Cas staring at him that time. He wasn’t imagining it. Dean slowly licked the spoon and caught the look in Cas’ eyes, a shade darker than usual, a hint of suggestion gleaming under the warm lights, before he set down the empty cup.
Castiel had bought the cabin with the little bit of money his parents had left when they’d passed away. It wasn’t an enormous property, though the land surrounding it technically was. Downstairs, the den was filled with comfortably couches and Castiel’s favorite armchair, one that had followed him through his years sharing apartments with people who were strictly roommates and definitely not friends in college and halfway through the seminary.
“Yeah, she’ll be fine. Nothin’ doing in her today. Tomorrow I’ll have to wait until the ground dries again to pull her around, so she doesn’t get stuck. Hey, what d’ya say we get a fire going later, make some comfort food for dinner tonight?”
Much frustration, very shenanigans.
“Mornin’, sunshine!” Dean shouted over the music playing from a small radio Castiel had never seen before. A steaming mug of coffee was pressed into his hands and he gratefully accepted, settling at the already-set table and warming himself up before he started his day.
Because, God forgive him, he wanted so badly to finish with Dean. In all ways, every way, from now until forever.
Castiel was hopeless, damnit.
“You should meet her, you know,” Cas says suddenly around an enormous bite. “You and Charlie would probably get along great. She’s a huge nerd like you.”
Cas tries to tug his hands back but Dean refuses to let go. Dean is a little shocked that Cas sighs in defeat and keeps his eyes down; he’s never seen his roommate anything other than calm and collected, confident in his own quiet way.
Castiel took his time picking up seeds and bushlings, wanting to expand on what he’d already managed to plant and wanting to see what kind of wonderful maze Dean would create with greenery in the yard. He rolled the cart down the aisle, stopping every few yards to ponder over different cold-weather vegetables and debating over perennials versus annuals. In the meantime, Dean loaded up a dolly with more lumber, some planks and sheets of wood that Castiel had no idea how he would use. But he couldn’t wait to find out. He daydreamed as he walked up and down all the gardening aisles, stopping every few feet so Dean could toss in a tool or three, imagining a luscious wonderland of plants and homegrown food and honeybees everywhere.
Sam never said anything, and for that, Dean was extremely grateful in ways he knew he could never express.
“I feel like I can smell colors.”)
He certainly would like to help Dean heal too. That was the point of the program, wasn’t it?
, just fucking perfect, now Dean’s horny and sad and a little drunk, the absolute worst combination of all time. It makes him want to sleep forever to avoid his feelings and at the same time leap off his bed, burst into the living room and kick out the other man lying in Cas’s lap.
He asked God to eliminate the lust in his heart, to forgive him for his impure thoughts about his guest, to grant him serenity and guide him in being a good host and a friendly person, not a total creep breathing heavily every time a sliver of skin peeked out from under Dean’s shirt.
It was dark when they left the diner, hours later, after starting out with two coffees. Cas said he needed a pick-me-up after a long, busy day of teaching hellions. Dean would’ve thought college students would be more mature, but the spring term was almost over and the majority of them would be going home for the summer. Thankfully, Cas mentioned, he was teaching summer classes online.
Finally, after the new year and the arrival of spring, after not seeing Cas for nearly eight months and the hole in his aching chest absolutely
But Dean wishes he had the guts to do something about the way Cas is looking at him like he’s seeing him for the first time, blue eyes roaming up and down over the naked half of Dean’s torso. He wishes he could flirt back, maybe let go of the towel a little so it sinks lower on his hips, maybe stare back as brazenly as Cas is doing. But he’s frozen in place, heating up under Cas’s gaze, and if Cas doesn’t stop looking at him like that he’s going to pop a boner and then Dean’s gonna have to drop out of school and move out of state. Or die. Yeah, dying sounds like a good plan.
Castiel didn’t trust himself to speak, so he simply nodded. He found he was doing that a lot around Dean, and he had never been a shy man. Quiet, sure, but not shy. If he didn’t speak up he feared Dean might get suspicious and start asking questions about why Castiel clammed up around him.
Dean likes those nights best of all, when he and Cas can talk and chill out, like they’re friends and not just roommates.
Even though they had had several more probing conversations, the other man still gave little away about himself. Castiel knew he had family members who were either deceased or estranged, though Dean did speak of his younger brother Sam with an enormous grin on his face, and he promised Castiel that when he and Sam had one of their weekly calls, he would let Cas say hi.
“Oh, cool,” Dean says. “Uh, me too. The bi thing, I mean.”
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face. “You know my favorite diner is up there, man,” he said, squeezing his eyes shut and hoping Sam would buy it.
“That’s still extremely brave of you. You signed up for a war machine not knowing if you would make it back, and you did it because you loved your father and admired his service, right?”
“Please, Cas, I just—I need to know you’re okay. So that I can be okay, too.”
“Oh… okay.” Castiel set down his pen and slipped on his shoes, Dean doing the same behind him. They went out into the garden, the late morning air chillier than expected. Castiel pulled his sweater more tightly around his chest and crossed one arm over as he led Dean down the stairs and around the side of the house.
“Sorry I made an ass of myself the other day. Had a rough day at work.” Dean winces at his own excuse, but Gabriel claps him on the shoulder—roughly, nothing like Cas’s gentle, warm touch—and laughs.
Cas, opting for a bite of his potato salad instead, stopped with his fork halfway to his lips. “What?”
“Your father threw food away?”
When he wakes the next morning, the first thing he sees is the tall glass of water on his nightstand, right next to an individual pack of extra-strength Tylenol. Cas must have snuck in before leaving for the day to make sure Dean didn’t die from his own stupidity.
After a workout of a hunt and nearly two whole days without sleep, Dean’s eyes must’ve been playing tricks on him, ‘cause he could’ve sworn he saw Cas staring at his mouth as he licked hot sauce off his lips.
He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t let himself have a moment of pleasure and then break his own heart when he later had to watch Dean walk away.
And slowly fell in love with him over diner date after diner date.
How Dean found him at least a little bit attractive.
But mostly he liked the food. There was something about the cheap homecooked-style meals that he could never get enough of. Sam preferred his rabbit food, as Dean called it; kale salads and quinoa burgers and bean burritos. It tasted fine, and Dean could admit to sneaking a bite of his tofu wrap on occasion, but he couldn’t fathom how Sam subsisted on vegetables alone, and he much preferred the well-proportioned plates of two eggs over-easy with home fries, sausage links, and toast. A side of silver dollar pancakes if he was extra hungry, or he might go with eggs Benedict if he was feeling fancy that day.
“’Bout a year and a half ago, two Christmases past. It’s been too long.”
Dean wants so badly to let Cas do whatever he pleases, but they’re so tired. It’s much later than they realized, well past four in the morning, and no matter how much they want to take all their clothes off, and Dean doesn’t protest when they fall asleep, slipping easily into unconsciousness, mouths still attached in soft flutters of lips until their breath deepens and they’re both out like lights.
Castiel gathered his papers to his chest, bringing his notebook and laptop with him, and headed for the living room instead.
Toward their first weekend together he drummed up a tub of salve for Dean’s sore muscles, and though he wished he’d been bold enough to offer to rub it into Dean’s back and neck, he let the other man take it into his room for later.
Dean nodded, watching Castiel intently. “Sure, I get you. Why bother with a half-assed relationship when you deserve somebody who will whole-ass it with you?”
But Dean didn’t seem to pause at the religious paraphernalia scattered around the house. Instead he grinned and told Castiel that he would probably be doing the grocery shopping around here for a while. “With your arm and everything,” he said, as though Castiel had forgotten.
And if he falls asleep to Castiel’s soft breathing a slight tickle in his ear, the feeling of Cas’s heart beating right against Dean’s chest, and an enormous smile on his face, nobody needs to know.
Dean grunted noncommittally in his throat. Castiel watched as he looked at the papers in his lap again, eyelashes nearly flush against his cheeks. They were so long. How did a man even get his eyelashes to look like that?
“Goodnight, Dean,” he said, a little louder than he meant to, and he brushed past the other man to head upstairs.
Ooh, Dean could get used to breathing that in. He wanted to ask what body wash Cas used but he didn’t want to sound like a total stalker, so instead, he stuttered over a goodnight after dropping Cas back at his apartment. The other man gave him a smile and a look that, if not for the passing shadows over Cas’ stubbled jaw, Dean would have misread as an invitation.
“My friend Mick and I, when we were dating in college,” Castiel said, squeezing one eye shut as he turned back to his mail, hoping to God that Dean wouldn’t bolt out of the house or throw something. Or hit him.
, he couldn’t concentrate on the words in front of him while Dean chattered away. Something about the veterans’ assistance program for homecoming soldiers who needed the guidance of church members while the church members themselves needed help with basic tasks.
Dean got up and crossed the tiny kitchen, pulling his robe tighter around his waist and Castiel inhaled sharply at how close he suddenly was. Dean put his hands on Castiel’s shoulders and looked at him, green eyes searching Castiel’s face, and he knew he was flushing bright red under the other man’s gaze.
“I’m going to get us a refill,” Castiel said, reluctantly letting go of Dean. He grabbed both their glasses with one hand and tried not to make it obvious that he was in crisis mode as he waited until he reached the kitchen to inhale as deeply as he could, filling his lungs with air for what seemed like the first time all night.
They’d already eaten, so they remained holding hands as they talked, Dean brushing his thumb back and forth over Cas’s knuckles. It was one of the best nights Dean had had in a long while.
Sighing, he took off toward the emergency room, hand cradled against his chest, and when he returned several hours later, in the dark, after reassuring the nurses that he definitely had someone to drive him home, the first thing he did was pray forgiveness for lying to them. Fresh cast wrapped around his right hand, Castiel made himself a sandwich and ignored the painkillers as he tried to figure out how best to sleep without causing further discomfort.
Castiel blinked.
“Good, because I’m kind of in love with you too. Now get upstairs.”
“What list?”
And Cas returns and Dean can’t meet his eyes. He hardly says anything, happily letting Gabriel dominate the conversation so that Dean doesn’t say anything to embarrass himself. They call it a night fairly quickly after, just around closing time, carrying Gabriel to Dean’s car before taking a quiet, long drive to drop him off at Kali’s place across town.
Castiel wanted to lean down and kiss a stray drop of syrup off Dean’s mouth but he managed to resist—goodness knew how. Upstairs he changed out of his pajamas and robe into a stretchy pair of yoga pants, leaving his own shirt off. Less laundry to do when he got sweaty.
“Cas?” Dean stepped closer, arms drooping to set the axe down, and Castiel nearly tripped over himself moving back toward the door.
Castiel remembered Naomi mentioning it once or twice, when he dropped by the rectory to collect his paychecks. She didn’t believe in direct deposit, which suited Castiel just fine because he looked forward to the excuse to get out of his house. He had never paid much attention, and now he wished to Heaven he had.
“Next time, then,” Cas says, and he slips past Dean to head back into his room but not before placing a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Not patting him in comfort, just leaving his hand there, burning Dean’s skin, for a hot second before he disappears. Dean waits, still unmoving in the hall, until he hears Cas’s classical music mix playing softly behind the door, and then he unsticks himself from the cold floor and runs to his own room.
He inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with fresh air, pushing them as far as they would expand, and he exhaled. Ready to try again, Castiel repositioned himself on his folded blanket on the porch, folding his legs one over the other, resting his wrists on his knees.
But Cas doesn’t pull back; he nearly knocks one of Dean’s front teeth out in his enthusiasm to kiss him and it takes a minute but they find a rhythm that works. Dean pulls Cas across the bench seat and touches as much of him as he can, hands slipping under Cas’s shirt, blue to match his eyes, and he feels warm skin under his palms, grounding him the same way Cas’s mouth is, steady and sure.
He took a deep breath, in and out, slowly, trying to calm his pounding heart. Something prickled at the back of Dean’s eyes and he was not going to cry, damnit. But he had to know.
“How nice!” Yolanda, according to her nametag, said, her face brightening with a huge smile. “Wish I could get my husband to build me anything, never mind a whole garden. Oh, thank you.” She took the tiny can of white outdoor paint from Dean and nodded at him.
There was a beat of awkward silence, Dean feeling the blush burning his cheeks, and then Cas said the five words he’d been waiting to hear.
But then Dean sees a short red-headed girl grab Cas’s elbow and pull him toward her, and Dean watches helplessly as they talk, standing a little too close for Dean’s comfort, Cas throwing his head back and laughing a few times. A searing bout of indigestion creeps up in Dean’s stomach and he can’t help but think that he wants to make Cas smile like that, and then he scolds himself for spending the last few days holed up in the library, frantically texting his little brother about how he didn’t understand any of what his professors wanted but what he really meant was,
He led Dean through the kitchen, which opened up to a tiny dining room with a table and four chairs, though Castiel only used one, worn and squeaky but molded to his butt when he sat in it for work. Thankfully Castiel had cleared away his breakfast dishes and all that was left was his laptop and notepad full of scribbles and ideas for his sermons in the coming weeks.
Castiel glanced down at his bare chest. It was alright, he supposed. He wasn’t particularly buff or fit, not like Dean with his broad shoulders, well-muscled arms, and a stomach that had only gone slightly soft, Castiel imagined, now that he had retired from the military. Add in Dean’s tapered hips and strong legs and Castiel felt like he was living with the real-life version of the Vitruvian Man.
He texted Sammy later that night. “
Castiel breathed a sigh of relief, then caught sight of the note on the kitchen table.
“You mind if I leave my car there? It’s safe, right?” Dean asked, and Castiel murmured an affirmative response over his shoulder, trying his hardest not to look directly at him.
Finally.
And the blush on Dean’s cheeks, heating up his face under his freckles, returned. Castiel wondered what it would look like spread over his neck and chest and all down his body. He couldn’t stop staring and he knew Dean knew that he was looking at him a little too long.
Cas looked him square in the eye and said, “You know I do, Dean. Of course I do.”
“I have a date with Soraya, from my philosophy class. Could you please do this up for me? I’m so nervous.”
Who turned out to be extraordinarily handsome, in a quiet, understated and totally unexpected sort of way. Sure, Cas had a bad case of bedhead, which definitely did not make Dean think of rolling over in the morning to find him looking down at Cas’ impossibly straight nose, chapped lips like pink rose petals, and the stormiest of ocean blue eyes.
While Castiel made a list of things he would need from the grocery store, because he had nothing else to do, Dean danced around the kitchen to some song on the radio, cleaning as he went. He finished in record time, since there wasn’t much to do. He’d scrubbed down every surface during the week, and even cleaned out some of the cabinets above the counter, just to rearrange them and toss some of the expired spices Castiel never used.
“Put paint on the list too,” Dean said, brushing flakes from Castiel’s shoulder Tuesday evening as they retreated into the house so Dean could take a long shower and Castiel could start dinner for them.
Or not.
“’Course you will. I’ll see you for dinner.” Dean bounded up the stairs and after a few minutes of shuffling around, Castiel heard nothing else from the top floor.
“I do,” Castiel said simply. And it was true, he really did. It was part and parcel of his religious upbringing, and he was named after one of the more minor seraphim—the angel of Thursday, of all things—and all his brothers and sisters were called after angels or biblical figures as well.
And it scared the hell out of him that he was ready to lay down the rest of his life if it meant he could have Dean. Castiel would give up anything for him—his personal space, his bed, his yard, hell, his entire house—if only Dean would stay. Cas would make him breakfast, lunch, and dinner, buy him the good scotch, do whatever it was Dean wanted and needed, if he could keep him.
“This is really good,” Dean said. He pointed to a part in the sermon where Castiel was talking about judging for past sins.
Dean stepped up onto the porch and Castiel found it very difficult to breathe. Up close, jade green eyes bore into his and Castiel swallowed hard, then swallowed again because he couldn’t get any moisture into his mouth. His tongue felt thick in his head, his teeth suddenly too large for his jaw, and he clicked it shut, not wanting to say anything stupid like
“Sure, Dean,” Cas yawns before going back to his linguistics homework.
Though struggling to retain focus on the sound of his breathing and his heartbeat pounding in his ears, coming down from the high of his exercises, Castiel kept his eyes shut and focused on the way the sunshine warmed his skin. There were forecasts of heavy rain for later that weekend and they had been lucky enough to avoid it the day before, but the air was beginning to tingle ever so slightly with warning. He thought about how they might spend their afternoon inside, maybe baking cookies or pies, then warming themselves in heavy sweaters and fuzzy socks by the fire, so well-stocked with Dean’s fresh supply of firewood. Castiel’s mind drifted and he allowed each pleasing thought to buzz through him and then pass on, as though he were floating down a river in his mind.
Castiel nodded dumbly, as though hearing his own name for the first time out of the mouth of this man was the most glorious sound in the world.
Dean still refused to look at him. “I was watching you.”
God, but Castiel wanted to lean in and kiss the wrinkle out of Dean’s brow.
“Appreciate it, Cas. Thanks,” he’d said, pocketing the hemp lotion.
He’d arrived the night before but got a motel room close to the community college, so he could show up after one of Cas’ history lectures freshly showered and caffeinated. He waited the half hour until he knew the class let out, then waited parked across from the quad and leaning against the side of the Impala like he had nowhere better to be. A few students checked him out, girls that, once upon a time, Dean would’ve caught up to and tried to finagle phone numbers out of, but he was far too old for any of the students on campus and besides, he only had eyes for Cas.
“You okay? You never need time off,” Sam had said, concern furrowing his brow. “You feeling alright?”
A guy could dream, couldn’t he? And was it hot in the Impala, or was it just Dean?
He shrugs off his jacket and his jeans, gets into bed, and pulls on his massive noise-cancelling headphones. He pretends not to notice the soft knocking at the door twenty minutes later, which he can’t hear but he can feel reverberating through the wall, through his headboard, right through his heart. He pretends not to swipe at the tears gathering at the corners of his eyes, and he reaches under the bed for his secret bottle of the good scotch his uncle Bobby got him for his twenty-first birthday. A few swigs and the pain in his chest starts to loosen, if not ease.
an idiot.
Cas beamed. “I’m so happy to see you, Dean. I—I missed you,” he said, looking down at his feet.
Castiel snorted. “God hates lawyers, didn’t you know?” And Dean’s resulting hearty laughter was absolutely worth making the terrible joke.
“You gotta tell me, Cas. Is it—is this—do you… like me? Like I like you? I mean… I’m kinda in love with you here?” He said it like it was a question, like if Cas said that he didn’t feel the same way, Dean could play it off as though he was only asking if what he was feeling was love and he could deny it plausibly later.
Castiel sighed. “Alright, alright. If Naomi directed you to be here, far be it from me to defy her wishes. I know how much she wants this program to succeed. Just – please know that I won’t have much for you to do, so you’re absolutely free to come and go as you please. If I do need help, I will let you know but otherwise, you’re more than welcome to board here for the next month if you like. If you want to leave early, I promise to write you an excellent recommendation for the work experience, as you said.”
Then he met Cas.
He sounded definitive, decided, and the thought gave the hope that bubbled in Castiel’s chest the tiniest of flutters.
“Want to go to Judy’s?”
“Yeah, she thought I was flirting with this dude in my history class, but we were just comparing notes,” Gabriel explained, slurring slightly. It’s getting later and he’s already had one drink more than either Dean or Cas, which is fine by Dean. He isn’t interested in drinking again so soon after his last episode, so he sips his beer slowly, ignoring Cas’s questioning glances.
The next morning, Castiel found Dean swiveling his hips like a young Elvis, round and around the kitchen, the smell of French toast permeating the air.
“Yeah, I…” Cas trails off, and Dean hitches up the towel, painfully aware of the flush spreading from his face all down his neck and probably covering his chest too. Dean isn’t terribly fit, but he hits the gym once in a while and all the physical labor he does when he picks up shifts at the mechanic shop around the block helps keep him more toned than he expects, given his diet consists mostly of bar pies and beer.
Still, he figured he should probably go outside and let Dean know he would be making lunch soon. Castiel’s eyes flicked up to the clock above the doorway, and he realized it was later than he thought. Not so late, though, that he needed to start cooking, but if he gave Dean maybe an hour’s warning, the man could finish up whatever it was he was doing and come inside to clean up, then join Castiel for a meal.
He wanted to know this man, inside and out, because he couldn’t imagine leaving any stone unturned when it came to Dean.
He stumbles back into the kitchen to take his shoes off and he throws them a little too hard near the door, boots slamming heavily on the tile.
Until now. He couldn’t get the image of Dean chopping wood out of his head, and he shivered all over every time he pictured it. At the same time that he felt hotblooded and tingly, he also felt deeply ashamed that he was lusting so badly over his guest.
Maybe they both could get some relief from hiding in their own little worlds.
“What—on
“Sounds unfortunate,” Dean said, glaring down at the picture, and Castiel had a ridiculous urge to burst out laughing. He controlled the impulse, and when Dean said nothing else, he returned to his notes.
Straightening up, Cas said, “Yes, if anything goes bump in the night, feel free to come to my room.”
And if he spends the rest of the night grinning like a dumbass, because not only is Cas not fucking his cousin—which is great on multiple counts, Dean thinks—but he openly checked Dean out, and Dean is not about to let that one go. Nobody needs to know, though, not just yet.
Their knees bumped under the table and Dean couldn’t stop grinning. He didn’t even blush at taking Cas’s hand in his, holding it there as they sipped their drinks and caught up, finally, words bubbling out of them, too many to have texted over the last several months.
Sure, he’d had a couple of flings here and there—handholding in high school with girls who thought he was cute but who would drop him when he froze at the idea of kissing them; a couple of secret trysts with guys who didn’t really return his feelings in college; losing his virginity to his one long-term boyfriend who ended up cheating on him at a party their senior year—but never anything that made him consider marriage. Castiel loved deeply but had never found anybody who loved him back. And he was okay with that.
Dean ducked his head, flushing red, though Castiel couldn’t imagine why. All he’d said was thanks.
A strange look flitted across Dean’s face, as though guilt and shame intermingled there but only for a second.
It was a trick of the light that Dean seemed to look almost disappointed, his eyes shifting from the floor back up to Cas and down again. Yes, Castiel definitely imagined the soft pout of his lips, and he knew he had to be strong in his resolve.
And spent hours talking with him over plates of French fries, where they could never agree on the ketchup placement—
Dean just didn’t know how to tell him. Or when was the right time to bring it up. All he knew was that he found plenty of excuses to keep driving through Pontiac, Illinois, where Cas taught history in the liberal arts department of a local community college, and every time he called up the professor, Cas was ready to meet him in an hour or less at their favorite place, Judy’s. Best pie in the Midwest – not that Dean would ever tell Bobby that. He might insult Bobby over the man’s rotgut scotch but he’d never say it to his face that Dean had found a better pie than his uncle’s own ancestral recipe.
Castiel set the plates in the sink and turned around, wiping his hands on a daisy-patterned towel. “I remembered last minute I needed to drop off some things for the church. Work stuff. I’m sorry I worried you.”
“Of course, man. You deserve to be spoiled too.”
Dean grinned. “You know, a honey-do list. Or a regular to-do list, if you prefer. I can’t keep cleaning, I’ll rub the laminate right off your countertops.” He rapped his knuckles against them and waited.
Castiel nodded, knowing exactly what Dean meant. “What was he like? Besides homophobic, I mean.”
He doesn’t, because he’s surprisingly not hungover—just tired, and then he remembers everything that happened the night before and the soreness in his jaw hits him like a brick. His face buzzes with the tingling sensation of a little road rash, as he likes to call it, the scrape of Cas’s stubble still fresh on his cheeks where they nuzzled against one another, cuddling close in bed and making out until they fell asleep, legs tangled together, Cas nosing at the dip in Dean’s shoulder and snuffling sleepily against his neck.
He didn’t, of course, because that would have been both strange and rude. Instead he retreated upstairs to shower, scrubbing the embarrassment off his skin. He used up all the hot water and by the time he finished his body was pink and hot to the touch.
“So you’re…?” Dean leaves the question hanging, not sure if he should even ask.
Cas winked.
Castiel had tried to avoid using the cliché of letting he who was without sin cast the first stone, as he felt it was extremely overused and often misunderstood by the general congregation. The same was true for people who liked to use the adage, “If you live in a glass house, you shouldn’t throw stones.” Instead he chose to quote Matthew 7:3, “First take the beam out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.” He’d written about not only self-reflection on one’s own sins and looking inward to work toward a life of piety, but also about how helping yourself before helping others is often the best way to live.
Later, when they’re properly tipsy, even Dean, who switches to water as soon as he realizes he keeps putting his hand on the back of Cas’s seat, absently scratching his nails up and down his roommate’s back every once in a while, Cas goes to break the seal and Gabriel whips around, no longer interested in whatever hockey game is going on.
Dean peeked over Castiel’s shoulder, lighting up at the spread on the table. “Aw man, you didn’t have to go to all this trouble. Thank you. And please, call me Dean. Mr. Winchester makes me sound so much older than I already am.”
Some time went by before they could meet up again, and Dean hated every month that passed without getting to look at Cas’s tired but pleased face as he talked about his students or as he babbled on about some lore. He wanted to look at those blue, blue eyes that held his gaze as Cas questioned him about his recent hunts, as Cas frowned and gasped in horror when Dean told him about near misses and injuries he’d sustained recently. He wanted to kiss away the wrinkle in Cas’s forehead, tell him he was alright, that nothing bad would happen to him, that he was right there. Dean wanted to be there for him.
Castiel groaned inwardly and returned to his kitchen table so he could mope over his work.
Blessedly, the professor had stayed up late, poring over an ancient text in some dead language. They enjoyed double bacon cheeseburgers while Cas chattered on about it, and then for dessert split a vanilla milkshake, Dean spooning the last drops from the metal shaker right into his mouth.
“What about that garden of yours?”
In the morning Dean didn’t immediately join Castiel for breakfast, and Cas, groggy from his five hours of sleep, didn’t think anything of it until he realized that the clock was pushing eight and Dean had been getting up two hours earlier than that. Military schedule, he remembered as he dug through the refrigerator.
“Whatcha doing, man?” he asks, the incident with that girl flying out of his head. Cas looks nice. Not that he doesn’t usually look nice; whereas Dean will grab whatever smells clean off his pigsty of a floor and throw it on, uncaring of wrinkles or small stains, Cas likes to look at least a little more put together. So a button-up isn’t unusual, but the way Cas’s hands are fumbling over the buttons are. The frown on his face is definitely out of place too.
Castiel nodded and walked back downstairs in a daze.
Castiel jumped, slightly. Good thing he wasn’t holding the full cups; he’d definitely have sloshed them all over and made a huge mess.
If his existence was lonely and, to be quite honest, boring with the use of two good hands, it multiplied tenfold without. Castiel was used to the solitude, and actually quite preferred it, given the nature of people he’d had the misfortune of encountering for most of his life. But he had a routine around his cabin, had a set schedule every day for himself. His mornings began between seven and eight a.m. with a cold washcloth to the face and a quick brushing of his teeth, then his daily prayer and meditations on his front porch if the weather was nice, inside if it wasn’t. He’d shower while the coffee pot growled to life, then fix himself a simple breakfast and catch up on the news. He set aside several hours to work. Freelancing for the church didn’t bring in a ton of money, but he had some side projects and regular clients outside of St. Henry’s that supplied him with a little extra cash. At some point he would finish and eat lunch if he was terribly hungry, have a cup of tea with toast if he wasn’t. He spent most afternoons clearing out the yard in preparation for his garden and most nights reading, listening to sermons or podcasts, and praying before bed.
Or he could wait.
“Oh hey, morning, sunshine. You got any other mugs? Don’t wanna take yours,” Dean said, like they’d been sharing a house for ages instead of less than twenty-four hours.
Instead all Dean said was, “Oh cool. You guys still close?”
“What? Yeah, yeah, ‘m fine. I’m just happy to finally catch a break. It’s been too long.”
But Dean chuckled again, and Castiel liked the sound of the throaty laugh so much that he almost hated himself for trying to dismiss the other man. Almost.
Another year of late-night trips to Judy’s went by before Dean worked up the courage to hold Castiel’s hand. Dean thought he was being slick, telling Cas some story about how Sammy’d nearly sliced off a finger in a vamp fight, grabbing the man’s hand before he could second-guess himself. Dean’s heart fluttered in his chest as he showed Cas where exactly Sam had nearly been bitten down to the knuckle, and Cas watched in horror but didn’t pull away from Dean.
He figured Dean deserved all of that, at the very least, especially for putting up with a prickly Castiel.
Dean came around to the other side of the table and leaned over Castiel, who stilled in his seat. He tried to remember how to breathe as Dean practically murmured in his ear.
Sometime around midday, Dean cracks an eyelid and groans at the sun poking him directly in his retina. He turns away, hauling the blanket with him, only there’s something solid holding it down and he can’t quite manage to pull the cover all the way over himself.
“Huh?” Dean asks, pretending not to know what Cas is talking about.
And Cas only had eyes for him. Dr. Novak, in his pressed blue pants and navy-and-grey sweater vest, caught sight of Dean waiting for him, and Dean had never seen him smile so big.
“What, no breakfast in bed?” Dean said, glancing at Castiel’s empty hands.
Dean doesn’t answer, and Gabriel gets distracted with fishing the cherry out of the bottom of his glass, as though he just casually drops bombs like that all the time and leaves everyone else to pick up the pieces. From the little Dean knows of him, it sure as hell seems that way.
And it didn’t stop Castiel from thinking about tearing the clothes off Dean’s body whenever Dean winked at him, throwing him completely off-guard and erasing whatever was on his mind, whatever he was about to say. He’d stand there while his body rebooted, though Dean would have already moved on to the next task, unaware of how deeply he affected Castiel.
Nothing in the house was out of place, so he wasn’t sure if Dean had even eaten dinner. When he checked the fridge, he saw that Dean had made himself the last of the leftovers, so grocery shopping was definitely a must first thing tomorrow morning.
He settled into a chair and bit into the BLT, moaning with delight.
Upstairs, Castiel led Dean to the second bedroom, a smaller guest room down the hall from his own. Enough space between them for privacy and escape whenever one of them would need it. Castiel didn’t like the thought of needing space in his own house, but he didn’t have a choice, it seemed. Dean was sticking around.
And damn him, everything in Castiel wanted to say yes. He wanted to invite Dean in for more than just a cup of coffee, wanted to spend hours unraveling the man before him, picking his brain about everything, his entire history, who he really was, what propelled him to sign up for the church’s program, how he got to be so good-looking and if it was genetics or luck or a combination…
“All of them are real, Cas,” Dean reminded him over a shared plate of crispy buffalo wings, complete with bleu cheese and celery sticks.
Dean has no idea what happens in art history that day, and he doesn’t even care.
It wasn’t until two years after they’d first met that Dean even started hugging Castiel whenever they’d meet. Dean and Sam had finished up a case over in Lafayette, a giant snapping turtle harassing people around a lake. Nothing ghostly or particularly violent, but they had to haul the reptile on a skateboard across four lanes of traffic to the marine center in the middle of the night. Not a feat Dean wanted to accomplish ever again.
“Is that why you went into the military?” Castiel asked, stroking his thumb over Dean’s knuckles. His skin was so soft under Castiel’s thumb and he wanted to hold it all night, fall asleep with Dean’s hand in his, wake up still attached.
“That’s absolutely terrible. How can you keep doing this job at risk to your limbs like that?” he asked, but Dean laughed it off.
He liked that diners served up any type of meal, anytime. He could go at two in the morning or two in the afternoon and get the same plate if he wanted. He could go after a night out of drinking when the bars closed at three, dragging Benny or Charlie out with him to soak up the whiskey in his stomach. He could go with any friend he wanted when he was on the road, passing through while he and Sammy worked, grabbing a BLT with Bobby or sharing a plate of disco fries with Donna and Jody if he felt like it.
reached across the bench seat and grasped Dean’s hand in his, warm and solid, grounding him for a moment. He only let go when Dean finally threw the car in park outside Cas’s building and they got out.
The man stuck out his right hand, then switched when he noticed the white cast around Castiel’s arm.
He made a note to bring it up to Naomi that maybe they should include an audio recording of some of St. Henry’s offerings.
Not that the thought totally escaped him. Maybe throwing himself down a mountainside would be preferable than facing Dean and having to dance around the fact that he had clearly been checking the other man out.
In an effort to be welcoming and genial, to return to his initial demeanor when Dean had first arrived, Castiel brought his work outside with him. He sat in one of his enormous Adirondack chairs, ones left over from the original owner, white paint chipped and peeling.
After dinner, Dean insisted on handling the dishes, although there weren’t many. He liked to clean as he cooked and Castiel appreciated that about him, since he operated in the same manner. Messes, he told Dean, were not allowed in his house growing up.
Dean leaned over Castiel’s shoulder and watched as Cas scrolled down on the website where the sermons were offered in neat little audio clips for those who couldn’t attend masses.
of two people who were learning each other’s movements and habits.
Very occasionally, when Dean Winchester wasn’t on a case, when his younger brother fucked off to the library for some light reading that had nothing to do with monsters, or when Sammy hit the local track field knowing Dean would never come with him, when nobody was actively trying to kill them – when he had time to himself – Dean liked to go to greasy spoon diners and sit for a while.
Dean beamed, and that settled it. He would check in with Castiel, but he clearly fell into his element with this project. In the days that followed, after they breakfasted together and Dean helped clean up, he started working early and finished late into the afternoons. He weeded, picked apart the landscaping and reworked it, sometimes two or three times before he was satisfied, and shouted out supplies to add to the ever-growing list that Castiel kept handy so they could take a mid-week trip to the hardware store later.
Castiel tried not to think of all the ways in which he would love to spoil Dean—with premium flannel shirts and a new pair of boots and a memory foam mattress if he could afford it, all the softest things he could wrap Dean in so he would always feel like he was being hugged. So he could always feel loved.
Cas chokes on his drink and Gabriel thumps him on the back.
“Fair warning, I might have to ditch phones once in a while. But I’ll keep your number in my wallet too so I can always program it into whatever new one I get,” Dean said, refraining from typing in “Professor Hottie” as the contact.
