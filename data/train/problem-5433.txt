Dean looked at the door with uncertainty. Castiel held a finger to his lips as he crossed to the door, opened it, and peered in.
Cas looked up at him, squinting against the sun before reaching under his pool chair and bringing out a bottle of water. A few drops of condensation flung off, making a trail from Cas’ chest as he brought it to his mouth, one finding its way into the dip in his clavicle. The corner of Dean’s mouth turned upward.
The bunker had private toilets, but the Men of Letters who constructed it apparently never saw fit to include showers with them. The showers were in their own room, a row of three stalls on a tile floor with drains under each. Cas pushed open the shower room door and was met with a room full of steam, through which he could see the shape of Dean standing under the water. The stall’s curtain sat open; Dean had clearly not expected anyone to interrupt him.
“Come on!” the girl covered in tequila whined. She used her other arm to brush the sea-swept dark hair out of her eyes, being careful not to spill the liquid, then winked at Dean. Who knew what possessed him, maybe just the thought of flirting with someone who actually seemed receptive, but his feet dragged him back to the bar.
Blue eyes full of concern were inches from his own. Dean could see relief flood them as Cas’ fraught expression cracked into a smile. Before he could register much else, Dean was being pulled up, held close to Cas’ face with unexpected tenderness.
spending my vacation babysitting the kid.”
He had to do something. Dean gingerly took Cas’ hand in his own and began to lift it up and over his waist. The fingers flexed, gripping his own. He froze.
Cas rolled his eyes. “They’re praying to God and the angels. I meet the criteria.”
Dean gave her an uneasy smile, his stomach squirming at the reminder of the cruise’s parameters. He tugged Cas behind him as they walked up the ramp onto the ship, where ropes of tinsel lined the handrail. They were greeted with a large wreath made of tropical flowers hanging from an archway placed over the entrance.
“Okay,” she laughed as she held it up. “Are you going to stand three feet apart, or act like you’re in love?”
He couldn’t make sense of the shouting voices as he felt arms wrap around his chest and drag him painfully slowly toward light. Dean finally felt air on his face again, but still couldn’t seem to inhale properly as he was pulled along. The edges of his vision began to darken as he finally felt sand dragging under his feet.
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “I’ll just...change back.”
The spread on the central table was truly something to behold. Every meat Dean could dream of eating, plentiful sides, and a selection of desserts that included multiple kinds of mouthwatering pie. He moved down the table, sampling a bit of everything and using Cas behind him to pick up what he couldn’t fit on his own plate. As they found seats, their plates clattered onto the table as gravity took its toll.
The people eating around them began to grumble around mouthfuls of food. Dean looked up at Cas with a shrug.
Those words sent Dean’s mind on a runaway spiral, a tangle of nerves squirming in his stomach. What did he mean, stay in? Stay here, in the cabin?
“No, I mean it,” Dean said, his face turning serious. “My whole life is like that. The moment things seem to be going okay is the moment I need to worry. The next thing you know, everything is broken again.” He picked up his drink and downed the rest of it.
, Cas. But I know you don’t feel the same, so I don’t know why we’re rehashing this.”
Cas didn’t look at him when he responded, instead focusing on the people milling on the deck below them. “You know, around.”
Once she and Andrew had played their hands (Kira busted with a twenty-three), the dealer flipped his remaining card, adding a ten to the eight already on the table. Dean and Cas received chips to match their bet, and Andrew, who had a hand of eighteen to match the dealer’s, was exactly where he’d begun.
Her partner, who’d stood by silently up to this point, gave a little smile and wave. His shoulder length wavy hair seemed made for life on a boat.
The decision was made for him as he saw Cas’ eyes open and turn his way. His breath caught as he watched Cas momentarily work through some of the same sleepy confusion he himself had just faced. Cas’ eyes then crinkled into a smile, causing a balloon to inflate somewhere around Dean’s navel.
. Cas paid careful attention to every inch of him, using his hands and mouth to slowly tease out Dean’s pleasure until he was writhing on the bed, vulnerable like he’d never been before. His pupils were blown out and needy, leaking tears as his angel touched him, drawing him to the edge before letting him back down, over and over again.
Dean opened a single bleary eye. “Why?”
Cas guided him further into the room, shutting the door behind them. Dean, unwilling to detach, bumped into a dresser then nearly fell over his boots on the floor. Their lips broke apart in nervous laughter, the grins remaining while Dean caught his breath, still nose-to-nose with Cas, feeling uncharacteristically shy as he glanced into his magnetic blue eyes. He’d always broken contact before, tried not to stare for too long, but finally allowing himself to take Cas in like this left him feeling like a teenager again, all awkward and giddy. The reality of what was happening caught up with him, and Dean couldn’t help but let out a disbelieving chuckle.
Dean smiled. “Better than okay.”
Cas looked down, opening the coat slightly with a furrowed brow. “It’s what I wear.”
Dean, who had been newly eighteen when the film released, felt himself aging into dust. “I bought a ticket to it, because I
“Hey, uh, honey,” he said. “What’s going on?”
“Cas?” Dean looked around, blinked a few times. Cas released him and the small crowd around them began to disperse, either relieved or slightly disappointed that they wouldn’t witness a tragic death today. Two couples stayed behind, staring at him in disbelief.
“Want me to take that for you?” a voice cut in, and Dean nearly dropped his phone. He put some distance back between himself and Cas, out of reflex.
“Oh,” Cas said, eyes wide. He held a paper bag out to Dean. “I, uh, brought breakfast?”
He clinked glasses with her, and downed the remainder of his drink. He was too sober to examine that toast too closely.
Dean considered making a run for it then, braving any wind or rain outside to find the nearest bar to hunker down in, taking advantage of his unlimited alcohol again to ignore what was happening right now.
“Shh,” came a whisper, lips softly grazing his ear as new weight caused the mattress to dip behind him.
to sleep. I’ll just stay in...the chair.”
“No problem,” she said. “You guys are cute. I’m Kira Leigh. This is Andrew.”
Dean clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Think that’ll look a bit out of place on a tropical getaway?”
Cas spoke up. “We should go.” He helped Dean to his feet, pulling his arm over Cas’ shoulders to stabilize him. He turned back to the couple. “I’ll take him to the ship’s sick bay to get checked out, but I think he’ll be okay.”
“Not just relaxin’. Fun. I like spending time with you. Like this.”
“Is that why you wanted to take Sam instead of me?”
A reality show called
“No, I don’t think so.” Dean gulped, wishing he hadn’t finished his drink. “I guess I just thought it would be easier. All this coupley stuff, pretending…”
“I was finished anyway,” Dean said as the announcement ended and tossed his napkin bib onto the table. “You might need to roll me back to the cabin, though.”
, hard to coexist without overanalyzing their every move. Truthfully, this had probably happened years ago, forced into dormancy by Dean’s refusal to let himself entertain the notion, to let himself feel. Every touch shared between them now brought turmoil, because he couldn’t tell Cas to
“Yeah?”
“What’s funny?” asked Cas from the doorway.
He stood next to Cas in front of the camera, giving the tiniest hint of a smile he thought he could get away with.
“I bought a few things at the market where you left me,” Cas continued, ignoring him, “but when Andrew came running up, I dropped them.” He smiled. “Some stray probably got a nice dinner tonight.”
“If your heavenly healing powers have begun to fail, we’ve got a bigger problem on our hands.” Dean picked up the remote and clicked the TV on. “Come on, Cas, I’m fine.”
“It could,” Cas agreed. “But when has that ever stopped us from doing something?”
“Hit me,” Dean told the dealer. The dealer flipped another card his way, an eight of spades. With a total of twenty, Dean gestured to stay.
“Thanks,” Dean told her as she handed the phone back. He let his arm slowly fall from around Cas.
Cas frowned. “What do you mean?”
Cas shrugged, a tiny smile emerging as he turned and left the cabin. Once he was alone, Dean exhaled. This week was going to be more difficult than he’d expected.
“I didn’t understand.” He thought back, remembered Cas’ voice breaking through his alcohol-soaked semi-consciousness. He took a deep breath, unsure if he wanted an answer to what he had to ask. “What did you say?”
Cas looked at him with curiosity, then slowly moved his hand toward the bird, cupping it in his hand while it chirped in alarm. He cooed softly at it, pulling it close to his chest.
Half of the strange duo looked up, his blond hair pushed down under a backwards cap that irritated Dean further.
“I didn’t say it made sense, alright?”
“I’m going to go explore the ship.” Cas told him, turning to leave. “I’ll meet you there if I don’t see you before.”
“Listen, Cas. You know I’d fight a thousand angry monsters alone if it meant keeping you safe, right? I love you.” The words had come tumbling out without warning, and even Dean’s mouth fell open slightly as he realized what he’d said. “Uh...I mean, if that’s okay.”
They could hear noises of sloppy contentment coming from a kissing couple several feet away; as they lay back on the towel and their limbs intertwined it was hard to tell where one body ended and the other began. Dean caught Cas smiling at them and voiced his reaction before he could think better of it.
Dean tried to focus on the sounds around them instead. There was a tiny intermittent chirping, carrying over the sounds of people on the deck.
“Broken things can be fixed,” he said, opening his hands to show Dean the bird again, its wing repaired. A moment of clarity rushed Dean as it hit him all over again that he’d fallen so hard there should have been an audible
Cas stared at him for a moment before taking his trenchcoat off. He held out his hands as if to ask
Cas kissed him again and lowered him onto the bed, laying him on top of the discarded trenchcoat before slowly removing Dean’s boxers, letting his fingers run the length of Dean’s legs until the last article of clothing was out of sight. He kissed along the inside of Dean’s thighs as he moved back up his body, not giving him the opportunity for insecurity as the last of his flesh was laid bare. He unconsciously raised his hips to meet Cas’ face, and was rewarded with tiny teases of tongue along his shaft that stole his breath.
“Not this week, it’s not. I packed you some shirts and shorts.”
Cas looked at him quickly, then away. “What do you think?”
Kira Leigh giggled, nodding at Cas. “Careful! You better lock this one down before someone else comes along.”
The more questions that passed, the more Dean started to wonder how closely he’d been watched all these years. From inane details like shoe size to things they almost lost out on because Dean barely knew how to answer (what Disney character
“Are you finished eating?”
Cas narrowed his eyes at the flowers. “Why?”
Cas seemed to understand enough to leave him alone with his thoughts for a while before putting a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder.
The night before, Dean had eventually fallen asleep, only to wake this morning to a note from Cas on the bedside table.
Cas brought them into the tiny bathroom, struggling to turn around and shut the door behind him. When he emerged, Dean was momentarily speechless. Cas had worn variations of the same outfit for all the years they’d known each other. Stripped of the trenchcoat and suit, he looked...great. Not relaxed, exactly, but like he’d taken off a layer of armor.
A sad sort of smile crossed the angel’s face. “The normal things, mostly. Money, happiness. It’s remarkable how many of them, on a couples cruise, are in here alone, praying for love.”
“You know I don’t need to—”
“Merry Christmas, Cas.”
“That’s something,” Dean said, holding up a hand to feel the air. “I keep forgetting it’s nearly Christmas. You think there’s a nativity scene onboard somewhere, little baby Jesus in an innertube?”
As the two of them finally broke off from the crowd and made it to their cabin’s hallway, the ship pitched again and knocked them sideways. Dean’s back hit the wall and Cas’ body landed on his, knocking the breath out of his chest. Cas began to right himself before the ship shifted further still and held his weight, pinning them both to the wall. And
Cas stopped suddenly in front of a double door, embossed with small golden letters reading CHAPEL.
He rolled onto his side, facing the door. The minutes without him dragged by, and eventually Dean gave up on pretending that he didn’t want Cas to walk through.
She narrowed her eyes. “You’re not going to buy anything?”
Dean was now very awake as he pulled away quickly, his mind launching into panic as he tried to surreptitiously wipe the drool he’d left near Cas’ collarbone away. A foggy memory of the night before surfaced. Cas turning up, a drowsy invitation…He had spoken up, and Cas had joined him.
,” Dean groaned, and he could swear he felt Cas’ smile widen against his face.
Dean shrugged. Eric flashed a larger-than-average smile at them and continued. “Alrighty then! Just get settled in one of the seats and wait for the show to begin.”
“So take Jack with you. I’m sure that would be a learning experience.”
“Some vacation this turned out to be, huh?”
Dean wasn’t prepared for that. “I…”
Dena shook his head as he remembered that event. “You mean you enjoyed terrifying that poor dude who had to play your apprentice?”
"What do you think will happen to our alternate selves? You think they'll make it without the trust funds and private jets?"
He winced in sympathy when the man tripped and banged his knee against the coffee table. He would've face planted splendidly onto the carpet had it not been for Castiel.
Dean woke up the next day feeling much better than he had in a long time. He dragged himself out of bed when his stomach rumbled.
"Uh yeah."
He was still getting used to seeing Castiel in other clothes and honestly, Dean thought it was a crime against mankind that he'd put on so many layers of clothes all these years.
Sam cleared his throat awkwardly. "Hey."
"Me or the coffee?"
After that incident, kisses in the kitchen were deliberately chaste, nothing more than a peck on the forehead, mouth, cheek or all three. It was an unspoken thing between them and every morning Castiel never failed to press his lips against Dean's as soon as he got back from his run.
Face red, Dean all but flew across the room to turn off the lights and turn on the movie.
How long would he hide his feelings from everyone including himself? Besides, in his heart, Dean held onto the belief that his love for Castiel wasn't completely unrequited.
"Right."
Both of them had been nothing but supportive.
"So is that a yes for the professor thing?" Dean asked when they broke apart, sounding rather breathless to his own ears.
"Uhh... about that, I might've gotten carried away with it last night," Jack confessed sheepishly. "It wasn't intentional."
"Right... uh yeah. Me too."
Dean rolled his eyes fondly and turned slightly so that he could press a quick kiss to the dark haired man's lips. "Cas, sweetheart, as much as I'd love to stay exactly where I am, I did promise the kids their favourite breakfast and we both know you couldn't cook if your life depended on it so you've gotta let me go."
"Come on, Dean. You were right, breakfast is getting cold."
Life was unfair.
"Sorry," Castiel murmured absently, not sounding sorry at all as he pressed yet another kiss to Dean's jaw before lightly nipping the man's neck. "You can hardly blame me when you look so... bewitching. Besides, consider this repayment for when you
"How are you?"
He cleared his throat. "Uh yeah... sure."
"Our home," Dean mumbled, suddenly bashful. "We could get a little place of our own, nice bedrooms, a proper kitchen, maybe even an outdoor kitchen on the deck, a bathroom that isn't filled with a million of Sam's hair products, and one of those fancy ass shower units."
Dean snorted. "Never denied it, buddy. Guess what I'm trying to say that it's a good look on you, ya know? Very sexy." And oh it really was.
Sam took the single and grumbled briefly until Eileen sat down in his lap, wrapping one arm around his shoulders and throwing her legs over the arm of the sofa. He turned a little pink but was clearly pleased and curled an arm around his girlfriend's waist.
Dean Winchester had always been a man of action. Where his words failed him, actions took over and did what his voice couldn't. This time was no different.
He wrapped his arms tightly around Castiel and buried his face into the angel's neck. Strong arms embraced him back, holding him securely. He felt the other man's warm lips press against his temple and smiled goofily into the tan trench coat. The angel's hands were firm but gentle as they rubbed his back steadily, running through his hair and interwoven with soft kisses to his head.
It had been twelve years but Dean still remembered the night they'd met like it was yesterday. And he knew just how clichéd that sounded but it was the truth.
He glanced down at his watch and decided it was time he went to his room and tried to get some sleep. He was well aware that sleep wouldn't come to him anytime soon, but you couldn't blame a man for hoping.
For some unfathomable reason, he found the new addition of silver ridiculously hot. Okay so his boyfriend is sexy and maybe Dean is drooling just a little bit.
One of those days, Dean was gonna put hair remover in Sam's shampoo. If it weren't for Sam Winchester's enthusiasm to introduce the concept of jogging to the newly human Castiel, the latter would've still been in bed.
"Jerk."
Normally, if they weren't out saving the world and kicking monster ass, Tuesday was movie night. Dean would be the one to pick the movie, but that evening Jack had asked (read: pleaded) to be allowed to choose.
"And I most certainly love only
Jack whispered something in Sam's ear and the man nodded. "Yeah, buddy. I've got your nougat. Yep, lots  of it. We'll eat it after lunch."
"You're blaming yourself for what happened. It's not your fault."
There were times where they could have been happy but Dean had chosen to be bitter, closed off and angry. What if he lost him and there was no return this time?
"Oh he's coming with us. Between me and Sam, I'm the one who knows how to cook and I let him eat that sugary cereal of his. Besides, who else will teach him how to fix the Impala? You, me, Jack. Maybe we can get a dog too."
Dean blew a raspberry at him or rather, he attempted a very poor one. "No m'not. M' just peachy. Watch and learn, sunshine."
*****
Dean was willing to admit (
Dean then glared at his brother who smirked back at him knowingly.
Laughing to himself, the taller man shook his head. Yep. Someone was definitely in a
They drank their coffee in a less awkward silence than before.
Dean closed the story book and glanced at the kids. Claire was already fast asleep in Castiel's lap, face buried into her dad's t-shirt; while Jack was still blinking up at his dads, his eyelids drooping.
He should probably blame it on all the shopping, packing and moving they'd been doing recently. It had taken a couple of months to finally move out of the Bunker. After much deliberation, he and Castiel had agreed on a nice little two-storeyed place with a welcoming garden in the front and a backyard that Dean was quite in love with.
Sam rolled his eyes at the nephilim. "Jack, buddy, this thing rots your teeth." His words came out more like a half hearted huff than the reprimand he'd had in mind. He couldn't be mad at the kid if he tried.
"Once is plenty for my ego." He still hadn't forgotten that day. He wasn't old. No matter what a bunch of kids said. "Where is Cas?" He asked again.
By the end of it, Sam was grinning like a madman. “I’m happy for you, man. Seriously, you deserve it.”
activities.
And then his hands tightened on Dean's hips, tugging him into a searing kiss.
That was the only word that came close to describing the feeling of pure bliss that washed over him every morning since the past three months. Three months since Chuck and all those other sons of bitches had been gone for good.
"You're staring." Castiel's voice is amused and he hadn't moved from his spot. He didn't even have to look at Dean to catch him.
Jack's hands clutched the back of his shirt tightly and he buried his face against Dean's shoulder and mumbled yet another heartfelt apology.
They went out to the backyard where they normally held their barbecue parties.
They stopped hunting, for good. It had taken Dean a while to convince himself that it was okay to sit back for once, that after everything they had done, they deserved a break. Now that they weren't out hunting or trying to save the world, they had time for themselves.
"Well, you weren't all that happy when the other Dean was making heart eyes at Cas."
"And then Christopher Robin said to Pooh, 'Silly old bear.' They boy and his bear then walked back into the Hundred Acre Wood, with the pot of honey firmly wrapped in the bear's arms."
. Sure, he'd loved Cassie and he had cared deeply for Lisa. But Castiel was different. Dean Winchester was in love with Castiel. Utterly, madly, truly. He was Dean's happily ever after, his forever, his ultimate win.
"Stuff?" Castiel inquired and Dean didn't have to meet his eyes to see the amused glint in those blues.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yeah yeah. You're the one who started dragging my boyfriend outta bed every morning for your stupid jogging shit."
Castiel rolled his eyes but agreed nonetheless.
"You're an amazing boyfriend, Cas."
"Dean?"
"We'll probably stay here until we've got enough cash to move farther away from you guys. It's not safe with you know... God."
The deep laugh was reply enough. “I think I’ve grown quite attached to the term.”
Dean felt a lump in his throat and a suspicious burning behind his eyes. Castiel was standing so close. If Dean moved just a bit, he'd be able to rest his head on the angel's shoulder, maybe press himself against him and bury his face in Castiel's neck.
The question made Dean turn back around. "Me? Cas, I'm fine. How is he?" On taking a closer look, he could see the dried tear tracks on the nephilim's face. "I thought nephilims don't sleep."
Getting out of bed was easier said than done considering the forearm that had a powerful grip on his waist. That and he didn't feel like getting out of bed, perfectly content, ensconced in the arms of one currently sleeping Castiel Novak.
They decided it would be wise to get up now-— for real— before Sam or Jack (
"It's a three hour drive."
“Dean, your love was in no manner unrequited.” Castiel’s lips quirked upward into a small but sincere and almost bashful smile. “I’ve also loved you since uh... freaking forever.”
It didn't help that Dean was in love with his best friend, who wasn't just sinfully gorgeous but incredibly kind-hearted, adorable and downright dorky at times.
Dean's breath caught in his throat on that confession. The burning behind his eyes returned twofold.
Not to mention, Castiel was undeniably attractive. All those years of stolen glances in the darkness of the Impala or in the silence of dimly lit motel rooms hadn't been enough for Dean. He could look now, without any fear or hesitation.
. Sometimes, Dean forgot that Castiel was actually a bajillion years old.
They were literally in a fight against God and no one knew how this would end. For all they knew, the entire world could be gone any day now.
Maybe he was just pissed that the other him had the balls to do the very things he had wanted to do for a long time but had been too afraid.
"Dean?" There was a question in Castiel's voice and Dean was certain he didn't imagine the hitch in his tone when the angel said his name.
"Friend? What friend? Is it one of your halo buddies?" Dean asked even as he got up to follow Castiel out.
He went downstairs to the kitchen and turned on the coffeemaker before getting out the ingredients he needed.
Castiel pulled away first smiling softly, his thumb stroking Dean's cheek in a manner he'd never dared to do before.
He climbed in from the other side and drew the covers over the both of them, throwing his arm around Dean and tugging him close.
The trek up the stairs was relatively short. It would've been even shorter if Dean hadn't insisted on stopping at every alternate step to wax poetic about Castiel's eyes, Castiel's hands and just Castiel in general.
Dean nodded sincerely. Jack definitely had the three of them on his team.
muscular body above him, but also by the intensity of those blue eyes that seemed to render all his faculties useless.
"You could always come with us."
"We're getting married? You and me? To each other, right?"
"Yeah, bud?" Dean prompted, absently wiping the kid's face with a napkin.
"First of all, they aren't in Brazil because they're not billionaires anymore. I gave them my number before they left so that they'd reach out if they ever needed help. You have to understand that they don't know anyone from our world. And lastly, they aren't as bad as you make them out to be. That Dean sends me a text message every now and then to check in. In fact, that Dean is quite... charming."
"Right...yeah, this way."
He turned his head to grin at the two of them, but it was just his Sasquatch of a baby brother who came inside. "Where's Cas?"
to poor Dean. They'd been married for seven years now and that morning voice still affected him the same way each time.
Thinking back fondly to that evening from last month, Castiel grinned. "I'm not your boyfriend, Dean."
”Dammit I knew it was a bad idea to let you watch that movie. You’re not watching it again.”
"Sam was just telling me that De—"
”That was fun indeed.”
Castiel appeared amused. "I'm not sure if you're aware, Dean, but it isn't the asscrack of dawn. It's past eight."
Dean shrugged slightly. "You said you saw paradise. What was it like? I've always wanted to ask."
"Cas?"
Jack was their kid. He was family. In that moment, Dean wanted nothing more than to hug the kid and tell him it was okay, that they were going to be okay.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Jack and I are hungry."
Dean was thankful that the darkness hid the heat creeping up his neck and cheeks. "I know I don't show it but I care about you a lot."
"What about me and Claire?"
"Yeah, can't argue with that." Sitting up as well, Dean pressed a kiss to Castiel's hair. "We should probably get started on dinner," he admitted, albeit reluctantly. How was he suppose to resist someone who was so deliciously irresistible?
Jack nodded seriously. "Like a bear. An angry bear."

"Dean—"
clear. He would never forget the look on his fiancé's face when he'd seen all of Castiel's tattoos for the first time. It was on their fourth date. Dean had gaped at him speechless before turning the deepest shade of red, all the way up to the tips of his ears and down his neck, thereby sending Castiel's ego skyrocketing to new heights. It was always thrilling to catch the normally snarky man off guard and dare he say flustered and time hadn't changed that one bit.
"I'm coming too," he stated.
"Dean, you have beer on your shirt." Castiel pointed out rather unhelpfully.
He refused to think of that. He tightened his fingers on the wheel till his knuckles turned white and swallowed thickly.
"Whatcha reading, buddy?"
Castiel raised his left eyebrow in disapproval at his crude words and Dean tried not to focus on how hot that was.
Castiel sighed. It was one of those patented long suffering sighs that came from dealing with a stubborn dumbass for far too long. "Very well."
Dean shamelessly ogled the strong set of his jaw, his chiselled cheekbones, untameable dark hair silvering at the temples, the way the sweat drenched navy t-shirt clung to Castiel's skin, blatantly betraying the toned body underneath. At a glance, Castiel was all hard lines and sculpted muscles: intimidating, powerful and intense, but then his eyes settled on Dean and he smiled. It was one of those indulgent, gummy, soft-hearted half smiles that were reserved solely for Dean and Dean only. It softened his whole posture and if said man turned gooey, then it was nobody's business.
"Nope."
Feeling brave, he stepped closer to Castiel, lacing their fingers together and turned so that they were standing chest to chest instead of shoulder to shoulder. Hardly daring to breathe, he reached out his other hand and curled it around the back of the angel's neck and leaned in so that their foreheads were resting against each other.
"You should rest," Castiel told him once all wounds had been dealt with. "And you're an idiot," he added. "A reckless idiot."
Rolling his eyes, Dean gave Sam a short run through of last night’s events (
Dean quickly whipped up some pancakes and bacon for himself, Sam and Jack before making a PBJ sandwich for Castiel (even though he didn't need food)  since everything else apparently tasted like molecules.
He glared at his little brother who was looking at him with that shit-eating grin. Of course he should have known that Sam wouldn't let it go that easy. Not when Sam was the only one who knew the truth about Dean's feelings for the angel.
He tried not to let it bother him when the other guy sat a little too close to Castiel or the way the angel chuckled softly when he said something that wasn't even that funny! And couldn't Castiel see that the knock off Dean was hitting on him?
What could he do but fall even more in love with him?
Castiel didn't bother to suppress a fond smirk. "
The man in question poured himself some coffee and  pushed himself up to sit on the island.
Castiel tilted his head slightly and frowned. "Why would that make you tingly? Are you hurt somewhere, Dean?"
They were standing close enough that their shoulders were brushing but still not close enough for Dean's liking.
Dean had discovered he liked guys when he was around eighteen. Of course he hadn't told anyone then and he'd never acted on it either, but that small little
crying. Whatever, bitch... Yeah sure thing, tell the kid we'll watch the movie tomorrow, promise... uh huh, yeah, yeah okay. Bye."
"Not happening. Drop it."
Contrary to the wicked smirk dancing on his lips, Castiel's voice was  incredibly fond when he replied "
"What about you?"
The other man curled his hand around the back of Dean's neck and drew him closer until his upper half was nearly in Castiel's lap.
"Hello, Dean," the angel greeted as he moved to sit on the bed. Castiel places his palm on Alternate Dean's forehead and there was a blue glow from under his hand as the bruises on his face healed. He then did the same to the injured man's chest as well.
The dark haired man didn't say anything after that, simply content to let Dean work whilst he trailed soft, unhurried kisses from the back of Dean's neck to his cheek.
Neither of them spoke after that and the rock music was the only noise in the car.
All words froze in his throat when he took in the scene before him.
"So which floor was it?"
That’s it. He wasn’t gonna be watching any of those disgustingly soft romcoms anymore (
They took Claire to her room and tucked her in as well, complete with Mr. Snuggles.
Said man choked on his beer and coughed, cursing when some of it spilled on his shirt.
Castiel didn't reply verbally, choosing to kiss him soundly instead.
one of the many delightful comforts available to mankind. Especially the one we took this morning. I recall you liking it almost more than me. You were quite...
"Good. You better."
But Sam wasn't offended. "Honestly? It's not too bad. We're just lucky to be alive. We found this place a couple of weeks ago and Dean- well my Dean got a job at a bakery close by. He's always loved baking since he was a kid so he was elated to take the job. He bakes a mean pie."
There, Dean saw his alternate self sitting up on the bed against the headboard with his chest bandaged rather messily. Judging by the blood seeping through the bandage, Alternate Sam hadn't done a very good job. Alternate Dean was also sporting an impressive black eye.
”Need to buy milk and pick up the dry cleaning. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it tomorrow,” Castiel reassured him.
"You're staring," Castiel commented fondly, smirking at Dean over the rim of his mug.
The angel sighed, looking equal parts of annoyed and fond. "How have you been?"
He leaned against the car and closed his eyes for a moment.
"We're here," Dean pulled up in front of the address that Castiel had told him. It was an apartment building, nothing fancy and flanked by similar buildings. The neighbourhood was silent, considering that it was made up of only residential buildings and it was nearly midnight.
His face melted into a relieved grin when he saw the angel.
Movie night always happened in the Dean-cave (
"Tell you later," Dean promised.
But then he glanced down at his hand that was holding Castiel's and decided that it was worth it.
"I'll take it under advisement," Castiel teased, obviously pleased with himself. "What else do you have in mind?"
Oh Dean definitely knew all about that. He'd experienced the effects of that temper first hand many times.
The angel gave him one of those half smiles that always made Dean weak at the knees (like a goddamn teenager with a crush).
Clearing his throat, Dean wet his lips. "I uh... I might be open to that." He swallowed audibly and locked eyes with Castiel who looked like he wanted nothing more than to devour him right there.
On the first day, he'd simply worn it as a joke. Then Cas had returned from his morning run and kissed him right there in the middle of the kitchen. The kiss had turned into a full on make out session. Poor Sam Winchester had been unfortunate enough to accidentally witness that and whilst he wasn't scarred for life, it was pretty damn close.
Alternate Dean wouldn't stop flirting and it didn't help that Castiel was completely oblivious to the guy's advances.
At that moment, Dean chose to wake up. He stirred awake with a grunt, clearly having slept
Dean was allowed to do that.
The angel raised an eyebrow in confusion. "I'm an angel, Sam. I don't sleep. I was keeping Dean company."
He would never let anyone near those luxurious locks other than his beloved niece.
"I love every part of you: I love how you care about those around you. You make fun of Sam's
"I have to go." He announced when he returned from the call.
"What do you mean you have to go? Where? Who was it?"
The other man furrowed his brow and tilted his head in confusion. "I can assure you I am completely human."
This was normally the part where he'd clap the angel on the shoulder and make a beeline for the door before things got too fuzzy for his liking. But for some reason, he felt emboldened that night.
”As you wish.”

"Dean."
Dean huffed and propped himself up to glare at Castiel. "Easy for you to say. You're not the one who will have to deal with Sam's constant I-told-you-so. He's had to deal with my pining, the whole unrequited crush and that I've been in love with you since freaking forever."
"Eat up, kid."
“Cas, we’re nearly out of eggs. And bacon too. Plus we nee—“
“Actually, I was thinking Jack and I would handle it. You and Cas could... you know? Hang out. Go to lunch, dinner... stuff.
"We could host barbecues with Jody, her girls, Donna, Garth and the whole family with baby Sam and Castiel... make a proper thing of it." Even as he said it, the words left think reeling with disbelief. All along, he'd never even thought of having a life so perfectly... normal. "I won't let you do any of the actual cooking though," he teased with a mischievous smirk. "You might've been a terrifying Commander of angels, but you are an even more terrifying disaster in the kitchen, ex-multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent or not. "
"You certainly are very possessive as far as pie is concerned."
Had Chuck messed up his genetic make up by dumping a truckload of sappy fuzziness into his system?
Dean smirked at his brother. "Okay. Just remember to put a sock on the door."
"You do make a compelling argument," Castiel accepted and Dean heard the smile in his voice.
He pulled back and smiled at Dean. "Happy is a good look on you,
stupid face." Castiel pressed a kiss to Dean's cheek.
"You mean like how Dean is with Cas? Does that mean Dean is whipped?"
"As long as you two promise to do the same," Eileen countered with a knowing grin.
This meant he’d finally get at least some modicum of reprieve from the constant tension (
He opened the door and what he saw made his heart melt and clench painfully at the same time.
In no universe had Dean ever imagined he would go against his father. Sam had always been the bold one, the rebel. Turns out their roles had been reversed in this other universe. Over here, Dean was always the good son, the obedient one. Never the type to disregard John's wishes.
Castiel's voice was little over a deep rumble, careful not to wake the kid sleeping in his arms. The voice made Dean shiver pleasantly. He always found Castiel's voice soothing.
Dean was happy. Like free pie forever happy.
Not quite ready to go to bed yet, the two of them turned on a movie in the living room. They settled for watching The Godfather (again) since Dean insisted that Castiel hadn't been paying attention the last time.
Dean worked in silence after that, whipping up some scrambled eggs and bacon for all of them.
“I think I love you.” Cas’s smile lit up his whole face. It was like staring at the sun.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Sleep well, Dean.”
“What’s up, Cas?”
“Cas.”
“Hmm?”
“Dean, Meg is my friend. Maybe even my best friend after you. You understand that, don’t you?” Dean couldn’t meet his eyes. Cas steamrolled on. “I told her to sleep well because I care about her, but if it bothers you that much, I won’t say it to her again.” Dean groaned and took his hand back.
Cas turned off the bedside lamp and pulled Dean back flush against his chest. Dean could feel the steady rhythm of Cas’s heartbeat. Dean grinned in the dark. He grabbed the hand that Cas had draped across his stomach and dropped a kiss to his knuckles before closing his eyes. And there, in the darkness, right before he nodded off, Cas kissed the top of his head and whispered,
“Hey, Cas?”
. It’s a typical saying, right? Nothing to freak out over. Sure it’s maybe a bit more
Dean’s eyes fluttered shut as Cas pressed a soft, chaste kiss to his lips.
“I thought it was an us thing, okay? I don’t really know why I’m even in here right now. It just… bothers me.” Cas took another step forward and hesitantly brought one hand up to cup Dean’s face, the other sliding into place at the nape of his neck. He grabbed at Dean’s hair gently and lightly stroked his thumb along Dean’s jaw. Dean was practically frozen.
Dean opened his eyes to see Cas regarding him impassively, keeping a carefully neutral face as he waited for Dean’s brain to stop imploding.
“What’s this?” Cas gave a small smile and his gaze dropped to Dean’s mouth.
overcompensating. God why did he just barge in like that? Cas cocked his head to the side and squinted up at Dean, trying to figure him out. A look of fond understanding crossed his face. He stood up and carefully took Dean’s hand in both of his.
“Sleep well, Dean.” Sleep well.
Dean thinks he can pinpoint when it first started. It was the anniversary of Mary Winchester’s death. He had holed up quietly in his room, drank maybe a bit too much, and woke up the next morning feeling absolutely awful. But, per every year since he had opened up about his childhood and grief, Cas had left some ibuprofen and a glass of water on his bedside table at some point after he had passed out.
“Funny how you obey him more than the angels,” Metatron yelled. Cas didn’t pause in his pursuit. As soon as he was gone, Ruby’s knife was lifted to Metatron’s throat and Dean was bent over him, authority and hatred in his eyes. Metatron flinched backwards, startled by the sudden aggression from Dean.
“What?” Dean repeated in the same tone as before, in disbelief over how the conversation was panning out.
“Dean?” he questioned.
“You should go see her, then.”
“Please?” she begged, “You deserve some recognition for what you did. You three—you’re saviors.”
“Shut up,” Dean snapped and Sam just laughed. Dean glanced at his brother, who was as happy as he was and he couldn’t help but smile. The two rode off, and when they got home after eating Dean crashed on his bed and rested better than he had in a very long time.
"Of course I do. I know everything," Amara whispered.
“Angel, huh?” he spoke and Cas nodded, standing up. “Where are they in all of this?”
“Who killed them?” Cas asked, but his question was answered soon enough.
“Operations? Okay—wow, so what are you all? Surgeons gone rogue?” Dean questioned.
“Awesome, great work! I knew you had it in you,” Dean spoke, patting the angel on the shoulder as the two scurried out of the basement and into the house they were being held captive at. “Now we just need to find our stuff.”
“That would be nice, yes,” Castiel replied.
“Yeah, everything is fine,” Dean lied, not wanting to talk about what he was feeling. “What, do you not think he deserves the break I’m giving him?”
“Yes, I do. We can’t just shake that off, Cas. What I did to you, back when Charlie was killed—that was uncalled for.” Dean spoke genuinely with self-hatred in his voice. “I shouldn’t have attacked you…that was the last thing in the world I wanted to do, but I was so angry and confused. Hyped up on The Mark, but that’s no excuse. You were doing what you thought was right, and it was all to save me. Hell, Cas, everything you do is to save me, and honestly…I don’t know why you and Sammy try so hard.”
“It doesn’t matter,” the older woman interrupted, running her fingers through the hair of her grandson who sat next to her. She became emotional, pulling him close, “You saved us. You are our heroes. We will do whatever you need us to.”
“Alright, alright,” Dean agreed. “Let’s head out, we can make it by midnight.”
“I’ve always kind of known that I don’t see you the same way I see my brother—but that’s not a bad thing, it doesn’t mean we aren’t family, it just means…I feel…something more towards you that I’m unfamiliar with and it scares the crap out of me because I feel like everyone I care about gets hurt, and I don’t want to ever see you hurt,” Dean bowed his head, breaking his stare with the angel. He felt ashamed and scared, “I’m not used to letting my guard down like this.”
“Because the two of you are friends—you owe it to each other that much. I mean, here you and I are, making a food run or whatever without talking about anything supernatural, why can’t you do the same with Cas? Sit down, talk about something that doesn’t have the words darkness, Amara, Metatron, ghosts, demons, or end of the world in them and just get to know each other a bit more. You may find out more about yourself if you do that,” Sam elaborated. Dean fell silent.
Dean sat alone in the kitchen.
“You said that what you want, you can’t have,” Dean spoke finally, not looking Castiel in the eyes.
“He did,” Dean said, a swell of pride fluttering in his chest. He walked around the table and approached Castiel before finally bringing him in close, wrapping his arms around him in a tight embrace. Castiel closed his eyes, taking Dean in. He was warm and rigid. Dean relaxed himself. He sighed deeply, calmly, and Castiel could hear a smile in his breath.
“Dean…I—I don’t know what to say…”
“Is this real? Are you real?” Dean asked sternly.
“And there you go, defending me,” Dean chuckled. His mood had been completely altered by the incident, and that delighted Castiel.
“Let me help you,” Cas whispered, sitting Dean up. He helped him back up against the pillar and the two sat down, Dean leaning on Cas for support, his face scrunched in pain and his body hunched over in an attempt to ease the throbbing in his stomach. Without permission, Cas pressed his index and middle finger against Dean’s forehead and Dean could feel the pain drain away, relief pouring in as Cas healed him, “We need you at full strength if we want to get out of this.”
“Oh,” Sam spoke with satisfaction, nodding his head.
“Well, I don’t know what kind of information yet, that’s what I’m going to find out, so that’s why I didn’t tell you,” Sam shrugged, getting out of the car.
“Nah, he’s really in to whatever it is he’s watching. I peeked in on him and some chick was getting her head torn off and he was completely unfazed by it.”
“We will deal with them after the infected ones,” Sam suggested, “They’re murderous but they can’t spread their disease like the others.”
“Thanks for always being here for me,” Dean mumbled.
“I’m glad you do, Dean,” Sam replied honestly.
“Okay,” Cas agreed, taking his stuff off of the table. The two left the house, which had been located only a few miles away from the street they had been abducted at. By now, the town was eerily quiet and calm in the night. Fresh bodies laid here and there, some infected and others not. It was apocalyptic, but Dean and Cas made their way through it and to the office where Sam was held.
“But, how was that possible? The Empty can’t just be summoned, and why would it listen to Cas? I-I mean, The Empty hated Cas, right? For being awake, or whatever?”
“Why are you here?” Cas questioned.
“You don’t understand what’s going on here”—
“I will leave then,” Cas said softly, turning his heel.
"I thought that was because you were cut off form heaven?" Dean pointed out. Cas shook his head.
“It’s Eileen,” Sam said in disbelief, a smile growing on his face. “S-she’s alive.”
“Yes we can,” an older woman from the crowd chimed in. The three turned—they were completely unaware that over half of the citizens they had saved were listening. “If we tell them—all of us, they’ll have to listen.”
“You know your use, Metatron,” Cas interjected aggressively. Dean stared at the angel next to him, unaccustomed to seeing such behavior. “The demon tablet—you stole it.”
“Dean,” Cas spoke, wrapping an arm over the man’s back, sitting next to him on the soggy ground.
“What?”
“I know, but you and Sam don’t. You would do anything for each other, and I admire that. That kind of devotion is something the other angels are incapable of feeling, because they’ve never seen it or been part of it. I feel like when I am here with you, I am with my family. Things have been rough, Dean, but never once have I felt like an orphan around you and your brother. With the other angels…there’s just emptiness. They don’t truly care about me. They would kill me if it meant they would gain something.”
“I’m fine—Amara, we talked. Did she get away?” Cas questioned, his eyes darting around to search for her.
“Well, I feel like you are a good person. A righteous man with a good heart—I feel like you have your best intentions, and you are always a little angry but you have every right to be”—
“You’ll be easy to cover up,” Doctor Henry confirmed, “Genocide everywhere, you’ll just fit in.”
“What do you mean?” Cas asked softly, “Dean, we are way stronger than these people, we can get out of this mess.”
“Don’t apologize, Cas,” Dean interrupted, sitting the drink he had made down on the table in front of him, leaning over it with his fingers locked together, his eyes fixated on the man in front of him. “You have nothing to apologize for.”
“Are you sure, Dean?” Cas questioned and Dean nodded.
“I think the town is clear,” Dean informed him.
“Please, the angels hate him because he likes you,” Metatron declared with sarcasm.
“Okay,” Cas agreed with a slight nod. The two stood for a few moments, Dean staring up at the angel as he lifted himself off the table. Dean opened his arms and the angel fell into them in a small embrace. Dean held on for several seconds, clutching the back of Cas’s trench coat as Cas rested on Dean’s shoulder. Cas closed his eyes, wrapping his arms around the man, breathing him in as he tried to shake the pain away. Dean could feel Cas’s small trembles—small signs of a broken soldier, and Dean’s comforting smile faded, but he forced it back onto his lips when Cas pulled away. Dean wanted to stay hopeful for the angel.
“O...kay. And what’s the problem?” How could Cas not get it? How could he not see what a betrayal this was?
And it was always
,” Dean’s cheeks were starting to burn with embarrassment. He was being overdramatic and
“Dean? Is everything alright?”
“I heard you talking to Meg.” Cas blinked at him from his spot on the bed.
“I think I love you too.” Dean let out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding and smiled what he hoped to be a charming smile back before tackling Cas onto his bed.
“I want to try something,” Cas spoke in a hushed tone. He wet his lips before bringing his eyes back up to Dean’s. “Tell me if this isn’t okay.”
“You told her to
Dean had stood still for a few minutes after Cas had disappeared into his own room, trying to understand what about that interaction was tripping him up.
“That’s not the point, Cas.”
What the fuck? Cas only says that to Dean. Why would
“Then what is the point?” Cas finally caught Dean’s eye. For a moment, Dean’s brain was stuck on
“I just wanted to tell you to have a good night.” Dean gave him a small smile, heading for his bedroom door.
need to sleep well? She would probably still sleep perfectly fine without Cas saying anything. Without thinking, Dean stormed into Cas’s room, hurting for reasons he couldn’t quite place. “The fuck, Cas?”
than anything Dean would say, but Cas is an affectionate guy. Dean’s overthinking this. There’s nothing weird about wishing your best friend a nice rest. But then it seemed to become a habit. Every night without fail:
to Dean. When Sam crashed on their couch it was “Have a good night, Sam”. If Cas got off the phone with Charlie or Gabriel it was “Night”. And Dean was definitely NOT smug about it at all. Really! It just felt good to be told to sleep well and know that Cas meant, sincerely, for him to have a good night’s rest. So of course, when Dean overheard Cas on the phone with Meg one night and happened to hear him end the conversation with “sleep well”, it kind of felt like a slap in the face.
Dean hadn't meant to cry. He'd sworn that he wouldn't and yet here he was. It was ugly and messy and it was all because of this beautiful, eloquent bastard standing before him.
The proud smile when they dropped Jack off to college had felt so real that Dean had cried when he'd woken up that night, yearning for a life he'd never have.
Human life suited Castiel. He was relaxed, more at ease. He ate, slept and even grumbled about the weather just like a normal human being. Although he was still that cute, dorky angel that Dean had fallen in love with, Castiel became more self assured and confident. It was sexy in a way that left Dean feeling hot under his collar almost every damn time.
"Promise not to tell Charlie?" He had enough blackmail material against his baby brother to shut him up, but Charlie on the other hand? That girl was terrifying.
"Where's Cas?" He asked as he handed Jack a bowl and the other to Sam.
They were going to get through this.
Dean reached his room and paused at the door before he made a split second decision. He walked by his room and stopped at Jack's door.
Shifting, he blindly reached around for his gorgeous boyfriend and frowned when his hand hit the cool empty bed.
It was slow and tentative. Castiel's lips were warm and moist against his own. Castiel made a soft noise of surprise and then all but melded into him, fingers weaving through Dean's short hair and angling their heads better.
"Thank you." Dean had made that
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yeah yeah. You'll always be the reigning champion of the staring contest. Besides, you can't blame me for admiring the view," he teased, entangling his fingers into Castiel's untameable hair. "These are new," he said, lightly stroking the silver streaks."
She looked a little embarrassed as she was handed her cocktail. “Right. Of course.”
“Sorry,” Cas said as the tilt finally softened and he was able to move away.
Dean felt desperation sinking in. “Ship leaves tomorrow, man.”
“Huh?” asked Dean blearily. He’d been preoccupied with studying Cas’ stubbled jawline from behind. “Oh, jeez.”
Dean laughed. “Sure.”
“Last night when Brian and I watched the first game, it was an excursion when we stop in Nassau,” Jeff said. “Swimming with dolphins or something. But it might be different today. We figure we have a shot at getting pretty far, but the more the merrier, right?”
Cas rolled his eyes as they stood. “I don’t think that will be necessary.”
Cas eyed the food between them, dubious. “There’s no way you can consume all that.”
Dean turned the water off, running his fingers through his hair and flinging off the excess water. From the next stall, he could smell Sam’s flowery shampoo wafting through the steam.
He swayed a bit in his seat, surprised when he nearly bumped skulls with Cas; they’d inched steadily closer for the last hour, but his depth perception was a little off at the moment.
too much to drink.
“We wasted so much time,” Dean sighed. “We’re
After shifting positions for what felt like the hundredth time, Dean looked at the clock, which gave his eyes a break from the ceiling.
“Uh...
“Maybe it took the end of the world...again,” Dean said, “for me to finally take my head out of my ass. I want this. Have wanted this, for...too long. So please, just…”
They stared at each other, Dean seeing his own uncertainty reflected in Cas’ face. It was hard to deny now that something had fundamentally changed in the makeup of their relationship. The question was whether that something was a new layer of growth, like the rings on a tree, or some kind of decay—peeling, chipped, once-lovely wallpaper, revealing the ugliness beneath.
to act like they were in love all the time. He doubted the cruise employees would throw them overboard if they found out Dean and Cas weren’t actually a couple. But a part of Dean was enjoying having an excuse to touch him, look at him like this with a layer of protection removed. He could feel his nerve endings alight, prickling with possibility.
“I’m- I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas said haltingly. “I didn’t mean- I didn’t know you’d be in here.”
His words couldn’t mean what they sounded like. “You care about who I sleep with?”
“Oh. Well, there’s a Christmas Eve feast. I plan on stuffing my face until I can’t move.”
Sam looked up from stirring the large pot, laughing at the towel Dean had wrapped around his head. “It’s almost ready. Did you have a good shower?”
He leaned in, taking Cas’ bottom lip tenderly between his own. Cas pushed into him, moving them back until Dean felt his bed hit the back of his knees. He could tell Cas tried to gracefully bend them onto the bed together, but Dean just fell back and pulled Cas down with him. Their kissing intensified, stubble scraping each other’s cheeks as Dean pulled down his sweatpants. Cas ground into him, uncertainly at first, but more forceful once Dean let out a needful whimper. The smooth material of Cas’ pants glid over the growing presence in Dean’s boxers. He reached up to undo Cas’ belt, pulling it out in one motion and tossing it aside a moment before Cas moved his mouth to Dean’s throat, grazing his teeth and tongue along his jawline. A guttural groan came out of Dean before he could stop himself.
He could see Castiel take a deep breath and pause, undoubtedly another human idiosyncrasy he’d picked up, holding his eyes closed for a beat longer than a blink.
That one was a gimme. The Impala.
He spun back around, his accidental foray into voyeurism doing nothing to help the tension he was already feeling.
“What?” he croaked.
“I had a nightmare,” Castiel sighed. “About...about the wendigo. I couldn’t find you, and I just...I needed to make sure you were safe. But then you woke up, and told me to stay, so I did.”
Cas glanced at the pillow next to Dean. “Can I…?”
Cas shook his head, but Kira Leigh stood from her seat. “Can I join you?”
Kira Leigh clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Beginner’s luck!”
Cas leaned in close, with a low voice that hadn’t been used between them in years. “You may forget, Dean, but I’ve seen you at your best and at your worst. I remade you from atoms. Those scars on your heart, in your head—those aren’t you.”
Dean gaped at her. “You
The small crowd of couples on stage mumbled and nodded in general agreement.
Cas stroked him in earnest, soothing his concern with “It’s okay, I’ve got you," as if he had heard Dean's thoughts. Maybe he had.
“No terms and conditions?”
“I’m not going to fall for your tactics,” Cas objected, standing his ground.
It had been a long hunt, but Sam was always researching to find any information he could in regards to Metatron, Amara, or The Darkness. He kept tabs, and when he wasn’t looking through news stories on the Internet that pertained to supernatural events, he was researching, making phone calls, and taking all the notes he could about the bigger forces that he had unleashed upon the world with his brother and Castiel. He was ready to take responsibility, and with his newfound knowledge of holy oil as a cure for whatever the darkness did to humanity, he was eager to clean up his mess.
“Humor me, please,” Dean pleaded more than he had anticipated, but he was really curious to know now that not only Sam had brought it up but Metatron as well.
“I’m glad, Dean,” Castiel said with a genuine smile, a spark in his blue eyes, “And...maybe your father was wrong. Dean, my greatest strength is my ability to /feel/, when I began to feel things, human things...it made me stronger, it made me care about people. It made me see things for what they were.”
“Something did happen with me and Cas.”
Castiel shook his head, unsure of where Dean was going with this. Dean wet his lips, pondering his words before he spoke them.
“When did you know?” Dean asked.
“What? Again?” Dean questioned.
“What now?” Sam asked him earlier as the trio entered the kitchen. They had been silent for hours, watching the body of their mother turn to embers in the pyre. Castiel’s eyes never left Dean, and Dean knew that he had been looking at him the entire time to make sure he was okay. Truthfully, Dean was far from okay. They were all far from okay.
“Not to me, Dean, I have no soul for her to swallow,” Cas reminded him. It took Dean several moments before he obeyed his feathered friend, but he knew it would be best. Cas was stronger than him, and he was right— despite how righteous and kind Cas was, he still technically lacked a soul. She was no threat to him. Dean nodded and continued his pursuit, leaving Cas to stare at Amara from a distance, Amara watching as Dean darted away.
“It’s not,” Dean said with a sigh, “It was awful, Sam. That dreadful feeling, knowing that she was going to kill Cas, that I was going to watch him go down bloody, knowing she’d kill me after him. It was awful. Then Cas started saying some things to me... about me. About how he felt.”
Silence. The pair drank, not really looking at each other, deep in their own thoughts.
“I guess I have,” Cas concluded honestly, “But not until recently have I had a real reason to fight for it. Old me was more sympathetic, now I’m…I can empathize. I’ve seen struggling up close, and I’ve struggled myself. I guess what the other angels don’t realize is once you get close to someone—to humanity—and really care for them, it’s hard not to see things differently, its hard not to want to help them, to not choose them over any of our corrupt siblings.”
“Yeah, let’s go,” Dean nodded at Cas softly and the trio headed out the door once again.
Cas nodded slowly, unsure of himself. He placed his hand against the door and pushed, closing his eyes to focus on the task in front of him. Dean was supportive, and Cas didn’t want to let him down. It was difficult, but with enough focus and force, the door busted open.
“Cas, when you died”-
The process of trapping and curing the infected people was tedious and difficult, but they were naturally lured to the purity of the brothers and the angel. Their only desire was to infect the three but they failed every time. They had set up a system where Sam barricaded an empty office building where the cured people would go after being escorted by Dean and Castiel and would stay until everyone was cured or dead. Several times infected people had attempted to break through the barricade, but Sam had back up holy oil to cure those people.
“I agree with Sam,” Cas chimed in, sitting across from the youngest brother, still wrapped in his blanket. “Any hunch is worth checking out if it comes to Metatron.”
“Of course,” Cas answered.
“Dean, I know,” Cas said, “I know. He killed someone we cared about, but we care about him, too. It’s confusing, it’s heartbreaking, and it is impossible to understand what we are feeling or even how to feel. We need time to figure it out. Finding Jack will take time, and until then...we figure it out. We come up with a plan and hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.”
“Seems like a hard job,” Dean said with a sigh.
“What? How?” Dean questioned.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean spoke with concern, swiftly making his way to the bed. He tapped the angel softly and his eyes fluttered open. Cas groaned.
“I want to know what your insides look like,” the man spoke plainly, “I’ve always wondered, and here two good healthy men are—what a joy it would be to find out!”
“I want you to know that this is your home. You are always welcomed here, or any of the crap hotel rooms Sam and I may be forced to stay in. We are your family, Sam and I, always. You can tell me anything, and we will work things out. I want to know about your problems, I want to help, and I want to listen, that is what families do. You can have your own room and everything.”
“I don’t know about this, Dean,” Cas shook his head.
“Thank you,” he whispered before picking up his daughter, examining her clean foot and returning to his position in the crowd of people. Each person Cas healed made him weaker, but he loved the look of appreciation and awe on each persons face as he healed them. Sam and Dean watched—all the hugs, the smiles, and the appreciation for the angel made them happy. Cas was elated. He fell in love with humanity even more after that day, and how simple kind gestures unified them—how strangers could come together in a time of crisis and help each other out. The angels never rallied like this. The angels never showed love for each other, let alone strangers.
“Okay?”
“Hey, wake up, we are here! Where do we go now?” Dean spoke, shaking the man. Sam shot up, his eyes foggy from sleep. He ran his fingers through his hair and pulled out his phone from his pocket while yawning.
“That must have been dreary,” Dean spoke.
“Cas, I don’t understand you. Angel warrior of heaven who has lived since the beginning of time so caught up on me. What makes me so special?” Dean questioned harshly. Cas grew quiet, offended by Dean’s aggression. Dean sensed the distaste of his words. He attempted to rephrase them in his head. He softened his voice and posture and licked his lips, preparing his words carefully.
“You set me free,” she spoke honestly, her voice emotionless and pure. “Yes, the mark on Dean was the key to what locked me away, but you…you proceeded with the spell.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything, but secrets tear this family apart.”
When Dean awoke it was already nightfall. His pockets had been picked and his plaid shirt-coat combination had been taken off of him. Any weapons he was carrying had been taken away and Castiel lay next to him wherever they were, still unconscious. Dean groaned and sat up, a little bulb hanging from the ceiling at the far end of the room was their only light source. He wasn’t bound to anything, and from the dampness of the room, Dean guessed they were in a basement or cellar of sorts. There was a door next to a staircase which Dean hoped was an exit and automatically went to it— jiggling the handle and wishing he had something to pick the lock with, but his jacket had been taken from him, which is where he carried paper clips and other odd items he could pick a lock with.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked finally.
“Hey, is everything okay?” Sam questioned, sensing tension.
“We figure out a way to get out of this place, and we finish saving this town,” Dean suggested and Cas nodded.
“Of course.”
“Worse than bad, Sammy,” Dean admitted, shaking his head with shame as he recollected the events that had happened.
Dean took a step back, unsure of what he was trying to accomplish. He removed his hand from its soft position over Castiel’s and his eyes stared at the angel in front of him, curious with questions seeking answers.
“Dean…”
“Dean!” Cas yelled, grabbing his companion from his trance with a single touch on his shoulder. Dean’s eyes instantly darted back to Castiel, whatever enchantment that had been there was broken the moment he looked into Cas’s eyes.
“Y-yeah!” Sam answered with a chuckle, “I-I can’t believe it. She says she’s okay, she’s using her neighbor’s phone because I have hers. She’s probably so confused, I have so much I need to tell her.”
Sam - what happened? Lost my phone, you never came, is everything okay? - Eileen
“I don’t know…” Dean replied dismally. The conversation halted, the room growing quiet.
Sam had turned away from his feuding brother and the angel. He sensed awkward unresolved tension, knowing they probably had things they needed to talk about, that and the throbbing in his head indicated to him that another vision was coming on. He had excused his belief that his brother and friend needed privacy and his sudden sickness with the typical ‘doing research’ and walked away, leaving the angel glaring at the eldest Winchester in the war room.
“What?” Dean rebutted defensively, not because he didn’t hear what his brother said but because he wanted a justification for it.
“Dean,” Cas spoke, gesturing to a table in the kitchen that conveniently contained their belongingness scattered out along with other objects that didn’t belong to them—blood splattered pictures, cell phones, little personal belongings. Dean grabbed his shirt and put it on under his jacket, stuffing his pockets full of the knives he carried and the gun. Cas stood by, his eyes searching the place. They finally landed on the floor a few yards away from them.
Sam had received an email from another hunter named Amber. Sam had emailed everyone he knew pertaining to information on Amara, The Darkness, or Metatron. Amber had replied and informed Sam that they had spotted Metatron, or at least someone who looked like him, at the town where she was working a case. It was a long drive, and Sam barely knew the woman, but the two had met at one point or another during one of his separations from his brother and had a beer together, discussing hunting after Sam had noticed her anti-possession tattoo on her wrist. Sam trusted her.
“Yeah, Dean—he saw her. That man saw Amara. He had been to the town days before the article was released and told me he saw a young woman with a mark on her chest. She’s grown a lot but it has to be her.”
“How are we going to explain this to the police?” Dean questioned.
“I know, and I hope to god he knows me enough to know that what I did to him was something I would never normally do to him, ever, under any circumstance, period,” Dean declared harshly, his voice full of emotion. He paused to settle down.
“I didn’t know angels were capable of feeling this way either, Dean. I have been around for an extraordinarily long time, and I didn’t know. I didn’t know I could feel this way, until I met you.” Castiel explained, shaking his head, “What I do know, is I have felt friendship before, and I have felt brotherhood and fatherhood, but how I feel about you as opposed to Sam, or Eileen, or Jack...it is just different, Dean. It...it makes me scared, in ways I have never feared before. It makes my chest hurt, and palpitate, and makes me nervous.”
“Thank you, Cas,” Dean spoke, “For everything you’ve ever done for us, and for everything you do.”
“Cas was there, Sam. He made it just in time for me to shoot that kid. He tried talking to me, told me how far off the deep end I had gone. I was so blinded by the mark that I didn’t believe him. I thought what I had done was right and that I was no different for doing it, but he was right.”
“Dammit,” Dean whispered, staring upwards into the darkness. He heard groaning and turned to see Cas leaning up from his resting position on the ground. They had taken his trench coat and everything in his pockets as well. His eyes were still closed and he was shaky. Two blows to his head in one day was enough to slow anyone down—angel or not. Dean ran to him.
“Are you sure?” Dean questioned and Cas nodded.
“Maybe not,” Dean agreed halfheartedly, “But honestly, Cas, you kissing me is not the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. How am I supposed to react? Am I supposed to hate you now? Am I supposed to freak out? I’d be lying if I told you that out of all of the surprise kisses I’ve ever received, that one wasn’t the most shocking, but it doesn’t mean it was unwelcomed.”
“Look,” the man with glasses spoke, “We don’t know what happened here, but I know the look in my son’s eye when he came after me before I was infected—he wasn’t himself. I don’t know if he will get better, but I don’t want him to hurt anyone. This town has suffered enough.”
“Not Metatron, either,” Dean interrupted.
“What now?” Castiel asked.
“Thank you for telling me,” Dean spoke, “Honestly…I kind of have been feeling the same way.”
“Stop,” Cas muttered, “I’m not falling for what you have to say.”
Dean laughed and then nodded, removing his hand from Castiel’s shoulder.
“Will this hurt?” she questioned innocently.
“Just tell me, Cas,” Dean furthered, reminding Castiel of his last words to him before he died, that there was happiness in just being, in just saying it. Castiel took a deep breath.
“Now, can we settle this accordingly”—
“But...I...I thought”--
“You’re here!” one little redheaded girl declared upon seeing them, a smile on her face, tugging on her father’s hand.
"It would make sense," Cas whispered, "I mean, how else could I have become a human when Metatron took my grace? Apparently a small part of my grace remained in my body, even after Metatron took it, and in an effort to keep me alive it shifted into becoming a human soul. After I regained my grace...I guess the soul is still there. It would explain why I can't fly and get headaches, and why I share characteristics of both."
