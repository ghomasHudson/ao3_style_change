“Jewelry belongs to you, Tony.  It is one of the few items of any value that Omegas can legally own.  It’s portable, easily hidden.  You can trade it or pawn it,” Jarvis observed mildly, like he was discussing the weather, while Tony stared at him.  “Do you really think the love of sparkly stones shared by so many Omegas grew solely from shallowness and vanity?  Jewelry is independence.  A way out, Tony.  Not all Omegas are as fortunate as you are in their mate.”
They'd been hovering, Rhodey and Pepper, Tony thought, with a warm burst of gratefulness. James Rhodes was the kind of friend who sees you at the bottom of the pit and not only jumps in with you, but the rare kind who will stay there with you until you can get yourself out. And Pep, bless her, she wanted Tony to be happy so badly she'd close her mouth and let him settle if she thought it would get the job done. Two kinds of friends, Tony realized as he stepped inside the vestibule of Steve's building. One to help you bury the body, one to make sure you're handling everything okay, he thought wryly, picturing Pepper gamely holding a shovel and looking at her watch while one perfect heel tapped a pattern into grave dirt.
“Bet that’s…neat,” Steve said, then sucked in a breath and waited for the rebuke that was sure to follow the use of neat.
“True, but, if it’s any consolation, he does that with all of us. I thought it was a most impressive story, don’t be sour with us, honey-bear,” Tony replied, lips quirking into a smile as he twisted around in his saddle.  “Did I tell you about the time I saved the entire city?  Well, mostly me.  I’m not saying others were not a help.  Eventually, I mean. When they were finished yelling at me for being there, so I’d say they get…let’s say twelve percent of the credit for saving the city.”
The rest of the afternoon dragged on, though Steve spent part of his time running through a few training exercises malleable enough to be done indoors.  It wasn’t much, but the familiar rhythm of movements worked his muscles to a stinging soreness by the time he was done.  Cam watched in fascination for a while, then grew bored with watching Steve lift things and wandered out to the balcony with a handful of dried fruits and nuts.
“He’s not too young to be breaking into the Headmaster’s office and messing around with the shiny, new toy in there,” Howard huffed out.  “Agents. At my door, Peg.  Federal agents. Six AM. The last thing we need right now is a scandal, and my own son can’t manage to keep his nose clean for a few God-damned months!  I think a little alone time is the least of his worries,” Howard said with a snort, taking another drink.
“With the taking care of me.  With the not shooting Clint.  With the not panicking and ordering solid rocket boosters,” Steve finished for him.  Oh yeah, that.  Damn, he really had done well, he thought proudly.  “You didn’t order solid rocket boosters, did you?”
“It was an accident,” Tony blurted out.
“Who bought a company? Who got fired?” Barnes called out from the sofa where he was propped up, watching TV and seemingly working his way through the room service menu by the looks of it.  His prosthetic arm, the plastic sort of yellowing where it was meant to be a flesh tone, sat next to him.  He’d formed the hand into a one-fingered salute, as if he just wanted that option at the ready.
They all dropped clumps of dirt onto the body where it lay in the hole wrapped in a sheet. Steve’s mom said a prayer, then paid the gravedigger and never looked back. She worried they would have to sell the farm to pay off his father’s debts, but something happened with that--Steve wasn’t sure what--and they stayed, and, eventually, were even able to buy a new cow who liked to eat berries from Steve hands and some goats who, as far as Steve could tell,  liked to chew the fence and chase Steve and Bucky across the yard every chance they got.
good.  Familiar.  Why? It was violence, same as always. Wasn’t it?
The bedsheets were next.  They went into a ball with his suit.  He’d have to do the laundry himself.  Or burn them. Whatever.   He pulled a pair of boxers and a t-shirt out of the dresser drawer and shoved them on, then crawled back into the bed and curled up on his side, staring at the wall between him and Steve.  He let out a low hiss of breath and rubbed at his eyes.  At least Steve couldn’t have heard him.
He wasn’t sure if it was comforting that human greed remained a constant this past seventy years or not.
“Speaking of, what about what General Rhodes was saying?” Steve asked, his brow furrowing. “Is this place truly so dangerous?”
“I know, Tony.  It’s okay.  And also, I’d like to see you try, so there’s that,” Bruce responded with a small smile as he hitched his pants around his waist as best he could.  “I’m an Alpha.  When Betty and I—well.  You heard about Harlem, I take it? I get it. Don’t worry.”
I’m more, Tony thought dazedly.  To him, I’m more.  Maybe that was what love was. Seeing someone as they were, flaws and faults and failings, and still seeing them as more of everything.  Use your special viewing, he thought.
“Do you think he truly means to take you to visit the Free States one day?” Cam asked, sounding merely curious. The Free States, though, Steve noted. Not your home, no, Cam was too careful for that. “I think he will,” Cam continued. “Once he has an heir or two, most likely. Then he will be able to travel more freely. You will see. And then you shall truly be able to see the Dark Sea, and be glad to cross it as befits your station. And you would see your friends. You would like that. They will rejoice to see you, too, I think. Then they will know that the King is a good and kind king, and that you are happy here with us. This will give them much comfort, I think.”
“Who’s panicking?  I’m not panicking.  This is me, definitely not panicking.  Just pointing out that our team leader is making snot bubbles at the moment, but, nope, not panicking,” Tony replied. Stoically, he thought.   Definitely, almost stoically.  Very close.  Four out of five Avengers would go with stoically.
“Really?  Well, that’s…interesting,” she replied.
Steve drew back in surprise, hearing his own turn of phrase tossed back to him.  He’d said that to Iron Man, not two weeks ago, after they touched down on the roof of the Tower after a night flight over the city, ostensibly to scan for signs of Chitauri-based tech, but mostly because Iron Man knew how much Steve loved to fly with him.  He’d told Iron Man about Nat’s attempts to set up him with someone from SHIELD, and Iron Man had suggested maybe that was a good idea, Steve remembered with a pang.  Hard to find someone with shared life experiences, Steve had objected, though Iron Man hadn’t said anything further and Steve had let the matter drop.
Five weeks later and everything was horrible. Okay, not horrible.  Not at all, really.  It was great.  Fantastic.  Absolutely everything he could possibly want, from dinners to movies to baseball games and Jesus Christ, it was horrible.  Tony was going to be the death of him if he didn’t do something other than spend long stretches of time kissing Steve deeply, running hands up and down Steve’s body, and then pressing a chaste kiss to Steve’s lips and wishing him a good night.
“Well…in my defense…I do really like paprika,” Tony grinned.  At Pepper’s raised eyebrow, Tony relented.  “Fine, fine.  I’ll take a look.  Leave it be, okay?”
“You make it sound like anyone could be in that suit and do the same thing.  Iron Man’s not just a pilot.  He’s a hero,” Steve said stiffly, stabbing his fork into his guilt-free fish.  “He saved New York.  Him,” Steve continued, jabbing at the air with his fish-laden fork.  “I watched him fly that missile into a wormhole, knowing it was—he had to know it was a one-way trip, but he did it. He did it.  Iron Man.  All the rest of them could do was watch from the ground. He’s one of the bravest people I’ve ever kn—seen,” he finished, feeling his jaw tighten around the words as if he could chew them and spit them out.
“I told you after what happened last time that next time you were riding with me.  Did you think I jested?” Rhodes demanded, eyeing Tony, who just smiled a small, knowing smile and looked away.  Steve had heard the story of the Ten Rings’ attack on the carriages by now, of course, though he suspected Tony spared him some of the details in the retelling.  He wondered now if leaving it to his own mind to recreate was the lesser burden, and thought again about Tony’s tentative attempts to ask him about Brookland.  About other things.  Steve sighed and shifted again in his saddle, earning a sharp, worried glance from Tony, which he pretended not to notice.
“Really?” Steve questioned with a tone of surprise.
“Cowards,” Steve said after a moment, making Tony grunt out a laugh.  “So.”
The elevator doors opened almost immediately, since the car was there waiting, and Steve stepped inside, giving Tony a quick, hard look.
“Hey, James,” Steve said as he ducked his head and climbed in.
“Eh, they’ll probably like you better than me.  Pepper will talk your ear off about the newest Mondrian or whatever she’s bought.  They’re..well, they’re friends.  I’d just…like them to meet you,” Tony replied.
was his place, right here, on the cusp of battle.  This was what he was meant to do.  For so long, that part of him had been shackled and constrained, but here was Tony, asking him to set it free.  All the anger, all the hate, all the fear, he could feel it boiling inside him, threatening to spill over.  His hands curled into fists at his sides.  In his ears, he could hear the blood pounding in his veins.  He swallowed. Tasted blood.  He wasn’t sure if it was real or in his head, but it was good.  Dark, coppery and familiar, that taste.  He could almost feel his body quickening with it, muscles tensing, heartbeat slowing, head clearing to that eerie sense of calm, still focus.
“Matt and Foggy are friends.  Be nice.  Besides, I think you owe Matt one,” Barnes reminded him.  “Too bad Clint and the fam couldn’t come.  Laura’s great.  Kids are the best.  Clint…doesn’t suck.”
Steve gave up and looked out the window as the world grew smaller below them. When they reached the site for the new arc reactor plant, which would provide clean energy to a good third of California when completed, Tony lapsed into excited chatter about where this or that part was going to go, how the delivery system worked and all kinds of other technical jargon that Steve let jus wash over him, enjoying the sound of Tony’s voice punctuated with enthusiasm and the spark in his eyes as he talked non-stop.  He knew how important this was to Tony.  A way to prove that Stark Industries could be more than something that just contributed destruction and death to the world. He just hoped the Board would be able to see it that way, too.
Through the door, he could hear laughter, loud and rich and deep, the kind that sounded less like amusement and more like power, the way his father laughed on the rare occasions that he did.  The massive oak door started to swing open, and Tony scrambled to his feet, pressing his back against the wall.  Tony made himself stand up straight, shoulders back, so he didn’t slouch, pulling himself up as tall as he could, which, fine, wasn’t much, but he wasn’t going to let them see him cower, even as his stomach flip-flopped and his chest tightened like someone was squeezing a vice around him.
“Buck,” Steve warned.
“Yeah,” Tony replied listlessly, picking at a thread on the bottom of his shirt.  He thought about Steve’s shirt, the one with the patch on it, tucked in Tony’s drawer.  My Alpha sews, Mom. Also, he doesn’t want me, but no need to call the doctor or look at that stupid catalogue, I behaved myself.  Happy Birthday to me.
He opened the refrigerator and peered at the contents with a frown.  Nothing really screamed baby food.  Probably not Natahsa’s borscht or those mushrooms Bruce had wrapped up in cheesecloth, he thought with a grimace.  Tony rummaged around a bit, finally pulling out a container of leftover lasagna.
“He is miserable.  That is what he is.  He should be home. Not at that…place,” Ana insisted, then sat back against the sofa and crossed his arms.
. It was always Tony.
Captain Rogers, or who he assumed was Rogers, anyway, was standing in front of one of the tall windows wearing his dress uniform and facing Tony, hands behind his back, which had the effect of making him look even broader in the shoulder than he was.  And that was seriously saying something.  Bit like saying the Rockies have a few good mountains.
“You couldn’t have waited until after dinner?” Bruce asked, forehead crinkling in a frown as he blew gently on the small flame and stacked some of the rocks Thor provided in a ring around the fire.
Tony turned and slid his arms up around Steve’s neck, blowing at the tassel out of the corner of his mouth when it swayed in front of his face.  Steve chuckled and reached up to move it so that it hung off the back of the cap, out of the way.  Tony waited patiently, eyes tracking the movement, trying to hold in a grin.
The clock on the mantle chimed dully to tell him that it was just after one, though he knew that already. Tony would probably be in his garage until dinner. He wasn’t coming out to have lunch with Steve and tell him how much he liked soaps and socks, that was for sure. Didn’t matter.  Steve was good at waiting.  There was lots of waiting in the Army, more than most people would think, to be honest, and he was good at it. People thought it was the serum, probably, but it was really more due to years of being stuck in a bed with nothing to do but think.
“Time to call in reinforcements, then, I guess,” Rhodey announced, pulling Tony from his reverie.
them. They needed a soldier, but they didn’t want him to need a war.  Not like this.  So, they offered him something else to need and like a drowning man, he couldn’t help but reach for that pocket of air, even if it gave him just one more breath.  Like a diver, Steve thought, and felt his throat click dryly as he tried to swallow back the words.
“Maybe,” Tony said.  “I mean, I don’t personally know the code.  Obie does, though, I somehow doubt you want to ask him.  But…I could maybe crack it for you. If it was worth my while, let’s say.”
“Probably want crickets,” Tony replied with a sly, challenging smile, then huffed out a laugh, a wide, full smile blossoming across his face.
“I did not.  I know that, because you were breathing fire at the time,” Tony said, looking up at her with a doleful expression, “and I felt very, very guilty about that.  And also, not going to lie, timing-wise, that seemed not to be the best—”
“Nothing.  Forget it, okay?  It’s done.  Over. Can we just…can we let it go?” Tony pleaded.
“That so?” Stane asked, arching his brows.  He took another drink of his Scotch. “Me, too,” he grinned, predatory and leering, all teeth and sweat.
This was the King’s beach, or the Strand, as the locals called it.  Tony claimed this was a mottled version of Stark’s sand, which was how it was originally claimed when his ancestors arrived and decided to build the first fortress on the cliff above. Whatever the origin, there was no doubt why kings would claim the Strand as their own.  Buttressed by steep, red cliffs to the back and a swath of rocks larger than most homes forming a natural berm to the front, the lagoon was nearly inaccessible and the waters calm.
want,” he added, looking back down at Steve, a strange play of emotions crossing his face so fast that Steve only got a vague sense that Tony meant what he was saying, meant it to mean something to Steve.   “I hope what I can give you will be enough,” he said, his eyes turning downcast and expression going resolute. “It will be as it is, either way, I suppose.”
“You smell good,” Steve mumbled as he nibbled the line of Tony’s jaw.
“Wow.  Well, I haven’t had occasion to try either, but I’m going with the outlook thing,” Steve shrugged.
“There is no reason we can’t take a regular flight just like everyone else, Tony.  We can charter a boat to the island once we get there,” Steve replied, clearly not understanding about the pole, thank God.  He suspected Steve would not approve.
“You said there was nothing wrong with wanting to wait for--for someone who--I thought you were okay with…” Steve stammered, heat flooding the back of his neck and up his cheeks.
“I kind of gathered that,” Tony said.  The ambulance came to a halt in front of the house. Jarvis opened the front door, gave Tony a quick look, then proceeded towards the ambulance.  Had everything really happened in the space of the eight minutes it took for the medics to get here?  It seemed impossible that so much could change in so little time. No one seemed to know, which was weird, though Tony couldn’t say why.  It just seemed like the world should be different because…the world was different now.
Besides, Anto didn’t think it would have ever even occurred to anyone else to keep the cave’s existence a secret.  He didn’t think any of the rest of the would even be able to comprehend a secret. There were things they did not know, because they lacked the Memories for those things, but these weren’t secrets.  Not the way the cave was.
Tony was quiet for what felt like the longest few seconds of Steve’s life.  “We could st--”
Tony tucked his spent cock back into his pants and walked over to the dais, taking each step at a time, until he slowly turned and sat down, eyes on Steve.
“I—“ Tony began, looking up at Steve, before dropping his eyes again and swallowing thickly.  His heart froze in his chest, then bobbed up to his throat, before sinking down to his stomach like a lead weight.
“It’s just a contingency plan,” Tony promised hurriedly as they walked toward the bed.
He was the first man of the Others Anto had ever seen.
“Ooooh, talk dirty to me some more,” Kirk quipped while he smiled and started inching down Steve’s underwear.
Should be.
This chapter involves a world where Omegas have a rather sucky life and not a whole lot of power.  Arranged marriages for them are the norm.  However, there is no non-con between Steve and Tony, but please be mindful of yourselves, dear readers.
Tony stared at them all, eyes flicking around the room and briefly catching on the camera, which slowly lowered, as if Daniel hadn’t even realized he still had it in his hands.  On the screen, shoes and a khaki-covered pants leg filled the screen, while two fingers brushed in front of it, clearly trying to surreptitiously turn it off, with little success.  The film rocked to one side, as what Steve recognized as Tony’s jeans-clad leg rocketed past to shouts of his name following him.
And there was the threat, Steve thought, as Zola regarded him, all pretense of obsequiousness dropping from his face. Steve could feel his pack pulling tall and straight and his stomach swooped, because he knew that what Zola said was true, but he refused to let Zola see anything from him other than disdain.
Then Tony’s mouth was on his and all rational thought flew out of Steve’s mind as Tony’s tongue darted over his lips, licking and tasting before his hand moved to cup Steve’s jaw and lightly press down, opening his mouth.  As soon as he did, Tony’s tongue swept in, and he heard a moan that must have come from him, though he had no conscious thought of doing it, and somehow his arms were wrapping around Tony, pulling him even closer, as Tony’s tongue plunged deeper, warring with his own.  It was kissing only in the fact that it fell into that general category because this was nothing like Steve had ever experienced before, the way Tony’s tongue moved through his mouth, caressing and seeming to try to delve into every part of him, stealing Steve’s breath.  When Steve let slip an involuntary groan, it was enough to make Tony’s movements even wilder, his hands grasping and roaming all over Steve’s body, as if trying to map it out and commit it to memory.
Steve wasn’t sure what to make of the interest, but he understood performance.  He knew that people needed their stories almost as much as they needed food on the table and a roof over their heads. He understood what a symbol could mean to people.  He suspected that Tony did, too.  Not for the first time, Steve thought about how much Tony wanted Steve to like this place. To see the beauty in the land and its people, after all the ugliness.  The idea that Tony wanted his people to like Steve, to see him as something other than a mere concubine, that was new. Though it went a long way to explain the luxury of the carriage and the opulent robes Steve wore, Steve realized. Tony was showing his people Steve’s value, in perhaps the only way he could.
“Those other things you talked about…red dwarfs, gas giants…I looked up some stuff on the Internet—ah, space stuff,” Steve said, making Tony want to roll his eyes.  Space stuff.  Jesus.  Tyson—Degrasse, not Mike--would probably, nevertheless, gnaw Steve’s ear off for that kind of talk.  “I saw something once.  A, ah, I guess you’d call it an image.  From space.  Not like anything I’ve ever seen before, though,” Steve continued, his voice taking on an odd tone.  “Not stars.  Or not just stars.  Planets.  Other things.  Other places.  It—it was…” Steve stopped, sitting back in his seat, hands coming up to rest on the table in fists that kept clenching and unclenching.  “Do you know what an Einstein-Rosen bridge is?”
“Seven thousand, huh?  Fairly specific request.  You owe someone?” Tony asked carefully.
“No hospital,” Steve promised, though his words were directed at Rhodey, who gave him a questioning look, but nodded, since there wasn’t really anything to argue about, which would usually annoy Tony, but was currently rather convenient.  His Alpha said no hospital, so no hospital.
“I know that the last time you were so inclined, it was a bit confusing for you, and the lovely lady you woke up with, what was his name?” Tony asked, tapping his bottom lip with his finger, as if trying to recall.
Steve whirled around, eyes darting this way and that as he looked for the source of the voice--the voice, that voice, God, that
“They all volunteered to come, by the way,” Rhodes said as Steve’s gaze darted over familiar faces, realizing for the first time that they were not just along for Tony’s protection. Ketterson passed by with a large, half-wet stone in his hands and nodded to him.  Redwing soared overhead, swooping and diving amongst the gulls, while Sam marched up the hill, one rock in each hand.  Steve saw the Commandos, too, picking out Dugan’s bright nest of hair in the crowd.  It would have been faster to form a chain and pass the stones along, but no one suggested such a thing.  Natasha walked by with a bag filled with rocks slung over her shoulder, then Thor with an impossibly large stone, followed by Bruce and Clint, carrying a huge stone between them.   As if by silent agreement, he and Tony made their way down to the beach together and joined in the silent procession.
“I’ll explain in a minute,” the woman, Natasha, replied.  “Clint, how’s he look?”
“That all you could find?” Steve asked in a crisp, clipped tone without looking at Tony.
“For Tony?”  Steve echoed.  “You don’t know the first thing about Tony and certainly aren’t doing any of this for his sake.  This is about you and keeping whatever power it is you think you have.  But if you think you can do that at Tony’s expense, you have seriously miscalculated.”  He shrugged away from Stane, brushing past him to head for the door.  He’d heard enough.  He wanted to find Tony and…warn him?  He didn’t know exactly what he’d say, except somehow convince Tony that the person he grew up with as a father figure actually despised him.  Not much of a plan, but he’d take it.
They’d been so full of hope, then.  Or, he had.  He wasn’t sure about Bucky, or if Buck had just gone along with him on this desperate, cross-country jaunt for lack of anything else to do, or simply out of habit at this point.  He’d just…figured things would work out.  They’d get the appeal paperwork done with the VA.  Explain things to the nice man behind the desk.  People would listen.  It all seemed stupidly optimistic and naïve at this point, but it had taken months to realize that they’d passed as good as it was going to get a long time ago.
Only lies.
“Fine,” Steve said noncommittally.  He was looking down at his hands, sitting atop his thighs, fingers splayed like they were waiting for permission to move.  Tony’s grip on the wheel tightened, and next to him, he saw Steve’s posture stiffen out of the corner of his eye where the dim evening light and glow of the dash cast a grayish-blue pallor over his skin.  Sick when he was young, Tony recalled, trying to see it in his head, a toe-headed young Steve with fever-red cheeks and bright, watery eyes.
“I think you should wear something fancy tonight,” Cam mused as he brought a pile of fluffy towels in and set them down on the steps by the tub.   “So that he’ll know you missed him.”
“I told General Pickens not to put me up for a Medal because if you start calling any of what we did over there above and beyond the call, then I don’t know what the call is, anymore,” Steve said.  “We did our jobs. I don’t need a gold star for doing what’s right. If that makes you think I’ve got something to hide, then I think it says more about you than about me.”
“So, you’re saying, if we found something like that, we would eventually have to…take her out for a spin, so to speak,” Steve added.
“Ex—excuse me?”  Estes stammered. “Steve?  Who’s
Tony’s eyes narrowed at the screen, then he smiled softly, mouth twisting a bit.  He sucked in a breath, his insides going warm and liquid. He liked this Steve, who danced on rooftops and made bisexual spelling jokes and took Tony out to long-distance dinners.
When he finally came back to his skin, felt his body coalesce around himself again, he realized he was slumped back against the King’s chest, panting, while the King ran a hand up and down his back.  He was too wrung out to think of anything other than trying to breath, at first, though the haze slowly left him and he was faced with a dawning horror at himself.  This couldn’t be right.  Whatever this was, it wasn’t what was supposed to happen, surely.  He’d come all over the King’s bed, without permission, and the King hadn’t—he hadn’t—this wasn’t right.  It had to be wrong.  Had to be.  Shame burned through him and settled like a hot stone in his stomach.
“I don’t like this.  I still don’t know what they have.  I mean, the stripper thing, sure, but everyone loves a Cinderella story.  Still.  One misstep and the police are going to not just have the right to interrogate Steve, but probably charge you both with obstruction.  Steve—no offense—but, we still don’t know a lot about you.  I know you went through Matt’s questions, but I’d like to get a bio from you that I can work up and give to the press.  Something a bit more colorful than your social security number,” Ms. Potts requested.  “Maybe some details from your childhood or your military service?  Everyone likes a veteran.”
“Not going to let that go, are you?” Tony asked, casting a look over his shoulder and catching Steve’s smirk before turning back to the vista in front of him, while Steve went back to eating his lunch.  Or, second lunch.  Seclunch, Tony mentally snickered.  Or third?  He’d lost count.  Steve ate a lot.  Like, a lot-a lot.  Not that Tony was criticizing, because God knew, the man could turn a muffin into muscle like nobody’s business, and small meals throughout the day were the better part of valor, but damn, Steve had the metabolism equivalent of Usain Bolt on speed doing downhill.  Wearing Heelys.
“God, you are truly awful at lying. Really, don’t even sing ‘Santa Clause is Coming to Town,’ you’ll never make it through the chorus,” Tony said after a moment’s pause.  “Why do you even need seven thousand dollars—no, wait, thirty thousand.  You have twenty-three in savings.  What’s the thirty thousand for?  You said you owed someone.  Who?  Not a bookie or loan shark, I’m pretty damn sure of that.  So, who then? SI gave settlements—generous settlements—to the families of those who—“ Tony stopped, cleaning his throat.  His gaze dropped from Steve and darted to the window, where he stared at nothing.  “To everyone who was hurt in—in what happened.”
“Breaker box. Power lines. Got it,” Steve parroted back to him. “Okay. Well, that's...ah. Anything--anything else I should know about?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Tony said, mouth flattening and brow drawing together into a frown.  “Pick one, and get on with the demonstration.”
It was easy to imagine watching something like this with Tony, maybe trying to sketch it, grabbing for his colored pencils while Tony clicked his tongue and took a digital photo on his tablet, though it would be Steve’s sketch that Tony would save, he knew, not the photo.  Even unfinished, Tony kept them.  He’d even given Steve the page from his journal with the dancing monkey drawing on it, carefully framed, with a note taped to the back that said something about it not being a flying monkey, but that he’d thought Steve would appreciate the reference anyway.
, all the damn time.  Across the dinner table from him, where the popcorn bowl sat on that ugly-ass couch, sitting beside him on the deck while he pointed out Cassiopeia and Cepheus, Lyra and Bootes, the herdsman pushing his plow, with its bright, red supergiant Arcturus glowing at the point.
Finally, Steve pulled away.  He still had one hand cupping Anto’s head, but the other was wrapped around Anto’s waist, apparently holding him up, since Anto’s legs didn’t seem to be working as far as he could tell.  Steve smiled at him, wide and open.
“Ask him to love you, Tony.  Ask him, and I do not think he will say no,” Jarvis replied.
Tony tore his mouth away abruptly. Steve was still chasing the taste when Tony gripped the sides of his head, hard enough to rattle him to attention.  He pushed himself up to his elbows, keeping his weight just off Tony and looked down in confusion.
“Welcome back!  Did you kill a boar?” Cam asked excitedly as soon as Tony crossed the threshold to their chambers.
The lights from the Eiffel Tower glimmered brightly through the far bank of windows as the elevator doors slid open to the second floor restaurant.  Not the actual Eiffel Tower, of course, just the Vegas wannabe.  No one did copycatting quite like Vegas, Tony supposed.  Everything here was bigger and brighter, trying so hard to be
The camera swiveled and caught on Peggy, sitting in one of those wooden-slatted chairs that was anchored to the boat dock where it jutted out over the water.  Behind her, a large speedboat bobbed gently with the waves, and Steve could just make out the A-lined roof of a house perched on a rocky shore.  Her hair was tucked under a wide-brimmed straw hat and dark, squared-off sunglasses took up much of her face, but she was easy enough to recognize.  Tony’s mother sat next to her in a flowing, floral sundress with a blue scarf wrapped around her head to try to combat the wind where it whipped across the lake.
He remembered finding the door panel on one of their trips to Germany. Heidelberg, he recalled.  Christmas, six—no, seven—years ago now.  God, where did the time go?  Down in the Market Place at one of the dozens of antique shops they rummaged through for no other reason than having nothing better to do, enjoying piping hot potato fritters with apple sauce, beautifully-formed cinnamon star biscuits and doughy snowball cakes.  Steve loved Germany.  Which seemed odd to Tony at first, but there was something very satisfying for Steve in all of the changes.  A sense of see, we did do something.  We mattered.  We made a difference.
“I love you,” Tony said.
“Yes, that will be good!” Cam said encouragingly, when Steve raised an eyebrow at him.  “He will like that one.”
“Sorry,” Steve said automatically when they finally broke apart.  He blinked down at Tony, who sighed and arched his back a bit, stretching underneath Steve.  “Just thinking that I like kissing.  And you’re...good at it. I’m--I, ah. I like it, that’s all.”
“Where’s Howard gotten off to now?” Maria asked, glancing around.
“So,” Steve repeated, setting the menu down.
“They were going to find out eventually.  You’d slip, say something.  Cat’s out of the bag, then, right?  I mean… you’re not the best at keeping secrets, you know?  You got the world’s worst poker face, man.  This way, it’s all out in the open.  No worrying about keeping our stories straight or anything.  And, hey, look, it’s not like you’ve got anything to be ashamed about.  Sure, sex for money,” Brock said as he reached around and scratched the back of his head, raising his eyebrows at Steve, “that’s not something you probably want to go around telling the world about, I get it, but these are our friends.  They’re not going to say anything.  Hell, they think it’s a pretty good way to make some bank.  Griff said he even knows a guy who works with one of those high-class escort agency things.  Makes a shitload of money,” Brock continued, pausing just long enough for Steve to wonder if he was supposed to express some kind of interest.  “Anyway, point is, it’s over and done with, okay?  The guys aren’t going to say anything, so you don’t have to worry.  And, now, I want you to know, I’m not mad about the whole skipping out thing.  It’s forgiven, forgotten, whatever.  We’re good.”
Not that Tony had
“I must return to the King’s chambers,” Steve told her.  It was true, he realized.  Tony had said to stay in tonight, hadn’t he?  Something about all the strangers about.  In his panic and turmoil, Steve had forgotten the order.  Or not cared.  He cleared his throat and tried to brush past her, as he had with the guards, but she reached out and wrapped her hand around his wrist as he passed.  She wore long, metal coverings on the ends of her fingers like small spikes, and he felt them dig into his skin where she held him.
The strap cracked a wide stripe across the soft flesh of his ass, wrapping around just at the top of his hip.  Pain flared bright and hot, blooming across his skin in a wave of searing agony.  The way the blow landed, the seam of his ass took the brunt of it, just where the metal cock was embedded, ramming it in hard and sending sparks of pleasure bursting deep within him. His own cock jolted, making the cage seem like it was a heavy vice.  The weight on his balls swung with the force of the blow, pulling at them until an aching, stretching burn settled in.
He undid the clasp and took it carefully off his wrist, holding it in his palm and really looking at it again.  It really was a work of art.  Who did you send a thank-you note to for something like this?  Dear France, thanks for the watch.  Sorry about McDonalds.  He started to put it back over his wrist, then stopped, and flipped it over.  There was an inscription on the back in small, delicate script.  Something he hadn’t noticed before.  His chest gave a sudden, jerky heave, and he felt his eyes sting as his brow drew together.  Tony stared at the words for a long moment, then wrapped the watch around his wrist once again.
The fingers left him. Steve had time to feel relief, and then something hard and rounded, far larger than the fingers, was pushing into him, breaching him.  He gave a stuttering gasp.  His fingers scabbered and dug fruitlessly into the stone table. He squeezed hi eyes shut until the thing slipped past the initial resistance and settled inside him.  He felt it slide out, then it was shoved back in again.  Then again.  Again.  He tried to relax. Let it happen.  Tell himself it wasn’t so bad.  Not the worst pain he’d felt, after all.  He could handle it.
“Haven’t really thought a lot about it, but I don’t really see why not, at least for stuff like this. Education and all.  If you can do the work, why not?” Jim replied.
“Did you get ahold of Happy?” Steve asked, looking up at Tony.
“Undo it? You can do that?” Steve asked.
“Really?  Wow.  That’s—that’s really swell, Tony. That you can do that, I mean.  Getting a machine to—to figure that stuff out.  That’s amazing,” Steve said with a smile that actually reached his eyes.  They did this crinkle-slant at the corners thing when it was one of the real ones, Tony noticed.  It made Steve look softer, somehow, when he was usually all perfectly sharp angles and hardness.  Younger, maybe.  They weren’t actually that far apart in age.  At least he didn’t think.  Which—yeah.
“It isn’t that I don’t appreciate your concern, Tony.  I’m glad you came, even if it was to yell at me some more,” Steve said, meaning it to be light and teasing, though it didn’t sound that way, even to his own ears.  “You are, and have always been, my friend.”
“Seeve,” Anto said.  “Gud. Seeve.”
“Oh,” Tony stammered, trying to find purchase while someone pummeled him in the gut. This was what he'd wanted. Exactly what he'd wanted, in fact. Tony had clearly won at life. Steve signed the paperwork with little fuss, all things considered. It was over and done with. He'd never have to see Steve again after today.
.  The command rang in his head.  This is wrong.  Go to sleep.  His hand stilled, hovering at his shirt collar, then undid the top button and pushed the points aside, sliding underneath to the heated skin there.  He sucked in a breath, held it, and pushed his hand under his neck, gripping the curve just at the base and pressing.  A low, surprised moan escaped him.  He could swear he felt it vibrating through him, down the column of his neck, lower, echoing through his chest and down to the top of his cock.
“But, and hear me out, here,” Tony began, trying to keep his voice light.  “I was thinking, maybe you don’t go in today.  Maybe you just stay here.  Relax.  I’ve got the Board meeting this afternoon, and Obie wants to meet first, or I’d stay.”
“Okay, I’m going to need to approve all your messages first,” Rhodey said, his mouth going flat.
,” Tony spat out, glaring up at the man, who just looked down at him in confusion.  “Quera?  Really?  Put me down, I’ll walk.”
All in all, Tony thought dinner went well.  Stilted conversation, but no property damage, so he considered it a win.  Steve gave him an introduction to Obie, half-hearted though it may have been.  Mr. Stane, my Omega would like an introduction.  Tony puffed out a breath of air through his nose.  Passive-aggressive Alpha-posturing-bullshit.  Honestly.  My Omega would like an introduction.  Not, I’d like you to meet my Omega.  Or, this is my Omega.  My Omega would like an introduction, and I’m not at all happy about it, though that last part was silent.
“I’m on it,” Rhodey promised.
Tony let out a low, shuddering moan.  His hands were still clenching Steve’s arms to keep himself upright on legs that suddenly felt like jelly.  He wanted to feel Steve, though.  Touch him.  How had he gone all these months without touching Steve when it felt like this to be in his arms?  How had he thought anything about that was fine?
“Well.  Let’s just say I’ve been right up to the border a time or seven,” Steve said with a rueful shake of his head.
“Me too,” Tony said after a beat of silence.  Steve glanced up at him, mouth flattened into a grimace, and looked at Tony searchingly for a long moment.  He nodded jerkily, but his shoulders relaxed a bit, Tony noticed.  “I should probably report them or something.”
“Good,” Tony said.  “Open.” Steve did.  This time, it was a piece of buttered bread.  It, too, was fantastic, Steve realized.  A bite of tender, seasoned pork followed.  More wine. Slivers of cheese. Roasted vegetables.  Steve hadn’t realized how hungry he was, but everything tasted amazing, and there was something profoundly caring about the way Tony would choose each bite and carefully place it in Steve’s mouth, almost as if it were ceremonial.  An offering. The way they used to make to the old gods, placing bits of food on plates of bone or antler and praying for rain or sun.
“Original series or Next Generation?” Tony asked.
Tony brushed past him and sprawled on one of the chaise, immediately taking out his tablet and setting to work.
.  He wasn’t sure if he could lie here, even if he wanted to.
Tony was proud of himself for not running out of the room, though he did walk fast enough that he almost managed to bang a knee against one of the tables on his way out.  There was a round of laughter echoing under the door as it closed behind him, but he was too relieved to care.
It was this place, he told himself.  This otherworldly place he woke up in, making him think such errant thoughts.  There was no Shadowman or Nightwalker or whatever someone wanted to call him, though perhaps there was a Man of the Mountain, or at least, maybe there had been, once, long ago, Steve thought as he considered the castle.
“I wish you luck, then, Master Zola.  I’m afraid you will need it with this one,” Sitwell commented with a slight sneer.
“I have a Fazioli at the Tower.  When you come by, I’ll play for you.  Whatever you want,” Tony promised, his voice quavering oddly at the thought.  Nervousness, Tony thought.  Excitement.
These new tendrils of information were winding their way through his head, invaders in a once-ordered land, and as much as a part of him wanted to reject the thoughts as meaningless, or at least less meaningful than some deep, dark corner of his brain wanted to make them, he couldn't dismiss them when they were stored so carefully, huddled and secreted away, but
“Looked a tad more like trying to work your way alphabetically through the alcohol cabinet and your shitty group of not-friends-hangers-on, but whatever gets you through the nights,” Rhodey replied, wrapping one warm hand around Tony’s shoulder and giving it a light squeeze.
There was a low, tight heat crawling through his belly, thumping and pulsing an urgent demand.  Steve was watching him, and for fraction of a second, Tony thought he was going to say something, move, do something, anything—
Tony burst out laughing, which was, he knew, incredibly inappropriate and rude, but he couldn’t help himself.  It was all suddenly just too much, though Coulson’s bland expression didn’t falter.
“Oh, yeah?” Brock said, mouth pursing.  He narrowed his eyes and canted his head to the side. “You sure about this? It’s a lot of money, I get that, and God knows, we could do so much with it.  All those things you said, all that and more, probably.  Some real Robin Hood shit, you know? Be pretty nice not to have to worry so much all the time, not going to lie. I know I’ve been kind of a dick lately with everything going on, and you know how much I hate that, ‘cause it’s not on you, none of this is, and yeah, a million bucks would go a long way to getting us set up real nice, Steve.  Real nice.  But are you sure? Because I don’t want you doing this if you aren’t sure.  Or doing this for me or some shit.”
It smelled like liniment. The kind his mom used to rub on his chest to help him breathe when the coughing fits got bad.  So bad the neighbors complained, and his whole body seemed to ache from the constant, back-breaking hacking, each breath harder to catch than the one before, when he was sure there was some wall he was going to hit one day when his body would just say, here.  Here, and no further.  He thought sometimes his mom thought the same thing, the way she would look at him out of the corner of her eye with such a bone-deep sadness, like the failure of Steve’s body was on her, somehow, and not some strange twist of fate or God or now, what they’d call some kind of genetic mistake, as if all his Alpha-coding got inverted, turned inside out, leaving him with a body that was a parody of what he was supposed to be.
“Probably about the same,” Tony replied reluctantly.  “Their robotics division hasn’t gotten the funding it needs, and with the way DoD doles out those contracts, it’s like Hunger Games, if Katniss and Peeta had to really rough it, and in the end found out they won unreasonable expectations, an impractical timeline and not nearly enough money.”
“It’s just a tour. For…reasons,” Tony said.
“Last I checked,” Stark replied.
“I did.  I do.  But,” Tony sighed, turning around in the cradle of Steve’s arms to face him.  “The place you are from, the people you care for, you carry them with you.  Trying to excise those parts, I thought, would help you adjust.  Help you settle. I was wrong.  Wrong to try to take that from you.  The man you are…for all your faults,” he gave Steve a lopsided smile that was almost sad, “I would not change you, and all of those things, those people, they are a part of you. A part of this strength you bear so well, if not so easily.  I try to…in my mind, sometimes, I try to put myself into your place, and I—I think I might have gone mad from it,” Tony admitted, letting out a nervous laugh that held no mirth.  “You—though.  You have this strength, this heart in you, that I—” he stopped, shaking his head.  “I used to read all those tales of the knights of old and their quests when I was a boy, you know. I would…dream of something like that, some great adventure, meeting some hero like in the stories,” he said, looking over his shoulder at Steve for a long moment, before lowering his eyes, almost demurely, Steve thought, as if he had embarrassed himself.  “A child’s silly daydreaming, nothing more, as I told you before.  It was Rhodey who became the knight,” Tony grimaced.  “And he is certainly a legend at least unto his own mind,” Tony said, trying for a lighter tone that didn’t quite stick.
“I don’t do so well at letting go of the really good things,” Tony murmured as he traced a finger over the bright red numbers displayed on one of the monitors that showed Steve’s pulse.  It was slowly counting up, he noted, as did Tony by his speculative look.  “The ones that really matter.”  Steve could feel his face heating, and there was nothing speculative about the look Tony was giving him now, dark and filled with a promise that made Steve’s mouth go dry.
“Why are you here, Tony?” Steve asked, stiff-backed and holding himself stunted somehow, hunched and impossibly smaller, in a way Steve should never be. He shut the door with far too much care before turning around to face Tony like he was facing the proverbial firing squad. Tony wondered if he looked the same way, resigned and scared and just waiting for the first shot to be fired, so this could finally be done.
were terrible, then it made sense, and I could hate this.  Hate you.  In so many ways, that would be easier.  But, you weren’t terrible.  You weren’t cruel or heartless or any of those things,” Steve said.  It was true, all of it, and he could see the minute loosening of tension around Tony’s mouth.  Tony could hear the truth in Steve’s words, Steve knew he could.  It was true, but it wasn’t truth, not really, and Steve felt that distinction more keenly now than perhaps any other time.
Once Tony got started laughing, it was hard to catch his breath long enough to stop. He’d come to some kind of end where he thought he had control of himself, then Steve would start again and before he knew it, they were acting like a couple of teens at a slumber party, cracking up just by looking at each other.
“Surgery?” Tony finally managed, still trying to get the ink to dry on what Coulson had said.
“I’d love to,” Steve replied.  He started forward, towards Tony, then stopped.  “Tony, I am sorry.  It’s your birthday, and I—I shouldn’t have brought all this up.  I don’t know what I was thinking.  I wasn’t thinking.  You were talking about Tesla, and I…wanted to change the subject.  That was…I should’ve just let you talk.  I like it.  When you talk.  I just.  Some things. I’m not good with them, but it’s nothing on you,” he said in a rush, holding out a hand in front of him like he could wave off the idea. “I really didn’t mean to mess up your birthday brunch.”
“I’ll be downstairs. When you’re ready,” Sam told him quietly, something that was almost an apology in his voice.
“I feel like I should tell you that I don’t
It was awful, to be standing there like this, though Steve couldn’t quite put his finger on why, except that he suddenly felt ridiculous, standing in Tony Stark’s hotel room in his old Army dress blues.  This had been a terrible idea. He wasn’t this person anymore. He was the stripper hired to pretend he could ever have something with someone like Tony, not whoever this person was he was trying to be again.  He couldn’t have that. He couldn’t be that. Tony, of course, looked fantastic. Amazing. The tuxedo fit him like it had been made for him, which it probably had, Steve realized. People like Tony did that. People like Tony—God, what the hell was he even doing here? He didn’t belong here, next to someone like Tony.  He shouldn’t be here.
“You have a very odd sense of justifiable retribution,” Steve observed mildly, sipping the coffee and making a satisfied face.
He pushed himself upright and turned on the shower, letting the hot water sluice over his shoulders and back.  He stayed there far longer than necessary, then shaved, taking more care than usual and refusing to examine why, though he supposed the answer was obvious.  By the time he made it downstairs, he had come up with and discarded numerous ideas for a possible outing for the day that Steve might be tempted to agree to—heh, ‘outing,’ that was funny in an ironic sort of way—and yes, he was a tad punch-drunk at the moment, what of it?
“I could shave you,” Steve offered, the idea springing fully formed into his head, but as soon as it was there, he couldn’t think anything else.  He would love that, to have Tony in his care, to have Tony trust him that way.  His cock twitched, hard and eager, bumping into Tony’s chest, leaving a glistening wet trail, and making Tony’s gaze drag down Steve’s body for a long moment before he raised his eyes up again, a curious, teasing glint shining in their brown depths.
“He’s going to be fine,” Tony said, nodding his head firmly.  “He said a fucking word, Bruce.”
Tony’s tongue dipped into Steve’s mouth, twisting around his own, sliding past one side, then drawing back and gliding over the other.  He tasted like wine and spice and Tony.  His hands were in Steve’s hair, tugging his head back for better access. Steve obliged. He sucked Tony’s lower lip into his mouth as he did, pulling lightly as he arched his neck into the kiss.
.  PEG tube.
“To be fair, that’s what a spy would say,” Stark grinned.  “Seriously, it’s nothing beyond your basic top secret clearance-level background report.  And Pepper looked at your FaceBook. Mainly to check for live-laugh-love posts. Can’t be too careful.”
Steve let out a groan that might have been Tony’s name.  His hips bucked up to meet Tony’s increasingly erratic thrusts.  It seemed as if his whole body was alight with pleasure. Tony’s firm hand formed a sheath around his cock, gripping him tighter. Pressure built deep and hot, pounding through his veins until it erupted in a bright, blinding well of white filling his vision.  He shouted his orgasm in a long, keening wail, body thrashing for a moment, then going taut as a bowstring.
“Sure. Fine,” Tony replied steadily.
He blinked a few times to clear his vision.  Tony wordlessly handed him a towel from the bedside, and he cleaned himself up as best as he could, though honestly couldn’t bring himself to care much at the state he was left in. He felt Tony roll over and lay beside him, not touching, but close enough Steve could feel the warmth emanating from him.  And now we’ve reached that time of the evening, folks, Steve thought crazily as he tried to move his legs enough to get up from the bed, realizing that his body was still not exactly fully functional yet.  He swallowed nervously. It was going to be even more horrifying if he got out of bed and promptly collapsed from sheer pleasure overload.  He didn’t understand.  Tony had been so upset, so angry at himself, at Steve, probably at the world, all because he wanted Steve, but hated the thought of wanting someone like Steve, and then…this?  It made no sense.
"My apologies, Sir.  It does seem my monitoring of your hotel suite has been mildly compromised," JARVIS replied.
“This is exactly what it looks like,” Peggy shot back.
“It…feels good. When it’s you,” Steve said.  His mouth twisted, and he looked down at his hands where they clutched at his robes.
“Wouldn’t you just tip over if you tried to hold it?” Tony wondered.
“Steve, I could’ve gotten in real trouble because I did something highly illegal.  Because I was a stupid kid, and showing off for you a little bit. Maybe,” Tony admitted.  “You really think I’d let you get caught up in all that?  Because of some stunt I pulled?”
Anto didn’t particularly want to stay with other people.  He wanted to make it to Steve’s home, where Brus and Tor, and Clint, and Nasha waited.  He liked hearing about them in Steve’s stories. “Steve home,” Anto insisted, looking up at Steve.
“Ask you?” Steve said.
“Well, I have to call you something,” Tony pointed out. Suddenly, familiar images flooded his mind, and he laughed and shook his head.  “Okay, I am not calling you Brad Pitt or Han Solo or whatever you’re pulling out of my mental spank bank. It’s weird, I mean, I know them, and I can’t--I mean, not Han Solo, but the actor--nevermind.  Got a bit of a himbo vibe going on there, don’t you?”
seem to recall that he got a reaction out of you like pretty much no one ever,” Bucky replied. “You wouldn’t shut up about the entitled, obnoxious poser who came to play soldier for a day and had the unmitigated gall to hit on you while simultaneously insulting you.  Got you all riled up.  I should’ve known right then it was true love.”
“Fine.  Hey, selfie-guy?” Tony shouted at the departing crush of students.  “Yeah, you.  I’ll give you a thousand bucks a week if you take care of this computer and bring it to class for my better half here to use until he decides to stop being ridiculous.”
“Heterocheck complete,” Tony mumbled.
“Huh?” Stark said with a frown when Steve didn’t elaborate. “Oh. Right. Ah, let me just…” he trailed off, glancing quickly over his shoulder and back inside the penthouse. “Actually,” Stark paused. “This could be good. The hotel has some stores we can hit up. Very Pretty Woman-ish.”
“Uh-huh,” What Not to Wear Two said. “Where exactly did these nuptials take place?”
No uniform.  Showered.  Shaved.  Someone wants to tell, not show, Tony thought to himself.  God, you freak out one time over what was, by any estimation, way more blood than any one person should lose, and he never forgets it, Tony thought, finding a strange, fond comfort in that.
“Something wrong?” Tony asked.  He was trying for amused, but Steve could hear the thread of tension in his voice and immediately felt terrible for being the one to put it there.   Tony was trying to make this whole farce go as smoothly as possible, obviously, and going to more trouble than he needed to in order to make Steve feel comfortable.  “Look, I know, I can be kind of an ass sometimes.  Just tell me or nudge me or, I don’t know, we’ll come up with a codeword.  That’s a military thing, right? Codewords.  Secret handshakes, that kind of thing,” Tony continued, the words coming out rushed and tight, and it felt like someone had reached inside Steve’s chest and was squeezing his heart.
“Yeah, well,” Tony stammered, looking down where his sock-covered toes dug into the carpet as Steve’s gaze was drawn back to him. “Don’t suppose I can get your number?” Tony asked with a dubious look, raising his eyebrows, almost in challenge.
“Looking at it,” Tony said. On his phone screen, the man suddenly moved forward and bent down, inspecting Covi.  He poked at it, making the camera wobble. “Pick me up, Hot Stuff. God, that’s meta. Anyway, look at the phone number. Right there!  Big numbers! Oh, there you go,” Tony said as Hot Roof Guy scrunched his face up in confusion for a moment as he looked down at the drone.  Tony hit one of the app’s buttons and the little drone hopped forward a bit, earning a startled laugh from Hot Roof Guy. “That’s it, there you go, look at the cute, little cobbled together science project and be impressed.”
“You’re overthinking it,” Nat observed mildly as she tucked her earpieces back in.  “Stop that, and go hit something until you feel better.”
probably took the prize on the list of Stupid Sex Things Tony Tried, but it felt strangely, singularly good, in a way that Tony couldn’t quite describe.
It was like a tether being cut, leaving him flailing for purchase and finding only air beneath him.  He was reaching for something that wasn’t there, some way that this wasn’t happening, but there was nothing left to grab onto.
“Fancy,” Tony remarked with a huff.  Sitting in a stuffy room that looked like a bottle of Pepto-Bismol birthed a floral arrangement listening to a bunch of Omegas discuss hair products, celebrity divorces and how little McKynleigh knows all her Presidents did not sound like a great deal of fun, but whatever.  Technically, he’d never actually been in one, but he’d lost enough IQ points watching TV shows that depicted them like Downton Abbey: Kardashian Edition to know that he probably didn’t belong.
Tony turned and ducked out of the ballroom, walking nearly blindly down a long hallway outside the ballroom, past the restrooms and coat check, around a corner and down to a quiet, darkened area until he reached a pair of glass doors that led out onto a curved balcony.  It was deserted.  He pushed open the door, half expecting an alarm to sound or someone to pop out and tell him that the balcony was closed for the evening, but no one did.  It was quiet and away—alone, his mind supplied.  He sucked in a deep breath of cool, night air and stared at the view in front of him.
