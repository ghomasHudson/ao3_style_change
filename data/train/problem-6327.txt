To their credit they didn’t ask if she was okay; she was simply herded back to the auditorium with a slightly more imposing group of bodyguards. They all knew this was going to happen eventually. She was just glad Ross hadn’t decided to pay a visit to the Compound because she doubted she could’ve slotted in any extra time to improve security in between working on Rhodey’s twenty-fifth prototype, the Accords, and B.A.R.F.’s recalibrations.
She left it at that, her fingers mindlessly moving across the touchscreen keyboard even as her ears were pricked for any sound of movement from behind her.
“- and yet you are one of the most powerful women in the world,” he finished primly, using the Mind Stone to solder two panels together and Toni had to bite back her reservations on the recommended functionality of the gem.

who was alone in this. Who had a plan because Toni always had a plan even if she had to pull it out of thin air in a split second and cling to it with jagged nails crusted with grease and blood.
Bucky saw her bottom lip tremble for just a moment before Stark swallowed, tearing her gaze away with effort and rubbing her wrist.
that settled into the subtle droop of her shoulders, like she should’ve known. Like she should’ve expected it. Like all her hopes, the ones she didn’t say aloud but Steve knew were ingrained in her had just been trampled on by his thoughtless and unfair
Then Spider-Man landed in front of her blocking his view and the moment was over, the walls coming down with a resounding boom and Toni was unreachable, untouchable in every way.
Toni managed a smiled as they traded muted banter under their breaths, neither one capable of keeping their hands off of each other. To make sure they were real, she realized.
It was the pragmatic approach she’d been trying to sell to the Council and to the rest of the world, tailored to her audience when necessary but the underlying message was the same.
“By the way I’m projecting my voice via Boss’ phone, so you can look at it if it makes talking to me easier.”
T’Challa blew out a puff of air, then sat in the empty seat beside Toni. “I’ll answer as much as I’m able to at this time. I’ve requested to sit on the Accords subcommittee. There will be seven others appointed by the Council, whom I’ve been told will all be neutral and objective members of the international public. That means we have three extra spaces which will be filled by Avengers. This will hopefully provide a more grounding link between us and the Panel and the Council and help us police one another more effectively. The Council has...made several remarks in passing that it might be prudent, at least for image’s sake, that Captain Rogers be on the subcommittee.” When he said this he looked at Toni, who stared back, so many things,
Toni may not believe her own words. This might have been a carefully constructed plan to give the people something to talk about, something to
Then Toni watched with a heart that was increasingly turning to mush, as he spun the skateboard so it was wheels-up and showed them both the underneath where they’d somehow managed to carve - using what Toni could only guess was the electric chisel she couldn’t seem to find - in perfect, loopy script,
Cloak - as Peter and Shuri and now Vision had taken to calling it - hovered just over her shoulder, slotting himself - because according to Stephen it was male - into the space between where she and Stephen sat. The red collar tilted itself slowly from side to side and Toni took a moment to really come to terms with the fact that she was being studied very thoroughly by a sentient piece of
, to their advantage. And you told them to go fuck themselves. I saw you after Afghanistan, how you chose to destroy your father’s legacy because you didn’t want to be an instrument of war. And I saw,” her voice cracked and Toni heard the sound of breaking glass, “I saw you fly that nuke into outer space. I was fourteen and I cried until I was sick because I never got the chance to meet you and I wanted to show you all my inventions. And then you did come back and you continued to save people. Not just to complete a mission but

She hummed sympathetically but it was aimed at him rather than the fact that HYDRA had managed to get away with a very advanced piece of technology, the intended use for which remained unknown by anyone other than HYDRA themselves. He suspected that Toni had burdened herself with so many things that this was just another sugar cube on top of an already precarious mountain.
“We use the mirror dimension to practice magic for a reason. It’s why I incorporated it into The Room. The outside world doesn’t affect us in here and we don’t affect anything out there. Nothing goes out and nothing comes in.” He looked down at her, arching a brow. “Except you, apparently.”
Toni felt her good mood drop and settle like mulch in the base of her belly. Just one more, she kept telling herself. Just one more step and she could get over this hurdle.
“FRIDAY, Mrs. Barton,” she said in a quiet but cheerful tone. “I believe Boss has mentioned me several times. It’s a pleasure to be able to finally meet you.”
When she looked back up at him again, she managed a small, bitter smile as she said, believing every single word she spoke,
Reaching out again, she stroked the curve of Toni’s cheek. Toni shuddered at the touch, her forehead creasing in pain and Laura stilled before moving closer in concern.
Then there was B.A.R.F. and most days Toni was blessedly distracted from the Barnes side of things and had immersed herself instead in the study of Vibranium in its various fascinating forms and interweaving Wakandan tech into it, now that she’d had T’Challa’s permission.
was, he was discovering, even more crucial now than it had been before he’d first put on his army fatigues.
She rubbed a painful, throbbing spot below the arc reactor, just above the valley between her breasts. The place where skin met scar tissue was particularly sore today. When she’d first allowed Helen to take a look at it, Helen had warned her that the cold would affect it, that her lungs would never be completely right again.
“Toni, I—” he started, then stopped, shaking his head like he was berating himself. “I can’t thank you enough,” was what he settled for in the end.
She swallowed then straightened. “Doctor Cho, the stasis rings, if you wouldn’t mind? After that, everybody take fifteen. Bathroom break, lunch, hydrate, whatever. Just be back and ready in fifteen on the dot. It’s the homestretch, guys. We got this.”
It took them less than fifteen minutes to arrive at Tudor Park, which would have been charming during the day but at night was not particularly well-lit and had more than one drunken or drugged up individual that T’Challa would’ve mistook for Peter had FRIDAY not been guiding their steps.
“She didn’t know me anything private; she wouldn’t have even if I’d asked. And she sensored a whole lot,” she quickly told him, shifting guiltily on her seat. “Not the swearing, though. But who am I to judge?” Toni nibbled her bottom lip and Peter narrowed his eyes. “I swear I won’t do it again. This was purely a one-time thing. I’ll...” She gestured vaguely, awkwardly with one hand. “Ask. Next time. Unless it’s life or death, like you’ve lost your mask and have been taken captive by an evil octopus and need saving.”
“I saw you on TV. It was a good speech, the one on Bucky Barnes. So were the rest of them.” She sounded like each word of praise was a handful of rusty nails in her mouth and Nat almost smiled.
“I’m sorry.” It was all she could offer. That and a promise. “I’m coming...I just need a bit more time but I swear. I’ll be home soon. Tell them I’ll be home soon. Please.”
She sighed. “If you’re gonna tell me I look ‘good’ then I’m gonna have to stop you right there.” Her fingers worried the pendant around her neck, the one the kids had given her. “We both know I look like shit. Trying to change the world will do that to you.”
expression that kids seemed to be phenomenally good at and subconsciously copied her motions and traced shapes in the soil.
“Thanks for keeping her with you. Wanna walk over there with me?” He nodded in the direction of the lawn where it was set up for the reception. She agreed and he held his free arm out for her. She chuckled and looped her arm through his.
Steve smiled and nodded. “And thank you for cooperating. I know you’re going to want to rush back to your workshop in the morning so we should head to bed early. But, it’s still too early even for that so what would you say to a movie and hot cocoa?”
“No, Da do it,” Indy mumbled, holding one hand out and making a grabbing motion. Tony made brief eye contact with Steve over Indys head and they silently decided whose meltdown would be worse, Indy’s or the baby’s, but the baby was already calming down with Tony’s gentle swaying.
“You go first,” Steve said to Rhodey and Pepper. And when they both started to protest, “If I go in first I’m not leaving him. It’s fine, just go.” They went first, reluctantly. Steve turned to Indy. “Ready to see Dad in a few minutes?” Indy sat up straighter in Bucky’s lap and nodded.
“Papa!” Indy yelled suddenly, startling the three men. “You woke him and I wasn’t going to.” He stuck his lower lip out in an even more exaggerated pout.
Tony woke up slowly, painfully, and for a moment he had forgotten what happened. Unfortunately, he all too quickly was reminded that he and his son had been kidnapped while walking out of the tower to walk to the coffee shop. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet in case they were in the room but he could feel that he was strapped down to what felt like a chair you’d sit in at the dentist. His legs were strapped to the bottom with some type of metallic bands and there was one around his waist as well. His hands were cuffed behind him. He had been wearing a sweater but that was gone now and he could feel the chill in the room.
“Yup, our good boy.” Tony kissed him on his forehead. Meanwhile, Steve got in the other side to resume his seat in the back, this time with a bag in hand.
Steve smiled. “He’s good. He got some fluids through an IV and he’s all cleaned up. You wanna hold him?” Tony nodded and held his arms out. Steve placed their son in Tony’s arms, careful not to jostle the IV that was still in Tony’s forearm. Luca yawned but didn’t even bother opening his eyes, just snuggled into the new chest he was placed on. “How do you feel?”
“I never had a life like that. And it was only, what, weeks?” Steve nodded. “Everything you did for me, the bedtime stories, the baths, cutting the crust off my sandwich’s, the teddy bear. Even the timeout. Jesus, Steve, you were perfect.” Tony put his hands on Steve’s knees. “Thank you.” Steve smiled and had his own tears now.
“Please, please, please call me Steve. How many times do I have to ask, huh?” Steve ruffled his hair. “And I’m glad you answered, I’m sure Tony wanted to talk to Luca more than me anyway.” Steve leant down and kissed the top of Luca’s head and Luca tried to look around for the source, looking left and right, but couldn’t figure out where the feeling had come from. Tony laughed.
“Yeah. Let’s just get strapped in first.” He helped Bucky strap himself in around Tony then sat next to him and did the same for himself. Tony was so small they couldn’t buckle him so he’d have to be held anyway. “Tony, you wanna come here?”
“Get out of the workshop, out of my sight,” Tony swiveled his stool around to face the table. Steve didn’t move. “Go, or I’ll have JARVIS help you leave with a suit.”
“Sorry we woke you, Peanut.” Tony sat him up a little in his arms. “This is dad,” he said, pointing to Steve. “I’m going to be your dad too because Steve here is willing to share you, but you gotta call him something.”  Steve smirked.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said sincerely. “Really. I’m sorry I scared you. I love you and Indy and I want to make sure I’m here for both of you as long as I can be. I’ll be more careful, I promise.”
They found Bucky at the dining table trying to feed Indy some cut up bananas while the boy sat on his lap, but he was still miserably crying, albeit quietly. Steve’s brow furrowed.
He didn’t pull on her earlobe this time and he looked inside as quick as he could, inspecting the canal and eardrum. Poppy cried pitifully, breaking all of their hearts with the sound of her cries. Bucky kept his hand on her and Tony whispered in her other ear, trying to calm her.
“One thing at a time,” he replied. “Text me if something happens before I get back.” Bucky nodded and Tony went off to find the doctor.
“Actually, if you want to give it to him now you can. If we do it all at once it’ll be too much for him.” Steve sat down next to Bucky and stood Indy up on the floor at the coffee table. Bruce put the gift bag on the table in front of him. Tony entered the room with a platter of vegetables and dip which he put on the end table.
“We told you Bruce was safe. He’s our friend,” Steve said, refusing to waver even though when he looked at his boyfriend Tony could see the strain of trying to remain serious and not just scooping the boy into his arms and cuddling him. “I need you to apologize to him and then you’ll have a time out.”  Indy turned away from Steve’s legs and glanced at the doctor.
“Not yet. I wanted to wait, just in case, you know?”  Steve nodded, looking at the little boy. “You want me to introduce you?”
“It’s amazing,” Tony assured him. “I wouldn’t trade this for the world.” Tony closed the space between them to kiss Steve softly.
Tony stepped forward. “Security will show you out,” he told her as he gestured for the guard in the hallway. “Thanks again.”
“Okay, what did I say you had to do before opening that?” Bucky asked Indy as they walked into the living room. Indy was carrying the bag that contained his doll even though it was half his size.
“How are you doing, darling?” He asked, walking up to Steve. He helped pull the front of his shirt down once Steve got it over his head. Steve shook his head.
“Love you more,” Steve replied as he rested his forehead against Tony’s for a brief moment, eyes closed. With a sigh he pulled away smiling and they both turned to their friends.
Steve fed Indy for a few more minutes, making sure he was eating slowly so it wouldn’t upset his stomach. He looked over to Bucky who had finished his own soup and was now watching them with a small smile on his face.
“Yes,” Tony yelled at him, turning quickly and punching Steve’s bicep. Tony stumbled a little at the force he put behind it and Steve didn’t budge.
Steve smiled. “Hey, sweetheart.” He offered his finger and she grabbed on immediately with one hand, her other one still fisted in Tony’s t-shirt material.
Steve waited til the door closed behind Clint to look down at Tony. He pushed him away a little so he could make eye contact. “What’s this all about, huh? You know you take naps everyday.”
This is short, it’s really just to bridge the last chapter and the next (because most of the next one is written already.)
“I understand, thank you. I don’t like that your mind seems to go straight to me taking him from you whenever something bad happens, but, that’s a conversation we can have another day I think.”  He turned toward Indy and tapped his back with one finger. “Roll over.”
“There’s more,” she said. “Indy?” Indy jumped off Steve’s lap, leaving the bears there instead which Steve dutifully wrapped his arms around. Indy bounced over to Rhodey who held out the bag he was carrying. When Indy struggled to hold it and reach in at the same time, Rhodey put it on the table for him. Indy rooted around in the bag for a minute and then pulled out something that he quickly tried to hide in his small hands. He turned his back to Bucky and took the few steps over to him backwards. Bucky put his hand out once he reached him, steadying him.
They couldn’t have asked for better weather. A spring day, bright and sunny, but not too warm. Bucky was on Indy duty, and the boy was currently excitedly bouncing around Bucky who was trying to get Poppy dressed. He had just managed to get her white leggings on over her diaper when Indy jumped up on to the bed next to her to tickle her. Poppy giggled and waved her arms around.
Tony sighed. “Sorry I woke you, Munchkin,” he whispered, hoping to at least let Steve get some more sleep. Indy yawned in response. “Close your eyes and try to get some more rest okay?” He patted the boys hand where it was resting on his stomach and then climbed out of bed.
Steve ran his other hand over her head, lightly ruffling the thin wisps of baby hair she had. “Her hair’s darker than Indy’s,” he said. Tony nodded in agreement.
“Stuffies!” Indy answered excitedly. “Papa and Da,” Indy explained holding them out so Bucky could look closer.
“If, for whatever reason, you want this mess back,” she gestured to Tony, “then you need to make the right decision. Tomorrow we’ll send you a link that you can reply to.”  The stream went dead and the TV resumed the full screen original stream. Steve watched as the man left and the woman grabbed Luca out of Tony’s arms, managing to wake the boy abruptly, and carelessly dropped him on to the table. Luca was crying and Tony was yelling at her, pleading really.
“Good boy,” Steve leaned over and kissed Indy’s cheek. “And thank you, Happy. That was very thoughtful. All right, so everyone sit, relax. There’s snacks out and pizza in the kitchen. I’ll bring out some drinks.”
They all thanked him as he left and Steve sighed and looked at his watch. He pat his hand on Indy’s hip. “You hungry? It’s dinner time.” Indy shrugged and buried his face between Tony and the mattress.
Bucky smiled then looked over at Tony. “If you don’t mind another resident here, that is,” he asked. Steve scoffed because the idea that Tony wouldn’t want this baby here, even after the incident with Indy, was ludicrous.
“I trust you to be there with him and assess the situation I just hate that we’re bringing this all up for him. She’s asking about the day you found him. He said he was strapped to a bed.” Bucky nodded. “She thinks you can help her lead the questions to get more info.”
They met Bucky in the waiting room and Tony motioned to Bucky. “Switch with me.” He held his arms out for his son and Bucky got an arm around Steve’s back to hold him up as they walked out. Happy met them at the entrance and Steve, Tony and Indy piled in the back with Bucky in the passenger seat and they finally headed home.
Tony slowly walked Steve into the bathroom and leaned him against the counter while he started to take the sweats off of him. “Shower or bath?”
“Why not? I like it. He’s your son, he could share your middle name,” Tony shrugged. “Indiana Grant Rogers. Has a nice ring to it. Your choice though, so it doesn’t matter,” Tony added, trying to sound like it didn’t mean anything to him even though Steve could see right through it.  Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and tugged him closer.
“Took her awhile to stop crying but I think the water felt nice for her,” Bucky replied. He reached forward to grab the pacifier he had left on the coffee table earlier for her. He offered it and she latched on immediately as if she was waiting for just that. “Thanks. For helping me and  just...everything,” he said, looking down at his socked feet, curling his toes against the carpet and not making eye contact.
“Okay, let’s see.” He pulled a stethoscope out of the medical bag he had fully stocked since no one wanted to accept that he wasn’t that type of doctor. “I’m just going to have a listen to her chest, see if it sounds clear,” he explained for Bucky’s sake, to make him feel more comfortable. He listened to a few different places on her chest and then had Bucky sit her up to do the same on her back. “Sounds good.” He put that away and took his next tool out to check inside her ears. He held her ear lobe out and pressed the scope in then did the same to the other side but that time she batted his fingers away as best she could. “One second, almost done, Poppy.” He put the tip of the scope in and she screeched and then sobbed. Bucky tensed, gripping her tighter and shooting a menacing glance at Bruce. “Okay, okay,” he soothed. He pulled back to speak to Bucky before continuing. “I know she doesn’t like it but I’m going to have to look in her ear, Bucky. I’m assuming it’s an ear infection by the reaction but I can’t prescribe medication without knowing for sure.”
“No,” he answered softly. He leaned forward a little to pick up the baby so Steve let go. “Wanna go see Papa?” Tony kissed Luca’s cheek and then offered him to Steve who took him immediately. “Pepper will be here in an hour, Steve, and I just,” Tony shook his head. “It’s overwhelming.”
Tony let out a small whine but shook his head. Steve kissed his temple and then sat him on the bathroom counter. He wet a washcloth in warm water, rang out the excess and then looked at Tony. “Let’s get you cleaned up, huh?”  Tony nodded, taking in a stuttering breath. Steve wiped his face, neck and hands down with the cloth and then set it aside. He pushed Tony’s hair back where it was stuck to his forehead and sighed.
“None of the Avengers are home yet,” she answered. “Happy is close. If you’d like I could tell him you need a ride and for him to watch the children after?”
“She’s just going to be in the communal living area with him. JARVIS will still be able to tell us if he really needs us, but if all he needs are some cuddles and a diaper change Pepper can handle that so we can talk.” Tony relaxed slightly so Steve lessened his grip on Tony.
“I know, baby. I love you, too.” Steve pet his hair and Tony buried his face in Steve’s lap, pulling the blanket up more around his shoulders so all Steve could see was his brown hair sticking out. After a few minutes he felt Tony fully relax and start snoring softly. Steve smiled and turned his attention to the TV to let Tony finish his nap.
Tony heard Steve gasp behind him. “Buck?” Steve surged forward then only stopping when he was about a foot away from him glancing down at the kid that was holding Bucky’s hand.
“It was hard on him today. He’s a little upset,” Steve replied sadly. “He went to Bucky right away as usual.”
“Look this was always going to be a lot of work. I just want to make it as easy on you as possible. You gave me this,” he gestured to Luca. “I have a son and we’re a family. I have you. I never thought I’d have any of this, before or after the ice. So, I’m the one that should be thanking you.” He moved his hand off Tony’s waist and brought it to up his cheek, rubbing his thumb lightly along his husbands cheekbone. Tony turned his head and kissed Steve’s palm.
Tony ended up in basically a kneeling position on the sofa cushion, straddling Steve, and he  settled his weight back onto Steve’s thighs. Steve instantly brought his hands up around his husbands back, hugging him close. Tony buried his face into the space below Steves chin.
“Yes,” Bruce answered. “She’s just going to be a little uncomfortable for a few days, but, I  promise she’ll be fine. For now, give her some meds to reduce her fever and help with the pain. Do you have some on hand?”
“I bet. You didn’t pop any stitches but the incision bled a little. I’ll just clean it off and bandage it back up. You’ll be fine. Then you can just rest and take some pain meds, okay?” Bucky cleaned the area with antiseptic and gauze then put a clean bandage over it and taped it down. He got Tony’s medication and a bottle of water from the kitchen and helped him sit up slightly to swallow the pills.
Steve and Tony smiled at that. “Yeah,” Steve answered. He looked up at Bucky. “Are you ready to tell him,” he trailed off, nodding purposefully at the baby.
“I’m going to stay, sweet boy. It’s okay,” he consoled. Tony poked his head in the door since Steve was taking so long getting Indy ready.
“Okay, I’m on my way. Indy, why don’t you give Bucky a hug and you can have breakfast with him.” Bucky took Indy before he could even respond and Tony returned to his bedroom. Steve was sitting on the side of the bed, hunched in on himself.
“I got away from Hydra about 10 months ago. As long as I don’t hear the trigger words I’m fine. I’m just me,” he answered quietly.
“Wanna go home.” Steve turned his face so we was hide in Tony’s shirt. To soak up the tears, Tony assumed, when he started to feel a damp patch. He hugged him closer.
Tony laughed, he couldn't help it, it was so ridiculous to think of Steve Rogers admonishing him for swearing again that he couldn't hold it in. Steve looked delighted. "No, no one does that but you, Cap," Tony replied as his laughter died down but he froze at the slip of the nickname. His breath came harder as he realized how comfortable he'd been for a split second before reality hit him again. To his horror he felt his eyes begin to burn with tears. He tried to brush it off as if he were getting back to work but the tears came quicker now and there was no hiding it even as he turned his back on Steve because Bucky was beside him still. "Shit," he mumbled. "I have to work on this why don't you both go watch TV upstairs or something," Tony tried, hoping they'd take the hint, but Bucky wasn't having that.
“I think I can accommodate that.” Tony got in and sidled up to Steve throwing an arm over his stomach and holding him tight. He tilted his head and kissed Steve’s cheek. “Good night, Darling.”
“I don’t really know how to guess kids ages, but she can hold her head up on her own. But, if she was maybe only a couple months or so when Indy met her then that would put her around 6 now.”
“Pa,” Indy answered between giggles. Indy must have woken up when Steve was getting ready to leave so he deposited him in their bed to sleep the rest of the morning with Tony. Steve and Natasha were handling a job for Shield and would be gone most of the day.
Steve huffed a laugh. “We can watch a movie? Not this one,” he said as he glanced at the talking cartoons.
“Which is a crime,” Tony stressed, “and exactly why we are going to watch it.” Tony left the room to work on the cocoa and Steve smiled to himself, content.
“Super soldier DNA,” he said out loud as he saw that heading on one of the screens. “So she was created the same way,” he said to Bucky.
Tony looked at Bucky questioningly when they had finished. “Go for it,” Bucky said, without Tony having to ask. Tony stuck his thumb in his mouth so quick it would have been comical if they weren’t in such a dire situation. “I’m going to sit you right here for a sec.” He put Tony’s bottom on the counter and the boy reluctantly let go. Bucky stayed close but started to peel off what adult Tony called his ‘superhero suit,’ the layers of Kevlar and Vibranium threaded fabric. Once the outer layer was off he was down to a short sleeve tee with a thin but long sleeve zip-up hoodie over it. He unzipped it. “Let’s get you warmed up,” he held his hands out for Tony who looked so happy to be picked up again that it made Bucky feel sad for however this kids childhood had gone. Tony clung on to him again and Bucky zipped the fabric up over his little body. It was a tight fit but it would warm him up and leave Bucky’s hands free to explore the room.
“Look, sweetheart,” Steve nudged. Indy picked his head up off Steve’s shoulder and looked at where Steve was pointing. Indy looked positively shocked at the assortment in front of him. Steve smiled and kissed his temple. “See anything you like here?”
“Don’t you look adorable?” she said to Poppy, reaching out immediately. The baby leaned forward and Bucky passed her over.
“Yeah, Santa came and brought gifts for you and Poppy. You wanna come with me to wake up Daddy and then we can go see?” Indy yawned and nodded so Steve pulled the blankets back and picked him up. Indy clung on to Steve instantly and he brought him into his and Tony’s room. Tony was sprawled out on his back sound asleep. “Here, you wake up Dad,” Steve said with a smirk as he placed Indy onto the bed next to Tony.
Steve and Tony returned to the living room, Steve sat first and beckoned for Tony to cuddle up next to him. “Wanna watch a Christmas movie?”
“Hey kiddo, come here.” Indy grabbed onto Bucky and held him tight and Bucky felt the little hitch in is breath as he started to cry softly. Bucky rubbed his back.  “You’re okay, buddy. I’m gonna get him some juice,” he said to Steve. “Make sure they don’t roll off the sofa?” He nodded toward Tony and Poppy.
Tony smirked. “Okay, why not?” He grabbed a pinch of chocolate chips and a few blueberries and held his hand out in front of Indy. “Put them on top of the batter and then I’ll flip it. Don’t put your hand too close.” Indy did it, one at a time, incredibly slowly, and Tony wondered how burnt it would be by the time he got to flip it. When he finally finished he looked at Tony expectantly. “Very good job. I have to flip it now to cook on that side so I have to put you down.”
“Maybe just one pack for now. He’s not even using them yet,” he laughed. Tony debated on which one, deciding on the robots finally and dropping it in the cart. He had picked out a couple of pajama sets and a few long sleeve shirts, all of which Steve agreed they needed. Steve picked out a few more of the pajamas himself before they left that area.
That’s how long it had been now, Tony being fed the bare minimum once every morning and Luca feeding twice a day. Steve barely slept himself, unable to tear his eyes off the livestream. Peter was much the same, although Steve forced him out of the room and into bed every night to at least attempt sleep, even if he only managed a few hours.
“Yeah she is,” Bucky replied quietly. The baby chose that moment to squirm and spit out the pacifier. She opened her eyes and whined but Indy leaned his head forward catching her gaze.
Tony reached into the container and pulled out a handful of puffs and gave Luca one. The baby took it excitedly, stuffing it in his mouth and humming. Steve laughed and Tony gave him another puff once he finished chewing.
“I know. I mean, if you had been a few inches closer or he moved his arm differently when he swung he could have hit you in the chest. What If he hit the reactor? Or even next to it. Jesus, Tony this could have been so much worse.”
He walked out to the living area where Tony was pacing back and forth with a fussy baby in his arms while Indy repeatedly asked to hold her. He smiled because the sight of his boyfriend with a tiny baby made him feel like he wanted that in a way that he’d never really thought of before, even after they got Indy.
“Well, thanks Tony. I’m gonna head out but you guys need anything or a ride, doesn’t matter the time just call.”
“Indy,” Steve tried to say as sternly as he could while still whispering. “Dad’s sleeping, we don’t want to wake him up.” Indy didn’t reply but he stomped over to the chair in front of the window and plopped himself into it, cuddling his bear to his chest. Bucky looked back at Steve and rolled his eyes.
“Tony?” Steve asked softly. Tony snapped the folder shut, looking up at Bucky angrily. He shoved the folder into Steve’s chest who took it and opened it immediately.
This was delayed because I started Camp Nanowrimo and its taking up a lot of time! But I’ll keep updating, promise!
Steve chose that moment to come back down, arms full of a large tray carrying a serving bowl and 3 smaller bowls, utensils and napkins.
The four of them found the door and waited. Steve held his breath but he did soon hear a mechanical whir. The box was unlocking and the metal door creaked and then, just, popped open. Natasha hummed.
“So that’s a yes, then,” Tony stated as if it were obvious. “How lucky am I to have a boyfriend who would rather hang out with the killer of his boyfriends parents rather than his actual boyfriend?”
“I know. I don’t know if we’re going to be able to see him right now, but we can ask.” He felt a small nod. He cracked the cap off the Apple juice. “Take a sip.” Indy did then tapped Bucky softly on is hand. “Yes, buddy?”
“Sugar’s the best, huh?” Clint said with his own mouthful of cake and Indy waved his frosting covered fingers at him.
“Yeah, you’re Indy. But your full name is going to be Indiana Grant Rogers. You like that?” He bounced Indy in his arms, knowing he couldn’t fully comprehend what he meant.
“No, please,” he replied lifting his arms out to Tony, starting to get upset. “No, please,” he said again and Tony hated to think about why that was the one phrase the kid seemed to know so well and used repeatedly. He didn’t want to imagine this tiny, young, adorable kid begging some Hydra thug to not make him do something or to not do something to him with a whimpered ‘no, please.’ Tony reached out to grab the kid under his armpits and brought him to his chest.
He then took his son from Bruce and went over to the backpack he’d packed for the rescue that he dropped by the door to the jet. He pulled Luca’s favorite blankie out, the one with puppies on it, and wrapped it sound Luca’s body leaving just his head and arms unwrapped. “There we go, all comfy with your blankie,” Steve said with a kiss to his forehead. “You’re my little puppy, huh?” Luca reached a hand to Steve’s lips and Steve pretended to eat them which got a shocked smile and giggle from his son. Steve smiled back but also teared up because it was the first smile he’d seen from his son in so long, in person or live-stream. “You’re such a good boy,” he said cuddling him close. “You were so good for Uncle Bruce, weren’t you?” Luca’s eyelids were drooping and his head kept falling into Steve’s shoulder. Steve brought his hand up, cupping Luca’s head, and keeping him flush against him. “Just sleep, sweet boy. You need to rest. Everything’s okay now.” Steve swayed and walked around the cabin of the quintet, circling Bruce and Tony so he’d be close in case Tony woke up.
“No, baby. You have to go home and get a good nights sleep with Bucky and Poppy, okay? Then you can come back to visit tomorrow,” Steve answered. “Can we have kisses?” He asked before Indy could protest. Bucky leaned him closer and Indy kissed Tony’s cheek. Tony brought his hand up and ruffled the boys hair.
“So she’ll be Steve’s too then,” Bucky replied, keeping his voice down so the agent couldn’t hear them.
Peter was sitting on the sofa playing peek-a-boo with Luca sitting on his lap facing him. He heard a buzz and saw that Steve’s phone was on the coffee table. He looked and saw that someone was calling. A picture of Tony holding Luca lit up the screen and the name HUSBAND across the top. Peter wondered if he should answer it. He grabbed it and accepted the call.
“You did the right thing. You shouldn’t be alone here.” He checked his watch. “Couple hours and you’ll be able to see him.”
“I know,” Bucky said. “But someone should, and I’m here. Promise I won’t lecture you,” he added. Tony huffed a slight laugh but nodded so Bucky could help lay him out flat.
“I’d love to but I don’t think it’s gonna be that easy, kiddo.” Bucky managed to stand up, the serum in his system seemed to have taken care of whatever beating he took before. Tony scrambled to his feet and grabbed Bucky’s wrist with both his hands.
“Uh, yeah. Yesterday was a rough day. I figured we’d try to start this one off better,” he replied sheepishly. Tony blushed, looking down at his feet.
“Hate you,” Tony yelled in response. He sat up as Steve crouched down to his level. “Go away.” He swiped at Steve with a flailing hand and Steve caught it gently before it slapped him in the stomach.
“Well, now we know. We’ll plan something for him.” Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and squeezed it comfortingly. Steve nodded.
Tony smiled. He held his hand over Indy’s keeping it in place. “Yeah, sweetheart. Nothing could ever change that.” Indy nodded agreeably and laid himself against Tony’s chest.
Tony huffed a laugh. “You think? We knew this would be hard but we can’t keep ignoring his past as if it didn’t happen.” Bucky nodded.
“Hey,” Steve said softly, coming up beside them. Bucky gave him a small smile. “Buck, did you, uh. Did you tell him who I was?”
“Da?” Indy called out as he got up on his knees next to Tony and put his little hands on Tony’s chest. He pushed a little and called out to him again. Tony groaned.
“Ah,” she squeaked out, reaching one hand out to him. Bucky leaned closer so Tony could hold her hand. Her sniffles quieted and she turned back into Bucky after she let go of Tony’s hand.
Tony tried to soothe his son as best he could while not being able to offer him anything.  At one point he scared Tony by gasping for breath as if he were choking because he was borderline hyperventilating so Tony did the only thing he could do. He held him tight with his one free arm and started talking loudly to be heard over the cries about anything and everything that popped into his head. He kept up the running commentary until the little boy passed out from exhaustion and Tony could finally stop, head dropping forward as tears started flowing. He kept his head down not wanting to give his captors the satisfaction and not wanting Steve to see how distraught he was getting after only one day.
“Don’t be jealous, Steve. I can add both to yours too,” Tony replied with a smirk. Steve leaned over and kissed his cheek.
“Please,” he said, tugging on the man’s wrist. Bucky looked down at him and Tony lifted one hand up in silent question to be held. Bucky picked him up, adjusting the shirt so it covered him everywhere it needed to. Tony cuddled into Bucky’s chest, resting his head on his shoulder and shivered.
“I know, darling. It cost me like ten bucks, believe me I have no illusions that its anything more than a cheap kids party store setup.”
The Quinet door opened and Bruce was waiting for them. Steve and Natasha entered the jet and Clint and Coulson took the SUV back.
Tony placed Indy standing on the floor next to Bucky’s door. “Wait here for one minute while I sneak in and grab Bucky’s bag, okay?”
“JARVIS can you make a list on my phone of everything we mentioned today or this week that we needed?”
“Will do. I love you guys. Hey Pete, flip the camera.” Peter changed back to the front facing camera and gave a little wave to Tony. “Thanks for being cameraman today,” Tony laughed. “And for keeping my boys company.”
Tony had a house in the Hampton’s so when the topic of where the wedding should be held came up they were both in pretty quick agreement that that would be the perfect place. There was a large, private lawn where they could setup and they planned on keeping it small anyway. Close friends and family, that’s it.
“Good.” He leaned over kissing the back of Indy’s head then leaned up higher to kiss Tony. “I love you.”
“Careful with Da,” he assured. Steve placed him laying alongside Tony. Indy rested his head on Tony’s shoulder and Tony put his arm around Indy’s back. Steve moved the bear so it was between Tony’s legs over the blanket and out of the way.
“I’m not going anywhere. Neither is Indy.” Steve cupped the side of Tony’s face, holding him as he snuggled in close. “You’re his dad too. I just thought I should say all this because you were acting different, I don’t know,” Steve trailed off.
“Yeah, by the way, he doesn’t like baths,” Bucky said drily. Steve sighed, rolling his eyes. “Hey, we haven’t had a chance to talk yet. I didn’t know there was going to be a midnight bath.”
“You want Poppy to open hers?” Tony asked to which Indy nodded. Tony all but ran to the tree, grabbing a small package and thrusting it in Bucky’s direction. “It’s not from Santa, it’s from me,” he exclaimed with all the excitement of child.
"Okay you don't have to make some big gesture like this to prove you're gonna be nice to me, just read them," Tony laughed.
“You’re okay, Peanut. The seat is to keep you safe inside the car while we drive to the store, that’s all,” Tony told him calmly.
“Littler than me,” Steve pointed out. He dropped Peter back down to his feet but pulled him against his side with an arm around his shoulders. “I’m glad you came by today too.”
Steve nodded quickly. “Okay, yeah. Come on, let’s get out of the lobby.” He gestured for Bucky  to follow and Bucky picked the kid up and held him as he followed Steve, Tony and Natasha following close behind. They entered the elevator and Steve went to select the button for their personal floor but Tony pushed his hand away selecting the floor where the Avengers normally hold their meetings instead. Steve made eye contact with Tony who just shook his head and looked away.
“Okay, hey, shh. You’re welcome, but you know I’d do anything for him, you don’t have to thank me. It’s okay.” Bucky patted his back and then ran his hand up and down while Tony’s crying subsided. He finally pulled away, cheeks flushed from crying but also, Bucky was sure, embarrassment.
“I’d like to think that wouldn’t be possible but who knows. Maybe it’s nothing, maybe it’s just a doll.” Bucky checked his watch. “I’m gonna go get your kid from timeout. I didn’t ask him about this yet because I wanted to talk to you first and see if you would be okay with it.”
“Tony’s a reasonable person. He’s just beyond upset right now and not thinking about it clearly. This was all on Hydra and I think once he has some time to process it, he’ll see that.”
“He’s on a lot of meds so he’s a little dazed. But you and Indy were the first thing he asked about,” Pepper answered. “We’ll check in with him later, you guys get in there.”
Steve stood as Annie did and held out his hand to shake. “Thank you, for everything. We’ll be in touch.”
“No, Da. No leave.” Indy pulled his hood back to show his dad, sounding just on the edge of nervous, like he wasn’t 100% sure it was a joke anymore. Tony caught on to that because he dropped the charade immediately.
Steve, Tony, Clint, Natasha and Bruce had just settled in for their weekly team movie night when JARVIS interrupted with an announcement.
“Come on, keep walking. We’re going in the car.” Bucky started to walk towards the car but Indy didn’t budge.
“It’s only been like a half hour actually, he was being kind of fussy.” Steve smiled. “Let’s go,” he told Tony, standing up.
Fury met them inside the building to debrief so they went to a conference room and Steve joined up with them once he had put the suit in Tony’s workshop.
“Just once the second day I had him. I just figured it was what I was feeding him. God knows what Hydra had him eating but he hasn’t known what anything I offered him even is.” Steve hummed in acknowledgement, taking in that information.
Steve and Tony had, of course, explained this the night before, but Indy was understandably nervous at the thought of going to a therapist. He didn’t really understand what it was for. “She’s going to talk to you about the time before you lived with Papa and Daddy.”
“He’s cleaning up in the kitchen. I’m going to give you a quick bath because you’re very messy,” he said softly. He turned into the bathroom and put the llama on the counter and sat Indy next to it, holding him steady with his hands on the boys sides. “I know you hate this, but we’re going to do a quick bath to get you clean so you can look nice for your party. Can you be a good boy for me?” Indy started to tear up.
Tony stepped up behind him leaning into his back. “You were fine before. I know he was upset about the bath but he seems okay now, I don’t think it ruined his day.”
Tony was lying on his back but glanced over at the greeting. He smiled at Steve’s sleep tousled hair and sleepy look on his face. “Morning, darling.” Tony rolled over to face him.
“No,” Indy mumbled through the cushion. Steve picked hm up under the arms and sat him properly on the cushion.
"Most of the feeling in the damaged area is gone. But the rest of it is pretty much like a regular arm. Shuri wanted it to be like having my real arm back, not just be functional."
“Captain,” JARVIS called out just as Fury and Coulson had arrived at the tower. “There’s a secondary stream coming through, I’m going to show you that as well, beside the other one.” Steve ran back over to the TV and saw the screen spilt down the middle, one side the current live stream and the new one which was a different angle and closer. It was the woman, and Tony was behind her holding Luca.
“There was no hope for this party lasting tonight,” he chuckled. Steve changed into pajamas and got into bed.
“Yeah!” Indy shouted excitedly. Steve grabbed a new pull-up as well and the wipes and told Indy to follow him to his and Tony’s room. Steve sat him on the bed once he came over and pulled the stained shirt off his head.
“Love you too, Luca.” Peter left and Steve stepped closer to Tony and his son. He wrapped his arms around them and hugged them close.
“Come on. What else am I going to do with the million dollars I’ve made so far this month alone,” Tony asked.
Bucky glanced up at Tony and then behind him a few feet where Steve slowly made his way forward. “It’s Bucky,” he replied softly. “Just Bucky.”
The lock on the door rattled, a loud metallic sound. Repeated clangs of metal on metal which Bucky could only hope was Steve’s shield breaking through. Tony whimpered.  “Shh,” he cupped the back of Tony’s head and left his hand there protectively. “I got you.” The door finally swung open and Bucky braced himself but immediately he registered it was Steve’s spangly outfit. He let out a sigh of relief.
Tony rolled his eyes. “I like the name,” he mumbled, it didn’t elaborate. Steve sighed, running his hand through his hair.
“Okay, thanks.” He headed to the elevator, bag in hand, and proceeded to the main floor. “Hey, Stevie,” he greeted as he walked into the kitchen.
“Okay,” Annie replied, jotting some notes in her notebook. “Here,” she pushed the puzzle towards the boy and sat up straight reaching out right away grabbing the wooden puzzle pieces and pulling them off the board. “Do you like cars and trucks?” She asked, gesturing to the image on the puzzle.
Indy fell asleep in his high chair while the two men finished up their food, tired from a day of his papa chasing him around. “I’m going to put him on the sofa,” Steve said. “We shouldn’t let him sleep too long or he’ll never go to bed later.” Tony nodded. “Then I’m going to try to talk to Bucky again, see where his heads at.” Tony nodded again, looking down at the baby girl resting calmly against his chest and sucking her thumb.
“If that so much as even crossed his mind then I have done something very wrong,” Tony breathed deeply, feeling the beginning of anxiety attack coming and trying to stave it off. “Take her,” he said suddenly, turning closer to Steve to transfer the baby.
“Ohh, Christmas. I guess that’s okay then,” Tony said, opening his eyes and pulling Indy into a hug. “Hello my little reindeer.” He kissed his son and then sat up. “Let’s get out there, shall we?”
“Want me to do it?” Steve asked and Bucky nodded. He placed the earpiece in her ear and pressed the button. She whined and pulled her head away but Steve brought his other hand up to cup the side of her head and gently held her still. “Almost done, sweetie, hold on,” he told her softly. When it beeped he took it out and read it aloud. “101.8,” Steve announced. “A little elevated but did you just give her a bath?”
He brought him to the bathroom and took off the soiled shirt first. Indy shivered and Steve noticed. “Sorry, buddy. You’ll be warm in a minute. JARVIS can you start the water for the tub please?”
“Well, on that note,” Pepper said, standing up. “It might not seem like it, but this seems to be the perfect time for my gift.” She grabbed the box and brought it over and placed it on Tony’s leg that didn’t have Indy sitting on it. She knelt down in front of the chair. “Want some help opening it?” Indy nodded, putting his thumb in his mouth which they noticed seemed to be a nervous habit lately. Pepper ripped a tear in the colorful paper and gestured to Indy. “Here, take this piece and pull.”  He did and managed to pull off a good amount. Pepper and Tony helped clear the rest of the paper. The box was plain white and Pepper took the lid off to reveal a bright blue tissue paper. Indy pulled on the top piece and revealed that underneath was a pair of tiny toddler slippers nestled on top of a fleece blanket.
“We’re all safe together in this room, Peanut. You can hold your llama and me and Bucky are gonna make sure you and Papa and the llama are safe while we nap,” Tony told him.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he said, voice cracking. Bucky nodded at the folder and Tony picked it up  nervously. He read it quietly for a couple minutes.
After that, Indy realized that opening gifts was fun and the rest of the gifts were opened fairly quickly. His favorite seemed to be the little bike with training wheels. It had a small basket attached to the handle bars which he was currently inspecting with great interest.
Tony propped himself up so he could make eye contact with his boyfriend. “I don’t know,” he replied honestly. “Probably?”
“Right here, darling,” Tony replied, sitting half on the arm of the sofa and half on Steve. Steve put his arm around his boyfriend as they watched Bucky place the baby on Indy’s lap and rearrange the boys arms so he was holding her correctly. Then Bucky sat on the other side of Indy, ready to move quick if something happened.
“Relax, its fine. I’m not cold.” Tony believed that because Steve was bundled in sweatpants and a hoodie and ridiculous fuzzy Christmas socks. Steve was flipping through Netflix before finally settling one of the new holiday movies. They watched for a about a half hour before Steve could feel Tony fidgeting and then heard a telltale sniffle. “Hey, you okay?” Tony nodded but didn’t respond otherwise. “Is it the movie?” Steve asked, smiling softly. Tony shook his head then pulled the blanket over his face. Steve paused the movie then wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him, all bundled in his blanket, further onto his lap and tighter against him. Steve kissed the side of his head because that was closest to his face now. “Baby, what’s going on in there? Are you upset about something?” Steve was starting to sound worried now so Tony pulled the blanket away from his face and managed to turn himself over so he was facing Steve’s chest instead of away.
Bucky regained consciousness slowly and uncomfortably, realizing he was laying on a cold cement floor.  He groaned when he tried to readjust his position where they must have dropped him who knows how long ago. There was a weight pressed up against his left side he noticed,  then he heard a sniffle and a whine and quickly blinked his eyes open to check the source.
Bucky chuckled and grabbed the khaki shorts, pulling them on and tucking the shirt in then buttoning them up. “You’re gonna be a great ring-bearer. Your Da and Papa know you can handle the responsibility.”
“I’m right here, sweetheart. Right here,” he whispered, petting Tony’s hair from where he stood near the top of the bed, leaning over so his face was closer to Tony. The nurse removed the bandage from the side of his chest and Tony gasped when it was pulled away and choked back a sob. “I know it hurts, baby. Just hang in there.”
“I know,” Steve agreed. “He needs to cool down but I’ll talk to him, okay? Just give me a chance to do that.” Bucky nodded hesitantly. “Why don’t you go back and have some breakfast, hang out with Indy and I’ll talk to Tony.”
The baby in the cot was young, a few months old maybe, and it looked up at Tony with wide eyes. “Hey Bambino. Not gonna hurt you, I promise,” he whispered. He reached in and picked the baby up realizing that it had no clothes on, just the blanket loosely wrapped around it’s body. He bundled it up tighter and held it to his chest. “Is it a boy or a girl?” Tony asked. The Hydra agent threw him a disbelieving look and didn’t respond. “You really gonna make me check beneath the blanket?” Tony added. Bucky took a step forward so the gun was closer to make his point.
“I didn’t think you did Tony but, honestly, even if you had I don’t see the problem here.” Tony looked at him incredulously, breathing still coming too fast. “Come here, please,” he leaned back, slouching down a little on the sofa and pulled Tony so more of him was covering Steve. “Try to slow you’re breathing okay? In and out, nice and slow.” Tony nodded against him and he could feel him trying.
“Okay,” Steve agreed to keep the peace. “I think someone’s getting a little overwhelmed with all the items in the cart.” He pulled Indy out of his seat and into his arms, sitting him comfortably on his hip. Indy wormed one arm under Steve’s armpit, hugging himself close to his Papa and resting his head on his chest. His other hand still firmly held the T-shirt to his own chest. “Why don’t we let Daddy do his own shopping for a bit, huh? He can get things for himself and we’ll take a little walk around.” He winked at Tony who gave him a thumbs up and Steve knew he would complete the shopping that they needed. “Okay, say bye bye, we’ll see him in a few minutes.”
“Okay. Tony, we should take a moment here,” Steve fidgeted, turning to aim his body more  toward Tony where the other man sat next to him. “We, uh, we never really talked about kids. And now, suddenly, there’s one living with us.” Steve trailed off looking down at where his hand held Tony’s.
Halfway through the battle Steve was pretty sure his heart stopped when his comms crackled with static and then suddenly Tony’s voice rang through loud and clear announcing his location and that he was going to help them finish the fight.
“We can try, sweetheart. We’ll have to find them. Do you know how old the baby was? Like was it very little like your doll?” Steve pointed to the doll now in Bucky’s hands.
“He’s fine,” Tony said with a knowing look to Steve. Indy was likely to be clingy after the morning they went through. The pancakes were just about ready to flip so Tony bent down and picked up Indy. “Do you want to put blueberries or chocolate chips in yours?”
Bucky had worked his way down a long hallway and came to larger room that contained medical equipment and stretchers. He could hear movement from the far corner, though he couldn’t see anyone yet. He silently picked his way through the room til he could see someone with their back to him, a middle-aged woman, wearing a lab coat and laying some medical tools out on a tray.  Next to her was a cot, crib-like, but very medical looking which he assumed held a child. He could see a bundled blanket but not much else.
“We’ll support whatever decision you make. But I know you can do this. And Tony and I will be there for you every step of the way, like you were for us. And hey, we all live in the same place, you got a bunch of built in babysitters. Plus, Indy wanted the baby too, and I don’t want that to weigh on your decision, but just saying, he’ll be a great little helper whether you want it or not.” Steve smiled, clapped his hand on Bucky’s knee then stood up. “I’ll give you some time to yourself, but, if you’re up to it come join us after.”
“Buck,” Steve exclaimed. “Oh thank God.” Steve surged forward causing Tony to bury his head further into the hoodie. Bucky held his hand up to slow Steve.
“‘Kay,” Tony replied softly. He put his head back down onto Steve’s shoulder, facing his neck, and his hands were at Steve’s sides just slightly behind his back holding tightly to his T-shirt in two fists. Steve had one hand on the back of Tony’s neck rubbing his thumb against the short hairs there and the other hand held Tony securely to him. In a ridiculously short amount of time Tony fell asleep and Steve followed soon after with his face buried in Tony’s hair.
“Yeah, but he’s so small. He’s almost 3, but I don’t think he’s going to be a 3 in clothes. Let’s try both.” Steve grabbed a 2T and 3T shirt at random.  He pushed the cart off the main aisle and into the jumble of racks and shelves making sure he was tucked out of the way, though no one was in that section with them. “Okay baby, I have to see which of these fits you. Let’s take this off quick.” He pulled Indy’s shirt off and pulled the 3T over his head. “Uh, Tony. It’s huge on him.” Tony looked over and agreed it was way too baggy, which illustrated even more how underweight he was for his age. The fact that they needed to get him checked out more thoroughly by a doctor went unsaid for the moment but the two men shared a knowing glance. Steve took that shirt off and tried the 2T instead.
“Come in,” he heard the other man reply right away. Steve stepped in and closed the door behind him, walking up to the one of the chairs opposite of Tony’s desk.
“Yeah. Thank’s Bucky. For everything.” Steve stepped forward and hugged him and when they broke apart Bucky started to walk towards Indy’s room. “Don’t forget to hug Tony.” Bucky paused and turned slowly to see Steve’s ear to ear grin.
“Yeah, for you,” Peter said as if he understood. “Look.”  Peter stuck his hand in and pulled out a bright royal blue teddy bear. “It’s a new friend!” Luca’s eyes were wide as he stared at the bear that was almost the size he was. “It’s a Captain America bear.” He showed the boy the small red white and blue picture of the shield on the bears foot.  Luca reached for it, leaning away from Tony to grab the bear, so Tony adjusted the boy on his lap. Peter placed the bear against Luca’s chest and he hugged it instantly. Peter leaned closer and kissed Luca’s forehead then sat back and finally focused on Tony.
“Jesus, Tony. I thought you were asleep.” He rolled onto his side, facing Tony’s back and waited for him to turn. When Tony finally did turn Steve could see his eyes were red and teary. “Why aren’t you sleeping, sweetheart?”
Steve hauled Indy up onto his lap, sitting sideways facing Tony. He kissed him and held him close and Tony leaned in and kissed his forehead then grabbed the forgotten sippy cup off the coffee table and handed it to his son. Indy grasped it and stuck the spout in his mouth right away, drinking greedily. The two men smiled as they watched him calm down. Steve tilted him back a little so he could drink easier and cradled him in his arms like an infant. Tony scooted close so his side was pressed up against Steve’s.
“Almost done,” Steve whispered, keeping a hand on each of them, offering comfort. Natasha managed to cut through the bands around Tony’s legs and waist with some of the tools she and Clint had brought with them and just like that Tony was free.
“Yeah, that’s fine,” Steve agreed. He placed Tony’s bottom on the stretcher then laid him down gently and swinging his feet up onto the bed. He hadn’t let go of Steve yet so Steve was leaning over him stuck. Bruce handed him an extra pillow which Steve tucked next to Tony and which Tony grabbed onto immediately.
Steve smiled. “We’ll go see him when your dressed,” he answered with a laugh. He slid the new one on and put the same pants back on. Then put his Iron Man tee over his head and smoothed back the boys light hair with his hand. He pulled on his hands til he was in a sitting position. “There we go. Ready for lunch?” Indy nodded. He took Steve’s hand and they walked back in the direction of the kitchen. As soon as Tony was in sight Indy let go and ran over, bounding into the mans legs and hugging them. “Indy that’s probably not the best idea to do to someone cooking at the stove,” Steve said as he came up behind them.
“Thank you,” Steve replied sincerely. “Indy. Be good, okay? We’re going to see Daddy and we’ll be back in a little bit.” Indy waved him off so Steve and Bucky headed to the elevator.
“Ready for some soup?” Steve asked as he sat at the counter with Indy on his lap. Indy clapped and nodded. “There’s more soup in the pan if you want some, Buck.”
“I know you’re still decorating his room, so I figured what better to go in there than his Papa and Daddy,” Happy explained. “Right, kiddo?” He ruffled Indy’s hair.
“Exactly,” Steve smiled at him. “I love you.” He kissed Tony’s forehead and Tony knelt up on Steves lap and pressed a sloppy kiss to Steve’s lips. Steve grimaced at the drool he left behind but smiled for Tony.
Rhodey sighed. “I’ll be there in 15. I’m in Jersey but I got the suit with me so I’ll get there quick.” He disconnected. Bucky sat next to Steve. Indy peered over at him through Steve’s arms which were surrounding him. Bucky smiled a little at him. “You okay in there?” He said softly.  Indy nodded and then closed his eyes.
Steve was up first the next morning which was not uncommon. He started the coffee and turned on a some Christmas cartoons for background noise. Bucky was up next with a sleepy baby in his arms.
“Yeah, I think we got it all on the flash drive.” Tony leaned forward and pulled it out of the computer and pocketed it. Steve put the agents hands behind her back and zip-tied them together
“Got the forms to sign right here. Do you still wanna leave? It’s pretty late. You and Indy can sleep the rest of the night here if you want. Bucky and I will stay.”
Tony led Steve back to their bed and helped him get situated. “Do you want anything before you go to sleep? Water? A snack?”
Steve passed by the toy aisles seeing toy cars and action figures and tons of things that he thought might be fun for Indy but he knew he wouldn’t be receptive to them yet. He continued on to the section aimed toward the even younger toddlers and infants. He turned into that area and found some shelves with soft looking stuffed animals, mostly pastels and muted colors.
“He looked so amazed by the table you set with some cheap paper Avengers tableware,” Steve laughed humorlessly. “I want to kill them, Tony.”
It seemed to take ages but the buzzing did in fact stop, yet Tony continued to stare, wondering if he'd get a voicemail or a follow up text. He couldn't say he wasn't curious. 30 seconds later another buzz. A single, deafening buzz to indicate a voicemail. Tony let out the breath he didn't realize he had been holding in a rush. With a shaky hand he picked up the phone, flipped it open and pressed the message icon before he could chicken out.
“He’s in the recovery room right now. When he gets moved to his private room I’ll have a nurse come and get you,” the doctor said.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice sounded so weak and so scared but with a slight hint of something else. Like maybe he was starting to hope that Tony was really okay.
“Come on, Tony. Let’s go see our boy.” They took the elevator to their personal floor and stepped in to the living area. They couldn’t hear or see anyone yet over the back of the sofa that was facing them but as Steve walked around it he noticed Bucky laying out on his side with Indy cuddled in between his body and the back sofa cushion. Indy’s blue anchor blanket was draped over both of them and Indy was suckling nervously on his pacifier, still gripping tightly to Bucky’s shirt.
“Feed him now and once later tonight. Make it count,” she said in a mock friendly voice. They left him alone and Tony tried to rearrange Luca as best he could with one hand.
“Hand him over. I’ll feed him before I put my shirt on.” He took Luca from Steve and sat at the head of the bed leaning against the headboard. Steve went to sit on the other side next to him and slid a pillow under Tony’s arm so he could rest the arm that was supporting Luca. Luca started feeding almost immediately and Tony smiled down at him. “He’s the hungriest little boy I’ve ever seen,” Tony told his husband. Steve laughed and rested his head on Tony’s shoulder, also looking down at Luca.
“Yeah. Yeah, I - I don’t know who I was kidding, I can’t give her up. There’s no choice here. I’m just....scared, I guess.” Bucky stepped around the sofa to look closer at the baby.
“Just wait and see, Munchkin. Baths are comfy and warm and you get all clean and me and Papa get to hang out with you for a bit. All good things.” Tony ruffled his hair. “Maybe tomorrow I can give you a bath with no tears? Think we could try that?” Indy shrugged. Tony booped him on his nose with his finger. “You’ll see, I’ll make it fun.”
“Okay. I’m gonna come meet you. I’m sure he’ll be okay,” Bucky tried to reassure him but it seemed to get him angry.
Bruce cleared his throat, giving Luca one more cursory glance before turning to Steve. “He’s dehydrated and he’s lost some weight. We’ll have to weigh him once we’re back but that is  concerning at this age, however, he’ll be able to get it back fairly quickly, we’ll just have to be careful with how much we introduce right away because his stomach might reject it initially. I’ll prescribe an antibiotic cream for the diaper rash since it’s more severe than it would normally be. Other than that I think he’ll bounce back with no issues.” Steve nodded and let out the breath he’d been holding. Bruce gently picked up the baby who was still naked after disconnecting the now empty IV. “I’m only giving him a little bit of fluid at a time so he’s done for now. Why don’t you try to lay Tony down. I’ll start on him and you can take Luca. I’d say keep the diaper off til we get back and just wrap him in a light blanket. You might get peed on but we need to let some air circulate to help his skin heal.”
“Oh God, Peter.” Steve rushed over to him, pulling him further into the room but spinning him around so he wouldn’t see the TV before it was explained to him. “I didn’t get a chance to call you yet, I’m sorry. Somethings happened.”
“There’s snacks and other drinks in the bag for all of us so help yourselves to anything,” Pepper told them.
“Sweetheart,” Steve sighed. “You are my family. And if you want Indy to be your family too then nothing would make me happier. Honestly. I can’t imagine my life without you now, and Indy’s gonna need you too. I was just trying to make sure that you knew that I wasn’t assuming that you would just step into the role of being a dad with no question. That’s all, I promise.” Steve tugged Tony closer until the brunette was leaning against his side.
“Let’s go to your room, you’re going to lay down and we can talk about all this later.” Tony threw himself on to the floor crying. “Tony,” Steve whispered, exasperated. “Up,” he ordered. Tony didn’t move. Steve reached down to pick him up and Tony kicked his hands away as hard as he could. Steve snatched his hands back quickly.
Tony sat on the floor next to his bed, pieces of the bassinet spread out before him. Indy was laying sideways across the bed so his head was slightly off the side closest to Tony so he could watch.
“Maybe I should have those adoption papers rushed so the kid has someone looking out for his safety,” Tony continued as he brushed past Steve roughly. Steve shoved him away causing Tony to stumble to the side a little.
Steve and Tony looked at each other then dove in to each take a side of Indy’s face and attack him with kisses. Indy giggled hysterically. They stopped when he started gasping and let him calm down. He leaned back against Steve’s chest and Steve ran his fingers through Indy’s hair. “You happy, sweet boy?” Steve asked his son quietly.
“Buppy no. I want, please,” Indy said, ending with a small sob which made Bucky stop to look down at him.
It was past midnight and Steve was sitting in the dark on the sofa watching the livestream. Peter had stayed and after he fell asleep on the sofa Steve carried him to his and Tony’s bed to sleep. Steve refused to leave the living room longer than a few minutes. Tony and Luca had nodded off a couple hours before and Steve honestly felt like they probably both passed out. Even unconscious Tony’s grip on Luca’s body never slackened.
“Pete. Thank you,” Tony said to the teen. “Come here.” Tony stood and held his arms out and Peter jumped up to return the hug. “I’m glad you stopped by and I think Luca loves his bear.”
“Tater Tot, listen up. I have to go get Papa and bring him home, okay? So you’re going to stay here with Bucky.” Tony realized after he’s said it that he didn’t clear that with the man himself but a glance over shows he’s not protesting.
The officiant started the ceremony, reading the traditional vows. They had thought about writing their own but Steve was getting too stressed about finding the right words that explained everything he felt so Tony finally called it, saying he knew what Steve felt and this way they would both vow the same and it would mean just as much.
“It’s not too high, I’m sure she’s fine, Buck. We can ask Bruce if you want to get his opinion,” Steve offered. Bucky nodded right away.
Indy’s eyes narrowed. “Poppy awake,” he said accusingly with a finger pointed at the baby sitting in Bucky’s lap.
Tony came back into Steve’s line of sight to protest. “Nope. You had your turn to make choices with docile me, but now I am fully and completely in my everyday Tony Stark headspace and I want us to continue through the list of all the classic movies you missed while you were frozen. We were up to ‘Mrs. Doubtfire.’”
“We should go have Bruce check you out,” Steve replied, already standing and holding a hand out to help Tony up. Tony took it but was already shaking his head again.
He returned a couple minutes later. “I found these and rinsed one.” He handed Tony an aqua colored pacifier that had a light green dinosaur on it and placed the other one still in the package on the coffee table. Tony placed the nipple on her lips and waited for her to open to it. She did so almost immediately and he slid it in to her mouth easily. She began suckling right away but suddenly blinked her eyes open at the new sensation. Steve leaned into Tony so he could rub her back hoping to lull her back to sleep. “Shh, it’s okay,” he kept repeating. She blinked at Steve and then over at Tony, seemingly confused by having something in her mouth. They both laughed.
“I Love Da,” the boy replied, squirming when Steve tried to pull him back. “Stay, Papa,” Indy protested.
“Here. For now you can have this.” He put Tony’s arms through the sleeves then pulled him off Steve’s lap to stand while Bucky zipped him up. The hoodie was down to Tony’s ankles. He put the boy back on Steve then stood. “I need to clean up his leg. He got cut and I wrapped a sock around it but it needs to be cleaned and bandaged.”
“Wait, Buck,” Steve spoke up. “Can you, I mean if you don’t mind, can you stay in here? It just, it feels safer with us all together. I know its dumb,” Steve trailed off. Both Bucky and Tony started to disagree with that statement but Tony let Bucky take it since it was aimed at him.
“No, no, Tony, calm down, that’s not what I’m saying,” Steve rubbed circles on Tony’s back trying to soothe him.
45 minutes later a doctor came in to tell them that the surgery was complete. They were able to repair the damage to his chest and there were no complications but he wasn’t out of the woods because they would have to see how the area around the reactor healed.
“My ah-ma,” Indy screeched from Bucky’s lap, pointing to the now soaking wet plush still in a puddle of coffee. It’s tan fur turning a dark brown where the fluid seeped in. Steve all but lunged for it, hoping to quell Indy’s cries but it really wasn’t looking good. He rang out the excess liquid on to the table but more than half the llama was stained. “Pa,” Indy sobbed. “Ah-ma broke.” Bucky rubbed the boys back.
“So, we’re a family? All three of us?” Tony asked, and Steve wished that he could find a way to rid Tony of his deep-seated insecurities.
“Well, no one’s forcing you to stay with me, Tony!” Steve snapped. “If I’m so awful then I shouldn’t be your boyfriend.” Tony stumbled back as if he’d been physically hit and Steve let out a small gasp at the realization of what he said. “I’m not leaving you,” he blurted out quickly. “We’re not breaking up,” he added. Tony shook his head, sitting on the stool at the work table. Tony was looking down at his lap and Steve couldn’t tell if he was crying or not. “Tony?” He walked over to the other man and put his hands on his shoulders. He didn’t get an answer. “We  let this fight go too far, sweetheart. We both said things we didn’t mean, but I’m sorry.” He pulled Tony to him and brought his arms around Tonys back to hug him but Tony started to struggle. Steve loosened his hold but didn’t let go. “I love you, Tony.”
“Thank you,” Steve replied. “That means a lot. We’ve tried our best obviously, though we’re clearly out of our depth with whatever he’s been through.”
“I’ll read you a story, come on,” Steve said before there were any other protests. “Then Daddy and Bucky and the baby can come in and say goodnight, okay?” Indy nodded reluctantly, clearly the Santa threat was working its magic. Steve stood and brought Indy to his bedroom while Tony and Bucky remained on the sofa.
Tony was beyond grateful when it was off and he brought his hand up to cradle Luca along with Steve’s.
-Tony, I don't know if you're going to listen to my message, and that's okay, but I just wanted to add that regardless of your decision to help I would like to talk to you. I need to apologize.-
"Geez, the manners on you," he said smiling, attempting a bit of humor and hoping he didn't cross a line. He scooped more into Tony's bowl. "And don't think I missed that language you used a minute ago. No one here scolding you for that, huh?"
“Not because of today though, Steve,” Tony hurried to add. “I don’t think he wanted to hurt me. I don’t think he’s gonna have this issue growing up. He knows right from wrong, he’s just a toddler.” Tony paused. “But, he was with Hydra for almost 3 years. So, for that? Yeah, he should probably have someone that can work that out with him. We’re certainly not qualified, though I think he’s doing really well with us.”
“I just told him it was nap time and he refused. I told him if he wanted to stay on the sofa he could but he had to at least try and rest and he started crying.” Tony buried his head in Steve’s neck, sobbing. Clint waved his hand as if to illustrate his point. “I picked him up off the sofa and stood him up so we could go to the bedroom but he pulled himself away from me and started swinging at me and kicking. I yelled at him to stop and that I was going to tell you how he behaved which made him more angry and then he grabbed that award Stark Industries got,” Clint nodded in the direction of a very heavy looking award laying in the midst of glass. “I tried to grab it but he chucked it at the end table which shattered the glass top, hence the mess.” He spread his hands out, shrugging.
“I’ll get him,” Tony said suddenly exiting the room. Steve knew it was more to get away from Bucky then enthusiasm over Bucky being with Indy but Steve was grateful at least that he wasn’t arguing against it.
“Well, he seems really comfortable with you. At least he trusts us and knows who we are to a point. This would have been harder otherwise.”
“Sweetheart. You need to rest. Get some sleep, I’ll be right here.” Steve kissed him again then pulled a chair next to the bedside that Indy was on and sat down.
“I don’t even wanna think about that,” Tony sighed. “Let’s hope there’s something that tells us she was at the same facility as Indy so we’ll know for sure. I hope these were the only two kids and that we have them now and that’ll be it.”
Indy shrugged, spitting out the pacifier. “Pa and Da and Buppy,” he said, pointing at the them as he said it.
“Can you say hi to Uncle Bruce, Buddy?” Steve asked as he picked Indy up off of Bucky’s lap. Indy curled into Steve shyly and waved. “Can you use your words?” Steve added. “Bruce is a friend.”
A few seconds passed and Jarvis spoke again. “He said he has a gift for the baby and he’ll be really quick.” Steve stood quickly, looked once more at Tony whose eyes were still closed, and went to the door. He pulled it open and Peter stood there all smiles with a gift bag in his hand.
“That was the plan but I have one more late meeting now. I’ll have to leave in the morning instead so I should be home around noon.” Tony didn’t look happy at this development.
They arrived at the location, an abandoned industrial building in the middle of nowhere, that Coulson drove them to with Steve in the passenger seat and Natasha and Clint in the back with Graves cuffed between them.
“Bucky is right, buddy. Santa would know what to bring a baby but you can always help her out with a list too. We can do hers after yours okay? And I’ll help you write her name on it,” Steve placated. Indy nodded, satisfied and shot Bucky a look that screamed ‘I told you so’ even without saying a word.
“Then by the power vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may now seal your marriage vows with a kiss.”
“Look, I’m the last person to be advising someone about therapy or not. God knows I need it and will probably never get it, but for him, he’s so little and he went through hell so yeah, he should keep going. And maybe it won’t always be this hard. Maybe that’s the point. Maybe it’ll get easier.” He shrugged.
Bucky's smile fell and he suddenly became very aware that he probably crossed a line. "Um, I'm sorry, I was just...I didn't, Tony I'm so sorry," Bucky stammered.
“You look cute,” Steve said wistfully. Tony rolled his eyes but Steve caught the small smile before he dipped his head to Steve’s chest. He cupped the back of Tony’s head with one hand and brought the other to Tony’s waist. “I don’t want to fight with you, but I do think it’s time we readdress the milk situation.”
“You need a full bath today, buddy. You’ll be fine.” He started to unzip the one piece bodysuit pajamas and made it to his waist before he started to cry. “I know, it’s okay,” Steve soothed as he pulled Indy’s arms out of the sleeves one at a time. “You can have your duckies in the water with you,” he offered. The ducks had been a purchase Tony made. A four pack of small multi colored rubber ducks that Indy loved but that still didn’t make bath time something he wanted. JARVIS started to fill the tub with warm water and Steve loved him for it.
“We’re going to have our friends over today to celebrate your birthday! Remember Papa and I told you about that? Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Pepper, Happy and Bucky. They’re all coming to see you and celebrate.” Tony clapped his hands like Indy does so he’d know it was something exciting.
“That shouldn’t be your problem to deal with,” Bucky called from where he walked into the room behind them, but he offered a sheepish smile.
“You see all the big buildings, baby? And the trees, and people.” Indy pointed, looked at Steve, then back out the window. Steve chuckled. “Lot’s going on out there, huh?”
He walked into the nursery with the bottled water he had gone to get for Tony. He found him where he had left him, in the rocking chair in the nursery. Now their son was against his chest, head on Tony’s shoulder. He had finished feeding and Tony was trying to coax a burp out of him. “Come on, bambino. I’m trying to help you out here,” he whispered.
"This isn't going to be finished today, probably not tomorrow either so you might want to stay. Steve's still got rooms here. Whatever was there before is still there so you probably have what you would need..." Tony didn't make eye contact but Steve was shocked.
Indy nodded and then cuddled into Tony’s side. Then got up and knelt on Tonys lap to be able to face him. “Still Da,” he said, patting Tony’s chest over the arc reactor. “Forever.”
“Hey,” Tony called back behind him. Bucky looked at him as he stood by anxiously waiting for Tony to move out of the way so he could get off the Quinjet and start searching the latest Hydra facility they had located. “Keep your comms on. You see anything at all you tell us immediately, got it?”
"I told Steve to go back for you, once we got back to the jet. He said your suit could call someone if you needed help. Is that true?"
“Here,” Steve said as he got a piece of the yellow cake onto a fork and held it in front of his son. “Try the cake part, too.” He seemed to like all of it. They gave him a very small piece since he wasn’t used to so much sugar and cake was new for him.
When Bucky returned an hour later with Poppy in his arms and Indy in tow, Tony was sound asleep but Steve looked over when they walked in the room.
“Anthony Edward Stark you do not hit people,” voice rising in anger. Tony tried to storm off again. “No, hey,” Steve grabbed his arm gently but firmly to stop him. Tony cried harder, gasping and choking on his breath.  “You need to calm down, you’re going to make yourself sick,” Steve reasoned. “Tell me what’s wrong, sweetheart.”
“I can’t lose him, Buck,” Steve murmured. He reached out and pulled Indy on to his own lap and kissed the top of his head.
“Okay, shh, let’s not get upset again,” Steve comforted. He looked over to Tony who had sat on the edge of the bed watching him. “Tony, do you think you’d mind if he slept with us tonight?” Steve asked hesitantly.
“I can read the book to you,” Bucky offered. “If your Papa doesn’t mind.” Indy patted Bucky’s shoulder where his hand had been resting.
“Yeah, yes, everything’s fine. Promise,” he assured him quickly as they sat side by side on the sofa. “Actually that’s kind of what I wanted to ask you. You ran off quick and I can tell by now when somethings bothering you. What is it?”
“JARVIS, let us know if he gets off that chair? Come on, let’s go into our room for a sec,” Tony said. He pushed Steve gently with a hand on his back. Once they shut the door behind them Steve slumped.
“Okay,” Bucky replied. “I’ll just stay out of his way for awhile, but if he want’s me to go, Steve, I will.” Steve nodded.
“Da,” he said, looking at Bucky like he couldn’t believe he didn’t know. Bucky bit back his laugh but Tony didn’t.
“Tony,” Steve muttered and reached out. Tony stepped closed and Steve was pulling at his shirt so Tony leaned in to hug him. Tony turned his head and kissed Steve’s neck and Steve cried harder. Tony tried to stand up but Steve held on.
“Indy,” Steve said breathlessly. He was still having a hard time believing both Tony and his son were okay. The boy looked over.
“No, he’s good. I’ll let him nap here,” Tony answered, arm tightening around the boy. Steve smiled and kissed Tony’s cheek.
Tony tried to pull away instantly but Steve held on, though he loosened his hold. “Steve, stop,” Tony choked out.
“He’s okay, Tater Tot. Uncle Bruce is helping Papa get better. This isn’t bad, it’s safe.” Indy grunted and whined as he pulled on Tony’s grip but Tony wouldn’t let go until Bruce was completely finished.
The nurse finished up and added the promised pain meds to Tony’s IV which calmed him down enough to relax back into Steve when he resumed his place on the bed.
Steve entered Indy’s room and Indy was still asleep under his blanket curled around his new stuffed reindeer. He sat on the edge of the bed and ran his hand up and down his sons back hoping to wake him gently. When he started to stir Steve said “Good morning, sweetheart. Merry Christmas.”
The four Avengers took the elevator down to the lobby, Clint splitting away from them once the doors opened. Steve froze at the sight of his old friend standing calmly near the security guards desk waiting. Tony pushed forward.
“He’ll be more worried not seeing you. I’m honestly surprised he hasn’t broken away from Bucky and Clint and stormed the room yet.” Tony smiled at him but Steve still looked unsure. “It’s been a rough few days for him, sweetheart. He hasn’t really slept, he kept asking for you. He needs to see your okay.”
“You ready to talk to us?” Steve asked with his hands on his hips. Tony sat on the sofa but smirked to himself at Steve’s Captain America stance.  Indy just nodded. “Good, come on.” Steve held his hand out for Indy to take and they sat on the sofa next to Tony, Indy in the middle. “Do you know why you had to have a timeout?”
“You okay?” Tony nodded and hummed noncommittally. Bucky was still staring at him. He clearly didn’t believe that but Tony looked away.
"This is a start," Bucky encouraged. "It's good." Tony smiled and went back to the arm. Bucky saw Steve looking at him and knew he caught the tail end of that conversation with his serum enhanced hearing. Bucky winked. Steve smiled softly and went back to his lunch.
Steve nodded and then briefly explained to Bucky what happened with Indy. Bucky was apologetic and blaming himself for leaving Tony to care for the baby full time.
“He was sick in his bed,” Steve told Bucky. “It was on his chest, I just thought a warm bath would clean him and make him feel better but obviously not and now he’s just making himself worse,” Steve said frantically.
“I don’t know,” he sighed. “This is crazy, Tony. I don’t even know what to think.” He leaned forward and Tony brought his arms up to pull Steve in right away. Steve rested his head on Tony’s shoulder.
“You said in the workshop the other day that you wanted this. Wanted this with me,” he stressed. Tony looked up quickly.
“That would be great, thanks Buck. Indy, sit up.” He pulled Indy to a sitting position but Indy instinctively reached out for Tony nudging him in the process and earning a pained gasp from Tony.  “Indy,” Steve snapped, grabbing the boys hand before he did damage. “Gentle, remember? You okay?” Tony nodded but Steve could tell it hurt him. “Go with Bucky just for a little while and have a nice dinner then you can come back.”
“Adopt him, Tony,” Steve stepped forward, closing in the space Tony was making between them. “You’re already his dad but let’s make it official now. We got all my paperwork done, now it’s your turn.” Tony was shaking his head. “No,” Steve said before Tony could refute what he was saying. “I know you want this, you essentially just said as much. We’re in this together forever, Tony. I want you to have the same claim to him as I do.”
“He has a name,” Steve replied with a frown. “I don’t think I could change it now. It’s the only thing he has that didn’t have to do with Hydra. Plus, I kind of like that Bucky gave it to him.”
"Because everything in me is screaming right now to get away from you because you're trying to kill me," Tony snapped. "And while I know that that's not what's happening at this moment it doesn't matter. I am two seconds from walking out on both of you so if you want this done you will get out of my sight."
-Now that you need something? Tony asked, getting angrier by the text. There was a longer wait this time for the next text.
“We need all the files you have on her,” Bucky said. “You can make it easy and I don’t kill you right here or we’ll get them with out you after I get rid of your body.” Something in the way he looked at her made her realize there was no point in resisting. Bucky still had his gun trained on her so Tony stepped up beside them to look over her shoulder, making sure she actually gave them relevant files.
“Up for babysitting duty? It seems Cap and I have a certain event to plan for a certain little boy who shall remain nameless.” Steve smirked and Bucky looked shocked.
“Indiana. We are leaving. Now,” he said angrily. He grabbed Indy by the forearm as gently as he could but still all but dragging him to the car. Indy started to cry, kicking out in anger.
“My pants,” Steve mumbled and Tony looked back down to where he had touched but didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. Until Steve sat up straight and moved his hands and then Tony could see the wet patch over his crotch. “I don’t know what happened. I didn’t know I had to go.” Steve looked wrecked and Tony felt awful for him.
“Come here, you,” he pulled him out of Steve’s lap and against his chest, kissing his cheek. “You’re very welcome.”
Steve sighed. “You sure did. And you’re going to be punished for that.” Tony looked up at him sharply. “But,” Steve continued quickly, “You’re not going to get hit or spanked. Just a time out.” Steve stood up with Tony in his arms bringing him to the corner of the living area where there was a comfy wing chair in a small sitting area. He turned the chair a little so it was angled toward the wall. “All right, Tony.” He sat the boy on the chair. “I want you to sit here for 5 minutes because what you did was unacceptable and you can’t get away with behavior like that without consequences. You’re not bad, but you weren’t acting like the good boy I know you are.” Tony was leaning forward toward Steve who was crouched in front of the chair and it took all Steve’s willpower to not scoop him up again.  He put his hands on Tony’s shoulders and pushed him up straight again. “I want you to think about how you acted today. Breaking things, yelling, hitting. I never want to see you act like that again, so think about that and I’ll be back in 5 minutes.” He stood up quickly before changing his mind.
“Yeah, that’s for you to learn how to use the bathroom like a big boy,” Tony said happily, but Indy looked anything but happy.
“Don’t do this, please. I can’t leave him, Tony. Or you. Please,” Steve begged, with tears in his own eyes now. Tony closed his eyes again. Steve shuffled closer so Tony’s knees were pressed against Steve’s chest. “You can keep holding him okay? I promise. And I’m sorry. Please, Tony, answer me. I can’t lose you.” Steve set his hand on Tony’s knee and watched as his husband flinched.
Happy arrived not long after and came in to the room with Poppy in his arms and a diaper bag over his shoulder. Bucky stood up and approached him. “There’s my baby girl.” Happy handed her over. She started crying right away. “Hey, what’s wrong?” He bounced her gently and rubbed her back as she gripped his shirt. “You’re okay, baby.”
“Yeah, Tony. When we said home, we meant our home, not your home with your mom and dad. Where me and Bucky and Natasha and Clint live. And you. You live here with us,” Steve told him. He knew his memories must be mixed up, he knew who they were but seemed to expect that the Avengers would be dropping him off with his parents. He didn’t want to have that conversation with a four year old, but he also wanted to tell him enough that he might somewhat understand what was actually happening here.
Tony pulled a navy blue sweater over his head, messing up his hair. Steve stepped up and ran a hand through it. “I like when your hair is fluffy.”
“Look,” Tony started with no preamble. “I feel like a hypocrite using you as a babysitter all the time but Steve is upset suddenly and I don’t know why and I need to talk to him alone. Can you sit with Indy?”
Another update! It’s not too long but hey, its an update. They’ll be a Christmas Day one too! Coming soon ;)
“So I came in here to find my son Indy but all I see is this small animal.” Tony crouched down in front of him. “What are you, a squirrel?”
“Fuck you,” Steve spat and Tony winced. “You can be mad at Bucky or me or whoever the hell you want but you don’t get to be this much of an asshole.” Steve stood there breathing heavily for a moment. “You were right we shouldn’t have had this conversation,” he added as he turned to leave the workshop.
“That’s okay. Either way I’m just glad we found her. She can be safe now. Indy will be thrilled,” he said smiling up at Tony. Steve’s phone beeped and he pulled it out quickly. “It’s Fury, I have to update him.” Steve stepped to the other side of the jet as Clint and Natasha came back.
“So, this is a drink that’s good for winter because it’s nice and warm, but with the candy cane it’s perfect for Christmas.” Indy smooshed his cheek against Steve’s shoulder as he pushed closer so Steve picked him up and put him on his lap instead. “First we put some marshmallows on top.” Steve showed him but grabbing a handful and dropping some in each of the adults mugs. “You wanna put some in yours?”
“Our kid is 3 today,” Tony told him, with a sort of awe in his voice, causing Steve to blink his eyes open again to look at his boyfriend. “We have a kid, and it’s his birthday, and I just -  I don’t know. It’s a lot.”
Steve knelt beside the chair. “Hey, sweetheart, it’s all right. It’s over.” He grasped the back of Tony’ neck with his hand gently, grounding him. “I’ve got you. Got you both.” He leaned forward kissing Tony’s forehead and then the top of Luca’s head. His other hand rubbed the boys belly while he continued whispering to Tony. Clint was behind the chair with Natasha trying to find a way to cut him out of it.
He entered the kitchen and set about cutting up some fruit and making French toast from scratch.  Once completed he went back to his room to wake Tony up.
“We can’t hear you if you hide like that,” Bucky told him. Tony pulled his head up and looked back at Clint.
“Buppy do,” Indy said, suddenly turning around with one of the puzzles and putting it on Bucky’s lap. Bucky looked to Steve who shrugged.
“I’m fine,” Tony said, muffled into Steve’s shirt. Steve hummed a small sound because he doesn’t agree but doesn’t want to start an argument. “I should take a shower actually. I put on clean clothes but I still feel gross.” Tony pulls away and Steve lets him even though the point was for them to spend time together. At least he’s doing something to take care of himself.
“Thank you,” he whispered sincerely.  He sent a text to Fury that Bucky was coming in place of him and then forwarded Fury’s location text to Barnes. “Just, be careful. And don’t let Fury order you around. You don’t work for Shield and you don’t even work for the Avengers so do what you think is right. All that matters is bringing Steve home.”
“Well, that’s nice to hear. Thank you, Bubba. You know I love you. But you need to say you’re sorry for what you did and how you acted. And I think Clint needs an apology too.”  He rubbed his hand soothingly up and down Tony’s arm as he held him in place on the counter.
“Me? You’re the one acting Iike you’ve raised a bunch of kids before. You sure you haven’t?” Steve laughed. Bucky shrugged again but looked embarrassed.
Steve was still for a few minutes but then started tossing and turning. Tony thought maybe he was having a nightmare but when he looked Steve’s eyes were open. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
Tony was shaking his head and pulling his hand out of Steves grip. “You don’t want me to be a part of his life like that?” Tony’s breath hitched on the question. “I mean, I know I’m not exactly great parent material. I never thought I’d have kids but I love him, Steve. It’s only been a few days and I love him. If you don’t want me to see him, um,” Tony choked on his words, gasping as his anxiety rose.
“Tony, try and calm down before you talk to him. He’s gonna be fine when you tell him you’ll always be his dad,” Steve said, the baby now sleeping in his arms.
“Thanks,” Steve told him sincerely. He pulled Indy from his shoulder placing him gently on the car seat. “There ya go, baby.” Tony leaned over Steve from behind him to see in the car.
“I broke the table,” Tony said, looking off to the side where the shattered glass still littered the area.
“You wanna say good night to Poppy? Tell her to sleep so Santa comes?” Bucky asked. He sat the baby on the bed next to Indy and kept his hands on her so she stayed upright.
Ignoring that, JARVIS continued. “He has a small child with him as well.” Steve was off the sofa before anyone else even thought about moving.
“I know I don’t have to. You’re hurt and I want to help. Come on.” Steve complied and Tony got some more wipes. Whoever stripped him down when he arrived at the Shield hospital must have done a perfunctory cleaning because Tony certainly expected worse, but he definitely needed some care. He managed to get him clean using a lot of wipes and the promise of a bath when they got home. He sat Steve up again and grabbed the sweats.
Bucky brought her to his room, closing the door softly behind him. He laid her in the bassinet  that was next to his bed and she whined and waved her arms in protest.
Bucky passed Tony on the way out of the room and Tony dropped himself back on to the sofa. Steve joined him and pulled him over so Tony was leaning against his chest. “He’s really worried,” Steve murmured.
“Are you trying to get me to hurt you Tony?” Steve asked frantically. “Is that what your dad did? Did Howard hurt you when you did something wrong?” Steve paused, taking a breath as Tony continued his tantrum. “I’m not going to, Tony,” he stated firmly, willing the small boy to believe it. “I will never hurt you, so if you’re testing me you can stop.”
“He’s sick, Steve. He didn’t eat enough, he’s lost weight I can tell, and he has a rash and he’s-,” Tony choked on a sob. Then, just realizing that he didn’t have to follow his captors rules anymore, and so quickly that Steve barely had time to react, Tony started maneuvering Luca with his free arm. Steve put both hands out to help.
“He’s going to need his diaper changed too,” Tony added hesitantly.  The woman glared at him but left the room and returned a minute later with one pack of diapers.
"Well, maybe you were right. It would be nice to move on, say what we need to say whatever the outcome...it's just hard to start..." he trailed off.
Pepper and Rhodey joined them, sitting across from the two men. They all tried to make small talk to pass the time even though no one was up to it. Pepper offered to take Indy to the gift shop after about an hour and Rhodey accompanied them. He came back, arms loaded with goodies. Once he could see his Papa and Bucky he toddled over to them as quick as he could with his arms full.
“I promised her she wouldn’t be hurt anymore,” Bucky said as if Steve hadn’t spoken. Tony stood and walked over to Bucky before he started to disassociate. He put his hand on Bucky’s shoulder and the other on the arm that cradled Poppy.
“It is,” Bucky exclaimed. “I did this and Tony’s never going to see anything but that when he looks at me now. And I don’t blame him.”
“Uh oh,” Steve said. “What did your Da do? I bet he went overboard with it, whatever it was,” Steve said in a happy voice but with a look to Tony. Tony laughed.
Tony held his hand up as he spoke, "I just can't listen to whatever you have to say right now. I can't. This -you being here," he gestured around him randomly. "It's too much right now...I can't listen to you pretend to feel bad about what you did so what do you want from me?"
Tony wasn’t sure how much time passed but Luca had fallen asleep after eating and now calmly rested in his dads arms. The door opened and the two kidnappers walked in, the woman striding purposefully over to Tony, who tightened his hold on Luca.
They all laughed. “You can put your llama in there, sure,” Tony replied. “Why don’t you try it out?” Indy ran to his room to get his stuffed llama then ran back. He carefully placed the llama in the basket then sat on the bike and pushed himself around with his feet, not quite getting the hang of the pedals yet. Bucky stood up to walk with him around the living room and tried to teach him how to pedal and steer.
“Sorry, Da. Sorry, please?” Indy knelt on his sofa cushion between the two men facing Tony hopefully.
Steve finished his call and came back to sit next to Tony. “How is she? She looks very interested in you,” Steve laughed. The baby was staring at Tony’s face, one hand tapping his cheek and one holding his ear. Tony smirked.
“And the kid?” Tony persisted, nodding at him. Bucky made eye contact for a second, sighed, and then reached down to his backpack which was beside his chair on the floor. He pulled out a file folder and slid it in front of Tony.
Bucky shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. I’m sure its not permanent but you are really good with him. You’re a natural.”
“No leave,” he pleaded, screaming. “No, please, Da.” The two men startled at the outburst, having not seen him react that way to anything in their time with him. Bucky had his hands under the kids arms ready to take him but at that he let go and allowed Tony to keep hold.
“Yeah, that’s right,” Tony exclaimed excitedly. “We’re going to get you so much stuff.” Tony pulled on the bottom of Indy’s shirt. “We’re going to get you all new clothes, some toys, some books, some stuff for your room.” Tony turned toward Steve. “We need a whole kids bedroom set for him right?”
Bucky sighed. “Thank you so much, you saved the day today. I was actually wondering if you wanted to bring her here? Tony wants to see her and then you can see him too.”
“Let me know if you need me to take a look at him,” Bruce said to Tony, a hand on his shoulder, before leaving the room.
“FRIDAY, what was that!” she shouted, popping her faceplate up and glaring at the gaping hole in the side of Spider-Man’s building.
like he was approaching a frightened animal, “are you referring to Sergeant Barnes or...Captain Rogers?”
Toni opened her mouth to answer, something nagging at the back of her mind, something dancing on the tip of her tongue, just out of reach.
Then there were the kids. After the first time she’d been left alone with them, Laura, for whatever reason, apparently deemed her responsible enough to take care of them, even Nathaniel, whenever she needed to run errands or leave the house. While Laura cooked Toni helped bathe the baby in his little boat-shaped basin. While Laura showered, Toni supervised Coop’s woodwork outside, and sometimes he even asked her opinion on his different pieces. Knowing next to nothing about modern art, she promptly replied that she’d buy a few of his structures to put around the compound and he had
. Toni gazed at her and wondered whether, if her father had only been proud of his daughter rather than envious, if her mother had spent more time with her, time that Toni had yearned for because she loved her so much, if Ana had taken her away to her country more often, if Peggy had put her above SHIELD, if Jarvis hadn’t died when she’d needed him most, if her parents hadn’t been murdered by the Winter Soldier...if she would’ve ended up like Shuri. Loved. A genius nurtured rather than secreted away because she couldn’t be cleverer than Howard. If she would’ve ended up
Hope chuckled self-deprecatingly. “Yeah. I wasn’t angry at you,” she admitted. “I mean I guess I was a little but...when I read the Accords I knew why you signed them. And seeing everything you guys did about the Accords
“You’ll get Ant-Man too,” she said, and there was a note of stubbornness in her voice. “Once you get him back.” And that wasn’t a request.
“Okay, thaaat might be stretching it,” she murmured, touched nonetheless by Coulson’s level of faith in her, however exaggerated. “Nat, on the other hand…”
Rhodey was on screen now, frowning and unamused. “There’s no such thing as a new team or an old team. Look. You’ve heard our stance during the UN talks; we’re working to bring the rest of our team
According to Laura it was the only time the kids actually deliberately stayed behind to help clean up and Toni was touched, even if it only made it harder to say goodnight to them later. Afterwards, they’d gone into their respective bedrooms, all save for Toni, who lingered downstairs, letting her eyes rove over each room, trying to memorize as much as she could. Upstairs, she had pressed her hand against the kids’ doors, then Laura’s, then padded downstairs and walked outside barefoot into the breezy summer night air.
For a moment she could almost imagine that Jarvis was behind her on a cool April night, showing her worlds beyond her most fantastical dreams.
“You’re here,” she cried frantically into his neck. “You’re here, I can’t believe you’re here, how are you
Toni backed down first, nodding in an approximation of understanding, the most that she could provide to him at this point.
, in his home? Wakanda was still so new to the rest of the world and people didn’t trust what they didn’t know. She didn’t want them to have one more reason-
This is what people did, didn’t they? Rich people, traumatized people, people who hated themselves, people who hated being around other people. They moved to the country, to nature, to
Toni couldn’t help but grin as Lila, who had tried to jump across the foam pit to the opposite ledge, fell several feet short only for Harley to catch her and carry her to her destination.
With a sharp hiss that was more devastation than disgust, she tore her hand back and hastily stood, sending her stool rolling away, where it crashed into a machine, making them both flinch.
So, we're finally moving forward a little in this chapter. Just a little. And there's some plottiness happening but again, nothing profound yet. Still, I do hope you enjoy this chapter, and I promise that things will start kicking up to speed soon.
Steve saw the screen flicker, then Shuri’s easy grin appeared, the familiar white walls and blue screens of her lab behind her.
Peter Parker - Spider-Man - was indeed under the jungle gym, nestled in the shadow of a miniature bridge and slide, wearing what looked to be a hooded vest over a blue one-piece pajama suit and through his worried exasperation at the boy, he came to understand Toni Stark in that moment, and the evident fondness she’d come to develop for him.
Wanda’s face was expressionless but she nodded and curled up in a chair in the corner of the room, scarlet flickering around her fingers. She’d been different ever since the Raft and Steve had been horrified at the state he’d found her in. He knew it had been Ross because Toni would never have let something like that happen to Wanda and sometimes he wondered, if Clint hadn't gone to the Compound, if Wanda hadn't left, if maybe she would've been safe-
“Sisipho Itobo,” T’Challa declared triumphantly as he glided into the meeting room, arms open wide in exaltation. “The newly-appointed Panel Head of Wakanda.”
consisted of a dentist’s seat, which Toni had promptly scrapped and replaced with a more comfortable lazy boy chair because she doubted Barnes would appreciate the HYDRA parallels, however unintended; a bunch of screens would help her monitor and record Barnes’ vitals and brain patterns, and rather than a pair of glasses, she and Vision were creating a streamline dome that hovered over the circular space surrounding Barnes’ chair, which would both tap into Barnes’ memories and project them around him so he could literally immerse himself in it.
in those precious moments of almost-happiness. The corner of her mouth quirked up. “Mind giving me the grand tour?”
At that point she didn’t see Barnes. Just a man who needed something that she could provide and provide
gotten used to it. Had gotten used to having Toni around. Apparently enough for her to fall asleep with the other woman. Sometimes, when Nat visited, they’d stay up late talking and fall asleep just like this, facing one another or with their backs touching.
She’d been there for Toni when the Avengers had fallen apart and Toni was unspeakably grateful to have her here when they were trying to put them back together again.
To say he was...anxious about being in such close proximity with Antonia Stark was both an understatement and yet not entirely accurate.
She counted his footsteps as she made his way towards her, feeling somewhat disconcerted by his very
“There were other forces in play.” Nat moved closer os their legs aligned, knee to ankle. Nat’s legs were unfairly longer, though. “We couldn’t have stopped them no matter what we did. It was all…”
Stark had blasted off HYDRA’s arm in a tempest of fury and pain and now she was about to remove the physical pieces -
Shit is starting to go down. I hope Toni's brief foray into madness wasn't confusing for you? It worked in my head but, well.
person of all of them who deserved it. Rhodey had the most reason to be angry, to be resentful of the way things had turned out because Rhodey had always been so good,
“-free reign of the Compound as usual. Hill’s on the other side with the new recruits. Agent Fern, former SHIELD as I’m sure you’ll remember, is her second in command. She’s good. And Hill is Hill, so.”
“Noted,” Natasha replied. “We’ll keep this close to the chest until a formal contract has been issued. And Toni,” she said, genteling her tone, “don’t worry. We’ll find him.”
“I mean, is it nanites?” she muttered, using her kimoyo bracelet to scan it and getting some very strange, very
“You won’t,” Steve reassured her, feeling a headache creeping up the back of his neck and fatigue settling deeply into his bones. “I swear, Toni, you won’t. We’ll all be quiet. We just wanna watch. Just to make sure—” He cut himself off, immediately realizing his mistake.
Sean Chang, her PR manager and Pepper’s second-favorite person in the world after Shanthi, always seemed to be awake and forwarded videos and talks they were going to be running over the next few weeks before and after the hearing.
“They either wanted to be noticed or this was a diversion for something else. FRIDAY’s on it but so far there’s nothing out of the ordinary on any news channel,” Toni sighed.
“Yes,” she responded almost instantaneously, because now that they’d laid the risks out for the world to see how could they
Toni was still trying to grapple with the fact that Harley was at her front door with a possibly enhanced, most definitely in pain girl, who looked like she was either going to pass out or dissolve into the ground, to admonish Peter for both language and lack of tact. You don’t just
Wanda sent him a brief smile, then turned back to the TV. Sam had opted to cook tonight and Scott was helping him. The sound of them moving around the kitchen, snarking at one another, made him think of another kitchen at a time that felt so long ago but was really only
They gave her identical beaming looks and Kamala groaned at Harley’s side, dangerously close to falling to the floor until Toni skidded over and took her other arm - the one with the seriously heavy
The elevator pinged and they ran out again, heading to the same lab she and Shuri fixed up Peter in the first time.
He huffed in amusement. “I’d argue with you about the international fugitive part but I don’t wanna fight when you’ve only just got here.”
Bucky was stronger than him. Always had been. Always knew when to pull Steve from a fight and when to join in and when to smack the back of his head for being an idiot. Always knew when to challenge him so he could be
before she left the hall earlier; she could tell by the gritty sound of his voice. “Neither the Panel nor the Subcommittee members were made aware of this so I took it upon myself to inform those that had been appointed so far.”
“Yeah,” he agreed. “You think I’d be used to it. I’ve been taking care of that girl since MIT. S’a long time.”
“I saw,” Toni agreed, feeling restless with the kind of anticipation that always preceded a new project. “He’s been working out a way to miniaturize the tech so we can implement it alongside all the other barriers without compromising on the ionic structure.”
“Team’s broken, Steve” Sam said, but not unkindly. “It’s fractured, everybody’s a mess. One of our own is down for the count at least for the foreseeable future.” Steve winced at the mention of Rhodey. “And from what the news is telling us-” He watched Steve carefully as he spoke. “-Toni hasn’t been seen since she made that public apology about Leipzig and Bucharest.”
“Nice work,” Rhodey snapped professionally as they were coming up on the damage. “Me and Spider-Man’ll take those trapped either side. Iron Man’ll relay scans of the buildings to us and keep them from coming down with us inside. Vision you take Roxxon with Wasp, Widow and Panther. We need to know who these people are and what they’re looking for.”
“This is your home, built using your money,” Vision supplied when it became apparent that she wasn’t going to say anything. “I’d say you had the most choice in the matter.”
“He loves us,” Harley called over his shoulder, already dragging a laughing Kamala away by her wheelie stool.
And yet there you are, standing over the spot where you had once forced me through the ground, using the very powers that
his mind supplied, subconsciously reaching out to touch what appeared to be his breathing rhythm. Molecules of light exploded outward, sounding like tiny fragments of crushed diamonds being poured into a velvet bag, before they gathered back together again.
and the next thing I know my dad’s on the line shouting at me about how Scott’s stolen the suit and some giant man had torn up an airport in Germany and Scott’s missed parole and...I was upset. And angry. And I was angry at
Doctor Cho smiled politely as the three of them entered and showed no indication that she was aware of the thick, murky tension that wafted around them like a dense fog.
“Wow,” Laura declared slowly, and Toni’s face heated with embarrassment, “there’s a lot more where that came from, huh?”
And of course, Natasha proved to be fucking boss at coming up with solutions to problems. No surprise there.
and slung it over her shoulder, silently cursing herself for being slow on the uptake while this poor kid looked like she was literally falling apart at the seams.
Only when they passed Training Room A, with its high gymnasium-type ceilings and tumbling course around the perimeter, it was already occupied and Steve did a double-take, something sharp and painful sinking its claws into his chest.
“—toes,” she finished. Her lips were pursed together but there was something that almost resembled faint amusement in her eyes as she took in the pained grimace he was trying and failing to suppress. Then she leaned in to Dummy, who was throwing what sounded like an electric tantrum, and whispered something that Bucky suspected was, “good boy,” before kissing one of the prongs of the claw and sending him on his way.
them. Nothing wrong with new blood and these folks’ve proven themselves more than worthy. The Panel thinks so too.”
The stones on her rings glinted in the golden light and she counted them one by one. Sapphire, amethyst, ruby, emerald, topaz and-
All eyes were on it when, two seconds later, there was the sound of a small explosion, causing the trash can to rattle violently once before white smoke — that smelled like burnt
But Vision was...different. And not in a way she felt particularly comfortable around. Not anymore. Nat prided herself on her propensity to strip a person down and see what they were made of and what they were hiding. Whether it was the fact that he wasn’t even
Because unlike them - save for Scott - he had a family to go back to, he had ties and responsibilities and he’d left Laura with barely a lifeline.
Just as quickly as it came, the feeling subsided until all that was left was guilt, sour and acidic, burning in her chest.
He looked at her, mouth twisted in a wry grin. “The most important day in modern history when aliens fell out of the sky and I can’t even
“Other than you, Steve and Barnes, no one.” Natasha’s narrowed in on the subtle shift of Toni’s shoulders, like she was hiding a flinch. “That I am aware of. Besides King T’Challa,” she amended for the sake of clarity.
Ueno and Ackerman looked unruffled but some of the others, including the angry man from earlier, grumbled and shared concerned looks and mutterings between one another.
even, and rather than frustrate her his level of control calmed the sudden spike of her heartbeat somewhat.
Friendships, relationships, fractured right down the middle and leaving raw and aching emptiness behind while the rest of the world trembled in the wake of it.
“Wait,” he interrupted, his voice sounding like gravel in his own ears, so rough that even Shuri looked at him curiously, momentarily brought out of her ramblings. “
She almost laughed. Or cried. Whichever would be more appropriate in front of hundreds of political heads and representatives. “Am I?”
Toni’s expression when she looked up from her work and saw Natasha walking through the would stick with her for a long time.
was becoming treacherous if the number of times she’d been resting on his bed only for FRIDAY to alert them that Wanda was outside looking for Vision was anything to go by - just so that she wouldn’t have to encounter any of the others.
She inhaled sharply, squeezing his hand. “You didn’t have the suit. I wasn’t sure if- I know you’re enhanced but I saw the wreckage and I thought- Jesus, Peter, what were you
“You were a neurosurgeon,” she remarked, flipping to the next page. Across from her Stephen Strange reclined in his chair, casually sipping a cup of tea that never seemed to empty.
Hello everybody and Happy Holidays~ I hope whatever holiday you celebrated over the last week was wonderful and unforgettable <3
He inhaled, gearing himself up to say something, then seemed to settle for, “It’s been hard to get a hold of you.”
Another thing is that a lot of you guys have been asking me what's the deal with the THING inside of Toni. This chapter touches on it a little, if it's obvious. It does get a little crazy up in here, especially in this chapter and things are only going to get weirder, if you can believe it, lol.
“Hey,” Nat began, twisting her ring around her finger in what Toni had come to discover was as close to a nervous tic as Nat could get. “Good luck with Ellis. Just like we practiced. It’s gonna be fine. He has a soft spot for you and Rhodey. Use it.”
“Kamala Khan. She and Mr. Keener started coming to the Compound around the same time as far as I can remember. They usually hang out in the West Wing with Ms. Stark and the other Avengers.” She stilled, face coloring awkwardly. “Uh, I mean—”
He sighed and pushed himself out of the chair, surveying the room around him. When he’d first walked in after months away he found it exactly the way he’d left it, down to the partially open drawer and the leather jacket he’d tossed onto the bed. And it had been too much of a reminder, felt too much like he’d been left behind while the world moved on.
She would see the way his arms were crossed, his hands cupping his elbows. It was both Captain America and sincerely
She wasn’t on a farm. She didn’t have Laura or Cooper or Lila or Nathaniel. But she had this. She had

“I thought we had once had a fairly long discussion about how psychic abilities should be used,” Vision said and he was surprised at just how cold he had sounded.
What excitement she’d felt at finally being able to speak to T’Challa face to face after almost two weeks was cut bitterly short when she skidded into a small conference room and took in his expression on the screen.
“Wanna take a fly with me?” She smiled, and it was warmer this time, not tainted by the layers upon layers of compact guilt and pain and exhaustion. And Vision found himself smiling in return.
“And yet we were all copied into the email you forwarded to the Council titled ‘Appeal to Drop all Charges Against James Buchanan Barnes.’ How does a woman who counts on so little do something so large when she is keenly aware of how such actions will be interpreted?”
He heard Clint’s footsteps as he came around behind them, strolled over to the fridge, opened it and pulled out a carton of expensive-looking grapefruit juice that had the initials
Then he’d put the t-shirt back in place, let it hang there amidst the rest of his things, a reminder of what he’d given up.
The corners of his lips quirked up. “I run around in a cat suit in my spare time. I also lie to politicians on a frequent basis about how poor my country is. We sell fruits on the side of dusty roads. And bracelets.”
Nat squinted, still a little unsteady as an incomprehensible sense of unease did a pirouette in her chest before disappearing entirely.
Hope gave one of her chuckles that always seemed to border on sardonic, but Toni had come to realize that it was just the way she sounded.
Toni knew her fair share of superheroes and wonder women and highfliers. And maybe Laura would never get that kind of international recognition or have her own Wikipedia page but she was a rockstar in her own right.
The woman jerked upright, the arc reactor creating two colorless pinpricks of light in her wide eyes. Shoving the hood of her blue MIT hoodie back, she slid closer until he could see her face more clearly. Her hair was a mess and her eyes were puffy and she looked like death warmed over but gosh, Peter still thought she was one of the most beautiful women in the world.
Toni always liked to say that the only thing that travelled faster than warp ten was gossip. And apparently that extended to the Compound. There’d never been much for anyone to go on. The team knew to varying degrees that
nor the faintly derisive tone she used to refer to the former Avengers. “She has grown very fond of you and has even detailed a list of initiatives to ensure you and your family’s safety. I believe she will start working on them when she returns to New York. And while we are all extremely grateful to you, Laura, for looking after our creator, I believe it is time for her to return home.”
is HYDRA’s MO. You either beat them into submission until they have nothing less or you create people like him. Sycophants. People who are willing to die for you no matter the cause.”
“Hope can take both of you down to one of the conference rooms. You’ve got people waiting for you.” Barton jerked but Toni resolutely avoided his gaze. She hadn’t had much of a chance to catch up with Laura and the kids in the two days since they’d arrived at the Compound but she’d seen the way Laura had grown increasingly resigned over the past few months the longer she didn’t hear from Clint. “Nat will already have explained this to you but your pardons put you on a probationary period for six months except in the most extenuating circumstances.” She paused and let that settle in. “Don’t waste it. Six months isn’t a long time.”
The arc reactor glowed beneath her henley top and Steve heard the distant echo of breaking glass, saw wide, fearful brown eyes, witnessed gauntlets rise to
As Helen worked, the nurses cleaned up and brought in the sterilized equipment and machinery for the new implant, and Toni allowed herself a brief moment to lean against Barnes’ bed to give herself some time to
“You’ve put me in a very difficult position,” he finally said, and it was evident that he was addressing Toni. The media had deemed it fit to name her the face of the Accords, after all. And of the Civil War. Team Cap and Team Iron Man. An entire world split right down the middle. “#BringBuckyBack has been trending ever since that speech of yours. All those documentaries about Steve Rogers and his best friend? I know the game. Played a little myself to get where I am. And I gotta tell you,” he said, leaning forward and clasping his hands together as he eyed them in turn, “you’re lucky
As always, I beta my own work and a million re-reads and double-checking will probably not be enough so I'm sorry if you spot some glaringly obvious spelling mistakes.
fine,” she repeated in a quieter voice. “You didn’t disappear off the map for six weeks because things were fine. You don’t have to tell me what happened.” And Toni could’ve fallen in love with her again in that moment. “I won’t push. But I saw you after Siberia, Toni. None of that was
Natasha had hummed because she remembered a period when all Toni had was herself and palladium poisoning. Maybe that was all on her, though. She, like Nat, was good at pushing people away.

“I know you will,” he said and his voice was a rasp. “But I...I don’t care about any of that right now. You just-” She squeezed her eyes out at the pain in his voice. “You left a note,” he accused, voice wavering. “You left a
T’Challa arched a brow at her and Toni struggled not to squirm under the intensity of his gaze. Journalists scenting blood in the water and politicians who enjoyed tearing billionaire geniuses down in front of millions had
Stark’s indulgent grin was small and distracted but real. “The prettiest,” she told her, then with her fingers she drummed a pattern onto her sternum where Bucky knew her arc reactor was embedded into her chest —
Something cold trickled down the back of her spine. It was there for a bare fraction of a second before vanishing.
“A while,” she admitted quietly, watching his expression. It contained nothing but resigned understanding, as if he’d expected it all along.
Stephen’s lips twitched and his eyes lost some of their worry. “I suppose. She did almost send herself crashing through the ceiling just now. Anyway. I’m sure you came here for reasons
Vision attributed his desire to save as some form of humanity that he’d somehow attained. Friendship was a loud dinner around a table and easy banter. Happiness was the creases at the corner of Wanda’s eyes when she laughed. Amusement was the bots claw-painting something for Toni. Fondness was laying a blanket over Toni who had fallen asleep at her desk. Concern was Toni stepping out of a suit mid-battle to ease a child and her pregnant mother out of a ruined car while JARVIS, then FRIDAY, watched over her. Guilt was a friend falling and falling and crashing with a thunderous sound. Fear was wide brown eyes and blue lips, frost gathering on dark lashes. The flicker of an arc reactor.
It was while he was sorting through his closet that his fingers stilled over an item of clothing hanging there amidst the jeans and jackets and plain t-shirts. His fingers hovered over the faded t-shirt, a generic SHIELD issue that had ‘ROGERS’ on the back. He’d worn it a lot a long time ago. Then at some point it had gotten mixed up in the laundry and he’d walked into Toni’s room a couple of weeks later to find her sitting on the bed wearing it. She’d been sleep-deprived and her hair a mess but the second he’d seen her in it he didn’t think he’d ever quite felt as if he’d been hit by a sixteen-wheeler as he did then.
prior expectations about what her lab might look and feel like. HYDRA’s had always been dimly lit with just enough spotlights that the doctors, scientists and guards liked to shine into the face of whoever their subject was for the day. As far as intimidation tactics went it was still effective and played into a psyche full of cinematic scenes of torture, wet, grimy walls and screams echoing in from behind metal doors with tiny square windows.
“Hey,” he murmured as he came up beside them. “Hi Colonel. Nice to see you again. Those’re some sweet braces.”
“I wouldn’t,” Toni warned, stepping in front of him and placing a hand on his chest. Ross looked like it offended him on a subatomic level but she gave a warning push. “Aunt Flo’s come to visit, if you know what I mean. Things could get messy.”
“I’m also really bad at this whole…life thing. I don’t function like most people. People used to have to pull me out of alcohol and drug-induced comas. It wasn’t pretty. Lots of vomit cleanup. Now it’s caffeine but, if research is anything to go by, that’s pretty shitty too.”
looking at him and she shifted her weight from foot to foot. Steve took pity on her and huffed a quiet laugh that sounded hollow even to his own ears.
His and Steve’s confession about what had happened in Siberia had gone down about as well as anybody expected. Though their interactions were frictional at best, Bucky had been thankful for Sam’s calm presence through it all, keeping Barton from taking a swing at Steve, laying a gentle hand on Wanda’s shoulder when her eyes filled with tears, a conflicted expression on her face that Bucky had no way of deciphering, talking low and quiet to Lang when he practically collapsed onto a seat with his head in his hands, clearly thinking about his daughter and trying to reconcile his leaving her with his reasons for joining the fight.
They fell to the bed together, hands entwined. Steve pecked Tony’s lips, repeatedly, but gently. “Je t’aime…. je t’aime…”
When the bath is ready, Steve gets in first so Tony can rest against Steve’s chest. The bath smells lovely, as do the candles. Steve, the huge sap, did actually scatter rose petals along the bubbles.
Just as Tony works up the courage to ask if they should go to bed, a loud crack reverberates through the room. Steve’s eyes go wide and Tony falls forward as Steve falls back. Steve hits the ground hard enough to knock the wind out of him. Tony falls gracelessly on top with a squawk.
“Absolutely,” Steve says as he pulls on some boxers. He leaves out the bedroom door. Tony stretches and sits up in bed. He can hear the coffee machine in his kitchen. He gets up and heads to the bathroom.
Steve moves to pull Tony’s shirt off, but Tony’s elbows get stuck. He struggles and thrashes and then WHAM! Tony gasps, yanking off the shirt to look at Steve, who is cradling his jaw. “Oh my God! Steve are you okay?” Steve tries to hold back a laugh, smiling. “I’m fine. Wasn’t that hard.”
He places Tony on the bed, who lies back to let his Dom look at him. After so long, it’s like they never stopped doing this. He remembers what Steve loves, just what Steve expects of his sub.
He leans in, straddling Tony as he unbuttons Tony’s shirt. Theres a strange metal disk in the center of his chest that gives off a soft glow. His fingers skim around it, rubbing at Tony’s nipples instead. “Nnnn…God. Steve.” Smirking, Steve shrugs off his jacket and pulls his shirt over his head. Tony’s mouth drops open, eyes darkening. Steve grinds down a little under Tony’s gaze. “You can touch.”
A blush rises unbidden to Tony’s cheeks. His first time giving a blowjob. Steve had been so patient with him. His boyfriend was so gorgeous. He hadn’t seen many naked, hard guys in person, but he was pretty sure that he’d hit the jackpot with Steve.
He slides down Steve’s dick, taking a good portion into his mouth and begins to bob like he's seen in the videos online. He looks up at Steve, gauging his reaction. Steve is panting and moaning, clutching the sheets with one hand. “God, Tony. You’re so good…so gorgeous when you suck my cock…I’ve been dreaming about this…” The admission makes Tony whimper, his cock twitching between his legs. He reaches down to stroke himself, but loses the rhythm on Steve’s cock.
“Quark,” Tony rasps. His face is flushed, lips kiss swollen, and eyes dark. Steve wants him so bad he can hardly stand it.
He’d locked eyes with Steve at the bar. Honestly, he hadn’t been expecting Steve to pick a fight with another Dom, but the second Tony heard his Dom voice, Tony was certain that he wanted Steve in his bed. And it had been an amazing, unforgettable night. Tony couldn’t remember the last time one of his partners had asked him if he was comfortable, checked in with him multiple times, or even asked him about his limits before even starting.
He tugged Steve by the hair, crushing their mouths together. “Evil,” Tony whined, grinding his hips down. Steve moaned softly, hands flying up to grip at Tony’s hips. “I actually…didn’t expect it to… affect you,” Steve gasped between fervent kisses. “You smirked at me.”
Turning his attention back to Steve, he tries sucking, hollowing out his cheeks. Steve gasps, obviously trying not to buck up. Steve’s head falls back as he moans, relishing Tony’s hot, eager mouth on his dick. “Tony…Tony, baby, I’m close. Pull off.” Tony listens and Steve strokes himself, once, twice, then comes.
“Ah…well obviously.” Steve rolls his eyes, but he’s still grinning. “If you’re such a genius you put it together.” Tony toes off his Prada shoes, pulls off his jacket, and loosens his tie. “Piece of cake.”
Immediately, Tony sits up to kiss Steve, hands roaming everywhere. His fingers are callused, rough as they trace the lines of Steve’s tattoos. Steve jolts a little when he finds Steve’s nipple rings, tugging gently. “So hot, oh my God. Steve, please.” Steve laughs softly under his breath. “Take it easy, baby. We’ve got all night.” He kisses Tony back, instincts in the back of his brain telling him to mark Tony, to claim him. “Lie back,” Steve orders. He snatches the restraints and binds them to Tony’s wrists.
Steve can’t hold back. This beautiful sub, so ready and at his mercy. He lifts Tony’s thighs so he can thrust properly, driving himself as far as he can go. “You don’t come until I do,” Steve orders. Tony nods, moaning and begging for more. Steve doesn’t last long; Tony is too hot, too wonderful. He comes into the condom, imagining one day he’ll get to come all over Tony, maybe fill him up. Tony howls, arching against the restraints as he comes all over himself.
Tony could tell Steve was desperate. There were two fingers in him, stretching, coaxing him open in half the usual time. Tony didn’t mind. He just needed Steve. Right now.
Tony starts to apologize, but the words die in his throat at the sight of Steve. He’s so muscular. Tony’s never done it before, but he sits up to put his mouth on Steve’s collarbone and touch the firm muscles of his abdomen. Steve huffs a little. “Tickles,” he says breathlessly. Tony’s hands come away immediately. He sits back, embarrassed by his own attempt.
Nat should her head. “I wouldn’t say tons…but it seems to me he’ll like anywhere you pick.” Steve groaned. “Not helpful…”
But Steve…Steve had broken down every barrier like it was nothing. Tony didn’t have to put on an act, he didn’t have to pretend. Tony sighs. He could easily get addicted to this- a dating life where he’s publicly acting like sub, where everyone knows.
He’s been to Steve’s apartment, where they made out on the couch until Tony got so nervous that they had to stop. They haven’t gotten very far, and Steve hasn’t questioned it. But Tony can see the look in his eyes when he asks to stop, to wait. He’s confused, maybe even a little hurt.
While they wait for the drinks Steve has ordered, Steve turns to Tony. “So, Tony, at the risk of sounding like an idiot, why me?” Tony chuckles. “I like the way you handled yourself earlier, with that pushy Dom.” Steve can’t hold back his grin. “The piercings and tattoos don’t scare you away? You don’t seem like the type,” Steve says, gesturing to Tony’s suit. “Let’s just say you’ve piqued my interest.” The bartender slides their drinks toward them and they get to talking. Tony is a businessman, but he’s far from the stiff types Steve usually meets. He’s also an engineer and he asks Steve about his art. Steve finds himself drawn to Tony’s enthusiasm and eagerness to please, even if it’s hidden under a cocky attitude.
Tony’s eyes go wide as he watches Steve’s cock spurt come all over his hand and cock. His eyes are tightly shut and his mouth his open wide as he moans. He’s beautiful. And Tony did that. He beams proudly. He did that.
Steve kissed Tony’s neck, biting down gently. “Only after I saw how red your face was, how you were wriggling in your seat. You were practically begging me to fuck you,” Steve whispered. In retaliation, Tony ground down again, earning a sharp moan from Steve.
Tony tries not to seem too eager as he falls to his knees, glad for the pillow. It’s warmer than the cool wood, and softer too. Steve pulls out his chair and sits, beginning his meal. Tony keeps his eyes trained down. Steve loves when he’s good. Tony wants to be good.
“Good boy.” He fumbles with the condom for a second. It’s been a while and he’s so god damn ready to be inside Tony already. Properly protected, he slides into Tony.
Steve tightens his grip on Tony’s thighs. Tony’s back bows as he comes, crying out. Steve swallows the come. Tony watches in awe, though he can barely think through the haze of his orgasm.
Tony Stark was not supposed to be a sub. He was supposed to be a Dom, like his father and his father before him. Stark men were Doms made of iron. And Tony was the weak link.
Tony hiccups a little sob. “I’ve never done this,” he admits, more tears falling. Steve looks shocked, then he rushes forward, holding Tony against his chest. “You’ve never done this?” Tony shakes his head, crying into Steve’s pecs. “Baby…Tony, why didn’t you say anything?”
Tony takes a deep breath to give an answer in an even voice. “What could we try?” Steve smiles bigger. “Well, we could start with seeing each other naked. And if you want we can try handjobs or blowjobs, or just stop with nakedness.”
They lose track of time. Steve only barely remembers that he came to the bar with Bucky. He looks around, but Buck’s probably found someone and gone home with them. “Looking for your friend?” Tony asks. “He must have found someone to take home.”
“Can we do something, just the two of us then?” Tony smiles weakly. “There is something I would like…”
“Tony, you know that’s not what I meant. Do you want Steve to be your first?” Tony’s mouth snapped shut and his face flushed crimson. “I…I really like him, Rhodes. I think I do…”
With Steve’s knees tucked below his armpits, Tony tries to get his mouth on him. Steve grabs his hair, tugging back, not painful but sharp. “You don’t get to suck my cock until I say so,” he growls. Tony moans. “Sorry, Sir. Just want your cock so bad.” They’re both so far gone already.
If Steve wasn’t hard before, he certainly is now. Tony is magnificent, so open and sweet. Steve wants to give him all of the pleasure he can. “You’re a good boy. Thank you for telling me.” He takes his hand off of the bulge in Tony’s pants to turn Tony’s head and kiss him. Tony sighs into the kiss. He’s so responsive, so eager, tilting his head and trembling. Steve’s glad he didn’t wear his lip ring tonight. He kisses Tony harder, unable to help himself. Tony moans softly, opening his mouth.
“I’m the only person to ever do this to you?” Steve repeats. Tony nods. Steve rumbles and takes Tony into his mouth.
Tony plops down next to Steve, who offers him the instructions. Tony scoffs, waving them away. “You don’t actually need instructions.”
Tony does his best to relax into the pose. It last for about a second before he’s itching to write out some equations or play with his tablet. He shifts ever so slightly, then freezes when he feels Steve’s eyes lock onto him. “Tony,” he warns, “this is your first and only warning. If you move again, I will punish you.”
Cuddling is also a big thing. Steve is constantly warm. Who needs blankets when you can lie on the couch pressed up against your own personal super soldier space heater?
Tony blinks at him. “Ikea? Steven Grant Rogers did you bring that Swedish manufactured nightmare into my home?” Steve cracks a smile. “It seemed sturdy and less expensive with the mahogany masterpieces Pepper kept trying to get me to buy.”
Tony moves behind Steve’s chair and begins to rub at his shoulders. There are crumpled pieces of paper all over the desk. Steve’s grip is so tight on his pink pencil that Tony’s surprised he hasn’t snapped it in half.
“Steve this is so good,” Tony moans as he takes another bite of tiramisu. Dinner had been amazing, but dessert had Tony moaning and Steve getting hot around the collar. “I’m glad you liked it.”
He chanted Steve’s name like a prayer, overwhelmed yet begging for more. “Je t’aime, Tony,” Steve said into his ear, fucking Tony with no restraint now.
“What do you mean you don’t celebrate your birthday?” He’s stopped sketching where he is seated at the couch in Tony’s lab. Tony waves a hand at him dismissively. “It’s not a big deal.”
Steve is at his desk, sketching the aliens they ran into today. He had been twitchy during the meeting with the peaceful creatures. Tony instantly recognized his desire to draw them. He couldn’t really blame them. Their translucent skin was like a prism, refracting a rainbow of colors unique to each being.
“Guess you really were busy tonight,” a voice says from behind. Tony startles, turning to see who caught him admiring the subs.
It’s fairly small compared to the penthouse. There’s a nice kitchen, a small living room with a big comfy couch and a fireplace. In the corner there’s an easel and some art supplies for Steve. On the coffee table, there’s a tablet and some of Tony’s blueprints and drafting materials- Steve knows better than to leave Tony without something to tinker with.
“How’s that feel?” Tony tugs on them. “Perfect.” Steve grins. Now Tony is completely his. He runs his lithe fingers all over Tony’s chest first, careful to avoid the center disk that Tony’s concerned about. “Knew you’d be even more beautiful like this,” Steve says reverently, “Tied up and hard for me.” Tony moans softly, tugging lightly on the restraints. Steve leans down as he starts to unbuckle Tony’s belt and open his pants. His tongue ring teases at Tony’s nipples, flicking across the hardened buds.Steve sits up to pull off Tony’s pants and his briefs. He spreads Tony’s legs wide, taking in the view of Tony’s puckered hole and twitching erection. “Fuck, baby. Wanna take you apart.”
Tony hushed him softly and continued to dig in to Steve’s tense muscles. He leans down to press kisses to the column of Steve’s neck. “Tony,” Steve repeats breathlessly. “I don’t appreciate being ignored Captain,” Tony whispers into his ear, nibbling gently at the lobe.
She also knows that boys can go through phases. She doesn’t panic when Bucky and her son come home from the local thrift store with piles of clothes. Steve takes to wearing a worn leather jacket and heavy boots.
“I love it, oh my God. I’m coming here everyday now.” Steve chuckles, taking Tony’s hand on the table. Tony looks down at their hands, flushing. “Are you finished?” Steve asks softly. Tony swallows hard, but nods. Steve tosses some cash on the table and leads Tony out of the restaurant.
“Yeah, but… you’re a Dom.” Steve looks almost offended, and then just confused. “What does that mean?”
The glass shower door opens and naked Steve steps through in to join him. Tony tenses for a moment. He’s never showered with anyone before. Steve smiles sweetly. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to startle you.”
