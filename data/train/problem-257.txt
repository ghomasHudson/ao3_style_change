John turned around at the loud voice of Bill Murray, who, accompanied by Major Sholto, was coming towards him with great strides through the garden, both wearing their dress uniforms.
"Set the timer to 30 minutes. I'm sure our dear Mycroft will get everything sorted out sooner" he laid a phone down.
"Let's go. We won't be able to hold them for long," urged Stephen with an echo, as his versions folded back on themselves.
"When Moriarty shot himself, Clay was in charge of making sure that the gunmen killed you if Sherlock reappeared" continued Mycroft.
He missed talking with Sherlock. He didn’t want to admit it, but he was worried about how Sherlock would be doing with the kids. The detective seemed shocked when he walked away.
"No, Sherlock, our experts verified them, as well as Mycroft's. It hasn't been tricked. You should see the images. This is very serious," said Lestrade's voice off-camera.
"Don't look so surprised. It's your fault, with all those documentaries you make me watch," he grunted.
Without adding anything else, the taxi driver put his foot down. Molly held the carrier tightly as they flew through the streets. The brakes squeaked when the cabbie turned and changed lanes like crazy, changing direction without warning. Exactly fifteen minutes later, they stopped in front of a white and elegant house, with no trace of the vehicle that followed them. The driver looked at her, puzzled.
John Watson went down to the hotel restaurant and sat at his usual table, at the back of the room, hidden enough to be able to enjoy his dinner quietly without a crowd of fans pouncing on him, but strategically placed to observe the rest of the guests.
"But... but you are not gay," gasped Donovan. She heard enough talk about John's cock and great performing in bed in the women's locker room to be sure of that.
"Because he fell in love with another master from the first time he saw him. Since then, he only dreams of that master telling him to go with him, even before he knows it himself. Because although the puppy is brilliant for many things, he is very idiot for others. The other master hasn't even noticed the devotion that the doggy you like has for him, but the dog doesn't care. He is happy just to be by his side. Until one day, after many adventures, the other master realises that he loves the puppy too, and takes the happy doggy with him. But you are left without him".
Donovan stormed in Lestrade’s office. The DI quickly closed a file he was studying. The sergeant looked at him, suspiciously.
"Rosie drew it for him. It's his Father's Day present", John explained, looking at Sherlock with tenderness.
That seemed to calm them for a while, but the final push was Rosie clapping her hands about the adventure, and soon all of them were settling on the blankets, disregarding the coldness or the sleepiness. Only mattered the fallow deer.
"Look, Mycroft, I know you are used to bossing your brother around, but I'm not going to let you do the same to my boyfriend."
He muttered something. The Avengers and Sherlock pierced his ears, and the mumbled words came to them:
John took his fingers out again and ran his tongue over Sherlock's cock to the tip to put a third finger in. While vibrating one of his fingers over Sherlock's prostate, John put his mouth around the tip of his cock and sucked hard. His tongue went through the slit until, with a chocked loud moan, Sherlock came hard into John's mouth, who kept sucking, sipping and fingering the detective until he twisted with grunts.
Sherlock pulled his head out of the water and stuck his tongue in a mocking gesture. He disappeared under the water again, running a flat tongue along John's cock, exhaling his breath slowly, creating bubbles that tickled John's cock in their path to the surface, making him squirm and moan. Sherlock's hands gently squeeze his testicles, the other softly rubbing a couple of fingertips on his perineum in a circular motion.
John at home and Lestrade in the shop laughed at the detective, who swelled with pride at his daughter's compliment.
“The Chief Superintendent,” Anderson announced, rearing his head in the office. He gestured toward the phone.
As a response, the SAS laid a small spray container on the Captain's hand. Mycroft frowned at the sight of it.
John pulled the duvet down a little, so he could look at Sherlock’s face. He enjoyed contemplating Sherlock while he was sleeping, his face relaxed, his lips softly muttering words in his sleep, or slightly parted while breathing.
Donovan watched him, between surprised and amused. Since when did Anderson put the pieces together so fast? Even the freak would have be amazed.
When he finished, Mycroft looked at his brother, opened his mouth as if to ask a question, and closed it again.
"Molly Hooper gave me this for you." Lestrade handed her the envelope. He didn't want to be rude, but he knew that not knowing they were coming from Sherlock, the woman would shut up.
He didn't want either leave Sherlock alone, by that was something they discussed before. In case one of them had to choose between saving the other or Rosie, she would always be their priority, a choosing John always prayed not having to take.
“John,” the whispered groan of the doctor’s name surprised both men again. The detective was wanking while having a fantasy with his flatmate. A flatmate, on the other hand, whose story of sexual life surely wouldn’t include an asexual freak, moreover being not gay.
"Mrs. Hudson!" he yelled, quickly covering himself and a sleeping Sherlock with the sheet, "What's wrong?".
Even so, if you haven't watched yet the last episode, keep in mind that there may be spoilers of it.
"It wouldn't do any good, Dr Watson," he heard Mycroft say. Greg had plugged in the speakerphone. "He is prepared to endure torture, and we have no time to lose".
"I was just telling them about Michael. When I think about the poor kid sitting on a bomb, I want to rip out Clay's throat" he sighed and smiled "happily the boy is okay, as well as that little girl… Sarah.
Rosie went barefoot and ran cheerfully to the seashore, chasing the waves and fleeing from them as they rolled into the sand. Sherlock and John lay down on the sand, side by side, looking up at the star-studded sky.
Sholto drove in the direction where the Cessna left him, Sherlock, and the homeless days before, driving with the windows open to avoid the smell of burnt metal.
“Well, for not existing, it’s a perfect one” Lestrade held out his hand, trying to catch the book. “The best crime novel I’ve ever read.”
He was barely able to think. His brain was overwhelmed, processing hundreds of deductive data coming from the children. And, unlike in the adults, the data they provided changed almost every second, obliging Sherlock’s mind to catalog them over and over, for once the data flow running almost at the same speed as his mighty mind.
"Sure," supported Tony. "You just have to do that circular thing you do with your hand, create a portal, and kick it back to its world."
He saw Bill Murray and the rest of the group on their knees, like him, their hands also tied behind their backs. He frowned. Luke was missing.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a second and put his index fingers below his chin, entering John's wing of his Mind Palace and gathering the stored information he was looking for. He opened them, approached one of the computers, and started typing quickly.
Almost instantaneously, a brutal orgasm shook Sherlock, pleasure flooding his body while a long, loud howled "John" name came out from his mouth, his neglected cock pulsing hard with every spurt.
"You say you always miss something. So do I. When I planned all this, I missed one thing: John would protect you at any cost, even in exchange for his life. I tried to convince him to take you, but he refused outright... and that tore everything apart. I missed how much he loves you".
John clenched his jaw and smiled so icily that made Moran blood ran cold, all smugness banished from his face.
"Wow, I thought to have a brother was great, but they hate each other," whispered Peter, astonished.
Finally, the detective was able to breathe, only to moan and gasp as he surfed the waves of pleasure that overloaded his body and mind, his body starting to relax.
“Doctor Watson, though I admire your trust in my brother, no one in their right mind would have left him alone with … kids,” he shivered at the word as if they were some kind of disgusting bugs.
Lestrade cleared his throat, and they both smiled without taking off their lips. Finally, they parted, sighing with resignation.
"It's the same guy who's trying to take out Mycroft. But, as I say, the pictures may be from long ago, "he looked at the five ex-soldiers. "I don't want you..."
“I said stick your tongue in my ass and shut up,” answered the detective between his clenched teeth.
When he surfaced, he held on to Sholto's outstretched arm, which pulled him up quickly and helped Sherlock to climb up afterwards.
The landlady cast a warning glance at Sherlock's brother and stretched out his arm in the exit direction.
"I'd be lying if I didn't say that... when I knew you were coming for me, I remembered what we went through together in Afghanistan. When we got back to London I fantasized that... we could get that back. But looking at what you have now… I don't understand well why you came to rescue me".
"No, but it doesn't make sense, because they are both together. So... the only explanation is that there is another Sherlock. Where did he come from? I don't know. Why? Neither do I, but..."
He couldn't finish his sentence. He put his hands on his head, panicking, imagining Rosie, alone and frightened, in the darkness and solitude of the Serbian cell.
"Do you like it?" the girl nodded, excited. Geena, thrilled, served another giant spoon filled to her plate's top, to Rosie's delight. She also filled John's plate to overflowing, and Sherlock, although she only served half the ration, was horrified by the amount of food on his plate.
"We lived in a beautiful house on the outskirts of London. I had a husband I loved and who apparently loved me..., He left school shortly after we were married, but he insisted I should continue studying. He earned a lot of money investing in the market, so I dedicated myself to finish my Medical studies. It was a fucking fairy tale.
She shrugged and nodded, her eyes shining, her lower lip trembling a bit. John sighed relieved. For a moment, he feared that the girl had heard them. He hugged her.
Both looked at each other gaped when the music of violins, drums, acoustic guitar, and piano began to play from Natasha's mobile, enveloped them, drawing them to each other, moving slowly, almost without realizing it, afraid to break that moment, but eager to reach out to each other.
“I know it's not easy to deal with him. But, could you imagine how we would be without him? The stack of unsolved cases? You and I would already be patrolling dog parks”.
“Nothing” settled John. “Tomorrow, we will go to school to pick up the camping items. ALL of them,” he looked dangerously at Sherlock, who opened his mouth to keep on arguing, but finally decided to close it, clashing his teeth.
The former DI approached slowly and, not sure why, hugged him. John stiffened, but then rested his head on the chest of the former ID and continued to cry, letting out all the pain he had kept for so long. Lestrade hesitantly put his hand on his head and stroked his hair, as if he were a child. Gradually John calmed down, until he pulled away from Greg, ashamed. He smiled affectionately.
"I mean, I don't see why they have to be here. We are the Avengers, for God's sake, we can manage perfectly well without the replicants".
"Excellent, boss, excellent. But now you have two problems. Two bombs and neither one knows where they are. And time is running out for all of you. Tick, tick, tick, tick..."
And it was even more terrifying. The officer looked at the DI, anguished. The three men were in his office, where Mycroft appeared to find the latest reports from the New Scotland Yard officers Lestrade assigned to watch Baker Street flat, more specifically, Sherlock.
Moriarty grimaced with lust. When he recorded the “Holmes killing Holmes” message for Eurus at Sherringford, he complained of not seeing the brothers killing each other. But now, he had a second chance to witnessing it and in a stall sit. He approached a bit since he didn’t want to miss any detail of the scene: Sherlock pointing a gun at Mycroft and the older Holmes pointing back Sherlock.
"Come to think of it, I promised to give you a different view of the beach. Let's play a game," he proposed.
“I’d prefer you to stay in there” the baritone tone contained a hint of plea on it. “I wouldn’t be able to do this looking at you”.
Sherlock scrutinized John's face to deduce whether he was telling the truth. John always found the transformation fascinating. All signs of excitement vanished from Sherlock's body, his dilated pupils returned to normal size, and his look became pierced, searching, deductive. It seemed impossible that, two minutes earlier, he was whining and almost sobbing about being allowed to come.
"That you would have left me. It's bad enough dealing with someone like… me, to also carry the burden that I was ... responsible for Anthony's death".
The detective smirked. John prepared to cut him off, worried about what might come out of his mouth.
He groaned when a lube coated finger teased at his entrance. John pushed it slowly, sliding in inch by inch, as the detective whined both in relief and in need, trying to steady his breathing. The doctor could envision his pupils dilating until his eyes went black, trying to sink in his finger.
John was worried about him. He had to get Sherlock out of that state as soon as possible, or the detective's mood would plummet. As a soldier, he knew it was time to pull out the heavy artillery.
“No, I'm truly asking you for help,” Donovan lowered his head, ”You ... well, I cannot explain to you why, but… I’m sure your contribution would play an important role… in the…”
“I've called you on the phone a thousand times, but you haven't picked it up. So I came to tell you. The Chief Superintendent got mad.”
All of them fixed his eyes on the screen. Sherlock raised a gun in the image and shot at the man's head without blinking, mumbling "idiot" when the body hit the ground. He turned to someone at the back of the image.
John sat again in the couch, face buried his hands, sobbing. Greg felt sorry for him. No doubt he had suffered a lot, but it wasn’t fair for him to destroy himself in that way.
The Serbian extended one arm, grabbing the doctor's throat. He had enough strength to strangle him easily. But the demon went crazy and hit him in the elbow. The Serbian shouted again, feeling his nerves torn from his joint, while a new rain of blows fell on him.
"We know where he is" announced Anthea on the other end "I got a call from Mycroft and Craig located it. A car is arriving".
He gently brushed Sherlock's asscheeks with his fingertips, just a ghostly touch that gave him goosebumps were his fingers caressed him. He started at the waist, going down his tail bone, almost reaching his ass's crack. In that triangle of skin, the detective was almost unbearably sensitive. As John's fingers ran over it, Sherlock closed his eyes, bit his lower lip, and moaned, arching his back and wriggling his hips, his cock throbbing hard while he tried to escape from the ghostly touch of John's finger, that inflamed him with desire.
Another whiplash landed on his ass, and Mycroft stiffened, feeling how two stretchy rings attached his cock and testicles separately and firmly.
"Well, you're right, it is stained, just like yours," observed Sherlock, taking some flour from the table and imitating what John had just done. John took his shirt off. He turned and stirred the milk chocolate pot with the wooden spoon, which had not yet completely melted.
“It's simple. The victims of the serial killer are totally bled, hence the cerulean colour of the bodies. This woman, however, judging by the white-pink tone of her skin, still retains blood in her body. An improvised botch made in a short space of time.
“No! Wait!” Moran shouted, desperately pulling on the door with all his strength, his knuckles whitening, trying to open it. Mycroft and John turned back towards the elevator, as the rumour of dozens of running footsteps reaching the hexagonal room got more and more audible
"You deserved all of this and much more," said John "Happy this and the un-celebrated birthdays. They also helped me to figure out what to buy you and to find it," he explained, throwing a thankful smile to the others.
"It's an airport for private jets, all data is confidential, and the only identifier is a locator. Trying to get that information would put them on notice."
John thought on this for a bit. It would be odd to punish Sherlock for something he didn't even know about, but it seemed Sherlock was truly remorseful and wanted to pay for it.
Sherlock smoked quickly, one cigarette after the other. The pack in his hand was already half way finished. He was silent, looking at the tile floor.
"John, I could hide a dead body in this flat and keep you from noticing." Sherlock said in a condescending tone. He didn't realize that was not the best thing to say at the moment.
All this was going through his head and Sherlock had still not said a word back to John. He was lost in his head again.
With a slight shudder at John’s frightening gaze, the man dried his hands on his jeans and quickly walked out the bathroom.
John didn’t let up on the tight grip he had on the back of Sherlock’s coat. His brow was heavy and his steps were carefully measured as he marched to the men’s room. He shoved people by without much care.
Sherlock was slumped on the couch, lazily watching crap telly. "What even is the point?" He mumbled tiredly. "Hooray, I'm one year closer to my impending death!" His voice was filled with ridiculously fake cheer.
Lestrade cleared his throat in the least natural way possible. John whipped his head around at the sound, cheeks flushed.
"Hooow, how could I forget. C'mon Lock." John called out from across the room, sitting in his chair.
He heard no audible reply, only Sherlock nodding his head yes as he wiped at his face with his hand. John decided to leave the punishment at that. All Sherlock had needed was to release his pent up guilt.
Lestrade was ready to forget Sherlock and return to the waiting group, but then he noticed Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock's blood stained fingers shook as he typed out John's number on his cell phone. He swallowed drily as the phone rang.
And that concludes this segment of An Agreement of Sorts! Thanks for reading, and I encourage you to leave constructive criticism down in the comments section. It's how I improve as a writer! Kudos and comments are also greatly appreciated :)
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, but changed his mind and looked to the floor. His face was maskless, and John found himself slowly reading Sherlock the way he would to others.
John was never afraid of physical affection during their aftercare sessions. Sherlock would sit in his lap and John would land kisses on his head, his forehead, his cheeks. But never on his lips.
"I highly doubt that. Now." She repeated, still holding her hand out. The two locked eyes, both unwavering.
He still had that stupid smile. "Stop it!" Sherlock screamed, continuing to bash his head against the wall. His vision blurred with tears. "Stop laughing at me!" A few sickening cracks stopped him.
“Oh, well,” John paused for a moment before returning the more than friendly smile. “Pretty good, actually.”
John smirked at the detective's usual cynical attitude. "C'mon. We can invite Molly and Greg for drinks. We can get a cake too."
John reached over from his chair and grabbed Sherlock's thin hand. He squeezed it comfortingly. Life was truly never going to be the same. Molly, Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, they might never see them again.
"Doctor Watson, I'll call a cab to be here within the minute. You can return to Baker Street and stay out of this." Mycroft reentered the car, getting ready to say his goodbyes.
"I had a long argument with a geneticist over the internet over the number of generations to breed a pure white rabbit from a spotted one. Coincidentally, I found a man in the street upset because he had delivered fourteen rabbit breeding pairs instead of twelve. He was in front of the pet store. I figured it was too good a chance, so I took their carriers while he wasn't-"
Sherlock squinted his eyes upward and tried to remember. "I think so." He couldn't quite recall the last hour or so of the night.
Molly didn't start out drinking hard and fast. She took one here and there, and as the night progressed imbibed more than the rest. She was a quiet, shy little thing that sure could hold her liquor.
Sherlock quieted instantly. The “Captain Watson” voice would always have an effect on him. He quickly shuffled over to his chair.
Mrs Hudson was nearly scared to death when she heard the strange noises coming from 221C. The lot had been empty for years, as she was never able to rent it out.There were definite footsteps audible. As she neared the door, she surprised to find it unlocked and cracked open. She tightly gripped the small handgun inside her purse, pulling it out as she slowly swung the door open. She may look like a meek little landlady, but she knew to stay armed. She had lived long enough with Sherlock to know that.
The only thing that bothered him was he hadn't found the present John bought for him. Because he was sure John did it. John loved gifts, to give and receive them. But though he had scavenged all over the flat, he hadn't found anything.
"I'm sorry I shouted at you, but don't do it again, okay?" begged John, hugging Sherlock and pecking his lips. "From now on, you will keep Rosie's drawings at home."
Sherlock nodded, pressing John’s body harder against his, as John tenderly rubbed his thumbs on Sherlock’s temples, weeping the tears up. He rolled his hips slowly, thrusting up into Sherlock’s body, feeling the detective clenching his muscles around his hard cock, making him moan and groan, as he sweetly tortured the detective with an endless, slow fuck, bringing him to the edge and pulling back when felt him about to come, as Sherlock arched upward, moaned John’s name out loud, and squirmed below him, finally begging him to pick up the pace, unable to take it anymore.
Sherlock could not hold back any longer and ran his hand down the back of John's neck, interlacing his fingers in the short blond hair, drawing him in. Both melted into a passionate kiss, full of desire and excitement, shivering as they brushed each other's tongues, groaning as their cocks brushed through their trousers' fabric.
Sebastian Moran gasped, suddenly recovering consciousness when John threw a glass of cold water on to his face.
"He couldn't even if he wanted to. Anthea is still the only assistant who can keep up with his brain. Many worked for Mycroft before, and according to rumor, the ones who didn't go out crying left London to never come back. And she is the only Sherlock tolerates. But you know how bad it is for Mycroft not to control everything".
Sherlock looked at his phone, which was vibrating, emitting a soft blue light. He was in Bill Wiggins' apartment, getting ready all he needed for his departure.
Lestrade's heart dropped at his feet, but he nodded, trying to appear confident that he didn't feel.
On another of the walls, annotations on unknown symbols appeared on several paper sheets distributed along the wall. Mycroft ripped them out one by one in rage and handed them to Anthea, who, unbeknownst to anyone but the eldest of the Holmes, appeared in the room, phone in hand, with a gesture of concern unusual for her.
“Sorry if I scared you,” the detective almost jumped when Rowan whispered at his side, “But I couldn't let them miss this.”
Mycroft looked at him, pretending to be incredulous and baffled. He had to keep Sherlock from talking any further.
Clay paced impatiently around the lectern he placed in an abandoned warehouse. At first, he thought about letting Mycroft talk in front of hundreds of journalists, public and private press, radio and television, national and international..., but that way, he, Clay would be an easy target for any expert shooter. Mycroft was still too powerful.
"But... but... to know that..." stammered Mycroft, relieved and at the same time fearing that Sherlock would finally discover the truth.
"This is the most stupid thing…" Lestrade grunted, picturing Mycroft dancing with his umbrella like Gene Kelly.
Anyway, he tried to change the doctor’s mind, made him believe everything was fine. Sherlock didn’t want to hurt him. And he knew this will do.
"No, not everything," replied Sherlock. "I think... although it's only a possibility, and I don't want to give you any false hopes but... I think Mike might be alive".
Sherlock's phone buzzed at the Avengers facilities. He looked at the name at the screen and put it again in his pocket.
Sherlock shook his head, unable to speak. The doctor frowned and came out from under his body, lying next to him, embracing and kissing him. He jumped from the table, got a glass of water, and gave it to the sleuth, who drank it avidly.
"Yes, but... there's no way to give him painkillers" breathed Bill "I'm sorry, I didn't want to worry you anymore, but if he doesn't calm down, he's going to go into shock again, and I don't know what to do anymore. He is yelling deductions to doctors and nurses, and they ran away in panic".
"Brainy is lucky that one of my clients has a medical kink. Otherwise, I don't know where I would have got nurses' uniforms at this hour," Irene Adler's purring voice came to them in a tone of amused mockery.
He bent down and picked up the phone. As he read it, his legs failed, and he dropped to the floor. He reread it, hoping he misunderstood. But the message was clear and concise.
From the kitchen, immersed in his last experiment, Sherlock gruunted. The best man subject went from an unspoken agreement (Lestrade) to a question of a constant argument between them after John, noticing Mycroft's desire to be his little brother's best man, invited him to be a sort of double best man alongside Lestrade.
Sherlock stopped moaning a bit ago. Instead, he was emitting a long, continuous howl that was increasing in intensity as the detective approached his orgasm, encouraging Greg to pinch and lick Sherlock's nipples as he speeded up the strokes on John's cock and seemed to have the same effect on the doctor, who also speeded up stroking both Greg and Sherlock cocks while the dildo kept on vibrating unremittingly against the detective's prostate, the three of them feeling their orgasm building fast inside them.
She turned to the young officer who was looking at her, then looked around for Lestrade. The man seemed to live in his office. That was the first time Donovan arrived at the office before the DI.
A military helicopter flew near the windows, and Moriarty stepped down from him, entering the office. All of them shooting at him at the same time, but the bullets seemed to collide with an invisible barrier and fell at Moriarty's feet without reaching him.
They smiled each other, and John couldn't help seeing in them a reflection of Sherlock and himself, two idiots in love, finally brave enough to face their true feelings.
He looked fondly at Sherlock, who raised his head and looked back at him. John frowned as he saw the detective's eyes sparkling with tears.
She had been walking for more than an hour and she was getting frantic, since she hadn’t been able to find Zoltar. What if the attraction had been cancelled, or even worse, destroyed? She felt about crying.
Having Mycroft as his wedding planner was the second weird thing. Though he was accustomed to his methods, it was creepy that, each time he received a suggestion on his phone, was it either the cake or the color of the decorations, it was exactly what John would have chosen. A couple of times, he wondered if Mycroft would have inoculated some kind of mind-reading bug into his head.
The flat was destroyed. Sherlock smashed the walls with a sledgehammer to remove cameras and other surveillance systems from Mycroft. Pulling the wires that connected them, he had torn out large chunks of wall, strips parallel to the baseboards, others rising from the floor to the ceiling, and many crossing it. Sherlock's armchair, the table, the coffee table, the sofa, the piles of papers, notes, and books on the floor…, everything was covered with pieces of wall and fine white powder. Everything except John's armchair, which the detective had taken the care to cover with a sheet.
The pain of Victor’s loss was still there, but also the happy memories that accompanied him, and the brightness that share his childhood memories with John and Rosie brought to some of them. Both helped him to rescue happy moments, to recover part of who he was, to rearrange the pieces that once almost destroyed him in a way that made him stronger.
"I have never felt so relieved watching you destroy my cameras," he admitted, smiling sadly. "When I saw them going black one by one... I almost danced. You blinded them."
"I'm not exaggerating one bit," replied Geena without turning around. Sherlock raised the right corner of his lip while John looked at her in surprise. "Do you remember when I made chocolate cake or pies?" She turned to John." Always flitting around. It was impossible to finish the cake without him taking chocolate, cookies, or condensed milk. He was like a cat. Before you knew it, he had fled with the loot."
John, afraid it was too much, made the others stop teasing Sherlock and he, Lestrade and the rest of the officers stroked themselves looking at the dildo going inside and out of Sherlock's arse at breakneck speed, the dildo nearly leaving Sherlock's passage each time and then stabbing back in, rotating and vibrating against his prostate, as the detective moaned and whined, sobbed and begged, a wrecked mess of sweat, cum, lust, pleasure, and exhaustion, arching in pleasure, shivering and crying with oversensitivity, as Donovan plunged in and out of the detective's ass, until her tights started trembling and, with a deep growl, she came, impaling the detective with the vibrating rotating dildo. The detective's body shook as the rest came hard also, covering Sherlock's body with cum.
The final scene of the chapter, when John conforts Sherlock, is based on the movie "Good Will Hunting", in its "It's not your fault" scene. I thnk is one of the most healing and helping for people who had been abused or maltreated , so I decided to adapt it a bit, but respecting the original dialogues and attitudes of the moving.
The next morning, Donovan woke up and stretched her arms. Then she jumped out of bed, took a shower, dressed and prepared breakfast. While eating, she looked at her smartphone. Turned off. It had run out of battery. She plugged the charger and the continuous vibration of a pile of incoming messages stirred her stomach. The freak must have arrived at the crime scene and had started barking orders as if the Yards were their lackeys.
Sherlock’s eyes widened to dinner plates. He took in a sharp breath. Damn human bloody fucking emotion.
And so, he was chosen to go count heads for the next round of drinks. What was it, the 5th or 6th round?
Amidst the leftover adrenaline and tired headache, John paused, taking a step back. This was painfully familiar territory, harkening back to a day where John was much too angry and Sherlock much too unresponsive.
"That's why you've been staying in my bed!" John exclaimed with realization. The cheeky bugger had said he was having trouble sleeping, and asked to stay with John. He simply did not want to sleep amidst the rabbits. John swore he could feel his hangover induced headache pounding even harder. He took in another deep, calming breath. "Why?"
He was never going to repeat that day. There was no way in hell Sherlock was getting a spanking today.
"Good lad." He said before ducking underneath the sink to look for some sponges. All he found were some raggedy ones, but they would have to do.
“You know you can tell me anything, anything at all. I’ve known you nearly two years, and we’ve  agreed to avoid lying.”
"The babies aren't yours though. Today, you will return them all back to the pet store. Understand?" John said, stepping out from the doorway. No matter how hungover he was, he still had to go to work, and his shift started soon.
“Sherlock, don’t lie to me.” John retorted, crossing his arms. Sherlock just gave him a blank stare. He then uncrossed his arms and tried a softer approach.
Mrs Hudson frowned as she returned to her flat, quietly muttering something about a spoon and luck. John made sure the little animals had sufficient food and water before leaving the room.
“John, remember. I’ve been smoking, look,” Sherlock dug his hand in his pocket, retrieving the empty pack of cigarettes, waving it in front of him. “Can’t you see, I even smell like cigarette-“
Finally, another addition to my favorite series. I know it’s been ages since I’ve written an update, but I’ve been pretty busy lately. This idea came to me this morning (yesterday I suppose) and I simply had to write it out. Thanks so much for reading :)
John rubbed at his eyes with the palms of his hands, sighing roughly. “You could have been killed! So close, so fucking close.” John groaned, pacing around the small room. “I mean, what the hell were you thinking? Why didn’t you stop to look both ways, like they teach in bleeding primary school?”
“Holy shit, that’s amazing. Makes you a hero!” She gushed, leaning closer against her side of ten counter. Her oval face was nearly touching John’s “What’s your name, so I can remember when I’m listening to the news?”
“I’m not apologising this time, either,” Sherlock said softly. “I believe people call this ‘expressing sympathy’ though I’m hardly an expert.”
He stared up at the ceiling in his and Mary's dim bedroom and tried to make sense of these words. Next to him, Mary was fast asleep. She hadn't said a word about his late return or his announcement that he had already had dinner with Sherlock. She had barely said anything at all, come to think of it. He couldn't recall if they had even kissed goodnight. Probably not.
"Food?" Sherlock asked. "You woke me at half past five in the morning, after a case, because you want breakfast?"
Since neither of the two made any move to stop before the entire joint was gone, John retreated upstairs and curled up on his bed where he could doze surrounded by his own scent with his nose buried under a pillow so the joint wouldn't get to him quite so easily. He had even nudged the door as far closed as he could without actually letting it latch shut. The last thing he wanted was to be locked in here and having to rely on Sherlock to get him out. It would feel too much like a punishment for protesting the weed and he honestly had no idea what its effect on Sherlock would be. Perhaps he would forget John had a problem with opening certain doors, perhaps he would completely forget about John at all and zone out, get lost in his Mind Palace or start a ridiculous experiment that would result in the destruction of yet another toaster.
"Apparently he injured his wing a couple of weeks ago and wasn't allowed to fly yet. Their Wing Healer feared it would put too much strain on the still-healing wing, so he took the Tube instead. Wasn't happy about it, either."
Every human and changeling in the vicinity jumped back. Most of the changelings ducked as if trying to avert a blow.
the Captain part of his brain whispered, sending a rush of adrenalin sizzling through his veins, thoughts of criminals and guns and Sherlock in danger clouding his mind.
"Do you know, I don't think you'll have to," John said, pointing towards a nearby field where a helicopter stood, looking utterly out of place.
He tilted his head, examining John. "You, on the other hand, were just released from the army hospital. What are you going to do?"
Sherlock had removed the batteries and any tracking devices from his and John's phones, made his way to Charing Cross station, used cash at one of the machines to buy a paper day ticket and had then used various side alleys to reach a bus stop at Trafalgar Square via a rather circuitous route. Let Mycroft's minions try to make sense of that.
Sherlock did. It didn't matter to him where he sat and he almost told her he wouldn't mind turning his back on them but the truth was that he did. He was curious and well aware that he was surrounded by what could very quickly become the enemy. At least this way he would not face them head on and hopefully present less of a threat.
It drew Sherlock's attention to the deplorable state they were in, both still completely dressed, though at least his shirt had already been halfway unbuttoned when John had walked into his bedroom.
He still was, lit from within by his joy in their outing, providing additional facts on most of the exhibits and laughing so hard he had to sit down when John told him about a school trip to the museum that had ended with him accidentally setting off the fire alarm and causing the entire building to be evacuated.
Finally, he cleared his throat. "I didn't ... I was drunk and hurt and angry with the world. Not you. Just ...the world, in general. But I remember very clearly what happened. I thought pouring it all out onto paper would help me. Get the poison out of the wound, so to speak. But I never, not for one moment, intended for anyone to ever read it. It was supposed to be a sort of therapy. The plan was to burn it. I had no idea Molly had given it to you. It was never,
Bewildered, John got up and followed Sherlock out, only half aware of where they were going. Most of his attention was on Sherlock and on Mrs Hendriksen's words. Surely she couldn't be right, could she?
Sherlock frowned, thinking about his question. "I ... am not sure. The possibility of this happening had never occurred to me. I ... am flattered?"
Just then, the dog gave a low whine. After a second of silence, everyone started prattling at once, the scientists excited, Barrymore and Lestrade worried. Sherlock remained silent, waiting a couple of seconds and watching John stir. Then, leaning forward, he carefully nudged the dog's shoulder. "John? John. Can you hear me? John!"
It was a serious accusation and wouldn't be too difficult to resolve, so Sherlock had been happy to agree and John had let himself be convinced easily.
He felt his own anger boil to the surface immediately and made a deliberate choice to keep his voice calm. Let her appear unhinged, it would do her no good. He would take the high road.
Sherlock looked up when John shuffled in. His hair was a mess and at least he had changed into his pyjamas at some point, but he was clearly wide awake and probably hadn't even tried to go to bed. He was sitting in the middle of the room, surrounded by books and pieces of paper in his own messy handwriting.
"So what were they doing in Regent's Park? Nothing. Mr Forsythe had no particular reason to come to Regent's Park, as far as we know, unless he was merely passing through. Now, if we draw a line from his home to the crime scene and then extend that line, where do we end up?"
"Do tell me if it feels too tight," Sherlock murmured, running a comforting hand down John's neck and over his shoulder in a gesture that was clearly unconscious.
Apparently the officer decided to let this slide and get on with the interview instead. All the better - Sherlock was getting impatient.
He was still reeling from suddenly finding John here in the flat, hadn't quite comprehended the consequences of John's presence and the fact that he had heard every word Sherlock had said.
When John did not loosen his grip, Sherlock turned slowly, suddenly unsure. Was John all right? Did he need anything?
Hi all, apologies for the delay - I spent the weekend moving house and was busy setting up furniture all evening yesterday. I hope you enjoy this latest offering!
"In you?" John asked, finding that extremely hard to believe. Sherlock was the most interesting person he had ever met.
"And a good afternoon to you, too, brother dear," Mycroft said, walking further into the room. One of his countless lackeys followed behind with a large box, which Mycroft gestured for him to put down on the coffee table. He did so and retreated back downstairs to wait by the front door. "I have made the necessary arrangements, set up the relevant papers and informed our parents of the situation."
"So that was interesting," John commented mildly as they stepped back into the temporary sanctuary of their room.
Sherlock opened his mouth but John was too focused on getting the words out to notice. “Someone whom I can love in return."
The Lillie Bridge Depot was a historic traction maintenance depot, owned by the London Underground and first opened in 1871. When he was younger, he had had a dealer here at one point. That was a point in his favour. He knew the area, although it had been a while, and he still remembered how to get in and out unseen. He double-checked for cameras but found none beyond those he had expected. The ones he did see had a small box attached that made him smile grimly. Someone was feeding false data into the cameras, no doubt showing a couple of uneventful days in a constant loop to mask their comings and goings. He had used a similar technology himself during his two years hunting down Moriarty's network.
She takes a deep breath. "Mary Morstan, you are under arrest on suspicion of multiple counts of murder and identity theft. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence."
Sherlock watched as Lestrade pulled John away a bit. Like most changelings, he had trouble estimating how well Psy and humans could hear, which made getting out of earshot an interesting game of chance. In this case, he misjudged in Sherlock's favour.
It would generate a nice additional income that would help pay for any maintenance work and also finance their flights whenever he and John decided to take Rosie on a holiday.
His heart sped up. Mycroft knew. Somehow, Mycroft knew. Well, of course he would. Kew Gardens was likely full of cameras. Heaven only knew what it was that Mycroft had seen or thought he had seen.
"It's not that simple," John said, wishing he could roll his eyes. He had explained this to her already, she was just being deliberately ignorant now. He couldn't even blame her. It couldn't be easy to want to marry someone only to find that they were married to someone else already, even if they hadn't known about it. Still, him and Sherlock being friends again had been her own suggestion, too.
!" He pulled out his phone to call John and make sure they had arrived where they were supposed to be before remembering that John was in the wrong shape to answer a phone call.
He blinked. "No information yet. I didn't want to upload his picture but there is no one considered missing yet. He was probably on his way home from work when he was attacked. I haven't seen his face before, so he is unlikely to be part of the more prominent members of Psy society."
As he followed Sherlock along the path, John allowed himself to imagine it. Never getting out of this body, forever being trapped as a dog, living the rest of his life by Sherlock's side like this. It wasn't a complete nightmare, but it also wasn't an idea that gave him joy. He wanted his own body back. He wanted to walk and talk like a human and have opposing thumbs and cook his own food and not be so dependent on Sherlock for everything.
"The sofa," Sherlock told him. "Do keep up, John. We have a perfectly comfortable sofa at home already."
It's an easy promise to make. After all that they have seen and done and said and been through, this is the truest thing he has ever said or done or felt.
"The places I could sneak to are pretty limited," Sherlock pointed out. "And I'm not keen on investigating the attic again anytime soon."
He buried his face in John's chest, letting the evidence of his sentiment soak the soft fabric of John's threadbare t-shirt.
He shook his head. "My family pack is SilentShadow up in Northern England. I'm a loner and I haven't been home in years. Sherlock is all the pack I need."
A soft sound caught his attention - humming, coming from down the other end of the hallway. He smiled to himself and followed the sound out of the sitting room and towards the spare bedroom. They had turned it into an office when they had first moved in, though John honestly couldn’t recall ever having used it for anything but a semi-organised storage room.
"Wait until she gets her keys out," Sherlock said softly. "John, you know what to do if she runs. And for god's sake, mind the traffic."
The longer he thought about it, the less certain John was that the answer was 'Yes'. And it scared him more than he could ever say.
"You don't think he made you do it, do you? That he gave you GHB, made you suggestible, and just ..." she trailed off but he knew what she meant and hated the thought. It sent a cold shiver down his spine and his entire being rebelled against it. Sherlock was many things, but he would never do something like this.
"You could've told me I was just wastin' me time on you!," the woman hanging on to Sherlock's other arm huffed, finally letting go of him and stepping back. "An' here I thought I'd finally found someone gorgeous and straight. Hard to come by in this city. Bloody hell."
It's almost midnight when Sally shuffles down the stairs and into her own flat. Dante meows at her in greeting but doesn't bother getting up from his basket. Even her cat is too tired to bother getting up. Sally can certainly relate to that. She's so tired, she wouldn't want to get up from her own bed if she was already lying in it, either.
They spent the next half hour bent over the remains of what should have been their Christmas dinner, Sherlock explaining his latest experiment and John drinking punch and not even pretending to understand a word his genius of a flatmate was saying.
There was a man with him and just as John focused on their conversation, the man said "Oh, is that yours?" and pointed at him.
Sherlock felt his frustration rise. Why had no one ever bothered to teach him this? How was he supposed to figure all of this out when he had no frame of reference?
He imagined other fingers but his own, shorter, rougher, infinitely gentle but firm enough when they needed to be, much like the man they belonged to.
John lifted his head and frowned. “I... she was a nurse. She worked in the same clinic as I did, transferred there about a month after I started. Before that, she worked in a hospital somewhere, I think.”
He looked as unhappy as John felt, which was quite a feat. He had rarely seen Sherlock as emotional as in the past couple of weeks. Since they had been at The Last Stand to solve a murder, actually.
Sherlock woke to the sensation of being stared at. That didn't usually happen to him - he didn't make it a habit of sleeping when there was someone else in the room. Well, not until recently.
He was hyperventilating and light-headed with it, snatching breath after breath. His hands shook like leaves in a gale.
“Do you think you could eat something tonight?” John asked. “You haven’t had a proper breakfast and three cups of tea don’t count.”
Not a denial but no confirmation either. He could not risk to give one out loud, she realised. Even here, you never knew who might be listening.
John opened his mouth, closed it again, and finally said: "So all this time... you had a way to track her? We've been here for
He was lying on the floor and there were several pairs of feet surrounding him. One of them looked familiar and their owner appeared to be wearing a long dark coat. Oh, good, that was Sherlock. John allowed his gaze to travel up the man's body until he found his face. The expression there made him reel back.
"How tragic. I'll be sure to pencil in some time to feel sorry for you all next Wednesday," he growls back at her.
He thanked her with a smile, hoisted the strap of his bag onto his shoulder and led Sherlock up the narrow, carpeted stairs and to their room.
"Perhaps later," Sherlock told him, smiling. "Good of you to notice, though. I'll have to see the rest of the staff and the guests before I can come to any further conclusions. Oh, and we might need to do a little breaking and entering."
John smiled softly, kissing the curly crown of Sherlock’s head. He then brushed away the wild raven locks and kissed his forehead. Turning his head, he kissing those famous sharp cheekbones.
"I forgot I was lactose intolerant." Sherlock admitted, wiping his mouth once again with his sleeve. He shakily stood while John gave him a paper cup of water.
"Not you. You're helping me pick. Now, he's got a bit of a doctor kink. I was thinking either that little brunette pathologist girl, or your buddy, the soldier."
Sherlock, well, he was just breathing hard. Every inhale and exhale did nothing to calm the cluttered mess that his mind was at the moment.
Sherlock managed to hide his wince at these words. They were too familiar, too much of a relationship thing. As much as he wanted to hear that, it wasn't the sort of thing Mary should witness.
He had to duck out of the way to avoid getting hit in the face by a flying loaf of bread and turned to glare at his flatmate. "You did that on purpose."
Before John could get into the topic some more, Sherlock added: "Anyway, you wanted to talk. So talk."
"Must have been after his fake death, then," Sally said, shrugging. "You're just hurt because he didn't invite you to the wedding."
"Shut up, John," Sherlock growled and a moment later he had crowed John against the door and was kissing him for all he was worth.
“Silly boy,” she said, swatting him lightly. “You make sure John here has everything he needs, you hear?”
"It has been, recently, yes," she said slowly. "We didn't think much of it, it often acts up around this time of the year, so no one was particularly surprised, you see?"
No reply came forth. Not as he left the flat, not when he hailed a cab, not during the agonisingly long ride to the pub where Sherlock was apparently requiring his presence.
Sherlock, surprised by the sound of his first name from John's lips, took a second to respond. "No one told me, no. I suppose it was quite recently, since you're all still here?"
"Alright," John says and stretches, trying to find the surface of the table and then the torch on said table. It takes some grasping and searching until his fingers finally close around something metallic and round that might just be a torch.
“Mmh, and I had a rather spectacular love bite on my throat,” Sherlock confirmed, smiling at the memory. “Right under my jaw so my scarf wouldn’t cover it at all.”
"Oh, you know that boy," Mrs Hudson says, as if Sally is privy to his innermost thoughts. "If John asks him to do something, he'll exceed all expectations."
"Be careful, little brother," he said instead and hung up. It was just as well, because Sherlock wasn't in the mood to lie to him.
Jonathan Small was a heap of misery. He sat at the table, a hunched figure, looking tired and dishevelled. When John rounded the table and Small raised his head to look at him, John saw that his eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed, with dark circles underneath them. He clearly hadn't slept half as well as John did these days.
Yes, he thought. This was worth it. Whatever happened, happened, and in the meantime he would gobble up as many of these moments as he could get and keep them in a safe place in his mind palace where they could never be taken from him.
But it isn't. Not to John, who thinks himself expendable, as if Sherlock could bear to live without him.
"Usually I live less than a five minute walk away from a very good dry cleaner," he said primly. "It's a Belstaff, not some rag I got at Primark."
In short, while John had ceased being human, it felt as if Sherlock had become more human in turn. Perhaps he always had been and this was the first time he was able to show it, but the end result remained the same.
"No, this isn't a natural position for anyone to put their hand," John says. He's playing the victim, of course, so Sherlock can "see" the crime scene from the killer's point of view, and providing a running commentary on what does and doesn't work.
"I don't know. Perhaps another assassination attempt on a Councillor. Perhaps the changelings are planning an uprising. But no matter what it is, I am almost certain the changeling packs around San Francisco will be involved somehow."
John grinned. "I'm as amazed as you are, but nope. It's all fine. He's ... not like any Psy you've ever seen, I can promise you that."
This was not the sort of fake kiss he had allowed his female friends to draw him into on similar occasions at the pub. This was different.
It was almost a mercy the current situation was as it was. If John had been human, there was no telling what Sherlock would have done. Perhaps gotten even more worked up and more quickly, too. It happened once in a while, after all, and he didn't want to imagine what might have happened if he had been this horny with a human John in the flat and so soon after running into a whole troop of soldiers.
The soft enquiry tore him from his thoughts. Turning back around, he leaned against the counter. "Yeah, sorry. Uh, the barkeeper took your phone and texted me to come and get you. One of your brother's cars showed up outside the pub to drive us home. I dragged you in, helped you out of your coat and shoes, and put you in bed."
No, this had been better. John would never forget seeing Sherlock walk through the door and Rosie launching herself into his arms. Not for as long as he lived, he was certain, and probably not after that, either. The joy on Sherlock's face as he had held her had been beyond description.
John groaned and shoved the covers away, hoping the cooler air would shock him into wakefulness. Sometime while he slept, his t-shirt must have ridden up and he shuddered as the cool air hit his bare skin. Quickly, he pulled the cotton back down. "Gosh, I didn't think it would be quite so cold."
"Just what I was hoping to spend my day doing," John said with hardly any trace of sarcasm whatsoever.
Those iridescent eyes snapped up to focus on him with a stare that seemed to look right into his soul. Sherlock tilted his head a little, a habitual movement that betrayed his interest in the topic.
She shrugged. "There isn't a lot going on in my department right now - the police took all our files and computers away. We've had to start building entire new databases but I haven't got the head for all this programming. And everyone needs a cup of tea sometimes."
The ground floor was deserted and they sneaked past reception and out into the night with no one the wiser. The door, of course, was unlocked.
"This is crazy," Lestrade commented from where he stood several feet away. Disbelief was etched all over his face, as if he still hadn't come to terms with the situation. Sherlock wondered what it was like, taking this long to adapt to a new situation. Oh well, ordinary people and their ordinary minds. He would spend his time carefully watching John and making note of absolutely every tiny detail. As far as he was concerned, that was a far better use of his time than spending all day wrapping his mind around the idea that his best friend was suddenly no longer human. That much was a fact and he saw no reason not to accept it as such and move on.
Sherlock snorted. “I was paranoid about how you would react,” he admitted. “It wasn’t really a question of self-restraint but of self-doubt.”
"Oh John, I'm so happy for you!" She rushed forward and hugged him and Sherlock felt a sudden and intense urge to snarl at her. She seemed to notice his sudden tension for she immediately backed away again. "Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean... he's all yours."
"Oh, let the poor boy have some pasta, Sherlock," she huffed at him. "He hasn't had a proper meal since this whole mess started, have a bit of compassion."
Considering how her marriage had ended, he wasn't sure that was a good thing, but he suspected the ending was not the part she was currently focusing on.
Sherlock frowns uncertainly and then glances at John, who somehow manages to deflect any potential for tension. And the way Sherlock looks at him as soon as John turns away makes Sally wish she had more champagne. Oh dear.
"Goodbye, love," Sherlock said but his voice was too close to the baby monitor now, too close for John to believe that he hadn't been aware of its presence, that he hadn't spoken these words deliberately. For him, not for Rosie.
The lift came to a halt and the doors opened. John firmly wrenched his thoughts back to the present and preceded Sherlock out into the hallway.
Heart hammering, John looked him straight in the eye and licked his lips. Silly to be nervous when he was so sure of what Sherlock's answer would be, and yet...
No, that was his mind playing tricks on them. The crackling noise was still audible and he could see the steam - no, he realised. The smoke.
No, this had to be observed carefully. They both needed to be absolutely certain that this wasn’t some bizarre sort of rebound. They deserved better than that, both of them.
"Memories, you mean," Lestrade growled. "I'm not stupid. It's a mental network, everything you 'upload' is something you have seen or heard."
So far, John's character was positively and absolutely his, though a part of him seemed to respond to stimuli dogs would experience in a similar manner. Sherlock supposed that could be expected and wasn't anything worth worrying about.
But Sherlock clearly was not yet done digesting this new information. "And you just ... say it. Out loud. Like that."
"Because humans are boring!" the Psy shouted. An unexpected reaction and Sherlock just barely managed to stop himself from flinching away. "Changelings at least present a challenge with their natural shields. But you ..." He stared at Sherlock with evil delight. "You are the true challenge. Who would have thought you would have that many shields? I've seen Councillors with less."
"Both." His voice sounded pitifully small but he couldn't bring himself to care. Not with John's arms around him and his breath hot in Sherlock's ear and his pulse just inches from his mouth.
"Take the other cup from next to the kettle," John said, pointing towards the sideboard that held the electric kettle and a bunch of tea bags. "And don't bother with a plate. We can share. There's certainly enough food for two on here and you need to eat something."
John hummed and ducked back down to kiss him again, cradling his face in both his hands so he could angle his head the way he wanted to, fit their mouths together in ever new ways until Sherlock was whimpering beneath him, his fingers clutching at John's t-shirt. John felt a little smug at that. Kissing was one thing he knew he was good at, and he took pride in it. It was nice to know that Sherlock wasn't at all immune to that.
"I will take over from here," a cool voice said behind him and Lestrade whirled to find two Psy males standing in the doorway. One of them looked like a soldier, though he seemed to be using a prosthetic arm. The other looked like ... well, like the Psy Councillor they sometimes saw on the news. He had the night-sky eyes of a Cardinal.
"I will do my best to keep John away from them, then," Sherlock said. "I do not care what they say to me. He will be hurt by their words anyway. I always thought there was nothing more precious to a changeling than their children."
The bed was cold and empty and finally big enough. John sank into it gratefully. It was the first time in far too long that he didn't have to share it with anyone, that he could sprawl as much as he liked. He had been stiff as a board most mornings recently, his muscles aching from the way he had kept himself from moving even in his sleep, unwilling to get too close.
Small genetic experiments such as Doctor Stapleton was performing on glowing rabbits held no real interest for him - anyone could make a rabbit glow in the dark, provided they had a rabbit, a laboratory, the necessary equipment and a handful of glow genes. It was hardly a challenge.
John woke with an armful of Sherlock Holmes and immediately decided it was by far the best possible way of waking. There were dark curls in his mouth and a knee pressing down on his bladder and Sherlock's breath tickling his neck and it was perfect.
Sherlock bit out a harsh laugh. "No." He swallowed. "Don't distress yourself. I haven't been all right in over two years. Perhaps I never will be."
Of course it was, John had known it would be. It did, however, contain the most important thing he would need on his and Mary's big day: the wedding bands.
Sherlock shook his head. “We were separated for five minutes after our arrival when I went to the bathroom, but not once we entered the old vestry.”
"Lestrade, we just looked at the photos ... yes, lovely ... no, I don't care about that. Listen, have you interviewed the photographer? The last picture he took was of the gardens, including the window to the new vestry where Mary was. The time stamp-" he brought it up "-is from just a minute before she got shot."
John blinked. “That’s a bit out of the left field. I would have expected an architect of a bank to be more Mycroft’s first choice of a museum,” he admitted. “I didn’t even know that guy had one.”
John shrugged. "We're friendly. I happened to meet them at a pub a couple of nights ago. Not Soraya, though. I haven't seen her in a couple of years."
"Too much input," Sherlock concluded, rounding on the people gathered around them. "Get out! All of you, now! Barrymore, you'll go ahead and make sure every door is opened the moment we approach. Lestrade, stay here and help me with John."
He lifted the tray and held it up while he waited for Sherlock to get settled, then promptly deposited it in his lap. "There. Do your statue impression for a bit while I pour you a cuppa, will you?"
John shook his head, got up, walked over to where Sherlock was still standing by the coffee table, and nudged his leg in the direction of the dog bed.
John, who was starting to wonder if he had developed some form of sixth sense for this sort of thing happening, sprang forward and tried to wrestle the man's arm down before he could do more than swing in Sherlock's vague direction.
He stared at her, surprised, and she shrugged again. "I am not Silent, Sherlock. Just because you are trying to hold on to the protocol doesn't mean I don't consider you a friend. So if you ever need anything, all you have to do is ask and I will do my best to help you however I can. And if you ever break Silence, remember there are others like us out there. We are by far not the first and I doubt we will be the last. In the meantime, try not to get brain-damage while defying the Council."
Sherlock stared at him in disbelief, then managed a jerky nod. "Of course, John." He swallowed. "You're welcome."
It occurred to John that perhaps Sherlock didn't want to be his Best Man. But who else would he ask? Who else did he trust well enough to get him to and through his wedding day? And Sherlock had seemed willing enough, after the initial shock. After ... after he had recovered from what, in hindsight, was clearly surprise that John considered him his best friend.
"If it helps, I had hoped to come back sooner and for our reunion to be a happier occasion." Sherlock found himself fiddling with his coat, unable to look at John's face.
And now this ... Sherlock, all but ordering him to help him out of his clothes, as if John needed any additional incentive to absolutely devour him.
"You're smaller than I am, you will fit and if you crouch on the floor you can help me get out of these. I can't reach that far down."
Sherlock smiled sadly. "I thought if this was my punishment for leaving for two years, I deserved it. And I'd rather see you be happy with her than not see you at all. I figured that so long as I had you in my life, there was a chance, however small. I was wrong, of course, but it hardly matters now."
"I sent a team over to the company yesterday to get the other files. Our boys should start working on them today, so I'm expecting some preliminary results by tomorrow," Lestrade said, checking his notes. "I also asked Molly to prioritise the DNA test on the child. The sooner we know if Forsythe junior really was the father, the better."
He opened his eyes and blinked until the blurry something above him swam into focus - it was John's face. Sherlock's brain took a moment to draw the correct card from his memory, then identified the expression on John's face as concern.
John groaned. "Well, they can think what they want but I'm not gay. And Sherlock isn't ... he just doesn't feel things that way. It's a ridiculous assumption to make. Sherlock and I have never once been in a relationship or even discussed the possibility of it."
Had he been? Sherlock frowned, trying to backtrack on his own thoughts. Had he subconsciously been thinking about John? Certainly the idea of John dying was ... distasteful. He would have to find another flatmate, for one thing, and the Yarders would get on his nerves about it with thinly veiled comments on who might be responsible and that it had only been a matter of time. And of course ... well, he would no longer have John.
Before he could start waxing poetry about his discovery, John decided it was high time to finally wake his flatmate. It was time to embrace his new form and do what any dog would do.
They were both silent for a while, cuddled together in Sherlock's large bed, just enjoying each other's quiet company.
That hug in the hospital had stayed with him, as if his body could not let go of the memory of John's warmth and his strong arms wrapped around him, holding him close.
Well, that was over now, wasn't it? Someone had come along and shot the lock right out of the door. Literally.
Swallowing tightly, he tried for a smile, knowing that Sherlock couldn't see it in this position. "That's good. I do care for you. And I will always keep you safe."
She must have seen something in his eyes because she nodded. "All right. I'll just be downstairs. You shout if you need anything and I'll make sure no one comes up to disturb you."
John craned his neck and dragged his gaze along Sherlock's obscenely long index finger towards their tree, which seemed to be flickering in places. Ah. Candles. Sherlock had put real candles on the tree and lit them. Must have done so while John was in the kitchen. The candles were yellow and the pleasing scent of bee wax wafted towards John.
Another step brought him to within inches of Sherlock, who was staring at him with wide eyes, his chest rising and falling rapidly.
"I want everything," Sherlock repeated, holding his gaze even as his hips continued their restless shifting. "We're doing this, yes? Once won't be enough, John. It will never be enough for me."
The body was that of a young man. He lay on the floor, a medium-sized puddle of blood spreading around his head.
He had no intention of setting foot within half a mile of John if Mary was anywhere in his vicinity, but that was not something he would ever say out loud.
And Holmes, wide-eyed and suddenly very pale indeed, says: "Thank you, Sally, I think we can skip that part."
This time, Sherlock averted his gaze. "I'm neither willing to nor capable of having sex with you and then return to the status quo, John."
He is not at all surprised to find Sherlock huddled in a miserable heap on the sofa the next morning. Rosie is sitting on her play blanket on the floor, beaming at John as he enters and trying to throw a ball at Sherlock. Her cold seems to have disappeared safe for a light sniffle.
He knew he would have to tread carefully today. He couldn't stand too close or say the wrong thing or even give the wrong (or rather: the right) impression. If anyone were to comment and mistake them for a couple, he knew John would vehemently deny the assumption and then retreat so far into his shell it would take weeks to get him out again. And Sherlock knew he didn't have weeks.
The thought of staying is shockingly tempting and John takes that as a sign to remove himself to the kitchen before he does something he isn't quite ready for. Not yet.
He couldn't remember a time when he had felt that bad about himself and his own actions. But he could make this right.
He had an unassuming young man who had been stabbed rather viciously outside the back door. He had evidence that the young man had somehow come into some significant money, though no one seemed to know how. He had a collection of hotel guests and staff who, by all appearances, were either too self-absorbed or too stupid or too innocent to have committed the murder. And he had only a couple of days left to uncover the truth while keeping his own truth concealed under any circumstances.
They headed down the stairs, called out a goodbye to Mrs Hudson in passing and Sherlock managed to hail a cab before he had even reached the curb.
Postman's Park wasn't very far from St Bart's hospital. It also wasn't very large, but Sally knew there weren't any other parks around and it would do well enough to exercise a dog. Anything was better than the hospital, after all.
They had come back from Scotland a week ago and every day, getting out of bed was harder than it had been the day before. The black cloud of depression held him down, an unshakeable weight pulling on his very bones.
Sherlock found himself nodding. He had no idea what was happening but for some reason he couldn't fathom, he had said what he wanted out loud and the world hadn't ended and nothing seemed to be on fire.
Sherlock nodded, grabbed it, and slowly turned the pages, not noticing that John, hearing Rosie's request, went up the stairs and leaned against the doorway.
And then, the box inside his Mind Palace exploded and the Hell overflowed Sherlock, who hid his face between his hands and started sobbing heavily. John embraced him, holding him tight, caressing his hair, muttering tender words, making Sherlock feeling safe and loved between his arms, helping the detective to, finally, start healing his wounds.
The doctor got into the jacuzzi and pulled Sherlock in, the perfect warmness of the oiled water caressing them.
The sergeant nodded mockingly. John sighed. All of them left the hospital and got into cars to go to the camp.
"What did you expect? A dungeon? I'm saving that for..." Irene stopped at the pathologist's warning gaze. "Mandy, one of my assistants, is a mother, and from time to time, she leaves her daughter here. That's why I have all this... stuff."
“A blog? No, he writes novels. In fact, he is the bestselling author of the moment. You should read his books. Sherlock Holmes solves the cases that NSY is unable to, like the serial suicides one.”
Every night, after relating it into a happy memory, John kissed and caressed the scar, and then slid down Sherlock’s back, kissing the rest of them, whispering praises about how gorgeous, beautiful, brave, strong, and generous Sherlock was, how much he loved him, gently sinking his lubed fingers in his entrance. He made Sherlock feeling loved and cared with words, kisses, and caressings, until, shaking and moaning, unable to stand it more, he begged John to fuck him. And John complied, slowly thrusting inside him, making the memory indelible in Sherlock's body and mind.
"Wait, John, wait,' shouted Sherlock, standing between them, much to the doctor's annoyance and Mycroft and Lestrade's astonishment.
"Better ask it to your parents when they came back, sweetheart," replied Molly, trying to avoid the subject.
We're sorry it took so long for the next chapter. But once we are back in the multiverse, we will reach the end :-)
John's tongue moved down and slowly circled Sherlock's right nipple, without touching it, and Greg imitated him. Sherlock moaned harder this time, pulled the ropes, threw his head back, and arched his body. Greg looked in fascination with how Sherlock's cock got harder only with the anticipation of the touch.
Jake and Pete spent eight years in that country until Jake was shot in a firefight. They become good friends on the base, and Pete decided to go back to England with him. Within months of returning, both ended up living on the streets. Neither spoke of the reasons that had led to it, but Sherlock didn't need to ask: the PTSD made them lose their families, their work, what led them to lack of money, and finally, the street. They soon became part of Sherlock's homeless network. The ability to observe without being seen was coupled with their military training. When Sherlock appeared explaining what happened to John, both had accepted going back to Afghanistan without hesitation.
"You did bowl over one of them," Sherlock pointed out. "It is not unreasonable to think you might be injured in the process."
The thought triggered something, alarm bells ringing in his mind palace. It had taken half a day to set it up - an ingrained reaction to catching himself wanting drugs.
He spent the entire previous day measuring Rosie's temperature with the back of his hand every five minutes and keeping a log on her tissue consumption, stopping the time between her sneezes and harrassing Mrs Hudson to knit her a warm hat and socks, completely ignorant of the fact that Mrs Hudson doesn't knit. The rest of his time was spent arguing with John about taking Rosie to see a doctor who isn't emotionally compromised like John.
"... or perhaps we can make do with the collar and trust that John will find his way back home in the unlikely event of his losing it," Mycroft offered, clearly realising that he was in acute danger of being bitten by one of the inhabitants of the flat - which one was still up for debate.
"Don't be ridiculous, John." His eyes flicked to the door again. "That cook hasn't even seen the two of us together more than once."
Without ever quite agreeing on it, they ended up back at Angelo's restaurant. They hadn't been in a while and the huge water buffalo changeling gave Sherlock such a hearty clap on the back, he stumbled and all but fell into his seat.
John huffed and shook his head, trying to somehow indicate that he was fine. He sniffed and nudged Sherlock's chin with his nose, careful to avoid his cheek.
Mycroft had shuddered at the idea of being an uncle (though Sherlock hadn't missed the fleeting, stunned look on his face) and agreed their parents would indeed be very pleased with the news. And that had been that.
Movement at the other end of the lab drew his attention and he watched as John stepped through the door, looking relieved and eager to go home. There was a wary expression on his face as he looked around the lab and Sherlock wondered if he was still upset about the whole drug thing. Oh well, all of that would soon be forgotten.
It wasn't perfect and perhaps it never would be, and there were still things they needed to talk about. Stories had to be told and forgiveness needed to be asked for and granted, but there was time for that now. And they would use it wisely. Together.
That got a reaction. Sherlock threw one leg over John's, slotting their bodies together as close as he could, and shook his head.
With a soft 'click' the door opened and he walked inside. John followed, closing the door behind him. "Are you sure about this?"
"Not on purpose," Sherlock said. "But any strong emotion shakes my control over my telekinesis. Any larger emotional upset might cause a flare of my power and do untold damage. I cannot risk it and nor would many others."
Sherlock ignored them all, of course, and John had no choice but to follow him as he strode through the doors and towards the lift.
John decided in that precise moment that if Sherlock did not have a pack that wanted him, then John would be all the pack he could possibly need.
He leaped up, suddenly filled with purpose once more. If Molly couldn't give him what he wanted until morning, then he would go and get it himself right now! It was brilliant!
Sherlock tilted his head and frowned at him. "I was not sure how you would take this, so I thought I would give you some time to adjust to living with a Psy before confronting you with-"
He burst from the shadows, teeth bared and a low, dangerous growl emitting from deep within his chest.
"-and I got over that months ago," John interrupts, jumping up from the sofa again so he can start pacing. "And it's not like I don't want to... you know. Lord knows I don't have this problem when-"
. The words still haunted him, burned a hole right through his chest. In his worst dreams, he always stumbled out of his hiding place to fall at John's feet. Sometimes, John forgave him. Other times, he didn't. Sherlock wasn't sure which of the two was the nightmare.
"And it didn't work," Sherlock reaffirmed. "I don't know why. It just never seemed to stick for long. Molly is in a similar position, except that she is infinitely worse at pretending."
The first sip of hot tea was enough to settle his jittery nerves and make his muscles relax. He wondered how much of that effect came from the tea and how much of it was caused by the simple comfort of something so familiar. Sherlock could probably tell him the statistics or conduct an experiment on the precise effects of making tea versus the ingredients of said tea in one John Watson. Oh, who was he kidding. In all likelihood, Sherlock had already done that experiment years ago.
Looking around the room, Sherlock saw most of the other guests assembled off to the side, watching the spectacle with a mixture of annoyance and interest. Some of them had clearly been drawn away from their breakfast by the argument. Certainly the Walczaks looked like they regretted leaving their coffee behind.
"I'm sorry," Haley said softly. "But I want you to know you're always welcome when you want to come home." Her tone became teasing. "You can bring your Psy flatmate. That would give them something to get their tails in a twist."
A gentle breeze blew in from the sea, bringing with it the taste of salt and seaweed and the sweet, heavy scent of the lilac blooming around the edge of the garden.
"See you tomorrow, then," John says. "And text me if any interesting cases come in. Christmas always has the most interesting murders. Remember that thing with the Christmas cracker?"
"I've got a couple of promising ones." Sally stares down into her mug. "It's going to take a while to sort through all of them. We really let things slide while he was gone, Greg."
The car they had arrived in was already waiting for them and the driver hurried around to open the door, allowing them all to pile into the expansive back seat. Mycroft's nameless assistant got in the passenger seat, already typing away on his phone. John wondered if he was related to Anthea or if phone addiction was a job requirement.
He comes home to find Sherlock in the sitting room, lying flat on his back and holding Rosie up in the air above him, making plane noises at her. Rosie shrieks and giggles, waving her arms and kicking her feet in obvious delight.
Several seconds passed in which the only noise came from John and the biscuits crumbling in his mouth.
Sherlock smiled. “Even then. Funny you should say that, incidentally.” He gestured at the sitting room. “Mrs Hudson and I already made a start yesterday. We spent some hours reading old case files and compiling a list of people who uttered threats against you, me or both of us.”
"You have entirely too much fur," Sherlock commented, using one hand to direct the spray and the other to carefully comb through John's fur with his long fingers. "How did you manage to soak up so much mud in so little time?"
Sherlock, who was already crouched beside the body to confirm what they all suspected, looked up in confusion. "What does that have to do with anything?"
Finally, his words run out and he blinks, his distant gaze refocusing on Mrs Hudson's kitchen. Holmes looks startled for a moment, and it occurs to Sally that he never meant to tell them as much as he has.
John stared at the leather with a mix of contempt and apprehension. He didn't like the idea of anything around his neck, but intellectually he knew that a collar was necessary. He huffed a sigh and resigned himself to his fate. At least it would only be for a little while.
Sherlock frowned. "He bled from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth, just like the others. So why is this one different?"
"I will help you carry him inside," Mycroft said. "You are not in the right shape to get my brother up these stairs on your own. Unless you were planning to drag him?"
The chair he had been sitting on creaked as John stood and Sherlock turned, deliberately keeping his gaze just a couple of inches to the left of him to at least give the appearance of looking at him without actually doing so. "Let's get this over with. Redbeard, stay."
Sherlock sighed. "It wasn't your fault, John. I was so desperate to see you, I didn't consider your feelings at all, or that a less public place might be a better idea. I just wanted to see you, and so I did. I have only myself to blame for what happened."
There was no blame here, just understanding and ... relief. So much relief, coming from John. Relief and hints of something else, something Sherlock was afraid to learn about but that also had him reading more, wanting to know every last little detail.
Someone noticed that Sherlock was bleeding and someone else mentioned that Rosie should probably be checked through as well.
The man was eyeing John with the tense look of someone not used to being around dogs. "Let me make sure I have gotten this right, first," he said. "You are Mr Sherlock Holmes, are you not?"
Coming home felt like breaking through the surface and taking his first gasp of air, his lungs aching.
Sherlock struggled into an upright position and accepted the glass of water and the fast-acting headache relief with a murmur of thanks.
Sally shook her head. "Nothing helpful. We haven't heard back from the labs about the DNA results yet and our accountants have barely started sorting the data we got from the vic's company, never mind actually going through it all."
"Down the back of the sofa," Sherlock added. "Really, I should have looked there immediately. People can be as clean as they like, but no one ever cleans down the back of the sofa. It was only a matter of time until something relating to the child slipped down there and was overlooked. Any good parent has more than one soother on their person at all times, so he would not have noticed one of them missing or, if he did, not bothered to spend much time looking for it."
They sit in silence for a while, digesting that. Sally is still struggling with the concept of Sherlock Holmes caring about other people but all the evidence points in that direction.
She watches a shadow cross his face and hates herself for reminding him, so she decides to quickly change the topic.
The first brush of John's mouth against his made him freeze, the second made him gasp. By the third, he had managed to get a hold of John, both his hands bunched in the soft wool of his jumper, and was kissing him back rather desperately.
"I believe it to be some form of taunt," Sherlock said. "It appears to be a phrase commonly used by humans and changelings when trying to call a domestic cat towards them. It is no secret that John is some form of cat changeling. I had him deduced within moments of our first meeting."
He shook the thought off; it wasn't really relevant right now. Perhaps later there would be an opportunity to further examine this phenomenon, but right now he had a double murder to solve and a Detective Inspector to pester for more data.
"My apologies," Sherlock said, his voice and face as expressionless as he could get. After a couple of seconds, even the anger in his scent was damped down as if Sherlock had turned off a tab somewhere.
"Yes, you should have," he said tightly. "In fact, you yourself are not someone who should go and get drunk at random, just because you can. Getting you away from the drugs was bad enough from all I heard, I don't need to have to try and keep you away from the bottle, too."
Someone groaned, it wasn't quite clear who - perhaps both of them - and John had some trouble extracting himself.
Sherlock nodded. "Most of his victims are male but not all of them. Women tend to stick to one victim profile and follow it. Then there is Psy physiology to think of. Psy choose potential sperm or egg donors very carefully based on various factors. Physical beauty is one of them as it gives people an advantage over their peers. It's why the Psy are proportionally more attractive in the eyes of humans and changelings, though we lose the advantage due to our general demeanour and lack of emotion."
Sherlock watched as he paced and wondered if John was aware of the fact that his behaviour was getting increasingly cat-like with each passing day.
"Which is why I have just activated my homeless network," Sherlock said calmly. "People on the street see and hear things even the Foxes never learn about, and they notice if some of their own go missing. Most of the time they just relocate, but it wouldn't be the first time a serial killer starts out by practising on those members of the population that won't be missed before moving on to victims with a higher profile. If that is the case, there will be other suspicious deaths out there."
"Of course," Wiltshire said. "Wouldn't want to get you in trouble with your man, eh?" He shuffled his feet. "Listen, uh, he doesn't get abusive or anything, does he?"
John had never been supposed to find out. Well, not like this, anyway. And admittedly the chances of him finding out in the one way Sherlock would not have minded quite so much where below zero anyway.
John stared down at the Psy looking up at him with wide, innocent eyes, and wondered what he had ever done to deserve this incredible man in his life.
Mrs Hudson opened the door and they both heard her greeting someone. A moment later, Lestrade's voice floated up the stairs.
Mrs Holmes nods sadly. "My son has changed a great deal in the last couple of years," she says. Her tone makes it clear she doesn't necessarily consider all of it a good thing.
He knew this because he was plastered to Sherlock from head to toe (which could probably be considered acceptable as it wasn’t the first time this had happened) and also, more pressingly, because one of his hands was quite warm indeed.
"I did not realise you used touch as another way of communicating," Sherlock said, sounding put off with himself for not having noticed. "It seems there is an entire language to this. You will have to explain the different meanings to me."
They got a random officer to conduct the interviews in the administration building behind the church. Lestrade was right there but no one wanted to give people an opportunity to claim bias, so Lestrade would not be taking the lead on this one, at least for now.
Sherlock had never thought that one day he would have to beg help of a changeling pack instead of vice versa.
The sudden absence of a half-naked, warm body caused an interesting mix of relief and acute disappointment as John felt himself cool down both literally and metaphorically. He knew he was the one who had said they had time and could go slow and he wanted Sherlock to be sure, but he would be lying if he didn’t admit he also just wanted Sherlock, period.
Another flare of blackness eclipsed the stars in the Psy's eyes. "His psychic energy will have recovered in the next twenty-four hours. He will spend most or perhaps all of that time asleep. Do not attempt to wake him and make sure he is well-nutritioned once he does."
"As I already said, if I can decipher your thought process, I may be able to emulate it and thus solve cases more efficiently without having to consult you on changeling minds."
It had been so long since he had been in a relationship, since he had actually cared about the person in bed with him, but this was different.
Sherlock could hear the worry in John's voice. Talking to Mary, then. He didn't bother to stifle the pang that went through him.
Angry nonsense. Get it out there. Get it out, pour it onto the page like poison out of a wound so it can no longer kill you where you sit.
And before John had a chance to berate him for his casual disregard of personal boundaries, Sherlock had turned around and was walking back the way they had come.
John nodded. "Are we ready?" he asked Tyson, who had taken his place at the comm controls. "When are they going to call?"
They were just cleaning up after having invited Mrs Hudson up for dinner and were now washing the dishes side by side. She had tried to get involved, of course, to thank them for the lovely evening, and Sherlock had tartly informed her that her evening would be all the lovelier if she didn't start doing any work now and she had much better relax. Mrs Hudson had translated this to mean 'go down and have a herbal soother' and had promptly done so, leaving him quite alone with John.
He didn't bother pointing out that he would do it anyway. Let them make up their minds on their own. He would not let this cub die. He hadn't needed John's various statements that cubs were the most precious thing to a changeling, treasured above all else.
"Not yet," she said. "The Council is clinging to power. I don't know what's going on exactly and of course no Psy would ever tell us. If they're still in the Net, they're not close enough to any changelings to keep us informed, and if they're out of the Net, they won't be getting any more intel than we do."
John's mouth was doing a very complicated thing that looked like a grimace but also a smile and there was an emotion being expressed there that Sherlock couldn't identify. He didn't even know where to start, and then he felt his thoughts go fuzzy and hastily tore his gaze away from John's lips.
He made himself focus on the steady sound of the sea rolling in, the rush of the waves on the sand, the calls of the occasional seagull, the buzz of the bees in their hives.
Sherlock shrugged. "I'd like to get some more information about the other guests, see if there is something about them we don't know yet."
They gasped into each other's mouths when their bare chests finally pressed together, fingers digging into waists and trailing along sharp hipbones.
"Forget it," Sherlock hissed. "I don't have the time. John's wedding is in two days and eighteen hours!"
come if you need me. Either of you. I know you and I aren't... we don't..." He broke off, apparently unable to put into words what exactly they weren't or didn't do, before returning to the point he had been trying to make. "But I will always come for her. She's my goddaughter, John. You
He didn't even bother with the shoe laces and simply pulled them tight and stuffed them into the shafts of his boots after pulling them on. It would do for the walk to the car.
But John was still shaking his head and reached out to cup Sherlock's face in both hands, making him meet his gaze. "No. Because I might not have said so and lord knows I've tried to pretend I didn't, but I've looked at you that way, too. I lost you once and it nearly killed me. I won't lose you again. And I absolutely refuse to lose you when neither one of us wants me to get married to a woman I met only a year ago."
"He'll never come back," he whispered once he managed to get his voice back. "He's gone already and I can't bring him home no matter what I do."
He turned away, located the closest CCTV and saluted it before disappearing off the grid. If Mycroft thought he could track him, he was sadly mistaken.
Seeing his raised eyebrow, the detective shrugged. "You did save my life tonight and I do appreciate a useful helpmate. I'm sure we can come to a mutually satisfactory agreement."
Startled, he looked up. Sherlock hadn't moved at all and his eyes were still closed. His body was tense. His voice sounded horrible. "I don't want it anymore."
A whimper that would have been embarrassing if he hadn't been so far gone emerged from his mouth, an almost-sob caught in his throat.
John was full-on giggling now. "IKEA tried to copy the goat in Iceland and it promptly burned down thanks to faulty wiring. I swear the entire universe has it out for this goat."
After that accidental, unintentional kiss, things seemed a bit awkward for a while. It's not that Sherlock was avoiding him, not at all. He stayed in the room when John entered, he didn't make up obviously false excuses to disappear. But there seemed to be a bit of distance between them anyway. Nothing too noticeable. An extra inch between them on the sofa, Sherlock choosing the chair opposite from John rather than sitting kitty-corner as he normally would at restaurants.
He looked like it wasn’t easy for him, either, Sherlock thought, finally glancing at the Detective Inspector. He looked haggard and tired. This clearly wasn’t how Lestrade had wanted this day to go, either.
"Your feelings are the most important thing in the world to me," he found himself saying. "I only ever wanted you to be alive and happy as well."
"I changed my mind," Sherlock told him, quite superfluously considering their current position. "I changed my mind the moment I realised you shot the cabbie."
Well, and of course there had been that time when John had physically assaulted a newly not-dead Sherlock in a posh restaurant, a less posh restaurant and a late-night kebab shop. Somehow, he felt that didn't really count.
John's head was ringing, he felt half-deaf and mildly nauseous, but it hardly mattered because all he could think was that after days of wishing for his own body back, he now found himself wishing to be a dog again or to at least still have a dog's olfactory sense.
He barely managed to hold it together until he heard John leave before he stumbled through the bathroom door and started retching. He retched and retched until there was nothing left in his stomach, until his body matched the emptiness in his head and his breathing came in short, desperate bursts.
Sherlock, mildly surprised, reached out and shook it firmly before moving to scoop up John. "Come on, Johnny. Let's get you home. I'll have to tell Lestrade if he has a nice murder for us, he'll have to relocate the crime scene to the flat."
"Of course you do. You always do." Sherlock smiled. "I felt that. And then... it was as if he couldn't reach me properly anymore. It was exhausting him. He kept demanding to know what I had done."
Sighing, John toed off his shoes and curled up on the bed. At least his army days had taught him the valuable skill of falling asleep at the drop of a hat whenever he had the time. He closed his eyes and drifted off...
Lestrade tipped his head back, sniffing the warm air. "Nah. It's a beautiful night. Think I'll just run home, actually. Care to take my clothes for me?"
The DI got halfway through saying so again, but the light finally turned green and traffic moved again, much to everyone's relief.
He couldn't deny him anything, never had been able to, so Sherlock did as he was told until his breathing calmed down a bit.
He lowered himself until he was crouching in front of the other man, his back pressed against the door, his face inches from Sherlock's thighs. The detective had already unbuttoned and unzipped his trousers and succeeded in pulling them down at least part of the way, but John immediately recognised the problem. Wet pants were best taken off by carefully pulling at the hem to prevent the fabric from bunching up and getting even more difficult to peel away from the skin.
