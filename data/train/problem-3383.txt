The grooming he came to realise was his attempt to present himself for others’ pleasure.  It also had been a shock to admit. He wasn’t an idiot; he knew he’d be considered an attractive man.  But now there was an urge to be pretty, to physically appeal to a dominant.  It sat wrong with him. He was not meant to pose and seduce. The urge to give in to the submissive desires fought his learned behaviour to be strong and independent. But without his parents’ disapproval and the numbing of the medication, he found himself being drawn deeper into his newly unearthed self.
Dena was too sore, too afraid to really pay attention to what was being said. He recognised the gruffness of the voice, and the layer of concern hidden under it.  It made him wonder how much time had passed for Rufus to have come check on him. He also felt a wash of guilt for causing the older man troubles.
So that took a turn to the left and away from where I thought it was going to go. Characters became actual people in Dean's life and no sign of Castiel.  Oh well, I'll get them there.
It was that sense of impending doom that had him in the car heading back to the family home.  He’d usually resist his mother’s care giving, convincing her usually with John’s help, that he would manage on his own.  But today, his father remained closed off to him, and Dean just didn’t have the energy to resist.
Dean understood it, he really did.  For one, Sam was a teenager.  He was deeply concerned in the opinions of is peers.  It was a normal rite of passage.  Plus, he knew being a sub made him weird, an inconvenience and problem.  He couldn’t expect Sam to deal with that.  But he had started to miss his brother, and that separation only grew.
But it was such a big risk.  Bobby had explained it in his usual no punches pulled manner.  It would mean losing his family.  He knew this was probably going to happen anyway, but knowing it as a one day thing, and consciously choosing it were two different things.  As he sat in the dark though, he was able to acknowledge the hard truth. He loved his parents, his brother, but they could not love him in the same way.  His diagnosis had built a wall between them that they were unable to demolish.
So now as he stood in front of Singer’s Garage and Scrap Lot, wondering what would come of his job he loved so much, Gordon brushed past him.  While Dean was not blocking the entrance, considering it was wide enough to drive a car in, somehow, as always, Gordon managed to push into him, shoving him forcefully out of the road.
Dean knew they had had many arguments.  But, in the end, Dean’s persistence and John’s outright refusal to change his mind had worn her down.  She had never been happy about Dean moving out.  She saw nothing but tragedy coming from the move.  Even as he excitedly moved his belongings into his new apartment, she assured him home would still be there when he failed.
Wednesday, the following week, Dean got to meet Garth.  Dean, at first, thought the other man was sick as Garth looked sunken in. So at the beginning Dean had been cautious around Garth, watching the man in case he had need for something, that Dean could take care of. But only after a few days, Garth started to win Dean over.  Garth, fragile looking, proved to be so full of energy and enthusiasm.  It drew Dean in, making him unable to resist.
“All puff I tell you” Garth grinned. “I slept at the desk for most of the first month.  Rufus made sure I would take my medication and go to my doctor’s appointments. Other than that I was left with a soft blanket.”
When they parked in front of the garage, John rested his hand on Dean’s arm, awkwardly removing it when Dean turned to look at him.
His work routine started early, arriving before everyone.  He set the coffee on, although admittedly that was just as much for his benefit as for Rufus and Garth.  By the time Garth arrived, Dean would have the mail collected and in piles on his desk. Over the weeks he’d also started to take control over his own work schedule.  Instead of waiting for Rufus to assign things, Dean had stepped up, relinquishing Rufus of the responsibility, freeing up the man’s time.  Dean was now contributing to the smoother running of the business.  When he returned home at the end of each day, he began to feel a sense of ease settle in, from the service he could see bringing to Rufus.
“Yes John, but Dean is a sub.  It hasn’t been obvious, but he’s a sub regardless of what you want to believe.  Now the treatment is failing, that’s going to change. It’s all going to be seen by everyone, and Dean… Dean’s going to change.”
By the time Sam was 15, having a sub for a bother was an embarrassment.  He no longer wanted to go to the movies with Dean.  Only going when their mother insisted.  Sam would slouch deep in his seat, glowering at everyone. There was no longer excited whispers passed between them.
“What are our options?” Mary asked, as she glanced over at the silent Dean.  He could see the tears glistening in her eyes.
Alongside work, Dean also began to create a social connection. It was small and fragile, but it felt like a beginning. Every Sunday, Dean would put on his good jeans and best, or at least cleanest shirt and walk along to the dinner.  At first he’d sit quietly in one of the booths, keeping to himself. But time moved, and so did he. Now when he turned up, he sat at the counter.  He’d come to know Jo, the young waitress.  She had been raised by her parents in a rough as nails roadhouse and was now in the city going to community college. He enjoyed flirting with her, arguing about music.
Bobby had been a friend of the family for as long as Dean could remember.  He was practically family now. He owned a scrap yard and mechanic’s shed.  When it became clear that Dean was not best suited for the academic path, it was Bobby who stepped up and offered to teach the boy all he knew about cars.
Dean glared at the obnoxious blaring of his alarm as he reached over to smack it.  It took a moment for the awareness to seep into his sleep numbed mind.  The clock flashed 6:00.  He had managed to sleep the night through for the first time in months.
It had taken all Dean’s will power not to cry, but he refused, not in front of Gordon, not willing to prove the insult had hit its mark. But he did his coffee, returning to his office and remained there since.  He’s managed for the most part to avoid Gordon, but when their paths crossed, Gordon never failed with the disgust look or pointed barb.
“John, you can’t say that, you can’t stop this.”  Mary’s voice matched the brokenness in John’s voice, hers also showing a level of grief.
Bobby had faith in him.  He said he would not be offering this chance if he didn’t think Dean had it within him to fight and win.  But it was all an unknown. The drugs had given him security.  He had been told it was the drugs that enabled him to pursue the life he had. Without the drugs, what would he be?  But again, as he flicked the card over and back, he kept returning to the knowledge that the drugs were failing, and soon they would not work at all.  Was giving them up such a big risk?
“Like hell!” Bobby’s gruff voice rose, anger showing briefly.  It made Dean pull into himself.  He heard Bobby sigh.  “There’s always a choice.  No before you interrupt, I know what your Father said Dean, I know your disability is said to be taken over and you need full time attention and caregiving.  Well I say bullshit.”
Dean had noticed Gordon’s eyes tighten, and the smirk form on his lips.  But they had been friends, Dean reminded himself, surely all that would not end simply because Dean had an illness.  He hadn’t seen Gordon the rest of the day.  When he returned, the part he’d been waiting for had arrived, and that kept him busy until Bobby shooed him off home.  The next day, Dean took his morning break, sitting down at the shared table with his coffee.
A few weeks later, Gordon arrived. He’d been hired as a replacement for Dean’s previous job.  The two men hit it off. Their shared interest in engines and cars formed the base for Dean’s first friendship outside the family.  Dean looked forward to his breaks, listening to Gordon’s stories, sharing opinions of old and new cars.  He had started to imagine this ordinary safe life of work and comradery.
Garth nodded, slowly unwrapping the long scarf from around his neck.  Even in the warmer West Coast, Garth seemed always to be wrapped up for the warmth. Dean had originally thought Garth was unwell, with his thin lanky frame and feeling every chill in the air.  But the man always seemed brimming with energy and effervescence.  If anything, he seemed the epitome of wellness.
When he thought of his own small apartment it was still pretty simple.  Dean was not a collector of things.  However, he could be found in the things he did have.  There was the growing collection of vinyl records that he had spent hours, scouring through second hand and retro record shops for.  It wasn’t simply is specific taste in music but also the search for the right album cover and liner notes.
Dean was brought out of his thoughts as the doctor handed Mary a new prescription. “These should help with the side effects.”
Dean leaned forward, straining now to hear John’s angry voice.  The words when they came sounded broken.  “My boy is not going to be some perverted slut.”
“No boy, not what I meant. All those tests, all those special needs you’ve got.  That stuff’s real. You’ll always have to live with it, but that’s what I’m saying, that you can live with it. You just need to … recalibrate your thinking.”
Returning to work the next day, Dean could feel his nerves jangle. Had Bobby just been waiting?  Would he fire him?  Or was it something worse?  Instead the man lead him out back, to the work bay he had spend yesterday working in.  Nothing much had changed.  The frame Dean had been working on remained in place.  While Dean had tidied up before leaving, his tools did remain where he had left them.  However, to the side the large storage closet had been turned into a cramped office. With a gruff explanation, Dean had started his new career, car renovation.
In the end Bobby just nodded and told him to get home since it had gone dark. It had not been a good evening for Dean.  He knew he should be happy, should be glad nothing bad had come from his choice.  But at the same time there was an itch, a need he couldn’t name.  He’d read enough of the pamphlets about his illness, and the lessons driven into him by his parents to know his restlessness was his submission trying to take over.  But no matter how much he tried to ignore it, it didn’t want to go away.
Dean has grown used to these snide comments, had learned to brush them aside and get on with his life. He had refused to let Gordon have that sort of power over him. But today, with his dream dying around him, he felt himself sag under the weight of it. Fortunately he made it to his office before the first tear fell, not letting anyone be witness to his misery.
Later in the day, Rufus had come back and packed Dean into the car and driven him across town.  It was there he had met Dr. Shurley.  The Doctor had seemed to be part of whatever organisation Dean was now a part of.  He’d given Dean a very thorough physical examination before sitting him down to discuss what would be happening next.
Dean continued to sit in silence.  While his grief fuelled the silence, there was also surprise to hear his usual taciturn boss offer such open praise.
“Pretty much.”  Rufus waved to the seat opposite him. “I am glad you are doing better Dean. Now things are settling down with the meds. We, well, you are going to have to start dealing with the symptoms, with learning to live with your disability.”
The gruff voice was back, hushing him.  It made Dean wonder if he had spoken that out loud. While the voice had all the gruff edges, the hands that moved him back to the bed remained gentle. His body ached in weird ways, feeling brittle and jagged. Dean was aware of his own pitiful cries as he was moved, but really, he was just too exhausted to resist. It did make him wonder how long he’d been sick before today, how deep into denial he’d pushed himself.
The drugs Dean was on were quite extensive, and many of them were quite damaging to his body.  In an ideal world Dean would be slowly weaned off them, but they couldn’t risk prescriptions being traced back to the Doctor’s practice.  Dr Shurley, (call me Gabe, Dr Shurley sounds like my Dad) had gone over all the symptoms Dean would be facing, giving him a daunting list of what to expect over the following months.  A part of Dean was terrified by it, but also the Doctor’s, Gabe’s calm manner, the confidence he was placing in Dean to handle it, seemed reassuring.
The corner of Cas’ mouth lifts, but he quickly goes back to looking a little more somber. “I thought I was going to die in Purgatory. I was waiting for you by the rift and then I heard your prayer, all of it, and I thought hearing it would kill me, and I’d never even get to see you again. Or tell you what happened.”
“Because,” Jack says again. He looks up at Dean, sadly. “I… I wanted him back. The whole time, I missed him so much. And I wanted him here. But… I don’t even understand what happened, when he went. I know the Empty was supposed to take him when he felt happy, so he must have been happy. And maybe… that was for the best?”
He finishes his juice, puts the glass in the sink to be washed later. He’s the only one doing any fucking dishes around here, anyway. “Alright, Jack,” he says, and pats his shoulder when he passes him on his way back out. There’s a lot more to say, a lot more to deal with, but not here or now. And probably not with Jack. He pauses in the doorway, decides to ask, “Hey, are you staying for a bit? We could watch a movie.”
He joins Cas back outside, pats his shoulder while he pockets his keys with his other hand. “You did great,” he says, embarrassingly earnestly, but he doesn’t think he minds, not here or now. Despite his own bullshit, he feels sort of like he’s initiated Cas into something, or like something has shifted a little between them. Which is stupid, because all he did was let a friend drive his car, but Cas actually does light up a little at the praise, and it doesn’t
Dean rouses from half-sleep to a knock on his door. He checks the time on his phone, finds out he’s been lying here for two hours. He says, “Yeah?” and Jack comes in.
And that’s—too fucking familiar. When Dean was 27 and newly orphaned, no one could have told him it was his dad’s choice, that Dean wasn’t to blame for it. He wouldn’t have listened. He’s not sure Jack will listen, either, but he has to try. “Cas chose to do that, Jack. That’s not on you, I promise.”
Sam speaks before Dean’s even gotten through what that means. Says, “Wait, really?” and if Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think he was sounding
Cas staying right now doesn’t mean staying indefinitely. They still have to find Jack, and who knows what they’ll have to deal with after that. Cas might leave at any time—might leave
to fight, to keep going, and I was so mad at you. Even while I thought I was losing you, and it was going to be the last time I’d get to talk to you, I was so angry.”
Cas helps Dean stand, which is not the rescue Dean had been planning, while Jack explains that the Entity is gone for now but it will be back, so they have to hurry. Dean staggers in place once he makes it back up on his feet, and he has to put a hand on Cas’ shoulder to keep from keeling over again. He still smiles though, big and real and bloody, when he says, ”Hey, Cas. I’m here to grip you tight and raise you from perdition.”
ready to go automatically, but he thinks he might be bleeding internally, and all the repenting he’s gotta do now that
Dean thinks of a childhood spent in lonely motel rooms and months on the road without a word from John, but that doesn’t matter either. That’s not the kind of parent Cas is.
Cas follows along with greater focus than anyone should afford Dean’s attempts at education, and at the end quietly repeats, ”Turn signal,” to himself, like Dean’s comment meant that that was the most important part and he doesn’t want to forget it.
like some fucked up juxtaposition of when Cas had looked at him, freshly resurrected in a barn, and told him
Somehow, cosmic beings seem to have a tendency of seeing straight through Dean these days, because even though he voices exactly none of that, Cas still says, “I won’t force you to talk about it, Dean, but I want you to know I care about you.”
“You know the job, Sam,” Dean pushes on. “We’ve both always known. And now that we’re no longer the main characters of Chuck’s shitty pulp fiction, that really is what we’ve got to look forward to. Normal-for-us, permanent deaths. You know that’s all there is.”
Then he remembers that if Chuck was to be believed, this might be the only universe—out of however many there was—where Cas loved him back. He’s really not sure what to do with that thought.
something that makes him feel all warm and fuzzy, or whatever. “Yeah, dude,” he says, to cover up how flustered it made him. “I taught Sam how to drive, I know my shit.”
Dean clenches his fists. It’s Cas’ voice, Cas’ face, but it’s also so clearly not. Dean hasn’t allowed himself yet to think about missing Cas, but he does now—misses him so much. Made worse from how close they are. “Yeah, we’re here to get Cas,” he says, gritted. Not a very good bossfight one-liner, but he's got other things to deal with right now.
He makes it far enough away from the kitchen to know that no one followed him, and then he attempts to put a fist through a very sturdy bunker wall. It doesn’t work, and the pain doesn’t help.
Until Cas puts a hand on Dean’s forearm and finally pulls out the face that somehow always works wonders to make Dean want to tell him things, all tilt-y and soft and caring, and, well—that’s just cheating.
now. And it’s not like entering portals to find someone and bring them home is anything new for them. He can deal with that. And whatever comes after, he can probably deal with too.
a lie. And it’s not all he’s ever had. There’s Cas. Jack, now sans god powers. A whole lot of other people he’s met through the years—Jody and Donna, Claire and Kaia, Garth and his family—people that mean a lot to him. And he’s got a fucking GED and a give ‘em hell attitude, or whatever.
“Oh, then, by all means,” Dean says. He’s been better at not getting angry, or at least at not blowing up, but it’s starting to build up underneath his skin.
“Okay,” Sam says. He takes a breath. “Dean, you do know that there’s more for you, right? More than guns blazing and dying bloody?”
. He vaguely remembers bleeding all over the upholstery in the backseat. Then he wakes up in a hospital, one emergency surgery and many blood transfusions later, and he’s still alive. Not the first time he’s had a near-death—or full-death—experience he wasn’t expecting to survive only to find out he did, but this is one of the least fun ones.
, and he would have thought there just wasn’t any light, if he hadn’t been able to see Jack perfectly well in front of him. How are they even going to find Cas here?
Okay, maybe Dean walked right into that one. He scoffs, trying to seem like he’s amused, and not like he’s finally stumbled upon what might be his least favorite part of tonight’s talk. “Hah, yeah. Been there, done that, actually. Made Sam cry, and then it turned out the shrink was a shapeshifter.” At Cas’ look, Dean backtracks. “But, uh, story for another time. Cas, s’not like you gotta 5150 me, man. It was just a hunt, really. And Billie of all people told me I’ve still got work to do, so.”
“I’m glad,” Cas says. Dean feels himself flush, but the very last of the tension finally bleeds out of him. He hugs Cas’ arm closer.
Cas and Sam finally look up at that. “You alright?” Sam asks, with genuine concern that just serves to make Dean feel even more pissed.
Dean rolls his eyes to dismiss whatever feeling that brought up in him. “Don’t say shit like that. I’m the one s’posed to be worrying about
. It’s maybe unnecessarily mean, and also too honest, but again—it’s already obvious. He’s not proficiently hiding anything from Cas, ever, but especially not right now. No way he’d take
Sam greets him by knocking once and then immediately throwing open his bedroom door, asking, “Dude, did you seriously drink all the beer?” He looks happy, relaxed, and Dean is about to attempt to make fun of him for it even through how bad he feels, when Sam fully takes in Dean curled up under two blankets, and his face drops. Now he just looks worried. “Are you okay?”
Dean is resolutely not looking at whatever Sam’s face is doing, but he can’t miss his careful tone. “Yeah?” he asks, softly, like he’s trying not to startle Dean into retreating.
recall. Yet, at least. He has been reliably informed by his doctors that any memory loss is likely temporary. Though it sure does sound like something he would do.
Cas silently peers down at his feet, hand still hovering over the ignition, before he seems to admit defeat and asks, ”Which one is the brake?”
Then Jack sits them down at the war room table and explains what they’re going to do, in not very many words. Dean is pretty sure it’s been condensed for his sake. Sam will open a portal, because that’s apparently the easiest way in. Jack will wake up Cas, and rebuild him, and bring him here. The plan cuts off there, so Dean figures his own role in all of it is up to him—prepare a welcome back party, or hide out in his room, or straight up just not even be here at all.
want, now. I know we said it after Chuck, but things still kind of went back to how they were before. And that’s not how it has to be.”
was implicit, but Dean knew perfectly well that it was there, the same way Cas knew what Dean hadn’t said out loud.
He considers whether or not he should take a bow now and fuck right off the stage. He could just go straight to his room and lock the door and stay there forever and not even acknowledge that Sam is still sitting here. Exit, pursued by the terrifying prospect of having to talk even more about how he’s feeling.
Eventually, he does spot an exit sign with an additional sign for some shitty fast-food chain, and his stomach growls urgingly, so he shakes himself out of his minor funk and says, “Hey, turn off here.”
Cas waits for Dean to put the glass down, and then he gets back up to refill it again. Dean takes another sip when Cas hands it back, but after that, he leaves it on the table in front of him. Cas seems to take that as his cue to finally start a conversation. He says, “Are you okay, Dean?”
, and-- well. It’s just Cas, Cas who just had to comfort Dean when he should be worrying about his own shit, who’s Dean’s best friend, who deserves better. Cas, whose hand is lingering on Dean’s upper arm. Cas, who always leaves.
”A hunt,” he finally admits, the part that’s already a given. ”A while ago. Got impaled on some rebar.”
you, is how it’s supposed to work,” Dean says. He gets up from his chair, ready to leave or to punch something, or maybe to lock himself in his fucking room and pour himself a drink. “How is everyone acting like I’m the one in the wrong here? Were you all in on this already?”
There aren’t any other universes anymore, but Dean wonders if there used to be one where he actually kissed Cas the first time he wanted to. One where he was a little less emotionally constipated, a little less repressed, one where they didn’t have to go through all this shit before he could show Cas that he’s loved.
This—this is how Dean remembers it, what he’d imagined when he’d thought about the Empty. This is what took Cas. It swirls around him, a slight shift of a different shade of black among all the other black, barely discernible. Then it starts moving towards where Jack went. Where there is now a bright light.
“Shut up,” Dean says, and then he’s out of his chair. He detours past his bedroom to get his jacket, flask and all, before he joins Jack in the library. He feels jittery and nervous and maybe not actually ready at all, but they’re
He looks abruptly away, goes quiet, but he doesn’t think Cas notices. There’s not really any need for further instruction now, anyway, not until it’s time to exit. He lets Cas drive for a little bit longer, and lets Zepp fill the silence.
He sits down on the edge of the bed, back to Cas. He doesn’t take his shirt off again, instead letting Cas lift it up. When he does it’s feather-light, barely touching Dean’s skin. Then Cas softly rests his fingertips over the scar tissue. Dean wonders if he’s going to heal it, but the feeling never comes. It’s possible that Cas won’t do that without his consent—and Dean is never going to ask him to.
Dean has sat up all night, staring at the piece of cardboard in his hand. Seven digits that could ultimately change his life.  If he was just willing to take the risk.
“It’s not what you do as much as doing something that your brain interpreting it as service and it will release needed chemicals to keep you in balance.  Having a dominant would cause you to release the right levels. Until now, those levels were created by your medication.”
Dean tensed.  He had known his mother would try to get him to come home, and that his life was going to change, but he’d manage to fool himself.  He hadn’t thought about losing his job, about losing his career.
Dean doesn’t realize he’s about to say, “It’s never going to end, Sam,” until he’s said it. His voice shakes a little bit, he’s not sure why. “Until—you know, it ends.”
What he ends up settling for is, “Dude, I actually don’t wanna talk about it.” Back to what comes naturally, the previous part of this conversation just a momentary lapse. Cas being dead, and whose fault it was or wasn’t, doesn’t even explain why he’s having a breakdown right
Dean curls up even more, which is fucking pathetic, but he’s self-aware enough to know that this isn’t a fight he can win. Better to endure it, protect what he can, keep the Entity away from Jack so that he can get Cas, and then they can get out.
Dean sinks back down on the chair just as Cas says, “Please talk to me.” He looks-- sincere, is the only word Dean can think of for it. Not frustrated, only a little bit sad.
It’s unexpected enough that Dean doesn’t already have an answer ready on his tongue. He wants to ask
He starts by looking for Cas in the library, then the kitchen, then the Dean cave, even though he knew he was going to find him in his room. He finally knocks on Cas’ door and lets himself in to see Cas sitting on his bed, fully clothed—trenchcoat and everything—reading a book that looks suspiciously like something that went missing from Dean’s collection of old stolen library books ages ago. It’s
He gets out of the driver’s seat and rounds the hood, handing his keys over to Cas who reluctantly accepts them when they cross paths, and then he gets in on the passenger side instead.
. But he wouldn’t have been—Cas was already back, then. From what he told them, he was back before they even found the case in Grand Junction. Dean’s smile slips.
“Yes,” Jack says, as his eyes light up yellow again. The Entity just watches amusedly, eerily like it knows it still has the upper hand here. Dean has no idea what to make of that, and there’s nothing for him to do about it, either—nowhere for him to channel all this nervous energy.
“I’m not gonna…” Sam starts to say, then pauses, tries again. “Like, I don’t mean anything by this, I’m just--. Saying. That you can tell me anything, Dean. You can always talk to me.”
What also happens is that Dean keeps up his drinking like nothing changed. So he’s a little bit drunk and hiding it when he’s trying to cook dinner for himself and his brother, enough for Cas too in case he’s feeling up for joining them and tasting molecules or whatever, and that’s when everything spills over. Like absentmindedly pulling off a scab, and then before you know it you’re dripping blood everywhere.
Cas studies him, in a way that makes Dean wonder if he’s trying to read his mind—but he’s pretty sure Cas can’t do that without touching him, probably. And even then, he doesn’t think it’s something Cas tends to do. Maybe things wouldn’t have turned out this way, if he did.
He can feel Cas watching him, but at first he almost thinks he’s going to drop it. The weird contradictory mixture of relief and disappointment that that stirs up lasts until Cas asks, “What happened?” And that’s the second attempt at getting Dean to open up, so, alright. Fine. They’re doing this.
The Empty-- well, lives up to its name. It’s somehow also not what Dean had expected. All he knows about this place is that this is where angels and demons go when they die, so obviously he’d assumed there would be angels and demons around, like another version of Purgatory. But everything around him stretches out black and endless and
Billie smiles—except it’s a little bit more of a smirk. “Well, I was dying. And I have once again had a change in perspective. With God gone now, there are bigger things to take care of. The world is in desperate need of a revamp. Jack came and talked to me about it, and we happened to share similar views.”
. Dean melts into the touch, his eyes flutter close. Then suddenly Cas lets go and scoots back on the bed.
“Thanks, Cas,” he whispers, even though he disagrees. It’s what’s easier, right now, when he’s warm and tired and Cas is here, no matter what happened before—what Dean did or didn’t do. Right now, he can allow it.
. Out loud, he only says, “You’ve thought about this.” If it sounds accusatory, he’s not going to read into it. He’s reminded of when he’d just gotten Sam back. When they were in their 20s and the biggest problem they’d tackled was Dad going missing, and Sam told him he wasn’t going to stick around when they were done. That he had other plans for his life.
”I know, uh,” Sam starts. His face does some gymnastics, probably trying to figure out how to phrase this as delicately as possible. ”I mean, I thought you were doing better. After we were done with the whole Chuck thing. Now that we’re finally on our own.”
Dean hasn’t seen Jack since he walked away after everything with Chuck, and somehow he’s surprised to find he’s still the same. Jack pops up in the bunker like he’d never left. He wants to see his bedroom and help Dean make dinner. He’s really excited about Miracle still being around, plays with her until they’re both tired. He’s just a kid—another thing Dean realizes he hasn’t been thinking about.
And then he realizes it’s not true right now. Usually, he can talk to Cas—sure. Today, with Jack gone and Cas only very recently back from the dead, there’s no way Dean can put this burden on him any more than he already has. Cas doesn’t need that, Cas needs Dean on his A-game. Needs him painstakingly looking through fucking CCTV footage or combing the internet for a glimpse of anything that could possibly be Jack.
”Uhm,” Dean says intelligently. He doesn’t know why he’s so reluctant to tell Cas about this. It’s far from the first time he’s gotten hurt on a hunt. Far from the first time he’s almost died.
The next day he finds a news article that hints strongly at a rawhead in Blue Ridge, so he texts Garth to ask if he knows any hunters who might be in the area.
, which, well—yeah. That’s news to no one. He’s wanted to die plenty of times. Bobby’s called him out on it, Sam’s called him out on it, just-- never quite as bluntly as Billie had.
He avoids every room that could possibly contain alcohol, and somehow ends up in the garage without really thinking about it. At this point he’s already starting to breathe steadier, but Baby could use a wash, anyway. It’s methodical, it puts everything else out of his brain.
Dean shakes his head quickly. The movement strains his healing wound. “Yeah, just give me a second,” he says.
Dean opens his mouth, about to go for a witty retort or a bad joke, and comes up with nothing. All he’s ever had is hunting, living out of the car, his little brother. And Sam might have dreamt of other things, but Dean never got to.
Dean forces a smile. “Feeling’s mutual,” he says, and gets another hit for his troubles. Then the Entity straightens up, letting go of his shirt. He crumples back to the ground, barely able to hold himself up.
Where does he even start? There’s so much he’s been piling up and pushing down and not talking about for
Dean gestures in the direction of where the portal was. His eyes are closed, though, so he doesn’t know if he got his point across. “Cosmic entity,” he adds, just to be sure, his words a tiny bit slurred.
In a way it’s a good thing too, because if Sam had been less busy with worrying about Jack he would have had more time for worrying about Dean, and that’s a conversation Sam had absolutely been building up steam for, Dean knows. Sam probably would have taken his shoelaces and started checking on him in 15-minute intervals already by now, and he might have gotten Cas in on it too—as if he needs to know what Dean gets up to when Cas is gone—if other things hadn’t popped up and vied for everyone’s attention.
Dean had grown nervous as the week drew to an end.  Too many questions remained unanswered.  There were too much he didn’t know and couldn’t control.  It left him twitchy and anxious.  He knew the sub-part of his brain sought the reassuring weight of another’s guidance, the certainty that came with following instructions. But every time he told himself his instruction was to wait, the other voice wondered, yeah but what next.
“No Mary.  Not our boy, he’s not going to become… he’s not like that.  Our boy will not become like them, like … those people.”
“Don’t be silly, Dean, of course I know. I might not have known at first. Rufus takes in the lost puppy. He hired me at a time when many people still didn’t want an HIV positive person working for them, let alone one that was still often sick. Hmm, yeah, that’s me, so you know.”
Dean stood for a moment, staring at the building.  He remembered the first day he arrived here. The nerves that buzzed through him were only enhanced by his father’s warnings to not dishonour the family, or Bobby’s gift at offering to teach him a trade.
Also since Rowling said she made Lupin's werewolf an analogy for HIV, I thought I would make Garth's HIV an analogy for his werewolf.
Seeing Bobby leaning at the door, looking bemused, Dean’s submissive instincts flared.  Would he be punished?  He had worked on this car without permission, should he submit to Bobby, accept the punishment he had obviously brought on himself.  But while that part of him screamed for resolution, for forgiveness, he knew he must never give into it.
“You didn’t know?” Garth continued. “I figured Rufus just likes to hire sick people and wait for us to get better.”
Bobby sat down at the desk, placing a bottle of whiskey and two glasses between them.  Dean glanced at the clock, it had barely past nine.  But he shrugged, it was one of those days and he no longer gave a damn. He accepted his glass, drinking it in silence.
Dean had sat down in the small lunch room, looking through the worksheets when a mug of milky hot tea was placed in front of him without a word. Rufus didn’t say a word, just left Dean with the workshops and the sweet tea. Eventually, the tea finished, Dean headed into the workshop.  He knew Rufus wouldn’t push him further, and he also knew his body would only allow him so much, but Dean slowly started to work.
“Dean…” John started and then looked lost for words.  Dean waited but eventually, John just shook his head.  “Have a good day.”
Finally living alone had been such a blessing for Dean. He’d been lucky.  Using the argument for normality on his father had brought John to his side.  John wanted a son who could be independent, who could overcome any handicaps.  Part of that was to live alone.  Mary, on the other hand, had been horrified.  Her little boy wouldn’t be able to handle all the demands of an uncaring world.  He would be unprotected.
Dean heard Mary sigh.  “And how long do you think that’s going to last?  How long before Bobby fires him?”
He’d also developed a budding friendship with the dinner’s cook. Benny had taken a look at him on his second visit and decided the younger man was in need of a good feed.  He hadn’t been completely wrong.  While Dean was able to prepare the basics, cooking was a skill he had yet to learn.  So, his reliance on microwaved meals, and his body detoxing had left him underweight and pale. Apparently, that was enough to bring out the maternal side of Benny, along with plates of fried chicken and potato salad.  Now every weekend, Dean would head down for a full lunch, and a few hours spent in enjoyable conversation. Dean realised, although with Garth from work, he’d actually developed friendships for the first time in his life.
He’d left the doctor’s office with a bunch of prescriptions for vitamins and supplements, and a as required anti-anxiety medication.  He would have a monthly scheduled appointment with the doctor to make sure his body was handling the changes, and also, Gabe offered with a quiet empathy, a place to discuss the transition.  Dean had had a hard time getting a read off the doctor, he seemed both empathetic but also quite irreverent.
So now, even though Dean worked in a workshop that didn’t look like it had been cleaned in a decade, he took the time in the morning to shower and shave.  When Rufus had dropped him at a local department store to get clothes, he’d even picked up a cologne, dabbing it on in the morning. He’d gotten the expected raised eyebrow when he’d gone into work, but Dean could also sense a whiff of approval.
Garth cut him off “Different things maybe, but still surrounded with misinformation and bigotry. And you’re sick right now, so I’m going to help you.  Its as much about me paying back for what I received as your own needs.”
Dean glared at the reference to lost lambs. He had assumed that there had been other people in his position. Over the last few months Dean had spotted a few reminders around his apartment that pointed to other people living there.  One had especially caught his eye. Resting his head against the coolness of the porcelain he’d spotted words scribbled behind the toilet.
It wasn’t that his parents had denied him things as he grew up. Dean was well cared for, and he believed, in their way, his parents still loved him.  It was just since the diagnosis they had stopped seeing the point in encouraging him to pursue hobbies.  Dean, they knew would never achieve the full life of ordinary people.  So they just forgot to give him the same opportunities to explore himself.
More scarily, running would also mean leaving behind the numbing security of the medication.  Bobby had been blunt about that too.  The risks were high that he would not be able to cope without the chemicals that contained him.  It would be hard work, alone without them, he would have to ensure he gave himself what he needed to keep his biology and mental health in balance.
Dean had blushed and fumbled, humiliated by his lack of privacy. Dean had wanted to keep his illness private.  Of course, Bobby had known, but Dean had not wished for it to be public knowledge.  But his mother’s concerns and fears for her son had blocked her from seeing the impact it may have on Dean’s life.  She was just unable to see Dean as a person outside of the family, or indeed pursuing a normal life.
Dean snorts. “Yeah? I’m just gonna apply for a mortgage with—with Cas, then, I guess? Get a little house with a picket fence, live out some bullshit domestic fantasy? Not even hunt anymore?”
Movement in Dean’s periphery makes him finally look up. Cas is leaning forward, trying to catch Dean’s line of sight, and he looks more concerned than Dean has maybe ever seen him. “Why?” he asks, voice so soft and careful. It’s not condescending, per se, but it’s not the kind of treatment Dean wants. He’s just about well-adjusted enough to know that no one would be angry at him for this, but between Sam’s quiet attempt at comfort in the car after Colorado and Cas’ gentleness now, Dean kinda wishes someone would yell at him, instead. It would be better if he could yell back. But it wouldn’t be fair to get angry now.
Jack seems to realize that’s a concern Dean would have. “I’m going to bring him out,” he explains unprompted, and his eyes start glowing.
It’s not the most surreptitious move, and at this point he’s definitely been quiet for too long. Cas asks again, ”Dean? What happened there?”
going over his head right now. “How did you even spring a deal with the Empty?” He turns to Jack. “I’m assuming it wasn’t very happy with you.”
The hard part that Dean was waiting for begins after that, it seems. Dean isn’t going to pretend he understands any of this spell business, especially not something this complicated—Sam is the resident witch here, even if he doesn’t tend to admit it—but he does understand that it isn’t easy.
Cas disappears from his side for a moment, turns off the stove when he passes it—right, Dean had been cooking, probably might have to figure out a way to tell Sam they’re getting takeout today instead—and comes back with a glass of water. That’s kind of funny too, for some reason, but Dean won’t argue. He drinks it all.
, and he would, it’s maybe even true, but it just won’t come out. It sticks in the back of his throat.
to come out of his mouth, but it turns out he doesn’t even feel that way anymore. He thinks Jack was prepared for it too, which reminds Dean once again of what a fucking dick he is. And Mary
Slowly, Cas’ hand keeps moving up underneath Dean’s shirt, until he curls it around Dean’s shoulder, close to his neck. He squeezes lightly, presses his thumb into Dean’s skin right next to his spine like some kind of half-approximation of a massage. It’s
Dean eases back into hunting by ganking a couple of ghouls in Topeka with Cas, and it’s a quick enough hunt and short enough drive that they skip out on checking into a motel and instead make it back to their own bed by early morning.
Dean laughs humorlessly. “Bet you thought you’d live forever,” he says, ignoring how it makes his chest tighten.
“I’m sure it is, buddy,” Dean replies, “but it turns out we might’ve some other stuff to deal with first. Like,” he pauses, looks around, then tries, “What’s that sign?” pointing at the closest one he can see.
The thing is, Dean’s worked through this. He actually has, and maybe not in the healthiest, therapy-y ways Sam might have tried to get him to. And maybe not the whole sexuality part, or the whole admitting-it-to-others part, but definitely most of the Cas part. He’s known for years now how he feels about Cas and ended up deciding that he’s okay with it. He just could never tell how Cas felt, if it even mattered—always figured Cas couldn’t feel like that at all. Dean’s repertoire with angels doesn’t include very many friendly conversations, but from the friendly conversations he has had, it wasn’t hard to come to that conclusion. Angels don’t experience emotions the same way humans do. Cas doesn’t experience emotions the same way Dean does.
“Okay,” Jack says, and leaves the kitchen. Dean leans back against the door jamb, takes a moment just to breathe.
Cas’ parking job could definitely use a lot of work, but he didn’t mow down anything or cause any dents or scratches, so Dean calls it a win. He still finally shoos Cas out of the car and takes over himself though, because Baby draws a lot of attention, it would be embarrassing leaving her parked all crooked and taking up more than one space where anyone could see her.
Jack helps gather the ingredients they didn’t already have while Dean sits uselessly nursing a beer in the kitchen. Drinking is-- weird, right now. He’s not at an all time low of alcohol consumption or anything, he’s still treating it mostly like usual. There’s a flask in the inner pocket of a jacket currently draped over the desk chair in his room, a bottle of whiskey on his bedside table, and the beer stock in the fridge is fully replenished. It’s just that now it’s inexplicably started to feel like something he shouldn’t be doing. He’s sure Sam would have some well-chosen words to say about it, if Dean told him. Dean is definitely not going to tell him.
Dean sits up against his headboard. “What’s up, Jack?” he asks, aiming for soft in a way that comes significantly easier when he reminds himself that this is a child he’s talking to. It’s probably something he really could afford to remember more often, but it’s the most clear in moments like this.
For half a second he suddenly thinks he’s about to kiss Cas after all. It hits hard, and it’s far from the first time, but-- then the moment breaks. Cas is crossing the room to the sink, about to get to work on Dean’s cast iron skillet, and the sound of the water turning on gets Dean out of whatever trance he was apparently in.
. It’s way too much to admit, and too much like putting the blame on Cas, and he can’t do that. Could put it on Jack, for a while, before he got to know him. Can always, always put it on himself.
Dean sheds his own flannel and t-shirt and Cas’ billion layers, and then Dean has Cas underneath him on the mattress, kissing his way down his chest while Cas buries his fingers in Dean’s hair. He moves away for a moment to awkwardly untie their shoes, to get his jeans and Cas’ slacks off, and then he’s back again, hovering over him, grinding his hips down to meet Cas’.
If drive-throughs were better adjusted for American muscle cars he might have taught Cas how those work, too, but as it is he makes him pull into the parking lot instead, plastering on a grin that is almost all real when the car rolls to a stop and Cas looks up at him expectantly.
If Dean was physically capable of laughing right now, he would. “I think I’ve stopped enough apocalypses to have a say.”
Dean can feel Cas’ slow breaths in little puffs against his neck. One of Cas’ legs worms its way between Dean’s. He hesitates for only a second, and then he grabs Cas’ hand and laces their fingers together. It’s a lot, almost too much, having Cas this close—letting Cas be this close. But the most overwhelming part is how much Dean wants it. How much he wishes he could have had it earlier. Before any deals with the Empty, before any life-or-death love confessions.
“So I went through Rowena’s stuff,” Sam keeps going, doesn’t seem to care or notice that Dean has gone mostly monosyllabic. “Tried to find a spell like the one Nick used to bring back Lucifer, when… yeah. But I couldn’t figure out if it would wake Cas up first, if he’d even need to be awake, and then he’d need a body, and I didn’t--. I couldn’t figure it out. So then I finally talked to Jack about it.”
wears off—there are other things that require more immediate attention than whatever’s been gnawing in the back of Dean’s head. He stays to finish the case and spends the whole time with a Jack-related knot in his stomach, worry he never expected to feel for Lucifer’s son, and when he gets back to the bunker he gets to enjoy about two more seconds of post-hunt elation and then he’s knocked to the ground and the weeks-old nephilim kid they were all responsible for is gone.
”Yes. Okay!” Dean claps his hands, which visibly startles Cas, which happens to make Dean aware of how close together they’re sitting. Right. He moves back a little bit to his side of the seat but lets himself keep his knee pressed against Cas’ thigh. Reassurance, or whatever. ”Well, I think you’re set. The rest of it we’ll deal with when it comes up.”
Dean stands up with a groan. His back is still sore, Cas only took care of the newest damage. And then three pairs of eyes greet him when he opens his own. Like he’s supposed to be the one to conclude all of this.
is just out of reach. He wants to say it, but he settles for licking it into Cas’ mouth, mouthing it into the skin of his jaw. Then Cas breathlessly says, “I love you, too,” and it hits Dean that he
”Right, so,” Dean says. He moves into Cas’ space and stays there, too busy to overthink it, and points out everything that’s especially vital for now. ”Brake and accelerator. Use your right foot for both. Gear shift. Speedometer. Turn signal. Don’t wanna be the asshole that doesn’t use the turn signal.”
He thinks his chest might be imploding. Or maybe exploding, with the way his heart is trying to beat out of it. It reminds him of that Looney Tunes case they worked, with the guy whose heart leapt out of him. It was funnier back then.
our time in an underground bunker. And not yet, just—you know. Someday. And so could you, by the way.”
Alright. Not a conversation to have while still mostly-lying down. Also, not a conversation Dean would think Jack would want to have with
Sam is still not making a sound, or any noisy expressions that Dean can discern. Dean is starting to regret telling him to be quiet, it might have been easier not running this whole thing by himself. He’s also aware that he’s not even really saying anything that Sam doesn’t already know. It’s the same story he told Sam back when it had just happened, only in a few more words. And it might have to be enough for now, he realizes, because it turns out he might not be ready to talk about it after all.
He’s still looking a little nervous, even more so now that they’re going faster, both hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel and posture all rigid—though it’s not like his usual posture is very relaxed—but he’s enjoying himself, Dean can tell. Dean leans back in his seat, reluctantly losing the contact between his knee and Cas’ thigh, and cranks the music up a little louder. He’s enjoying himself too, he realizes, looking at Cas, and then he realizes exactly what situation he’s gotten himself into.
“It wasn’t a bunch of shit,” Cas says, as if that’s the part to latch onto here. He puts the book away, gets up and stands several feet away from Dean. It’s unnerving, somehow—still, after all this time—Cas’ attention on him.
Until Jack suddenly says, ”I can feel him,” and the craziest thing is, Dean’s pretty sure he can too.
Dean had figured it would be Cas, here to finally talk about everything that happened. Or maybe more likely Sam, for the same reason. Jack closes the door, and then stills right in front of it. He looks—subdued, is the best word Dean can think of for it.
sneak out of Cas’ bedroom—he is almost 42 years old—he just--. Was maybe hoping not to bump into anyone, while leaving Cas’ room in a normal, not-sneaky fashion. He’s only just closed the door behind him, though, when Sam rounds the corner down the hall.
One of Cas’ hands drops down to the hem of Dean’s shirt. “Can I see?” he asks, and Dean feels like he’s in a haze when he nods a
Sam makes the kind of face he presents to victims and witnesses when he’s trying to get them to trust him on a case. Gentle, sympathetic, and completely fucking infuriating to Dean. “After everything you’ve already done, why is that still your responsibility?” Sam asks, but it seems to be rhetorical, because he plows on, “Heaven and Hell are closed. Sure, there are other monsters, but there are other hunters, too. The world is not on
”That’s what Sam said. I understand.” Jack smiles softly. “I’ll miss my mom,” he offers, ”but I talked to her, and she said it was a good idea.” He hesitates for a second, and then he says, ”And I talked to Mary. She agreed, too.”
“No soap in that,” Dean says, even though he knows that Cas already knows that, and then he adds, “See you later,” and finally leaves the kitchen.
He looks up carefully, terrified of what he’s going to see. But what he sees is Jack running towards him—Jack and
It was infinitely more fucked up to remember when he still thought Cas was gone forever, but it doesn’t feel too good right now, either. Even with a week of distance between Dean and what happened. Maybe especially because of that week. Because he got to hear Cas’ voice again, got to
Sam grins right back. “Good thing Rowena doesn’t have easy access to the bunker, I owe her 20 bucks now.”
Cas turns back to the dashboard, hand almost by the ignition again, when Dean stops him with a, “Wait, hold on, not so fast.”
”Dude, you sound like you’re reading off a fucking checklist,” Dean says, in lieu of having to contradict Sam on any of his bulletpoints. The purpose of acting all healthy was not because he wanted to be able to prove Sam wrong the second he commended Dean on how healthy he’s been.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks, and when Dean says, “I don’t know,” he pulls him in closer, kisses his forehead in a way Dean won’t ever admit is soothing. And as Dean starts drifting off to sleep, he lets himself consider it. Consider living somewhere else, consider not hunting. Maybe he’ll ask Cas about it someday.
They go back to comfortable silence, until Cas speaks again, asks, “Did you stop drinking?” apropos of nothing, like it only just hit him.
him, not like anything’s changed since they last saw each other, and especially not like someone else’s poor imitation. It’s exasperated mostly, Dean thinks, a little worried, maybe a little happy underneath all that. Not any of the true happiness bullshit that landed him here—it’s just Cas. Something he’s picked up over the years, something kind of human.
And hey, if he’s not going to lie, he might as well just fucking go for it. On a good day—and most bad days—he can trick himself into thinking he has a filter, but now he’s too exhausted to even try to ease into it. He says, ”I tried to kill myself.” It’s surprisingly easy to tell the pure truth for once, to not drape it in jokes and deflections and
. “They’re already gone, Dean,” he says, sounding like he’s explaining the concept of death to a child. “If they’re in Heaven they’re stuck in a highlight reel, and you know better than anyone here what it’s like if they’re in Hell. Is that what you want?”
Jack nods, and then he suddenly moves forward to hug Dean again. Dean strokes his back, lets him cry into his shoulder, like he used to do for Sam—like he hasn’t done since Sam was still at least a head shorter than him.
Cas’ eyes are shining with tears, just like the last time they were alone. In over a decade Dean had never seen him cry before, and now he’s making him do it all over again.
Dean’s laugh slips out unbidden. “Shit, not now,” he says. “Few hours before I found out you were back.”
The light turns green, and Dean continues talking Cas through every road sign they encounter, how far over the speed limit he can drive according to the speedometer without it actually being too fast according to a traffic cam, how to merge onto the freeway—and then Cas pretty much has the hang of it.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “You my therapist now?” he quips. It’s not so much a wall he’s putting up, not with Cas, but maybe something like a moat with a faulty drawbridge.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I must have misheard you,” the Entity says. “I thought you said you were here to get the angel, but you couldn’t have, because he’s
Dean is pretty sure his heart is breaking, what the fuck. When he opens his mouth he has no idea what to say. What eventually does come out is, “We… have some things to work out. But I missed him very much, too. And Jack, none of that even matters. If you want him here, he wants to be here. For you. He’s your dad.”
, I’m disappointed,” it says. “I’ve heard great things about you,” it pauses for a punch, blood starts running thick from Dean’s nose down the back of his throat when his head leans back. “I have to say you are not living up to the hype.”
He gasps through the pain, presses his forehead into the cold ground, and he takes it. Jack will be back soon, Cas will be here soon. Just a little bit longer--
Dean nods again, in thanks this time, and moves to leave. When he passes Cas he reaches out to pat him on the shoulder, but Cas just catches his hand. They stand there in silence for a few moments, Dean’s hand between both of Cas’, and then Cas lightly squeezes his fingers and lets him go.
“You know when, uh,” he starts. He stares down at his hands in his lap, picks at a cuticle. “When Chuck zapped away everyone in the world except us. And I came and met up with you, and uh. And… Cas. I told you Cas had summoned the Empty.”
But Cas, apparently a traitor, interrupts him. “If Heaven is just another version of life but better and eternal, what’s the point in living here? What’s the point in making Earth better? What’s the point in hunting, in saving people?”
him. Actually, you know what, Dean really can’t stand it. “Okay,” he says. “Say what you wanna say.”
“I’ll be here when you get back,” he says, like that was a concern he knew Dean had. Dean realizes it was.
His body hurts even through the morphine. He’s annoyingly nauseous the whole time before the anesthesia fully wears off, but even once he’s out of post-op and has been wheeled into a regular hospital room, he feels like shit.
He’s forgotten about the scar until the millisecond before Cas’ hand reaches it, and then they both freeze.
“My point is, it’s your life, Dean,” Sam says, when Dean doesn’t reply. “And if you wanna keep living here and keep hunting the same way we always have, that’s your choice. I don’t want that, and that’s my choice. Everything else I said is just, you know. A thought.”
to talk about it. Naturally, it would take a piece of rebar through his back and a deathbed plea right to his brother’s face to let him die before he’d feel like opening up.
He slots a Zeppelin tape into a boombox he bought specifically for the garage, so he wouldn’t have to drain the Impala’s battery if he wanted to listen to music while working on her. When he’s done, she’s all shiny and polished and beautiful, and he feels better.
Cas does what he says, bringing the car to a surprisingly smooth stop in front of the light. Then he looks up at Dean, and he
One more thing he needs to do. Homestretch. Somehow, this is the slightly easier part. “Sam, I wasn’t meaning to die back in that barn,” he says, a little more blunt than intended, and Sam goes still. Dean continues, “It was just, you know, really seeming like it was headed that way, and I wanted you to know it was okay.”
“You changed me, too, Cas,” is what he finally goes for. “I mean, you gotta know that. And I—I can’t… I’m pretty sure there’s no way I’m ever going to be able to put it into words the way you did, ‘cause I can never say shit like this, but… I’m trying here, for you, ‘cause I need you to know how important you are to me. You’re my best friend. And I’m sorry for how everything turned out.”
Billie seems to realize that’s what he’s thinking of, because she then smirks and says, “Hello, Dean. Castiel. My apologies for our last encounter.”
Dean never should have said anything in the first place. Shouldn’t have had a panic attack in the bunker kitchen. Should have died in that haunted asylum or shouldn’t have tried to at all. Should have included his own life in the bargain with Billie, so she never would have read him like an open book and told him he needs to live because he’s important. He’s not.
“Like… almost-died bad. Like, goodbye-speech-to-Sam bad. And, well, you know how those go. He didn’t think it was fun, either.”
” he asks, feeling like he’s right back in the archive room even though he knows Cas is sitting safely next to him. It’s not the exact same thing, maybe, but it’s still a family member being taken away from him by a fucking cosmic entity.
“Shut up,” Dean says. “It was the first psychiatrist I could think of.” Then he turns his head away again so he doesn’t have to look at Sam when he says, quietly, “And I know.”
Dean starts looking for cases again, even if he doesn’t feel up to it yet. Things are going to go back to normal—the kind of normal they were right before he almost died, at least—so it’s time to start acting like it. It looks like there might be a shapeshifter killing people in Provo, but when Dean suggests it to Sam all he gets is a look and a, “Dude, you’re still healing,” which is fair enough—so he forwards the link to Claire.
“Stop,” Dean interrupts. At some point he’s gotten up from his chair without even realizing. He stands there for a second, undecided, and then he makes up his mind and leaves. Sam doesn’t follow.
“You had given up, Dean,” Sam says, and Dean can tell from his voice that he’s about to cry. “And I don’t know if it was just… everything, or if it was Cas--”
Jack walks determinedly into the portal without further ado, so Dean turns half-around to salute Sam behind him, and then he steps inside too.
Sam is alternating between making worried faces and pretending that he’s not still freaking out even with Dean clearly out of the woods. He’s been talking at length about some hunt Eileen’s been texting him about because he seems to think Dean needs the distraction, or maybe he needs it himself, when Dean weakly interrupts him to ask, “Hey, Sam, what actually happened out there?”
They set off, the Entity hot on their heels, only for it to abruptly appear in front of Dean, blocking his path. Without even thinking, he throws a punch, and is surprised to find it connecting with something solid. Even if the only damage done is his own knuckles splitting.
of some of the things he could be telling Sam. His hands are shaking. So, deflection, then: “Thanks, doctor Jacoby.”
like Cas, but it throws Dean off guard. Then he’s busy dodging the retaliating punch, and catching the next one to the stomach. He doubles over, goes down on his hands and knees. Fucking supernatural beings and their supernatural strength.
“‘Course. Just, you know,” he says, and makes an almost flapping gesture with his hand that doesn’t even come close to its intended meaning—
They’re parked outside a gas station, where Dean had just bought coffee and topped up the tank, and where, when he got back in the car, Cas had blasphemously admitted to not knowing how to
“Yeah, if I knew I could do it without anyone getting hurt,” Dean replies. “If the threat was over. But that’s never going to happen.”
”’Operate an automobile’,” Dean mocks under his breath, complete with an eye roll. ”Okay, get out, we’re switching places.”
. He gets out from under the covers, straightens them out so that his bed is passably made and only a little bit to stall, sits down with his feet firmly planted on the floor, and pats the spot next to him. “What do you mean?” he asks while Jack moves to sit.
Dean’s been back home for a week when he finally confronts Sam in the bunker library. He’s been spending most of his time sleeping off almost-dying, slower to recover in his old age and all, but finally in the past few days started sending Sam out to get groceries so that he could start cooking again—back to something that resembles normality at least a little bit. Mostly he’s not been thinking about what Sam said at the hospital. Then his whole death speech started to come back to him, and now he
”First order of business,” Dean says, ”driver picks the music.” It’s a sacred principle, that mainly exists because the driver tends to be Dean—but it’s not like Cas can choose anything that isn’t Dean’s classic rock tapes, anyway. Well, technically, Sam keeps his tapes in the car too—his screamy feminist punk from when he was an angsty teen and his screamy early-aughts emo that he brought back with him from college, and even, despite Dean’s insistence that he would burn those particular tapes, the terrible glam metal he’s somehow always liked—but he seems to think Dean won’t make fun of him for it if he hides them all as far back in the trunk as they can go. So, point is, Cas won’t find those unless he goes looking, and Dean is safe in upholding the house rules today.
He looks back at his car like she’s going to be able to tell him what happened today, or how to proceed. She doesn’t—but Dean’s stomach does, with another insistent rumble, and cheeseburgers
But then one lunch time, Mary had turned up to take Dean to the specialist.  Dean had noticed Gordon’s intrigue at what was going on, but had managed to divert it, making excuses that he may be too drowsy to drive afterwards. He could tell Gordon was suspicious but had taken Dean explanation at face value.  It might even had worked if Mary hadn’t spoken up, reminding Dean in front of Bobby and Gordon, that they would need to check if all this new responsibility wouldn’t aggravate Dean’s submissive status.
On the days when Dean’s body would shake and he wouldn’t have the strength to stand at the work counter, Garth would appear at his side. The other man would push him into a chair. Dean would find himself distracted and food in his hand without him realising it. Garth always seemed to know what Dean would need, and managed to get it through Dean’s shuttered defenses.  Rufus may have been the quiet steward running the progress of this new life, but it was Garth that seemed to always be at Dean’s side.
Dean snorts at the word disability. “How will I know?  I’ve never been without the drugs, I don’t even know anyone else that’s never been on the drugs. It’s all uncharted for me, and to be frank, I don’t have a clue what’s going on.”
Therefore when the first symptoms started to happen, he hardly even noticed them.  The slight change in his appetite, the wavering of his focus could easily be overlooked, or explained away.  Life was hectic, maybe his body was becoming more healthy, less in need of grease and sugar.
He’d known this was coming.  Gabe had explained it to him, in detail.  But sitting comfortably in a doctor’s office was very different from experiencing it in real life. His body had felt like it was waging war against him.  Dean pulled the towel down over him, keeping him warm as he endured through that first night.
Dean nodded but he knew the truth.  When treatments stopped working, it was permanent. It didn’t happen often but when it did it was practically a death sentence.  They would eventually lose everything and end up institutionalised.
Unlike John, who was only willing to see Dean as normal, Mary was unable to treat Dean as anything but her sweet 4-year-old child. Her horror at that image being shaken made him sink back into himself.
When he arrived in Jericho, the first afternoon, danger seemed everywhere.  He had broken laws by leaving without notifying his guardians, but refusing medical intervention.  Until Bobby had suggested it, he hadn’t believed such things were possible.  But regardless, he knew the penalty, if caught, would be high.
Dean thinks that it surprised everyone, himself included, how quickly he managed to pick up things. On one day, when Bobby he stomped in, locking himself in his office, Dean had been left to his own devices.  Without anything specified on his work list, Dean had found a chassis in a work bay and had started to tinker. Tinkering quickly became focused work, to the point Dean didn’t notice the day passing as he worked on rebuilding.  It was not until he heard a cough from the door way that he had realised it had gone dark.
Dean’s eyes are suddenly stinging. “Well, lucky you got to explain it before you did die,” he says, sarcasm falling a little flat but there nonetheless.
set, which does nothing for Dean’s confidence in letting someone else drive his car, but this time when Cas turns the ignition he is indeed pressing the brake, and the engine spins to life with the purr Dean’s been in love with since the moment he felt it in the pedals under his feet for the first time. He finds himself hoping Cas likes it, too.
. And Dean really just can’t have that. It doesn’t matter that Cas is an angel, or that there’s an apocalypse looming, or that the only one alive besides Dean allowed to touch his baby is Sam and even he is on thin ice—this is something he has to remedy.
Then he says, “Hello, Dean,” and Dean realizes exactly how wrong the Entity had his voice. It didn’t even come close to the real thing.
“So, basically,” he says, trying to wrap it all up like a thesis conclusion. Hey, would you look at that, Sam. “Cas-- is gone. Oh, fuck it, Cas died. For me,” wait, shit. He revises that. “To
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean groans, but he kind of ruins it a little bit by smiling. He knows Sam has been walking on eggshells around him for a while now—by comparison, this is a lot better.
He finishes his beer, pops the cap on another one. When Sam comes to get him he’s on the tail end of his fifth, in a relatively quick succession, but it’s not like he really feels it anyway.
Then he’s just waiting for a long enough moment without any hospital personnel around to ask Sam what happened. He’s got the general story down—vampmimes, saving a couple kids, getting fucking
“That’s what I’m talking about!” he says, maybe a little overly enthusiastic. He looks over at Cas and catches him smiling shakily, which makes it all worth it. “Alright, keep your foot on the brake and shift into drive, then ease up.” He points to the D on the gear stick, not taking any more chances, and then they’re slowly rolling forwards.
“I know you’re still going to make my terrible tofu scramble,” Sam says, but his face still shifts into something softer. “You okay, Dean?”
Cas joins him in the kitchen too, steals sips from Dean’s coffee even though he doesn’t actually like it, while Dean makes himself some food. Sam hears the racket and comes in with a laptop and what is probably another case, and they’re discussing it when Jack suddenly shows up. With
“Yeah, well,” Dean says, and it turns out he’s about to cry, too. “You were dead. Hard to know, then.”
The day after that, he settles down with his laptop in the library to start going through his Google Alerts emails again, when Sam comes in and interrupts him.
Jack looks back at Dean. He’s crying quietly, but he’s smiling a little bit too. “Thank you, Dean,” he says. Dean doesn’t think he’s done anything worth
When Dean wakes up it’s past lunch, and Cas is still right next to him. He doesn’t sleep, but he figured out pretty quickly that Dean likes having him there for now—and it only took one mishap where Dean woke up to a cold bed after a nightmare that reminded him way too much of black goo and bloody handprints. Dean’s working on it, but Cas doesn’t mind staying with him.
Then there was his comic collection.  Once hidden under his bed so as to avoid comments of the childish nature of his interest.  Now he had them out on shelves, organised in relation to distributor and order of publication.  Of course, living alone now made it less exposing, but he no longer had an urge to rush to hide them.
So as dawn broke, he stood up.  Taking out two suitcases, he looked around the room.  His whole life was in this small apartment, and now he had to make it even smaller.  Clothing was more practical, the essentials he needed to live, along with the ratty t-shirt that had become almost a pacifier as he slept.  But he turned to look at his collections and had to decide.  He couldn’t take them all and some things he knew he would have to abandon. Books that he’d secretly clung to were the first packed, and then he looked to his music.  The bunch of cassette tapes rattling in a box seemed more practical than the album collection. He had an old temperamental cassette player, that was probably an antique by now. Sam had always said he’d get him the digital version to make things easier, but other things had always taken priority.
“You gave us quite a scare, you know,” Garth continued. “Rufus phoned, said he needed help.  You had gone into some kind of shock, took a fit. We probably should have taken you into hospital, but well, you know, that would have ruined everything.”
That first week had been one of nervous inactivity and solitude.  He had understood the week alone was not a punishment.  Bobby had made it clear it was for his own safety, to disconnect his arrival in Jericho from his disappearance in Lawrence. That has been something he had to constantly remind himself in the first few days, especially when fears of being locked away in a place worse than Fairfields had crept in his mind.
He rolled over on his back, staring up at the ceiling.  When he first arrived in the new town, anxiety had clawed at his brain, making sleep an almost impossibility.  He would wake multiple times, his brain telling him danger was just outside the door.  Even now, three months later, that anxiety still crept around the edges.
He knew it was much worse for dominants.  While adults talked in hushed terms about out-of-control aggression, kids would make lewd jokes about sex crazed retards.
He’d really felt confident, the next two days he started to settle into the possibility of his new life. Able to leave the apartment, he explored the area around the workshop. At first he headed out on foot cautious not to get too far from the safety of his own home. There wasn’t a lot to discover.  The area was mostly industrial, workshops and slightly dilapidated office buildings. The next day, he took the car, widening the search. He’d felt his heart raise as the fear grew.  As he drove, there was a constant call to run back to his new home, to hide away again. But he’d promised Bobby that he would push forward, that he would overcome and he couldn’t back out with such a simple task.
Sam and him had been close as brothers.  The four year age gap had Sam looking up at his other brother.  It was Dean that taught Sam how to tie his shoe laces, how to catch a ball, and even on one memorable occasion, climb the tree in the backyard.
Dean grimaces at the mental image of Garth bouncing off the walls. “So are you saying I just have to go around bringing people coffee or getting their mail and I’ll be fine?  That does not make any sense.”
Dean looked to the door, angrily wiping his face on his sleeve. He’d hoped he’d have more time.  He’s foolishly thought he would be the one to tell Bobby.  But he knew that’s not how his life would work now, in fact it may never have really been his life.
“You’re damn good at your job, boy” Bobby finally spoke. “I’m not one for pity.  I gave you the job here not because your father asked, but because I saw potential. Those old wrecks, they speak to you, and you have the uncanny knack of knowing what they need.”
“We know a few things, from experience. Some of it we are starting to see,” Rufus nods to the cup Dean had placed in front of him. “Acts of service, taking care of those in your life. Especially without a dominant to focus on, you may end up pushing yourself too hard, trying to serve too many people.”
As Dean watched his father’s jaw tense, he knew these results meant he’d failed his father. He’d worked so hard to make his father happy.  He lived alone, gotten really good at his trade.  All those quiet whispers in his head, he’s managed to keep hidden.  Hell, Sam, with his shaggy hair and fancy clothes looked more like a disabled sub than Dean.
Dean wandered upstairs, stopping outside his brother’s room.  It remained unchanged since Sam went off to college.  Dean wondered now that Sam had been accepted into Law school if he’d ever return.  His life was moving him in his own directions, leading him away from is family.
