“Good thank you. Here, have a look.” Mary withdrew her hand from her pocket, taking a step or two closer as she presented her palm. John scooted towards the edge of his seat and leaned. He’d personally removed the stitches just over two weeks ago and the resulting scar seemed to be developing quite nicely. The scar itself was uniform, raised and a warm rosy pink at its deepest end, but showed no sign spreading. By the time it descended and turned pale, there would barely be any indication of the injury at all.
, laying there quiet and almost seductive looking in the low light thrown from a nearby standing lamp.
His eyes narrowed and without further wait, worked the string apart and ripped open the back seams, careful to keep the front of the wrapping intact. As the paper fell away, Mycroft was intrigued to find his sense of smell hadn’t fooled him and a tin of Turkish tea lay beneath.
.” She abandoned her fruitless search to coo through the tiny bars. “Does my little sweet have the sniffles?” She tutted, releasing a string of squeaky kissy sounds and wiggling a manicured finger in the dog’s face.
They ate lunch sitting side by side, John taking a passive participation in the conversation and letting Mrs. H ramble on. He found himself complacent to just sit back and hear about the goings on of Mrs. Turner, or her ‘married ones’ though the landlady fell abruptly quiet at that, seeming to catch herself and glancing to him with a drawn up bottom lip. “Sorry.” She broke, voice a little shaky, her hand clenching in her lap.
The sleeves and waist of the sweater were knitted from a washed out red yarn while the chest area was darker, royal blue in color. The attempt was to depict a living room at Christmas time with a fireplace made of bright orange yarn near John’s right side, and a large tree made of green yarn by his left and spanning up his chest towards the collar. The tree itself was “decorated” with tiny multicolored pompoms at each branch end and at the center were four faceless representations of children trimming it while a fifth child held the crooked ladder they joyfully scaled.
“Sherlock—alright, stop right there. I don’t hate you.” John cut in. He unquestionably felt a host of things toward the detective but none of them were anywhere near
When John drew back to see him fully, Sherlock looked positively edible. Flushed high along his cheeks, lips pinked and a little swollen from kissing and spread in a challenging smirk, his sharp eyes a touch glassy, pupils narrowing as they retracted from the influx of light.
John’s mind was quick to interject. He cleared his throat forcefully and sobered, getting a smirk from Ms. Morstan. One that if John hadn’t been in such risky territory already would have appeared to say ‘
care?” Sherlock jeered heatedly, drawing himself out a little from his Belstaff fortress. “You’re just a construct! A personified conscience my mind’s created for me to heed. Go rattle your chains somewhere else.” The detective jerked his head towards nowhere in particular. “I don’t…
If you don’t come away from this chapter craving fried onions, a heap of sauerkraut, or a hearty deli pickle then I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.
“So, anything on?” John asked after a minute or two of both men concentrating solely on inhaling their lunches.
John had woken up several times during the night, tossing, turning, readjusting pillows and blankets. Each new position felt comfortable at first but soon soured and he would try another.
If you have a cup with a spout on it, excellent, if not, you’ll just have to do your best in the later step. But here you want to crack your eggs, one whole egg and then separate two whites from the other two eggs. If you’re looking for something more “eggy” you can keep another yellow in there. Whisk or fork that up a touch, just to blend it together.
Sarah laughed, gathering a few papers on her desk. “Yeah they’re apparently desperate for doctors from the London area and I happened to mention your experience as a trauma surgeon in the army and…” She shrugged. “They want you there this weekend. Said they’d love for you to do a panel on medicine out in the field or whatever you wanted to discuss really.”
“Say no more.” John conceded gently and came inside; taking up one of the two chairs situated in front of the desk and placing the bag he was holding in the other. He busied himself while Lestrade went about clearing more space by unfurling the rolled edge of the bag.
He came to kneel back between John’s thighs and helped him reposition his legs with one hand, palm sticking to the doctor’s skin. He had John plant his feet flat on the floor, knees comfortably raised.
And while Thomas sucked crumbs and glaze from his fingers, Sherlock accessed the entire contents of the man’s phone in a matter of minutes.
It seemed he wasn’t the only one struck quiet by the suggestion; there was a pronounced stretch of silence on the other end of the line until Sherlock quickly filled it with: “Mrs. Hudson.”
“Just thinking about how much fun I had tonight too. And that…I wanted to thank you for coming out with me.” He said quietly.
They each went their separate ways shortly thereafter; John with a then critical need for some warmer clothing and Mrs. Hudson back to her flat, twittering elatedly about having plenty of time to bake some blueberry scones to bring with them to the Turner’s.
with you, I insisted he at least do it on a secure line.” Mycroft continued, shocking John with the mention of his brother so openly.
around his mouthful of pastrami at the sight before sitting up. He plopped his sandwich down and grabbed a stray napkin with shiny fingers. “How much do I owe?” Greg asked, leaning slightly to one side and reaching behind him for his wallet.
He tore off a slip of paper from a nearby scratch pad. Picking up a fountain pen he gave it a firm couple of shakes before writing a series of numbers on the slip. With a light blow to the paper’s surface, he handed it off to the assistant between two fingers.
Take your corn starch and add it to that bit of extra stock I had you portion off. Make sure it’s mixed in there well; you can add a dash of soy sauce in there so it’s not completely starchy tasting. When that’s good to go, dump her into your pot. Stir.
John ended up leaving the rest of his dinner there and untouched, partially because he had no place to store it in his hotel room and partially because his hunger had quickly flagged.
The room itself was of the average size and rectangular in shape, with minimal furnishings allowing it to feel cozy rather than cramped. To his immediate left was a long dumpy chest of drawers with a folded map of the area and several sightseeing pamphlets fanned out on its surface. Along the adjoining wall sat a modest brick-lined fireplace, a few piled logs waiting in a squat holder. Though they wouldn’t be seeing a flame tonight.
Suddenly he was weeping. Openly. Involuntarily in heaving pants and sobs like a sluice gate was lifted and out rushed the built up waters threatening to drown him.
“I don’t plan to.” Sherlock griped with no small hint of distaste. There came a creak and another grunt, then what sounded like something plush—a pillow as well perhaps, being roughed up.
bloody tall.” John muttered under his breath, so preoccupied he reached for his drink and had it nearly to his lips when he caught himself. With a grimace, the doctor averted his face and clapped the cup down sharply on the table.
“Don’t be modest John; they had you at gun point.” He chided, eyes widening a little. “You could of died.”
And yet, he couldn’t remember the last time he had this unspoiled an opportunity. To get high without a single soul around to stop him. No brothers or detective inspectors or flatmates or landladies for miles. Just him.
John let his hand fall from his face, shutting his eyes. He took a deep breath, then another, letting each out more measured then the last. He took some solace in the dark claret behind his lids as he tried to calm down.
Mrs. Hudson offered to help, but the doctor had politely refused. Though he did let her eventually take up the dusting, since it wreaked havoc with John’s sinuses whenever he tried. He’d wondered how he survived before when it dawned on him the flat was
officers towards a waiting police car. The photographer had managed to capture him giving a particularly menacing death-glare that made the hairs on the back of John’s neck prickle.
He had just finished unpacking his bag, dragging the husk of a duffel and tucking it away in the dark maw under the boxspring. As John stood, he eyed the perfectly made, seemingly endless expanse of bed-surface, a terrible urge overtaking him.  It
As John readied himself to turn in he took a brief look over his face with a sigh. He really had been an idiot to let those two prats get the better of him. But, this was the bed he made, he was going to have to sleep in it.
“Go. Away.” The detective commanded, attempting to banish this new figment. But try as he might, enough the environment around them flickered and fuzzed; John remained steadfast where he sat.
“Not as cowardly as mocking a dead man.” The words gritted through John’s teeth so calmly and low that he wasn’t sure at first if the prick even heard him. But soon brown eyes, half-lidded with drink twist round to meet his. Slow, stupid, putting the pieces together.
He did however recall the internal debate on where he should sleep. Option A was of course alongside his
Grabbing a chair to stand on, the detective pried off the metal cover to the vent just over the set. Inside the duct he’d mounted a small black camera, angling it to get the best shot of the bed, wall bar, and lounge.
Christmas crawled in on its belly and John tried to pay it no mind. He just wasn’t in the mood to feel festive. Frankly he just wasn’t in the mood to feel. But the atmosphere around the doctor brightened anyway, people were as expected cheery as the weather grew as expected bitter. Mrs. Hudson bubbled and John accepted her fussing with great restraint.
. John made the mistake of looking up the going price for that particular model and after getting over the initial shock, had been practically treating it with kid gloves.
. You know my Nan had two of them downstairs in her laundry room one summer. Made the walls look like Swiss cheese!”
.” John groused, nearly laughing. He couldn’t ignore the massive irony of not being trusted with the knowledge of Sherlock being still alive, but now was expected to serve as a channel for their idiotic espionage.
“There was the noise for one—or lack thereof really.” John recounted quietly, feeling a bit fuzzy round the edges as his pill was finally starting to work. It felt a little strange too talking about this with Sherlock, but if the man was game to hear him wax on about his old sleeping troubles, so be it.
“Language dear.” Martha warned lightly, then tisked. “Oh, don’t worry about that. Feel better?” She handed him a napkin which John promptly used to trumpet out the built up gunk in his nose. He snorted loudly, hummed in reply, wiping his eyes with the heel of his palm.
The doctor teased and sucked him off with deliberate indulgence while Sherlock gasped and moaned increasingly incoherent things, each hand clenched around a stuffed antler. John had adorned them with a determined gleam in his eye before plucking the tie at Sherlock’s waist loose. When in position, he’d lifted the man’s legs so that the soles of his feet rested on the edge of the coffee table; giving John unhindered access to all of Sherlock’s lowers including the underside of his thighs.
He found the same tidal effect to his life when he moved into 221B, affected by the orbit of Sherlock Holmes.
What Dr. Thompson didn’t realize though, was that while beating the innards out of a sack of sand might help him blow off some pent up uneasiness, it would do nothing to alleviate the shear fury John held for himself.
“Third shelf from the top, fifth from the right.” Sherlock had declared so quickly after the message was sent, that John would have sworn he’d simply rattled off a bottle at random if there hadn’t actually been a third shelf.
“It’s okay.” John said after a minute. “And you have nothing to apologize for mate. Honestly.” He assured him, regarding Lestrade for a tic before returning his gaze to his hand. The aluminum popped softly underneath his fingertips as John squeezed it a little. He ran his tongue across his lips.
He’d just started working the stiffness from his left shoulder after laying on it most of the night, when the cell door screeched opened and in stepped Lestrade, looking none too pleased.
Mahir must have sensed that when he gave it to him. The knowing smile of one addict to another as he slipped a white envelop into Sherlock’s hand along with a business card.
. And maybe he was just a bona fide sidekick at the time, but solving crimes had become something as much a part of him as being a doctor and a soldier.
When he turned back, he noticed the grim expression Sherlock wore, still swaddled up tightly in his coat and eyeing the way up to Lestrade’s flat with trepidation.
So funny story…I was under the impression that shorter chapters would be quicker to write. I was wrong. So very wrong. Especially when you get half way through and then decide to pull the content for a later chapter and have to come up with something new. My apologies for my terrible updating on this story. But I promise it will get all up here. In the meantime, enjoy a new chapter!
John internally beamed a little as he absently nudged a mushroom sliver around his plate. “She’s doing well otherwise. Hip’s still acting up but she’s never let that stop her. Unless it’s convenient for it to.”
I have made it on occasions without the precursor of illness too. Usually when a certain someone has had a rough time of it and needs a pick me up. I think it’s a bit of a comfort food—not that he’ll admit that, mind you ;)
“Come on my strapping buck. Just a couple of hours holiday hobnobbing…I’ll make it worth your wild when we get back yeah?” The doctor waggled his eyebrows, folding his arms over his chest and leaning a hip on the edge of the bench. He added a roguish smirk for good measure.
Lucy meanwhile was absolutely radiant as she began talking with one of her coworkers, smiling a little bashfully. John caught more than one shared glance between the two and their proximity never ventured farther than a few inches.
Or Molly, bearing the burden of knowledge she did for him. Though Sherlock supposed not having him around to pester her for body parts and access to corpses was a bit of a relief nonetheless.
it’s glacial out here.” John protested with a grimace, curling his rapidly chilling fingertips around the mobile radiating warmth into his palm and his ear. “And while I’m sure you saved them from complete ruin, that doesn’t make it not in the
John spent the rest of the night in a holding cell mulling over the evening with grim contentment, the left side of his cheekbone and jaw swollen and throbbing.
“More than I’d anticipated.” He admitted, adopting a small, tight smile as he opened his eyes. “I wanted…I didn’t want it to end so soon. At least not until I—we…” Sherlock trailed off, avoiding John’s gaze in lieu of staring at some random point along his collarbones, abashed in a way John hadn’t seen displayed so openly very often. It made his insides flutter amongst other things he was pointedly trying to ignore for the time being.
“So I guess this is a thing now yeah?” John offered in way of a greeting, killing his drink in one go. “You call—I answer, and you don’t say anything?” He swallowed thickly.
The suspect, one Lloyd Burberry, had approached John soon thereafter, asking if he needed help. Donning an admittedly dreadful Russian accent, John had bombarded Burberry with questions about landmarks. The man in turn had directed him patiently, never breaking his kind demeanor even as he pulled a rather impressive switchblade from his pocket and quietly requested John to follow him. At least, that had been Lloyd’s intent until he was tackled backwards into the fountain by a dark blur of shabby, sour-smelling clothes.
After a long moment, he felt Sherlock peel his face from where it had become stuck with sweat to his skin. John cracked his eyes open to see the detective looking down at him, his gaze drowsy, cheeks sex-flushed. He had only a second or two to admire how handsomely debouched Sherlock appeared when the antlers—having gone terribly crooked, gave way and smacked John square in the face.
John had his good days and his bad days. Though the good days were just the uneventful ones and the bad ones left him either short-tempered or wrecked inside, sometimes both. If he were to hazard a guess where he stood on the grand steps of grief it was dancing between Anger and Depression. Then again, John was starting to think he might have been volleying amongst the two for a while now.
It sat so innocuously on a roughly hewn square of plywood atop an egg crate—a makeshift table and about the finest piece of “furniture” around him besides the ratty armchair and a single that didn’t take the observations of a genius to tell him sleeping in it would be ill advised.
So John had hit the bog, got some water, gazed out onto the dark stillness of Baker Street from one of the sitting room’s windows, and then went back to bed to read until he got drowsy again. He had some success with that, buying him a few consistent hours, but at that point the damage was already done. John could feel the lost rest in the ache of his limbs and the tentative start of a migraine in the front of his skull.
“Which, tediously enough included me committing suicide.” Sherlock griped and for a moment John was speechless, the upper part of his face scrunched up, the lower half hanging open.
They reminisced on past cases involving one or both of them having to run a sting operation while John went about preparing dinner, dredging the chicken breasts in flour then dropping them into a pan sizzling with olive oil to brown.
There was one about a massive human trafficking ring in Tokyo being exposed. Authorities were quoted as saying the victims—nearly three dozen hidden in a cellar of a laundromat, kept claiming a ‘
He kept on with his weekly dinner meetups with Greg; sometimes they would eat in, working through the flat’s ample selection of menus. Sometimes they would eat out. John making his first physical appearance at Caffe Tandoori in ages when Lestrade nearly drove him there by panda car after the DI found out about the whole lack of delivery.
His only qualm tonight was in his use of frozen pierogis instead of the from-scratch ones like his mum would craft. But with a healthy glob of sour cream, John could certainly pretend they were.
Well then if the British Government thought he could just swoop in and smooth things over, Mycroft had another bloody thing coming—
Sherlock shrugged, both of them—John quite unabashedly—watching as he dipped his middle finger into the small clear puddle and stirred it round. “It’s one of several stashes.” He glanced over to John, flaunting a catty smirk. “Strategically placed of course. I’d tell you the other locations but that would take all the fun out of it.”
Getting them into the facility at Baskerville was a prime example. In that instance John had just bent the truth a little.
Still, he had opted to keep his coat on, a grey parka he succeeded in haggling for well below the asking price. The merchant he got it from claimed the jacket was a US import—clearly a sweatshop knockoff by the inconsistency in the stitching and a lack of the trademarked insignia found inside that brand of parka. All of which the detective proceeded to point out much to the other man’s ire. He had hurriedly shoved the coat into Sherlock’s arms and snatched the offered money, bidding him the Turkish equivalent to go fuck himself with it.
than fitting.” His hands shifted farther up and John’s soft laughter caught in his throat as Sherlock began to thumb teasingly over his nipples through his vest. The extra bit of friction from the worn cotton sent shivers up John’s spine and a bolt of arousal into his lowers, making the already burgeoning pressure fuller.
“Well, at least it’s gone to some good use.” John wasn’t at all surprised by Sherlock’s designs for the sweater and if he were honest, was rather touched by them. “You can have a crack at mine too while you’re at it. Put the poor thing out of its misery.”
It was 3pm by the time they parted ways, Martha informing him that she was having dinner with Mrs. Turner in a few hours and John was very welcome to come himself but he declined. He decided to make the best out of the rest of the day and do some much needed grocery shopping.
just copy and paste the bits you find between story sections to find out what this chapter's secret message is.
He’d looked around a bit, taking in Sherlock’s large wardrobe, the chair beside it, the shelves he could just barely make out from where he stood, noting the shapes of objects but not their exact identification. Finally his gaze fell to the sizeable—and as Sherlock himself had put it ‘
“I’ll be here.” John replied. As the call ended, he pulled the mobile from his ear, rubbing his thumb over the blackened screen. He glanced up, finding Sherlock’s chair in his direct line of sight and a brief swell of absence wash over him.
Pinpointing the racetrack Mahir Tiryaki preferred had been painless, there was only one located in Istanbul after all. And a quick internet search had produced dozens of photos of Mahir as well as most of the business and financial information for his company. Needless to say, it was doing well. Very well. Just last week Atlantis Pharmaceuticals had struck several distribution partnerships with some of the most prominent hospitals in the city.
So, short of hacking into their security cameras—something Sherlock could have probably done with his eyes closed—John had hit a wall.
It wasn’t until late that afternoon that an opportunity presented itself in a very displeased Mahir.
“While quick-witted, it was ultimately her greatest mistake.” The detective mused in satisfaction, his hand brushing discreetly up John’s back as Sherlock went to rest it on the top edge of the loveseat. “Though she tossed the statue deep into her rose bushes, what Mrs. Andrews didn’t realize was she’d left minute scrapes of nail varnish on the surface of the metal.”
Trailing his fingers downwards, John carded them through dark jumbled fringe to touch Sherlock’s brow, feeling it level out beneath his fingertips. “I know we um…just met and all.” John added, attempting to harken back to their original premise. “But I know, deep down in my bones…you’d be good to me.”
The landlady gasped, raising a hand to her gaping mouth and nearly dropping the bag. “John what happened?!” She exclaimed into her fingers, shuffling over to him, her free hand extending to towards his cheek. John gently shied away.
After getting fed-up round 3:00am he’d gotten out of bed, deciding to give the reset tactic a go. The principle was fairly simple: if you couldn’t seem to fall asleep in at least 30 to 45 minutes you were to get up and do something until you felt tired.
The longer John looked at the clue, the more the words started to muddle together. He shifted in his chair again, leaning an elbow on the armrest and fitting a curled fist into his temple.
Not that he was about to argue. Frankly at this point she could have offered him a dish sponge with a dash of red sauce on it and John would have gobbled it up and asked for seconds.
of the call ending. It didn’t. But it was so damn quiet over there John found himself checking the screen anyway.
The remainder of June thankfully came and went without incident. John returned to work that following Tuesday and made short work of Sarah’s friendly interrogation about the weekend when she cornered him in the clinic’s tiny brake room by the coffee machine.
Dinner ended up consisting of Indian food from a place thirty minutes away on foot, fifteen by taxi depending on traffic. It was a restaurant Sherlock had introduced John to in their early days cultivating the “
Reluctantly he mounted the rest of the steps, carefully stepping up onto a stretch of particle board acting as a makeshift floor. The doctor had to be careful where he tread, since the boards didn’t cover the entire surface of the attic and it would be an easy thing to step down between two beams and break through the ceiling. And John didn't fancy inadvertently installing a skylight in his room.
It had taken even Sherlock far longer than he’d intended to track Gage. Following Nicolas’s movements had been uncomplicated; he was a public figure after all. Thomas on the other hand was like tailing a ghost. Dozens of aliases, fake and real residencies across Paris, influential contacts helping him stay deep under the radar.
Upon seeing John was looking at her from the corner of her vision, Clair glanced up. “Wrong number.” She shrugged and went back to her work.
, late twenties, worked construction by the cement splatter on his jeans and boots and the build of his upper body, the bridge of his nose between those hazy eyes was misshapen and leaning mildly to the left—liked to spout off quite a bit apparently. John was sure a certain someone could have read droves more on this model citizen, but he’d gotten enough to know this wasn’t going to be an easy match.
“You were wise to worry.” John snickered. “Still. I appreciate the effort; I know, um, parties aren’t really your thing.”
of marching off to simmer down and sort himself out. While John did have this direct line to Sherlock, it was only one way. Who knew when they’d have a chance to talk again?
friendly walking translator named Conrad; his handle of the language fell to the wayside to make room for an extensive knowledge of German beer and cuisine…among other things.
Lestrade adjusted his collar, regarding him firmly. “Oh and…next time you’ve got the bright idea to start a brawl with some tosser, you bloody well better ring me for backup.”
. He laughed gently, more of a motion then anything that John could here. Sherlock’s dark lashes drooped and the corner of his mouth curled in an almost private smile.
land true, the quiet, admirable conformation Sherlock offered was well worth what John considered to be his own intellectual flailing about.
After gazing at it a moment more, he gave a declining hum. “That’s quite alright, thank you.” He replied with a quaint smile, setting down his fork and holding his hand out for the parcel.
Though he was undoubtedly relieved, Mycroft recognized the broader indications as he read the note again. The raggedness of Sherlock’s handwriting went beyond just the use of a disposable pen. Troubled as that made him, his little brother’s success was to be celebrated. Mycroft brought the tin to his nose once more, a smile spreading as he inhaled.
As he set the edited video to render, Sherlock pulled up a blank email form and a text file on his desktop labeled ‘Guest list’. In it were the email addresses to the offices of the President of the French Republic and the Prime Minister, every single member of the Council of Ministers and every major news outlet in France.
“Yep. Claimed he was full of nitrogen or some tosh. I’ve got’em in the hold until I can figure out what the hell to do with him. It’s been like this all bloody day! I swear, as soon as the temperature starts raising everything goes tits up.”
After the disbelief faded, after reality finally sunk in that Sherlock was really gone, the anger came. It dug its teeth and claws into John and wouldn’t let go. Though, if he were to be honest with himself—really honest—he hadn’t put up much of a fight to begin with.
.” John breathed, the edge of each word rough, like he was either fighting to keep them in or to push them out. "
Taking advantage of the disarray, the sheet tangling them together in a chaotic knot, John swiftly reseats himself on a pair of upper thighs, pinning his attacker’s lower body to the ground. Blindly he makes a grab for the front of a shirt, fingers balling tightly into the course material and pressing his fist down firmly on a heaving chest, drawing his other arm back to throw a—
“You remember his software; the key to any door real or virtual? Never existed. A complete fake. He—it was a game John. The break-ins, the trial, Brooks, my ruined credibility, I
John was irrefutably curious how solid that claim was considering the man rarely slept in it. Any prolonged use the bed got was typically when the detective hit a post-case crash. That was if Sherlock actually made it to his room—with or without John’s aid—rather than crumpling into a catatonic heap on the sofa or his chair by the fireplace.
“Well…” Mary nibbled a bit on her lower lip, pink and lightly shiny with gloss. “Finding work’s been a bit of a trial and—I’m not much for sitting around.” She said confidently.
Not more than a half hour after reaching the main of the city, his suspicions were confirmed while the detective sat in a crowded tea house in Eminönü. An assortment of heavy woven rugs hung in a mishmash of colors and sizes along white-washed walls. The hazy air infused with the scent of spices and the smoke of several hookahs.
“Eh I’ll live...” John shrugged, sliding his other hand up and under Sherlock’s arm. He pulled it closer to him in a makeshift hug before dropping a kiss on the smooth fabric of the detective’s shoulder. “There’ll be plenty of opportunities for us to make a few quid off Philip Anderson.”
, right now. Obviously I can’t say what, or for that matter where, but I’m sure by now you’re quite capable of sussing out my general location.”
With a sigh John leaned forward, bracing his elbows on the edge of the table before burying his face in his hands, trying to summon the energy to get up and make himself some tea. All this “investigating” had taken him well past lunch into the early edge of dusk and he was beginning to feel the pang of an ignored stomach.
There was a relatively pregnant pause on the other end, enough to catch Greg’s attention. "Or is that
In that moment John saw through his shimmering vision, the reverence of realization flash across Sherlock’s face. It was a look he’d previously enjoyed quite a bit. The detective’s brow unknitted, his lips parting—which usually preluded some dramatic revelation.
John. I can't stretch out without my feet sticking over the edge. I feel like I’m staying in a eight year old boy’s bedroom for god sakes!”
.” He corrected with a sleepy laugh, somewhere in his hazing brain he thought about his wireless bill.
Realizing he’d been holding his breath only as his lungs began to burn, Sherlock tore his gaze away from the heroin with a breathy gasp. He blinked against wavering vision, seeing the fire still burning in the hearth, that he was still deep in his mind palace’s recreation of 221B.
As he walked into the kitchen, bathed in stark, blue-tinged light from the florescent hanging over the kitchen bench, John stopped fiddling with his cuffs and looked up to find Sherlock hunched over his microscope. Exactly where he left him an hour and a half earlier when the doctor had arrived home from surgery and popped off for a quick shower.
phone call came mid-October some four months after Sherlock’s death, while John was still good and angry. He’d been sitting at home, at Baker Street in the early evening after killing a few hours at the clinic.
Accepting the reality that any further reading tonight was simply not going to happen, he plucked a strand of red embroidery thread from where it was draped across his thigh and slipped it into the crease where his thumb had been.
Swallowing down whatever rebuttal he’d been building, Anderson gave a small defeated nod and bent forward, reaching for a folder lying open on Greg’s desk. For the brief glimpse that John got before the man flicked it closed, he saw what appeared to be a poorly folded map marked heavily in red marker and several newspaper clippings piled on top.
.” With that bold gleam still in his eye, Sherlock curled his tongue around the edge of John’s thumb to draw it smoothly into his mouth. John echoed the soft groan Sherlock gave around the tip of his finger as he sucked, burnishing the pad along the slick bed of his tongue and then letting the whole thing slip out unhurriedly with a debauched
But to give in to nostalgia was to give in to distraction. And he couldn’t afford the luxury of being homesick.
The only thing that had gone unscathed was his forehead, which, although bit of sensitivity when he expressed with his brow looked fine.
Someone trying to call a mobile in London and were off by a number or two. It wasn’t like John stated his name in his voicemail greeting, so seemingly as long as the person was trying to reach a man, conceivably he could have been mistaken for them.
Taking the two cards, Sherlock started to process the check-in, pulling up the registry information in the computer console tucked underneath the desk’s thin counter of an overhang.
Frankly, after losing Sherlock, he’d been so overcome with grief and anger that the idea of bringing someone else into his life had been the farthest one from his mind. Romantically or otherwise. He’d been a husk of a person, barely managing to go through the motions. It wouldn’t have been fair to subject a person to that for the sake of trying to bring a sense of normalcy back to his life. To fill a void that quite honestly only one person could really fill…
It felt like ages since he’d done this. Actually cooked a meal for himself rather than mooching off the graciousness of Mrs. Hudson or quarrying his dinner from a brown paper bag. Neither of which he particularly opposed. However there was a certain level of pride gained from taking a bunch of simple ingredients and crafting something grander out of them.
At first, John’s progress with removing the felonious article was going well enough; he quickly peeled it upwards, reversing it in the process to pull it over his head. It was when he tried to remove his hands from the jumper’s cuffs however where things went awry. Every time John yanked with his arms, the tightly-knit wool only constricted more around his wrists. The same proved true for his head when he attempted to writhe free of the collar.
Then comes the ginger. Now don’t worry about chopping it up, you just want a small peeled piece, maybe 2.54cm to 5.08cm (an inch or two) in size (it’s just for flavoring and we’ll be taking it out later). Toss it in.
Besides Lucy perhaps, John honestly couldn’t imagine anyone legitimately writing Philip a note like that. And considering Lucy seemed resolved to do her pining from afar, it was unlikely her.  But if the note wasn’t actually
Maybe, Sherlock couldn’t completely abandon him any more than John could completely gut the man from 221B?
Sherlock leaned forward, lacing his fingers and resting them on the chilly rail. “Her rider’s just broken up with his girlfriend. Rather messy from the looks of it. His head won’t be in the race.” He supplied.
No wonder he hadn’t been recognizable from behind. For intents and purposes, the man standing before John looking like some recluse English professor simply
He glanced up again and gave Greg a half smile before knocking back the last of his now room-temperature soda. Well that was about as bumpy as John imagined. Even worse as Greg seemed to accept it with a frightfully sympathetic nod.
.” Sherlock went on without skipping a beat. “Her plan was to spend a few hours in her local coffee shop and pay with a chip card. Not only would the staff act as witnesses to her being there at the time the poisoning occurred, but her purchase would be timestamped. Giving her a solid alibi.
John shook his head slowly, smirking a little despite his disapproval of Sherlock’s blatant manipulation. That did explain Philip’s sudden disappearance from the party. Still, he couldn’t help but put himself in Anderson’s place, waiting in the dark amongst the coats in Greg’s room for god knew how long. His enthusiasm draining away bit by bit with every minute that door didn’t open.
It shimmied itself across the surface of the coffee table displaying an unknown number. He watched it dance for a bit, debating.
While his love and attraction were definitely tinting his perception, no doubt, the fact that Sherlock was undeniably (if not a little uncommonly) handsome and could probably wear nothing but a bin liner and still look like a bloody Adonis certainly didn’t hurt.
“You think I’m dead!” Sherlock bellowed. For a moment both men seemed dazed by the announcement before they were overcast by something heavy and reluctant. Sherlock averted his eyes from John’s to the carpet between them, bowing his head and pulling a hand out to run through unkempt hair, gripping it towards the back to stop the twitching in his fingers.
He peered on hazily as Sherlock rose a little awkwardly on one elbow, stuffed antlers wobbling and cock pointed lewdly as he twisted to search for the lube. Discovering the bottle had rolled midway under John’s chair.
As the other end of the line went silent, John truly regretted doing this over a sodding phone. He felt adrift not being able to see Sherlock’s face, the myriad of his expressions. Though most of them consisted of a stare, a smirk, a scowl, or something complicated with his eyebrows.
John pulled the mobile away, looking almost insulted. Which was absurd, who got upset by a wrong number? Without considering how puerile it was, he brought up his call log and hit the last incoming number with his thumb, redialing it. The line rang once then:
“So what’s been going on?” Greg shifted in his seat, drawing a leg across the couch between them as he rested his beer on the side of his knee. It was such an innocuous question on the surface, but by Lestrade’s tone, the doctor was rather certain he wasn’t looking to hear about his day.
Heard it like he was the only other person in the room. Cutting through like nails on a black board. Like the way your brain convulses when foil contacts metal fillings.
Sherlock tutted and if John wasn’t mistaken, there was a faint shuffling as if the he had lain down. “I don’t know how you managed sleeping in barracks for all those years.
John had half a mind to ignore it, to let that sedan follow him all the way to the tube. What the hell did Mycroft want with him? He hadn't received any unknown calls since May and they weren’t on speaking terms last time John checked and that certainly extended to stalking him in a bloody towncar. He wondered then if this was just some attempt to scare him, to test his resolve about keeping Sherlock’s status a secret. John felt his hackles rising with every step.
—three, probably four hours to kill, and you’re obviously dining alone this evening, I might as well keep you company.”
No matter what strange or plausible thread the doctor perused, they all had one thing in common. Sherlock was out there doing what he always did. He was helping people.
“Speaking of which, I suppose we’ll just have to keep these.” Sherlock gave the head-band mounted antlers a lazy nudge with the tip of a finger where they lay abandoned on the coffee table.
“Nope.” Sherlock said then whirled suddenly to face John, his eyes gleaming with intention. John did his best to conceal a smile around another pull of beer at the sight of the stuffed horns wobbling preciously on the man’s head.
was in response to exactly. His last statement? All his statements? Some other unsaid thing Sherlock had picked up on? It didn’t really matter, not with Sherlock’s focus going hazy and altogether lovely as he finally regarded him.
let it go to voicemail. He never tried that before. It was another number John had never seen before; but he knew what was waiting on the other end nonetheless. Biting into his bottom lip, he answered the call as it neared the last ring.
“Mary.” John nodded, sweeping over to desk along the far wall. “I’m Dr. Watson.” He plopped the open medical file down before sitting on a nearby rolling stool.
Lestrade scoffed quietly, taking a sip of his second round of stout with a satisfied gasp. “You sound like my lawyer.”
John could feel warmth rising in his cheeks even as he remarked casually. “Gosh…” He sat back against the bench. “He sounds
Sherlock seemed to perk up at that, though he still appeared to John like a man about to head off to battle.
Lowering the binoculars, Mahir gazed at him with quiet regard as the detective went on. “Insomnia, restlessness, clinging to objects of sentimental value—”
be slipping into a cab and heading to Greg’s, John kept his response playful if not a little pleading. “Sherlock, the whole point of an ugly Christmas sweater party is to
She gave him a wincing smile followed by the small gush of a forced laugh through her nostrils. Meanwhile the bloke glued to his phone’s screen snickered.
“Sorry to interrupt but I’ve got Mrs. Greenwood on hold.” She winced, nibbling on her blush-tinted bottom lip. “She’s stuck in traffic, something about an overturned lorry. She said she thinks she can make it here but it might be a half hour past her appointment time. I mentioned I
After waiting another handful of seconds John ended the call. Shrugged it off and went back to wallowing somewhere between exhaustion and wanting to crawl out of his skin. He ended up going to bed early that night after picking at some leftovers he had in the fridge. The thing he tried to call sleep was fitful, more taxing then restful.
“Not too sure about that.” He muttered wetly, clearing his throat. As he looked up to Martha again, his lower eyelids burned. The landlady cooed at him, placing a hand to his good cheek. He had to tighten his lips to keep them still.
There was a disillusioned sigh above him. Sherlock turned his head, addressing the ceiling as he spoke. “I’ve always found them tedious and expectant at best. Act a certain way. Speak a certain way.
“Sherlock.” Greg welcomed him. “Nice rack.” He added good-humoredly, nodding towards the antlers adorning the detective’s head as he presented his hand.
Perhaps it was from having nothing but alcohol and a handful party nibbles in his stomach, but John was beginning to find the prospect of pretending to be a ruddy deer unexpectedly enticing.
Stepping off the stoop of 221B and onto the pavement later that evening, belly stuffed full of the best home cooking he had in ages, Greg rifled through his pockets for his cigarettes and a lighter. He’d just skimmed his fingers over the rectangular shape of the pack when from another pocket, his phone began bleeping loudly.
John pulled the bottle from his lips with a soft smack and gasp. “This isn’t about eggnog at all is it?”
. As the doctor began working on the other, he glanced up to see he was being watched. Sherlock’s head was craned awkwardly and his eye movements sluggish, intent to follow John’s fingers.
Sherlock clenched the fingers tearing like a vulture at the chair’s arm tightly for several seconds then let them flair loose, blood pulsing back into his fingertips. He did it again. Then again. His other hand only better off for having been pressed up against his face for so long.
John’s hips bucked with a broken curse, his lower half bowing as Sherlock proceeded to caress the swelling node with feathery pressure. John bit fiercely at his bottom lip, something high and thready breaking from his throat. A large splotch of seminal fluid dribbled from him, stripping across his navel.
while Option B was taking the two cushy chairs near the fireplace and bridging himself across them. Neither prospect seemed particularly appealing, but short of curling up on the floor, which he was very close to doing, John eventually caved and shuffled over to the other side of the—
.” The detective grumbled just shy of sharp and John decided not to pry. He had memories himself he’d give anything to delete, some more recent than others. It must have been exceeding frustrating however for a man like Sherlock, so adapt at organizing his mind to have things he couldn’t well,
It didn’t take a genius to see that Sherlock wasn’t exactly an open book when it came to his feelings. Though he had no qualms about voicing his disdain for something or someone. Or his excitement, inappropriate as it was at times. Sherlock still struggled with what he considered messy, sentimental or imperiling emotions, even to John candidly.
Beyond the facial trauma, the skin under John’s lower eyelids was shadowed, discolored and sunken from lack of a proper night’s sleep. Overall he looked gaunt. Had he lost weight?
Sherlock’s features went softer, purposely disregarding John’s unreserved look of confusion as he leaned inward.
It left him feeling a little helpless against the intensifying pleasure of it all. Too distracted to register Sherlock’s warm breath as he closed in and licked over John’s right nipple.
As John approached a long stretch of windows that made up the outer wall of Greg’s office, he suddenly heard the DI’s voice filter out into the hall from the open door.
They lay there a moment, chests heaving against one another, acclimating. The ache John experienced at being penetrated was already fading into a contented sort of fullness. He turned his head a few inches to press his lips at the edge of an ear. With a sigh of his name, barely audible, Sherlock began to gently rock against him.
). “Quite. We’ve had our eye on him for some time now. Lots of rumors, mostly ties to several prominent Turkish mafias, but nothing that sticks. Every inspection of the company’s laboratory and factory has come up clean. The theory is he has a private facility stashed away somewhere in Istanbul.”
they do still exist I reckon my mum would have them, somewhere. Honestly though, Sherlock, they’re rubbish. A child’s flight of fancy—” He attempted to stress.
“It was you calling me…wasn’t it?” John asked after a long spell, addressing the ceiling. He wondered briefly what time it was, guessing somewhere in the early hours of night as it was still dark outside the window. Still silent. Still asleep like John wished he was.
each other.” The doctor pressed on, gathering his nerves before they trickled away like sand. There was a swell of frustration inside him, helpful as it was caustic.
He was currently standing on the landing, rain hissing against said roof high above him. Already there was a sizable wet patch blooming along the plaster. Several varying colored rings could be seen up there from previous leaking, a murky watercolor in browns and yellows.
Friday morning at 8am sharp, he arrived at the King’s Cross Station and sure enough there was a round trip ticket waiting for John under his name.
Cursing under his breath, John swept round the kitchen bench and sharply flicked off the radio. The sudden lack of competing sound made the ringing all the more prevalent. All the more real.
After a glance at his watch, he pulled up one window containing video feeds from the lobby’s security cameras, three in all: one trained on the main entrance, another at the archway to the bar, and the third overviewing the front desk. That one in particular revealed an agitated Mme. B-Something fuming by her mound of luggage and a hand cradled up by her ear.
John snaked a hand from under the covers, careful not to let too much cold air in as he searched blindly for his phone. His fingers slapped around the bedside table, trailing up the side, along the edge, and finally over the surface of it, locating the edge of the mobile just as his fingertips began to tingle. The device was frigid when he brought it under and only when John got a proper look at it in the small amount of light diffusing through the bedlinens did he realize he’d grabbed
There were scarce instances in his life thus far; little enough Sherlock only needed one hand to count them, that he would admit regret in not listening to his brother.
It was unquestionably, terribly sentimental, the stuff of sodding romance novels (and wasn’t he always panned for romanticizing?), but it made John feel a bit swoony all the same and he let himself sink a bit more into Sherlock’s winding embrace.
The man with the phone scoffed, then mumbled something under his breath before knocking back a waiting shot.
The detective had watched him lose every single bet he made that day from his perch on the risers. He could tell just from the stiffness in his gait as the man returned from the window that Tiryaki was ready to leave if this next race didn’t pan out. And it wouldn’t by the quick glance Sherlock got of his race card when he slipped up beside him. Mahir had been brooding alone near the rail separating the track from the stands.
higher ranking then Corporal Lyons. He just wasn’t there on a spot inspection. Or you know, currently active.
you?” The first word whooshed hotly against the detective’s abdomen, the rest seethed and a fresh shiver ran through John.
.” Came Sherlock after a moment, the last bit rolling from the man’s mouth like it was a foreign concept.
. And I’ll take a wild stab and say you’re not going to tell me about it either.” John mused with a sigh.
The remainder of the cab ride was spent in pleasant quiet, John scooching over and wriggling lower in his seat so he could rest his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock had tipped slightly toward him to make the angle more comfortable on his neck, unfurling his arms to rest a hand on John’s thigh. He must have missed when Sherlock plucked off his gloves because his hands were bare. The weight and warmth of Sherlock’s palm seeped in through the fabric of his trousers, the sluggish drag of fingertips along the material as they stretched outwards before relaxing, felt to John like an understated promise of things to come.
Bargaining endeavored to make an appearance, a valiant effort truly, but at that point anger left no room for it. It was all consuming and John let it gnash at him until there was nothing left but overworked sinew and raw nerves.
Navigating back to the forum, the doctor found the date of the first post and noted it was created back in the middle of June. Just about a few days before Sherlock had revealed himself to him.
The most stunning aspect though was his complete shift in personality. Stripped was the pompous, sniveling air of self-righteousness John had come to anticipate and in its stead was something meek and almost—paranoid.
“His name is Mahir Tiryaki.” Came a sour voice on the other end. Sherlock sat back in his seat, grinning into his cup. Mycroft must have been at home. He never spoke so openly, let alone used Sherlock’s name these days anywhere else. “He’s the CEO of a company called Atlantis Pharmaceuticals.”
“Wider, just a bit...” Sherlock coaxed quietly and John let his legs tip further open and gasped. The stretch went all the way down to his tender entrance, pulling at the loosened band of skin. Sherlock ducked his head to kiss at one of his trembling knees.
John had come to a dead halt on the pavement, people pushing past him with annoyed glares but he no longer registered them and instead snarled into his phone.
“Just this morning I was called in to arrest some bloke after his neighbor complained he was watering the flowerbeds in her garden.”
Sherlock sat up again; this time slipping his hand underneath the bottom cushion of the red armchair. He rummaged a moment, his expression brightening as he pulled out what appeared to be a compact bottle of lubricant.
Greg spread his arms a little. “Not half bad aye?” He wiggled his hips, causing the plastic eyes to sway. John couldn’t stop a guilty laugh and Sherlock glared at them both in repugnance.
With a defeated sigh, John plopped back down and rubbed a hand over his face, his stubble grating against his palm.
The headband completely vanished in the Sherlock’s hair—a little untamed as the man hadn’t planned on leaving the flat that evening. It gave the illusion that the chocolate brown, velvety antlers were actually sprouting from his skull while only the very tips of the wee light brown ears popped out from his curls.
“I please ask that you refrain from apologizing John.” Sherlock continued, somehow sensing what the doctor meant to do as he opened his mouth. “You did nothing wrong, and you didn’t make me do anything I couldn’t have easily refused. That—point, in my life is well and truly behind me. Where I’d very much prefer keep it. And as I said before I had an enjoyable time tonight. More so afterwards if that wasn’t obvious.” He finished with a suggestive purr in his tone.
As soon as Anthea left however, Mycroft’s pleasantness collapsed. Replaced with an air of unease as he inspected the package closer. The forwarding address was scrolled with a cheap biro based on the inconstancies of the strokes—there were numerous spots where the ink had failed to be applied to the paper. The handwriting meanwhile, though virtually unrecognizable had an unmistakable familiarity to it when it came to the letter ‘S’.
Tiryaki frequented the Veliefendi Racecourse Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Though the detective assumed the man had his own private viewing box, Mahir would often be sitting in the stands or mulling around on the large park-like green where visitors often watched the races. He also only bet when his horses were
essentially on holiday with himself after all. Generally if he had been outside London, it was on a case. And even then certain individuals—whom John promised himself he wasn’t going to think about this weekend, but there he bloody goes again—tended to ignore his existence when they were particularly focused on the problem at hand.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes tightly shut, berating himself for even envisioning the idea. What good would it do? He couldn’t interact with John in any way, so he certainly couldn’t
John snorted as he took a nip of his soda, his breath whistling against the aluminum. On the topic of people behaving bizarrely, he found himself thinking back on the strange encounter with Anderson. Admittedly, John was a little curious. The first and subsequently last thing Lestrade had mentioned about the man was that he no longer worked with the Met. As to the circumstances of Philip's departure or what he was up to now, Greg hadn’t supplied. Most likely out of respect for John.
As part of their evening activities, John had bowed and forked out the £5.99 a month for a Netflix account. Throughout the rest of March they worked their way through the first series of Father Ted.
John looked down at the mobile, something about the word secure sent up a red flag in his mind. A second later it clicked. “You mean
amount of bullshit I expect from the two of you." He dropped his hand to glare at Sherlock. There was a minute clench in the man's jaw, the muscles flexing then releasing.
He hadn’t meant to take so long but after three minutes letting the shower rain down on his back alone, by the time the doctor twisted the taps off, the water was starting to get uncomfortable.
John stopped, jaw clenching as he lowered his voice as well. Sherlock wasn’t the only one in a position of discretion. Though Mrs. Hudson had likely retired for the night and with any luck on the back of one of her herbal soothers, it didn’t completely negate the chance she might overhear him.
know a bloke from Cologne but that was decades ago when he did a semester abroad in college and John highly doubted they would be calling him.
He paused by the exit, promptly feeling the brisk November air waiting for him just beyond the doors. The temperature had been steadily dropping over the past week and with a near constant wind, felt even colder.
He convinced himself it was probably best to head back anyway, considering the day he had waiting for him tomorrow. Though during his ride to the inn, John couldn’t shake the sense of alarm. It coiled slowly and uncomfortably in his gut, the crawling sensation under his skin returning with a vengeance.
, the doctor’s brain caught up. John regarded him then, leveling Sherlock with a befuddled look and the corner of the detective’s mouth twitched upwards briefly.
No...not easier. Compulsive. John’s words tumbled from his mouth, with a crushing sort of need to be uttered despite how rubbish it was in retrospect. What good was it to lavish endearments on a slab of rock?
“My first objective was isolating Anderson.” Sherlock began to explain on their cab ride back home. The car hissed along damp streets as a light but steady rain fell. John had been dreamily watching the droplets form and streak across his foggy passenger window when Sherlock suddenly spoke after remaining silent for a good five minutes into their trip.
“Don’t mind me I’m just—.” She trailed off with a defusing huff. Though John could easily see the tension still in the hand that gripped the straps of her bag. He honestly wished there was something he could do; even if he knew Mary better, a letter of recommendation from a locum doctor wasn’t much of anything. And sadly they were just as capped at the clinic as—and suddenly John had an idea.
presently seeing someone or that the last time John recalled going on a legitimate date was more than a year and a half ago…
It was a rare opportunity when John got to purposely put himself in the wrong place at the wrong time…
harshly. But I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. And Sherlock was very tired apparently. So we get, Sleepy!lock and GoodGuy!John
that instead of outright ignoring him as usual; Sherlock would greet him with a nod or launch into something that was on the detective’s mind. Acting as if John hadn’t just stalked off angrily an hour or so beforehand.
someone." There was a soft huff, both men falling quiet soon thereafter. Neither seemed in any particular hurry to fill it or end it. John rolled over onto his side, his view eye-level with Sherlock's chair across the sitting room. How many nights had they sat across from each other in such a silence? Completely at ease in it.
Not that he apparently needed to be so well-rounded; The HR manager barely glanced over his immaculate CV—references curtsey of Mycroft—before running Sherlock through a gauntlet of absurd interview questions neither of them honestly cared about the answers to.
I recommend grabbing a line of code and pasting it in, hitting return then pasting the next line of code and THEN hit translate. It's a bit easier that way.
John took a chance and looked at the screen. It wasn’t a mobile phone number from what he could tell. He realized then that he hadn’t said hello. Or anything else for that matter, yet the call was still running.
Mahir’s amusement grew as he raised a brow. “Perhaps he is waiting on a better job offer.” He suggested. Though his accent was rich and heavy, Tiryaki’s handle on the English language was impressive.
“You know, a part of me will always love my late husband.” Mrs. Hudson gently interrupted and John did his best to steel his discomfort with a long swig of his coffee. “The drug cartel and the homicides and the cheating aside, Frank had some very loveable qualities. Mostly physical…” She gave a fond, almost reminiscing smile. “And there’s
Loosening his grip on the phone to slip it into his pocket, John let out a long exhale and turned back to the stove, reaching for the burner’s dial with a steady hand.
He began again gingerly, like addressing a cornered beast. “Now John. I know you might be angry but right now I need you to—”
’ love,” John broke out into a grin. “Not standby while a desperate man has an emotional breakdown via eggnog and peppermint schnapps.”
John placed a tentative hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, who refrained from meeting his gaze even though he leaned into the touch. He caressed upwards, pressing his palm to the side of Sherlock’s pale neck, his thumb resting on the sharp line of his jaw.
and placed his duffle on the bed—the bag sinking into the down, and made his way around to an open doorway just off to the left of it. As anticipated there was a quaint bathroom complete with tub and shower.
“Hey…” John turned to him, speaking low enough that Sherlock could still hear him over the droning holiday music. He reached blindly for Sherlock’s hand, finding it tightly curled at his side. As his fingers grazed clenched ones, they flinched, constricting a little more before they slowly unfurled to slot themselves in the spaces between John’s. John kept his sights firmly on Sherlock’s face, which remained placid even as his piercing gaze flicked over each person there.
John’s fingers squeezed around the mobile tightly, fighting the urge to hurl it across the room at the wall. Instead he gritted a curse through his teeth and let the hand with the device in it fall limply to his side. He measured his breathing, feeling like he’d been struck with the blunt force of a wave breaking on him. The kind that tore the ground away from under you and knocked the air from your chest as you tumbled in its hold. The kind that would put any unprepared, inexperienced person into panic.
John blinked, looking down at the clear plastic containing his coat, wallet, keys, and mobile phone. “Wait…”
Sitting in his library at his home, Mycroft looked up as a folded newspaper was produced from under the arm of an assistant and handed to him. He took it with a tight smile and a short thank you, leaning back in his chair and glancing over the front page.
He bleated weakly when he felt the damp, swollen glans nudge at his entrance. The loosened hole easily giving way, dilating, as it was pushed gently but incessantly against. John breathed slowly through the brief pressure that always preceded the blissful rush of sensation as Sherlock finally breached him.
Out of all them—nine in total, only two appeared to be landlines, the rest were mobile numbers according his query results.
I hope this wasn't boring as hell. I worry sometimes about this story's pace and if it's interesting. I think it is at points but I'm not a reader, I'm writing it. My perception is skewed. I wish sometimes I could wipe my memory of typing it and read it with a fresh perspective.
on Sherlock as he was still clad in a white dress shirt, its sleeves rolled up at the elbows. The jumper in question hadn’t been on the bed where he’d laid it out for Sherlock prior to heading into the bathroom and upon seeing it missing, John had genuinely (
In a blink of an eye he was over in John’s chair, settling back into the lumpy yet cozy seat. Folding his long legs up towards his chest, the detective wrapped what was now his Belstaff around himself, rotating so he faced more of his front towards the fireplace.
“Really Sherlock…” His brother chided with an impish satisfaction. “…overdosing in a slum? I thought you hated repeating yourself.”
he’s out.” John reported confidently. “Now it’s a bookseller around the corner on Porter, just opened up. She brings him brandy snaps.”
It wasn’t shocking however that people—even close colleagues for that matter—couldn’t fathom how the doctor put up with living with him. Admittedly there were some occasions that John himself wondered if he wasn't right in the head to keep coming back as he did.
“Well I’m not much of a politician, but I can put in a good word for you at the very least. Maybe we can get you in as temp.” John solaced, unable to help grinning as well.
John hummed, glancing off briefly towards the pavement to his right, still several blocks away from the tube station. “Highly doubt that.”
Instead he’d merely gave John a hum in return and turned back to his research, leaving the other man frozen in the sitting room until the doctor cleared his throat, picked up his bag, and headed up stairs. By the time John descended from his room Sherlock had just finished slipping on his coat, mentioning he was to stepping out for a bit and nodded over his shoulder to a mug of tea seeping on the kitchen table.
