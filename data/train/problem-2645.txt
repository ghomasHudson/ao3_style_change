John grinned. “Actually, not at all.”
“Oh, of course, how silly of me,” John retorts. “Because the cases you decide to go out on aren’t merely dictated by whim of the moment, there’s a logic to it.”
John snorted. “God, you’re a moron, Sherlock Holmes.”
Boom. He trips on the rim of a step and would have hit the concrete were it not so crowded, instead careening into several people and taking out several more with pinwheeling arms trying to keep himself on balance. He can imagine the outraged exclamations around him and murmurs appropriate regrets as he steadies himself, once again in total darkness and out of the flow of traffic. He stops and tries get his bearings, trying to pick up the vibrations again to determine the direction of the majority. Suddenly a hand grabs his elbow forcefully and turns him about a quarter turn and gives him a little shove.
“Does that make me special?”
At last, though, John is in his favourite place in all of time or space, feeling Sherlock surrounding him, rutting up against him greedily until John is completely buried in his friend. John holds his hips firmly, refusing to let him dictate the tempo. He wants this to last a very long time. He wants to melt every last neuron in Sherlock’s brain before he’s through, obliterate all thoughts of self harm or murder or detection from his head for at least twelve hours.
“Hey,” John says neutrally, climbing on to the bed. “Can I talk to you for a minute?”
“Oxford,” Justin says proudly. “Japanese art of the Kamakura period.”
John shifts so he can keep Sherlock at bay while still being able to tap on his forearm.
John removed the loosened, make-shift tourniquet from his arm. “You’re burning up,” he said, putting a hand on Sherlock’s clammy head. His skin, always pale, was practically translucent and his dark curls were slicked to his skull. “How long has this been going on?”
Sherlock cocks his head, uncomprehending, and she pulls down her polo-neck to reveal deep and livid finger marks.
“Calm down, John. You misunderstand me. You mustn’t leave him, even if he says he wants you to, even if he demands you get out of his life. He might do such a thing for any number of misguided reasons, but believe me it would be the worst thing you could ever do to him.”
By the time they have both eaten and dressed and are waiting for the potential client to appear, Sherlock is entirely back to his usual self, albeit the most cheerful and excited version of it.
ET TU, BRUTE? – J
For once Sherlock did as he was told. John dragged Moran to the next room and bound and gagged him expertly. Then he went on a hunt for a first aid kit. The place was surprisingly well stocked – he found bandages, antibiotics, surgical supplies, painkillers, and more. He grabbed what he thought he’d need and went back up to Sherlock. He was half lying on a couch, eyes closed.
He didn’t want change. At least he didn’t think so. But now the subject seemed to be unavoidable, and he knew things would be different once it was broached. He dreaded the thought.
It took him the better part of three hours to reach St. Bart’s. He had, perhaps, been overly cautious in his route, but there was something to be said for paranoia. The lab was deserted. It was a Sunday, he realised with a start. He had quite lost track. He ran to the messy corner of the lab bench he had claimed as his own, scattering books and notes and slides carelessly in his haste. There it was. Scrawled in spidery writing:
“No,” John says. “I won’t see him.”
Sherlock grins for the first time in weeks. The game is on.
"We've got it under control," John tells Bryant soothingly. "Nothing is going to happen to you. Just call if you find out anything about a shipment and we'll be along immediately, and if there's problem with the police we'll handle it for you. Okay?"
He didn’t know how long they sat like that, but at some point they fell asleep. When he awoke the next morning they were tangled up on the sofa, half sitting, half lying. He hadn’t slept through the night without a strong pill and a strong drink for months.
Sherlock does some quick measurements. “From Ilford, somewhere close to Wanstead Park Road. A five year old. Five years, three months, approximately.”
The pressure starts to build within him, ready to overflow and he doesn't try to stop it. His mind is past thinking, pure bliss racing through his synapses, shorting out dendrites, silencing neurons, demanding his full attention. He arches his pelvis forward, holding John tight to him, and lets it crash through him and into his friend, like falling, like drowning, and then the relief of catching hold of something that saves you. A harsh, guttural noise escapes his lips as he spasms within John, finally stilling and coming back to himself.
John looked at him incredulously. “Are you serious? We have the phone full of incriminating evidence about Moran and all Moriarty’s other accomplices, as well as the
Sarah patted his leg. “Me too.”
“Moriarty’s dead. Or never existed. Either way, you won’t find him here.”
It's late when he gets back to the city, and he goes immediately and circumspectly to Detective Inspector Lestrade's sparsely furnished bachelor flat. He's not there, but housebreaking no longer presents any difficulties for John and he's waiting in the dark when Greg arrives home.
Mycroft looks unconvinced. “Do you remember that bird you found? The one with the broken wing? After you fixed it up you got so angry when it tried to fly away, so you tied it with a string so you’d always have it to talk to. What happened to it?”
John sets his jaw. “No reason at all,” he grumbles, and goes into the kitchen for a glass of cold water. He runs his fingers through his hair and makes himself dissipate the flash of anger that is building.
John feels a swell of warmth for his friend, now that he sees Sherlock isn’t denigrating what they have, but elevating it to the highest plane he can imagine. John wonders if he can make him understand that the two things didn’t have to be at odds. You can choose to love someone. Sometimes you
“Right. That’s how it works. You keep things from me, so I’m out of it. That’s gone so well in the past,” John snaps. “I’m never really out of it Sherlock. Especially not now.”
John follows Sherlock through the door and is greeted by a scene of complete chaos. The impeccably furnished home has been completely ransacked, furniture overturned, pictures on the ground, clothes and small items strewn everywhere.
though! It’s been bothering me really, after all this time, why you wouldn’t
“Good,” said John, though his heart sank. “You are to give the shipment to me, at once. I will take it directly to Mr. Moran.”
injured, nearly killed, and I almost had to watch! I’m not sure which is worse really, the thought of watching you die or the thought that it might have happened while I was sound asleep in our bed! I woke up and you were
Bryant gathers his things uncertainly and makes his way out of the flat, looking both confused and somewhat reassured.
"Moriarty didn’t take everything I had away from me, Sherlock,
John attempts, and fails, to block the previous exchange from his mind. Fantastic. Naked John makes Sherlock think about sex. The last thing he needs is to think about Sherlock thinking about sex. He looks down. Oh. He sighs and turns the shower to cold.
The knock comes again and Sherlock groans, wrapping the sheet around himself and stalking to the door. He opens his mouth to repeat himself, but it's not the maid. It's a young boy in a courier outfit, who hands him a package.
It was the next day that was the problem. The first snag was that it was going to take some time, possibly weeks for Mycroft and Lestrade to officially clear his name. He was still a very wanted man. That meant no leaving the house, no posting on his website, and above all absolutely no cases. Not even private ones. That was going to make getting back to normal impossible, at least for the immediate future.
"Why? Shouldn't you consider me a rival? Yet you've encouraged my friendship with John, even for us to spend time alone together. It doesn't make sense."
John still wanted Sherlock to go to a hospital, but the nearest one was miles away and he had to concede Sherlock’s point that there was no way to escape police involvement if he was seen in his state. Telling a Finnish doctor he had walked into a door would not cut it. John was able to tape up his ribs and other broken bones fairly well, and satisfied himself that there was no serious internal injury. Sherlock still looked a sorry figure, though.
"He acts like a virgin," she says out of nowhere. "But he's not, is he?"
"So that's it," Sherlock whispers, stunned.
“I don’t love him,” Sherlock says quickly, automatically.
John turns to stalk away, defeated, but then stops. “Sherlock, at least tell me… do you love her?”
Sherlock's eyes narrow at John but he doesn’t comment. “I said, if you’re going out would you stop by the bookshop later, I’m expecting a special order.”
John smiles and draws Sherlock nearer, and suddenly neither of them are thinking of Irene Adler, nor will they for a very long time.
John groggily puts an arm out to touch his side. "All right?"
At first Sherlock is exhilarated by the difficulty of the case, but when no progress is made he grows sullen and John prays for something to distract him.
The only other time he’s nearly jarred out of his controlled and curated role in John’s life is the stag do. If you can call it a “do”, since it’s just the two of them. And John seems to want it that way, even though he’s got, at least by Sherlock’s low standards, loads of male friends.
In a moment strong arms, familiar arms are grabbing him, drawing him out of the bonfire and dragging him to the safety of the cool church lawn. He blinks smoke and the haze of the drugs out of his eyes and looks up fuzzily into the faces of Sherlock Holmes and Mary Morstan. Their expressions mirror each other; in equal measure frantic, frightened, and tender. Between the ordeal of the fire and the ensuing cognitive dissonance, it's too much for him and the world goes black.
“Because I’m taking you out. To celebrate. Okay?”
John swears. “You’re lit! Jesus, Sherlock, I thought we’d had done with this.” He rushes over to his friend and performs a quick assessment. “Well, you’re high as a kite but at least you’re not in any immediate danger. Here, you need water.”
He offers the occasional cigarette out of a mixture of guilt and pity, but is otherwise firm. He doesn’t drink much any more, either. Not that he ever did, really, but he knows an over indulgence on either of their parts will likely re-open a subject they seem to have silently agreed is best left alone. Not that there aren’t moments, for both of them, but they are largely able to ignore them and get on with life.
“Then let’s go. I’ll tell you where we are headed on the way.”
Sherlock agrees, a bit deflated, but knows John's right. John turns to leave the bathroom but Sherlock stops him. "No. If you go, everything will be dark. Shower with me. You need one anyway."
"Am I?" Moriarty echoes his thoughts uncannily. "You can't tell me you haven't felt it, ever since the first time, since dear departed Carl. He was my first gift to you, when I realised I wasn't alone in this world. We've been connected intimately, spiraling ever closer to each other in this courtship dance of ours. We're the same, two sides of a two-headed coin. We belong to each other. We're the only ones who ever could. But you, you think you belong to John Watson, to a common tart, a lap dog who barely deserves the title. I can't have that, Sherlock. It makes me look bad."
"Oh, yes." She grabs a small wrapped box off the table. "Give this to John, would you? Wedding gift. Not supposed to see each other and all that nonsense."
Without even the smallest of tells beforehand, Sherlock launches himself at Moriarty only to pull up short at the flash of a laser sight in the corner of his vision. Sherlock freezes.
“Sherlock?” he asks, unable to resist.
“And I’m very moderate with the drugs,” Sherlock continues. “I know the precise dosages I need to make my brain function better, and if I can’t think then I can’t work and if I can’t work… I have to work, John. And if there’s something new to be learned, I have to learn it. I
Greg shakes his head ponderously. "No, not for us. You."
John checks his pupils and his breathing. “You’re okay,” he says. “Go to sleep. I’ve got you.”
“I suppose you could say that…” This is not actually the weirdest conversation John has ever had with Sherlock, but it’s starting to crack the top five.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Of course it’s true. Mycroft’s lies are much more inventive than that. I was on a course to be sectioned or dead within six months. A year, maximum.”
John sighed and sat up, facing Sherlock and crossing his legs, resigning himself to the certainty of a long conversation. “Probably because you refused her invitation to her party.”
“I know it sounds strange, but it’s a real organization, only for people with naturally red hair. It’s mostly a social thing, but they were founded by a very wealthy man who made it the club’s mission to promote the well-being and success of people like me. Some of the members are a little extreme, refusing to date anyone who isn’t also ginger, talking about how oppressed and endangered we are; that sort of nonsense. But most people are just in it for fun or tradition. Anyway, the man I met explained that the Society offers scholarships to deserving and hard-working young men and women, and that I was certainly eligible.
"Of course there's something wrong me, I can't see!" Sherlock shouts, agitated.
Ear poisons, great, fine. He starts reading determinedly and, thankfully, she remains silent. Although he hates the hungry, speculatively look with which she continues to scrutinise Sherlock.
“Clothes,” he says curtly. “Then lab.”
Sherlock began to laugh, very quietly at first and then louder, as though he had just gotten some great cosmic joke. He had thought he had been hallucinating again while Moran was speaking, but he now realized what he was actually seeing and he could not keep himself from chuckling at the utter absurdity of what was happening.
Sherlock finally catches his drift.
“So, if I’m a white dwarf star, what does that make you?” John asks, when the afterglow has dimmed enough to speak.
Sherlock lets out a deep sigh and rolls over to face John. “Fine. What do you want to hear?” His voice is a challenge. John must tread very lightly.
"Sherlock... would you mind sitting down?"
Instead he agrees reluctantly. "Partially. Well, mostly. A lot has happened."
Sherlock smiles faintly. "Oh nothing. I think I was just told what I ought to say in my speech. Now, is the organist here? She was supposed to arrive ten minutes ago. Well, if you don't know, find someone does. Hurry up!"
“You do?”
John should have known he’d notice, but by the time Mycroft was done with him it was too late to bother going in for his shift. “No,” he says casually. “It was just a really slow afternoon so I decided to bugger off early.”
YOU CAN’T HEAR CAN YOU?
She shook her head and smiled ruefully. “No, John, never. I shouldn’t have…” she sighed. “John, I love a good no-strings-attached romp as much as the next girl. And we both sure could use one. But I like you too much for it to end any other way than painfully.”
Sherlock leaps up and steps back from John until his back hits the bench behind him. “You think it’s psychosomatic, don’t you? Like your sham limp. You think I’m… what? Losing it, finally! Psychologically crippled. Damaged. Hysterical blindness, isn’t that what they call it? I’m just hysterical!”
Impulsively, John looks up at him and plants a wet kiss on his lips. “That’s simple. And it feels good.”
“What do you mean nothing?”
"I was alone for many years. And then for a brief time I wasn't. And then I made some choices I thought were good ones and I lost that, for years, and I thought I would never have it again. Don't waste a chance at something good, something you really want if there's any possibility you will regret it because time is so short and some chances never come again--"
It's like the wound that has been festering inside him these long weeks is finally bleeding freely and cleanly. He feels the madness that's been driving him begin to lift, starts to realize how truly out of his mind, out of his self, he's been.
John can tell something was wrong, of course, and that feeling is borne out with Sherlock’s cagey and increasingly erratic behaviour over the next few days. He refuses to admit anything is out of the ordinary, but he is out of sorts despite plenty of reasonably enticing work and public adoration, disappearing for hours at a time, snapping at John for nothing but then refusing to rise to blatant attempts on John’s part to bait him.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson do not dance and do not flit. They stand, a little apart, in an out-of-the way corner near the canapés, indistinguishable from the rest by dress yet with a well-defined chasm of mental space between themselves and the rest of the partygoers. Or perhaps that is just Sherlock, as John looks rather like he is enjoying himself, despite his lack of participation.
… for anyone here is it?”
John hears the sound of pacing on linoleum and the tap of fingers against a thigh. "They checked his brain? That bump on the head --"
“You don’t have to do this. It’s not going change anything he’s going to do, you have to know that,” John pleads. He reaches for Sherlock, and Sherlock allows John to take his hand, to pull him back into his room, to sit next to him on the edge of the bed, temporarily wavering in his resolve.
entailed. Sex, heterosexual or otherwise? A girlfriend, a wife, children? He had dreamed of all that once, but he didn’t know any longer. Mostly he just felt content with what they had – companionship, work, support. Sure, Sherlock was maddening most of the time, and with the rare exception of when John had been injured, never did chores or shopping, or any of the other things one might expect from a flatmate or friend. He constantly went through John’s things, woke him in the middle of the night, and dragged him into dangerous situations. He was always in motion, quixotic, reactive, difficult, and brilliant. And John loved it.
No other customers were inside, and it looked and smelled every inch the average Eastern European smoke shop, with countless brands of cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco, as well as pipes, and some newspapers, crisps, candy, and other sundries. In short order an elderly man emerged from the back room, wiping his hands on a damp cloth. He was fairly tall, with a bristly silver mustache, and was dressed in a suit that must have been 30 years old but was well cared for.
Sherlock freezes in place, is silent for a long moment, then says, “What of it?”
“Well, you may be clever but that doesn’t mean you weren’t also
“I was trying to protect you.”
John is no stranger to Sherlock’s philosophy on love, but this is a dagger in the chest, especially considering what he has just witnessed. “Don’t say that,” he says quietly.
"I realise you may not encounter this a whole lot in your line of work," John tells her. "But Sherlock is one of the few men with a completely pure soul."
There is a lull in work. Sherlock runs out of experiments and grows sulky, then destructive, then despondent. Cocaine is the next stage of boredom, and John doesn’t want to know what comes after cocaine. Lestrade throws them a bone, a cold case, which Sherlock takes with unusual enthusiasm and John joins in with relief, glad the drugs have been avoided, at least this time.
“Good,” says John. “I’m glad.”
Sherlock tilts his head. "Love...has always been a difficult concept for me to grasp. So often it seems to be the opposite of what you describe. And I've never trusted emotions."
“Helping us stop the criminals. He’ll be a hero.”
“No!” Sherlock grabs his arm. “No. I’ll stop. For good. Forever. I promise. Just…just don’t.”
“It’s not all me, you know,” Sherlock says, settling against John gingerly. “The light. It’s you on your own, too, and me and you together. It’s not just a reflection; wouldn’t exist without you.”
"What? What is it?" Sherlock demands before he's even hung up.
? Since, you know, there’s a bed in there and not up here, anymore. That was rather where I was going with this whole thing.”
the fastest way to accomplish something. But it’s not… it’s not good enough to justify cutting yourself up on a whim or risking frying your brain or letting someone try to kill you just to get data!”
“What is it?” John asks, lifting his head to look at him.
Things are pretty quiet for the next few weeks, mostly small cases, nothing potentially fatal. Life at 221B goes back to something that could be called normal, given the right frame of reference. John uses the time to write up the Woman’s case, which he finds cathartic, as well several others he’d never had time to.  Sherlock has just enough to keep him from hitting insane levels of boredom.
Somehow this knowledge, this proof of Sherlock's utter devotion to him, feels like losing him all over again. He swallows hard to keep himself in check but the feelings must be writ all over his face. Hanna is looking at him intently and, he would swear, with some amount of pity in her eyes.
were wrong this time?” Anderson asks nastily, his nasal voice grating on John, who unconsciously moves closer to Sherlock.
shut up, I am actually trying to get you out of this, you magnificent oaf.” He turns to the DI. “Those prints may have been from his boots but he certainly wasn’t in them at the time. And look at his hands. Dirty. Old dirt too, haven’t been scrubbed properly in at least a week, but you found only clean fingerprints on the coffee maker, not a trace of dirt, yes? Not our man.”
." So-so.
"I said you're right. I didn't trust you. I didn't trust you not to come after me. I didn't trust you to not get yourself killed trying to protect me. I didn't trust you to stay where you were and not get yourself captured and tortured and used as bait and slaughtered to punish me! Don't you understand? I couldn't have that happen. I needed you safe."
“I’m sorry, are we talking about the food or the case now? Because either way I think you might be doing it wrong.”
John forces a weak smile, “Me too, loads of work to catch up on.” He spins around to face Sherlock, kisses him carefully on the cheek, and ducks under his arm before Sherlock can catch him again.
John looks away and tries to get his emotions in check, a swirling storm of hurt, anger, confusion, and sadness. “I’m not convinced that this is either what you need or what you want.”
“Sit down,” snaps Sherlock. “Your Papa and I have something to say to you.” He clears his throat, and gives John a little shove forward. “Well, go ahead, John.”
“Yes?” John turned around, his face the picture of innocence. “Want something else then?”
Despite his studied reluctance in front of his brother, Sherlock is all but salivating over this dominatrix case. It certainly is out of their usual scope. John has never seen Sherlock take quite so long to decide which of his many disguises and uniforms will suit his purpose in an investigation. The only thing he tells John about his plan is that John is to set off the fire alarm two minutes after Sherlock’s signal, once he’s alone with Ms. Adler.
John feels sick.
“Yes.”
“Don’t get used to it,” Sherlock says, but without venom. Somehow John has been backed against the wall and Sherlock has blocked his exit with an arm. Sherlock also seems uncertain as to how they got here, but doesn’t move.
John slips a hand into Sherlock’s and takes the lead. “Oh, come on, it’s not that awful,” he scolds. “You said you wanted to be healthier this year…”
Ms. Adler was silent for moments. Finally she said, “You saw me lying dead and bloody on a slab once too. And a British spy saw a member of the Taliban chop off my head. Yet here I am.”
Sherlock snorts. “Of course I got what I needed. But that’s not the point. Who exactly was seducing who in there?”
“Fuck, you’re serious,” breathes Brixley. “Of all people, I never figured you for a cocksucker.”
“It doesn’t matter, just do it!”
Sherlock is too moved to say anything in response.
“Hmm.
“John.” Sherlock cuts him off hoarsely. “John, what did you…”
Sherlock turns back, just as abruptly, and returns to the sitting room.
Lestrade frowned. “John, I need a bit more than that, you of all people…”
They arrive at the paper company in plenty of time. Bryant is white as a sheet and shaking, but doesn’t appear in immediate danger of passing out. The office and warehouse areas are both dark. It’s only once they’re huddled in the cold outside of the warehouse that Sherlock deigns to explain the plan.
John starts to back out of the berth, gun still trained on her. "I'm sure you'll have that rope off in a moment but I would advise against following me. I didn't kill any of your men, either. Call it even."
my plaything."
He repeats the performance without being spotted, and then at the third gate slips through and remains still just on the other side, while they manoeuvre the lorry into the dock, watching. There are three people in the cab, the driver, a large man, and a woman, medium build, who looks edgy and frustrated with her companions. The large man, the muscle, gets out and opens the back of the lorry and then returns to the cab, grumbling about the cold as he gets back in.
John successfully sweet-talks his way into being allowed to visit Bryant’s office unaccompanied and breathes a sigh of relief. He wonders if he can get out without passing either the crone or the over-eager maiden again.
After a moment of consideration, the other man nods his tacit agreement. "Well, I don't know where you've been but those lightweights have been off the scene for months. Still, some of their old crew run in my circles and there's always use for a man good with his hands who can keep his mouth shut. Assuming that's you."
For the first few days, John had just assumed he was in one of his moods and largely ignored him. He had tidied up, updated the blog, gone to the cinema with Sarah, and fielded requests for them to work on new cases. Sherlock turned every one down with an enraged “No!” as if he were shocked John would even suggest they attempt to solve a crime. After the third day, and a refusal to even be tempted by a case in which the victim had been somehow exsanguinated in a locked basement room, with no trace of blood or murder weapon, John truly began to worry.
He had mailed a couple postcards from the station in Sanremo when he stopped to switch trains, praising the sea air and charming local colour of costal Italy and declaring his intention to spend at least two weeks there before going on to Greece, but he was unwilling to spend time on anything more elaborate. Every minute he delayed was another minute for Sherlock’s trail to grow cold. He wished desperately that Mycroft had had more for him, but at least hehad a lead now, however tenuous.
There is a sharp intake of breath at his name, and then John says in a voice like a broken radio, "Take me home, Sherlock."
have been watching her, to know her habits so well. But I didn’t see a cup or coffee stain.”
“I’m very sorry, Mr. Holmes I just – Hang up, how did you know my name? I didn’t give it to your housekeeper.”
Saint and angel, he thought, feeling guilty, as Lestrade pressed a drink into his hand.
be dead. And it didn't take any resources but my own to find you. Stop being sloppy and think. This isn't a game."
John may not the best detective, but when it comes to Sherlock he’s pretty damn good at seeing when he’s heading somewhere. “You think… you think this has something to do with the poisoning don’t you? But they’re completely different in every way.”
She spreads her hands. "It is my business. Literally."
Sherlock rolls his eyes, the reluctant but indulgent boyfriend.
Sherlock sighs. “John, I am bored. We’re at a dance. The only thing to
John grabs him by the shirt, crushing dark silk in his hands. “Don’t think. Tell me. What do you want? Whatever you want.” He looks at Sherlock meaningfully. “I will do – or not do – whatever you want. But you have to
John nods slowly, processing and apparently coming to the conclusion that he is in no condition to cope with this at the moment. “Right,” he says at last, matter-of-factly. “Okay then. Goodnight, Sherlock.” He goes into his room and shuts the door without another word.
John looked unabashed. “I owed him that," he said grimly. "At least. I don’t like letting him go. I’m not one to actually kill someone in cold blood, but after what he’s done to you… He’s too dangerous!”
“Christ,” John says at his overreaction. “That’s it. We’re getting a taxi the rest of the way.”
Justin gives him a doubtful look, quite obviously seeing a half-drowned old man in John's seat.
Sherlock finally looks up from his mobile. “What? Oh yes. Look for anything you don’t remember seeing before, however small or insignificant, even a new stain on a piece of clothing. Now, you can call the police to report this, it would look funny if you didn’t, but don’t tell them anything we’ve talked about, just say you came home and found the place this way with nothing missing. They won’t find any fingerprints or evidence of the culprits and it will die quietly. Then just carry on until something else happens or you hear from one of us—”
“It’s not hard once you get used it,” he forges on with the optimism of youth and conviction. “I’ve been a strict vegan since I was nine.”
Sherlock re-composed himself and backed Moriarty closer towards the base of the trap door. His voice was steel. “I was saying that in, by my estimate, under a minute very strong men with very large guns will be coming. They will take you away, to a dark place where no one will ever, ever find you. They may even torture you, although of course that would be completely unofficial, since the British government doesn’t go in for that sort of thing. No one will even know to ask where you are, and I am guessing no one would care to.”
John waits for long enough that when a vehicle finally does come into view, it’s almost a surprise. He tenses in a crouch as they approach his position. Sure enough, after only slight hesitation, the gate swings open. John darts through immediately behind them and then circles wide, out of the lights of the drive and the lorry, sprinting to the next gate and making it there before the lorry does, though not without a fair amount of laboured breathing.
“People following you?” John asks.
"Not at all," she says graciously.
“Anything else?” Sherlock growls.
“If you like…sure…” John says weakly. He is not at all sure that this is good, particularly given what tends to happen to the human body when large amounts of current are passed through it. And yet this is very nearly a blatant admission of John’s complete indispensability to Sherlock, and that is no small thing.
, I don’t have this place rigged with explosives. That would have been great, though – oldest theatre in London,
John begins to blush furiously whenever he sees Mrs. Hudson, though Sherlock is completely unabashed. On the way to a case, John is unable to avoid her in the corridor, and she gives him a look that he swears will kill his libido for at least a week. “Ah, Mrs. Hudson, hi, sorry about all the…um, well, sorry,” he finishes lamely. Sherlock is tapping is foot impatiently outside.
"Uh, that's a little above my pay grade," John fumbles for a second.
A series of short, but interesting, cases come and go. Sherlock and John return to something approaching their normal dynamic, for which John is grateful. Then there is a lull. Sherlock grows bored and restive, beginning to chafe against his strict sobriety, alternately begging and ordering John to help him. John refuses his pleas with outward placidity, but begins to worry that if something doesn’t come up soon, Sherlock will take matters into his own hands.
Sherlock drew both knees up to his chest and peered at John over them, steepling his fingers under his nose, as if taken aback that anyone would ask him that. At last he said, with great difficulty. “I want you to stay, John.” It was clear how much the admission cost him. “I want you to stay until the end.”
“Have it your way, you mad wanker,” John mumbles at Sherlock’s unhearing figure. He’s not sure how much time passes, but the next thing he knows Sherlock’s mouth is to his ear barking his name unnecessarily loudly, and it’s dark outside.
“Lovely to hear from you, too.” Sherlock ends the call and snaps the phone in half. It makes a satisfactory cracking sound. He adds salt water for good measure and then stalks back to his lodgings to sweet-talk the landlady into the use of her clunky old laptop. He plugs in the data stick once he’s safely in his room.
Shit. Sarah. John had forgotten all about her. He checked his phone – four texts. Mrs. Hudson hadn’t even been home to let her in. He cursed under his breath. “I’ll take that drink,” he told the DI, as he furiously composed a message on his phone.
he shouldn’t do this, but he can’t help himself. He has do something. He is tall enough to prevent John from moving past him, at least not without a good shove.
“Oh, no, no, all wrong!” Sherlock exclaims angrily as soon as they walk in. “You, Goliath, stand up. Now!”
"Needed to clear my head," Sherlock says, offering no other explanation. "May I stay the night?"
Outside of the bedroom things continue much as normal between them, which John finds both surreal and completely understandable. He hadn’t truly realised until they started sleeping together how much the rest of their lives already resembled that of two people in a relationship. Neither man is naturally effusive, and John knows Sherlock is unlikely to be willing to talk about such things outside of the immediate moment of intimacy. John doesn’t particularly feel the need to either.
John puts a hand up and caresses the side of Sherlock’s face. “We’ve been jealous and insecure and angry with each other,” he whispers ferociously. “We’re not perfect, we never will be. But I’m yours, and I’m not going anywhere. This is a promise. I’m sorry if keeping my room made you feel like I wasn’t committed. I am and I always have been. Okay?”
“Are you ready to talk about your case, Mr. Bryant, or would you like to waste more of my time with your theatrics?”
Sherlock opens his mouth in stunned self-defence before he realises John is teasing. John has to stifle a laugh behind his hands at the appalled expression on Sherlock’s face. Sherlock only realises how worried he’d been when relief shoots through him that John is joking with him again.
Sherlock studies her carefully. She clearly understands John better than anyone except perhaps himself, and still no sign of deception.
“This is very flattering,” John tells him. “But I think you may be overstating things a little bit. We work well together. I don’t mind saying he’s my best friend. But Sherlock hardly needs me. Besides, he may be difficult but I’m sure he’s had other flatmates and friends at some point in his life.”
Sherlock doesn’t appear in any rush to break the spell the next morning, lying in until nearly ten and then dragging John to the shower with him and proceeding to shove him up against the tile and fuck him very deliberately until they are nearly out of hot water.
He takes the long way back to 221B, needing to clear his head, to wrap his mind around the information he’s just been given. There’s a sense of relief of something to do, after days of inaction and helplessness. There’s a feeling of paralysis in the face of so many unknowns and so little hope of success. There’s a hint of familiar excitement at the mystery and danger he’s heading into, danger he's learned he can’t function without.
“Well, consider me a captive audience,” Sherlock said sardonically.
“He couldn’t have done. We weren’t even close to him until an hour ago, and this is at least three hours old. I thought we had more time! I don’t understand.”
“Self-preservation, Ms. Mihov. Which seems to be your motivating force above all else. Moriarty’s not the only one capable of setting up a resilient trap. I assure you would not survive my second death by more than 24 hours. I know all your bolt-holes and accounts, and so do my associates.”
He makes a quick perimeter around the house, gun drawn, but sees and hears nothing. It’s gotten very dark now, and is starting to rain. The wind is picking up too. John vaguely remembers hearing something about a bad storm in the forecast, but he hasn’t been paying much attention.
"No! No. Just... tuck it somewhere out of the way. If that helps."
Sherlock raises one eloquent eyebrow at him.
“It went precisely as I expected. We made it half way to the dance floor before my father hauled me off by my collar and threatened to whip me if I tried anything like that again. The other boy played it off as a joke to his dad. Mummy had a long, concerned talk with me about appropriate social behaviour and how certain feelings weren’t meant to be acted on, and never made me go to a ball again. Two weeks later was the Carl Powers murder and even though I wasn’t able to solve it, the case was just so much more…
“Some. Not enough.” Sherlock admits.
John suddenly feels exhausted, like all the air has gone out of him. He is distantly horrified by what he's just almost done, but more than that he's overwhelmed by the magnitude of his loss, of the lengths Sherlock had gone to for him.
“Why are you telling me this?” John said, maintaining his even tone with great effort.
IT ALSO DOESN'T MAKE THE THINGS I DID RIGHT. EVEN IF THEY JUST HAPPENED TO WORK OUT.
Sherlock modulates. “Better?”
“A what?” Sherlock is incredulous.
The stranger freezes, and John can see the indecision flash momentarily across his face before he settles on an offensive tack. “What are you doing in my office?” he demands, doing a decent impression of being genuinely affronted. “Put that down and get out before I call security!”
John decides it doesn’t matter if they don’t speak the same language, as long as at least one of them can puzzle out what the other is saying. Sherlock is watching him like a hawk, unable to predict his reaction or discern whether he’s been forgiven.
“I’m not! I don’t want you to. I…” He catches himself. “I…
“Do you want me to move out?”
Lestrade had sighed heavily. He seemed to have aged ten years in the past month. “I’m sorry, John. You’re right, I should have believed him. There are a lot of fishy things going on here, but I don’t know where to start. I have no leads, John. The sad fact is the only person likely to be able to solve this was Sherlock Holmes. I promise, I’ll do what I can – I owe him that much. But don’t expect a miracle.”
He strode into the police station like he owned the place, earning a look of resentment from Anderson and Donovan, who seemed to have transferred their hatred of Sherlock to him. The feeling was mutual. He barged into Lestrade’s office, just as the Detective Inspector was putting on his coat and packing up his briefcase. It was well after 8 pm.
"And what about me?" Sherlock demands, sharply.
“Have you ever thought it’s because we worry about you? Because we
Sherlock looks a bit crestfallen, as he often does when John lets a bit of air out of his ego, but soldiers on. "Come on then, we'd better go talk to Bryant."
“Your presence is not required,” Sherlock says coldly and is gone before John can argue. John is left alone in the sitting room, feeling sick and useless. After a few minutes, Mrs. Hudson enters to check on him.
He was in the shower when the buzzer rang again that evening. It was a bit earlier than Sarah had said she’d be back. He should have given her a spare key. “Mrs. Hudson can you get that?” he yelled over the running water, and was gratified to hear the door open and shut downstairs.
Too soon, Sherlock breaks away from John, leaving him craving more. “Turn over,” he orders, sharp desire glinting in his grey eyes. John understands what he wants and obeys with only the smallest of hesitations, laying spread-eagle on his stomach, waiting. He has never felt so exposed, so completely vulnerable before, and trembles a little though he is not afraid.
Sherlock swallows these thoughts down hard.
Sherlock waves him off. “We’re talking about you. We’ll go to that café with the pastry…things… you like near the Yard.” He throws John’s jacket at him and all but drags him through the door. John lets himself be manhandled out of the house.
It’s not until the next day, after John’s had some more sleep and cleaned three trays of decaying large intestine and half a dozen dead guinea pigs out of the refrigerator, that he knows what he should do.
John wanted to be reassuring, but knew in his heart that Sherlock was probably right. “Then all the more reason for you to keep your strength up and your wits keen,” he said, bracingly.
“I couldn’t move. I tried to talk to him in what little Pashto I had, tried to reassure him but I could barely whisper and I don’t think he would have found anything I had to say comforting.”
Victor nods and, not wanting to wake the housekeeper, makes up a room for Sherlock and says goodnight, making a credible effort to conceal his curiosity.
“No…no! He is playing a game, but it’s not with us. It’s with himself. Something’s wrong here…we’ve been looking at this wrong. John, get me a list of all the victims' home addresses and ages. Exact ages!” He jumps up and pulls several large maps of London off the bookcase and spreads them out on the floor, muttering to himself. When John brings him the addresses, he begins to mark them on the map in red, while muttering to himself.
He's just about to break away from her, make up some excuse about having to check in with their superiors or having to use the loo or anything that will let him escape without her immediately turning on him, when he hears a polite cough from behind them.
John throws his head back and laughs, then kisses him deeply, passionately. “Why, Mr. Holmes, that could take all afternoon!” he says, with feigned shock.
Bryant gulps.
“Oh, that’s clever…” he muttered, inspecting the empty pack. There, in the bottom right, was a tiny compartment, designed to fit the negative space left by the six shorter cigarettes in the package, just about nine cubic centimetres. Anyone inspecting the shipment could take any cigarette out of any package and have it look perfect normal, provided they didn’t compare the different sizes.
“No,” says Sherlock, grimly. He falls silent. Talking without being able to hear is exhausting and frustrating, and this new discovery only makes him feel further away from the answer. The Hound drug has been their only lead and there’s so little of this new compound in his system that either it’s not actually the culprit itself but just a byproduct or, worse, it is the cause of all this and his body has already metabolised most of it. If that the case, if it's leaving his system but his symptoms are worsening, then that would mean its effects are mostly likely permanent. And quite possibly degenerative.
Christmas present.” John grins as he sees Sherlock’s eyelids flutter involuntarily in response, and heads downstairs.
“Because you’re still here,” answers John, teasing fingers dancing up the inside Sherlock’s naked arm as he holds his face just inches away from his lover’s.
“Who knows what logic my brother follows? I believe it was an experiment, since he’d never tried it before. Perhaps he was actually lonely. I couldn’t say. He could certainly afford 221B on his own with his stipend. But I’m positive he never expected to meet anyone as tolerant and compatible with his lifestyle as you have been. I certainly didn’t. In fact, I was pretty sure no such person existed. My point is, for better or worse, you’ve become integral to my brother’s existence and are only likely to grow more so.”
John wants to punch the disdain off his face, but pulls himself together. “I am yours,” he tells Sherlock with far more calm than he feels. “But I’m a person, not your right hand. If you just need to get off, you can use that, not me.”
John stirs and wakes as he thinks it, blinking the sleep from his eyes and looking up at him blearily. “You okay?”
Sherlock must be able to see him wavering because he tries again. “May I touch you? Please? You don’t have to control yourself around me, I don’t want you to. I just want
“So he must have known her well enough to know that?”
John goes to Bryant’s place of work with far less reluctance than he shows to Sherlock. It’s good to be doing something that has nothing whatsoever to do with Ms. Adler or Mycroft. And Sherlock might be pretend he’s less than riveted by this case, but John knows it’s an act – he’s beyond intrigued.
John shifts awkwardly in the long silence that follows. “Well, now I just have to figure out how to get to Inverness without anyone who might be watching noticing I’ve left here."
“I love you, too,” John says, grinning with what can only be described as sparkling, dazzling, radiant joy. He puts Sherlock’s hands to his mouth and kisses them reverently. “Absolute fucking nightmare.”
“No. We’re done now.” John grabs his coat off the hook and pockets his mobile. “Good luck with your corpse, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened and John relished the genuine look of surprise on his face, seeing as how rare such an expression was for the detective. He did not, however, get to appreciate it for very long before Sherlock had all but tackled him, nearly knocking him backwards out of his chair. Before he knew it, Sherlock was filling his senses, tongue in his mouth, hands on his neck, scent of aftershave in his nostrils.
John sighs, suddenly tired. “Maybe not. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want some normal things once in awhile. Living with you is like being caught up in a bubble of insanity, and it’s fun and exciting and dangerous, but sometimes I need to remind myself that that’s not what most of life is actually like.”
Sherlock lets his mind do as it will, filing the memories and feelings one by one until everything makes sense again and the daze recedes. He realises he is on the floor, covered in oil and bodily fluids and is starting to become cold. The creeping sensation of discomfort, disgust, and panic starts at his feet and spreads upward, raising all the hairs on his body.
Sherlock completely fails to register John’s reaction and forges on. “But it’s true,” he insists. “See what it did those kids? Love is blind and stupid. When you let it in, it takes over, you’re not in control of yourself any more. You do things you never would have dreamt of. Chemicals flood your brain and you have no say about how you feel any more, no power to control your actions. And even when it doesn’t end like this, there’s still destruction, the subsuming of yourself as you are to please another person. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”
Sherlock looks stricken and slowly sits up, as if dazed. “Have I been doing that?” he murmurs, half to himself. “I’ve been so distracted…”
John didn’t answer. “You’re using the past tense,” he commented after a moment.
“I would have thought you would have deleted all that information,” John says. “Polo’s not much use to a detective.”
John relaxes and hands Rosie to him, smiling as Sherlock holds her, still awkwardly. "Well, I've brought the travel cot if you need her contained and she'll be down for her nap in an hour..."
“I don’t think you’re crazy,” John tells him. “Well, at least not about this.  But you have to admit it’s not usual. The light dims the further you get from me… and when you were at a crime scene without me it was like a…blurry dark photo, yes?”
And then he is gone and John is alone the flat; nothing has really changed but nothing will ever be quite the same.
"I think so, yes," John agrees and falls silent, knowing Sherlock needs to process for a while, contentedly laying still beside him.
She looks at him thoughtfully, with a decidedly predatory air, and he realises in all of fifteen minutes she's gone from distant aristocrat to vicious undercover operative to world weary foot soldier to, now, aggressive coquette. Who is this woman? Whoever she is, she's completely brilliant, and very possibly a psychopath. Before he can follow that train of thought, she has bent down and is kissing him. Not chastely.
His head is pounding now, the headache having crept up on him as his memory crept away. "I don't know. It's working slower on me but thinking is becoming difficult and I am feeling... some sense of irrational fear as well."
“I’m not sure that’s the sort of thing he’s cut out for,” John mutters, and finishes getting dressed.
“You,” he says rounding fiercely on John, “look like the asteroid that killed the fucking dinosaurs.”
Sherlock plunges his face into John's hair and breathes him in. "You smell of... palm trees and hot sun and lust and herbal soap..." he manages.
“Uh, step-brother, actually,” interjects the prospective client in a thick Australian accent. He shrinks back as John and Sherlock slowly turn identical, venomous expressions on him. “That seemed important but…now… it doesn’t...it’s fine…”
He opens his phone while waiting for the taxi.
my prize,” she says. “I bring you in, I can have my pick of assignments. Now, move.”
“Practising?” Sherlock was incredulous.
“You’ll need those,” Sherlock says curtly, and before John can even be amazed that his friend has made tea he realises he feels like he’s got the worst hangover of his life. He downs the tea and the pills and sits.
“You weren’t drunk then.”
brand cigarettes, marked with their distinctive crest. “This is all I have right now.”
“Like he knows!”
Mycroft nods. “I wanted you to know, because if you have the intention of making your association with my brother anything less than permanent, now is the time to extricate yourself. Actually, it was several months ago, but you can be forgiven for the oversight as he is rather hard to read.”
Sherlock nods curtly. "Obviously the buried memories were not deleted and continued to influence me without my knowing. Perhaps that's why I was drawn to you upon our meeting."
The ritual calms him somewhat. He twirls the syringe in one hand, mesmerised, but makes no move to inject it. He sits on his bed like this until dawn, then discards the syringe in the back bins, but hides the remaining powder very well indeed. He is sure to be out of the flat before John rises.
“And what’s to stop me from alerting the people with instructions to make sure you stay dead that you very much haven’t?”
It takes everything in him not to obey, to force himself to stand still and watch as John's face crumbles and he turns and walks away. Not limping, but clearly only through dint of willpower. Sherlock watches him longer than he should before turning up his collar and returning to the car.
John's eyes linger on the little duvet covering his daughter and Sherlock realises he's just noticed the anatomy-themed linens, but then he chuckles. "What the hell, yes, you did it perfectly. And fuck normal childhoods. What matters is having parents who love them. And... each other..."
“Of course,” the clerk says, eyes shining with an evangelical fervour. He rummages through his drawer and pulls out pamphlets, while John goes down an aisle and pretends to consider various types of nut butter, while remaining in eye line.
Sherlock shuts himself up in his room again immediately. John knocks once and receives no answer. He paces the kitchen, unsure of what he can do other than be awake and in the flat in case something happens.
Sherlock sees his reluctance and for a moment John thinks it’s all over, that their intimacy is about to crumble at this false note and become nothing more than a tainted memory. But instead, Sherlock turns animated, in one smooth movement jumping up, pulling John to his feet, spinning him around and bending him roughly over the end of the bed.
“Oh, not at all. Jim’s death was entirely of his own making. Just because you are involved with someone doesn’t mean you don’t realize when they are completely batty as well as devastatingly brilliant. Jim may not have cared about money or power or anything but his own schemes, which might well have been part of his success, but I very much do care about money and power and I can assure you my reasons for bringing you here are strictly business-related.”
“Of course I ride,” Sherlock snaps. “I ride, I dance, I play polo, I speak French, I choose wine, and I know the difference between an ascot and a cravat.” His voice is surprisingly bitter.
IT DOESN’T MATTER IF IT WOULD BE ENOUGH. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING. AND I WOULDN’T GIVE UP ON US, ON YOU, ON LIFE, OVER IT. I WOULDN’T DO THAT TO YOU. WE MEAN MORE THAT.
“Listen to me carefully. I want you to hang up and leave your flat immediately. Bring the mobile you found. Go to Regent’s Park. I will meet you there, on the outside of the zoo near the aviary. Don’t get a cab on your street. Walk three streets over, and change cabs at least once on the way. Do you understand?”
“I’m leaving,” he says, through gritted teeth. “I am going to Harry’s. I will come back.”
“I thought it was something arriving!”
Sherlock lets out a long breath. “I’ve been different since I was a child, in many, many ways. As you can imagine. But as I got older I realised one of the ways that I was different was…this. It didn’t seem to matter, really, it wasn’t like I interacted much with the other boys at school anyway, and I was already interested in deduction and science and that took up most of my energy. But my family was…fairly traditionally minded, and it wouldn’t have gone well if I displayed such an interest openly, although I’m pretty sure my proclivities had been well-guessed by at least my mother and brother.”
Sherlock turns onto his stomach. John promptly straddles his waist and Sherlock is made vividly aware that John is also completely naked.
it. His anger at Sherlock has only grown over the course of the evening, as his mind began to process exactly what all had gone into the deception, how much conscious effort it had taken to leave him to his grief for two years.
“You’d…leave?”
John drained his too-strong coffee. Best get out of town as soon as possible. There’d be plenty of time to mull over Sherlock’s puzzle on the train. Then, once he had whatever blasted thing was in the deposit box, on to Finland to find Moran and hopefully Sherlock. He shivered. He was going to need some warmer clothes.
The second line read “
He listens at the door as Sherlock tells Mycroft the news, hating himself for every word that’s just come out of his mouth. None of it matters now.
Sherlock heard a step behind him and turned, pulling his gun and aiming it at a slim, shadowy figure ten metres beyond him.
“Who says I’m leaving the U.K.?” John asked, his voice carefully neutral.
“Neither am I,” John tells him. “And she won’t be expecting me. She’s not the only thing that’s incredibly dangerous.”
A passing member of the catering staff gives him a quizzical look. "What was that, sir?"
Her face lit up with recognition. “
Without another word, he dons his jacket and, laptop under one arm, follows Sherlock out the door.
“It was an accident,” she says too quickly, too late.
The only one he had any real contact with was Lestrade. He blamed Lestrade too, but the man seemed to accept it, patiently and with grace. He demanded that Lestrade investigate the incident. The prevailing story was that the poor, put-upon actor Richard Brook, whose life Sherlock had ruined with his lies, had been unable to stand it any longer and had shot himself on the roof in front of Sherlock. Sherlock had felt so guilt-ridden after this that he had confessed his fraud and taken his own life.
Sherlock opens his mouth and licks. It's the inside of John's wrist. He laps at it and then cranes his neck to follow all along the inside of John's arm to his axilla, raising gooseflesh under his mouth as he goes. "Salt... curry from dinner... coconuts... antiperspirant... sweat... copper... nutmeg."
"When have either of us had to ask? We belong to each other. Don't be stupid. Besides, we have the word, remember? You insisted we have it. I could have said it, but I didn't. I could have tried to stop you, really tried, but I didn't. It– you– were what I needed, even if I didn't know it right away. It's fine, John. It's good."
“Insecure brat,” John forces himself to say, still shaken from recent events but too selfish to keep putting up walls.
MY NIGHTMARE. I’M SO SORRY.
the same thing! I came here to make sure you didn’t die, because you didn’t leave me any other option. I wouldn’t have
John snorts. “Well. You did warn me at that. And if you’re offering, actually, that would be kind of a relief. I haven’t had a break since before… well, you know. Rosie’s growing so fast and there’s never enough time. But I’m not giving up medicine entirely. And you aren’t allowed to act like it’s a disposable hobby I’m just doing for lack of anything better. If I have patients, I have patients and casework - and you - will wait.”
“Yes. You’ve gotten so dim lately.”
“Why would anyone do that?”
“Right.” John pushes him off balance. Sherlock hits the hard floor with surprising lightness and John dives after him, straddling him while grabbing his slender wrists and using them to pin his arms over his head.
"Then what do you want?"
“Be still,” he orders, and John chuckles but complies.
Mystified he obeys, knocking on the door carefully.
Sherlock is silent, running his fingers through John’s short hair. Finally, he says. “Yes.” He kisses John, in an almost innocent way, and then takes a step back to look at him fully. He shakes off the emotional reaction to John’s gift that he’s been trying hide, and puts on a more devilish air.  “Maybe we should break in my new lab properly,” he says suggestively.
“No, I’m saying
Just as Sherlock reaches the top of the stairs, John calls out, “You got a call from Mycroft today.”
John smacks him on the bicep. “Arrogant narcissist. You still can’t tolerate sharing me, can you?”
Next thing he knows, he's struggling for consciousness and bound in a cold, dark place that is beginning to fill with smoke. He can't move or cry out, can't make sense of where he is or how he got there, and can barely hear the muffled sounds of people around him, somewhere out of sight. He feels damp and realises he's lying on leaves and bracken, twigs and sticks poking him.
John does so, haltingly. Sherlock lets his mind go to the pristine laboratory he’s created inside it for this purpose, building a model of the drug atom by atom and chain by chain, a super-scaled three dimensional molecule in his head.
Sherlock shifts uncomfortably amongst the baggage, sticking his hands under his arms to keep them warm. The flight would be a couple more hours in this two-engine death trap. Hopefully he wouldn’t have hypothermia at the end of it.
. Because
“Because I felt the strange urge to sterilize them after you used them test the rates at which human kidneys dissolve in difference kinds of acid.”
John tries his hardest to behave normally as well, to keep the resentment he can’t quite help feeling out of his tone and attitude, to be the same old friend, flatmate, partner he was before. But at night, alone in his room, without the hope of hearing that soft step on the stair, it is harder. He tells himself it is just temporary, that this state of affairs won’t endure forever, but as the days stretch on with no change, he is not sure he believes it.
That is a bad sign. John kisses his shoulder and pushes him gently onto the bed. “You’ve been overworking your brain, that’s all. It needs to rest. Let me see if I can make things brighter.”
I'M SORRY IF THIS HURTS, IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CLOSED, John tells him, tapping his foot against Sherlock's to keep his hands free.
She smiled sheepishly. “Nothing. Just lately I can’t seem to shake the feeling that when you text me that you’re coming over, you aren’t going to make it here.”
“Oh, obviously. Just sit down, will you?”
It’s very likely only the diplomatic intervention of John that prevents them from doing something nasty to him, but he hardly gives it a thought. That’s what John’s for, isn’t it? Either way, they eventually piss off, with a stern parting warning that Sherlock barely notices.
“Sherlock…I’m…worried about you. Not just because you’ve been working too hard.”
In the darkest hours of the early morning, he goes down to the docks. His target isn't hard to locate and, while the gangplank is guarded, the young man standing watch could not look less interested in his duty. He's chain smoking and looking at his mobile most of the time.
“Say it.”
Mycroft continues. “He insisted on doing things his own way, refused money or help, and without the structure of school or the support of family he was vulnerable. His manner put people off so he had a hard time getting private cases, and the police almost never believed him when he came with a solved case. He kept busy with experiments and writing papers and monographs about forensic techniques and related matters but it wasn’t enough for him. He started to rely more heavily on his chosen substances to maintain his sanity. And of course, he went too far.”
Sherlock ignores that and navigates to the location in the dwindling winter light. He doesn't go in right away. He's not a fool. He's seen how the man had reacted to the emblem of Les Butineuses - his warning was clearly the least of it. Sherlock won't be so careless again.
Sherlock locks onto John like a laser beam, but John has turned away again. His mind reels. John has been like this before, this shell, this open wound, this man so far away from the John Sherlock has come to rely on that it is literally dizzying, and it was because of Sherlock. He caused it and he wasn't even there to take John home afterward.
Sherlock barely has time to blink before Moriarty is gone. He straightens and walks to the edge of the roof, as sunset just begins. He smokes three more cigarettes in silence and then goes home.
John held his temper. “That’s the most you’ve said to me or to anyone else in over a week. I know this has something to do with what happened at the pool. It shook us both up. Just talk to me.”
He knocked on the door, pulling his coat tightly around him. It was starting to shade towards evening and the wind was picking up. A middle aged woman dressed in a leopard print track-suit, wearing far too much make-up and costume jewelry, answered after a short wait. She said nothing, just gave him a suspicious look and took a drag on her cigarette.
“Well, I knew the last part, yeah, but not so much before that.”
Sherlock processed that, nodded, and fled. John grinned at his retreating back. He knew he was being a little heartless, after all Sherlock had been through, but it was also working. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were, at least on some level, capable of having something approaching a functional relationship. Even if no one had bothered to tell Sherlock about it. Perhaps
John is with him, instantly, hand on his arm. "It's okay. I'm right here."
“Well?” Anthea says shortly. “Getting out?”
They give their statements and once things begin to die down no one pays attention to them, although they haven't been released officially. Sherlock, suddenly, impulsively, grabs John by the hand.
John shakes his head heavily, righteous anger and vitriol gone out of him now. He leans back against the desk, deflated. “She’s already attached. She’s a sixteen year old girl, Sherlock. For all that she’s like you, she feels
Instead, John forces a smile and grabs Sherlock’s hand, squeezing it a little too tightly. “Thank you…for telling me,” he says, and watches the sliver of trepidation in the corner of Sherlock’s eyes dissolve. He leans down and brushes Sherlock’s lips with his own, affectionate but not passionate, not quite able to push aside Sherlock’s revelation with the ease he feigns.  He fumbles for normalcy. “I think I’m going to hop in the shower.”
John stands and clears his throat. “Well, I haven’t seen the body, so I can’t be sure, but with this little blood I’d have to say she was either poisoned, strangled, or her neck was snapped, although I think the room would be in more disarray if she was physically attacked.”
It crumbles beneath him and Sherlock falls straight through, at least four metres to the stained marble below.
But he didn’t joke with him, he didn’t make any sarcastic comments, he didn’t ask any questions. He didn’t even rage at Sherlock, or storm out and go to the pub to get away from him – that would have been within the limits of what Sherlock still considered a good reaction. But this, this was a smooth, frigid anger, an anger that didn’t have any edges, didn’t leave any way in. It baffled Sherlock. He made a few attempts at gaining a foothold, once trying to provoke John into a fight, and then resorting quiet acts of apology – straightening up the flat, ordering John’s favourite takeaway for supper. Neither got him anywhere.
“Sure. I’ll bring my laptop and we can see if there’s anything good while we eat.”
“Shut up!” John snaps, even as he burns. “You can’t just… put me out in the cold like you have, for weeks. Shut me out of your bed, out of your thoughts, refuse to answer my questions, mope about over someone else and not explain any of it to me, and then just decide that suddenly, because you’re horny, I’m of interest again. It doesn’t work that way!”
. Why would you think that?”
Sherlock frowned. “I would have thought I’d be doing you a favor. Easier for you if I just wither away on my own.”
“Yeah, urgent, sure,” John says sarcastically.
Thankfully, on the fourth day, instead of what he had come to think of as his normal evening meal, he was brought a basin of water, soap, and a change of clothes. “Get washed and changed,” one guard said gruffly, as the other kept Sherlock carefully in his sights.
“Yes, the imposter seemed quite keen on it, like nothing else mattered. Maybe he just knew it was his quickest escape?”
He’s just about tear open Sherlock’s shirt with his teeth when he hears the unmistakable click of a gun being cocked.
“Sherlock…” he begins. The detective pauses at the threshold and turns, looking at him with pale, emotionless eyes.
It was scotch and he hated scotch, but he didn’t care. The two men sat, nursing their drinks as the computer did its work. They had seen plenty of each other over the past three months, but they had always been brief meetings to a specific purpose. The silence between them was uncomfortable.
Hanna purses her lips and shifts, crossing her legs. “Unfortunately, that is not the case for myself.”
Sherlock doesn't let his eyes narrow at this and instead feigns momentary curiosity. "How young?"
Sherlock’s heart stopped. “What have you done?”
John nods slowly.
fucker
TO BE HONEST LIKE I JUST DRANK A POT OF COFFEE. I'LL BE GLAD WHEN WE'RE OFF THE TUBE, I DON'T TRUST ANY OF THESE PEOPLE. AND THERE ARE SOUNDS. LIKE WINGS.
Sherlock looks uncomfortable and stares at the parquet floor.
At last, having rearranged the necessary space in his brain for this new concept, Sherlock dips his head and rests it against John’s temple. “Okay, John,” he murmurs.
Wait.
He lasted a couple weeks, and then asked Mrs. Hudson if he could move back in. She seemed relieved at his return, and continued to charge him only the portion of rent he had been paying when he and Sherlock had lived there together. She seemed nearly as bereft as he. He knew she had had sons, once, and that they were gone now, along with her monster of a husband. He sensed that she had considered him and Sherlock, especially Sherlock, as replacements for her lost boys. Oh, she loved them both but she had had a special place in her heart for Sherlock – he could do no wrong in her eyes.
"Right." John slams the book shut and goes into the kitchen, taking vegetables out of the fridge to make something for a late tea. He doesn't particularly know why - he's not hungry, Sherlock won't be eating, and he certainly has no intention of cooking for the Woman. But it gives him something to do with his hands that involves a knife. It helps.
John gives him a half-hearted smile and McNabb punches his arm lightly before disappearing with the others.
“John,” she begins. “I am so, so sorry.”
“Then you clearly haven’t read my file,” John said, and clubbed him in the back of the head with the gun. He went down instantly, and John rushed over to Sherlock. He cut his bonds and barely caught him as he slid out of the chair, weak and having lost circulation.
“I’m going now,” he tells her. “I’m going to fix this, all of it.” He touches his lips dryly to her injury, a sort-of apology, and turns to go.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, I’m so sorry you thought for a second this is your fault,” he whispers into them, unable to look the other man in the eye.
John sighs a bit a Sherlock’s typical rudeness, but it does seem to do the trick. Bryant carefully smoothes his shirt and begins to explain.
The back door is ajar, and John pushes it open as quietly as he can manage, entering into a filthy corridor, tensing for attack. None comes, but he can see in the dust Sherlock came this way. He gets his bearings. The house seems to be a dark warren of hallways and rooms leading into other rooms. Ambush could be anywhere. This is place is a death trap and smells of mould and rotting things.
“I was just getting to that. In the past month or so, things have been happening at my job that I haven’t had anything to do with. And yet my name is on the paperwork, or my ID card was used. People have said they saw me at the office at days or times when I know I wasn’t there. None of it’s bad, I haven’t gotten in trouble for anything. It’s all minor stuff within the range of normal office work. But I can verify that I was somewhere else or doing something else at the time a lot of it happened. Yet my coworkers insist that I was definitely there.”
Suddenly he feels hands on his waist from behind, warm breath smelling of toothpaste on the side of his face. He forces himself not to tense. “But, um, won’t be until this afternoon, is that all right?”
Nine hours into it, and they are no closer than when they’ve begun.
“Okay. Let’s start with the past few weeks. What’s new? Everything. List it.”
The slightest lightening of the sky is evident through the window. Rosie shifts in her cot, but hasn’t woken. John takes Sherlock’s hand again as they peer over the rails at the sleeping child, unruly dark curls fanned out around her fine-featured face.
"I know," John cuts him off angrily.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock says, helplessly. “When you asked me to be best man you said the same thing.”
Sherlock’s clear eyes are watching him intently, going from worried to relieved by the end of his speech. He half-laughs, but curtails it when he sees that John is deadly serious. “Is that all? John, I explained to you, it’s fine, you did the right thing. You’re the reason I’m here. You can let it go.” He looks at John expectantly, as if something so simple will fix it.
“So she wouldn’t have noticed the smell of the cyanide because she was already expecting to smell almonds, and the bitterness would have been hidden by the bitterness of the coffee,” John concludes “So he
“Not quite. Mr. Holmes? Care to do the honours?”
Her hair was short and blonde, her clothes a bit dowdy and out of style, but he recognized her at once. The Woman.
been spending too much time with Sherlock,” Mycroft says, a faint smile playing on his lips.
“Sherlock, I have no idea what I’m like any more,” John sighs. “And sometimes we don’t get to decide what we want. I’m sure everyone’s life would be a lot easier if we could all just feel the things we chose to feel. I know how I’ve been my whole life, but I also know that I feel good when you’re close to me, that I was terrified when I thought I was going to lose you, and that I…liked it when you kissed me. And the past two days have been too scary and insane for me to keep pretending those things aren’t true.”
"Haywire," John finishes, his eyes glassy and terror-filled.
“All right, out with it. What did you just learn?” John prods him.
After that the rest of the day is somewhat soured for John. The programme is still interesting, but he feels like he’s just going through the motions until it’s over. He’s more than ready to leave in the morning, skipping the closing breakfast.
John still won't look at him. He's staring straight ahead, unfocused and withdrawn. Sherlock stands beside, uncomfortable again after their moment of intimacy, confused about whether he most wants to resume it or to flee. He does neither, just waits and fidgets with his hands behind his back.
Sherlock feels the sting of the rebuke. “Thank you, brother,” he says stiffly and not entirely without sarcasm.
“I can pick up a Chinese on my way home…”
John grunts. This is not the first time Sherlock has wandered into the bathroom or bedroom or otherwise private area while thinking over a case out loud, and he has lost the will to train him out of it.
Sherlock inclines his head. “Perfectly reasonable precaution,” he agrees amiably. “I’m happy to go with you.”
She smiled and went to make some tea, which they drank in silence. When they were done she said, “Look, I just got in last night – came straight here, of course. But I need to go round my mum’s, talk to work about some things… do you want me to come back later, though?”
“What else is new?” John grumbles. “Might as well have let you talk to him.”
"Sherlock," John gasps, gulping for air. He's so clearly outlined now, more clearly than in real life, that Sherlock can read his glowing lips.
Sherlock is, very briefly, speechless. He recovers quickly, but John notices and becomes awkward. He hadn’t meant anything by it, just a joke between mates, but he definitely hit a nerve. When Sherlock returns to his topic of his own genius, John nods encouragingly but files away the incident in his head in case it’s needed later. He tries to think about his flatmate and sex as little as possible.
CAROLINE FOUND SOMETHING. SOMETHING WE'D ALL BEEN MISSING.
On the morning of the wedding he's caught by one of the numerous, nameless bridesmaids in the corridor. "Sherlock, Mary wants you," she chirps as she passes him on some errand of her own. "She's just down there, in that room."
“No. Sometimes it’s even more brilliant.”
John stays quiet beneath him, even the slight movement from Sherlock’s breathing sending shivers of pleasure through him. The heat from Sherlock’s body radiates into him, filling him up, suffusing him with joy. He has never felt anything so intimate in his life, as though they are a single creature, and he thinks he could stay like this forever.
Sherlock is out the door before John can even dial the Yard. It takes awhile to explain the solution, and by the time he loads his Sig and gets a taxi, he’s a good fifteen minutes behind Sherlock. He texts him furiously and at last receives an address – 12 Gardner Road – but nothing more.
Sherlock is surprised John was able to discern that much. “Yes. It shares a basic structure but there are sulphides not present in the original. And there’s mercury.”
Then Sherlock set fire to the house. “Well, that’s a pretty clear bugger off message,” John said, as they drove away from the inferno in the other truck. “Are you sure you aren’t planning on becoming some kind of supervillian? You’d be good at it.”
John ripped the pack open and dug out the tiny compartment. It was padded on the inside and contained a single coin. Chinese, by the look of it, ancient and in perfect condition. He opened another pack. A microchip. The next four contained two more microchips, another coin (Roman, this time), and a selection of small but perfectly cut gemstones.
It’s only at night that it still pains him sharply, when he starts awake and reaches for someone who isn’t there. But one day, someone is there, if not the one he was reaching for. Someone who’s not just a distracting tumble, which he finds he's lost his taste for. Someone who loves him, fiercely, protectively, abundantly. Someone, that he discovers to his amazement, that he is able to love.
John knows he should be angry that Sherlock kept all this from him, that he put him through so much pain. He is angry, really, but his anger is so tiny compared to the joy and relief of having his friend back that it seems utterly insignificant. He takes in the explanation wordlessly, just happy to listen to the smooth, sonorous voice again. When Sherlock is done he asks, “So… is it safe now?”
Sherlock doesn’t answer, having no frame of reference for what “all right” might be.
"It's fine, I'm decent. Come in!"
to me! In front of everyone!”
Sherlock is somehow both relieved and disappointed. He stretches and gets out of bed, retrieving his violin from the top of his dresser and beginning to play almost absently, attempting to soothe his frayed nerves. John closes his eyes and leans his head back, listening with obvious pleasure.
John decided the shower could wait until morning and allowed himself to melt into Sherlock’s embrace, pulling the blanket tightly around them both. Unconsciousness was taking him but he murmured, “Sherlock?”
“The only things I’m invested in are those tickets I bought to the New York Symphony that we didn’t get to use last night. That wasn’t exactly what I had envisioned for a date. Granted, Americans, nudity, and a riding crop were all part of the plan, but hardly in the combination that we ended up with.”
John kisses him again, even more forcefully, and Sherlock responds despite himself, pushing back up against him, biting at John’s tongue and feeling his lips bruise beneath John’s. John keeps talking, his fingers to Sherlock's throat as they kiss, like he'd rather be strangling him than speaking to him.
The obvious reference would be the province in the Netherlands – a meetup location, perhaps? If everything went wrong. But wouldn’t they have chosen somewhere nearer by to regroup? The area’s far too rural to be an important outpost for an international crime syndicate, unless their primary focus is on horses.
Molly approaches him carefully and the look of pity on her face is sickening. “No, John…I didn’t… He’s not… There was nothing to be done…”
“He came to see me today,” Sherlock tells John later that night.
Brilliant. Moran was making a business on smuggling the very small, in a way that was virtually undetectable. But where was it going? Where did Moran conduct his business from? John pored over the ledger for the rest of the morning and early afternoon. There were no addresses. That would have been too much to ask, John supposed. There were inventory lists and appraisal values that would be very useful in connecting Moran to criminal activity, but he was worried about finding his friend alive, not busting a smuggling ring – at least not yet.
But John’s face is stone and the laughter dies.
He manages a strangled howl of agony and spins around with difficulty before he falling to his knees, finding himself face to face with a youngish man, short, scruffy, and unattractive, with wild eyes. He is holding an fire iron, with which he has just struck John on the small of his back. He looks frightened, but ready to finish the job. Before he can raise his hand again Sherlock bursts out of the room, pistol aimed at the unkempt head.
As for the man himself… John knows he is not permitted to say the words to him. Sherlock, so disdainful of all sentiment, would view it as evidence of the weakness of John’s devotion to him, not its strength. So he tells him he’s mad and cracked and disturbed and a danger to society. He calls him a git and an idiot and a prat and a twat and every other name he can think of and Sherlock beams like John has written him a sonnet or carved his name into his chest.
Her nostrils flare, but she does take his arm, sidling up to him and giving a throaty laugh out of nowhere which is uncannily believable. They stroll out of the main ballroom and the instant they are out of sight of most of the guests, she drops the pleasant expression and moves to extricate her arm.
John feels sick and advances on his friend. “Why?” He’s seen this side of Sherlock before, but it’s never gone this far.
“The usual. Shower, get dressed, we need some shopping and I promised Lestrade I’d pop round and look at something for him – strictly a medical question, he said.”
“So, you’re just biding time with me until you can acquire the elements of a normal life?” Sherlock hisses. “A nubile girl who can shag you silly and bake pies and be a good wife, a house in the country, a private practice you can close up at six on the dot every day, a couple of tow-headed children? Oh, you’ll still come out on cases for a lark now and then, invite me round for Christmas dinner, but you’ll have a nice respectable life, the retired soldier, the country doctor, that no one could ever possibly object to!”
Two weeks after their return from Dartmoor everything seems fine. John forgave Sherlock his deeply hurtful comments on the basis that he was drugged and terrified at the time, and when they got home Sherlock made it up to him properly, over a long weekend. Things are going so well, he can almost forget about anything other than their immediate existence together.
They stop for groceries on the way back, always an adventure with Sherlock, but make it home having purchased only what they needed, plus one exotic fruit Sherlock suspects might be misidentified and poisonous, and a tin of some Spanish condiment he wants to try to turn into an explosive.
Sherlock feels himself relax, slowly. It was only the darkness in his own mind preventing him from observing. He had let it wrest control from him, but he wouldn’t repeat that mistake. Satisfied and relieved he turns his attention back to the cat burglar case, and it’s only a matter of minutes before the answer comes to him.
John follows Sherlock through dimly lit, perfectly manicured gardens. He doesn’t believe for a second asking him to dance represented only a simple whim on Sherlock’s part, but knows he’s not likely to get more than that out of the detective unless he decides to share. It doesn’t matter, really, just one more thing to add to the strangeness that has become his life. At least, as long as he can avoid thinking about how quickly his heart was beating when he was in Sherlock’s arms.
“I am well, I’m better than well, I’m fantastic! Why are we holding hands? Why am I wearing your trousers?” Sherlock looked down, confused. “Is there something we need to talk about?”
"I told you you didn't want to see that," Mycroft says. "It doesn't help anything."
“It wouldn’t happen at all if you didn’t constantly wander in here without asking,” Sherlock snaps.
“Because you’re—”
“Mycroft, I was six.”
is, don’t you Mr. Holmes? And he’s going to be seing you again very soon.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock alternated between pacing, sitting motionless staring at nothing, and occasionally committing random acts of destruction around the flat. He was normally thin and bony, but now he grew positively cadaverous. He did not appear to sleep and took only tea. John resorted to pouring as much milk and sugar as he dared into each cup, in an attempt to get some calories into the man. He was desperate to get out of the flat but was fearful of what Sherlock might do if he wasn’t there.
He casts about for Sherlock and finally spots him at the other end of the warehouse, engaged in furious hand to hand combat with their target. John moves closer, slowly, still feeling the stun grenade, but neither pay him any mind. He decides to let this play out for a moment. They seem pretty evenly matched and as much as John hates fighting women, fighting one he’s kissed just seems excessively wrong. Besides, it gives him a chance to admire Sherlock.
“I thought of that, but none of the local homes employ anyone who could fit those boots. He could have been a temporary worker, but then he wouldn’t have been there long enough to learn her habits. And everything about this fits a local crime.” Sherlock makes a noise of frustration.
It was decided that John could be released the next day. “He’ll need some care for a few weeks,” the doctor explained, “but nothing unmanageable as long as he stays still and behaves himself. We can arrange for a nurse to come in once a day to change his dressings, administer medication, and such, but is there someone at home who can take care of his meals and other needs?”
Of course it did. This was bad. John thought furiously, but he was out of ideas completely. Maybe this was the wrong box. Or maybe he just didn’t know whatever goddamn thing Sherlock thought he knew. Did they have any in-jokes he hadn’t thought of, something Sherlock would have found amusing to use as a password. Something about getting the milk? About John’s blog?
. Sherlock has discovered that nothing provides as good a distraction from a tough puzzle than a quick tumble with John. So good, in fact, that the solution often comes to him halfway through, leading to several incidents of Sherlock running off in the middle of things, leaving John frustrated, unfulfilled, and decidedly cranky about putting on his clothes and following Sherlock into the cold streets of London.
They rush to Bart’s where a package and two soldiers are waiting for them. Two large soldiers; Sherlock can feel their hulking presences tower over even him before they speak.
Sherlock opens his mouth to argue but John stops him with a sharp motion.
“You know Moriarty’s web of criminal associates spreads far beyond the Continent,” he’d said. “South America, Asia, North Africa. And that’s just what we know about. You won’t be safe anywhere. You’ll be lucky to sleep in a bed most nights. And I won’t be able to help you. If I can find you, others will be able to.  See to it that I can’t.”
“Mmm, don’t use up all the good ones at once,” John tells him, planting a kiss on his chest and getting something approximating a tiger’s purr in return.
John has never experienced something like this, with Sherlock or really anyone else. Sometimes it is hard for John to tell how much he means to Sherlock on a daily basis. He knows it, of course, but it can be difficult to remember in the middle of a case or when Sherlock is sulking or insulting him. But right now there is no such problem. Sherlock is being so obviously desirous, so tenderly playful and solicitous, that even the most irrational parts of John’s mind have no room to doubt.
“Good! Now add ten millilitres of potassium chloride to the solution.” Sherlock hears drops go into the beaker. “Well? It should be blue. Is it blue?”
Sherlock props himself up as well and peers at John over steepled fingers. “I said, it’s not light; it’s sound.” He’s watching John sharply for a reaction, like a predator, like a scientist, like a child who’s just confessed a misdeed all rolled into one.
John spins to face him, furious. “You’re talking about sex and our baby girl in the same sentence and you’re asking me to be
"You're not concerned about his fidelity?"
Sherlock vanishes to do whatever he needs to do to get ready. John trudges up the steps to his room, shaking his head. He’s not sure at exactly what point in the day he’d agreed to dye his hair and go undercover at the Ginger Society’s annual gala, but it appears that he has. He’s only moderately surprised to find a complete set of white-tie attire waiting for him in his room.
“Mycroft, it’s John Watson. Yes, of course you knew that, how ridiculous of me to even bother with basic manners. As a matter of fact I do want something. It’s a bit of a massive favour. Well, by my calculations you owe me a bit of a massive favour. Or three. Oh really? Would like me to list the ways I’ve kept your brother alive, clean, and out of jail over the past two years? All right,
“Love is a terrible thing,” Sherlock says bitterly as they get in the taxi back to Baker Street. “Look what it does. It destroys.”
“Is that your way of saying you’d like to stay here tonight?” John asks, a bit mischievously, trying to lighten the mood.
Presently, the machine starts, a deafening but smooth whir, so deep that it feels like it’s vibrating inside of his bones and teeth. John’s voice comes over the intercom, audible but muffled by the noise of the scanner. He’s telling Sherlock exactly what’s happening. It’s reassuring to have his voice, but too much work to pay attention to. Trusting that John is watching out, he turns inward, returning to the case of the cat burglar.
Sherlock froze, still on him, face inches from John’s own.
“Problem, Mycroft?” Sherlock asks in a bored tone, striding in briskly and throwing himself down on one of his brother’s antique French chairs, putting his feet on the pre-Revolution upholstery. “I’m really very busy today.”
“This isn’t about that case. I’m sorry, I know it’s late but I need your help and I’m afraid it’s rather urgent.”
His mind focused suddenly, with laser-like precision on a small piece of paper. Of course! How could he have been so blind? The answer had been staring him in the face for days, and he had ignored it, obstinately, time and time again. He groped blindly for consciousness, struggling through layers of exhaustion and chemicals, searching for a signpost that would help him get back to the world. His tether – a warm hand in his, anchoring a body that felt so far away. He went towards it.
“Do you think that was dramatic enough?” John needles, upon catching up with his lanky companion. “Would you like to try it again and be a bit more mysterious?”
“Dead,” Lestrade says. “I’ll need a statement from you, when you’re feeling better.”
“All right,” he says at last, body on fire and thoughts rapidly dissolving in his head. “But there will be no screaming.”
“A dark nebula,” Sherlock says, pondering. “If you prefer.” He pauses for a long minute. “Did you mean it?”
Sherlock's now alone on the tube and not at all sure where he is.
“Molly, we agreed…” Sherlock is baffled. “You said you wanted to help me.”
"No!"
John laughs at him. "You've used the word in proximity to me twice in all the time we've known each other, you recalcitrant twit, and neither time said it
The first time that night was fast and desperate and a blur, like teenagers fumbling at each other. They barely managed to get each other fully undressed before they came at nearly the same time, unable to hold out once bare flesh at last pressed together. John found himself chuckling delightedly as they broke apart, earning a concerned look from Sherlock until he started kissing every available inch of skin, tickling him with his stubble and making Sherlock giggle as well, and shake off his painful self-consciousness.
John nods. Of course, he’s right. And for a moment, John is furious with him for it, for stopping the mistake. But it doesn’t last, because if anything is clear, it’s that the other man is in almost as much pain as he is. He reaches out almost involuntarily and strokes his back with what he hopes is friendly and platonic reassurance.
“Sherlock,” John says, squeezing Sherlock’s thigh through the satin of his – he hopes – red dressing grown. “We’re going to solve this. We are. I promise. But after today, we both know it might take a while. I think you need to figure out how to function… like this. Because you might have to.”
She clears her throat. “Boys, we’re paying attention to me now. And you can get up and put yourselves back together. I really don’t need to see what happens next here.”
"The iceman and the virgin...but which is which?"
John’s cock is heavy in his hands and he holds it gingerly, like he’s cupping a baby bird, in awe of the fact that he is permitted this privilege, this intimacy. John grows harder at his touch, as he twists his fingers into the pale, curly hair and follows the curve of his testes, trying to memorize every facet. The scent of John curls into his nostrils, strong and musky and unapologetically male and dewy drops glisten on his slit. Without thinking, Sherlock dips his head and licks John’s tip, taking in the sharp, salty, precious liquid. John moans again and presses into Sherlock’s mouth, gentle but insistent, and Sherlock opens to accommodate him.
"No. I owe you this. I can do this. It's good, it's better. I won't accept the alternative."
shouldn’t have forged my name on anything. But you’re right. We’re a family already and we came by it the longest and most difficult way possible. We decided a long time ago we’d never let each other go again. Anything else is trivial, just as you said.”
a term of endearment.”
Lestrade was more than happy for the change of topic. “Here, don’t go in there like that. I brought you some clothes from your flat.”
But Victor finds the will. After another endless second, he disentangles himself from John with obvious reluctance and shifts back on the sofa, putting the barest modicum of distance between them.
you want? What did you think would happen?”
“Five.”
“Ah, gently!” John mumbles between kisses. “I
Sherlock scowled. “We can discuss the terms of my statement later,” he said coldly. “Right now I have more important things to attend to.”
The man freezes and John wrests the branch from his hands and bludgeons him hard in the back of the head. He falls, out cold.
“No, I mean, I have one,” John said. “Here. I need to get into it. Um, now.”
One wall is given over to a giant mural of the periodic table. There's a sand and water table where the lab bench used to be. And in the far corner a low bookshelf is filled with every educational children's book the woman at the bookshop had wanted to sell him, as well as quite a few advanced texts. Most children's books are rubbish.
Sherlock moans, nearly a whinge, and starts to get up. John climbs off him and sits next to him on the sofa. “Do you really want to know? You’re not going to like it.”
"I didn't know I knew how to do that," he says to himself, out loud.
The truth of this hits John like a freight train.
IT MUST BE. John agrees. WE MUST HAVE MISSED IT SOMEHOW.
John supposes he should be relieved by this, but he’s not. “But there’s something though, isn’t there?”
John's been reading for more than an hour, failing to take any of it in, when he hears the woman mutter to herself.
“Oh, Caroline your ex?” Sherlock asks nastily.
“Why?”
"I'm still a doctor. I can still be that. I don't..." he stumbles. "I don't know if I can move past this. But I have to at least...move. Does that make sense?"
“No use pretending you don’t have them,” John says firmly. “But maybe feelings isn’t quite right… More like how you are perceiving me and the things around you, like the clues from a crime scene. I think your brain is taking all that input, bouncing it off of me and interpreting it as brightness.”
"Yes?" Sherlock says uncertainly. "That is all right, isn't it? You don't have to... I mean if you don't want to, it's fine. She'll have a place here for whenever you do want..."
How is he supposed to stay with him when Sherlock won’t let John near him?
"Glad I can help," John tells him, putting his head back down.
With difficulty, John forced himself to think, to tear his mouth away from Sherlock’s and form the word, “No.”
“Alright. Did you love him?”
And, of course, Mycroft is right – he will never find all of Moriarty’s associates much less bring them to justice. But that’s not the point of this exercise. Criminals are not notorious loyal, particularly past death. But Moriarty would have accounted for that, he would have installed ways to make sure his orders regarding Sherlock stayed in place long after he was gone. That system, whatever it was, is what Sherlock needs to dismantle in order to get his life back.
He rolls off of Sherlock, and off of the bed, taking hold of Sherlock’s feet and pulling him sharply to the edge of the mattress. He kneels prayerfully between Sherlock’s legs and Sherlock pushes himself up on his elbows to watch as John slowly eases the waistband of his pyjama bottoms down, bit by tiny bit, like he is revealing a precious treasure.
“Surely, you understand what this means. The level of…attachment… this action shows.”
“Hanna Mihov. Alias Lady Sienna Forsythe. Alias Heidi Dunburger. Alias… well, let’s just say that doesn’t even scratch the surface, eh? You encountered her on that counterfeiting case. What did you call it on your blog, The Red-Handed Red-Head?”
“Dutch. It’s a province of the Netherlands. And the name of any number of companies in the region…a bank, a dairy corporation, a defunct oil company, a non-profit organization for children with disabilities. I ran it down a bit, but nothing suspicious and no connexion I could find to her or…
He glances around the compartment and his gaze falls on a laptop. He realises she's been trying not to look at it the entire time he's been in the room. "I will be taking that, though."
“I still doubt I’ll need to.”
Sherlock hopes he replies calmly. “No, John. It would appear that I have lost my hearing in addition to my sight.”
A slight tensing of Sherlock’s shoulder blades is the only sign that he’s heard, and John walks out the door without another look at him, slamming it behind him.
He takes a step forward, intending to follow Sherlock’s path. He hears a click and instinctively dives to the floor as something zooms just above his head and sticks in the opposing wall. Crossbow, mounted out of sight. Jesus, the whole place was probably rigged – that was the kind of mind they were dealing with.
“He was very tall and pale, sir. English, like you. He wore a long coat and had dark hair, and cold eyes. He said the usual contact was no longer in Mr. Moran’s employ, that he was taking over the position and that I should prepare a shipment immediately. I told him that one was not due for another month, only half the items had arrived, but he said Mr. Moran wanted everything I had at once. I did as he told me, and he said he would return to collect it personally and that I should not send it with anyone else. But that was two weeks ago and I have had no word.”
“Fine,” Lestrade said. “We’ll do it without your statement then. I can’t prosecute a corpse, which is what I’d have if I gave you 30 seconds alone with him at this point.”
Sherlock shakes his head. "Let's get breakfast first. And then take the tube."
It almost breaks him. Almost destroys the carefully constructed alternate reality in which they are mates and anything else there was to it is only a distant, perhaps fond, memory – if it happened at all. He tamps back those thoughts, locking the door to that room firmly. It works, well enough, and he continues on, smoothly taking over his own duties and then pretty much everyone else’s in his meticulously crafted obsession to ensure complete perfection for John and Mary’s wedding.
– and things will not go well for you. Do we have an understanding?”
“You have a rather sick kind of genius,” John tells him. “It must run in the family.”
John makes a noise of utter frustration and shoves the microscope halfway across the table, forcing Sherlock’s annoyed attention back to him. “No, no, no. This, this is different. This is just one boy. A
The rush of relief Sherlock feels at the physical assurance now of John's forgiveness, at having the small, solid form in his arms again, at the heat and smell and taste of John in his senses, is so strong it takes him by surprise, threatening his composure. He channels the wave of feelings into the physical, crushing John closer, tangling their legs and arms, ready to shred John's clothes off him with bare hands if necessary.
His hand gripped the arm of the chair in John’s room, as John slept, and he realized he was craving a hit. He hadn’t in months, but the physical and mental stress of the past 24 hours was beginning to eat at him, and his mind was spiraling into dark places. He kept thinking about Moriarty. Moriarty with John strapped to a bomb. Moriarty with laser sights on John. John lying motionless on the pier. Had that been Moriarty’s doing, his opening gambit? Unlikely. It was too direct, lacking in elegance. He could not begin to deduce Moriarty’s plan until the other man made a move, and until then he was vulnerable on every side. And once he did make a move, it might be too late.
"That... wasn't actually sarcastic, was it? Are you sure I haven't broken your brain?" John's starting to look worried again.
Two days. It takes just two days for Moriarty to destroy everything Sherlock has built, everything they have together, and John can do nothing to stop it. All his loyalty, all his defence of Sherlock, his willingness to turn fugitive and go on the run from the law with him, none of it amounts to anything. It plays right into Moriarty’s hands.
"Are you going to kill me, Doctor?" she asks in a hoarse whisper, using what little air he's allowing through her windpipe. "You never struck me as a murderer."
Victor Trevor is more than a little surprised when Sherlock fetches up on the doorstep of Corvin Castle late that night, totally unannounced and damp through from the fog. He handles it with aplomb, as he would do even if it were a less welcome visitor than his old friend.
John nods not even noticing that Sherlock doesn't need Morse anymore, and tosses him a small glass vial with an old-fashioned aerosol pump. His eyes are darting back and forth, not scanning like Sherlock's do, but orbiting madly, as if seeing too many things at once. Likewise his whole body is tense, twitching, jumping wildly on a small scale. He's trying to keep himself in check, but it's not going well, Sherlock decides.
fun for you, wasn’t it? Tell me!”
"You are a very interesting man, John," she says. "Better looking than I thought at first, too."
Lestrade chuckles and turns to John. “Good to see you, John. Surprised you didn’t turn up yesterday. Finally found something better to do than trail after this bastard?”
Sherlock smiled and did up his coat, one button at a time. He turned up his collar. “Well, since you’re so worried about it,” he said, taking another, more forceful step forward, pushing Moriarty back with sheer strength of will. “I will tell you what I’ve done and you can tell me how you think it
Sherlock irritably grabbed the cup and the toast, and took a swig and a bite. “Ugh. Strawberry,” he threw the piece of toast across the room where it stuck to the wall for a moment before sliding down to the floor, leaving a red streak on the wallpaper. “And is there actually any tea
John sighs, not optimistic. “Better than nothing, I guess.”
There's silence on the line for a second, but then, with disarming mildness, Lestrade's voice says slowly, "Well, that's fine with me. I've been trying to you get down here for days. Don't you ever read Mrs. Hudson's notes? I need to talk to you about someone."
John looked at her in amazement, too dumbfounded to speak.
By five am Sherlock can’t take it anymore. He bolts up the stairs, ready to burst into the bedroom and demand an explanation, the sanctity of a sleeping child be damned. Instead, he nearly trips over John, sitting on the floor of the narrow hall with his back against the door. Sherlock steadies himself on the lintel, awkwardly, wind taken out of him.
He spun. Moriarty was inches from his face.
He was grateful his own paranoia had caused him to keep virtually all his things in his bag with him when he had left – he still had most of his clothes, his phone, his laptop, and his money. Assuming he could get out of the city without being detected, his next stop had to be Finland; if that really was where Moran was based, then Sherlock would likely be there. Suddenly, he remembered the letter in his pocket. He fumbled for it and ripped it open.
John realises Sherlock cannot possibly articulate what he's asking for, and moves closer to him, putting his arms loosely around Sherlock's slender waist as he does when he knows Sherlock is unsure.
“An incandescent lightbulb,” Sherlock replies. He puts up his hands and traces the line of John’s head and shoulders, about twelve centimetres away from his actual skin, like he can see and touch an aura John is unaware of.
The man snorts. “You’re late, then. Les Butineuses dissolved about a month ago, along with a dozen other outfits in the region. I don’t know what happened, but there’s a lot business suddenly up for grabs and a lot of people trying to consolidate power.”
Sherlock agrees and once everything is settled with the Yard, willingly lies down with John. He drifts off much faster than he thought he could, untroubled by the bright light that must be filtering through the curtains.
“I’m here on behalf of Mr. Moran. He’s very concerned about the lateness of the most recent shipment.”
SHERLOCK, SHERLOCK, I’M SORRY, I WENT TOO FAR. I SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT. NOT WHEN I WAS SO ANGRY, NOT LIKE THAT. DID I HURT YOU? I WAS WRONG TO HAVE. I'M SORRY.
He shrugs. "Even nice guys end up in bad business. Besides. I'm not nice all the time." He grins rakishly and offers her his arm once more. "Care for a stroll? It's rather romantic in here."
Sherlock digests this calmly. “So… instead of or in addition to something else, I experience the optical illusion of light radiating off of you?”
“I told you that was done.”
Sherlock Holmes is a fucking nightmare. And John Watson loves every minute of it. He had known that this was how it would be; any kind of relationship with Sherlock had to be, on some level, hellish. But knowing it and living it are very different things. Not that he has regrets, it’s just a lot to deal with. But he loves it, all of it. Well, almost all of it.
“He’s outside. He could get anywhere in these woods, and in rain this heavy the footprints won’t last. We have to follow him now!”
“We keep our heads down, stick to our business, and don’t let our eyes get bigger than our stomachs.”
John holds up his hands defensively, in an attempt to placate her. "Are you sure you're not actually a red-head? Calm down. I'm just here to check in with you and make sure things are going smoothly. That's it. There's no problem, no one thinks you aren't handling it well. It's just a very valuable... job. They want to make sure you have what you need."
Together they make their way up to the fourth floor, John watching their flank, tense and at the ready. Sherlock successfully navigates them past several more traps.
“Mycroft, please!” John fairly shouts at him. “Really!”
“Maybe you should have been.” She turned to him. “Go on, ask me. I know you’ve been dying to know. Ask.”
Sherlock looks bewildered. “But I need–”
Puzzled, John obeys without argument. Sherlock stands and comes towards him, a single, deliberate step at a time. “Dim… less dim… brighter… brighter…” he mutters. He stops about halfway to John and takes a few steps backwards. “Dimmer…dimmer…”
"That was... a good idea." Sherlock tells him roughly, still overwhelmed as he often is after they are together. The combination of the physical sensation on his already hyperaware nervous system and the flood and exchange of emotions that he doesn't understand but knows are important often leaves him next to speechless for minutes or hours.
live with it, instead of always wondering. But I can't do this anymore."
They were back at the start now, in the little pool of light from the trapdoor. Sherlock slammed Moriarty against the ladder.  “And if anyone harms so much has a hair on my head or on the heads of those around me, you will suffer the most painful death anyone in England can possibly devise.”
“Well, it’s actually a bit beyond that, sir. No animal products at all, not in food or cosmetics or clothing.”
John felt the walls he had carefully constructed over the past few months begin to crumble. He had not had a complete meltdown of the cathartic sobbing variety that he had always assumed you were supposed to have as part of the grieving process; he had hardly even cried since the day it happened except for when he said goodbye at the grave. Even now, he did not lose it entirely – he was afraid if he lost control completely he might well and truly go mad. But tears began to roll down his cheeks, silently, and he let them come, closing his eyes and concentrating on the feeling of Sarah’s heartbeat against his shoulder.
. If there's work to be had for your... skills, you'll find it there. But watch how you flash that symbol - there's a reason they're not around anymore."
John feels the last remnants of doubt leave him, replaced by a physical hunger, a need to feel his friend both inside and out that is so deep it is almost frightening, as if he will actually die without it.
Two updates in two days? What kind of insanity is this? Just trying to make up for lost time on this thing. =)
“It’s just a trick, just a magic trick,” the beloved voice tells him, and he doesn’t believe it for a second. Even when he says, “Goodbye, John,” and plunges over the edge, John doesn’t believe it, not his words, not his actions. It can’t be possible that this is happening. Not even when he hears the sickening sound of Sherlock hitting the pavement.
John jumps to his feet in frustration and Sherlock can picture him clenching his fists at his sides so as to not say something he'll regret. "How about Molly?" he asks after a few seconds. "Can Molly know?"
“I don’t believe that was my question,” Sherlock said, struggling to sit up. He began unhooking himself from the various IVs and monitors they had him tangled up in. Machines beeped and nurses ran in to check on him, thinking he was coding, but Lestrade waved them off.
“But I have work,” John protested.
“Recalcitrant maniac.”
“For the same reason you were tracking me. You have something I want, and you need things from me.”
John inspects him carefully, warily, looking for a chink. He looks worried, now.
In a swift movement, Sherlock  grabs his wrists and pins them to the wall above his head with one hand. “Say you’re not going to leave me!” he growls.
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T HURT YOU. BUT I STILL DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT IT. I GOT A GLIMPSE OF SOMEONE INSIDE ME THAT I DON'T LIKE. THAT'S SOMETHING I JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH I SUPPOSE.
“The calluses are a centimetre too low, but have been there a long time. He’s holding his clubs wrong, either resulting in him being poor at the game or because he can’t be bothered to learn the right way, after all these years. Either way, he’s not likely to be having much fun at it. Continue, please.”
“What are you so cheerful about, anyway?” he snaps. “She got away.”
When John’s finished, trembling with the aftershocks, he hauls Sherlock to his feet by his lapels and kisses the still-sloppy mouth. “You are a very bad man,” he informs Sherlock, as he puts himself back together. “A right wanker. You’re going to pay for that when we get home.”
Sherlock nods in reluctant agreement.
John’s eyes widened with sudden anger. “
Mycroft waves a hand with his usual air of condescension, "Of course I do. It's a fool's errand, you're playing right into Moriarty's posthumous hand. You should have let me handle this from the beginning, and now you're in an impossible position. Haring off after the remains of his empire isn't likely to improve things and is, in fact, very likely to get you killed properly this time. But it's far too late for me to do anything about it - you've been
"You're looking for a connexion?"
“Intolerable!” Sherlock sat bolt upright. “What’s intolerable is that they stop! You’ve been teasing me for a solid week, and I’ve been trying to do as you’ve asked and wait, but really you have been too cruel.”
“So, someone who spends a lot of time gardening. Maybe a groundskeeper, from one of the nearby houses? Had a grudge…or…or an obsession of some kind?” John can tell the answer is close, he feels it and Sherlock has that expression he gets when he’s just on the edge of a solution, groping for it through the fog.
“Not impressive?”
She looks down as if she'd not noticed before and curses in a language unfamiliar to him. Then she waves it away as if it's of no importance. “Does it matter to you what thieves do to each other? Say I aimed too high and this was my reward. That’s not why you’re here.”
As they go, the youngest of the group, a lieutenant named McNabb, lags behind long enough to tell John, quietly, “I read your blog, it’s brilliant! And you and that detective fellow, Holmes? It’s… well, I think it’s nice is all. Good for you.”
Sherlock spends the time he's not memorising the streets in various uncharismatic drinking establishments, consuming significantly less beer than he makes it appear and answering any attempt at conversation in terse, passable Dutch with a heavy lower-class Parisian accent. It's not hard to discern which of these play host to illicit activities and which merely harbour day-drunk bums.
“I borrowed it.”
“Are you going to kill me?” he asked, trying to sound defiant, but with fear writ large in his features.
“So you think you’d regret it, then,” Sherlock said flatly.
. They have no need of a marriage, they’d already said forever to each other, this is just tying up the loose ends in the eyes of the law. But then if John does consider a civil partnership the same as a marriage and is so violently against it, what does that mean?
Sherlock finally turns to meet John’s eyes and looks him up and down for a moment. “No.”
John boggles at him, speechless. Before he can collect himself, Rosie stirs again, waking fully this time. She opens her mouth to cry but the sight of both of them right there startles her out of it. John goes to pick her up but before he can, she reaches out for Sherlock.
“Looks like.”
John trails off and Sherlock knows he should answer him, say all the half formed thoughts and feelings that John needs to hear from him, but he’s frozen, overwhelmed, still a little disbelieving. At last he nods infinitesimally, afraid that if he moves too much the moment will pop like a soap bubble and leave him alone again, afraid that John is the one who isn’t real.
“Come off it,” she scoffs. “He wouldn’t have seen you unless you wanted him to. You were hiding from having to watch him come apart, so you could convince yourself he would recover. He won’t, you know.”
“You see it now, don’t you?” Mycroft continues, sounding almost compassionate. “You must let him move on, accept that no matter how willing you are to be there for him, he may not be able to be there for you. That’s implicit in whatever foolish promises you’ve made to him. And likely the only way you’ll be allowed in his life at all.”
“Because, based on your reputation, I assumed that it would end poorly for me. Hard to operate an international criminal network when one’s head is no longer attached to one’s neck.”
? Did you really think I was actually safe like that, that you could just step back into our life here without any consequences? My God, Sherlock, I nearly –”
John doesn’t respond. He’s not in the mood to shout a conversation between floors, and is certainly not going to run downstairs to find out whatever ridiculous thing Sherlock wants. He gives it 45 seconds. At 46 seconds he hears footsteps pounding up the stairs.
“You did the same th—”
That stings. John turns abruptly and walks away from him, to the limits of the room, and puts a hand to his temple, staring blankly at the patterned wallpaper before him. “Yes, Sherlock. The only reason I’m here is for the excitement. I put up with all your shite and your moods and your insufferable arrogance just for the fun of it. I don’t care about you at all. Fuck off.”
The steel in his voice halts further protests from Victor. “All right,” he says. “Then I’ll come with you.”
“It did take some sleuthing, but there’s always records of these things if you can get people to give them to you. Most of the crude oil tankers, the really big ones, were sold to a large oil concern out of Dubai – you wouldn’t know it. The smaller product tankers were mostly scrapped, they were older and not in good shape. A few went to various smaller companies, all names I know, for continued use in their original function. But one,
"So they're expanding, then?"
Sherlock pulls away abruptly. “Sofa,” he orders, and harshly pushes John over and down on it, climbing astride him and tugging at his clothing impatiently.
At last John asks, “Will you talk to me?”
“Pardon?” Sherlock furrows his brow.
“Um, good evening,” John began. “I’m here about the room?”
“Sherlock?” John asks, gently.
“That’s interesting,” John comments on the tune, which is slow but rich and vibrant. “Have you played that before?”
“Thanks for that,” John says dryly.
The flat is lovely and the location perfect, but the flatmate is frankly bonkers and for some reason John likes that. The more people who tell him to stay away from Sherlock Holmes, the more stubbornly he sticks to him. He is aware, vaguely, that the man is showing off for him, trying to please him in an odd way, and that this is unusual. Not the showing off, the wanting approval from someone who, really, shouldn’t matter to him one bit.
Now Sherlock 's confused, because of course it was good, it did exactly what it was supposed to do. But he doesn't press John about it because he's suddenly distracted by the fact that it's still bright behind his eyes. It’s not just the fading afterglow in his mind. He can see something. There's a shape to it, areas of brightness and darkness.
I'm pulling for him."
Victor looks scandalised. "Justin? I've known him since he was twelve!"
"Tea lights, floating on a pool. It's soothing."
John breaks the kiss after long seconds but leaves his face right there; Sherlock can smell John's breath and feel spittle fleck his face as John speaks with mouth and hands at the same time. He’s yelling, screaming at Sherlock, uncaring that his friend can’t hear him.
John closes his eyes, furious at both Holmes brothers for putting him in this position, and even more furious at Mycroft for being right. “All right. But I’m not doing it for you.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to answer and vomits all over John’s shoes.
John grins and doesn’t need to ask what he’s talking about. He pulls Sherlock closer and kisses his temple.
"Do you want me to leave you alone?"
"Very funny. You're using the vital intelligence resources of the British Crown to toy with me now?"
John didn’t know what he wanted, really. Sometimes he felt he wanted more, but he didn’t know what
Sherlock’s suit is perfectly tailored, and orders of magnitude more expensive than John’s rented one. It accentuates his tallness, nipping in perfectly at his slender waist while managing to highlight his broad shoulders. His hair is tamed for once, curls shiny and neat against his head. He looks like the product of a bygone era, suave and polished. At some point John stops thinking about how uncomfortable dancing with his flatmate in front of society elite is, stops worrying about people talking, and sees only him as they glide across the dance floor, inches away, touching, and yet somehow still unreachable.
, but you really haven’t been taking care of yourself. I can see every rib. This simply won’t do.”
John reaches up and smears a thumb along the knife edge of Sherlock’s cheekbone, smooth and untouched by the wrinkles that crowd his eyes and mouth. “Now you see what I was so upset about. But I suppose it can’t be helped. She has to grow up eventually and that means there are going to be boys. Probably more than just this one. She can’t just rattle around this house with us old sods forever.”
“I really don’t. I did exactly what you told me. If you didn’t get what you needed, that’s entirely your fault.”
“No. The police did when they finally showed up.”
This was the first concrete proof he had had of Sherlock’s being solidly alive, and it was almost too much for him. John forced himself to keep it together. There would be time for emotional displays when he actually found him. He squinted at the tiny writing. It said “
John thinks it too, Sherlock can tell, his hands are shaking just a bit and he starts to talk about how they should go home, get some rest, come at it tomorrow, maybe Sherlock will feel better. Sherlock barely registers his words. As soon as he thinks it, permanent, degenerative, it's the only thing in his head and he knows it to be true. He’s tried so hard not to think it, to do as John’s asked and stay hopeful, but he can’t any longer. The words echo and grow within him.
Sherlock's eyes fly open and he inhales in one startled breath, "The man in the train station!"
John shakes his head, wide eyed. "No, they're almost here. Please. Please Sherlock, run!"
John reads:
“Only if we can do that again,” Sherlock answers. “I think I’d like to do that again. I think it was…good.”
John shouldn't be surprised that Victor is quick to catch on. After all, Sherlock Holmes had loved him, once.
“What kind of a name?” John asked, leaning over Lestrade’s shoulder.
When Sherlock reaches John he still has three women, all out of his league, vying for his attention. Sherlock supposes it is the formalwear – John looks good in a tux.  Sherlock dispatches his friend’s hangers-on with a quick, icy glare and, snatching an entire tray of delicate pastries off a waiter, collapses into a chair next to John.
John jumps, hits his head on the lintel, and curses. Mrs. Hudson looks surprised.
She smiled a droll smile. “I’m not being cruel, Dr. Watson, I promise. And I know you do care, or you wouldn’t be so angry with me. But I’m not quite done yet. I know people, and I know men in particular. And he did love me, in his way, otherwise he would not have gone to such great lengths to save me and even if he had, he certainly wouldn’t have kept it hidden from you if I meant nothing to him. But it doesn’t matter, because he didn’t want to be
“It took you a week to solve it, that doesn’t sound
Moran heard the click of a gun being cocked at the exact moment Sherlock said the words, and froze. John had indeed slipped up silently behind him while he was speaking, moving so slowly and quietly, sticking so well to the shadows that even Sherlock had not noticed immediately, although he was not precisely at the height of his powers of observation.
He holds it together until they reach the relative safety of the flat. But once he’s inside he can’t contain it any longer. He shakes John off him and lashes out, aimlessly, full of rage and despair. His fist connects with the wall and he feels the crash as the steer skull falls from its mount. His hip bangs painfully into the sharp corner of the desk and he pushes it, overturning it, before spinning around and grabbing the lamp, smashing it into another wall. His hand feels warm and wet and he realizes he must have sliced it up, but it doesn’t seem to matter.
“He’s more than smart,” Sherlock snarled, rounding on him. “He’s a genius. And he controls more people and money than even I can calculate. He won’t be found until he wants to be. I’ve gone over everything, every detail, and there’s nothing that would lead me to him. Not a fibre, not a fingerprint, not a smell, not a mote of dust. I’m sure he’s watching us, but we won’t see him until he decides it’s time to finish the game.”
He swears wearily, crumpling the jacket under one arm, and starts looking for the nearest exit.
“Beyond what I learned from your criminal files? You are a hunter, obviously, but you only like to hunt dangerous game – not just animals, but people and treasure as well, anything that makes you feel like you have bested a worthy opponent. You think this makes you courageous, but in fact you are a coward and never allow yourself to be in a situation where any real harm is likely to come to you. You want to be perceived as a leader of men and a gentleman criminal, but you bear far more resemblance to a thug, albeit a successful and moderately intelligent one, who employs other thugs and has ambition but no true brilliance.
"Unacceptable," Sherlock snaps. "I'll be a target, instantly. I already am."
“Mrs. Hudson, again, so sorry! What Sherlock means to say is that we really appreciate all the things you do for us and we will be very, very careful in the future to not um… impose our personal life upon you by accident. And to say sorry.
John's face is iron and unreadable. He doesn't move or respond and Sherlock comes to a stop just in front of him.
“Do you mind if I ask…how do you make this work?”
A bit, great. John’s German was terrible but hopefully it was better than her English. “
Sherlock blinks at John and swallows dryly, moving nearer to the doctor. “My heart was broken once,” he murmurs, as if he is speaking from a long way off.
“It will come the usual way.
Sherlock took the gloves and put them on.
The man stands warily and the officers tense. Sherlock looks him up and down, circling around and inspecting him careful. “This is the wrong man, it can’t be him! What are you playing at, Lestrade? Let this poor sod go and go get the right one, before he makes a run for it! He’ll know you’ve been sniffing around the shop, you’ll be lucky if he isn’t halfway to Bristol already.”
John sighed, tolerantly. “I don’t suppose you’ll be wanting to get some sleep before then, will you?”
Sherlock gives him a brief smile of approval. “Violin concerto, second movement.”
“I promise, John.”
"Help me up, please. I believe I've injured my ankle."
“That you are careless with yourself. I don’t mean the not eating or sleeping, I know that’s just how you’re wired. But…you hurt yourself on purpose and you think you have a reason, and maybe sometimes it
Sherlock feels his climax begin to grow, a barely remembered sensation known only from distant teenage wankings, starting in his belly and spreading out through his pelvis, his spine, his buttocks and at last between his legs, unstoppable now. He stills and jerks and John stops his stroking and just holds them together as Sherlock shudders under his hand, hips twitching and pressing into John’s body. Sherlock can feel the warm wetness of his orgasm spreading between them, slicking their stomachs, their cocks, John’s hand.
“Can it wait? I’m just about to
“Occasionally,” John replies calmly. “The drugs could have done some reorganising up there. But I was actually referring to your extreme intelligence, powers of memory and observation, your synaesthesia, and all the other things that make your mind unique. Sherlock, your brain isn’t like anyone else’s in the world. There’s no reason to think it would react like it. The Baskerville drug… it’s a possibility.”
Sherlock sniffs. “Not this healthy. Spelt and tofu? Does that even qualify as food?” he asks in a new, posh accent.
"Yes. You're good with that sort of thing, relatively attractive, non-threatening..."
“Me? No, not at all. He might, though.” Sherlock motioned to John, and Moran cringed visibly. “But I thought instead I would offer you a business proposition, since you are so fond of them. In exchange for my letting you go and not allowing John here to kill you in the manner he so chooses, you will leave here and never return. You will make no attempt to resume your previous activities, and you will vanish from any of Moriarty’s remaining investment interests like morning dew.”
She smiles sourly. “You’ve gotten good at this. Yes, for all the world we’re a legitimate shipping operation, taking unremarkable cargo to unremarkable places at fair prices. We just offer more...personalised...service to a particularly discreet clientele on our way.”
Moran looked confused and angry. “Why is that funny, Mr. Holmes? I’m quite serious about my intentions for Dr. Watson, I hope you believe that.”
John helps Sherlock to get up and sit on the bed, and examines him once again. As much as he can, he keeps his fingers dancing over Sherlock's skin, telling him everything he’s doing and why, and Sherlock is grateful for the input, any input, any connection to the world and to John. John is quick with his cipher, surprisingly quick, the words pop up in Sherlock’s mind almost like a text. It helps to imagine them that way, on a screen in his brain, and pretend that they’re talking over text and everything is normal.
“Oh, the ink is the easy part,” Sherlock dismisses. “An experienced banker can tell, of course, but what tips off most people to fake bills is the way they feel. There’s no substitute for the paper. Once you have that, you can make all the money you want.”
"You've made sure of that, haven't you Dr. Watson?"
But John is already sprinting for the elevator.
“I do want that with you, Sherlock. I
“It was medical school. She’s married. And she’s the top rated neurosurgeon in London,” John says coolly. “Caroline says your brain scan is indistinguishable from that of a normally seeing person. There’s absolutely no detectable reason you should be blind right now.”
“No. No, I wasn’t. Later I was, but not then.”
John looks up at him, panting, already beginning to feel some effects. “Why not? If you can, I can!”
So this Sherlock Holmes’ idea of romance and relationships.  He esteems choice beyond love, loyalty above sentiment. Suddenly it clicks for John. Sherlock doesn’t like love because to him it means being controlled by another person or your own emotions, changing you who you are, the destruction of self. Maybe they are on the same page about this, just reading it in different languages.
His head pounds as he reaches for the limp wrist and finds nothing there, no pulse, no life. He allows himself to be pried off Sherlock. Even then he thinks maybe it isn’t true, even though he knows the feeling of that hand, that wrist, better than his own, has checked Sherlock's pulse there scores of times. But they turn him over, revealing the battered face, streaked with blood, grey eyes sightless and open. It is the eyes that convince John it is really over. He knows those eyes, has seen every possible mood shining in them, has seen them sharp and cold and angry and filled with desire and joyful, but he has never seen them empty, never seen them still.
As this sinks in John's vision blurs, and in an instant he's crossed the space between them and his hands are around her neck.
The flat fills with evidence and chemical tests, and the sitting room walls are covered in photographs and clippings, connected by strings, with illegible notes scribbled on them.
John releases him after a moment and looks down into his face fondly. “Nightmare. Absolute fucking nightmare.”
Sherlock yawns. “I’m not seeing a problem here, Mr. Bryant. You’ve come to me because life has been too quixotically kind to you?”
Sherlock recoils, retreating to the other side of the room and John finally steps inside and closes the door behind him.
“For me?”
Sherlock’s nod is deferential, and he gives John a faint smile that doesn’t touch his eyes but that he must at least be given credit for on the basis of his recognition that John may wish some reassurance at this time.
“It means something. Moriarty doesn’t say anything without a reason. But what does he mean by my heart?”
"Sherlock..." he manages, and Sherlock quivers at the hot, sweet breath on his skin. John shakes his head, like he can't say any more, and just leans down that extra inch and presses his lips to the side of Sherlock's face.
“John, I meant what I said. I truly believe that. But I wasn’t trying to say anything about… Don’t you understand what this is, it’s so much
,” Sherlock says, frustrated at his inability to communicate. “You’re mine and you shouldn’t be hurt. It’s not right. It’s cold and dark when you’re hurt. Like now.”
! Don’t go anywhere.”
“Come on,” coaxes John, still caressing his leg. “Sulking all day is only going to make you edgier, and neither of us has anything better to do but wait and get more and more wound up. Why not release a little tension instead? I’ll make it worth your time…”
John shakes his head. “No. I mean, it’s no burden. It…helps… that you care.”
He doesn’t know why he says it, they haven’t hidden it even if they don’t talk about it either. Maybe it’s because couple is not a word that he would ever use for what they have been, maybe it’s from an instinct to shield
She shudders, then levels a stare at him that puts ice in his heart. He’s been running on adrenaline for days, hasn’t really stopped to contemplate the results of his actions that he knew were coming. Couldn’t stop, not if he was going to make it out alive.  Keep John alive, and the others. But now it hits him at last what he’s done and it silences him.
John shakes his head violently. “I don’t buy it. There’s more, there has to be. What was that business with Sherlock then?”
She waves them toward the door with the gun. Sherlock makes the little motion with his head that John should be ready, something’s going to happen.
"You look tired. Why don't you try and get some rest? I'll see what I can find out from my old colleagues in petroleum-world, but it might take a few days."
John shakes his head. “If you must be a dark thing, be a dark nebula. They’re full of energy and they draw light to themselves but they don't destroy. They do really shine, but beyond the spectrum of the human eye.”
“She’s you? No she’s not!” John exclaims. “You couldn’t be more unlike. Well, except that you both are a bit heartless and possess a strange amorality that few people share.”
much about a very few things. Which is why it will hurt all the more when I take them from you.”
John’s heart skipped a beat. He ran upstairs, grabbed Sherlock's Browning from its hiding spot and his jacket, and, pausing only to send a short text, ran out the door and into the darkened streets of London.
The ringleader has turned now, cursing and reaching inside his jacket. Sherlock jumps and scrambles over the slick wall and tumbles down the other side just as his captor produces a pistol. He hits the stone hard, the drop being farther on that side than he had calculated, but forces himself up instantly and bolts into the shadows, hoping none of them is committed enough to follow him the same way, or at least that the wall and drop will give them pause.
John texts Sherlock that he’s secured the outside, but isn’t surprised not to receive any response. He climbs up onto the loading dock and positions himself just to the side of the door, waiting for it to open. Long minutes go by and just as he’s about to start to worry that something’s gone off, he hears a loud grinding noise and the massive metal door creaks open. He can hear about four people right inside, struggling with something heavy.
“You did take your sweet time, dickhead,” John snaps at him.
“It missed the artery, it’ll just be a nasty scar.”
Moriarty giggled. “You think I care about
“Right now?”
Sherlock nods. "But that doesn't mean it wasn't still true."
“John,” Sherlock says, not a question. Even in her anger at him, she’d wanted to spare him the knowledge of the full extremity of John’s grief.
Sherlock’s hands grip the back of the chair for stability and he begins to lean forward again, thinking only of the taste of John in his mouth, of the softness of lips and the roughness of stubble against his face, but John stops him with a hand on his chest.
“Can I stop you?” Sherlock replies, not opening his eyes.
“Not quite. About six years ago he was hauled in to jail for disorderly conduct and drug possession by a newly minted Detective Inspector.”
Nine days after the murder of the woman the Yard calls them out on another murder, in a completely different part of town. A man this time, stabbed violently in an alley near his home. John hopes this one will be solvable, and interesting enough to make Sherlock let the other case go.
"I didn't say that."
John shrugs. “It won’t be coming from you that way. I think I have some ideas on how to talk to him…”
“A bit on the nose there,” John said to himself. But why Hamlet? Sherlock had never expressed any special fondness of the play, of any play really. He didn’t seem to have much patience for them, in general. Why quote one now? And it was a tragedy. Was Sherlock alluding to a coming tragedy? His heart went cold. But then why employ a literary reference for it? It wasn’t his style.
“No,” John says. It’s all silence to him.
“I know, John,” Sherlock says finally. “I’m sorry. I’ll go. I think… I think it’s best if I go.” He turns slowly, but is stopped by a strong hand on his bicep.
“Mycroft feels guilty that he didn’t stand up to our parents for me. He thinks if he had, I wouldn’t be like this. He spent ten years throwing pretty boys of every shape, size, and nationality in my path, hoping one would stick. He was over the moon when you moved in. Absolved.”
The DI looks unconvinced about the serial killer theory, but agrees reluctantly.
"In the lab?" John curses, bounding up the stairs. "Sherlock, I told you to keep her away from--"
Sherlock shakes his head. “I’ve got a plane to catch.”
John cracked the door. Sherlock was sitting on his bed, facing away from the entrance, legs crossed beneath him and violin loosely in his hands. John slowly walked around the bed to face him, and knelt down in front of his friend, putting his hands on Sherlock’s knees.
John hides an indulgent smile and follows, pausing to tamp down the fire and collect several tea mugs and other bits of detritus that have collected over the course of the day.
“Glowing?” John is a bit taken aback, but then recalls the other times Sherlock has referenced something like that about him. He’d thought it was poetic license, although he probably should have known better given that this is Sherlock they are talking about. “You’ve said things like that before. Do you… really see that?”
John can’t help but be interested now.
They take a car to the Corinthia and Sherlock has the driver pull around back of the sprawling hotel so he can go in through the kitchens. He hands John an envelope.
The man’s eyes rolled up in head and he coughed, flecks of foam and blood splattering John’s jacket. “Jyivsinkää.” He managed. “Finland, far north, near Ivalo. There’s a big estate. Find him before he finds you.”
“No. We were poor, but
John swallows and takes a deep breath. Sherlock expects anger and disgust, but gets neither. “Did you just…?”
And he was very tired. It had been a long time since someone had made his tea, since he had slept in safety. It was a relief to let John fuss exasperatedly over him and tell him what to do. He slept 18 hours that first night, longer than he could ever remember sleeping in his life. When he woke he devoured the breakfast John had laid out for him without a word, except for remembering to thank John for once, took another shower, and collapsed back into his bed for another 14 hours.
“Got to think like one to catch one!” Sherlock tells him, not looking up from whatever file he’s poring over for the third time.
He feels Sherlock relax next to him, relieved to have somehow successfully negotiated this extremely thorny territory.
And, surprisingly, it’s soothing to be touched. He’s barely allowed anyone to touch him since the day Sherlock died, compassionate hands burning on his skin, kind embraces suffocating him. But Victor’s warmth next to him, his arms around him, the weight of his head on John’s shoulder – it doesn’t hurt. Maybe it’s because Victor needs him, isn't trying to fix him, maybe it’s because he knows Victor loved Sherlock too, or maybe he’s just been too long without sincere human contact.
John shook his head at the proffered chair. “Not yet,” he said grimly. “But I need some information on someone. It’s very important, and I can’t tell you why I need it.”
The company is large, with several floors of shiny, new offices attached to a massive complex of warehouses and factories. Bryant wasn’t kidding that it was a good job. It must be the largest paper manufacturer in London, perhaps in all of England  For all it’s size, though, it’s surprisingly deserted when John enters, well before noon. He realises belatedly that it’s a bank holiday – of course hardly anyone is working today.
myself, so I thought it would be fitting.”
Sherlock looks even more troubled at this development. He’s quite used to being the one at fault for relational misunderstanding. This is uncharted territory.
He hesitates before texting, but can’t think of a better option.
Sherlock snorted and leapt to his feet, pacing the kitchen with increasing speed. “We’re alive because he didn’t feel like dying that day, and found something better to do. He was in control the entire time. The only option for us was whether or not we wanted to take him with us when we died. He beat us, he beat
John gets up with bad grace, thwarted. “I can think of better uses for twenty minutes than lunch,” he points out.
With agonising difficulty, fighting himself every inch, he lets go, slowly forcing stiff fingers off her throat. He fumbles for his weapon, lest she decide this moment of weakness on his part is a chance to make her move. She doesn't try anything. He's genuinely hurt her; despite her attempt at coolness she's unable to hide her gasping for air and the bruises darkening on her pale skin. She looks deeply shaken for a moment, and then resumes her façade.
“Oh dear, how clumsy of me,
“I said no. Mycroft can deal with his guilt on his own. I don’t want to see him, I don’t want talk to him, I don’t want his help or his money or his empathy. Mycroft Holmes can go fuck himself.”
"You were always with me, John. I could always see you in my mind, like a lighthouse, even if it was far away. I never stopped talking to you and listening to you. While I was away I learned what it meant to be truly lonely for the first time, but you were always there and it was the only thing that saved me."
Mycroft seemed relieved. “Moran. Sebastian Moran. And the last intel I had on Sherlock was that he was in Croatia.”
, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says and she looks annoyed again.
"John," he says very quietly, "I think that–"
He pored over the images, and all the information in the reports, looking for anything that might suggest why Sherlock was after him in particular, and why that had led him to Croatia. He knew there had to be something, but he just couldn’t see it. Frustrated, he got out his laptop and started Googling random phrases and places from the file, along with “Moran”, “Moriarty”, “Croatia”, and “Sherlock Holmes”. Nothing useful.
The drugging, the locking John in the lab while he nearly lost his mind with fear to strange hallucinations, brought on partially by Sherlock himself – that John can get over more quickly. In fact, it nearly seems normal, although that is not going to stop John from giving Sherlock at least a little hell over it. He can’t be allowed to think that sort of behaviour is actually acceptable, even if John does ultimately tolerate it.
“You and Jim. I should have realised.” Sherlock smirked.
As soon as the waves of pleasure dim enough for John to see straight, he grabs for Sherlock, pulling him over him, kissing Sherlock deeply and tasting his own lingering flavour in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock allows him to remove the rest of his clothes, to wrap his hand around Sherlock, gloriously hard and smooth and already beginning to be slick. He permits John to stroke him while kissing his throat, devouring every bit of it he can reach. Sherlock lifts his head, exposing more of his tender skin, eyes closed, body purring under John’s touch.
Sherlock looks at John as if he’s just casually mentioned that he’s planning on starting a second career as a circus clown. “
Mycroft gives him a look of weary patience. “Sherlock didn’t tell me anything. Do I really need to explain to you how this works?”
Sherlock turns around, angry that John is making him do this. “Because,” he hisses, “people die in hospital. You could have died. I couldn’t… I couldn’t look at you there and think…” He can’t finish the sentence, can’t look at John, is livid that this admission has been drawn out of him. “Is that what you wanted to hear?” he spits.
When John reaches Sherlock’s room his friend is already settled. John slides under the covers and before he can even adjust his pillow, Sherlock has pulled him to him for a rough kiss and to roll John half on top of him, head resting next to head.
John knows why Sherlock needs this, but is still hesitant. "Sherlock, I've never used a straight razor before, much less on someone else. I might hurt you."
Sherlock proceeds to conduct roughly the same exchange five more times in various locations not too distant from their home. John doesn’t say a word the entire time. After the last one, Sherlock tells him, “That’s it. That’s everyone I’ve ever bought from.”
. We may have different styles, but in the end we are
“Any of the two hundred other people in this room, Sherlock,” John replies with a tolerant sigh. “Maybe I can find some old money of my own.”
dear Sherlock,” Moriarty breathed with an ecstatic smile. “You have already done it. You have given me….
“Re-enacted Romeo and Juliet, it would seem. Staged the kidnapping so their parents wouldn’t guess what they were doing. Clever. Yet so stupid.”
"Pull yourself together, Watson," he mutters, shaking it off. Letting a ballroom full of people who share some recessive genes make him feel inferior is just too much. He turns his soldier's eye to the room and scans it for signs of his target. She's easy enough to spot; a head taller than most of the other women and more than a few of the men, wearing a stunning cobalt gown which highlights a figure that can only be described as impressive. Her coppery hair is twisted into a high bun and then left to cascade halfway down her back.
Sherlock has never been this close to another person, never felt the warmth of another man against his skin like this, never smelled sweat and tears, never been aware of the blood coursing through another’s veins, pulsating against him insistent and irresistible. And he never dared to hope, even if he had allowed himself to think about such things, that it would be John, his brave John, his heart and his conscience, who would pressed against him, smelling of need and desire and fear and the incomprehensible pain crushing in on both of them.
“Jealousy is very unbecoming, John.”
“I assumed she knew I was joking,” Sherlock said, defensive.
But John holds on to him and instead of ridiculing him just beams. It gives Sherlock hope. He gives it another go.
Sherlock closes his eyes and draws up the image of their flat in his mind palace, as he had last seen it the morning they'd set out after the cat burglar. He waits until he has every detail in place, every discarded book and tea mug and coat on the coat rack and then very slowly opens his eyes, willing himself to see it, willing it to be there.
“Of course he is,” John mutters.
John doesn’t withdraw, but Sherlock can feel his fingers tense and knows he’s not entirely unaffected. He makes no comment about it, though, and chatters on about what they have to do now, going to hospital, more tests, as he helps Sherlock to the bathroom, to get cleaned up and to dress. Sherlock’s sense of balance is improving, but not enough to do so many complicated tasks by feel alone.
“Of course there is. Clearly we need some sort of system to help you understand which is which…”
He slowly moves until he is in front of John and drops to his knees before him, inches away. John watches him silently, taking him in without comment or expression. Unsure of why he's moved to do so, Sherlock reaches down and begins to unlace first one of John's shoes and then the other, pulling them off gently and setting them aside. He peels off John's socks one at a time and takes John's bare feet in hands almost as large as they are, cradling them reverently for a moment before replacing them on the floor and laying his head on John's knees in a posture of submission and grief, lost for a way to express his regret.
At last John nods, looking relieved. He puts a hand on Sherlock's forearm. "Okay."
Sherlock nods helplessly, knowing anything he says now will only make it worse. "Do you want me to leave?" he repeats.
“And there wasn’t heroin in the ones I did find!” John snapped.
“My ID card? And clothing, hairbrush… B-but why? I don’t understand.”
“Yes, you are,” she dismisses, and he doesn’t have in it him to argue. She acquiesces then and texts Sherlock.
NOT UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING. I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED BUT YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO HURT YOURSELF. YOU'RE ALREADY BLEEDING.
“Have you ever even done your taxes?”
She turns bright red. “Oh! No, I mean, I’m always glad to see you, just, you know, I thought, because he texted… anyway, I have the body ready for you.”
Sherlock is still, not moving or thinking, lest he think too much and discover she’s right.
“I’ll take that as acceptance,” he tells her, not bothering to hide his smugness. “And, I assure you, when you’re done helping me, you’ll be allowed to disappear and make your way however you can. Provided, of course, you continue to keep your mouth shut.”
“Like I said, smuggling.  Isn’t that a little mundane for you these days?”
“Damn!” Sherlock snaps. “Are you sure you didn’t use potassium bromide instead? Because that could—”
“Sherlock, there is a
?!’ ” Sherlock quotes in a passable imitation of her tone. They both roar with laughter, and the moment of strangeness has passed.
“No…miscalculated. Lack of sleep and low body weight…Will wear off.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “It was like this when I got here. It doesn’t make sense. Why break his pattern now? Why do it in the first place. There is no sense to it, no note explaining. Why bring her here? Why use his hands? Why kill himself with a gun before his pattern was complete? What was this all about? I can’t even ask him.
John’s eyes narrowed.
He's sure it's her immediately, though he asks a bystander just to be sure. She's standing by the refreshments table and, miraculously, not speaking to anyone at the moment. John approaches, pretending to be interested in the cheese board, and lets his instincts take over.
It is a pleasant spring evening. Sherlock is still flying from the Baskerville case, pleased with himself and with the world in general. There are several promising new requests in their queue to be sorted tomorrow, and John has made a superb roast chicken for tea and is now working on his write up about the “hound”. For a brief moment both men are reasonably content with themselves and their existence.
“He wasn’t unconscious,” Sherlock said darkly, putting down the violin. “I made sure of it. I wanted him to know what going to happen to him.”
He spends more time with Mycroft as well, his deep anger at his brother’s actions giving way to at least a semblance of understanding his choices now. Their relationship is no less acrimonious on the surface, but for Sherlock’s part there is less venom behind his sarcasm and he is less resistant to helping Mycroft, at least with those tasks he deems worthy and not mere political manipulations. He fears he is a poor substitute for their brilliant sister, if a less dangerous one.
stupid. I know what you were doing – is it really worth a life in prison to avenge all those inconsequential slights?”
Sherlock looks at him, at last, and the empty, appalled tone is heartwrenching. “John, I don’t know what came over me… I didn’t mean for it to go this far…I shouldn’t have… I should have controlled myself…I’ll go. I should go…”
John is not possessed of a weak stomach but lying so low to the water even the smallest waves seem immense and they are hitting them on a diagonal that makes him feel greener with every off-kilter roil. Justin is talking and he tries to focus.
John smiles, but does not immediately reach for his hand despite being sorely tempted. The idea is in Sherlock’s brain now, he’ll work around to the experimental phase in his own time. Instead, John changes the subject. “That place was ghastly. I mean I’m all for health food but fermented bean curd? Millet seed? I don’t think I’ll feel quite right again until I’ve had a had a gigantic steak.”
Sherlock’s journey to Belgium is cold, loud, and gives him lots of time to think. He supposes he’d better get used to traveling by cargo hold and other less comfortable means of transit.
John was rather pleased with himself for getting that far, but now he was stuck, standing in the square before the hulking building that contained the headquarters of the
Sherlock snorts. “So, the ketamine would have been just an added bonus, then?” he deadpans, and then they both crack up.
John sighs, worst of his rage spent. “You’re sorry, but you keep doing it because you don’t understand why you need to be sorry for it.”
Victor give him a tight-lipped half smile, getting up and heading for the door. He turns at the threshold. “John, I know as well as you what a futile gesture it is to say that if there’s anything I can do… I’m sure you’ve heard too much of that. But from the depths of my heart if there’s anything you need, ever, no matter what it is, please come to me. And if you need to get away from here, my home is large and I’ll see to it that you aren’t disturbed.”
Sherlock arched an eyebrow, conceding the point. “Well, then?”
He made his way carefully to Regent’s Park, disguising his path as well as he could, although he had to hurry – he did not want Molly to reach their meeting spot before he did, and it was starting to get dark.
“Take it as you like. And whether she wants to study medicine or chemistry or covert ops or...Tuvan throat singing, she should be all set,” Sherlock tells him.
“Well,” John says with transparently false cheer. “Neither did I. But it turns out I’m quite good at it. Who knew? That’s not a…
