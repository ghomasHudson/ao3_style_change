if you haven't read the newest ficlet, "Relapse."
“Do you want to tell me about it?” he asked after some time.
There was a gentle knock at the bathroom door, and Mycroft was grateful to find Greg with wipes, a new pull-up, one of the diapers Sherlock used when he was feeling extra little, and Willa the rabbit.  He’d also brought another new pair of footed pajamas, these ones navy blue and decorated with polar bears.
Mycroft shared a look of surprised amusement with Greg.  Making the boy clean up John’s urine was an interesting choice, but one that would have certainly instilled in the boy a sense of his own responsibility for the events of the afternoon.  Not to mention, it would have given Greg an easier excuse to get Sherlock to agree to a bath.  Mycroft hadn’t been giving Greg enough credit; the man had certainly held his own with Sherlock.
And then Papa was helping her put on the headband, sliding it onto her head until the horn rested just above her forehead.  Papa’s face broke out into a wide grin as he sat back to look down at Bunny, and she blushed through Daddy snapping a quick picture of her on his phone.  After putting his phone away, he leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek.  Bunny leapt towards him for a hug.
The good news was that, with Sherlock’s mind focused on weeding through the negativity, he would more than likely lack the energy needed to conjure up the energy it would take to lie to Mycroft about the accident.  Mycroft hoped that, if Sherlock weren't putting on a false front, he would be able to read his mental and emotional state accurately, and would be able to put together a gameplan for helping Sherlock through what he suspected might be a fairly tough day for the boy.  Although Sherlock was generally less susceptible to his anxiety when in littlespace, his bouts of depression came without provocation on a consistent basis.  Ageplay helped, but Mycroft knew even headspace could not guard fully against the chemical imbalances.   All Mycroft could do was monitor his brother and care for him as gently as possible.
“--We won’t,” John said, then turned his eyes down to the floor as he crossed into the kitchen to put on the tea kettle.  “Thanks, though.”
“It’s not, ah…,” John cleared his throat and ran a hand over the back of his neck, tilting his splotchy cheeks away from his grinning boyfriend.  “I don’t…”
“Then you’ll be a boy tomorrow,” Mycroft shrugged, smiling.  “You can be just want you’d like to be, honey bun.”
“Not off of the floor, kiddo,” he said.  “Let’s wait until we get home so we can get you a clean one of those, alright?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, stretching the vowels in a whine.  “I didn’t mean to hurt Bunny.”
Sherlock paused in his discussion of sound reverberation off of low cloud formations.
, he whispered when he regained a momentary control.  But, a second later, a jab of desperation hit him, and he folded over onto himself as he lost control.
“That’s my brave Bunny,” Mycroft said, smiling down at him with pride that made John feel braver than he had a moment ago.
“Eat a few bites, Bun,” Mycroft suggested to John even as he nodded at Sherlock’s prattling on about lakes and food chains.  He placed the baby fork into John’s hand.  But John just rubbed at his eyes and pushed the food around on his plate.
“I’m sorry, John,” he said, and John, realizing he was still pained by Sherlock’s action, nodded.
Sherlock took his dinosaur in his arms, his oldest and most trusted stuffed friend.  Mycroft told the boy to wait right where he was while he quickly returned to the master bedroom to find dry clothing, replacing his, which had grown wet from Sherlock’s trousers.  He pulled on whatever was at hand for the time being; once Greg was awake and able to watch the boys Mycroft planned to shower and get himself dressed for the day.
Sherlock whined in the back of his throat when Mycroft appeared beside him to wipe down his sticky face and hands with a wet cloth, pulling his face away from his brother while doing all he could to keep his gaze on the telly.  Mycroft chuckled softly as he persisted, and soon Sherlock gave in to his brother’s administrations with one final whine, just to get it over with.
Greg’s mom immediately reached to cup the back of John’s head before pulling it down onto her shoulder to swallow him in a hug.  John stiffened in the familiarity of it all, still rather overwhelmed by the day’s turn of events.
“Don’t lie to me, William Sherlock Scott.  Did you wet your pants?”
Mycroft moved to sit a bit closer to his brother, reaching out to hold his chin and turn his brother’s face towards him.
“But I wet Sherlock’s bed,” Bunny said into Mycroft’s chest, “and then I hadda ‘nother accident.”
John nodded, smiling broadly.
“Hold it,” Sherlock said, dismissing Bunny’s need.  “You don’t have time to go now.  We’re about to go to war.”
“I’m afraid we’re going to have to take a bit of a break from your pacifier, little Bunny,” Greg said, patting the boy on the cheek to signal that he could close his mouth.
“Verbal response, please,” Mycroft prompted, needing more information and time to properly read the man.
“Is it safe in the attic?” Mycroft asked, glancing skeptically across the table while the boys ate broccoli and macaroni and cheese.
“Okay, okay.  Quieter, please,” Mycroft said with a smile, not having the heart to speak sternly when his brother was the picture of carefree happiness.  “Give me that, little monkey.”
Mycroft was confused.
“That’s it. Good boy.”
Mycroft and John had discussed at length what to do about Sherlock’s nearly constant state of wet pants.  “He’s always had trouble keeping his pants dry,” Mycroft had said when they first talked.  “It was worse when he was a child, but that’s something that never quite changed throughout his life.  He’s humiliated by it, ashamed, even, and while I dislike that he feels that way, I believe he is fully aware that the humiliation keeps him young.  It distracts his mind from questioning and often settles him deeper into headspace.”
He glanced at Greg then leaned forward to press his hands flat against his desk.
“Yeah,” he said, nodding as he wiped at his eyes with the back of his wrist.
Greg wished they were closer, wished he could pull the kid into his lap.  As it was, all he could do was squeeze the boy’s knee in reassurance.
“They’re in the silly kitchen,” Bunny nearly shouted, excited by his own extension of the game.  “Making silly breakfast!”
“Just in case,” Greg said, glancing back and forth between the two men as he seemed to now be fully aware of the tension between them.
“About me?” Greg asked, glancing up in confusion.
John kicked the heavy pull-up off of his ankles and let it slip over his feet until it rested on the floor.  He could see where it was swollen and yellow from his accident.
The feeling was strange given that John had never woken up in headspace when he had gone to sleep as an adult.  The nightmare must have sunk him down.  He could still feel stabs of fear as flashes of warfare replayed in his mind.  He reached up to wipe the tears from his eyes and grasped blindly for his pacifier.
Thanks again for kudos/comments/reading!
SPOILER ALERT:  If you haven't watched S4:E3, The Final Problem, I would suggest watching before you read this chapter.  Generally, as a rule, I shy away from referencing specific plot points from the series unless they help us understand the characterization of these men (i.e. John's PTSD).  That said, I generally try to remain as canon as possible (apart from the ageplay and clearly-defined romantic relationships, that is).  In this case, as I began thinking through how Sherlock may deal with Bunny's shifting gender identity, it became clear that it would be necessary to cover this topic by introducing some of what we learn about Sherlock and Mycroft's past in TFP.  As soon as I decided to include references to this plot line, the stakes instantly became higher for all four men involved.
He would have preferred to call, but with his parents in the next room and a rather creaky set of old stairs separating him from relative privacy downstairs, he’d decided texting would have to do for the moment.
“I’m coming in, princess,” Mycroft said before pushing into the bathroom, glad that, in the boy’s haste, he had not had time to lock the door behind him.
“I can take you upstairs if you want to lay down for a nap, little princess,” Uncle Greg said, and, when Bunny glanced up, he could not help but notice the way his Daddy looked at Uncle Greg with hesitancy, maybe even anger.  If his Daddy wasn’t okay with Bunny being a princess, Bunny didn't want to be one.  He just wanted his Daddy to like him again, to stop looking at him as if he'd done something wrong.
“All set, good boy,” Greg said, laying Sherlock back down and settling the blankets beneath his chin.
In the front seats, Mycroft and Greg were involved in a conversation about the schedule for the next few days, and when John chanced a glance at Sherlock, worried his boyfriend may catch on to what he was planning to do, he found Sherlock still firmly aged down, happily absorbed in his video games and mumbling to himself as he played.
Greg sighed and closed his eyes.  He had been so close to getting back to sleep.  The voice was Bunny’s this time, coming through the opened door leading from one bedroom to the next.
“Okay,” Mycroft said.  “Can you tell me more?”
“It’s true,” Mycroft said, needing to reaffirm what he had come to truly believe to be a partnership in caring for Sherlock and John.  “I know I’m not always effusive with my appreciation, but I’m grateful for you, and for how well you parent our little misbehaving hooligans.”
Bunny reached out and placed a hand on Sherlock’s back, then traced his fingers along Sherlock’s bony spine in an attempt to soothe him.  He drew stars and thunderclouds with his finger along Sherlock’s back, relieved when Sherlock did not tell him off or pull farther away.
“You sound like a whale,” he said, teasing disguised as judgement in his voice.
“Oh, kiddo,” he sighed, exasperated but compassionate.  “It’s been a rough day, huh?”
He patted Bunny’s foot beneath the blankets as he walked around the bed and made his way into Sherlock’s room.
“Let’s not fuss about that right now, love,” Papa said, voice still gentle as he glanced at him with care.  “You have me worried, and I’d like to know you’re okay.”
Bunny became impatient, pulling on Greg’s shirt and telling him they had to get to the store before all the good things were bought up.  Uncle Greg chuckled and obeyed, taking off with a bit of a jump to make Bunny laugh.
“We need to have a chat, little one,” Daddy said as he stripped him of his soiled clothes and sopping pull-up.
He’d been up most of the night, sitting still in his office, contemplating their options.  Greg had, for the most part, left him to it, only checking in twice: once in an attempt to get him to eat more of the dinner he’d barely touched, and once, after he’d realized food was a lost cause, to pass along a glass of bourbon.
Sherlock sniffed and ducked his head once more, but he glanced up at Mycroft tentatively.
“Took you long enough,” Sherlock said.  “He’s in the bedroom.”
“He’ll realize what you’ve left out, eventually,” Greg said after sitting in silence while Mycroft relayed the events of that morning.
Sherlock was already dressed in pajamas, Mycroft having changed him into them when he’d brought the boy upstairs for a diaper change and what he’d later told Greg had been a quick rock in the rocking chair to settle him into headspace, but Greg knew Mycroft did not like the boys to skip cleaning their teeth.  He carried the boy into the upstairs bathroom and perched him on the top of the sink cabinet as he reached for the baby’s alligator toothbrush.
“You’ll stay with me?” Sherlock asked, needing to make sure he wasn't about to head back to Bunny's side.
“You’re doing just fine,” Mycroft said.  “You were upset that Bunny could be himself when you felt as if you could not.  Is that right?”
“Let’s talk once you’re cleaned up, little one,” Mycroft said.  “Have you finished your wee?”
His brother ignored him in favor of adjusting the faucet and scrubbing at a dirtied plate Sherlock knew to have been sitting at the bottom of the sink for over a week.  Mycroft had been cleaning ever since Greg had carried John out of the flat, organizing and tidying up while Sherlock stalked around the apartment, attempting to express his displeasure at Mycroft’s presence through huffs and glares.  Mycroft had paid him little mind, going about his tasks with little more than fleeting glances at Sherlock.
“Do you think it might be a good idea to try?” he asked, knowing that if the boy had an accident it would likely only lead to future tantrums.  “You can show Sherlock what a big boy you are.”
Mycroft pushed Greg against the mattress and, after stripping him of his t-shirt, straddled him and found his gasping mouth once more.
Greg sighed.  He hated seeing either one of his boys distressed, particularly when he was required to take away something that brought them comfort.
John send a muffled agreement through the doorway.
Still, he found he rather enjoyed the man’s company, and Greg was always extremely forgiving when it came to Mycroft’s rather long list of quirks.
“It’s okay, princess,” Greg said, wanting to reassure the boy.  “Just an accident.  That’s what your pull-ups are for”
Sherlock nodded, allowing himself to sink into the comfort of the blanket and his thumb and Mycroft’s care.  It had been a difficult few days, but he was headed back to London and to John and Papa.
It was a bit of a test.  Uncle Greg had said it was okay for Bunny to like mermaids and pinks and purples.  He’d even let him buy paper dolls and a floppy plush bunny and a pretty mermaid nightgown.  But his Daddy seemed hesitant, and Bunny was starting to doubt Uncle Greg’s earlier assurances.  Was Uncle Greg wrong?  Did his Daddy not think it was alright for Bunny to have those things?
Happy Valentine's Day, loves!  I hope you're all well and celebrating self-love first and foremost, today <3
Mycroft shook his head as they set up their chairs right where the grass of the yard met the sand of the shore.  The owners of the house had created a faux beach, laying sand over the dirt of the shoreline.  The boys had raced through the sand, and Sherlock was now up to his waist in the water, trying to coax a tentative John to come in past his ankles.
John Watson didn't understand.  He left behind his newspaper and crossed the room towards his best friend and boyfriend, the anger he had felt over Sherlock not contacting him for the past three days dissipating at the thought of Sherlock injured in some way.
The lines establishing the boundaries of their ageplay world had become, suddenly as squiggly and shadowed as the pictures in the coloring book he’d earlier been drawing in.  He was convinced he had, with one statement of rejection, blurred what they had come to understand and know.  He'd made everything ugly and formless, coloring widely outside of the lines.  This time, however, Bunny and Papa were not be giggling.
“Bunny hug,” he said, rubbing his nose against Sherlock’s neck until the detective broke down and smiled.
"One hour and eighteen minutes," Sherlock said, eyes downcast into his wet lap.
As if the universe were playing some cruel joke, the man currently on the floor of the cramped motel room bathroom had the same sharp, unshaven jawline as John's father, and the circles beneath the man’s eyes were the same deep, dark circles that were present on his father’s face whenever John found him passed out in corner booths or atop the synthetic fabric of motel room comforters.   The body before him had the additional marks of strangulation, and there was a yellow tinge to the man’s eyes when he examined them closely, but there was enough of a resemblance to set John on edge, thrown back into memories of his father’s violent forays into alcoholism.
“Nothing,” the boy said, prompting a hum of displeasure from Mycroft.
“That does sound unsettling,” Mycroft said.  “But you’re okay now, huh, bud?”
But the power he’d felt and the thrill he experienced as he gave into his vindictive streak were nothing but momentary flashes of adrenaline.  And, after it all, he was left not with superiority and revenge, but with a sobering guilt.  The teenage angst that had plagued him when he’d picked up a glass shard wavered into helplessness.  Blood stained his sleeve when he yanked it down to hide what he’d done, and all he could think about was how much trouble he was in.
He could not keep from studying his new sister, and if he’d been feeling older, he would have had multiple deductions to make about this new side of Bunny.  As it was, the only thought Sherlock could focus on was that maybe Bunny’s separate genders were a bit like Sherlock’s different ages, each having their own personality and characteristics.
They both knew it was a farce, that mistakes had already been made and feelings had already been hurt, but pretending they could rewind situations and try them out in a new way had just the right echo of experimental test groups, and Sherlock found himself glad for the do-over.
“Sherlock asked me to get young,” John said after a moment, eyes darting up to Mycroft and then down to the striped comforter.
“Okay,” he called, the word barely decipherable as he dissolved back into tears.
Once John had allowed himself to be led across the hall, back into the purple bedroom, he glanced around to see that Greg must have cleaned up this room as well.  The bed was made and John’s plush lion sat resting against the pillows.
The only warning is that this was written fairly quickly and hasn't been edited, and is probably a little shmaltzy.
When Bunny was finished, he sniffled, then glanced up when Greg turned back to him.  The boy was shame-faced but clearly content.
“Wasn’t scared,” he said, firmly settled into his most stubborn side of headspace.
“Instead of asking questions or telling someone you were feeling overwhelmed, you took out your frustration on others, and that’s never okay.”
Hi, lovies!  This week's been a bit stressful and unpredictable, so I've taken some comfort in writing.  That means more updates for all of you amazing readers which will hopefully make your weeks a bit better, too :)
Daddy caught his pacifier just before it tipped out of his mouth, then settled it back between the boy’s lips with a chuckle.
“Disappointed in yourself?” John looked up in a bit of shock, and Mycroft realized that John still found it surprising when Mycroft showed affection or care towards him.  "It wasn't your fault,” John said, and then stared down at the table.
If Mycroft hadn’t been attempting to show Sherlock he cared, Sherlock had no doubt he would have been punished for sticking his tongue out at his brother.  As it was, Mycroft had apparently decided to allow Sherlock the semblance of seclusion he received from hiding his face.  He said nothing until he had placed the  final bandaid.
“Sherlock, sit up for a moment, bud,” Mycroft said as he settled Sherlock onto the bed and unwrapped him from his blanket cocoon.  “I have some new jammies for you.”
The man did not answer, but Greg heard movement in the room, and when he tried to open the doorway it opened only half an inch before coming up against what Greg assumed was the oak dresser.  Sherlock must have maneuvered the dresser to serve as a barricade against anyone attempting to open the door.
“And the little pirate?” Papa asked.
“Where’s Mycroft, sweetheart?” Papa was asking
“Sherlock,” Bunny pleaded.  He was going to wet his pants if Sherlock didn't let him go soon.
, Greg texted.
John turned to the bed and began stripping it of the soiled linens.  He threw the pillows to the ground to keep them from getting wet, then began balling up the wet sheets, from time to time running a hand along his inner thigh where the dried urine had begun to irritate and itch.  He should probably change out of his soaking wet briefs and find a shower.
Greg, who had been gathering vegetables to cut up for a salad, paused and glanced up at Mycroft.
Bunny turned on his side to snuggle closer to Sherlock as his Daddy pulled the door halfway closed.
“Please don’t tell Mycroft,” Sherlock said again.  “Or John.”
Pulling John into the game had obviously been a calculated move on Sherlock’s part, one that Mycroft questioned John’s awareness of.  The act had the two-fold effect of making things more difficult for Mycroft while also blemishing John’s do-gooder reputation as Sherlock spurred him on towards mischief.  And if John were feeling guilty enough to attempt to force himself into headspace just for Sherlock’s sake, the man could use all the help he could get to keep from losing himself in the need to please Sherlock.
Mycroft remained finely attuned to Sherlock’s state of mind.  There was a careful art to knowing how much the boy needed.  Mycroft had become skilled at understanding the tells Sherlock had to show he’d had enough, and, today, it was a gasping sob that came after a long, drawn-out pattern of intense hits.
Bunny could hear Mycroft answer after only two rings, and he made a high-pitched noise in the back of his throat.  Just knowing his Daddy was on the other end of the line made him more desperate to talk to him, to see him.
“Because, Daddy, they’re pink!” he said, looking happier than Mycroft had seen him look all day.
“Don’t tell Mycroft?” Sherlock asked.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows at Sherlock, who seemed to know the look his brother gave him.  With wide eyes, Sherlcok whispered, “loo, please.”  Mycroft lifted Sherlock onto his hip once more and carried his brother to the bathroom off the kitchen.
“You’re okay, string bean,” Mycroft said.
Bunny was not ready to give in, and he did all he could to get out of timeout, wiggling away from Mycroft’s grasp and kicking out when he tried to block his escape from the corner.  Mycroft had no option but to put the kid over his knee and spank him through his nightshirt and training pants until Bunny became compliant and stayed in the corner, crying into his hands.
Mycroft turned to Sherlock expectantly when they were alone, and Sherlock, with an over-dramatic sigh, forced himself to eat.  He was relieved when Mycroft finally decreed he could be done and took away his half-empty plate.  Sherlock stayed seated at the table, running his fingers along the bevelled edge absent-mindedly.
He thought about telling Uncle Greg it hadn’t been an accident, that he'd only wet himself because he hadn't wanted to leave the bed without making things right with Sherlock.  But that wouldn't be the full truth, and, even if it was, he might get in trouble for peeing the bed on purpose.
The snow had started in full force by the time John’s cell rang with a call from Harry.
“Greg,” John said, turning to the man with a pointed glance that signalled he was in no mood for coddling.  “Just drive.”
He remembered coming to bed with Sherlock after taking a joint shower where the two men had spent more time with their hands over each other than they had getting clean.  John had never been much for shower sex, but the night before it had been the most convenient venue given the fact that they were both practically dripping with urine.  They’d fallen into bed not long after, Sherlock giving way to sleep very quickly after sex, John not far behind.
“Children act out for attention,” Mycroft mused.  “We’ll simply have to give them all the attention they require.”
“I’m busy,” Sherlock called, definitely as moody as a petulant teenager.
“‘M sorry,” the boy sniffled.
“Let me go,” Bunny said, distressed, trying to yank himself free from where he was tied to the column.
“It’s going to be fine,” Mycroft said, softening.  “I’ll be there with you the whole time.”
John glanced at Sherlock in the aftermath of their laughing fit, able to breathe for a moment, but when Sherlock looked at him with wide eyes and a goofy expression, his nostrils flared and he once again found himself succumbing to a deep, guttural laughter.  Sherlock was set off again as well, and when he laughed so hard that he snorted, John felt tears streaming down his face.  Sherlock noticed and joined him in silent, deep-bellied laughter.
“You should have thought of that before you acted out,” Mycroft said, slipping into the type of stock parenting phrase he generally attempted to avoid.  He was a bit off his game today.
“Papa is so,
“Don’t feel like a girl, either,” they said.
John shuffled to where Mycroft was sitting.  Mycroft’s arms were in use, so he hooked the leg of another kitchen chair with his foot and pulled it out from the table until it was positioned across from where he sat holding Sherlock.  Bunny scrubbed with his fists at red-rimmed eyes as he took a seat.  Mycroft hooked his feet on either side of the chair and pulled it and John closer to him, spreading his own legs so John was as close as possible.
“Mycroft will always be my older brother,” Sherlock said.  “That’s not something only reserved for headspace; our roles were set long ago.  A slight change in your dynamic with Mycroft is not going to derail an entire lifetime of our dysfunctional sibling relationship.”
“I’m not a baby, Papa,” Bunny said, insistent yet still in good spirits.  “I’m a big girl and Sherlock better like me or I’ll tell Daddy that Sherlock stole biscuits in the middle of the night last week.”
“All of that is to say,” he said, quieter and a bit adorably frustrated that he'd been stifled in the act of showing off,  “you don’t need to worry.  I’m not judging you.”
And then John was yanking Anderson out of the bathroom and shoving him up against the bedroom wall.
“Hey, grumpy,” Greg teased from his place in the doorway.  “Want to tell me what’s going on with you?”
He placed Sherlock’s pirate pacifier on the table next to the bed.  Sherlock had the impulse to whack it onto the ground, to begin screaming once more that he was a big boy who didn’t need pacifiers or naps or pull-ups or Mycroft, but he was too exhausted to put up a fight, and he knew the words would come out in shrieks that would just hurt his head more than it already did.
“Tell me a story, John,” Sherlock said after a moment, voice slurred around the pacifier, and John nodded and did not hesitate to get up out of bed and crawl in beside Sherlock, who shifted to the side and then lay against John, who was now fully adult despite his babyish pajamas and the pull-up he wore underneath.
“Okay, Daddy?” he asked, needing another assurance.
“I’m a big boy,” Sherlock whined.  “Don’t need a nap.”
Thanks for your patience, loves!
He could not hear any commotion downstairs, which he hoped meant that Greg had gotten Bunny back to sleep.  He couldn’t wait to get the boys back to his house, where they had their own connected rooms just down the hall from the master bedroom and Mycroft could watch over them both.  The quarters were too tight at Baker Street; there was not enough space for them to all be together at night, when the boys were most vulnerable to dark thoughts and nightmares.
“I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this, Sherlock,” he said, voice grim.  “There are secrets best left forgotten.”
Daddy came to realize that Bunny was in no state to care about getting cleaned up at the moment, could see that Bunny’s tears were about far more than a wet bed.
Mycroft reached to brush the curls from Sherlock’s sweaty forehead.
“‘Lock,” he said, tone expectant, still waiting for his brother to explain what had sent him scrambling up to his bed.
“Okay, don’t worry, ladybug,” he said, squeezing Bunny’s shoulders and smiling down at him for reassurance.  “We’ll get you all cleaned up.  Just an accident, love.”
“Exactly,” Sherlock said.  “I was a child, John.  It’s long past.”
John sighed, but nodded.  "Make sure he keeps those stitches dry," he said.
“Almost finished,” Sherlock said, on all fours scribbling a few more symbols onto the papers spread across the floor.  The map was color coded, contained an elaborate key Bunny could not understand, and took up six or eight pieces of paper that had been taped together, which must have been what had taken Sherlock so long when he’d gone downstairs.
“Go on,” he said.
He twisted about and whimpered, dropping the controller to press both hands hard and fast into his sopping crotch, grabbing himself in a last-ditch effort at control, level forgotten.  But it was too late.  Warmth began spreading down his thighs, and he could not make it stop.
Mycroft should have known the day held more obstacles to overcome.  He began untangling Bunny from the blankets, attempting to assess the damage.  The boy’s pull-up had obviously not been able to handle the volume of liquid, for the kid had also wet his pants and his bed.  There was wet patch on the sheets where he had been curled up, crying.  He was unconcerned about whether this had been an intentional wetting or, as Bunny said, an accident.  He assumed it was perhaps a bit of both, the boy not in a position to get himself to the bathroom and subconsciously desperate for the comfort he gained from wetting.
He knew what would happen if he told them he’d wet his pants.  Papa would rub his back, comforting even as his face took on a picture of disappointment.  He would tell Sherlock he was hurt he hadn’t felt comfortable telling the truth in the guest bedroom, but was proud of him for eventually speaking up.  Mycroft would shake his head and, expression hard as it always was when he was dealing with dishonesty, explain that Sherlock’s deception had earned him a spanking.  He would take away Sherlock’s video game privileges for a week, at least.
“I’ll be right back, peanut,” Greg said, hoisting himself from where he had been kneeling on the bathmat before gathering Sherlock’s soiled clothing as well as Dimitri the dinosaur from the tile floor.  “Wash up and we’ll get you back to bed, okay?”
He could not keep his mind off of Sherlock.  John did as Sherlock bid when they were on a case, helping the man as he chased after each lead or detail in turn.  The pace of the worst ones was unnerving, and John was always left feeling exhausted and overworked.  But if John felt overtired simply from doing Sherlock's legwork, he couldn’t imagine the toll the cases took on Sherlock, who pieced details and evidence together in a constant stream of grueling, never-ending analysis.
Mycroft moved to leave the room, but he paused, unable to ignore the way in which John blinked up at him with something not wholly adult as he passed the smaller man.
“Did I hear someone say he doesn’t want to play outside today?”
Sherlock nodded and shrugged, then turned to stare out the window.  It was becoming increasingly clear that he would not be able to get out of a spanking without another tantrum, and at the moment Sherlock felt too exhausted and too upset that he had already worried the Bunny to continue putting up much of a fight.
Sherlock liked the way the wet diaper hung heavy on his hips.  If he’d been wearing one of the boring bedwetter pull-ups, it would already have leaked onto the sheets.  But the diapers Mycroft made Sherlock wear when he was too young to use the potty could usually handle more than one wetting.  Checking once more that Papa was still asleep, Sherlock sat back on his heels and spread his legs, stifling a giggle at the prospect of purposely wetting himself.
"Okay, Sherlock," he said.  "I want you to step away from the wall so I can take off your coat."
Mycroft allowed the boy to slide from his knees, but he followed, crouching beside him on the floor to pull him into his arms.
“Nah, he definitely wasn't the problem.  It takes a pretty shitty home life to send a guy scrambling to a place like this,” Anderson said, laughing along with the bald man.
Sherlock scoffed, rolling away from John with a snort.
“I cried and complained and yelled at you and then I...I went to the loo in my pants like a baby and you had to clean me up.  I'm supposed to be a big boy and be brave like a Gryffindor.”
“Bunny, too?” Sherlock asked, body shifting behind Mycroft as he worked to assess the situation.
He had to move quickly.  He pulled a pair of grey joggers from the bottom drawer of his ocean creatures bureau, then moved to the top drawer in order to find dry underwear.  But he hesitated while reaching for a pair of dinosaur undies, eyes catching on the stack of pull-ups on the other side of the drawer.  No one would be able to tell if he put one on, and if he had an accident he could change himself and not be in danger of having to put a black mark on the stupid training chart.  He didn’t need a pull-up, but no one had to know.
“We, ah…” John stuttered.  “I told him you were worried after...worried about how to tell Sherlock I was a, a girl…”
Greg smiled at the boy and reached to cup his cheek.  He was proud of the strides John had made in expressing his desires and needs while in headspace.  Mycroft had not discussed with him John’s desire to potty train, perhaps just not having time given the fast-paced nature of their daily lives since returning from their lake house getaway and the drama over Redbeard, but he knew it was something they could easily accommodate.  He was certainly willing to do whatever it would take to keep the excited sparkle he could currently identify in his kid’s eye.
Mycroft could not help but feel defensive at the immediate reprimanded.  Yes, he should have done a better job of monitoring Sherlock that morning.  But he had been inundated with phone calls, had spent hours solving problems that would have taken others weeks to work their way through.  He was inclined to think he’d done rather well, all told.
Sherlock needed Papa--pragmatic, problem-solving Papa who would know what to do and the right things to say.
Bunny nodded emphatically, smiling up at his Daddy as he pulled a pair of ladybug underwear from the top drawer.  Bunny's eyes grew wide with appreciation.
“Papa!” she yelled, scrambling out from beneath the blankets to wrap the man in a hug.  “I missed you!”
“You have to promise to tell me when you have to go potty, okay?”
There had been a bit of hostility in Bunny’s countenance throughout the morning, from as early as his tantrum at the breakfast table.  Mycroft has never cared for John while he was sick, but if he was always so moody while ill, he hoped for his own sake that the boy’s cold would leave his system sooner rather than later.  At least Sherlock had allowed himself to age down; Mycroft wasn’t sure he’d be able to deal with the attitudes of both boys at once.
The new girlfriend sounded nervous, overwhelmed even.  And very young.  Since Clara, Harry had tended towards much younger women.
“Whoops,” Mycroft said.  “Seems like someone needs a quick bath before breakfast then, hm?”
“Papa, can I come, too?” Sherlock asked, still perched in the corner but craning his neck to look over his shoulder.  “I want to go to work with you, too.”
John attempted to steel his facial expressions against any visible signs of concern.  Here was his worry actualized: additional pieces of information Mycroft had likely hoped to keep concealed that may come to light in Sherlock's memory.
But that day had been busier than even the others before, and John had found himself in the backseat of Greg’s police cruiser late in the afternoon, tired and hungry and catching his breath after the pace Sherlock had made them keep all day.  He was grateful for the moment to gather his thoughts and process, but he was also immediately made aware of the weight in his bladder, and he could not help but bend forward at the waist, suddenly desperate.
“I don’t want you to be uncomfortable,” John said.
Mycroft looked confused.
In any case, constructive criticism is always welcome!
“Okay, sweetheart,” Mycroft said, vowing to keep an eye on John and Sherlock to assess whether or not they were coming down with something.  “Just close your eyes and try to sleep.  We’ll get you to bed, soon.”
Mycroft should have known.  Given Sherlock’s depressed state that morning and his insecurity over Mycroft’s caring for John the night before, self-harm was clearly a possibility.  The warning signs had been there.  Mycroft simply hadn’t paid them any mind.
Sherlock sighed, appearing to resign himself to the fact that John expected him to speak honestly.
“Have to get up,” he said, looking rather disappointed.  “Need the loo.”
The doorbell buzzed during the final song of the movie, and Greg gestured for Mycroft to stay put as he left the living room couch and went to collect the take-away.
John needed his Daddy.  But he hadn’t remembered to place his phone on the nightstand beside him in the chaos and excitement of the night before, and he worried that if he tried to move too much Sherlock would wake up and see what he had done, would be angry and exasperated.
“Of course not,” he said, but John’s eyebrow was raised, and the man was grinning.
Sherlock could feel his cheeks pinking.  But he smiled at Bunny around the pacifier as Mycroft chuckled, in awe of his little brother's capacity for kindness and sensitivity.
“Just be careful our little pirate doesn't get jealous,” he said as they pulled apart.
“To motels?” Greg clarified, prompting the boy to continue.
John emerged from the bedroom down the hall, dressed in jeans and a button-up, nodding that he was set to go.  Greg fought against the urge to ask if the man needed the loo before they left, willing himself out of caretaker mode.  The man wasn’t actually toilet training.  But John was quiet as they made their way to the car, bordering on distracted; Greg hoped he hadn’t made a mistake by allowing the man to tag along.
“And you would like to be allowed to?”
He heard Mycroft sigh, which made John worry that he would be angry.  But Mycroft’s voice was soothing when he next spoke.  “That’s okay, bunny.  Everyone has accidents from time to time.  Does Uncle Greg know so he can help you clean up?”
“Is the mattress protected?” he asked.  “I’d rather not risk waking him when he’s finally sleeping soundly.”
Sherlock’s half-lidded eyes slid open when he caught sight of the new shark pajamas Mycroft had placed beside him on the mattress, and he reached to pull them on with a grin.  He pulled out his pacifier, dropping it onto the bed beside him.
Bunny left his pacifier and his nightshirt behind in his bedroom and let Daddy carry him away from what he couldn’t have.
Sherlock ducked his head and, after a moment, held up a hand of five fingers.
John seemed unable to finish his thought, but Mycroft nodded as if he understood something Greg didn't.  The man was certainly better at reading John’s expressions and emotions than Greg was.
Mycroft had to concede that point.
“How’s your little troublemaker?” Greg asked, setting down two plates of roasted chicken and green beans at the kitchen table.  Greg had been trying to get Mycroft, who had survived for his years as a single man on takeaway and sandwiches, to eat a bit healthier.
Bunny nodded, glancing to his lap once more.
And when John, snuggled up with Sherlock, happened to relax enough to find himself giving back into his Bunny headspace, he didn’t fight the impulse, scurrying down under the covers when Sherlock suggested they hide out like the bandits in the story and adding on to Sherlock’s made-up stories with plotlines of her own.  The actual text of each storybook was left unread as they turned through page after page embellished by their own imaginations, snorting in laughter until Daddy and Papa found them, made them use the potty and wash their hands, and sat them all down for lunch as a family, the kids insisting that Willa the rabbit and Dimitri the dinosaur get plates of their own and already negotiating with Papa and Daddy over the number of bites of green beans they would have to eat in order for Papa to build them a blanket fort and Daddy to let them watch a movie.
“I’m doing alright,” John said, meeting Greg’s concerned gaze.  “Peace and quiet will be nice.”
His head pounded, and John was most certainly slipping into Bunny, who was rather afraid of small, dark spaces like the closet.  He could barely see five inches in front of him with the door closed, and he had to bite back a yelp when he moved his shoulder and felt something brush against him.  His adult mind knew it was simply a pair of trousers hanging from above, but his adult mind was not taking precedence at the moment, and Bunny felt helpless, cold and wet with an aching head as he worried about monsters waiting in the shadowns.  So he cried, sucking his thumb in an attempt to stifle the noise.
Mycroft nodded, eyebrows furrowed in concern.
“Go on,” Mycroft said, clearly taking in the information but primarily allowing John the space to process his own thoughts.
Bunny nodded.  He did know his Papa supported him, knew that his Papa was always looking out for the best.  But he couldn’t help but feel a pain at being taken away from his Daddy and his Sherlock.
Sherlock was tearful as he finished the apology, rubbing at his eyes as he waited for Bunny to say something.  Bunny stared at him, then took his pacifier out of his mouth and held it out towards Sherlock.
“Well, hello there,” Mycroft said as Greg stepped onto the porch.  He’d placed the shopping bags onto the kitchen table, and Mycroft could clearly see that he was aggravated and short-tempered.
The story of Sherlock’s childhood dog was weighing heavy on John’s mind as he contemplated the sense of loss and injustice which would have needed to be processed by Sherlock at such a young age.  But there was something more, something which didn't quite compute regarding Mycroft's story of the conniving neighbor girl.  He couldn't exactly place it, but it seemed Sherlock was caught between attempting to recall more details and attempting to distract himself from doing so.  If that was the case, Mycroft had not been entirely truthful that morning, and Sherlock knew it.
He traced the words ‘I’m sorry’ onto Sherlock’s back, just above his shoulder blade.
Sherlock shrugged, and somehow John knew the man was unable to respond to that comment.
Mycroft could see from Greg’s expression that the man was hesitant.  As far as Mycroft was concerned, there was no question that John’s behavior that day was cause for a spanking.   But it was no secret that neither John nor Greg was a fan of physical punishment.
He nodded his chin towards the windows of the second floor, which were dim; the living room lights were not lit.
“Papa, I have to go potty!” he said all at once, changing his mind and suddenly stuffing his hands into his crotch in an attempt to stop the flow.  “I’m gonna have an accident!”
“It’s not often you find parents like ours,” his brother said as he nodded in agreement, clapping Greg on the shoulder.  “I’m glad you’ve found a way to pass along a bit of that luck.”
Bunny rubbed at his eyes with the back of one hand as Mycroft tore the sides of the pull-up and removed the sodden diaper from the boy.  Bunny’s cheeks pinked, and his slid his thumb into his mouth.  Mycroft patted the boy on the hip, comforting him before standing to toss the pull-up into the trash.
“All set,” John said, forcing himself to tip his chin up in a show of mock-confidence.
Bunny cried harder, turning his face into his knees once more.
It was a surprise to find out from the staff that Mycroft was not at the office but had left for home some time earlier.  Greg found a new cab and gave him the address for Mycroft’s flat, picking up his mobile with the intent of calling, but ultimately deciding against it.  It was clear Mycroft had shut himself away; he didn’t want to give him an opportunity to deny his company even before he’d arrived.
He was unsure whether his head hurt because he was hungover or because he was getting a cold--there was a bit of congestion in his sinuses and a scratch in his throat--but, in either case, he wasn’t going to be able to fall back to sleep unless he decompressed a bit and found some asprin.  As he sat up to climb out of bed, however, he knew something else was off besides his headache.
“Tired, Papa,” Bunny said with a yawn, drawing Mycroft and Greg’s attention back to their youngest.  “Wanna go sleep.”
Mycroft’s gaze shifted when Sherlock entered the room.  He held up a hand to signal to Sherlock that he was to remain silent, his expression and body language all-business as he continued to speak demeaningly to whomever was on the other line.
Greg rooted around in the bedside table and was rewarded when he came up with a spare pacifier, which he held out on the flat of his palm towards Sherlock, whose thumb had made its way into his mouth.  The boy hesitated for only a moment before accepting it, and he pushed it into his mouth as Greg settled into bed between the boys, pulling the blankets up to Bunny’s chin and lifting an arm to wrap around Sherlock as the boy lay his head on his chest.
Greg winked at Mycroft as Sherlock began rattling off the phylum, order, and species of reindeer before delving into the cultural significance of reindeer as they pertained to Christmas and the complete improbability of a red-nosed glowing reindeer barring genetic modification.  Mycroft had long known that distracting Sherlock from the actual practice of eating was the surest way to get him to eat anything close to a decent amount, and he smiled to see that Greg had picked up on the practice.  All told, listening to his little brother ramble on about hoof patterns and gestation periods wasn’t a bad way to spend a meal, particularly given the prospect of being able to watch the kids open presents when they were done.
“Not just any female, John, but a female child.  A female child tied in some way to my own childhood.  He’s never before been wary or cautious about introducing a women into ageplay--my brother doesn’t keep much company with them, but there was one rather regrettable day at the office when I showed up young and rather prone to misbehavior.”
His brother obeyed, then moved back to his post by the doorway, watching out of the corner of his eye as Mycroft dried Bunny off and released the drain in the bathtub.
John quickly flipped over, stuffed lion beneath his arm.  He reached for the pacifier Mycroft had left on the night table and popped it into his mouth.  He didn't usually go to sleep with his pacifier, but tonight he thought it might help.
Luckily, Bunny accepted the pacifier Greg held up to his mouth, which quieted him despite the tears pulsing down the boy’s flushed cheeks.  He managed to lift Bunny out of the bed and stand him on his feet beside the dresser drawers, where the boy finished peeing his nightgown and then looked up at Greg, pleading with him to help.
Bunny’s wide smile, his effortless littleness and sheer excitement for what he thought was a success on Sherlock’s part, taunted Sherlock, for whom nothing at all felt effortless at the moment.
If he were honest with himself, John was feeling a bit on edge, caught between the clarity of his adult mind and the lingering vulnerability of the previous night, uneasiness keeping his younger headspace creeping into his thoughts.  It wasn't rare for thoughts of John's father to enter into his thoughts, but it was rare for them to affect John so keenly.  He'd spent a lifetime steeling himself against his father's influence; it was disconcerting to find himself strangely plagued by the man's gruffness once more.
“Let’s not disturb them if they’re asleep,” he said, and Greg stepped away from the door as Mycroft took out his key.
xoxoxo
Sherlock climbed over and jumped off the spare cot Uncle Greg had set up in Sherlock’s room in case John got scared and decided after all that he wanted to sleep with Sherlock.  He picked up a plastic dinosaur from where it had been left on the bedside table and made growling noises as he guided it to fly through the air.  John could see Uncle Greg look at his Daddy with raised eyebrows.
Greg had dropped Bunny off in the downstairs bathroom--the closest to the front door--and had then left to get wipes and clean clothes, telling the boy he’d be right back.  He pulled the doorway almost all the way closed after peeking in to make sure the boy had not heard Mycroft’s frustrated opinion.  Bunny did not need the fear of another spanking looming over him.  John had been quite clear when he first agreed to ageplay that he did not appreciate spankings, and although Greg relented from time to time when Mycroft felt it was the only option with the boy, it never sat right with him when Mycroft set about punishing their little Bunny in that way.
“No big deal, ‘Lock,” Mycroft said, kneeling down to Sherlock’s level.  The boy flicked his eyes up towards Mycroft for only a moment before looking away again.
“What do you have to say for yourself, Bun?” Mycroft asked.  Sherlock knew Mycroft’s disciplinarian voice would not go away until after apologies.
Sherlock found himself staring at the closed office door.
“Shut up,” John said, but a moment later he released himself from any embarrassment, and laughed.
He rocked the boy where they stood in the hall bathroom, holding him close against his chest.  It was a relief to have the kid in his arms.  Yes, it would be easier were the kid to have sunk down in age when they reached Mycroft’s--where he could rock Bunny in the big rocking chair in the kid’s room and let him take comfort in the familiar surroundings of his forest-themed bedroom, but even in the present circumstances, Greg would rather Bunny than a hurting, conflicted John.
Papa breathed a laugh at the state of Bunny’s t-shirt, then reached to wipe at the worst spots with a wet cloth.
“Listen to me, Lock,” he said, waiting until Sherlock turned his eyes away from Dimitri’s backplates and up to meet Mycroft’s gaze.  “That was a long time ago, far before I was ready to care for you properly.  We were both figuring it out as we went along, and I’m afraid I wasn’t the most patient teacher back then.”
“I couldn’t hold it,” Sherlock mumbled.
“Sherlock, are you sure--”
John Watson was currently huddled beneath the blanket on his bed, trying not to suck his thumb.  His thoughts continuously wandered to the stuffed rabbit and baby blanket tucked away in the closet, beside the suitcase he still hadn’t unpacked from his weekend away.  He turned over and stuck his hands beneath the pillow.  He didn’t need to go little, couldn’t slip down in age despite the nagging voice in the back of his mind begging him to do just that.
“Thank you,” he said.
And when Bunny finally looked up, tears in his eyes, Papa—thank god for Papa—was quickly circling around behind his brother, placing a hand on the taller man’s shoulder as he began climbing the steps.
“This is not up for debate, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, hand pressed firmly on Sherlock’s shoulder as he began guiding him inside.  He held out his other hand towards the Bunny, who latched onto it and used his other hand to rub tears from his dirty cheeks.
“Is it any wonder I’ve a tendency to act the child?” Sherlock asked when he and Mycroft stood in the hallway, just outside their bedroom doors.  “I’m surprised you’re not the one stuck in childhood.  You’ve been exposed to their coddling for longer than I have.”
“Why do you feel that way?” Mycroft repeated, voice a tad firmer.
Mycroft furrowed his brow, but nodded.
It was clear from the darkness behind his little brother’s eyes, the apathetic haze that generally came with Sherlock’s bouts of depression, not only that Sherlock had wet the bed unintentionally, but that he was currently struggling against the self-loathing and self-doubt usually brought on by his accidents, emotions which took residence in the corners of Sherlock’s worst days.
“Finish your breakfast and watch cartoons with your brother,” Greg said to Bunny as he placed a hand on Mycroft’s shoulder and addressed his boyfriend.  “Sit in here on the couch, love.  We can eat with the kids.”
Sherlock knuckled at an eye before putting his thumb back into his mouth.  He looked at Mycroft with a bit of defiance, a sign Mycroft had long since understood signalled his brother’s need for discipline and a bit of humiliation.  Sherlock wasn’t currently in a place to accept much coddling, but he could be comforted by Mycroft’s upholding of clear-cut rules they had settled on long ago.  He could allow himself to settle lower in age if he were a bit ashamed.  For Sherlock, firmness was its own breed of caretaking.
John paused.  Since when did the man use the word 'please'?
Mycroft cleared his throat.  He’d been hoping to make it through the night without having to come to terms with his own moodiness, but he’d known it was unlikely given the way Greg had been peppering him with concerned questions throughout the night.  He nodded to acknowledge Greg’s request.
John blinked awake, then rolled over to see by the owl clock on his nightstand that it was merely two hours since he’d been put to bed.  It was another moment before he realized he was aged up.  He could feel the sleepy haze of little space close by, felt that he may be able to catch it again if he shifted deep down beneath the blankets and focused on the smooth border of his baby blanket or took to sucking his thumb, but as he rooted around to find Willa, he heard the soft clicking of a keyboard from the other room.
“John, I can sense there’s more you’d like to talk about than whiskey barrels,” Sherlock said when their laughter settled into a tense silence once more.  “Shall we discuss this past weekend?”
“Okay, champ,” Papa said, guiding John towards the backseat before opening the door.  “Let’s get you into the car.”
Bunny was nowhere to be found when Mycroft returned to the living room.  But when Mycroft stepped around the edge of the room to check if the boy had wandered behind the couch, he stepped into a wet patch on the carpet, and sighed.  He had a sinking suspicion that he knew exactly what had happened.
“It wasn’t you, sweetheart,” he said with a soft laugh.  He reached a hand out and patted the boy on the cheek.  He really was adorable when he was like this.  “But we should get these sheets changed, so you’ve got to get up.  Why don’t you go brush your teeth and wash your face?”
It generally worked to appeal to Bunny’s sense of being grown-up and his sense of being a good brother to Sherlock, but Mycroft could see that today was not the ideal time for that tactic.  The boy became even more frustrated.  He glared at Mycroft and threw his sippy-cup to the ground.
Mycroft and Greg both stared at Sherlock, who was waiting for their answer to his question.
It's been far, far too long since I've updated, and it doesn't seem as if life is going to slow down for me anytime soon.  As a result, this chapter is much shorter than any of my previous ones--I know where I'm moving next, I just haven't had time to sit down and write!  I'm hoping the shorter length will allow me to post more frequently until I can get back on track to my usual length of chapters.
“No,” Greg said, suddenly raising his voice and standing up straighter.  “You can’t let that happen, Donovan.  It will compromise the case.  You need---”
“Yeah,” Sherlock said.  “Tell Bunny I didn’t really mean that, okay?  Mycroft says I make unfounded generalizations when faced with change.”
“I can give you fish or puppies,” Mycroft said, “We’re clean out of dinosaurs.”
Sherlock wasn’t used to discussing ageplay through text; he and John were less than communicative about the subject even in person, preferring to allow actions to speak for them or, when they were small, to wait for Mycroft or Greg to facilitate any conversations that needed to be had between their smaller selves.  Even on the rare occasions they were young without Mycroft or Greg, they rarely spoke about it afterwards.
That said, he could not help but feel relief through his embarrassment over Sherlock bringing up potty training.  If Mycroft had spoken to him about it, it meant he and Greg were ready to begin again.  John had been hesitant to reach out to them, even during nights he felt particularly vulnerable or could recognize the youthful glint around Sherlock’s tired eyes.  He’d felt a pit growing in his stomach for over a week, not knowing how to explain to the others that he felt himself coming unmoored without the solid surety of their care.
“Sorry I was bad, Papa,” the kid said, sniffling again.  “I’m sorry I wasn’t a big boy for you and Daddy.”
“You don’t care about me,” Sherlock spat.  “You’re mean.”
“What’s the plan, then?” Greg had asked, hoisting himself up to spoon another serving of rice onto his plate.  “We can’t very well keep Sherlock separate every time the little one’s feeling like a girl.”
Sherlock nodded quickly, grateful that Mycroft had put his difficult thoughts into words.
Greg needed sleep, himself--especially after the day he’d had--but he knew there was a conversation that needed to be had with his brother before he could settle down next to Bunny for rest.
“I think it would pull me out of headspace,” John said.  “It doesn’t do anything for me.”
, John texted back, ultimately wanting to assuage his sister’s guilt more than he wanted to delve into the overwhelming disappointment of the situation and its predecessors.
“I need you to take care of Bunny for me,” he said.  “He needs a new pull-up, which will embarrass him, but he’ll be okay.  You should be able to get him back to sleep for a few hours, which will--”
Sherlock sat up, a bit in shock.
John smirked and, sitting back down, tucked into the eggs.  He ignored the comfort Greg’s simple directions brought to him and the fear he’d felt at the prospect of Greg leaving, a fear that an adult Sherlock would have diagnosed as separation anxiety.  John was not a child at the moment; he would have been just as capable of staying behind as he was capable of accompanying Greg to a crime scene.
And then he was alone, collapsed on the bed and willing his heart rate to stop racing.  There was no telling how long he would be trapped with his own thoughts, no telling how long it might be before the room would be lightened by sunrise.  But at least he was behind closed doors; at least his weakness was hidden.
It seemed that the safest course of action was to hide, especially as he felt tears welling in his eyes and knew he was moments away from beginning to cry.  Slipping from beneath the sheets and blankets as carefully as possible so as not to disturb Sherlock, John scrambled into the closet near his side of the bed.  He huddled beneath Sherlock’s clothes hung above him, pulling his knees to his chest after he’d closed the door.  He couldn’t help but chew on the edge of his thumb, the darkness frightening as tears fell.
It was all too much.  Sherlock left his post against the dresser and paced the room.  He needed his mind to stop its furious whirling, to stop its self-deprecating commentary, its derogatory name calling.  He needed the headache to stop building, needed his desire for Mycroft and John to settle.
Sherlock moaned like a dying animal, and, when he nodded, John saw an even younger version of Sherlock emerge, big-eyed and innocent.  “I’m sorry,” he whined, sniffling and rubbing at his eyes with his fists.
“Is that why you hit Anderson, bud?  Because they were laughing?”
Sherlock knew he hadn’t stayed in the lines, that the outlines of the planets were barely perceptible beneath his doodling.  At another time, when he was feeling less content, the fact would have made him shy and embarrassed.  But Sherlock felt safe and Bunny seemed happy, and Sherlock knew he could show him the picture without fear of judgement.
He should get out of bed, update the blog, look for more leads.  He certainly shouldn’t be toying with the idea of curling up with a blanket and a sippy cup, and--what he desperately wanted more than anything--a pull-up to watch a Disney movie.
Greg almost regretted having to set some ground rules with Bunny.  A moment ago, the boy had been pure excitement and joy; as soon as Greg mentioned chatting, he’d glanced towards the ground and lost his previous sense of careless anticipation.
Mycroft seemed relieved.
“You aren’t?” he asked
Mycroft shushed Sherlock as his breath hitched on a sob.
Greg did not want to upset the boy, but he also knew there was no way he could allow the fighting to slide.  Even if Greg didn't enforce a punishment, Mycroft certainly would.
“I’ll do it,” Mycroft said.  Truth be told, the boys already looked at him as the disciplinarian, and, as long as John received a spanking, Mycroft didn’t think it quite mattered whether it came from himself or from Greg.
And then John’s head was against Sherlock’s chest, and John felt nothing but a tired, grateful exhaustion.  It was a comfort that Sherlock didn’t feel the need to discuss the multitude of shifting thoughts and emotions at that exact moment.  There were questions each man had, questions they could answer for each other and ones they could not, but, to John’s great relief, they were questions that could wait until morning.
“Yeah?”
“Aw, come on now,” Papa said, turning his attention from Bunny and reaching to tickle Sherlock’s stomach.  Despite Mycroft’s quick, searching glance, it seemed Papa hadn’t caught on to Sherlock’s deception.  “I know that tummy of yours has to be hungry.  You haven’t eaten all day.”
There was a part of John that felt he should change out of the childish pajamas he had been dressed in, bunny rabbits scattered over the cotton fabric.  But if he changed out of his pajamas it would only make sense that he would also change out of the pull-up Greg had dressed him in, and for some reason that John would need Mycroft to help process, he felt compelled to keep that on.

“Talk about a kid who could do with some age regression,” Mycroft said, returning to the cutting board.
John rutted upwards, desperate for the contact.  It was almost like shifting himself against the edge of his mattress or humping against one of his plush stuffed animals, activities John was suddenly worried Sherlock knew he sometimes partook in after waking up in a wet pull-up.  At the moment, however, he only cared that it was familiar and good, that Sherlock’s thigh rocking back and forth against him as he rutted against it was almost mind-numbing.
Bunny began to cry a bit as he pointed to his head and then his throat, and Greg could see that the boy was disconcerted from waking up in the middle of the night, that he was clearly feeling a bit nonverbal and more than a bit needy.

“Glad I came back to you?” Sherlock asked, unable to keep the smugness from his voice.
Papa was still far too concerned for Sherlock’s liking, not comfortable wielding dominating power in the way Mycroft was.  He needed Papa to speak with authority, like he had when Sherlock had hit and kicked.  But Papa only punished when it was earned, spoke with weight only when rules were broken or misbehaviors tallied; if Sherlock was going to elicit more discipline from Papa, his only choice was to get in more trouble.
“A bit not good?”
“I don't want to play, anymore,” Bunny said, his voice sounding far more panicked than he had intended.  He yanked at the rope around his wrists, and when he made no progress in getting himself free, he felt the tears welling up in his eyes.
Sure enough, Sherlock emerged from the bundle of blankets on the couch, clutching a comforter around his shoulders and his tattered dinosaur in his arms.  It certainly seemed as if the man had been asleep; his face was lined from the couch pillows and his hair was tousled.  It was the first time John realized Sherlock’s regression may help the man turn off his mind a bit.
“You don't have to," Sherlock said.  "Be a good boy and hold it."
Sherlock looked up at Mycroft in shock and anger.
Bunny, unable to speak, picked up a handful of the remains of his paper dolls and held them out to his Daddy and Papa, then collapsed onto the floor as the men came closer to him.  His face pressed into the carpet where the torn paper dolls were scattered.  He cried over the ruined paper dolls and because he wanted his Little Mermaid night shirt and his pacifier, but, more than anything, he cried because he knew it was Sherlock who had done this to his dolls, Sherlock who had wanted him to be sad.
“Whatever you say, little one,” Mycroft said as he guided Sherlock into the corner by a hand on the back of his neck.
“Tell me about the storm?”
“You worried me, kiddo,” he said, cheek angled against the top of Sherlock’s head.
“They might make fun of me,” he mumbled, as if embarrassed to say the words.  “They’ll think I’m bad, and they’ll forget about everything except that.”
“I want to see the rest of the movie,” Bunny said.  “I’m not wet, Daddy, I promise.”
“I suppose it was inevitable,” Sherlock said with a quirk at one corner of his lip, pulling his hand away from John’s as his tolerance for affection and touch was reached.  “Given your latent father issues.”
“Let him sleep, for now.  I wouldn’t be surprised if he had a rather trying evening.”
Mycroft and Greg shared a look.  It was obvious Sherlock had been having a hard time with the whole potty training endeavor, that however game for the exercise he’d been in theory, the actual practice had thrown him off course, particularly given the difficulty he’d had shifting down into the correct headspace that morning.  Mycroft wasn’t entirely surprised; after all, his brother had never had a very smooth relationship with his bladder, in childhood or adulthood, and it wasn’t something Sherlock ever talked about, if he could help it.  It wasn’t surprising that the boy was having difficulties, and it wasn't surprising that he would be sensitive to inquiries about needing the loo given his accident earlier in the day.
“Rest your eyes, princess,” Greg said after kicking snow from his shoes and climbing into the driver’s seat in front of him.
Mycroft reached to cup Sherlock’s cheek and swipe away a tear with the pad of his thumb.
“I’m sorry I didn’t protect you, John-John,” Sherlock mumbled.  “You’re not a baby.”
Papa seemed a bit taken aback by Sherlock’s sudden snarky attitude, and his gaze turned once more to Mycroft, who quirked an eyebrow and then, looking suddenly no-nonsense, opened his mouth to speak.
Sherlock whined and kicked at the center base of the table.
Sherlock nodded.  He wasn’t sure how Papa always seemed to know when Sherlock had had an accident.  He supposed he must have some sort of tell that he hadn’t bothered to self-identify just yet.  In any case, he was grateful that he didn’t have to explain it all to Papa on top of the cuts on his arm.
Papa made breakfast while Bunny tried not to fall asleep at the kitchen table.  He had not gotten much sleep the night before, and the medicine his Papa had given him made his mind fuzzy and his eyelids heavy.
“Papa choose,” Bunny said, leaning into Greg’s shoulder.
“I need you to give me Willa and blanket,” he said, holding out his hands for the comfort items.  “You are going to write this line 150 times.  You made some poor decisions today, kid, and you need to think about that for a while so we can make sure it doesn't happen again.”
“Fuck off, Mycroft,” he mumbled, voice deep and husky from sleep.  Sherlock was big, then, and judging from his behavior and the glass of water by the bedside next to the aspirin bottle, hung over.
“And then he aged down almost faster than I could get him away,” he said.
It was not only Sherlock and John who’d been busy and preoccupied since their last ageplay session; Greg hadn’t had a chance to spend more than the occasional morning or evening with Mycroft in the past weeks’ hustles of work commitments.  The men had, more often than not, been spending nights at their own apartments out of convenience and exhaustion, and Greg was looking forward to putting the kids to bed and having Mycroft all to himself in a few hours’ time.
He held the brand new pacifier to Sherlock’s lips, knowing the man needed the comfort, and was relieved when Sherlock accepted it without complaint and then wandered over to lean against his brother.
Sherlock pulled his arm behind him when he caught Papa’s glance.  But Papa was moistening a flannel in warm water, and gestured for Sherlock to hold out his arm, which he did after a bit of hesitation.  Papa held his wrist gently and dabbed at the shallow cuts to clean them up a bit.  Sherlock was grateful he didn’t say anything.
“He needs to learn,” Mycroft said, no-nonsense and certain.  “And it needs to come from you.”
Bunny sat up with wide eyes.  She could not help but bounce a bit where she sat, eager and excited for whatever Papa had brought, but she waited patiently as Papa retrieved a shopping bag from the floor at the end of the bed.
“You can slip down as young as you’d like, bud,” he’d said while carrying Sherlock downstairs.  “I’ll be here for you.  I’m not going anywhere and Bunny and Uncle Greg love you no matter what, okay?”
“We’ll be having a very long discussion later, young man,” Mycroft said to Sherlock.  “I’m very disappointed in you.”
“Well, our boys are all grown up, now, brother mine,” Mycroft drawled, eyebrow raised in cheekiness.  “Although the stories we tell about their antics do get some strange looks from the ladies at the bridge club.”
“Sorry, My,” he said, reaching to rub against the wetness on his trousers as if he could make it go away.
But it appeared Bunny did know, for he lifted his head from Uncle Greg’s shoulder and pulled out the pacifier he’d finally been allowed to have after a full day of trying to heal the sore on his tongue.
.  Sherlock thrashed about as his avatar slid down a waterfall and was swept downstream, forced to swim back and forth across a wild river in order to avoid rocks, sharks, and whirlpools.
Sherlock sniffled and blinked back a fresh onslaught of tears.  He was supposed to be older than Bunny, the one to set a good example for his little brother.  But right now the prospect of leading the charge in potty training seemed too large of an ordeal to handle.  Right now all Sherlock wanted to do was sit in Mycroft’s lap with Dimitri and his pacifier and not think about being responsible.
Bunny whined in the back of his throat as he reached towards his Papa for a hug.  Didn’t Papa understand that he didn’t want to take care of Sherlock, that he didn’t want to worry about being bigger today? That he was sick and felt icky and all befuddled?
Their little Bunny was hunched in the middle of the bathroom, tears streaming down his face.  His jeans were dark with wetness down both legs.  The boy held a hand to his crotch and turned away in an attempt to hide his accident, but there was no concealing what had happened.  He looked rather pitiful, soaked down to his socks and standing in a puddle of urine as he cried.
I'm excited to see where things move next.
“No arguments,” he said.  “For now, lunch is ready.  Head on downstairs before it gets cold, and Papa will clean up the spill on the carpet.”
“Wanted you,” Sherlock said at last, nuzzling his face into Mycroft’s thigh.  “Papa said you would be here in the morning, but you were with Bunny still.”
“Need dinosaur bandaids,” Sherlock said as soon as Mycroft was in earshot.  His voice was a high-pitched whine, reserved for Sherlock’s neediest moods and prompted by his inability to process the feelings which emerged as he found himself alone in Mycroft’s presence.
“I don't care! I want them!” John yelled, finally reaching his breaking point and beginning to cry.  He threw his breakfast fork across the room out of what Sherlock knew was, more than anything, frustration at not being able to explain what was really bothering him.  The fork hit against the wall and tumbled to the floor, bits of scrambled egg scattering across the carpet.
“Nothing that’s going to rile them up or give them nightmares,” Mycroft said with a quirked eyebrow, a hand absently running up and down Sherlock’s back as the boy tucked his face against Mycroft’s neck, sucking on the pacifier he had practically demanded as soon as Mycroft deemed he’d eaten enough for dinner.
John eventually groaned a bit and then began talking.  He knew he was not getting up from the table until Mycroft was satisfied that he'd told all.
No warnings in this chapter except for some mentions of hungover John being nauseous if you're feeling squeamish.  We're not back to ageplay just yet--the boys have a bit to work through before they can allow themselves to slip back down into headspace, but hopefully they'll be on the way back to young after the next chapter.
The pain in his hand had only calmed the burn of anger marginally.  He needed something else to distract him.  He needed to forget, to blur the sharp lines of self-loathing.  Because what hurt more than anything else, more than the constant voice in his mind telling him that Mycroft would rather have John than Sherlock as a little and that John would rather have Mycroft than Sherlock as a caring boyfriend, was that he had brought this onto himself.
But the wind was howling outside his window, and the rain was starting to fall, and Sherlock didn't feel very big at the moment.
“Did Sherlock call you?” he asked.  “I’m going to kill him.”
Sherlock looked as if he were about to argue for only a moment before turning on his heels to trudge up the stairs, through the kitchen, and into his bedroom, Mycroft following close behind to supervise.
Mycroft had taken a seat on the end of the bed.  John shifted up until he was seated with his back against the headboard.  It was clear Mycroft was waiting for John to initiate conversation, clear he thought it best if the man formulate his own reasons for being adult again rather than have any of Mycroft’s assumptions imposed upon him.
Wishing you all well!
“Come on, grumpy boy,” Papa said with the breath of a laugh, ignoring Sherlock’s fib and pushing up onto his elbows as he reached to gently tickle Sherlock’s sides.  “Let’s get you to the loo.”
Mycroft made a quick trip to the boot of the car, returning with a blanket which he wrapped Sherlock in before buckling the boy in the back seat.  Sherlock enjoyed the feeling of being wrapped tight and warm, only wiggling his arms a bit in order to get to his thumb, which he placed into his mouth before leaning up against the door of the car.
He was grateful that Mycroft had brought him to the bathroom quickly; if he'd been made to stand in the corner for a full timeout he would have certainly wet himself.  As it was, he was having trouble gaining control of himself now.  The intense urge had passed, but his fingers were fumbling as he stood upright and began attempting to unknot the drawstring of his joggers, thighs scissoring back and forth in his desperate need.
“His...his daddy?” He asked, sitting stiff and still.
“Warm enough?” Daddy asked, and Bunny nodded.
“Someone wanted to make sure you were okay,” Greg said, stepping into the bathroom and holding out the boy’s stuffed toy.
Sherlock yawned and turned to snuggle into the pillow on his side of the bed.
Sherlock chose to ignore his older brother’s warning tone and instead began combing through the mud with his fingertips.  If he couldn’t find frogs at least he might be able to find interesting insect species.
This chapter is dedicated to Hermione_Snape1894, who asked for a bit of encouragement to get through finals and a cold.  I'm so sorry I wasn't able to follow-through until more than 20 days later, HermioneSnape, but I hope this chapter will still give you some comfort now <3
John pulled Sherlock into a kiss, which the man luckily reciprocated.
“I’m fine,” John said before Greg could begin prying.  “Let’s go.”
“Goodbye, my little princess lady bug,” he whispered.
“John,” Sherlock called.
Mycroft never thought he’d have himself a daughter, but now that she was snuggled safe in his arms, he couldn’t wait to get to know her.
"Spot will watch over you in case you need some company," she said, nodding to the plush dog with a warm smile as she crossed the room to turn out the overhead light.  "And I’ll send Greg up to check on you in a little while.”
Bunny nodded and let his head rest against Greg’s shoulder.
Greg blinked at his mother, confused.  She was speaking about John the way Greg and Mycroft spoke about Bunny, referring to him as if he were fragile and in need of looking after.  She was speaking as if John had been on the edge of some kind of toddler-like, overtired meltdown.  A not-so-strange opinion in his everyday life, but certainly not one he was used to others sharing.
It was perhaps for the very reason that John rarely thought of his father that the recent persistence of the man’s memory was unsettling him.  Mycroft had said it before: ageplay had the potential to bring back memories you’d rather forget.  But John’s memories of his father had come while John was adult, and were persisting in his aged up mindset, calling back memories of his father’s diffidence and brusqueness, his expectations and often gruff treatment.  He was suddenly ashamed to think of what his father would think should he find out his son was ageplaying, the man's reach extending far beyond the physical role he'd played in John's life.
Sherlock’s head was against Mycroft’s shoulder and he did not protest when Mycroft slipped a pacifier between his lips.
“Hi, lad,” he smiled.
The boy whined against the cold until Greg wrapped him up in a large towel, running his hands up and down the boy’s arms to warm him up.  Sherlock leaned his head against Greg’s chest, closing his eyes once more.  He blinked awake with a fresh wave of coughing, eyebrows furrowed and voice whiny when he next spoke.
There had been a moment early that morning, just after his conversation with Sherlock in the kitchen, when he had contemplated staying adult in order to help care for what was likely to be a difficult little Sherlock.  His first instinct had been to go to Mycroft and Greg aged up, to discuss next best steps, and to formulate a plan for best supporting his troubled boyfriend.
“Three.”
“Can I wear my new mermaid nightgown to take a nap, Daddy?” Bunny asked.
Sherlock nodded and sat up to hug Mycroft around the waist.  Sherlock was generally only clingy when he was tired.  Mycroft sat down on the edge of his brother’s bed.
He began rather gently, easing the kid into the punishment with periodic hits to each side of his bare bum, enough to begin to settle Sherlock’s racing mind before increasing the intensity of the spanking.  Soon, Sherlock was whimpering, writhing on Mycroft’s lap with each hit.
But Sherlock was not about to let John get away without pissing into his jeans, and as much as John tried to make himself immune, Sherlock had him in too vulnerable a position to escape.
“I missed you, too, Bun,” Mycroft said, leaning down to kiss the boy on the forehead.
Mycroft hummed in a way that betrayed his displeasure but led John from the loo and down the hallway to the sparse guest bedroom.  John stood with a hand on the doorknob while Mycroft entered the room and turned down the bed.
His voice was warm, and for a moment Sherlock contemplated opening the door.  Because even after everything he had learned about John and Mycroft’s betrayal, in the absence of drugs or self-harm, he still longed for the men.  He longed for John’s good-natured teasing and optimistic buffoonery.  He longed for Mycroft’s pragmatic gameplans and the moments when he finally relaxed and let his uptight mannerisms fall away.  He longed for their looking after and their ability to calm his mind.
“Daddy said I could always wear pull-ups,” the boy said.  “At the lake house.  He said I could be potty training.”
And now Greg had gone and told a weepy and vulnerable little Sherlock that his brother and John had entered into a new breed of relationship than that which he had learned--at times, not easily--to come to terms with.  Greg was gutted; he had been able to read the pain on Sherlock’s face after the words had been spoken, had been able to see just how much the news had affected him.  Sherlock was skilled at hiding his emotions in all of his headspaces, but he had not been able to hide the betrayal he had felt in the moment, the betrayal Greg had no doubt the lad was still feeling.  The news had clearly shaken Sherlock to the core, and that was Greg’s fault.
John shrugged but allowed Mycroft to help him off of the rug.  They both stared down at the wet circle of urine on the rug, and Mycroft asked John to get some paper towels while he found the carpet cleaner under the kitchen sink.
But before he’d had a moment to process, a new problem presented itself.  In such close proximity to Bunny, Mycroft could smell urine.  A quick glance down to Bunny’s lap told him all he needed to know; given the fairly form-fitting nature of footed pajamas and the way Bunny was sitting with his legs tucked up under him, the bulk of a wet pull-up wasn’t hard to spot.
He placed the dinosaur on the kitchen table.  Sherlock whined, but stopped after a look from Mycroft, who was clearly a stern yet warm caretaker.
As Daddy turned the telly back on, Bunny traced the outline of Ariel on his Little Mermaid nightshirt and ducked beneath the blanket settled over him to check on his ladybug underwear.  They made him feel safe.  He leaned his head against Daddy’s arm and closed his eyes, making up stories in his mind about the ponies he had seen on the telly, with lots of glitter and rainbows and ribbons.
Sherlock sat up a bit and breathed a bit of a laugh, choosing to give in to Uncle Greg's teasing because he was feeling his first glint of hope that the day might not be all horrible.
Bunny glanced up and immediately scrambled close to Mycroft, arms reaching out around his neck as his tears resumed.  Mycroft took him into his arms, rocking back and forth as he ran his fingers between his shoulderblades.
“That’s right,” he said, smiling, and Sherlock let the littler side of himself accept the pride in Mycroft’s voice as the bigger side forced him to squirm.
“Get some rest, buddy,” Greg said, seeming to realize he would not be able to repair the damage he had done with any well-meaning explanations.  “Things will be better in the morning.”
It was also unlikely Sherlock had any known drug den contacts this far out of London, but Greg had learned not to put anything past Sherlock.  He was exceedingly grateful for the no technology rule over the weekend; he had no doubt that Sherlock, had he been given access to his mobile, would have found what he was looking for in mere moments.
“Ignore the family photos,” Greg said in mock-horror when he caught John studying them.  “My mother never met a picture she could bear to put away.  We’re drowning in them at this point.”
“I’m not!” Bunny cried, but even as he said it he could feel the pull-up getting wetter, could feel his body letting go.
“Just spilled my juice,” Sherlock mumbled, face pressed against Papa’s chest.
It was because of Sherlock’s snarkiness that Mycroft ignored his better judgement and drove beyond the service station.  If Sherlock wasn’t going to own up to needing a wee, Mycroft was certainly not going to force him.  He wasn’t Sherlock’s caretaker at the moment, as Sherlock was so pointedly making clear.
Bunny mumbled something that sounded a bit like
“You feel excited by wetting yourself,” he stated.  “Which in turn makes you feel guilt because age play has generally been a non-sexual activity.”
As much as this was making sense to John, there was an awkwardness to talking with Mycroft about his and Sherlock’s private life.
Luckily, Sherlock did not argue, yawning once more and nodding as he reached absent-mindedly to fiddle with Greg’s shirt collar.  Greg smirked at Mycroft before carrying his boyfriend’s little brother out of the bathroom, leaving Mycroft alone with John.
He had waited too long, and even as he clumsily tried to get to his feet to make a dash for the loo, it became clear that there was nothing he could do to stop the fast stream of pee pooling in his hands and soaking down his thighs and the seams of his jeans.  A puddle formed beneath him on the plush carpet when his jeans could hold no more liquid, and his socks became soggy.  By the time he’d regained control of what little was left in his bladder, he was well and truly soaked, and, with a stifled sob, he removed his hands, collapsed back onto the carpet with a choked sob, and finished peeing himself.  His eyes were glassy with tears, but he tilted his gaze down to watch the liquid trickle from the seam of his soaked jeans onto the yellowing puddle on the cream-colored carpet.
“That’s alright,” John said.  “I won’t mind.”
John spoke quietly.  “They’re not my rules.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes but bent to pepper kisses along John’s collarbone.
“I know you look back with fondness,” Mycroft said, again deducing Sherlock’s thoughts without the boy needing to voice them.  “But I was little more than a child myself back then, and mistakes were certainly made.  You should never have been made to feel that you were wrong for having accidents, string bean.  You were just a little boy, and little boys have accidents.  Do you understand?”
But he made no attempt to move, and Sherlock rested his head against John’s chest, tilting his gaze towards the doctor.
Bunny glanced at the floor, pulling at the hem of his shirt to cover the fact that he was standing half-naked after his little accident.
The boy’s crying stopped for a moment.
“Let’s get that diaper off of you, then.  It’s been on for far too long as it is, and we don’t want you to get a rash.”
He wasn’t exactly proud of it, but it had taken only minutes before he had been compelled to go through the room in search of something he could use to harm himself.  Given that there was no possibility for drugs of any kind--Mycroft and Greg had both searched his bags before leaving Baker Street--it was his next-step coping mechanism.  But he had known he wouldn’t find anything sharper than the plastic corner of a lego even before he had started looking.  His brother and Lestrade had ensured the room was free of anything dangerous.  The fact that they cared for his well being should have comforted him; instead, it sparked anger and irritation.  What right did they have to stifle him and his needs, to censor him?
“Sherlock, Mycroft cares for you very much.”
“I know, sweetheart,” Mycroft said rocking the boy in his arms.  “It’s okay, Daddy’s not mad.”
“I’m not doubting John’s motives, Greg,” Mycroft said, attempting to keep the sarcasm from his voice because he knew Greg disliked the tones he often took.  “I’m just wondering if John may have more than just caretaking on his mind.”
“You’re looking better than you were when I last saw you.  How are you feeling?”
Greg leaned across the table a bit closer to Mycroft.
What was worse, the noise from the interaction must have woken Mycroft and John, for they were soon beside Greg in the hallway, John--wide-eyed with a nervous energy most likely brought on by an abrupt wake-up and memories of Sherlock’s monster stories--on Mycroft’s hip.
Greg took in the boy’s distressed state with a bit of confusion.  The boy clearly had to wee--a hand had once more found its way to hold between his legs, and Bunny had never shown any of Sherlock’s aversion to public restrooms, having used them often and without any trouble in the past.  Did the boy want to wet himself?  Mycroft had told Greg about a time or two when the boy had asked to wee in his pull-up, but John was in pants and trousers and in the back seat of a car.  Not to mention they did not have a change of clothes.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft called, pulling Sherlock from his thoughts.  “Finished?”
As he felt the last trickles of wee leak from the diaper to add to the growing wet patch on his pajama pants and darken the sheets beneath him, Sherlock saw movement in the corner of his eye.  Shifting his focus, he whimpered at the sudden presence of Mycroft in the doorway, desperate for the man's control.  Thankfully, his brother understood everything after one pleading look.  Somehow, he knew exactly what Sherlock needed.
“I...today, when I...had an accident.  I…”
“It leaked, princess,” Greg said by way of explanation, lifting the soiled nightgown up and over Bunny’s head and leaving the boy in nothing but a saturated, sagging pull-up.
“Only want you, Uncle Greg,” he said, eyes locked with his brother’s.  “You’re better.”
“Gryffindor undies got dirty,” he said, crying through his concerns.
--was nonverbal and clingy and acting the toddler.  John was not about to put Greg through that.  No matter how much his worry about Harry had him feeling sick to his stomach, no matter how much he needed someone to calm the self-deprecating comments with cuddles and bedtime stories, no matter how much his heart leaped when Greg called him ‘kiddo,’ the Detective Inspector deserved a celebratory Christmas Eve with his family.  John was not about to take that away from him; not if he could help it.
making you nauseous?” Sherlock teased.
He suddenly had the urge to dig through his suitcase to find his plush rabbit stuffed at the bottom of his suitcase.  Willa was pressed deep down beneath his clothes, because, okay, maybe Sherlock hadn’t been the only one feeling less than adult when they’d packed the night before.  John had been trying to hide it, but it had only been the imagined instructions of Greg and Mycroft--
Mycroft’s hand was again on his back, stroking up and down as he clicked his tongue.
“Yes, Papa,” he said, picking up the pencil.
“I don’t,” Mycroft said, taking a seat next to Greg.  “He may have been contemplating which age to be this morning, but as soon as the prospect of swimming came into play, there’s no question that Sherlock would choose an age that gave him a bit of independence.  If he were younger, he’d need supervision and coddling that would take away from his desire to swim and play.”
“You’re due for a timeout for locking the guest room door,” Papa reminded him.  Then, when Sherlock remained silent, in his gentlest voice: “When’s the last time you had a wee, bud?”
“Good boy,” Daddy said as John’s heartbeat began to calm.  “Very good.”
John nodded and chewed on the end of his thumb.
He sighed, knuckling his tired eyes and resting his head on crossed arms on the kitchen table while he listened to Papa hum along to the radio.  He didn't know how to put it all into words; he didn't know how to talk to his Papa or his Daddy.
Papa and then open colorful presents in sparkly giftwrap.  He just wanted Willa the rabbit and a pacifier and maybe a present of his own to open; he just wanted to be small.
Sherlock stood in front of the sink on a stepstool that had been in the lake house bathroom.  It was painted in bright primary colors, obviously for a child, and, given Sherlock’s height, he certainly didn’t need it in order to see the mirror, but John understood why he would want to use it.  It seemed they were both feeling particularly young that night.
“Sherlock,” John said for the second time in as many minutes, interrupting Sherlock’s discussion of whiskey barrels.
You're all so wonderfully sweet with your comments.  I was nervous about exploring John's feminine side in the last chapter, as I know it can be a bit of a polarizing topic, but I'm truly blessed with open-minded and accepting readers, so I don't know what I was worried about!  Thank you all for being such non-judgmental humans.  The world needs more people like you!
John did not dare to leave his side, at least not until Mycroft and Greg had arrived.  He poured another cup of tea while he sat with the consulting detective and tried to quell his unsettled stomach and pounding head.  He watched the brilliant mind at work, and hoped he hadn’t made a mistake.  He'd provided Sherlock with the potential clues needed to recall what he knew from Mycroft's nervous state to be a painful, destructive memory; there was the possibility that Sherlock would be changed, that their ageplay world would be altered.  The pit in John's stomach grew, and he sat, body tense, willing Mycroft and Greg to arrive quickly.
“Sherlock?” Bunny whispered after a moment, removing the pacifier he had been worrying between his lips.
“I don’t want to wear diapers,” he whined, voice loud as he cried.  “I’m a big boy!”
“Oh, bud,” Daddy sighed.
“Not hungry,” he said, slumping down into the seat and resting his knees against the back of the driver’s seat.
His concerns were not misplaced.  It was only midday, but it had been a long, busy morning, and John was struggling.  The prospect of having to examine his second deceased body of the day did not sit well.  He sighed, fighting the impulse to lean into Greg’s chest to ask him to take him home, away from death and dirty motel rooms.  He imagined how nice it would be to be bundled up in the car, where he could put his head in Greg’s lap, maybe even suck his thumb.
“I’ve taken the night off,” Mycroft said again, this time to John.  “In case--”
“Don’t feel like a boy,” they mumbled.
“It’s just after lunch!” Sherlock called out.  “It’s not bedtime yet!”
John shifted his legs, then cursed to himself.  It was not just sweat which had made him feel so clammy.  He had peed the bed.
Mycroft was never there when he wanted him.  Even when John was away with Papa and Sherlock should have had Mycroft all to himself, Mycroft had people to deal with who were more important than him.  It wasn’t fair, and the resentment he felt--the desire to prove to his big brother he didn't need him, anyway--had him aging up to his teenaged persona, sullen and moody.
Bunny stumbled and was pressed against a column in the center of the attic.  Sherlock yanked the rope he had been using to keep his pants up from the belt loops of his trousers, pressing Bunny up against the column with his elbow.  Bunny was pushing at Sherlock’s arm, trying to get him to stop hurting his collarbone, and before he understood what was happening, Sherlock had tied his hands together behind the column, the rope digging into his wrists.
“I’m not a baby!” Sherlock argued around his pacifier, but Bunny turned in his seat and waved to the lake house through the window before pausing, seeming to realize just what Mycroft had said.
Sherlock had been planning to refuse to go to the lake house.  He didn’t know if he could handle a weekend away without becoming more vulnerable than he wanted to, without letting the sense of purposelessness plunge him into depression and anger and neediness.  Age play was in large part about a loss of control, and Sherlock worried that if he allowed himself to sink down right now, he would lose even the small semblance of control he had always been able to retain while little.  And that terrified him.
I also want to apologize for not responding to all of your lovely comments--I let myself get behind, but I promise I will catch up soon!
If you haven't read the newest ficlet, "Naughty Naptime," it's up on my tumblr,
Pulling the pad of paper towards himself, Greg wrote
“Hate to break it to you, but he’s your son, too, love,” he said.
A part of John questioned whether he should go through with the plan, but the slight warmth of his damp briefs against his skin was comforting, and the thought of helplessly wetting himself, the knowledge that he was so close to losing it in his pants, was already making him feel smaller.  So, with a deep breath and a burying of his face into the knees against his chest, John released his bladder and began to pee.
Remember a few chapters back, when I said I would probably finish up this story in 2 or 3 chapters? Well, we're 2 or 3 chapters later and we've still got a bit more to cover of the weekend, so expect at least a few more chapters before this one is wrapped up and a new story in the series begins.
Daddy pulled the door closed behind him, but stopped before Bunny could get upset, peeking through the sliver of opened doorway to smile and lay a finger over his lips, signalling to Bunny that it was time to get to sleep.  Bunny didn’t like it when bedroom doors were closed all the way, even at naptime, when daylight streamed in through the blinds and around the edges of curtains.  Luckily, Daddy knew just how to keep her feeling safe, and always left the doorways cracked open.
Please continue letting me know what you'd like to see/see more of in the comments!
“He is a grown man,” she said, nodding.  Her voice was low, careful.  “Except, I'm guessing there are days it's a bit too hard for him to be grown?”
Sherlock was staring at the plastic changing table with worry.
And then Sherlock heard the door that connected his room to Bunny’s squeak on its hinges as it closed, and he knew he was alone with Papa.
John smiled across the table to encourage Sherlock.  God knows John had seen his fair share of coping mechanisms in the midst of the soldiers he treated in Afghanistan.  Although he had never seen ageplay used on the field, he was aware of it as a treatment method for PTSD or anxiety.  It was strange to find his best friend engaging in the lifestyle, but he could already imagine just how beneficial this was for the usually surly and overstimulated Sherlock who often felt the weight of the world on his shoulders.
He glanced down to Bunny, and Greg could see that he was assessing whether the boy was deep enough asleep for him to feel free to speak uncensored.  He held up a hand to signal to Greg that he’d should follow, then picked Bunny up and carried him into the living room.  Greg stepped behind him closely, already uneasy without one kid in his sights and not eager to be out of the presence of both.
“Baker Street,” John managed after another kiss, sliding from the seat and retrieving Sherlock’s coat.
Mycroft nodded, but looked skeptical.
“Sherlock,” John said, head tilted and gaze pointed
“Do you have to go potty?” Papa asked, and Sherlock shook his head, stepping close to Papa so the man could tear the sides of the saturated pull-up and take the heavy garment away from Sherlock's stinging skin.
“We should get cleaned up,” John said, pressing himself up onto his elbows and causing Sherlock to whine as he was jostled.  “You get in the shower.  I’ll take care of the bedding and then join you.”
“Please?” the Bunny breathed, blinking back what he knew Sherlock would see as pathetic tears.
“Miss you, Daddy,” he said.
“I can’t,” he said, but a part of him was desperate for Papa to gather him up and coax the story out of him.
But John could already feel himself leaking again, knew he wouldn’t make it even the short ride back to Baker Street.  He groaned in the back of his throat.
Eventually the bedwetting became something that only happened a few times a year.  But those nights with Mycroft taking care of him had uncovered a longing within Sherlock, and, even far into his teenage years, if Mycroft was back home from college and Sherlock woke up soaked, he would go to his big brother, hemming and hawing at the doorway as he struggled to overcome his wounded pride.  A part of him said he was too old to need help with a wet bed, too old to want comfort, and so there was generally a half hour or so where he debated between simply cleaning himself up and waking up Mycroft.  But, in the end, Mycroft had never been a very deep sleeper, and when he inevitably woke up to find his brother at the doorway in soiled pajamas, Sherlock let him take over, unable to resist the idea of his brother caring for him.
Then again, John had to admit that he had not been able to keep from thinking just how much he wanted to lie in a dark room with his comfort items when he arrived back to Baker Street, snuggled up in bed with his stuffed lion and, as long as the door was locked, his pacifier.  He could not help but blush in embarrassment over how much he wanted the comfort.
“Breathe, sweetheart,” Greg said, reaching to pull the seat belt across John’s chest and buckling him in.  “I’ll just be a minute.”
Mycroft nodded.  “That's right.  And Sherlock knows that, too.  Sherlock wants the humiliation.  He enjoys it and he needs it. We’ve talked about this before in relation to his thumb sucking.  I respond to Sherlock sucking his thumb differently than I do you, right?”
His sadness shifted into anger as he shifted up in headspace, and he hurled all the pillows from his bed in a fit of frustration, pleased when one caught the pirate ship lamp and sent it careening from the desk to the floorboards, shattering the ceramic figure of the lamp's base as well as the light bulb.
Bunny stayed on the floor to the left of the couch, having an elephant climb a tower and then, with a glance towards his brother—snuggled tight and comfortable in his Daddy’s arms—reaching out his arms to knock Sherlock’s blocks to the ground.  It wasn’t fair that Daddy snuggled Sherlock.  Who would snuggle Bunny?
Sherlock reached to feel the wetness spreading down his thigh even as he kept defiant eye contact with Papa.  The naughtiness settled his mind a bit.  He had coaxed a pseudo-disciplinarian out of Papa, could see the man weighing options for punishment.  He needed him to take charge, to start making demands.
Who was to say whether Eurus’s convoluted rhyme had even been decipherable, let alone understandable, to a boy as young as Sherlock all those years ago?  Who was to say she would have told them where she’d hidden Victor Trevor even if Sherlock had solved the riddle?  Who was to say Victor had even been alive while Eurus tormented Sherlock with her sing-song?
John could feel his cheeks pinking at Mycroft’s allusions to the previous night.  He ran a hand along the back of his neck, clearing his throat once more.  It was all well and good for Mycroft to pass everything off so cavalierly, but John could not help but feel plagued by the shame of it all.  He was a soldier, and soldiers didn’t need coddling.  What would Sherlock think if he found out John had let Mycroft bathe him while he was fully adult?  What would Greg think?
“Uncle Greg is going to put you to bed tonight, bud, remember?  We talked about this.”
“I'm going to sit right out here, kid,” the voice that sounded like Uncle Greg said.  “And when you're ready you come on out and we’ll get you all cleaned up and nice and settled, okay?”
“It’s all a bit confusing,” he said, unable to express himself as clearly as he would have liked.
, Mycroft corrected himself--could not be honest and upfront about her emotions.  Mycroft had been close-minded and short-sighted, and he hated that his bigotry had caused his kid stress.
It was clear to Greg as he lifted a dripping John out of the wet backseat that the boy was having a rough morning.  Mycroft had specifically instructed Bunny to use the loo before they’d left Baker Street, and it was now clear that their usually compliant child had deliberately disobeyed his Daddy’s request.  It was out of character for their sweet Bunny who generally felt too much guilt to break the rules, and Greg wanted nothing more than to clean him up, give him some love, and see what was bothering him.
He fumbled with his phone and answered, straddling anger and concern.
“You have to call me Bunny, now,” John said, a bit louder.  This is what he needed.  Mycroft would be proud of him for voicing his needs.
“I know, Bun,” Daddy said.  “But it’s dirty.  We’ll get you a nice clean one at home.”
“I'm not a child, Greg,” Sherlock mumbled, shifting himself back into adulthood, but Mycroft could see his brother’s resolve was slipping.
Sherlock nodded, then allowed his brother to play his stuffed alligator on the seat beside him as he cleaned up the toys from the bag Sherlock had kicked over earlier.
“You sure you’re alright, kid?” Greg asked, and John realized the man staring.
Sherlock squirmed under the praise, but Mycroft could sense it settled his brother in a small way.  It made sense that Sherlock would need a way to keep himself young while out in public where there were additional distractions which could more easily pull him out of headspace.  He was just glad the pull-ups had not leaked, as they were very close to doing.  Lestrade did not deserve to take care of two sets of wet pants.
John knew they were joking, that Sherlock was teasing to shift John away from his overthinking tendencies, but he couldn’t help but feel a stab of guilt.   Anderson--whether little or adult--hadn’t deserved to receive the brunt of John’s anger.  Neither did Greg deserve to spend hours of his day cleaning up the mess while John settled himself into the protection of headspace.  His stomach was in knots over the prospect that word may have gotten back to the Chief Inspector; John wasn’t sure he’d ever forgive himself if Greg were to lose his job because of the anger issues he’d never exactly dealt with.
He gathered his comfort items and hurried across the hallway to peek through the crack in Sherlock’s bedroom door.  The room was darkened by the lowered blinds and the storm, but Bunny could see Sherlock sprawled out beneath the sheet, on his stomach, arm tucked close to his side, hugging Dimitri the dinosaur close.
Sherlock hesitated, mumbling something to himself.
“Makes me feel safe,” he said.  “Less worried about being grown-up.”
It wasn’t that John didn’t appreciate what Mycroft had done for him--the man had waited outside the guest room door knowing John would need him.  He had slept upright in an old wooden desk chair the entire night.  He had offered support and comfort that John had desperately needed.  It was just that Mycroft reminded John of his own perceived weakness, and at the moment he was in danger of being swallowed whole by the reminders.
“Then it’s settled,” Mycroft said, smiling.  “I’ll be your big brother and Bunny’s Daddy, and you’ll both be my favorite boys.  How does that sound?”
Mycroft turned towards him.
“It’s been a rough morning,” John said, nodding to the plastic object resting on the kitchen table.  It was a red pacifier with a pirate in a blue hat on the plastic bobble.  Always pirates and dinosaurs with Sherlock.
Let me know your thoughts and please feel free to pass along constructive criticism.  Hopefully Mycroft's motivation/gameplan throughout this chapter makes sense, but if you have questions or suggestions for making things more cohesive/clear, let me know.  I'm excited to get back to ageplay in the next chapter (preview: regressed little Sherlock crying over his lost dog *sob*)
Mycroft took the dishes to the sink; they had agreed long ago that Greg would do the cooking and Mycroft the cleaning up.  But Greg was too much of a softy to let Mycroft clean the dishes by himself, so he was soon by his side with a dishtowel, waiting to dry each cup and plate and fork and knife.
Sherlock lifted his arm off of his eyes and turned from his back onto his side, getting his first glimpse of the man beside him.  John’s eyes were half-lidded, the man allowing himself to languidly bask in the pleasure of sharing a bed with his boyfriend, who currently had his hand cupped around his genitals.
The commotion sent the second tech scrambling to his feet to separate the two men, and soon Greg and a handful of others came rushing into the cramped room.
The fight had gone out of John--Sherlock was surprised he had kept it up for so long while in headspace, which he used as an escape from his anger issues--and he became teary as he let himself be led to the corner in the kitchen they had dubbed the time-out spot.  His body was limp and boneless; he had given in to being manipulated solely by Mycroft, who eventually got him into place in the corner.  As soon as John was in time-out, he sunk to the ground, put his face in his hands, and cried.
“He refused to put on a pull-up, earlier,” Mycroft whispered as he crossed the room to the dresser on the wall opposite the bed and, opening the top drawer, pulled out a Goodnite.
"He's been gone for three days," John whispered.  "Just came back from what was obviously a drug-induced weekend and seems to be hurt in some..What? I---no, I don't, Mycroft.  He's asking for you.  He's--"
The boy shrugged, then seemed to get uncomfortable and turned back to shove his mermaids down under the water.  He pushed them down and watched them pop up to the surface, then pushed them down once more.  Mycroft remained patient, waiting for the boy to explain himself.
Mycroft’s steps were quick and light on the wooden staircase.
“Juice, please,” Sherlock said when Mycroft was finished, reaching out his hand for the sippy-cup on the counter.
“'Lock, if this is what you need,” Mycroft said as he exited the car, “It’s okay.  I understand.”
Greg breathed a laugh, taking a deep drink from the beer can.
“There we go,” Mycroft said as he sat Sherlock onto the end of the bed in the green and blue bedroom.  He kept from mentioning that Sherlock should have woken him up earlier, not wanting to encourage the boy in thinking he had acted incorrectly.  “You’re okay, now.”
“Me too?” John asked, tugging on Mycroft’s shirt.  He had never liked chocolate milk, and had refused it earlier that night, when Uncle Greg had offered it to him and Sherlock, but now that Sherlock seemed to like it so much, now that he saw how happy it had made Sherlock, he thought maybe he’d try it again.
John had been struggling as the day wore on to keep his footing as a put-together adult.  He willed himself to remain adult for just a few hours longer, just until he could be alone with Papa.  He ran a hand down the back of his neck and cleared his throat.
Sure enough, a few moments later, John stumbled into the kitchen, dressed in child-like Harry Potter Gryffindor pajamas and with a baby blanket wrapped around his shoulders, but he was very much in his adult mind.  It was clear he was relieved to find Mycroft waiting for him.
“Yes, love?”
John had his fingers in his mouth.  He was feeling particularly young, surprisingly close to tears.  Mycroft leaned down to kiss him on the forehead and bring the blankets up beneath his chin.
Bunny nodded, rubbing at one eye.  He made a distressed noise which Greg attributed to anticipation of his future punishment until the boy next spoke.
“Sherlock?” John asked, hesitant.  “Are you okay, then?”
"You won't understand, John," Sherlock said, face dark, pained.  "Just call Mycroft.  I won't last much longer.  I feel so...I need Mycroft."
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been perched in the old treehouse by the time Greg found him.  He’d stumbled upon the structure quickly in his short walk through the woods, and had ventured inside when he’d seen Greg's and his brothers’ initials carved on the doorframe.  The structure was built only a few feet off the ground, stabilized by four trees, which the planks had been cut to accommodate, one at each corner.
But after a moment which seemed to assure him that Mrs. Hudson was not about to poke her head out of her flat to check on the ruckus, John managed to get the smaller of his two keys into the door of their flat, and he let himself in.  It was a relief to be home, in the silent calm after the rush of noise and activity he’d left behind at the bar.
He let the kid have the derogation and did not chastise when he saw the kid stuff his thumb into his mouth.  Had he been less exhausted by Sherlock’s moodiness, he would have pulled the car to the side of the road and pulled the kid over his knees.  But he was more than ready to be back in London and his flat, back to Greg and the stability of his own environment.  As long as Sherlock was relatively well-behaved for the car ride, the spanking could wait.
He brought his thumb to his lips and Mycroft, tsking, guided his hand away.  Sherlock needed structure and rules at the moment.  His thumb-sucking had become something a bit more complicated in recent weeks, and thus Mycroft had not routinely chastised the boy for the act.  But the current incident was clearly a ploy for attention and discipline, which Mycroft could easily provide.
“I think I'm ready to start showing this side of myself to Sherlock,” he said, eyes on his shoes.
Mycroft removed his loosened tie and bent to pick up the puzzle pieces scattered across the living room carpet.
There was a knock on the door after Mycroft had washed up the bunny and had settled back to let the boy play.  Mycroft and Bunny looked up from the wall of the tub where they were playing tic-tac-toe with bath crayons.  Bunny was covered in bubbles and surrounded by his favorite plastic mermaids.  His hair was wet and dripping into his face, but he was happy at last.
When Mycroft entered 221b Baker Street, it was to the sound of Sherlock’s cries.  He settled the grocery bags onto the table in the kitchen, where John was making lunch.  Sherlock was collapsed in the kitchen, on the ground in the corner next to the refrigerator.  He was throwing a bit of a fit.  He turned to look at Mycroft when his brother entered, then screamed louder.  Sherlock looked pitiful, his hair mussed and his face a mess of tears as he dissolved into a new rush of crying.  John was apathetic to the tears, which Mycroft knew signalled that the man had already had a trying morning with his misbehaving brother.
“Do you want to wear pull-ups to bed, like Sherlock?”
“Climb on in, champ,” Greg told Sherlock as he pulled back the duvet and sheet on the bed in the guest bedroom before settling Bunny down beside him.  He had a passing worry that the guest bedroom may trigger tears in the little Bunny, reminding him of the nightmares and self-consciousness of the night before.  But Bunny was still half-asleep, yawning and pressing himself against the pillow as soon as he was placed into bed beside Sherlock.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” he said.
Bunny tried to tell Sherlock he was sorry he wasn’t naughty too, but he was caught up in a yawn and only managed the roughest form of the words.  Sherlock smirked.
His brain was fuzzy from the fib and the disappointment on Papa’s face and the funny excitement of the diaper’s growing bulk between his legs.  He pushed the wee as fast as he could into the diaper, pleased when he felt a trickle escape from the leghole and begin to wet a patch of his dinosaur pajama pants, soiling his clothes and making his accident messier.
“No need to apologize, little one,” Papa said, pulling Bunny to his chest once more.  “Is the bed wet, too?”
Sherlock nodded, and when Mycroft opened his arms to give him a hug, all finally felt right.
After another quick glance to the door and a moment where he paused to check for any noise coming from the hallway, he took a pull-up from the drawer and tossed it onto the bed beside the joggers.  He then made fast work of peeling his now cold, wet jeans down his legs, followed by his sopping underwear.  His cheeks pinked when he realized that even the bottom hem of his t-shirt had gotten wet, so he stripped it from his torso and used the dry sections to wipe between his legs, not finding any wet wipes nearby.
Greg sent.
“Half an hour longer and the television is turned off,” Mycroft said as he stood to carry the half-empty plate to the kitchen.  Sherlock had made it clear he had eaten all the breakfast he was going to accept.  “No arguments.”
“You’ve done nothing wrong, kiddo,” he said, taking a seat on the edge of the bathtub and reaching for the boy until he was standing between his legs.  “But your tongue has an owie on it from your pacifier.  We need to give your tongue a bit of a break so it has time to heal.”
“John, Greg and I care for you.  We want you to be happy.  And neither of us want you to stifle your desires or censor yourself simply for the sake of propriety.  There’s nothing wrong with this, kid.”
“Was wearing a pull-up, Papa,” he whimpered in confusion, already pulling his wet nightgown up towards his chest as if he wanted nothing more than to be free of the wet clothing.
“Uncle Greg and I don’t want you to be anything but what you want to be,” he said with a smile.
Mycroft trusted John, perhaps more so than anyone except Greg and definitely more so than he trusted his unpredictably selfish little brother.  Even so, John had far less experience dealing with an emotionally volatile Sherlock Holmes than Mycroft did himself.  He also worried that John had barely had time to properly transition up in headspace; only hours before he had been as deep in headspace as Mycroft had seen him. Was he really prepared to process aspects of his fully adult relationship with Sherlock?  There was a part of Mycroft itching to race down the staircase and check up on the two.
He hadn’t realized just how much of a mess he would make, and, as he felt urine pooling beneath him on the carseat, he became nervous.  What if Papa was mad about his backseat?  What if Daddy punished him for not going potty when he’d been told to?  What if he got another spanking on his already sore bum?  Maybe this all wasn’t such a good idea, after all.
“Furthermore,” Sherlock continued, seemingly unaware that John was not entirely following.  “Although I’m more than content for you to express yourself as female when or if you’d like to, I predict that it will not be something you desire more than the occasional day or night here and there.  It's glaringly apparent that your psyche is rather fixed on working through your own childhood experiences in this regard, meaning that you will mirror that which you felt as a child by remaining attached to what have generally been coded feminine items.  However, now that you’ve gone through the process of testing the levels of Mycroft and Lestrade's acceptance and thus soothing your worries about the real issue, which is your association with stereotypically 'girly' items, you won’t have nearly as much drive to label your gender quite so specifically."
“No,” he said.  “No, we won’t.”
Greg took a seat in a Adirondack chair and ran a hand down his face.
“Sherlock."
“We need to talk about what happened at the store, sweetheart,” Mycroft said when the boy did not say anything further.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as if he were sick of having to deal with Bunny’s babyish behavior.
Mycroft sighed and took a seat at the end of the bed so that he was facing John, patting John’s leg where it rested beneath the sheets.
“Listen to me, bud,” Greg said, waiting for the boy to look up at him before he continued.  “There is nothing wrong with wanting to wear an Ariel nightgown, or wanting to play with bunnies, or wanting to color pictures of unicorns and mermaids.  It’s the same as Sherlock wanting to dress up in his pirate shirt and play with dinosaurs.”
They all glanced to Sherlock, who gave an almost imperceptible nod which John took to mean that he was okay with the idea.
Bunny rubbed at his eyes and smiled at his big brother.  If Sherlock was teasing again instead of outright name calling and shoving, maybe things would be okay.
“Hey, kid,” he said when he answered, voice quiet to keep Bunny from waking.  “What’s up?”
Papa had told him Mycroft would be there when he woke up.  He’d promised.
John turned to face Greg, opening his mouth wide.  Greg took hold of Bunny’s chin and peered into his mouth.  He had suspected bleeding gums, but it was clear as soon as John opened his mouth that it was his tongue that was the problem, not his gums.  Hour after hour of Bunny’s often aggressive sucking on a pacifier seemed to have irritated his tongue, and it had bled when he brushed it.
“And?” Mycroft prompted.
“I think that sounds like a great idea, baby,” Greg said.  “I’ll talk it over with Daddy and remind him that you’re still just learning to use the potty.  Does that sound okay?”
“And?”
Sherlock woke up with a start and almost immediately yanked the pirate pacifier from his mouth.  The sheet had been pulled halfway over his face,  but Bunny had seen the red plastic bobble in his mouth before he had taken it out and shoved it beneath his pillow.
“Poor son-of-a-bitch didn’t know what he was in for,” Anderson said when they'd seen the extent of the bruising around his neck.  He breathed a laugh as he began scraping beneath the man’s fingernails for residual DNA.
“You know as well as I that, as complicated as John’s relationship is to wetting, Sherlock’s is moreso” Mycroft whispered as Greg helped him lay Bunny on the couch.  “I imagine the entire subject has brought about rather convoluted and intricate emotions that he may not have been anticipating.  John is returning to explore this part of himself after many years of adulthood; Sherlock, in a sense, has never stopped exploring.”
He was already feeling the effects, but one more wouldn’t hurt.  If anything, being drunk with Sherlock was helping him to forget the events of the day, of the past few days.  He hadn’t thought about Mycroft for more than a fleeting moment in hours.
He’d picked up his phone to call Greg only thirty minutes after speaking with him.
John nodded, not minding Greg’s pet name despite the fact that he was aged up; Greg had always been rather paternal when it came to John and Sherlock.  They shared an amused grin over Mycroft’s current breed of mother-henning before John left the living room and made his way to Sherlock’s bedroom.
Thanks for all your well-wishes, hits, and kudos, as always.  You're all the best!
Sherlock could stand it no longer.
Daddy twisted his head to follow the sound of tumbling blocks to glance at Bunny, kneeling on the carpet.
“Is she okay?” he asked, although there was more obligation than concern to the question.
Bunny blushed to the tips of his ears.  He’d been mistaken for one of Papa’s nieces, chastised for being out of bed after lights out.  He chewed on his bottom lip, not sure whether to call out and correct the mistake or to remain silent and do what he could to sneak back to the guest room.  The entire situation made him feel terribly small.
“Mycroft has no idea just how debauched his
“It’s okay,” he said, and Sherlock suddenly brightened, smiling as if freed from the weight of his bad behavior.  He reached for the plastic mermaid and kneeled on the bathmat to place her next to the others, lined up along the edge of the tub, as Bunny began explaining the game he had been playing with them.  Mycroft stepped in before Sherlock and Bunny got too far involved in the game.
Mycroft gathered Sherlock onto his lap and let the boy cry for a bit.
“Oh, you mean when you keep your pants dry?” Mycroft asked, and Bunny nodded, eyes shining with happiness.
“I’ll be downstairs,” he said.  “In case you need anything.”
“I didn’t mean to,” he sniffled, residual tears spilling over onto his cheeks.
Uncle Greg sighed and closed his eyes for a moment with a smile.
“There’s more to this than you’re letting on,” he said, wishing Mycroft would realize he wouldn’t jeopardize his brother’s well-being were he to place his full trust in Greg.
“Are there monsters in the lake?” John asked once he had been settled back into bed beneath the sheets and his baby blanket.  It was warm, an early summer evening, but Mycroft had told Uncle Greg earlier that a thunderstorm was on its way.
“But now he won’t want to play with me, anymore,” Bunny sniffled, a fresh onset of tears threatening.
Mycroft glanced at John as if assessing his current state of mind.  He nodded after a moment, then stood and held out John’s new nightgown.
“I want to stay here,” Bunny said, tears continuing to flow, the pacifier slipping from his mouth.  “I’m sorry I said I’m a girl.”
“Tummy ache,” Sherlock said with a shrug, because it was the closest thing to the truth that he could find the words for at the moment.
Pausing at the foot of the stairs, he took a moment to return to himself, needing to level his head before he began what he assumed would be a challenging conversation with his brother.  He couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss.  It was clear he had harmed his relationship with Sherlock.  Now he seemed to have lost a part of John as well.
It was rare that John heard such honest--albeit convoluted--expressions of emotion from the man, and it concerned him.  Sherlock looked to be in pain, and John could tell from the drawn look on his face that he more than likely had not been sleeping or eating wherever it was he had been.  He did not need to have Sherlock's powers of deduction to know the man had more than likely been in a drug den.  But this sudden need for Mycroft was something unexpected; the Holmes brothers were not even getting along presently, and John had to admit he felt put out when Sherlock requested his brother instead of letting John help in whatever way he could.
“Don't be a baby,” Sherlock said, voice harsh, glaring at Bunny because he had broken out of character and called Sherlock by his real name.  “This is how you play pirates.”
“I’ll let you take the lead, bud, unless you tell me otherwise, okay?  I want you to be comfortable.”
“I’m not!” he yelled as he hurled the cup to the ground.  “Be quiet!”
Bunny was tired of being in the attic.  It was getting stuffy in the small space and his eyes hurt from the dust and he really should go downstairs soon to wee.
“I had a little accident,” he said, as if the evidence weren’t spreading across the plastic sheet towards Sherlock as he spoke.
Although it was no secret that Sherlock often wet himself, that he enjoyed holding his bladder and losing control, and that he chose to wet the bed and his pants whenever the whim struck him while in headspace, perhaps only Mycroft and Sherlock knew the man still struggled with real accidents.  Sherlock quite often played off all his wet trousers--whether they happened in headspace or out--as intentional acts in order to guard himself against embarrassment and ridicule.  He had long since learned to verbally degrade himself or laugh off what were deemed unacceptable actions before others could do it for him, but Mycroft knew better than to fall for Sherlock’s facades of bravado.
Sherlock raised his arms, asking to be picked up once more.  He was settled in Uncle Greg's arms by the time Bunny ran from the bathroom and leaped back onto the bed.  He grabbed his new plush rabbit, which he tucked beneath one arm as he bounced towards them.
Mycroft undressed his brother quickly and wiped him down with baby wipes.  He didn’t think Sherlock would take well to the suggestion of a bath; the boy had just been bathed the night before.
“Listen to me, Bun,” he said, wanting nothing more than to comfort the sweet man in front of him, to make him understand that he had done nothing wrong.  “It’s been a tough day for everyone.  We woke up much too early and with far too much stress, and we’ve spent the day navigating a rather emotional set of circumstances.  But, throughout it all, you’ve been nothing but a good, sweet boy.”
“You need to stay big, Sherlock,” he said, bluntness winning out over any tactful desire to speak in coded suggestions.
Thanks for your support, loves!  Just another chapter or two and we'll have all of the boys back together again for their own little Christmas celebration.  Easter had me buzzing with ideas for this series, but I figured we should finish Christmas before moving onto another holiday ;p!
“Come here, buddy,” Mycroft said, lifting Sherlock from the end of the bed and into his arms.
“He’d been doing so well,” Mycroft said with a sigh.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around Mycroft’s waist and pressed his head against Mycroft’s hip.
John nodded and held the phone out to Greg, who walked into the living room and spoke softly with his back to the kitchen so that John couldn’t hear the conversation he was having with Mycroft.
Greg helped him undress and let him choose some bath toys and add in bubble bath.  It was clear Mycroft had been thorough when explaining to Lestrade the procedures of their domestic routine, for which John continued to be grateful.
Mycroft reached forward to tickle John at the base of his neck beneath his left ear.  The boy squirmed where he sat, giggling as he involuntarily pressed his ear to his shoulder in an attempt to escape Mycroft’s wandering fingers.
Sherlock woke with a groan, casting an arm over his eyes to shield himself from the light streaming through John’s bedroom window.  He prefered when they slept in his bed downstairs.  His curtains were heavier, and the morning light never seemed quite so harsh from the other side of the flat.
Sherlock still wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about Bunny being a girl.  It had all seemed okay last night, in theory.  Talking abstractly last night with Mycroft about Bunny’s shifting gender had been one thing; actually being asked to interact with little girl Bunny was a different matter.
His Daddy brought him into his bedroom to dress him in sweatpants and a long-sleeved shirt and a jumper.  Bunny turned away the first jumper he’d chosen, telling his Daddy it was too itchy but really not wanting it because it was maroon, which was a bit too close to pink.  He could tell his Daddy was watching him and had questions in his mind, but Bunny was glad he didn’t say anything as he pulled out a navy blue jumper and strung it over Bunny’s arms.
John nodded, trying to blink back tears but only succeeding in causing them to spill over onto his cheeks.  He’d been wrestling with memories of his father since the aftereffects of his nightmare the night before.  Why did they have to stumble upon a crime scene that reminded him of all those years ago?  He’d left those nights in stifling motel rooms smelling of fast food and cigarette smoke far behind him; he thought he’d put them to rest once and for all once his father had been buried.  Harry had shown up drunk to the funeral, which John had almost been able to acknowledge as some sort of tribute.  The memories were supposed to have stayed in the past.
Sherlock was scribbling rather haphazardly into an old outer space coloring book while snacking on the apples and peanut butter Mycroft had made for him.  He licked between his fingers where the remnants of his messy eating remained, then ducked his head down to run his tongue over a corner of the coloring book stained with a glob of peanut butter.
Greg quirked an eyebrow at his boyfriend.  “Pushover,” he smirked.
“I’m sorry, Daddy,” John said, eyes watering once more.  “I’m sorry for arguing back and for throwing my fork and making a mess.”
Bunny glanced at Sherlock once more, could see that his brother, despite having his head buried in his arms, had stilled and was listening intently to the conversation.  Bunny knew that his Daddy wanted him to have the chance to dress in the colors he wanted, was trying to encourage him to embrace the part of himself that wanted any and everything “girly,” but he wasn’t sure talking about it in front of Sherlock was a very good idea.  That said, the thought of glittery stickers and new clothes that didn’t have to have dinosaurs or lions or trucks or camouflage on them was exciting.  Sherlock wasn’t watching, and Bunny let himself smile as he nodded.
“You don’t have to be potty training if you don’t wish to be, kiddo,” Mycroft assured.  “You can take it at your own pace.  There’s lots of history, there.  It’s understandable that putting yourself back into that mindset is difficult.”
"Mycroft," John interrupted, eyes wide, voice distracted.  "You should come now.  He's just..."
“Christ, Sherlock, stop playing around and get inside,” Mycroft said in exasperation when he noticed that Sherlock did not move.  He crossed around the car and yanked open the passenger door of the SUV.  “You can’t do this here.  Go use the loo.”
“None of that, now,” he said, shaking his head.  “We’ve talked about this before.  No apologizing for what’s out of your control.”
“Sherlock?”
Greg turned to glance at Bunny in the seat behind him.  The boy was holding his bunny close to his chest, his baby blanket draped over his knees.
Sherlock nodded, then succumbed to a yawn.  The boy was barely holding on to wakefulness.
Beside him, Bunny mumbled around a mouthful of toothbrush and foaming toothpaste, looking towards Sherlock and then to Greg.
But it was a poor excuse for having let his guard down, and he could feel the tendrils of self-criticism begin to claw their sharp way into his mind.
“Let’s get you back to--” the intimidating, bearded man paused as he caught sight of who was actually at the top of the steps, immediately realizing his mistake.
Papa nodded and, placing a heavy hand on his shoulder, settled Sherlock into the corner of the kitchen.  It was the first time all day Sherlock felt he was right where he was supposed to be.
Mycroft followed close behind, and, for once, the stress of London and governmental responsibilities and the constant worry about his brother’s welfare seemed far from his mind.
Mycroft turned back towards him.
P.S. For those of you waiting for Sherlock's punishment from Mycroft as he settles him back down into a calm headspace, rest assured that we'll get back to it :)
Sherlock was not ready to express his feelings about the morning’s events in any way that might be considered mature.  He was hurt and confused, but for a man desperate to appear independent and self-sufficiently intelligent, those were two emotions nearly impossible to come to terms with, let alone admit to others.  It had happened before: Sherlock slipping in headspace to keep from dealing with bullying from his classmates, or to keep from admitting to his own loneliness, or, the night before Mycroft had left for university, to keep from having to tell his big brother how much he would miss him.  In headspace Sherlock didn’t have to uphold societal norms or behave in ways appropriate to the standards he had set for himself; if he was angry, he could act out; if he was lonely, he could ask for comfort.
