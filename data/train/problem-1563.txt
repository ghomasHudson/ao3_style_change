“So have me. Take me.” Sherlock whispered, and recapturing John's lips, he slid his hands down the back of John’s pants. “I’ve been yours for quite a while now.”
one of my favorites. Lead the way, Future-Husband!”
“Yes, I saw. You took advantage of the hand sanitizer dispenser outside my room, I saw you rubbing it in and I can smell it from here, so that tells me you’re most likely medical personnel. You’re a doctor and not a nurse because you looked at my chart first upon entering the room. Doctors always look at the charts first to acquaint or reacquaint themselves with the patient’s case. Nurses look to the patient first, as they tend to already have all the particulars memorized, and the patients themselves are the priority.” It felt good to use his brain again.
“Not all the time, and this is one of the times you are very, very wrong. Everything that just happened now,” John said, grinding down, dragging himself so agonizingly slowly against Sherlock, “that was me trying to deserve you.”
“I’m not saying you can’t. No, I’m just surprised you hadn’t deduced it all in that split second you ran past me. This is just one more thing I’ve had to tell the world’s most talented consulting detective.” John said with a smirk. “I didn’t know I was such an enigma.”
“You want to hear about cases?” Sherlock asked, he actually sounded surprised.
“Yeah,” Sebastian nodded. He was proud of this, the sick fuck. “We’ve been hassling the freak all year, but then we stopped. We left him alone, made him think he was safe, yeah? So then a couple weeks ago we catch him coming back late one night. He was all distracted, and had a freaky grin on his face.” John stomach was in knots; he had been the reason Sherlock was distracted that night. They had just… Sherlock had been happy, and then…
Sherlock was just finishing off an email to a Miss Melody Kingston, informing her that the young woman seemingly following her, was actually her biological half-sister hoping to connect, when he heard it, a voice he hadn’t heard in years. It was a voice he had hoped he would never hear again.
Now what do you say you do an old woman a favor, and leave some of those lovely comments/corrections/thoughts? If you do that, then I'll update day after tomorrow (disregard the fact I'm going to do it anyway)
“I do live here.” Sherlock said flatly, not looking up from his microscope. Was he doomed to never get a moment’s peace? He did have a murder to solve, after all.
Sherlock stared down at their joined hands for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and looking into John’s eyes. “John Watson, you are the best of me. Before I met you, when I pictured my life, pictured my future, I saw a solitary life. Before I met you, I thought I was destined to be alone, and I made peace with that. As I am sure many here can attest, I am a difficult man.” John couldn’t help letting a small laugh slip at that. “Some have accused me of being cold, and unfeeling. I am rude, I am impatient, I can be childish, and completely oblivious to those around me, and how my actions or words can affect them. I won’t lie, I had cultivated that image. I thought I was meant to be alone, and I believed being ‘the freak’ would protect me.” John swallowed hard as Sherlock started to waver, the subtle sound of a tear entering his voice. Sherlock should never be alone, never, and it hurt to think he spent so long believing it was his lot.
they've
“No! Absolutely not!” Sherlock had to be actively held back in his chair by Mr. Holmes, shouting at PC Butler. “But in either case,” he continued after regaining his composure, “shouldn’t the note be analyzed by an actual specialist? Pardon me if I don’t trust the expertise of you, or Andrews, or the talented George Watson.”
More references to torture and physical abuse. But at least the boys have each other to make it all a little better.
If just being in the club made John feel out of place, it was nothing compared to being on the dance floor. It was crowded, enough so that there was only about a foot between John and Sherlock, and the number of people made everything that much warmer, that much more… humid. John hadn’t been lying when he said he wasn’t a dancer, even before the army he never felt at home on the dance floor, but now he felt stiff and awkward. Sherlock however, all confusion gone, looked completely in his element.
She claims that the stillness of the dead bodies are less distracting than the constant motion and interactions going on inside the living. It’s a bit morbid, but John figures you have to be a bit morbid to make your living dealing with disease, injury, and death.
Before Sherlock could say anything else, the waiter arrived to take their orders. All talk of human trafficking ceased, and by the time their food had arrived – a vegetable soup base with three types of meats, four types of vegetables, and two types of noodles to add – the topic had shifted to Sherlock’s physical therapy. John nearly sprayed the table when Sherlock told him that Heather had suggested adding swimming to the regimen. Apparently, the image of him in swim trunks,
“Oh thank God!” And suddenly Molly was down next to him on the floor, her arms thrown around his shoulders.
“I’m just making sure this isn’t some sort of set up,” Sherlock said with a sniff, “that the rest of your team isn’t going pop out and jump me or something.”
“Thanks for covering for me back there.” John mumbled to Mike once the topic of conversation had blessedly shifted.
“No, no. I’ll leave that in your team’s capable hands. I’m just wanted to check in with him, see how he was doing.”
“Well it’s not as impressive as all those things you seemed to know about me at the club, but it wasn’t too shabby.” Sherlock smiled at this, and John had to temper the sudden swell in his chest at the sight. It was a nice smile, small and hesitant, as if he didn’t quite believe what he was hearing, but it seemed to reach his eyes, making him look younger, softer almost.
Meeting one final thrust, John’s body closer than he ever imagined possible, Sherlock tumbled over the edge. Vaguely he could hear himself calling out John’s name over and over again as the waves of unadulterated bliss washed over him and consumed him.
“Your friends who have been pining, head over heels for each other, are finally happy, isn’t that good enough for you?”
“Take me too him.” John demanded. Christ, he had been sitting there for over a half hour wallowing in self-pity because he thought he had been stood up, and all the while Sherlock was… He couldn’t think about that, he needed to get to Sherlock.
“He has to.”
“Arrangements for the continuation of your physical therapy regimen.”
“Nope! But I’ll make you a deal. You get that gorgeous arse up and in the shower, and I’ll go down and bring us some breakfast to eat up here.”
“Occasionally, rarely, but it’s been known to happen. Especially where you’re concerned,” Sherlock mumbled, feeling his cheeks flush. “So when you showed me the pictures of the hall and the dance floor, it’s because you want to…”
John smiles, delighted at the image of a young Sherlock running about his grandmother’s gardens, digging in the dirt and studying rocks and plants. “That’s lovely.”
“Oh, God,” John murmurs, “that was amazing.”
Sherlock exhales, grudgingly accepting his fate. “Fine. Just where is this top secret house?”
“I -- John --” Sherlock gave up, working his cock, letting himself be rocked into the mattress. His eyes closed, his mouth falling slightly open. John knew that look -- he was close.
“Suck me,” he pants breathlessly, “I need my cock in your mouth.”
“Very good,” Sherlock praised John when they completed several rotations around the rug. “Try to relax. Not so stiff this time.”
Sherlock found himself leaving his balcony door ajar in the sultry afternoons and at night, hoping John would understand the silent invitation to slip into his bedroom unannounced, to join him in bed, to take him, completely and willingly, however he wanted.
“John, this is hardly the time.” Sherlock bit his lower lip, wishing he hadn't said hard. “Tea…” he faltered as John's fingers worked open his belt and flies, his hand slipping down his pants, exploring, fondling.
Sherlock stepped closer, barefoot, smiling wickedly.
“Hm.”
“I’m fine,” he lied. “Just a bit tired.” He fervently wished his father would come down for breakfast to help distract his mother.
He dragged himself to his room and leafed through a chemistry text, feeling like he already knew it by heart. He stared out the window, wondering what John was doing.
Embarrassment streaks through John. “I just… It didn’t seem important enough. I didn’t want to bother you.”
John felt oddly grateful for Molly's honesty. “I'm pretty sure he thinks highly of you,” John reassured her. “I can't imagine he'd dance with just anybody.”
“I’m sure some hard evidence will rise up as we work.”
“That’s highly unusual,” Mycroft replies. “We have a number of security measures in place.”
“Probably broadcast, with a face like that,” John muttered, bothered that he couldn't place the man.
Sherlock looked closer, trying to read John's reaction, but John disengaged his hand, turning his face away.
The innuendo makes John’s skin tingle in anticipation.
It was the silence that caused him to turn around. No retort, no punchline from Sherlock. Instead, he had moved to his desk, his hands braced on the top, his head hanging down.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, his head snapping back in shock when John reached out to grasp the bottom edge of the netting gathered at his shoulders.
Without planning to, he cupped his hand over John’s crotch, palming his erection. John let out a huff of breath, and Sherlock slid his hand deeper between his legs, feeling the hard outline of what lay hidden beneath his clothes. John groaned, shifting his hips.
But yesterday, everything changed. Yesterday, John went with him on a case and got grazed by a bullet along his thigh, because he, the illustrious Sherlock Holmes, fucked up. He was careless and didn't see the signs that should have warned him of danger.
“You were the one innocent in all of this, of course. Just a baby…” he drifted off, sifting back through the years. “Your father was besotted with you. I was terrified of you. Tiny, needy thing. Then precocious as hell.” He gave me a small smile. “Despite everything, he was determined to give you as normal a life as possible.”
“A new case?”
“No, not really.”
Anthea straightened her back and took a deep breath. “I'm going over there and introducing myself.”
“I trust that you’re an ethical person,” Sherlock grudgingly admitted.
I did a double take, shocked that he was confiding in me. “Are you serious?”
He’s surprised to find himself looking forward to it, a calm Christmas Eve at home. It’s not normally something he would enjoy, but John will be there.
John looked at him quizzically, following Sherlock down the stairs.
“I can't. I've gotta --” John paused, his eyes drawn down the sweeping outline of the Belstaff coat. He stared, surprised. “Um… you're not wearing trousers.”
They discussed the merits of his system and the details of the case until Mycroft looked at his watch.
Mycroft shifts in his chair, pulls his phone from his breast pocket. “Now then, where shall we dine?”
People. With bodies. With John in a small exam room. Sherlock felt an irrational stab of jealousy, possessiveness -- a key scraped in the lock downstairs. Sherlock grabbed a random magazine, threw himself onto the sofa.
They finished up, putting away the gloves and netting and smoker.
*******************
Several weeks passed, the weather growing warmer and the days longer. John was tinkering with the Model T that he had parked in the shade near the garage, trying to find the source of a rattling noise his mother had complained about.
He heard the deep sigh of exhaustion, felt the exhalation tickle his ear. He struggled to say something, to turn and wake for this long awaited moment.
“I have to go,” John said reluctantly.
Sherlock often visited Molly now that she worked as a pathologist at St. Bart’s. She provided him with various specimens and let him examine corpses for clues, and he had subsequently charmed a few of her colleagues into letting him use the laboratory for some advanced experiments and analyses.
“Just his clothes. Ian -- I mean, Constable Dimmock, took the rest.” Molly blushed and quickly walked over to a cupboard.
“So are you.” John rolled onto his back, guiding Sherlock to straddle his hips.
I hope you enjoyed this summer escape. Go read CMBYN if you haven’t already, and support the film! I can’t wait to see it in January.
“I'm freezing.”
“What?” John straightens up in alarm and drops the tiles back onto the game board. “No one’s going down there.”
They lie in a tangle of sheets and limbs, the room scented with sex, their hearts beating rapidly. When they finally cool, John pulls a wrinkled sheet up to their shoulders. They turn to face each other, slotting their bodies together, hands drifting over arms and hips.
I have to admit, all those Startup gifs of Martin started to meld with the WTF Martin. No matter, both inspirations will work.
******************
John paused, the sound of their heavy breathing pulsing against the walls. He loosened his tie, removing the damned thing with a few agitated tugs, then rapidly unbuttoned his shirt, shrugging it off and onto the floor. He ran a thumb over Sherlock's cheekbone, fingers glazing down his long neck.
John turns and stares at him. “Did you see it? Can you smell that?”
John looks back at Sherlock, pulling him against him, brushing his lips across Sherlock’s. “I like it.”
Sherlock bristled. “My theory was quite sound. Clearly, there are no such things as ghosts. The only reasonable explanation involved an elaborate scheme perpetrated by a group of individuals united by—”
The husband’s eyes went unfocused, remembering. “I saw her once. Black hair all done up, green gown, mouth painted red… beautiful.”
“I don’t know anything about that. Useless.” After a moment, curiosity gets the better of him. “Who’s Orion?”
“I hope you know —” Sherlock starts abruptly, then stops. “You should know that I appreciate it, your help with these things.”
“Great, thanks,” John took the envelope and glanced at Sherlock, anxious to know what he was about to say. Sherlock’s expression was closed off, his eyes turned down toward the table.
“It's lovely,” he says, slipping an arm around her narrow shoulders. “Really lovely.”
He’s beautiful like this, creamy skin, long lashes casting shadows across his angular face, his lips slightly parted. Sherlock raises himself on his knees and grasps John’s cock, guiding it to his entrance. John holds his breath, still amazed at how it feels, slowly pressing into Sherlock’s body, sliding in.
“Lawrence of Arabia. It's a restored director’s cut. And it's in English.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It had happened so quickly that John still didn't have all the details filled in.
He picked up the last letter from Sherlock and re-read it, wistfulness flooding through him. He wished Sherlock had written more about where he'd traveled, why he'd taken up fencing, what his experiments were. All the little details were left out, leaving only the bare bones of the weeks and months that passed by, a skeleton outline.
“Really, John.” Sherlock chided.
Sherlock waves his hand loosely from the wrist. “Really, John, that’s not necessary.”
Sherlock can’t tear his eyes from the image, the dogtags dangling over John’s golden skin, his left shoulder unscarred. His smile is confident but not brash, his posture at ease, his body fit. He exudes an easy and commanding masculinity that pierces Sherlock’s defenses, penetrating into his deepest desires.
“You take that back.” I stepped forward menacingly.
“I love you,” John murmured again, almost giddy with relief at finally saying the words that had haunted him for years, “I'm yours. Completely yours.”
But John can’t ask him to stop doing the work. It’s what keeps Sherlock from self-destructing. And what keeps John going day after day in his mundane-by-comparison work is Liv, and ensuring that her life is as secure as it can be.
John took a breath, started to say something about not letting things go to waste, then stopped. He settled for a simple "Yes." He stirred, and they both watched the liquid gradually disappear into the grain.
, he scoffed to himself. He didn't even know what that was anymore. He'd been traveling around the world for ten years, dragging his cameras and a battered laptop from one hell hole to another, photographing war and famine and disaster.
“Yeah, I gathered that.” John sipped at his juice, wincing at the gingery burn.
“Excellent work,” Sherlock praised her offhandedly. He removed the lid of the box and sorted through a plaid shirt, lightweight jumper, and trousers. Nothing was left in the pockets. He pulled out a long grey scarf, running the soft wool through his fingers. A smile slowly curved up one corner of his mouth.
“I think so. Why?”
“Maybe it's improved since I last went. Surely there's some sort of action film playing.”
He searches his memory for any thread of a connection when he remembers the dream he had in the hospital — the beach transforming into a desert, a soldier standing on a high ridge. He was dressed like this, in a khaki uniform. What were the odds of dreaming that before coming here? But it’s just a coincidence. A very strange coincidence.
“Just catch the gunman so I can go home.”
He swung onto the bicycle and pedaled, enjoying the crunch of the gravel under the wheels. He turned onto the road and pumped his legs faster, finding joy in the speed and movement, a small taste of freedom.
John shifts in his seat, dying inside. “A smiley face. On my left arse cheek.”
“It's a bit like a museum, isn't it?” Mrs. Hudson ventured. “The gentleman who lives here is, er--” she paused, searching diplomatically for the right phrase, “a free thinker.”
Without opening his eyes, John knew it was morning. He could hear birds chirping, the heat from the rising sun starting to warm the room. He was almost awake, but drifted in semi-sleep for a little longer, remembering flashes of details from the night before.
“That's a shame,” Molly said quietly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hm. If the police don’t come up with anything, which they probably won’t, let me know. I have a little time on my hands.”
“Same.”
“No, nothing.”
“Good trip?”
“So how was the hiker killed?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock tilts his pelvis, drawing in the last inch, craving the low hum of John’s body pulsing inside of him. He relishes the sway of heavy balls against his skin, the breathy grunts as he moves his hips to meet John’s initial thrusts.
"I didn't. Not long, anyway." John was fibbing. He'd waited 30 minutes, fretted about the chicken getting too dry. But it had turned out a lovely golden brown, moist, flavorful. The potatoes were fluffy, buttery. The ubiquitous peas were sprinkled with fresh mint. A meal like this really was best shared.
“No, you were spot on. Brilliant.” The cocktail was kicking in, making his mood light. He propped his elbows on the table, tilting his head flirtatiously. “And what’s my story now?”
“So is it true?” John asked after a pause, lowering his voice. “What he said about the cocaine?”
That left John and Molly standing together.
He parted his lips, guiding the rosy crown into his eager mouth, the intimacy of salty, musky skin flooding his senses. His head was spinning, his lips and palette worshipping and praising the gorgeousness of Sherlock’s wet, pink cock, his hand coaxing, massaging him to plump, veiny beauty, his tongue lapping the tremulous beads of precome. Sherlock’s long fingers clutched into his hair, his soft moans growing more desperate.
Mrs. Watson sat across from him, sipping a cup of tea. “Could you go into town today? We need some things.” She slid a sheet of paper across the table. “You can take the car.”
Holmes laughed unexpectedly, curtly. “I’m getting philosophical. Never mind me.” He flicked ash to the side and looked up at the sky again. “You and Anthea… Are you together?”
John wanders the streets, oblivious to the Christmas lights and feathery flakes of snow falling. He considers stopping at a pub to get blind drunk, but he doesn’t feel like being near people. He’s not even sure he has enough money to get drunk.
His eyes locked with John’s as he straddled him. "I want to feel it everywhere, your beard."
We lived just outside of London near Aunt Harry, and on weekends Dad and I would often take the train into the city to do some shopping or see a film or try a new restaurant. I loved those long Saturdays, just strolling around and chatting with each other.
Sherlock nods and hands him the razor.
“Ah, God,” he gasped, gazing up through the dense branches, wanting to prolong the exquisite pleasure throbbing in his body. He felt it boil over, unable to hold back, coming hard and hot in John's throat.
Perhaps he would ride his bike by John's house tomorrow evening. He didn't want to appear too eager, but he didn't want to seem like he was avoiding him, either. How on earth did people manage these things?
John caught his breath. Gorgeous. Stunning. Speechless.
“Yeah, over a hundred years old, I’d say. You don’t often see real ones anymore. Must have willed their bodies to the hospital for science.”
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. “Dull. Where’s the drama in that?”
I added to my transgressions and lied to Dad, texting him that I was taking the train back with Emma and staying overnight at her place. I'd see him back at home tomorrow.
“Jesus, one time!” Sherlock shouted in exasperation. “It’ll never happen again.”
“Of course.” John licked his lips, finding the courage to say more. “I remember every detail of that summer. Every moment.”
John fell into bed, the ghostly imprint of the ring still whispering around his finger, but his hand felt lighter, free at last.
John glanced back again. It wasn’t obvious to him at all. “Okay, then what about that bloke, the man with the dog?” John nodded at a man walking a small dog along the pavement.
“I do,” Sherlock leans in a bit. “It suits you.”
He paused, now finding his mouth above John's waistband, at a crossroads. He could stop and stay in relatively safe territory, or press on, continuing to explore. He flicked his eyes down, noting the bulge in John's trousers that had become quite evident.
The room was warm, the faint sound of traffic floated through the window, a clock tolled the half hour, but they were unaware of time, touching and coaxing, stoking up an increasingly intense desire.
“So, John, do you think the earl and countess will approve?” He held out his arms to show off the fine cut of his suit.
John found himself smiling back, unable to resist the mirth in Sherlock's eyes. Disbelief, amazement, and relief collided in his chest, swirled up his throat, and escaped in a ragged laugh.
“Helping to solve crimes. Estimating time of death, suggesting cause of death, providing your general expertise in disease and injury. Skill with a revolver wouldn't hurt, either.”
Sherlock’s enthusiasm waned when he remembered John's family. “Your mother will worry if you don't come home.”
“Oh.”
He turned suddenly and entered a cafe, needing to warm up with a cup of tea and a sandwich before returning to his rented flat. For the first time in memory, there had been no family gathering at Musgrave Hall. His parents were away on a lengthy holiday, something they'd talked about doing for years, and he’d arranged to stay in London rather than rattle around home alone.
“John. Look at me,” Sherlock pleaded. “What's wrong?”
John’s phone buzzed a second time and he reluctantly pulled away. “I’ll see you tonight.”
“Good. Really good. Yours?”
“All of which are useless And did you know this house is supposedly haunted? My nurse is starting to think we have a resident ghost.”
They remained tangled together in an awkward embrace until it grew too uncomfortable. They shifted and Sherlock stood, gathering up his pyjamas and tying them into place. He vanished for a brief moment and returned with several folded canvas tarps. He arranged them on the floor, creating a makeshift bed. They nestled next to each other, hands resting on each other's legs.
He slowly slid his hand back up, ensnared the trouser button with his fingers, observing John. His face was flushed, his eyes slightly dazed, his expression expectant. Sherlock discovered he liked seeing John undone like this, enjoyed turning him to putty under his touch. He wanted to see more. Sensing he was about to set a rapid chain of events into motion, he slipped the button through its hole.
“And Mycroft?”
“An axe, maybe?” Sherlock offered. “Or a shovel?”
He can’t remember all the details of what happened. His last memory was of stepping out of a cab… going where? It was night, a cold rain had left puddles that reflected wavy streaks of neon light… a bar? Restaurant? He’d spoken to someone, then left, stepping out the back way into an alley, wrinkling his nose at the overwhelming odor of trash bins and piss. He turned at a sudden sound, then there was a flash of light, searing pain, blackness.
“Then we’ll stay. A little skiing, good food, a proper sauna and massage…”
I claimed I had a headache and wasn't feeling well when Dad found me later. I was pale and puffy eyed, sitting on an overstuffed chair in a study located off the main room. The other guests were departing, restoring some semblance of peace.
Sherlock fingered the cigarette case in his pocket. “Didn't really hit it off with anyone…”
“The dance is for young people. You should go.”
He was barefoot, mussy haired, sipping coffee and making eggs like any other Saturday morning at home. Sherlock was still resting, nowhere to be seen.
“No, I’m sure it wouldn’t,” Sherlock mutters, picking moodily at the book binding.
John stops, as if becoming aware of how hard he is gripping Sherlock's leg. He relaxes his hold but doesn't remove his hand, leaving an imprint that burns through the fabric into Sherlock's skin.
“Yes or no?” John murmured.
“I've decided something important,” Molly said more to herself than Sherlock. “I’m going to do it. I'm going to be a doctor.”
Sherlock grips his fingers into the tiles, the flicker of John’s tongue sending flashes of pleasure to his brain. He soon forgets his surroundings, consumed by licks and swirls, decadently slow, warm, and wet.
Sherlock noticed Mycroft's eyes traveling along the wall above the sofa that was covered with maps, notes, clippings, and photographs for a different case he was working on.
Ok, so take a deep breath... we're now in the Cave of Despair, which leads to the Forest of Pining. And after that, I'm happy to say, is the Golden Lake of Reunion.
John glanced at Sherlock. "It’s risotto."
Within moments, the area on his thigh grows warmer. Captain Watson leans closer.
He didn’t even know why he had come this year. He’d be heading off to Cambridge in the autumn; he could have stayed at home alone in England. But some sense of loyalty and duty had compelled him to make the annual journey with his parents. Or maybe it was a fear of loneliness.
“I was just at the lake with Ian.” She paused, her fingers gripping the handlebars. “We sort of broke up. So it's not a very good day.”
Sherlock was looking at him evenly. “Meaning what?”
“Okay, so those were the top cases. Anything else?” John asks as they walk into the bedroom and lift back the sheets.
I knew not to argue with that tone of voice.
I was mulling all this over as I turned the house key in the lock, wondering if I should ever introduce Dad to Matthew. Dad would probably fold his arms across his chest and frown at Matthew, tilting his head in a silent challenge, daring him to speak. I really didn't want to scare Matthew unnecessarily.
“He’s doing quite well,” his father said, sliding the conference brochure across the breakfast table to Sherlock, then vanishing behind his newspaper again.
“Did we? I'm always afraid I'll step on someone's feet,” Molly laughed. She turned her head, looking at the door where Sherlock had disappeared. “But Sherlock is such a good dancer, he made it seem easy.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock answered, his mood suddenly calm. He tucked the paper into his jacket pocket. “Small change of plans. Seems there’s been some water damage at the hotel. Broken pipe. Mycroft’s made other arrangements on our behalf.”
His gaze roved from Sherlock’s eyes to his mouth. “What are we going to do about it?” he murmured.
“No, I suppose not.” John curls his fingers over the top of a chair. They’re both standing by the table, John close enough to see droplets of water on Sherlock’s skin. “I went to the lab to look for you tonight.”
He sighed again, resigned to a summer of studying the stack of textbooks he'd slipped from the university library, taking solitary walks, and sneaking cigarettes far from the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you too. Since that summer. Always.”
Sherlock absorbed the information, thinking about how much of the world John might have a chance to see. In some ways he envied him, but the endless routines, strict authority, and crowded conditions of military life were far from enticing. “That's very ambitious.”
They rode, starting out slowly, then increasing in speed, laughing as they tried to race, weaving precariously close to each other. When their legs tired, they slowed again, breathing hard, the village far behind them.
Sherlock can smell John’s cologne, can feel his familiar presence. He thinks of their warm bed and soft sheets, the touch of John’s hands on his skin, the heat of his mouth on his body.
John tamped down the sudden surge of emotions that threatened to break through his composure. He couldn't talk about India without getting shaky, couldn't bear to hear the words
“Of me?”
“Don’t --” Sherlock cried out, ashamed, grabbing at John’s hand. “God, please stop.” He couldn’t bear to watch him do this, consume his sickness and depravity.
John takes a sip of tea, reflecting. “When I was overseas, I was surprised by how much I missed the city. I lived here when I trained at St. Bart’s, and I came back again when I was first shipped home from Afghanistan. Funny how you keep returning to the same things over and over.”
Sherlock’s fingers threaded through John’s hair as his lips moved lower, anointing his belly, grazing his navel and the fine line of dark hair that ran beneath it. Sherlock watched, mesmerized as John gathered his cock in his hand, flicking his eyes up in a sultry gaze as he guided the head to his lips.
They stand awkwardly in the doorway, then Sherlock shakes himself into action. “Well. Beggars can’t be choosers.” He strides into the room and peers into the attached bathroom, working off his gloves.
“You smell like cinnamon. And cloves.”
He gallantly held out his arm, and after a moment of surprise, Molly took it and he swept her off to the dance floor.
John threw off the bed sheet and sat up, agitated. There was no way he could sleep. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, scraping his hands through his hair in frustration. He gazed at the open  window, an idea seeping into his mind. It was close to midnight, the house silent. If he were to quietly sneak out, no one would know…
John undoes the top button of Sherlock’s shirt, taking his time, savoring the texture of soft cotton, the contrast of white fabric against Sherlock’s sun-kissed skin, the random pattern of freckles dusted across his forehead and cheekbones.
“That feels… amazing,” Sherlock managed to utter.
John’s brows drew together, and Sherlock extended his forearm, revealing a nicotine patch. “I used to smoke. Still do, some days. Long before that, I used to get high. We’re all just recovering from one thing or another.”
“Good coffee,” John added with a satisfied smile as he leaned back in his chair, finished.
“And you were quite helpful with my book, of course.” She stacked another pile of papers to the side. “So, your father and I thought you ought to be rewarded for all your efforts this summer.” She slid a slim packet across her desk. “We’d like to send you to London for a week.”
He scanned the evening sky, then his eye was caught by movement along the road that led to town. He made out one, then two bicyclists, one male, one female. He gradually recognized the young woman, Molly Hooper, a local girl a year or so younger than himself.
Even though it was summer, he still felt the pressure from university, the intensity to prove himself. His family wasn't wealthy, and his father, who had, in fact, been a doctor, had left the profession in less than good standing. John felt like he had to work twice as hard as the other students just to keep up. Of course, his own reckless nature -- late nights out carousing, a hot temper, a few drunken pub brawls, a string of jilted lovers -- didn't make things easier, either.
people anymore!” Moriarty said, eyes frantic, grin deranged.
“Right, so we simply delete the knowledge that we’ve had sex.”
“Christ, you’re a hard man to catch.” John said. His football training came in handy once again, and managed to catch Sherlock just outside the door.
“That was… spectacular.”
he told himself,
John was still smiling, he wasn’t annoyed. He was laughing even, teasing but in a nice way. Why wasn’t he fed up by now? Last year it only took the other kids ten minutes to make Sherlock an outsider.
So... comments? Corrections? :D
“This is excellent, John. I knew you’d see reason eventually.”  This was fantastic, in one fell swoop, Sherlock had avoided being imprisoned by Mycroft, and found a way to keep John around. “I will call Mrs. Hudson immediately to inform her.”
“Looks like it’s my turn to play hero” comes a familiar voice from behind him.
Lunch is coming to an end when he hears it, raised voices coming from a table off to his right.
“Well, tell me what you read.” John leaned in ever closer.
you've
“Really, you mark your boss with a GF before her name? I’m not an idiot. Though I must commend you, I didn’t read adulterer on you. It’s very rare I miss something like that, so congratulations.”
“As I said, I simply wanted to speak with you, Mr. Watson. One hundred and twenty-nine Fawndale Road, Jacobs.” The man said, addressing the driver – bodyguard – hit man – hired muscle.
No, he wasn’t in Afghanistan anymore. This was London, he was in London. He was in London, and there was an explosion. There was an explosion, and a house was on fire…The second man!
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes… Sherlock –” started John, only for Sherlock to cut him off.
“How do you know that’s the right carton?”
By the time he returned to his beige, boring little flat, John was exhausted. When he awoke that morning, he had no idea that the day would be so long, would take such intense and exciting turns, or be so draining. All John wanted to do was take a shower, re-dress his hands, and crawl into bed to sleep for the foreseeable future. But sleep would not come.
So you know how case files and human spleens put Sherlock in a good mood (and a non-bored Sherlock puts John in a good mood)? Well seeing lovely comments from even lovelier readers, puts me in a good mood. And when I'm in a good mood, I'm less inclined to re-write this story and do things to keep the boys apart or make them upset. You wouldn't want me to make John move out, would you?
“Shit, what’d you guys do? I mean, I saw his face, but…”
“Oh no, not until we get some real food in you. Last night’s dinner hardly even counted as a meal, and I’m going to need to keep your energy levels up.”
“Easy, Sargent,” Lestrade said sternly, cutting Sherlock off before he could say anything. “I invited him and I want him to have a look around.”
He didn’t know why, but seeing Sherlock take to the lessons made a strange sort of pride bubble up in John’s chest. It was probably just the feeling of good deed done. That had to be it, he was helping someone out, it felt nice, that’s all it was.
Really? Sherlock didn’t care if it was from ‘the soundtrack of the wedding’, the nineteen-nineties was a terrible decade for music. Though he could admit – never out loud – that some of the lyrics seemed rather apt.
“Sorry, consulting detective. When all that happens, we’ll find flat with two bedrooms so you can have your lab again. That sound good?” He hummed, leaning in to brush his lips against Sherlock’s. Sherlock may have been the genius of the couple, but John still knew he could render Sherlock powerless with a well-timed and well placed kiss.
John had to shake himself from his semi-trance “I’m sorry, what?”
*******
“I can absolutely see you doing that; scrawny little you with your wild hair, looking for anything suspicious.”
He heard footsteps, the floorboards of the hallway creaking, and then, “Sherlock?” John’s voice was soft, and Sherlock could see his outline in the doorway. “Hey, good, you’re awake. How are you feeling? How’s your pain?” He asked, moving into the room and turning on the corner lamp, a glass of water in his hand.
“You don’t seem very frightening.”
“If you say so.”
He was going to make sure his brother paid for this, Sherlock thought as he tugged on the bow tie currently chocking him. It was Mycroft’s fault he was at this ridiculous gala in the first place.
Sherlock's finally free of the hospital and John finally sees his new home.
John chuckled. The pretty blonde and her one friend were no longer
“Well now that you mention it,” Sherlock hummed, “you did get rather angry rather fast.”
“Told you you got a good one.” Molly mumbled, shooting Sherlock a look. “Hey John! It’s going well. I’d stay and chat, but I… um… I’m supposed to be meeting my friend Meena at the library.” She said, and with a wave, hurried off in the opposite direction of the library. Sherlock just rolled his eyes, if she got any more transparent, she’d be see-through.
“He left in such a hurry last week, and I haven’t seen him since.”
Sherlock reached out, his fingers curling around the back of McCall’s jacket, when the man whipped around and lunged. It happened in a matter of moments, Sherlock caught McCall by the upper arms, McCall struggled, tried to pull away, his eyes grew wide, his mouth opening in a silent gasp, his hands come up to grasp Sherlock by the elbows, and suddenly Sherlock felt an unpleasant swoop in his gut.

Under the guise of IT installing updates, Sherlock – with John acting as his assistant – had actually managed to install the patch on all but one of the computers. He was just putting the finishing touches on the last one, when an actual IT representative showed up, and they had to get out fast. Apparently when more than one officer in charge’s computer was rebooted within a certain time frame, an automatic alert was sent to IT and someone was sent to check for a power or network failure. Or in this case, an idiot university student and his enabler trying to gain access to murder investigations.
“There, isn't that more comfortable?” Condescension dripping from the man’s words. “Now, what is your connection with Sherlock Holmes?” The man now taking on a much more sinister demeanor.
“Oh you mean Emily. No, Emily isn’t my step-daughter, she’s my husband’s little sister. Well, not his actual little sister. Eric mentored her in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program when he doing his masters in social work, and she sort of just became part of the family.”
Perhaps it wasn’t a warm shower he needed to get to sleep after all, but a cold one.
“If you want to take a piss, you’ll get against the fucking wall!”
So lost was John in the all-consuming need to entangle himself with Sherlock, that it took far too long to register that Sherlock had started shaking in his arms.
Sherlock’s hand shot immediately to his head to find that his curls had indeed dried into a frizzy disaster. Oh, this meant war. With a near growl, he pushed John backwards to climb on top of him and pin him to the bed. “And tell me, exactly whose fault is it that my hair is in such a state?”
The blush deepened. “Well, maybe there was one or two other things.” Sherlock muttered. “I’m… I am sorry that I let my insecurities ruin the moment.”
“I don’t know about amazing,” Sherlock mumbled, the most endearing blush coloring his cheeks, “but yes, I’ve recently discovered that I do have one. That don’t mean I have any idea how it works, however. You’re the one who knows how this stuff is supposed to go.”
“Mummy always insists we spend Christmas at the house in Kent. She thinks the scenery is more ‘befitting the season’ than here in London. The second the calendar flips to December, it’s all Christmas carols, eggnog, and decorations. I’ve never met a grown woman who gets as excited for Christmas as my mother, and father only ever indulges her.” He would never admit it out loud, but he too was rather fond of Christmas, everything decked out in decorations, everything but the tree that is. The tree was to be trimmed on Christmas Eve and never a moment sooner.
John snorted. “Pretty sure I know what siblings I have, and I’ve only ever had a sister.” A genuine smile finally crossing his face after all the forced ones during Mrs. Hudson’s questioning.
“He might not have charged his phone, Sherlock. You know how he lets the battery run out.” Molly said calmly, as Sherlock fidgeted with his silent phone. She had a point; it wasn’t uncommon to see John charging his phone during class, having forgotten to plug it in the night before.
“Yes, John – it’s – perfect – I love it – I love you.”
“I don’t even know if you even want me here after everything. Well tough,” John sniffed, “I’m going to stay right where I am. If you want me gone, you’re just going to have to wake up and tell me to go… Wake up, please wake up.”
“I wouldn’t say that. Why did you want to know?”
“Are you two, you know… together?”
“Yeah, how’d you know?”
“I know all, John.” Sherlock winked.
“Oh wait, but we don’t need it for that.” He quickly added when he finally caught Mike’s meaning. “I told you before, Sherlock and I, we’re not like that. Really.” God, if only they were like that. What he wouldn’t give for them to be like that. “We’re just friends.”
“What is it?”
“Well,” John laughed, “if I’m going to be seen with you, I figured I should look like I’m at least halfway deserving of having you on my arm. Or being on your arm, whichever you prefer.”
“You can do good here. People get hurt and sick in London all the time.”
“This conversation is over, Graham!” Enough was enough, Sherlock didn’t think he could stomach that smug little smile spreading across Lestrade’s face, and stormed off towards the cold case files.
So, next chapter is the epilogue where we catch up and see if these two were correct when they dreamed of a happy future together!
“I’ve already had a cup.” John said, nodding towards the empty mug on the coffee table. “Sherlock, Love, you need to calm down. What is going on?”
“Just that you’ve hardly been in. You’ve always dashed about, but… oh, I don’t know… you seem more unsettled than usual.” Mrs. Hudson sighed.
“Nonsense, I want too.” Theo smirked. Had he always been so smarmy? “So, your partner, eh? I had heard something through the Uni grapevine you still do that little prying into people’s lives trick, and were some sort of amateur detective now. Didn’t take you for type to work with a partner, though. Guess you need a buffer to keep you away from the normal people, yeah?” Theo’s laugh cut through Sherlock, just like it did all those years ago…
“And that’s a bad thing?”
“I’m sorry, but that’s part of an ongoing police investigation, and we’re not making any public statements at this time.”
“Mr. Thursday Night?” Sherlock frowned, looking to John for answers. Christ he was cute when he was confused, that little crease forming between his furrowed brows.
“Hmmm, I think I can definitely work with that.” John managed to say, right before Sherlock reclaimed his mouth.
“Alright, well as I was saying, William thought grade two looked way more fun, so he decided to skip right on up to join us!” the cheery teacher continued, turning back to the class. She seemed nice enough, she kind of reminded him of his mummy the way she smiled at him. “Is there anything you want to tell us about yourself, William?”
Ones in the past. John had been involved with men in the past.
“There is a lot of damage to the left shoulder.” The surgeon continued. “The muscles are torn, and the scapula was shattered. We had to use metal plates to realign and hold the bone in place. He’ll need physical therapy.”
Thoughts of John filled Sherlock’s mind. Days were spent focused on finding new leads, sussing out the genuine calls and messages, from the useless. At night, Sherlock dreamed only of John, at least nights when he actually managed to sleep, or rather when he passed out from exhaustion. It wouldn’t have been so bad if they were actually dreams, but more often than not, what little sleep he got was plagued with nightmares.  Sometimes when he’d close his eyes, it was John’s body the police had dragged from the Thames. His body riddled with cuts and bruises, track marks running up his arms, all signs of living on the streets. The empty shell of John’s broken body haunting Sherlock, asking why Sherlock abandon him, why he wasn’t faster, better, why he couldn’t save him. Other times he’d relieve their last night together, but John would pull away from their kisses, laughing, taunting Sherlock.  John would tell Sherlock that he disgusted him, that he could never be interested in someone like Sherlock, in ‘the freak.’ John never wanted to see him again, Sherlock was the reason John left, was the reason John was in danger. But very rarely, perhaps only once or twice, Sherlock dreamed of the future, a bright future where John was happy and safe and by his side. John was the doctor he’d always dreamed he’d be, and Sherlock was solving crimes full time. They’d run through the streets, and fall into bed at night to wake in each other’s arms. Those were the dreams from which he never wanted to wake. He always awoke with a sense of hope, only to realize he was alone, slumped over his desk, or occasionally in his bed, his arms empty, and he ached.
“Well, I guess we probably shouldn’t be just standing around here.” John chuckled nervously after a bit, breaking the awkward silence that had fallen between them. Nervous? Why was he feeling nervous? He’d done stuff like this before, gone to the gym after hours.
“I could do that… But I don’t want to.” Moriarty smirked. “Besides I need you to
– this is amazing.”
“You and me both! I certainly feel more comfortable in jeans and a jumper.” John laughed.
John watches as Sherlock sweeps around the office, examining the victims desk. His movements far too graceful, reminding John of the other ways in which Sherlock’s body can move. Lost in his thoughts, John doesn't realize Lestrade has joined them, or that Sherlock has started talking again. Quickly clearing his mind, John focuses on Sherlock’s words.
“Oh good, you’re awake!” said Nurse Leah, sounding far too chipper. “I was hoping you’d wake up before shift change.”
“I’d prefer the firing squad!” John called over the music. “This really isn’t my idea of a night out anymore, Bill.”
“Arsehole!” John called after the man just as the man disappeared into a dilapidated looking abandoned house. Shaking it off, and gripping his cane tighter, John had just started walking again when there were shouts for him to “Move, move. Get out of the way!”, and a second man came racing past him, his long coat billowing behind him like a cape as he followed the first man into the house.
“What gives you the right to do this?! To touch him like this?... Hmm?... This sickening nonsense is beneath Sherlock Holmes, and yet you insist on trying to make him
John grinned and shifted forward so that his head rested on Sherlock’s pillow. “Oh, I don’t know about that,” he murmured, running his fingers over the cool metal band encircling the forth finger on Sherlock’s left hand, “I think some do. Some even come with a reward.”
“Hello John.” Sherlock said, cocking his head to the side.
Alright, it was seven twenty-eight and John’s shift at the hospital ended at seven o’clock. If he took a shower – if he took a shower? Of course John was going to take a shower – and if traffic patterns held steady, then John would be arriving home in exactly thirteen minutes. Just thirteen minutes.
Oh excellent. Still, if this was his life now, making tea and looking over case files, John thought, he might as well make the most of it. It might even be fun.
“Oh, so you must be the young man Sherlock’s told me absolutely nothing about.” The woman – Mrs. Hudson – said, looking pointedly at Sherlock.
Let go. I’ve got you. I'm here, I’ve got you, gorgeous. You can let go.”
“You’re the one who brought up hobbits!”
“Yes.” The kid – Sherlock – said, sounding curt, if a bit weary.
Sherlock smirked. “I already have.”
of my friends. That means my team and my best friend. Besides, it’s not like you’re going to be the only non player, plenty of other friends will be there too. Girlfriends, boyfriends, you name it.”
“Oh we’re going to be extremely busy.” Sherlock murmured. He had already undone both their ties, and was starting on the top buttons of John’s shirt. “There’s a reason they call it a sex holiday.”
“You never? Not even with…”
“I think I do. And tell me, why is it that you’re the one in charge? Why are you dictating where, when, and how far we run? It’s my recovery, shouldn’t I be calling the shots?”
“Good, good.” Meredith smiled again. Sherlock made a mental note to make sure whoever his next physical therapist was, he or she was not going to smile so much. “Once your therapist feels comfortable enough with your progress, you will then move onto the third and final stage of recovery, which is only a few sessions a week instead of everyday. Your therapist will discuss what they think is best when the time comes. Again, this can take place at your home, or in an out-patient facility. Personally, I would recommend going to the facility for stage three, patients who get out and about tend to do better than those who remain cooped up.”
So distracted was John by keeping his thoughts and body under control, that he let his hold loosen and Sherlock was able to turn out of his grasp. The next thing John knew, his legs were out from under him, and he was flat on his back, pinned to the ground by his wrists with Sherlock straddling his waist and looming over him.
“Because someone you care about is heading into possible danger,” John yells. “God Sherlock, this is not how I wanted this to go.” He says with a sad laugh, looking to the ceiling in an attempt to compose himself.
“My test. You still haven’t given me my test back, that was the whole reason I agreed to talk to you.” Sherlock smirk.
“What? No, why? Don’t you want to have sex with me?” John hardly ever stopped him before. He could count on his fingers the number of times John turned him down for sex; and all those times involved illness, injury, extreme sleep deprivation, or a high probability of them being arrested for public indecency.
“No, I’m Groom One, you’re Groom A.” John murmured back. “I want to hear what she has to say, you never know with Harry.” Mr. and Mrs. Holmes had already given a little speech on Sherlock’s behalf and welcomed John to the family, and now it was Harry’s turn.
“Not at all, darling.” Mrs. Holmes beamed, grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling her son to her side. “John was just telling me all about his plans for his summer at Bart’s.”
“You don’t have to prove anything.” Sherlock breathed, one hand cupping John’s cheek as he leaned forward.
As if in slow motion, John watched as the nurse pulled the breathing tube from Sherlock’s throat, and with one final buck, Sherlock collapse back onto his bed, back into unconsciousness.
No, no arguments.” John groaned, the hand that was formally pumping them, now clutched the headboard in an attempt to keep himself from collapsing onto Sherlock, Sherlock wasn’t too sure he would have minded if John had. John’s other hand snaked under Sherlock head to tangle in his curls. Pulling his head back, John kissed and nipped at Sherlock’s throat, before eventually recapturing his mouth in a wet, rough kiss.
“Honestly, the way he talks to me, you’d think this was my first robbery.” Sherlock muttered as he moved to follow Lestrade
“Gladly.” Sherlock hums before recapturing John’s mouth. “Or better yet, where’s your flat, and I’ll show you.”
First Heather, now Lestrade; not to mention the looks and little comments Mrs. Hudson has taken to dropping. What was making everyone assume there was something more going on between him and John?
Sherlock bit his lip to keep from smiling “If you’re sure.”
– and I most certainly do.”
“That’s why… That’s why I need… I need to make sure.”
“Comfy?” he asked, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and one of Sherlock’s around his shoulders to keep the lanky lug from falling off.
“And that has anything to do with you, how?” Sherlock asked.
“Ow! Careful, John!” Sherlock snapped just as they were taking the last step up onto the landing.
“Just ignore them,” John groaned, “They’re clearly already drunk.”
“No tea; the only thing you ‘just need’ is some sleep in an actual bed. It’s nearly half eleven anyway.”
“I’m only ridiculous because you made me ridiculous.”
“You really don’t need to do that, it’s alright.” More than alright, but John couldn’t say that.
“But there isn’t even an investigation!” Sherlock interjected.
didn't
“You know,” Sherlock said when the eventually broke apart, “if there was one good thing about this whole ordeal, it’s that I got you out of it.”
“Oh but you are. Your heart, your mind, your eyes,” John said, touching and kissing Sherlock as he spoke. “Your nose” he kissed the tip of his nose. “Your cheeks,” he kissed his cheek. “And your lips.” He said, finally kissing Sherlock’s lips again. “Are so beautiful. You are so, so beautiful, and you are all mine.”
– oh GOD! – YES –
“Is this your way of saying you want me to go?” Sherlock asked, cocking an eyebrow.
“Looks can be deceiving.”
“Oh entirely. You should have spoken up ages ago.”
“Oh… you’re awake.”
“Well those are different clothes, but by the looks of you, clearly sleep did not go along with the fresh outfit.”
John was gobsmacked, he felt undeserving of such praise. All he had done was befriend Sherlock, and it wasn’t even like it was difficult. Was Sherlock really so lonely? He obviously had people who cared about him. Yeah, Sherlock was a bit odd, and definitely prickly, but who wasn’t odd in some way. And it wasn’t like John was particularly known of his warm and sunny disposition. What could he offer Sherlock, that someone else couldn’t? Sure they had clicked – far faster than John had ‘clicked’ with any of his other mates or… – and the comradery between them was easy, but that was it. John really wasn’t that special.
A month after that first meeting, and John was just about at his wit’s end. Sherlock was still not responding to him, and John was fed up with him refusing his help. He still had one last trick up his sleeve, and though he didn’t really want to play it, it had to be done.
Just the epilogue to go, so now would be a great time to head on down to the comment section and leave me a comment and/or correction. (I crave validation!)
The night wasn’t too cold, and with his leg no longer bothering him, John decided to walk a ways before catching the Tube. So lost was he in thoughts of the day, he and Sherlock never did settle that social media stalking debate, that he almost failed to notice several phones start to ring, only to stop again as he walked past. It wasn’t until the fourth or fifth phone went off that John decided to hell with it, and answered.
“Oh don’t act so surprised.” She laughed “I’m Sherlock’s mother, you don’t think I know my own son? I hear the way he talks about you. I see the way he blushes and his eyes light up when your name comes up. Over Christmas he was smiling at his phone, and texting
Right, that was enough about that.
“That all depends on what you’re asking me. Do I mind you using my shower? No. Do I mind you going to take a shower, thereby leaving the comforts and confines of my bed? Then, yes. I mind very much.”
He could feel another part of him breaking. “Mummy… please.” Sherlock said, his voice almost inaudible. After finding John’s phone, for it only to give them nothing, Sherlock needed to stay moving, had to keep active.
Enjoy!
As it turned out, reviewing the evidence ended up being more engaging than Sherlock had anticipated. He became so engrossed while comparing the victims’ toxicology reports, that he failed to notice the hush that fell over the normally busy office. It was only a pair of familiar arms wrapping around his waist, and a pair of lips he’d recognize anywhere kissing the side of his neck, that pulled him from compounds and chemical formulas. Grinning, Sherlock turned around and was met with a sight that stole his breath and stopped his heart. There standing before him, a smile spread across his face, was John in his full RAMC dress uniform, complete with dark blue beret, white gloves, and all his various medals and insignia. He looked… he looked stunning.
“Oh, I think I have some idea,” John replied, a small part of him still unable to believe what he was hearing, “because for the last three months, every time I’ve so much as looked at you I’ve imagined what it would be like to grab you and kiss that ridiculously posh mouth of yours until you’re out of ridiculously posh breath.” Feeling unbelievably bold, John punctuated his point by running his thumb along Sherlock’s plush bottom lip.
Not thirteen minutes after setting off, the cab pulled up to the curb outside of 221 Baker Street. Not bothering to wait for the cab to stop completely, Sherlock tossed the driver double the fare as he promised, and hurried through the front door. Standing in the foyer, Sherlock could hear the sound of muffled conversation coming from upstairs in the flat. Well, at least they hadn’t left already, he hadn’t missed them entirely, Sherlock thought as he made his way up to the flat.
“You know, I got myself a good one too.” John said once everyone had gone back to their conversations, and Lestrade had joined Molly and Mrs. Hudson. “And I’m the only one in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes, so I think I’m actually the real winner here.” He added, threading his fingers through Sherlock’s, and lifting their joined hands to his lips, kissing Sherlock’s knuckles. It was amazing how different their hands were, yet they still fit together perfectly, almost as if they were two pieces of a puzzle, destined to fit together. John blushed even thinking about it; destined to fit, it was ridiculous, but it felt true.
gorgeous love.”
John was honestly a little worried that things would feel awkward once he arrived at the library. With the semi-interrogation he got in the locker room, how could it not be awkward? But the second he laid eye on Sherlock, and Sherlock smiled at him and kicked out a chair across from him, everything else – the team, the questions – just melted away. They had a blackmailer to catch.
“Like he’s for your eyes only.”
“And where exactly is the husband?” Sherlock asked.
“Your clearly bisexual fellow medical student, with a healing ability, and plays some sport with Lestrade.”
“But the point is that he
“Oh, shame. That sounded like fun too.”
“John?” he said finally, turning on his side once John had finished and settled back in bed, pulling the covers over them.
That seemed to brighten John’s spirits. “Nah, whatever you pick is fine with me. Just don’t put the spleen anywhere near the food.”
Mycroft lets out an annoyed breath. “I don’t have time for your little genealogy hobby, Sherlock.”
John liked this place very much and didn’t want to leave just yet. “You do owe me a favor, so yes.”
Sherlock dove under again, popping up next to John, then dunking him with a swift push. John bobbed up spluttering, his hair dripping into his eyes. “You wanker!”
The muscles in John's arm and shoulders flexed as he hewed through a thick limb, the sinewy ridge of his spine visible under his tanned skin. His body was solid, his wide shoulders tapering to trim hips that swayed with every deep thrust and pull of the saw.
John held his gaze, a tension rippling between them that made it hard to breathe. Sherlock was aware of John's eyes flicking down to his mouth, then back up.
Sherlock peers at the corpse of a man in his late 20s, scrutinizing the bruises covering the left side of the body. The marks are long, thin, and purple, crisscrossing the skin.
“I paid him extra not to talk.”
His work frequently brought him to St. Bart's Hospital, sometimes to question the living, more often to inspect the dead. He had found a niche as a consulting detective, a profession he'd invented himself.
The journey had been subdued, the compartment filling with several businessmen engrossed in newspapers and a pair of middle-aged ladies who vanished behind thick novels.
His chest hurts, but it’s not from his injury. It’s heartache. He stands up, wanting to alleviate his pain. He goes to the shower in the adjoining bathroom. The lights aren’t working here either, but a faint glow from the fireplace filters into the room though the open door.
Sherlock stares at Mycroft. “And you haven’t denied it?”
Sherlock glances up and John knows he can tell exactly what he’s thinking.
“I know.” He took a breath. “I’m sorry.” He placed his tea cup back into the saucer with a rattle. “I didn’t see it coming.”
They are alone, the lights are off in Sherlock's bedroom. This is the first time they’ve undressed completely, allowing for an unrushed and thorough exploration of each other's bodies.
They really should be out investigating the murder they'd driven halfway across the country for. They were in a tiny village in a tiny room rented from a half-deaf landlady, but the bed was large, covered with soft quilts and pillows. There was probably a razor to be had somewhere within 30 miles, but after three days, it seemed pointless.
John woke hours later, momentarily at a loss. He quickly remembered and rolled over, wanting to touch Sherlock again. The bedsheets and pillow were rumpled, the bed empty. John's brows drew together in consternation, wondering if Sherlock climbing in bed next to him was just another dream.
Sherlock’s muscle tense at the kiss, an initial alarm that gives way to a shaky exhalation, a gradual melting into John’s chest, a word of gratitude slipping from his lips. “John…”
“And how long will that be?”
Sherlock hadn’t felt like this since… Christ, he didn’t think he’d ever felt like this, the tense heat coiling in his abdomen so strong it was like nothing he’d felt before. It had never felt this… good, before. His hands were moving everywhere, they were cupping John’s jaw, keeping his mouth securely on his own; they slid down his chest and around his shoulders where he brushed over the uneven skin of a scar, earning a shiver and moan from the man on top of him.
"It’s up to you, I honestly couldn’t care less,” Sherlock wasn’t sure he was even going to eat, this lunch was purely for John’s benefit. “Though I would suggest you pick somewhere with a more casual dress code, I fear my current outfit would be frowned upon at some better establishments.” He was wearing track pants and a t-shirt he hadn’t worn since university; he coat could only cover so much. “If you do want to go somewhere more upscale, I guess we could head back to Baker Street and I could change.”
“Fantastic.” John should be more bothered by Sherlock recounting his career ending injury, but he couldn’t help it, it was simply fantastic.
“Really?”
“You booked us a room with one bed!” It wasn’t like they hadn’t shared a bed before, but all those times were for a case, and this time…
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well aren’t you?” John said, glowering up defiantly at Sherlock. “You said it yourself yesterday morning: you got what you wanted, I got what I wanted, and now we can part as satisfied strangers? Your words, Sherlock.”
“Quite –
“Because you’re not a wealthy man.”
“No, your house is fine.” No such luck. “I’ll hang out until your mum gets home, I’ve been meaning to thank her for… umm… uh, for keeping me updated.”
“Oh thank you dear, but that’s alright, you boys go ahead.”
Like I've said in all the previous chapters, I loves me some comments and corrections :D
In captivity, John faces his kidnapper's questions, and sees how far he'll go for answers.
That’s the thing about fate and luck, they have a nasty habit of turning when you least expect it. John is happier than he has ever been in his life, and by the looks of it, so is Sherlock. But happiness can always run out.
“John… that was… ehem… that was…” Sherlock stumbled, after he appeared to have finally got his breath back.
doesn't
“Ok, I think we’ve tortured Sherlock long enough. I can practically hear him sulking from here.” Mr. Watson said loudly, pulling the curtain open again.
hasn't
Interesting story. There's a hot pot restaurant where I live, right next to a suntanning place. There are some sketchy people who go in and out of the suntanning salon, and my friends and I have a running joke that it's a front for some illegal dealings. Now that I think about it, I really hope it's not human trafficking!
(P.S. That moon bees article is real, I was so happy when I found it!)
“Yep, I really, really love kissing you, and so I really like my lips being able to actually feel when they’re kissing yours.”
“I guess I have a blind spot when it comes to you.” Sherlock mumbled. “I didn’t want to get my hopes up.”
John snorted. “There’s gullible and then there’s believing that a secret society of red-heads exists, and by helping them archive ‘ginger history’, he could get a date with that actress from those galaxy superhero movies.”
“Mr. Holmes, sir,” Butler ignored Sherlock’s outburst, “I have the report from the officer who spoke to John Watson’s father, George Watson. Everything here says that John ran away. Your son is clearly upset, but I don’t see what else we can tell him.”
Oh this was not going to end well for him, John knew it; that smile, it… did things to him.
“As well as to be expected. I found that the A positive samples respond much quicker to saliva than the other blood types, but the response time is temperature dependent. I need some more equipment to visualize it more accurately, though.”
Part of him didn’t want to hear how Sherlock knew he was no longer affianced, didn’t want thoughts of her intruding on
He knew John couldn’t hear him – John was already fast asleep – but Sherlock had to say it, he had to get it out.
John smiles to himself before replying.
“I said I was fine.” Sherlock scowled. “And even if I weren’t, I would turn to an actual medical professional, not just someone
Not even bothering to knock, Sherlock burst through the door – it was open a crack anyway, so it’s not like John would have minded. “Good, you’re here.”
“Oh definitely,” John agreed, knowing exactly where Sherlock was going… and loving it.
“I didn’t want to get in your way, I didn’t want to impose.” He didn’t want John to see the effect his playing had on him.
Hope you all are still liking this thing!
“Starving.”
“Really? I’m not crippled?” Sherlock spat. “I have not been rendered unable to walk, to move properly? I have not sustained severe and disabling damage? I have not been deprived of the ability to function normally?”
“Yes, yes, I know.” Sherlock groaned. It took normal people several months to recover, but Sherlock was always quicker to heal than
A case!
John was not going to say he told him so, but he knew a suit was a ridiculous outfit to wear home from hospital.
“But he woke up.” John repeated. He needed the confirmation, he had to know.
“Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. We were told Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were brought here… Oh Katherine! Where are they? Where’s my Sherlock?”
*******
“Actually yes, I think I know just the place.” Sherlock grinned. “The owner owes me a favor.”
John closed his eyes for a moment, then letting out a deep sigh, dove right into the story of meeting, getting stuck with, and getting to know Sherlock, leaving out the more lurid details of course. Sarah was kind, understanding, and let John talk, listening to everything he said. It felt good, almost cathartic, getting it all off his chest, and not just the stuff he bitched to Bill about.
Once he finished dressing, John left the bedroom to find his discarded coat and gloves, and caught sight of the rest of the flat. Sherlock’s warning was clearly warranted. The kitchen – off of which the bedroom was – looked more appropriate for cooking meth than cooking food. The table was covered end to end with lab equipment, and stacks of petri dishes growing all manner of things, John didn’t want to look too closely. The sitting room wasn’t much better, though stacks of papers and books, instead of organic matter, covered a desk, one of two arm chairs, the floor around a couch, and a coffee table. The décor was… interesting, a touch macabre, with  a cow skull wearing earphones hung on one wall, a framed picture of a skull hung on another, while a human skull sat on the mantel next to a daggers stabbing several letters. The man did like his skulls.
Mycroft cut in, looking at Sherlock once again like he was still the little boy who wanted live in his ‘Pirates Hideout’ in the trees.
I probably should have mentioned this before, but I'm American, and this was not Brit-picked. I've done my best to use British terminology since our boys are British, but please forgive me if I slip up. (Oh, and I write the word 'ass' on purpose because I think there's nothing more pretentious sounding than an American saying 'arse', and I include an American writing it)
“Messy?” John frowned. “Why do you want something messy?”
John wasn’t sure how long he stood there stock still, stirring at the empty air when his best friend had just been, it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, when he heard it, the earsplitting shriek of a man yelling. As if struck by lightning, he was off, running faster than he’d thought possible towards the ledge.
Nevertheless, university life offered some degree of freedom and intellectual stimulation. Being forced to return to the family estate under a cloud of disgrace was humiliating.
The wind moans around the house, the damp scent of rain in the air. Somewhere outside an agent is stationed to keep watch over the house, probably huddling in his car with a thermos of hot tea, cursing his bad luck for drawing such a boring assignment.
He could feel John gazing at him, waiting breathlessly.
“Molly…”
They had been visiting Sherlock’s parents for Christmas and were driving back to London when a thick fog set in, the type of dense fog that made the road slick in the near-freezing temperature.
By the third pint they'd grown more introspective, the silences longer but comfortable. The pub had filled up with patrons and was loud with raucous laughter and a hubbub of voices, making it more difficult to talk.
“Drugs aren’t an easy habit to break,” John cautioned, recalling several case studies on addiction.
“I’d like to see your bedroom,” John murmurs.
“You too, Sherlock. Merry Christmas.”
John finally settled his scattered thoughts and focused on the strong hands of the masseuse. It felt good being touched. It had been a long time since he'd been physically close with anyone. Somewhere along the way he'd stopped dating, realigning his life to match Sherlock’s. It happened so gradually that he hadn't really noticed how much he'd changed since he moved in with Sherlock.
John leaned a fraction closer. “We could wait,” he let his knee touch Sherlock's beneath the table, “but why?
The kiss is soft but not shy, an offering that John gives to Sherlock with the promise of more if he wants it.
He should go. This would be a mistake, trying to salvage a remnant of friendship from their past. Sherlock had made it clear long ago that he wanted nothing to do with him. And John didn't blame him.
Sherlock gasps, visibly offended, and John relents.
John chanced another flirtation. “That’s the idea.”
******************
“Yes. I doubt anyone else here is qualified.”
“You need more protein. Eat your bacon.”
John lifted up on his toes to place a lingering kiss on Sherlock’s lips, smiling as he spoke a wicked thought out loud. “This velvet feels so nice… I think you ought to wear it when I have you spread out on our bed tonight.”
And some lovely
“So do I,” John added darkly.
“Shall we go?”
“Sherlock--” John interrupted, “come here.”
Sherlock turns to John and grins. “I knew I was forgetting something.”
It’s Christmas Eve, he remembers, skeleton staff. People at home with their families eating traditional dinners, opening presents, arguing bitterly and storming off to their rooms -- or maybe that was just his family.
John pressed against Sherlock’s groin, pleased to find him equally aroused. They staggered back against the worktable, mauling each other with mouths and tongues and roaming hands.
“He’ll see you now, Mr. Holmes,” the man said. “But not him.” He looked pointedly at John.
John wandered over to a bookshelf to peruse the titles. Sherlock watched him for several moments, his hands in his pockets.
Their hands. Their foreheads.
His fingers relayed to him a profound sadness, a loneliness that was like a deep ache. He paused, Sherlock's shallow breath and rapid pulse offering a flutter of restrained hope, the beating wings of desire and fear.
Somewhere along the way that curious little boy had calloused over into an arrogant man, contemptuous, brilliant, isolated.
HIKER FOUND DEAD
Sherlock reluctantly placed the square of paper into his palm.
John took a closer look, noting that it appeared less swollen and would heal in a matter of days. “I advise against boxing for a few weeks.”
John shook his head, his mouth a tight line. He finally spoke, his shoulders hunched. “Maybe it's not a good idea. To keep seeing each other.”
“I'll have one of those,” I finally said, breaking the silence.
John was still watching him. “You're a natural talent. I envy you.”
By the time the service ended and guests were milling around to offer their condolences to the family, I had figured out who Sherlock’s brother was (tall, thin, sharp eyes and nose under a receding hairline, elegant suit) and who their mother was (silver hair pulled back, slash of fuschia lipstick, jangly bracelets and large rings, loud voice, maneuvering through the guests like a determined battleship dressed in black).
The moment is crystalline, a delicate filament strung between them, one that John doesn’t want to break. He moves his mouth to Sherlock’s other shoulder, leaving a tender caress before taking a small step back, sliding his hands away.
Next to Sherlock, he felt a little underdressed. Sherlock looked impeccable, turning heads as he glided through the breakfast room to their table. Of course, John had seen him slouching around the flat in his pajamas and dressing gown, or looking much rougher, strung out, unshaven, or laid up in a hospital bed, pale and weak. No matter the circumstances, Sherlock was always the most handsome -- no,
Even though they had been living together for several months, they had studiously avoided seeing each other in any state of undress, closed doors and tightly belted dressing gowns ensuring their almost Victorian modesty. Seeing Sherlock naked after so many years was a revelation, his body fully matured and hardened, lean and whiplike.
As Sherlock rinsed the razor, John set his mug aside then rose to his feet. He nestled behind Sherlock, looping his arms around his waist, just wanting to hold him. He rested his cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder, feeling Sherlock relax into his embrace.
John stood in the entryway of 221b, the metal keys cold in his hand. He had walked to the flat, shivering in his jacket, his hair still wet.
Sherlock breathed in a waft of cumin, coconut milk, chiles, and turmeric. “Hm?” He asked distractedly.
When he reaches the landing, he swallows and hopes for the best. He enters the sitting room and flicks on the light. The room is relatively neat, the kitchen sink empty, the scent of lemon dish soap in the air. He breathes a sigh of relief. Mrs. Hudson, bless her heart, must have tidied up earlier.
So did his thighs, John thought privately.
And yet he'd said it himself -- they were only here for the summer, which was racing by. All too soon they'd be parting, going off to different lives.
”I want to trust you,” John says tersely.
John is crouching by the fireplace about to add more wood. He straightens when he sees Sherlock’s wild expression and bare chest expanding with rapid breaths.
“Sherlock, this is Molly. Guess what?”
Sherlock tucked himself back into his clothes, trying to regain his poise. John soon rejoined him, suit jacket on.
“You didn't pack something more… casual?”
Aunt Harry didn’t answer right away, and I thought for a moment she didn’t hear me. But she finally spoke. “They have… a unique relationship.”
The pang returned as Sherlock undressed, the bathroom tiles slicked with moisture, the cold December air that seeped through the ill-fitting windowpanes mixing with the warm steam from the bath.
“John…” Sherlock sighs his name, melting under John’s weight as they sink entangled to the floor, John’s mouth worshiping his neck. He curves a hand over John’s arse, smiling to himself, remembering the tattoo, knowing he’ll see it very, very soon.
John nodded stiffly. They made their way back down the stairs to another door that Mrs. Hudson opened. She entered first, flicking on a lamp in the gathering dusk. John looked around as Mrs. Hudson plumped a pillow and straightened a curtain, then fussed with a little statue of a dog on a bookshelf.
Sherlock straightened his shoulders defensively. Was everyone going to be dropping innuendos all evening? “You're the one who suggested that I should get a flatmate.”
“I’ll call tomorrow,” John answers distractedly, tapping out a reply.
“Private,” Sherlock answers. “It could be private.”
“John --” Sherlock choked out a warning, overwhelmed, peaking, ready to fall into the abyss, “God, oh --”
I realized we hadn't really talked in a long time. I missed him.
“Yes, sir. They asked specifically for you. You can take it in the library.”
He couldn't stay in the house anymore. He would ride to town, get a drink, stop by the book store, pretend not to look for John.
Sherlock furrowed his brow but closed his eyes, the light was hurting them anyways.
“I want to shower,” Sherlock said. John could feel him shivering, still nestled between his legs. His hand absentmindedly gripping John’s ankle. When did that happen?
John was surprised when he actually found Sherlock sitting in pajama bottoms on his bed.
“Lestrade is sure he’s found a clue at the last abduction site. Wants us to have a look.” Sherlock said not looking up from his phone.
John leaned over Sherlock, light fingers parting hair and gently searching out the damage he knew was there. He grimaced as he revealed the oozing gash.
They wrestled with each other until John rushed Sherlock into the far wall. Sherlock let out a choked noise and released John’s wrists. He sagged forward, his forehead landing on John’s shoulder. The metallic scent of blood filled John’s nostrils and Sherlock softly panting for air filled his ears.
But today the soft chiming of Sherlock’s phone somewhere in the flat interrupted the dense silence. Sherlock slid off his stool and wandered towards his room. His blue robe hanging low on his shoulders revealing pale white skin. John looked away.
He was curious though, no one ever really called Sherlock. Anyone with his number knew better. That’s when the shouting and running and leaving John behind happened.
'Dammit’ John sighed heavily.
“Could have just come along, no need to sulk about it. Although I suppose if, as you say, it doesn’t interest you anymore then-oof” John threw the shirt at Sherlock's face.
“Nothing.” Sherlock said as he grabbed the pill off the table and swallowed it dry.
John had been blankly staring at the tv screen for the past 3 hours. Image after image flitted past his eyes but he absorbed none of it. It was raining outside. The rain pattered against the glass in a dull thrum. To John it was the loudest noise he’d ever heard. His ears were numb with the roar of it.
“Jesus! Relax it’s just me mate.” John said shaking Sherlock’s hand off so he could reach for the first aid kit he had laid out on the tub’s ledge.
“Only me.” Sherlock smiled, before rushing down the stairs at the sound of a horn beeping, no doubt from the cab waiting to pick him up outside.
"What's Sherlock done this time?" Mrs Hudson said following behind him and walking straight into the kitchen to make tea.
He let out a groan as a cold cloth was wiped across his face and neck.
'You know what? Get stuffed. I could.’ John snatched his mug from the counter and stormed into his room to sulk.
“You’re dizzy.” John stated.
Sherlock hummed as he felt dull nails gently scraping at his scalp again and let himself be pulled back into sleep.
Sherlock swiped his hand at the trickle of blood making its way down his neck, his hand came away red and he grimaced. “John…” he rasped.
“Where on earth –” John is stunned, pleased, suddenly grinning like a fool as he reaches out to touch the green branches. “You carried this halfway across the city?”
Sherlock smiled, sitting on a low wall. “You know that’s what they call you, Maria and the others.”
“I had to see you,” John confessed against Sherlock's neck that smelled of the white smoke used to lull the bees. John licked his skin, wanting to taste it. He wanted to taste every inch of Sherlock's body, wanted to explore him like a bee delving into the hollow of a flower.
He released the pressure on Sherlock's wrists, slid his palms over his shoulders, down to cradle his sides. John trailed his mouth down Sherlock's sternum to the warm skin of his stomach, his lips tracing the crescent curve of rib cage.
They drive to a park and find a grassy slope under an oak tree. John spreads out a blanket and produces a bag filled with sandwiches, crisps, and several bottles of beer.
Sherlock does a cursory swipe over the paws and abandons the towel on the kitchen floor. He pulls John against him, sliding his cold hands around his back. “Tetchy,” he teases.
That had been nearly two years ago. Now, John is enjoying a much-needed holiday in Spain. He'd started out in Barcelona for several obligatory conference days, then traveled to meet Sherlock in this not-overly-touristy town along the coast.
John met his eyes, knowing Sherlock was describing their own acrimonious relationship. But now the schism between them was shifting and changing, narrowing. ‘Types like us,’ Sherlock had said. Thrillseekers forced to channel their impulses into safer avenues. They were more alike than he’d ever imagined.
Sherlock draws back slightly, slowly opens his eyes to gaze at John. “Husband,” he murmurs, still getting used to saying the word. He likes it. Loves it.
“It stung him to death.”
“The two of you --” I stopped, not sure how to say it delicately.
He is answered with a tentative touch, a hand laid lightly on his back, just below his shoulder blade, cool at first, then warming.
They fit together perfectly, giving, receiving, fucking in a dreamlike state. John pictured how they would look from below, surreal, two pale figures framed by the window, clasped together, moving in tandem in the shadows, silent but for their ragged breaths.
“Well, now,” Mrs. Hudson said, “I’ll show you the room that would be yours first, then the main flat.”
For a split second, the easy smile of the brown-haired young man on the bicycle flashed through his mind. People were drawn to someone like that, confident and good-looking. He bit at his thumbnail, suddenly curious to know who the stranger was.
John could feel Sherlock's cool gaze on him, and he was suddenly aware of the dirt staining his knees and the sweat that dampened his shirt. He gripped his gloves in one hand.
The band began tuning up, and a ripple of excitement swept through the room. John glanced around at the eager faces, noticing how young the crowd looked. He couldn't help note that women outnumbered men. Apart from the chaperones and ladies serving refreshments, he was on the older side of the attendees, A few of the men who looked to be in their 20s were marked by the war -- a missing arm, a limp, an eye patch.
Somewhere deep in his cells he remembers this, a sense of peace and belonging, a feeling he didn’t think was possible until it was rekindled just now. Strange to think how this feeling has always been there, waiting to be unlocked by John. How many times have they met through the centuries? How many were fleeting encounters cut short by war or illness or societal boundaries? Have they ever been granted a lifetime together?
Sherlock filled him in on his parents, Maria, all of whom were well, then sketched out his advanced coursework in archaeological chemistry. “It’s a bit of a specialty,” he explained, already seeing the question on John’s face. “It’s applying analytical chemistry to artifacts -- pottery, bones, textiles -- to determine what vessels held, what people ate, patterns of trade... I’m boring you.”
“That's good,” Sherlock offered, still not sure why he'd been summoned.
Septic shock, Sherlock can’t help himself from deducing, leading to organ failure. Antibiotics didn’t exist at the time.
“Don't forget your shoulder.” Sherlock's voice was muffled, his face lowered through the padded opening of the massage table.
Sherlock grimaces, then does his best impersonation of polite interest.
“You really have to get past your fear of the dark,” Mycroft intoned.
Sherlock was moving his game piece into the ballroom where the revolver lay. I was curious about something.
“Ah, there you are.” Sherlock sweeps into the room, sees John standing by the well-stocked table. He frowns, noticing the chill in the room. “Bit cold in here.”
John nods, both relieved and ashamed that Sherlock knows his weakness. He would try to do better, would try to control his irrational thoughts and be the steady partner Sherlock needs.
John repeats the words to himself, clenches his fists, then forces his hands to relax. He squares his shoulders and continues to follow Sherlock down the dim hallway, a well-worn rug muffling their footsteps.
A breeze skims across his feet and calves and he feels the presence behind him. He knows what it is this time, and he is ready. He shifts his gaze in the mirror and sees the apparition standing just behind his shoulder.
John raised an eyebrow. “Doing what?”
He waits until he fully regains his composure, then returns to the kitchen to continue his work at the microscope. He shifts in his chair, refusing to look at John, his eyes trained on the specimen slide. A temporary glitch, that’s all it was, a surprise seeing John bare-chested in his kit like that. It’s under control now. It won’t happen again.
John’s hand reflexively went to his face. “Most people seem to like it.”
“You saw her, right? The woman?” John asks with a mix of disbelief and triumph.
The train finally came to a stop and the jostling began, everyone eager to be on their way. They emerged onto the platform, pausing for a moment to get their bearings.
Life had gone on, impervious to parted lovers.
“I’ve always wondered why you left the army.” Sherlock stabbed his fork through the golden crust of a hearty slice of apple pie. “Was it your shoulder injury?”
John sat beside him on the pebbly shore, his blue shirt open, his green swimming trunks on. Sherlock felt exposed, his pale chest naked. He made the preemptive strike. “How’s your book coming along?”
I was about to look away when another movement caught my eye. Framed in the oval mirror, I saw their hands twining together, clasped low near their hips, intended to be out of view. Sherlock’s thumb glided over the back of Dad’s hand, caressing his skin. They stood still for another moment, then reluctantly separated in a slow tangle of fingers.
After dinner, his father was mixing a drink at the small bar just off the patio, catching Sherlock as he walked by.
Sherlock's expression didn't change. “No, I don't.”
“Oh, sure. They’re ready, I just haven’t had a chance to enter them into the system yet.”
His cock is stiff against John’s and they move, hips grinding and mouths seeking. John's fingers wind into Sherlock’s hair, pulling just hard enough to make Sherlock dig his nails responsively into John's shoulders.
John hesitated, not sure why she couldn't do it herself. “I could drive you there.”
John, with gloriously rumpled hair, was wrapped haphazardly in the white bed sheet, clearly naked underneath. “Oh,” John waved dismissively at his choice of garment, “couldn’t find my dressing gown.” He craned his neck forward, eyeing the food. “Is that for me?”
John smiles to himself, amazed at how easily those words fall from their tongues now. He settles his head into the pillow and is soon lulled to sleep.
“It was twins,” John interrupted. “As I proposed very early on in the case.” He looked pointedly at Sherlock. “Her long-lost sister took revenge on the husband, who wasn’t a very nice man, on behalf of her identical twin sister. A DNA test provided the evidence.”
“Make me some tea, then.”
They found a cafe and ordered gin and tonics, settling back to watch people passing by.
I really needed to write something light and fluffy. Thanks to one-thousand-leaves for the idea!
He toyed absently with a lock of Sherlock's hair, his eyes on the window. It was late, after midnight.
Sherlock breathes in sharply at the touch. It’s unexpected, but not unwelcome. Something in him stirs, a faint memory — the weight of his hand, the golden hair on his forearm, those indigo eyes. He melts into the moment, the air heavy with possibility. His body heats in response, filing with desire, blood rushing to his groin.
“That was uncalled for,” Sherlock pouts, covering his privates defensively.
Sherlock slid down against the arm of the sofa, finding himself sinking beneath John’s warm weight. His body hummed, the anticipation of hands and mouths on bare skin flashing through his mind. “Afterwards… whatever you want.”
Wonder what the Fox Trot looks like? Here's a lovely overview of
“I want you,” John gasps between urgent kisses, fumbling at the remaining buttons, their hearts and bodies radiating desire like the sun.
“That’s was delicious,” John murmurs, his lips on Sherlock’s forehead.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “The same. But worse.”
“Your friend John. Bit late to be ringing someone up. Must be important.”
He turned off the taps and stood for a moment, his hair dripping, his lashes beaded with water.
“I would never hurt you. Or Olivia. I would never do that,” his voice is shaky with emotion.
He crawled into bed to read the letter, his eyes widening at John's intimate confessions, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. The smile wavered as he finished, his head listing against the wall, the letter falling into his lap. Every fiber of his body ached for John.
It’s Christmas Eve and he’s glad for the quiet. No family arguments, no raucous parties, no unwanted visitors or social obligations. Just him. Mrs. Hudson is away visiting an old friend for a few days and Sherlock is… wherever he is. Probably the lab at St. Bart’s. John checks his watch, wondering if he might be back soon. Not that it matters.
Mrs. Holmes lightly tapped the edge of her saucer with a fingertip, a habit that Sherlock knew all too well. It meant he was going to get a lecture.
“Yes, you always have.” She tapped her cheek with the pen. “You once nearly set the house on fire while experimenting with a chemistry set when you were seven,” she mused.
***********************
Fifty-seven days had passed since he'd last seen Sherlock, longer than the promised month of separation. He had heard nothing during all that time, and had started giving up hope, spending far too much time drinking moodily in the bar.
“Sherlock…” John dared to extend a hand, wrapping Sherlock's fingers in his own. “I want that too, but how?”
His own hair has gone almost completely grey. He needs reading glasses and his shoulder aches in cold weather. Time rolls on and there's nothing they can do about it.
“John… I'm a fool. I'm reckless, inconsiderate, an insufferable arse. I've taken you for granted.” Sherlock paused, took a breath. “But the truth is… you are my anchor. And I don't want to lose you because of my stupidity.”
The summer heat was a living thing, palpitating, shimmering, relentless. Afternoons were devoted to listless napping or half-hearted reading in the shade of the pine trees near the pool, sometimes watching grainy television while lying stomach-down on the sofa under the apathetic ceiling fan.
“Your lip -- how is it?” John ventured.
They walk to Angelo's and are seated at their usual table. They order Chianti and penne.
Sherlock’s mouth briefly forms a petulant frown, and John kisses it away.
My family seemed to be made of secrets. There was my mother, of course, whose shadowy existence I wanted to keep at a distance. If she didn't want to think about me, I didn't want to think about her.
Molly smiled. “No, I suppose not.”
“The expert can teach you,” Dad grumbled.
He gazes at the circular shape soaked into the floorboards. Probably just oil from a lamp spilled decades ago. Highly unlikely that blood would leave such a permanent stain. However, if the wood was soft like pine, perhaps the porosity would create such an effect… He wishes he could pry up a sliver of wood to analyze in the lab.
John’s trails his fingers over Sherlock’s cheek. “I’ve been roaming this house for a hundred years, feeding off regret and misery. But you gave me a second chance to make things right.” He cups Sherlock’s face, tilting it up, the fire light flickering over his features. “I want to tell you something that I should have said long ago. I love you.”
And now, the heat of John's lips so close to his own, Sherlock slowly opened his eyes, found his bearings when his gaze met John's. Time moved thickly like honey dripping from a spoon, golden firelight playing across John's features, his dark blue eyes deepened with flecks of silver.
“I think they need each other,” I simply said, leaving it at that.
I guess I look more like my dad than my mother, who I've only seen in a few photographs. I squint at myself in the mirror sometimes, and I see an average girl with shoulder length hair, skinny shoulders, and an odd nose that I hope I grow into.
Sherlock had contacted Olivia, barely back from her travels, to drive John home -- only that didn't happen. Instead, he and Olivia ended up having a serious chat while smoking stale cigarettes on the rooftop. An important revelation came to light, and now he has to tell John.
He tried to tune out the rapid-fire clacking of the keyboard as Sherlock typed, making him aware of his own slow hunt-and-peck style. Dammit, did Sherlock have to do everything better?
Marry me
“Yes -- quickly! There. Good. Just relax. You're in control.”
Oh, Sherlock’s mouth felt so good, his long fingers splayed against his back, the skin of his neck fragrant. This impossible moment was happening, their lips roaming, tasting, the phone number printed on John’s hand completely forgotten.
He would rest his eyes for a few minutes, then get back to work. Just a short nap was all he needed…
“Neither of us can stay here,” John murmurs.
John lifts his gaze to Sherlock, not angry, not embarrassed, not flustered. Something closer to sorrow is in his eyes. “Don't be,” he says softly, then looks down again. “I should… I should go. Liv --”
“That blue cotton shirt you always wore. I stole it from you before I left Rome.”
Sherlock could only raise a hand in farewell, amazed that John seemed to be unsettled by the last few minutes as well.
They exchange a long look, testing each other, neither one willing to glance away first. Then Sherlock feels it, the charge and crackle in the air, the smolder of attraction. His lips curve up, a hint of a devilish smile.
Sherlock can't bring himself to tell John everything he wants to. He's terrified of ruining the friendship they have if John doesn't feel the same way. Best to keep silent.
“No, nothing unusual,” Hannah answers cheerfully. “Everything’s right as rain.”
John's stomach does a little flip of dread. He doesn't want to do it. “Actually, I am feeling a bit peaky. Maybe I'll just… sit down.” He turns and walks back down the hallway to the staircase, wanting nothing more than a strong drink in his hand. He had seen several liquor bottles in the library earlier.
For any history buffs out there, I based John's injury on events that happened around 1930 in the North West Territory. I took a lot of liberties, but the British Army was building roads in that area and there were some skirmishes. I also looked at obituaries from the Times of India to figure out what Mary might have died of. Pneumonia actually caused quite a few deaths among younger people. I think I spend more time researching odd bits than writing!
John opened and closed his mouth, speechless for a few moments. “But when would we leave? Where would we stay?”
He looped the towel behind his back, absorbing the last chilly rivulets. He hung up the towel to dry, then pulled on his blue dressing gown, the cool, silky fabric kissing across his skin.
The sitting room had been transformed -- the fireplace mantle had been wrapped in fairy lights and green garland, more twinkling lights framed the windows, ornaments hung from every nook and cranny, fresh sprigs of pine and berries sprouted from vases, and a sprig of mistletoe dangled from the door leading to the kitchen. A low fire burned in the fireplace, bathing the room in warm light.
“Oh?” Sherlock keeps his eyes on his book, expecting a dull story.
“Well, I played the clarinet at school.”
They drift into silence again, and he fingers the softness of John's shirt. One of his knuckles unintentionally brushes John's nipple, and it hardens, visible through the white fabric. He pauses.
Sherlock’s mouth curved up. “That would be an excellent start.”
John makes a small grunt in protest, sleepily flexes his toes against the long, cold feet stealing his heat.
I threw my backpack over my shoulder and walked toward the house along a flagstone path. The door opened before I even reached the steps.
“I suppose you did it on your own, not waiting for the police.”
In case you didn't know, Victor Trevor's dog biting Sherlock's ankle and the month-long holiday together is ACD canon ('The Adventure of the Gloria Scott'), as is, of course, John marrying Mary Morstan. I took the description of Mary's wedding dress from a real 1920s wedding announcement in a local newspaper. I wish there had been a photo of it.
“I try to be,” she smiled, squeezing his hand briefly. “Oh -- guess who I saw this morning at the bakery? Ian Dimmock,” she said without waiting for Sherlock to answer.
Sherlock took the spoon and dipped it into the thick liquid, quickly bringing it to his mouth before the honey could drip away. A golden burst of sweetness coated his tongue, floral and herbal notes shimmering through.
After dinner, Sherlock strolled outside to the glasshouse where he knew he couldn't be seen from the main house. He sat with his back against the exterior wall that faced toward the hives and dug the last cigarette from his case. He lit it, noting he now had a good excuse to go into town tomorrow to buy more. He watched the smoke curl up from the end, his thoughts slowly dissipating.
“And tomorrow morning?”
He had just set the cup on Sherlock’s desk when he arrived.
Sherlock gazed up at him. “Then it's the longest night.
“Hell, yes,” Sherlock affirms sleepily. A few moments later he opens one eye. “What about you?” He glances down at John's lower half.
That was his problem, always wanting something else, never feeling that what he had was enough. He was restless, even though Mary spoke of returning to England in a few years, settling in a nice village, perhaps starting a family. The prospect was more terrifying than appealing, his life narrowing to a predictable pinpoint. While a small part of him sought stability, a larger part craved excitement and the unknown.
I quickly glance out the window, checking for the cab I’d called earlier. It hasn’t arrived yet, but I notice fat snowflakes drifting down from the grey sky. I watch the snow fall for a few moments, wishing we could just stay at home, start a fire, maybe watch an old movie.
Time was slipping by too fast, Sherlock thought, sand sifting through their fingers as they tried to squeeze out every moment and slow it.
John smirks in understanding. “Always the adventurer.” He kisses the corner of Sherlock’s mouth and fades away.
Truth be told, he felt nervous about seeing John again, worried that he would come off as an arse. At least Molly would be there. She had a way of putting everyone at ease.
Sherlock stares at his milky tea. “That’s not going to happen.”
He twists, nearly loosening Sherlock’s hold, but his grip is strong. They wrestle, huffing out short laughs and grunts, rolling in the snow, roughhousing like two Huskies vying for the role of alpha dog.
Well, he was mistaken.
Sherlock looked up, momentarily confused. “Are you sure it’s not for my father?
Sherlock took a deep pull from his cigarette and exhaled the smoke in a long stream. He flicked ash to the side. “I'm thinking of retiring.”
He shakes his head, afraid his voice will crack if he speaks.
Sherlock accepted it, rubbing at his wet hair, finally settling the towel around his shoulders. John was watching him, standing close, still amused.
Another rap on the door sent them springing apart, smoothing waistcoats and hair. John returned to the desk while Sherlock answered the door. It was the maid, Elizabeth.
Needing something to do with his hands, John pulled the flask from his jacket pocket, unscrewed the top, and took a pull, then offered it to Sherlock. Sherlock followed suit, grimacing a bit as he swallowed the burning whiskey.
He was able to glean little about John’s background. “I’m from the West Coast. Not the sunny part,” John had said cryptically, then changed the subject, asking about Sherlock’s plans of study at Cambridge.
This is going terribly. Sherlock tries to make John understand one more time. “I'm just suggesting… you and Olivia might be better off without me complicating things. And you might be happier with someone… less volatile.”
Sherlock gives him a small push on his chest, then regrets it when pain shoots up his arm.
John holds Sherlock’s hips, his pelvis flexing in and out, the slow grind gradually building into a sharp, staccato rhythm. The glassware in the cupboard above Sherlock’s head rattles and chimes enthusiastically with every thrust, a sound that imprints itself on Sherlock’s memory.
“Where's the fun in that?” Sherlock smiled ruefully. “Besides, you weren't there to help.”
Sherlock snorted, nearly spitting out a mouthful of coffee.
Smiles played on their lips, the fence a barrier between them, the possibility of eyes on them restraining their exchange.
John smiled, relief flooding his face. He looked younger as he burrowed into Sherlock's arms, his morning beard rough against Sherlock's cheek.
***************
The scraping and banging continues. It’s coming from his room. Sherlock puts one foot on the bottom step, but Hannah clutches at his hand.
“Yes, it is.” She tilted her chin up. “Ian is nice, but I've got my studies to concentrate on. Besides, he's not the one for me. I'm not planning to stay here the rest of my life.”
“Uh, yeah,” John smiles as he wheels the shorter skeleton out of the storage room, following Molly as she pushes the taller one. Sherlock walks beside John, and they share another meaningful look.
“Sorry it's a wreck… I'm not here much.”
When Sherlock finally surfaced back to the present, Molly was talking about the story that would be in all the papers. “What do you think the headline will say? ‘Man Bashed by Boomerang’?”
“Sure.” John didn't mind the thought of having him alone for a few minutes. "Follow me." He led his guest to an inner courtyard where the music was muffled to a dull roar.
He looks up at John. “Did you bring it?”
“I could use some help. Our car’s on the blink, and I promised to run an errand for my mother. Think you could give me a lift?”
Mike’s mouth turned up in amusement. “That's exactly what my friend said.”
Sherlock could see John's glance at them in turn as if watching a tennis match.
Sherlock is awake, his gaze fixed on the ceiling. The curtains are drawn and he doesn’t know how long he’s been asleep or whether it’s day or night.
Sherlock's mouth was warm, a soft fumble laced with whiskey. John tilted his head, welcoming the second inexpert kiss, and the next, and the next.
They folded into the corner of the sofa, mouths delving together before their backsides even touched the leather cushions.
The corner of John’s mouth lifted. “Still not sure I trust them.” He wiped his hands on his trousers. “Have you seen Molly?”
“Now we’re even,” John says with satisfaction, brushing white flakes from Sherlock’s shoulders.
Highly aware of Sherlock sitting just a few feet away, John closed his eyes for a moment, recalling the night they had spent in his bed. They had come so close to fucking -- that sounded so crude, but a more delicate term didn’t come to mind -- but hadn’t. He sensed Sherlock wanted to, but something had held him back.
“It was nothing. Just two young blokes messing around with me… sort of… proposing a threesome…”
That night, John lay in his bed, unable to sleep, his mind drifting back to Sherlock and the ski instructor/thief. It wasn't the first time he'd wondered about the sexual habits of Sherlock Holmes. He thought about it far too often, in fact. Some days he was convinced that ice ran through Sherlock's veins, no human emotions or urges swaying him from his work. Other times he swore he glimpsed a flicker of heat in his eyes, a spark that hinted at a passion simmering beneath his cool exterior.
“The police don’t listen. Most of them are idiots.” Sherlock settles back into his chair. “Would that bother you, having clients in and out?”
“It's a quarter turn to the left with each half box,” Sherlock explained, and John glanced at him with alarm.
“I have a contact who provides them. The, uh, spare bedroom is just up those stairs,” Sherlock adds, hoping John isn’t put off by the grisly images.
Sherlock crouched down, arranging the kindling and a few smaller logs in the fire pit. He rummaged in his pocket, finding his lighter. He flicked it open and struck a flame, shielding it with his hand as he lowered it to the kindling. He watched it catch and burn, orange flames licking and curling at the wood.
John's left hand seemed to rise on its own, fingertips cradling Sherlock's jaw, his thumb caressing once over Sherlock’s bottom lip, stopping beneath the fleshy middle, tilting Sherlock's chin down a fraction and to the side.
Sherlock glanced at John, who was staring boldly back at Mycroft.
John plucked a blade of grass and studied it. “That's why I like medicine. We can stop death, or at least delay it.”
“It’s fine. It's… nice.”
John folded the paper again, amused. “For a genius, you’re really not very imaginative.”
John was willing to be swayed by his pleas and took Sherlock by the hand, leading him to his bedroom. They climbed under the covers, instantly wrapping around each other, kissing throats and jaws and collarbones.
“Oh, I don’t know,” she pushed the rice around on her plate with wooden chopsticks. “I suppose if I met the right person I’d consider it.”
Sherlock takes a breath. “I promise to call you if I need anything,” he says, unable to admit anything more out loud.
I sneaked a glance at him. He’d told me about patients who’d broken their own thumbs by keeping them wrapped inside their fingers when they threw a punch. He called them fucking amateurs. He sometimes swore in front of me, which was thrilling. “Yes, I remembered.”
“But London drew you back.”
Sherlock took a small step closer, wanting to bring John back into his orbit. “When can I see you?” His voice was low and urgent. “I need to see you.”
After they'd cleaned up a bit, Sherlock led John to the library where they settled in for tea. Left alone at last, Sherlock slumped in his chair and stretched out his legs with a groan.
