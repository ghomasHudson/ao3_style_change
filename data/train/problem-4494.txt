Dean got up and grabbed some clothes and his dead man’s robe and headed to the kitchen. Sam followed him halfway before turning towards the bathroom.
Sam began to thrust into Dean, feeling his warmth squeeze his cock. He didn’t wait to build up a rhythm, instead Sam began hard and fast. Taking what was his, pounding into his brother’s tight pussy, making Dean scream out. Sam quickly muffled him with a kiss.
Cas and Sam looked down. The air was heavy with tension, it clung with awkwardness. Neither one of them knew how to say what they were thinking. Confessions of attraction and even love moved to the front of their minds, not daring to be spoken.
Nervously, he reached a delicate hand into his boxers, and felt the heat come off of his new body. Running a finger along the wetness he let out a small gasp.
Dean made his way back to his bedroom and got dressed. It was annoying not having any clothes that fit him. No point in making a trip into a larger town to find some clothes that fit his new body properly, Rowena would be here the day after next. He elected for a pair of dark grey sweatpants, one with a drawstring so he could tie it up tightly, and an old Zepp t-shirt.
The witch gazed at Dean, her eyes exploring his female body. She couldn’t help but let her mind wander, curious as to what he looked like without the shirt on. Rowena was more than aware of the effects the curse had on those around Dean. She had always found Dean attractive and had wondered what he would be like in bed.
“I’ll talk to my friends and get back here tomorrow with a map,” he declared and looked around, not knowing what else to say. “How do I find you?”
“I meant right now,” Castiel explained. “But thank you for coming to Oak Mill, too. Especially knowing how you feel about this place.”
“Hey!” Dean threw her a dirty look. “Instead of laughing at me you could’ve helped!” Jo stuck out her tongue.
it boy, you are linked with this tree, it already tasted your blood. And that makes the offering a lot more
“You could nap at my place,” Cas suggested without looking at him, wiping maple syrup from his plate with the last strawberry piece.
He felt Castiel’s chest shifting as the man sighed. “The Heart died, destroying the creature. I think it almost killed me. And the forest lost its soul, the trees are
Jo took them to the fair, and they all had so much food they could barely move afterwards. Dean absolutely couldn’t look at caramel apples any more, and even pie wasn’t as appealing as it usually was. He still managed to drink the mead Jo ordered for them, sharing it with Cas, even while he complained that there should be a spell to make their stomachs bigger on the inside. There wasn’t, unfortunately, and Charlie suspected it would probably end up being a horrible curse anyway.
Cas and Jo didn’t seem to be affected the same way, making Dean wondered if he imagined all of it. Maybe his brain just couldn’t cope with all the new information any more and he started hallucinating? He could ask if they felt something, but maybe it was better not to know, and he decided to leave it.
Cas was smirking. He’d definitely heard the hungry bear cubs. “I’ll have pancakes with maple syrup and strawberries. And also coffee. Actually, could you just leave us the whole pot?”
Ash nodded with the most solemn expression Dean had ever seen on his face. “I suppose that’s fair. Haven’t really talked with anyone about this... development. Turns out ghosts tend to stick together and keep to themselves, you know? But hey, you’re here, so let’s talk. Anyway, this is my girlfriend Victoria. We met at the cemetery a few months ago,” he said, like it was the most natural thing.
Cas tenses for a second and then sighs, scowling at his plate. “It all came back to me,” he says. “The flood. It was the angels who caused it. They couldn’t stand that I gave humans so much. They killed everyone out of spite and left me there alone as a punishment.” His eyes are on Dean again. “They would allow me to come back to Heaven if I found my grace, but why would I ever want to go back there? After what they did, it wasn’t my home anymore.”
Cas didn’t dignify that with an answer, marching straight for the zipline. Dean could either stand there alone like an idiot or tag along and stop whining. He rocked on his feet a few times, and then followed Castiel with a groan. “Fine, have it your way.”
The morning brought a sudden change to Dean’s point of view. He had to be losing his mind after all, because as soon as he woke up, his neck stiff from the too-hard bed, living with Castiel didn’t sound that bad anymore. It wasn’t like having a housemate was uncommon, even if those housemates usually weren’t magical beings. Who knows, maybe having company would actually be good for him. He could at least try it for a few days, see how it would feel. Hopefully he wasn’t going to regret it.
“I’m sorry, okay?” Dean said. “You called when I was unconscious.” That probably wasn’t the best way to start explaining the situation.
For the next few days Dean was not only avoiding talking to Benny, but also to Charlie and Jo. He knew he was acting like a child, but it didn’t make him stop, it just made him angry with himself. That damned accident happened almost two decades ago and it still was affecting his life, almost like a fresh wound. Why couldn’t he just get over it?
Dean felt his stomach drop. “We have to stop him,” he declared, standing up and distractedly putting away the papers he was reading.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean finally decided what he wanted for breakfast, and took out eggs, closing the fridge door. “So what’s this hunt?”
“No problem.” Dean didn’t know what to do with his hands, a warm feeling rising in his chest. It was ridiculous. He knew the guy for merely two days, not to mention the said guy was an intruder in his house. Everything could only go downhill from there. Fucking imaginary friends with their blue eyes, messy hair, and elaborate tattoos.
Castiel’s gaze, his eyes half-closed and thoughts unfocused, lazily followed a bunch of dandelion seeds floating in the air. It was nice not to think about anything specific, just bask in the sun and enjoy the day. The summer was coming to an end and it was probably one of the last warm days before the fall, so he and Hannah decided to take advantage of it, spending the afternoon in the park.
Benny looked like it took him a second to understand what she was talking about. “Of course. Here are your keys. Rooms nineteen and fifteen. Up the stairs and on the left.”
The leviathan shuddered, collapsing into itself. Dean felt a surge of excitement running through his body, despite what was happening to Cas. They were going to win, he could see that now. Soon everything that was left of the leviathan was a wet puddle of slime on the floor and black splashes on the walls. Dean turned with a smile to Cas, but it fell as soon as he saw Cas slumped against the wall, his eyes half closed. He was still bleeding.
After that, they had met again sometime later, and Dean had asked Cas out. Just a few dates had left him with a feeling that he wanted the thing they had to last forever. And then Cas had disappeared for almost three months, sailing to some country halfway around the world. Dean had realized that if he wanted their relationship to last, it would be much harder than he had previously thought.
Sam sat down and Dean went to the small bar and grabbed him a beer, tossing it to him. Sitting back down they watched tv together. Dean was watching an old cheesy 80’s horror film. Sam never understood why he loved them, when it was their life.
Dean could feel an explosion building, he was about to come. He held Sam tighter, digging his nails into his back. Pulling him in for another kiss, muffling the sounds of his moans. Sam thrust harder, pounding into him. The bed under them shook and slammed into the wall.
Dean looked down finally as saw it. His body was different. He had firm breast, his waist was smaller, skin softer. He was a girl. His eyes grew wide, panic set in as well as slight confusion.
Sam was already awake, his side of the bed was empty. Dean stretched out before pulling back the covered to get out of bed. He could hear the faint sounds of Sam and Cas talking somewhere in the bunker. He stumbled across the room, still naked from the night before.
Sam opened his laptop trying to ignore Dean. He kept looking up to secretly watch Dean’s chest rise and fall with each breath he took.
Dean quickly stood up and began to grab his clothes, getting dressed quickly. Sam picked up his boxers and shoved them on, covering his nakedness.
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean cried out. He could feel his orgasm building stronger and stronger. He tried to grip the table, fisting clenching as he lost control going over the edge.
Dean tilted his head back, holding onto the back of Sam’s head, guiding him. He felt himself getting closer and closer to coming. Sam knew Dean was close and began to work faster and harder. He wanted Dean to fill his mouth, to let his come overflow. He needed to taste him.
He slowly pushed his cock in, stretching him out. Dean moaned loudly as Cas’ cock went in deeper and deeper. Filling and stretching him out. Cas held onto Dean’s hips, pulling him towards him.
Several hours passed and Dean was still in his room. He never changed like Rowena had said, instead he sat on his bed with his laptop in front of him. A knock at the door startled him, and Rowena sauntered in. A sly look on her face gave away what she was there for.
He took turns on each of their cocks, sucking them deeply. Bringing them closer to orgasm, working faster and faster each time he switched. He looked up to see Sam and Cas kissing each other. He smiled at the sight.
Before he had met Cas, he had always believed that if he were ever to meet the love of his life, he would remember that moment in detail until his last breath. The truth was, the only thing he remembered was Cas standing before him with a slight smile, speaking. He couldn’t recall any words, just a low rumble of Castiel’s voice, and a thought that his eyes looked like an overcast sky. He could also remember a salty, fresh smell of seawater, but maybe he imagined it now, knowing that Cas was a sailor.
Deciding to go deeper into the woods, he picked up an uneven pace, walking as fast as the bushes around allowed. Somewhere in the back of his mind a thought appeared that he
,” Dean choked out, unable to look away, still eyeing tattoo on Cas’ back, which was dangerously close to his ass.
“Why?” Josie furrowed her brow. “I’m sure there are dozens of more interesting people than me you could’ve summoned.”
Dean didn’t know how long they stood like that, wrapped in each other. A human and a creature of light. It could have been minutes, it could have been hours. Finally Death himself came and Dean felt somehow relieved it was someone he already knew. He closed his eyes for the last time in the dream world, and when he opened them again a lot of familiar, long unseen faces greeted him.
“I’m not,” Cas shakes his head, and then continues after a beat. “Dean, I need to apologize. You lost your home because of me, and—” The rest of the sentence is cut off when Dean drags Castiel closer, wrapping his arms around him and pressing their lips together.
Cas caught his wrist. Dean’s heart seemed to stutter for a minute, before he focused on cataloging how the hand felt against his skin. A bit calloused, dry, and big. Unexpected, but nice. Then, sudden warmth spread through his whole body, the dew evaporated in delicate whiffs of steam, and even the uneven ground stopped bothering him.
Dean was close enough now to see the childish pout on his face. “Come on Cas, don’t we all have some embarrassing childhood photos?” he teased, moving even closer. Cas was still looking around, nowhere in particular, not meeting Dean’s eyes. Suspicious. “It’s not a childhood photo, is it?” Cas’ silence served as a confirmation and it cracked Dean up. “Dude, now I
As if on cue, Castiel entered the kitchen, probably drawn in by Sam’s raised voice. “Is there a problem?” he asked, hovering over Dean’s shoulder and glaring at Sam. Sam was bigger than Cas, but Cas looked pretty intimidating with his tattoos, blue hair and a beard. Dean would never admit it, but Cas defending him made him warm inside, a wave of affection spreading through his body.
The music volume dropped so that people could talk freely, and the blonde woman from before asked everyone to take their seats, signaling the near start of the event. Grimacing, Dean paid the bartender and shuffled in the direction of the lounge with resignation. No one looked his type. Or like he could be
“That’s sad,” Jo said. “We have a whole bunch of people from our world visiting this one. Me and my mom had to actually turn some of them away from the Roadhouse, because we had no more rooms available. The word spread fast and now everyone wants to travel.”
“Yours looks less awful than mine,” Dean said with a pout, though he only thought it because everything looked better on Cas. “Anyway, I’m hungry. And pretty sure even Charlie’s sweaters can’t help with that.”
He heard a furious growl, the porch cracked loudly, and then something big leaped over him. There was a terrified scream and suddenly he was free. The fog disappeared.
. Maybe the stuff Missouri had been teaching him was working, maybe it was something else, it didn’t matter. He stopped in the middle of a kiss, his stomach twisting with worry. “Wait. Something is wrong,” he said, pushing Cas away.
“Okay, okay. You know what? This is too much.” Dean brushed a hand across his mouth. “I need-- I need a moment. Can you-- Can you just imagine yourself somewhere else for a while?”
It was another warm day and Dean watched a bunch of rabbits running around Cas’ legs, while the two of them sat by the river. Green tree branches hung above the water, sun shining through the leaves. One of the rabbits hopped in Dean’s direction and started sniffing his hand.
Once they got outside Sam turned around, gaping at the view. Dean waited patiently until Sam was able to compose himself again, though it took a couple of deep breaths. It was hard to believe he was in Sam’s place only four months ago. So much had changed that it seemed like a whole lifetime.
Castiel gave him a quick smile. “Just like that. You wanted my help, and I agreed.” He stood up. “You might be disappointed though. If I knew what it was, I would already do something about it.” He paused. “Something’s keeping me away, I can’t get anywhere near those blighted parts of the forest. I do whatever I can, but to tell the truth, you are not the only one in need of help.”
So, Dean dreamed. It was one of those unusually vivid dreams. But it wasn’t like the ones before. There was light everywhere, light so bright he had to close his eyes, and even then he still could see the red of his eyelids. He had no idea what was happening.
It most likely won’t buy them enough time to escape, though. Someone is going to notice, or the guards are going to wake up on their own. And this time they will come prepared. Dean hopes that by then, Cas will be able to get them out.
Castiel appeared to be just as hungry. He beelined to the first booth he saw, and pored over the menu like it was some sort of holy scripture. His eyes gleamed as he followed the text, his lips slightly moving. Dean hid a smile behind his own card, trying to focus on the choice of burgers the place offered. No one should have had that kind of enraptured look sitting in a diner with cheap formica tables and worn vinyl seats.
Spent, Sam pulled out and crashed onto the bed next to Dean. Pulling Dean in close to him, Sam kissed him again. This time more gently, lovingly.
“She said to just deal with it. We can just hang out around the bunker until then. No hunting, I guess.”
Cas walked over to where Sam and Dean were, still embraced together. Sam reached out and grabbed the angels hand pulling him closer before kissing Dean again.
They turned to look at the entrance to the kitchen. Cas stood there smiling. He had heard everything, he came back to grab something. He wanted this more than anything.
Sammy helped Rowena get everything ready for the reversal spell. It was a potion that Dean would drink, not as simple as the witches curse. But it would get the job done, and that’s all that mattered for them.
Rowena broke the kiss off and pushed his hand away. Dean gave her a confused look but didn’t push it. Rowena smiled at him, she wanted badly to continue but knew better.
Sam stood up, his cock already hard and in his hand. He stroked it as he watched his brother get his pussy ate by an angel. He loved how hot it was and wanted in on it. Dean’s moaned made him harder, and he needed to be inside of his big brother.
Sam closed down and let go and watched as Dean rested on his still hard cock. They both breathed heavily, lost in the moment of their shared orgasm.
Sam stood suddenly and grabbed Dean, turning him around and pushing him back onto the recliner. Dean’s eyes grew as he watched his brother get on his knees in front of him.
With both hands on Dean’s waist Sam pushed his cock into Dean’s tight asshole. Dean moaned as he felt himself become completely full and stretched. Giving him a moment to adjust, Sam and Cas waited before picking up the pace.
Sam tried not to notice his brother’s perky breast, but he was a guy after all, even if it was so very wrong. He said his goodbyes to Rowena on the phone and hung up.
Getting up he noticed his feet did hit the floor with the same force as usual, weird, but he ignored it. He felt off but couldn’t place it. Groggy, he made his way to the kitchen to get some coffee in him as well as something to eat.
“Rowena, I thought that you weren’t going to be here until later tonight?” Castiel asked in a gruff, monotone voice.
Cas lifted Dean up with ease and sat him down on the table, never breaking his lips from the hunters. In one quick motion he removed his pants. Grabbing his hips, Cas pulled Dean forward to the edge.
With one hand he rubbed the cold lube all over his cock, and with the other he began to massage the outside of Dean’s ass. Slowly he pushed one finger in. Dean was slowly moving up and down on his finger and Cas’ dick. Sam put another finger in, scissoring them to open him up, and finally a third. When Dean was ready he pulled out and placed his cock at the entrance.
Reaching down he grabbed Dean, pulling him upwards and towards him. Their faces collided, lips crashing into each other, kissing one another deeply. Cas was still standing there, hands at his sides, fingers curled under, head tilted to the side.
Sam watched as Dean’s green eyes rolled back, his lips parted as a moan escaped his lips. He felt his pussy quiver around his cock as he slammed into him harder, feeling his orgasm build and build.
“Cas is around here somewhere and Rowena is in the shower I think. I heard it turn on when I was down that way a bit ago.”
“Man,” Dean groaned. His voice was higher and more delicate. He would have liked the way his own voice sounded if it wasn’t coming from himself.
Cas took the tablet from Dean, reading the same paragraph that he had just read. He mouthed the words silently to himself. His face furrowed the more he read.
He felt his body get hotter, and not just from the scalding hot water. Fuck. It hadn’t been long since he was in the kitchen with Cas and he was already ready for another round. No. He had to get at least some work done. Hunting or not, there still was work to do around the bunker. Maybe get under the hood of Baby.
Sam sat on the edge of his bed, his cock in his hand, not sure if he should be doing this. He knew the image of his brother, who was suddenly a girl, would fill his mind.
“I’m going to go catalogue more of the items from the archives,” said Sam before turning and leaving.
But it was weird, why would Sam suddenly be so turned on by Dean in this new cursed female body. There had to be more to this. Sam opened his laptop and began to search the web, looking for anything about a curse like this, and if there was more to it than just the body.
Dean rolled his eyes and chuckled nervously. He didn’t know how to explain what had been happening. How could he? He had been sleeping with his own brother and his best friend. Especially since the effect on others would only happen if they were already sexually attracted to him. He had no idea even where to begin with everything.
“You know… we have three days. You going to be able to handle having me like this for that long? I mean, you can’t even sit next to me without getting hard.”
“How big is this forest?” Cas asked with interest, catching up with her. “I’ve never seen anything quite like it.”
Dean sat right next to him, resting his elbows on the step above. The night was warm and windless, the smell of summer in the air. There were no clouds in the sky, the stars and the moon clearly visible. It was almost completely quiet, except for the crickets chirping somewhere in the distance.
“Thanks, Jo. You’re so sweet, I finally know what Charlie sees in you,” he retorted, padding barefoot to the fridge.
“Do you feel seduced, Dean?” Castiel sounded amused, his eyes glinting. Shit, why did Dean have to say
Castiel managed to smear some whipped cream on his face, leaving a white trail across his cheek. He continued to eat, blissfully unaware, and Dean did his best not to laugh, taking out his phone to snap a photo. It was a truly memorable moment.
The amulets from Bobby arrived the next day and they could finally get back to work. All four of them drove to the woods, each taking one of the pendants. It was hard to believe a small piece of metal was going to protect them, but they didn’t have much choice.
Soon after they reached their destination, the sun disappeared behind the horizon, leaving them with fading leftovers of daylight. They delved into the thick woods, their guns ready, trying to maneuver between vines and mossy trees as quietly as possible.
They fell asleep bundled up together, sharing the warmth, their breaths leveled out. Dean was happy.
“Good. That means we can cross out one thing from the list,” Dean decided, mixing milk with cream cheese. Maybe he should give more thought to the name, but
The feeling of an alien presence grew stronger as they moved closer to their room. It seemed that whatever was in the house waited for them behind that door. Dean didn’t feel ready to face it. They didn’t have much choice though and after a short nod from Cas he pushed the handle and swung the door open.
There was a pause on the other side. “I don’t think it’s wise for you to go there, considering everything.”
“Fair point.” Dean grimaced. It was hard to admit, but unless Castiel’s weak spot was contained within badly written guidebooks for parents, he was right. “Okay. You can help.”
“Also it’s a miracle, but we managed to get rooms here for all our guests,” Charlie said. “I mean Hannah and Kevin just went home, but for everyone else.”
Dean laughed. “What about you?” He asked the question jokingly, but studied Cas carefully to see his reaction. It seemed very unlikely that Castiel had anything to do with the disappearances and everything else, and Dean didn’t really believe it was him, if he was being honest with himself, but stranger things had happen before.
Castiel propped himself on the mop handle. “He never visited the house since I got here,” he said. “There was a group of workers some time ago that renovated the place, but I never showed myself to them. They left after a few months. At some point I started hoping no one would ever move in.”
That’s why he lay awake right now, unable to sleep. He traced the shape of Cas’ body with his eyes. It was already sealed in his mind with all its quirks and angles and scars — he knew that shape better than he knew his own. But that was never enough. He had to remember it better; the memory had to last for months, had to be vivid enough for him to bear the loneliness of the empty house and the lack of Cas' warm voice.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “We’ll have to go back tomorrow, look for more of the places like the one we found. Maybe there’s still a chance we can save everyone. And someone had to see the face of the fucker who did that to them.” He started peeling off the label of the bottle in his hands. “Are the animals safe?”
There were quick steps on the porch accompanied by Benny’s cursing. “What the fuck is happening here? Are you trying to tear this place down or what? I swear I could hear--”
He was wrong. Since then he had dreamed about Castiel over and over again. Every dream was different, and  seemed to be a continuation of the previous one, making him hope that maybe, just
“Not much of a choice!? You should’ve come to me and try to work out a more diplomatic approach!” She sighs. “All right. I didn’t come here to reprimand you, Dean, though you deserve that. I wanted to let you know that I’m going to see what I can do about the situation. The council respects me and my work, and hopefully they’re going to listen. So don’t lose your hope yet, boy.”
“Yeah, sure,” Dean shrugged. They were further from the forest now, following one of river’s meanders. The grass was higher there, going up to Dean’s mid-thighs. Castiel didn't seem to notice, the path opened before him the same as before.
Castiel sighed, putting his leg back on the floor and raising the other one. “Yes. I find practicing yoga naked most rewarding.”
“Dean! What the hell were you thinking, disappearing without a word in a town where people go missing?” Jo demanded as soon as she picked up. “If you were busy, you could at least text me!”
Dean spent the next few days half-aware of what was happening around him. Both Jo and Charlie had left him alone after all their attempts to find out what happened ended up with him growling at them to go away.
“Dean, watch out!” Cas shouted, panic rising inside of him. His worst fears were close to coming true.
“It’s certainly not for everyone, but there are many enjoyable aspects of becoming a ghost,” Victoria said, oblivious to Dean’s suffering. “It’s been almost a hundred years for me and I still haven’t got tired of haunting all the disgusting men in this city until they learn how to treat women with respect.”
He almost told that to Castiel when the guy came back, but by that time the words seemed dumb and cheesy. Dean wasn’t good with words anyway. Instead he gave Cas a playful shoulder bump and took the rope from him, trying to figure out how the hell to balance his whole body on the seat the way Castiel just did.
“Okay, I’m not moving,” Dean agreed, his mind racing. “But you should know one thing,” he continued. “When you put a rifle on someone, you don't want to put it right against their back. Because it makes it real easy…” He turned swiftly, grabbing the rifle out of the girl’s hands. “...to do that.” There weren’t many things he could be grateful for to his father, but in this moment he thanked John Winchester for the army training he put his too-young sons through. Even if it was completely fucked up, it came in handy sometimes.
“Are we all positive about doing this?” Dean asked, switching the lights off, and sitting next to Charlie, his eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness. He was surprisingly okay with the perspective of talking to a dead person, but he wanted to make sure they all were on the same page.
Dean caught himself petting Cas. Cas didn’t seem to object. It was a bit weird, but Dean decided he didn’t care.
Charlie told him that all that was left from the Heart was a charred trunk. At first Dean had tried to avoid thinking that maybe Castiel died with it, but it got harder as the days passed.
“Well, I’m human and punching me was enough for today, thanks,” Dean muttered, following after them.
“If that’s all, I’m going to be in my room. You can knock if you want something,” Castiel said after putting the mop back in the bathroom downstairs. “I may even open.”
“Yes,” Castiel said, propping himself against the counter. Dean pretended he didn’t ogle his tattoos, but the complex pattern of flowers, bees and birds wrapping around his arms was truly captivating. “It was years ago though. I belong to myself now.”
“Okay, fine,” Dean laughed, plucking a few grass strands and knotting them together to focus his hands on something. “I guess I was interested in stuff like this for a long time,” he started. “Since I was in my teens probably.” Since the time that he usually preferred to leave forgotten, when he’d been going from one psychiatrist to another; not able to sleep, plagued by nightmares, barely eating, and not allowing himself to get close to anyone. Back then he needed a distraction, and maybe also a hope of finding some sort of explanation of what happened. It got better with time, but his interest in the supernatural stayed. “Then I went to college and got into journalism. I always looked for weird shit, unsolvable mysteries, urban legends; you get the idea.”
Cas’ face was half-lit by the moon, its angles sharp, and now Dean couldn’t stop looking at him. “We’re going to get through this, I promise,” he said.
“However, we were informed about the very… special circumstances of this case, and given that the Archstone is still intact, we are not going to sentence you to death. That said, we have no guarantee that you won’t act against Haven in the future. And it’s our job to make sure people feel safe here.” Linda takes a breath. “We decided that it will be best if you leave Haven and never come back. You are sentenced to exile. You have seven days to prepare. After that I hope to never see you again.”
“Oh, come on,” Dean groans. “I’m not saying I’m happy about being exiled, but I knew from the start it would be dangerous and I made my decision. And you’re alive, you’re here, so will you please let me have a moment?”
Josie looked somewhere above their heads. “I was raised by my grandma, who was also the guardian before me.” She smiled to herself. “She taught me everything she knew about the other world.” Her face became somber again. “After she died, I was completely alone. Then I met Henry, and soon he became the closest thing to a family I had. I told him about the portal and he seemed fascinated by it, asking thousands of questions. We were supposed to visit the other side together, but I died before we had a chance. I hoped he would continue without me, but I guess I was wrong.”
The place is heavily guarded, though it only takes one or two obscure sleeping spells and they’re in. Apparently the guards didn’t think they’d need protection against ancient magic designed for putting small children to sleep.
They went to the city market again, browsing through the stalls, and trying on clothes and accessories from time to time.
“Wait. So this is a dream. But you’re real? I mean, you’re really you? I didn’t just dream all of this up?”
Fortunately for Dean, Castiel managed to revert the room almost to how it was before, leaving them only with a handful of seeds and some tears in the sheets. Dean chose not to ask.
“Even Superman can go to the dark side.” Cas tried to sound solemn, but there was a happy glint in his eyes, giving him away. He smelled nice, lingering traces of something herbal noticeable even after the whole night out. They were standing much closer than Dean had thought. How the hell did they end up only inches from each other?
“Charlie’s a witch, most of the guests are from another world, and we have a magical portal in the basement,” Dean blurted out. Hopefully it wasn’t too much information at once.
Dean knew the story. Everyone did. It wasn’t a secret, even if most people tended to keep their distance. The alley hadn’t always been haunted, but since the death of its previous owner, it had become a hotspot for the local ghost population. It probably had something to do with the fact that Ms. Moseley, who’d taken over the place after her husband's demise, was a medium, but why the hell ghosts had decided bowling was their new favorite thing was beyond Dean.
For a few minutes it feels almost like nothing has changed. Dean wants to relish in that feeling, in the sight of Cas stuffing his mouth with food, in the warmth and safety of his kitchen. He doesn’t want to think about leaving. He has to, though.
“Not really.” It was hard not to gag, and even harder to think clearly with his leg killing him. His vision narrowed, dark spots dancing before his eyes. “So what were you two up to? I’m sure you’re dying to have your big villain speech and tell me everything.”
“Yeah, she invited us, but she was very cryptic about it,” Dean said. Jo hadn’t told them much, saying she didn’t want to ruin the surprise. If it was up to Dean, he would prefer to know beforehand what they were getting themselves into, but it seemed like Jo was having a lot of fun keeping it a secret. He wasn’t going to ruin that for her.
The air outside smelled of wet plants and soil. The branches of the trees moved with the wind, the damp leaves glistening with water. The grounds around the house were unkempt, but they still had a lot of charm, and after spending the last few years around Bobby’s scrapyard it was nice to be surrounded by so much greenery. There was even enough space to start a vegetable garden in the future, if he wanted.
The first thing Dean registered waking up was a nasty crick in his neck, followed by unpleasant stiffness of all his joints, and a nauseating sense of vertigo. His back wasn’t too happy either, being pressed against the cold ground. Weird. Why the hell wasn’t he in his bed? This couldn’t be Moondoor, the nearest battle was weeks away. But if not Moondoor, then what?
The floorboards creaked and a dark shape blocked the light, making Dean jump. His heart sped up. Somebody was in the room. Somebody who shouldn’t be there. He remembered locking the front door before he went to sleep. Did someone break in?
Dean took Sam to some of the places he and Cas discovered during the last few months, showing him majestic temples and tiny shops filled with knick-knacks and old books, cafes between the roots and high balconies in the tree crowns. Sam seemed to enjoy himself a lot, taking everything in with wide eyes and thousands of questions.
Castiel was right beside him, in his human form this time. He took Dean’s hand and squeezed it in reassurance. Everything was going to be okay.
A small, yellow, flickering light appeared over the water. Seconds later it was joined by another, and then another one, and another. Suddenly there were more than a hundred of them, swirling in the air. Fireflies.
The rest of the evening passed in peace. Anna and Ruby retreated to their room pretty fast, in need of some privacy after the whole incident with Michael. Dean thanked everyone for help. Bela just shrugged, saying it was a pleasure, Hannah nodded with a small smile and Victor brushed it off, saying it wasn’t a problem. He was used to dealing with worse due to his job.
Dean and Cas shot him a glaring look. Dean figured out years ago that Cas stuck around for more than the reasons he let on. He wondered about his own feelings for Cas, he knew his feelings for Sam were stronger, but he couldn’t help but feel a strong connection to Cas. Hell, an attraction.
“Like I said, all Dean has to do now is go to bed and when he wakes he will have his body back. It’s just waiting for that now. But it did work, and you will have him back to normal shortly.”
Sam and Dean both dreamt of the past day, of each other, and how they felt. Sam woke in the middle of the night, and watched Dean next to him for a moment before falling back to sleep. But before he could return to his slumber he said what had been lingering in the back of his head for years now, a truth he had been so afraid to say aloud all this time.
Sam looked puzzled. “Your own home? Look, don’t take this the wrong way, but I don’t think Dean is going to have you move in after one night.”
Dean nodded, smiling. He got up and went over to Sam, who turned his chair to face Dean. Dean leaned down and kissed Sam, parting his lips with his, sliding his tongue into his mouth.
Dean noticed Sam’s face, his furrowed brow and nervous expression. Holy shit, Sammy’s turned on by me. Dean felt a twinge between his legs and the sudden warmth and wetness.
The angel began to finger Dean, scissoring his fingers to open him up. Dean pushed back onto his hand, his back arching from the feeling. Soon he was open enough and Cas lubed up his own cock before placing it at Dean’s entrance.
Cas slammed in and out of Dean’s tight pussy. He pushed Dean back onto the table, giving Sam warning to pull out for a moment. He lifted Dean’s legs up and over his shoulder, gripping his thighs. Sam quickly pushed past Dean’s lips and continued to pump into his throat.
“No need to be nervous. They love you, and I know you love them. You will figure it out. Now come on, Sam made dinner.”
“Boys! I find what I needed fairly easily, so I thought I’d come to the rescue sooner,” a voice called out from the main entrance of the bunker.
Sam led Dean to his bedroom. Once the door was shut they collided into each other, kissing and touching one another. Making their way to the bed, the two stripped each other. Only breaking away from the kiss to catch their breaths. They grasped desperately at each other, full of need and want.
Cas came first, filling Dean’s mouth with his come. He then turned his attention to Sam, making him fill his throat. He pulled back out of breath, come dripping down his chin. He needed them now, needed them inside of him.
Slowly he pushed his finger inside, it was hot and tight. He squeezed his eyes shut at the slight pain, it wasn't too bad. Then again his finger wasn’t that big.
Cas sat back down, nervous and excited for the reversal spell to take effect. He wanted Dean back, the Dean he had pulled from Hell. He loved the past few days, but it wasn’t right. He wanted to be with Dean, the real Dean. He knew that Sam felt the same as he did. Cas wondered what it would be like the next morning when things would return to normal. Would they continue the affair or would Dean rather not speak of it again?
The angel undid his pants and took out his thick cock, slicking his hand with his tongue, he rubbed his cock a few times, making sure it was nice and wet, before entering Dean’s warmth. Cas let out a breathy, soft moan as he slowly pushed in, inch by inch. Dean’s head rolled back, his eyes closing as his pussy was stretched.
Dean stopped, not wanting Sam to be spent just yet, even though he now knew his brother could last a while. Standing up he gave Sam room to get up.
Sam stayed down for as long as he could, only moving his face slightly to the side to catch his breath before continuing. He flicked Dean’s clit with the tip of his tongue, swirling around it one way then quickly in the opposite direction. Then he sucked on it a bit, tongue still swirling. Dean reached down and ran his fingers through Sam’s long hair, grabbing it in his fist, eyes closed shut as his legs shook.
His cock was pressed against the bed, throbbing as he began to come, spilling onto the sheets beneath him. Cas felt him squeeze around his cock, sending him over the edge. Sam was hitting Cas at just the right spot, pounding into his hole hard. Cas dug his nails in deeper as he came with a force inside of Dean. Sam came at the same time, filling Cas’ hole with his come.
Looking in the mirror he liked how he looked. The hunter wondered if they had a sister is this what she would look like? He could recognize the real him even still. He had the same green eyes, the same freckles spread across his nose and cheeks. His eyebrows raised the same way in curiosity. His smile was still his smile.
Pulling his fingers out, Sam positioned himself between Dean’s legs, hooking them around him, lining his swollen cock at the entrance before pushing in. Dean cried out as Sammy sunk in deep, feeling his brother’s cock stretch him out. He thrust up towards Sam, pushing him in deeper.
Dean shut his bedroom door and crashed onto the bed, passing out before he even hit the pillow. Three witches killed and burned, a curse and all those hours of driving non-stop. It had been a rough few days.
Sam felt his cock get instantly hard as Dean began to rub his dick over his jeans. Dean got down on his knees, spreading Sam’s legs open. Sam quickly unzipped his pants and undid his belt. The older Winchester pulled them off, pushing them to the side.
“What? Dean, I don’t want to bother you, nor do I want anything to be an issue after Rowena cures you.”
Rowena made her way into the library and stood frozen. Her lips parted as she raised a brow. It was obvious what was going on. She knew the side effects of the curse, and figured this was the only thing her boys had been doing for the past few days. But she didn’t expect to be walking in on it.
Dean went down to the base before slowly pulling back up again. The taste of precum slid down his throat. He began to work faster, moving his head up and down harder. Sam let out a gasp as his orgasm built up, spilling over the edge.
Dean stayed silent for a moment, wondering what was going to happen. He was nervous, what if they all wanted to forget about it. What if him being back to normal was too much, even though they had been attracted to him that way. He also knew that Sam loved him, as did Cas, and he loved them and didn’t want this to end.
Dean took another shower, washing off last nights and this mornings rounds of sex. He had grabbed the fancy shampoos that Sam keeps hidden from him, and got to work massaging the soap into his now much longer hair. It was weird, but felt nice. All of this was just that, weird but felt nice.
Sam stood behind him, hands in his pockets, looking awkward as ever. Dean raised his eyebrows at him. Even though he looked so different, he was still Dean. Sam gave a nervous smile.
Rowena was admiring the vintage cars while Cas told her about the men of letters a bit more. They finally noticed Dean and made their way over to him. Rowena smiled at the success of the spell, admiring her work.
Cas loved the way Dean tasted. He loved the moans he let out as his tongue moved, exploring every inch of Dean’s pussy. He slowly made his way down to the entrance, making sure no area was missed. He circled the entrance, teasing Dean before plunging his tongue into the tight hole. Swirling and moving in and out at the same time, Cas began to fuck Dean with his tongue.
“I’m not sure. I think so though. It will be different though, not just because I’ll be me again. I don’t know, I guess I’m nervous about it.”
Sam was close as well and he tightened his grip on Dean’s waist. Taking over he guided him up and down, each time he brought him down he grinded Dean against him, before lifting him back up again. Bringing him up his whole length to the tip before slamming him back down. Faster and harder than before. He let out a moan as well as he began to come. Dean let go of the chair and put his hands over Sammy’s, gripping tightly.
Dean’s eyes fluttered open, crusted with sleep, he squeezed his eyes together and rubbed the dust of the night away. Yawning he sat up, not daring to look at the clock, knowing he slept in late.
His legs began to shake as he began to come. Sam now had two hands on Dean’s head, as he roughly slammed into him. Tears formed in Dean’s eyes, not from pain or sadness, but from the amount of force in which Sammy fucked his face. As well as the struggle of holding his mouth stretched wide for so long.
Pulling back to move his attention to Cas. And repeated what he had just done with his brother. Cas’ eyes closed and his mouth parted. Dean went back and forth between his brother and the angel. Bringing them closer and closer to orgasm. Finally when he could tell they were both on the edge, aching for release, he took them in each of his hands and began to fiercely stroke their cocks until they came together. Covering his face with their hot cum.
Sam and Dean quickly turned their heads to see Castiel standing in the door frame looking at them confused.
Dean held onto the headboard tightly, his tits bouncing in Cas’ face. He moaned out in pleasure as he felt each cock sliding in and out, his pussier getting wetter and wetter. As Cas’ cock pulled out Sam’s slammed in. Over and over.
“No judgement from me. I’m happy for you boys,” the witch said smiling. She continued, “I better be going then, I did my job.”
Making his way down to the tight hole he teased the outside, nervous that it might hurt. He was technically a virgin when it came to this new body.
They crashed down onto the bed, Dean between the two. They were out of breath and a tangle of legs and arms. Sweating and chest rising and falling heavily, they held onto each other. Sam and Cas both kissed Dean, running their hands across his chest before finding each other.
“Um… no. Dean, it’s hard just standing here next to you. I don’t understand these thoughts and urges…” Cas trailed off.
Dean thought about it a moment before replying, “Yeah, Sammy. I do. It will be different, I’ll be me again. But yeah, I hope so.”
“It feels weird. Not bad weird but also not good weird. Just… weird. I am curious about, well you know.”
Turning off the shower and wrapping a towel around his waist, old habits, Dean stepped out. He caught a look at himself in the mirror and admired himself. He was an attractive girl. The kind of girl he would have tried to pick up in a bar, or flirt his ass off if he was a waitress in a diner in the middle of nowhere. Someone he could give an amazing night to and then never saw again.
Dean put his hand on her waist before slowly inching it down between her legs. He inched it under her dress, caressing her thighs before making his way up. He could feel her silk lingerie, the heat of her body, the way her trembled at his touch.
Rowena mixed the ingredients together in a metal bowl. Dean and Cas stood together nearby, waiting for it to be finished. Sam on the other hand, stood next to Rowena handing her ingredients as she asked for them. She spoke the enchantment with intent, sealing the spell. A dark red smoke rose up from the bowl,
Dean noticed Sam shuffling in his chair, he seemed uneasy. He tried hard not to watch Dean. While the staring oddly enough didn’t make Dean uncomfortable, the fact that Sam clearly was did.
“Well, once you wake up and are in your old body again. Are you Sam and Castiel going to continue on as you were lately?”
Letting go of his cock, he placed his hand on Dean’s waist and slowly guided him down. Making sure to keep his eyes on his face, looking out for any signs of discomfort. Dean’s mouth opened more as he felt Sam’s cock stretch his tight pussy. Sammy was bigger than he had thought, and he was impressed by how much he could take, given his own private adventure from earlier.
Sammy came with force, sweat dripping down his back as he filled Dean, overflowing out of him. Dean came as soon as he felt the wetness pour out of him. Dragged his hands down, nails leaving red markings down Sam’s back. His thighs shook, groaning into Sam’s kiss, licking at his mouth. Sam’s tongue was deep in Dean’s throat as he felt Dean’s pussy vibrate on his dick.
In the kitchen, Cas was already at the table. Dean came in and got the coffee pot started. The sound of the drip was soothing, and he sat down across from Cas.
Dean sat up, pulling his shirt down and around his knees. It was still pulled up over his butt, which pressed into the wooden table. His face flushed red and his breathing was still heavy. The lingering end of his orgasm fading.
Sam held onto Dean’s waist, letting Dean take control. His pussy was wet and warm, tightly squeezing his cock as he rode it, getting faster and faster. Dean’s head rolled back and he held onto the chairs arms, fingers squeezing at the fabric.
Dean looked puzzled, “She’s known about this for three days now, that should of been enough time to get everything.”
“Dean, I’m telling you that I get it. I know that you and Sam, you’ve always had just each other. I’m not surprised that certain emotions formed over the years. But you need, you both need, to prepare for when the curse is gone. Nothing will be the same.”
Dean reached for his belt, that was bucketed as tight as it would go out and began to undo it. Letting his pants drop, he wore oversized Scooby-Doo boxers under, Sam gave a half smile. Dean began to pull those down as well when Sam stopped him.
He heard Dean walk past his room and make his way down the hall to the bathroom. Within moments he heard the faint sound of the shower. The thought to sneak out and get a peek floated through his mind.
Sam came into the room, causing Dean to straighten up. He stopped, tablet in hand, looking at Dean on the bed and Cas standing besides him. He smiled quickly before letting his face drop.
There was a knock on his door. He could tell by the sound that it was Cas. Dean called out letting the angel know it was okay to come in. Cas shut the door behind him, his face set in a worried expression.
Dean put on a black t-shirt, it was too big on his small frame. It hung halfway down his thighs. Realizing it was basically a dress on him, he shrugged. The air felt nice between his legs, it was freeing. He made his way to the bathroom to get ready for the day, brushing his teeth and hair.
In the library Dean found Sammy and Cas seated at the table. Sam already had his laptop open, most likely researching cases. They would be getting back to hunting things and saving people soon enough here. Cas sat across from him, silently reading over a large book.
Cas grunted in his low rough voice as he felt his cock twitch, his balls were tight as he was about to burst. He thrust harder and faster as he came. Dean’s legs tightened around Cas’ waist, holding him close to him as he came.
Dean stood up and faced Sam. Slowly and amateurishly he removed his green shirt, pulling it up and over his breast. Sam’s mouth dropped slightly.
Out of breath, Sam flopped over onto the bed. Dean followed suit and laid down next to him, laying in between him and Cas. Cas was in shock over what had just happened, and Dean chuckled at the look on his face.
“Okay, let’s go,” Dean said, heading for the stairs. Cas stumbled after him, propping himself against a wall. Dean threw an arm around him, and they both wobbled down the stairs. The monster followed close after them and Dean had a sense of deja vu, reminding him of their earlier escape. The difference was that now Castiel was wounded, bleeding all over his shirt. Dean wished he turn back time.
Jo was waiting for them in the cellar, and she got up from the floor as soon as she saw them. “Fuck, what happened?” she asked, her voice getting higher than usual.
“Sam is happy. He got married, you know? His wife is great. They don’t have kids, but I swear their dogs are almost like a bunch of kindergarteners. And, uh. I was with someone for a few years. It was good, but… Well, it didn’t last.”
“Not that I don’t appreciate that you're finally out of your inner cave Dean, but what’s gotten into you today?” Jo asked him later, while he and Charlie were playing cards and she was reading, sprawled on the bed.
Then Charlie wanted to teach Castiel how to play some dumb card game, forcing Dean to play as their opponent. They were having a half-hearted conversation about the hunt between turns, until Dean declared that he was done; it was unfair playing against both Charlie and Cas. They were just too good.
“Of course! Our science involves magic, I didn’t know there was a way it could work without it.” Jo handed him the phone back. “Your world is pretty fascinating,” she said with excitement. And maybe it really was, Dean thought, even if he never saw it that way before.
Castiel sighed, looking up. Dean tried not to be offended. “I’m assuming you don’t know anything about magic. It feeds on your energy. It would be a waste to use that energy when you can simply use a key.”
“No!” Dean denied quickly. “I just didn’t expect you to be so passionate about it. It’s kind of cool actually,” he said, looking away. The streets looked so small from there, the city lighting up with thousands of lanterns. “I never thought I would see something like this. I’m, uh. I’m glad you’re here with me,” he mumbled, suddenly feeling hot.
“Shit! Cas, a little help maybe?” he shouted, hoping that Cas would be able to do something about the situation.
Soon they all were cutting down the cocoons and opening them. There were mostly animals, but they also found a middle aged man, an elderly woman and a teenage boy. Dean immediately recognized the boy from the pictures in Lisa’s house, a sudden wave of relief washing over him. He wasn’t aware how much he feared finding Ben’s dead body at some point and having to tell that to Lisa. They all seemed unharmed, just deeply sleeping. It was almost a miracle.
The sun isn’t up yet and won’t be for another few hours. It’s cold. Their breaths turn into steam in the air. They try to stick to the shadows and get as close to the tower as possible without being noticed. It’s tricky with the blue light making the night much brighter, but they manage.
“We’ll be right behind you, there’s nothing to worry about.” Dean tried to sound reassuring, feeling kind of bad for scaring her. He wasn’t sure if it worked, but Charlie nodded with new determination and made a step forward, vanishing from the room.
The first guests arrived early in the autumn, when days became shorter and the trees around the house turned from lush green to bold oranges and yellows. It was weird in the beginning, having all those people around, but Dean adjusted fast and found himself enjoying cleaning and cooking for them. Coming up with items for the menu was a lot of fun, and even doing tons of laundry wasn’t that bad.
Cas narrowed his eyes, his expression hard to read. “Missouri suspects it’s because I’m becoming more human.”
All eyes in the room are fixed on him. A small woman in her fifties clears her throat. Dean recognizes her as Linda Tran, the head of the council. Her son, Kevin, visited Singer Salvage a few times in the past when the spells on his cello broke.
Dean invited him in and launched Muscle March. The game was absurd — Charlie had given it to him as a joke and Castiel still wasn’t over almost naked men swinging their butts to chase after a thief of protein powder — but for some reason they both had gotten really competitive at it and now they played fairly often.
That night Dean woke up with tears in his eyes. He couldn't decide whether he wanted to remember the dream in detail or to forget everything, make the longing go away. In any case, he assumed the dream would not repeat itself, that it was just a very cruel one-time torture his mind subjected him to.
Ellie was already throwing detergent at the leviathan, as it sizzled and groaned, black substance splashing around everywhere. The monster waved one of its tentacles, shoving her across the corridor. Tracy took her place immediately, and more detergent landed on the leviathan’s slick body.
“Really?” Dean felt part of the weight lifted from his shoulders. Maybe that day wasn’t as bad as it looked like.
Cas led them to a room at the end of the corridor, entering after a small struggle with the rusty door. The room looked much older than the rest of the house; the walls were covered in strange symbols carved in the stone, a faint blue glow coming from some undefined direction. In the middle of the room stood an empty archway, leading seemingly to nowhere. The air was almost tangibly charged with energy.
“Dean, wait.” Castiel’s hand caught Dean’s elbow, which was so unexpected that it sent a shockwave through his body. “Let’s go there,” Cas said, jerking his head in the direction of the other side of the street.
Castiel looked at him with a hard to read expression. “I didn’t think you would actually bring me anything. Thank you.”
was the reason to avoid the forest,” Dean stated grumpily. “At least until we find a way to take care of it.”
The air in the basement was cold and musty, the smell bringing to mind a pile of dirty socks. Unlike the rest of the house it looked like nobody had been there in the last couple of years, the corridors full of old cobwebs blackened with dust. The whole place needed some serious cleaning, and it was bad enough that Dean bumped it a few positions up on his mental to do list, as he followed Castiel in the faint glow of the flashlight.
Henry hadn’t lived there and he hadn’t rented it to anyone, so the fact that he’d kept it at all was puzzling. He probably had been rich enough that keeping an empty house hadn’t mattered much, but whatever his reasons were, he’d taken them to the grave, and Dean could only guess what purpose the house served.
Benny didn’t know much. He didn’t think that they’d had anyone new move into town in the last few months, which only confirmed what Moore already told Charlie. He also said that none of the people staying at the inn were there long enough to have anything to do with the disappearances. Most importantly, he provided Dean with Lisa’s current address.
can barely stop thinking about it since I got here.” He laughed bitterly. “I’m pathetic, I was supposed to talk to this other guy, who used to be my friend too, to see if he knows anything useful for us, and I’m avoiding him too.”
Victoria smiled, looking between Dean and Cas. “It’s nice to meet you. Not that many living people hang out with the two of us here. Mostly it’s just my friend Annie, but she’s busy tonight.”
They started with the first floor, working in silence, dusting everything off and mopping the floors. The house creaked and groaned, making Dean think of a purring cat. Who knew, maybe the house was happy that someone finally took care of it. It wouldn’t surprise Dean at this point.
Cas always liked to spend time at Dean’s home and with his family. It had probably been a way to make up for how his own father had acted, at least partially. No wonder he was interested in what happened to them. Dean took a deep breath. How to summarize seventeen years in a few sentences?
“No, you don’t,” Castiel confirmed. His face was solemn but his eyes were smiling, a happy glint revealing his true emotions. An unexpected wave of affection washed over Dean, making it hard to look away. It would be so easy to close the space between them and kiss that stupid expression off his face, until they both were completely out of breath, gasping for air.
“I’m not convinced,” Dean grumbled, getting up. He stood before Cas, staring at him, bracing himself on one leg, suddenly very lightheaded. “Holy shit. I’m not dreaming, am I? You actually
“Cas?” Dean shouted. “Wait, I’m sorry, come back, please!” he pleaded into empty space. He looked around, confused, because Cas definitely seemed to be okay with the kiss at first. Apparently Dean was missing something. He groaned. Why did he always had to do something stupid and destroy everything?
And then Castiel saw him and froze. It was just a fraction of a second, but it was enough for Benton to strike again with full force. Cas hit the Heart and collapsed on the ground, not moving.
The expression on Castiel’s face was peaceful. Dean wished it could always be like that. He brushed fingers through Cas’ hair, reveling in the feeling of Cas’ body touching him. Cas moved slightly, murmuring something, but didn’t wake up, just curled up tighter against Dean’s chest.
“Not your fault, Cas.” Dean sighed, pushing away the ice cream. He just hoped it wasn’t going to happen ever again.
“Wait. You’re not Benton?” Dean decided the best thing he could do was stalling until some kind of miracle happened. “How many of you ugly asses is he trying to summon?” They were closer to the Heart now, and he threw a quick glimpse at Cas. His chest was still moving, thank God.
The rest of the week passes too fast, filled with plans and preparations. Dean has to decide what to take with them, and what to leave behind. It’s frustrating. Of course, Sam promises to send Dean his stuff as soon as they settle somewhere, but it doesn’t change the fact that for now Dean has to leave almost everything in Haven.
Even though he could still see himself, and what he was looking at in the mirror was hot. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t him. He didn’t look like how he should. He’s enjoyed these last few days but it wasn’t truly him. And as much as he loved the sex in this body, he was excited to continue what they began in his real body.
“Hey, Cas, if you’re a forest spirit, why do you look like a human?” Dean asked, before he could stop himself.
“I honestly expected you to be some hot knight killing his enemies left and right, but this is so much… nicer,” Cas said, giving him a long look. It sounded weirdly soft.
Dean groaned, hiding his head in his hands. “I didn’t sign up for any of this.” It probably wasn’t a very mature reaction, but he felt entitled to it. Being the guardian of a portal between two worlds wasn’t a small thing to accept.
Dean’s phone buzzed in his pocket, making the rabbit he was petting run away. He ignored it. Cas looked at him questioningly.
It seemed that when the realization finally came, it wasn’t going to let Cas think about anything else.
found us a hunt? You sure you’re talking about Sam? Or do I have another brother and nobody told me?”
“I don’t know exactly.” Jo shook her head. “But you can travel through it for days before reaching the edge.”
“The trees. I can’t talk to them.” Cas swallowed. “I wanted to ask if they knew anything and they-- they feel as if they’re dead. I can’t help them. I can’t even move any closer to them.”
“We weren’t in an actual danger,” Castiel stated calmly. “Jo and Ellen weren’t going to shoot us. Besides, I can’t turn myself into an object.”
Seeing Castiel with a mop and a bucket of water somehow made it easier to accept his presence. The whole situation still weirded Dean out, but he was already more at ease than a day ago. Castiel's good looks also helped, in a way. Dean did his best not to glance at him too often, but he couldn’t deny he checked out his butt a few times. What could he say? It was a nice butt, and he couldn’t really help himself.
“We’re still waiting, but it shouldn't be much longer.” Dean tried to sound reassuring, but they both knew that even with the amulets there was no guarantee they’d succeed. “Do you-- do you want to stay here for now?” he asked on impulse. Probably not a good idea. “Until we can enter the whole forest safely?”
Dean sighed. That wasn’t very helpful. “I’ll think about it.” One big decision a day was enough, and he had already decided to leave the portal open. Letting people stay at his house was an issue for another day.
“There’s this great ice cream place nearby. They’re usually open late,” he suggested when they moved from the club’s entrance, their steps echoing off the walls. He wasn’t sure if Cas had any expectations at all, but ice cream seemed to be a good start. “Is this a date, Cas?”
Despite Castiel’s initial decision to reconsider getting his grace back, convincing him that they have a chance to succeed is hard. It takes days before he agrees to Dean’s plan. And okay, Dean has to admit that it’s not a great plan, but they don’t have any other options. Acceptable options. Because he’s not going to just sit there and watch Cas die.
These thoughts drive Dean up the wall. He’s going to go mad if he doesn’t get an answer soon. And it’s his own fault, because he could’ve asked.
“I said he was my favorite superhero, not that I’ve ever worn the costume,” Castiel grumbled without conviction.
to find them a hunt in the town Dean had been trying not to think about since he was fourteen. “We, uh. We lived there when we were kids. Some shit went down with me and my friend and we moved away.” He tried to sound neutral. “Anyway, it was a long time ago. It doesn’t matter anymore,” he lied.
Things with Cas were good, better than Dean could’ve imagined, but somewhere inside Dean’s head there was this nagging feeling that something had to go wrong at some point. No matter how hard he tried to be happy, there was always a part of him waiting for the other shoe to drop. Good things never happened without a price, and he knew that sooner or later he would have to pay for his happiness.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Seriously, man?” What could’ve been a better ending to this whole fiasco than his last date turning out to be a total asshole? Not that Dean wanted to see any of those people again, but he wasn’t running around saying it. “Do you wanna spend the next seven minutes in silence, given you’re not even pretending to be interested?”
Sam listened to his advice, taking one of the chairs. “I don’t understand. This can’t be true,” he mumbled.
He rummaged through the fridge, putting butter on the table. “You can start by washing and slicing the apples,” he instructed. Cas nodded and left the book on the chair, moving to the sink.
The air between them suddenly felt charged, and Castiel slowly moved closer, his face only inches from Dean’s. Dean was almost sure what was going to happen next and his heart sped up, his stomach flipping. He leaned towards Cas, almost closing the space between them.
“Sam became a lawyer, and he’s happy with his wife, Sarah. She’s an art dealer and she’s pretty amazing. I’m not sure why she puts up with him, though. Mom is Mom, always worrying too much about us. She does a thousand different things at once. Last time I talked to her, she was planning on selling homemade preserves. And I don’t know about Dad. He was a real asshole about the whole thing that happened with me, argued with Mom constantly until she divorced him. I haven’t heard from him since then,” he said, and then added, “Fathers are real jerks, basically.”
“Just remember, no love spells or potions!” The woman pointed at the pamphlet, her cheerful expression unwavering. “We don’t want any incidents, and you can rest assured there are protections in place that will notify us right away if anyone breaks the law.”
“If you want to, of course,” Dean blurts out. “That would be cool. But you don’t have to. It’s your choice, you can go wherever you want.”
Cas smiled, wrinkles in the corners of his eyes becoming deeper. Dean smiled back, swallowing the lump in his throat.
A sudden lump appeared in Dean’s throat, making it hard to talk. “Yeah, I hope so,” he managed to mutter, looking away. Because what if Cas wasn’t going to be all right?
Before Dean had a chance to react, the beast leaped forward with another howl, knocking him down and digging its paws into his back. Castiel’s heart almost jumped out of his chest. This couldn’t be happening.
“Fine. You’re a witch, so I’m guessing you’re messaging each other through owls or some other shit anyway,” he said, half-joking. They
“I love you too, you asshat,” he finally mumbled. “Just. Never scare me again like that, okay?” There was still something dark in the corners of his mind, something telling him that he should get away from Cas for Cas’ own good, but he did his best to ignore it. Cas wanted to be there with him and that was most important.
Years ago he would have said that good things did not happen and he would have fought the dreams until they went away. It wasn't the case anymore. He wanted this. He just wasn’t sure whether the dreams made him happier or more miserable after waking up. He knew one thing, though. Being around Castiel always made him happy. He felt at peace when they were together. So he let himself dream.
Benny raised his brow, looking at Dean doubtfully. “And what can the three of you possibly do that the police can’t?”
Dean lifted himself up onto his elbows. He was still in the forest, though it was sunny and nice again, nothing like the creepy nightmare he’d just escaped. There were tears in his clothes and he was all covered with red, dried up smudges of leftover slime. Gross.
a book that would help them, the man had taken it with him, but it was worth trying. Soon Jo came across some spells involving conjuring magical fog, and that made them believe that at least they were on the right track. After that their search was uneventful for a long time.
“It was hiding in our room pretending to be a patch of mold,” Castiel explained. “I think it’s a leviathan. I’m not sure though.” A leviathan. It was nice to be able to put a name to the thing that had attacked them, but it didn’t seem to change much. Dean still had no idea what to do about the whole thing.
There were still so many things to do in the house, and he probably should start looking for a job sometime soon, because Henry’s money weren’t going to last forever. Maybe that would keep him occupied enough not to think about Castiel too much.
Jo jumped into the crowd, spinning in circles and leaving a ribbon of colorful dust behind. Charlie ran after her, throwing handfuls of powder in the air. Jo kissed her in the middle of the street, their foreheads touching. They both seemed so happy, full of positive energy, like this was the best thing under the sun.
Castiel didn’t answer right away, making Dean think he wasn’t going to at all. When he finally spoke, his voice was tense. “It started a few months ago. A bunch of animals disappeared, then trees in some areas stopped responding. I went to check on them, but I couldn’t get close. No matter how hard I tried, something wasn’t allowing me to go in there. The only thing I could do was to make sure no more animals wandered in those places. They all know better now, but it doesn’t help. Something is taking them away and even with trees helping where they can, I can’t save them all. And it’s getting worse. It’s spreading - the trees, the ground, they’re changing.” He paused for a long time. “But I can do that too.”
at it.” Being low-key psychic probably helped with that. “He could work for some big law firm, but he just wants to help people.” Growing up, he and Sam had been almost inseparable, despite the age difference. Dean had felt responsible for his brother, not wanting to leave everything on his mom’s head after their father had left them. And even though they didn’t spend as much time together now, they stayed close, and Dean was so damn happy to have Sam in his life.
“Did it ever stop being one?” Dean laughed, thinking back to his question from last night whether they were on a date or not. Neither of them could tell for sure back then.
“Three. My twin Hannah, older sister Anna, and younger sister Hael,” Castiel listed. “Things were often very… tumultuous growing up, but I love them a great deal.”
Dean wandered off in some non-specific direction, replaying in his head the few sentences Missouri had said about him. He was sensitive to magic. That actually explained a few things, but it didn’t mean he had to be happy about it. During the last two weeks there was more and more magic in his life and now it was also a part of him? He could be okay with imaginary friends, magic portals, dreameaters and witches, but this,
Luckily, the sheriff still wanted to check out the woods and see what their problem was. Apparently the police were so at a loss with the disappearances that they couldn’t allow themselves to ignore anything. Even if it sounded like a plot to a bad horror movie.
“Not really,” Dean shrugged. “Charlie and Jo, you know, the friends I was talking about, they’re hoping that
The door squeaked when Dean opened it, and he made a mental note to grease the hinges. All his belongings were already there, neatly packed in cardboard boxes stacked in a heap on the floor right behind the entrance. He left them there as they were, not wanting to unpack just yet.
He looked at the ceiling, his eyes focusing on the patch of mold. He wasn’t sure whether it was just his imagination or not, but it looked slightly bigger than a week ago. Another thing to take care of, right after fixing the falling out socket in the kitchen.
A wild howl echoed through the air, making Cas’ hair stand on end. Dean moved quickly in the sounds direction, signaling Cas to close in on the beast from the other side. Castiel nodded, his heart racing, and immediately followed Dean’s order.
“It was a dare!” Aiden explained. “My friends made me do it. Some people say there’s something wrong in the forest, but it’s not like anyone’s ever seen anything! I was supposed to check it out.”
“Hey, someone has to care about your well-being, you always forget about it.” She said jokingly, but Dean knew that she meant it.
“That’s. That’s great.” Dean tried to sound cheerful. “Um. Are Robin and Lisa still around?” He hoped he wouldn’t regret this too much. He’d probably meet them one way or another if they were there.
“Fine,” Dean agreed after a moment of silence. Spending the evening with a bunch of ghosts wasn’t exactly his idea of a good time; after all, people avoided them for a reason. The temperature always dropped too low around them, and they were inclined to pass through people. Sometimes it was an accident, but ghosts also just loved pissing people off. That said, if Castiel thought the two of them could have fun, maybe it wasn’t going to be that bad. “But if anyone fucks up our game with telekinesis or some other shit, it’s gonna be your fault.”
“The pleasure is ours, and all, but it would be good to finally get some real info about the portal. Because, you know, it’s a part of my house.” Dean had no idea how to act around royalty, and the princess intimidated him a little, but he decided to treat her just like he would everyone else. It was better than faking servility, and who cared if it was proper or not.
“Okay, Aiden. We’re going to help you get out of here, and nothing else is going to happen to you, I promise,” Dean reassured. It seemed to work to some extent, at least enough for Aiden to agree to follow them out of the forest.
A faint scratch came from under his bed. At first Dean thought that he imagined it, but the scratch came back after a few seconds, a little louder. After the third scratch he was completely sure that something was hiding in there. He just hoped it wasn’t another imaginary friend.
They left the same afternoon; the hunt wasn’t that far away and Dean wanted to get out for a few hours. Part of Castiel wished they were more like people who went to the cinema or to a restaurant when they wanted to get out of the house. He’d seen that a lot on TV. It would be nice to go out with Dean. He just wasn’t sure Dean would like that too.
They emptied their mugs and Dean shifted nervously. He came back with something more than just coffee.
As it turned out, finding a good place to eat before six a.m. was easier said than done. By the time they reached a diner that was miraculously both open and didn’t look like a biological threat, Dean had both developed a gaping black hole in his stomach, and started contemplating cannibalism. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten, but any date in this century sounded doubtful.
“No, we already discovered texting exists.” Castiel seemed very unimpressed, looking at the time on his phone. Right. Dean almost forgot they only had seven minutes and then they were done.
They wandered down one of the dirt paths, filling the air with jokes and light banter. That night they were explorers, adventurers on their next expedition, discovering mysteries of the unknown, leaving behind the safety of their homes for the uncharted wilderness of the local forest. They had prepared for this escapade for a long time, making sure they’d be able to sneak past their parents and meet at the outskirts of the town unnoticed, so that no one could turn them back. Now, safe from the eyes of the adults, they finally felt their journey had begun.
“Yes.” Charlie nodded, taking a seat on the opposite side of the table. Jo and Cas followed her example, taking two last seats, and leaving Dean to seat awkwardly on the arm of Cas’ armchair. “I keep conjuring toads when I get nervous and I don’t know how to stop it. It absolutely sucks,” Charlie continued.
“Did you stop sulking already?” Castiel asked, looking up from his book, his face blank, but there was something in his eyes that made Dean suspect he was laughing on the inside. Damn imaginary friends.
Castiel looked absently at the water. “In the middle of this forest grows the Heart. It’s old and powerful and it makes this place
Cas raised his eyebrows with a half-smile. “You need someone to check if there’s a monster under your bed?”
As soon as he was let free, the teenager tried to get up and run away, not even giving Dean and Cas a second glance.
“Dean should stay, but I’m an imaginary friend, nothing will happen to me,” Castiel persisted. “It’s my house and you could use an additional pair of hands.”
“You don’t mean that.” There was hurt in Dean’s voice. Cas wasn’t sure why; he was just trying to make it easier for both of them. Dean had to understand what was best for him.
The rest of the forest seemed to get back to normal, no more slime oozing from the trees, no more infected patches of the ground. And they saved a lot of lives that day. He repeated that to himself a lot. Somehow it didn’t make him feel much better.
“Hey, watch it! I don’t want any scenes here,” he said, glaring at Michael, and moving between him and Ruby. His muscles were tense.
Charlie lit the candles, one by one, and signaled to the three of them to take each other’s hands. Dean put his hand in Castiel’s, hyperaware of the touch. His stomach jolted happily, like this was the best thing in the whole world. He kicked himself mentally. Goddammit, he wasn’t a fucking teenager anymore, stuff like that shouldn’t happen to people his age. Everything had gotten worse after the night they’d almost kissed, and Dean was pretty sure his body was doing its best to ignore his decision not to act on his feelings. Fuck, he didn’t need that. He just hoped it would stop before Castiel noticed anything.
“Uh, I hope so?” she said, a note of uncertainty in her voice. “Hi, I’m Charlie, and I’m a witch.” A witch. Great. At this point Dean should’ve expected something like that. It didn’t explain what she was doing on his doorstep though, so he just raised his eyebrows, prompting her to continue.
They didn’t talk much after that, waiting for their orders to arrive. They were lulled by the sounds of soft music coming from the speakers, and the clinking of the plates from the kitchen. Exhaustion settled back in. Forming words and saying them out loud required too much mental effort. Cas kept himself occupied tracing a simple sigil etched in the table surface, his fingers moving slowly. From what Dean could tell it didn’t do anything interesting, just a careless scribble one of the patrons must’ve left at some point. Castiel’s fingers were still distracting though, enough to disturb Dean’s daydream about the memory foam mattress waiting for him at home. He ended up stealing glances of Cas, an affectionate warmth spreading through his chest every time.
“I wish I was.” Dean massaged his brow. “Before you say anything, I’m all right. And I have some news, but it can wait until I get back.”
of our friends that year, we dealt as much as we could and lived on. But I’m curious why you’re here now.”
Henry Winchester’s money was dwindling quickly and Dean hoped that the bed and breakfast would be profitable enough to keep them afloat. Charlie had suggested advertising it in magical communities around the city and on the internet, to keep the guests coming. Hopefully it would work. And Dean could always take a part-time job as a mechanic if things didn’t work out as planned, so for once, he didn’t have to worry about the future that much. But he was going to worry anyway.
Then there was Becky, a lively girl who kept talking about fanfiction. It would be a lie to say Dean hadn’t been reading anything himself, but she was so intense that he suspected sharing any opinions with her would lead to an actual fistfight. Not to mention the first thing she’d said to him had been that he was too short for her. He’d barely stopped himself from an offended snort. He wasn’t
“So what?” he spat angrily. “I told them that this wasn’t going to affect my work on the case and now I’m doing everything to prove myself wrong.”
“Hey, Cas, look at this!” he called, glancing in Castiel’s direction. Cas stood near the trees, unmoving. “Cas?” He didn’t react. Dean walked over to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Cas, are you okay?”
“I can think of something,” Dean offered. “Like, have you seen any humans here recently? Or anyone at all, for that matter?”
Anything Cas had to say in response to that was swallowed by his enormous yawn, cutting the conversation short.
The forest was like every other forest he’d ever been to. And he was okay with forests in general - he wouldn’t have become a hunter if he wasn’t. But this was different. This was his childhood nightmare. Discovering that in reality it looked so
“Dean, Castiel, welcome,” Gilda greeted them. “Old Grove hasn’t seen travelers like you for a very long time. Thank you for bringing them here, Joanna.” She nodded at Jo.
“I’m also a guardian. From the other side,” Jo explained, her voice unwavering, even though her face was white as a sheet.
“I think we might’ve found some photos of her in the house.” Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Do you know why she stopped?”
Cas scratched his beard. “I wish we knew more about the previous guardian,” he said. “I’ve tried looking for information, but the only thing I’ve found so far is that she died in a car crash years ago.” Castiel had gotten pretty interested in Josie Sands over the last few weeks, making a few trips to the local library to go through old papers, and apparently it had paid off to some extent. Dean was curious about the past guardian too, but he decided to leave the whole thing for Cas. He seemed to enjoy turning into a detective a lot more than Dean would.
The library was quiet and almost empty, just a few people milling around between the bookshelves. The librarian gave Dean a weird look when he asked if they had any books about imaginary friends, and pointed him to the fantasy section, which obviously was no help. After an hour of searching all Dean had found was a questionable guidebook for concerned parents and some pamphlets for children, nothing of real value.
“Okay, fine,” Sam sighed. “I guess a bed and breakfast is a good thing. But those people you have here? They all look… not right. There is something off about them. Not to mention I could swear I saw a talking cat when I was on the front porch. And why the hell there was a toad reading a book on the couch?” He didn’t hold back for sure.
He shivered. The room was cold and the only source of heat was Cas’ warm body lying next to him. They had lit the fireplace the previous evening, but the fire must’ve gone out during the night.
Lisa opened almost as soon as he rang the doorbell. Her hair was a lot longer than it had been where Dean knew her. She had bags under her eyes, and her face was pale. He could see that she was worried out of her mind about her son. Suddenly he felt completely out of place. It was one thing to talk to strangers in situations like this one, it was the other to talk to someone he once knew.
He fell asleep sometime later, lulled by the pitter-patter of the rain that fell steadily on the motel roof. A blond-haired woman smiled to him in his dreams, stretching out her arms, waiting for him to come closer. He stood just out of her reach, unable to move, his legs made of lead. A word was stuck in his throat, making him retch and cough spasmodically. “Mom,” he finally whispered. She didn’t seem to hear.
They were in the middle of a meadow, not too far from the forest. Dean gave the woods an automatic glance. He wouldn’t be too surprised if at some point the slime decided to crawl out of it and spread further in the Oak Mill direction. They’d checked how far it had moved in the last few days an hour before. It didn’t look like it was going to make a trip to the town any time soon, but who knew.
Dean listened him without a word. Cas took the knife and began to gently cut the cocoon open. Seconds later there was a sleeping hedgehog in his hand.
“You know what, I think I’m into nap dates,” he said, brushing his hand through Cas’ hair, and stealing a short kiss. God, it felt so good to be able to do this.
“Cas, why are we here?” he asked, unconsciously taking a step back. “Because, sorry to break it to you, but this is probably the worst place you could choose to tell me anything. Well, except those parts of the forest that eat people.”
Dean groaned. “Well, I hope that this was enough to make you stay away from here in the near future,” he said grimly. Something in his stomach turned. It felt a little too close to home for his comfort.
Jo took the keys and smiled brightly. “By the way, I hope that later you’ll share some embarrassing stories about Dean with us.”
“Because Jo has too much pride to call, and calling your almost-father-in-law is pretty awkward,” Charlie explained.
“Shit.” Dean brushed a hand through his hair. “Shit. I’m sorry.” Now he saw that the ground beneath the trees was already changed, the roots bathed in the dark slime. “We should probably hurry with looking around. I don’t want to stay long enough to have a repeat of yesterday.”
Nothing happened for a long while, leaving Castiel restless. The air felt damp and heavy, the heat of the day still present despite the late hour. The beast was nowhere to be seen. Time dragged unbelievably slowly, almost like the whole forest around them was closed in a bubble of frozen time. It was something that always surprised Cas since he lost his grace — human lives used to seem so short, passing in a flash, and yet there was still place for moments like this, moments when everything felt like it was taking longer than it should.
the guy, which was a little absurd, given that he barely knew him. And that Cas was a forest spirit who apparently liked to scare people by silently appearing behind them.
“Dean, shut up,” Cas almost growled, squeezing his hand. “I don’t regret this,” he said, his voice sincere. “And I’m not going anywhere. I love you.”
In some places they were sinking ankle-deep in dark red slime, having to put extra effort in every step. In others it was hard to see bark on the trunks under the substance covering them. The stench was unbelievable.
Not sure what to do with himself for the rest of the night, he reached for his laptop. There should be a Star Trek DVD in the drive, left over from when he’d watched it with Charlie. Dean smiled, thinking about her. Maybe he should just go somewhere with Jo and Charlie and relax. They both had an unique ability to lighten him up.
“Okay that’s fair,” Dean agreed, and took a deep breath. “Look, I want things to be okay between us, but I’m not sure how I feel about everything else.” He laughed nervously. “The corridor probably isn’t the best place to talk about it.”
“You also need to care more of the plants you already have, Dean. Your dracaena is almost dead.” Cas’ voice was so disapproving that Dean decided he wouldn’t be able to dream that.
“Come on, we’re making pie today,” Dean announced as soon as he entered the kitchen in the morning. Cas was already there, sitting at the table with a book and a cup of coffee. He usually was still in bed when Dean ate his breakfast, but today Dean was late, having trouble falling back asleep and sleeping in as a result. He hadn’t made any specific plans for the day so it wasn’t a big deal, but it still made him feel wrong somehow, like he’d let himself down.
Early morning found Dean making his way to the woods through the damp grass. Alone. Jo and Charlie were going to be furious. He wasn’t exactly sure what he was doing. He tried not to think too much about the last time he’d been there, but the memories forced their way into his mind, leaving him with images he wished had stayed forgotten.
terrible, it was just that with every new person the feeling that he didn’t want to be there grew stronger, until it became a persistent thought in his head.
They’re going to have to leave. He’s going to have to leave Haven for good. Shit. Well, it’s a lot better than death, but still. Not something he ever expected to happen.
Dean let out a long breath, rubbing his face. “Thanks Charlie. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Someone had to take care of the whole mess while Dean was losing his head worrying about Cas. He was glad Charlie was there, keeping her finger on the pulse of the whole situation.
“I think I can help with that,” Charlie said with a smile. “I’ve been hacking since I was ten, so creating new identities for you shouldn’t be a problem.” Dean raised his brow. So not only was Charlie a witch, but also a hacker. The more you know, and all that.
Dean adjusted on the table. “Yeah yeah, let’s just get this over with. I want to be me again, dammit.”
Behind the closed door of his bedroom Dean stood, shocked by what just happened, and embarrassed that Cas caught them. It was going to be a long three days, and even longer rest of their lives. Part of him was ashamed, ashamed of what they had done, even though it felt right. Right, but off. Dean had always felt something different for Sam, a feeling that he knew he shouldn’t have. His heart fluttered when Sam was near, he tried for years to ignore it.
Sam took a deep breath. “So, Rowena said she knows a reversal spell, but she needs to do it in person.”
Dean stepped forward, Sam grabbed him by the waist and lifted him up and onto his lap. Dean felt Sam’s cock under him as it rubbed against his wet pussy. Sam reached down and positioned his cock at Dean’s entrance. He looked up at Dean, and asked if he was okay.
Sam and Cas stood there while Dean was still seated on the bed. Just looking at anything but each other. They all knew what they were thinking. This curse was pulling them to Dean. Pulling them to want to lay with him and taste him. Cas and Sam’s mind lingered on the fantasies in their heads. Sam knew there was no turning back at this point. But Cas wasn’t sure what he was to do.
Sam got up and went to them. He took off Castiel’s coat and suit jacket. Dean began to help and undressed Cas the rest of the way before turning to Sam to help him as well. Soon the three of them were naked, hard and ready.
Cas shook his head and left the room. Sam and Dean got dressed in silence. Not knowing what to say to one another. They should regret what just happened, but neither one of them did.
Dean closed his eyes and pressed his lips against Rowena’s. He was gentle, parting her lips with his tongue before sliding it in. She kissed him back, taking his kiss in deeper. Her eyes fluttered shut, letting the taste of Dean overwhelm her.
Sam had long desired to taste Dean, and reached up to wrap his fingers around his brother’s length. Licking his lips slightly he wrapped them around the head, swirling his tongue and flicking the slit. Dean let out a slight gasp at Sam’s touch.
Sam got on the bed behind Cas and grabbed the bottle. Cas positioned himself for Sam, who began to rub the outside of his hole before plunging two fingers into him stretching him open. Soon Sam pulled out and replaced his fingers with his own cock. Cas moaned as Sam pushed into him to the base. He made Cas push deeper into Dean as well.
Pulling back the covers he gave himself a look. He was himself again. Quickly he got up and went to the mirror over the sink in the room. He saw himself, the real self. Smiling, he was overjoyed to see himself again.
They laid like that, embracing each other for a while as Sam and Dean fell asleep. Cas got up after some time and covered the two in the blanket that had been pushed to the end of the bed. He grabbed his clothes and left the room making his way to the showers. He didn’t sleep and a whole night in bed could get uncomfortable for him.
Dean took a moment before replying, “No. I mean, I do want things to be normal again, for me to be normal. But we, we don’t have to go back to how we were before. We can continue. Cas as well.”
Dean woke up, thankful it was the last day of the curse. Rowena would be here, hopefully. He wanted it to be over with. He loved the sex, he was Dean Winchester after all. But knowing that the curse was affecting Sam and Cas, even if it was nice, was hard.
Dean dropped to his knees and took Cas in his mouth. His lips stretched over the angel’s large cock. Sam began to stroke his own as he watched his brother take Castiel’s cock down to the base. Dean stopped and turned his attention to Sammy and began to do the same.
Dean stood under the hot water in the shower. Letting the water rain down on his body, he washed his hair and body. He felt better now that he was himself again. The water washed away the past three days, letting him feel new again.
Dean looked over and smirked as he noticed the bulge in Sam’s pants. Sam’s face turned red as he tried to hide it.
Finally it was over. Breathing heavily he removed his hand from his boxers. His vision has become blurred and the light bothered him. Blinking several times to bring it back he realized what he had just done. He didn’t know it felt that good.
“I’m kinda hot though, right?” Dean stated more than asked. His smile was wide and it was so clearly Dean’s smile.
Pouring the contents of the bowl into a glass, Rowena handed it to Dean. The hunter took it and downed it in some gulp. It tasted sour, and he had trouble keeping it down, but he managed. Sam and Cas watched Dean, curious as to whether or not there would be any immediate effects. But there was none to be seen.
Dean came hard, his legs shook, stomach rolled and his back arched. His eyes rolled back as he let out a muffled yell. Cas stood up, his cock already out and pants pulled down to his ankles. The angel quickly pushed his cock into Dean’s hole, stretching him out. Like Sam, Cas didn’t hold back.
Sam watched Dean out of the corner of his eye. Watching the way his chest rose and fell, his now long hair and how it flowed with the curve of his neck. His smaller, more feminine features. Dean was right, he was hot. Dean took a drink of his beer and Sam couldn’t help but let his thoughts race watching him wrap his lips around the top of the bottle, and wondered how it would look to see those same lips wrapped around his cock. His cock swelled at the thought.
Cas pounded into him harder. He played with Dean’s nipples with one hand, pinching, twisting and tugging on them. His other hand was positioned so that his thumb was pressed against his clit. He circled and pressed Dean’s throbbing clit, sending him over the edge more. Dean clenched around Cas, his pussy pulsating as he continued to come.
But the fact that Sam was his little brother, he practically raised him, it felt wrong. But Dean didn’t want it to. He wanted it to feel right. Part of him was disappointed that they finally did something together when he was in this body. He wanted Sam to touch him, his real body. He hoped that after these three days Sam would still look at him the same.
Cas pulled back from the kiss, never losing momentum in his powerful thrust. Dean’s eyes were shut tight, lips parted as he lost himself to his orgasm. It was building and building until it consumed him.
The younger hunter didn’t want to take things slow and gentle. He wanted to fuck his brother’s mouth. He grabbed a fistful of Dean’s long hair, wrapping it around his fingers before gripping the back of his head. Dean knew what he was going to do, and he wanted it more than anything.
“I’m fairly certain your life isn’t going to be exactly normal. Castiel here told me what you boys decided last night,” stated Rowena.
The three exploded together in an intense orgasm. Sam slowed his speed, letting out every last drop of his seed spill into Dean’s hole. When he pulled out Dean lifted up enough to release Cas’ cock from his flooded pussy.
He knew that it was wrong, Dean was his brother, his own flesh and blood. But he was drawn to him like this. Deep down he always sorta had a crush on Dean, and he always pushed it aside. Thinking that it was just due to them being together all the time for all these years, they only ever had each other. Sam had figured out that he was most likely bisexual years ago at Stanford, but never pursued anything.
He couldn’t help but moan loudly. He gave up caring that Sam could probably hear him. And in the back of his mind, he hoped that Sam did. Ignoring how wrong that was he moved his hand faster and faster until it once again became too sensitive. He pushed past it and kept going. His pussy was wetter and wetter. His stomach curled within itself, trembling, his thighs shook, he felt like he had no control over his body.
He couldn’t believe that he not only slept with his best friend but also his own brother. It should have made him sick, but it oddly didn’t. He felt off, like he should be appalled at this fact, every fiber of his being was telling him he shouldn’t enjoy it. But he was, and he wanted more of it. More of them, of Sam, of Cas. He needed them. Inside of him.
Rowena smiled, “Well of course. Have you seen yourself? Like this and normally? I have thought about you in such a manner on several occasions. No shame there, Dean Winchester.”
The two sat in silence while Dean finished his coffee. He could feel Cas’ eyes on him. He let his mind wander to the night before. The feeling of the angel’s cock in his pussy, the way Cas’ hands explored his body, the taste of his angelic seed. He felt his body shift, and a desire, a need, arise.
The two laid there, in each other arms for a good while. Neither one of them said a word. Finally Sam spoke again.
Soon Dean was ready to cum again, but he tried to hold it off, he wanted the three of them to cum together. Cas moaned he was close, Sam replied in a husky voice that he was too. Sam pounded into Dean’s ass fiercely, causing Cas to go over the edge.
Dean let out a small gasping moan as he felt Sam’s tongue plunge into his wet lips, parting them and going up towards his throbbing clit. Sam’s tongue danced and swirled with precision. Dean tasted amazing. Dean tried to stay silent, but the moans escaped his lips against his will, his eyes rolled back and he let his body relax.
Cas spread Dean’s legs, exposing his pussy, already wet with arousal. The angel dropped to his knees, his desire to taste him was overwhelming. Dean was already soaking wet as Cas ran his tongue up, starting at the entrance, ending with a flick to his swollen clit.
Soon it was late, and those who slept were getting tired. Castiel retired elsewhere in the bunker, finding a quiet spot to settle down and read some books from the library. Rowena said her good nights and made her way to one of the many rooms. Sam and Dean remained seated at the table.
Cas leaned down and crashed his lips into Dean’s. Licking and sucking on his tongue, muffling the moans Dean was making. He let some of his grace slip through and into Dean, making his pussy throb with pleasure. Fucking an angel did have its perks after all.
After several minutes the coffee pot was ready and Dean got up to pour himself a cup. Sam came in, his hair still wet and brushed back. Dean set his mug down and poured a second for Sam before handing it to him.
The three stayed in bed for another moment. Savoring the moment in each other’s arms. Dean wanted this to last forever. He looked at his brother then at the angel. He was happy, truly happy.
Dean came hard, his hips began to move on their hold. He tightened his grip on his brother’s head and plowed into his throat. He filled Sam’s mouth with his come, Sam couldn’t swallow it all even thought he tried to. It spilled out around his lips as he continued to bob his head, taking Dean all the way in.
Soon Dean was coming once again. His screams of pleasure were muffled by the huge, throbbing cock being slammed into his throat. The feeling of his moaning vibrated on Sam’s length, causing him to come. He slammed harder and faster, the tearing streaming down his brother’s face. He filled Dean’s mouth with his come, overflowing it causing a bit to leak out.
“It’s new for me, ya know. I know what to do when it comes to women, not for when it comes to me being a woman.”
“I came in here to ask if you were feeling okay. You haven't come out in some time and we are getting worried. The potion can have an ill effect, making you feel a bit under the weather.”
Not far away Dean sat on his own bed, sitting upright yet relaxed against the headboard. His pants were thrown on the floor next to the bed along with his boots.
