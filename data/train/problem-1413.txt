“Yes”
He reached for another glass.
Mycroft ran a hand down over his face.
That alone halts Sherlock’s deduction for a minute.
He strokes his finger up towards the white face of the clock and it remains perfectly solid.
When the evening comes, John has watched the news on the television, showered, and eaten a light snack. He changes into pajamas and goes to bed. He lies there for some time staring into the darkness, his eyes wide open, and Sherlock wonders so what he is thinking about.
If not Moriarty had got himself interested in Sherlock, they probably would never have met. Moriarty’s net expanded all over Europe with branches like smoke gusts sneaking their way to all the other continents. Sherlock had always kept track of all the crimes he could ever read about, but rarely had had any first-hand access to cases not handled by Scotland Yard, and Lestrade, which narrowed it down considerably. Therefore, it was all possible that he never would have seen there was a net at all. Sometimes contemplated it, naturally, his mind always trying to make connections that while improbable still were not impossible; but Moriarty was Moriarty. Part of the disguise was the range of businesses the man had kept going: Moriarty too had invented his job himself. He had kept himself going in all fields that made money.
The noise was torn from his throat, and a fat, ugly finger was turned upon my face , but I would not be silent now, I would have the damned bastard exposed.
“Why did you stop…it was…good”
John jumped off the bed and approached me, tired of watching the sport and yet having no part, and setting his hands at my waist from behind he pulled me back and spun me round to face him wrenching me from the arms of my pretty young partner to crash our bodies together with intent. Sarah flopped down on the chaise at her side and laughed at my indignant cries, when in parody John twirled and spun and cavorted about the room, I, cast in the roll of the maid, condemned but to follow his farcical attempt. Exhausted and breathless with laughter, we fell back upon the bed and Sarah stirred, brushing off her skirts and setting her cap to rights. She cleared her throat to be heard, for we were lost now, as I melted into the touch of his hand against my cheek, gazing into eyes of an unfathomable blue depth.
“Hello Sherlock, how are you, haven’t seen you in ages” Charlotte gushed.
“Leaving already? I must say I’m deeply offended”.
It was all he had. It would have to work.
Greg paused to pull off t-shirt and push down pyjamas, kicking them off impatiently as his fingers unbuttoned the expensive designer shirt with devastating speed, unwrapping his prize, sucking mercilessly on a soft pink nipple and biting as the blood began to pound in Mycroft’s ears.
She paused and took a drag, tilting her head back to blow it out again and wiped her sleeve across her eyes, “But you just had to go and fuck it up though, didn’t you?”
John dragged me away with that parting shot to the sound of her incredulous snorts. “She was a whore Sherlock, they flock here in droves…for what is the price of a ticket compared to payment for a fuck or two with some rich, drunken fool?”
What the actual fuck? They had kids. With flower names. He knew they’d got married, about two months after he’d left school. There were a lot of snarky comments floating around at the time, how Mr Watson knocked-up the English Lit teacher and married her in a quickie wedding before the bump started to show, and if that was true then he must have been shagging her before he left which meant….Fuck.
“What are you thinking?” he gasped.
She turned away, dropping a slight curtsey to John before she left, beckoned by her ladyship to join the other ladies in the parlour while the men retired to the study to drink port and smoke cigars. I cared for neither, too young for such pursuits and felt every single year that I lacked as I sat, most disgruntled, amidst such boisterous, masculine company.
We crept most carefully to the door of her bedchamber and settled in silence behind two sash doors the glass of which was obscured by yellow damask curtains, drawn closed. The merest crack remained in the middle revealing the full aspect of the room to any watchful eye standing without while allowing the watcher to remain hidden from view, or so I fervently hoped. Within, the main event had yet to take place.
“So…”
‘I confess it, the soft curves and breasts of a woman are but a half-empty glass in a desert, your thirst is slaked but for a short time while you are slowly dying for want of more’
Mr Watson had taught his lesson well.
He reached for the lube on the mattress beside him, squeezing out a generous amount, the more the better this time, stroking the extra around John’s entrance before pushing one finger inside.
It was the mocking tone, the sheer arrogant belief that they had John beat, that he couldn’t take them on, that he was too weak. But last night…they had held a knife to his back and kicked the shit out of him too and here he was, despite their best efforts, still standing, and he would never, ever let anyone make him feel so vulnerable again.
Sherlock’s pale eyes glittered in the dark interior as he and John bumped shoulders with every jerk and sway. Only John could see, tucked away in the back like this, away from prying eyes, the violent shivers that overtook him every now and then as his body betrayed him, posture unnaturally tense as he struggled within himself in a defiant battle for self-control.
What a spectacularly dull name, Sherlock thought.
Sherlock sighed and curled his own arms around John’s waist and pulled him close, feeling the adrenaline pumping through John’s system, whole body poised for fight or flight.
She squeezed her eyes tight shut and prayed to a deity she so desperately wanted to believe in “Please god, help me…help me find them”.
“Keep your voice down for god’s sake” he hissed, eyeing the D.I nervously, “they are not my dealer’s, either of them. The one on the bed tried to push some at Newcross the night we played there but John got me out of it and we ran…the rest of it, after, doesn’t matter”.
It took a moment for John to realise that somewhere along the line, the shorts had come off.
I would write you on my body. Where would you like to be?
“For god’s sake John I know that’s you standing there, the way you breathe is so bloody annoying”
“What the fuck are you doing?”
The stupid annoying git looked even more ridiculous than usual as he attempted (and failed) to look cool, smoking one of father’s Cuban cigars. He was irritatingly smug in the knowledge that he would not be the one forced to let a perfect stranger sleep in his bed,( not that anyone would want to anyway)
He shouldn't have called, left the past where it belonged. Picking at old wounds never did end well.
“It is my grandmother,” he said at last, with a sigh, “She is taken gravely ill and asks that I go to her.” He crumpled the letter in his fist. “If she…,” he started, searching for a way to continue, eyes darting, “If she dies Sherlock, before I see her….if I thought for one second that I have been the cause of this….”
“You know I would not leave you, not for any pretty young maid…nothing compares you must know that? Tell me you know that or I cannot be happy, truly I cannot…please Sherlock”. He crawled across the bed towards me and caught me up again, pitching me forward, and so we fell back down and I lay as he pinned me a wrist each side of my head and smothered my body with kiss after kiss, laying a burning, wet trail.
… into the bargain”
It was all like a bad dream, the air thick around him like time had slowed down and he was wading through some twilight world that made no sense at all. He’d walked back to the room, harms full of snacks from the machine, knowing he’d been gone longer than he’d said, but didn’t think it mattered at the time, because it really didn’t, did it? Now he wasn’t so sure, his mind racing back over the past ten minutes and wondering how the hell things had all gone to shit so fast.
“You could’ve just said you know…that you’ve never done it before, instead of half choking yourself….here, sit up, I want to try something….I think it’ll be more your cup of tea somehow…open your mouth…I promise I won’t bite…much”
“The truth then,” he crowed, “You wish to fleece him of more coin with your filthy whore’s tricks! I would see you in hell before you touch my son again, slut. You will not see him, fool that he is. I bid you both leave.” He was red about the face and neck by this time, and thick veins bulged out at his temples.
‘There, and now we are the best of friends are we not?’ he asked fondly, ‘now you kiss me Sherlock so I should know we are truly as brothers’.
“Can I see you again?”
“As are you”, he returned. The devilish smile that made my cock twitch played on his face as we stared at one another, inflamed by our daring and much as I wished to chastise, I could not, only wishing I were brave, so that I might take his mouth again.
But John was here again, in front of him and he looked so incredibly good. It took all Sherlock’s strength not to march over and take him right there, pushed up against the door…
Sherlock surfaced from trance-like state with a jolt, hand skimming over the pocket of his jeans where the shape of his phone stood out clearly. His eyes snapped back to Irene, focusing clearly now.
The boy glared at me, did not answer but thrust forward his outstretched palm, and John sighed beside me and dug out a silver sixpence from the pocket of his waistcoat, holding it out between thumb and forefinger. The boy reached out and John snatched it away from his grasp and cocked an eyebrow meaningfully. “Ere beggin your pardon guv’nor”, he gave a sarcastic half- bow to us both, “I didn’t mean nuffink by it”.
He felt spacy and blissed out as John stroked and soothed, working down his spine with soft tender kisses unaware of his evil intent.
“Then you’re an idiot Victor….he could fix it so you never even existed”
“I should make you do it” Sherlock shot him a dark look over his shoulder “half of it is yours after all”.
handsome how could I possibly say no?
“You good now? Better?” Greg clapped a hand to his shoulder and he nodded weakly, not even bothering to puzzle why Mycroft of all people carried his own personal supply of double malt whiskey, but thankful tonight that he did.
“A bit nippy for you at the beach then?” he said, because how did you start this conversation anyway? Can we hop back on the bed and finish what we started because you really got it all wrong and I desperately want to see you with your pants off?
“Are you going to tell him? I think not….the evil predator who defiled his baby brother? They’d be pulling your cold dead corpse out of the Thames by the end of the week”.
If John could not come to me then I would have to go to him - but I could not go there alone.
“Then no”
“Mama doesn’t think like that, she see’s a boy who helped her son…that’s all she needs to know…is that a problem? Should we treat you appallingly and with contempt simply because of a mere accident of birth?”
I blushed at the truth of his words and he stifled my moan with his free hand clamped against my mouth, sweeping his other along the length of my cock; I arched helplessly into his touch, already grown stiff and pulsating with heat. It was such an exquisite torture. He had been like this for many days, at any moment whether opportune or otherwise he cared not for any consequence, seeking the comfort of my body like a man possessed. Light touches on the arm or the length of my thigh in a carriage, caresses upon my cheek, dragging my head to the side to mouth at my neck and mark the skin a dark purple beneath the silk of my cravat. It was unseemly, debauched and desperate he would fall upon his knees in front of me in the darkness of an alley as we made our way home in the early evening gloom, head bobbing and sucking me down in earnest while all I could do was grip firmly at the hair on the crown of his head whilst I shivered to my completion between his lips.
Sherlock wants to fist the front of that perfectly pressed shirt until the sweat from his palms moulds it into a criss-cross of shattered lines…chaos.
“Well I must say you had a small stroke of luck when you met my son today, let me introduce myself, I’m Doctor William Holmes, Physician, of Harley Street”
“Give it here”, John said, kneeling down to join him and taking it out of his hand, “Mike slept on this last summer when his grandma broke her hip and his mum said she had to have his bedroom…I think I can remember how it works”.
His age shouldn’t matter, it was less than two years, but he was thinking in terms of relationships while she still thought he was just a friend, even so it should still be irrelevant.
Sherlock blinked rapidly a few times as the fresh onslaught of alcohol blurred his senses, squinting his eyes to focus on the people who had just arrived. David….somebody…unimportant, insignificant, and Amanda bloody Jeffries…oh god. His head darted from side to side looking for a suitable escape route. It was a party, he was fairly sure he was drunk which almost guaranteed that she would corner him at some point and make a second attempt to stick her tongue down his throat. Only his lightning fast reflexes had saved him last time, and in his current state he no longer be able to rely on those. Maybe he should just cut his losses and go home, or, he could just hope for the best and keep his head down. Sherlock went for option two, not wanting to offend John when he had only been here for half an hour. Jesus, how can you go from zero to pissed in such a short space of time? Inexperience? Unusually low tolerance to alcohol? Probably a bit of both. He was smugly satisfied that John looked annoyed too, disappearing into the kitchen to fetch some more cups, even though Sherlock was sure he didn’t know about the near miss with her lips that had occurred only minutes before John’s car had pulled up in the drive. Interesting, Amanda wasn’t strictly an invitee, just tagging along with David who used to play Sunday League football with John. Not welcome then, but Sherlock knew that John would be much too polite to kick her out.
“A gin and tonic John dear if you don’t mind, make it a large”.
“Cause I wanted to…its nice…kissing, that is”
“Left here I think” he said, leading the way.
men - whatever that was supposed to mean.
The door closed.
Sherlock sucked in a shaky breath, his pulse raced with fear and excitement at what he had just dared to do “because while you were beaten half to death that night… you already know I got high…but I also got off with my ex”
John briefly considered the possibility of some weird sort of Men In Black shit before he had a moment realisation.
As if either of them really had a choice.
This story was inspired Frank Capra's incomparable 'It's A Wonderful Life' starring James Stewart.
The men’s room was warm and brightly lit with wide fluorescent strip-lights and back-lit mirrors for the preening patrons. Sherlock backed himself into the far corner between wall and the sinks, the automatic hand dryer burst into life and he flinched and moved closer to John, leaning against the vanity unit, brow furrowed.
“One more for the road?”
He stepped into the drawing room just as John came through the door, shucking off his jacket, eyes darting around awestruck as he took in his surroundings. Sherlock was sure his heart stopped beating for a second. Really, it must have done.
He smiled, ‘Do not stop on my account, I would dearly love to look upon your face again as you spill for it is a beautiful sight’.
Sherlock turned away without waiting for an answer, and John shook his head, laughing a little to himself. So, Sherlock
John waited just long enough to check he was really alone, then stripped off the rest of his filthy kit and showered quickly. Giving barely a cursory swipe with the towel he dressed and stuffed his kit in his bag and checked that the corridor had cleared before moving off again.
“Ask first”
“Yes”, the doctor stuttered, taking the chart from the hook at the end of the bed and flipping over the sheets that were pinned there, paper in rainbow colours reducing Sherlock to facts ,figures and chemical compositions on a page, “very common occurrence, short term memory loss, although we can’t rule out a psychological basis at this point from the traumatic nature of the attack rather than the severity of the actual injury per se”. He looked up, smugly satisfied with his professional assessment to see Sherlock rolling his eyes in irritation and Mycroft looking bored, examining his fingernails. The confident expression faded in an instant.
The second time was better, and moisture being all in these acts I did not mind so much the drizzle of my own spit as it ran down my chin, bobbing my head a little as he had done and taking in breath through my nose. My jaw ached, stretched wide to splitting point and the touch of John’s hands upon my head pushing down gently at the crown forced an unholy amount to jerk down my throat and choke the very air from me. I gagged a little and pulled away, this was not how I had imagined it to be, so very taxing and uncomfortable in nature, and though I knew what pleasure he had brought me I was not fit for the task and could not do the same.
(‘it has three tines John, it’s a fucking trident not a fork’), nostrils stinging at the pungent aroma from copious amounts of malt vinegar and salt. He should at least be thankful that Sherlock had held off from berating the poor manager about his appalling idea of an amusing pun.
He wasn’t kidding either. John hovered nervously outside to keep watch and minutes later Sherlock emerged carrying two training brooms from the storage cupboard.
“Yes Sir…
He could feel him, his erection pressed hard against his arse, and he moaned, squeezing his legs even tighter around John’s body, cheeks flushed with the rush of arousal.
He risked a glance and wished he hadn’t, Sherlock just looked so far away, staring out across the rooftop at the grey cloudy sky.
“Er right, erm….I’ll just leave now…shall I?....you guys obviously have a lot to talk about…erm…catch you later John mate”. He turned to leave.
“Then go to her,” I said in earnest, sitting up, sheets pooled around my waist, “Put your mind, and hers at ease.” At the next my voice was more hesitant, “And if you are amenable, please impress upon your father that I bear him no ill will…. and perhaps we may yet make amends with him. Is it not beyond hope that he might yet see reason?”
“What?”
At the risk of annoying Mycroft even more he chose to ask the obvious again. “But how come you didn’t know about the cameras earlier?”
“How do you think? Full, very full….oh I don’t know….like having a seven inch cock up my arse”.
He got a grunt in return, probably as much as he could expect.
“We should leave this for his parents to deal with… whatever it is that’s wrong, it’s not our place John”
Sherlock was sitting up again, crowding his space as he leaned forward expectant, smiling when John sat up a little, muzzy headed and rested his left hand on Sherlock’s waist for balance. His palm connected with skin which erupted in goose-flesh under his fingertips.
It was a slow tease, the tension in the air palpable as John worked his cock through the fabric of his underwear, thumbing over the glans and spreading the leaking pre-come down the shaft while using his free hand to undo his belt and pull the zip down to free him.
“I am not your father, but by god I should tan your sorry hide…what on earth possessed you?”
John shuffled past and shot Sherlock an anxious look which told him that he definitely did understand what was really going on.
Sherlock nodded, wandering over to his bedroom door and turning to wait as John stood and walked across the space towards him. His palms were sweating, the only outward sign of nerves as he ushered him silently in and closed the door behind them, blocking Greg’s view when he craned his neck to peek inside.
“Of course you do”, John smiled into his skin, cupping his chin with one hand and slowly kissing him. Sherlock couldn’t make sense of it. Victor’s touch, in fact any of the men had had been with in the recent past had left him cold and empty inside, unsatisfied. None of them had even come close to…whatever the hell this was. Even to his own ears he sounded desperate and he flushed.
“It finished eighteen months ago, I hadn’t seen or heard from him since….until last night, but I didn’t see the message until we…I…got up”
Constable Lestrade sheds light on a mystery and John is summoned home.
I watched wide-eyed as he pushed two fingers to my parted lips and commanded that I suck upon them: and how could I refuse? I knew enough about the practise to realise just how he would use them and that compliance would be to my benefit, but could not have foreseen the sensual nature of the task. I rolled my tongue around his fingers, sucked and licked up and down between the cracks until he drew them out again, glistening and wet with my own saliva. Their destination I already knew, and the warm press of a slick, soaked digit at my entrance confirmed it to be true as first he gentled me with kisses and praise circling softly as I relaxed once more beneath him. I breathed deeply, great lungfuls sucked in through my nose and out, mouth pressed into a tight line, determined not to shoot off like a tom-cat as I had the first time as I braced myself for pain. But none came, just a mild sting at the stretch as he finally penetrated the borders, the passage eased by the slick that I had supplied, and once I had relaxed my rigid grip upon his arms, he began to move them in and out slowly at first and then more rapid, pausing at times to add another. He kept me there, suspended for what felt like an eternity as he pushed and probed and fucked me with his hand, and on each outward pull he drew across a place within which had me crying out in ecstasy at the touch. It was almost too much, this mastery over my senses, cruel and magnificent and I cried out once more as I felt my body tense, wits gone, near incoherent.
The plan had not, in any version, contained him being strangled to death on a dark, scruffy backstreet in Copenhagen, of all the cities to die in.
Well of course, they realised; from the distance, the tall, dark figure of Sherlock looming over much shorter and fairer John in such a secluded place: it was easy to presume he was held at a disadvantage. (Surely, as if John couldn’t have disarmed Sherlock in at least a dozen different ways in less than three moves, Sherlock could recall his own dry thoughts.)
Sherlock remains where he is, starts to breathe again – not that he needs the oxygen, and that’s probably just as well – and feels how his body, limb by limb, relaxes, even though he never realized that he had gone rigid. He rests a hand on the doorframe, solid, painted wood, cool to his touch, and then his head and his shoulder too. He feels exhausted, drained, almost boneless and he closes his eyes to John, his John, the living room, this flat with its own rules of existence, and trembles when he lets go of a long breath.
“Right then, better ring the guys, looks like its boy’s out again, you owe me Watson, and anyway, at least one of us deserves to get our leg over tonight”.
“Sherlock, did that bloke….that creep…did he touch you?” John whispered nervously as the interior of the cab was bathed in flashes of colour and light, moving through the busy streets. Sherlock wriggled against his side.
“You can’t have him that way Sherlock” warned Mycroft as he gripped his arm, “ two boys, together like that, it simply isn’t allowed, besides, he isn’t of our class”
“The drink is the lesser of the evils, Sherlock, this is not a trifling matter”, he began, “The Physician informed me the effects can lay dormant, you may feel quite recovered , but further exposure however brief may awaken a craving you may not be in control of. You wagered with your life last night…how could you be so careless?”
Slanted, piercing eyes of a strange and deeply unsettling mix of yellow, green and blue stared back into his own, dark navy and defiant. They stood like that for what must have been a mere heartbeat, but which felt like a thousand years and then soft pink lips, enhanced at the top with an elegant bow, pulled back into a smile of pure delight, as the boy let out a deep, rumbling laugh. John reeled a little, it felt like he had just been punched in the gut.
“You can’t say I didn’t warn you” Sherlock said, shoving him firmly through the open door into beery warmth.
“Just look at you, you gorgeous thing….that poor boy wouldn’t have a clue what to do with you now would he?”
Sherlock rounded on him with an irritated sigh “You may be succeeding in fooling your friends, and maybe even yourself to some extent…but I know exactly who you are John Watson”
Sherlock pinched his cheeks sarcastically, Victor slapped his hand away and told him he was a prick, “Christ, relax, you’re such an old woman these days Victor, I promise I’ll be home, all tucked up nice in bed, and up in time for school in the morning like a good little boy”.
He leaned in closer.
John filled out the form in his best illegible future doctor scrawl, his head down as two blokes in muscle-tee's with bulging biceps covered in tattoo's headed past him through another door marked 'Gym'.
“Fuck…I’m sorry Sherlock…did I wake you up?”
“In fact I would say you already are”.
Oh my god, they had just had sex.
It really was too tempting Sherlock thought, stepping up behind him and whipping the towel away as if that had been the plan all along.
Sherlock pushed up from the table with the scrape of a chair
John spoke to my ear as we came upon a vestibule, the crowd packed in tight to gain entry to the room beyond. He had schooled me for this, not to startle at the grope of a hand at my arse, to treat with disdain the lascivious looks I might receive and to pull away firmly from any who sought to take liberties and part us from one another, trusting in the heaving mass of bodies to conceal their immoral intent. Such crimes were common in places such as this, committed in a public space where morality had been redefined for the night and might be mistook for a part in the festivities. But still I had not reckoned I would be so afraid, starting at the very first touch I received from a much older lady dressed in the French style with a tumble of cherry-red curls.
Mike coloured, “Hey, I don’t kiss and tell”
Sherlock gasped…oh god. He held out his fingers and John took those too, tongue working over his blood soaked skin until every trace had disappeared.
He should know, because he’d lived it, it was him and Mr Watson from the very first time until the day he’d finally had enough and found the courage to end it. But he couldn’t part with these, they were all he had left, and he would show him, so he could see how much it had all meant…and still did.
They reached the front of the vast hall and he stood, head held high in front of the staff table, while the entire school looked on.
“And you?”
Oh fuck, how could he possibly know?
John pressed on, there was another reason why he had turned up today, more important than his own wounded pride.
“Oh, right”. He looked around him, and then around the room. Sherlock’s things were on the tub chair, jacket and trousers, shoes placed underneath. The shirt was still on the floor in a ball, and the tie was slung over the headboard of the bed. John’s stuff, shoe’s and jacket were half under the bed on the opposite side to where they were now. Greg passed them up and he dressed in a daze.
“Jesus Christ Sherlock…can we do that?...I mean, you said we should use the condoms…”
“And when was the last time you got laid Seb?, four, no, five months ago, in a public toilet, it was over in less than three minutes and you didn’t even know his name, oh, and that’s just when you aren’t pretending to your family that you’re straight, how is the lovely Claire by the way? Does she still believe you’re saving yourself for marriage? so kindly fuck off Sebastian”.
(Shit…had they just made too much noise?)
“So, what’s it like, shagging a bloke?"
“Go on then, bugger off the pair of you….I’ll speak to you later Sherlock” Greg added meaningfully. Sherlock had no desire to spend another fucking second in that place, having endured more than enough stupidity for one evening. (Including his own, admittedly).
He paused, straining to overhear the conversation without being seen. He heard ‘Frank Hudson’ and ‘bullet in his head’ as the blood slowly drained from his face. This was so not good. Whatever the fucking trouble the stupid lanky idiot had walked into here was, it wasn’t the sound of a frantic fuck in a back alley. He peered cautiously around the corner. Sherlock was rigid, pressed back against the wall about halfway down, barely illuminated by the light from the street beyond. The tall American was pressed close to Sherlock’s body, a strong beefy arm pinning him in place by his chest. John saw Sherlock wriggle a little, trying to move against him, slumping back again after a fruitless attempt. It felt so unreal, like a scene from a movie, standing in the half-light, realising with growing horror that Sherlock was in real trouble, alone and scared. But John was there, he wasn’t no-one, there was no time to run for help, it could only be him.
It was the same narrow corridor, the same oak paneled door and the same, warm, book-lined room as my previous visit. Weston – as I would always think of him, sat toad-like as ever behind his writing table at the window. He took his time to acknowledge our presence, making careful entries in a large red ledger. I took it as a ploy to unsettle and to make us both aware of his elevated station. Neither cowed, nor intimidated, we waited for him to finish his task, until with a final flourish, he sprinkled powder over the ink to fix it and blew it off again with a puff of fetid breath.
“….but not his lack of sobriety…interesting” Mycroft continued, to himself, hands steepled before his chin.
“Yeah well, Frank’s boys sorted it out, they shouldn’t come in to our club like they own the place then, should they?”
His stomach lurched and his heart skipped a beat…how had he missed this…how? Carried away by a haze of drugs and sex… Oh god, what did they say…did he even want to know after what he’d just done? Victor might have put the nail in the coffin back there at the club, but he had fucking buried it six feet under since.
John saw the devious look in Sherlock’s eye, the evil glint.
“Why the hell didn’t you phone to say you were going to be late back, poor Mike turned up on his own, that’s so ill-mannered John”
“What the hell did you expect?, he hardly struck me as the sociable type” Greg butted in, “but if he’s a half-decent Quidditch player, I might change my mind…. You should try him out for chaser John, if Pemberton’s still out of action after that bludger to the head he got last match, anyone would think he’d been hit by a bloody Confundus charm”
“Yeah…not the best move as it turned out, or I might have stood half a chance”
“You two are disgusting, couldn’t you change before coming in here?”
“Yes. It’s ideal don’t you think, and it will look even better in daylight.”
“Oh…er…this is John, Mama, he has just saved me from certain death by horse drawn cab”
“Are you done?” the words forced themselves out of his parched and stinging throat in a ragged gasp. “Why wouldn’t you let me help? How did Isaac Whitney see me….. but not Bill?”
John felt mildly triumphant as a flicker of doubt passed across Sherlock’s haughty face. He pressed his advantage.
“I saw your young man just now…looking very handsome”
“Bullshit, you’re as mad as a box of frogs all the time”.
“Huh” said John “I see the bloody bastard didn’t give a shit that I was lying in the gutter too”
“No sir, I assure you, I make no mistake, he’s a damn little swindling trickster of a whore…and you found him in a brothel sir….do you dare to deny it?”
Fucking hell.
“Fucking hell Sherlock! What did you do to get chucked out six times?”
“Hey, just watch him with that, looks like he’s well in need of a hit and I don’t want an o.d on my conscience okay?” he glared at John
Never again.
We approached, and I waited in a state of apprehension and anxiety while Irene made my case and the good lady looked me over. Providence, it appeared, was on my side, and evidently happy with what she saw she paused in her appraisal to hand Irene a small linen pouch.
“And what exactly is this ‘thing’ you want me to do?”
“Look, right now this is between you and Sara mate, come find me later, we’ll talk then”. He gave John a tight-lipped smile as he left.
John hopped on the spot, tugging the damned jeans that snagged on his ankles, and kicking them across the floor. His clumsy fingers had obviously forgotten how buttonholes worked and he huffed and struggled growing impatient when the last two wouldn’t give and ripping it off over his head instead. He was embarrassingly eager, but it was ages since he’d fucked a bloke, and shit, his stomach flipped uncomfortably, but he had to ask, fingers crossed, “Erm….bottom or top?”
“That’s more like it”
“Huh. I wondered how long it would take you to find us”, Sherlock huffed, not in the least surprised by his brother’s sudden appearance. He casually checked the time. “Fifteen minutes Mycroft, you’re slipping”.
“Hey, I get it, its fine. You don’t need to explain…god, Sherlock.” John interrupted, and held out his hands palms face forward. “It’s not as if we’re…I mean this isn’t…” He trailed off and gestured between them feeling helpless and off-balance and more than a little bit foolish.
John wandered back with two bottles of Pilsner and handed one to him. “Harry says and I quote ‘if I get the sack because of that fucking twat I’ll make you wish you’d never been born, birthday or not’, unquote”.
I stamped my feet to banish the numbness from my limbs, and groaned as the blood flowed freely and a flood of feeling rushed back in, skin prickling like ants across my flesh. It was late, much later than I’d thought, and by the flickering of the candles could just make out the time - the clock on the mantle said nine.
“I’ve only known him for two days, I’d hardly call that considerable” John snapped, he was fucked if he would let this wanker lord it over him.
“Next time I want to plug you and send you back to school like this….can I do that?....will you let me?”
He didn’t even know who that John Watson was anymore. He glanced up to find Sherlock bent over at the waist to re-tie his shoelace, arse in the air, t-shirt riding up his back exposing skin and underwear (at least he had pants on tonight) and remembered, he liked this life better, much, much better (and maybe he would get to finger Sherlock at the end of the night – probably, the shameless tart)
Sherlock’s eyes were unfocused, not even pretending to listen. He chugged the last of his beer, wiped a hand across the back of his mouth and seeing nowhere to stash the empty, he shoved it into Victor’s hands with a wink and said, “Don’t wait up”, with no further explanation. He slapped him on the shoulder his eyes still fixed across the room on the bloke who stood, hands in pockets, waiting, an eyebrow raised questioningly.
“You don’t think you understand him because he’s not fully human at times?”
“Do you remember… Redbeard?”
John feels a very familiar sense of frustration bubble up inside as he struggles to rein in his temper. Sherlock brings out the best in him, but
In the end, John decides to go. Within 24 hours, in fact, though he’s trying to convince himself that the very next day after work isn’t the same as
. Her voice does actually sound mildly sad, though, he has to give her that at least.
getting the last laugh in His own cruel way. Because Sherlock won’t wake up. He bloody won’t wake up! According to the doctors, there’s no physical impediment to explain his prolonged lack of consciousness. He’s breathing normally, steadily and all by himself. The machines attached to him are nothing but monitors. He just doesn’t come to. Which John is enough of a doctor to know is a merciful term for a coma. Sherlock’s doctors can use as reassuring a tone as they want, it certainly did little to reassure either John or Mrs. Hudson. They’re doing everything they can for him and they’re going to exclude every other possibility before arriving at any conclusions. But the facts are the facts: a coma caused by Sherlock’s overdose is the most plausible explanation.
John shakes him once, firmly. There’s absolutely no response. Then he shakes him again, firmer still. No response.
“Come on, Sherlock, come on.”
The air seems to stand still for a moment as the electric current between them ignites and sparkles.
He hears Jim shift. A moment later, he’s leaning in over him from behind the chair. Sherlock opens his eyes and they immediately interlock with Jim’s. Mirror images.
“I do.”
John wishes to crawl under a rock and remain there for the rest of his existence at the thought of what Sherlock may or may not have been able to deduce from that slip of the tongue.
. Monumental is what this occasion calls for, but John doesn’t have any words monumental enough.
“Serbia. While I… was away…” He’s obviously as loath to mention anything pertaining to the Fall as John is. “While I was away, I travelled around. Eurasia mostly.” He hesitates. “Moriarty was dead.”
way, turn his back and return to the telly. And Sherlock would let him, because Sherlock isn’t exactly good with these sort of feely things and, despite his best efforts to keep it a secret, John knows he’s extremely insecure about it. He would probably think he’d once again misunderstood, that he was the one who’d done something inappropriate, and he would let it slide because he’d have no idea how to ask for an explanation, much less start a proper conversation about it.
“So go on,” Sherlock continues, the slightest hint of emotion in his voice overpowered by a monotone delivery. “Play the game. Hydrogen. Lithium. Beryllium. Chlorine. Potassium. Nickel. The song is the answer.”
“So I just did what I always do.”
It’s only then that Sherlock turns to him. They lock eyes, but his expression is unreadable. Deliberately kept so.
The hardest thing about letting go is the disappointment. Letting the people down that he cares about most in this world. But the hardest thing about holding on is also the disappointment. The disappointment of realising that the people he cares about most in this world do not return that sentiment. They might care when he stumbles. They might care when he fails. But there is no reward for staying on that ledge above the chasm. Only the sweet pain of pride for holding on for another minute. In contrast, having the weight of the decision lifted from his shoulders on the way down to the bottom does resemble some form of reward.
After everything they’ve both been through, to have all of this with John now – their home, their family, their child, each other – it’s a privilege that Sherlock isn’t quite sure he deserves, but one that he nevertheless feels infinitely blessed by. That John really, truly seems to have chosen Sherlock for his partner, trusted him with John’s heart, trusted him to raise John’s
Then he makes the fatal mistake of opening his mouth. “I love her,” he says, meaning it almost as a kind of confirmation to himself. A reminder that he does love Mary, a reminder that’s sorely needed because of how overwhelmingly intense his feelings for Sherlock are in this moment. But of course Sherlock doesn’t hear it in that way. Instead he runs a hand over John’s hair, lightly, afraid to use too much pressure, as though he might better be able to deny his actions if he doesn’t use any force.
Still, maybe John could have given him just a little bit of leeway. He had tried to explain himself. He had tried… well, perhaps he hadn’t exactly tried to be sensitive about it, but at the very least, he hadn’t tried to be insensitive either or play down the significance of what they have both endured. He had simply been happy. Happy to be back, happy to reunite with John. He had hoped that John would feel the same. Evidently not the case. He had tried to make John laugh, to make what might be a very emotional moment easier for both of them. He had hoped that John would appreciate that. Evidently not the case.
“I that am lost, oh who will find me? Deep down below the old beech tree; Help succour me now the east winds blow; Sixteen by six, brother, and under we go…”
house, and all he wants to do is go back to before they met and undo everything that happened afterwards!
“I know he’s here on exchange.”
It’s not the first time Mary has suggested this. According to her, Sherlock will calm down about the wedding if he’s reassured that it won’t change anything. Her deduction, as she jokingly likes to refer to it, is that Sherlock is actually quite terrified by the prospect and currently overdoing it in terms of enthusiasm and planning just to get it over with. John isn’t quite sure what to think about her theory. The idea of Sherlock Holmes faking enthusiasm at the prospect of a social event seems farfetched. But then again, John can’t come up with any other plausible explanation for Sherlock’s behaviour and, to be quite honest, any suggestions to stop Sherlock going off on a veritable wedding planning spree are welcome at this point.
It takes him less than a second to react. Despite two years living a fully ordinary, civilian life, John’s time in the military and his time as Sherlock’s partner lie just beneath the surface and he turns and starts to fight almost instantaneously.
John takes a deep breath.
John is quiet for a moment.
Perhaps she reads the rest of the sentence in his eyes, for her own grow narrow.
John chuckles and pats on the couch beside him. “Come here, you.”
It’s only now, his brain finally beginning to feel like his brain again, that he’s able to fully appreciate the enormity of the mistakes he’s made and the crippling sense of shame that those mistakes bring up in him.
John can see his throat constrict when he swallows.
Of course the route from the clinic to Baker Street is one John has travelled many a time, way too familiar to keep him distracted on the way. Instead, inevitably, his thoughts drift towards Sherlock and Mary’s theory. Could Sherlock really be worried about the wedding? There’s nothing to worry about. John just got him back. He isn’t going to let him go again. Though John still feels both anger and frustration whenever he thinks about what Sherlock made him go through, the sheer relief of having Sherlock back, of knowing that he’s here and alive and well… John isn’t going to let him go again. Not for anything in the world.  No matter what happens with him and Mary, John and Sherlock are a thing and they’ll never stop doing this. Solving cases and drinking tea and laughing at things that the rest of the world don’t understand. Surely Sherlock knows this. They might not be very good at talking about what they have, neither of them really excels at communication when it comes to anything concerning feelings, but it seems absurd to assume that Sherlock should be worried about the wedding.
“Oil. We need something to…” John pants, already sounding half-frenzied to his own ears.
John raises an eyebrow.
Sherlock doesn’t blink. “Good and bad are fairy tales.”
“And by
Sherlock nods. “It was an experiment.”
, John thinks, even though he knows that to be a highly subjective opinion. Feeling himself moving perilously close to sentimentality, John quickly tries to redirect the atmosphere.
"... Are you really sure you’re going to be alright? I can stay if you want, it’s not a problem.”
“When do you think he’ll be? There, I mean?”
Still, John can’t help himself. These silences… they’re not too different from Sherlock’s silences of old. But John can keep trying to tell himself that there’s no reason to worry, that Sherlock has always been this way, that he’s just doing as he usually does, it doesn’t help on how it makes John
He doesn’t sound like himself at all today, so stuttering and disconnected in his narrative, so apologetic and
“I should hope so.” The all-too familiar wall firmly in place between them.
John’s voice dies out. With the way she’s looking at him, he knows she’s judging every word. What is she listening for? What exactly would he be confessing to if he spoke his mind now? Mary has been nothing but supportive these last few days. Sherlock waking up has apparently been a signal to her that John is now no longer off limits for her questions. John’s mind is reeling from the abrupt turn their conversation has taken, trying to figure out what it’s really about before he reveals more to her than he’d like.
As if on cue, they all four lean in closer, each wishing to confirm for him- or herself that Sherlock’s eyes really are open. Which they certainly are, though John doesn’t get the impression that they’re capable of processing much of the visual input. He knows they shouldn’t crowd in around him like this. Everything is likely overwhelming and strange in Sherlock’s current condition, there’s no reason for them to make it any worse for him than it has to be. The same thing goes for loud noises, though, so John simply raises his hands slightly out of Sherlock’s field of vision, gesturing for the others to pull back before doing the same himself. He feels a twinge of discomfort telling Sherlock’s biological brother and the woman who loves Sherlock as though he was her own son to back away, but his concern for Sherlock’s well-being overrides that.
Eventually Sherlock nods, once. Then he looks at John, smiles in that same manner of joking-but-not, and asks with complete sincerity yet not without a hint of teasing: “Would you die content, then?”
“What the hell, Sherlock…?”
“That there’s no such thing as
“Don’t. Don’t apologise. You didn’t know. How could you? And what does it even matter? It’s more than a year ago and I honestly don’t care. I didn’t at the time and I still don’t. So just forget about it.”
it? Why do they have to be like this, the two of them? Why can’t they just say what they feel and be done with it? Why must it always be like this, everything coming out so slowly and awkwardly that it’s an embarrassment to think of, half of it said in metaphors and innuendos, the other half of it being left unsaid?
He sees John swallow again, more heavily this time. His eyes could not be farther from expressionless, yet Sherlock can’t for the life of him decipher what he’s seeing there.
“How far are you willing to go to find out?”
“What do you think, Sherlock?”
John doesn’t know what to say. He can’t find any words that feel worthy of this occasion.
Somewhat unexpectedly, it’s Sherlock who speaks first.
“What do you mean? You’ve got nothing to be sorry for, Sherlock.”
But not like this. Never like this. It’s so easy, so... thoughtless. John is just watching the telly, exuding nothing but calmness and normality. If Sherlock didn’t know him as well as he does, if he didn’t know that John’s never held him like this before and if he didn’t know about John’s anxieties concerning his own sexuality, then maybe Sherlock would have been fooled into thinking that they do this on a regular basis. Right in this moment, ripped out of space, time and all context, it almost feels like it.
. Sherlock
Mycroft returns to the living room, looking pointedly down at his brother. He fondles the handle of his umbrella, one of his specific habits. It looks every bit the superior gesture, though John suspects that it’s actually a cleverly masked agitated mannerism. Not a whole lot of compassion to be found there. But then again, John is still 95% angry and 10% sympathetic himself, so he doesn't feel as though he has room to judge.
Crisis averted.
“Hello, stranger.”
He takes a moment to steady himself and then looks John square in the eye.
John realises that he has forgotten to breathe. What a fucking idiot he’s been. All this time he’s spent focusing solely on his own grief and the sense of betrayal he felt when Sherlock came crashing back into his life like a bull into a china shop, large as bloody life and apparently unaffected by the whole ordeal as well as slightly amused at John’s emotional response. It’s with no small sense of guilt John realises that he’s never given much thought to
He opens his mouth to reply, to say what he knows he ought to say and what half of his brain is screaming at him to say.
Oh, for goodness' sake...
Still he hasn’t replied. The thoughts are churning around in his head. He’s turning the same things over again and again, as he has been for days now, without getting any closer to a solution. They just keep repeating all their mistakes, keep postponing decisions, keep oscillating back and forth in their constant dance of advance and retreat. They talk, more and better and deeper than they ever have before, than any of them ever has with another person before, but it’s not followed by action. They talk and they understand, but they don’t change. And John can keep telling himself that now is the time to act, but if it’s all talk and no actual action, then what have they really achieved?
They move in such perfect tandem that it eventually stops feeling as though they’re two separate entities, the boundaries between them growing blurry and indistinct. One moment eager and frantic, the next passionate and tender, they both seem unable to decide whether to give their attraction or their feelings precedence. In effect, it becomes a strange mix of the two that somehow works perfectly, articulating every pent-up, unspoken wish and desire and feeling of the past three years more eloquently than any conversation they’ve had up until this point.
“No, I’m not…”
Sherlock clears his throat.
John settles for a chuckle that definitely doesn’t come out as relaxed as he would have liked it to. “Sherlock… as much as I appreciate all your help with the wedding and everything…” Christ, he really ought to think through what he’s going to say before he begins to say it. His impromptu reaction is to tell Sherlock that the wedding really isn’t that big of a deal, but he obviously can’t say that. He’s the groom for fuck’s sake. And now Sherlock is looking at him, waiting for the continuation. Christ, he really ought to think through what he’s going to say before he begins to say it.
“We wait, I guess. I wait. For Mary to say something. Make a decision about us. About me… But in the meantime, I suppose I stay here. Because that’s what I want to do. I have that from a reliable source.” The corner of John’s mouth twists upwards in what Sherlock would term a mischievous smirk if it didn’t come across as so damn sad.
… Is it perhaps jealousy?
John has to let his breath out in a gasp before he can find his voice just long enough to raise it and shout, shout so it can be heard by every person in the general vicinity.
“Sherlock?” John makes sure to keep his voice easily audible without being too loud, his tone soft and reassuring. Sherlock clearly hears him, his still-roaming gaze locking onto John with as much certainty as it seems he can manage. There’s a flash of recognition in his eyes.
Part 3, based on the prompt "Miracle"!
going to return first thing in the morning. He might just be waiting because there’s nothing else to do.
His eyes are still on the screen, although John can’t imagine that The Great British Bake Off has much to offer in terms of mental stimulation.
“I know. That’s what it is. That’s what it’s always been, isn’t it? Fear."
Sherlock raises an eyebrow, suddenly wary. “Not to seem ungrateful, but I’m not sure I can handle any more meetings with old friends. Seeing how terribly well it went with Mycroft.”
It takes a moment. Then, unbelievably, it begins to work. His mind expands again. Every sensation is taken in, recorded on pristine white sheets of paper in Sherlock’s neatest of hands and meticulously catalogued for further analysis in boxes of evidence, stored on just the correct shelves in his mind palace, right where they belong. A wave of relief and pride surges through him, extending all the way into his fingertips and making them buzz with that same electricity that seems to circuit between his lips and brain.
“Seems like suicides are going out of fashion. None out of two.”
“Oh, you’re home.”
Sherlock looks at him.
It’s Mary’s turn to sigh, but hers isn’t just tired as his had been. It’s exasperated, as though John is being unbearably dim.
The observant reader will have noticed that I have changed some events and dialogue from the show already. This is because, while I have been sticking pretty closely to the show so far, I haven't spent six chapters on stuff we've all already seen just because I wanted to see it again, but because I've used additional dialogue, additional scenes and a look into the characters' heads to set up events further on the story. As such, I've also felt compelled to drop some storylines from the show just for simplicity, such as Mary's pregnancy and, as you'll see in this chapter, the entire Magnussen story arc. I hope you'll like it!

John smiles a little awkwardly, lopsided and transparently forced grin.
found him likeable. Sherlock is John’s area. She’s never even met the man before. How does she think that her knee-jerk reaction to his character is the most important aspect of how John feels about him?
It was all part of the plan. The plan worked.
Sherlock glances up at John out of the corner of his eye, managing to look more than a little guilty, and John’s heart constricts in his chest. John has seen enough of Sherlock’s expressions to say with confidence that Sherlock, as limited as he often is in his communication, often manages to say more with one look than many people can express in words. This one is Sherlock’s way of wordlessly saying
It’s actually a relief to see her, in spite of it all. John
But then John’s arms are around him, soothing and strong and every bit as tangible and real as they’re supposed to be.
“How are you feeling?”
He just waits until they leave again and Mycroft leaves with them. Mrs. Hudson gathers her things as well when it begins to get late and says she’ll be back first thing in the morning, which makes John’s stomach drop a further fifteen stories as he ponders why that wording sounds awfully familiar.
John’s stomach relocates to approximately street level.
And the same burning questions.

The seconds pass. John doesn’t try to fill them. These prolonged silences seem to be a new habit of Sherlock's, though John isn’t sure whether they signal insecurity or an unwillingness to disclose what’s on his mind.
Almost half a minute passes, by John’s estimation.
It’s different from what John had imagined. It takes him by surprise that his mistaken assumptions about sex between men are this deeply ingrained. His attraction to Sherlock notwithstanding, he’d been certain that it wasn’t as easy or as… as pristine with another man as it is with women. Women smell nice, John has always thought so, while the masculine scent of men has never really appealed to him, not even with some of the soldiers in Afghanistan that he otherwise found physically attractive. But Sherlock has an appealing scent. Not overly masculine, but definitely more musky than the flowery, fruity fragrances John is used to encounter in bed.
Sherlock groans lowly at the very back of his throat, a deep baritone. His head lolls around before it’s lifted to look at Mycroft, as though that movement in itself causes more effort than Sherlock is willing to spare on it. John is struck by the contrast in his eyes, how he looks to be somewhere else entirely while still being able to maintain an intense glare. His mouth is slow to open. His speech is slightly slurred. Maybe it’s not just cocaine that he’s been subjecting himself to.
, you only wanted to know
The deductions they make don’t contribute to a particular case. They don’t build towards some overall conclusion. And yet it strangely feels as though they do. It’s as if each deduction is perfectly lined up to all the ones that came before it, each supplying a new piece of a puzzle, each contributing to make the picture more complete. But Sherlock finds it difficult to tell exactly what that picture might be showing, and he doesn’t discuss it with Jim. They don’t discuss any of the things that really matter. Not since the day when Moriarty first turned up at Baker Street, the day he talked about solving the final problem. Since then, they haven’t discussed anything of importance. Only how the man at Tesco is cheating on his wife, how the woman on Shaftesbury Avenue owns two dogs and has a hospitalised mother, how the tourist at St. Paul’s is hoping the man next to him might be interested in getting a drink after the tour but is quite clearly setting himself up for disappointment.
That’s what he says and once it’s done, it’s done. It’s out there in the world and it can’t be taken back. It can’t be unsaid.
But slowly John starts to pick up on minor, yet meaningful changes. John helps Sherlock to bed one evening, balancing him with a hand on the small of his back as he sits down on the mattress, and his hand lingers a moment longer than strictly necessary. Sherlock reciprocates the next morning by leaning in over John’s back as he reaches for the coffeepot, a bit closer than he normally would, close enough for his dressing gown to trail along John’s back in an almost-caress. John in return ruffles Sherlock’s hair when he comes out of the shower and Sherlock’s fingers touch his for a second when he accepts the remote for the telly. Little maneuverings of advance and retreat, advance and retreat, like a dance they’re doing together though neither of them knows the steps. Perfectly in tune, yet hesitant and anxious.
John listens. But that hesitant smile that John would have described as being a bit shy if it had graced the face of anyone else than Sherlock Holmes is enough to make a feeling spread throughout his chest that John isn’t quite sure he wants to dwell on for too long.
sort of smile, John is mostly just feeling inclined to rip her to shreds, verbally like an almost sane person or physically like anything but.
Then one voice breaks through the persistent roar. It’s a voice that even John’s drug-addled brain instantly recognizes and a sharp stab of hope shoots through him. There’s no doubt. He would know that voice anywhere. John puts his all into shouting just one more time and Sherlock responds instantly from somewhere to his left. Maybe Sherlock recognizes John’s voice anywhere too. He must, if he manages to both hear and understand the mangled cry for help that John is currently capable of making.
just like old times and John certainly
Sherlock doesn’t take his rejection personally. It’s a reaction he has observed quite a number of times already and there’s no reason to drag John’s embarrassment out in the open in front of his new
Jim is good at this. Whether it stems from experience or if he has thought his way to it all, calculated everything... that’s anyone’s guess and certainly not a deduction that Sherlock’s brain is currently capable of making.
“But I’m not. I’ve never been able to do that. I’ve always wanted to, aspired to even, but I’ve just never been able to do it. I… When I’m out on a case, I don’t know the people I’m working with, neither the clients nor the victims. I don’t know them.” Sherlock’s hands flare out in a frustrated gesture, emphasizing his point. “
And then there’s the looks. At first John thought that it was just something he was imagining, but now he’s not so sure. They’ve always looked at each other of course. That’s hardly avoidable when living together for nearly two years. Maintaining eye contact is nothing unheard of for them either. They’ve often done so in the past. Sometimes, if John is being honest, a bit longer and a bit more intensely than what could be considered normal between friends.
He looks around, and the world solidifies some more. He is in a room, rather small, the light flooding in through Venetian blinds in the window, making a pattern of light and shades over the floor. Thoughts can no longer change the things that are now determined, set: there are mats, and book cases and chairs and wall papers. There is an old wooden clock on the wall and it shows eleven thirty, and Sherlock Holmes remembers time.
”People just can’t tell the difference between a snog and a robbery, can they? Such a shame, actually.” And John had smiled at him, one of his collector’s book of smiles, gentle and rather ruthless at the same time, and he had shook his head.
They had both reflexively turned their heads towards the voice: a 20-something-year-old that had been passing on the main street with his three friends had stopped at the sight of them and called out, his voice strong and honest.
He had had a plan. A little blurry in the edges, not overly detailed, but he had had the framework more or less worked out.
Sherlock had not been entirely sure about John still being with him at the end of it. Not after him dismantling the web, (surviving), but the years that he had planned to continue solving cases in London, followed by a rather calm life on the countryside, where he should keep bees and write books and possibly engage in video calls from some DI that would need his brain even though his body no longer would be fit for the never-slowing tempo of the London underworld. He knew that John wanted children, a traditional family, that Sherlock never could be able to give him: not sure that he would’ve, had the opportunity presented itself. He could share his life with John, the life he had and all of it to be honest and he would’ve been glad to do so, had it just been his choice. But he had never been entirely sure that John would find that enough, at length, even though he for the time being was content (his non-limp told enough).
no time, and no space, and certainly no light waiting for you on the other side.
back-up, and God had he felt alive. Sometime later Sherlock had got to be so very clever and Lestrade had furrowed his forehead deeply, deeply (and possibly entertained two, no three ideas of how to kill and dispose of Sherlock with no-one ever finding out, just to get this bloody night over with) before suddenly even his limited capacity for reasoning had made it and his face had lit up. And in close to no time at all (or thirteen minutes to be precise) the case had been solved and he and John had been free to go. The adrenaline had still been firing inside their bodies and the night had still felt so young, so new, so when John had asked ”Pint?” with a slightly raised eyebrow Sherlock had just smiled his answer.
He knows things about this room, yet he has never seen it before. It is like he could feel its history like someone would determine temperature and smell upon entering a room; the most recent ones telling the most, but older, more faded ones still lingering, adding their part to the story.
