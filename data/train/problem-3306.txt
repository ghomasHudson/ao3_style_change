Finally, Dean's pants slipped over his butt and settled into place. Panting heavily, Dean pawed at his own fat to shove it out and over the waistband, anything to make a little more room between himself and his pants. The result looked rather ridiculous - generous love handles strained over the sides, a roll of back fat sat primly above his ass, and Dean's already substantial stomach was piled out front in a big, soft-looking mound. Dean sighed, and it pushed out even further, resting heavily between the flaps of his slacks. He already had a naturally top-heavy build, but this was ridiculous.
Dean, mouth still open slightly, brought his hands up to delicately cup Cas's breasts, almost as if he was afraid to touch them, pupils blown so wide that only a slim ring of green was left around them. "It must be, uh- must be my birthday or somethin'," he joked weakly, slowly raking his eyes down Cas's body. A low moan tore from his throat when he noticed Cas's panties, and he trailed his hands down to play with the lace. "Holy shit, Cas."
He focused mostly on the hardest parts of his gut, trying to break up the food faster, trying to make more room in the monster. A few seconds in, he hit a pocket of air instead of a bit of food, surprising himself with a deep, resounding belch that gave him a surprising amount of room. While Sam (and some of the other patrons) looked mortified, the whole burping thing freed up a lot of space, so Dean started to focus on that instead. Every time he hit a pocket of air in his belly, it forced out a loud burp. Regardless of how it made him look like a total pig, it felt
look pretty good, and Dean was pretty sure they had the ingredients. It was almost dinner time anyway - well, it was only five, but close enough - and while Dean wasn't exactly hungry, he could go for some food.
Dean and Cas shared clothes now, too, all of Cas's own much too tight around the belly, hips, and thighs. His weight continued to pile on at a steady pace, maybe even faster than before, and by the time Thanksgiving break rolled around, Dean had already had to let out two pairs of his own pants so they'd fit around Cas's rapidly-expanding waistline. He'd kindly mutilated one of his own belts for Cas as well, digging out new holes with a knife so his boyfriend's belly could sit comfortably over it. Cas had grown amazingly large in the past few weeks, and it showed.
“Maybe. But that’s just how everything fits nowadays,” Dean said, snapping the waistband of his underwear for emphasis.
Sam had to cancel their plans that week, and Dean spent his Saturday night watching Indiana Jones movies and eating ice cream and absolutely not moping.
. Sam looked like he wanted to sink into the ground. Dean just continued to rub his own gut, eyes closed.
"Oh," Cas said. "Well, the werewolves are dead, but we have suspicions about a vampire nest in Vermont and may be gone for another week, most likely two. Will you be all right?"
But Cain could still move. Dean could feel one of his hands trailing lower and lower, over the hard curve of his gut and past its flabby underside, towards the place he’d
Castiel liked Dean's friends, he really did, but he liked Dean the best. Dean, with his plush lips, warm smile, ridiculous sense of humor, contagious laugh, and soft belly. He was everything Cas could ever want (but never let himself have) wrapped in chubby, freckled packaging.
Dean was still fat, kind of insecure, and he didn’t know what to do about work, how to lose the extra weight, or even
“Excuse me,” he muttered, feeling his face heat up. He didn’t care what Cain said, burping would never be sexy.
“Yes it was,” Cain said, leaning down to give Dean a kiss as he continued massaging his overburdened middle. Dean sighed happily into the kiss, although he couldn’t do much beyond that, as his arms felt like lead and his stomach was practically an immovable boulder by now.
It was at this moment that the waiter stopped by to drop off the check. His eyes bulged a bit at the sight of Dean's ruined shirt, and, realizing that Dean was a bit incapacitated, he handed the check off to Sam without taking his eyes off of Dean and his mammoth stomach resting on the majority of the table.
Sure enough, Dean got another timely reply. ‘You’re making it very difficult to get through this meeting.’ More of a response than last time at least, but still not good enough. It was time to pull out the big guns. Unfortunately, the big guns involved Dean getting up, and he grumbled as he hauled himself off the couch. Dean cradled his full belly when it protested the movement. This was commonplace, as Dean was always full nowadays - honestly, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d truly been hungry - but it could still be uncomfortable at times.
Turns out Purgatory was less classy, more trashy than Dean had originally thought, and it catered especially to the college kids of Austin. It was the kind of place where bouncers only gave a cursory glance at your ID and workers wore strangely provocative uniforms. Unfortunately, he wasn’t an exception.
Already regretting what he was about to do, Dean leaned down over the counter, his belly smushed against the side, and picked up the shot with his mouth stretched wide around the rim. Christ, he hadn't done this in
Face heating up, Dean slouched further into the couch cushions, self-conscious about his weight gain for the first time. The position just made his belly pooch out even more, his round, plump stomach smothering the waistband of his underwear and resting lightly on his thighs. "I said fuck
Now, a month or two past their two year anniversary, Dean was somewhere in the mid-300s. It was pretty heavy for a guy who'd just turned twenty-one, but so what? Dean loved food, Cas loved when Dean ate, and they both loved the consequences, so screw everyone else.
“I, um,” Dean stuttered, feeling a bit like an idiot, and maybe Sam was right about that. “Thanks. And you actually can touch, if you like. Feels good.”
The weight of the plates had kept his shirt from riding up too much, and while that had made Sam happy - he got what he called "second-hand embarrassment" when Dean's clothes didn't fit, and he was pissy enough as it was - it meant that Dean's shirt had been suffocating him for the past hour or so. Apparently, his deep breath had stretched his abused shirt past its limits.
Dean worked at his belly with his hand, hoping it would speed up the process. As a general rule, Dean tried to keep himself from touching this part of his body unnecessarily, but
Christmas with the Winchesters was just as amazing as Thanksgiving had been, full of hot chocolate and cookies and egg nog and more. Castiel got three new sets of uniform clothes from the Winchester family (which Mary gave him with a wink, making Cas blush furiously), a hefty check from his parents, and two pairs of suspenders that were just from Dean, plus a few other odds and ends. He'd never thought of wearing suspenders instead of a belt, but Westfield's dress code
Weirdly fascinated now, Dean poked at his stomach and watched, transfixed, as it sunk in a little. His tiny gut was pretty solid - probably all the beer, heh - but still shook when he jumped experimentally. After a couple more moments of staring at himself, Dean just shrugged and tugged his shirt back down. He was still a badass who hunted monsters for a living and was currently boning his best friend. He could deal with a little extra chub.
“One, be nicer to yourself,” Sam chided. “And two, I’m not a lady, if you haven’t noticed, and I think your extra weight is extremely attractive. I mean, you weren’t exactly bad-looking before, but...” He squeezed Dean’s love handle, and Dean shied away.
, the horrible thing fell at his feet. Dean almost cried out in relief when his gut surged forward, fell into place over his pants. He rubbed it gently, afraid that a lot of pressure would hurt, and unzipped and unbuttoned his pants as well.
Sam fell silent, face red as Dean hefted up his gigantic gut with his arms. Groaning at the weight of his stomach, Dean shuffled around as he slowly pivoted to sit the right way in the booth. His chins wobbled as his breath came faster; his belly was fucking
Mirroring Dean's raised brow, Cas gave him a pat on the belly. "You're not wearing a shirt, Dean, and I sincerely doubt that any of your old shirts will fit. You can't exactly safety pin your shirt buttons."
Hands still on his middle, Dean belched loudly and leaned back in his seat. He eventually bit the bullet and unbuttoned his pants, let his stomach expand, and sighed at the instant relief it granted him. Finally feeling comfortable enough to drive, Dean turned the key and made his way home slowly, wincing whenever a bump in the road jostled his gurgling belly.
Dean's face, now covered in a thin sheen of sweat, looked completely indifferent to this chain of events. His two chins - almost three now, Sam noticed - wobbled back and forth freely as he chuckled, panting like a racehorse all the while.
“Actually,” Dean said, still massaging Cas’s stomach, “I got permission from the hardware store to use their industrial scale after-hours, and I was gonna surprise you with a visit. I guess it’s not a surprise anymore, but what do you think?”
- and headbutted Dean in his eagerness to kiss him again. With a little more tongue this time around.
Sam checked in with the hostess for their reservation, and though she looked fairly annoyed, Dean and Sam were promptly shown their table.
"G-gladly, sir," the cute waiter stuttered. Sam ordered a water - what a fuckin' loser, how were they even related - and the waiter smiled shyly at Dean before he walked away. Dean craned his neck to watch him go. Damn, tight ass too. And was it Dean's imagination, or had the waiter seemed interested in him, too?
Sam’s head poked into the bathroom and he stopped talking, his mouth still slightly open as they stared at each other. The only sounds that remained were the muffled voices of the other patrons and the
“Uh huh.” He was usually way smoother than this, but he couldn’t help it - he felt like he was floating. A few moments passed, and Dean finally asked, “So you don’t mind that I’m a little thick in the waist? Or older than you?”
Later that day, he stared moodily at the light beer he’d ordered while Sam talked about some tech department drama at work, something involving a guy named Andy. Dean had limited himself to his fair share of the cheese fries tonight, but his stomach was growling, used to a much bigger meal by this point, and he was determined to ignore it. He only noticed Sam calling his name after a bottle cap was thrown at his forehead.
Castiel's stomach plummeted as the bell rang. That was four times as far as what they'd done previously, and Cas could barely make it through
He must have heard wrong. “Could you repeat that please?” There was no way he’d just heard Dean say that he was-
Belly-up in his boyfriend’s lap, stuffed to the point of immobility, and fatter than he’d ever been and getting fatter, Dean gave a shit-eating grin and asked, “Can we order dinner first?”
"You're ridiculously, amazingly lazy," Cas said, but he was smiling. He loved giving Dean belly rubs, and they both knew it.
Cas sighed and leaned down to give Dean's double chin a quick kiss. "I'll go, Dean. Should probably pick up some new pants while I'm at it. I don't think those will survive much more abuse."
When the new semester started and Cas got his schedule, he stared at the little black text that read '6th period - Fitness and Wellness.' Otherwise known as gym class. Cas got out of breath going up a flight of stairs; how in God's name was he supposed to survive an entire semester of Gym? When he asked Dean about it, hoping it was some mistake, Dean grimaced sympathetically.
He was right, more or less. Dean’s belly barely squeezed out over his belt and his love handles crushed the waistband. Cas unbuckled his belt and the snap buttons popped open immediately, Dean’s belly dropping and taking up the space it needed, and Dean sighed as he rubbed the red marks where the waistband had been constricting him.
“A little,” he muttered, “but I still have dinner at home after this,” and Cas went up to the counter and ordered another milkshake. Dean spluttered a bit when he brought it back, eyes wide. “Cas, I really shouldn’t have another,” he said with a hand on his belly.
much too tight. Not to mention the fact that he'd started doing his pants up under his not-so-insignificant stomach, letting what should be a flat stomach push out over his waistband and tug at the buttons on his shirt.
"Close the door!" Cas hissed, yanking Dean further into the room by his hand and shutting the door quickly. This wasn't for anyone's eyes but their own.
"Dean, that obviously isn't gonna work," Sam shot back. "You're packed in there like a goddamn sardine. Actually, come to think of it, how the hell have you been getting to work if you can't even get out of your car?"
When Benny didn't respond, Dean glanced over, pie fork sticking out of his mouth. He was staring at Dean's mouth, his own slightly open, pupils blown wide. Dean smirked - hey, he may have been six hundred pounds, but he knew he was still a catch, and Benny was
He conveniently forgot about his gym membership that weekend, and the the next weekend he was at a conference in New York. While there, he continued to eat what he wanted and wished that he still could’ve gotten drinks with Sam even though they were hundreds of miles apart. He also wished that his shape wear wasn’t so damn tight, because it was leaving deep red marks in his skin and getting harder and harder to take off at the end of the day and there was only one more setting until it couldn’t loosen anymore.
"Thought you liked it when I stuffed my face," Dean said cockily, though his cheeks were red as he shoved the spoon in his mouth.
Castiel put a supportive hand on his lower back as he made his slow way to the locker room, attempting to soothe the aches brought on by the bouncing his belly had been subjected to. His back was usually a little sore after a day of lugging around his gut, but this was different, more acute, and Cas was seriously worried that he'd pulled something.
“We weigh a thousand pounds between the both of us,” Dean pointed out, taking a moment to lift his face from Cas’s belly and look up, eyes hooded. “We’d max out the scale.”
Cursing his clumsy self, Cas scrambled to get up as quickly as he could, red in the face. Dammit, he needed to look poised and in-control in front of his future teammates. Not like a baby horse trying to walk for the first time. Hoping no one had seen him, Cas busied himself nonchalantly trying to rub the dirt off his white pants. It was fruitless, as it always was, but that never stopped him from trying.
“Tryin’ to make me fat,” Dean complained one night as he drove Cas home. “I don’t think I’ve eaten that much food in my entire life.”
Cas snorted but did as he was asked, and Dean let out a loud gasp. “What is it?” Castiel asked impatiently, for he couldn’t see the number around his stomach. “Dean?”
In the three or so weeks of school between Thanksgiving and Christmas break, Castiel managed to outgrow both his - Dean's, really - shirts and pants. Dean just let out the pants again, but not much could be done about the shirts, so he ended up with quite a few popped buttons and even a torn seam. His boyfriend, ever-helpful, would just roll his eyes and fix the rips and tears, but Cas noticed the way he blushed high on his cheeks as he sewed.
A little bolder now, the waiter gave him a once over and replied, "Of course, sir. Let me know if you need help with anything." He walked away, hips swaying a bit this time. Once again,
Feeling rebellious over both his thoughts and what he was about to do, Cas's insides tingled as he wrapped his mouth around the bite of pie. A moan ripped its way out of his throat and Cas's eyes widened, his entire world changed. Dean was right. Pie was
"Yes, I think I like blowjobs," Cas said with a look in his eye, and goddammit, he totally knew what he was saying.
Dean was polishing off the plate when Castiel walked by. He waved with his cookie-less hand, unable to offer a better greeting with his mouth full of delicious sugar, and tried to shove down the embarrassing fuzzy feeling he got when Cas said, “Hello, Dean,” in his ridiculous sex line operator voice with his ridiculous head of sex hair.
“Was I?” Dean asked innocently, though he was sure his smirk gave him away. He stretched and reached for his boyfriend, pulled him down for a kiss.
“Right there, babe.” Dean shuddered, made the corresponding moans. His gut was too packed to move much, but the shiver sent ripples through his thick love handles, made his chins wobble. It especially drew attention to Dean’s chest; his breasts had been growing throughout his pregnancy, and as Dean had vehemently rejected wearing a bra, they rested heavily on his upper belly, jiggled with the best of them. Yeah, Dean’d always had moobs - his words, not Cas’s - but this was something else. Castiel had to restrain himself from reaching out to touch.
“Yeah, it’s a bit much,” Alfie admitted, looking uncomfortable even as he said the words. “It kinda feels like you guys might jump each other on the field about fifty percent of the time.”
Cas slowly, painfully made his way around the gym as the other kids played dodgeball, his pace slow enough that he could probably walk faster. Dean's tank top had ridden up above his lower belly roll and love handles and Cas relished in the cool air against his skin, trying to ignore the way puddles of sweat were dripping everywhere else on his body, everywhere skin met skin. He ignored the giggles whenever he passed by a fellow student, ignored the way his rolls slapped against each other with every step, ignored his shame at how hard running was for him, ignored his own labored, wheezy breathing.
Which led Cas to his current predicament. He framed his stomach with his hands and turned sideways in the mirror, studying how his indecently tight waistband made him look bigger than he was, how his belly bulged out over his belt. His new weight was a little easier to hide when clothed, but without a shirt, the results of Cas's gluttony were as clear as day.
"Look at you," Dean whispered, chin hooked over Castiel's shoulder. "Beautiful. And this belly," he said, hefting it up with both hands, still not nearly enough to cover the whole thing. "So big, so fuckin' heavy. You're gorgeous, Cas. Perfect just the way you are."
Three pieces turned into six, the rich, creamy cake more than halfway gone already, and Dean was beyond uncomfortable. His stomach gurgled in protest, the onslaught of heavy food too much for it to handle. Dean groaned and puffed out his cheeks, dropped a tentative hand to his distended middle. He’d gone into ‘automatic feeding mode,’ as Sam said, without realizing it and was paying the price. His stomach was round and bloated, full to bursting, and kept making unhappy noises as it tried valiantly to digest way more cheesecake than one man should ever consume.
"Gym requirement," he said, squeezing Cas's soft side in silent apology when he groaned pitifully. "I'm sorry, babe, I totally forgot about that. I don't think the teacher's gonna cut you a break, either."
Sam's face heated up with a slight flush. He'd always loved to keep in shape, running every morning since his freshman year of high school and going to the gym whenever possible. Both of their parents were pretty fit too, and Dean's ex-girlfriend had been a yoga instructor. You'd think that at least
Dean grunted as he starting walking - well, waddling - after Sam, but Sam just kept getting farther and farther away. Curse Sam and his stupid moose legs. And curse Dean's huge gut for getting in the way of where his own legs needed to go. Don't get him wrong, Dean
"Sorry, little brother, but I can't turn this thing off," Dean smirked, gesturing to himself. "And this is the only way I fit, dickhead. Besides, I think I might do this more often. I'm kinda liking this." He shoved one hand under his belly - and damn, was
"You're the only person I know who'd be excited about a twisted ankle," Dean said with a laugh, kissing Cas gently. "Remember what the nurse said - don't put pressure on it, keep your brace on, and let your boyfriend be as overbearing and doting as possible. Capiche?"
“I’ll get him some more,” Cas announced, ignoring the pleading look Dean shot him. He took Dean’s nearly empty plate and stood up, filled it with an overflowing sandwich and huge pile of potatoes. Mary looked satisfied, Sam looked bored, and Dean looked desperate when Castiel returned. If Dean didn’t finish his plate, his mother would just worry even more.
More or less set in canon. Chubby!Dean is left at the bunker for a month and watches food network too much.
He made the drink quickly and set it down in front of his ridiculously hot customer. When he reached for it with a hand, Dean stopped him. "Look, you- actually, what's your name?"
"Fine," Sam said after a moment, eyebrow raised, still surveying the carnage. Cas didn't say anything, and Dean shifted uncomfortably. "But christ, Dean, what did you do while we were gone? Eat a small country?"
You see, Sam hadn't actually seen Dean for going on three months. His last year of law school had been extremely busy, and Dean actually lived a couple hours away. Of course they'd texted and talked on the phone on a weekly basis, but the point was that Sam hadn't actually
Although Dean bristled at the implications, he knew Sam was right. Even if he did manage to work the weight off (and that was a big if at this point) he needed to actually fit into his clothes. “Okay,” he said, and Sam lit up. “But I thought your parents were in town?”
This was actually part of a 5+1 thing I’ve had sitting in my drafts for almost a year, but it makes sense by itself, so I figured I’d just post what I had finished! Wanted to post a short update before I really get cracking on some longer fics
Dean huffed and puffed, his face tinted red, sweat rolling down his temples both from the Kansas heat and the exertion of eating so much.  But he didn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon; Dean still ate like a starving man, a corn dog in each hand, and he only stopped eating long enough to direct Castiel’s hands, or maybe to take a sip of coke. Cas knew they made an odd pair, the fat, bossy omega and the lean, submissive alpha, but he loved nothing more than doting on Dean. If that made him look like a chump to some people, then so be it.
Dean's mouth watered and his stomach roared as he got to the front of the line. He grabbed three plates, as he didn't want to make a lot of trips, and started filling them until food was about to fall off the sides. Gourmet burgers, mashed potatoes, prime rib, lamb chops, biscuits, macaroni and cheese, and so many packets of butter... Dean was set, at least for the next half hour. He wasn't sure how he was gonna get out of the booth after these three plates - as he would need the plates refilled, of course - but for now, he was satisfied.
Grunting unattractively, Dean managed to pull the fabric over his belly. It was a little loose in the shoulders and tight in the waist, but it was a huge improvement over his previous shirt, even if the solid color did nothing to hide his dumb nipples. Dean stood and tucked the polo into his pants, buttoned up below his gut, and smoothed a hand over the material, looked in the mirror. This was the first time he’d worn real clothes without any shape wear. It didn’t look totally horrible. He had obvious love handles and a belly and the shirt creased a bit under his chest, but he didn’t look sloppy. Just heavy. Still wouldn’t want to go to work like this, but that was a whole ‘nother can of worms.
snowing, so they'd admitted defeat. Dean took the opportunity to pamper Cas again, and Cas spent all day in bed watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and dozing off whenever the mood struck. His boyfriend joined him for most of the day, only leaving to bring food back from the cafeteria, and when the following day - a Friday - was called off as well, they spent their time similarly.
Since their previous pitcher had graduated last year, Dean made the team easily, though he probably would have made it even if they already had a pitcher. He was just that good. They had a designated hitter for the pitcher anyway, so his somewhat subpar skills in the hitting and running departments didn’t matter in the slightest.
A few seconds passed. "So," Cas began, "was your - frankly obvious, by the way, as you're clearly not heterosexual - admission of your sexuality your way of saying that you'd like to sleep with me?"
Though his shirt had long ago ridden up around his upper belly, he'd still managed to pop two of the buttons, and now Cas's entire belly was on display, pooched out into his (and Dean's) lap. He giggled and panted and opened his mouth for another chocolate, blissfully ignorant of the way Dean's face was bright red. The bag was gone soon enough, and Cas sighed again and grabbed Dean's wrists, brought them around to his belly, and demanded that he rub.
That night, Dean ate more candy than he thought humanly possible. He fell asleep surrounded by wrappers, both hands cradling his overtaxed gut, too far into his food coma to bother cleaning up.
Dean’s body reflected his new civilian status. His beard was more grey than brown at this point - although his hair was still annoyingly grey-free - and his laugh lines were settled deep into his face. He was still strong and muscular, but a thick layer of softness blunted his hard edges and made him look more like a teddy bear than a grizzled ex-hunter. In Cas’s opinion, Dean was more beautiful than ever, the added weight complimenting but not overwhelming his features. Castiel, on the other hand...
"I noticed," Dean whispered with a twinkle in his eye. "Don't worry about it, you can borrow mine until you get the chance to order some more. We're probably about the same size anyway."
As Dean flipped the menu to the back, he noticed the "Specials" section. In big block letters, the menu exclaimed, "THURSDAY NIGHT - $15 ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET!"
By the time he made it back to the booth, his stomach was growling like a bear. He hadn't had anything to eat in four whole hours. It was the longest he'd gone without eating in weeks (even including sleep, as Dean made a point to have nightly midnight snacks). Dean shoved his plates off to Sam as he situated himself back on the bench seat, ignoring Sam's mumbling as he lifted his gut and pivoted.
Dean squatted down with a grunt to start up the scale. “Thousand pounds,” he responded, “so don’t worry. Now get your hot little bod over here.”
seen him. And he didn’t recognize the voice, so it was probably a new guy, someone young and impressionable, who had just borne witness to their captain’s face plant.
Though he hummed in agreement, Cas begged to differ. Dean’s facial features were soft, his lips plush and pink, and he was the owner of a rather generous set of curves. His hips and belly were thick enough that they almost spanned the width of his wide shoulders, and his pecs had softened into two little handfuls that rested on his gut. Although the beard and muscles and deep voice clearly marked Dean as a man, his round, curvy body had softened his edges, made him a little more feminine-looking, and he truly was beautiful.
"Nothing's better than pie," he proclaimed, brushing off the top of his belly where chip crumbs had congregated.
“That’s ten pounds in the last month,” Cas pointed out. “You’re getting pretty big, Dean - you usually gain that much in a year.”
Crap, it would be pretty rude if Dean fell asleep in the middle of talking to Cas, no matter how full and sleepy he was. Dean opened his eyes and sat up a little straighter, grunted from the effort of doing so with a stuffed stomach. “Shit, sorry.”
Two twenty really wasn’t that bad, Dean knew that, but he’d gained thirty-five pounds in just over two goddamn months. Which
"Oh my god, I've said it before and I'll say it again - how are we related?" The waiter seemed to perk up a little once Dean made it clear that he and Sam were related, that they weren't on a date. Yeah, the dude definitely had the hots for Dean. Seemed that he had good taste in more than just milkshakes. "Anyways, darlin', I'll have the buffet special."
The amazing eyes belonged to a twenty-something guy with major bed head, pink lips, and a little too much stubble. He looked completely mortified, his eyes wide and mouth open, and he said, "I apologize, that wasn't me, my friend-"
"Would you like to go to Denny's?" Cas asked, eyes locked on Dean's gut. "They have all you can eat pancakes."
Dean grunted around a mouthful of chips in response, and Cas took that as his cue to start eating. He took a bite, and
Soon enough, Cas was squeezing himself into Dean’s work truck. The bench seat was all the way back but Cas
Dean ordered his usual medium pepperoni, large meat lovers, and coke, though he splurged and went for the two liter size. If Cas was gonna treat himself today, Dean might as well do the same. Well, he kinda treated himself every day, but whatever. He was thirsty.
He grumpily grabbed the bill and stuffed it in his vest pocket along with his other tips. That was another thing - he wasn't very friendly, and he never stopped to talk, but he
"Can you let out my pants again?" Cas blurted out as Dean started to change his shorts. When Dean lifted his head and raised an eyebrow, Castiel mumbled, "They're getting tight."
However, after a bit of time spent swearing and struggling, Dean managed to get the hooks together. All the in-between hooks didn’t stand a chance in hell of meeting, but this was better than nothing, he supposed. His belly still had an obvious curve to it, but it was definitely compressed, and it wasn’t like these things were made with a gut this size in mind — he hadn’t been expecting a miracle. Anyways, Sam hadn’t seen him wearing this stuff, and it probably would freak him out if Dean suddenly showed up all fake skinny.
“Dean,” Sam said, cutting him off, “you’re really not fat. Your body’s just adjusting to eating like a normal person again, it’ll figure itself out eventually.”
He scrolled through the channels absentmindedly as he picked at his cast, stopping when he landed on the Food Network. Dean watched people scramble to make the best lasagna for five minutes before it hit him that hey, Sam wasn't home, no one was there to bitch at him about 'eating right for a man his age' - whatever the hell that meant - and there was leftover pizza in the fridge. And maybe he'd just had lunch, but whatever, his leg was broken and he wanted to treat himself.
Friday night, Dean sat alone in his hotel room, shirtless and munching on the famous Junior’s cheesecake he’d treated himself to. Whenever Dean took off his shape wear lately he’d just take off the shirt he was wearing as well, as he couldn’t get the buttons done up without the extra layers of constricting fabric to hold his belly back. It was fine, Dean was gonna go to the gym soon. He’d lose the weight. But for now he wanted to enjoy his cheesecake in peace, so he shoved aside the anxiety building in his chest and served himself another slice to take his mind off the whole matter.
Two egg rolls, all the lo mein, most of the beef, and half the fried rice were already down the hatch when Dean started to really feel full. He managed to eat half of the chicken and another egg roll despite the fact, but then he had to stop and tug his shorts off because they’d grown too tight even under his stomach, and then he took some more time to give himself a quick rub-down. This was utter bliss. Dean loved feeling full like this, loved how his whole body felt warm and heavy, and the food was delicious, practically begging him to eat more of it.
"Bee," I begin, "I know you heal fast and all, but I hate seeing you in pain. It eats at me. I care about you too much to see you suffer."
"For lying to you, keeping secrets from you, being rude to you, all of it," Dean's gaze drifted to the ground.
Dean and I stormed to our rooms while laughing. I plopped down onto my bed and closed my eyes ready for another day in hell.
Little did Dean know that would be the start of his love story with Castiel Novak and the beginning of a new story for the two of them. Not long after, Dean and Cas’ fake relationship turned into a real one. Charlie got with Rowena and Sam confessed to being in a relationship with Eileen. Gabriel seemed a little crushed about both Eileen and Rowena being taken, however, he ended up continuing with his prankster ways. Dean and Castiel got married on Valentines Day and their real relationship began on November 5th.
Once Cas finished he got up and collected his things for the day. He ran out of our apartment and I could hear the sound of his footsteps getting fainter as he ran down the hall. I wondered where he was off in a rush to. I didn't care much and I just continued to eat.
I pulled back on Baby and heard her roar turn into an intoxicating purr as she was brought to life. We sped off to the hospital, the whole time Sammy was complaining about how he was alright and I was just going to end up adding to the pile of bills to pay.
All of us went back to enjoying what was on, everyone except Charlie that was. Charlie was practically vibrating in her chair from restlessness.
“Alright, that’s enough,” Charlie said, pausing what we were watching. “So, I’m going to be honest. The only reason I’m here is to let you guys know that y’all better get better soon because there is a party coming up and it’s going to be epic.”
Dean didn't end up making dinner for me today. He did make some for Lisa though. I don't mind. I'm not hungry much anyways. I'm sure other people deserve food more than I do. I did get to study and read some fanfic.
I got out to check and realized that I hit Sammy. Though he is a tough one, I still don’t want to risk anything. I’ll just take him to the hospital and we can clear the rest up later. Sammy shot back up into the air with an “I’m alright!” but that didn’t work for me and he was going to sit his ass down on that hospital bed and get checked even if that meant sedating him to do so.
I glanced back curiously eyeing at the curtains surrounding the mystery man. I continued on my way to the restroom and had a difficult time getting the door to open with my limping leg. Meg stifled her laugh as she came over and helped me push the door open. The inside of the bathroom was much different from the room.
I ran into a room and back out to see Sammy standing there. I looked him dead in the eye as we silently decided to make a run for it. We ran down the stairs and into the kitchen for a quick morning snack. We ran out the front door, I was thankful to see that Cas and Dean were waiting outside in the oh so amazing '67 Chevy Impala.
"Are you okay?" I slowly neared him and was shocked once I got close enough to see him. I took a step back and tripped over a rock. I could hear Cas approaching me but I was so angry and scared and I just didn't know how to handle how I was feeling. Suddenly, it wasn't Cas approaching me anymore, it was Dad. My mind swirled, thoughts were coming in at a thousand miles per hour, heart racing, blood pumping. I trembled as I thought about all the bad things he has done to me--all the bad things he could still do to me. Instead of being understanding and taking a moment to think, I threw a rock at him.
“Well, some may argue that it’s July 2nd considering that was when the Second Continental Congress actually voted for the approval of a resolution of independence. Sure, July 4th was when Congress adopted the official Declaration of Independence, however, most didn’t sign that until August!”
After that, Dean's dad got busy and left to go travel around for his work or whatever. Dean, Adam, and Sam decided to move in with us and of course John decided that would be for the best so that Chuck could keep an eye on them. Dean decided that he couldn't live with the constant reminder that his father was trying to dictate his life and although my life was better than his, I was abused too. Not just at school but at home too, I was an easy target and most of my siblings didn't know and the rest were in on it. I decided to move with Dean and although Dean can be cold, he's just scared his past is going to catch up to him and that it will all be the same. He is scared that people will bully him for who he is or what happened to him so instead of standing up for himself, he decided that he wanted to try and fit in. There is more to the story but it is best left for another day.
“Oh,” Sammy laughed as he pointed to his wounds, “these? Dean hit me with the car. Always knew he was a klutz.”
"Calm your tits, it's only eleven at night. You fell asleep and I didn't want to wake you," my heart melted when those words came out of his mouth but I reminded myself not to fall into temptation. I might have feelings for Dean, but he doesn't feel that way towards me and I sure don't want to risk our friendship.
Above the entire room, there was a machine for people that needed help standing up and/or that would help guide you along the way and stabilize as you walked. If you were going to fall or needed a little rest, it would hold you up. The restroom seemed to be decently open and spacey. I smiled as I thought about how well planned this restroom seemed to be. There were a few other things that I had no idea what the use was for but instead of analyzing them, I did what I needed to do.
"Dean," my voice cracked as I struggled to speak. I wanted to tell Dean that I was going to move out.  I just couldn't handle the visits with Lisa and the plans that kept getting canceled. I wanted my best friend back and it was at this moment that I wish I never figured out in the first place. Maybe if I didn't, Dean would still be close to me. Maybe, Dean would still hang out with me like we did before. It wasn't that we were growing apart but it was that he was spending less and less time with me and more and more time with her. When she wasn't here, we spent our time together, we baked, we played, we laughed, and joked. Although it was fun when we did get our time together, I just wish it could be like before. Maybe I was being selfish but a week had passed and I was getting exhausted. I was tired of Lisa coming over constantly and acting like she owned the place.
All I could do was look at him because I didn't want to inflict more pain than the pain that I was already going through. I just looked at Dean deep in his eyes hoping that he would understand that I'm thirsty. I loved his green eyes. They're so amazing... their electric green tints blended in nicely with the warm hug of a leaf green ring. The tiny veins stretching out, reaching for what they could, spread out like tiny claws searching for their way out but in such a manner that it was calming. His beautiful pupils fit subtly with the luscious green. There were some hints of brown but just enough to make your heart melt. It reminded me of a soft caramel glaze, melted ever so softly into my heart.
“You weren’t kidding when you said any minute,” Meg harshly whispered at the three of us. She got up and opened the door.
“Um, the person next to me? They let out a scream but I think they were trying to cover it up with a blanket or something,” I grumbled as I fidgeted with the wiring.
Sam broke out in a fit of giggles and had to put his hands on his stomach to try and stop himself. You could tell that all that air hurt but he couldn’t stop his fit of laughter and that only made Dean laugh which then caused me to laugh. It was a domino effect that caused us all to laugh. Soon, we realized the reason behind this laughter was because Sam got a video of Dean looking up at the ceiling with a red and bruised up face with wounds, connected to monitors. I was next to him in my bed connected to monitors as well but in the video it looked like I was right next to Dean. When Sam pressed play on the video, Dean screamed I love you and then slumped back and stared pointlessly at his feet until the video stopped. I struggled to contain my laughter and then broke out crying through my laughs because it hurt so much.
The world is not black and white and when you come to think about it, what even is the world? What would water look like without any color? What would water look like without any surroundings? If you put water in a pink container the water will appear pink until you pour it out and suddenly the surroundings have changed its appearance but what would it look like alone? I have so many questions and yet so little answers. What is love? What is a lover without someone to love? What truly is beauty? When you come to think about it more and more questions continue to pile up but I can tell you something, without you, I am nothing. Please stay strong if I am gone. Remember that even the strongest winds die down and even the brightest flames go out. The thing about flames is that they can start back up again. It can go out but you can always start another. Please keep the flame going when I am gone and remember to spread that warmth with others. You may think your life is simply one out of billions but your life is worth billions and you serve a purpose. I love you. Shine bright. Love you always.
He walked over and his bare feet smacked against the floor as water spattered out around him. He smiled nervously as he approached and pulled out his chair. He sat down and I continued staring at him, a little too obviously. Cas cleared his throat and I quickly retreated my gaze. I wonder if Cas is cold...  My eyes skim over the room trying to find the thermostat. It was at a decent temperature but I still couldn't help but worry.
"Stop! You're going to leave a mark!" Luc pushed Gabe's hand off of him and Gabe rolled off the bed and out the door.
There was no place I would rather have been at that very moment. All the clouds moved out, the drizzle stopped, the fog rolled away, and it was brighter than ever before. Brighter than ever thought - no ever imagined, before. At that moment, our flames mixed and we became the sun. We became what brightened up each other’s days. We became unstoppable.
I sighed, already knowing I would have to be the one to inform her of the recent events. “Well, Dean may have hit me on the head with a rock due to past memories and a bit of his ptsd. That then led to me being kept here for a while. I didn’t do too well and didn’t want him to come over and see me in the state I was in so I didn’t allow him over. Dean then went to his father’s house and was shocked to find the one and only John Winchester. His father left him in pretty bad shape and I assume Sam figured that from the amount of time Dean had taken something must’ve been up. Sam then drove to John’s with the impala and found Dean. Dean then got in with Sam and somehow accidentally ran him over, mistaking him for a shelf. They came to the hospital and ended up in my room and then we made up. Oh, I was with Meg and that was an awkward conversation. Dean just broke up with Lisa a few minutes ago and Gabe came around a little while before hand with Miracle and all this stuff,” I concluded.
A few minutes later, Dean rolled up in his Impala and drove us home. Once we got inside, he then rushed off somewhere else. I wondered what he was such in a hurry for but I didn't think much of it. I continued on with my day and made dinner with Gabe. We ended up making a mess in the kitchen and by the time Gadreel had come home from work, it looked like a tornado had hit the kitchen.
Suddenly, I had hoped about talking to Lisa. Meg was very calm and took it well. I knew she was going to go a long way in our lives and be a great friend at that moment.
I turned around rather quickly and tried to hide my grin. Maybe Dean wanted to hang out or spend some more time with me. Maybe Dean finally broke it off with Lisa, maybe Dean liked me back, maybe Dean had a surprise or something important to tell me. I knew it was silly but I still have hope.
Oh no. I love Hester, she is my girlfriend after all, I just… I never expected this to happen. I wanted to wait till I found the right person, the right time, the right mood. My breath hitches and I nervously make my way around her and to the counter. I could feel my hands sweating and I urged myself to pull myself together and be a man- like dad would want me to.
“I… It’s… How- I love this. It’s beautiful,” Charlie whispered before grinning. “Beautiful just like this pretty woman over here.”
“Maybe, just maybe, we should try getting your dad to go to a rehab center or get some therapy,” Cas let out a small and hopeful smile, “maybe it could help you guys get closer. It could create a better, safer, kinder environment. You deserve that.”
“Guys…” Meg said, grabbing our attention, “I wouldn’t want to kill the mood or anything but the lady left her purse here.”
"No! I'm sorry, I was just surprised by the question. I didn't really know about her. I just found out last night." I mentally slapped myself for being so awkward. Dean shifted in his seat and the silence was biting at me.
“First of all, those ideas seem pretty far fetched. Second, stop waving that comb at me like it’s some sort of threat. Third, get your act together Winchester, you’ve gone through much worse and this is what gets at you?! A boy sitting next to you in class. I know for a fact that you’ve dealt with much worse, you’ve probably gone to hell and back at this point, twice!” Charlie exclaimed, grabbing the comb and looking at Dean’s hair with satisfaction. She ushered Dean towards their next class and continued talking, “If anything, you should be concerned about the bill you’re going to have to pay next week or the groceries you’re going to have to buy. Should I mention the college fees? What about your dad coming over next weekend? What about the party that’s being held at your place this Friday! The list goes on! Should I keep naming things?”
I walked over and felt the floor brush against my feet as the dripping water splattered everywhere. I smiled up at Dean nervously and pulled out a chair on the right side of the table. I sat down and looked up at Dean. I could see him staring at me but I didn't really care. I cleared my throat and his gaze left me. I could see his eyes dart around the room and I wondered what he was searching for. I looked at him confused when I saw his eyes settle on the thermostat but thankfully he didn't seem to notice.
Once Cas got his lazy butt up and ready to go, we got into Baby and headed on our way to pick up Sam and Gabe. Once we stopped by the house and picked them up, we headed to school. Dad was always out at work and mom passed away in a fire earlier on, this meant Sam and Adam got to stay at the Novak's.
They have burgers and beer and Dean laughs, a bit too loud and a bit too long, but that’s just what it is. And one day it will stop hurting. He still has Sam left. His baby brother, the person he loves most in this world. And he is free. Free from Chuck and his twisted games, free to do whatever he likes. He needs to remember that when it gets worse.
When Dean reaches heaven Bobby is there, waiting for him. Dean hugs him. Bobby smiles. “I missed you, idjit.” They share a beer. Then Dean goes to visit the others. They all live around and Baby is there waiting for him, taking him to their houses. First, he makes a stop at his parent’s. They have dinner. But eventually Dean moves on. There are so many more he needs to see. Charlie, the one from this world, Jo and Ellen, Rufus, it takes him a while.
The job is easy enough. A couple of vamps terrorising a small town just outside of Lawrence. Returning there is bittersweet. Dean would have expected it to be harder. But he has made his peace, and so has Sam.
When they find out, it’s a small pack, Dean is almost disappointed. They have agreed that this is they’re last hunt. And he knows it’s for the best. But a part of him wishes it would go on a little longer. Maybe he just doesn’t want to face the empty that is waiting for him back home and in his head.
They don’t talk about that one night, not for a very long time. But Cas doesn’t seem to mind. He just keeps being Cas, always smiling when Dean looks at him, always being there for him.
Sam marries Eileen two years later. Their first kid is on the way. Dean has proposed to name it after him when it is born. For some reason Sam has reclined. He still gets to be the godfather though, so he doesn’t complain too much about it.
A minute later Dean hears a car pulling up. Doors open and close, people get out. Somebody screams. There’s a loud bang. And then quiet. Somebody is walking up to the barn. Dean raises his blade.
Dean is the first one to break the silence. “Come on!” he says, smiling. “I’m gonna make us some food. I’m starving.” Sam slowly follows him to the kitchen. Dean is not fine. They both know it. And they both ignore it. For now.
He doesn’t let go, not for a while. When he finally does his eyes are teary. He doesn’t care. “What was Sam praying for?” he asks.
Dean expects him to return to heaven again, but when they reach the bunker Cas is still there. He walks in with them, he has dinner with them, they watch a film and when Dean leaves to go to bed Cas is there to say goodnight. And he is there to say good morning the next day. And the following day. And all the days that come afterwards. He is there when Sam moves out, when Dean gets a job as a car engineer, when Charlie comes over, when Sam and Dean have dinner with Jody and Donna. Sometimes Dean wonders if it gets boring for Cas, living with him. After all, he is an angel and Dean nothing more but a human, a mortal. But then he remembers what Cas has told him, before the empty took him. He wants to say it back. Wants to tell Cas that he can have what he wants. But it’s the one thing he can’t get himself to do. Not yet. And he doesn’t need to. Cas already knows.
They decide to go on one last hunt, to celebrate the good old times. It’s just the two of them again and Baby of course.  Dean is driving, they listen to Led Zeppelin and Sam talks about finishing law school. And then he talks about moving in with Eileen. And Dean is happy for him, he really is, but the bunker is going to be even quieter with Sam gone as well. But there’s nowhere Dean wants to go, nothing he wants to do, so he will stay anyway and wait for the day when it gets better.
They follow the vamps to a remote barn. Dean parks the Impala at a close field and they get their blades. They smile at each other as they walk up to the front door. This is how it was always meant to be. Saving people, hunting things, the family business. No god involved.
He walks back to his room, sits down on his bed and just stares at the wall. He doesn’t move for hours. Eventually, the tears start to fall, one after one. And he keeps staring, and for the first time he allows himself to think about Cas again. About what Cas said and about what Dean didn’t say and the things they will never say to each other and it hurts. But it is okay.
“They’re driving right up to the barn. It’s like ten of them in that car.” Sam says and Dean can hear that he is running. “I’m getting the Impala but they will reach you first.”
People start dancing later and eventually it’s just Dean and Cas who are left at the tables. Dean has a beer. He watches his little brother. Sam is smiling. He looks happy. And for once in their life, it will stay that way.
“I knew you wouldn’t get out of here.” he scolds Dean after he has stepped back again. Dean shrugs. “What can I say man, I’m not running from fucking vamps.” They share a look, knowing that’s not all. But it doesn't matter any more. Cas is back. And Dean Winchester is saved.
Cas knows what he’s talking about right away. He squeezes Dean’s hand. “Always.” he says. And he means it.
Dean and Cas go there together. It’s a nice, small ceremony, no church and just a couple of friends. Family. Dean doesn’t cry. At all. But there was wind, and it blew him right in the face and that’s why they are red afterwards.
There is a part of him that doesn’t believe it. Doesn’t dare to. But Lucifer is gone and Chuck is gone and there is no one left to play tricks like that on him anymore. “Are you really here?” he asks. Cas nods. “Jack brought me to heaven first, but then I heard Sam praying and came down.” And Dean rushes over to him and pulls him into a hug.
He hefted the dessert plates onto his stomach, grunting a little at the added pressure on his tender gut. Wasting no time, he started shoveling food in as fast as he could, trying to get dessert done with before his stomach even registered that he was eating. He didn't care if he made a mess; it was more important to get the delicious cookies, cakes, and pastries down as quickly as possible. When he finished the first plate and saw that the second was filled mostly with pie, Dean almost came.
Dean stopped with the spoon halfway to his mouth, and a drop of ice cream dripped down and splattered right on his chest. He pouted, picking at the spot, and whined, "Look what you made me do!"
Dean whimpered and managed to stutter out an apology, but it had been a while since his dick had had anything on it besides his own right hand.
When Dean got home, he stripped off the shape wear and lounged in his underwear in front of his TV, ordered a large pizza and bread sticks, and proceeded to eat everything while watching some shitty rom-com he’d stumbled across. He didn’t even notice how much he’d eaten until it was gone, but oh god, an alien had to be inside of him, because Dean felt like he was gonna burst. Dean moaned. This was
Dean scrambled up from his seat, and Cas tried not to let his eyes linger on Dean's plush backside as he fast-walked over to the desert section of the cafeteria. He couldn't help the traitorous voice in his head that whispered,
Didn't follow the prompt to the letter - Dean can still get around a bit - but considering the biggest I've written him is 530ish, he's pretty big ;)
safety pins later, Dean's pants were on. More or less. He'd linked the pins to each other and through his pants while Cas had lifted his belly - an experience which Cas was still reeling from, feeling the weight and warmth of that beautiful gut in his own two hands. The final product was a red-faced Dean with a sizable muffin top all the way around his girth, a spare tire hanging precariously over his button, and a small swath of black boxer-briefs barely visible between the unzippable zipper and straining pins.
But Saturday morning, Dean was cursing himself. He had an ice skating date with an old flame from college, Cole, who’d texted him out of the blue a few days ago. He’d only bought new slacks with Sam, no jeans, and as much as Dean enjoyed his suits, he knew that no one wore dress pants to an outdoor ice skating rink. His best pair of jeans still buttoned underneath his belly, but only just, and they were uncomfortably tight. They made him look huge. It was also getting increasingly difficult to button his shirts, and all the straining buttons made him feel sloppy.
Dean settled even further into his seat, unbothered by this recent development, although he did reach under his gut to find just where it was touching the seat. He shoved his hand between his skin and the seat and lifted slightly, his fat giving way much easier with the help of the water. It was usually too difficult for him to jerk off while sitting down, but he was getting hard anyway, and the water
“What the fuck, Smith,” he muttered to himself, and his stomach responded with a loud noise. He needed to fix this before it got even more out of control.
He could feel more judgmental eyes upon them, but he didn’t care. So what if they thought Dean was a pig? His mate was beautiful and surprisingly healthy, and, to put it one way, Castiel didn’t give a fuck about what everyone else thought. Happiness was coming off of Dean in waves, and that was all that really mattered.
They both gave a mighty yank upwards, Dean red in the face as he and Cas tried to get the slacks above his ass. Dean sucked his gut in, and Cas felt his face flush when Dean's belly wobbled and shook without really reducing in size at all. Despite Dean's still-muscular physique, his new fat had grown in soft and jiggly, and it jiggled madly as Dean jumped and grunted and cursed.
Still unsure as to how Dean had managed to actually turn the steering wheel - especially considering the fact that, regardless of what Dean said, he was in
It was quiet for a moment. Dean closed his eyes once more, leaned back into the cushions. He startled when hot breath tickled at his ear.
The first time Dean ate at Devilish Delights, he knew it would become his new favorite place. He'd heard about it from his friend Victor, a cop who swore by the new bakery's donuts, and Dean, food-lover extraordinaire, visited at the first possible opportunity. One bite into their 'vampire muffin' - red velvet with molten chocolate on the inside - and Dean was hooked. He proceeded to order one of everything they had, eat all of it in-store in one of their booths (the tables weren't bolted down, thank god), then got a dozen donuts to go. Which he promptly ate in the parking lot.
Dean’s mouth immediately started watering when Cas came back with their substantial lunch. “How much do I owe you?” he asked, eyes locked on the prize.
, Dean had now made up his mind about coming here more often. Soft-looking hair, gorgeous eyes, pink lips... oh yeah, he'd be coming here a
Their cute waiter came back with Sam's water and Dean's milkshakes, setting Sam's drink in front of him while he held the two shakes awkwardly. He seemed unsure as to where to set the shakes, as Dean's belly took up most of his dining area.
He wrapped his lips around the second shot, keeping eye contact with Dean once again, and Dean could feel his dick press into his gut insistently. Dean pressed his belly into the counter and gave a low groan at the increased pressure.
Emboldened by Dean's very positive response, Cas hummed and swished his hips from side to side, pleased when Dean stared at his swaying belly. "I got some for you, too, if you want to put it on," he said as he guided Dean's hands to his waist.
Fighting the instinct to argue, Cas resigned himself to his fate and did a half-hearted jumping jack, the air sucked out of his lungs when he landed and his heavy belly jolted downward. He gasped and jumped again, thankful beyond belief when Walker's attention was caught by some other student behind him. Jumping jacks were horrible enough without the gym teacher's judgmental gaze upon him.
Dean’s hopes were crushed when the tank top he picked out barely covered his belly button. He wasn’t about to put on shape wear to go to the gym — he’d probably pass out if he tried to exercise in that belt — and his shirt certainly wasn’t doing him any favors. It showcased the fleshy spare tire at his waist and creased under his chest, which he hadn’t even noticed getting bigger, but the extra flesh there turned his already perky nipples into headlights, something that was usually hidden by his many patterned shirts and handy dandy compression tank. He grabbed the part of his belly that peeked out from under his shirt and winced. Why hadn’t he thought of this before?
He sat down heavily on his bed and ripped the tank top off, tried not to notice how his stomach pooched out more in his lap than it had a little while ago, how it folded into two thick rolls when he slouched over like this. He’d gained more weight. Dean looked into the mirror and once again saw that his pecs were softening up, threatening to rest on his gut, and that his arms had lost their definition under a thin layer of pudge. Dean was heavier than he’d ever been and growing larger by the day, and it was getting harder and harder to hide his body. But how was he supposed to lose the weight if he couldn’t go to the gym? He needed a way to force himself to work out, and he’d failed at doing so at home.
Prompt from Does It Matt3r over on Dreamwidth: "Since you put that you have no weight limit, I want you to write a fic with Dean being the biggest you've ever written! I'd prefer not astronomically obese, but definitely immobile with descriptions, please! :D And have the pairing be either Dean/Cas or Dean/Benny! I love both and thank you!"
No matter how hard Dean tugged, the flaps refused to meet over the soft swell of his middle. He sucked in, wrenched the sides together, but still no cigar. The little gold button managed to just brush the hole on the other side, and Dean got his hopes up before he realized that this was quite literally as far as they’d go, ‘cause the waistband was slicing into his sides and might actually start to cut him if he pulled any harder. Either that or the fabric would split.
“Okay,” Dean said to himself as they approached the floor scale. “I just gotta turn this thing on, and then it’s smooth sailing.”
"It's your fault for being so attractive," Cas said, and Dean blushed. They sat in strangely comfortable silence for a few minutes, just enjoying the company, not to mention the afterglow.
Dean, the mature adult that he was, couldn’t resist saying, "You could be coming on me, too," and although Cas rolled his eyes, he couldn't help but notice how his hands tightened around his belly.
Cain obliged and thumbed at Dean’s bottom lip when he pulled away. “Oh yes. I couldn’t focus at all, and I had to cut the meeting off right in the middle of Crowley’s dreadful pitch about some bad idea or another.”
