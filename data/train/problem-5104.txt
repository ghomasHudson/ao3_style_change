Almost afraid to reach down and touch him, Steve took a shuddering breath and steeled himself as he gingerly rolled Tony on to his back on the filthy bathroom floor and pressed shaking fingers to the pulse point at his throat almost laughing in shock when he felt the thready beat. It was enough comfort to bring everything back to sharp reality as he took in the condition of his lover; there was so much blood on Tony’s face that he couldn’t even tell where it was coming from.
When the door opened again to admit paramedics Steve noticed they had drawn a crowd of onlookers outside and curled his body protectively around Tony, shielding him from their view as he spotted several mobile phones. People had no shame and it set Steve’s teeth on edge, made him want to snarl at them and smash their phones for being so inconsiderate. Just because Tony was a celebrity didn’t make him any less human or deserving of decency.
‘Captain,’ Thor declared solemnly ‘Natasha has informed me that this battle was one of hate, I find I do not understand the meaning behind this but I want to offer you and Anthony my solidarity. Though I find myself uneasy without the presence of an enemy to swing my hammer towards, our friend has been injured and we cannot adequately avenge him.’ It was uncommon to see Thor looking so stern outside of his armour, but looking at him now in civilian clothes with a severe expression gave Steve a new respect for his comrade and how heavily this was weighing on him.
Tony had stopped now, staring down the young woman with a determined look on his face. ‘There are a lot of people out there who are worth the time and effort, but maybe I’m also a little selfish in my reasons.’ With a small blush creeping over his cheeks Tony turned to look up at Steve, causing his breath to catch in his throat at the unadulterated love and lust that was just for Steve before he turned back to the cameras with a sheepish look. Tony slid his hand down Steve’s hand and linked their fingers tightly for the cameras to see. ‘I think when, and I mean when because it’s going to happen, I will be down there with everyone else celebrating and hopefully marrying the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.’
‘One time!’ Tony protested weakly, pulling his hand from Steve to reach for the generic paper cup holding his coffee. Steve pulled it out of his reach with a shake of his head. ‘You guys are terrible and I hate you all.’ The pout he managed to pull off around the bruising and broken nose was impressive, but Steve still wasn’t sharing his coffee.
‘We need to clear everyone away, someone will need to stay and talk to the police and get in touch with SHIELD.’ It was easier to fall back to Captain America in this situation even as his heart refused to calm down and he rubbed his face roughly on his sleeve. ‘We need to get ahead of this,’ he turned to Natasha ‘get in touch with Pepper and let her know, people already had their phones out it won’t be long before it’s on the news. Clint you can be in charge of liaising between SHIELD and the NYPD I want our full cooperation on this. It was an unprovoked hate crime on a civilian, being us though it won’t stay that simple.’ His team mates just nodded pulling out their phones and casting a last glance towards Tony before moving out.
Two months ago a lucky reporter had caught a very rare public moment between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers coming out of a café together, hand in hand as Tony had been leaning in to Steve and their faces very close together. While the majority of the public had been in applause of their relationship and celebrated how they were breaking the barriers placed on same sex couples, there were still a large number that disagreed and while some of it was directed at Steve the bulk went on Tony.
A calloused hand came down on his shoulder, startling him. ‘I’m going to get the others and let them know.’ Steve looked up at Clint and nodded blankly before turning his attention back to Tony noting all the obvious injuries as he tried to find the source of the bleeding. Running his hands over Tony’s cheekbone he swept them up to his hairline and found the cut, gritty with small chips of broken glance as his eyes whipped up to the bloody broken mirror above him.
Taking Tony’s hand again Steve smiled supportively and promised everything would be okay, and he was damned sure that it was going to be. Steve had his mind set on this now, determined to get the ball moving and shine light on the abuse happening behind the scenes. Just because they were superheroes didn’t mean they could turn a blind eye, not when there was something that they could do to turn the tables.
‘You look like you have ants in your pants Cap, what’s wrong?’ Clint leaned in close to Steve as he asked the question following his gaze as Steve looked back towards the back of the bar again. Tony had been gone for more than five minutes now, longer than he should be taking to go to the bathroom. ‘
‘Thor can you play crowd control, move everyone back from the door?’ Thor nodded; face grim where he stood between Tony and the men who had attacked him before moving back towards the door as Tony was loaded on to the trolley.
Steve had been ignorant in thinking the worst they would have to face would come from the media and the internet, they were superheroes and he hadn’t thought anyone would act out towards them violently like this. But those men had been hurting Tony because of their relationship, shaming him for ruining the image of Captain America and tarnishing America and her values. Steve didn’t think he was ever going to be able to get those vile words out of his head, the vitriol behind them.
“What? I can’t believe this! You too? Tony this is a human being we’re talking about! Imagine Peter’s feeling if May—”
“Okay! I think we should go now!” Bruce cut off as pink flush crawled to his ears. He dashed out of the car before things got out of hand.
He took his Spiderman outfit, stuffed it in his bag, ran downstairs to meet the Starks and informed them of his need to take a walk in the park, he wouldn’t leave for long. Steve reluctantly allowed him to do so. Tony disagreed bitterly; protectiveness latched within his voice but eventually let Peter go.
“You hear what the boss said people? Get out there and find any information you can about the Parker’s family background,” Steve ushered. Soon everyone finally went with their given job. Clint silently sulked and pouted while going towards out with his new group four on babysitting Peter Parker while the team two: Henry Pym, Henry McCoy and Ben started their research on the Stark tower’s main computer lab, which was below the thirty-third floor.
Tony eyed his husband suspiciously. “By ‘Right away’ you mean as in ‘Now’?” He asked which made Steve smile and nod his head. “Yes.” He simply said. Tony rolled his eyes. “Alright, Cap. I’ll be ready in a second… Just give me a few minute to get dressed before we head our way there.” He claimed as Steve bobbed his head. “All right… I’ll be in the living room if you needed anything.” Steve spoke, going downstairs and sitting in one of the satin armchairs in the living room while he was waiting for Tony.
“What?! Of course I do! You don’t know how many times I wish we could go back in time and prevent our son from being taken from us! You have no idea how many times I wish that we had our son back in our arms safe and sound!” Steve snapped back.
“Tony, look at me?” He softly ordered. Tony did. Steve saw Tony’s expression- It was of concern and worry.
“What? Do I look weird? Funny? Like a freak?” he asked frankly and he was panicking with worry, which made Tony snort at his husband.
“I…yes… But hey! It’s okay. I don’t mind. It’s just that. We’re worried that you guys would react badly if you found out.” Tony enlightened. It made everyone glance at each, clearly worried for their friend.
Steve and Tony found out that Spiderman was indeed their son Peter, like they feared. They were confuse to what to do with this news about finding out that their son was none other than Spiderman? When Peter's wake up from his unconscious? He was face to face with his biological parents, as Steve and Tony begin to counsel the boy, about what to do with him now that their son was Spiderman himself.
They made it to the basketball gym; the place was completely empty from any students, just as Bruce had preferred. With a beat, Bruce pulled out Peter’s files, flipping it open on his laps. “Let’s see, it’s said here you revel in Science? In fact, your science subject seems to be the only one with the highest score, remarkably I might add.” Bruce smiled. “Well, I love science like really, really love it.” Peter chirped.
Reed and Susan had given their advice of letting Peter join the team, he had already been part of the Avengers, so it was out of the question to stop him. The boy would just find a way to sneak out to perform his duty behind their back. It was hopeless to stop him.
When she got back to their ride, everyone eyes were on her. “Well? What happened?” Tony asked. The spy just gave them her ‘Not much’ look and ones needed to know when Black Widow gave you that look, it meant you wouldn’t get anything more form her.
“Francis, can you and Brain along with Clint and Logan go and search for this tag number, finds out it and to whom it belongs too?” Tony probed.
So they were trying to find a way by solving this scheme and experiment and maybe someday they could explain it to Peter with a proof and the right answer when the boy asked for it.
“Before I continue on to record the experiment result? My wife doesn’t know any of this. I’ve doing this to our adopted son behind her back…” Mr. Parker paused for a bit, taking a deep breath before continuing.
Peter got up and got himself ready for school. He went downstairs to have breakfast with his dads before heading to school.  They offered the boy a ride to the school. He gladly accepted it. They arrived in front of the building as Peter got out of the car.
Still angry about the whole ordeal of finding out to who he really is? Peter take a night out duty as Spiderman to cool his mind off. Seeing the boy was distracted by something? Nick Fury took this as a cue to corner the boy and talk him into joining the Avengers. Peter who had no choice agreed to join the Avengers. Wonder what will happen now that Peter was finally part of the Avengers?
- were the Young Avengers. Everyone was gathering around. Some of them were at the meeting table, sitting in their respective seat while few settled down in a nearby mini bar, talking among themselves.
“We are the SHIELD. I’m Nick Fury, the commander of the SHIELD organization.” Nick said as he stepped out from his hiding spot.
After the explanation, May wore a perplexed look, but secretly proud of her nephew. Perhaps it was about time to tell him the truth; of how the boy wasn’t related to them.
“No need to worry about that. I’ll tell Bruce to handle it for you. He’s better at this than I do.” Tony said.
“Uh… Capture you and make you join our little group?” Hawkeye said without thinking. Spiderman snorted. “Me? Join your group? Sorry pal but I’m not interested. I’m one of those people who work along. The loner and emo type. So you better find someone else who’s interested in joining your…whatever villain group you people are. Besides, I’m not a bad guy and I’m sure you villains don’t like a good guy like me.” Peter said.
“So, Spiderman is a boy with a name—“Green Goblin was about to finish his sentence when Peter stopped him by punching him in the stomach, making Green Goblin cough.
Peter got home looking all wrapped up in happiness as he went upstairs in his bedroom and jumped on his bed. He pulled out his cellphone and dialed a familiar number. He waited for the person on the other side of the phone would pick it up, it took three rings and finally the person picked his call and answered it. “What is it, Peter?” a person’s voice toned.
Tony glanced up from the stairs and couldn’t help but to grin at the kid and said. “Well look at you! You look rather dashing, Pete.” Tony proudly claimed. Peter couldn’t help but to return the smile with a blush.
“B-But Tony! We don’t even know if what you’ve said is true. We don’t even have a proof to steel our claims it!” Steve protested.
Everyone at the tower headed back home after the shock of finding out about Peter Parker’s secret (They knew Peter was not aware of it). He was the biological, long lost son of Tony and Steve they’d been looking for fourteen years. Tony even told Bruce to do a blood test on the blood sample they’d found in the Parker couple’s old house; the one labelled as PBRS to see the result and to their shock and horror?
“Steve, I know is not right. But these are the same people who have taken Peter from me-…from us years ago.” Tony objected.
It was around three pm when the meeting was over. Everyone headed back to their home. Spiderman even got to talk to Mr. Fantastic and met some of the Young Avengers since Nova said not everyone was present for a while; due to Richard Rider was away on a school field trip at the moment and wouldn’t be back for another week. The Daredevil and The Punisher’s son was away for a school camp.
Hawkeye raised an eyebrow at him underneath his shade before saying. “Well sorry pal, but you kind of a distraction that cannot be ignored.” He said. “How the heck am ‘I a distraction to you?! I only want to save and help people.” Spiderman confessed. It amused Hawkeye.
“--the meantime, you’ll get some rest. The rest of the Avengers will understand. Your father and I are thinking of putting you in a group. It’s for your own safely. Call us unfair and all, fine. But I want you to understand that your dad and I are doing this because we care and love you, Peter.” Steve said.
The rest of the Avengers screamed inside their head while listening to the two. They were still trying to figure out if Spiderman was Peter Parker himself or not since Tony and Steve feared that Peter, their son, might be Spiderman and if he did, they wanted to figure out a way how to deal with the news.
In the kitchen, Steve was spoiling him with all the food he had cooked, making Peter eat everything, slowly but he must finish it all because he was too skinny and fragile-looking and Steve said even wind could blow him away.
After the episode with the Lizard three months ago, everything went back to normal. Well mostly normal except for Peter who was still busy committing his fighting crimes of catching burglars, thieves, kidnappers, and so on. The usual cliché things.  Peter still continued going to school by day, Spiderman and crime fighting by night.
Bruce kept a serious face at Clint’s name. Natasha threw the man a mischievous grin. Clint felt like he wanted to throttle the shit out of Tony.
Both Steve and Tony glanced at each other. “As long as you’re happy going to that school, I don’t see why not.” Steve said. Peter flashed them a smile. “Thank you.” He said before continued to eat his dinner. Steve and Tony watched their son eat his meal with content. They couldn’t help but to be happy that Peter was at ease with them. Tony and Steve held their husband’s hand under the table.
Sorry about the late update. WookieCookie was sick for the past few days with the fever, so I have to give her a few break and bed rest for being my beta still she's get better, but I did send her the finishing chapter nine and told her to edited it when she got better and off of the fever.
Dr. Strange and James Rhodes and Johnny were on the other side of the computer, watching some of the old tapes. They had been doing that the moment they got back to the tower. The first thing they did was checking and examining each video tape to see if they could find evidence from there. James saw something out-of-place in the tape as he and Dr. Strange played it on.
“Hey, I think I found a few left serums in the freezer, and some blood sample. They still looked fresh. I’m guessing that the couple probably forgot to shut this thing off when they went away.” Steve informed his husband.
“So you think that it was still a good idea going upstairs butt naked? What if someone saw you?!” Steve complained, stomping his foot on the floor.
“I know that but still, it’s not right to just accuse her like that! We don’t even know if she’s involved in this.” Steve replied. Before the two could continue, Clint intruded in the middle.
Now, he was totally freaked and scarred for life. Peter swore he would never get the image of Tony being his mother out of his head for a long time.
“Well, the kid was doing fine. They didn’t do anything suspicious or any risky stuff. They went to the mall, met up at Starbucks, bought drinks from there, had lunch at Hungry Jack, shopping, arcade games. After that they watched a movie. When the movie ended, they headed back home as Peter’s friend dropped him of at his house before they left.  Peter went upstairs to his room and well, study…that’s about it.” Clint said.
He was the only one left who stayed behind in the Tower while the rest of the Avengers were gone. Well except for Iron Man, Captain America, Bruce Banner, Black Window, Hawkeye, Captain Britain, Ant-Man, Mr. Fantastic and his wife, The Punisher and Daredevil were the only ones left aside.
“Ah, okay. I can do that.” Clint said. He saw Spiderman take off. “Well got to go. See you another day, Frank!” Clint said before he jumped off. Frank watched him go and chased Spiderman from behind.
“Y-You’re right.” Steve said. Tony looked away as he huffed, affronted. Clint nodded. “Okay, now why don’t we all go back to Peter, alright?”
He had witnessed the death of his aunt a few weeks ago, followed by the crucial news (presented on papers) of his real identity from his adopted mother and deceased aunt. He was a stolen child, taken away from his biological parents by the man he had thought to be his real father all this time. In his whole life, he was lied to by the people he came to care as his own family.
“We asked some of the couple neighborhood there and found that some of them did catch Mr. Parker coming home with an ambulance vehicle that he had parked and hid it in their backyard garage; with him was what looked like an incubator for infant. I’m guessing that it probably was the one we saw on the video footage James showed us a while ago. The day next the neighborhood had told us that the couple had a son just out of the blue which made them suspicious about it.”
When they went inside, May was lying down on the hospital bed, fast asleep. She looked worse, much worse than the last time Peter had saw her. An IV attached to her left arm, and an oxygen mask strapped to her mouth. Peter marched towards her, grabbed her hand in his and squeezed it gently; a worried expression marred his face.
Peter woke up early in the morning around eight am as he went and had a breakfast with his adoptive…err…biological parents. Weird
After the call, Tony met his brothers in arms, err, battles, whatever, to update them of everything.
I wanted to re-read the Avengers Civil war issue #4, but my brother's bedroom is always locked whenever he left! :V So I can't re-read it, I was planning to maybe made a Superfamily Civil war version of my own, story, but since I can't read that comic that my brother had since he hide it his room that is always locked whenever he leave.
he groaned as he put away his weapon and went on and began to attack Spiderman head on. ‘If my arrow won’t work then maybe getting close combat might work in placing the tracker on him.’ He thought.
I'm thankful for everyone who enjoy this story. But I'm going to abandoned this story due to my busy work and will be deleting this story and my other work as well. Since I don't have time to write fanfiction anymore. And for a good reason. Other reviewer and reader keeps saying that this story was a rip off or a copy of someone work and my other work too. When in truth I haven't read any of those stories or work. Everyone keeps saying they read those story from neither in ff.net or wattpad or here. I don't even reads story that are posted on ff.net or wattpad. Well not anymore. Expect here. But I would never copy them! >:/
Steve listened and thought of it. “Y-You’re right. What more important is that Peter is okay and alive…” He reassured his frantic beating chest. “Richard Parker wouldn’t be around anymore to harm Peter.” Bruce added. “Yes, Richard isn’t alive anymore to continue his sick experiment on Peter. I don’t know what I would do if that happen. If he was alive and here, trying to take Peter away from us again.” Tony seethed.
Tony went on but Steve cut his rambling off. “I know that, but maybe they or she might have changed her mind and adopted a baby boy that looked so much a lot like—“Steve twitched when Tony interrupted his string of words. It looked like it was habit now, not letting the other to finish their sentence.
Spiderman eyed Hawkeye warily before asking. “Dude, you’re not one of those cops that after my head aren’t you?” He questioned in start. “What? No! I don’t work with those people. Not that they don’t do their best, but they just kind of suck at it.” Hawkeye babbled before he shook his head and said. “Hey! You’re trying to distract me!” He accused. This made Spiderman raise an eyebrow underneath his guise. ‘
‘How is he doing?’ Steve’s head shot up making him wince when his neck protested the movement; Natasha was standing in the doorway with a soft look on her face while the rest of the team lingered behind her.
But as the night had gone on and Tony had drunk more beer than his bladder could handle, Steve was going to have let him out of the booth. Patting him on the thigh he bumped their hips in a shuffle. ‘Time to use the little boy’s room.’ He slipped a thigh over Steve’s and wiggled across the wide expanse of jeans and solid muscle grinding his ass a little over Steve’s groin as he moved just to enjoy that furious blush again.
‘It was because of our relationship.’ Was all Steve could offer her, throat tight and constricted around the words. Natasha’s eyes went flinty and hard as she looked around Steve at the unconscious men and he could only imagine what was flashing through her mind right now.
While they were coming out of a diner after dinner one night, a small group of reporters were waiting for them. Steve didn’t know how they always found them, but lately they were barely able to leave the safety of the tower without being followed and hounded by them. Tightening his arm around Tony’s waist, mindful of the sling and still healing ribs he tried to hurry them along but a determined, mousy woman got a microphone in their faces. ‘Mr Stark what will you do if the legislation for same sex marriage goes through, you’ve been putting in a lot of work and money to support the movement.’
‘As soon as you’re well enough we are working on your self-defence Stark, no more skimping on lessons for mad science binges.’ Natasha sat on the end of the bed again and closed a fine boned hand around his ankle through the blanket. ‘Don’t do that to us again Anthoshka.’
Tony had started off on the outside of the booth but after a few derogatory comments had been thrown his way on the sly as a rowdy group of drunks had moved past them, Steve had clenched his jaw and pulled Tony over his lap bodily, and closed him off from any direct insults. Tony had whispered something filthy in response to Steve, relishing the blush that had dusted across his cheeks and spent the rest of the night so far teasing his boyfriend for his protectiveness.
‘We are all in this together Steve; you know we’ll follow you.’ Natasha winked at him, sliding off the bed to come and peck his cheek softly, turning to do the same to Tony and smooth a wayward curl away from his forehead. ‘We’ll follow him too, even if he is reckless.’
‘Well I am a thing of beauty.’ Tony teased back, squeezing his hand weakly. Steve knew he was going to be okay, that they were okay as they traded easy banter until the nurse came in and topped up the pain medication and took his vitals. Steve just sat there and took in his fill of Tony lazily, just appreciating the moment and seeing those lively amber eyes again and hearing Tony’s voice even a little rough with pain and sleep.
A week after the work began on that, Steve was approached by a group within the military to be the face of their movement for fair rights during service, it was fulfilling and he loved every moment of it. Even if the media were doing their best to tear Tony down in the weeks that followed the assault, some groups even going so far as to proclaim he deserved it while other groups called for Steve to be dishonourably discharged from the army.
It wasn’t until Clint was obnoxiously shoving a coffee in his face that he realised he must have dozed off sitting there; Tony was watching him with one heavily lidded eye and a soft smile. ‘You guys can head off if you want, get some proper sleep. Don’t think I’m going anywhere any time soon.’ Steve could see him eyeing off the coffee in his hand.
Just as he was using the smallest amount of palm to flush the door opened behind him again, letting in a rush of noise before thudding closed again. Hurriedly zipping up his jeans Tony ignored the murmurs behind him and moved to the sink, grabbing a handful of paper towels before turning on the tap, glancing at the men milling around the door in the grimy mirror. Shifting a little Tony rinsed his hands and reached out for more paper towel, turning his body away from the men as he looked away from the mirror.
All his words achieved were a shared look of disgust before they moved. Tony managed to step out of the way of the first punch and spare a wince for the pain that ran up his forearm block the next, but made the mistake of taking his eyes of the third person and doubled over when a meaty fist connected with his side knocking the breath from his body before his head was snapping back from a wild punch. Sprawling back against the single basin Tony winced and struggled to stay on his feet as the men moved as one, throwing out punches and kicks that Tony did his best to block.
While Tony had been in surgery having his shoulder reduced and repaired, Steve had turned his attention to the television where the media were already speculating about what had happened. Steve had been right that people had taken footage; the news station had played the same grainy footage of Tony being wheeled out of the bathroom by paramedics over and over again. There was video footage of the three men being walked in handcuffs towards police cars in there as well, but the media seemed disinterested in them over why they did it.
When he turned away from the basin Tony tightened his shoulders and stood a little straighter, the three men were standing behind him in a loose half circle the biggest of the three directly in front of the door and cutting off his exit. Their fists were clenched loosely at their sides’ faces sneering as they stepped in a little closer.  ‘Look guys, I am sure there is a good reason you want to do this but you need to take a moment and consider exactly who I am and who else is sitting just outside those doors.’ Tony raised his hands to chest level, keeping them open and offering a placating smile as he opened up his stance a little.
Their investigation was cut off when JARVIS informed Tony that Peter was on his way to the penthouse. It confused Tony why Peter wanted to come to the tower at this kind of hour. It was already night. Shouldn’t a kid like Peter be at home like a good teenager, eat their dinner and do their homework or go to bed early or something? Tony’s eyes narrowed. No child of his would act like a delinquent-
Peter stared at the neatly folded letter on his table his late Aunty May had submitted to him before she died. Two journals belonged to his late parents were beside it. He stared at it for a while. Almost fearful, dreading of what he would find out. He already knew he was adopted by the Parker’ family. What could be worse than that?
“Didn’t Coulson say someone encountered Spiderman and helped him find an antidote was a student from here? I remember I read it on the files.” Natasha said. “It’s better if we double check then so we can ask that person as well if he or she knows Spiderman.” Steve said which Natasha agreed.
During dinner, Peter thought of something as he said. “Would it be okay if I still keep my surname as ‘Parker’?” He said as he saw both his real father and step-dad had a frown on their face.
Everything was now a mess. The plan they were working went smoothly a few months ago up until Richard mentioned about the Parker’s couple life history. He had hoped that Tony was right, that this Peter might be their long lost son they’d been looking for years, because if it wasn’t? Then there would be hell to pay. He didn’t want to see his Tony break down again like before. He hated it when Tony was a mess. He wanted his Tony, the Tony he loved. Who was always with smiles and jokes around like before, who secretly was a loving person whenever they were alone. He wanted that Tony to come back to him, and he could only hope, that maybe, just maybe, bringing back their lost son would return everything to the way it used to be. Steve could only hope and pray for it.
“Agent Phil? The dude who works for Nick Fury?” Peter asked with a squeak. “Yes. Oh, so you have met him?” it was of a statement than a question. Peter nodded anyway.
When he was finished, the boy was wearing a branded greyish pants, a printed t-shirt with a black hoodie jacket, a black-white paired sneakers, and a new patented watch.
“Cool!” Peter said as he tried shooting Dummy with his new web shooter. The robot wheezed. Tony just shook his head.
“We’ll go there tomorrow early in the morning, okay buddy? Now, did you have dinner already or-?” Tony asked as Peter shook his head no. “No. I went here immediately the moment I received the phone call…”
“Come on you two! Do it later later when we’re done with this thing!” he said, begging them to just listen. To his relief, they did.
“U-Umm…should I have to reveal my secret identity to the rest of the Avengers or not?” He asked, already fearing of showing himself to the rest of the Avengers. Especially towards his biological dad who was working for SHIELD. Nick raised him a brow before saying.
Tony raised a brow as he examined each and every thing his hands could touch in the basement. Steve went on to the freezer and to his surprise; it was still working and inside it was a neatly kept serum the couple had worked on.
Tony smiled through their kisses before pulling away from it and said in a soft caring voice. “Well I’m glad it’s settled then. Now go out there and give me that information I want, love.” Tony said as he kissed Steve one last time before shoo-ing his husband out of the car, a sweet smile adorned Tony’s face. Bruce and Richard looked behind them when Steve stepped out of the car, they looked at him amusingly, since Steve was looking all, happy and well, better, like a new person, or a person who just got the best Christmas gift in December.
Five months later, Peter still continued being Tony’s intern. Tony found himself wondering why someone like Peter was underrated by his school and fellow teachers. The boy was naturally born genius. Still, he could understand the boy, at least. He would prefer his child experiencing the life of being a normal teenager, despite how smart he was rather to force him to go to a boarding school.
“Huh?” Peter made a confuse look. “Congratulation Peter, looks like you just passed the test.” He said. Peter’s eye widened in disbelief. “Really?! Does this mean I’m in? Does that mean I get the internship?” Peter felt like smacking himself. Okay, it was obvious he got it. No need to repeat stupid questions. Bruce chuckled at it. “So…when do I start?” He asked.
Peter read the letter with a trembling hold, letting the tears well down to his cheeks. He wiped them with the palm of his hand. He carefully placed the letter back on the table. When he was done crying, he picked the red journal belonged to his mother. He flipped it open as a letter fell from it. He picked up the note and read it, carefully.
Richard Reed couldn’t believe what his former college partner had done. The horror of finding out one of your college friends had been fallen into madness was just too much, like what happened with Victor Von Doom. However, what Richard Parker did was beyond humanity. It was just wrong in many ways to use an infant as a test subject. A living one at that. He wondered what had driven the man to become so twisted.
“You see, the serum is called as Therapeutic Serum. It’s s a serum with the enhance ability to heal major type of disease, most of all Cancer and Leukemia. However, the serum has also been tested on animals and we’re proud to announce the serum has worked marvelously. Yet we wanted to tried it on a human being--” Mr. Parker said but only to be cut off as Tony hollered.
Steve, Bruce and Richard manage to get inside without problems. A woman who went by the name Juniper Magneta (it funny in a weird way) had led them towards the Parker couple’s office and the moment the woman left the room, the three began to search and look for substantiations they could find.
Tony took a deep breath. “I…you see, Steve and I decided to make you your very own room. I think it’s time for me and Steve to move on. Our son will still be in our heart. W-We want you to have this room as your own, Peter.” He said.
“So what do you want from me? The last time I encountered one of you, he tried to shoot me with his arrow.” Peter accused. Nick raised a brow.
Hank McCoy took that as his chance to speak up, “Is that so? What this kid has anything to do with Spiderman? Judging from Captain America’s description, Peter seems to be a well-behaved kid and outstandingly smart for his age, but it won’t be enough to denunciate him of being Spiderman. You’ll need more than empty words.”
“Good. And one more thing…let me know if you find anything interesting about Spiderman and his location. Keep me up to date and send the information your group finds about Spiderman through Coulson.” the eye-patched man inhaled, “That’s all for today. I’ll let you and the rest of the Avengers handle this. Do whatever you can or have to do.  Just get me Spiderman” Nick Fury ordered which made Tony roll his eyes at him but nod his head. “We’ll do what we can, sir.” Steve said before Nick shoo-ed them out of the room.
“How’s it going with babysitting Spiderman, Hawkeye?” A voice called out from behind him. Clint squinted around to see the Punisher. He grinned and waved. “Doing great!”
Children inclined to be curious about everything, and they weren’t that hard to explain in a pleasant and nice way without traumatizing them. However dealing with a teenager who was curious enough for their own good would get themselves into a deeper trouble and danger especially a childlike Peter, who often poked his nose to where it didn’t belong.
“Sure Cap.” Hank said. Brain just waved a hand at him. He smiled at them before following his husband somewhere else.
back. I want those night kisses. I missed you cap. I know that we’re living together; sleeping together in the same bed but everything is so different. You’re so being distant. I was worried that you were going to leave me or something so I never said a thing and I know you told me that no more secrets now that we are married but I--“Tony said talking in a worried voice.
He thought. “So…how’s your weekend, Pete?” Steve asked as Peter glanced up his step-dad and blinked his eyes before saying. “It was doing okay. You?” He asked. “Busy.” Steve simply said.
Sliver surfer wasn’t present as well since he was still busy somewhere else. He was okay with. Saying he’d meet them at some other time when they were present.
Someone wanted to bother him when he wasn’t in the mood to deal with anything at the moment. Slowly, shadow of man merged from within the shadow.
“Don’t destroy them too much. Iron Man still needs some of it for examination and sees to whom it belongs to.” Hawkeye said. Peter nodded, jumping down.
“Hey, it’s okay. So your Aunty May is out of town for a while huh?” He asked to which Peter nodded his head. “Yeah. Something about going to a flower camp, old people stuff, with her fellow friends for a couple of days. Thought I don’t mind. I mean Aunty May has the right to go through that camp after uncle Ben’s…you know, died—” Peter said but was cut off as someone said. “Ben, May? Ben and May Parker as in Richard Parker’s sister-in-law?” Reed asked, surprised. It was just a bet because there was tons of couple out there with the wife’s name as May and husband as Ben but-…Peter turned and nodded his head towards Richard. “Y-Yeah… You knew my dad?” He asked. Richard nodded his head.
PS: Good news, my brother went off to a 1 week vacation and left his laptop for me to borrow and use it for my story, so it look like I might be able to update each chapter sooner then later, I mostly get a chapter done within two days, depend on if I have free time from school or so. So I hope that everyone is very overjoy by this great new. :)
Peter was more surprised. This was his first time watching how the Avengers acted around each other. Everyone was being…themselves, with the way Natasha was strangling Clint for accidentally spitting his coffee on her face (After Logan mentioned Captain and Iron Man kissing) and the way Bruce just laughed warmly. His mentor and uncle figure tried to stop Natasha. Nova just there, laughing without a care for the world.
He glanced at the now closed nursery room and couldn’t help but feel happy about it. Happy knowing his dad, his biological dad still wanted to have him back. And technically he did return to his parents like they had hoped.
And I want to say alot of thank you for WookieCookie again for beta-ing and edited this story for me. :3
“PETER BENJAMIN ROGERS-STARK! GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF THE ROOFTOP! WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU EVEN DOING THERE BUTT NAKED FOR?!” Steve yelled through their communicator in the house. He could hear Peter squeak and yelp.
“I…I’ll think about it. Give me a few days—”Peter said but was cut off by the director. “No. I don’t have time to be idling around, Peter. You’re a threat to us and we’re just trying to make sure you’re one of us. Pick your choice kid. I don’t have much time to deal with this.”
Tony hadn’t realized that someone was at the door until the person voice snapped him out of his thought. “Tony?” It was Steve. Tony blinked his tearful eyes, he wiped them before turned his head to face his husband. “Hey Cap! Do you need anything?” He asked. Steve just gave Tony a sad smile before saying. “Actually… Nick called for a meeting at SHIELD’s headquarters and is expecting us to move there right away.” Steve informed.
Peter. You cannot go against it. You ear or I’ll make you eat.” Steve berated. “Eh? But—”Peter protested. Steve sent the kid a light but serious glare. It shut the boy up. “No buts. No nothing.” Steve said. “…fine.” Peter gave up.
“You see, dear. Your mother Mary couldn’t conceive. She was barren and thought they wanted to adopt before but they couldn’t due to their work. A month later, your parents came to our house with an infant in their arms. That was you, Peter. They had changed their mind and wanted to adopt in the end despite their tight lifestyles.” Mary explained weakly and knew she couldn’t stay any longer.
Few days later, Peter’s morning was interrupted by a call from Bruce, telling him today was the day where he’d meet Tony Stark and that he should be at Stark tower in an hour. Peter wasted no time, getting ready, taking the train instead of cab – because the road looked crowded with cars today and he didn’t want to be stuck in the traffic – and arriving at Stark tower just in time. He saw Bruce waiting for him at the entrance. “Glad you made it. Why don’t we get inside? We’ll start with what you want to take first.” He said.
Steve looked confused at that. “Why not?” He asked. “I… I was scared. I was scared that you wouldn’t….believe me…” He said in a small voice.
PS: Guys, I would also like for you guys to pick to who you guys want Peter to ended up with our paired up with?
He glanced at his husband who was ready to make a scene right now. Tony was far from pissed. He wanted to murder Nick Fury right now. Steve sighed, easing to calm his husband down by turning Tony to face him.
“Ah, yes of course, do come in.” The lady said as she let them inside her house and served drinks to her guests.
Peter blinked. “Why? What’s wrong with my suit?” He asked. Tony frowned at the boy and said. “Seriously, Pete, going out crime fighting wearing Spandex? Spandex, I might add? Spandex. Seriously, it’s not safe! The Green Goblin hurt you easily. Nope. You are never ever going out fighting villains in Spandex - your pops is a special case -…I’m making you a new one that won’t get ripped off easily by anything.” Tony stated.
he said to himself, and then found three more of the same type spiders before putting it in a small cylinder glass tube. Bruce picked the three separated objects, carefully inserting it into his bag, making sure the glass like jar wouldn’t get broken. “So everything’s settled?” Steve asked the two who glanced up at him and nodded as they went out of the office.
His only wish was so Tony and Steve wouldn’t find out the real identity of Spiderman. He also planned to tell them he was their blood-son but still couldn’t find the right time.
It around five thirty pm when group four came back to the tower and Clint filled Steve up about what Peter Parker had been up to lately.
Tony didn’t give any reaction to the news. He was more vexed and uneasy seeing his son like this, broken and desperate and gods, if only Peter knew Tony would do anything, everything – he would even tear the world apart for his son – to wash away that awful expression from Peter’s face.
Soon they found information about the Parker couple, but not without Tony’s help, Tony had hacked the security camera for a reason so Steve and the others wouldn’t get caught snooping and scavenging around.
“No way. Isn’t that an incubator transport for infant?” Johnny Storm said which made Tony freeze on his spot. Steve noticed this as he immediately went toward Tony and tried to calm him down before he spurt another outburst.
“I—“The doctor was about to say something when Tony quickly jumped in. “Would it be all right, if you can tell us, my husband and I about Mrs Parker’s wellbeing? Peter could just stay here with his aunt to keep an eye for her while we, the adults, talk this somewhere else. How that does sound to you?” He said in his business tone though alarm latched somewhere in between.
Peter sighed and excused himself, telling the remaining Avengers members he wanted to go out or maybe headed home, but the Tower was his home where his father (Tony Stark and his step-dad were living) so he came up with a lie and told them as he left the tower, still in his Spiderman suit when he deiced to just take a stroll on the city for the meantime.
“Well, who else? It’s none other than the great Tony Stark!” Peter said. Peter could hear something falling out of their bed or something on the other side of the phone as he blinked his eyes in confusion. “Harry?” he asked.
, they missed their son. The little boy they had dreamed of to have ever since they knew it was impossible for them to have a child from their own fresh and blood since they were both male. Then this tiny miracle happened. They were exultant for it, given the bless to create their own child, a family they had so desperately wanted, only for the chance to be ripped away from them the moment the child was born.
“Let’s just check what you guys found okay?” Henry Pym said as he began to rampage through their stuff.
What surprised him was the one on the center between the Beast and Ant-man. In the seat was none other than Bruce Banner, his mentor. Well one of his mentors, which surprised him.
He sighed as he got out of his and his wife’s bed. Susan was still fast asleep. A smile on his face when he caressed his wife’s face, getting up and deciding to have a morning coffee. He walked out of their bedroom silently and closed the door softly. He slowly walked down the hallway only to pause in his spot when he passed by his teenage son’s bedroom.
They may not have a stable relationship like the Starks or Erik and Charles, but they were trying their damn best to stay and keep their relationship strong as they could. They weren’t even married to begin with but it didn’t matter. They loved each other and that was a proof enough. He entered the living room; a boy slumped down on the couch, remote in his hand as he coughed once, his back facing him. A smile graced Frank lips as he watched the boy, watched his and Mathew’s son.
“About that, we are gathering here today for a new mission.” he said as everyone began to listen carefully. “Our new mission will be to initiate plan C. We are going to try and investigate Mr. and Mrs. Parker. I’m going to have to divide everyone into—“ Tony said but was cut off when Clint butted in and asked.
The next few days, Tony was sent home and was allowed to leave the hospital. However their little one (Peter) had to remain in the hospital for further observations. Both fathers soon made the visiting-Peter as their daily active activity. Tony even got to hold his son, but only for a little while before the nurse needed to put Peter back in his incubator, which Tony harshly called it his Cage.
After dinner, Steve showed Peter his room for the night. The guestroom was right next to Steve and Tony’s bedroom.
“Probably somewhere in Switzerland, lost, hurt, lonely and totally broke while weeping near a dumpster.” Pepper rolled her eyes. “Pep, you just stab my poor heart with your lack of faith in me.” Tony pouted. “Whatever Tony. You have a good day tomorrow and may things go smoothly with Peter’s adopted aunty.” Pepper said before she hung up.
Soon Peter found him being err- interrogate by Mr. Stark, repeating the same questions just like Bruce did yesterday. The need to know about his family was rather disturbing. He didn’t see the connection between that and the requirement for internship. Steve sent a soft, sad look at the boy whenever Peter mentioned the absence and death of his parents in his life, the incident happened to his uncle Ben and how he was living with his aunt May. Just the two of them. No one else.
Tony sighed in disappointment at that before saying.  'So, what else did you and Bruce find?” He asked, “We’ve found something interesting about their spider experiment. Apparently the spider is not just any ordinary spider, is actually a radioactive Spider.” Richard said. Bruce was giving him the ‘No shit, Sherlock’ looks. “Thought we’re not sure what it can cause to a bitten person since the couple hadn’t tried it on anyone to test it: if being bitten by this radioactive spider could gain a person any mutant ability or if it a threat.” Richard tilted his head.
Steve finally came back home after a fight with the Green Goblin along with his teammates, minus Tony and Peter. He took off his mask and shield and placed it on the end table. He looked around for a sign of his family, but found none. He sighed. “Jarvis, where are Tony and Peter?” He asked.
But Peter will eventually going to up with neither Harry, Wade in the end, since only one had voted for two voted for flash as a Venom, (the second one who voted as Flash as a venom was me, lol, but I don't count.)  Or does everyone want me to make this a foursome pairing? I wouldn't mind.
. Although Tony didn’t want to do anything for the Parkers – let them be damned-, he had to do this one. For Peter’s sake.
Still he continued to thrash and thrash until he heard a loud beeping and then-…Peter’s eyes flashed at the sight of his blaring alarm clock.
It surprised Peter to know some of the Avengers were parents themselves but still had time to be a superhero.
Tony crossed his arms before continued on. “Before we go on our meeting, I would like to apologize to everyone about yesterday for my outburst. I’m not crazy or anything, if you guys were thinking that. But seriously who wouldn’t react like that and go on rampage when you found out that—“ Tony was about to initiate his rants and talk nonsense when Steve groaned loudly. Tony took that as his cue to shut up and just go straight to the point.
“Is that all? I may take my leave now. I still have things to do. I leave Spiderman in your care, Cap, Stark.” He said before leaving. Coulson followed him out of the small meeting room.
He called Tony and the others in which did and couldn’t help but to have a horrified look on their faces at the sight of it.
he thought and felt a little betrayed by it. Then he was more surprised as well when he saw Black Window.
He glanced and glared at the journal belonged solely to Richard. It wouldn’t do him any good to dwell with this anger and the past. Perhaps he should take a walk for a while.
“Okay, I leave you to yourself for the night Peter. Here’s your new sleeping wear for the time being. Oh and one more thing, don’t go down to the main lab. It’s off limit. Well then, that’s about it. Have a good night sleep and…sweet dream, Peter.”
Tony pouted at him before saying. “But you are honey; you look dashing hot with jet black hair. I know that our relationship for the past fourteen years is not as steady as they used too, but I would really, really love to see you in that hair in our bed half naked while I stare at you the whole day as I—“ Tony said but was cut off as Bruce said,
Logan grumbled. He got no time for this shit. He needed a drink and a smoke. Not doing a petty investigation. “All right. Now, let’s get back to work people.” Tony clapped his hands once.
When Peter woke up, he found himself in a white room. He had a guess it was probably the private infirmary in Stark Tower. He groaned, moving his hands to touch his face, panicking when he realized his mask wasn’t on. He sat up, looking for his Spiderman mask only to find it wasn’t anywhere in the room.
But before Steve left - “Uh, Hank, Brain can you two take my place for a while and continue on with the meeting. Iron Man and I will go and need to talk to Nick Fury with something.” Steve politely directed.
“It’s fine. I don’t actually have parents anymore. Well I used to have them but they died in a plan crash when I was seven. My Uncle Ben just died about three months ago in an incident.  The only family member I have left is my Aunt May. I’m the only child…” Peter scratched the back of his head. (Poor kid) Bruce heard Steve say through the intercom. “Forgive me for asking such matter then.” Bruce actually meant it. Peter shrugged before saying.
Mathew was pregnant with their son, something that had to do with the radioactive isotope. It made Mathew able to bear a child; the news was a shocking to both of them, but secretly overjoyed by it.  Their son was two years older than Steve and Tony’s son.
“Very well.” Natasha said. “Is that all? Because I really should be getting back to my classes.” She said. Natasha nodded. “Yes, that’s all you can go now.”
He had a great time getting to meet the rest of the Avengers, even made friend with the Human Torch, who revealed to him as Johnny Storm, the young brother-in-law of Reed Richard (which surprised Peter because he had met Reed Richard a few weeks ago in his dad’s reunion party).
“Ah! Yes…this is…” Bruce hesitated, not wanting to say ‘Peter’. He didn’t want to bring up old memory of what they had lost. “This is P-Peter Parker, Steven. He’ll be working with Tony soon enough once we get his approval.” Bruce said eyeing both Tony and Steve nervously. Tony put up his bravado despite the hidden longing in his eyes. “A-Ah-I see. Hello P-Peter. I’m Steven Grant Rogers-Stark by the way-” Steve stumbled but was cut off by Tony. “My husband.” He finished. “So here he is, the boy who has stolen the entire spotlight since days ago.” He quipped.
“So I take it you’re going to take science course when you get to collage?” Bruce queried. “Yes.  I’m still thinking whether I’ll be taking Genetic or Biochemistry or Mechanist or Physics course or-” Peter blushed when he realized he was rambling.
“What makes you think I want to join your group or the Avengers? I mean, I work alone. Not that it wouldn’t be nice working with Iron Man or Captain America but still I-”Peter was cut off by Nick. “Really? I have every right to force you to join the group, Peter Parker.” Nick Fury. The boy was paralyzed on his spot. “W-W-What?” Peter said, sounding panic all of a sudden.
Gwen eyed Natasha suspiciously before saying. “Okay.” She said. “Good. I shall let you talk in another private room. Miss Stacy I’m sure you can show Miss Romanoff to where it is?” He questioned. Gwen bobbed, leading Natasha out of the office as the two went to another room. “So Miss Romanoff, what would you like to ask me about?” She asked. “Well I’m here to ask you a question regarding the Lizard. We notice that you seem to know Spiderman and we would like to know if you have anything do with it or if you somehow know him or work alongside with him?” She asked.
After placing the chart back at the end of the bed, Bruce moved over to the window and perched on the ledge while fiddling with his glasses. They shared a companionable silence after that, using the calm beeping of the heart monitor and Tony’s soft breaths with a small wheeze comfort them. Bruce was the first one to break the silence after that, volunteering Clint to help him seek out coffee and snacks while they waited.
All of these injuries because Tony loved another man, loved Steve. It made him feel sick to his stomach and the nausea roiled around like a greasy slick against the back of his throat. Steve liked to believe he was for the people, did what he did to keep them safe and protected. But it had been those same people who had done this to Tony; he’d made the mistake of forgetting that villains were still human and didn’t always wear costumes or attempt world domination.
‘Come on Cap you need to let them work.’ Clint was pulling him away from Tony and Steve instinctively moved to pull away before a paramedic cradled Tony’s head and took over his position. Steve stood back and watched them work with a numb disconnect until he was able to pull himself back together again.
Or it could have just been the impressive way Thor was putting away all the beer and his loud boastful stories about Asgard, either way there were a lot of eyes on them at any given time as people came and went. People had been coming up to them on and off to ask for photos and signatures, which is how Tony had found himself the meat in a super soldier and Asgardian God sandwich.
‘I think somethings wrong.’ Steve pushed out of the booth and turned towards the bathrooms, he knew he was probably overreacting but something wasn’t sitting right in his stomach and he was used to following his instincts. Looking back at Clint he bit his lip for a moment before making up his mind and moving away, a second later Clint was close behind him.
It had been a relief when the nurse had come and got him, taking him to Tony and leaving them alone. Steve had spent the last hour since coming in to the private room going between squeezing Tony’s cold hand to pacing up and down the small space and staying out of the nurses way as they came and went.
Steve and Tony, happily married, were excited when they learned that Tony was pregnant with their first child, (something to do with Erskine’s Serum side effect). It made both lovers stun into silence when they found out that months from now, they’d have their first ever child in their arms.
Bruce and Clint squared each of the room, finding a child’s room along the way. The room looked neat even though this house was abandoned. He went inside the room as he examined it. The room had a teddy bed near the window; the bed had a poster of buzz Light-year. Next to the bed stood a door that Bruce could guess was the bathroom. An airplane toy hanging on the roof, a small cabin with lot of toys, the floor was left with scattered toys, drawing books with crayon shattered around it. Bruce could imagine little Peter Parker playing with his toys here when he was little.
He was the son of the great Tony Stark, who had accepted him as one of his students and even treated him as if he was his son (Did Stark know the truth?). He wondered if Tony had longed to see his son again or if ever he had mourned and moved on. Did he even miss his son?
Steve on his part couldn’t help but to examine Peter. He noticed the boy had brown hair and his eyes; they looked familiar to him. Sure there were plenty of kids out there with brown eyes and hair but Peter’s shade of auburn was different. It looked exactly like Tony’s. It bothered Steve to no end.
The two raised the child in secret, only the fellow Avengers knew about the boy, and the boy had taken Mathew’s last name for safely reason. After all, Frank wouldn’t want to know what would happen if their son had shared his last name. He had enemies who would shamelessly use what he held most dear just to rile him.
They watched the doctor do his job, noticing the doctor’s expression turn to concern then to worry, and finally disheartened. Whatever he’d found wasn’t probably a good thing. The doctor looked around hesitantly.
The next morning, the Rogers-Stark couple woke up around six am, feeling the hangover rushed in with a pounding headache. Bruce was already up early as he was now standing on the entrance of Steve and Tony’s shared room, looking at them with a strange expression. “Morning, you two.” He greeted. Tony blinked his eyes slowly before glancing up at Bruce. “Hnn…Bruce? W-Why are you here? Did we have some kind of a wild party and I seem to forget it or something?” He asked while trying to get his head straight. Hangover was one thing Tony hated after paparazzi.
After school he went to the warehouse where he often hung out at, practicing his moves and skills before heading home. The moment he arrived home, he received a call, informing him his aunt was involved in an incident and was now at the nearest hospital at the place where she stayed for the trip she joined.
This surprised Tony and Steve as Clint told them that it was better to go to the old house of the Parker couple since the guy they asked told them that they might find plenty of things there.
our Peter is Spiderman then we will deal with it like the adults we are. We’re his parents. I’m sure he has reasons of his own why he wants to be a superhero. But right now I want you, me and the rest of the Avengers to keep an eye on Spiderman for a while. He’s with us now. We have enough time to spend and get to know him and if he trusts us enough, I’m sure by then he will reveal himself.” He said.
. It seemed like the kid knew that he was being trailed close and had tricked him into following him around.
The moment he got home, Peter ran up to his room, ignoring Aunt’s May protest of no running in the house. He sat on the chair and turned on the computer, fingers tapping on the keyboard, searching for any results of Tony Stark offering an internship or anything closer to that. Peter’s eyes puckered into confusion when the results came out empty.
Most of the damage had been confined to his ribcage and shoulder, they were going to be the injuries that would bother Tony the most when he was awake and well enough to move around again. Six ribs had been broken mainly focused around the reactor casing internally, his shoulder had been badly dislocated and torn the rotator cuff and was going to require rehabilitation and physical therapy.
‘Iron Man is going to be the butt of all jokes, got his ass handed to him by a couple of drunk homophobes in a public restroom.’ Opening his eye he looked over at Steve glumly. ‘Is this already all over the news?’ He winced when Steve nodded.
‘This is a different type of enemy Thor.’ Steve shifted in his seat, keeping his voice hushed. ‘It’s still a battle, one that probably won’t be won for many years but there are still bad people out there that we,
The doctors had stressed how lucky Tony had been that none of the glass had ended up in his eye, and that he had avoided any skull fractures outside of a broken nose that had been reset and a concussion. Steve couldn’t help but think of the smears of blood on the broken mirror and how much there had been on Tony’s face.
It was no secret that Tony relied heavily on the armour but he worked on his physical fitness and strength outside of the suit, sparring with the others in case of situations just like this one. But he was going on his thirty-sixth hour without sleep and ten beers on a mostly empty stomach, so when a lucky shot connected with the side of his face and lights exploded in his vision he went down with a vague moment of horror about the sticky floor.
Thanks to the enhancements of the serum, Steve heard it before he saw it as they moved through the crowd towards the restrooms at the back of the pub. Even with the background sounds of the televisions and low heady thrum of the music and voices, Steve would know the sound of Tony shouting in pain and his heart sped up in fear as he roughly pushed through the last people between him and the grungy bathroom door.
It was made easier with the full support of his team and the bulk of the superhero community, banding together to show their approval. Tony even got them all heavily behind the movement to legalise same sex marriage, Steve knew he had personally donated a large amount of funds to it and his heart swelled for the man he loved.
It was difficult to suppress the wince he felt when looking down at Tony, now that the blood had been wiped away it was hard to miss the bruising and swelling. His left eye wasn’t going to be opening any time soon as the impressive array of deep purples and black bloomed beneath the swollen skin. There were twenty-five delicate stitches between his hairline and chin where the mirror had cut in to him, smaller cuts that Steve hadn’t noticed when they were still in that damn bathroom.
‘No promises, you know me Nat.’ Tony tried to wink, failing miserably. ‘Trouble follows me around like a bad smell; all I wanted to do was take a piss. I didn’t actually start it this time.’ He looked annoyed by this and Steve shook his head in humour. ‘Where is everyone else?’
As disconcerting as it was to see Tony so still and battered, Steve still smiled softly over the way they team came together in times of need like this. They had been steadily moving in the direction of family over colleagues in the year they had known each other, and it warmed him to know they were here now and supported him. That Tony would have their support when he woke up and as they tried to move on from this, Steve knew he wasn’t the only one being affected by this.
‘We are ready to move sir.’ One of the paramedics nodded toward the door and with a deep, steadying breath Steve nodded his head and moved ahead of them.
‘He’s going to be sore when he wakes up and my works going to be cut out for me, trying to make him rest,’ Natasha snorted at that ‘but it looks like he’ll be fine and will make a full recovery.’ They seemed to take that as permission to come in as Natasha moved in to the room and settled delicately on the end of Tony’s bed without disturbing him.
The establishment they had chosen for their night out wasn’t exactly somewhere high end where Tony would normally spend his time, overcrowded with low lighting and too many televisions showing a collection of American sports but it had a well-worn interior that grew on you. At least until he stepped through the battered and dirty door in to men’s room, Tony grimaced as he took in the germ warfare of stained urinals and tried not to think about what exactly was making the filthy tiles sticky under his feet. Men’s restrooms were a sight to behold in any place but this had to be on the worst he had ever used, Tony almost considered turning around and just going out to the alleyway instead. But the thought of explaining to Pepper why he had been arrested for public indecency and needed bail had him turning towards one of the urinals and hurriedly finishing his business.
After tonight Steve vowed to himself that he was done remaining quiet about this, he was going to set fire to this mess. Captain America had an image and sway over the public and he was going to put it to good use, no matter how many people told him to let sleeping dogs lie he couldn’t just sit back anymore. This didn’t fall solely on Tony’s shoulders and it should never have in the first place, Steve should have been there in the public’s eye right alongside of him as they dealt with their relationship becoming public.
Headlines had splashed across magazines and tabloids while talk show panels demonised Tony for corrupting an American Icon and damaging the image of something pure and innocent. Steve had been furious when he had come across them treating the team to a few impressive rants and threats to take his thoughts public. A poor unsuspecting PR woman had had to take Steve aside and explain to him why he couldn’t add fuel to the fire, and why it was best to just grin and bear it even when it was unfair.
Clint dragged more chairs in and Steve spared a moment of misery with Thor as he gingerly lowered himself in to it, while Bruce went directly to the monitors and palming Tony’s chart as he went. Clint kicked his feet up beside Natasha’s thigh as he settled in, Bruce hummed thoughtfully as he paged through the folder.
Without caring for the cameras Steve brought his hand up to cradle Tony’s face before melding their lips together, deepening the kiss and trying to show how much he loved the smaller man with his mouth before pulling away with a soft breathy
Shortly after arriving at the hospital he had been in touch with Pepper, asking for help in organising a way to show his full support of the LGBTQ Community and how he could get in touch with someone to start working with them publically. He was done keeping to the shadows, there was good to be done there for a whole community of people that needed more awareness. Steve was more than happy to put his image out there, to help shed light on the issues they faced every day.
After six hours of fielding phone calls and giving a statement to the police over his part in what happened at the pub, filling out as many details as he could for Tony’s treatment, Steve was ready to fall over and sleep for a lifetime. Shifting in the torturously small chair that had been placed by Tony’s bed, Steve spread his legs out in front of him and looked down at his sleeping partner.
‘You mean my reckless good looks?’ Without realising he had moved Steve was sitting on the side of the bed where Natasha had just been, cradling Tony’s bruised face in his hands with wet eyes as he kissed him softly. ‘Hey you.’ He rasped when Steve pulled away and it was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard.
Paramedics had cut Tony’s shirt down the middle for better access and Steve spared a thought for the well-worn Black Sabbath top, one of Tony’s favourites, before his eyes lingered on the swelling and obvious displacement of his shoulder and the mottled bruising that was already showing over his ribcage. The casing of the arc reactor was red and puffy but Steve was relieved to see the glass was unbroken and the cerulean blue was still shining strong, it was obvious the paramedics were out of their depth with it by the looks they kept casting toward it.
, need to fight against and I appreciate your help. All of your help.’ He smiled up at his team mates softly, squeezing Tony’s hand.
Echoes of what the three men had been spitting at Tony while they kicked him were echoing in his head, venom that made him want to leave Tony in Natasha’s arms so he could stand up and take out his pent up rage on the unconscious men sprawled behind him. Hate crimes were a common theme in the LGTBQ community; after they had been publically outed Steve had done his research on the movement. Despite how far the world had come in their acceptance of same sex couples; there were still people that didn’t agree with it.
In the dark, a hope, false or not; Tony and Steve hoped one day, their son would return to them safely and unharmed.
Soon Hawkeye had caught up to Spiderman. He saw the guy go and take a detour only to stop near a building. He noticed the kid was looking from right to left, making sure that no one was around or following him. He sighed in relief as he took out his bag behind one of the wooden doors. Hawkeye grinned as he lightly made his way toward Spiderman without making any noises.
For now, they would wait until Peter was out from the infirmary. They needed to discuss this with the boy. They must tell him
“Ah… I see you’re here to ask a few questions with Miss Stacy? There were already police officers asking her about it. I’ll see what I can do to call her to my office so you can see her for yourself." He said. “Ah, that would be great and thank you sir.” Natasha said. “No problem ma’am. Now let’s head to my office, you can wait for her there while I’ll go get Miss Stacy from her class.” He said as Natasha nodded. They walked straight towards his office.
“Right. So shall we check it out?” Tony asked. Steve hesitated for a moment before he reluctantly agreed, entering the doorway along with his husband. Tony being the most excited among all of them. In the midst was the incubator infant they saw on the video footage, beside it a table trolley with syringes, three empty small jars, and a used glove.
“Only for emergency, I know, dad.” Peter said. Tony rolled his eyes at his son, ruffling the boy’s head. “And one more thing? You’re not yet allowed to go on a night duty.” Steve said. Peter whined at this. Steve ignored it and continued to explain. “Your father and I already discuss it and come to an agreement. You will never go out alone as Spiderman ever.” Steve said.
The place inside the house was filled with dust and webs. The living room was in the left side, and on the right side was the kitchen and in the midst was a ladder that led upstairs where the bedrooms were. Jane and Susan decided to check the kitchen, while Bruce and Clint decided to check upstairs, and Tony and Steve decided to check the living room.
That night, after his eyes blinked close, Peter was dreaming. He dreamed a dream of him in a closed, confined white room with men in white surrounded him. Through his eyes, he was looking at something but couldn’t tell what it was.
Tony sighed before saying. “We don’t have a choice Hawkeye.  Plan C is more important right now.” he said.
“We also found out that Mr. and Mrs. Parker lived in a different town house, in Manhattan New York.” Jane nodded at that statement.
“Hmm…must be a tough job being the head or the CEO of a company, especially with someone like this?” Peter joked a little, earning him a chuckle from Clint (though Peter didn’t hear it), since Clint was pretending to be mute.
“Actually pops I was sunbathing, and since the pants was getting in the way, I had to take it off.” Peter pointed out obviously, which didn’t amuse Steve who was already having a hard day.
Tony, Steve and Richard stared weirdly at Bruce before shrugging their shoulders. Tony began to explain on what they were about to do inside the Oscorp building.
“I need to make a call for the Parker household—“He said but was cut off as Peter interjected. “Wait! I’m her relative!”
One of the men went towards him and picked up an object (It looked like a syringe). He tried to move but couldn’t. He saw a gloved hand wiped some sort of a liquid along his skin before a needle punctured into his system.
“I would like for everyone here to know that Spiderman is already part of the Avengers. He will be working alongside us. Well, mostly he will be put in the Young Avengers for the time being. I’ll let it be handled by Captain America and Iron Man since the two are the leaders of the Avengers. They will be the ones to decide to where they want Spiderman to be with.” He said.
“They were planning to do a mission for the rest of the Avengers to capture and persuade you into joining our group. It seems like Nick had beat them up to it. They were trying to make Hawkeye test your skill a few months ago. That was the mission they were supposed to do but Nick was at his limit and being impatient about it and well…” Nova said, stopping a bit to think of a way on how to break the news to Peter in a nice way.
