Castiel had been about to embark on another lecture on the nice things that heaven needed to be stocked with in readiness for Dean—Jack could see in his mind the seething toy box of random, generally shrink-wrapped, objects that Castiel believed Dean must have—when the Empty, as much as a black wave of oblivion-seeking nothingness could be said to wail and rock, began to wail and rock. If it had possessed wild elf-locks of hair it would have been clawing at them.
Castiel recoiled. “It has to be the kind of pie you can buy from the counter of a store that also sells you twinkies and gas.”
It occurred to Castiel that he had probably known all along that the Empty was what Dean would call a control freak, but while in the past any change to its environment had enkindled black rage, now it seemed too overwhelmed by this unfurling strangeness to object. It moved in a slow daze to a drift of bluebells snaking through a rise of growing trees. “What’s that smell?”
He had loved Earth as he had never loved Heaven, but now there was a new Heaven and a new Earth, because Jack was not Chuck, and when Sam and Dean met their deaths, as they inevitably must, nothing would end for them. They would discover the world anew.
Still, when Jack took his hand, it felt like a boy’s hand in his, not a god’s; warm and bony and human, because that was what Jack wanted him to feel; the comforting squeeze of the boy he had raised and loved as well as the comforting squeeze of the father who loved all his angels but loved Castiel just a little bit more than all the rest.
“Did it feel like nothing more than that down there?” Castiel demanded. “Did Dean feel like that down there?”
“Some people don’t believe they’re allowed to have nice things.” Jack could say that with confidence because he had been one of those people himself. He did, however, think that he had more excuse than most; when one was born an abomination, it was understandable that one might lack self-worth.
“This is you,” Castiel said. “Once you dreamed of endless night and now you dream of—” He was not Jack so he could not unselfconsciously stand here, after over ten years of knowing Dean Winchester and his many and varied expressions, and say ‘sweet delight’. “This. You dream of this now. You were that and now you’re this.”
If Balthazar was awake there might start being orgies in the Empty. There was a time when he would have been shocked by that thought and it would have worried him. He was now only mildly curious as to how long it would take and who Balthazar would get involved first.
They were still debating it as they stepped from the Empty into Heaven; no longer white and sterile and charred by the blasted wings of murdered angels but green and tree-filled, and with the smoke of the hut from John and Mary Winchester’s house throwing a soft grey question mark into the sky.
Dean had been accused of contaminating and corrupting him with his touch and now he was afraid that he was altering the Empty in the way that, according to quantum mechanics, a system could be disrupted merely by being observed. Of course, quantum mechanics was merely a clumsy humanoid attempt to replicate the same celestial mechanics that ordered non-interference with God’s plan; by which heavenly law he had lived the majority of the millennia of life before what his brethren called the Winchester Event.
Because he knew everything now, Jack had the briefest flash of Mary Winchester thinking the same thoughts in relation to John, only in her case knowing what it was she was thinking and recognizing their root. It was astonishing how much more of the world and their own wants frail, mayfly humans knew than did eternal angels, kissed by the oblivion of the divine.
“I thought you did it?” He remembered that he was the one who had read fairy-tales to Jack when Jack had been a golden warmth that he could feel in Kelly’s womb. That he had been happy.
They went back and forth on it, mostly because Jack missed Castiel and liked to hear his voice and yet the time still didn’t feel right to pluck him out of the Empty, which was now writhing and twisting down there, because every time they communicated, sparks and firefly flickers of heaven got in; cinders of starfire and echoes of grace, like sunlight falling onto the ocean floor. Castiel would speak faster and faster, telling him all the ways that heaven could be perfected, communities of loved ones living at the perfect distance, gardens in which every apple could be eaten, the sound of sea surf and the sunlit hum of bees. The shadow of clouds on a cornfield; the purr of sleeping kittens; the scent of jasmine and vanilla; whale-song; susurrations of starlings; moonlight on white flowers; the coil of a horse herd galloping downhill. It was a long list. An almost infinite list. They were letting in too much light and Castiel was getting hoarse.
(He had read all of Shakespeare when he had read everything else, but he was now going back and re-reading it, not, as far as he could manage, as an omniscient deity, who understood every line, and could see it being written, but as the college student Jack could have been, grappling with it, being shocked by the way a line of verse from centuries past could reach out and take him by the heart.)
Sometimes an angel would say something that confused him for the fraction of a fraction: “Father, what of your father?”
“I’ve decided they should have a place to step away from Heaven and Earth but that isn’t monochrome and full of monsters, like Purgatory, or full of disaster capitalists and armaments dealers, like Hell, but isn’t as—”
“Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?" Or in his case, surprises. The good in Chuck had been amazed by man; had loved the way they surprised him, until Sam and Dean had surprised him once too often, by sidestepping his eternal plan, so that Chuck had become embittered once again, as he had before, when the beautiful mystery he had made had begun to malfunction and he had drowned its rusty cogs and levers and wept a sea of sorrow onto its broken bones. Jack wanted there to always be more surprises and not just at how beautiful everything was, although that was still resounding like a thunderclap within him. No wonder, Castiel had become distracted by the beauty of bees; sometimes he wanted to spend eternity just studying dew upon a spider’s web.
So, he didn’t know why he was leaving Castiel in the Empty, when as someone who loved Castiel and missed him, the way a son missed a father and a father missed a son, his first instinct as the old perhaps-never-quite-human Jack was to pluck him free and hug him. Yet something that he didn’t want to look at directly, in the way he felt sure that if had ever had a normal childhood he would not have wanted to unwrap his presents early, was staying his hand. He could have found out, by letting himself know, but he preferred to wait and see.
Far off, he seemed to hear the drip of it, as one might encounter it in a deep cave, where the light barely reached, but the beauty built up anyway, heedless of being unseen, black water and the dragon teeth of stalactites. It was too terrible, the beauty of the world. Every angel knew not to linger, lest it blinded them, but he was not the only one seduced by a sunset, by the way winter danced in a flurry of white flakes or autumn bronzed the rain; the way spring found its way up through the iron earth in tendrils tender as a blade of grass, or summer burst out in perfumed petals, drunk by banded bees; starry nights and sea-glass waves; red-veined rocks and plunging falls. The mist of water from a deep fall, that had taken him unawares once, when the light had spied through it and made the droplets dazzle like diamonds, and, once, the fog of a churchyard by moonlight; such an ache of old love about the graves…. The orders had been strict: it was their task to follow the Plan and maintain their father’s creation; not to be bedazzled by it. Not to fall in love with it.
He could feel Castiel’s bewilderment warring with Castiel’s internal Anubian scale as he cross-checked his own behavior for past and present sins. After a pause, Castiel offered hoarsely, “Last night I thought about the way the Impala smells. How it smells like Dean.”
“A place where angels can lay down their fiery swords. An angel can’t really retire to Heaven, after all. That would be like a broker retiring to the stock exchange.”
Jack thought about reminding Castiel of the times that people had died for Dean Winchester; how many of the people in Dean’s life since he was born would have put themselves between a hellhound and his heart in less time than that heart could beat: not just Sam, although absolutely Sam, but Mary, John, Bobby, Castiel, Jack. How could you be someone whose father had offered his own life with a smile on his lips to save you and still think yourself worthless? And even as the thought flickered through his mind, Jack knew, of course, and had always known, being omniscient, that here was the root of Dean’s self-loathing, because John had died to save him and he hadn’t thought himself worthy of the sacrifice.
He stepped over Balthazar, whom he had murdered, and who was now dreaming, not the deep dreaming stillness of the void, but slumbers whose black waves were beginning to be tinged with streaks of indigo, once-tarry silence interrupted by distant music as if from a far-off room.
The path was clearly visible and he wended back along it around the bodies of sleeping angels, who were dreaming bright dreams now that made their wings unfurl like flower stems and their feathers tremble at the kiss of fleeting air. Primroses had joined the snowdrops and there were brown roots snaking back into the lightening darkness to meet the trunks of rising trees.
Jack felt his sympathy for the Empty add itself to the twilight blurring its black edges; his and Castiel’s pity for it twine together and flit into that infinite emptiness of anger like a vagrant butterfly whose wings could not be singed.
He had not intended to alter the Empty. He had made the sacrifice imagining it to be permanent and dreadful, buoyed up only by the knowledge that Dean had been saved, but he could not deny that he and Jack between them must have inadvertently cracked something, because somehow the light was getting in.
“I still believe that Dean could get used to good pie,” Jack said, and sent him a teasing thought of fragrant flakes of best French pastry in which fruits of the forest ran red in a wine-scented jus.
In the beginning was the Void and the Void was perfect. Everyone slept and no one dreamed. It was as still as a frozen sea; as black as the hole in the universe left when a star burned out; as silent as a centuries-old scream. Nothing could mar it. Nothing could change it. In all its empty perfection, it simply
The angels were definitely stirring now and everything was growing. The strength of the earth’s roots and bones shivered through him; the melancholy music of life and death; of great whales upon the ocean and wildebeest flowing across the savannah; he felt overwhelmed by the boom of storm water upon jagged rocks, and the sidewinder’s scale-words written in desert sand. There were two points pricking his heart, thin and sharp as glass, the knowledge that one day Sam and Dean were going to die.
And then, subtly, horribly, like a ragged old trenchcoat remade once too often by celestial will, it began to fray; and for that, tarry black vengeance was the only answer.
He and Castiel were at odds as to what exactly constituted heaven. There was a part of Jack that wanted to gather Sam and Dean to himself so that he could keep them from harm. So they could be with their mother and father again, and all their fallen friends, the ones for whom he had not yet been able to find a justification to return to earth.
“Are we recycling angels now?” He had murdered so many of them. He wasn’t sure he deserved to have that crime erased but they had not deserved to be banished into oblivion.
Castiel jumped, realizing for the first time why Dean and Sam had always done that strange start and lurch when he alighted silently behind them. It was, he now saw, quite disconcerting.
“I don’t think Chuck ever gave the heavenly host a chance to fall in love with the world or the people in it,” Jack added. “And thank you.”
They both looked over their shoulders. The Empty had picked a mixed bouquet and was offering a drooping bloom to a green lizard on a mossy log. Behind him, bemused angels were waking from their slumbers, stretching and yawning and flexing their wings. A beam of sunlight cut through a forest path that seemed to wend away into mystery and new adventure. Far away, Castiel thought he could hear the rumbling voice of the ocean, and further off the purple twilight of a far-distant night.
Couldn’t Dean, when the time came, have pie without corn syrup, have a copy of the Louvre to look at instead of Busty Asian Babes? Did there have to be hentai in heaven? Wasn’t it perfectly possible that heaven could be heaven for Dean without cheap silk panties? Without quite so much beer?
“You could just put the less…elevated things in a box under his bed. Perhaps up here he wouldn’t feel the need for them?”
It had been a surprise for Jack to learn that the other angels had long considered Castiel a victim of Stockholm Syndrome. He had been carrying out a mission—to remove a human from hell and restore it to earth—and been contaminated by contact, because the Winchesters were just that toxic. Dean Winchester had corrupted his celestial heart and now he was a warning for the curious, a cautionary tale, told with much wing-wagging; Heaven’s own Patty Hearst. (Jack understood those references now: ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ and ‘Patty Hearst’; because he understood everything now. The references were, however, still wrong.)
He thought this place was beautiful and that he could be happy here. He had friends here. Admittedly many of them were friends he had murdered, but, still, he was ready and willing to make amends. And yet— He couldn’t seem to let go of the life he’d had; not the one that had stretched out like a rolling ocean for millennia, but the brief, full, painful, beautiful one with Sam and Dean and Jack. He looked up and saw just a flicker of uncertainty cross Jack’s young omniscient face.
“The feel of the engine, the way it gets into the bones; the way it rocks on its own suspension even as it rolls over the road; the sound of the different surfaces adjusting to the music of the wheels, those tiny bird-strikes of gravel on the under-carriage; the way it’s a different car by night. How, if you fall asleep on its seats, they cradle you and crease you and taste like Led Zeppelin music sounds.”
The guilt of his two crimes—murdering his brother; disturbing the Empty—collided as he hurried on, following a path that wound out of blackness into blackness but which here and there was now misted with a rising light. Behind him he was afraid that his brother’s dreams were rolling into glorious supernovas of deep purple and blood-black red; soon there might be starbursts. Dimly, he thought he saw the trunks of pale grey birches, heard something like the sigh of a faint breeze. He and Jack had been thinking of the Garden; perhaps they had let in a soft fall of moss; the wend of a single leaf. As long as there was no water—
“Dean has a dog now,” Jack told Castiel who said, “Well, then,” and enumerated all the things that Dean liked about being alive, that now, from this celestial distance, seemed to Jack to all carry about them the recycled air and sticky PVC feel of things found or watched or dreamed of in beige-carpeted motel rooms.
“There is nothing left of the world I knew,” the Empty said, gathering its blackness to it like widow’s weeds as the light and colour flowed in around it.
And he would think ‘Castiel? Sam? Dean?’ and then realize that they meant ‘Lucifer’, who had never been his father; not made any effort to raise him to know that the night held teeth, the new day a chance for redemption, or to teach him, before they put a weapon in his hand, to know right from wrong.
“What are they?” the Empty demanded, pointing into the trees but not anything like as aghast as Castiel might have expected.
Jack found that being omniscient was something, like tinnitus, that he could almost tune out. It was there in the background all the time, of course, an eternal hum, but if he could distract himself, he could almost forget it was there and be more human. Had he ever been human? According to all the old records, he was an abomination who should have been destroyed. He liked reading the old records, they were strange and interesting, and sometimes wrong; as someone who had, in his time, been strange and interesting and sometimes wrong, he found their cracked stones and scraped vellum comforting. He would touch them gently, like frightened puppies, and say ‘There, there’, because it didn’t matter that they hadn’t always got everything right. They had been doing their best.
The answer was yes, and no, and mostly no, but with some yes mixed in with it, like a rogue thread, which was fitting, because even more than Sam, Dean had always been a rogue thread in the celestial tapestry. Then Castiel rhapsodized about Dean and it was beautiful, poetry, it shimmered like lotus flowers on silky blue waters and Jack felt the thrill of it ripple through him, and he realized that it was perfectly all right to be blinded by love, that that feeling he had for these flawed beings who had raised him, which was utterly untainted by his awareness of their flaws, was the way Castiel saw Dean. It wasn’t that Castiel didn’t know, almost as well as Sam did, that Dean had strange tastes and a restricted palate, it was that he did not see them as failings, only as part of the miraculous whole that was Dean. Whom he also, on occasion, thought was an ass-butt.
The lancing pain retreated. The Empty gave him a searching, baffled, but no longer hate-filled look, and wandered off, stopping here and there to stare in mystification but no particular resentment, at a mossy tree trunk, or a beetle, or to meet the bright, inquisitive eye of an insect-questing bird.
“It just sounds a little like beer, pie, pornography, and driving an old car with a trunk full of shotguns,” he admitted, apologetically, because he understood small shrines as he had never understood them when half-human and almost newborn, and like the Romans with their ancestors, Castiel had his household gods.
In heaven, a passing angel sniffed as it overheard and said, “Oh yes, the Winchester oroboros of obsessive co-dependence, eternally eating its own tail.”
“Everything’s alive,” the Empty said, not accusingly as he expected, but with a slow bewilderment. It held out a hand and something shimmered blue and landed on its palm. They watched the opening and closing of new wings together. “I don’t know what any of these things are.”
He looked down and there were white flowers with their heads nodding humbly and Jack’s voice in his head, murmuring happily: ‘Thou fairy gift from summer, Why art thou blooming now?’ because Jack had read everything and was charmed by all of it and even in the midst of his self-imposed exile and his fretting over Heaven not being readied for the Winchesters with every detail right, Castiel felt a sharp pang of pride, because he and Sam and Dean had raised Kelly’s son so well. He knew that this was a snowdrop and it symbolized Candlemas and poets saw the holy trinity in its drooping stems and tender white petals, and that it had absolutely no business blooming here. Even a moment earlier he might have shooed it away, like a stray kitten he would sneak back and feed later when no one was watching, but thoughts of Kelly had somehow chipped through that wall he had erected which set him on the side of martyrdom and stoic endurance. He wanted to see Kelly so they could be proud of Jack together. He wanted to see Mary again. He wanted to see Bobby again. He wanted to meet the John Winchester who had died to save Dean. He wanted to hug Jack.
“Yes.” He said it so fast, it was swallowed up by his eagerness and he had to clear his throat and try again. “Yes, if that is…allowed.”
He and Castiel were communing by something almost like angel radio, more like celestial whispers, because Castiel said they should try not to disturb the others who were sleeping. (Into Jack’s mind came images of the children of selkies singing into seashells so that their mothers might hear them in the depths of the sea; of ragged children with tin cans and string; of men in foxholes connected by thin silver wires that snaked through the shell-coughed mud. History was his library now, and even though he had read it all, there were chapters that had been more vivid than others. Some that he wanted to revisit; others even he could barely look at without a shudder.) Being Castiel, he had said it in the kind of stage-whisper that carried like a hailstorm and made the Empty thrash and writhe like a seethe of black treacle and Jack close his eyes and picture them in a child’s storybook, the great heaving wrath of the Empty wanting to crash down on an oblivious tiny, trench-coated Castiel and he, sternly, with a hand outstretched, keeping it at bay.
(“Balthazar—are you comparing Sam and Dean to a mass extinction event responsible for wiping out two-thirds of life on Earth?”
“Yes, brother, I am. The real question is, why aren’t you? Your shaved apes are a two-person plague year. Or to put it in terms they might possibly comprehend, they are the sugar in the gas tank of your celestial life.”)
“Bears,” he said, briefly. “A mother and cubs. Sam says one should never come between them, at least, not if one doesn’t want to be eaten.”
Castiel would be the last one to forget to treat him like a child; Jack realized that he was grateful for that.
“If you didn’t want me to fall in love with it, you shouldn’t have made it so beautiful,” he said aloud to the gathered weight of blackness that was beginning to thin around him. Was he talking about the world or Dean Winchester? Either way, they were his Father’s creation.
This was the moment Dean regretted coming back to life. Whatever fucked up shit he was dealing with in the afterlife was puppies and rainbows compared to this. Dean knew it was gonna bite him in the ass, he just didn’t think it would be this soon.
But unlike before, he didn’t have a feeling of weight lifted off of him. He wasn’t new to coming back to life under questionable circumstances but when Chuck revived him or even when Cas pulled him out of Hell, Dean had had this sense of righteousness, that he was back for a reason. That feeling was completely absent. This wasn’t the work of good and he still didn’t understand why
His hand traveled from the back of Cas’s neck to his hair. He was going to live out what he came to last night and it played out perfect.
Cas averted his eyes as Dean got to his feet. “I’ll go get Sam and Jack,” he said timidly. Dean could tell from his voice that he was uneasy.
Cas looked at Dean wearily and an ache rippled through Dean’s heart. Abadon putting Cas through this only fanned the fire.
His skin cooled as Cas slipped his hand from his bare shoulder. Dear fucking Lord, what is happening?
Nodding, Sam turned his body to face Castiel and his eyes show confusion but he doesn’t change the subject. “Uh yeah. He said something about meeting with some friends from town.”
He teased his finger in that same spot, testing the waters. Cas’s mouth vibrated as he moaned silently at the feeling and Dean smiled into the kiss. Wings were a
Jack had been silent this whole time, clearly uncomfortable, so Dean was surprised when he spoke, “What were you doing in your room?”
Dean rolled his eyes, exaggerating the motion. “Jack’s grace being MIA? This ringing any bells? Where are we on that?”
He couldn’t see Cas’s face as he climbed up the bed, closer to his face. Glass shards cutting into his bare skin. He didn’t care.
Cas only gave him a slight nod. Dean headed toward the door - stopping suddenly at the sound of rustling sheets. In a second, Castiel’s warm body was pressing up against his back and all of Dean’s blood was rushing south. What is this angel doing to him?
It was unnerving to see Cas wearing something other than his trusty trench coat. Dean thought about sliding his hands under that Zeppelin shirt and caressing Cas’s skin. He swallowed, trying to think about anything else.
Castiel shot daggers at Dean and he didn’t understand until Jack spoke again, “No I didn’t. We have no idea where it is.”
"No," Dean responded instantly, his tone harsher than he had intended. Clenching his fists, he fought the heat rising back in his loins. He softened his tone, "Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna get my four hours anyways."
Cas saw Dean clench his jaw and heard his teeth grind in response. “Cas—I’m not talking about this.”
Even worse, Dean could feel the First Blade in the Impala with them, even though it was wrapped safely inside Cas’s trench coat. It wasn’t just calling out to him, Dean could physically feel its presence, and it took everything not to hold it in his hands. He was getting worse.
“What do you mean ‘no longer online’?” Dean asked, running his hand through his hair. It was a response to anxiety. He had to escape Sam before he noticed his growing bulge. He was not going to have that conversation.
Everything happened in a blur, but Dean felt every second of it. Cas approached Abadon as Dean fruitlessly fought his restraints. Dean watched as Abadon stopped the angel in his tracks, anguish contorting in his blue eyes. The tip of her boot slammed into the underneath of Cas’s jaw, blood spurting on the hay-covered floor.
He shifted closer to Cas, aligning himself with the angel’s entrance. He gathered a generous amount of spit in his mouth and let it drip down on his swollen and desperate cock, stroking himself to spread it.
Castiel's next step forward wasn't cautious, instead, it was resolute. "I will not leave you," he cast his eyes around, absorbing the sight of the butchered bodies surrounding them. "Not like this."
“Seriously Dean. You aren’t going to brush this off. Jack could be in trouble, someone could be hurting him.”
Dean tugged his hair, exposing Cas’s neck. He drew his tongue from his collarbone to under his ear, making the angel shudder and whimper. But he didn’t just whimper, he whimpered his name.
He wasn’t going to let this happen, not to Cas. Abadon was going to slaughter Cas and she was going to make Dean watch. Uncontrollable fury filled him, barely winning against the despair of what he would witness if he lost.
Cas’s hand brushed against Dean’s bare abdomen as he passed over a pair of frayed sweats, “Do you want a shirt as well?”
Finally, Sam snapped out of his daze, the anger in his brother’s voice hitting him like a punch. Sam doesn’t react the way Dean expected him to; Dean expected an excuse, but what fell out of Sam’s mouth was anything but.
. I WAS DEAD, SAM! Something is wrong with Jack you have the fucking balls to look at me like what I’m doing is confusing!” Dean was raising his voice without even realizing it, even the touch of Cas’s hand on his forearm wasn’t enough to calm him now. Dean was caught up in the rage burning across his vision.
“Cas. Stop.” Dean barked, sticking his M1911 in the waistband of his jeans. Cas was acting crazy, desperate.
Straight ahead was Abadon, both hands resting on Jack’s shoulders from behind. Not a trace of fear in her expression. Jack’s head was limp to the side, he wasn’t conscious.
He knew he was dead. He felt the slicing pain of the knife. Death wasn’t instant, he bled out on the barn floor for what felt like a lifetime before darkness finally took over.
Even as he opened his eyes, Cas didn’t move his hand. It was placed right where it had been when he pulled him from perdition all those years ago. “Dean? Are you alright?” His voice was low, touched with concern.
He had much to think about during that night. Dean had told him he loved him…and then kissed him. Of course, they had kissed before but this one was completely different than the ones before. It was tender, Dean had meant it as the ultimate goodbye. Cas wanted to tell him back but his throat was closed shut, even though his entire being was screaming for him to open his mouth. Those three words had never been told to Cas, not by Dean.
Instantly, he was kicked out of his dream; a tender hand resting on his left shoulder.  He hadn’t woken up on his own.
Of course, that’s what it was. Cas didn’t enjoy watching Dean sleep, he just was afraid that he would go on a murder bender. “Well, I’m a grown man Cas. I don’t need a babysitter,” Dean snapped.
Dean placed his hand on the back of Cas’s neck, pulling him close. He rested his forehead against his angel’s, looking deeply into his eyes. Agony and peaceful acceptance washing over him.
The look Cas gave him made his throat tense; it was a burning stare that sliced right through him. It definitely wasn’t made for discussion at the kitchen table. Dean thought it might do better in his bedroom, with Cas underneath him.
But then he saw the movement again and he caught it. Dean’s fingers were curling into the blanket beneath him. Castiel’s entire being stopped cold. He was already losing his mind.
A small smile tugged on Jack’s lips, pulling on his injured cheek and making him wince; anxiety was welling up inside Dean and he had only seen him for ten seconds. “You’re back.”
Cas didn’t need to speak, his eyes said it all and they weren’t gentle about it. There it was again, the glare better suited for the bedroom.
The tension broke as Cas’s lips joined Dean’s. It was a thoughtless process. The way his body crashed against Dean’s and his hands finding their way to Dean’s hair, desperately running his fingers through it. Dean’s other hand pressed against the small of his back, pressing him even closer.
Dean continued to hit that special spot and Dean saw Castiel’s breathing becoming uneven, he was close. So, Dean continued to pound, hard and ruthless. He could feel the heat pooling inside his stomach, he was getting close…really close.
He heard his name in a way that he had never heard before. It wasn’t gruff or stern. It was plagued with pain. There was a warm hand in his and he embraced it.
“We were waiting to find a way to bring you back before we used all our energy to find his grace. We didn’t know it would take this large of a toll on him,” Cas stated, his expression was broken.
Like instinct, Dean looked up to meet Cas’s blue eyes and immediately regretted it. There it was again. That undeniable desire. Dean might have had the strength to withstand acting upon it but not enough to deny its existence.
Jack shook his head, blonde hairs falling in his face. He didn’t bother swiping them away. “I didn’t. I—I couldn’t have.”
Slowly, he started to swivel his hips, moving inside Cas. Cas had adjusted by then, his breaths were needy and frantic. He pulled back until only his tip remained and gave Cas a quick thrust, exciting a loud moan from his angel’s lips. Fuck, Cas felt like Heaven.
Dean turned to face him again, his hand resting lightly on Cas’s shoulder. “Wait,” he murmured, his hand finding its way to the side of Cas’s face. “Please heal yourself…now.”
The father of murder had been the one holding him before, and he rolled up his sleeves in preparation for a fight. “Kiss your angel goodbye, boy.” Cain advised, calm and patient.
Arms wrapped around Dean’s shoulders, it wasn’t familiar or comforting. The stranger forced Dean to his knees. He fought with every muscle and strength he had, begging for the blade to be in his hand.
felt those feelings before, but never outside his own fantasy. He wasn’t a stranger to sexual activity, he had slept with April… before Dean stabbed her. His time with April was unclear and forced. He had slept with her because the opportunity presented itself. But at the motel, it was something entirely different.
Jesus Christ, chill the fuck out man. Dean told his dick, which was now pressing hard against the fabric of his sweats. The only thing he could look at was the blue of Castiel’s eyes. Fuck, they were blue. It was a color that brought two feelings to Dean’s mind. Peace and hunger, and right now, they made Dean starving.
Dean knew very well this would be his last chance to look into Castiel’s sky blue eyes, his last chance to feel him. He wasn’t going to pass it up, damn his pride.
Dean clenched his jaw before throwing down Sam’s arm. Without thinking, he brought Cas’s hand to his mouth and kissed his knuckles. It was his way of saying thank you.
Instead, he settled for sucking a sweet piece of skin on Cas’s neck, making Cas push his hips forward. He was hard too.
Dean edged himself inside, pushing past the tight ring. He bit his lip to keep from moaning. Cas was so tight, so perfect. Cas grunted, trying to push farther onto Dean, but Dean’s hand was solid against his pelvic bone. Dean wanted to be in control of this, he wanted to have all of Castiel.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, “I don’t know Sammy. I killed ten demons last night with the blade, Cas didn’t think I should make the drive after.”
Sure enough, when he looked down, Dean’s body was completely bare and he had to choke down a boisterous laugh; still his chest rumbled and he gasped for a breath.
“No!” The word didn’t come from Dean’s mouth, it came from Cas’s—who was sprinting toward Abadon with only an angel blade.
Dean ground his hips before palming Cas through his jeans. He had lots of ideas of what he wanted to do to his angel.
A piece of blue caught Dean’s eye. Cas’s tie was stuffed inside the pocket of the trench coat. Dean barely had to reach out his hand to retrieve it. Castiel’s hands arms were above his head, entangled together. Dean smirked at his next thought.
Cas got to his feet, the angel blade sharp and dangerous. Dangerous to anyone but the enemy in front of him. Abadon gave a mocking chuckle before smashing her fist into his cheek, a loud crack reverberating through the air, sending Cas to his knees. Blood leaking from his nose and mouth, but he wasn’t done fighting. He didn’t get the chance to get to his feet before Abadon struck him again, harder, again, again, and again.
Dean repressed the very strong urge to roll his eyes. “Yes. Let’s get back to how we are going to get Jack’s grace back.”
He could feel Castiel’s worry weighing down on him, he turned his head to find his eyes glued to his own. “Don’t worry ‘bout it, man,” Dean said, shifting a little trying to hide his own worry.
“Dean—we didn’t know that losing his grace would do this. Cas wasn’t like that when Metatron took his…” Sam said, hesitantly taking a seat at the table.
Dean felt pure bliss as the shattered glass rained down on them, his angel shuddering beneath him. Time slowed to nothing, Cas singing his name. That moment he realized something, his Mark wasn’t pulsing or craving anything.
He found his way back to Castiel’s mouth, invading it with his tongue. He would occasionally pulled back slightly and reveling in the feeling of Castiel moaning and breathing into his mouth, begging for more with his eyes.
There was no point in being cautious, Dean gathered air inside his lungs. It only took one kick and the boarded doors to the barn burst open with a splintering crack.
The angel blade stopped mid-air, that’s all Dean needed. That exact second, the blade slid across the floor and rested in Dean’s palm. The power of the bond, feeding into his pain and wrath. In one simple shift of his shoulders, he was free from the grip of the restraints.
Want surged through Dean as he dragged Cas’s pants and underwear off his legs. The angel was completely exposed before him and Dean had no choice but to drink him in. He ran his hands across Castiel’s smooth chest, circling his finger around his navel causing him to squirm. Dean leaned down and traced his tongue across a nipple, sending a shudder through the angel.
Dean couldn’t bear to take his eyes off the angel…not yet. Even if it was a shocking sight— Cas was wearing a pair of Dean’s ratty old jeans and his favorite Led Zeppelin shirt.
Dean gripped himself and pulled. A bolt of pleasure exploded through him and a growl slipped between his teeth. Dean pressed his hand against the wall as he viciously stroked himself, he couldn't move his hand fast enough.
Eventually, Sam stepped away from the door frame, probably hoping that he had a grip on reality. His eyes haven’t left Dean, which made Dean shift uncomfortably in his seat.
The fire still remained in him through the rest of his shower and it sprung up once again when he stepped out of the bathroom to find Cas drawing off his white button-up.
They laid there as long as they could, entangled with each other. Dean would never get used to the feeling of their bare skin touching. Of being able to hold Cas and kiss him.
Something moved to his right, at least he thought but when he snapped his head to look, everything was still. He was imagining things, Sam and Jack were sleeping. The only light was the one next to Dean’s bed…Castiel had broken the overhead light—he couldn’t finish the thought, not without dying inside.
Dean knew this wasn’t the time for this. Jack was fucking missing and all he could focus on was the thought of drilling into his angel, which of course filled him with immense guilt.
“So what’s the plan, Dean? Find Cain and gank him? Because last time I checked, he killed you,” Sam’s no longer sitting.
Cas cleared his throat in an attempt to pull himself back together. “Where is the blade Dean? Sam needs to return it to the safe.”
This answer was the sound of a knock on the door. “Castiel? Are you alright?” Jack’s voice called from the other side.
...there was a thought. “Dean,” Cas ground out, snapping him from his daydream. His voice was husky and rough but it still felt like music to Dean’s ears.
Jack’s head snapped up to look at him and for a second, Dean saw the familiar child-like spark in his eyes. “Dean?” He was standing in a second, but his knees wobbled. Dean lunged forward in an attempt to catch him. Jack stabilized himself on the edge of the table. “I-I’m fine.”
so he reached down and gave his thigh a reassuring squeeze. He didn’t blame Cas for his tense and silent behavior. Sometimes Dean forgot that Jack wasn’t just his, Cas loved Jack just as much as Dean, he would have loved him more if it was possible.
An intense warmth began to grow him his belly, making him arch and moan. His hands fisting Dean’s hair, unable to let go.
Cas gasped as Dean’s wet finger caressed his entrance. He took his time circling the ring of muscle, he didn’t want to rush Cas into anything. It wasn’t until Cas let out a needy moan and pushed his ass down to increase the pressure that Dean slid the tip of his finger inside.
He jerked from the bed without warning but Castiel’s firm grip on his arm didn’t sway. His eyes were unreadable, filled with an expression Dean had never seen before. No matter his own distress, Dean couldn’t help but soothe the angel. He didn’t make an effort to touch Cas, but he didn’t tear his arm away.
“Dean—I-,” Cas cried out, his entire being spasming as he reached his end. The wave of pure ecstasy washing over him seemed never ending, he arched his back.
Cas was motionless, he waited a long moment before answering. “Jack prayed to me. I know where he is.”
Dean could hear the longing in his angel’s voice- it was riddled with guilt. It was the same guilt that bothered Dean. They both had chosen to fuck the moment he woke up rather than check on their son- the thought brought bile to Dean’s throat.
Cas shook his head, his eyebrow raising higher on his forehead and Dean’s heart almost gave out. “He doesn’t need the Mark, if anything he would be grateful it’s no longer a burden.”
Castiel cleared his throat, obviously noticing the change in Dean’s behavior. “I will go wash my clothes.” He got up awkwardly, his knee brushing lightly against Dean’s. Dean froze, his entire body turned to stone—and his blood started to flowing, straight to the last place he wanted.
Sam shifted in his chair, his eyes moving between Dean Cas. “At least we know why he took Jack—leverage.”
. He turned to look at his angels spread out on his bed and fuck it was a perfect sight. Cas wasn’t looking at Dean’s face but farther down, taking in the view of Dean’s swollen length. Dean saw him suck in a heavy breath.
Dean spared a glance toward Baby, envisioning the idea of climbing inside and rushing off. The thought of being stuck driving all the way back to Lebanon like this made him wince with discomfort. There was no way that he was going to make it with the strain building in his jeans.
Even Dean recognized the flaw in that logic. “Yeah, but why take his grace? That’s not exactly an easy task.”
Castiel wrapped his knuckles on the door to Dean’s room. “Dean?” He murmured, slowly pushing the door open.
The deep pit in his stomach that was telling him that he wasn’t worthy wasn’t a stranger to him, but it wasn’t his friend either. Dean lugged his feelings of self-hatred everywhere, an unrelenting weight dragging him down, no matter where he was or who he was with. Just because he was with Cas, didn’t make it disappear.
Almost as if Cas read his thoughts, a softness entered his gaze, like he wanted Dean to. “What do you want me to do?” He asked, his voice struggling to stay together.
Sam, like always, was trying to de-escalate the situation. Dean and Cas’s arguing voices spread from the map room to his room. “We know that. But this isn’t the kind of battle we go in guns blazing.”
Dean had died before, more times than he can count. But this time was different, he wasn’t living in a peaceful loop of his greatest hits and he wasn’t hanging from rusty meathooks waiting for the next slice of a razor. No, he was in a hardware store kneeling next to a pale and dying Jo. The hell hounds had gotten to her while she was trying to save him. It was his fault, he could barely look her in the eyes.
Castiel must have been thinking the same thing. He tugged Dean closer to the bed, laying down as he had once before. Dean barely had time to protest at the broken contact before Cas drew his face down to him.
Dean’s hands gripped his thighs tightly while he licked and sucked ferociously, Cas begging him not to stop.
Dean finished with the tie and went to remove his hand but Cas gripped his wrist. “You are going to talk about it, whether you like it or not.”
Hey just a fair warning: This chapter is a bit shorter and has almost no dialogue but its a necessary chapter... promise :)
He had seen him shirtless before, the sight was not a new one. But this time, Cas had a hard time looking away, despite the blood rushing to his groin.
Green met blue, both tinged with want and love. Dean nipped at the skin of his inner thigh and laughed at the little sound Cas made in response.
“What’re you doing?” Dean asked, pulling a black v-neck over his head. He bit his lip at the sight of Castiel with tousled hair and sweat drying on his forehead.
His name rolled so smoothly off Dean’s tongue. It was rare that he said it in full. It drove him mad. Cas couldn’t move his hand from Dean’s wrist. That
It wasn’t a question, just a statement. “Yeah, uh—I suppose I owe you a thank you,” Dean said, slipping into the seat beside him.
That simple sacrifice left an eternal mark on Dean. Yes, there was the handprint on his shoulder but it was also on his soul and the moment Castiel touched him he knew that Dean would become everything… and he did, but Cas left out that particular part.
Dean could read the pure fear in Cas’s pain-riddled eyes, he felt it too. But Dean felt much more than fear. He felt unmatched rage. He was even more eager to gut Abadon—to feel her blood stain his hands… and his soul. He understood that that feeling was coming from the Mark but that didn’t matter to him. She was going to die for taking Jack.
Just like instinct, he cut a glance toward the angel, and a spike of pure lust shot through him like a bullet from the colt. He forgot that Castiel was wearing his fucking clothes.
The hunter pulled Cas’s hair again…harder. “Oh no. Keep those pretty eyes open when I’m looking at you.”
Internally, he begged for Dean to open his emerald eyes. All of Dean’s humanity lived in his eyes, he couldn’t conjure up a false copy of them. If he opened his eyes, he was really alive.
He waited patiently for his brother to comprehend the situation. It really shouldn’t have been that hard considering that Sam was an actual super genius. The expressions passing across Sam’s face ranged from confused to annoyed. Thank god Sam was a deep sleeper, which meant that only Jack had heard them. Which now that Dean is thinking about it isn’t as comforting as it was originally.
Cas shouted a strangled version of Dean’s name as he clenched around him, white spilling all over his bare stomach. It was the sound of his name and the image of Cas twitching in ecstasy that sent Dean flying off the edge. He didn’t even have time to pull out before he was shooting come inside his angel.
Cas added more pressure to Dean’s arm, a signal for him to calm down. Thankfully, the soothing gesture works this time- it lifts the haze from Dean’s mind. Why was he getting angry so quickly? Of course, he is pissed about Jack still being injured but he didn’t usually get this angry this fast.
Cas did not stop himself from rolling his eyes. “You are acting more like children than the actual child.”
In response Dean gave a powerful thrust, slamming harshly into Cas, forcing Dean’s name from him. “Keep those pretty blue eyes open while I’m fucking you,” He growled, giving another thrust.
The exact second Dean’s lips touched his, everything else went away. It was as natural as using his wings. Dean’s hands roaming him was a new sensation and it thoughtlessly became Castiel’s most treasured experience and he was dying to be touched again, despite what his conscious was telling him.
“I’m sure there are a number of reasons why a demon would steal a Nephilim's grace. There are thousands of spells that require it as an ingredient,” Cas stated, he reached his arm out and barely squeezed Jack’s arm. The irritated wound on his face closed but the color didn’t return to his face.
A screaming ringing sounded through the room, turning both men into statues. Dean let out a huff of pure annoyance. Dean bit Castiel’s bottom lip as he pulled away. “Don’t move.” He ordered, reluctantly turning away.
Castiel’s lips were plump and swollen. Wet and wanting, even better than Dean had imagined. His eyes were pleading, upset that Dean had stopped kissing him.
Castiel told him about his beginning, before becoming an angel. When he was a speck of Grace when he was first created. How he was shaped for a specific purpose. He wasn’t alone in this creation. Dean was there too. He had nobody or physical form. He was nothing but a blinding and bare soul. They were created together, their destinies bonded beyond cosmic interference. He told him of his thousands of millennia waiting for Dean to be born, finally beginning his mission. God had intended Dean to break the first seal and no matter which road was taken…Castiel would always grip Dean tight and raise him from perdition—that’s what he was created for. Castiel liked to believe they were made for each other in every way.
The drive back to the bunker was awkward, to say the least, and Dean took a deep breath of relief as Baby slowed down as they approached home. Of course awkward didn’t cut it, this was more than that. Dean and Cas had never had this kind of tension between them. They had had their fair share of disagreements and strange moments, but never this.
He choked back sobs as he kneeled down next to his bleeding angel. He cupped his cheek in his palm, absorbing the heat from his skin. It was wet, Cas was crying.
Castiel patted Jack’s shoulder as he sat at the end of the table, his eyes were weary. “Yes, I don’t know how you managed it.”
If he thought about it enough, that pit would become a voice. The voice wouldn’t let him sleep. It wouldn’t let him smile. The voice wouldn’t let him eat, or laugh, or do much of anything- besides drinking himself into a stupor. The voice was his own. Dean thought once that he might have been able to control it- he was sorely mistaken. It was a swirling abyss of doubt that dragged him down and only grew darker with each passing second.
Dean shut him up, crushing his lips against his. Wildfire spread through him and across his skin. There was little resistance from the angel. Pure ecstasy flooded through Dean as Cas’s lips melted into his. God, his mouth fit perfectly with his.
Dean wanted to fuck him, right then, hard and raw against the wall while Cas wore his favorite shirt.
Dean knew that they probably should talk first but he couldn’t think about anything but the feel of his angel pressed against him, and he was desperate. Call it the Mark or him but he wanted Castiel then more than he had ever wanted anything.
Dean nodded but he held his breath, waiting for the burning in his chest to rise, waiting for his body to scream for air but it never did, even after he counted three minutes. It was strange, sure. But he had just come back from death, that wasn’t exactly smooth sailing.
As soon as Cas caught sight of the older Winchester, the breath was knocked out of him. Dean wasn’t wearing a shirt, his blue jeans hung loosely from his hips. His hair was damp and messy. Small water droplets clung and ran down his toned chest and abdomen. All Cas wanted to do was
Dean scoffed, a bitter chuckle slipping through his lips. “I can’t believe you are saying that to me now. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY CHILD AND YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT BRINGING ME BACK FROM THE DEAD! YOU’RE ONE HELL OF BROTHER, SAM!”
“Enough,” Sam stated, smacking his hand roughly on the table. “Back to the problems at hand, please!”
Dean knew that Sam was right but he wasn’t going to spiral alongside him. “Who would have the juice to kidnap Jack and keep him? No one. Problem solved.”
Dean could bullshit his way out of almost anything, that was a commonly known fact. But he couldn’t play off his anxiety over his missing son. That’s what Jack was to him, no matter how much he played it differently. Dean loved Jack, he would die for him without a second thought. He might not have shown it or said it, but he knew that Jack knew.
His thought process took place in mere seconds, he wasn't capable of making Cas leave and he couldn't leave himself. Dean cleared his throat, trying to balance his voice. "One more night at the motel won't hurt," he said, turning away from Cas's captivating gaze.
The bunker was quiet. The only sound Cas could hear was his weak breathing, building up a dam to hold back cries. He couldn’t take his eyes off Dean’s lifeless body laid out on his bed. Jack and Sam had already gone to their own rooms…there had been an argument surrounding giving Dean a hunter’s funeral. He wasn’t going to let that happen. What burns stays dead and Dean wasn’t going to stay dead.
Those thoughts died the second he saw Jack sitting idly at the kitchen table, his face vacant- at least, his expression was. The giant tear from Abbadon was red and inflamed on his plump cheek. But it wasn’t the injury that struck a chord, it was the vibrant purple patches under his crystal-like eyes. He looked like Dean did after extra difficult hunts, but the fatigue looked foreign on him. Jack didn’t get exhausted- the kid was a friggin super-human. Yet here he was, his skin pale and sickly looking, like those people from cancer treatment commercials.
Dean shouted, cursing and swearing. His entire being willing the blade to be in his hand again, but not for the sake of the Mark. All Dean could think is “anyone but him”.
Castiel’s entire body contoured to Dean’s, it was made to fit with his. Dean felt Cas’s fingers unfurled into his hair, leaving a fiery trails across his scalp.
“Killing? No. Butchering? Yes.” Cas replied, stepping closer, entering Dean’s personal space. “Those demons weren’t just dead, Dean. They were mutilated. You understand that their vessels felt everything you did?”
He didn’t rush filling Castiel up to his hilt, he wanted Castiel to remember what it felt to be filled by Dean…Dean always would.
“Jesus, Cas. You forgot but you had time to fix me?” Dean grumbled before tearing his shirt off completely.
Dean seemed to float, his entire being at peace in those seconds. He pulled out, plucking a dirty shirt from the floor and wiping the mess off Cas. He leaned down and planted his lips against Castiel’s as he unknotted the tie from around his wrists.
He searched the space for his brother, who was staring at him from the wall he had been slammed into. His eyes scared, like a child’s. Dean could only offer a smile and a knowing nod. He didn’t need words to say goodbye to his baby brother.
Dean couldn't get out of his clothes fast enough. He was completely frantic, and hard. Cas hadn't even touched him. Dean turned the water as cold as it would go, expecting the icy rain would slow his heartbeat and put out the fire.
Whenever Dean was touching Cas, the raging want and fear inside him faded to background noise and Dean never wanted to stop touching him. Warmth swelled in his chest feeling Cas’s fingers tangle in his hair as he came down from his high.
He had never felt true grief, despair. Even when Jack died, he had a sense that it wasn’t over for his son. But with Dean, he felt nothing like that. There was no reason for Dean to return, besides for selfish reasons. Castiel even doubted bringing him back, what if he was finally at peace like he deserved?
Cas tilted his head, squinting. Dean loved that expression. “You brought Dean back like you did with me.”
Castiel kissed him deeply, sending vibrations through Dean. “I love you too,” Cas purred into Dean’s ear.
Cas tore his gaze away from Dean’s. His eyes closing briefly as he felt the aches fade away and his wounds stitch themselves back together.
He expected Cas to head toward Jack’s room down the hall but he followed Dean close, hanging behind him like a bodyguard. It made Dean’s stomach twist. Cas was still concerned. Not that it isn’t justified- Dean just hates that Cas was always concerned.
Dean's chest was still heaving, his heart threatening to burst. He still couldn't drop the Blade. "You need to go, Cas."
Dean licked his lips, he didn’t need to blame the Mark for the surge of want spreading through him. “Did you watch me sleep all night?” Dean whispered, closing more distance between them.
Dean’s mouth was rough and starved, his tongue invaded meeting with his. Cas let out a barely audible moan as Dean rolled his hips against him. He could feel it again; the growing ache between his legs.
“You’re perfect, you know that?” Dean whispered, nipping at a spot on the angel’s neck, making him squirm.
And then…Dean’s eyelids fluttered as if they were scared to open. Unconsciously, Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s and melted as Dean’s curled around it.
His thoughts strayed all over, covering his thousands of years but all thoughts connected back to Dean. Of course, they did; he was everything.
Realization spread through Cas's eyes and he looked toward the floor. "I will put them back on," he said, his voice breathing life back into Dean's hunger.
Dean had basically jumped his best friend’s bones and they had been interrupted. They didn’t mention it to each other the whole four-hour drive home, maybe it was because their son was somewhere unknown… or maybe not.
Dean pulled away, despite the despair taking root in his heart, “I love you, Cas.” He whispered again, his voice fracturing. He kissed Cas’s forehead tenderly before forcing himself to his feet.
The bunker was quiet, but it was not peaceful. Dean could feel the tension poisoning the air. He didn’t know how else to cope, so he made a beeline for the kitchen. At least there were beers sitting in the fridge.
“Sex? Dean already told me all about it, including the Cartwright Twins,” Jack mentioned innocently unaware of the chaos he’s about to unleash.
“I’m going to check on Jack, he was hurt,” Cas replied, finishing dressing without sliding on his suit jacket or the trench coat. Which is pretty indecent of him to go out practically naked.
“What’s with my clothes?” Dean remarked as he threw back the covers, forcing himself to look away. Cas standing there in his clothes caught Dean’s breath in his throat and sent his heart fluttering… and he didn’t know why.
“So what? killing demons is evil now?” Dean pushed, grabbing the closest shirt and pulling it over his head.
A pit of uneasy filled him. He could have sworn Dean’s eyes were black when they first opened, if only for a single piece of time.
He also wasn’t all that great at co-parenting, despite his caretaking nature. It didn’t help that most of his parenting decisions were second-guessed since he took on the Mark of Cain to defeat Abadon, who was still alive and kicking, but not for lack of trying.
“Heya Sammy,” Dean greeted, a small grin on his face. Sam’s face twisted and switched rapidly through expressions for a long stretch of moments. Honestly, how long does it take for a Winchester to process someone coming back from the dead? Again. Sam should really just be used to this by now, this ain’t his first rodeo, hell it ain’t even his seventh.
Abadon patted Jack’s cheek tenderly, her red nails stark in contrast against his pale skin. “Hello, lover,” she purred, her voice laced with seduction. “What a beautiful son you have. But frankly, I don’t see the resemblance.” She traced a single nail along his cheek, drawing a line of blood. “He doesn’t have your pretty green eyes.”
“I wouldn’t really say that me miraculously coming back is a problem right now.” Dean snapped at his brother.
He took wide strides toward Abadon, his grip tight as ever on the Blade. He could already feel his blade slicing into her.
The thought of Cas watching him through the night sent another tremor through him. It clicked right then and there. The shudders started at his fingers, top of his head, and toes and shot straight to his dick. In that instant, it became unbearable. He couldn't look at Cas another second without having him.
Sam then looked up, alerted by the abuse of the duffle bag. “Uh no. Wherever he is, he’s not using his powers.”
Dean gestured for Cas to stand in front of him, “Nothing new. It’s nice to see you all suited up.” He wrapped the tie around Castiel’s neck, and Cas felt his breath on his face, spearmint toothpaste. “Even though, I kinda dug you in my clothes.”
Cas slid the tan coat over his shoulders. He turned to face the mirror, his tie was crooked. Years on earth and he still struggling to tie a simple tie. It felt wrong not wearing his blue tie, it was like leaving the house without pants.
desire he felt in the motel surged through him. He searched Dean’s angry green eyes, which were blazing like green inferno.
Dean couldn't stop himself from scanning his eyes from Cas's face to his chest and his abdomen, which looked smooth and supple, perfect for biting-- for marking.
Unusual as it was, Dean let Sam drive. He couldn’t reign in his eyes, he couldn’t go more than five seconds without sending checking looks at Cas. They didn’t have time for Dean to worry about hauling ass
But then, he was awake. Dean could feel the fabric of his blanket under his fingertips and he lightly moved to believe it. Everything about the memory had been so real.
The sentence should have been a bucket of ice water but it was the opposite, like stepping into a hot shower after a long day. He ached to unravel in the velvet tones of Cas’ voice- to let it wash over and consume him.
He was confused, but something about this ‘confession’ broke Castiel’s heart. It was true evidence that Dean was hopeless. He had bared his deepest secret because he was going to die and wouldn’t have to face the consequences for his admittance. But fuck, he was going to explain himself, even if Cas had to lay siege Heaven to drag him back to Earth.
His fingers fumbled attempting to do it himself but it was a fruitless mission. He thought about asking Sam for a hand but he didn’t want to bother him while he searched for signs of Jack. The solution was so obvious, Dean would help him without asking any questions. Of course, that was before the confusing incident at the motel.
He suffered a sharp eye from Cas, which was his way of saying ‘watch your language, our son is present.’
“I love you,” Dean whispered before pressing his lips against his angel’s. It wasn’t lust-filled, it wasn’t rushed. He felt nothing but simply bliss as his lips moved against his, their tears mixing on their cheeks. This was goodbye.
“Knowing why he wanted it has nothing to do with how we are gonna get it back,” Dean said, pushing himself up from the table, beer on his mind.
If Dean wasn't using all of his energy not to spring on an unaware Cas, he might have noticed the sincere and warm tone behind his best friend's voice. Instead, he felt the fire continue to rise and he knew that if the angel didn't leave him be, he wouldn't be able to control himself...and he wouldn't, no. Couldn't hurt Castiel.
Dean slammed his fist into the stranger's face with pure force, cracking his jaw out of place. The stranger's blood leaking onto the wooden floor. Dean smirked as his first collided with the man's nose, snapping bone. At the sight of the spurting blood, an inhuman growl escaped Dean's mouth.
“I would have fucking burned your body! This ain’t natural Sammy, I was supposed to stay dead.” Cas squeezed Dean’s hand in another effort to calm him down.
He scissored his fingers, grazing the sweet spot again, only to hear his name again. He curled his fingers again, reveling in the sight of his angel arching off the bed.
Cas could tell that Dean wasn’t thinking either. He was just as lost in the angel as Cas was lost in him.
Dean slid off his jeans along with his boxers and headed toward the door. He flipped the lock with a muted
It took one glance around to understand what he meant. It was his room. His guns lined the tan walls and his desk was a wreck and his duffle overflowing with flannel sat in the corner. But his eyes pulled back to his angel’s piercing blue eyes. They were magnetic.
Dean climbed between his angel’s legs, kissing the sides of his knees as he set them on his shoulders. “Tell me if you want to stop,” he murmured against the skin of his leg.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a demon wearing a black suit rush him, its arms stretching to take the blade. Dean steered to the side, grabbing the collar of its suit, shoving it down on his rising knee. Dean’s other hand shoved the Blade deep into its back.
Dean’s stomach dropped. “Okay…Do you have any leads? I mean where the hell could have the kid went?”
That uncaged anger flows again through Dean. Grinding his teeth, he clenched his free hand. His body was demanding the Blade. “I know that. I’m the once that fucking bled out on the floor, waiting for you guys to come get me!” Dean’s chest would be heaving if he needed to breathe right now. “Only to fucking wake up and find out Jack is dying and you aren’t doing anything about it!”
The name ignited a fire-filled rage inside Dean, originating from the Mark. He could hear the blade calling to him silently, seducing him to pick it up, to coat it in blood.
Cas’s eyes on him like that was enough to take away his ability to speak. His thoughts strayed away from the current topic, his brain zoning in on Castiel’s striking eyes…they were so blue and clear. Dean moved from Cas’s eyes to his lips—even chapped they made his heart pound. Thoughts surrounding his lips gave way for images of what those lips were capable of. Like a piece of film, Dean saw Cas’s lips wrapped around him, unraveling him ruthlessly.
Realization flooded through him as he took in the blood covering Cas. His lip was bloodied and his jaw was purple. The red spread down onto the front of his white shirt. “Why haven’t you healed yourself?” Dean gasped, quickly sitting up. He didn’t feel a single ache.
Dean's voice caught in his throat, instant panic soaring through him. "W-what are you doing?" Dean said shakily.
The look Cas gave Dean was one of pure agony and it made him want to reach out and kiss the pain away.
Abadon was keeping Jack at a secluded barn outside a small obsolete town in Kansas. The only sound was Baby’s purrs as the boys raced to rescue their son.
“I had no choice, you got demon blood on my clothes.” Cas whispered, Dean was close enough he didn’t need to use full volume.
Sam narrowed his eyes, Dean could basically see his thoughts flying through his brain at a million miles a second. “Who was that, Dean?”
Dean whispered something to himself in response. Dean shifted their stance, the back of Cas’s knees pressed against the end of Dean’s bed. Dean’s fingers shoved the trench coat from his body, wrapping his hands around the base of his neck, nibbling hungrily on Cas’s neck. Dean no longer forced him close with the tie, but Cas didn’t move away.
“I’ll be right back, gotta get something to drink,” Dean whispered. He was going to ask him if he wanted anything but he stopped himself. Angels didn’t eat or drink.
“What spell can do what Cain can’t do himself?” Sam asked, his hand resting on his temple. He was exhausted.
Suddenly, they were against the wall. Dean pressed Cas tightly against it. His cock twitched as he heard a little moan come from Cas. A sound he had never heard before, but instantly it was his favorite sound in all of existence.
Dean cleared his throat, afraid that Cas would hear his heart racing. “Didn’t want to—what? Seriously?”
“I don’t know how they took it. I just woke up in the barn. Abbadon wasn’t there but a man was. He these blue eyes but they were different than yours, Castiel. These didn’t make me happy,” Jack looked straight through Dean then, staring directly at Cas. His tired eyes were clouded with fear.
Cas found himself moving to meet Dean’s touch, unable to breathe without it. This was better than any scenario he had thought of, it was more than Cas has imagined. Dean’s touch was greater than he ever thought possible.
