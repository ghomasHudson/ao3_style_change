Sherlock pulls off again, and John whines in a tone he has had no idea he could make until now. He shoots him a smug grin.
But what was falling from the ceiling wasn't just wood. Black figures, hooded beings were jumping from the roof into the flames. More and more and ever more, like a plague that was crawling out of the night sky's womb. They grabbed whoever they could get and slit their throats right open with their teeth. The brown floor was turning red, the dark ceiling bright with fireworks. It was undeniable that they were vampyres. John would recognise their predatory movements, their quick attacks and brutal snatches from even the greatest distance. A cold shudder ran down his back. They were here. In the middle of London.
John smiled at her in a way that he hoped did not come off as pitiful while he was going for compassionate. They both knew she was hiding in humbleness. That she had already observed the injury was remarkable. They were living in a changing age where, in theory, everyone could get the chance to contribute and do something major. But this was not the reality. People like Sarah would never be given that chance. John had no doubt she would have made a great doctor. Somewhere, in another lifetime.
But he spoke over her, loud and clear. "There is no arguing with him. He is the government. In times like these more than ever. There is nothing to be done here. It is over."
„Well,“ that seemed to have bewildered the man, not knowing what to say, and he may have unconsciously taken a step back, „My granddaughter surely is a very vigorous little creature. But imagining her firing off weapons in the field? Oh no. No, no, no. Poor girls are not made for war, my friend, you will certainly agree to that?“
Lestrade and John both looked at him like he had told them the moon was made of cheese. It was not an improbable statement, but it came just as out of nowhere.
Her giggles filled the room again before she took the offered hand. She didn't seem reluctant in the slightest to sit here in her short dress and let John talk and look at her from in between her legs while treating her injured ankle while they were … were they flirting with each other?
Sherlock arches his back when John’s finger brushes over his hole, and he moans, his voice high and raw. The only thing John can do, has to, needs to do, is to press a kiss to his neck. He grabs Sherlock’s hip and presses his aching cock to his bum while he kisses his neck. Rubbing hot flesh against his entrance, kissing his neck. Sherlock is a shaking mess already, and he can hear him sob and moan, but he can’t stop kissing him.
detective. I have worked particularly with him multiple times over the years, and I have solved their cases when the police had repeatedly failed to do so. He owes me a lot of favours, my Doctor."
"In the end," Sherlock raised his voice to interrupt Lestrade but with a sigh the room was calm and he was quiet again. "He saved my life. It was the choice he was given and he made it count. Watching him die in my stead would not be right. But knowing he can find his peace too after a lifetime of tragedy would be... just."
A shot. John jumped out of his skin as a heavy body fell against his back and landed on the ground. He had saved Sherlock before. Now Sherlock had saved him.
"Stamford, Mike Stamford."
“John. John, oh god, I need to-”
"Go, go, go!"
She is completely different. She is different from everyone else he has ever seen John date, and she is so smart and kind, caring and funny, short and shining bright, and she is dark, but on a whole different level. On a level John likes. In short, she is not like Sherlock at all.
- yes, he remembers why.
, pounding sound, and if this was not the most beautiful thing he had ever heard! A little spirited crow with white wings was flying around his head. It opened its beaker and out came the sound of life. The cut in Sherlock's skull closed itself, and John still marvelled at the crow flying around him in circles until it rushed right into the red glow. It breathed the life back into Sherlock from the inside out, lifting him inches from the ground before he fell back down. His eyes snapped open and he breathed it all into his lungs like a man saved from drowning. His limbs stretched out, desperately reaching for something, but John was here, he was here for him.
Sherlock turned his head to look him in the eye. A soft breeze shoving the thin layer of clouds beneath the ship like waves on top of the ocean.
In the short amount of time that it took John to blink the lady had sprinted towards them, and was now wrapping her arms around Sherlock's neck with such force that they almost fell over.
"No, Anderson, I didn't know." Even Lestrade sounded exhausted.
His whole body glowed in the dark. John pressed his ear to Sherlock's chest and waited, hoped, until …
"Shut up," John told him. He probably had, of all of them, the least rational reason to be mad at him right now. Irrationally enough, he still was. "You thought I couldn't manage this on my own, didn't you?"
"Live with the consequences of our actions, you mean?" Sherlock sat down on his own chair. He still enjoyed how the fire crackled in his ear and warmed his body. You only know what to treasure once you have lost is, is that not so?
why they are here. Right now. Together.
Sherlock Holmes, and he was perfect.
"Eurus," Sherlock corrected.
Sherlock knew it, too. He stood up in defence even before the dark mistress was stepping out of the shadows. Her shoes stretching over her knees and black trousers were leathern as the corset over her white frill blouse. Her hair was neatly put up and her knowing smile finally shone red again.
“Maybe tomorrow.”
Just as Sherlock's breaks and he can't bring himself to care about his loss of control at all as he answers, "Please, John. Please."
At that, Mycroft's posture straightened. Duty called, blocking out any kind of sentiment he might feel. "Alright, this has been a lovely family reunion. If we could turn back to the important means of my visit, that would be very much preferable."
"Nor did I ever lose my trust in
Alright. Maybe his imagination went a bit wild there. Compared to all of his ideas, the way it really went down was almost a little disappointing. But if everything was to become an adventure, how would you know one when you saw it?
"Did it?" John asked with a voice so sharp it made Sherlock look up from under long lashes.
As he walked out of the bedroom and through the hallway, he could already make out Sherlock's form sitting on the kitchen table. Bent over a rust-brown microscope. It was the kind of instrument he had otherwise only seen tinkerer's from his former unit use. Once he had stepped into the light, Sherlock immediately looked up and turned his head. He almost jumped up eagerly, making one or two utensils fall off the table from the quick movement. John blinked away the last bit of sleep in his eyes and shot a confused gaze at him when he came towards him and stopped right before he reached the hallway in which John was standing.
“Don’t ever risk your own life like that again,” he warns him, but warns him softly.
"What can I do for you then?"
John nodded. "I fear you just missed him."
"Yours," Sherlock jokes, but it's hard for him to hide a grin at this point. "Clearly yours."
Sherlock only responds with a wave of his hand, as if it was nothing, but John can't help but miss the faintest blush around those high cheekbones.
Dizzy and with a sharp pain buzzing through the back of his head, he feels weightless when John lifts one of his legs, slowly running his hand over the underside of his thigh, fingers through thin hairs and over hard muscle, and Sherlock’s natural reaction is to wrap his leg around John’s middle and hold on tight, so tight. His trousers are hanging from the end of his foot like one last resort before they fall off and to the floor. The pain wears off, and suddenly Sherlock thinks he can feel
"Listen, young man," she said in the warning tone of a concerned mother, placing the tray on top of the pile of books on the kitchen table. John took a look outside. How was it that this day had passed by so quickly?
"Baker Street was finally a place I felt content enough coming back to. From then on, the work gave me enough of a distraction to keep my mind at bay, additionally granting me the satisfaction of lowering the number of England's lunatics. Due to my obvious advantages over the police department, my help to them soon provided me with a reputation and I became the world's only consulting detective.
Behind him there was a child, hardly older than fourteen, that almost stumbled over his bag when she got out. She didn't seem to mind as she ran towards a couple, that could only be her parents, with excitement and joy written all over her features and hugged them tightly. An elderly man stepped out after her, smiling warmly as he spoke.
The two horses were snorting and pawing the ground impatiently. The excitement rushed back into John with a force that felt dizzying.
"It's a blood sample," Sherlock murmured and John almost jumped at the sudden closeness of these lips to his neck and the voice in his ear.
"They are-" Mycroft began but was interrupted by a heavy shake that made everyone’s legs wobbly before it stabilised again.
"Yeah, about that," John started. He had no idea how much time had passed already. Irene Adler could be wondering where he had gone this very moment, get suspicious and look for him. To whatever compromise the two of them would come, it had to be made quickly. "What is it about you now? What happened?"
While John started to panic, Sherlock turned towards him, trying to get him back to him, but the excitement in his expression was just a tad disturbing. "You have to go back!"
Hesitantly, he stepped into the room all by himself. For a second, he considered just going for it and run to get out of this place as fast as he could. It would not work, obviously. Also, there was a little, and definitely mad, part in him that was way too curious about the person awaiting him on the other side of that huge mahogany desk. The room had high ceilings with high bookshelves. There were only a few selected items on the desk itself, neatly placed. One of them being a glass decanter with a gold brown liquor in it. Scotch, most likely.
"Your suggestion, Mr Holmes," Irene began, slowly walking around him, "is to attack. I say doing so is a bad idea. I say … We wait. Ah!" she raised a finger between them to shut him up before he could object, "Hear me out. There is already a battle going on, and it is a battle between James Moriarty and his sister. Use that to your advantage! Wait to see who wins, who loses. Her vampyres or his army of cyborg corpses. Let them fight each other and strike when the winner is weakest."
"You must be the miraculous doctor then, no? Doctor Watson? Mary told me everything."
very idea was so staggering and ludicrous to him that he just couldn't buy it. So instead of explaining all of this, he simply said, "And, as you can see, I am employed already."
Closing his eyes, giving up prolonging the madness that should be his last day on this earth, he could hear one last cry. It was different, so different, and his eyes snapped open when he knew.
"Only Hooper?" Anderson threw in with a frown. "You know I have been trained to do that sort of thing, right?"
"For not respecting marked territory, John!" He abruptly stands up from his chair, like the restless genius with the long legs that he is, and turns his back to him to first walk up and down, then stop by the window frame.
"I am seeing someone." Sherlock frowned at him, and the sad smile became a grin that made John's heart skip a beat.
The door broke open with a smack and surely damaged the wall it had crashed against. The noise was so loud that Irene spun around. Fury was written all over her face. Her appearance was one big chaos that caused a thousand headaches and it felt like the very space she was moving in was now broken. Two arms, eight arms, monstrous, woman again. The white and blue in her eyes got replaced by round black pairs, between her red lips grew ugly fangs, and back and forth and back forth again, again, again.
His chuckling vibrates against his neck and Sherlock lets out the softest gasp.
John begins to quietly whisper into his ear, as one of his hands slips downwards again, rests on his hip. "As much as I like this ..." He gently bites Sherlock's earlobe, who can't help the gasping and leaning in further. "... which is a lot ..." He starts kissing the skin behind his ear, holding him in place with his grip now at the back of his neck.
He, not having expected to find that pair of eyes on him so suddenly and with such precision, couldn't think quickly enough to give an answer, and instead just started with, "I-"
"Anderson," Sherlock continued. Anderson gave a sharp nod.
. It was so hard, yes, so very hard to see without a heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, but this is clearly not working. She is fu-" John bites his tongue, suddenly very aware that there is a toddler on his lap. "-
Molly pressed her lips together so that she would keep her mouth shut at this. Instead she just said, "Found him."
"John," he says again, and John can't believe he is letting him do this.
, because Sherlock doesn't believe in wishes that come true, and even if he did, what would he want to have from some sort of falling star, high up on the horizon? John doesn't have an answer, and that unsettles him, so he tries to hide himself behind a thick brick wall out of sarcasm. This is one of Sherlock's techniques, actually.
John's hands know no mercy, travel all the way below his thin shirt, rubbing against his hardening nipples and leaving Sherlock to his helpless, tiny moans. His heart skips several beats of fear when all he can feel all of a sudden are not John's hands anymore but John's absence, and he feels alone, cold and the regretful ache of wanting.
For a moment now, John is motionless before he blows out a shuddering exhale. "Oh God, yes."
John's smile after this is honest and a little sad. He clearly tries to overplay the obvious anxiety that makes his Adam's apple bob as he swallows with amusement. "Well... I was hoping," he is gesturing between the two of them, "...you know?"
you, as you call it. I can't force you to do anything, of course."
John huffed a laugh. "Of course you did."
Just as he had reached the last of seventeen stairs, the music slowly died out on a single note, ending it beautifully. He wasn't sure if he should knock. He did it anyway, and then pressed the door open with caution, opening for his eyes to take in the large living space. The room was illuminated by two high windows, almost touching floor and ceiling both, and from one of them he saw him retreating, putting the violin down on one of the two armchairs that stood in front of an unlit fireplace like old companions. There was a sofa on the other side of the wall, and a small table in front on which a chaotic pile of various newspapers and open letters had been created. A while ago, too, it seemed, for there was already a fine layer of dust on top.
"Yes, that's why. He's always too generous, it wasn't all that special."
John nodded.
“You’re an idiot.”
Sherlock kissed John's brow that is surrounded by a deep wrinkle, and he felt the wrinkle smoothing out under his lips.
"There is a weakness with him, however. Moriarty's plan and his … sluggishness as a scientist, if you will, has its own price. It is a requirement to everything he is and needs, and thus, something we can use to prevent this evil plot from happening."
As John looked up, Sherlock had leant in closer towards him over the table, chin resting on his intertwined hands and his elbows braced on the tablecloth.
"Why, you askin' me, boy?"
He took a really big gulp that made John wonder how he didn't burn his tongue.
He is startled by the sensation of cum hitting the back of his throat and pulls back instinctively, the other half of it squirting across his cheek. He runs his finger through it, then realises John is watching him, sweat glistening on his forehead and neck, drying around blond chest hair, and all he can think is, "This man had me and I had him," and look at him in wonder. He doesn't avert his gaze as he takes his finger into his mouth to lick John's cum off it.
With that, he left the room. The water turned back into air again, and everyone took a deep breath.
Sherlock was leaning over the table, an intensity in his eyes that John had not yet gotten used to, maybe never would. "Look at me."
in front of him, holding in both his hands a bouquet of flowers. (Has he had that with him the whole time? He hasn't noticed.) It's a bunch of pink belladonnas. He knows this because these are the flowers he used to buy to put them down on top of the gravestone with his name on it. Sometimes he'd go for yellow, sometimes blue, but mostly … pink. The colour brought back memories of better times.
"Ehm." John cleared his throat again. "So Baker Street?"
That was what he thought about almost always whenever he slowly drifted off to sleep again. As slumber pressed him against the cold, hard layer that separated him from the storm outside.
“A boat chase, Sherlock?!”
Both he and Kate let their eyes roam appreciatively over her imposing frame. From the chocolate brown hair, which was pinned up into a loose, wavy braid, and a few broad curls that were crowning her forehead, to steel blue eyes and red lips, to the embroidered green dressing gown that covered her arms, her navel, her breasts, but not a lot of skin in between, down to the black high-waist girdle, attached to stockings with straps on them, flattering the pair of long legs. And she knew. She was perfectly aware of what she was owning and how she was using it.
"It is the place where Moriarty keeps everything. Rather a masterpiece, I am sad to say."
Sherlock had drifted off there a little and John tried to bring him back by putting a hand to his arm. The detective stopped, blinking down rapidly as if he was only seeing him for the first time and asked himself what this stranger was doing in his kitchen. John stood up from the chair, but Sherlock's body was so close that there wasn't much space left between him and the table. By getting up he almost knocked over the open jar with the maggots. Fortunately, he did not.
John assumed he had approximately forty seconds to straighten his clothes and adjust his tie. When the door to his office opened again, Sarah showed in a blonde lady with a limp before bowing her head and closing the door behind her. The woman took off her black, round hat. The hair underneath was unconventionally short and almost strikingly more yellow than it was blonde, and not one of her curls looked out of place. For an injured woman she carried an appearance of uncommonly high self-esteem, and John was instantly fascinated by her.
It all feels like a competition to him, between his mind and his heart (it isn't quite impossible that his heart could have slid down a few inches), but he is not even interested in winning, because he cannot lose. He has it under control to be completely out of control and for a glorious second he can consciously throw himself into it, and he doesn't manage to pull himself back after doing so.
"Hmmh, give me a moment."
” His hand presses even harder against his own mouth, and he bites his bottom lip until it hurts. He might be bleeding.
He didn't know what he was begging for, and didn't care about how desperate he could sound when he begged, but for some wondrous reason John seemed to know exactly what he needed. He chuckled into the crook of his neck and
"No," Sherlock answers softly. "It's quite itchy, actually." They both laugh. And my God, laughing together … The last time feels so long ago, so far away. This here will keep them warm.
aware of that.
Knowing the deal this time, John took Sherlock's arm in his and squeezed. "I'm going for Moran."
him. When you talk about my brother, you are talking about him in the present tense. Interesting. Almost as if you didn't believe that he should be dead."
"You were told his whole family died in a terrible accident. Well, they did die. But it was no accident. It was a war. A war outside these walls. You've seen it too, haven't you, Doctor?"
Eurus smiled happily. She started running, running towards them, shooting left and right without looking. "The detective belongs to me, brother. You have to go!"
He kisses his inner thighs again, little kisses, little pecks that happen so quickly that they feel ghostly. John's lips travel up and down, and each time he reaches the place where the back of his thigh conflates into that plumb arse cheek of his, he travels a little bit higher. Closer to the spot behind his balls. Where he wants him. Only one of the places where he wants him.
John looked at one of the books. The page in front of him showed a human body, as he knew it, but instead of the bones or the muscles, there was the endless flow of energy, visualised through every cell and every limb.
All the blood is running south, and as he wraps his arms around John’s neck, he isn’t quite sure how to feel, much less what he is doing.
In the middle of the room, on a beige sofa with curved legs, lay a woman, dressed in hardly more than quite a translucent green dressing gown. She looked like she was either in agony or just extremely bored. When the woman, who could only be Ms Adler, looked up and made out her housemaid, her eyes seemed to instantly brighten.
The creature shifted from where it still stood, in the dark. Its head seemed to move, which caused an unnatural snapping that settled beneath John's ribs. The sound of something screeching against the stones played the vertebrae of his spine, and he clenched his teeth in resistance against the frightening, the unknown.
that I am not doing this anymore. If you know anything about where he is or what he is doing, pray, tell me, and please tell me if he is still in one bit."
"I … know," the inspector sighed. "Always about the cases, that madman. Even beyond the grave, it seems. I knew it would get him killed one day. I am very sorry, but there's really no way I can give any police document to you. And now, with Holmes dead..."
"I have no idea where to get to Moriarty's hiding place!" The panic started to come for John. If they did not act soon, Sherlock would not make it.
"'Ey, I've as much a right to be 'ere as you do, ser!" The man with the uncombed hair replied sorely.
. But as he thrusts, harder,
"But Holmes, that's- that's almost impossible to plan in two days, let alone explain to the Chief!"
Sherlock rolled his eyes but nodded. Many things had ceased to make sense these days, so why shouldn't his language?
Sherlock feels so dramatic right now, he wants to peel off all his skin and leave his human shell, it's all too heavy. Let him die.
Again, he is drawn to the falling stars, another one, another one, and every time his heart misses a beat. The stars are falling, is all he can think of, and admire it all over again. After a while, he really cannot help himself anymore. He has to ask.
s, as he comes, the one thing on his lips is
Oh fuck, hearing those two words spoken out loud and together and out of
He is now touching himself, finally allowing himself the sweet bliss, but he also can't stop wanting to prolong and swim in this sensation forever. All those impressions right in front of him make it impossible to tell apart hallucination and reality. He is rubbing the rinsing shampoo all over his body now, over his neck, his chest, and whimpers as his fingers find an already hard pair of nipples. His legs only tremble some more, and it would be very unfortunate to trip now, but he cannot stop sliding his hands over the fine hairs of his abdomen, the darker growing hairs along his thighs, and finally,
"James is a bastard, born from the womb of a female that fell in love with a human. She was impregnated before he turned, but they had hope that the baby could live regardless. He did live. And his parents, clueless yet of what he was, gave the little boy a sister."
John frowned in surprise. "Fragile is not exactly a term that has come up when I think of you, to be quite honest."
"Shhh," he soothes him, rubbing slow circles over his back.
The Chief was blinking in confusion as though he had just woken up from a deep dream, not knowing where he was or why.
"Hmmh!" The inspector had probably tried to give him a revealing expression of
John blinked a few times and then looked away in mild embarrassment. That woman could see right through him. But she gave him another smile, softer this time, and sighed.
John sits back on his heels and lifts Sherlock up by the hips. With one smooth thrust he is buried inside of him from tip to shaft, balls deep. Overwhelmingly perfect. His mouth is hanging wide open and his eyes are closed in concentrating.
John has a hard time finding a response to this that doesn’t only consist of loose vowels. It takes him a good minute, but Sherlock is oddly patient with him.
He had probably been in the living room all night (playing the violin?) and made his plans. Probably grateful for some hours alone. He did not seem to be around people a lot. Or, perhaps, all this time he had been forced to suffer practically imprisoned needed to be made up for by some company. Now company was a room apart, sitting in his bed that felt like sleeping on clouds compared to John's own sloppy mattress. The thick blanket had kept him cosy and warm, and the silk linen was soft on his skin. He had fallen asleep within seconds. With the covers now slipping down and pooling in his lap, his torso was left bare and cold. He was only wearing his long white knickers and a dark red dressing gown of Sherlock’s. There was a very special smell to it that was not unpleasant at all.
"I did warn you," he murmurs low and playfully, coming even closer.
John pursed his lips, taking a sip of his tea and regretting it immediately when his tongue felt numb from the hot liquid.
She looked surprised to see him. "Oh, Dr Watson. I didn't know you were still here. Are you staying the night?"
"Those things will kill you, Geoff."
"Are you really going to leave just like this?"
"Moriarty never caused too much damage, and there was no need for fuelling Sherlock's obsession with him further. I let him play his little games, but I do not interfere."
The horses brought the hansom to a halt merely ten minutes later. As soon as John hopped off, he found himself inside a moving crowd on the streets of a busy London night. Ladies in expensive dresses and gentlemen in top hats were trying to get passed him. Everyone had somewhere to be, everyone was trying to get somewhere during the last hours this day had to offer. And what about John? He looked up to a sign above his head.
"Why would Sherlock not tell me about the two of you cooperating?" John wondered aloud.
"Yes," John answered, slightly confused. "I thought that was established. Why would I be here otherwise?"
John lets out an equal moan of approval and his thrusts grow faster and harder. Sherlock struggles to roll his hips in tune with those thrusts, a flame rising and flickering, telling him that he is closer, closer,
He didn't really understand what was happening around him as soon as John's fingers touched his neck and disappeared in the dark curls. Sherlock shivered (so sensitive) and his legs threatened to give in for a second, so he slid deeper down the door, more of John's height now. He was pulling his hair a little, and the sweet pain immediately dissolved into arousal that went straight to his cock.
Sherlock swallows. It’s worse than he thought. He cannot deny that he likes John when he is on the right side of angry, but this is probably the wrong side and he is also being yelled at.
They said no more. John left him with this, feeling brave, feeling daring, young again. Feeling dangerous at having done this, given this little intimate touch to another man so openly, for the world to see. This time, he had been the one to make the impressive exit, to leave the magnificent man, who had stunned him and seen him gaping and speechless so many times, unable to find the words. John walked down the street while biting his lips that formed the grin of a fool with a racing heart, and at the same time he fled. Fled before he could have said more, done more, exposed more. He was already far too involved.
Sherlock's hand stroke over John's own until he could finally remember how to breathe. His next breath felt like it filled a new pair of lungs. Sherlock had asked him if he smoked, but this, right here, was a drug filling his nostrils. They both watched as John's hand disappeared in Sherlock's tailcoat, holding onto his waist tightly, strongly. Sherlock put his own hand to John's shoulder, and their gazes rose in sync. John's was pinned to the long, marble-white neck in front of him for one second, two seconds, and then ... The blue sea met the blue sky.
John shook his head. "Well, now I'm the wolf." He took the other mask from Sherlock and put it on. It smelled a bit like pine trees and distinctly like a certain detective's coat. "Now wear the damn mask."
On those days he has little use for Sherlock in their bedroom. (Well, to be fair, there are quite a lot of things with which Sherlock could be useful to him there,
"I simply do. He was spying on us. Back in there. I saw that crow flying through the museum, so I turned my head and then I heard him. He was talking to somebody. Watching you."
John lets out another laugh which only earns him a pair of grey, narrowing eyes boring into him. "His idiocy? Really? Why was he an idiot?"
. People started screaming and panicking, shoving each other around for air.
After a good minute, the darkness stopped being just black. It became stone and cobwebs and ... bars. He was lying in a cell. They had put him in a cell! No windows. Just one wall made of rusty bars. John sat up on his knees and tried to inspect them in the dim light. They were rough, probably quite old. Maybe with a kick in the right spot they would break?
"Steam grenades?"
, it’s so impossible to even imagine giving you away again. But I can’t stop it."
, he wanted to add and had to think of Sherlock. (Had he ever stopped thinking of Sherlock?)
John understood. He really did. With a chest-tightening, fist-clenching clarity he understood how he felt. The man had died, for God's sake! He had died, and the body in which he now walked this earth wasn't his own. This couldn't possibly do any good for a confused soul, nor the fragile essence it was made of. Dying must have felt like a failure for Sherlock. Even if he did not admit it, even if he kept on pretending it was only the transport formed by flesh and bones that he had lost and that he was still the same ... Death changed people.
It’s a cat video. John snorts.
"What are you seeing, love?" He put his head on Sherlock's shoulder and tried to see through his eyes. What would Sherlock see when he looked down at Baker Street? A hansom driving by, a grey and a black horse, pedestrians, a man walking his dog ...
Sherlock picked his violin up and out of its case, caressing it with gentle fingers. He smiled at him from over his shoulder.
With a weak voice and all the anger washed from him, Anderson spoke again. "You never told us what happened to you when you were gone."
He looked up and there she stood. A woman, tight skirt, white ruffle shirt and chequered waistcoat. Her brown hair was pulled upwards and secured by a little beige hat. She was eyeing John from head to toe, not blinking once. Then she lifted her arm and spoke into her golden cufflink.
Sherlock eyed him sharply from his standing position, looking down on him. "There's something different about you," he mumbled, but more to himself.
"Two days?!"
"Exactly. You are you. You're John Watson. You’re the bravest and wisest and kindest human being I have ever met. It was always going to be you." He closed his eyes, ready. "Do it gently."
over his yet untouched erection. It makes his pulse speed up and he can feel it jumping with anticipation underneath his touch.
"I have to say you are far from how I imagined you, based on Mrs Hudson's description," he mumbled under his breath.
"Yeah, thought so."
As far as he remembered the plan was to get in touch as soon as something seemed off or noteworthy. A spontaneous ball at The Prof was definitely both of those things. How could she not think so?
But John was desperate. To be working again was in no way a recipe for being fine. He was still lonely, he was still empty. And my God, was he
John’s mouth fell shut. Sherlock looked back at him in anticipation, and his mouth did something that could be a sign of nervousness. But this was Sherlock Holmes! Why would he be nervous about asking John if he would like to … Wait, had he really asked him if he would like to have dinner with him?
His mouth closed again, and a smile tucked on the corner of his mouth.
"I learned that he was just as fascinated by the thought of overcoming death as I was. It can leave marks as fatal as this, losing someone. It can lead to a road of madness and obsession. But I refused to acknowledge those signs for the sake of what we were working towards. This changed after Victor. Victor Trevor and I knew each other for quite some time already. You could say he was the only friend I had during my years in university. I trusted him. So I decided to let him in on our work. If only I had known that I would seal his fate that day.
"He's that kind of unpredictable. A changeable force to reckon with. Raise your arm."
They clearly tried to distract themselves from the threat that lay ahead of them. Their conversation headed in very different directions, from John's reasoning for joining the knighthood and later the Order to Sherlock's first engagement with science, how he had become interested in the matters of chemistry and in how far this had proven to be a great advantage for his detective work. They also drifted into a few darker corners sometimes. How it had felt for John to make his first kill and how it was even scarier when it became easier. Sherlock tried to understand this better by comparing it to how deducing a crime scene had become more and more of a routine to him.
“Sorry?”
James Moriarty, and if you took a moment to use whatever there is between your ears, you might consider
. If it was meant to be a disguise, it wasn't a really good one. But he would have no reason at all to hide. Everyone else was already hiding. He was just out here, hunting.
"Apparently you haven’t because if you look at the number of thumb-ups-" Sherlock leans over to scroll down on the touchpad. "There, twelve thousand positive to one thousand negative. Are you saying twelve thousand people are just wrong, John?"
Sherlock held her gaze with difficulty. But he held it.
, he thought.
"No. Eventually, I was able to escape before his vicious fist closed around me entirely. I have a few contacts in the underground ... That's when I met Bill Wiggins. It should be no secret that he was an addict back then, and I, with my history, followed shortly. Once more, the cocaine spared me the memories."
"Yes."
One, two, three. One, two, three, and Sherlock twirled around himself again and put his hand back to John's shoulder. He couldn't help but think that his movements were strangely feminine, and strangely at that because, at the same time, they weren't at all. He was the gracile element in a thunderstorm, not defined by anything at all, but uniting those two proclaimed opposites in the hard lines of masculinity and the wave-like forms in which he danced almost shyly, if you took a closer look. John understood, in a sort of epiphany, and as the music tumbled higher and faster in pace, that the reason why he felt like his love had never belonged to either men or women in isolation was because he loved what he loved, had always done so. Had always wanted who he wanted. It could really be so simple. Yet, even though he had known this for a long time now, it was Sherlock Holmes, the genius caught in a mechanic body, who made it so blatantly clear to him, just by the way he danced.
To feel the core of John's very arousal and of everything he is able to do to him, is allowed to, is meant to, pressed to him reawakens a craving that has been repressed within him since he has first noticed the way John walks
"I think that there are no good battles and there is no good way of fighting. But I think there are good people. You...
"Funny." Sherlock did not sound amused.
John, looking down at him with glassy blue eyes, face flushed, mouth slightly open, looks down at the large erection in front of him, all doubts leave him. He holds his cock up by its shaft, never breaking eye contact, and takes it into his mouth in one single move, as far in as he can.
from the police with you?" The way he said
John held himself back from asking how he would know, but then remembered who he was talking to. He would find his way to let him know, of this he was certain. He couldn't even say goodbye before Sherlock had crossed the street and was wrapped in this odd gleam of shadows and mystery again that John was unable to take his eyes off. He looked after him with what could only be a silly little smile on his lips, and Sherlock's coat flapped dramatically in the wind as he disappeared around the corner. Oh, he knew he was looking after him. He must have. He was trying to impress.
"I think he counts on a big surprise. Watch your step."
John was watching him. How his fist closed over his mouth like he wanted to conceal a part of himself that did not know the answer. His curls dark in the grey light outside, his pale skin stretching over the carved edges of his cheekbones. He was beautiful. He was a cyborg. The answer to the question of eternal youth. It scared him so much that even his well adjusted mask could not hide it.
"Of course?" The seemingly-not-man looked truly confused for the first time during their encounter.
"What did he tell you?"
"Oh? Ah, right, you have not been in the city for some years, wasn't that so? Yes, yes, Mary might have mentioned that when we've just met in passing."
. John told him so that they both knew.
Sherlock looked at him, almost offended by John's apparent stupidity. "I lived in a basement for weeks on end. When should I have had the time to study the blueprints of that bloody mansion?"
He was running. In between trees, couldn't see anything, darkness, fire in the distance. Then, on the battlefield, men were shouting – his men! Loud noises of firing weapons drilled into his skull, and his head, it hurt, it
On cat's feet, he made his way to the door frame, stretching out his hand to reach the handle.
John checked his watch again, for what must have been the tenth time in the last three minutes. Three quarters past seven. An ugly kind of uneasiness grew around his heart and made it vulnerable. Had he forgotten about him? It seemed just like a thing Sherlock would do. He had said there was something he had to do first. Perhaps he was so preoccupied in that matter that dinner suddenly seemed like the most unimportant thing in the world to him.
"Get up, Doctor, we are going to get Lestrade on this. He will initiate a meeting with the team as soon as possible."
Sherlock had turned around again, hands behind his back. "Goodnight, Doctor.
John felt
all day long.”
He felt a warm touch and saw that Sherlock let his hand slide into John's own.
"You will make it work."
John lets his arms fall down on the armrests of his chair, sounding exhausted. "Well, yeah, I sorta realised that this is not how it’s supposed to look like, Sherlock, I have eyes!"
Seconds after, John was heading through the big doors. Alone.
"Oh, don't let your face paint such sourness, Doctor. I will admit I haven't fully understood either how I can possibly be alive at this point. You may have noticed my surprise at what I could do with this new form of transport. What I can still learn, what I can
"I think what happened is that witnessing people around you losing has made you fearful of owning anything yourself."
"What?" He asks, a bit surprised at hearing his own voice so quiet and raspy, and that he is hearing it at all. John has said something to him, hasn't he? His lips have definitely moved, but Sherlock couldn't understand a single word he should have said.
"So since when can you do that?" John asked surprisingly calmly, now that he'd seen the trick before.
His whole body suddenly stills, though, as he hears someone whisper into his very skin, being so close that Sherlock could have sworn that it's coming right from the inside of his head. Which it does. He does. John's smooth voice is talking to him, soothing him, and at the same time it lets lust grow into longing. He misses him. He misses John like air, because he still thinks he can't get enough of it into his lungs, and even though his mind is clouded he still feels his absence.
Excitement let the sphere in John's mind glow. It glowed so brightly that he felt nervous and excited, to the point where it was almost overwhelming, when in reality he was just sitting on the edge of his bed in the dark. Not a candle was lit, but he knew what outfit he was going to pick.
Watson."
He was held down, he was caught. The only thing saving him from blood soaked fangs was the gun that both he and the creature gripped on both ends, playing the game of willpower. Willpower wouldn't save him this time, he knew,
John bit the insides of his mouth to keep his anger to a minimum. He really did not want to interact with this man. But so far, he was his only chance.
The Chief Inspector was already waiting for them at Scotland Yard.
He took another long drag from his pipe and his fingers curled around its round belly. His movements looked almost sensual, almost too intimate to be looked at. He closed his eyes for mere seconds as if he was planning to lose himself in the nicotine, but he never seemed quite satisfied. Another one of his habits that he couldn't unlearn. It made him human. Where did the smothered tobacco go if it couldn't fly into organic lungs? After he blew out the next cloud of silver smoke, he held it out to John in question.
John shook his head in a desperate laugh. "Now listen to you. The Sherlock Holmes that I know would never even consider agreeing with Anderson."
…John teases him relentlessly, just wants to hear him moan louder, wants his legs to tremble harder, Sherlock knows this, but he can’t stop giving him just that. They’ve done this before, lots of times, but this time it’s different. John’s hands wander up and down his hot thighs, all the blood in his body heads south and his untouched cock must be burning from it. It’s throbbing on top of his belly, and his breathing is shallow and fast, causing the head to rub against skin. The sensation is not nearly enough, and he lets out a long-suffering groan that ends on a note so high that his voice almost breaks. As John starts kissing the skin of his inner thigh, his eyes fly open from the sweetness of it, the huge wave of arousal, the
"You're his brother." Mrs Hudson had once mentioned it to him, but never Sherlock himself.
"Let me show you to way to my chambers," Moriarty screeched. Suddenly, everyone finally noticed the company.
"Formerly," she said. "A long time ago."
It was another cloudy afternoon on which the good Mrs Hudson, bless her soul, had already lit the fireplace when Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson returned to Baker Street. They were just coming from the Criterion; a little catchup brunch with the Adlers, as they had grown into doing from time to time.
“Hmh?”
Now he was once again in nearly complete darkness, except for the dim light of a little lamp, and he was feeling the beginnings of a headache creeping between his temples. Anthea was reading a book in a foreign language with one hand and held out a bottle of water for John with the other. John tossed down half of it in one big gulp, starting to feel feeling more alive. He tried to focus on that, the little, positive things, and tried to blend out the worry and anger nagging on the back of his head. Anger at being toyed with and thrown around like cats do with mice. Worry at the thought of Sherlock Holmes. The Woman had said he would be fine. Could he believe even one word she had said?
– up to the flexing muscles of his upper arms, and there, on the left shoulder – crushed skin, marked by the wound that has brought him into his life. It raked around his skin as far as it would come, creating the form of something reminding him of a star. Sherlock could only describe it as beautiful.
At this, Sherlock huffed a laugh too, but there was no humour in it. "The Sherlock Holmes you know … You still believe that to be true."
Whatever he has been about to say next, do next, think next, the world stops for a moment as soon as he can't feel the warmth of John's cheek against his body anymore. He dares to look down, and then everything around him melts.
"Why?" he asked. "Why help him? The man who tried to kill us all. Who succeeded in killing
Sherlock's hands were so hesitant but he could not stop touching John. Touching his cheeks and running fingers through his hair and pulling back again. Like a child seeing everything for the very first time.
The machine? He wasn't moving like a machine, not talking like one. The copy of a dead man? But dead men usually stay dead, did they not? Did it matter now? Did it matter if John was still impressed, still feeling himself being pulled in, wanting more? He was so intrigued, he was not even surprised by it. Only the day before he had let himself be persuaded by a female stranger to get a job interview, and now his potential future employer was said to be a criminal and a murderer.
Looking ahead, the buildings beneath were already throwing large shadows that turned alleys into dangerous places. He could see the House of Parliament from here, the Clock Tower and farther in the distance lay Buckingham Palace. He had looked in that direction several times. The place Sholto had died. If not for their victory, then what the hell had it all been for?
"Here you are."
. And it was fine, it was always so much more than fine,
"Preparations?"
John felt sick. But, fortunately, someone interrupted. The room went silent and the air felt colder, some of their vividness taken out of it, and instinctively John took a deep breath. The steps were heavy and clattering on the old floorboards. Everyone turned around.
He doesn't yet dare to think about what happened. (The rumble of Sherlock's voice against him as he was pressed against his chest, his wet cheeks covered by his own trembling hand, the slow rubs of comfort over his arm, his neck.) It's still too soon, too fresh. Even though it isn't too soon at all, but rather too late,
"What happened?"
"She always comes back one way or another," Sherlock said between pulls. "Which way was it this time?"
She pressed her teeth together and tried not to remember too vividly. "As a matter of fact, I have. What you left of him."
"Mycroft finally located me. He dragged me out. Forced the drug addiction out of me. And brought me to you."
Sherlock was falling, too. He was just above him, facing him, his back turned towards the clouded sky. His eye now grey like the sky, but John couldn't see. Sherlock was reaching for him, for his outstretched arms. John snapped his eyes open when something was grabbing him. Touching him. Sherlock's hands tightened around his shoulders, and within a half-second he had flipped them over in the air and the crash came in a heartbeat.
He can just barely believe what his eyes are trying to make him understand, he cannot face it, and yet he wants to never look down again. He is feeling so incredibly small.
"You still own a gun?"
"But you..." John was a little lost for words, giving him a humourless half-smile, "you cannot create life without life. How could there be alternatives?"
A silly smile steals onto his face. "Thank you. You, too."
"A colleague! How would Holmes get himself a colleague?"
The world kept spinning around. John tried to keep himself steady enough to finally gain back some focus, and when his glassy eyes stopped rolling back into his head, they focused on the figure that had crashed through the door.
right to the second he sees Mary smiling at John, and the pain would come at him in an instant as he put the memory pieces back together.
"So what was your plan, genius?"
"Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out what he needs the hearts for. This is why we need to find mine. Even if it could be beating in someone else's chest."
John looked down. "I know." His thumbs were stroking over the back of Sherlock's hands and then he pulled a little, standing on the tip of his toes. And just like that, they met in the middle, kissing in their open living room. They could get arrested for loving like this. It would not matter that they had saved a whole damned city. John pushed the bad thoughts away and pushed harder against Sherlock, pulling away and kissing him again. When they parted, their foreheads fell gently against each other, touching.
John knew what he was going to fight for. He would not stand still and silent. Sherlock became heavier and heavier to bear as he grew weaker.
"Turtle formation!"
"I didn't. Never with a clear head, at least. Sleeping always means giving up control over myself. I used to only do so when I decided to do it actively. When I wasn't on a case, I worked on something else. Like tinkering. But that... that's not really important."
"You never mentioned your brother," he replied after he had caught up.
"Oh, I like that look on you." But he, too, was too tired to keep up the facades. He shrugged. "I thought one day I might change it to your name."
John’s hand presses against his mouth to hold himself back from shouting out his name. If he did this, all would be over. Greg would personally ensure their arrest and they would rot in separate prison cells for the rest of their days.
"Yes," she whispered hoarsely, eyes out of focus. "Yes. Please, if you would follow me, Dr Watson."
What followed was probably a secret knocking code (not morse, he noted) and then the door opened.
A good reason. Always.
"Hmh?" He was distracted. Barely looking at her, focusing on his environment, on details, details, details. "If I must."
Janine got up with an air of elegance, of a dancer, swirling around her. "Greg said you called for us. Did you not?"
"Oh no," John protested. "This one."
"I-I suppose I do like fireworks."
John knew what she meant. The way she spoke of days where she had been able to come alive, now being blocked by bodily betrayal. A little dramatic, perhaps, but his shoulder had started troubling him again. The one Mary was not leaning into, fortunately. It was the weather around this time of year.
With a bemused smile John watched as the crease of irritation between Sherlock's brows deepened. Under different circumstances – if he were human, for example – he would be on his landlady's side without question. He was sure the man with long gowns and pretty eyes was the most insufferable of tenants and roommates. Rarely found sleeping, rambling at all hours, keeping vampyre blood and God knew what else in the kitchen, going on and on about murder and mayhem. All in all, he sounded like … Yes, what did it sound like?
"Let's hope that he doesn't tonight, then. I need you to do something for me."
Sherlock bent further over the railing, staring downwards. For a moment, John feared him to be under her spell too, but suddenly his head came around and his wide eyes turned from Irene Adler to him.
They sat again. Sherlock seemed to take a look at the menu himself now, so the noises of distanced chitchat, chinking silverware and toasting glasses came through again. John's eyes were roaming around the room. High society, indeed.
John didn't like to admit it, but he had assumed the man was dead. And even less had he dared to believe he would ever stand in front of him. But was he not dead? Had he ever been alive?
A shiver ran down his spine. With a first reluctance, he went over to the window to look down the street. Indeed, there was something waiting for him. A cab? It suddenly seemed clear that Sherlock meant for him to get in there.
"Er, Doctor?"
of joy. We’ve come full circle.
Oh, but he is so close already and it feels so good. It wouldn’t take a lot for him to snap. His mind already drifts off again, and he bites onto his finger so hard that it will surely leave a mark.
"But if there was only one in the world," he whispered, and put his hand to Sherlock's strangely warm cheek, stunning the detective and reducing him to eyes blown open, "it would be you."
Of course.
"Because he feels betrayed by me. Sherlock knew the day would come where James took me completely, and when it did come … I could not fight it. Sherlock defined me by this, and he defined our differences. He thought the loneliness was his strength, and sentiment was my weakness. That this was why I lost to James Moriarty's evil hand. It is not unlikely that he fears the same might happen to him now."
John finally has the courage to turn around and go, or maybe he lacks the courage to face him and stay, but either way he walks back into the sitting room, prepared to put on his jacket and leave the house for at least two hours. Sherlock jumps up and follows him.
“That wasn’t a compliment, you madman. We’re gonna get out of here now, and you’re gonna help Greg with the paperwork, you hear me?”
"Sherlock Holmes." The way the man let the name linger on his tongue disgusted him.
"Oh, what a pleasant surprise! So good of you to stop by! You should've said hello."
"This could be brilliant!"
"The painting is a fake."
"Alright, John. Listen to me. You have to do exactly as I say, will you do this for me?"
"To England," said Mycroft.
"All those years it was always unclear to me, but now I know ... He eats them."
John's heart skipped a beat. Sherlock had said it to him before, in very dark nights when the rain was whipping against the windows. In early mornings when only the birds were keeping the city alive. But hearing those words floating to him so out in the open, so clear and so naturally in the middle of the day here at Baker Street … That was new.
John huffed a humourless laugh. Oh, the audacity! "Why would we even begin to believe you?"
After taking off her polished boots, she was slightly shorter than John himself. Her gaze was focused on him as if she was challenging him to look at her with the same interest that she herself was channeling through her eyes. John had a hard time trying not to furrow his brows. He wanted to appear professional here, and as a competent doctor one should not be confused by their patient. By the time she had shrugged off the red coat, there wasn't a lot she was wearing. It was a black, short dress, looking rather expensive. Something like silk wandered all the way around her waist, breaking into a black tutu. He had to have been staring now because Mary chuckled lightly before she sat down again.
, and one book has followed the next.
They both looked back into the darkness as if they could see through walls.
"I am," he whispered back.
"No! NO! Not you! You weren't supposed to come here, not you!"
John held his hands up in defence. Up to now no one else had seemed to have noticed much of his presence. Not that he wouldn't have been used to that.
He rose from the back of the horse until he stood upright, pulling John up and demanding him to do the same. Feeling dizzy from the smoke and the smell, John stood on Silverblaze's back with wobbly legs. In the middle of a battle zone. Now more than ever, he felt caught in a dream. A nightmare, most likely. If he died now, he wondered, fell down and broke his neck or landed right at the feet of a thirsty monster, would he just wake up in his own bed and get back to a time in which he had never even met Sherlock Holmes? God, selfishly and horribly enough, he hoped not.
Yes, he supposed he should have. Had been more of a rhetorical question anyway.
He’s always enjoying stupid ideas, especially when they involve John. And this is absolutely stupid, this is irresponsible, it’s dangerous, it’s-
Sherlock frowned either in surprise at John's confidence in what he was saying or at himself for not having observed the same things.
"I can tell you what you can do. You can stop being dead."
"Also," John continues in a rough voice, "if I didn't know better, I'd ask if you are avoiding me."
(A deduction - no, there was nothing to deduce here, and he wouldn't hold it back either - why should he?, he knows John always listens to him being brilliant. Something else then - a comment, no again - an objection, yes, way more likely in this context. But why not say it out loud, why just stare at him instead? Oh, because he doesn't want to hurt John, doesn't want to start an argument. Well, that's very... nice. Unexpected, but nice all the same ...)
His brain shuts down as they both moan loudly – it's so much already.
"Well, you certainly slept long enough and I could even hear your stomach grumbling from the kitchen. You are hungry. Good. Let us go."
Moriarty turned to spot him but the trigger was already pulled before John could cry a warning.
He let go of his shoulders and John felt oddly cold, despite Sherlock's hands not being even particularly warm.
"To Major Sholto."
"Sherlock, no-"
, I promise. But do not even think of leaving, now that you have already convinced me of your qualities as a
"And here I thought he could get some sense into him," she was heard, murmuring to herself before she left the room.
"Obviously, when Moriarty has the power to do this to you, he must own you as well. He was in need of a blackmailer, of someone who has influence over what the public thinks. That's why his reputation doesn't have a scratch. He simply lets your people write it that way."
"None of your concern right now, Dr Watson." Mycroft looked up at him again. "Enough with the playing around. No need to be so vague about this anymore. Obviously, William Wiggins has kept me informed about your recent involvement in my little brother's organisation. Now we find ourselves at war. What does that tell me about you,
There is a loud sob that fills the room, and now Sherlock finally understands why John is looking at him like this, why he is leaning forward and stretches out his arm to caress his cheek. The thumb with which he strokes over one sharp cheekbone is wet. After another sob he realises that it is not John's thumb but
the posh one?”
"We will lose so many of us." John had already lost the tone in his voice. "Somehow I don't mind putting this thought to rest and accepting it as truth. But the thought of losing you … It has become unbearable to me."
John raised his and Sherlock's hands, whereat Sherlock stepped forward and made a turn under his arm. This was a dance move he had seen many couples do before.
"We can't."
"I wouldn't bother trying that."
"This cannot simply be what people do."
John clears his throat before he dares to give a well-wrought answer. What comes out is a slightly baffled
She stretched her arm out over the table for him again and her grin showed teeth. "Why, thank you. I chose everything myself. If you had seen this place before I got my hands on it, my, my."
"I see you have brought Dr Watson again." They shook hands. "How do you do."
"John, I believe you to be capable of much, but how would you possibly do that?"
The walking stick made him sound like he was either more than one person or three-legged, and even though he was neither, the impression remained. James Moriarty had entered the room. And was walking straight towards John. At first, he did not even seem to see him at all. He was looking past him, and as he passed by, he left an icy aftertaste on John's bare skin and through his clothes.
John saw what she meant. His expression in itself displayed the inner conflict he must have felt. About to tell John of an action in his past he was less than proud of, felt perhaps even shame and remorse towards. But now there was a third party. A party that also cared a whole lot about him. A party that also deserved the truth. Now Sherlock Holmes had to make another choice. It was obvious that he was debating, heart against head. But well... heart?
“See?” she says. “Told you they would be long gone by now.”
, I am eating! At least something of a warning next time?”
Suddenly there is nothing, not even a dozen armed police officers bursting into the room, that could hold him back from doing just this. He pulls him close and thrusts his cock between those pretty lips. Sherlock runs his tongue over the head, and he groans so desperately. Between his legs, Sherlock moans too, and the vibrations only make him thrust into him faster, harder. He loses sense of everything besides sensation and thrill. Sparks light up behind his eyelids, travelling down to where his blood is headed and into his thighs. Muscles cramp as he thrusts and grunts and whispers Sherlock’s name, muffled into his clenched fist that he presses to his mouth.
"Tell them what? Oh. Yes, that."
"Sir." Sally Donovan, who, too, had watched this scene play out long enough now, raised her voice.
Sherlock didn't say anything else after this. He seemed to want to say something, but just kept his lips pressed together. A debate between the head and the gut? After a while he cleared his throat once, then took a big sip of wine (John really worried if Sherlock should even be consuming liquid), just to avoid his gaze again.
, he finds himself thinking,
"I will explain everything. It is a lot to ask, I understand, but I will still ask you to trust me."
Janine raised her head further and her gun with it. She pointed it right between his eyes. John didn't move, simply kept staring back.
"John..."
"There's no reason to be quite so loud. We wouldn't want to arouse any further attention, would we?"
"What if it doesn’t work?" he asked because even though the man was a genius, this plan involved more than only one obstacle. How exactly Sherlock thought John should convince a police officer, he had no idea.
Sherlock looked after the vampyre as it fell down before his feet, his mouth wide open. John grabbed him by the shoulders and swirled him around.
He began to play a low, melodious air – harmony and dreams poured into his music. He couldn't recognise the piece, and perhaps it was his own. He had a remarkable gift for many things, and John wouldn't be surprised if he had one for improvisation. Whilst he played, John saw him behind closed eyes. The rise and fall of his bow and his chest, his earnest face as it was looking down upon him.
The doctor in him was barely convinced. "Are you certain-"
John is at a loss for words.
Lestrade's body went still just as he was about to take a sip from his cup. "Oh."
"No?" he asked, looking into his cup. Earl Grey with a splash of milk.
Later, as he lies boneless in John’s arms and he holds him close and protective, he knows that he would always give up a little bit of his control to be with him. Because it’s all that will ever matter.
Sherlock was still staring at him. Moriarty was currently engaged in a cheerful conversation with a woman in a white dress. A few more minutes and he would have pierced daggers through him with his eyes only.
John leans forward, suddenly much too close again and not close enough at all. He brushes the tip of his nose against Sherlock's snub nose, and it's so sweet that his mind couldn't possibly grasp the meaning of this gesture. "I said I really have to go now. You have no idea how many times I've been late because of you this month already, you handsome git."
While Sherlock swam to the shore, John made sure the jewellery thieves, due to which that boat chase had originally been initiated, did not shoot at Sherlock, and in the process of that received a pretty hard blow to the head. A bump is already growing just next to the vein that always pulsates visibly when John is angry.
Sherlock was already talking to a little man, shorter than John, blonde and anxious. His eyes looked familiar to him, a pair of thin silver glasses making them look bigger and his head smaller. Despite the feeling of finding some familiarity in his face he could say with certainty that he had never seen this person before.
They cuddle in silence for a long while. Sherlock is very close to falling asleep. He is much closer to losing himself to whatever he feels for John Watson. He knows it is love. He’s not sure how much more it is, but it might just kill him one day. That might just be fine with him.
"Sherlock Holmes," said he, and threw his own arm at John. Due to quick reflexes, he caught the hand along with the whole arm before it could hit him in the face. Certainly the strangest handshake to date.
He feels so limp and weak now. His body is not attached to him anymore, it clearly can't be, he must be floating on some cloud in heaven. Minutes pass by that feel like hours, and he thinks he could sleep for days on end. In a rough tone, he manages to breathe out, "Did you?"
"What about Mrs Hudson?" he asked as soon as he was directly behind him on the stairs.
John coughed, trying to lead the conversation in the right direction again. There was a mission to be accomplished. "So the last thing he said to me. It was about his last case." God, why was this so difficult? "A big one, a big... case. He needed case files."
He was panting, sweating and eventually dared to look over his shoulder. When he turned his head again, Sherlock was nowhere to be found, but a shutting door told him into which of the room he had disappeared. A second later a loud, piercing scream could be heard from the other side and John slammed the door open. He expected danger, but this scream was out of Sherlock's vocal range. When John stormed into the room, his vision had narrowed down to a tunnel view, and before the detective knew what was happening, John was giving him a heavy push that had him stumbling back. Sherlock looked truly surprised for the first time and he automatically made himself appear even taller in defense.
John put his hand out of the way for him so that Sherlock could absorb the blood with a pipette. He asked John to open a jar and its content was also very lively. It was filled with dozens of little maggots, stacked and struggling on top of each other. With pursed lips and his face creased in aversion, he let a few of them fall into a Petri dish like Sherlock instructed him to. With him still leaning over his shoulder John was a bit more distracted than he would have liked to be, but the deep baritone echoed in his ears as he told him to
Before this conversation could go any further, the door flew open. John was honestly relieved to see that Lestrade was here now. And he had not come alone.
"Sherlock? Would you walk maybe?"
"No, don't do this to me, I swear, if this is... This can't be real. You-"
Sherlock seemed to consider that. "And you fought vampyres."
"So, Doctor. Are you planning to stay in here all day?"
"You think so, John? How come?"
"Yes, it's still a secret!" Sherlock looked around the room without actually searching for something to look at, and John felt a moment of deja vu. (Maybe Sherlock should not simply into other people's offices if it was still so very secret.) For a second, the detective appeared to be at a loss – not necessarily for words, but for the right way to deal with Lestrade's unexpectedly strong reaction. He tried to calm them both down by speaking in a lower voice, laying a hand down in the air between them to make his point clear. "Lestrade. You know this is bigger than your pride."
"I am serious. This time you will sit in a hansom with me instead of driving it, you hear me? There are a few things you haven't told me yet."
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. Just joking around a bit, I know that's not always ..." He stops himself, having gained Sherlock's attention again, but the look in his eyes, the worry in his knitted brows causes him to focus on something other than a confused apology. He starts checking on him as a doctor.
, thought John, glancing down at his chest. Slowly but surely he began to wonder if no one noticed the indicated outline in the form of an ear in his pocket. Apparently they didn't or decided not to question it. Nevertheless, he thought with a single ear missing from his mechanic body he would still count as
"What you probably won’t find most apes doing. I'm taking a walk."
Its hooves almost crashed into John as they flew through the air, hitting the ground just inches from him. He rolled away in time and onto Moran and then punched him in the face. Moran shoved him off him and kneed him in the stomach. That beat the air right from John's lungs and he held himself, trying to breathe in. But Moran had gotten up and closed his hand around his throat. He forced him up until his feet were barely touching the ground – how tall was the man?! – and John thought his face was turning blue.
"Do you think he saw you?"
The expression of Sherlock Holmes not only made him feel sympathy but also the undeniable desire for justice.
What's Irene gonna do now that those two lunatic thunderbolts have found each other, eh? Well, of course I know already. And man, it's gonna get mad...
"Oh no. You would know if I did. Do you feel threatened?" The man asked with false sympathy.
It was rare that Sherlock and John would go to bed at the same time. Sherlock doesn’t sleep much in general and, according to him, John does so far too much and far too long. John is often tired from work or from running after potential murderers. Sometimes both of those activities on the same day. (An odd couple needs an odd hobby.)
. Only Sherlock. As beautiful as he has ever heard his own name sound. He’s had no idea his name could sound like this, and he’s not sure how anything else could ever come close to being this good.
"Holmes!"
"A dogtag. Military days. Your own? No, the reminder of your soldier identity doesn't provide enough emotional value, it would meet with cynicism rather than sentiment, wouldn't it? Why would you still have them on you if they weren't from someone you cared about? Your posture suggests it was intimate, and your jaw clenches as if you were still uncomfortable to this day. So it was something you had to keep from most of your troop. Someone you wouldn't have been allowed to be seen with. Who was higher in rank. Or perhaps someone who wasn't... adequate?"
Wide eyed, Sherlock's head turns in John's direction who is already looking at him, smiling warmly.
"Thank you. I understand how difficult that is for you, Dr Watson. Did I ever apologise for almost killing you?"
John shut his mouth and looked at him. Sherlock was just as concerned and as frustrated about having his hands tied as he was. But he had been the one to send them all here. The police, his friends and ... John. The layer of fear in Sherlock's voice and his own name on his tongue was what held him back. They could only watch in silent defeat as the Chief Superintendent was mindlessly walking up to the stage.
"Have you ever liked someone before?"
A loud growl woke him from his thoughts and the dizziness ebbed away. The next thing he saw was the points of a large hook boring into the vampyre's face and ripping his neck open. The impact from the hooks pulled him right off his feet and from the rooftop to certain death. John couldn't take Sherlock's hand this time, as there was none currently on him, but he managed to get on his feet by himself and pick up his sword. "Saved me again, did you?"
"Oh, no, no, no. I am a utilitarian. Everyone has secrets. Therefore, everyone can be owned. Owning people equals immense power, you see."
When he is finally able to draw his gaze all the way up to John's face, they lock eyes and Shelock realises that the smirk on John's lips is meant for him.
John was so absorbed in the article about the missing detective that he didn't notice the quiet figure approaching him and pulling back the chair on which Mary had sat minutes ago. The chair's legs scraped against the floor and his eyes finally focused on Mrs Hudson. She was watching him with interest, yet the look in her eyes differed immensely from the ones that everyone else had given him today.
It smelled like fresh rain and smoke, lit fireplaces and sweetened black tea. Intimate like a warm-lain pillow, exciting like the leather of a riding crop, and a bit of citrus. It smelled as much like the time he and Sherlock had spent in front of the chimney, engrossed in conversation and the words of each other, as it smelled like the cold air in John's face and their joined hands when they had run through the streets of London. He wondered if that was how Sherlock had smelled like when he had still been human, and the thought alone sent goosebumps to his skin.
"Nothing. We knew he would be here. He will probably soon step into the centre of everyone's attention all by himself. Then we can at least keep our eyes on him."
He smooths his hands up again, tracing the line of his collarbones and then, almost shamelessly, lets them dip below Sherlock's shirt, up again, before he opens the first and then the second button. Sherlock nearly bites his tongue in the attempt of staying silent. Because he's afraid. Afraid that, should he dare to let oh-the-slightest sound pass his lips, John will laugh at him and leave, forever mocking him for his desperate needs.
John presses his lips together at this, and Sherlock worries briefly that the vein at his temple might just burst. His eyes withhold a certain kind of spark, like a candle flickering, like the glare of a predator. All of a sudden, Sherlock feels stripped completely naked by those eyes only. Then he comes to realise … He’s stripping down. The ruined jacket abandoned next to his shoes and socks, his shirt hanging open to expose his chest and stomach, and his trousers… he’s in the process of shoving them down his thighs. The process of stripping down to his underwear for John Watson. But he feels naked.
"For now? You say that as though you thought there could be alternatives. In the future."
Before any of them could say another word, John's food was being delivered by the dashing bloke with the long hair and the polite smile. He couldn't help but do a double take as the man leant down to place the plate in a perfect angel in front of him. When he was gone and John took the first bite, it was nothing but absolutely delicious. He swallowed it down and helped himself to another sip of wine, not remembering the last time he had been treated so well.
No one knew how she did it, but this time around everyone complied.
(See the end of the chapter for
. Then John's eyes finally caught hold of the one gentleman who stood out, crossing the street to get to their building. He wore a top hat that he had pulled down to cover his face and in his arms he held a little striped cat.
John, no matter how much he hated it, saw his point very clearly. Come what will, even with Sherlock Holmes on his dying bed, there was no arguing with him. Every part of himself was telling him to go against it and he was giving him a sharp nod.
. John wanted to get up, do
Whatever had followed after, he had responded to it with ignorance. Through a miracle and the hands of Major James Sholto he had stayed alive, yet remained dead inside. He had felt that way for what could have been an eternity. And then, due to a meeting he hesitated to call destiny, he had risen. Now he was sitting here, in this overly expensive restaurant, and felt highly out of place, but at the same time didn't at all. Because opposite him sat the most fascinating and exciting creature he had ever had the good fortune to meet. He wouldn't want to be anywhere else. And that was all that counted.
They danced a few more turns in silence, to the soft tunes the music gave, the violin and the piano the softest and loudest in this piece. John thought it sounded familiar.
"John." His voice is only a pitch higher than he would have expected as he whines and lets himself fall back on the bed. John seems to know immediately what he needs, almost as if he had had a hundred times of practising this, studying him.
“Take your clothes off.”
Sherlock turned his head in surprise, as if to ask
Enough! If this should really be the case, he didn't want to ruin the only chance he will ever get to have with this man.
"I told you," Mary said in a low voice, "He has not been here for long, James, how would he know?"
Kitty spoke again. "Well, then her best is just not good enough. You, of all people, know very well what will happen if-“ But then she held her tongue.
"Brother mine," he said to Sherlock, but he was looking a little too devastated to sound cocky.
"About time," said Sherlock.
Finally, he elaborated. "He needs the victims first. He needs their bodies, for whatever reason he appears to need the hearts, and, for now, he will need their brains to be alive."
Moran was still bleeding away.
Once Sherlock had spoken, the world shifted to his voice, adjusting to his words. He was wearing the tuxedo from his wedding, holding a glass of champagne in his outstretched hand. It fell from his fingers, shattering into millions of pieces. Distributing like dust.
"There are things in life, Watson, that cannot be prevented. All we can try is delay them for a while. But their outcome is always..."
Then there was a hand in his. Sherlock, who was supposed to be behind him, was now stepping onto the railing, and John could only take one last glance at him before he felt the ground pulled from his feet. Sherlock was looking straight ahead but his eyes were closed like nothing else existed around him. Like this was peace. He did not jump from the ship so much as simply let himself fall, arms wide open and coat flying behind him, and he pulled John with him by the hand he held so tightly.
Rosie, comfortably seated between John's legs on the chair, lets herself fall forward and punches the space key of the laptop that they have placed on a chair in front of them. The video pauses. John helps Rosie to sit upright again, and she looks up at Sherlock with a smile. Sherlock smiles back and winks. Rosie loves the winks.
"Yes. Yes, of course I'm alright, are
By the time she interrupted herself and took a deep breath, John had already understood that she was a lot more emotionally invested in the matter than she was willing to admit.
It warms up his heart at the thought of them just standing next to each other, watching stars. How despicably romantic. But far worse than this are the things Sherlock always leaves unsaid. Because the truth is: John could never disappoint him when he's being clever. Not because his expectations aren't very high, no, it is because he truly believes that John is cleverer than the rest. He is his conductor of light for a reason, after all.
His mind was playing a loop of it.
"I sat down in the chair, knowing I'd lose my life. He was going to cut my head open. And I embraced it when it came. So that is how." He looked at John. "How I killed myself."
Sherlock tried to hide a half-smile. "Same initials," he said. He made a dramatic pause to take off his strange hat and store it away in his coat. "Different man."
John cleared his throat and waited for the door to open. As it did, he was greeted by a slim woman with strawberry blonde hair that looked very much like a young housemaid in her attire.
John places another kiss just where jaw meets throat, open-mouthed and with the smallest hint of tongue, and Sherlock has to grip the arms of his chair to steady himself.
Molly frowned with her arms crossed. "His birthday?"
John grins, stretching out his arm to let his fingers sink into the dark mop of curls on top of him.
"Because I would have made sure you forgot it and would never be able to remember it again."
She smiled and shook her head with enough confidence for him to trust her. He turned to Irene Adler.
With the loud clutching sound of metal against metal, the iron hooked into one of the rusty bars, provoking a scraping noise that made John's hairs stand on end. Magnussen braced himself and then, with a strength that didn't fit the lanky, scrawny stature of the man at all, he pulled. The whole grid gave a loud crack. He pulled once more, and that was all it took. The bars gave in and broke from their mounting in the fragile stone wall. So John's first impression had been correct. This was nothing he could not have done with a few precise kicks, had he only known the weak spots. Magnussen had clearly known them. The bloody bastard.
John simply watched the old man in silent disgust and with slight pity for himself. Where was Sherlock? Who was this man? Or had he walked right into someone else's threat?
"Where do I put my-"
They were finding themselves in the glass pane belly of the ship again, standing around the main table made of maple wood. The lamps around the room cast their faces in warm yellow light but the atmosphere was rather a mild one. Lestrade had acted quickly when the attacks had started shortly after their meeting at Scotland Yard, securing citizens and commanding his officers to do the same as quickly as possible. Furthermore, he had rushed to his house and taken Molly with him before the second airship was able to take them all on board.
He doesn't know that he is staring up for almost a minute without thinking anything at all. His eyes are sparkling in a light azure, they're alive and liquid. His mouth hangs open just a bit. Mesmerising. But he gets thrown out of this blissful state when one of the stars he is looking at (number fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven!) moves. He thinks it might just be a plane, but he is wrong. It doesn't move, it's falling! Falling from the sky in one long, white line until it disappears in the air. A few centimetres from his point of view another one falls as if to follow his friend and burn to death.
John took a long sip on his champagne to ignore this. Because if he didn't, he would be useless for the whole night. Distantly he noticed how someone entered the stage, accompanied by another person, and then two and three and four people sat down on the wooden stools that had been placed there. They took in the space between the chairs and their instruments. There were violinists and contrabassists, and soon soft tunes filled the whole room. Mrs Hudson began playing on the piano and someone John recalled to have seen before played the trumpet.
“No,” Sherlock whispers, and John looks down into the darkness. “It came from the inside.”
"This is not 'real work', it is a fantasy, and believing you could defeat this army all by yourselves is but a suicide mission that will lead to mass destruction."
"Why wouldn't it-"
She looked down at him almost fondly. But there was just a freckle of impudence within her innocent features, always a hint of coldness around those irises.
"Wait." Lestrade started looking back and forth between John and Sally. "You two know each other?"
"What do you propose now, Doctor?"
He turned around in one swift motion, so John could only see the line of strong shoulders and a slim waist, the spine travelling up to the nape at his neck. When he spoke again, it was with regained rationality in his tone and face. "You are most probably not welcome down here,  or you would not lurk about with such caution. No. The question is: What are you doing here? Besides the obvious, of course. You were looking for medicine, led by a foolish idea, but no!"
He tries to thrust up into his fist, but Sherlock lets go of him again, causing him to make a frustrated noise exposing his obvious desires. Sherlock lifts his head and leans down between his legs until his lips ghost over his frenulum. When John pushes up against them, it almost seems like a question, and he inhales the scent of him that starts to cloud his mind. In the midst of his daze, he opens his mouth and licks one long stripe from shaft to tip.
I am the future
"High?!"
“Of course I don’t-”
John smiles at him, and Sherlock swallows. He can't get over the feeling that he has missed something. Was it something John has said while he wasn't paying attention for a few moments? Was it a mocking smile? Mocking Sherlock for having stared at him again? Insecurity creeps up his neck and he hates himself for having being fooled by his emotions again. Hatred is also an emotion. A very, very dangerously strong emotion. John seems to notice him struggling, as his smile disappears for a second, and he adjusts himself before going for a more encouraging smile this time. It works better.
Only now he noticed how Sherlock was staring at him. He blinked up to him, then shook his head to himself for having been lost in his thoughts, and caught the other man hiding a smile.
It was the last thing he remembered before he fell deep, deeper still through this sea of sounds right into dreamland.
, the burning slowly fades to be overshadowed by more pleasure, more pleasure sparking up from the inner walls of his very core, from the base of his spine.
Sherlock frowned at him for a second before he visibly had to gather his patience with him anew. "No offence taken by that,
"Not at all. But that's something new."
him. He misses John like air, because he still thinks he can't get enough of it into his lungs, and even though his mind is clouded he still feels his absence.
Sherlock shook his head. "No, Doctor. And you are a doctor, you should know this. My brain alone won't keep me alive. It merely ensures the mechanisms of my nervous system. It is a tool, a storage room, but it is not all I am made of."
He shook his head in disbelief and the words just spilled out of him. "I thought you were too astounding to be true."
He got to his feet and took the leash. "We're taking him with us," he informed Lestrade in a tone that allowed no room for an argument.
"Anything you'd like on the menu, free, for you and for your companion!"
John doesn't take his eyes off him again, but Sherlock has trouble doing the same when he reaches for his cock. The strokes are too light and too slow to satisfy (but what, at this point, would actually manage to satisfy if not everything at once?), but he can distantly feel, underneath the veil of magnifying pleasure, that John rolls his hips in tiny circles to the pace of his stroke. He is building up a rhythm, and when he is moving faster, Sherlock pushes back, causing John to thrust deeper with every push and pull and
John seems to understand, but when Sherlock thinks he will finally put this wonderful mouth around him, he only places a kiss to one of his testicles, and that makes his whole body shudder. Then he moves down. Before Sherlock can even so much as comprehend what is happening to him, John pulls his arse cheeks farther apart with his hands and suddenly there is a hot tongue against his perineum and a loud cry fills his ears. Only later on he realises that it’s his own desperate voice that fills the room, along with the wet noises of John’s tongue moving against one of the most sensitve spots of his body. The tremor in his thighs returns, harder now, every exhale is a groan, and his hands search for something to grasp.
“You don’t like waiting,” John points out, but he is already incredibly relieved and impressed by Sherlock’s words.
They have broken the rules of gravity without meaning to, something always pulling them towards each other. The light that had been reduced to a small warm flame is now growing again and burning bright. Sherlock can feel his eyelids grow heavier, the closer he is to John, the stronger the smell gets that numbs every rational thought and reminds him of naked masculinity, safety and
While John is talking, in Sherlock's head everything begins to slowly unfold to one string of events with his mind supplying pictures to scenes he couldn't have seen. He has it all in front of him, all in his mind's eye …
Sherlock's eyes narrowed as he looked from the one to the other. Of course, he saw right through both of them. It was what he did. But in this case, John hoped it was to his own advantage.
John pinned the bridge of his nose in frustration and was about to kneel down next to the inhuman remains of Ms Adler when Sherlock caught his arm and pulled him back up for him to look him in the eye (as the other one was still inside of John's pocket.)
John raised his chin. "Vatican Cameos."
. Machines can only be programmed to work on behalf of logic and logic alone. But Sherlock did not act like a machine. The way his face revealed just the slightest bits of emotion, the sole fact that he even wanted to hide those emotions, that he thought he had to appear colder, contradicted the very act itself. John had seen him caress his violin. There was no logic in that, none at all.
General Midnight seemed to understand before he did. "Here, take my horse!"
"Come, Doctor. We have to keep moving if we intend to blend in."
“Me being an ungrateful moron? Me never saying what I should say before it’s too late? Me trying to get my anger at all of this under control? Yes. Yes, I suppose it is.”
Both of them sat down and took in the positions they had been in before, readjusting to both their roles in this calculated little play as they sat down opposite each other with a table to separate them. John carefully took out the tube he had just slid into his bag and shot her a quick glance from the corner of his eye. She still smiled like naïveté personified. John didn't like it. He had to try to distract her somehow, or he might blow his cover.
Over cold winters or the ornate fields of May. Tonight I need you to say.
Sherlock's cold hand stroke over John's cheek. "John, you know this is the only way."
He thinks about their bodies sticking together forever, someday growing into one, so that they can never leave this place. Probably not as romantic in practice as his blissed out mind tells him it would be right now, but that doesn't change the fact that he wants to stay here with John for as long as possible. Getting up is not an option yet.
"I'm glad," said Sherlock.
) and John enjoyed letting himself be floated away on soft, feathery notes, high as sweet howling, down again to vibrating hums, all contributing to the masterpiece of a symphony, executed by only one instrument, four strings and a bow. John thought he was hearing the piece not for the first time in his life. It sounded quite familiar to his ears, but his head could make nothing more of it.
"Take one of my dressing gowns for the night. Wardrobe to the left. Fold your clothes for tomorrow. I have nothing tailored in your size here, so you will need your own clothes to look presentable."
The other half of the ride was spent in silence. The hooves hit the streets in a rhythm pattern as John urged Silverblaze to hurry until Moriarty told them where to stop. They arrived at an old graveyard and bound their horses to the fence.
"He stores a few people of influence, such as me or Smith."
There is not one hint of bite in his tone, all soft and slightly amused by nothing in particular. The doctor presses one last kiss into the still moist mess of curls and gives his biceps a suggestive squeeze before he removes himself.
While she was circling him, she was simultaneously getting closer and closer. Her breath was hot on the back of his neck, and he tried not to move. He clenched his jaw in discomfort as he felt her whispered words coiling around the shell of his ear and tickling it. It felt as though she was trying to find a way into his very head. She would never touch him, the only soft contact established through shifts of air around, and when she spoke again, it sounded like a dark spell.
Sherlock Holmes had worked with the police. It could only be the big cases, the most brutal and bizarre cases, that had made him so famous a detective for being the only one who could solve them.
"Sorry, did you two want some time alone?"
"If you'd pardon me, Dr Watson, I believe I must go after what I have so foolishly prolonged until now. It will be just a moment."
Kissing him, he felt, made the core in the centre of his body glow, warm, shining brighter than the Afghan sun. Love, he felt. Love was worth a nightmare or two if he was granted to wake up like this. As long as this was still reality, and any true horrors of his life lay in the past, lay in bad dreams.
"I thought so. That's why I have no means to look for body parts. I'm looking for art."
The sound of breaking glass echoed in his ears. Sholto pressed the palm of his hand against the side of his neck. John's body reacted faster than his head did. A shot through the window, a crack in the colours. John's gun was in his hand and he shot back, hearing a scream from the other side that confirmed the hit. The cracks ran across the panes and multiplied over the glass painting like a spider's web until the structure inevitably collapsed and the shards tumbled over the tiles.
but John kisses his temple before he can turn away. He feels his eyes burn again.
"Dr Watson, but I can't help you. My hands are tied."
It was already clear to him, though, that this job would offer him a lot more than being in a clinic all day and treating the flu. Secondly, and according to Sherlock Holmes, him working there was
Sherlock was quiet for a moment too long. "Sleep now."
"I want to apologise."
, he swore to himself. Sherlock asked if he could have a sip,
, you have a doctor here now. Dr Watson, go tell him what he is doing to his health if he refuses to eat or sleep or let others care for him."
"Ah, good evening, Lord Angelo."
But any kind of suspicion was put aside and got replaced by an unexpected thrill at knowing someone. Finally,
"What if it doesn't work?" John asked, but took the tiny bottle anyway.
Molly, of course, noticed that he wasn't paying much attention to her. "What do you see?"
"What? How do you know?"
It was pure self-control that kept John from forcing that fleabag of a man to his knees and ram the ironclad toe of his shoe where no man would ever want to feel pain. This fellow disgusted him, and it must have shown on his face because the man just chuckled. "Na, na. No reason looking like that, young man. I am only a businessman with one or two insights of how reality truly is. Even if it isn't what we want it to be."
"Not this time."
The General jumped down with grace and raised the flap of her silver helmet.
"You are going to destroy yourself. Again."
John, behind him, around him, inside, everything he has ever wanted. But it's still not enough. The satisfaction doesn't happen, and it won't. Not like this. He stops and stiffens as he thinks and worries. His face is still pressed into the pillow. John is behind him, but he's not
They walked all the way to Buckingham Palace. John was nervous. Although several people assured him that the danger only existed at night, he never stopped feeling his gun resting in its holster. The cabs on the street were almost as rare as the people, and they both wanted a walk. Sherlock was restless. He needed a clear mind but it wouldn't come.
He was leaning down to rest his forehead against John's. He was not warm and he was not cold. Yes, what was he?
The restaurant was so full on this particular evening that it didn't look like there was even one empty table left to sit on. He was sure he must have seemed rather lost, standing two steps into the enormous dining room, admiring the posh décor and the even posher circle of guests around him. A strong feeling of discomfort was climbing into his chest and hiding there, fuelled further as his eyes were searching the room for Sherlock but could not find him. Maybe this was the wrong place. Maybe Sherlock wouldn't show up after all.
"You really couldn't." A polite rejection.
He took a moment, and John understood. He opened his mouth to take a breath of courage. John would have given him all the time he needed. Then the door flew open.
appears to be reading his thoughts, because he braces himself on Sherlock's thighs now and pushes up to reach him, and Sherlock only has to bend down a little to cover this pair of lips with his own. Somehow, Sherlock doesn't understand how or why (the
The old man seemed to finally look him over and recognised his uniform. A chance for John to also look the man in the eye that was standing uncomfortably close to him for at least two minutes now. He wore a beard of dark blond to light grey hairs, covering almost all of his thin upper lip and a fair amount of his chin. His forehead looked almost unending, for his hair had fallen out in a way that left the remaining longer strands on the back of his head almost looking out of place. He smiled a smile that didn't reach his steel blue eyes, and he wore a monocle. If it had not been for the bits of his clothes that suggested higher class, he would have looked far more intimidating, even to John.
John swirls around, his mouth a thin line of held back emotions. He stands close to the door. Ready to flee. “And what do you wanna say?”
"No time for pleasantries."
They stood like this for far too long and not long enough to grasp what they were doing, but the curtains were halfway drawn. Halfway, like the air between them was only halfway charged with the tension of physics, of magnetism, while the other half was insecurity. The reason why he felt that Sherlock would understand what was happening between them was because it followed a pattern of logic. It was science, two poles that attracted each other equally, despite all their differences. They were not from the same worlds, he and him, but did they have to be? Somehow, destiny had still placed them here today, so close to being in each other's arms. The sun was setting. The room went dark. Sherlock's eyes never did.
He looked back down to spot where Moran had almost been choked to death by a snake. He was gone. The snake was still there, dead. He raised his head and his eyes locked on Sherlock's form. He had grown his one hand back, the one that wasn't currently a colt, and fought James Moriarty with a sword. Moriarty was bleeding from his face and his clothes were dirty and badly torn. Sherlock didn't look much better, with the exception that he couldn't bleed. He could only wear the blood of the dead around. Every time metal met metal, the blades were screaming for mercy. Sherlock broke down first.
Everyone around him had become an obstacle. They appeared to be glued to where they stood, building a massive barrier. Sherlock couldn't get away fast enough.
James Sholto's hand sank down John's shoulder, trying to hold onto him but not finding the strength to keep himself up. His eyes were blown wide open and the only sound he made was a gurgle as his own blood ran out of his mouth.
The detective looks at him with an expression so full of shock, as if John hugging him would have never been a possibility he could have reckoned with. But here they are.
, such a relief! It felt like something very heavy was lifted from his chest. He did not have to keep up these lifelong secret pretenses for this stranger! This feeling of relief came so unexpected that John felt lightheaded.
Those eyes are all he will ever need. Forget food, water, body functions. Forget the air around him, forget breathing. Those eyes are all he will ever want to see.
But oh, he was desperate. And how he was. For whatever may come.
"You're not someone who could work here for the rest of his life."
"I know," Sherlock snarled, but his expression told him his irritation was directed at himself. "I
"I'm sure it won't."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. "If only it was so easy. No, you fool, you could not. You could, however, immobilise her long enough for me to get out of here and, if we are lucky enough, without drawing the attention of her pests."
John steps right into his space. Sherlock can smell him. It does things to him, awful things to his heightened senses. It clouds them, but at the same time he is overly aware of naked skin and of John wearing way too many clothes.
"So counting the minutes. That's what you're doing in your free time. Who would have thought?"
John shook his head in disbelief. "Why, Sherlock? Why would you even?"
The man standing in front of Moriarty was still shouting about his crimes in a monotonous voice.
So Sherlock gave in and obeyed. He wrapped his hands around John's middle and, not without a little sulk, told him to get it over with. John communicated to Silverblaze to gallop as fast as she could and they rode back into the fading smoke. He tried his best to hold his breath but his eyes burned painfully. Bodies were piling left and right, and his ears filled with screams of terror. Sherlock suddenly took the leash from him and the horse made a hard stop, throwing her hooves into the air as she cried out. They were just at the wall of a high building.
She poked her head through the door. "He's here, sir."
They were alone in the warm hansom cab. London was rushing by behind the window glass.
She did have a point. John only gritted his teeth and gripped the jacket as if to put it down, only to hold onto it in mid-thought.
"But please don't touch anything!"
. John, yes!"
"Meteor showers are events like this, where meteoroids are entering our atmosphere. But most of them could never reach the ground, you see, 'cause they are so fast and small that they just burn and combust. It looks like they'd disappear and you'll ask yourself where they're going. That's the myth behind it, actually. They say if you see a shooting star you shall think of something you wish for, and it will come true."
"Yes, Ma'am."
John cocked his head to the left and to the right, loosening the muscles in his stiff neck, and took a deep breath.
Sherlock immediately went down to his knees to inspect what was left of the man. He was like a bloodhound on the scent, using his whole body to examine every angle he deemed necessary enough to look into. With a small magnifying glass he worked for approximately one minute until John had lost his sense of time by watching him. He had never seen him so utterly in his element.
Now I am standing on both my feet, up against the wall. Hear them coming down the hall. You remember these halls from that first night? The first of many nights (in which you saved me from myself and thus, my life). You have killed a man, but you must know, oh, my turn now to run and go.
There is no turning back now. This is war.
When he reappeared, he wore a smile below his waxed moustache that was somehow tighter and less patient than the one before. "Only a moment, sir."
"Ah." They could never go back there now anyway, even if they wanted to.
"Sherlock-"
side in this battle?"
For a moment that took John's breath away. The light was coming in through the large windows behind that made him gleam like a saint, the thick curls arranged with a bit of wax being his helo. Graceful like a statue. At this very moment, it hit John that this man was beautiful. He did not even want to deny this. What he did not notice was that Sherlock had also looked him over once or twice, eyes flickering down to John's bare chest with him standing there in nightwear only. John felt his face heat up and quickly wrapped the open red gown around him, closing the belt. Suddenly, he was feeling a lot more exposed. Here he stood, opposite this handsome creature that was fully clothed, dressed in an expensive suit, and he himself, half-naked and barefooted, looked ... like him.
"Yes, sorry, yes, Stamford. Hello," John cut him off, and shook Mike's offered hand instead. He gave him a quick once-over, maybe a bit too conspicuously, and wondered why he had not noticed him sooner. Stamford had certainly … gotten a little larger, nicely put, but his prominent features and appearance had stayed the same.
“Sh-!” But he can’t say anything, of course. Every sound could be heard from the outside.
They long for each other, and their lips meet so hard it might leave bruises. John is all-consuming, is groaning and opening his mouth by opening his own first. Sherlock’s knees buckle at the sensation that is John’s tongue running over his bottom lip. If this is what it’s like to kiss John Watson, he should be put in chains because it’s dangerous. He walks him backwards, shoves him into the wall next to the kitchen. Sherlock’s trousers have dropped down to his ankles and he almost falls over them, held upright by the hard surface of the wall where he bumps his head into.
, and that he's gotten all
The lights were burning dimly in the night's sky above the city. Both airships had lit several little oil lamps from one end to the other. It made the world up here feel warmer despite the cold moonlight meeting the grounds of the ship earlier than the streets below. Most of the attendants of both ships were fast asleep in the ship's belly, and even the screams of madness from down below faded with the wind. Only one of them was wide awake. John found him leaning over the railing, dark curls against pale skin, the sharp angles of his face softened by the light coming from the oil lamp in his hand.
"He's dying," John said, trying to keep his voice from breaking. "We need to get him out of here."
"Milverton?"
"Uhm, and shouldn't we tell Sherlock about this?"
Sherlock seemed to consider this for a while. John didn't even dare to blink, watching him as Sherlock's eyes were closed. There were a few wrinkles, placing themselves around the closed lids and between his drawn brows, almost building a bridge above his dainty nose. The gap between his full lips narrowed and dissolved into a straight line when he pressed those lips together, and John eyed him in fascination, for when he opened them again there was a soft
"Is that why you are here then?"
"Obvious?" he asked, voice rough from the lack of breath.
"Apart from Hawkins, obviously," John added.
"Oh!" he heard himself say. "But you will be alright if I just..." John more or less indicated what he was trying to say, and she chuckled again.
He knew Sherlock was watching him. He could feel his gaze piercing him. Maybe he was expecting him to cry. Oh, and how badly John wanted to cry.
and when Tessa appeared, they only complemented each other's moves so gorgeously. Eventually, he realised Mary was still looking at him and turned his head in her direction. She looked much more entertained by his face rather than the actual show. In her defense, she had to have seen this a hundred times already.
John turned around to look at the crow, but in the corner of his eye he saw the little Mr Stripes. Although he wore an expression that made him look like a different person due to the evil smile on his chubby face, his features gave him away. He was holding his wrist close to his mouth and his lips were moving, talking to someone. There was no one else to be seen. And suddenly, John heard his voice loud and clear.
"I might be poor, bu' I'm not stupid. Mycroft's worried and 'e pays me well. But Shezza's a friend o' mine. A real friend. We used to get high t'gether."
General Midnight was running through the list of weaponry in preparation for tonight's battle. The dark was to the vampyre's advantage but they could simply not afford to sacrifice more innocent lives to another night passing. If they were lucky enough, they could at least strike before nightfall. Despite the dangerous promise of death and spilling blood, of seeing their own people fall, John could not deny the energy that this promise was feeding to him. He felt it around him even now, just watching the knights turning at every command, carrying their weapons from here to there.
Their exchanged glanced indicated a far deeper connection between the two of them. Mary showed not one sign of remorse or even concern.
"I thought you knew what you were doing!"
His hips twitch upwards, he desperately tries to create more friction through the fabric of John's jeans. By now, he groans with almost every exhale of breath. John straddles his thighs and presses him down to rub against him, giving them both what they need and not nearly enough. He can feel that John likes it, likes being on top of him, likes having the upper hand and taking control over Sherlock's pleasure, and
"Of whom?"
, once you stop working on your own. When there are people who rely on you, trusting you to rely on them and so on."
John was wondering. There was no 221A or even C anywhere near, after all. Then he chuckled to himself, thinking about what that said about the inhabitant and his reputation, and that he really ought to read the papers more often. If the B was on the door, Mrs Hudson either had to be a very generous woman or Sherlock Holmes was even more famous then he had realised till now. But a private detective had to get his clients to find him somehow, he supposed.
"For the rest of your questions, I'd like to take you with me to Scotland Yard. There we can address everything else that needs to be addressed. Along with... the death of Sherlock Holmes."
"I forgot how it feels to feel."
"Personally, I mean. Have you ever met this..." And he hoped to get the name together correctly, "Sherlock Holmes?"
Great, it's happening again. Just great.
He looked up at him and found a pair of crystal blue eyes looking back, keenly, fascinated as they always were. He had missed those lively eyes. Oh, he felt pierced. Happily pierced by crystal blue, with two tiny freckles on the left, a shimmer of green whenever he blinked. John reached out to let his fingers sink into a mop of soft curls, closed the gap of distance. And kissed him. Kissed him in his bed, in his arms, in his very mind and soul.
An unbelieving laugh bubbles up and out of Sherlock's mouth, letting out breaths caught in his lungs on their way, and his voice breaks.
"Did I... forget anything?"
John's other new superpower, apart from doing all of these things to him and
They came into a hallway with a high ceiling and a white staircase to the left. There were no pictures on the wall, and the only light was coming through the window on the other side of the hall. The next room was huge. Golden arcs were running down from where high ceiling met damask wallpaper, adorned with excessive patterns. A few chandeliers hang from the ceiling in rose gold, halfway burned down candles on top. It absolutely complemented the density of so many different patterns and shapes around the room that there were whole bushes of leaves and flowers around, building a contrast to the thin vases on tables with boquets in them. The mixture of all the different colours and decorations should hurt the eyes more than it did. Curiously enough, it only expressed a very special approach to royalty. John didn't know if he ought to sympathise with any of this or none of it at all.
The General's men led them through the lower section of the ship until they arrived in the middle of the ship; a big room with its left and right wall entirely made of glass panes. John's eyes hurt from being exposed to the bright light from all sides after having walked through the rather dark halls. On both sides, there were spiral staircases and in the centre, there was a large oval table. At the head of it sat no other than Mycroft Holmes.
John, of course, sees that he isn't eating, does he? He has to. As Sherlock, despite holding a buttered toast in front of his mouth for several minutes now, simply looks into the void absentmindedly, and he still feels quite exposed to, well, only the whole of the world. Although, he is aware of the fact that the whole of the world cannot see him right now. (No more hidden cameras in 221B, he checks up on that. Regularly. One could call it overreaction if it wasn't for certain
When he looks up to him again, he seems to have found his courage. There is a sudden air around him, an aura, announcing that something will follow now, something that will change the world forever.
"All in its time."
killed my patient! God, he will destroy me."
His hands both clenched around his chest. He scratched and gasped and kept searching with his hands and eyes. There was nothing there. Eurus had shot right through him, revealing the empty space, oh, so much empty space where no heart was pounding. The hole in him exposed the wheels turning and cogs spinning and some had flown out, continued to fall out of him. He could not speak. But he
, kissing him like it had always meant to be. He can hear Sherlock sobbing through the kiss, but his lips are soft and he tastes so much like home that John wants to stab himself in the heart for ever having left, but then, wasn't it Sherlock who had left?, and he's done, just for this beautiful moment, so done thinking about this tragedy. He is kissing the man he loves. The stab in his heart that he can already feel is love. And it hurts so good.
Moriarty kept him at The Professor for some hours after he had signed the contract, but thankfully he didn't see Irene Adler again this day. Instead, he met Tessa who had somehow managed to twist her hand during a rehearsal a few hours ago. She let John have a look and his advice was cooling it, secretly thinking that maybe Kitty was not entirely wrong about treating her like a child – she could be quite clumsy when it came to … moving her body in general, he supposed. But then again, John knew nothing about dancing. And the more he thought about it, the more he questioned how much he actually knew about anything that was not a wounded body or a battlefield. But he knew that he wanted to know more. He wanted to know the person who could help him see more.
Moriarty spoke of his generosity in the same way that John would speak of himself being a very foolish man if he was truly desperate. And he was desperate, too desperate, for something to finally
The draining sound of the ever clapping hands,

If only he could touch himself. If only he could press his cock against the mattress and move, create some friction, anything that won't make him come untouched. But then he would have to give up moving towards John's fingers every time he pulls back a little, destroying the rhythm he might be trying to build because he is just too eager.
"I see the outline of a rectangle around your chest area."
"Very good." He gave a pleased smile.
"And yet here we are."
“What happened?” John asked, keeping his eyes closed so that they wouldn’t burn.
He didn't sound honoured.
"Hmh?" he hummed, not recalling what he was referring to.
John blinked his eyes open. He felt like he had slept for at least a week, judging by his dry mouth and light head and back pain. He remembered a dream, vivid and close, but he didn't remember what he had been dreaming about. As if a part that was once his reality had been wiped out with each slow
, and had given no other response to his request. But now he was doing that mouth thing from before again, practically giving himself away.
"What can you drink then, if you can't drink tea? Engine oil?"
That earned him another smile. He didn't think he wanted it. "You've read the name on the door, I presume. Would you like to make an elaborate guess?"
John wriggled about on his seat, unsure if he should get out or not.
"That is exactly what-"
Sherlock's hands were palm to palm again and once more he reminded John of a saint. "Pray, tell the man that Sherlock Holmes has sent you, and that it is of highest importance that he provide you with as much information as there is about all the crimes committed in London within the last four weeks."
On the stage, between fire and smoke, Moriarty smiled, looking Sherlock directly in the eye. He looked so self-satisfied, so evil that John suddenly, shockingly, understood what he was. But it was too late. Moriarty grabbed the Chief by the shoulders, pulled his head back and rammed his teeth into his neck. The lifeless body of the man sunk to the floor like a heavy sack.
John looked at him like a tired man. "Well, there seems to be a lot that I don't know about but you do."
"I worry about Sherlock Holmes."
“John!”
Suddenly, Sherlock was leaning into his space, his hand touching John's forearm and his lips brushing his ear. "Could be dangerous," he whispered, no hot breath felt but just a general heat coming off him instead.
"I didn't know what else to do." The inspector walked towards him, his face a helpless apology. But rather was he apologising for not being sorry at all. "Holmes. We need him! Even you must see that this has grown over our heads. This is-"
at times. But everyone has bad days, right?" She looked at him as if he simply had to agree with her, but, as seemed to be a habit of hers, she did so with the confidence of a cat watching its prey.
It was impossible to tell if she had two arms, four or eight, if eyes were in pairs of thousands or millions, if the ground shifted and crawled underneath his chair or if he was, in fact, the poisoned one. She started screaming and John felt his ears bleeding from the inside out.
