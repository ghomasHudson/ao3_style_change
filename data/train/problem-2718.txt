“Hey man,” he started, hoping the right words would come out. “Have Cas try it with you, just once. I think it’ll help you understand why it was so hard for me to stop.” Then he shook his head. “Better yet, just do it for yourself. You’ve got better control over yourself than I do usually.” At a loss for words, he just shrugged and said, “I think you’d like it. A lot.”
Cas was a whole other animal. The movie snafu aside, he seemed to be what Dean had always looked for-a hot body, a great mind, a good work ethic, and the man could kiss like nobody’s business. When he wasn’t hiding behind his stiff professional persona, Cas was actually pretty awesome.
Cas appeared a few feet from where Dean sat with the baby. “Yes, Dean?” he asked. He dropped down to the floor in front of them, running his finger around Sammy’s back without actually touching him.
The room fell silent, everyone feeling Gabriel's sorrow that he had been the one ordered to execute the offspring of the Watchers and human women. Sam knew better than most the weight such tremendous guilt could carry. He rose from his seat and approached Gabriel, rubbing circles on his back and offering what comfort he could. Gabriel accepted it, leaning his head on Sam's shoulder.
Gabriel looked up and saw Sam standing a couple feet from him. “Sam?” he asked, confused. “What the hell are you doing here?”
Cas tilted his head in that confused kitten way he had. "Nephilim do not have wings," he stated, almost daring Sam to contradict him.
“I’m going to do the first harness,” Gabriel said softly, breath tickling Sam’s ear. “This one will go across your chest. Are you okay for me to keep going?” When Sam nodded, eyes closed, Gabriel picked up a bundle of black rope, stretching it full length before folding it in half. He wrapped his arms and the rope around Sam’s midsection, just below his pectoral muscles. His hands worked deftly but cautiously, wrapping the rope around his back, below his arms, over his shoulder, and across the back of his neck, checking to make sure the rope didn’t pinch at Sam’s skin as he went, before tying it off in the middle of his back. When Sam looked down, the rope formed a pentagram over his chest, Gabriel’s mark showing from the center.
Castiel relaxed again as Sam sat down at the piano and sorted the music out while Dean set up a couple music stands. Charlie pulled the stool out from behind the drum kit for Castiel while Dean got out the amp for the electric cello. He passed it over to Castiel, who sheepishly said, “I’ve never played on an electric cello before and am not quite comfortable with it, may I use your traditional?”
He took Sammy out to the garage, walking him up and down the rows of cars and telling him about each one. Dean would tell him how old they were, what made them special, what kinds of engines they each had and the best way to fix them. He crouched
Cas took his hand to comfort him. “We’ll speak to our brothers when we return to the bunker. They may have acquired information in our absence that will assist us in making a decision.”
"Yeah, well, we don't wanna just slap a band-aid on this shit," Dean told the archangel, "we mean to fix the whole timeline so the kids never have to go through this bullshit. So what can you tell me that will help us?"
“Awww, Sammy, I didn’t know you cared,” Gabriel quipped, rubbing his jaw. “But, you know now, so what can I do for you? And by the way, how
Joshua’s smile dropped. “Kevin asked me to come here on his behalf.” At that, Dean and Castiel joined Gabriel. “He believes he has destroyed his friendship with the Winchesters, and has therefore decided to stay in Heaven, so as not to upset them further.”
“Unca!” Sammy said, clapping his hands. Sam looked at Gabriel smugly and bounced the baby on his knee, making him laugh.
“Cheers dude, you survived another year,” Sam said, raising his beer bottle up to his brother. Dean leaned over the map table to clink his bottle to Sam’s, seconding his toast. The last year had been rough, but it wasn’t all bad.
He arrived on Dean’s doorstep with reusable grocery bags in each hand. He had his seasoned grass-fed Angus beef, cheese and toppings, fresh buns from a local bakery, and potatoes for homefries all ready for him to cook up for them. He also had some mini caramel apple pies he would deep fry and two pints of vanilla bean ice cream. Never let it be said that Castiel Novak did not appreciate good food.
. He was only sixteen and despite having been home-schooled had already graduated the high school curriculum with an A average. He wanted to go to an Ivy League school to study archaeology and history. He played the guitar like it was second nature.
“How did I know? HOW DID I KNOW?!? I know because our son is here! OUR SON. As in, we made a child together. THAT is how I know!” Sam was panting heavily from his ranting, and Gabriel just stood there, slack jawed and staring.
made a TV show about you moving to Los Angeles and solving crimes. The actor was pretty good looking, too.”
“I guess so,” Dean said, taking a long swig of his beer. Not knowing what else to say, they just sat there in companionable silence, drinking their beers and enjoying the peace while it lasted.
Gabriel held his hand up to snap, pulling back from the kiss to ask Sam cheekily, “may I?” Sam grinned and said, “yeah,” and when Gabriel snapped his fingers, Sam was tied spread-eagle on their bed, naked. “I am totally holding you to that touching and marking thing, you know,” Gabriel smirked, and Sam laughed.
"Hey," Dean said, walking into the room, "nothing on the internet about random blowjobs or anything else that looks like magic sexual compulsion. You find anything?"
"Anyways," Gabriel continued, "the Watchers taught their wives and children forbidden and secret knowledge that corrupted the hearts and minds of mankind which led to the destruction of the Nephilim."
“Hallelujah,” MJ said quietly, smiling at her dads. Dean looked at her a little surprised, then smiled at her right back. “Yeah,” Dean replied to her, leaning into Cas’ shoulder. “Hallelujah,” he whispered to Cas, smiling like he’d just gotten everything he ever wanted.
She took the rose from him, but then jumped out of the bed, looking around. “Where’s my uniform? I have to get back. They’ll think-”
As they came down from their emotional highs, Dean laughed. “One of these days, we’ll actually make it to the bedroom.”
MJ laughed. “You’re overthinking it, Uncle Sam. Just do whatever feels right, you know? I mean, from all the new memories, things are looking pretty good for when we get back. We’re never hunted, we don’t have major run-ins with demons or angels, the bunker never gets blown up, and we’re all still pretty tight. I doubt getting him a birthday present will screw that up.”
Crowley took a sip of his tea. “So sorry to hear that, but it doesn’t sound like any concern of mine.”
After swallowing his mouthful of pie, Dean shook his head and replied, “I don’t think he was an asshole so much as we just didn’t know or understand each other. He’s fun to hang with.”
Neither man could say who moved first but they crashed together. Deep kisses, tongues exploring and tasting and tangling together. Hands exploring every inch of skin they could reach. Dean's mouth trailed along Cas' jaw, his neck, kissing and sucking and nipping. Cas' fingers grasping at Dean's short hair as he gasped for breath, the feel of him overwhelming his senses. Dean rocked his hips tentatively against Cas', the angel moaning at the friction against his fully aroused cock. He felt Dean grin against his neck as he did it again. And again. And again.
“Cypress from Israel,” Gabriel replied. “It’ll hold spellwork better than other wood. Figured we’d reinforce the doorframe with it and we can add some protection spells to it."
“Can we just get this over with?” Cas said irritably. The man pinned Dean down with those ocean-blue eyes that always stole his breath. A man that cold should have an icy glare, not one that makes his skin heat up. He shook it off and gave Cas a lecherous grin.
Before Dean could beat a hasty retreat, Castiel appeared right in front of him, his persistent disregard for personal space blocking Dean's escape.
As everyone came down from their highs and they started to regain their breath, Dean panted out a "so?"
Sam shook his head and set his book on top of the pile next to him. "Nothing yet. I started with succubi and inucubi, but they're not strong enough to resurrect an archangel. I also checked djinn, in case this is an elaborate dream, but it doesn't fit." Sam let out a shaky breath. "What if what happened before was just to throw us off? What if whatever this is gets violent, even deadly? Billie said we're out of chances; if we die again, it's for good." That train of thought tightened Sam's throat and he fought the tears that were threatening to form. "I can't watch you die again, Dean."
Danel looked at Bobby then looked at Gabriel. "How dare you!" He seethed. "You were the one who brought the order for our children's deaths, then you dare carry one of your own?"
“I remember him, but the memories are gone,” MJ whimpered between hiccups. “Kevin’s not part of my timeline anymore.” MJ broke down into sobs again. Her dads hugged her tighter while looking at each other over her head.
“Don’t care,” said Dean. “We’re getting her out, even if it means freeing Lucifer in the process. How do you like that?”
"Do you think Crowley's taking a run at expelling the angels from Heaven, like Metatron did?" Sam asked.
As Sam and Dean enjoyed the peace and quiet, Kevin appeared. "Hey guys, I think we've got a problem."
They had spent the next several hours bouncing ideas off each other when baby Sammy chose to make his opinion known with a loud wail. Everyone turned to see Cas taking him from Mary. "I believe he is hungry and needs a diaper change," Cas said. "I will
, the only one he knew the words to. As they sang together at the tops of their lungs, Dean watched his angel smiling bigger and brighter and laughing more than he ever had. How had he missed the light in those ocean-blue eyes before? Maybe because before it was all business and trying to save the world and crap. When Cas let loose, Dean could see how handsome, how
Bobby snorted at that. He went over the notes his dad handed him, recognizing all of them from the bunker in the future. There were a few that weren’t there, so he scribbled his own notes in the margin before handing them back. “Look at those, too,” he said, “I’ll ask Kevin if he has anything more powerhouse than that.”
Castiel looked at Dean, who just looked at him in shock and confusion. They got up and walked to the front of the room, retrieving the folders from Mr. Turner and returning to their seats.
," he said, hands waving at Cas' hand on his dick, "if you don't know how big Dean's dick is? You have nothing to compare it to."
Dean's confused gaze went from Cas' hands tearing at his jeans to his brother, whose head was thrown back as Gabriel went to town on Sam's cock. Sam was white-knuckling the counter as he tried to keep himself upright.
Instead of reaching for that third beer, Jody plucked baby Sammy from MJ's arms. God, these boys had literally been to Hell and back, they really deserved some happiness. She never pegged either of the Winchesters as batting for the home team, but seeing them happy with their angels reminded her that love knew no bounds. And their kids? Absolutely amazing. She never thought she'd see the day, but now that she had she would give anything to protect their growing family.
“Guys, a little help,” Dean didn’t whine. He felt a desperate need to scratch, but still couldn’t move. With a wave of his hand, Gabriel freed him from the spell so he could scratch away.
“Yeah, right,” Sam snorted. “I haven’t seen your panties this twisted since you got serious with Lisa Braeden.” Sam had a lightbulb moment, then stared at his brother. “Holy shit, are thinking about getting serious with someone?”
he thought as he tried to throw his arm over his face to block out the light. Unfortunately, his arm wouldn’t move. He tried again, but his arm jerked on something. Squinting, he looked at his arm and found it chained to the bedpost. A few more tugs of his arms and his legs found him bound at both wrists and ankles.
Castiel knew who Humphrey Bogart was, but had never seen any of his movies, and couldn’t place the movie quote, tilting his head to one side as he thought about it but couldn’t figure it out. “I don’t understand that reference.”
Dean had always called it “Unattached Drifter Christmas”, but with everything that’s happened over the past few years, Valentine’s Day hadn’t even been that for him anymore. Besides, knowing that he was going to end up bonded to Cas, he felt a little sketchy about going out and finding a hookup.
“Shhhhh,” Dean murmured into Castiel’s throat, “everyone’s up and wandering around, don’t want them to hear you.”
“Again,” Charlie Bradbury sighed from the percussion section, garnering groans and giggles from throughout the orchestra. Dean shot her a look and she blew him a kiss. He acted like he caught it and stuffed it in his pocket.
After burgers and cake, Bobby started tearing into his presents. Dean and Castiel had gotten him a leather jacket and hat that was an exact match to those worn by Indiana Jones. Gabriel got Bobby a leather-bound journal that was spelled to only allow him to read the contents. MJ had given Bobby her silver knife, but had engraved a protection sigil in the hilt.
He poured the popcorn into a bowl and headed back towards the den with one question on his mind-what kind of lover would Dean be? Maybe if he had been more preoccupied with where he was going, he would not have run into the man, spilling popcorn everywhere.
Sam spoke up this time. “You’re in Kansas. You were hurt, you prayed.” Sam let out a little chuckle with a soft smile. “Gabriel heard you, brought you here and we fixed you up.”
Gabriel looked from MJ to Dean and Castiel, trying so hard not to laugh and only barely succeeding. “You’ve had your say, now I’m gonna take a turn here.” He got up and put his arms around his niece. “I love you, but you need to be a little more respectful of your dads.”
Gabriel yanked his arm out of Sam’s grasp and snapped his fingers to plant Bobby’s chair firmly on the floor. “Didn’t anyone teach you to respect your parents, son?”
Bobby snorted at that, trying to hold back a laugh. “People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect,” he muttered and Dean laughed, calling him a smartass.
Gabriel yanked his sword from Samyaza’s body. He waited for him to fall, to explode, to die. But he didn’t. Samyza turned around, black ichor oozing from what should have been a fatal wound, a wound that would have killed any mortal or angel. Once again, Samyaza charged at Gabriel, this time much slower. And once again, Gabriel spun to one side to allow the other to rush past him. This time he brought his sword up to shoulder level, letting the blade follow its path through Samyaza’s neck, his head dropping to the ground.
“What the hell were you doing to my daughter?” he growled, slamming Kevin against the wall again. Gabriel tried restraining Cas this time, but restraining the pissed off angel was not easy. MJ ran to Kevin’s side, checking him for injuries. Being an angel now, Kevin wasn’t hurt, but he was shaken up.
Dean blinked. Actually, he didn’t. They’d spent a lot of time talking about books and music and his mom and Sammy, but he honestly couldn’t remember Cas talking much about himself or his family. “Shit,” he cursed under his breath.
“There’s my little man!” Dean called out, walking towards them with his arms outstretched. “Da!” Sammy called out, reaching towards Dean. Dean just laughed and scooped him out of MJ’s arms.
“Alright gorgeous, strip for me,” he said with a smirk. “I’m gonna tell you everything I do before I do it, and I’m gonna need you to tell me if there’s anything you don’t want me to do or if anything gets too uncomfortable for you. Like I said, it’s all about the journey.”
“That is a pretty shirt,” he told her, and she blushed. “What about friends? Do you have many of those?”
Cas sighed before pulling his wings close in to his back and turning to face Dean and Sam. "I apologize," he said, "this was unexpected and I'm not completely comfortable with it."
"Yes, please Dean!" Cas cried out. Dean worked a third finger in much easier than the second, Cas was so loosened up. When he slid them all in easily, he reached out and grasped Cas' cock. He felt the muscles in Cas' ass tighten and watched his balls practically crawl up inside him. Dean squeezed the base of his cock to hold off his orgasm.
Sam turned about ten shades of red then, wondering if the best solution here would be to talk to Gabriel about his concerns or try to make a run for it. Sam sighed and put the bowl of ice cream on the coffee table. He took a deep breath and said, “
“Yeah, I know what you mean,” Sam agreed. “How is that going to work, if we can’t get them back? I mean, are there going to end up being two of them if they’re still here when they’re born? Would that create some sort of paradox?”
“No he didn’t!” Sam yelled back. “He has his own reasons for wanting to be the best, did you ever think about that?”
For the longest time, Dean had been adding his own notes to their dad's journal. It happened long enough ago that Dean probably put an entry in for it... "Here it is," Sam said, sitting back down with the journal open in front of him. "Balthazar sent us to parallel universe once, where
“It is not weird at all, Dean, and I do not mind,” he smiled. Dean scooted over to the far side of the bed as Cas made himself comfortable on the other side. Dean rolled into Cas and rested his head on his angel’s shoulder.
“Pie,” Dean whispered, holding up his boxes proudly. Gabriel gave them a thumbs up before Castiel pulled Dean out of the room.
“Bobby didn’t know,” Gabriel said quietly from their door, standing in his boxers and an undershirt. Everyone turned to see the smaller man leaning against the door frame, looking absolutely exhausted. “No other angel can get into his head, but I can, and I never saw it. He didn’t know.”
“Yeah, no problem.” MJ huffed and sat down on the ground just outside the cage. “I’ve been praying for you, you know.”
"Do you have to ask?" Deanna groaned, reaching up and pulling Gabriel into another searing kiss. "You're my guardian angel," she breathed into his mouth as they parted. Gabriel smiled sweetly against her lips and snapped his fingers again. Another wave of pleasure washed over her, and when her hips bucked he easily slid his dick inside her and making her cry out, "
MJ lit up like she was itching to share some stories about hunting. “Oh man, it’s like you two are psychic or something! You’re so in-tune with each other when you’re fighting that it’s almost like the whole thing was choreographed for Hollywood.” She stood up and started mimicking fighting with a gun in her hand. “You’re all, sawed off shotgun in one hand and knife in the other, Papa’s all angel blade and mojo. This one time we went in after what we thought was a small clutch of vampires, like three or four, and it turned out to be this nest of over a dozen bloodsuckers. You guys were fighting back to back, taking them out one after another, bodies flying everywhere while I got the civvies out. It was awesome!” she finished, slightly huffing. It was way too early to be moving around so much, but that was just one of the many epic stories she loved about her dads.
“Mary,” Castiel said, resting a hand on her shoulder, “please go get Dean for me.” Mary nodded and left to get her older son.
Dean stood there, shocked. Cas would never cease to amaze him. Putting his thumb over his brother’s face on the photo, he looked at it again, trying to picture Cas tied up. Yep, definitely some interest from down below. He handed the picture back to Gabriel, still looking at Cas when he said, “maybe”.
Dean feigned shock, clutching his chest in mock scandal. “You mean you’ve never seen Casablanca? I don’t think we can be friends anymore, Cas.”
Her breathing grew heavier and her hips became more erratic as he slipped a fingertip into her ass. "Come on, sweetheart, let go," Gabriel encouraged her. "Let it all out. I've got you, you're safe."
“I’m so sorry Papa! I don’t know what happened! I didn’t see that the ghost had a knife, I should have been faster, I-”
“Dear angel,” the woman said with a smile, “thank you for the dance. Now if you don’t mind, I’ll be handing you off to your next partner,” she said with a wink. As she turned, several large men came and grabbed Gabriel by the arms. He looked around frantically for Sam, but couldn’t see him. Before he could call out, a rag was placed over his mouth, and he lost consciousness.
A few hours later he heard a faint knock on his door, barely audible over the music he had playing. He turned to see the door open, Dean standing on the other side. He paused the song and stood to greet Dean. “How are you feeling?”
Cas scowled at the stolen fry and pulled his plate closer. “So this band is one you listen to frequently?” he asked.
Gabriel and Dean stared at him in shock before they were both laughing so hard it hurt. “Dammit, Cassie! You and your morbid sense of humor!” He wrapped an arm around his cousin’s shoulder and kept laughing so that he wouldn’t cry.
Thompson’s Pre-Owned Automotive Center was in a nicer area on the outskirts of Vail. Being early on a weekday, it didn’t seem too busy. Gabriel, Bobby, and MJ anxiously strolled into the lot as far from the main building and mechanic’s bays as possible. Gabriel could feel Lucifer’s presence here and wondered who would make the first move. He didn’t have to wonder long.
“You do that,” the man said with a wink and a wave. As he walked off, Bobby leaned down to put his shoes and socks back on. When he looked back up, it was as if the man had vanished, no sign of him anywhere. Weird. Once again making sure he was alone, he snapped his fingers and flew back to the bunker.
Castiel stood back, watching Dean. He had heard both sides of the conversation, hearing Anna, Lady Antonia Bevell’s… housekeeper?... tell Dean that shortly after dawn in England, Lady Toni and a couple of hunters from Cardiff engaged one of the Grigori at
"No, but he lectured me about being careful every time I went into a bathroom." Dean got up to grab another beer from the fridge, only to find they were out. "Think you can snap up some more beer, shortstack?"
. The conductor just crossed his arms and stood there, not even bothering to lead them as they took over the piece.
“If it makes you feel any better, Uncle Dean,” Bobby said, “he’s always been a proper gentleman and treats her like a princess.” Bobby picked up the horseshoes from the nearest post and lined up his next shot. Just as he was about to release the horseshoe, Guns N Roses’
“Oh thank God, you’re back,” Mary said, walking quickly towards Castiel with baby Sammy in her arms. “This little man has been fussy without his Papa’s grace. Gabriel tried, bless his heart, but I don’t think Sammy liked it very much.” Mary handed Sammy off to Cas, who could immediately feel the baby pulling on his grace.
. Like everything in his life had just snapped into perfect order for him. Sam had to admit, he felt just a little bit jealous of his brother at that moment.
"That's from the Book of Enoch," MJ said finally. "There are lots of other cultures that have lore on Nephilim. Some cultures believe that Nephilim aren't the children of angels and humans, but the children of angels and demons. Maybe, considering the Winchesters are of Lucifer's vessel's bloodline they might think we're important to the future of Hell?" she posited.
When Cas hit Dean’s prostate, his back arched and he let out a pornographic groan. Dean could feel Cas’ smile against his shoulder, and his angel picked up the pace, hitting that sweet spot on every thrust and making Dean cry out. Their sweat-slick bodies slid against each other, and Cas had to hold Dean tighter so that the force of his thrusts weren’t pushing him out of his grasp.
Getting Cas to happily agree to playing with him for the benefit seemed like a big step forward to Dean. He was getting more and more of those small smiles from Cas, but he’d yet to get another one of those heart-stopping, wide gummy smiles of his. Dean had a plan for that, though.
refers to menstrual blood. And Saint Fiacre? Patron saint of gardeners, cabbies, and people with STDs."
, you moron!" Gabriel grabbed Dean's face in both hands and shoved his tongue down his throat. Sam just stared and Castiel whimpered. When Gabriel
“Depends, what are you in the mood for? I was just thinking of ordering pizza or something.” Dean really should have put some thought into this before saying anything, because now he felt a little underwhelming.
“We especially can’t do that. Besides, this is the good part. Instead of seeing them hang all over each other, we get to watch them fall for each other,” Bobby grinned.
“So, what? He overdosed on grace?” Dean was just starting to wrap his head around this whole thing. Angry now, he turned on Gabriel. “You didn’t think he’d become addicted to the high of your grace? That as long as Sam liked it, everything would be ‘happily ever after’?” He turned to Cas. “How much worse is a grace high than a demon blood high?”
“Did you forget anything?” Dean asked. He didn’t want to outright ask his nephew if he screwed up the spell somehow, but Bobby knew that was exactly what he was asking. Sam came to his defense, reminding Dean he followed Bobby’s work line for line from the book.
Bobby was still wiped from his time in the cage, feeling both physically and mentally drained, so he spent the past few days lounging on the couch watching Netflix and enjoying ‘classic’ television. Neither Sam nor Gabriel, or anyone else for that matter, wanted to go on a hunt with him here like this, so they decided to take a few rest days. Mary had spread out a blanket on the floor in front of the couch for baby Sammy to lay on, and she, Castiel, and MJ watched him as he rocked from side to side, trying to roll over. They thought it was great fun to say his name and watch him try to turn his head towards the voices he heard.
Sam liked kissing as much as he liked having his hair played with, and Gabriel was really, really good at it. Sam wrapped his arms around him and pulled him close, tilting his head and slotting his mouth against Gabriel's like they were made for each other. Their tongues dueled for dominance as Gabriel ground his ass into Sam's now-fully-erect cock.
Sam looked uncomfortably at Bobby, almost too scared to ask. “Um, who is your, um, mom?” he started. “I mean, which angel carried you?”
Mary had taken Bobby out for his birthday that afternoon before the party. They stopped for coffee (for her) and hot chocolate (for him) before heading to a local gun range. She spent a couple hours helping him with his stance, his aim, quick reloading, and shooting while moving. It was a lot of fun for both of them, and by the time they were done they were both laughing and swapping hunting stories.
Sam, Dean, Castiel, and the kids rushed into the room, wondering what the hell Gabriel was up to now, and were all shocked to see the broken soldier he was resting on the map table. As he moved his hands to various cuts and bruises to heal them, he was shouting out orders. “MJ, get her some clean clothes. Sammy, get a bed set up for her. Deano, finish getting her uniform off.” He leaned over to Castiel, worried. “She’s been raped,” he whispered. “You’ve got the more delicate touch; can you heal the trauma?”
Dean, Sam, MJ, and Bobby joined him at the table; Cas hovered around Mary as she rocked baby Sammy. Dean proceeded to tell them what future Gabriel told him about the kids being pursued on three different fronts.
"I don't think so. I think the age difference will throw them off, no one knows they're from the future. But that doesn't matter, they're still Nephilim, and it's brought the Grigori out of hiding."
"Don't act so surprised Dean," Sam said, "you would have pulled the same shit. Best we can hope for now is that she knows what the hell she's doing."
As Wilson danced alone in the middle of the ballroom while the other dancers were being hauled out by the Nazi forces, they heard a crash in the war room, followed by “a little help here!”
Gabriel turned to Sam. “A lot of kids’ stories and fairy tales start out as cautionary tales. Remember Pinocchio? Well, there was a demon that bound his victims’ wrists in shade and soul to control their movements, like a marionette. And if it was just a single, bored demon doing this, there wouldn’t be any omens.”
of his thoughts just now. "It's not going to force them to act out of character or lower their inhibitions or anything," he continued, "but it will make how they really feel, feel right."
“I believe I was close to smiting him, without a second thought,” Castiel stated calmly. “The mere thought of anyone violating my own child like that enraged me.”
“Mission accomplished.” Dean licked his lips. He leaned back on his hands again, staring up into Cas’ eyes. “So, I thought you said something about teaching me how to take care of an angel?”
, because at least he & Cas could agree that Sean Connery was the only real James Bond. Movie in, they both just kinda plopped onto the couch, sipping their beers in tandem.
, throw me a bone here,” he absolutely did not whine. “What the hell do I do for Valentine’s Day in the future?”
for them to watch, thinking the silly spy movie was perfect for lifting their spirits. Mary was sitting on the couch with the kids, stealing mushrooms off their slices of pizza to put on her slice of meat lovers. Gabriel was sitting in one of the wingback chairs, Sam sitting on the floor in front of him. On occasion, after wiping the grease off his hand on his pants, he'd run a hand through Sam's hair, which would make Sam look up at him and give him a funny look. Dean and Cas sat on the floor in front of the other wingback chair, shoulder to shoulder again, sharing their pizza and breadsticks with each other. While they laughed at Val Kilmer's antics, they all kept what they learned in the back of their heads, wondering if they would have time to enjoy a night like this again.
"OH GOD, POPS, PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!" Sam heard Bobby yell. He couldn't help but laugh at that. He got up and cleaned up the best he could before throwing on some lounge pants.
Cas and Dean stumbled out of the club holding hands and singing and laughing after the last set ended. Dean caught Cas up in his arms and told him, "This was officially the best date
“Was there ever any doubt?” Gabriel asked cockily. “Come on down from there, gorgeous, I think I need to do a little research of my own.”
Cas sat down the pages in a neat stack on the end of the table, and with a grin said, “then it’s our gain.” Unbelievably, after finishing off that large burger, Cas pulled his plate back in front of him and started in on his large pile of fries. “I believe I’ll look up the song on YouTube tonight to get a better feel for the musicality. We can plan to meet later this week after rehearsals, if that works for you?”
Dean didn’t want to get up, but figured he’d better before Sammy decided to just bring the sheet music to his room and camp out on his bed. When his kid brother got excited about something, it consumed him. Usually it was infectious, but all Dean wanted to do was lay there and think about Cas.
"Yep! Cesar and Jesse don't hunt anymore, but they come visit from time to time. Usually we go down to visit them in Mexico though. They've got a pretty nice ranch out there, less than a hundred acres. Only thing they hunt now are coyotes and other scavengers that come after their goats."
With a snap of Gabriel's fingers, all of Dean's clothes were gone and his arms pulled tight behind his back. Dean tried to struggle, but couldn't move. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out. He looked almost frantic. Gabriel snapped his fingers, and words came pouring out of Dean's mouth.
“Sam was right, you’re both damned good,” he said loudly. “The KCO is lucky to have both of you, despite your little pissing matches every other month.” Dean grinned sheepishly at that, while Cas just frowned. “If you boys wanna keep that up, do it on your own time. As far as the board is concerned, you’re
Sam stood up and wrapped his arms around his son, holding him tight. As right as Bobby was, he never made the logical leap that if he chose not to have kids then Bobby wouldn’t exist anymore, and that hurt his heart more than he thought it would. He kissed the top of Bobby’s head before looking at Gabriel, silently begging him for help with this.
Crowley cocked an eyebrow at her. "Now that is interesting. I'm assuming Moose is looking for that apple pie life his brother is always going on about?"
He found Dean in the kitchen at the sink, his back and feet bare and jeans slung low on his hips. Castiel was mesmerized by the play of muscles in his back as he worked, freckles dancing across golden skin. He silently moved closer, wanting to touch. When he was right behind the man he said, “Hello, Dean”.
When Cas caught up with Dean, the hunter was pacing around his bedroom. He had an empty beer bottle in one hand, and was working on finishing off the one in his other hand. Cas stood in the doorway just watching him, all coiled strength waiting for something or someone to strike at.
Once in the room, Gabriel yelled for Sam to start the spell to send Dean back. Sam got to work on mixing the ingredients as the plaster started cracking from the walls. Gabriel grabbed past Dean's shoulders again to get his attention.
Dean held Cas tighter and pulled him down to lay pressed against him. Dean continued peppering his face with kisses.
"You lucked out with me, Sammy," Gabriel said. "Archangel/Trickster combo. Prepped and prelubed for your enjoyment."
“So the point is to create visually pleasing designs with rope on another person’s body?” Castiel asked.
Gabe just laughed. “Kidding about the married thing, just wanted to see your reaction.” Dean and Cas heaved a sigh of relief. As much as Dean wanted to see Sammy happy, it was all too much too soon, too quickly.
“I get it dude,” Dean told him softly, “but you can’t save them all. You’ll go nuts trying. You’re not gonna be able to save them all. Hell, you won’t be able to save a fraction of them.” Gabriel cocked an eyebrow at Dean before he continued. “Cas,” Dean sighed. “Cas made me think, you and me? We’re not so different. We have little brothers who do stupid shit for good reasons, and no matter how many times they fuck up, we still love them. And us? We’re the ones who love our families to the point of self-destruction. We want to take care of our brothers no matter what. Although you,” Dean laughed, “have a lot more brothers to worry about than I do.” Dean sat down next to Gabriel, facing him. “And we have this need to fix everything, protect everyone, save everyone. And when we can’t, it eats away at us.”
“Pops, wait,” Bobby said. “I think we all know that those cells won’t hold him or else he would have been there to begin with, not the cage.”
“We woke up too early one year and when we went to wake you guys up we walked in on Papa punishing Bad Santa,” MJ said with a shudder.
“Yes, Dean, I’ll see you tomorrow.” Cas smiled, then leaned in to press a chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. Dean tried to deepen it, and when Cas pulled back he leaned forward, trying to get more. Cas just smiled and said, “good night, Dean.” He went back to his car, but before climbing in and taking off, he turned to Dean and winked at him.
With the most innocent look on his face, Castiel simply stated, “Gabriel advised me that Twister is a game best played while either drunk or naked, preferably both. If you’re not too invested in the television, maybe we can compare that to our experience playing it fully clothed at Bobby’s birthday party."
Crowley knew if he let those two lose and still managed to reclaim Hell, it would be a farce. These two would hold more power than he ever would, despite his demonic powers. They would be able to stop anything and everything he ever tried. The demons would see it, and if they heard he was the one who set them loose, then every demon in Hell would rebel against him.
At the bunker, Sam was sitting in the library on his laptop trying to find more information on the witches his brother was going after. It felt weird sitting at home while his brother was out on a hunt with someone other than him. Out of nowhere, Gabriel popped into the seat next to him.
As Dean rocked his hips, he pushed Cas step by step backwards towards the bed, pushing him down to lay underneath him, legs spread to accommodate Dean between them. Dean looked down to see their erections side by side, Cas' leaking a significant amount of precome. He wrapped his hand around Cas' cock and ran his thumb through the wetness at the tip, causing Cas to arch his back and let out a feral groan. Dean coated his hand with their precome and wrapped his hand around both of their cocks. Looking Cas in the eyes, he began to stroke them together. They both shuddered as Dean squeezed on the upstroke, Cas making the most beautiful pornographic sounds Dean had ever heard. He had hoped to draw this out, enjoy his angel, but Cas felt too damned good and was so goddamned beautiful like this. He bent over to kiss Cas, both their kisses and his strokes becoming more demanding until all they could do was pant and moan into each other's mouths.
"Listen to this," Dean said, lifting a legal pad off Deanna's desk. "'Things I learned from fanfiction. Celestial beings don't have gag reflexes, Gabriel didn't choose his vessel for its height, Dean is a cuddler, Sam likes having his hair pulled.' It's basically a road map for everything that's happened the past few days." He handed the legal pad to Sam for him to look over. "You know we're brothers, right?" Dean asked her.
"Jody is going to kill us for not telling her about all this sooner," Sam told his brother, shaking his head. "You know that, right?"
Dean and Cas at a fair or carnival, both in worn jeans and leather jackets. They were wrapped up in each other's arms, kissing, Cas holding a giant blue teddy bear under one arm.
As the music played Sam stared out the window, rolling Dean’s words over in his head. He wasn’t wrong. He couldn’t go down that road again, not when he was going to be a dad, not if he wanted to do it right.
Sam sat back down to his work, sighing. He never thought that with the bunker being this full that he would ever feel lonely. He really did miss Gabriel.
Sam’s hand warmed, felt weighted, and when he opened his eyes and looked down there was a ring in his hand. Gabriel gasped and picked it up to look at it closer. What looked like pair of twined ivy vines was made up of hundreds of words in different
"Nah, I'm good," Bobby grinned. "I've seen all the movies a million times. Episode IX is my favorite."
“Don’t ask Mom anything!” Mary said, hands up in the air. “Mom is taking Sam to Colorado to take care of a Wendigo.”
Sam, Dean, Cas, and Gabriel sitting in front of another Christmas tree, MJ sitting in Gabriel's lap holding her newborn cousin.
“There have got to be other ways to get it,” Dean argued. “We don’t have to solely rely on the Douche from Hell.”
Bobby shrugged. “Just snapped it up. Helps me relax sometimes.” He plucked each string in succession before strumming a few times.
. He could’ve picked something he knew you would crash and burn at, but instead he picked something he knew you’d like and be good at. Third, the man loves you and respects the hell out of you. That means he’s gonna make you work for everything, not just hand it to you. Are you gonna open your eyes and see that or pout like a baby who didn’t get what he wanted?”
In Dean’s opinion, Cas was a stuck-up rich boy with entitlement issues. He didn’t usually talk to anyone but the conductors and Kevin, like he was too good for their Midwestern orchestra. If he was such hot shit, why didn’t he stay in Chicago where he’d come from?
angel?), "you can pick the movie. I don't think Dean or the kids will mind." He kept his hand on Gabriel's back as he led him out of the library.
As his vision lined up single again, he saw the surgeon reach for something on a tray next to the table. It was an iron collar etched with angel warding and angel traps, which he fastened around Gabriel’s neck. He slipped two fingers between the collar and Gabriel’s neck, giving it a loose tug before releasing it. He put on a pair of latex gloved and picked up Gabriel’s blade again.
Sam figured by the way Kevin phrased his question that he already knew that any angel could carry a baby, regardless of their vessel's gender. He wasn't ashamed of being with Gabriel, but the last time he'd seen Kevin he was completely straight, and felt a little unsure of how his friend would take the news.
As the song ended, the men stood close to each other, the angels holding their humans’ hands. They stood before their Father unashamed of the bonds they had forged with each other and the new family they created for themselves away from Heaven. Chuck could feel the love rolling off of them and couldn’t be prouder of his creations. He took Gabriel and Sam’s left hands in his and held them in his hands until their rings glowed briefly. He did the same for Castiel and Dean, telling them all, “you did good, boys.”
How the hell was this even his life? Why did it have to be the man that insisted he was the better cellist, that he deserved first chair? And most importantly, how did he get himself another one of those kisses?
Dean looked a little taken aback by Castiel shrugging him off, crossing his arms over his chest. “Well, since you don’t consider us friends, I’ll have to sic Charlie on you. She’d love to get her hands on a Star Wars virgin.” Then with a wicked grin he added, “although I wouldn’t mind getting to pop your cherry.”
Gabriel looked over at Sam, who was now turning several shades of red in embarrassment. He nodded at Gabriel, who weakly snapped his fingers and immediately everyone was cleaned up, dressed, and sitting at the table.
“Just thinkin’, okay? It’s nothing,” Dean said, not wanting to get into it with his brother. He refocused on the sheet music in front of him. “We gonna do this or what?”
Sam nodded again. He removed his shirt, then Gabriel’s, before pulling him close. He trailed his fingers up and down Gabriel’s spine and he kissed him softly across his cheeks and eyelids, even the tip of his nose. Gabriel shivered and snuggled into his touch, allowing a hand to dip into the back of Sam’s jeans. They stood there like that kissing and touching each other, reassuring each other, until Gabriel kissed his mark on Sam’s chest, leaning into it to where Sam could feel the moisture on Gabriel’s face.
All in all, Sam and Dean were very impressed with them. By the time they arrived no one had been killed (save for a few head of cattle), and that always counted as a win in their book. So they kicked back with Jordan and a few beers while Pam served them up some of the best damned pot roast the boys had ever had. To top it off, she had made apple pie with crumb topping for dessert and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. The old couple offered Sam and Dean the guest rooms (formerly their kids’ rooms, who had long since grown up and had families of their own) so they could rest before heading back to Lebanon.
Gabriel sighed, then waggled his eyebrows at Sam. "To be continued," he promised, then snapped his fingers, disappearing from the room.
Monday morning both Castiel and Dean were in great spirits during practice. All of their colleagues were overjoyed to hear about Sam’s recovery and prognosis, each of them asking Dean to pass on their best wishes to his brother. Charlie begged for the opportunity to throw him a small welcome home party when he was released from the hospital, just the brothers, their boyfriends, herself, and Kevin.
Sam dropped the Dean he was holding, letting him fall to the floor. Present Dean reached out and helped him up. He grabbed his past self by the shoulders and asked, "are the kids ok? Is MJ alright?"
The Speakeasy wasn’t Dean’s regular kind of place, but Sam was talking a mile a minute about the great music and fun atmosphere and Dean couldn’t help smile. As they paid their cover and entered the large ballroom, they were overwhelmed by the sounds of the band on stage, the waitresses dressed in period dresses working the room with trays of drinks, and the two bartenders putting on a show flipping bottles behind the bar. A few couples were out on the floor dancing, flipping and throwing each other around before pulling each other back in and spinning in a tangle of legs that looked effortless. Yeah, Dean could get used to this.
Dean let his head fall against the car. He let out a sharp laugh. “We made an angel, Cas,” he said disbelievingly. “How the hell did we manage that?”
Sam tried to give him a bitchface, but found that he couldn’t. He was too happy that the kids were finally safe, his whole little family was safe and happy, and that his son was celebrating another birthday. “Whatever, jerk.”
“I think,” Cas started, then cleared his throat, “I think I should go. Thank you again for this evening, it was very… enjoyable.” He took a few steps back slowly before turning and bolting from the room. Before his brain could come back online, Dean heard the front door close.
"So she writes to de-stress," Dean said, trying to wrap his head around everything. "How do we keep it from making us fuck each other's brains out?" He turned to Deanna. "You don't deserve to keep hurting, and I get that writing helps you, but I really don't wanna keep having sex with Gabriel or my brother."
Castiel nodded his head thoughtfully at that, then reached forward and wrapped one hand around Sam's dick. Sam sucked in a breath, desperately wanting to back away, but not being able to. The warmth and pressure from Cas' hand had him chubbing up nicely, but he had to try to stop this for both of their sakes. Once again, he was going to warn Cas about the compulsion thing, but once again Cas interrupted him.
Well, shit. Dean had to let go of Cas' dick and grab the base of his own to keep from ending this show before it began. Looked like that dirty talk thing worked both ways.
!" Dean ignored him and went to Cas' side, taking his hand. Gabriel was about to yell at him again when the door opened again, Dean standing in the doorway, Sam and the woman standing behind him.
“Toooo sloooow,” she sing-songed before shoving a forkful in her mouth. Sam and Bobby snorted in unison and went back to the book.
"I also said I preferred having intercourse with Dean," Castiel said primly, still frowning. "Size is not a substitute for skill." Dean grinned smugly as Sam's jaw dropped.
Dean’s jaw practically dropped at that, but Sam pushed on. “And how do Gabriel and Cas feel about that?”
He found the building and parked Baby on the back side. When he found the room he just stood there and stared at the door. He took a deep breath, then knocked.
“Uh huh,” Gabriel replied. He handed the little girl in his arms to Bobby. “This is Rose, the oldest by about two minutes. Your dad is holding Dahlia, and Grandma Mary has Peri.” Bobby bounced the infant in his arms, studying her face. Rose had pretty blue eyes shot through with gold and green and a little tuft of dark blonde hair on her head. The other girls had varying shades of blonde hair, from Dahlia’s shock of white blonde to Peri’s honey-gold curls.
Gabriel sat on the edge of their bed looking sad and broken, and it hurt Sam’s soul. Sam moved him to tuck him back into bed, but Gabriel stopped him, his grace back in use and back at full angel strength. “Sam,” he said softly.
“Where the hell were you when we needed you?” Bobby demanded angrily. “Do you have any idea what we all went through this past year? Do you enjoy watching your creations maim and kill each other? Do you get off on watching people
“Besides,” she said to Dean, “if you’re still hunting twenty years in the future, you’d be about my age now, so you must still be ok to fight.”
A large man Gabriel didn’t see standing at the head of the table he was restrained to grabbed the wrist holding the angel blade and pried the blade from his hand. Gabriel struggled to keep hold of the blade, but the awkward angle of his wrists prevented it. He tried so hard to pull on his grace, to do something to protect himself and his child, but he was still unable to access his grace. The man who introduced himself as Herr Karl raised his hands and the holy fire parted just long enough to grant him entrance. The large man walked around the table, handing the blade to the smiling surgeon.
“And does the love of your life have a name?” Castiel asked, knowing his cousin “fell in love” every other week. The fact that this man held Gabriel’s attention for more than a month surprised him.
“Where did you get these?” Sam asked him. Not all of the victims had had their pictures published in the articles Dean had found.
“Don’t get your panties in a twist Deanie-weenie. Your mom knew about me and Cassie before you guys were born. What did you think she meant when she told you that ‘angels were watching over you’?” He winked at Dean before turning back to Mary. “Besides, her heaven was always my favorite to visit, it always smelled like freshly-baked apple pie.”
“That gets me right here,” Lucifer said, holding his hand over his stomach. “So your plan is for us to have a heart to heart, for me to see the error of my ways, and come into the fold?”
Cas with an obvious baby bump and wearing a tiara, sitting in the war room decorated for a baby shower and surrounded by women-his mom, Claire, Alex, Jody and Donna, who was rubbing Cas' tummy. Dean chuckled at that.
He looked up when he heard the automatic doors open and threw a hand up when he saw Cassie and Dean come in looking around. They rushed over to him, both firing off questions at once. “Slow down, guys,” he said, hands up in surrender.
Everyone’s heads whipped around to see Chuck standing there. While Mary and the kids were confused about who it was, Sam, Dean, Gabriel, and Castiel were all speechless, an onslaught of emotions rolling through them.
Gabriel turned around to face the others and they just stared comically at each other before Dean completely lost his shit.
Cas cocked an eyebrow at him and innocently said, “I’m good with meat,” making Dean choke on a laugh. Dean moaned through most of his food, loving the flavors of the burger and the crispy fried potatoes. When they finished, he took care of the dishes while Cas fried up some little pie-looking things in the hot oil. Once they were set to cool, Cas turned off the burner and dried the dishes while Dean finished washing.
Castiel picked up the challenge piece. The challenger chose the piece to sight read, and Dean always came up with pieces Castiel had rarely, if ever, heard of. Castiel strictly played classical music, but Dean’s choices always leaned towards movie soundtracks or offbeat pieces. The challenge piece Dean gave him today was called
” as his body locked up and he came all over himself and his angel. Castiel kept pounding into Dean until his hips stuttered to a stop a minute later, pushing deep into Dean as he came, biting down on his hunter’s shoulder.
When Cas caught him staring, he took his cock in his hand and gave it a few long, slow strokes. "Like what you see, Dean?" he asked, his voice sounding octaves lower than usual. Dean didn't think this should turn him on but it really,
Cas stood up then and headed towards the door. "I believe it would be best if you got some rest as well," he told Dean. "It is my understanding that newborns do not sleep through the night, and Samuel will need to be attended to in a few hours. I will retrieve my nightclothes and return shortly."
MJ was on her back, babbling incoherently and her head thrashing from side to side, her nails digging into Kevin’s back as he lay on top of her, thrusting into her like a man possessed.
“Yeah, we figured that out. Why didn’t you answer your phones? We could have given you a heads up, or even sent Gabriel over for backup.”
“Uncle Dean said he found you guys a hunt,” Bobby told his dad, handing him some of his breakfast smoothie. Sam eyed it suspiciously before taking a cautious sip. He was pleasantly surprised and took it to the table with him, sitting across from his brother, asking about the case he found.
Castiel nursed his Shirley Temple as Gabriel rambled on about his latest crush, a man who had become a regular over the past few months. Apparently, Gabriel would sit and talk with the man for hours after he’d finish his sets, discussing music, movies, books, local and world current events, even finding a common bond over bad pick-up lines.
Castiel chewed his lower lip, thinking. Gabriel may just be happy for him. However, knowing his cousin, he would become overexcited and decide he would be Castiel’s “wingman”.
Everyone in the room relaxed a bit, tension broken. Gabriel released his son, keeping one arm over his shoulder. He turned to MJ and asked, “and who might this beautiful young goddess be?”
Toni just arched an eyebrow at her before continuing. “Very well, we’ll consider Aaron a dead end for the time being. How about you two fill me in on what you’re facing in the future, and what you’re doing to correct it at the present?”
, and he enjoyed it so much more than the rushed fucks he had when he was still playing the field. Cas was just better in every way, and he was
Rose looked at her, then started laughing hysterically. She stood back up shakily and, looking Gabriel dead in the eyes, said, “get me my uniform and take me back now.”
“I mean Papa, the angel who carried me, gave birth to me, et cetera.” Dean looked at MJ funny, and MJ realized that he didn’t know yet. “Dad, you bonded with Feathers over there,
Gabriel was practically bouncing with excitement. “Get to the car, Dean!” he exclaimed. “We’ve got a surprise planned for you guys!” He looked at Cas expectantly. Dean had gotten really good at reading his facial expressions, and if he weren’t mistaken, his angel was a little excited about Gabriel’s surprise, too.
"Surprise!" Dean said with a grin on his face, earning both boys a skeptical look from the sheriff. Both boys threw an arm over her shoulder and led her over to the group of people they were standing with earlier. Dean grabbed the hand of a pretty blonde lady and dragged her up to Jody. "This is our mom, Mary Winchester."
“Not really caring right now Bobby.” Bobby sighed and flew them into Hell, just outside of Lucifer’s cage. When they landed, she squeezed his hand and told him to pick her up in about an hour.
“You are most definitely a bad influence, Dean Winchester,” the angel replied with a grin, draping his arms over Dean’s shoulders. They smiled against each other’s lips, forehead to forehead.
Dean actually enjoyed the movie. It wasn’t a musical like he thought it would be, but featured big band music prominently. The music, the dance scenes, the costumes, all of it was just as compelling as the storyline. Christian Bale, of course, was awesome. So was the actor who played his best friend, whom he could only remember as Wilson from
“I understand that, Dean,” Cas said with exasperation in his voice. “However, it would have been far more enjoyable if the science were correct. Not to mention that obtaining plutonium is nowhere near as simple as the doctor made it out to be.”
Gabriel popped back in wearing a pink bathrobe and matching pink bunny slippers. He snapped his fingers, freshening them both up and dressing himself in jeans and a tee. "We have a slight emergency on our hands, Sammich," he said, giving Sam a quick peck on the lips. "Taking Bobby to see Kevin, we'll be back later."
“Not a clue,” Dean replied, “but I’m willing to bet Sammy had something to do with it.” He pointed out the transitions throughout the music, walked him through the Zep parts since he was pretty sure Cas hadn’t heard the song before. Cas surprised him when he started humming along, saying of course he was already familiar with one of Dean’s favorite bands. He tried hard not to blush at that as they put the music on their stands and picked their cellos back up.
As they came down from their high, Dean pushed himself up with his other hand to look at Cas. He had never seen his angel look so blissed out before, and he smiled knowing he put that look on his face. He kissed Cas' forehead and said, "love you, angel." Cas grinned lazily at him and said, "and I love you, Dean," before touching two fingers to his forehead, cleaning up the mess between their bodies. Dean chuckled at that and pulled Cas fully into the bed with him and said "I think I'm ready to get some rest now."
much) or completely inexperienced. He lay there silently waiting for the laughter or derogatory remarks to start.
“I’m sorry, Sam,” Cas told him, calm as ever. “You cannot see Gabriel right now. You are suffering from an overdose of his grace. Once we are assured you will not try to harm yourself or anyone else and that the excess grace has worked its way out of your system, we will release you from your restraints and allow you to see him.”
“So what does that mean?” Sam asked. “Is he all grace, or does he have any human soul in him like MJ and Bobby?”
Dean and Castiel were standing behind Sam now, looking at the mark on Gabriel’s back. Cas took Dean’s hand, looking at the mark with reverence. Dean snorted and said, “dude, you’ve got a tramp stamp.”
"Whatever," MJ huffed. "You guys have fun planning your guy's night with Crowley. I'm gonna call Kevin and see if he has a line on Samyaza yet." She got up from the table and stomped off towards the library.
“Yeah,” Claire said with a bright smile. “She’s still alive and kicking, running the sheriff’s department there in Sioux Falls. She complains about being stuck behind a desk, but I know for a fact she loves that it gives her more time at home to help Alex and Aaron rebuild the Judah Initiative. Even though we haven’t heard from the Thule again, Aaron thinks it’s important to keep the movement going to keep the history alive.”
Dean blinked. Blinked again, thoughts swirling in his head. “Yeah. Yeah, it does, doesn’t it?” he said with a small smile. He took Cas’ hand with the one not holding the fork. “I’m glad it’s you, dude. I really am.”
"Here," Cas said, picking up the tin of Old Bay seasoning from the center of the table and shaking some onto Dean's fries, "try them like this." Dean picked up a fry and dragged it through the ketchup in his basket before popping it into his mouth, earning another pulse-ratcheting groan. "You've been holding out on me, angel," he told Cas with a wink. Cas gave him the biggest smile Dean had seen yet before going back to his own food.
conventions with the guy who plays Chuck on the show." Cas frowned, and Gabriel scoffed, muttering something about "
… in a physical relationship with Dean, he knew he didn’t require it to be bonded to him, and most likely Dean would not be interested in an intimate relationship with him due to his vessel being male and previous proclamations that the hunter was not gay.
“Ah, so Dean-o couldn’t stand you wanting to be the best,” Gabriel smiled. “Good on you, cuz. Keep being yourself no matter who you’re with.”
Maintaining the contact between his thumb and middle finger, Sam started a slow pace up and down Gabriel's shaft. After a few strokes, he hissed as he felt Gabriel's smaller hand try to wrap around his own dick, moving at a slightly faster pace.
“Yeah, so do we,” Dean said. He waited until Bobby unplugged his ears and he had Sam and Gabriel’s attention. “Crowley called a couple hours ago, said he has information on Lucifer’s new prom dress.
Dean deftly worked one finger into Cas' ass, pulling the most sinful sounds from the angels mouth. In no time he worked a second finger, then a third, into Cas, making his back arch and his hips rock into his fingers. When Cas uttered another "Dean" in a strained, pleading voice, Dean pulled his fingers out and lubed up his cock before lining up.
Between Sam's hands on his wings and Dean's cock in his ass, Castiel was overloaded with sensation. He ground down onto Dean's dick, his fingers in the hunter's hair as lightning bolts of pleasure skated across his nervous system. When Dean's hands made their way down to his backside to start lifting up and dropping him back down on his erection, Castiel questioned himself for not doing this before. He absolutely adored the feel of Dean inside and all around him, his touch all over his skin. He began riding Dean's dick in earnest without his help, crying out each time Dean hit deep inside him. The faster he went, the hard he thrust down, the more pleasurable the feeling. When Sam grasped a handful of his feathers and gently tugged at them, it was like an attack on his synapses lighting him up and blacking him out at the same time. Cas screamed Dean's name as he shot ropes of come across the man's chest.
“Did you like that gorgeous?” Gabriel whispered. Sam didn’t open his eyes, didn’t say a word, just nodded. “Open your eyes for me.”
“Alright gorgeous, time to do your arms,” Gabriel said, running his hands up and down Sam’s arms. “I’m going to tie them behind your back, starting at your wrists and going up to just above your elbows. Are you okay with this?”
“I don’t know what you’re bitching and moaning about, but you need to chill the fuck out,” Sammy said sternly, pointing a finger at him. “Cas is coming by to practice tonight, and we need to start tightening down your pieces. We’ve only got about 2 months left before the benefit.”
“Sorry, cuz,” Gabriel replied, popping a Dum-Dum sucker from between his lips. “You already made the commitment, and I can’t find anyone else to take yours and Deano’s spot. Like it or not, you guys are gonna have to play together, preferably nicely.” He crunched the rest of the sucker between his back teeth, using the stick to get the bits of candy unstuck from the creviced surfaces. “Besides, it’s for charity. Are you really gonna bail on a
“You couldn’t keep your eyes, or your hands, off Uncle Cas’ codpiece.” Bobby said, waggling his eyebrows. And now Dean was picturing Cas in tight leather breeches and a white tunic, black knee-high riding boots, the only thing between him and his codpiece a single lace of leather.
Gabriel chuckled at that. He propped himself up to look into his beloved’s eyes, and with a sideways smile asked, “is there anything good in that gift basket?”
“I was just coming to talk to Bobby,” he said, then turned to his son. “How’ve you been doing? You’ve been really quiet lately.”
Sam cleared his throat to get Jody's attention. She looked over and saw Sam standing next to a short blonde man, holding his hand. Dean had his arm slung over the shoulder of a man just inches shy of Dean's height with black hair and the bluest eyes she'd ever seen. She knew this had to be Castiel. Claire had an old family photo of herself, her mom, and her dad, whose body Castiel inhabited. She raised one eyebrow at them all. "Something you boys wanna tell me?"
was an unwelcome thought in Dean’s mind, when associated with his little brother. So until Sam came up for air, Dean occupied himself with introducing MJ and Bobby to
“You’re the guy from the park,” Bobby said, garnering looks from the rest of the room. “Who are you?”
“Why you little brat!” Lucifer seethed, grabbing the lapels of Gabriel’s coat, “always gotta go stealing big brother’s toys.”
“This is not how I wanted to spend my birthday,” she sobbed into Mary’s shoulder. Dean tentatively came up behind her and started rubbing small circles on her back. She choked out a sob and turned to wrap her arms around Dean. He held her back and took over trying to console her.
"Other than rewriting the second act, she hasn't done anything new," Dean replied. "What about Becky?"
MJ and Dean in grungy jeans and tees, covered in grease, standing in front of a beat up old Chevelle with their arms crossed over their chests. This must be the car they fixed up together.
This morning he woke to Gabriel spooning him, planting kisses along the back of his neck while his fingers traced a lazy path along Sam's ribs. Sam sighed and snuggled back into Gabriel, feeling the angel’s erection pressing into his lower back.
“I swear to Dad,” Gabriel said as solemnly as he could with the big grin on his face. “If you don’t like it, I’ll never ask you to do it again.”
Sam stared at Gabriel all bug-eyed and mouth opening and closing like a fish, not really sure he heard that correctly.
Castiel seemed to consider that a moment, still looking at Sam. With no discernible change in his expression, he simply said, "show me."
“Look at these pictures of the people who were affected,” he said, his fingers moving deftly over the tablet pulling up the photos.
MJ walked quickly into the room, fiddling with an earring as she entered. “Hey Kev, sorry I’m-” she slowed down and stopped as she saw her dads and her uncles in the room. She was wearing a short, slinky dark purple dress and black heels that made her as tall as Kevin, a black sequined purse hanging from her shoulder by a silver chain. Her normal ponytail was absent and her hair cascaded down her back. Dean eyed her with a little shock on his face.
no.” Cas looked at him with a bitchface to rival Sam’s. “Dean,” he said sternly, “we must consider all options before rejecting Crowley’s request. If Lucifer still poses a threat to the children, we will need all information available in order to send him back to the cage.”
“In my stomach,” Cas responded, as if the question wasn’t meant to be humorous. That made Dean laugh even more.
“Take what you can get,” Dean responded, still looking off into the trees. “We don’t get much happy in our life, nature of the beast. But somehow we found a little. Hold onto that, and then whenever you get that little feeling inside you that tells you that you gotta do something, then chase it. For me, I’m good until I get the itch that something’s gotta be done about the shit no one else will deal with. For you? I’d say just do what you always do, and listen for whatever it was that drew you to that girl’s prayers. It’s not perfect, but it’s what you can do without destroying yourself or your family.”
Dean was flabbergasted. If Cas hadn’t had sex since college, then that means he’d been dry for at least three or four years. He couldn’t fathom going that long without sex.
hurts.” He slid his sword into a scabbard hanging at his left side and took another couple of steps back. “Love you Sam,” he said with a sad smile.
Gabriel stepped back with a gasp, looking over his shoulder trying to see his back. For a few seconds, he looked like a dog trying to chase his tail, until Sam grabbed his shoulders and stopped him. Sam turned him around to see a Sam-sized handprint on Gabriel’s lower back. “Gabe?” Sam asked him, unsure of what he was asking.
Dean smirked, oddly similar to Gabriel's trickster smile. "I don't know about Gabe, but I know Cas can get pretty loud."
Sam nodded at his brother and left to grab the lube he kept in his room. Part of him knew this was slightly fucked up, but he didn't have it in him to care. Maybe it was the compulsion, maybe it was the after-effects of what he did with Cas that morning, but
He forced himself not to be overwhelmed, but to take what Cas was feeling and soothe it. He focused on warming the cold spots and cooling the hot spots, painting over the angry reds and blacks with white light to soften the edges, pushing his own feelings of love and loss and guilt at his own choices leading to this disaster and forgiveness of what Castiel deemed his own fault. He wrapped Cas’ pain with his own, not taking it from him but letting him know he wasn’t alone, would never be alone. And the angel fell into his arms, releasing his own tears as the two men sank to the floor and held onto each other for dear life.
They started after they last saw Jody, after Lucifer took over Castiel but before they had a bead on the Darkness. They talked about meeting God, the soul-bomb they didn't need because Dean embraced his inner Dr. Phil, Amara bringing back Mary, the British Men of Letters taking Sam, their search for him, their rescue that was aborted by the reemergence of the Thule, the Men of Letters allowing the Winchesters to continue their work (provisionally), coming back to Kansas, settling in with their mom and being interrupted by the appearance of the kids, and everything that has happened since their arrival. The only thing they left out was Gabriel's pregnancy and how it ended, because it was still too fresh of a wound. By the time they finished, Jody had knocked back two beers and was eyeing a third. Dean thought about suggesting whiskey.
He got home after rehearsals Friday evening and, as always, set his mom’s cello next to his electric one. Sam wasn’t giving any lessons that afternoon, but he was scribbling away putting the finishing touches on his arrangement of
“To talk,” MJ told him. “We would have tried this first if we thought our dads would have listened to us, but in case you hadn’t noticed they’re more into ‘shoot now, ask questions never’. They talk big about family, but they seem to have conveniently forgotten that you’re family, too.”
“That’s his own damned fault, isn’t it? Hell, Sam and I tried to have a sit-down with him and God so they could hash their shit out, but he’s hell-bent on being a giant dick!”
Bobby stood up, raised one hand, quirked his eyebrow, and smirked at Gabriel. He snapped and Gabriel found himself sitting on a three-legged stool with his hands folded in his lap and wearing a dunce cap. “Let me know when you start acting like one and I’ll think about it.” No matter how hard he tried, Gabriel couldn't move.
MJ curtsied to Gabriel and said, “Mary Jo Winchester-pie aficionado and hunter extraordinaire, at your service.”
Sam was surprised they had any kind of friends in the future, let alone family friends. That would imply these people would know they bonded with angels. Angels in male vessels. And they were cool with it. "Like who?"
Castiel himself had his regularly scheduled practice plans with Kevin on Saturday evening, but other than that his weekend was free. He had hoped that Dean would be available, but he had been advised that Dean and Charlie had standing plans that couldn’t be changed (although Dean insisted he would if he could). He filled the rest of his weekend watching James Cagney movies, practicing his challenge piece, and practicing
All the abnormal activity they caused in the area seemed to draw a large number of hunters. None of them knew that the Winchester's base of operations was in the area, just assuming Lebanon was a hotspot because it was the geographical center of the United States. Sam and Dean were of opposing positions on this; Dean didn't want anyone not family anywhere near the bunker, while Sam saw this as an opportunity to make the bunker a central location for hunters to access the large library of lore they inherited.
In an instant, Dean was sitting next to Sam on the couch, hand on his brother's arm to calm his fears. "Hey," he said softly, voice hoarse, "I'm not gonna die on you. Not like this." Dean couldn't stand seeing the fear in his little brother's eyes. It had been ingrained in him for as long as he could remember, take care of Sammy. He had to do something to soothe his nerves.
Practice went great again, as it had been since he and Cas had been getting along better. He chuckled to himself about just how well they’d been
“I believe so,” he said somewhat nervously. “However, I was hoping for your assistance with something.”
“We did the angel thing, we bonded, but even if I’m not gonna get old or die or anything because of that, I’m still human. And humans do things differently.” Still palming the box, he flipped the lid open with his thumb before showing Castiel the ring inside, angel wings etched into the simple silver band. “I know that because you’re an angel we can’t legally get married or anything like that, but I love you, and I want everyone to know you’re my husband.”
“Because if I don’t, no one will know the truth. This could happen again, to anyone.” Rose looked forward again, towards the base. “I will not let this happen to anyone else. I will grab the nearest officer and tell them
“I believe my ‘inner geek’ and ‘outer geek’ are one in the same,” Castiel chuckled. “As for movie night, I believe I’ll join you. Anything in particular I should bring?”
“Family, kinda,” he said, resting his elbows on the guitar and facing the man. “They were disappointed when, ah… one of my projects… didn’t turn out the way it was supposed to. I know I didn’t screw it up, but I still feel like I let them down.”
Sam stared his brother dead in the eye and very evenly said, "you heard me. More to the point, we heard you. Sounded pretty damned consensual to me."
Once his brain started, it wouldn’t shut off. Why was Cas so focused on work? Why did he avoid having a social life? Why did it take him so long to get laid? Why didn’t the man smile? Most importantly, why did Dean all of a sudden care?
Dean and Castiel entered the war room, Dean carrying two presents under his arms. “Where’s the birthday boy at?” Dean called out to his brother. “I’m ready to get this party started.” He looked over at the table, seeing only the cake. “Where’s the rest of the food? We gotta have more than just cake.”
Cas slowly pulled his grace back as he pounded brutally into Dean, his hands pulling Dean’s thighs against him with each thrust. Dean could barely catch his breath, crying out like a whore with every hit. His hands fisted in the sheets besides him and his head thrashed from side to side, tears streaming down his face. He didn’t have any power over his brain or his body as he screamed again, hips arching into Cas as he came untouched. Castiel just kept pumping into Dean harder and harder, faster and faster until he came with a roar of his true angelic voice, blasting all the lightbulbs and glass in the room before collapsing onto Dean’s chest.
“We’re not dealing, Crowley,” Dean said, shrugging the demon’s hand off his shoulder. “You let them out, or we kill you.”
Castiel had been excited to challenge Dean for First Chair on more even footing, trying to match his playing style instead of finding a piece that played against his weaker points. He had thought Dean would be happy he would be challenged on his merits instead of his weaknesses, but now he was beginning to doubt that. As rehearsal progressed, Dean became more distant and aggressive with his playing.
"Wing kink?" Dean's gaze snapped to his brother, staring at him like he was speaking a foreign language.
He’d get his chair back today, though. He knew from watching the man for the past two years that Cas was uncomfortable with intricate bow work. Not only was
Sam pointed at the guitar Bobby was still holding. “What kind of music did Gabriel teach you how to play?”
What he hadn’t expected was to feel a warm, wet rag dragging over his thighs. He looked up to see Dean, face cleaned off and pants pulled up but not buttoned, gently cleaning their mess off his thighs.  When Dean looked up and caught Castiel’s eye, he gave a sheepish grin.
MJ got out the Twister mat and they all explained the rules and how the game was played to Cas before playing a few rounds, laughing as they slid around and tried to knock each other over. Dean swore Gabriel was using his grace to cheat, because Gabriel always seemed to be the last one standing. They decided to call the game and move on to food when Sam ended up on his back with Gabriel straddling him, and making out was imminent.
“I’m gonna do a very chick-flick-y kinda thing, so you gotta let me get through this before you say anything,” Dean said with a woosh of the breath he was holding. “Also, just so you know, it’s really me, so don’t try to exorcise anything out of me, okay?”
Dean’s jaw practically hit the floor. He looked at Castiel as though he were from another planet. He laid one warm hand on Castiel’s forearm and pleaded, “tell me you’ve at least seen Star Wars, right?”
Introductions were made, hands were shaken, condolences given, information exchanged. He informed the Winchesters that Lady Toni and the hunters had taken down the Grigori Batraal at Stonehenge. Lady Toni and the hunters were there investigating reported supernatural activity, but if it coincided with Batraal’s presence was anyone’s guess. After some brief speculation, they said their good-byes, but not before the Old Man shook Sam’s hand and leaned into him, whispering “there will always be a place for you here, Samuel.” Sam just nodded, not replying in either the affirmative or negative.
“Oh, my personal favorite is Elvis Presley. Most people think he’s dead,” Bobby said, waggling his eyebrows. “Truth is, Pops had gotten him a little too drunk one night on Norse meade. Couldn’t take him back like that so he stuck an impersonator in his place. Impersonator died on the toilet, Elvis got a free pass to stay in Fólkvangr drinking and getting laid by Valkyries. He’s still there.”
MJ scrambled off the bed and ran to hug her dad. He gently put the baby in her arms and said, "meet your brother" with a smile. She held him close, gently bouncing him around and cooing nonsense at him.
the position of First Chair. We both did.” Castiel took Dean’s hand and for the first time in his life stood up to his mother for what
"Huh," Gabriel said, "I didn't think about that. Something to ask Kevin about. I'd rather ask dear old Dad, but he's still on his family vacation with Auntie Amara. There's no other angel upstairs I'd trust knowing about this."
Novak, the straight-laced, buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules classical cellist that had been a pain in Dean’s ass  since he showed up. Cas
