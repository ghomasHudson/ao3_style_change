The woman turned her nose up at them, but the kid smiled softly and waved as he followed her to the car. Dean sighed and crossed the few feet to Castiel, wrapping an arm around his waist.
Dean darted behind a display of scythes and broomsticks. He wasn’t out of angelic hearing range, but it was better than nothing. “I was hoping I could chalk some on the front windows, door and the signs on the gate along with some bio-hazard tape or something?”
“You… is that what you were thinking about so deeply before?”
He’s only actually kept waiting for about half an hour. One of the men on the company’s board, Bartholomew, leaves Luke’s office with a scowl on his face, and Luke doesn’t look to be in a better mood. He waves Castiel into his office, running a hand through his own hair. It’s messy and he looks disheveled. That doesn’t bode well.
“I’ll talk to him as soon as I can, Mr. Novak, I—” Charlie stops mid-sentence when she spots Dean in the waiting room. “Actually, why don’t you have a seat in the waiting room and give me a moment to speak with Dean, if that’s alright? I have a feeling you’ll want to talk to each other.”
Despite Charlie’s reassurances, the minute Castiel walks through the door—with Meg, nonetheless—all his nerves return full force and it nearly knocks him to his knees. Still, Charlie’s right, he doesn’t have anything to worry about. With that thought in mind, Dean plasters a grin on his face and hands two tickets to Castiel. “Glad you could make it, man.”
“Knot me and then mate me, alpha,” Dean murmurs against his neck, lips curling in a smirk when his alpha shivers.
Cas worried at the corner of his lip with his teeth. He shrugged. “I may have called Sam.”
Castiel hums, snuggling against Dean’s side and grabbing a cookie. “I hope so, the meta episodes are the most enjoyable.”
Dean can’t shake what they’ve said for the rest of the week. Every time he sees Cas now, the little voice in the back of his mind gets louder. It’s been there for a couple of months now, whispering
“Dean? Are you okay?” Charlie’s voice bounces off the tile walls in the bathroom, making Dean’s head ring.
Missouri smacks his knee gently. “Do I need to be?”
Dean grins and pulls Cas close, kissing him softly. “You’re amazing.”
“You’re… not Meg,” Novak says, eyes narrowed at Dean in obvious suspicion. “Can I help you?”
“Oh for—Luke, we’re equally known as the faces of the company. I’ve had hundreds of offers from competing companies and I’ve stayed because you’re my brother and I want this to work, but I want to take one house from beginning to end. Just one. If I don’t ace it, then I’ll go back to my office and keep designing houses behind the scenes.”
Castiel smiles. “Hello, Dean.”
Castiel smiles. It’s been far too long since he’s spoken to Meg. “I actually wanted to ask you a favor, but you can’t tell anyone.”
“I really am sorry. I don’t know what came over me.”
Dean grins, leaning against the counter. “I’m sure that could be arranged.”
Dean frowns. He hadn’t exactly thought that far ahead, but Cas makes a good point. Would he really want to leave his pups for weeks at a time? His alpha? “Huh. I guess I’d have to talk to Charlie about that. I’d be out of a job.”
Dean held up a finger to silence Cas before he uttered another name.
his alpha.
“For the love of…because, we aren’t staying here in Sioux Falls. What part of we’re here until Sam has sorted things out back at the bunker, then you and I are going back to Kansas don’t you understand.”
“It doesn’t have to be such a big deal, y’know. If he says no, he says no, and if he says yes, awesome. Just… don’t get your hopes up, you may be wrong about him liking me.”
. “Hey, so if I asked you to get dinner before the episode… would you be down for that? As a date?”
“Fuck, Dean, gonna breed you so full of pups, I can’t wait to see you swollen with them. You’ll be breathtaking.”
“Yeah. Strangest thing happened right after we started this conversation. I lost my appetite.”
How could Cas make getting a Hy-Vee gift card sound so exciting? The adorable, dorky angel.
Castiel’s promise does nothing to assuage Dean’s nerves, but he agrees nonetheless. “What’s up?”
Dean grinned before pressing a kiss to Castiel’s forehead. He dropped the ax off in the shadows of his hiding spot, passing Castiel an old, rusted metal pipe that fitted the aesthetic they were going for. He ducked back into his hiding spot while Castiel carefully melted back into the shadows, shooting Dean a ridiculous wink as he slid the Jason mask back over his face. Dean fiddled with the smoke machine for a moment, getting a thin layer of smoke rolling out over the entrance to the yard, and sat back to wait.
“For how much? ‘Cause we could spend way more than whatever they’re offering buying shit we don’t need and will NEVER use again.”
Dean stumbled into the kitchen drawn by the alluring scent of coffee and bacon. He’d barely got a hand on the cupboard door to grab his mug when a piece of paper was slapped down on the counter in front of him.
Dean grins as he makes Cas’s drink—a hot butterbeer with whipped cream and cinnamon—and chuckles to himself. “He’s stressed, but I know he’ll be fine. Kid’s a genius. Besides, he’s clear to graduate, so it doesn’t really matter how he does on his finals.”
“You’ve been to these before, haven’t you? Where would you recommend starting? What’s most essential to the enjoyment of this particular festival?”
Dean shoots a glare at his brother as Rowena snickers. “You both suck. Just… behave. Please? I actually like this guy, I don’t want you scaring him off.”
They snuggle in silence for a while until the next wave of Castiel’s rut overcomes him. They spend the next few hours getting him through the early part of his rut, both of them collapsing into bed near midnight, utterly exhausted.
A few of the people near them glance over at Charlie’s outburst and Dean winces, shrinking down in his seat. He should’ve told Charlie, it’s protocol, but he’d been embarrassed and disgusted with himself for being so unprofessional. He didn’t want Charlie to look at him the way he’d been looking at himself for the last three weeks.
The alpha is on him in less than a second, yanking Dean into the apartment and shoving him up against the door, immediately scenting him.
“No, he’s… indisposed right now. S’it cool if I take these inside?”
Dean scoffs. “Sam needs to keep his mouth shut. I haven’t been gushing about anyone. This is a casual first date, don’t make it something it’s not. We’re not getting mated, for fuck’s sake.”
The rest of their Valentine’s is spent on the couch, snuggled under their favorite fluffy blanket, their TV long forgotten in the background in favor of getting lost in each other.
Eventually, Castiel knots him, though this time it’s far more intense. Dean’s omega howls with pleasure, though Dean quickly bites his bottom lip to keep himself quiet. This time he definitely catches a glimpse of Castiel’s fangs as the alpha’s knot pops, though Castiel quickly turns his head away and clamps his mouth shut. His omega is screaming for him to bare his neck and let his alpha claim him but he sternly reminds himself that Castiel
Missouri shoots him an exasperated look. “He triggered pining sickness in you. Tell me, you’ve been through how many alphas in your years of doing this job? How many of them have triggered pining sickness?” Dean doesn’t answer, so Missouri huffs. “If that doesn’t at least make him a candidate for true mate, I don’t know what does.”
“Dean? Come on! There are so many different themes we could use. I need you to help me choose which one, or ones, will be the most pertinent to an authentic human Halloween experience.” Cas tugged at Dean’s jacket sleeve. “Hello, Sam. Say hi to my brother from me.”
Castiel handed over the ax, a mischievous expression lighting up his face. “Deal. We should get everything ready; I can hear some kids heading this way.”
He’s been around Charlie long enough to know that the look she’s giving him means he’s just said something monumentally stupid. “Dude, are you kidding me? On the days you’re not here, it’s like he’s moping around. I hate to break it to you, but he comes here for you, not for your muffins.”
“Alright, don’t go spiraling now, Winchester. I’m gay and even
, and Dean’s not really sure how to feel about that. Had she been expecting him to fall for a client this entire time? He thought he’d been a model employee, always treating his alpha clients well and catering to their every need during their ruts, no matter how strange.
, the highest-grossing HGTV show on the planet. It’s a force to be reckoned with and it’s launched the careers of more than a few contractors and house-flipping enterprises. Their company, Angelic Houses, has even hired a few people from the show. It pits two teams against each other and it takes the teams and the audience through the entire process—picking the house they’re going to flip, the process of actually designing the house and constructing the design in the real world, and getting it on the market and sold. It’s the exact process Castiel wants to be a part of, given the opportunity, so he flips through the documents in the folder. It would pit him against Luke, which was rather obvious, given the circumstances. He’d have to find his own team since it would technically be him against Angelic Houses, which is moderately worrying. The only contractors he knows are the ones that work for the company, he’s not even sure where he would begin trying to find a team he could trust enough to execute his eventual design, not to mention go against all the talented contractors employed by Angelic Houses.
Dean gapes at him. Cas can’t really be asking him out, can he? He knows they’re not allowed on public dates while he’s paying for Dean’s… services. “I—”
“Sonovabitch! Fine, you win. We’ll decorate the old place…” Dean stopped as an insane idea began to form in his mind. What if…no…that would be like painting a neon sign over their heads…but then again…was it too early for a little hunter’s helper? It wasn’t even 10 o’clock, and Dean was done with the day.
Dean flips through the file absentmindedly, skimming through the background check and application before flipping to the picture. She’s pretty, he won’t deny that. He samples her scent and immediately wrinkles his nose, sliding out of the booth and rushing for the bathroom. He empties the contents of his stomach into the toilet—which, admittedly, isn’t much—and gives himself a moment to breathe. He’s never reacted to an alpha’s scent like that before. Sure, there have been scents that have been unappealing, but actually vomiting because of them? No way.
Sneaky angel. He had a point; they could drop in on Jody once in a while and swinging past Bobby’s wouldn’t be a hardship. Hell, it was Jody who was helping them, and a few other trusted hunters, keep Bobby’s place habitable.
“Gods, Dean,” Cas groans, grabbing onto Dean’s thighs and hauling him up. Dean’s naked skin doesn’t feel great rubbing against Cas’s clothes, but he can’t be bothered to care. All he cares about is getting his alpha to bed and getting those clothes off of him. Castiel seems to have the same mindset because he presses a kiss to Dean’s forehead and heads directly for their bedroom, dropping Dean onto the bed before haphazardly stripping down and pulling Dean into a rough kiss that’s all teeth and tongue but Dean doesn’t care.
“The company covers the cost of breaking accidental mating bonds,” Dean answers with a shrug, turning to pull Castiel close and kiss him gently. He doesn’t add that he wouldn’t exactly mind being mated to the alpha, if he asked.
“Dean, I don’t
“So he’s cute, huh? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you trying to impress someone this hard. Your apartment is spotless!”
There it is, the conversation he’s been waiting for. Before Castiel can actually consider him for a mate, he’s gotta agree to give up his job. His silence must be rather telling because Cas starts to shift away from him, but then there’s a finger under his chin making him look up at his alpha, who has a reassuring smile on his face.
Meg scoffs. “I am
“Dude, right?” Dean’s grin widens impossibly and he shuffles his seat closer to Castiel’s. “So crazy. What about—”
Castiel’s answering grin is blindingly bright and it’s the cutest thing Dean’s ever seen in the world. He could die happy right now knowing that he caused that smile. “I’d love to.”
“So how did you get into this line of work?” Castiel asks as they’re lounging on the couch, scrolling through their options on the DVR. “I assume because you like sex, but was that the only reason?”
“And for the lady?”
The festival was in full swing. It was chilly out for October, though not so much that they were cold in their jackets. Well, Dean wasn’t cold in his jacket, at least. The cold winds do nothing to Castiel but tussle his already messy hair.
Castiel frowns and reaches across the table to rest his hand over Dean’s, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m so sorry, Dean.”
“So? What’s the verdict, Cas? Still taste like molecules?”
Dean snorts. “Your rut, dude. That was the first knot of your rut, right? Aren’t they always the most intense?”
That shit was as lethal as Sam’s puppy eyes, goddammit!
“Afternoon, boys. Here for a cup of cider? It’s all made from local apples,” she said with a conspiratorial wink, pushing two cups toward them. Castiel hesitated, so Dean grabbed the cups and passed one to Cas, shooting the woman a smile.
sweaty alpha. His hair is matted to his forehead, he’s got at least two days worth of stubble, and he’s wearing an old, fluffy gray robe that leaves exactly nothing to the imagination since he hasn’t bothered to tie it shut. It hangs open around jutting hip bones and a flushed, sweaty chest that’s currently inflating as Novak scents the air. Everything about the sight in front of him has Dean’s mouth watering.
Dean drew in a deep breath. The things he did to keep Cas happy would worry him if he wasn’t so damn happy about them finally being ‘together’ together.
They explored the rest of the festival, though there isn’t a lot to see. Sioux Falls is a small town, the autumn festival was likely something they put on to promote local businesses. There were a few carnival games that the kids of the town crowded around, along with picnic tables where the adults gathered eating what smells like barbecue. Castiel insisted on looking at the stall of a local beekeeper and the thought alone gives Dean chest pains. The last time Castiel had been obsessed with bees hadn’t exactly been the best time of their lives, though Castiel assured him that he only wanted some fresh honey for the tea he’d taken to drinking at night. They did end up leaving with a warm, homemade apple pie, though, so Dean counted the excursion as a win.
“Dean? Are you okay?” Castiel murmurs, nose bumping Dean’s jaw. Dean nods quickly, forcing a smile onto his face as he opens his eyes to look up at the alpha.
“Thanks. I was just, uh… I figured you could use some rest, so I was gonna put everything away.”
Benny gives him a knowing smirk but stands and grabs his blanket, following Dean back to the other side of the courtyard. Dean grabs himself a bag of popcorn and a cupcake and follows Castiel to his spot on the courtyard lawn, grinning to himself when he sees that Castiel brought along a Dr. Sexy blanket.
“Yeah, she’s got a client in there, apparently he’s got a problem with his omega.”
Castiel is
They don’t pack up until around midnight. Charlie’s passed out on the couch, Jo and Benny are basically holding each other up, and Sam and Rowena are putting the last of the snacks away. Dean heaves himself off the floor to say goodnight to his friends, closing the door behind them. It leaves just him and Cas there, alone, and Dean barely has the energy to smile at Cas, much less do anything else with him, no matter how much he wants to. The alpha smiles at him, wringing his hands. That’s… weird. He’s never seen Cas do that before. Is he… nervous?
of the lock and the door swings open to reveal a very disheveled and
“Hm.” Cas smiles and takes a sip of his butterbeer. “I think I’ll take one of those, too.”
Castiel scents his neck, not-so-subtly scent-marking Dean’s jaw. “Thank you for coming again. I know you were… apprehensive about returning last time you were here.”
Dean shivers, grinding his ass back against the bulge in Cas’s pants. “Well c’mon then, alpha, show me what you got.”
“If you’re sure. I am.”
“I used to be like that.” Castiel hums, shrugging. “The last few years, I’ve been nesting during my ruts, which is… odd, to say the least. I don’t exactly have time to find a mate, much less have pups. I suppose this is my alpha’s way of showing his displeasure that we have no one to care for,” he says with a wry smile, head tilted to the side as he watches Dean. There’s a glint of something in his eyes, though Dean can’t exactly put his finger on what it is.
Because any opportunity to get under Cas’s skin about Dean never being punctual was an opportunity not to be missed, Dean unlocked Baby twelve minutes after he had gone to take his shower.
Castiel’s eyes flash at that, but he forces himself farther away. “I need a proper answer, Dean. I won’t take advantage of you just because you’re in heat. Do you want to stay here? I’d be happy to share your heat with you.”
“Oh, I don’t. I mentioned your D&D sessions to Meg and she’s been looking for people to play with. I figured I’d tag along and observe, if that’s okay? I’ve never actually seen D&D before.”
Cas huffed. “But that is not what Halloween is really all about, is it? It is about the souls of the dead, the…veil being between this world and the other being thinnest.  Did I get that correct?”
“Alpha, breathe,” Dean says with a chuckle, placing a hand over Castiel’s. “I would love to go on an actual date with you. It doesn’t have to be fancy, though. I don’t care about that stuff. Just a burger and maybe a good movie is fine.”
Castiel hums and takes his drink from Dean, taking a sip and sighing happily. “That’s good. Congratulations to him.”
It was dusk by the time they’d finished — perfect timing if Dean did say so himself. The judges should have been starting their tour. He can see a few of the nearby houses letting their kids out for trick-or-treating. Dean shot Cas a mischievous smile and flicked off all the lights save for the one on the front fence to let trick-or-treaters know they were home. Now all they had to do was wait.
. I just get paid to let alphas use me during their ruts, no way is he...” He can’t bring himself to say the words
Cas pulled out a chair and sat down, picking at Dean’s leftover breakfast. Funny how food tasting like molecules didn't stop Cas from eating things Dean liked.
“You look… wow,” Dean finally gets out, letting his eyes skate the length of the alpha’s body once more before he meets the smirk on his face.
Castiel frowns, thumb idly brushing the bandage. “Still not an excuse. I could have accidentally mated you, Dean, why aren’t you more concerned?”
over and over in the back of Dean’s mind. It’s annoying and it only makes Dean more upset than he already is.
Cas visibly deflates, shoulders sagged with relief,.. and grins at Dean, bringing his hand to his mouth and kissing Dean’s knuckles gently. “That sounds perfect.
It dawns on Dean then that he wants to be one of those things for Castiel. He wants Cas enthralled with him, he wants to hear himself spoken about the way Cas speaks about things he loves. They’ve never actually said that to each other and the overwhelming urge to tell Castiel nearly overpowers him, but he keeps his mouth tightly shut. He wants it to be a special moment, not just lounging on Castiel’s couch one Thursday night.
Dean follows the alpha down the hallway into a cozy bedroom with a huge four-poster king-sized bed in the center of one wall, like something you might find in a castle. There’s a pile of pillows against the headboard and an enormous blanket nest in the center of the bed, which is strange, to say the least. Alphas using a service usually don’t want to settle down, so they don’t usually nest during ruts. It’s not really his place to bring that up, though, so Dean examines the room as he sets his bag down. On one side of the bed is a comfy-looking sitting area with a black lounger sofa. There’s a couple of different game consoles plugged in beneath the TV and an honest to gods record player hooked up to speakers. Sure enough, he finds a bookshelf filled to the brim with records, everything from old classics like Beethoven all the way to Ed Sheeran’s latest album. The other side of the bed gives way to another bookshelf stacked with books and a comfy, red leather armchair with a couple of pillows on it. This is basically Dean’s ideal bedroom, should he ever be rich. Shaking that thought away, he turns to Novak and smiles. “How long do you typically have between spikes?”
“We’ll just have to see if the kids enjoy it, then. The whole point of Halloween is scares and chocolate, after all,” Dean said as he steps out from behind his perch, shooting Castiel a reassuring smile. “Besides, we thought the competition would be fun, but we decorated for the kids.”
Eventually, once his knot goes down, Castiel rolls him onto his back and kisses him deeply, warm hands roaming every available inch of his skin. Dean melts into the soft touches, purring softly as his alpha lavishes him with attention.
Charlie looks displeased but doesn’t say anything as she scribbles something in her notepad. “He doesn’t want her back. He specifically asked for you to be his regular.”
Dean laughs. “Well, you’re always welcome to come here and wallow, as long as you don’t scare my other customers away.”
That went well.
“So, I brought a batch of cookies and—” Dean pulls the thermos from his bag with a grin, holding it out to Castiel. “A butterbeer, of course.”
“Nothing happened, okay? I chickened out,” he mutters, shoving the girls’ money in the lockbox. “It’s just… not the right time, alright? It’s fine.”
“Close the door behind you, Castiel.”
Dean huffs, crossing his arms over his chest. Frankly, he could probably benefit from some therapy, but there’s no way he’s admitting that to Missouri, she’d march him right into the therapist’s office herself. “He’s probably not even my true mate anyway. Aren’t those, like, super rare?”
Dean blinked, trying to get his eyes to open.
He takes his time examining the alpha’s apartment. He figures Castiel could use the rest; a little more time away from the alpha while he sleeps certainly couldn’t hurt. Besides, he’s curious.
“Dean? Dean, wake up.”
“Clarence, to what do I owe the pleasure? It’s usually your stuffy older brothers chatting me up, it must be serious if you’re calling me.”
Dean shakes his head. “I brought some snacks, I’m sure whatever you get will be fine. I can cook if you want.”
Castiel growls again, though this one is much wilder than the last. Castiel’s clearly lost control and Dean doesn't know whether to be terrified or aroused. His body decides both, heart pounding and adrenaline coursing through his veins as Castiel’s cock slides into him. He moans loudly, forehead thumping against the counter and he closes his eyes and lets himself be used.
They took the rest of the afternoon to set up the decorations around the property. Castiel was tasked with painting the sigils around the windows of the house and even on the old stacks of cars. He was always better at that anyway, and Dean tended to have more patience with technology than Castiel. The last thing they needed was Castiel getting annoyed with the decorations and smiting them. Castiel didn’t laugh when Dean said as much, but Dean still grinned at him anyway.
Charlie frowns but slides him the file nonetheless. “Lisa, 28. She’s got a little boy and she’s tired of dating so she wants to try out our services for her next rut.”
Dean pushes himself from his seat when Charlie crooks a finger at him, following her into her office as Castiel makes himself comfortable in the same seat Dean had vacated. She closes the door behind them, gesturing for Dean to take a seat. “Pining sickness, right?”
Dean squirms a bit underneath the alpha as his heat properly hits him, beads of sweat breaking out on his forehead as he whimpers softly. “Alpha, please.”
Dean whines softly, clutching at the alpha and pulling him closer. “Cas, please, wanna stay, want you so bad,” he whines, relief flooding through his body as Castiel leans down to kiss him.
Castiel’s knot is barely popped before he’s sinking his teeth into Dean’s neck, right over his scent gland. Dean’s vision whites out and he gives himself a moment to enjoy all the mating hormones rushing through his body before he turns and sinks his teeth into Cas’s neck in return. The kiss that follows is tangy and wet but Dean couldn’t care less, not with a fresh mating bite on his neck and the perfect alpha to spend the rest of his life with.
Castiel’s eyes meet Dean’s and he smiles softly, nodding. “Of course. Thank you, Ms. Bradbury.”
“Hell yeah,” Dean answers with an even wider grin, tugging Cas to the table.
Dean blinks up at him. “You have sisters?”
“What’s that supposed to be?” Cas asks, head tilted to the side in an adorably puppy-like fashion. He’s staring at the cupcakes Dean had painstakingly been decorating all morning.
“Perfect little omega,” Castiel murmurs, hands stroking down Dean’s sides.
Dean shrugs. “I’ve got a couple of ideas. Why, did you want something in particular?”
Dean cocks an eyebrow, slipping a hand in his pocket. “And how long ago was your last spike?”
Charlie shoots him a wry smile. “Cas?”
“You’d prefer candy to pie?”
Dean whimpers, fisting the sheets as he grinds back onto Castiel’s cock. The alpha’s knot is already starting to swell, tugging at Dean’s rim every time he thrusts. It’s overwhelming in the best way and Dean can feel another orgasm starting to build already. After only a few more thrusts, Cas forces his knot into Dean one last time and comes with a howl, narrowly avoiding biting Dean’s neck as his fangs descend, instead ripping into a nearby pillow. Dean comes hard, milking Castiel’s knot. The alpha moans, turning to scent Dean’s neck gently.
“I don’t quite think you’ve unlocked my tragic backstory yet, Cas.”
to get out of there. But it’s because we had a support system. Ellen and Bobby were always there for us, we could always go to them if we needed to. So, if you can’t do anything else, you can at least be this kid’s support system.”
Dean flushes, tilting his head and smiling softly. “Uh, thanks. You smell like h-Heaven. You smell like Heaven.” His eyes slip closed as he curses silently to himself. He’d almost said home like an
The smell of
“Thank you for agreeing to come back.”
to say no. I think it was a mix of both, frankly.”
Dean shot Cas a quizzical look and mouthed, “Gabriel?”
“You look good in my kitchen.”
Castiel chuckles. “Definitely good. Go sit, the episode’s almost on, I’m just going to grab the popcorn from the microwave and then I’ll be there.”
“You… what?”
Dean makes a noncommittal noise, burying his face in Castiel’s neck as he lets exhaustion drag him under once more.
“Oh, yeah, of course. One sec.”
it, per se, but having an attractive alpha that is definitely not his mate hanging all over him is doing weird things to his hormones.
Dean shook his head. “I want both candy and pie if we’re decorating Bobby’s place like a goddamn haunted house sideshow.”
“Before you go, do I need to remind you about the dating policy?”
Dean hums. “Well, I like taking care of people, so suck it up.”
The alpha clears his throat and nods, though his cheeks are suspiciously red. “Yeah, I actually, um, wanted to talk to you. If that’s okay? It’s nothing bad, I promise.”
Suddenly, Novak leans back with a shocked expression. “Fuck, Dean, I didn’t ask, I’m so sorry!”
“Great. You finished with that?” Cas pointed to the half-eaten pancakes and bacon.
Dean raises an eyebrow, chuckling softly. “Well, as hot as you find it, we should clean up so we can actually use your kitchen while I’m here.”
Curiosity burns through him but he knows better than to interrupt a meeting with a client, so he plops down in one of the chairs to wait his turn. Imagine his surprise when he sees none other than Castiel Novak walk out of Charlie’s office, his sweet fall scent quickly filling the small waiting room outside Charlie’s office.
“Thank you, ma’am.”
Dean hums something that sounds like an agreement, but Charlie continues.
Castiel grins, finishing his granola bar in silence. Once he’s finished, he shuffles closer to Dean and begins scenting his neck, sighing happily. “You smell incredible, Dean. Like… sandalwood and lavender. It’s perfect.”
Castiel tilts his head, lips pursed. It’s the look Dean refers to as his ‘deep in thought’ look and it’s just as adorable now as it’s been every single time he’s seen it. “You’re right,” he finally says, grinning at Dean and lacing their fingers together. “Thank you, that makes me feel much better. I guess it was a good idea to come here instead of going home to wallow.”
“I want to,” Dean assures him with a shy smile, returning the kiss Castiel gives him. “‘Sides, as long as I’ve got you there, I’ll make it through the flight.” He grimaces. “Probably.”
Castiel smiles, arms slipping around Dean’s waist as he nuzzles his scent gland. “I appreciate it.”
“Dude, I don’t get why you didn’t just invite him as a date,” Charlie says as she shakes her head and refreshes the stock in the display case. “You’re obviously head over heels for the guy, just ask him out already.”
He leaves Castiel’s whiskey on the counter, too self-conscious about the price to actually open it. He’s loading up on snacks to bring while the others settle into the living room when Jo corners him, reeking of protectiveness. “So that’s Castiel, huh? The one Sam says you’ve been gushing about?”
Castiel blinks up at him, eyes clouded with sleep. Slowly, he smiles and sits up, rubbing his eyes. “Thank you. You don’t have to do that, you know. I’m fully capable of taking care of myself.”
Cas keeps his eyebrow raised, looking thoroughly unconvinced, but eventually, he lets it go and returns his attention to the finale. Dean’s missed most of it at this point, but that’s fine. He’ll watch it later on his own, he’d much rather enjoy his time with Cas anyway.
“Oh my gods, Dean, I’m so sorry, I don’t know what came over me, I—”
“Alpha,
Dinner is awesome. Everything is cooked perfectly and Cas even surprises him with a heart-shaped cherry pie he’d spent weeks learning how to make with Charlie. Dean feels kind of bad that he hadn’t spent that much time on his gift to Cas, so when he finally excuses himself after their pie to go collect his gift, he’s more than a little nervous. He returns to their living room with the folder in hand, nervously clearing his throat as he hands it to Castiel.
Cas pulls him onto the couch and snuggles against his side as he flips through the folder. He gets to the plane tickets and his eyes widen as he turns to look at Dean. “Rome? You got us a trip to Italy?”
“Well, why don’t I make us some dinner before your next spike hits, get some real food in you?”
Castiel seems to understand that Dean’s not leaving, so he pins Dean down to the bed and kisses him desperately, tongue swiping Dean’s bottom lip as one of Castiel’s hands drifts down to brush fingers over his hole. Dean’s already slick, hole clenching as he tries to entice Castiel to push his fingers in. He opens his mouth to the alpha, keening as Castiel finally pushes two fingers into him, only searching for a moment before he rubs over Dean’s prostate. It sends the omega over the edge, arching against the alpha above him.
“Cas, I can’t take this, this is too much. Why don’t you take it home and enjoy it?”
“C’mon, alpha, want you,” Dean pants, groaning as Novak leans down to kiss him. The alpha doesn’t waste a moment sliding two fingers into Dean’s slick-filled hole, moaning as he’s met with evidence of Dean’s arousal.
“Fuck, little omega, you smell incredible,” Castiel scents his neck, purring against his scent gland. “Smells like home, Dean,” he breathes, digging his fingernails into Dean’s hips as he begins to fuck him in earnest. Dean shivers, baring his neck for his alpha—no, no,
let it slide. Why? Because you’re afraid you might actually be chemically attracted to this alpha?”
“Mhm. Anael and Hannah, and a brother, Gabriel. I’m the youngest.”
“Hmmm, doesn’t sound all that Halloweenish to me. Ah, yes I forgot you’re the Halloween Grinch.”
if Cas doesn’t make him want to.
Dean smiles and packages Castiel’s muffin for him. “How’s your brother doing? Kids giving him hell now that we’re so close to summer?”
His boyfriend’s head appears in the kitchen doorway and he grins widely at Dean, jogging the few steps down their entryway to pull Dean into a kiss. “Hello, Dean,” he murmurs, taking his hand and pulling him toward the kitchen. “I have a surprise.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. “Show me?”
Dean lurched slightly before gaining his balance and yelling down the phone at Sam, “You let Gabriel into the Bunker? Really, Sam”
Castiel thanks her and promptly loads the list, digging through everything he can find online about all four people. Two went on to work for rival companies, so those are quickly ruled out. The other two don’t seem to have much of an online presence, which is… less than encouraging. After a little more digging, he rules those out as well.
“Just make sure it’s not pining sickness, dummy. You said you had feelings for Castiel, maybe it was more than just an emotional response, maybe it was a chemical one.”
“You look delicious as well,” Castiel answers quietly, chuckling at Dean’s nearly inaudible whine. “I brought whiskey, I know you mentioned you hated wine.” He holds the bottle out and Dean tries his best not to gape. It’s top-shelf whiskey, the super expensive kind that Dean could never justify buying for himself. He knew Cas was loaded, but holy shit.
They step back outside, and Cas takes a cautious sip, nose wrinkling as he does so. Dean chuckles quietly to himself, heart clenching at the allure of the angel before him.
Castiel pulls away, leaning against the counter next to Dean instead. “I’m sorry, am I making you uncomfortable?”
Cas sounded so excited that Dean couldn’t bring himself to disappoint him. Well, not until he’d drunk at least two cups of coffee and eaten some bacon drenched in maple syrup. So, he nodded his assent and went back to get that all essential first cup.
“Cas?”
“Well, it’s definitely the scariest house we’ve seen all night, so good job on that,” the kid said breathlessly, nodding toward the woman. “What do you think? They for sure went all-out, they even dressed up.”
Dean grins. “Hell yeah, dude, that’d be awesome. Just tell me where and what to bring.”
Dean, being the mature older brother that he was, stuck his tongue out at his phone. “Dude, he’s dragging me around a Spirit store looking for the appropriate decorations to celebrate the thinning of the veil.”
hits him as soon as he pushes the bedroom door open, which is more than a little concerning. Castiel’s a client, nothing more. Shaking off those thoughts, he crosses to the bed and shakes Castiel gently.
“Alright, why don’t you two go get a damn room? We’ve got a campaign to play,” Benny snarks with a roll of his eyes.
. Thank gods Castiel is going back to Meg after this rut, no way he could be around this alpha without falling for him hard.
Dean nods jerkily, shuddering as the cool air settles over his flushed skin. “Y-yeah, alpha,
“What are you thinking so deeply about?” Castiel asks, voice light with mirth and a small smile on his lips.
Once his knot goes down, he gingerly pulls out of Dean, groaning as he watches a mix of slick and cum drip onto the floor below them. “Fuck, I didn’t think that could ever be hot.”
Benny stares at him for a moment before bursting into laughter. Dean glares at him for a moment before rolling his eyes and crossing his arms over his chest. “What’re you even doing here, man?”
Rowena McLeod is the producer of
“Before you start, I should let you know that Castiel requested you for his rut this month.” Charlie crosses her arms on the table in front of her, eyeing Dean expectantly. Dean blinks at her, a mix of confusion and elation swirling through his system. “Is there something I need to know?” Charlie asks, eyes drifting rather pointedly to Dean’s scent gland and then back up to his eyes.
Dean hums. “I’ve always wanted a big family. It was just me and Sammy growing up, woulda been nice to have some other kids to play with.”
Castiel gives him a blank stare, so Dean chuckles and takes one out of the display case, showing it to him up close.
Castiel chuckles, fingers carding lazily through Dean’s hair. “My mother was one of six and my father was one of five, we were pretty much destined to be a large family.”
Castiel snorts, leaning back against the arm of the couch and propping his legs up on Dean’s lap. “Perhaps not. Tragic backstory, huh?”
“Fuck, alpha,” Dean whines, grinding up against the cock peeking through Castiel’s robe. “Want that so bad, Cas, want you to take me however you want.”
After a few minutes, there’s a faint shuffling behind the door, then the quiet
Dean rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand, sighing. He was going to kill Sam when they got back to the bunker. Sam knew how he felt about Halloween, Samhain, All Hallows’ Eve —whatever the hell you wanted to call it. Celebrating ghosts, ghouls, zombies, vampires, werewolves etcetera was plain wrong. No-one should be allowed to do it and free will be damned! For Dean, the commercialization of Halloween had only one plus point. All you can eat candy without any of the guilt. Now, if he could convince Cas of that, then Bobby’s old house could remain decoration-free.
Castiel frowns, his scent turning sour as he leans away from Dean, taking his warmth with him. “What’s wrong?”
He’s… ridiculously hot. He’s rocking the perpetual sex hair Dean’s come to adore, along with a button-down that seems unfairly tight on him and a pair of jeans. He’s even got a pair of leather boots on, though he kicks those off before venturing any farther into the apartment. Dean’s never swooned in his life but
“No, boy, I don’t wanna hear it. You and I have discussed the symptoms of pining sickness in this very office how many times? You know what to look out for and you
Dean tenses, clearing his throat. He’s not used to his alpha clients being so affectionate and it’s throwing him off. Not that he
, alpha! Knot me, make sure everyone knows I’m yours,” Dean whimpers, knuckles white as he grips the arm of the couch, grinding back onto Castiel’s cock.
Castiel smiles. “I’m sorry about the pining sickness. I knew your scent was attractive but I never imagined we’d be compatible enough to cause pining sickness.” He frowns, leaning against the headboard and holding an arm out as an invitation for Dean to join him. “This won’t affect your birth control, right?”
The sweet scent of apples drifts under the door, ripe with rut. Dean knocks, a soft smile slipping onto his face as soon as Castiel opens the door.
Castiel hums softly, face pressed to Dean’s neck as he inhales deeply. “This is helping, actually. I just don’t like feeling so helpless. I’m supposed to be teaching these kids how to get where they want in life, but how are they supposed to get there from these awful circumstances a lot of them grow up in?”
“So, what else did Sam tell you?”
“By my estimation, you have precisely 10 minutes and twenty-five seconds in which to shower and change. It will take us another half hour to drive to the store. We can be there when it opens at 10.30.”
Dean’s apartment is an absolute mess. With him being away for weeks at a time and usually too exhausted to do a damn thing when he gets home, he’s got a ridiculous amount of stuff scattered around his apartment. He spends all of Saturday cleaning the place up, returning things to their rightful places, and making sure he has something casual but also a little sexy to wear. Sure, he’s already slept with Castiel, but it can’t hurt to remind the alpha of what he could have. He tugs on his favorite pair of going-out jeans, the ones that make his legs and ass look amazing, and a t-shirt that hugs his biceps. It’s pretty cold out but they’re hanging out at his place, he can always throw a flannel on if he gets cold.
“So let me shadow one of our teams. I want to do this, Luke, I’ll do whatever you think I need to.”
They spend the night snacking on popcorn and homemade cookies, watching the season finale of Dr. Sexy. It’s the happiest Dean’s been in a long time if he’s being honest with himself, and he’s ridiculously pleased that Castiel is the reason for it. He’s everything Dean’s been looking for—kind, smart, funny, and so adorably enthusiastic when it comes to things he loves.
Castiel leaves their brunch far lighter than he’d arrived, like a ton of weight has been lifted off his shoulders. He’s excited for the first time in a long time and he can’t wait to get started.
they were standing on the other side of the door listening. He wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Sam had texted them all and told them to wait for Dean and Castiel’s moment to be over. He shoots them all a carefully calculated look that he hopes conveys that they need to behave before turning and introducing them all to Castiel. The alpha does look a little uncomfortable, eyeing Charlie warily, but Charlie smiles at him before heading deeper into Dean’s apartment. Castiel seems to take that as her blessing, which it sort of is.
,” he hisses, glaring at Meg.
, me versus Luke. I just want to prove that I can do this without the help of the company.”
Castiel growls, roughly tugging Dean’s jeans and underwear down his legs. He can hear the alpha’s knees hit the floor and then there’s a tongue prodding his hole, making him grab the counter as he grinds back onto Cas’s tongue. Two fingers join soon after, stretching him wide as Castiel tongue fucks him until he’s shaking.
Cas smiles and brushes a thumb along Dean’s bottom lip, an obvious possessive touch but Dean leans into it anyway. “Let me spoil you, little omega,” he whispers, smiling as Dean rolls his eyes.
Castiel heaves a sigh. “Bad day at work. One of my kids confessed that they’re being abused at home. I reported it, of course, I just wish there was more I could do.”
Dean breathes a sigh of relief, tossing the fake knot somewhere behind him and crawling off the bed, meeting Castiel halfway down the hallway. “Alpha,” Dean breathes, pulling Cas into a tight hug to scent his neck, sighing happily. “Need you, alpha, please.”
He tries not to think about Castiel again, but he finds his mind wandering back at every opportunity. By the time he starts the movie and adjusts the projector until the picture is perfect, Castiel is all he can think about. He tries to pick him out in the dark crowd to no avail, so he tucks tail and heads for the concession stand.
Dean blinks at her. “He mopes around?”
Luke laughs humorlessly. “You could say that, yes.” He sits heavily in the chair behind his desk, putting his face in his hands for a moment before looking up at Cas. “Bela Talbot, that leech of a gossip reporter, overheard our brunch conversation. It’s tanking faith in the company, the belief that we aren’t as united a front as we present. I’ve been asked—ordered, really—to bring back confidence somehow.”
Cas doesn’t waste a moment drawing Dean close and nudging the head of his cock against Dean’s already slick hole. Dean tries to roll over and present but Cas stops him almost immediately. “I want to see you when I mate you,” he explains, smiling when it makes Dean flush.
It’s the best date Dean’s ever been on in his life and he’s not even sure that it’s a date. Castiel’s sweet and witty and Dean doesn’t mind explaining everything to him in a quiet whisper as they watch the movie.
Dean raises his eyebrows but neither Meg nor Cas says anything, so he pushes his chair back. “Earl Grey, Cas?”
Castiel smiles brightly and digs a scrap of paper out of his pocket, passing it to Dean. “Text me and we can figure everything out.”
Dean can feel his face growing warm with a blush. “Yeah, Cas. Look, I just… I don’t want him to get the wrong idea. I’m definitely not anywhere near ready to mate or quit my job, but… I like him.”
Dean frowned. “I’ve never done stuff like this. Didn’t have time, at least not as a kid. We could start with apple cider I guess?” He led Castiel to a tent with a space heater inside. There was a charming old woman behind the table with a smile and several cups of hot apple cider in front of her.
Dean laces their fingers, chuckling as he lets Cas lead the way. “Yeah, I can smell it.” He’s about to ask where the food’s from when he sees their dining room table completely decked out with a fancy tablecloth, flickering candles, and two plates of what Dean can only describe as his dream dinner—a steak that looks absolutely perfect, a generous serving of mashed potatoes, and sauteed vegetables that don’t look even slightly burnt. “You… did all this?” he asks, trying to keep the astonishment from his voice. He doesn’t really think it works if Cas’s shy smile is anything to go by.
Castiel shoots him an exasperated look, though the corner of his mouth is tilted up into a smile. It’s an adorable look on the alpha and Dean kind of hates him for it. It’s really not fair that an alpha as attractive and nice as Castiel is allowed to exist, much less pay Dean for sex for a week and then never see him again. Still, Dean’s a professional, so he shoves those feelings into a box and hides that box in the deepest recesses of his mind. He doesn’t have time to fall in love with a client, especially a client who isn’t even his.
“You’re gonna want to hold onto the couch, little omega,” Castiel purrs in his ear, fingers already trailing down Dean’s spine and circling his slick hole. Cas presses two fingers into him, sliding them past his rim easily, which draws a low growl from the alpha. Dean whimpers, grabbing onto the arm of the couch as Cas’s hands spread his cheeks apart, exposing his hole to the cool air of the apartment. He doesn’t waste a moment diving in to taste Dean, tongue lapping up the steady stream of slick pouring from his hole. Dean buries his face in one of the decorative pillows, moaning loudly and pushing his hips back.
‘Dean, you look like shit. You’ve got bags under your eyes, you look feverish and you just threw up because you scented an alpha.”
Dean tilts his head, letting Castiel scent him as long as he likes. Eventually, he’s pulled deeper into the apartment by the front of his shirt. Castiel’s irises are entirely eclipsed by red, obviously deep in his rut at his point. He kicks his bedroom door open, shoving Dean onto the bed roughly and quickly stripping himself naked. Dean licks his lips as he gazes at the alpha in front of him, eyes skating down the length of his body and back up. Castiel’s got a feral grin on his face as he stalks toward Dean, quickly ripping his shirt over his head and tossing it haphazardly behind him. He tears at Dean’s pants, miraculously getting them off of Dean without ripping them. Dean’s underwear follows almost immediately, tossed into the corner of the room. The show of strength has Dean leaking slick almost instantly, no doubt soaking Castiel’s bedsheets. The alpha doesn’t look like he cares much, flipping Dean onto his stomach and lapping hungrily at his hole, drinking down every gush of slick the expert flicks of his tongue produce. Dean grunts and moans into Castiel’s mattress, content to lay there and take anything the alpha will give him.
Dean nods, smiling softly. “You’ve been talking about how much you want to go, and with me hiring more people to help me at the bakery, I’ll actually be able to take a vacation, so I figured why not?”
Dean swallows, pushing the remainder of his pie around his plate for a moment before he shakes his head. “He’s Meg’s client anyway, I’m sure he’d be pleased to have her back.”
“Maybe he should be, man.” Benny doesn’t give him a chance to answer, he just holds up his bag as a thank you and heads out the door.
“A gift card for the supermarket chain of our choice.”
Charlie shakes her head. “No
Dean hums and bags the cupcake with Cas’s muffin, sliding the bag across the counter. “We’ve got this courtyard out back with a big wall that we can project movies on. We’re gonna start doing movie nights in the summer on Saturdays. This week’s the first Lord of the Rings if you’re interested in seeing it?”
“Oh my god,” she mutters, wiping her hands on her apron and heading into the back. “I can’t handle you anymore, that whole statement and that’s all you get from it.”
company—for years now.”
Castiel might be his favorite regular. He doesn’t know much about geeky stuff but his enthusiasm about Dean’s baking is adorable and infectious. Anyone who’s in the shop during the time Castiel is there always seems happier in his presence. Dean knows the feeling. He could be having the worst morning of his life but the minute he looks up to find Castiel in Torchwood Treats, everything else seems insignificant. Today is no different. The bell on the door chimes and Dean looks up to find Castiel walking in, smiling brightly at Dean.
Meg freezes, eyes narrowing in Dean’s direction. “Wait,
After Castiel wrings an orgasm from him, he slides into Dean in one long, fluid motion, grunting as he bottoms out. His grip on Dean’s hips is tight, almost bruising, but Dean likes his alphas a little rough anyway.
“Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if you had a mix of sigils on a place some of which were drawn correctly and others that were slightly botched so only someone with the knowledge of them would recognise that they’re wrong?”
“Is that good or bad?”
Castiel raises an eyebrow like he’s waiting for Dean to continue, but Dean simply smirks and crosses his arms over his chest.
Castiel’s brows furrow in what looks like confusion, though that doesn’t make much sense to Dean. Why would he be confused?
He placed a swift kiss to Cas’s cheek on his way to the bathroom. Dean had 40 minutes to figure out how to get away with buying the minimal possible that would please Cas without breaking the metaphorical bank. Fake credit cards did not grow in trees, nor did the money that they gave the Winchesters access to.
“Whoa, Castiel, relax. I told you nothing in your file was a problem for me, knotting was in your file. Don’t worry about it.”
could probably fall for that guy. I just need to know if I can approve you for his rut this month or not.”
Missouri Moseley is a kind but stern beta who’s been Dean’s doctor since he started working for Charlie. She’s intimately familiar with the things Dean does in his job and she’s never judged him before, which is why her outburst startles him.
Dean shuffles uncomfortably, taking a few bites of his pie. “I, uh… I went into heat while I was there.”
Dean chuckles softly. “Wouldn’t have missed it.”
Novak blinks at him, lips tilted up slightly. “You cook?”
Dean nods, risking a glance up at Charlie. She really doesn’t look angry, just concerned. He smiles softly and flips his hand over to give hers a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll be okay.”
Dean smiles, unwrapping one of the granola bars and handing it to Castiel. “I know. Gives me something to do in between your spikes.” Dean settles next to the alpha on the bed, handing Castiel the glass of water when he reaches for it. “Besides, isn’t it kinda my job to take care of you?”
Novak nods, scenting the air for a moment before continuing, “And what about birth control? I don’t have condoms on hand, so if we need them—”
The alpha motions for them to sit, so Dean takes a seat next to him on the couch, shuffling a bit so they can face each other. Cas clears his throat, eyes locked on his hands that are resting in his lap. “I, um… I was wondering if you’d like to go out with me? On a real date, a nice restaurant or something?”
Dean clears his throat, blinking a few times in an effort to avoid giving Novak another once-over. “Mr. Novak, my name’s Dean Winchester. I’m a colleague of Meg’s. She’s away with another client at the moment and won’t be able to make it back anytime soon. I’m here to fill in for her if you’re amenable.”
Dean snuggles against his side, shaking his head. “Nah, birth control isn’t affected by pining sickness, thankfully. And I’m on the shot, so I don’t have to worry about missing pills or not taking them at the exact same time every night or whatever.” He winces, slipping an arm around Castiel’s middle. “Sorry, you probably don’t want to hear about all that.”
Dean didn’t think there was anything worse that Cas could do to manipulate him than the stupid head tilt move. Apparently, he was wrong. Cas’s bottom lip was genuinely trembling. Think, Winchester! Think! There had to be a way of appeasing Cas without maxing out one of their fake credit cards. Yeah, it was official, when it came to a certain fallen angel with permanent bedhead and insanely deep sky at night blue eyes Dean was a complete goner.
“I went into heat the day I got there. Well, that night, actually. I was going to leave but… he asked me to stay and I couldn’t say no. Or maybe I didn’t
“Sam says that there will be ‘pop-up’ stores with decorations, and that…err…what’s that hardware store?”
“I cannot believe it’s been six months already,” Cas muses, kissing Dean softly again before finally stepping back to let him into the apartment.
Dean blinks at the paper, chuckling softly. If Castiel’s been carrying this around, he’s either in the habit of carrying around papers with his phone number on them
Dean swallows thickly, eyes squeezing shut as he arches against Castiel. Dean’s chest squeezes, his heart racing because he’d love nothing more than that. But this isn’t his life, Castiel isn’t
Dean snorts. “No, man. Well, I mean, yeah, actually. But it’s an open event. I’ve got a popcorn machine at home that I’m gonna bring and people can buy cupcakes and stuff, obviously. Two bucks a ticket and we’re donating it to the nonprofit youth theater on Main.”
“Because you hate flying on planes,” Cas answers, setting the folder aside and climbing into Dean’s lap. “Dean, we really don’t have to go.”
Dean blinks at him in confusion. “Sorry for what?”
Cas raises his eyebrows as he takes another sip of his drink. “Are you asking me to come to a movie night with you and your staff?”
Dean’s owned his own bakery for the last three years and, much to his relief, it’s been incredibly successful. He and Charlie had created an entire menu of geeky pastries and drinks, including some recreations of geeky foods. They’d assumed it would be a niche audience, but they have regulars that aren’t into anything geeky.
Mr. Novak frowns, head tilted to the side as his eyes scan the length of Dean’s body, no doubt taking in the well-worn blue jeans and the clean gray henley Dean had managed to find at the last minute. Not exactly appropriate work attire, especially with a client as high-profile and respected as Castiel Novak, but he figures he won’t be in his clothes that long anyway, so it shouldn’t be a problem. “You’re an omega?”
As expected, Cas was standing forlornly by Baby’s passenger door waiting for him. “You’re late. That means we won’t be there when the store opens, Dean. I wanted to be there then, so we don’t miss anything. I want to win this competition.”
“No, hang on! I can get Benny to cover for me, he’s not really into Lord of the Rings anyway. One sec.” He leaves Castiel at the concession stand and picks his way through the crowd until he finds Benny there. Andrea isn’t there, much to Dean’s own relief, so he taps Benny on the shoulder and quietly whispers, “Cover concessions for me? Cas asked me to watch the movie with him.”
Cas flushes and clears his throat, but there’s a tiny smile on his lips. “Should we eat?”
It doesn’t last for long. Only a moment later, Novak’s fingers grab at the hem of Dean’s shirt and tug at it, trying to get it over Dean’s head without breaking the kiss. It’s oddly adorable, but Dean knows the longer they drag this out, the worse the spike will be for the alpha, so he steps away and quickly disrobes. The alpha lets his robe fall to the floor before tugging Dean to the bed, nuzzling his scent gland.
Meg gasps. “Ooh, Clarence! Are you staging a coup?”
“I’m just gonna go find you some food. Close your eyes, get some rest. I’ll wake you when I come back.”
Dean glares at her, slipping past her with arms full of snacks. He spreads them out on the coffee table, settling onto the floor to start the games. Benny picks first and he, predictably, chooses
Luke’s office door is closed when Castiel arrives, which isn’t entirely out of the ordinary. Lilith, his secretary, points Cas toward the plush chairs next to her desk to wait, so he settles into one and sighs softly. There’s no telling how long he may be waiting for Luke. It could be anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours. If something pressing within the company has come up, he may not even get to see Luke today.
Charlie rolls her eyes. “What is this, high school? He likes you, Dean, you’ve got nothing to worry about.”
get a chance to nurture some of them, even if it’s only for the week of their rut? Sign me up.”
Sam’s the first to arrive, which is both helpful and annoying. He relentlessly teases Dean about his date while Rowena gives Dean a hand in the kitchen getting all the snacks ready.
“I’m gonna take you right here, little omega. Make sure every surface of my apartment smells like you before you leave next week.”
“Dean, you know it’s not a bad thing, right? It’s not something you should be ashamed of. In fact, it’s pretty inevitable in this line of work. You’re around alphas all the time, you’re bound to enjoy the scents of a few of them. And from the stories Meg has told over the years, Castiel seems like the perfect alpha.”
Dean sniffles, nose wrinkling as the scent of concerned alpha reaches his nose. “I’m sorry. This is incredibly unprofessional. I’ll, um… Meg’s back in the morning, I’m sure she’d be happy to come over.”
Dean shrinks under her scrutinizing gaze, ducking his head and pulling the office-supplied paper gown tighter around himself. “Missouri, I—”
“As far as you’re concerned, I’m good to go. Charlie gave me a peek at your file and there was nothing in there that should be a problem for either of us.”
Dean shrugs, pulling his shirt away from his chest a couple of times, trying to get some air moving. He’s getting a little hot, but he doesn’t exactly feel comfortable enough to ask Cas to turn the AC on. “Mostly that, I guess. I’m sure it was a lot to do with how I grew up.”
“You’re adorable when you’re flustered,” Castiel says with a cheeky grin, taking a sip of his coffee as Dean scoffs at him. “I’d love to attend. You’re sure Charlie won’t object?”
“Goodnight, Dean,” Castiel murmurs, wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
With their purchases safely tucked into the trunk of the Impala, they climbed into the car. The stop to get candy didn’t take very long, so Castiel suggested they stop at the nearby autumn festival to see what was there. The parking lot is crowded, and the festival looks like the kind of place they normally avoided because they’d on their way to a hunt.
Dean almost drops the cupcakes he’s rearranging, spinning around to find Castiel leaning against the makeshift concession counter. “Oh, uh, kinda. I’m watching from back here. Charlie’s been… otherwise occupied, so I’m in charge of snacks.” He pauses and wipes some stray icing off his hand, clearing his throat. “Did you… want something?”
“But we could always take what we bought back to Kansas with us. We could even do it in several trips. I mean,” Cas batted his eyelashes at Dean, “it is not like we will not have to make trips back here every now and then, even if it’s to see Jody rather than come to Bobby’s.”
Jo smirks. “Awful quick to insist you’re not mating, huh?”
Dean startles, very nearly dropping the jar of pickles in his hands. Castiel laughs, a quiet, warm sound that sends a shiver up Dean’s spine. He sets the glass jar on the counter, clearing his throat.
Nodding quickly, Dean lets out a breath and tilts his head to the side, baring his neck for the alpha. He nuzzles against Dean’s scent gland, inhaling deeply.
Novak frowns, head tilted to the side. “I don’t even remember the last time I ate. I don’t have any groceries, I was supposed to go grocery shopping today.”
“They’re these houses that some of the characters in Lord of the Rings live in. They’re basically little houses that are super nature-oriented. They make surprisingly cute cupcakes.”
Dean breathes a sigh of relief, nodding. “Easy enough. Thanks, Red.”
Dean whistles. “Four kids? Wow.”
The waiting was the worst part, it turned out. Dean was crouched behind a pile of metal with his phone in hand, ready to blast music the second they heard kids or the judges coming up. Castiel was hidden somewhere in the stacks of cars, though Dean couldn’t for the life of him figure out why.
Dean frowns, stepping out from behind the counter and wrapping his boyfriend in a tight hug. Cas burrows into the embrace, arms winding their way around Dean’s waist. “That’s awful, Cas, I’m so sorry.”
Novak finally sets his phone aside after a few minutes, eyes flicking up to meet Dean’s. “It’ll be here in an hour.”
Smiling softly, Dean shakes his head and rests his forearms on the counter in front of him. “No, man, I’m just not really used to alphas being so affectionate while they’re in rut. They usually don’t want anything to do with me unless they need a hole to knot.”
“Cas!” Charlie grins, pulling up two chairs for Castiel and the brunette accompanying him. “C’mon in. Thought you didn’t do geeky things.”
Grunting, Dean forces himself to his feet and leans against the wall of the stall he’s in. “Yeah, fine. Sorry, I don’t know what that was all about.” He wipes his mouth with some toilet paper and flushes the toilet, stepping out into the bathroom. Charlie smells of concerned omega, so Dean flashes her a reassuring smile. “I’m okay. Think I might just have a bug.”
“I knew it!” Cas shouts, sitting up as it’s revealed that Dr. Sexy’s current girlfriend is the mystery doctor applying for the same job Dr. Sexy is applying for. Dean grins to himself, shaking his head at his boyfriend’s adorable enthusiasm. “I told you, Dean, look! It’s going to cause
“Home Depot,” Dean replied on autopilot around a mouthful of pancake. Pancake that suddenly tasted like ash in his mouth.
Novak growls, crossing the room in three long strides and sweeping Dean into his arms, his lips meeting Dean’s in a kiss that’s all power. Dean doesn’t exactly mind that, though, so he melts against Novak’s front and gives himself over to the kiss.
“Ah, I love this game,” Cas says with a grin, shuffling through the cards he’s dealt. “I always play this with my brother and a few of our friends.”
Charlie leans back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest. “Well, I probably shouldn’t be telling you this, but Castiel’s got it too. He wasn’t sure if that was a problem for the company or not. I’ll tell you the same thing I told him—it’s not a problem for me as long as you two work out something you’re comfortable with. I know you don’t particularly want to mate after…” she trails off but Dean already knows exactly what she’s talking about.
“Morning, Cas. Your usual?”
Meg plops into the chair next to Charlie. “Hang on, can we pivot back to the ‘no geeky stuff’ thing? You’re the geekiest person I know when it comes to Doctor Sexy.”
Castiel grins and nods. “Please. How is your brother doing with his finals?”
He snorts. “No, Luke is still very much in charge of the company. Rowena McLeod has given us the opportunity to do an episode of
“We should decorate our place. I’m sure we could win if we set our minds to it.”
Dean mutters something incoherently, snuggling against the pillow. Castiel chuckles softly, the movement pulling at his knot and making them both gasp. The alpha shuffles them carefully, sitting back on the couch so Dean’s sitting on his lap. Castiel flicks the television back on, petting Dean’s thighs absentmindedly while they wait for his knot to go down. It’s strangely domestic and it makes Dean all fuzzy and warm, despite the fact that his brain vehemently reminds him that this is over as soon as Castiel’s rut passes.
Novak smirks, sliding into Dean with one long, powerful thrust. Dean grunts out his pleasure, wrapping his legs around the alpha’s waist. “You can just call me Castiel, you know.”
,” Dean whines, clenching around his fingers. “Need your cock, alpha, c’mon, fuck me right against your counter, breed me good.”
Castiel’s next rut is right on schedule. Dean shows up at his apartment on a Thursday night with several bags of groceries in hand and a duffle bag packed with a few changes of clothes and his grooming items. Castiel’s already in the throes of it, clearly. His button-up is unbuttoned and hanging loosely around his flushed body and there’s a noticeable bulge in his dress pants. Dean smirks, slipping past the alpha and dropping everything in the kitchen before allowing himself to be swept into Castiel’s arms. Castiel immediately goes for his neck, scenting him as Dean slips a hand down to cup his cock. Dean can already feel his knot swelling, so he starts to lead Castiel toward the bedroom. Instead, Castiel grabs his hips and bends him over the counter roughly, smirking as he nibbles Dean’s ear.
Luke scoffs and takes a sip of his mimosa, the bright morning sun shining off his tacky Rolex. Castiel hates how often Luke chooses to flaunt their wealth, but he supposes it’s none of his business. “All due respect, Castiel, but it’s not
Castiel snarls, irises almost completely covered in red. “No, Dean, you don’t understand, I can
He heads for the living room first. The light switch is right near the hallway that leads to Castiel’s bedroom, so he flicks it on and immediately scoffs. It’s frustrating, seeing how the other half lives like this. Sure, he makes a comfortable enough living with his job, but he would
Castiel grins and leans up to give Dean a quick kiss. “Hello, Dean. Thank you.”
so he just shrugs.
“Dean, why don’t you go get drinks for our guests while we read Meg in?” Charlie says, passing Meg a few different sheets of paper.
So, when Dean walks into their apartment on Valentine’s day and smells the delectable scent of a perfectly cooked steak and something distinctly sweet, he’s a little concerned that he’s walked into the wrong apartment.
Dean hums. “My pleasure, believe me. I’m glad you asked me to come back.”
Castiel smirks. It’s a great look on him and Dean can’t help but stare for a moment. “His kids always give him hell. But yes, the approaching break from school exacerbates the issue.”
Dean pointed to the display of polystyrene tombstones and gargoyles.
“If Sam says so, it must be true,” Dean muttered leaning back in his chair. “So, what exactly is it we win for the best-dressed house?” Maybe there’d be an epic prize that would make pretending that he didn’t know the truth worth it. Doubtful, but a guy could dream of getting free food and booze, couldn’t he?
“Nope. No. Never. We don’t need that kind of shit. Let’s…uh…oh…hey what about these?”
They lay like that for almost twenty minutes while they wait for Cas’s knot to go down. After a while, Castiel shuffles them around so Dean’s sprawled out on the alpha’s chest, which is absolutely perfect. Dean nuzzles the alpha’s scent gland, smiling when it makes Castiel purr.
Smiling, Castiel leans his head back against the arm of the couch and closes his eyes. “Sounds like you enjoy your job.”
Dean smiles and brings Cas’s hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. “It’s fine, angel. He’s sober now, and it pushed me to get out of there, it pushed
“Well if it isn’t my favorite customer,” Dean says with a grin, already gathering things for Cas’s afternoon tea. Castiel leans against the counter with a smile, though it doesn’t reach his eyes, so Dean abandons the tea and heads for the counter. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
“She was,” Castiel agrees, a small smile curling his lips. “No public dates with clients.”
Dean puts his face in his hands, nodding. He runs his fingers through his hair, staring down at his lap for a moment before chancing a look at Charlie. She doesn't look mad, hell she doesn’t even look
Dean clears his throat, taking a half step away from Novak to clear his head. “I’m taking Meg’s normal rate, so the same you always owe.”
The last group of kids left around eleven that night. Castiel’s superhuman hearing couldn’t make out anyone else approaching the house, so they turned off the lights, unplugged the pile of skulls and the smoke machine, then lugged both into the house before locking themselves in for the night. Castiel agreed to a movie night, so Dean picked out his favorite scary movie and threw a bag of popcorn into the microwave. Castiel grabbed the beers while Dean dumped the freshly popped corn into a bowl, and then they both settle into the couch, pressed close from shoulder to thigh.
Dean shakes his head. “I like living in the city. But yeah, two or three kids, maybe. A dog.” He smirks, cuddling closer. “Big, strong alpha to protect us all.”
“I can hear the air quotes, you know,” Sam chuckled. “You’ve been around that angel of yours too long. What d’you want? ‘Cause I’m certain it wasn’t solely to bitch at me and I got work to do.”
They spend the next couple of hours chatting, mostly about inconsequential things—Dean’s favorite movie, Castiel’s favorite book, the play going on at the local theater that Castiel wants to go see. It’s light and fun and heartbreakingly domestic, like Cas is his mate and they’re just talking about their days.
They’re snapped out of the moment by another knock on the door. Dean turns to see Sam and Rowena giggling in the kitchen. They’re clearly not going to be of any help, so Dean smiles and takes the bottle from Castiel, tugging the door open once again. Charlie, Benny, Kevin, and Jo file inside, like they’d all arrived in the same car or something. Dean knows they didn’t. He doesn’t even need to ask, he
As Cas turns to him, he realizes that he doesn’t actually care about what the right time is. A random Thursday night when they’re just together is actually the perfect time for this, so he smiles to himself and pulls Cas into a soft kiss. “I love you,” he murmurs, chuckling as Cas’s eyes grow wide.
They’ve been living together for almost a month now and it’s everything Dean dreamt it would be. Waking up next to Castiel is the single best part of the day, even if it is ridiculously early for both of them, with Cas off to school and Dean off to the bakery to prepare the foods for the morning rush. Still, they always manage to find a few minutes to just enjoy each other’s company, whether it’s over their morning coffee or just laying in bed soaking in the last few minutes of warmth before they have to head out to be functioning adults for the day.
Dean flashes him a grin. “I’m fine with it, I love some post-sex cuddles.”
The living room looks ridiculously cozy.  He rustles around the kitchen as quietly as he can manage, impressed with what he finds. It’s impeccably organized. The cabinet over the stove has almost every single spice and seasoning Dean can think of, which makes him incredibly excited to cook for the alpha later. He finds a box of granola bars in the pantry, so he grabs a couple and fills a glass with water, heading back to Castiel’s bedroom.
Cas cocked his head to one side, with faux wide-eyed innocence.
No may have about it. But what was done was done. All that was left was for Dean to do damage control and curb Cas’s enthusiasm for Halloween.
Luke heaves another sigh. “I don’t think I can let you take on a full project in good conscience, Castiel. You’ve never been through the process.”
Castiel growls, grabbing onto Dean’s hips tightly as he starts to fuck him, all harsh breaths and rough thrusts as he fucks Dean into the couch. His knot is already catching on Dean’s rim, evidence of just how worked up Castiel is. Dean mewls when his knot finally locks them together, coming hard as Castiel spills inside him, burying his face in the pillow as he milks the alpha’s knot.
the heat on you.”
Luke sits back in his chair and sighs, tossing his napkin on the table. “Why do you want this so badly? I thought you were content designing houses for the company. When you were with April, you seemed to—”
Castiel chuckles, tilting his head as Dean leans up to scent his neck. “Hello, Dean.”
Novak blinks at him, his flush growing darker. “Right, of course, I’m sorry. I’m not quite myself at the moment. This way.”
Castiel flushes, rubbing the back of his neck. “Let me help you, I should put a bandage on your shoulder.”
“Hey, Sammy. Hear you been telling Cas tales again, bitch!”
Castiel hums. “Both of my sisters are omegas, I’ve heard it all over the years.”
“Dean Winchester, your head was not this far up your ass last time you were in this office.”
Dean wrinkles his nose, shrinking further in on himself. “What are you, my therapist?”
Dean hums. “Have you eaten anything? I doubt we have time for a full meal, but you should at least snack on something.”
Dean hums his agreement, raising an eyebrow at the alpha. “Right. I’m having a game night at my place this weekend. You’re welcome to come, if you want to. It’s just my brother, his mate, and a few of our friends. Charlie will be there too.”
do something about it. What could it hurt, right? Worst case scenario, Cas says no and Dean reigns in his emotions to keep it professional. So, when Charlie comes back from her break, Dean clears his throat and slips his hands in his pockets. “So what if, theoretically, I was actually considering asking Cas out? Would it be weird to do it at the movie?”
A speed trap and slow weekend drivers made Dean’s promise impossible. They arrived outside the shop at 10.32. Cas was twitching in beside him, irritated at not achieving his goal to be outside before the store opened. So, Dean pushed him out of Baby in front of the shop’s entrance telling Cas that he’d go find a safe place to park the Impala.  With Baby safely parked up in an empty part of the lot, it was time to see if the fount of all nerdy knowledge could come up with any reason why his brilliant idea wouldn’t work.
Dean could barely make out Castiel’s face falling as the woman continued her tirade, pointing out all the different aspects she doesn’t agree with. The kid looked embarrassed, trying to quiet her to no avail.
“Pining sickness, Dean. I think you have pining sickness. You need to go see your doctor. I’ll decline Lisa for you.”
Castiel smiles, lifting himself up to sit on the counter, crossing his ankles. “Sounds delightful. What are you going to make?”
Dean? No way.”
The first thing he does when he gets home is reach out to Meg, head of human resources at Angelic Houses.
Dean hums and heads for his favorite spot on Cas’s couch, curling up against the armrest. He sets the platter of cookies on the coffee table and cracks open the beer Cas brings him. “Thanks, babe. You ready for this episode? It’s supposed to be super wild.”
, take me.”
Dean sighs happily, a sated smile on his lips as he blinks up at his alpha. “Well hello to you too, Cas.”
“I knotted you, I don’t even know if you’re okay with that, I should’ve—”
He’s just through the first wave of his heat when he hears the apartment door opening and keys being tossed on the glass table right next to it. “Dean?”
Castiel raises his eyebrows, watching Luke for a moment before he collects the folder from his desk and flips it open. There’s a stack of paperwork inside, though the front page immediately makes it clear what this offer is. Of course, he’d already had his suspicions just based on who was giving them the offer.
The call he’s been waiting for comes only a couple of days later. Luke’s secretary calls and asks him to come in for a meeting the following morning, at nine. Castiel puts on his best dress shirt and pressed dress pants, making sure to use the cufflinks Luke had gifted him several years ago. He actually manages to smooth his hair down for once, though it may have so much hair gel that he’s quite possibly flammable. Still, he looks professional, so he’ll take the chance of bursting into flames.
In the blink of an eye, Castiel is on him, hard kisses and hot, roaming hands lighting up every nerve in Dean’s body. He feels like there’s a river of slick flowing out of him and onto Castiel’s couch, but with the alpha’s delicious, hard cock hanging over his stomach, Dean can’t really find it in himself to care. Castiel bares his teeth, snarling as he flips Dean over onto his stomach.
Charlie’s office door is closed when he gets there, which is… odd. He’s worked here for six years and he’s never actually seen her office door closed. Frowning, he waves at her secretary, a young beta named Krissy. “Charlie busy?”
Luke raises his eyebrows. “Just like that? You don’t want to sleep on it?”
Dean smiles and nods, wrapping his legs around the alpha’s waist and drawing him in close. “Mate me, alpha,” he purrs, stroking his fingers through Castiel’s hair.
“I’m sure I’ll be more than happy with whatever you make,” Castiel says softly, grinning at the shy smile that makes itself at home on Dean’s face.
“Just because you’re an omega doesn’t mean it’s your responsibility to care for me, Dean. Although I do appreciate it.”
Castiel breathes a sigh of relief, nodding as he leans down and continues to scent Dean’s neck.
Castiel smiles brightly at him and nods, so Dean slides him a flyer for the movie night and wishes him a good day at work. He may or may not stare a little longer than he should, but there are no other customers in the store, so he lets himself look. Cas is an objectively attractive dude, of course, Dean would enjoy the view when he gets a chance.
Charlie waves him off, taking the check from the waitress and leaving cash on the table to cover it. “Don’t worry about it, Dean. We haven’t had a complaint from Castiel the entire time he’s been a client. In fact, he gave you a rave review. It’ll be fine, I promise.”
They spent the majority of the night scaring the crap out of the neighborhood kids, but most of them left with smiles on their faces and handfuls of candy that Castiel gave them as an apology. Dean had hidden a couple of bags earlier in the night, so they’d have plenty for the two of them once all the trick-or-treaters had gone. Not that Castiel would eat much, but Dean had a night of scary movies and cuddling on the couch planned, whether Castiel decided to eat candy or not.
“Nice blanket.”
“Whatever the most anti-Halloween character is — you are it, Dean. I’ll get you your answer, but Cas’s way sounds way better. Go help him choose some FUN stuff.”
company. You chose to stay behind the scenes and design the houses and I took on the burden of being the face of the company.”
Maybe this Halloween thing wasn’t so bad after all.
“It seems like a reasonable offer. It’d be good exposure for the company and you’d get your shot to flip a house on your own.”
Dean blinks at her. His mind is far too sluggish to connect those dots at the moment.
Castiel pulled the mask off and apologized profusely, helping the kid to his feet. The kid waved him off with a nervous chuckle, shuffling closer to the other judge.
Instead of digging himself into an anxious hole trying to find a contractor, he decides to go over the information packet from Rowena again. He tugs at the knot of his tie, loosening it and unbuttoning the top button of his shirt as he spreads the papers out across his desk. He reads through the draft contract first. There’s nothing spectacular in there, though he does note that both he and Luke would be paid for their appearances, along with their crews. The rest of the packet is ridiculously thick, but it lays out the areas they’re considering filming in, so he digs his laptop out from the mess of papers on his desk and starts to look at some of the houses for sale in the area. He wants to see what renovated houses are selling for, in addition to any houses that seem good for a flip. He finds about twenty houses that could be good candidates, so he jots their addresses down to revisit once he has a contractor and knows what area they’ll be working in.
Dean smiles and presses a kiss to the top of Cas’s head. “I did.”
Dean snorts. “I bet. Have a good day, Cas.” He passes his change across the counter, smiling as Castiel waves over his shoulder as he leaves.
alpha, Castiel isn’t his.
“Fuck, omega, you’re perfect,” Castiel breathes, nuzzling against Dean’s scent gland. Dean would swear he felt a hint of fangs, but they’re gone before he can really figure out if they were there or if it was just his inner omega wishing.
He glances at Dean, cheeks flushed a beautiful shade of pink. “Yes. It’s my favorite show.”
It wasn’t until the very last second that he spotted Castiel across the way, decked out in a Jason Vorhees costume, complete with a huge, bright red fire ax effortlessly held aloft. The sight made Dean simultaneously terrified for the poor judges' hearts and giddy to see Cas scare the living daylights out of them.
“Charlie was pretty clear about company policy,” Dean says idly, deciding this is the best way to broach the topic. He’s betting Charlie gave Castiel the same speech she gave Dean. At least, he’s hoping she did.
“I can make up the time. Don’t you worry about that,” Dean reassured Cas as Baby roared into life.
Dean scoffs. “You think this is an
Next thing he knows, Castiel is carrying him into his bedroom and laying him in the center of the huge bed, flipping the lights off and climbing into bed next to him. Dean immediately snuggles against the alpha, smiling when he hears the soft, content purr Castiel lets out.
Dean frowns. “No dates with clients, I know.”
“Alpha? I brought you some water and a couple of granola bars.”
Castiel hummed appreciatively, smiling gently at Dean. “Yes. But those molecules were pleasing, at least. Like whiskey.”
Charlie barely contains her squeal of excitement, pulling Dean into a hug that’s surprisingly tight for someone so small. “Yes, thank god. It doesn’t matter where it is, Dean, I promise you. He’s gonna love it no matter what.” Dean can feel his cheeks heating as he hugs her back, shaking his head.
,” he whimpers, shuddering as Castiel presses two fingers in beside his tongue. “Fuck, alpha, knot me.”
Dean grins. “Me too, man! What did you think of that twist with Nurse Sampson last week?”
It’s what prompts him to set up a meeting with Charlie a few weeks later. He’s never actually had feelings for a client before and he doesn’t exactly know how to deal with that, much less when that client isn’t even his and he won’t get to see them again. Charlie looks like she already knows where this conversation is headed as she slides a coffee and a slice of apple pie across the table as soon as Dean sits down. The fresh apple scent doesn’t exactly help, but Dean’ll never say no to a slice of pie.
He takes the receipt and the pen, heading for the bedroom. Castiel blinks at him in surprise before his eyes drop to the receipt and pen clutched in Dean’s hands. Realization dawns on his face and he quickly takes both from Dean, scribbling his signature on the bottom before returning them.
“A contractor. Actually, a team of contractors, if you know of any, but they need to be ones that don’t currently work for the company.”
Missouri seems to get the hint, scoffing. “First of all, your job doesn’t define who you are and it ain’t something to be ashamed of. Heats and ruts are far simpler to endure with a partner, you should know that by now. Do I actually need to send you to a therapist?”
Novak growls as he leans back and brushes the head of his cock against Dean’s hole, smirking at Dean’s quiet whimper. “Want me to fill you, little omega? Put your pretty ass to good use?”
“Your birth control will still work while you’re in heat, yes?”
you to stay.”
“Oh, don’t bring April into this. You know anything from that time is irrelevant.”
Dean shrugs. “It’s not public. I doubt she’d care.”
Novak flushes, which is an oddly adorable look on the alpha. “I- that’s… right. Okay. Good. Um… you can put your bag in there, then.”
Castiel hums, carding a hand through Dean’s hair. It drags a purr from low in Dean’s chest, rumbling in the empty space between them as Dean leans into the touch. “I’m sure she’d find something for you. She spoke very highly of you when I met with her.”
“She’s right, brother.” Dean turns to find Benny leaning against the counter, smirking. Dean rolls his eyes and tosses the towel on the counter between them, huffing.
Charlie’s already there with a slice of pie and a mug of coffee, but both make Dean’s stomach roil, so he pushes them across the table to Charlie. “Not really feeling well, thank you though. File?”
Castiel laughs, though this one is more of a rumble than the previous one. Dean can feel it against his back and it makes him shiver. “Well I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself, but I’m serious. You’ve earned the rest and I’m planning to head to bed anyway.”
Dean hums happily, kissing Castiel’s scent gland. “Night, alpha.”
“I haven’t had a heat since I turned eighteen, Cas, it ain’t gonna start now.”
“Hey, don’t listen to her. She’s probably only doing this because someone asked her, and she couldn’t say no. She probably hates Halloween. Alright? We did a good job, and the kids are gonna love it.” Dean smiled, squeezing Cas’s waist lightly. “Maybe lose the ax though, hm? It may be a bit overboard. I’ll get you a metal pipe or something.”
“What is there to sleep on? The company isn’t liable for anything, it’d push Bela’s article out of people’s minds, and I’ll finally get the chance to prove that I can do more than just design.” Cas frowns. “Unless you think it’s a bad idea?”
Charlie nods, leaning across the table to place her hand over Dean’s. “As long as you’re okay, I don’t care if it happens again. I get you think it was unprofessional, but we didn’t receive a complaint from Castiel and you did all the right things, based on what you told me. You offered to leave, you left it up to him and he
Novak smiles, sitting on the bed and typing quietly on his phone. Dean sits in the armchair and sighs as he sinks into it. It’s just as comfortable as he’d expected. He smirks to himself, taking a moment to observe the alpha in front of him.
Castiel pouts up at him but nods, letting go of Dean’s wrist as he rolls over to snuggle into the pillows. Dean watches him for a moment, a foreign sense of fondness wiggling its way into his chest. It’s a dangerous feeling in his line of work, especially since Castiel isn’t even his client. He’ll undoubtedly return to Meg for his next rut, so Dean intends to take every opportunity that he can to enjoy this.
“Gods, Dean, I’d almost forgotten how delectable you smell.”
“Research? Halloween research? Newsflash, Cas, the monsters are real. You know that. You’ve hunted some of them with us.”
“Fuck, Dean,” Castiel growls, leaning down to nuzzle Dean’s scent gland as he gently shuffles them around, settling them back against the pillows with Dean sprawled out on Cas’s chest. He nuzzles Dean’s jaw, purring softly. “Can feel your slick dripping down my cock, little omega. That your way of making sure everyone knows you’re mine?”
“Have them delivered, I can get them even if you can’t.”
Dean nods quickly, wetting his bottom lip as he gazes up at the alpha. “Please, Mr. Novak, want that big alpha cock fucking me open.”
Dean hums and heads for the kitchen in the back. He returns a few minutes later and sets a pint glass in front of Meg and a cup and saucer in front of Castiel, along with a small bottle of honey.
?” Grumbling, Dean pushes Cas off him gently and wiggles out of his jeans and boxers, grabbing Cas’s hand and sliding it to Dean’s hole, where he’s practically gushing slick. Castiel’s eyes darken at that and he glances up at Dean, his expression just short of feral.
. There are scratches down the length of Dean’s back and he can feel blood trickling from them as Castiel fucks into him with reckless abandon. His knot swells after only a few minutes, but even that doesn’t stop him. He keeps shoving his knot into Dean over and over, stretching his hole around the enormous knot as he chases his own release. Dean only gets a moment’s warning before Castiel’s enormous knot sinks into him one last time, locking them together as the alpha pumps load after load into him. Castiel howls something that remotely resembles Dean’s name, nails digging into Dean’s hips. Dean shudders through his own orgasm, melting into a puddle of oversensitivity against the counter until there’s a blinding pain in his left shoulder. He gasps, trying to wrench away from whatever’s hurting him, skin tearing as he dislodges whatever it was. He glances at his shoulder and finds the distinct markings of fangs there and an utterly shocked Castiel staring at him with eyes as wide as saucers.
They’re left in awkward silence as Meg heads deeper into the growing crowd, both desperately trying not to stare at the other. Eventually, Castiel holds up his ticket and thanks Dean quietly, disappearing into the crowd.
Cas’s face seems to fall, though it’s smoothed out before Dean can figure out why. Meg clears her throat and steps away from Castiel.
Luke waves a hand at him. “I know you would, but in this case, I don’t need it. I know you want to take a house from purchase all the way through selling, so now you’ll have the opportunity.” He straightens up, sliding a folder across the desk toward Castiel. “Rowena McLeod stopped by my office last night and left me this offer. I’ve already accepted, but it needs your approval as well.”
Dean snorts. “Whoa, alpha, breathe. It’s all good, it’s just my shoulder.” Dean rolls his shoulder, wincing as a bolt of pain shoots down his arm. “Gotta say, that’s the first time I’ve had a client bite me.”
“I took a cooking class,” Castiel explains, shrugging. “I wanted to do something special for you for Valentine’s day.”
Dean grins. “Nah, man, I love cooking. Get whatever you want and I’d be happy to cook for you.”
Cas pouted at Dean as he shoved his chair back and walked over to the counter to grab the flyer.
a lady. I dunno, Cas says your butterbeer is good?”
Castiel blinks up at him and Dean realizes he’s never actually gone in-depth about his childhood. It’s probably time, and it’d make Cas feel a bit better. Decision made, he presses a kiss to his boyfriend’s forehead and lets him go. “Let me get your tea and I’ll get Charlie to take over for me and we can talk, okay?”
Dean hands the receipt and pen back to Alfie, dragging the grocery bags into the apartment. He sets them on the island in the center of the kitchen, humming quietly to himself as he puts everything away. Thanks to Castiel’s ridiculously organized kitchen, he doesn’t have a problem finding a place for everything he’d ordered. He’s already got a few ideas for dinner that he’s excited to make.
every time he looked at the man. Now it’s joined by Charlie and Benny’s voices, magnifying the original until it’s all he can think about the moment Cas walks into the store in the morning and the last thought he has before bed every night.
The line is silent for longer than Cas is comfortable with. “You… you do realize I am the head of the HR department, right? Me helping you would technically be the company helping you.”
“You’re not watching?”
By the time he needs to head to bed that night, he’s feeling much more confident than he’d been walking out of Luke’s office that morning.
Novak’s throat bobs as he swallows, head tipped up as he scents the air quietly. “An hour ago.”
“Not really, but I’m not sure I’d mind if it was Cas. It’s just… really fast.”
“Gonna breed you so good, little omega, watch you swell with my pups,” Cas says breathlessly, pushing into Dean in one long, deep thrust that makes Dean’s toes curl and his eyes squeeze shut.
“I’ll cancel my account. With Charlie. Uh, if you want to give us a shot, that is.” When Dean doesn’t answer, the alpha looks away and launches into a nervous ramble that’s all kinds of adorable.  “I just really enjoyed tonight, seeing you happy and comfortable around your friends and I want to see more of that. Outside of my rut. But, if that’s not something you want, we can—”
Castiel snorts. “And your job?”
“What is it?” Dean murmurs, yawning as he forces himself to sit up.
The silence on the other end of the phone wasn’t encouraging.
,” Dean begs, winding his legs around Castiel’s waist. The alpha snarls above him, capturing Dean in a heated kiss and he guides his cock into Dean in one smooth, slow push. The stretch is exquisite and Dean’s heat abates the moment he’s got the alpha’s cock buried inside him. Castiel rests his arms on either side of Dean’s head as he fucks into the omega, kissing and nibbling his lips and neck. His scent is nothing but content as Dean moans and writhes underneath him, drawing out every ounce of arousal from the alpha.
Castiel growls low in his chest, more of a rumble than anything, then he’s withdrawing his tongue and his fingers. “Taste so good, omega, our scents all mixed together. Smells like home,” Castiel mutters, though he doesn’t really seem to comprehend what he’s saying. Nevertheless, it sends a jolt of heat through Dean because he’d like nothing more than to smell like home to Castiel.
Dean grumbles softly, nose twitching as he’s met with the unmistakable scent of concerned alpha. He blinks in the darkness of the bedroom, frowning and rubbing his eyes. “Cas? What’s wrong?”
“Why would we never use it again, Dean? I don’t understand. Halloween takes place every year on 31st October, does it not? Surely, we would use them again next year, and maybe the year after that?”
Surprisingly enough, it didn’t take all that much convincing. Cas did make him promise to play some spooky music in honor of the holiday, which Dean readily agreed to. He had a playlist of all of his favorite scary movie songs, he would throw in a few rock songs here and there and everything would be perfect.
Castiel smiles against his neck, nuzzling Dean’s scent gland. “Sleep, little omega. You’ve earned it. I’ll bring you to bed once my knot goes down.”
The telltale sound of tires on the road nearby gave away the arrival of someone, most likely the competition judges. Dean waited with bated breath for the crunch of gravel underneath shoes before he pressed play on his playlist. The soft sounds of the Halloween theme song creeped out through the junkyard and, combined with the ominous red eyes glowing in the distance and the thick layer of smoke near the entrance they’d managed to build up, it created a thoroughly creepy atmosphere.
Dean has a meeting scheduled with Charlie but he can barely find the energy to roll himself out of bed. His head is spinning, his stomach is clenching like he’s going to vomit, and normal scents that he usually doesn’t mind are making him gag. It’s fucking annoying, but he needs to go to this meeting with Charlie. There’s a new client at the company and Dean was one of her top picks, so Charlie had set up a meeting for Dean to review the file. Honestly, the thought of looking at any alpha right now makes him nauseous, but it’s his job, so he downs a glass of water and gets dressed.
Cas’s brow furrowed for a second before he snatched the plate off the table, scraped the contents into the trash can and dumped the plate in the sink. He looked at his watch, a cheap drug store one he’d taken to wearing because people who wore suits, also wore watches.
Normally stealing food from Dean’s plate would be a massive red flag. This morning, Cas could have at it.
Dean nods, keeping his eyes on his plate as he finishes his pie. Charlie’s not only his boss, but she’s also one of his best friends and he doesn’t want to disappoint her. “I’ll do it. I can separate personal feelings from work ones, I’ll be fine.”  He sets his plate to the side and holds the warm coffee between his hands, frowning.
be able to afford an apartment like this. Hell, he probably wouldn’t even be able to afford half the furniture in the place.
“Dean, I really—”
you to go. Do you want to go? I won’t keep you here, omega, but I’d love to help you through your heat if you’ll let me.”
They spend the duration of Castiel’s rut making good on his promise. By the time Dean leaves, he’s pretty sure they’ve fucked on every surface of the apartment except for the spare bedroom, including the floor-to-ceiling window that spans the length of Castiel’s living room. Castiel had pressed him up against it and fucked him from behind, purring about how anyone below them would be able to see Dean like this, being bred by his alpha. It was the hardest Dean came in a long time and he’s eager to repeat it during Castiel’s next rut if he can entice the alpha to do so.
“I’ve been on suppressants and birth control for years, there’s no need. I’m tested every two months and I’ve been clear since I started the job.”
Castiel breaks their kiss, nibbling his way down Dean’s neck as he opens the omega up on his fingers. “Smell so good omega, can’t wait to knot you, breed you full of my pups. You’d look so pretty swollen with our young, can already see you barefoot and pregnant making yourself at home in my apartment,” Castiel mutters against Dean’s scent gland, working a third finger into Dean. “Gonna knot you so good, omega, make you want that too.”
Dean grunts softly when Castiel drops on top of him, panting against the back of Dean’s neck.
*******************
Dean yawns, closing his eyes and returning the nuzzle. “I’m okay, alpha. Jus’ sated.”
Once Dean flops back onto the bed, Castiel lifts himself off of Dean and heads for the en suite, returning with a warm washcloth that he uses to clean Dean up as well as he can.
“He offered to come over and help me research Halloween so that we get the place done up right.”
Dean leaves Castiel’s apartment six days later with an aching ass and a knot in his stomach. Castiel had insisted Dean do his laundry before he left, so his duffel is full of his freshly laundered clothes thick with Castiel’s scent. It’s incredibly frustrating and Dean has no doubt he’ll be getting himself off to the scent for days to come, not that he’s opposed to that. He’s never been this affected by a client before and it scares him a little.
“Mr. Novak?” The boy asks, shuffling the bag in his arms to the floor, pulling out a receipt book.
“Meg,” Cas hisses, an unreadable expression on his face.
“It’s not expensive and I’ve been dying to bend you over this couch and fuck you since you walked into my apartment,” Castiel growls, leaning down to nibble Dean’s scent gland. Dean shudders, baring his neck and squirming against the rush of slick at that statement alone.
The things that the angel focused on so he could blend in with humans more continued to fascinate Dean. It would be the odd mannerisms and the lack of understanding of human idioms of speech or pop culture references that marked Cas out as ‘different’ not whether he was wearing a watch. In all honesty, Dean thought that if Cas was about to suggest they went shopping for Halloween decorations with Cas dressed in his suit and trench-coat on a Saturday morning, nothing would stop Cas from looking out of place.
Novak nods, grabbing his phone off the nightstand. “Do you want anything?”
Every Saturday at lunchtime, Torchwood Treats holds an open D&D campaign. It’s how he and Charlie met most of their friend group in the area. They haven’t had anyone new in a long time, so it’s surprising when the bell on the door chimes after everyone’s already arrived. Dean looks up and he can feel the grin forming on his own face when he sees Castiel. He looks nervous, which shouldn’t be as adorable as it is, frankly.
Dean takes a sip of his coffee, nodding. “Yeah, she said my body had become accustomed to the suppressants so she switched the brand. Sometimes a heat slips through and it’s nothing to be concerned about unless it becomes chronic. Shouldn’t happen again.”
Dean smirks, nudging Novak forward with the heels of his feet. “Well come on then,
“I’m not asking if you’re going to quit, Dean. I’d never ask that of you if we decided to…” He lets the sentence trail off, though Dean really wishes he wouldn’t. “I just meant if you have pups. Would you want to leave them for a week at a time?”
Dean clutched his hand to his chest, mouth hanging open, and eyes bulging. If only Sam could see how he’d wounded his brother! Dean quickly recovered his composure and peeked out to see where Cas had wandered off to. “Am not! Besides, there’s no such thing.”
