Sherlock wrapped his arms close to his chest and pressed himself up against Mycroft, a signal that he wanted to be held.  Mycroft’s arms were around him in a moment, and Sherlock, sitting at the kitchen table in his brother’s arms, no longer felt anger or fear.  Mycroft had always been there for him, and that would never change.
John nodded and took Mycroft’s hand as he climbed out of bed and was led into the hallway.  Sherlock was prancing around the room giggling as Uncle Greg held out his pajama pants, and John could see that he had just been changed into a new pull-up for bed; there was a wet one on the end of the bed where he must have been stripped of it.  Sherlock wore nothing but his dinosaur pajama shirt and his pull-up; Uncle Greg was holding the matching pajama pants.
(See the end of the chapter for
John nodded again.  There was something about this information which made complete sense, something that filled in gaps in his knowledge of Sherlock and answered many questions he had had in the past.  That, however, didn't make him any less shocked about the behaviors he had seen that night.
“Gator wants you,” Bunny said, pushing the alligator plush into Sherlock’s lap, and Sherlock nodded and hugged the stuffed animal to his chest.
“I want to play dress-up,” Bunny said around a spoonful of macaroni, glancing up at his Daddy as Uncle Greg re-filled his sippy cup with milk, and Sherlock, despite initially saying dress up was for girls--a quip John knew he made not because he truly believed it but because it fit into the rougher and more boyish personality he took on when he was little--clearly hoped Mycroft would permit the game, too.
Early morning light was streaming through the slits in the curtains when John woke.  He blinked a few times as he attempted to come out of sleep and back to consciousness.  He yanked the baby blanket out from under his back, where it had bunched uncomfortably beneath him, and he pulled the pacifier out from where it had lodged beneath his neck when it had fallen out of his mouth.

He pressed himself hard against the dresser when John attempted to open the door.
“Okay,” he said.  “But just a short one?”
“I won’t,” the man said, and Mycroft sighed once more.
Mycroft gently pulled Bunny’s thumb from their mouth and held the pacifier to their lips; the kid accepted it immediately.
Edit: I came back 20 minutes after posting to add a second half to this chapter.  I wasn’t sure it was ready yet, but it felt incomplete with out it.  Please forgive my indecision and enjoy the longer version of this chapter!
They all turned to look at John, who blinked up at Sherlock, turned to Mycroft, and then nodded slowly.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said.  “This is what we have right now.  I’ll wake up your brother if I go downstairs.  No one is going to see what you’re wearing, so be a good boy and let me get you changed.”
“Just one more hour, kid,” he said.  “We’ll be there before you know it.”
Mycroft got Bunny undressed and into the bath quickly, knowing the boy most needed to be cleaned, comforted, and put to bed.  He would most like to get both Sherlock and John away from the distractions of Baker Street by bringing them to his house, but he was not going to leave Sherlock alone in his current state, and it remained to be seen whether he would agree to leave.
“I’m not hungry, Mycroft,” he said, voice argumentative yet still retaining a bit of the whininess that characterized Sherlock while little or big.  “I don’t want breakfast, and you can’t make me have it.”
“Do you want to come out?” he asked, but Bunny, pacifier in his mouth as he hugged his rabbit to his chest, shook his head.
Mycroft shook his head.
“Not a baby,” he said, knowing what Mycroft was suggesting, but the words were more hesitant than argumentative.
“I, ah...yeah,” John fumbled, suddenly plagued with thoughts of his father--his gruff, no-nonsense, unforgiving father who had teased him for a ‘momma’s boy’ when a seven-year-old John had come crying to his mother with a skinned knee and chin after toppling over the handlebars of his bike.  “It’s fine.”
His avatar was making good progress, choosing the right handholds of a crumbling mountainside as he swung from cliff sides, but his body was losing control.
“Sherlock?” Bunny whispered.
“Come here, Bunny,” Mycroft said once the timer had gone off, ending John’s punishment.
And while the insult should have done nothing but make John and Mycroft laugh, there was a tense pause which came over the room, a moment where something said aloud for the first time suddenly caused a new train of thought.  John, for his part, attempted to laugh but only succeeded in clearing his throat.  He turned back to his computer after Mycroft caught his eye once more.  He thought he could even see the doctor's cheeks pinking.  Mycroft glanced at Sherlock, who only shrugged.
“Not a baby,” Sherlock said, but he accepted the pacifier Mycroft held to his lips and, when Mycroft held out Dimitri the dinosaur, who he had rescued from where he had been tossed across the room, Sherlock latched onto the plush creature and tucked him beneath his chin.
Mycroft tossed aside the throw pillows and pulled back the duvet and the sheets so Greg could settle Sherlock into bed.  Sherlock was sleeping soundly, and Greg was pleased to see the boy had let his guard down enough to accept his pirate pacifier.
“Had an accident,” he whispered.
Bunny was feeling nonverbal, young and vulnerable and desperate to never leave his Daddy’s presence again.  He saw Uncle Greg standing not far off, Sherlock half-hidden behind him yet holding Uncle Greg’s hand; it was clear Sherlock needed his own breed of comfort.
Sherlock nodded.
“Do you want to tell Daddy what’s going on?” Mycroft asked, softening his voice and taking a seat next to Bunny on the couch.  “I might be able to help, baby boy.”
“Honey bun, Sherlock loves you,” Greg said with a sigh.  “He may not show it all the time, but he wants you to be happy and to be yourself.  If you’re feeling like a girl right now, I think it’s best that we let you be a girl and introduce you to your big brother.  He might surprise you.”
“Lastly, your Papa and your brother are very much looking forward to seeing you when we get to London, and anything that happened between you and John can be worked out with just a little bit of conversation and understanding.”  Mycroft ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.  “As for me, I believe you made some naughty choices this morning, but I do not think you are a bad boy.  You are a good boy who made some poor decisions.  Do you understand?”
It was clear Sherlock was not entirely child at the moment, pushed out of headspace as some sort of defense mechanism he was using in an attempt to keep from punishment.  But Mycroft had planned for multiple scenarios, all of which ended in the punishment he could sense Sherlock needed to resettle himself; it would not be difficult to lead his little brother down the appropriate paths to navigate to that inevitable end, adult or child.
“You’re doing so well,” Sherlock said, beginning to stroke his hand along John’s hardening cock through his pajamas.
John shook his head, not engaging with Sherlock’s stalling tactics.  He waited until Sherlock was lying prone on the bed, then began running his fingertips up and down the boy’s back, singing some half-remembered song under his breath.  Sherlock was restless for only a moment before settling down, and then his body became boneless and limp as he absently suckled on his pacifier.
John nodded, but his eyes were vulnerable when he next glanced up at Mycroft, full of his signature insecurity.
He had been naughty, but it hadn’t made him feel better.  He felt lonelier and colder than ever, curled up on the twin bed.  He sighed and swiped tears from his face as he listened to the afternoon’s forecasted rain beginning to patter with a whispered sigh against the windowpanes.
But Mycroft hadn’t anticipated the call from Anthea explaining that a political higher-up with an axe to grind was threatening exposure of governmental secrets, secrets he’d become privy to as a result of a reckless secret service member.
Sherlock was searching for the last piece of the puzzle, the final cardboard bit that would make the picture whole.
Sherlock was pleased with the way in which his shoulder ached as it pressed against the lip of the dresser's top.  He hadn’t shown Mycroft enough affection when he was in headspace, so his brother had gone and found it in Bunny.  He hadn’t been there for John as an emotional support in their relationship, so the doctor was drawn to Mycroft’s care.
Although he still seemed on-edge, perhaps even mildly frustrated, Bunny knew Sherlock was not really mad, that he had simply been surprised by being woken up in the middle of the night, that he was more than likely dealing with his own confusion that had nothing to do with Bunny.
When John glanced up at him, Sherlock’s eyes were still downcast, but there was a quirk of an eyebrow which displayed warmth and even humor.  The pain and process of his injured hand must have sobered Sherlock up a bit, must have settled him the way self-harm had in the past.
“It’s my turn to pick a game, now,” Bunny said, because that had always been the rule.  Sherlock picks, and then Bunny picks.
“I d-didn’t wanna wet my p-pants,” the boy sobbed, burying his face into Mycroft’s shoulder.  “I w-was b-big but I woke up and--and felt s-small and h-had to go so b-bad.”
“How much longer?” Sherlock asked, turning to Mycroft.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock said quietly after a moment.  He untied the sash of the dress and pulled it off of Bunny, who allowed his arms to be pulled up so the dress could be stripped of him and he could at last be taken out of the game.  Sherlock finally seemed to understand his little brother wasn’t okay, that he needed comfort because he hadn't exactly been looking out for Bunny’s needs.  Bunny knew by the somewhat frightened tone in Sherlock’s voice that he had not meant to be intentionally cruel.
Greg shook his head.  "I'm John's Uncle Greg just like I'm your Uncle Greg, kid," he said.
Mycroft, perhaps sensing John was feeling older after his spanking but likely just wanting to continue Bunny’s punishment by ensuring the reddened skin of his bum was smarting against the car seat in only the thin layer of cotton beneath his jeans--had dressed him in underwear.  It would have been far easier to wet himself in a pull-up, but there was nothing to be done, now; he would have to make do.
“One more chance?” John tried.
“That’s a good boy,” he said, but Sherlock shrugged him off and turned his attention back to his alligator, who he made walk along the table edge.  The boy still had a ways to go.
“Then you’re a girl today, honey,” Mycroft said with a shrug, reaching to wrap his hand behind Bunny's neck and to run the pad of his thumb down his little Bunny’s cheek.
They sat in the kitchen chair--Sherlock pressed against Mycroft’s chest and Mycroft running a hand up and down his back comfortingly--long enough that Papa and Bunny returned from their walk and began to get dinner ready, Bunny eager to be Papa’s helper.
Sherlock grimaced and squirmed despite the fact that Mycroft’s grip almost immediately turned to something soft and gentle.
Greg looked at him pointedly.
It seemed Mycroft sensed that he was in a conflicted state, for he paused and, instead of finishing the routine by leaning further down to place a kiss along John’s temple, stood up to his full height to eye John.
“Big boy undies,” John said, and when Mycroft looked skeptical, he begged.  "Please, Daddy," he said.
John hummed a half-hearted acknowledgement.
Bunny whined in the back of his throat.
“I’m not a child, Mycroft!” Sherlock said, kicking out at the glove compartment and knowing even in the midst of his outburst that he wasn’t exactly proving his point.
“Try not to overthink.  You love that boy more than anything in the world, Myc; anyone could see that.”
“Five more minutes,” Sherlock pleaded, words slurred around his pacifier as he nuzzled against Mycroft's shoulder.
John watched the process with sympathetic amusement, but turned back to the newspaper when he caught Greg’s eye.
Greg and Mycroft were walking back to the car, clearly having decided on a plan of action.  They opened the door on Sherlock’s side of the car, where both boys were now huddled.
“We played pirates,” Sherlock mumbled, eyes lidded as John passed him his toothbrush and reached around his shoulders to squeeze toothpaste onto the bristles.
John kissed along Sherlock’s neck and switched tactics, using the heel of his hand to press down.  He knew from experience that masturbating in a wet pull-up was equal parts stimulating and frustrating; the naughtiness of the wet material as it pressed against you was amazing, but the bulk of the soaked material made getting the right pressure from the outside a bit difficult.  The heel of the hand seemed to be the right move; Sherlock gasped and wrapped his fingers around John’s wrist to keep the pressure steady, moving to shift against John’s hand with increased intensity.
John could not help but groan a bit.  He was not ready to talk about pissing himself, which at times seemed to embarrass him even more than his need for pink.  But it had been a constant source of contemplation and self-questioning, particularly after the night before, when he’d aged up and come to realize just how much he wanted wetting to continue being a part of his ageplay experience.
John sighed.  “Sherlock isn’t allowed to suck his thumb,” he said, voice barely above a whisper.  Even so, Mycroft caught the words.
“I'll finish the dishes and start the popcorn,” Greg said, squeezing Mycroft’s hand.  “You're on pajama duty.”
John also found his stuffed lion sitting at his place along with a gift bag covered in glittery stars.  Mycroft must have told Lestrade where his lion was kept tucked away during non-ageplay times.  John blushed; that meant Lestrade must have seen his pacifiers, which he had never used before in front of Greg.
Bunny glanced up, and Greg could see the boy’s tentative smile beginning to overcome any lingering embarrassment.
“What do you say about keeping your big brother company for the rest of the night?” Greg asked as Bunny dozed on his shoulder.
Sherlock closed himself in his old bedroom, collapsing onto the narrow old mattress and not missing the crinkling of the old plastic sheet that had never been removed.  It calmed Sherlock rather than embarrassed him, and he allowed himself a quick moment of comfort, hugging his gifted sweater--it really did seem like something John would wear on a quiet Sunday morning at Baker Street--to his chest and allowing the knuckle of a finger to make its way into his mouth.
“Four,” he said, and Mycroft sighed.
It was a question he needed Sherlock to answer.  Mycroft could not—would not—reveal the horrors of their little sister before it was absolutely necessary, but if he could guide Sherlock towards remembering one key detail, he could ensure his brother believed the faulty story he was currently telling.  Sherlock’s remembered detail would seem to legitimize the preceding events, and thus he would not think to question their validity.
When Sherlock glanced up at his brother, Mycroft looked pained, as if Sherlock’s question had confirmed fears had had been harboring about Sherlock’s uneasiness.  But he quickly recovered, taking Sherlock’s bandaged hand in his own.
“They’re the same as always, Bun,” he said, knowing there were few options for pull-ups that would fit an adult, and knowing that Greg would have consulted him before trying a new brand.  “Let’s use up the rest of these ones and then we’ll open the new package, okay?”
“I’m supposed to be a big boy,” Bunny said, looking pitifully sad but, Mycroft was relieved to see, at least still making eye contact.
“You know locked doors are a no-no,” Papa chastised, daddy-mode in full effect as he guided Sherlock to stand in front of him, both hands on his shoulders.  “No exceptions.”
“You don’t have to use it,” Greg said, kneeling down so John could step into the training pants.  “But you know an accident means a pull-up.”
Sherlock looked up from where he had been making his alligator climb over his stomach, kicking his legs until Mycroft had stripped him of the wet pull-up and wiped him down.
Sherlock looked a bit uncertain, reaching down to trace the stripes along the duvet.
When Daddy reached up to graze a knuckle over the bruise on Bunny’s cheekbone, the boy jerked his head backwards to escape the attention being brought to the purpling contusion.
“What’s your problem?” the bald man asked when he saw John’s pointed stare.
There was only the sound of John’s pee for a moment more until his bladder was empty, and even after he was finished Mycroft allowed him to sit in silence for a long time, until he was ready to speak.  Mycroft had taken a seat on the edge of the bathtub, and John was grateful that the man always seemed to know when he needed space to process.
Sherlock’s question set John to crying once more, and Mycroft held him close with a cluck of his tongue, resuming the back and forth swaying that had seemed to soothe the boy moments before.
The boy emerged a bit further from the blankets, pulling his wet thumb from his lips, rubbing his eyes, and then sticking his tongue out of his mouth.  Mycroft tsked at the irritated spot on the center of John’s tongue, and knew it must be causing the boy pain when he sucked.  It would never heal if the boy continued to aggravate the sore.
The act of an adult John using such a childish endearment had the jarring effect of separating John from Mycroft, cheapening the Daddy and little boy bond the two shared by trivializing the connection they had grown to share.
“Halfway there, now,” Mycroft said.  “I can pull off at the next rest stop if you need it.”
The timer rang at the ten minute mark and Sherlock leapt up and ran to wrap his arms around John.
“Go look after our fake little Bunny upstairs,” Mycroft told Greg.  “Treat him as you would were he at his youngest.  I'll handle the pirate.”
Sherlock had always been there, in the bed they shared as both littles and, although not every night, as adults.  If they were sharing a bed when John had a nightmare, Sherlock was always already sitting up and focused when John came awake shivering and, sometimes, screaming.  And whether they were big or little, Sherlock knew just how to settle John’s mind and get Bunny back to sleep.
Bunny leaned forward and spoke softly, right into Sherlock’s ear, as if he were telling a secret.
“Exactly, sweet boy,” he said.  “You can act however you’d like.  You know your Daddy and I love you and your brother Sherlock loves you, and that’s all that matters.  But, when we’re around other people, there’s the danger of them watching and judging.  Do you understand?”
It was a gamble, given that Mycroft was as adept at deductions as Sherlock, particularly when it came to John or Sherlock, both of whom Mycroft could generally read quite easily.
He made quick work of the steps to reach Bunny, who could not help but sink down onto the top step, collapsing further into himself as soon as Papa was close.  He hoped Papa wouldn’t be disappointed that he was small while his brother was watching.  But the harrowing images of his nightmare were still circling his mind, he was in a strange place, his pants were wet, and he just didn’t have the energy to pretend anymore.
“Okay, princess” Greg said as John drank.  “Let’s get you sorted.”
Despite his police-officer toughness, Greg had brought a gentleness to Mycroft’s life that he had never felt before.  Here was comfort and understanding, a space within which to show another human being his true self.
I’d love to get a Christmas-themed one-shot up in the near future if I can.  I’ve been feeling like I may need a teeny writing break from the heaviness of this story at the moment, so a one-shot would be a perfect way to break out of the mold, so to speak.  I don’t think it will be up before Christmas, but potentially a few days after!  Let me know if you have any one-shot storyline suggestions!
“Why do you feel that way, Bun?” Mycroft asked.  “From what I understand, Uncle Greg was very kind about letting you pick out all kinds of nice things today at the store.”  Far too many things, was on the tip of Mycroft’s tongue--god only knew why Greg felt such a strong desire to spoil the boys.
Sherlock relented, letting his crossed arms drop as he began to move towards the door with a whine.  But just because he understood Mycroft’s job responsibilities did not mean he had to be happy about them.  He stomped his way out of the room, down the hallway, and all the way up the stairs--as loudly as he could--to prove his point that Mycroft was nothing but a mean big brother.
When Sherlock was caught up in depressive states while still in little space, it generally meant the boy slipped a bit younger than usual, that he became disinterested in the mischief-making that so often brought him joy and mental stimulation.  Mycroft had grown accustomed to all of Sherlock’s states and knew that Sherlock did not currently need affection and comfort; what he needed was help getting changed in order to get his mind off negative thoughts.
Hi, loves--thanks for all your lovely support of this new story!  Here's chapter 3!
“Sure, Bun,” he said.  “I’ll stay once I’m back.”
“Sherlock?” he asked, approaching this time with concern.
It was only after he had cried himself into a blank emptiness and sat through his time-out, only as he was being carried upstairs, wrapped in Uncle Greg’s arms, that he felt in control of himself once more, that he settled back into his body.
They both knew Mycroft could very well have arrived later in the day, and they both knew he was hoping the early-morning wake-up call would catch Sherlock at his most pliable; experience had made it abundantly clear that Sherlock was most compliant when especially tired, whether little or adult.
Mycroft was taken aback by his brother’s physicality, but when he glanced back in anger he was met with tears in the kid’s eyes.
“We do not throw things in this house, young man,” Mycroft said, standing from the chair at his desk and crossing toward the couch.  “You’ve earned yourself a timeout.”
Bunny hung his head and pushed the ketchup around on his plate with the tail of a dinosaur chicken nugget.  He tried not to be upset with his Daddy; he’d had a busy few days, and Bunny hadn’t exactly been the easiest kid that day, what with running away from Uncle Greg at the store and then wetting himself when he was crying in his bedroom.
“Don’t need it,” John said shortly before climbing out of the passenger seat and heading towards the service station, presumably to use the loo.
“There were bad thoughts all morning,” he said, unable to make eye contact.  “But I was distracted by the telly until I…”
“Sentiment,” he said with a sneer, but there was understanding in his eye when he glanced up at John, a joke about the ways in which Sherlock stubbornly refused to acknowledge just how much he loved his boyfriend.
“And now he’s closed himself in his bedroom?” Mycroft asked.
He watched the pedestrians on the London sidewalks, not bothering to map out the route they were driving to Mycroft's.  He had wanted to stay at Baker street, where the younger side of himself felt comforted by how familiar and cozy it was and the older side of himself knew he could retreat back into his adult life if he was unable to fully settle back down in age.  But they were already on their way, and unless he did something quickly, he would be pulled fully out of headspace and back to the stressors of his adult life before they even made it to Mycroft’s.  The past few days had been trying; he wanted a day of simple calm while little, not a day of vacillating headspaces lurching him unceremoniously back to adulthood.
“No, Daddy,” he whined, feeling just as frustrated as he was sad.  He didn't want his Daddy to touch the tender spot on his skin.  He stomped a foot in irritation even as he blinked back tears.
John could see that, despite the embarrassment, a part of Sherlock enjoyed playing the shame-faced, regressive potty trainer--when he was regressed, his wettings didn’t have to be as much of a catastrophe as when he miscalculated while at home running experiments, or, even worse, out in public.  It wasn’t out of the question for young children to have accidents, and although pants wetting would be a bit surprising for the age of child Sherlock most often settled into--around six to eight years of age--accidents were not entirely out of the realm of normalcy.
“Please, Mycroft,” he said quietly.  “I need you to.”
Bunny mumbled something into the pillow that Mycroft could not decipher.
Hope you're all doing well <3
He shifted the boy onto his hip and stood from the bed, carrying him towards the window as Sherlock gave into his tears.  Mycroft did not acknowledge them, knowing the boy would only deny that he’d been crying.
Another 18 hours and 16 minutes, Sherlock calculated, glancing at the clock hung over his mother’s doctorate diploma.  18 hours and 16 minutes until it would be 4pm tomorrow and he and Mycroft would finally be justified in leaving their parents’ house for the safety of London.  Even the long drive seemed welcomed at this point, if it meant he was on the downhill sprint away from Christmas with his parents.
“Drawing a hurricane there, sport?” he asked with a smirk, and Bunny dissolved into another of her snorting fits of giggling.
Greg and Mycroft, who were usually annoyingly insistent that the boys not go longer than they deemed healthy without time to be young, had not expended their usual energy to encourage the men to age down over the course of the previous few weeks, both seemingly wrapped up in work and busy on weekends.  They popped by from time to time, sometimes even came close to coddling and mother-henning.  But there were no invitations for sleepovers at Mycroft’s flat, no talk of excursions under Greg’s care, and definitely no extended time for ageplay.
“Come on,” Sherlock said, and John stood from the bed as he took hold of the hand Sherlock was holding out to him.
Sherlock whined again but obeyed, and Greg kissed Mycroft, assuring him once again that all would be fine before calling down the hallway towards Bunny’s room, where he had seen John retreat, likely in order to get dressed in something a bit more appropriate for the public eye than joggers and a t-shirt.
He placed his palms against the boy’s cheeks and then the back of his hand against his forehead.  The boy did feel clammy, his forehead warm and cheeks flushed.  He glanced up at Greg, eyebrow raised.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s okay.  Your Daddy will be here, soon,” he said.  “I’ll stay with you until he gets here.”
“Nothing,” Bunny said, the words only coming with effort because he felt exposed and trapped and emotionally vulnerable.  “Was big.”
Mycroft knew John would have filled Sherlock in on his understanding of the events as they had occurred the day before, and thus he was well aware his brother was currently attempting to piece together an explanation.  Sherlock’s powers of deduction were well-honed, but his blind spots generally revolved around his own emotional stakes.  It was unlikely Sherlock would deduce every hidden memory Mycroft had been protecting him from, at least not from only the scattered, second-hand information he had at hand.  But he was too discerning not to recall something, and that was what Mycroft was banking on.
“Sherlock?  Is everything alright?”
Bunny said nothing, seemingly paralyzed by the blooming wetness in the crotch of his underwear.  He squeezed the hand between his legs he had been holding himself with, but otherwise he remained as still as possible, somehow young enough to think that if he didn’t move a muscle, Sherlock wouldn’t notice.
When he reached his room, Sherlock threw himself across the bed and gave into the tantrum he’d wanted to pitch in Mycroft’s office, yelling and crying as he pressed his face into his pillows.
“No.”
John nodded into Mycroft’s shoulder.
Sherlock breathed out hard and turned his gaze to Mycroft.
Note: edited to include tumblr link--sorry the link was broken in my profile!
“Mycroft?...Papa?...”
Whether Sherlock understood just how close he was to the edge, sensed that John was as emotionally spent as he was, or simply welcomed a bit of coddling as long as John didn’t name it out loud, John didn’t know.  Whatever the reason, Sherlock let his phone drop onto the carpet as he unfurled himself from the chair.  He wrapped his dressing gown around himself and shuffled into the kitchen to take a seat.
John shrugged.
“The loo is just across the hall,” she told him as she turned on the bedroom light and crossed the small room to the foot of the wooden bunk bed, where she opened an antique chest and took out a woven blanket.  “The bunk beds are old, but comfortable.  Greg’s used to be the bottom bunk, but you can take your pick.”
Sherlock was staring at the footwell, hands in his lap and sitting stiffly.
“This was…” Mycroft paused, attempting to find the right words.  “...a planned occurrence?”
Bunny shrugged again.
Mycroft did not understand what appeal the chatrooms brought to his brother--the crimes discussed were generally simple and mundane, neighborhood disputes Sherlock could solve in mere moments with the right evidence or unsolved cases from years ago fraught with conspiracy theories and false opinions.  Mycroft assumed he actually took more pleasure from insulting the intelligence of the amateur armchair detectives who posted leads and question to the sites than from solving the cases or providing leads.
Despite the boy’s distress, it was comforting to find John aged down, and Mycroft ran his thumb over the boy’s flushed cheek to wipe at his tears.  Bunny turned to glance up at him, eyes glossy and lower lip trembling.
Mycroft sighed, then leaned over to kiss Greg.
Sherlock blinked back the tears, opening his eyes only once he had finished peeing.
John nodded, and pointed to one of the takeaway menus that Greg had spread out in front of him.  He was feeling a bit non-verbal at the moment, content to suck his thumb and nod or shake his head while Greg read out the menu of the Chinese restaurant.  Mycroft said it was okay when John didn’t feel like talking, as long as he made sure to always be upfront about his needs.  Once Greg had called it in their order, he retreated to the bathroom and John could hear the tub filling.
“I need to apologize to him,” he said, and Greg nodded.  Mycroft could see the relief in his countenance, the way some of the tension left his broad shoulders.  Here was another reminder of Greg’s kindness towards the boys, of his ability to see what, at times, Mycroft could not.
Mycroft led John to the bed, where they sat on the end of the mattress.  John pulled a leg under himself to get more comfortable; Mycroft sat as straight-backed and still as ever.
“I don’t mind,” Mycroft said.
“I’m fine,” John said, “Just, you know, bad dreams.”
Greg sighed.  He wished his boys had the freedom to act the way they wanted at all times.   But there were precautions he needed to take to save John’s pride and emotional well-being when they were out in public.
“It’s not something I’ve explored before,” John began.  “But even as early as that day Sherlock came back from the drug den and wet himself in front of me, it’s become a preoccupation.  I’ve...been ashamed to admit it to myself.”
“Feel yucky, Daddy,” he said, burying his face in his Daddy’s shoulder.
Greg chuckled and ruffled the boy’s hair.  The kid was too cute for his own good.
Hi, loves!
And it was exactly what Mycroft needed to hear.
It wasn't often when he had to go this badly in the middle of the night that he woke up before his bladder released into his pull-up and bedsheets.  He'd been a bedwetter basically all of his life; his body had never been particularly skilled at waking him up when he needed to go.  The wettings had been much worse when he was younger, when he wet almost every other night.  Mycroft had been the one he went to then, before he was old enough to change his sheets himself.  He calmed Sherlock and cleaned him up, thankfully never feeling the need to tell their parents.
“You can do it, yourself,” Mycroft said to appease him, guiding Sherlock out of the corner and down the hallway, where he deposited the boy in front of the bathroom door.
John’s face crumpled as he took his thumb out of his mouth and began to cry.  He looked pitifully broken as he stood in the kitchen and the tears streamed down his face.  Mycroft was taken aback.  He had never seen the man cry while in head space apart from a few scattered nights when John’s PTSD reared its head in the form of violent nightmares.  The tears then had been unsurprising.  The nightmares John described were intense for even adult John, so it was no wonder they impacted little John. But Mycroft was not used to John’s tears in the daylight, and certainly not around Sherlock or Lestrade. John had always seemed to hold himself back from full emotional release when not impacted by a nightmare, had always seemed to be too self conscious to let go in that way.
“Uncle Greg said I had to,” he mumbled, but Sherlock had already moved on.  He was pulling on a pair of white and black striped trousers far too big in the waist and a blousy collared shirt which ballooned out at the arms.  He strung the shirt on over his own pirate shirt, the long-sleeved t-shirt that Sherlock was rarely without when in headspace.  He found some old pieces of rope which he tied around his waist as a belt.  More than likely he thought a pirate wouldn’t have used a real belt.
John paused where he had stood from the bed to stared up at Mycroft, and any trace of the needy little boy--his sweet little Bunny--was absent from his gaze.
John sighed, not realizing until that moment that it was exactly what he had needed to hear.  Even so, he was not sure he could fully believe Mycroft until they had spoken further.
Bunny let her face fall into Papa’s shoulder, feeling happy and sleepy now that she knew Papa was home safe from work.  It was such a relief after feeling the pull for him all morning, and she never wanted him to leave ever again.
And because they were overtired or because they had simply been waiting for a reason to let the tension and stress of the morning go, the boys, after a moment of stillness, broke into joint peals of contagious laughter, suddenly overcome with breathless joy as expressed by infectious cackling.
“I’m proud of you, Bunny,” he said breath warm against Bunny’s ear.  “Very proud of my brave girl.”
“Yeah?”
He followed Greg to the far side of the bedroom, where Greg was pulling on dress trousers and an undershirt.  Mycroft had a point; after Sherlock’s moody struggle to age down the day before and John’s gender confusion and PTSD-induced nightmares, they were all on edge.  But Greg had been working on this particular case for months, and he was not about to let Dimmock screw it up simply because the man was suddenly on some sort of power trip.
Sherlock could see that Mycroft was going to argue, that he was getting ready to insist that Sherlock wear a pull-up to bed.  There was only one way to distract him at the moment, only one way to get him to stop the fight.
John realized he had been holding his breath.  His cheeks pinked as he wondered if Sherlock had picked up on his emotional state, had realized John had been fighting the vulnerability he only allowed himself when little.  Had it been that obvious?  He thought he’d done a fair enough job of stifling his feelings.  Sherlock was crap when it came to emotions, and if he’d been able to see John slipping into a vulnerable state, others may have as well.  He was angry at himself, disappointed for letting his emotions enter into a case to the point that it had distracted Sherlock.  A final text ping came through.
“Makes sense, actually,” he’d shrugged, taking in the information with far less confusion and concern than John had previously.  Mycroft had had a far harder time calming Sherlock down once his brother learned he had been found out by Lestrade than he had explaining the pieces of the lifestyle to Greg.
John was not in the mood to speak, let alone associate with men too dimwitted to realize they were disrespecting both the dead and the grieving for the sake of their own twisted sense of humor.  It had always been Sherlock who had issues with Anderson, but John was beginning to understand his aversion to the pathetic rat and his team.
John could see that the boy was listening to what he had to say, and he hoped that would remain the case when he moved from empathy to chastising.  It was true he had a sense of where Sherlock’s tantrum had come from, but that didn’t mean the words hadn’t been harmful and painful on multiple levels, to both his young and adult self.
Bunny immediately stepped close to Mycroft, who, clearly recognizing the kid’s red-rimmed eyes, gathered the kid close and began running fingers through their hair.  The kids’ favorite stuffies had been gathered and placed on the couch, and Bunny reached for Willa, tucking her under an arm.
“Well, next time I bloody someone’s nose, I’ll make sure you’re around,” John said.
“I don’t know, yet,” Mycroft said, eyes distant.  “But I’ll figure it out.”
“Daddy,” Bunny giggled, stretching out the vowels of the word as if embarrassed that Mycroft had drawn attention to his nakedness.
How could he have been so careless?  Mycroft had explained how important it was that they fill Sherlock in on the new dynamic between him and John at the right time, which, Mycroft explained, would likely be the next time Sherlock aged up.
“See? Asleep before bedtime,” Greg teased when the kids were breathing gently.  “Just what you wanted.”
“Your turn, little pirate,” Papa called.
John could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.
The worry was not a new one.  Ageplay had the potential to release old memories; Mycroft knew that and was meticulously careful to assess Sherlock’s recollections of childhood by using trigger words after every extended ageplay session as a test of his brother’s state of mind.  He had initially been worried that introducing John as another little would stir up his brother’s memories of playing pirates with his childhood best friend; however, since John had begun slipping into headspace Mycroft had increased his testing of Sherlock’s memory--most recently just a day after the weekend at the lake--and was satisfied that Sherlock remained ignorant of the incident with Victor Trevor.
Sherlock crossed to John and pressed the plastic dinosaur into his hand.
He covered his eyes with his forearm and squirmed around in place as he peed, knowing the pull-ups could not always take full wettings.  The warmth spread across his front, down between his legs, and then around to his bum before pooling in the crotch of the pull-up, saturating the padding and turning it heavy.  Sherlock pressed and squirmed and kneaded in order to gain control once more.  His bladder was nearly empty by the time he could stop himself, however, and Sherlock blinked back tears, his throat tight from the desire to cry.  Not again.
It was when Mycroft attempted to stand and leave the room that Sherlock found himself involuntarily keening in the back of his throat.  Both brothers paused, neither able to process what Sherlock’s longing, desperate sound meant.  They blinked at each other for a moment.
Sherlock nodded, pulling the cup away from his lips and reaching for his spoon.  It was a bit of a challenge to get Sherlock to eat more than three bites of his grilled cheese, but he ate all of his soup and half of John’s when it was offered to him, so John didn’t push.  Food was hard for Sherlock at times, and that was okay.
Mycroft opened his paper once more.  “Not in time out,” he said.  “Boys who are punished for misbehaving do not get toys during their punishment.”
“What happened to the baby?” he asked with a concerned glance towards John.  “Did he have a bad dream, too?”
John nodded.  “It’s okay, actually.  I like being Sherlock’s younger brother, and his teasing solidifies that role for us.  It’s never malicious, although I do wish he would stop calling me ‘baby.’  I’m not a baby.”  It was clear the term truly bothered John.
“Not that I remember,” Sherlock said.  “I was in fairly deep, however, and details don’t stick as well as they would otherwise.  Part of the appeal, generally.”
"You talked about the Australian boy all fall," Sherlock said.  "You wrote to him at night."
Sherlock said nothing, but he nodded, and John could breathe again.  He reached out and took Sherlock’s uninjured hand, glad when the other man didn’t yank away from his touch.
He could not help but feel a desperate protectiveness over the kids, and as he lifted Bunny in his arms and carried him to the kitchen to wait his turn to be sunscreened, he hoped that, even though they were all heading back to London and the regular routine of jobs and separate apartments, there would not be a long stretch of time before he had the chance to care for his boys again.  He saw how much it meant to them, and he never felt quite so content or quite so connected to Mycroft as he did when they were Papa and Daddy.
“Is that the only reason, baby?”
The truth of the matter was that John could not keep from thinking about Mycroft.  Despite his attempts to keep his mind on the footie game, his thoughts continued to wander towards the man’s willingness to drop whatever it was he had been doing in order to comfort John during his earlier hour of need.  If John hadn’t turned Mycroft away, he would currently be snuggled beside his Daddy with his pacifier and stuffed rabbit.
“Shush, now,” Mycroft said, rocking the boy back and forth and catching Greg’s sympathetic eye over the top of Bunny’s head.  “It’s okay.  You’re okay.”
“To admit what?” Mycroft asked.  He needed to force him to say the words, to force him to come to terms with what he wanted..
“Dunno,” he said.  “Is that okay?”
A pause while Mycroft spoke, and then John turned away from Sherlock, speaking quietly as if to keep the other man from hearing.
Bunny was confused by the layout of his Daddy’s house.  He wasn’t even sure he would have been able to find his own way from his bedroom to the breakfast table that morning if Papa hadn’t led him down, so it was no easy feat to find a room that would make a good hiding spot.
“Want to get dressed, Daddy,” he said, standing in the hallway while his Daddy kept walking.
"Did you stop liking me?" Bunny asked.
“Good boy,” Mycroft praised.
Hi, loves!
Sherlock whined, tears filling his eyes.
“Half an hour,” Mycroft corrected.  He knew Sherlock had not misheard.
The liquid had pooled in the center of the mattress where Sherlock sat, so he could not help but make more of a mess as he got out of bed, dripping urine from the heavy pull-up as well as the thin cotton of his dinosaur pajamas.  He felt just like he had when he was very young, scared to be found out and desperate for his brother to make things right.  Bunny was far from his mind.
It certainly looked like Uncle Greg, sitting against the wall with his knees bent and his arms crossed over his knees, dressed in an old police t-shirt and thin cotton pajama pants.
“Alright, loves,” Greg called as he returned with armfuls of take-away bags.  “Dinnertime and then presents!”
-No further instructions until tomorrow.-
“Sit up for just a minute and take this for me, ‘Lockie,” Greg said as he measured out the correct dose of cough medicine.
“Is your tummy bothering you, kiddo?” Papa asked, sitting at the head of the table after placing a sippy cups of orange juice in front Bunny and a half-filled baby bottle of orange juice in front of Sherlock.  And since when did Sherlock drink from a bottle?  “You’ve barely eaten a bite.”
Thanks as always for your kind words!  You're all so sweet and I'm glad you're enjoying reading as much as I love writing about little Sherlock and little Bunny.  Let me know what you'd like to see while the boys are at the lake house!
“It’s peaceful,” John said, listening to the trickling of a stream not far off.
Sherlock understood why John would be angry; he had been out of touch for three days, away from the flat battling his need for drugs now that their case had finished and left him nothing more than a hollow sense of purposelessness.  John had seen the pattern before: the drugs were a welcome relief, but their hold upon Sherlock was fleeting at best, and the more Sherlock took, the more helpless and depressed he felt upon coming out of the haze.  But that didn't make Sherlock's actions any easier on his boyfriend, he knew.  Later, John would ask what had brought Sherlock back to the flat that night, and Sherlock would explain that he had snapped out of a high quicker than he ever had before, knowing that what he actually needed was far simpler than grimy needles and drug dens in abandoned city buildings.
Hope you enjoy!
John ran a hand along the back of his neck, cheeks pinking.
He knew John found it easier to accept care than to ask for care, and it was clear the man needed care right now.  Mycroft was not about to sit back and let the man suffer out of some stubborn pride or self-consciousness.  He could not keep from thinking just how small John had sounded on the phone.
“It’s beautiful,” he said, and he, winking at the boys, taking Mycroft’s hand, was speaking about more than just the rabbit.
John finished getting dressed for the day and met Sherlock in the kitchen, where the man was scanning the crime section of the Times.  Sometime between starting the laundry and joining Sherlock in the shower, John’s head had begun to pound, and the sight of the cereal Sherlock had poured himself caused John’s stomach to churn. After the arousal and the stimulation of the morning in bed, John's body had unfortunately decided to remind him that he’d had far too much to drink the night before.
Sherlock ducked his head down against his chin and shrugged while Papa stepped around the counter, crossed to the table, and reached to tickle a rather messy Bunny, who squealed in laughter and then let Papa wipe his face clean of ketchup and crumbs.
"Bunny's okay," John said, voice obstructed by the pacifier.
“I’ll do it!” John yelled in fear when Greg reached for his clothes.
Sherlock grumbled and shrugged.  He did think he meant it, but he could tell Uncle Greg didn't want him to think that.
He nodded and turned to play with the toys.  He had voiced his needs, John told himself; he didn’t have to speak otherwise if he didn’t feel up to it.  And he did not feel up to it at the moment.
Greg fought the urge to laugh off the question as a way to diffuse the awkwardness, but his brother was handling the conversation carefully and maturely; it was only right that Greg do the same.   He took a breath and set his beer aside, running a hand over the back of his neck.
“Go check on our kid,” Greg said.  “Then get him to sleep.  I don’t think I’ve ever been this relieved to reach naptime in my life.”
Sherlock cleared his throat and settled against the back of his chair.
Mycroft rolled his eyes.  His boyfriend, ever the ardent optimist.
“Hands all washed?” Greg was asking Sherlock when Mycroft entered the kitchen and placed John in a chair that Greg pulled away from the table.
This chapter has some of my favorite things: bossy Sherlock, vulnerable John, wetting, and lots of angst.  I haven't forgotten about the ideas you've all given me (I think the most recent ones are John/Sherlock suffering from some type of ailment, John being put in time out, and Sherlock sinking younger in headspace than John--remind me if I've forgotten yours).  I'll do my best to find a way to add them in when I can!
Daddy came back with medicine and hot cocoa.  He made each boy blow their nose and take a spoonful of yucky medicine before they could have their treat.  Sherlock cried when he swallowed down his medicine, and Daddy lifted him into his arms and carried him to the couch, where he cradled him while he fed him his bottle of hot cocoa.
“I’ll make you a snack, buddy,” Mycroft said.
“Who needs a diaper change?” he asked.
Bunny lifted his head when he caught a quick glimpse of a cartoon that looked to be following colorful ponies on rainbows.
“There’s something to this, Greg,” Mycroft explained.
“Okay.”
He could picture the doctor: still half-asleep and quite likely cocooned beneath the tousled blankets, face drawn and lined from sleep.  He had half a mind to climb the steps and check on him, worried the man was not prepared for his trip back home.  But he couldn’t coddle if he expected them to remain adult, and he had to get Sherlock out of the house while the man was still half-agreeable.
Alone with Mycroft in the bedroom that was his for the weekend, John was relieved to no longer have to so closely guard against adulthood.  It seemed there was a silver lining to him and Sherlock being placed in separate rooms.
“Come on now, it can’t be as bad as all that, now, can it?” Greg asked good-humoredly, knowing that keeping his own countenance light when Mycroft’s was dark was the only way to keep them moving forward, the only way to coax Mycroft out of his own mind.
Greg paused at the doorway.  He turned around and came to rest on the edge of the bed next to where John lay.
“Sherlock?”
“You need to tell Papa right away if you have to wee, love,” Greg said, patting Sherlock’s thigh to let him know they were all finished with the change.  “We don’t want your rash to get worse if you have any little accidents.”
“For sucking my thumb when I’m not allowed to today,” he said.
Bunny was clearly as invested in the rare opportunity to watch cartoons as Sherlock was, and it was nice to have someone to watch with.
“Daddy?” Bunny called when Sherlock had been led halfway to the time-out corner.
Mycroft knew now how he would deal with his kid brother and his newly recruited sidekick, Bunny.  Greg was right.  More than anything, Sherlock needed to know that, no matter what he did or how he acted, Mycroft would not leave him, that Mycroft would not suddenly prefer the more sweet-tempered John over him.
“Okay, John,” Sherlock said, voice husky from sleep as he sat up in bed and ran a hand down his face, seemingly to wake himself up.  He had clearly noticed that John was in an adult headspace.
John had glanced up from where he was sitting at the desk in front of his computer screen to give a lackluster hum of acknowledgement.  He’d been updating the blog and was not too keen to be pulled from the memories of a now-distant case.  As it was, the events had taken more than a bit of effort to recall.  He was currently struggling to capture the frenetic pace of the events of the crime without appearing cavalier and without going into more detail than was necessary.  He continued typing, not wanting to lose his current train of thought.
It was almost a blessing in disguise; Greg would rather discourage the boy from sucking his thumb or pacifier because he didn't want to further aggravate the sore on his tongue than because he didn't want close-minded people to stare, point, or tease.
John buried his face into Mycroft’s shoulder.
Greg had cleared away the lunch dishes and was sitting at the kitchen table, waiting.  He’d made coffee, and a cup sat across from him at the table. Mycroft sat in front of the waiting mug, nodding his thanks.
Mycroft really had gotten creative with decorating each of the spare bedrooms for the boys.  Bunny’s room had been painted a pastel yellow, and Mycroft had managed to find a duvet cover decorated with sleeping forest creatures--fawns, bear cubs, wolf cubs, and baby bunnies--among scattered trees, stumps, and leaves.  On the window seat at the far side of the room were throw-pillows decorated with images from the night sky, the dark blue contrasting with the pale yellow of the walls.  Bunny--snuggled beneath the new duvet with his stuffed rabbit, Willa, and his Peter Rabbit pacifier, looked perfectly content.
Sherlock was propped up on his elbows, hovering just above John, memorizing the way his forehead sheened with sweat.  John’s hand came to find the closest of Sherlock’s, fingers intertwining in a gesture of gratefulness.  But Sherlock could not help but tease.
“Ma, you can’t treat everyone like they’re your grandchildren,” Greg said with the breath of a laugh, unsure how else to gauge the situation.  He leaned onto the jut of countertop where he used to eat cereal as a kid, one foot finding traction on the lowest rung of a kitchen stool as he watched her put a tray of brownies to warm in the oven.  “John is a grown man.”
“I love you too, baby girl.”
“I need help,” Sherlock said, glancing down to his bandaged hand.
But, hunched in the closet and breathlessly waiting to be punished, Sherlock could see that he’d made a whole string of bad decisions.  He shouldn’t have taken his own frustrations out on Bunny, who was just trying to find happiness, and he should have talked to Mycroft when he had the chance instead of pretending he didn’t want breakfast just to be difficult.  He was disappointed in himself, and he felt the pull to be little stronger than ever.
“No, Daddy.  I’m big.  Don’t need it.”
“Feel yucky, Papa,” Bunny mumbled around his pacifier, reaching up a hand to rub at an eye.
Sherlock blinked up at his brother, still in tears.
“None of that, now,” Greg said, chuckling at the boy’s clinginess.  “Your Daddy and Sherlock are waiting for us.  You don’t want your brother to open all the presents from Santa, do you?”
“It’s a new day and you’re a big boy,” Mycroft said, caring more for his brother’s self-esteem at the moment than for upholding the household rules.  The dinosaur briefs were training pants, reinforced with extra fabric in case of leaks, but Mycroft knew the boy still saw them as big boy undies, and that was what mattered.
“Okay, okay,” Papa said when he realized the effect his soft words had on Sherlock.  “I’m sorry, bud.  I’ll, ah…”
“Bad dream,” he said, and his face became pinched, as if he were remembering it once more and in danger of dissolving into tears.  “I couldn’t find Redbeard.”
“Fine,” he said.
Hope you're all doing better than last time we connected (the consensus seemed to be that everyone was having pretty tough weeks).  Sending love and bunny kisses!
“Okay, little Bunny?” he asked quietly, knowing Sherlock would tease if he sensed his little brother’s uneasiness over the movie. Greg had promised the movie would be okay for the kiddos, but Mycroft was beginning to think he may not have taken into account just how sensitive their youngest could be.
,” Greg said, pulling teasingly at the end of Mycroft’s Santa hat to make the bell in its white pom-pom jingle.
“I’ll bring up the baby,” Greg said, carefully shifting Sherlock so that he could carry him up the stairs.  “Give me a moment and I’ll come back to help you with Bunny.”
“I’ll handle Sherlock,” Mycroft said, knowing there were both apologies to be made and punishments to be doled out.  “You need to punish the Bunny.”
“You said 'goodnight' to him after you brushed your teeth, remember?”
“Talk to him, love,” Greg said.  “That’s generally how questions of motivation are answered.”
John was breathless, blissfully happy in the trust that, as much as he knew what Sherlock liked, Sherlock knew what John liked--sometimes before John even knew it himself.  John had played into Sherlock’s humiliation kink; it was Sherlock’s turn to play into John’s praise kink.
John glanced around the pub.  It was a quiet night, and those who were still around seemed far too drunk or absorbed with their own issues to notice two blokes sitting together in a booth.  John allowed himself to settle back down into his half-drunk state, and slipped into the seat beside Sherlock.
It was Uncle Greg, his presence bright and too loud.  Sherlock peeked up as Uncle Greg entered the kitchen, the Bunny, clutching his stuffed lion to his chest and sucking on his Peter Rabbit pacifier, trailing behind him, which only served to throw Sherlock into a renewed anger.
It was a bit like the day at the zoo--he felt, more than anything, a desire to give in to the feelings of helplessness.   Needing to go but staying exactly where he was next to Uncle Greg would let him to sink deeper into headspace, would allow him to feel vulnerable in a way he rarely allowed himself to get.  The thoughts crowding his mind were eliminated when he became solely focused on his bladder, and not having to think about how much he missed Mycroft or where Sherlock was or how long Uncle Greg would let him stay little was rather appealing at the moment.
“I am,” Sherlock snapped, tellingly sounding more disgruntled teenager than adult man.  He kicked his legs down off of the seat and crossed his arms over his chest, letting his scarf--which he'd been clutching as if it were a comfort item--fall to his lap.  “Leave me alone.”
They had retired to the living room for the evening, bourbon glasses in hand.
Mycroft lifted the suitcase from the floor and crossed back through the flat.
Thank you all for your lovely comments on the previous chapter and for your well-wishes! It's been a rough week and a half, but things are starting to look up, and I'm hopeful all will work out.  I promise I will respond to all of your kind, sweet comments as soon as I can.  For now, while I had a moment to get some writing done, I wanted to give you all a much-deserved update!
“You didn’t know little John in his earliest stages of ageplay,” Mycroft said.  “You didn’t see how unsure of himself he was, how eager he was to fit specifically into whatever he thought was wanted of him.  It was Sherlock who created Bunny, Greg.  Not John.  I worry that John is playing a character, that he feels more comfortable separating himself as much as possible from his adult self than he does finding his actual personality in headspace, that he somehow thinks this is the role he should be playing.”
“Well, for the sake of argument let’s pretend I’ve given you sufficient time to hem and haw over the embarrassment you feel regarding your choice to identify as female while young yesterday and move along to what made you age up and leave Mycroft’s flat so abruptly.”
John could not stand to see Sherlock quite so undone.
John had to hold back tears as the pain and stress of the day threatened to overwhelm him once more.  Any other time he would have had a hard time asking for comfort while adult, but he wasn’t fully adult at the moment, and was feeling rather overwhelmed in his exhaustion.  Even still, there was a limit to what he could currently accept by way of coddling.
Mycroft should get the boy dressed in something warmer than a lone pull-up, especially considering the fact that both he and Sherlock were working to overcome illness, but it was clear the boy needed attention and affection at the moment, and Mycroft could press the boy close to keep him warm.
This chapter is one of the first that really delves into the dynamic between the four characters as a unit, so it's been challenging fun to write.  The next chapter will explore the boys' first nights sleeping apart, which I know some of you commented you're interested to see.
Bunny didn’t want to leave Sherlock’s room.  He had wet his bed the night before and didn’t know if Papa had put clean sheets on his bed.  Even if his bed was clean, Bunny felt too miserable and yucky to be alone.  He wanted to be close to Sherlock if he couldn’t have Daddy or Papa.
“Princess, let’s take a quick break from the movie and get up for a change,” Mycroft said softly, reaching for the remote.
Mycroft clucked his tongue.
Bunny had to wait only a moment with her eyes squeezed shut before Papa placed something oddly shaped into her waiting hands.
“I hid it because I was ashamed,” he continued. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed in me.”
Gathering clothes for what was promising to be a sunny, clear day, Mycroft wondered if the plan he and Greg had discussed last night--canoeing and swimming with the boys in the lake--would be possible given Sherlock’s current state of mind.  He decided to deal with the day moment by moment; his first priority would be to ensure that Sherlock was okay.
He underestimated the way his heart would begin racing as soon as he finally heard footsteps climbing the staircase, and at the thought that he was about to get caught once and for all, he felt his hand growing warm and wet in his crotch.  He was peeing in his pants.
“Your brother doesn’t have accidents at night, ‘Lock,” Mycroft said.  “Every little boy is different.”
“Just helping you out a bit,” Sherlock said, grinning devilishly before his fingers began skirting John’s stomach and sides.
“I know, sweetheart,” he said, voice low and gentle.
Mycroft placed the chart on the counter so he could step forward and rest a hand on his brother’s cheek while he took the empty sippy cup from his hand.
“Idiot,” Sherlock spat, “That was a toad, not a frog.”
John felt himself go still.  Their case in Scotland had not involved animals of any kind, and there certainly wasn’t a rabbit in their flat waiting to be passed over to the authorities.  John could feel his heartbeat in his neck.  There was only one bunny Sherlock was currently associating with: John himself.
“I’m a big boy! Don’t tell, John,” he whined, beginning to cry once more.
Sherlock felt alone being the only one awake and the rain and the house was scary and what if Mycroft liked Bunny better than him?  Bunny was well behaved and cute and quiet, and Sherlock was a spoiled brat.  It was no wonder his brother had chosen the Bunny over him.  Sherlock turned to run out of the master bedroom before he woke up his brother with his sniffling.  He tripped on the slight wooden lip in the doorway where the hardwood from the hallway met the carpet of the bedroom, which only made it harder to hold back his tears, but he regained his footing after a quick stumble and was quickly back in his room.  He closed the door and caught his breath.
He slipped away when everyone was distracted by the suggestion that all the kids take pictures with their new toys from grandma and grandpa, something that seemed to be a Christmas Eve tradition.  He found himself back in the now-empty dining room, collapsing back into the chair he had perched in with a fake smile as he'd suffered through dinner.  He pulled his knees to his chest and pressed his face against them, struggling to hold back tears.  He didn’t want to be there, anymore.  He felt little, and he wanted Papa to come and bundle him up and take him away.
“I’ll be just a boy, Daddy,” he said, voice desperate as he tried to hiccup back his tears.  “I’ll be only a good boy, okay?”
“Bun?  Are you in here, sweetheart?”
“Something Uncle Greg said to you?”
Sherlock gaped at his brother.
"I felt as if I’d failed him," Mycroft admitted. "He’d called me before and I’d been frustrated with him, short.  I insisted he continue to stick it out, told him he’d never make it in the world if he dropped out of university. But, when I arrived, it was clear he was in no state to stay, that this was something far more than homesickness.  I arranged for him to be unenrolled, and I brought him home.”
“Remember, this isn’t London, kiddo,” Uncle Greg said as he entered the living room and came up behind them.  “Not as many people out and about.  Also, less chance of running into anyone you know.”
He cast a glance around the room for John--surprised to find he wasn’t in the chair where he’d last seen him--before making his way to the kitchen.  His mum was taking a cherry pie out of the oven, and she set it down among an array of Christmas biscuits and apple tarts and peppermint fudge.
John was reading news about a local charity leader embezzling money when Greg’s mobile rang.  Greg, moving quickly to slide an omelet out of the pan and onto a plate before the call went to voicemail, wiped his hands on a tea towel before answering.
“You were worried about me,” he said, looking unreservedly content to have found empirical proof that Sherlock cared about him.
Sherlock squirmed, and Mycroft knew they had reached the end of the boy’s patience, could sense there were too many thoughts raging in Sherlock’s mind.  They would have to continue the potty training discussion at another time.  At the moment, it was time to put a stop to the negative thoughts crowding Sherlock’s psyche, time to allow Sherlock to escape into a clearer, simpler headspace brought about by discipline and vulnerability.
Thanks for all of your lovely feedback on the last chapter, loves!  You're all the best for sticking with me and providing interesting insights into the plot lines I'm working with.  We're back to a bit of ageplay in this chapter, and more is to come as we navigate the implications of Mycroft's choices and the haunting of Sherlock's past.
“Thanks, ‘Lockie,” Bunny said after a moment, draping an arm over Greg’s shoulder and letting the alligator hang from his hand so Sherlock could reach up for him.  Sherlock took his alligator back and pressed it beneath his neck, next to Dmitri.  He was too comfortable and sleepy against Mycroft’s chest to speak.
Sherlock had said, during their weekend at the lake house, that John had latent father issues.  John had denied it at the time, rolling his eyes and making teasing quips; but, as usual, Sherlock had been able to deduce John’s state of mind even before he himself had come to terms with his inner demons.
Sherlock remained as still as ever, but his eyes shifted up to meet John’s gaze.
“It was a tough day, huh bud?” Mycroft asked when he had sat at a chair in the kitchen and pulled John away from his shoulder so he could look him in the face.
John scrubbed a hand over his face and squirmed in his chair.  If Sherlock was averse to receiving affection, John was averse to making others go out of their way for him.  Lestrade clearly had better things to do.
But he was feeling young and alone in the room, and, now that he was awake, he wasn't sure he'd be able to get back to sleep.  The shadows in the room were angled and sharp like the slashing claws of monsters, and Sherlock suddenly just wanted Mycroft.  Mycroft would help if he asked him, but Sherlock was angry with him; Mycroft had chosen to put John to bed instead of him.  He hadn't forgiven Mycroft.  Besides, he was a bigger boy than the babyish and needy Bunny; he didn't need anyone's help.
“It’s okay, kid,” Greg said with compassion in his voice, reaching over to unbuckle the boy.  “You’re doing a good job holding it.  Let’s just get you inside so we don't have any accidents.”
“I’ve got you, string bean,” Mycroft said, quiet and comforting.  He rubbed his hand up and down Sherlock’s back as the boy sniffled.  “You’re okay.”
“I wanted to spare you from this, Sherlock,” Mycroft said with a sigh.
“I, ah...just...just calling to check in.  See that you’re alright,” he said when the beep for voicemail sounded earlier than expected.  “Hope you’re...well.  Call me if you need anything, okay, Harry?  I’m here.  Happy Christmas.”
“No.  I wanna wear jammies,” he said, voice firm.
“Does it cause you or others harm?” he asked.
Not only had he been woken up far too early by a screaming Sherlock who was sore about being made to eat breakfast, but to make matters worse, he had realized as he turned to pull a pillow over his head in order to drown out Sherlock’s screeching that the sheets and his pajama bottoms were cold and sopping wet.  He must have wet his pull-up more than once since Papa had gotten him to sleep after his middle-of-the-night nightmare.  The pull-up had leaked badly, and he was uncomfortable, embarrassed, and in need of a change of clothes.  He hadn’t felt big or brave enough to traipse out into the kitchen to admit what he’d done, so Bunny huddled beneath his sheets, sucking his thumb and wishing the day would start all over again.
“I want to apologize for the way I behaved earlier today, John,” he said, “I knew you were not fully young, and I took advantage because I sensed you must be attempting to align yourself with Sherlock.  It was childish of me to act out by attempting to make you feel lesser.”
Sherlock whined a bit as Mycroft took a crayon from his hand, but he allowed the man to scrub first one hand and then the other with the towel before turning to his rather sticky mouth.  He hadn’t realized he’d gotten just as much food on him as in him.  Then again, there was a reason Mycroft generally didn’t let him complete other tasks during snack time.
John could sense that Greg was worried about his state of mind.  The Detective Inspector's concerned gaze, searching and a bit skeptical, followed him as they entered the office of the motel that had become a location of interest in the case.  And when they realized upon entering the specified motel room that they’d stumbled upon yet another gruesome crime scene, Greg’s furrowed eyebrows only set deeper.
Wet pants meant a pull-up for the rest of the day.  That was the rule.  But for John in that moment, it was too much to think about slipping into another pull-up.  He hadn’t wet himself without realizing it since he was an actual child, and although his returning adult mind knew there were a multitude of other factors at play, he felt that wearing the pull-up had somehow regressed him to a point where he’d lost track of his body’s needs.
“Not stubborn,” he said, pouting.  “And not a monkey.”
There was a moment when the men stood blinking at each other, but then Sherlock swore, glared at Greg with an impassioned hatred, and swung the door shut, leaving Greg once again alone in the hallway.  Greg was glad Sherlock had not attempted to get past him.  They both knew who would have won the confrontation, and Greg knew he may have been forced to cause Sherlock discomfort had he been forced to restrain him.  Sherlock had apparently decided he would rather hold his ground than lose it attempting to escape.
Mycroft chuckled.  “John, the reason Sherlock has so many rules in place is because he is desperate for attention but doesn’t feel comfortable asking for it.  He knows very well he is not allowed to suck his thumb and he knows that I know he knows.  So Sherlock choosing to suck his thumb--even though the action has never brought him much pleasure throughout his life--is a way for him to gain my attention, a way for him to once again feel a small reminder that he’s under my care, and these things keep him little.  God knows I would prefer he seek positive attention instead of negative, but you’ve seen how uncomfortable he gets when I try to express affection towards him.  Only the most experienced therapist in the world would be able to convince him he deserves positive attention and can ask for it when he feels unloved or unsure of himself.  Until then, it’s clear he needs outlets through which to gain attention in his own way.”
But, at the moment, Mycroft would do anything to keep a smile on his kid’s face.
As dusk settled and the novelty of the games wore off, the darkness in his mind began to make itself known once more.  He was cranky at the dinner table, where he cried because Bunny got the purple fork and Sherlock wanted purple too, not the orange one, and he kicked while Uncle Greg tried to clean his face of spaghetti sauce.  But, through it all, he could sense the darkness had begun to recede, could feel his mind clearer of the type of overwhelming sadness than it had been that morning.  There was no telling how long the dark days would last--at times, they stayed for weeks--but Sherlock may have just gotten lucky this time, and may be feeling better by morning.
“You know, I might just be inclined to drop some hints in Mycroft’s presence about the state of your scraped palms,” Sherlock said, gesturing with his chin towards John’s hands.  “Those wounds are pretty consistent with catching yourself after a fall to the pavement, aren’t they, Dr. Watson?”
“Idiotic woman,” Sherlock muttered to himself, his phone's touchscreen keyboard clicking.  “Clearly the butcher’s son doesn’t have the resources or wherewithal to be carrying on an operation of that sort!”
Sherlock’s depression often made him lethargic, and sometimes that led to Sherlock spending entire days in a darkened room.  Mycroft did not always find that bed was the best place for Sherlock on his toughest days, as it did not provide any distraction from his hopeless and often destructive thoughts, but he knew that, in his current state, Sherlock could definitely use some time to catch up on sleep.  He'd let his brother sleep for a bit while John and Greg were out of the house, and then wake him before lunch.
Bunny was supposed to be helping take care of Sherlock while he felt younger than usual, but he couldn't focus his attention onto his brother without wondering if it was his fault Sherlock had woken up sadder and younger than usual, if he'd brought about his bad day.
“Daddy, I gotta tell you something, first,” Bunny said, pulling himself away from Mycroft and glancing down towards the blankets, which he twisted in his hands.  “When I was in bed crying, I... after Uncle Greg and I got back from the store...I, um, I was crying really hard and I hadda accident.”
Lots of angsty Sherlock and both mentions and depictions of self-harm in this chapter.  Read with care if that is triggering for you.
He took small bites of his breakfast because he knew Mycroft was watching.  He wasn’t hungry, but it was rare that Mycroft let them watch telly this early in the day, and Sherlock didn’t want to press his luck.  He ate with his fingers so he didn’t have to take his eyes from the screen.  He knew there were small bits of scrambled egg and fruit on his hands and probably on his t-shirt, but he didn’t care enough to brush them away.  He felt younger than he had last night, half-conscious of the way he might look to Bunny and Uncle Greg but too exhausted and apathetic to care too much about what anyone thought.
Sherlock winked and retreated to turn on the shower as John carried the bedding out of the room towards the laundry.
Mycroft paused in his task to glance up at Sherlock.
It was Sherlock who answered:  “Willa!” he called, and Bunny, smiling proudly, nodded.
Greg sat in the desk chair of Bunny’s bedroom, struggling to find the words to begin the conversation he knew needed to be had with the wide-eyed kid perched on the edge of the bed.  Despite his earlier protests against a younger headspace, John had aged down fully after the emotional ordeals of the morning.  He was nervously chewing on a thumbnail as he clutched his plush rabbit and baby blanket to his chest.  His face was lined from sleep, and he was still rubbing at tired eyes after being woken prematurely from his nap.  He looked the picture of young innocence and trust.
Mycroft glanced up from the computer screen and stopped typing, watching as Greg leaned against the doorframe with his eyebrows raised, expectantly.
Sherlock whined, glancing down towards the red splotches on his skin and realizing that the pain he’d assumed would go away when he was stripped of the wet pull-up was still raw and painful.
The boys scrambled out of their outermost layers, leaving trousers and sweaters behind in their haste to dress in their newly chosen attire.  Bunny remembered too late that he was wearing a pull-up, and caught Sherock looking as he stood in nothing more than a t-shirt and the embarrassing training pants.
John shrugged but nodded.  Mycroft stood from the bed and began to leave the room.  John felt a rush of panic, a need to do anything to keep his Daddy from turning out the lights and leaving.
“Ow,” Sherlock said when Mycroft looked closely at the deepest of the cuts despite the fact that he had not touched them.  “Don’t do that.”
“Well, why don’t you hop on up here and let Ariel help you open up your surprise before dinner, okay?”
Thanks for your support and wonderful comments on the last few chapters! I can't believe this story has almost reached over 50,000 words!  You've all been such great supporters of my writing and this series, and I am very grateful.
“Sherlock will call me ‘baby’,” John nearly whined.
Sherlock groaned, then yanked the blankets up over his head.
John ducked his head and mumbled.
“How about this, kiddo?” Greg asked, holding up the sleep shirt in a size he knew would fit John.
“Perfectly,” Sherlock said, smirking up at John for a moment before dropping the grin, putting on the act of nonchalance.
Wishing you all well--sending bunny kisses!
He turned, leaving John in Greg’s care abruptly.
Greg’s brother and his wife had split six months previous; Greg knew the man was consciously attempting to keep Greg from making the same mistakes he had.  He would not be pleased were Greg keeping something from Mycroft, something with the potential to drive a wedge between them.
John was not entirely following, and Sherlock sighed.
“That’s right, baby,” Mycroft said, nodding.  He reached out and held Bunny’s wrist gently, stopping him from fiddling with the toys.  “But you’re not that mean girl, are you?”
“What a polite boy,” Mycroft praised, and John smiled.
“He’s in no state to be traipsing around crime scenes,” Mycroft said.  “And neither are you, for that matter.  You’ve been dealing with overly emotional children since we picked them up yesterday.”
Mycroft realized he had not had a moment to touch base with Greg regarding the events of that morning.  He was glad to be able to process a bit with him now.  “John admitted this morning that he’s been interested in wearing Sherlock’s pull-ups again.  But I don't think he had prepared himself for the fact that he might actually wet one, and that upset him.  It seemed to be a genuine accident, at least partly.”
Mycroft’s voice was firm, but kind, and Sherlock found himself shifting from leaning against the arm of the couch to leaning against Mycroft, his head suddenly in his brother’s lap.
All in all, the boys had only been alone for an hour and a half.  Mycroft had sent Greg to the bottom of the stairs to listen in and make sure all seemed well on two separate occasions, and he had checked in with Sherlock when the boy had bounded down the stairs looking for paper and markers for his treasure map.  Every indication was that the boys were having fun playing dress up.  Greg and Mycroft had been relieved that the drama of the morning had been solved, even a bit pleased with themselves for the roles they had played in its resolution.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock would never go as far as to mention their ageplay through text, knowing how easily he could be hacked or monitored, but ‘bunny’--the nickname Sherlock had taken to using when John was young, had become a bit of a codeword among them.  Was Sherlock saying Lestrade was in their flat? For John?  A text ping came through.
“Fuck, I can’t…,” John breathed, twisting his legs around the hand in his crotch and nearly thrashing in bed as he regained control of himself.  “Sherlock, I’m going to wet myself...oh god...the mattress.”
It was Bunny’s reaction that would be the worst.  Bunny would blink up at him with confusion and betrayal if he were to learn that he couldn’t actually share his potty training success with his big brother.   If he told, Bunny would see him for what he really was: not a role model, but a pitiful baby.
There was a moment where John, recognizing Mycroft’s presence, nearly leaped at the taller man.  But Mycroft could see John stop himself.  He had woken up big, then, despite his current state of dress, and his excitement at seeing Mycroft had simply been a momentary flash of little John coming through before John checked himself.  Mycroft was pleased to see John again after a trying afternoon and night the previous day, and was pleased to see the man looked far less haggard and frazzled, less down-trodden than he had when Mycroft had seen him last.  He stood up from the kitchen table and opened his arms as he stepped closer to the man.  John hesitated only for a moment, then seemed to realize that he didn’t need to be little to hug a friend, and buried his face into Mycroft’s chest.
“Oh, buddy,” Mycroft said, taking a seat once more on the couch and pulling the teary-eyed kiddo into his lap.  “It’s okay.”
Find me on tumblr,
He had to get away from Mycroft and Papa’s disappointed looks and Bunny’s whimpering and sniffling before he slipped down to an age where he was too young to have power over anything at all.  He ran from the living room as his own tears began, taking the stairs two at a time in his haste to escape the others.  He retreated into his room, pulling the door shut and throwing himself onto his bed, face pressed into his arms as he cried.
Thanks so much for your kind comments and feedback--I'll respond to them asap!
“You are not to move from that spot,” Mycroft said, his sneering contempt a stabilizing force.  “You are to stand there and think about your behavior.”
It had been the worst day ever.  He didn’t feel well and Daddy loved Sherlock more than he loved him.  Daddy wasn’t fair and he couldn’t talk to him right now.  He wanted his Papa.
“No punishments,” John said immediately.  “Just, um, comfort.  And maybe a warm bath.  Reassurance, like you gave today.  Telling me I’m still..." John blushed.  "Still a big boy, that it was just an accident.  Greg was good at that as well, but it was coming home to you and having you there to help make it better that helped the most.  Just attention, and it’d be okay if you reminded me to use the toilet throughout the rest of the day.”
“No spanking today, kiddo,” he said, resolving to stand up to Mycroft were he to question his final decision.  John had trusted Greg with a bit more vulnerability, and he was not about to ruin that by scaring the kid out of being honest in the future.  “But that doesn’t mean you’re not being punished.”
“Okay, Papa,” she said.
“At least,” John said, nodding.
He was too drunk to care who he hit with his brandished fists, and soon found strong arms wrapped around his chest as he was dragged from the pub and thrown out onto the street.  He was suddenly on all fours on the sidewalk, stumbling to his feet and struggling to gain his balance.
Sherlock regretted asking for the band aids.  Mycroft was too close, and the kitchen was too quiet.  He tried to pull his hand away, not wanting to give Mycroft the chance to initiate a conversation, but Mycroft reached out to hold his wrist firmly, placing the band aid adhesive-side up on the table before beginning to peel off the last of the non-cartoon bandaids.
“Okay, hon,” Mycroft said, closing the storybook--The Velveteen Rabbit--and standing from where he had been sitting on the edge of John’s bed,  “Time for lights out.”
John smiled sideways.  Leave it to Sherlock to give himself an excuse to act up.  It was no surprise that Sherlock had found a way to use this to his own advantage.
“We were playing!” Sherlock said, voice whiny as he tried to escape punishment.  “I didn’t know he had to go bad.”
But Greg should have known John Watson was too much of an overthinker--even in headspace--not to have picked up on the potential danger to Sherlock which had emerged since John had gone down for a nap as Bunny.  The suggestion had been too drastic, and of course John had realized that something was wrong.  It was not unlike when Sherlock had become distraught at the lake house, after learning that Bunny had begun calling Mycroft 'Daddy.'  The man had made great progress in terms of ageplay, but he was not about to allow himself the comfort if it had the potential to harm Sherlock.
“Daddy’s mean!” Bunny said by way of not-so-detailed explanation.
“Take your thumb out of your mouth,” Greg ordered, his voice harsher than usual.
“Doing alright?” Greg asked again, glancing up at Mycroft with concern.
He’d been trying to steel his displeasure about the pink pull-ups and the nightgown as much as possible, not wanting to put a damper on the happiness Bunny had shown.  Then again, he should have known the kid would be attuned to his true feelings, that he was rarely able to hide anything from Bunny.  John was extremely sensitive, despite what he showed in his adult headspace; he understood human emotion perhaps better than anyone Mycroft had come across, and so it was no surprise that Bunny had seen through Mycroft’s attempts at nonchalant acceptance.
“So it’s not the items he’s concerned about,” he proposed.  “It’s specifically a female figure.  And he’s...what? Worried it will unsettle you in some way?”
Bunny glanced up at him and could not help but smile.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft warned, knowing his brother could not possibly be telling the truth.  They had been driving for nearly three hours, and Sherlock had liquids with breakfast.
His brother sighed and kicked out from under the blankets.  It was rare that he allowed Mycroft to change his pull-up, so Mycroft moved quickly, stripping his brother of his pajama pants and then retrieving a clean pull-up.
Bunny could hardly focus on his chicken nuggets.  He pulled the waistband of his sweatpants away from his body to check on his pretty, pink pull-up for the sixth or seventh time since his lunch had been placed in front of him, and he could not help but smile.  Sherlock was too little at the moment to pay him much mind, so he was not worried about being teased.   He just wanted to look at it forever.
“I’m not so sure about that, kiddo,” he said, reaching to tossle Sherlock’s hair.  “But, judging by a certain squirmy little boy, I’d say someone could use the potty right about now.”
Papa and Daddy had argued after Papa bought Bunny her first nightshirt and her pink and purple pull-ups.  Did Daddy not like the unicorn headband? Had Daddy not been honest when he told Bunny she could be a girl when she wanted to be?
“Rental car, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, eyebrows raised and voice sing-song.  “It's the best option.”
“Well,” Sherlock said with an over-exaggerated lifting of his eyebrows before jumping from the chair and stepping into the living room.  “Mystery solved.”
John could see Sherlock was getting restless after he’d completed his fourth puzzle in half as many hours.  He’d been reading in his chair, glancing up to pass along some words of encouragement to his slightly regressing boyfriend from time to time, but a mind such as Sherlock’s needed new and varied stimulation; jigsaw puzzles could only occupy him for so long.
“You’re mean!” Bunny said, but he pushed the remote from the couch onto the floor and curled in on himself.
If you haven't read Part 2 of Pushing Boundaries, it's up over on
His mother and father had, in a fit of desperation, placed the task of potty training onto Mycroft’s shoulders, having not made any progress themselves.  Mycroft was self-assured and pragmatic, and they were hopeful that Sherlock, in awe of his older brother, may respond more positively to him than he had to them.
“Speaking of which,” Greg said as he pulled the last item from Sherlock’s overnight bag: a plastic mattress cover.
“Alright, Bun,” he said.  “I’ll trust you to make the decision this time.”
“I have to go,” John said after they’d been kissing for quite some time, Sherlock teasing John’s by running his free hand over his distended bladder.  “Oh, fuck, I have to go.”
“Wanna color?” he asked.
Bunny nodded, distractedly, and held out his arms.  Greg lifted the boy from the car and hugged him close, knowing he needed a bit of comfort to calm the nerve he was now feeling.
“Let’s get you both changed,” he said, dropping the suits and beach towels onto the couch as Sherlock began pulling clothes from his body frantically.
Greg closed the back door, then circled around to the driver’s seat.  Greg had been hoping he’d get a chance in the loo as well, his own need pressing, but he didn’t feel comfortable leaving Bunny alone at the moment, and it was clear the kid had some aversion to the rest stop bathroom.  He’d be fine until they made it the last twenty-five minutes home to Mycroft’s.
Greg sighed; Sherlock knew he was not allowed his cell phone while in headspace, which either meant he’d be earning himself a time-out for breaking the rules, or that something had happened to shift him out of headspace.
Greg knew what Mycroft would say: such flagrant disobedience deserved a spanking, no matter the consequences.  But the kid looked so afraid, and Greg was starting to realize that there was even more to John’s sordid childhood past than he or Mycroft had first suspected.  There was no doubt both boys were working to heal their abandoned inner children when they regressed in age, but Greg was starting to realize just how many scars John carried.
Mycroft grunted to acknowledge Greg but did not sit down, continuing to traipse back and forth from one side of the bedroom to the other.
“Would you stop asking questions and just get over here, already?” he asked, sharp and biting.  “He’s clearly in a state.”
Greg scoffed but returned the smile, wrapping his hand around the warmth of his mug.  It was a gloomy day, and rain had begun falling when he’d left Baker Street with the boys zipped into their jackets.  Sherlock had refused to stand under the umbrella as they walked to the car.
Sending Bunny kisses, as always! xoxo
Mycroft quirked an eyebrow, then, plush rabbit and colorful nightgown in hand, he set out to cheer up his little bunny princess.
Greg first lifted John off of the couch, transporting him to the kitchen presumably to keep him from dripping on a carpet, then handed John the phone.  When Mycroft answered and John heard the man’s voice, John made a keening sound in the back of his throat; he wished Mycroft was there with him.  He needed him.
“What will I think, love?”
“Sherlock?” Greg asked, attempting to keep the worry from his voice.
“I didn’t like it,” Bunny said, clearly distraught.  “Made me feel too big.”
He was conscious of the items he’d earlier re-packed into John’s suitcase, the plush rabbit and pacifier and remaining pull-up, and took the opportunity while the man was inside to take John’s suitcase from the boot of the car and place it in the backseat, where it was more easily accessible.  He knew the man would settle quickly if he would just accept his comfort items, that they could help him stop obsessing over the shame and doubt of the past 24 hours and allow him the escape he so desperately needed.
“What was that, Bunny?” Daddy asked, glancing up from where he had been wiping tears from Sherlock’s face as the baby finished the bottle.
“Papa?” he asked.
Sherlock was surprised to find that he was about to cry.  Mycroft's mentioned relationship with John brought to mind scenarios Sherlock had been unable to keep from shifting through his mind: images of John in Mycroft's arms late at night, of John holding Mycroft's hand, of his brother tucking John into bed.  Mycroft had always been his, and now Sherlock wasn't enough for him.  Twisting his neck to press his face into the crook of his elbow resting on the table, he hid the burgeoning tears from Mycroft and attempted to fight against the feelings of inadequacy.  If he couldn’t physically remove himself from the situation, at least he could close himself off from it so Mycroft wouldn't see his vulnerability.  Tears wouldn’t help his plan to annoy and fluster Mycroft, to prove himself stronger than his need for his brother.
He wanted to be anywhere other than his parents’ house in the country on Christmas Eve.  He wanted to be anywhere he didn’t have to feign interest and affection and adulthood.
Now, he hefted a still-sleeping Bunny--cuddling his baby blanket--into his arms and carried him back down the hallway to the master bedroom.  Sherlock trailed close, holding onto the hem of Greg’s now untucked button-down as well as Bunny’s old lion plush, which Greg hoped would be an adequate substitute for Sherlock’s own plush toys for the moment.
John was glad when Greg wrapped his new baby blanket around John’s shoulders and then picked him up without asking if it was okay.  He needed to be held right now.  He needed the comfort.  And Greg was good at hugs and at lifting John up.  Maybe even a little better than Mycroft, because he was stronger.  That made John cry harder because he felt guilty for thinking that Greg was better at holding him than Mycroft.
“I...I liked it,” John said.
John put away his mobile and began shrugging on his coat.  His train was pulling into the commuter station closest to Harry’s, and he was more than ready to be on solid ground once more.
John’s wiggling got more frantic as time went on, and with one big clap of thunder, he yelped and began peeing his pants.
John, towel clutched around his shoulders, stayed close to Mycroft.
"He, uh.  Sherlock?  Are you..."
“I know, I know,” Greg said, releasing John and taking a deep breath.  “Okay, let’s get out of here and get you tucked away with Willa and your pajamas and a warm bed.”
“I know, kiddo,” Greg said, putting aside the washcloth and lifting Sherlock from the bathtub.
There was no taking back what he had said, though, and as much as he would have liked to stay in the bedroom to care for Sherlock, he knew the man would not have allowed his presence.  Sherlock had been aging up, that much Greg could see, and he would want to be alone.
“John,” he said, voice betraying the worry he felt.
“I gather there will be some conversations in need of having once we return to London.  I just hope both of them are ready to have them.”
“I didn’t mean to!” he said, snivelling, the moment Mycroft opened the door.
Bunny felt unsure of herself and nervous, but she nodded slowly.
“I have to call him something.  John’s his big name.”
Mycroft placed John next to Sherlock.
Greg had entered the living room not far behind Mycroft, and he stepped beside him at that moment, taking Bunny from his arms and shushing the boy in order to give Mycroft freedom to handle Sherlock.  Mycroft turned his head expectantly towards his brother, who was still perched on the couch.  He stared until Sherlock, grumbling that it wasn’t fair and that he always got in trouble and that they liked Bunny more than him, stomped to the corner of the room for timeout.
It was clear the man had decided to settle firmly into his earlier snarkiness, but Bunny began to shift in his place on the sink, and because Mycroft needed to get the boy cleaned up and out of his wet clothing and because Sherlock tended to be even less rational in his teenaged-self than his adult, he chose not to address the sass.
Sherlock’s first impulse upon rushing from the living room was to leave the lake house entirely. But he knew he was already in deep trouble, and worrying Mycroft and Papa Greg would do nothing to help his case.  And so it was he found himself huddled in the deepest depths of the closet in Bunny’s bedroom upstairs, pressed as close against the wall as he could be.  He figured they would look in his bedroom first, so choosing Bunny’s room as a hideout would hopefully buy him a few more minutes without punishment.
“Listen, champ.  I know you’d prefer Mycroft.  That’s understandable.  I’m not going to try to be Mycroft because I can’t do that.  But what I can do is be Uncle Greg.  And I can tell you I’d very much like to be Uncle Greg for you right now.”
“Sherlock, I think it’s best if--”
John sighed.  Sherlock's drug use would not take away all of the pain from stitches, but he could see there was no way he was getting Sherlock to a hospital in his present state.  He got what he needed from the triage medical kit he kept in his bedroom, sterilizing the needle three times.
John reached for Greg’s cell phone with the hand not wet with urine and pressed the phone up against his ear.
They only made it to the top of the stairs before Uncle Greg refused to go any farther for safety’s sake as well as the sake of his lower back, but the boys had had their fun, and they both hurried down the stairs and skipped into the kitchen to find Mycroft and tell him Uncle Greg was the strongest man alive.
“Here’s the plan, hun.  Uncle Greg said you already had a bath tonight, so he’s going to help you clean up with some wipes and get you into some new pajamas.  I think your Uncle Greg's right that it would be best for you to wear a pull-up tonight just in case.”
Sherlock wiped his nose on the back of his wrist and sat up taller in Mycroft’s arms.  The street was quiet, lamps lit to cast a hazy glow on the pavement below.
“That’s very nice of you, kid,” Uncle Greg said, “But let’s get some pants on that bum of yours.  It’s time for bed.”
“Brother!” Sherlock called from the bedroom after the most recent sounds of thunder.
“Just a suggestion, little brother mine,” Mycroft drawled.
Greg felt a pit in the base of his stomach knowing he had exposed his kid to death and murder on a day he hadn’t been prepared for it.  He should have paid more attention, should have realized earlier that John had been closer to toddler-mindset than adult, no matter what the man professed.  Both Sherlock and John were constantly attempting to prove themselves big; it was Greg’s job to see them for what they really were at any given moment, and, in this case, he had failed.
Sherlock shook his head, looking close to tears once more.
Since having heard Mycroft’s revelations about Sherlock’s wettings, John had become more attuned to his boyfriend’s needs, had even attempted to talk with Sherlock about waiting too long.  But Sherlock was always guarded, closed off, and this time was no different.  He had refused to acknowledge the accident when he returned to the kitchen in a new change of trousers to finish his experiment, refused to acknowledge that John had cleaned the urine from the chair and floor.
