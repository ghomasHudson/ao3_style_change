So, regardless of the warm tinglies and butterflies and giggles that Dean inspired in him, it was probably for the better if he avoided Dean Winchester. In fact, he resolved right then and there that he would not let this go any further.
Sam gripped his shoulder, tried to keep him present in the conversation. “I shuffled some things around, moved him to the night crew downstairs. He’ll have different meal times, different sleep times.”
“No,” Luci admitted. “We were supposed to leave the bodies for the FBI to clean up, but the jacket had ripped, and I saw the thing on the floor, and I figured...maybe it would be useful. A little collateral, you know?”
It was heaven, the way his alpha tugged him close, close enough that Dean could feel Cas’s hammering heart. That meant the alpha could probably feel Dean’s heart too, the way it fluttered and skipped around in his chest, so happy to have Castiel this near.
Dean waited for the palace guard to open his door before stepping from the sedan they’d ridden in from the airport. He fiddled with the buttons on his blazer as Sam stepped around beside him.
“Call me Bobby, Son.” Bobby looked over, studied his face for a moment, then spoke somberly. “You know, we’ll need to fill his position. And from what I’ve heard, you’re the best we’ve got in the field right now. That’s a lot of first-hand experience to bring to the position, plus you’ve just pulled one of the most thoroughly investigated and planned busts in history.”
“I asked Garth to look up the Omega gene,” he said. “He says it was from a temple dig in Sumeria, the
The man stared at him for a long, silent moment before looking back to Ana. No words were spoken, but they were obviously having some kind of conversation.
At the end of the day, when Sam offered to drive her home, she went to find the others to say goodbye. She found them on the couch in the den, with Cas curled tight into Dean’s side as Dean ran soft fingers slowly down his back. Both were practically asleep, so she only whispered a
Castiel tapped Dean’s arm to get his attention. He pointed towards the DJ booth and leaned up to yell in Dean’s ear, “That’s Gabriel up there.”
When he finally dared to glance back up, he found Anna studying him, her eyes narrowed. Oh no, had she seen? She had to know, right? Cas tried for a weak smile before he returned his eyes to his plate, desperate to escape the other omega’s scrutiny.
Dean remained keenly aware of Cas throughout the conversation, so physically close yet emotionally distant. The man was obviously not happy with Dean being here. Still, he maintained his professionalism as he explained the real distribution process, which was vastly different from what Crowley had told them.
. He’d drive to the mall with them from time to time or even sit in on a movie night, sure, but otherwise he let them do their “gross couply thing” (as he put it).
Cas laughed bitterly. “Then what do you call today? Because if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you used me to get into that jail, because apparently that’s where you wanted to be.”
Crowley smirked. “Oh trust me, I’ve heard all about the Winchester special from Lilith and Ruby and...Meg, I wanna say?” Cas could feel his good mood faltering even as Crowley continued. “I mean, I was a little surprised when I realized it was you under there with him, since I never thought he ran our way.”
Castiel shot her a glare. Dean just reached beneath the table to lay his hand over Castiel's, pulling Castiel's gaze back to his. He winked, and Castiel's expression relaxed.
Is that really what Dean had taken from his comment? That Castiel wouldn’t want him? No, that couldn't be further from the truth. He’d even thought that he’d made it clear, but all he’d done was hurt his omega more.
I avoided his gaze and stared at the TV. Did I wanna tell him? What if it ended up not working out...
After several long minutes of petting, Cas pushed the cat from his lap and stood with a stretch. It trotted out the parlor door, toward the staircase that would take them up to his bedroom, as it had so many other nights.
I spent the first half of Charlie’s party stalking around, hoping to find Cas in the crowd. Then Charlie dragged me into the kitchen to meet some dudes from her LARP group, who also did some side stuff as ghost hunters or some shit. I stood there smiling and laughing, pretending I was listening when I was really watching the doorway, hoping I’d catch sight of him.
, this thing with Dean was not happening. Castiel had other goals, other duties. He couldn’t give into this, not now, not when he’d done so well, not when he only had to make it a few more days.
Cas thought back on all those evenings with the cat, its annoyed glares and puffed fur. Now that he knew it had been a sentient being that entire time, he could easily identify the traits Dean spoke of.
Victor broke into his panicked thoughts. “Well, it all worked out for the best, even with my keeping tabs on you. I think even you can appreciate that I couldn’t afford for you to mess up another one.”
“You’re going to be a great parent,” she blurted out, then seemed embarrassed by her own assumption.
Castiel shook his head sadly. “I just don’t want to lose him, not when it’s just starting.” He smiled at them. “I feel like I finally have something that’s just for me, and I don’t want to give that up.”
An odd glint flickered through Cas’s gaze, and Dean was hit with the uncomfortable knowledge that, given Cas’s skill set, Dean may very well have met him and just not realized it.
Dean almost looked like he might push the subject, but Castiel’s pained posture must have convinced him otherwise. Instead he stretched out in the booth, looking for all the world like some James Dean pulled straight out of a black-and-white: confident, assured, owning the space around him as much as any one person could.
“I’m coming,” Dean groaned, and then his hips shoved up one final time and he was spilling inside Cas. His hips moved once more, twice, three times as he rode out his orgasm. And then his hands fell back to the carpet as Cas pulled off of him and toppled on the floor next to him.
Dean shook his head. “You shouldn't have to. You're an amazing guy; you should be able to be yourself without any sneaking around.”
She was out for her usual evening run when she spotted the Impala parked on a narrow, practically deserted side-street. She knew it was Dean’s because he was the only one in town to own that car. She thought she might go up and say hi, but then she saw Dean in the backseat, obviously
Uriel arched a brow. “Oh, no. Please don’t misunderstand, Dean. I wasn’t disparaging your work ethic or abilities; I was talking about your predisposition towards men.”
"Thank you, Anna," Castiel spoke up. Her eyes shot to meet his, and Castiel could see the surprise there.
As Dean’s eyes fluttered shut, he heard the door shut behind Sam. And then, lying there in the darkness of the room, everything seemed to fade away. All that remained were the touch of Ana’s cool fingertips against his temples and the soft lilt of her voice tripping along her words.
“How long are you gonna keep sitting beside him and smiling as he gives credit for your work to some out-of-touch idiot?”
Castiel turned to the children on the opposite side of the circle. “I think it’s your turn to start the snack line. Why don’t you go get lined up so Rachel can give you snacks?”
Dean sat in the arboretum, giant stacks of aged parchment spread out over the table in front of him. To the left, the old trade contracts; to the right, maps with different borders in chronological order. In front of him, certificates of import/export payments. Other stacks littered the table, like birth certificates for a certain village, tax receipts for a neighboring county.
By last hour, they were walking together to literature, muttering and complaining about Brady’s smarmy answers in anatomy.
Castiel smirked at his discomfort, but shook his head. "Nah. Gordon was going to try something, but I made 'im go away."
Ellen sighed heavily as she stood from her chair. She slowly gathered her papers back together, neatly shuffling them into order before she stood and headed for the door.
Dean found himself studying Castiel closely, searching for any sign of pain, any dips in his expression. As if he sensed his thoughts, Castiel’s eyes flew to his, stared straight into his soul. He smiled slightly, shaking his head, then looked back to Meg.
his chest. He looked up to find the cat sitting there, its tail flicking with impatience. He blinked, confusion slowly spreading with wakefulness. The cat never came until evening, but here it was.
“You have to promise me something...” Michael whispered, his breath hot against Castiel’s neck in the darkness.
"Please," he whimpered, curling in on himself. Gordon laughed and grabbed his hair, dragging him out of the stall. He threw him in the floor and kicked him in the stomach.
He knew it was getting food, since it slipped away every day for a bit, but it’d always be quickly back to pace and cry. Cas found he’d even gotten used to the noise by the fourth day.
Dean arched a skeptical brow. "And how am I supposed to help you? It's not like I can just...tutor you away from thinking you're...you know..." He trailed off uncertainly.
Now, there was no Hannah to distract him. Hours passed, and still he sketched. It wasn’t until the bushes across the clearing began to rustle that Castiel remembered that there
Castiel did not seem surprised, and in fact yelled over him. “Your host will be held to answer for what he’s brought into this world, you parasite.”
Dean’s head dropped as his mind replayed the frantic words that had pulled him from the nightmare. The final word cut him to his core.
Cas nodded mutely, and then Dean was gathering the omega close, close, closer, hugging him tightly. “God, it’s been torture for months...” he pressed the words into Castiel’s neck.
“Initial contact successful,” Dean reported coolly, a smirk settling on his handsome mouth. “Next contact already scheduled.”
Once Cas ensured that they’d all brushed their teeth and washed their faces, he allowed them to say goodnight to the children who were there with their own families before herding them back out into the hallway.
Castiel turned back to his friend before he did something rash, like pull Dean into a hungry kiss in the middle of his gallery. “Anna, this is Dean.”
"You guys are gross already," Charlie informed them. "I don't think I'll be about to keep lunch down around you."
“But you’re an agent!” Cas argued, panic staining his voice. “And you can’t...I mean, you have responsib--and I don’t even think--”
He sat in the middle of an open plain that stretched out in all directions. A strong breeze created waves in the dark green grass, blowing toward him, carrying the scents and sounds of life from a small village at the edge of the field. Beyond the village, tall snow-capped mountains rose up into the sky, disappearing behind the clouds.
Dean tried to smile, tried to pass off his usual cavalier attitude, but he suddenly found he couldn’t. “I don’t… I can’t… He’ll kill me; he’ll kill us all.”
“All throughout history, civilizations have borrowed and adapted parts of the tale. Egypt had Osiris, but Mesopotamia had Tammuz. While Greece had Dionysus, the Church had Jesus. Hainuwele of Indonesia was Pangu of China was Purusha of India and now...” Cas trailed off.
The omega discreetly tugged out his phone to scroll through a local gossip site that followed the royal family. Right at the top, the most recent post: Castiel, standing outside another private box somewhere along the track. He smirked at the camera while a pretty brunette clung to his side. The headline read “Prince Castiel and Former Flame Reconciling?!”
It came to be widely known that, while the Kingdom of Ingles was formidable with its alliances, its true power lay in the hands of an omega. If you wanted in with the king, you had to go through his son-in-law. Not that Dean bragged about it; he was perfectly content letting Charles or Michael take credit. As long as he had Castiel there with him, his alpha who loved him and kept him sane, he was perfectly happy to go home at the end of the day, cuddle into Castiel’s side, and live their “boring” life.
Dean shut the screen off with a twitch of his finger and shoved the device in his back pocket as he spun to face her. That was enough social media for right now.
After, with the sweat cooling on our skin, I grinned at him. “So, I feel like we can splurge on some breakfast, right?”
His gaze returned to the busy night. “When the high gods created the first human beings, they let the humans access their magic, to help them grow and thrive. But there were some of the lower gods who were...unhappy, jealous. They broke away, dedicated themselves to the sole purpose of stealing the magic away, by whatever means necessary.”
Dean smiled. "I can see it now; veteran reporter Castiel Novak and his bestselling novels based on his real-life adventures." Castiel blushed, and Dean's smile grew. "I'll be the fan that shows up to all of your book signings and cries tears of joy when I get the restraining order, because I actually got your autograph."
The door swung open, allowing the scents from the outside world to flood in. He groaned when he caught that wonderful scent, the only one he wanted now, but then froze. That scent shouldn’t be here. It was far away. Dean had run and left it behind.
When he finally reached the edge of his panties, he snapped the waistband against his flushed skin. He hooked a pinky under the waistband and began to tug the fabric back and forth, moaning softly at the friction the action provided.
He reached down for another bite of cake, determined to finish the slice, despite the fact he’d had trouble finishing his regular meals lately.
He grinned down at his phone. This guy hadn't been lying when he said he jumped at opportunities. And yes, now Castiel had a very vivid mental image of New Guy jumping him as soon as he opened the front door, and dragging him up to his room, and pinning him down to the bed, and smashing those perfect pink lips against his, and...
They all stared at him, and he couldn't blame them. He would be expecting more of a reaction if he were in their shoes.
As Dean stepped to Cas’s side in his own classic black tux, he ducked to press a quick kiss to Castiel’s cheek. “Wow, everything looks great, Babe,” he praised, surveying the elegant crowd that mingled and chatted, drifting from room to room, piece to piece.
“Supreme,” a voice called. Cas turned his head to look at the council members shuffling nervously behind him. “We must apologize.”
Naomi nodded absently as she worked. "Nothing too bad. I’ll be back around 9." She patted the top of Castiel's head as she passed his chair. She rushed from the house, Bible and cookies in hand. The door slammed behind her, leaving nothing but the stillness. Dean reached for Castiel's hand, and Castiel accepted it willingly.
Just then, a loud cry of greeting erupted by the door, and both omegas turned to find a tall, dark-haired alpha in a sharp suit strutting in. Dean immediately recognized the man from pictures alone, and he could not stifle the gasp that had everyone turning his way.
Dean flashed him a smile. “I heard. Congratulations.” He looked back down at the photos in his hand.
Castiel’s eyes widened at the photo, and he could practically feel his pupils dilate as he stared at it. The picture was...holy shit, it was fantastic.
Dean just smirked at the accusation. Didn’t deny it. He knew he couldn’t lie to Bobby; they’d been friends for too long.
The girl seemed to accept his answer, nodded, and followed the others as they filed past Dean’s closed bedroom door toward the bathroom.
"Dean," Castiel whispered, voice hoarse from sobbing. More tears slipped down his cheeks when he thought of the other boy.
“I don’t think it’s fair that my parents are forcing Anael to marry your brother just because she is an omega princess,” Castiel blurted out.
“Eh,“ Dean shrugged, but kept his lips against Cas’s. "I swear, I could’ve sold that thing in a day back in the States. ‘62 Thunderbird, thing of beauty! And I get all the way out there, and they just want to see fuckin’ pictures.”
How could they, when life, and consequently their scents, kept constantly changing. Dean’s eventual pregnancies made him smell sweeter. Castiel’s rare wounds made both mates smell guilty—Castiel for worrying his mate, Dean for not preventing the battle. Even then, they’d curl together, comforting each other, loving each other, clinging to each other until the pain had passed.
He grimaced. “I hadn’t once touched you beyond a handshake, while he was groping freely. Even then, something inside of me knew that you didn’t belong with him because you were supposed to be with me. I could feel it, like a puzzle, the way we’d fit together.”
“Brady thinks I don’t talk because he’s an oblivious asshole who only pays attention to whoever’s wearing the shortest skirt that week,” Cas supplied. “And no, nothing against girls wearing miniskirts, they can wear whatever the hell they want, but Brady’s a thirsty bitch.”
Castiel didn't let him finish as he slammed their mouths together, showing his enthusiastic, wholehearted support of the decision. When they pulled apart, he shook his head in disbelief.
Dean’s smirk faded into a grimace. If Victor was so confident in his abilities, why was he forcing him to check in every damn step of the way, like some rookie? Just because one mission hadn’t gone exactly to plan, now he was being “monitored,” kept tabs on.
“Dean!” Cas chided as the taller boy tugged him in for a kiss. Cas allowed it for a few moments, but eventually pulled back just enough to remind, “Dean, we’re going to lose them!”
“Of course!” Dean murmured, smiling warmly. “I would've asked you sooner, but I didn't know if you'd want that because of...you know…”
It sounded so stupid when he said it, but Castiel had to admit that he liked the idea. Spending time with Dean both in bed and out of it, plus he didn't have to end his activities with Crowley or anyone else. It was a winning situation all around.
“So I take it you’re not as interested in my work,” he said to the alpha. He turned back to Dean. “Would you like to continue this conversation down by the car? I’d love to show you the upgrades we’ve made.”
But it was one of the smaller memories that rose to the surface now, a tiny little memory that should’ve been lost, for all intents and purposes. But now it pushed its way to the forefront, demanding acknowledgement.
There were other bills, like electric and water and groceries. Plus Sammy grew so damn fast, he was constantly inhaling more food, and I just knew my hand-me-downs wouldn’t fit his giant ass for much longer.
He let out a hoarse chuckle and jerked his chin to where Cas and Jacob had disappeared. “No, it’s done. He’s gotten over me, just like Gabe wanted.”
He stood and walked down the aisle where Dean had disappeared, and after a bit of wandering, found him. The omega was sitting on the floor beneath an open window, where a soft breeze fluttered in with sounds from the dark world outside. Neat stacks of books and papers situated all around Dean were very obviously placed in some kind of order that only Dean could see. Castiel watched from the shadows as he flipped through one tome then another, picked up one sheet, only to move it to another pile.
Dean could only gape, his mind struggling to catch up with what had just happened. Had he just...had he just been
Cas was giving him a second chance at a normal life, a way to live without all the fear and death. Dean could finally have his chance, like that djinn had shown him once upon a time. He might even be reunited with his mom and dad…
Castiel jumped up, ready to bolt, but then the handsome man was smiling at him, and crying out, “Lord Dupuis!”
Castiel nodded, but his own mind was starting to swirl. How did Dean keep track of it all enough to connect a couple shipping containers in their airport to the local election for a tiny district in his own country?
“Then it’s settled, you’re coming home with me.” Castiel dipped to run his nose up Dean’s throat, smiling at the goosebumps it raised along the omega’s skin. “I know Father and Michael will be thrilled to have someone with your expertise filling a seat among their advisors.”
Castiel shook his head. "Only your first day of school, and you're already hanging out in the sex stall? That's impressive."
When the princess—no longer just Hannah, but more widely known as Her Royal Highness—finally passed through on her first royal tour of the kingdom, she and her entourage stopped off at the old Dupuis Estate, of course. She later commented on how intuitive the cat seemed—but she never mentioned how it refused to leave Cas’s side for a moment, how it growled in warning every time she tried to touch him. For the entire awkward visit, the cat watched her with its golden eyes, its expression far too knowing for comfort.
“Well, that part doesn’t matter so much.” She grimaced. “Before she’s named, the Supreme must descend into hell and then return to her body.”
It wasn’t fair that Michael was bleeding out on the floor of a dark closet in an abandoned house, wasn’t fair that Raphael had been damn near gutted by a horde of mindless monsters just last week. Wasn’t fair that, as far as Castiel knew, all of his friends and family were dead, as good as devoured by that same bloodthirsty mob.
“Awesome!” she answered. “We talked about LGBTQ characters hidden throughout literature.” She chuckled. “A lot of very strong opinions, especially from Michael. Can you guess which side he took?”
“Testify against the others in the Bulgary case,” Harvelle prompted. “I know Detective Novak here would be so grateful if you could tie up some loose ends for him on that.” Harvelle nodded toward him. “Might even help get him out of some pretty hot water.”
“You can be my guardian angel any day,” Dean flirted, and Castiel smirked and called out the awful line for what it was.
“As in, there’s another side that lets out onto a mass grave? A bunch of dead bodies ripe for infecting?”
“Awesome!” The alpha declared. His eyes seemed tight around the edges. “Better than we hoped. Listen,” here he faltered with a bit of uncertainty, but Castiel smiled encouragingly and nodded for him to continue. Dean cleared his throat. “I noticed, the last time I stopped by the playroom, that you’re having a little more trouble getting up and down from the floor. So, uh...” he ran a hand over the back of his neck, “well, we found this really nice rocking chair.“
Castiel remained at the window, staring. Dean looked out to see what held his attention, but Castiel’s gaze seemed locked on the black of the night sky above the city.
Meg and Benny were chosen to go undercover, since they both had experience with flying under the radar. Dean, on the other hand, was about as subtle as a bald eagle draped in a flag, screeching through the air as fireworks exploded around it. And yet, at the last moment, he convinced the team to send him with Benny instead, because “What purpose would a beta even need the machine for? Two alphas is more believable.”
Castiel rolled his eyes dramatically, the winced at the pain the action provoked. "Why the hell would she be jealous of me?"
“Promise,” I whispered then bent to seal it with a soft kiss. He didn’t hesitate, just grabbed me as tight as he could and turned it into a hungry, desperate thing that took as much as it gave.
“Guys! I think the next question is over this way!” Sam called excitedly, tugging his friend Jess around the next corner in the maze.
Castiel frowned petulantly. Stupid Ketch with his fancy suits and fast cars. He won a single race back during his first year of Secondary, and that suddenly shot him to superstardom? Although, Castiel could admit that it wasn’t just that Ketch had won that race. It was that he’d beaten a senior. And not just any senior. He’d defeated the school’s reigning champ of three years running—one Prince Castiel.
“Don’t mention it. Now go on or you’ll be late. I’m sure you don’t want to explain the smells of sex and smoke to mommy dearest.”
Between work, his family, and Dean, Castiel’s schedule was fairly full. But, even busy as he was, he knew better than to ignore the invitation when it came.
Cas unlocked the door and let himself into his apartment. Sighing in relief, he shut the door behind him and kicked off his shoes. No matter how comfortable the shoes were, his feet always ached by the end of the day. When they’d still been together, Dean would usually give him a foot massage when he got home. Now…now, no one waited for him.
Mom died in a fire when he was a baby, so Dad turned to the bottle, and we were left to fend for ourselves. And by fend for ourselves, I mean leave me to raise Sammy and take care of the bills. Luckily the house had been in our family for years, but that only meant I didn’t have to worry about paying a mortgage.
"I know," Castiel assured him. "I just wanted to say it before my mouth became otherwise occupied. Because I highly doubt I'll remember to say it later."
“I’m doing this because you’re my omega. I need you, Castiel…” he drew a deep breath before admitting, “I want you.”
“Yeah, a while.” Castiel looked down at the grass, as if trying to hide his gaze from Dean, but the alpha could hear the pain in those words. That was nothing, though, to what the omega whispered next. “I thought you were still in love with her, the woman in the picture.”
“Yes, sir!” Benny nodded towards Dean. “My frien’ here is quite taken with her.” He shook his head. “He’s jes’ too shy to say.”
I laughed as he launched himself at me and wrapped him up in a tight hug. He leaned his weight into me, and warmth rushed through my chest at how clingy he was being.
And that was the simple truth of it. Amara was cruel, even to her lovers—as Cas had first-hand knowledge. He couldn’t allow Dean to be pulled in by her beautiful smile and charming words, because once those were gone...Dean’s life would be nothing but pain and misery, a farce.
When they separated, Dean brought a gentle hand up to trace over Cas’s cupid’s bow, his temples, his forehead that creased low over his brow. “
“So, I’d love to do this again,” his voice was low, so low that Castiel would have missed it, had it not been just the two of them in the silence of an abandoned parking lot.
Cas sat behind his shaky metal desk, scribbling out some notes from his recent interview with a burglary victim. An explosion of sound erupted from his desk drawer, and Cas actually flinched.
"Well, hello to you, too," The other boy replied. "Neither am I, for your information. I was asked to call and check on you. Charlie said you were acting strange after lunch and that you weren't answering her texts. Are you alright?"
Once they were back in the east drawing room, it jumped onto his lap as usual, but this time it began to rub its spine against his shirt. Cas ran a hand over its fur, along its back, under its chin. His fingers brushed the cool metal of the key, and he gasped, tugging his hand back quickly. The cat lifted its chin, the key glinting in the fire’s light, and pressed forward as if to bring it right to his fingers again.
Hester humphed again. “I’m sure I can determine that for myself.” She stood, clutching her purse tightly in front of her. “Bring him on Saturday.”
Cas’s hands stopped twisting, the blue glow fading slowly until Crowley was left a whimpering heap on the floor. He knelt down, cupped the side of the alpha’s head and leaned in close to his ear. Dean could barely hear his words.
“Babe,” Dean soothed as he guided Cas inside, “I think they’re all still shocked that you gave me another chance.”
Dean shifted back, just enough to study Cas’s face, but still remained in his lap. “This wouldn’t have anything to do with what you heard from Ruby and Crowley, would it?”
Dean uncurled himself, glancing around, then his breath caught. Cas was there, rising high in the air, blocking Dean and the rest of the team from the crackling clouds.
Dean spun to smile at his brother. “This is what I do, it’s what I’m good at. So can you just trust me? Just once, let me use my stupid, overactive brain to help you, okay?”
Dean’s brow furrowed. Cas knew Crowley? Crowley was a low-level drug pusher who’d never merited much observation by the agency, but if he was dealing with the likes of Lucifer, maybe he wasn’t so low-level after all... Dean’s attention was pulled back to the conversation when Gabe spoke.
As Dean fought side by side with him, watched his blue magic dart and weave through the air, he found that they actually worked together very well. Somehow his blade and Castiel’s power seemed perfectly blended, the ancient magics communicating across ages and civilizations of the past.
Dean seemed surprise by his reaction but nodded. “Uh, yeah. Jo’s scrubbing it down right now, but I can bring it up to the play room later?”
And so far, they'd each held up their ends of the bargain. Dean hadn't broken Castiel’s heart, and Crowley had taken care of Gordon.
All too soon, Castiel had finished his sketch and began to pack up his bag. He had so many things he wanted to say to the other man, so many questions that demanded answers for no other reason than his own curiosity’s sake.
He took a step closer. He couldn’t seem to help the way his eyes fell to Castiel’s mouth then traced a gentle line down to that curve of his neck. It was so distracting, demanding his focus.
“So you’re headed out again?” Castiel asked, his hand smoothing back and forth over his tummy. He didn’t let himself think about the fact that it was a soothing gesture, didn’t want to think about what that meant, that he only really did it when Dean was going out on supply runs and scouting trips.
The first time Cas saw Jess after that Halloween party, he tugged her into a tight hug and thanked her for helping him and Dean.
Ana turned to the council. “I know I should not ask this...I would not, if there were any other way…”
Castiel watched as the last of the children wandered away hand-in-hand with her mother, enthusiastically relating the games she’d played and the stories she’d heard.
His face grew serious, but even then I could see the contentment in his eyes. “Before you, I was so angry,” he whispered. “about moving here, about Chuck, about my mom...I just felt invisible.” His smile came back. “And then one time, before we were even dating, you told me I exist.”
Dean sighed. “Yeah, but having aged advisors with years of experience in the field looks better for my Dad, especially when he needs the appearance of wisdom and experience on his side.”
But still, at least he'd feel less guilty about the whole thing. And even if Dean never texted him back or tried to talk to him ever again, he'd have a (somewhat) clear conscience.
As if she could read his mind, Donna waved a hand. “I’ll just sit outside your stall if you need me.” She followed Castiel into the room, still chatting on, but left him to step into a curtained stall alone.
As they glided past the already seated diners, Hester would incline her head this way and that, deigning to greet some, purposefully ignoring others, but she never actually stopped. Castiel, close behind her, slowed for the occasional firm clap to a broad shoulder or gentle squeeze to a soft hand; just enough to acknowledge, never enough to engage. It was the dance he’d been taught since childhood, the ritual he’d honor until his last breath.
Gordon crouched down and grabbed Castiel by the hair, yanking his head back so that the blue-eyed boy was forced to stare at him.
Dean just glared at her. She sighed heavily. "Dean, I don't see why you're acting all snippy. I heard who you were talking to. Trust me, Castiel gets it. He pulls this shit often enough himself."
Castiel nodded and closed the door between them. He dressed and stepped outside, rolling his eyes at Charlie's applause and whistles.
I knew Dad wouldn’t be joining me, since I’d heard from Rufus that he was in lockup again. I almost asked Cas, but I decided I’d let him figure out what he wanted to do. There
Cas immediately tucked his face into Dean’s neck, as if to hide away. Dean’s arms slipped around him, his hands finally sliding up the bare skin of his back. His nose went into Cas’s hair, sniffing at the intoxicating scent that reminded him of a town he’d never been to, a forest he’d never forget.
She learned quickly how little regard Cas’s parents held for him, and it broke her heart. No wonder he’d always looked so miserable before. She saw for herself the times that Cas was overwhelmed, angry, heartbroken. But Dean...Dean seemed to heal that for him. More than once she watched as Dean led him from the house to take him for an ice cream or a walk, and by the time she next saw Cas, he was more content, more loved, than ever before.
Dean stood frozen as he remembered what Cas had yelled as he’d flown up to meet Kazimir and Kseniya: they’d attacked the mate of the supreme.
“And now that I’m back...” Kazimir yelled, “stronger than ever...it’s time for some good old-fashioned revenge.”
“I know!” Cas cried. “I know this is uncomfortable for you, and I’m trying so hard. I wouldn’t have even come tonight if I’d known…”
"I got up here as soon as I could," Dean promised, stepping up to the counter. Castiel uncrossed his legs and spread them wide, allowing space for Dean to step between them. Dean pressed right up against him, his hands landing on the counter behind Castiel, forcing the boy the arch backward as he leaned in for a kiss.
do monogamy. Hell, the fact that he was even contemplating it showed that something was screwy with his head.
Hannah was there on the other side of them, her own eyes misty. Dean watched as Cas lifted a hand to cup her cheek. “You did so well.”
Dean sat at the reserved booth in the back corner of the restaurant, isolated from any curious ears that might try to eavesdrop. He glanced down at his watch, then checked the text message that Cas had sent him earlier in the day.
He looked over his shoulder once, twice, but saw no one there. With an uneasy hum, he hurried the children along.
“You doin’ okay, brother?” Benny asked. He’d been there every step of the way in that journey, he’d seen Dean fall in love, then chop that love off at the root for the sake of his career. He’d never said anything about it, never judged, which Dean appreciated.
“For this,” his father said, and then they were hugging, crying, touching for the first time in years.
Dean had no idea what Castiel had been doing in the past ten years, but a small part of him hoped that the man had been able to just live a peaceful life. As soon as that thought appeared, another rose in its place. Part of him selfishly hoped not, because if Castiel had managed to escape this life, now Dean was coming to pull him back in.
“You seem to really like him,” she murmured, almost awed. She never, in a million years, would’ve pictured Dean in a steady relationship with anyone, much less a guy. But there was no denying his lovestruck look as he began gushing about how amazing Cas was, how funny, how smart.
“We saw her going into your room earlier,” Micah hastened to share the important news. “And Cas said she probably had to ask you a question.”
There’d always been a chance that he’d be found out…but he hadn’t anticipated being caught so soon. Now he was going to… Well, at the very least he’d get fired. He’d probably face some criminal charges of his own for forging government documents.
“When is your next...contact?” Dean didn’t miss the extra beat there, and he smiled. Victor may not have exactly agreed with his methods, but he needed them.
Sam was too busy staring down at his textbook, but Jess was watching Dean. He had this little smile on his face, something she didn’t quite know how to interpret. If she had to guess...she’d say it looked a lot like the smile Sam wore when he was around her. But that couldn’t be right, because Dean was exclusively into girls. She’d never
Dean sighed heavily as he brought a nearly empty beer bottle up to his perfectly shaped lips. “There’s so much that makes sense now.”
The orb began to rise slowly toward the opening. Cas stepped forward, breaking free of Dean’s hold to keep his focus on the beam from beneath and guide it through. Dean almost expected the portal to snap shut once the orb had passed into the world above. Instead it remained open, allowing Cas to maintain his connection with his chanting.
Cas’s heart swelled at the sight of Dean, wonderful and handsome and unattainable as ever, being so kind and genuine with the children.
Castiel's grin broadened, his teeth sinking down into his lower lip as he nibbled at it. The number wasn't saved to his contacts, and the area code wasn't local… meaning that whoever the number belonged to, that person had only just recently moved to the area.
When he was finished with his shower, he texted Charlie and asked her to come over after school. He wanted to tell her everything and get her help with his plans.
No sooner had they stepped inside, Gabe was running off to find Charlie, the host, and Cas was left alone. He wandered through to the kitchen, hoping to nab a soda, but stopped short. Dean was there, his arm flung around some girl in that Princess Leia bikini costume, laughing and smiling so openly at the others with them.
"Hi, Gilda!" Charlie squeaked as she hastily stood up, almost knocking her chair over in the process.
Dean smirked but didn’t deny it. Instead, he pulled Castiel right back in, wrapping his arm around him again. “When’s your lunch break?”
Gordon chuckled, shaking his head as he stepped further into the room and kicked the door shut behind him. “No, I think we’ll stay right here.”
With a hum, Ruby nodded. She slumped into her usual seat, near the back but not in the very very back, and Cas took his seat next to her.
Dean’s gaze snapped back to Cas, the omega’s face as blank as ever even as that awful memory echoed in his mind.
He looked down to find a tiny little guy, maybe a year old, crawling toward him, drawn to that sweet, pregnant scent that put children at ease. With a smile, Castiel bent down and scooped up the pup. The small guy fit perfectly against his hip, a comforting weight he was used to.
Castiel took the lady’s outstretched hand in a firm shake, “It’s such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Worthington!”
He finally looked away then, pretended to watch the crowds. But his peripheral was still arrested on Dean as he sat there, breathless, waiting.
Nope, Dean Winchester did not do relationships. I had a good thing going with dealing: getting paid and getting laid from both teams.
So apparently that side of him wasn’t just for Cas. And apparently, the ending of Cas's whole thing with Dean wasn’t what
Cas glanced over to the annex parking lot beside the library, usually abandoned at this time of day...or any time of day, actually. But today, there were two cars there. There was the silver BMW that Cas immediately recognized. It was that asshole Brady’s ride.
He thought of what that would mean. He would be reunited with Lisa. He could try to save Sam, even keep Lucifer and Michael from rising again. The possibilities raced through his mind, suddenly so tangible...so achievable.
“Next we add the lime juice,” he murmured, handing me the lime. Suddenly he looked up from his phone, “We’re doing Christmas here, right?”
Yes, Dean would still help his own father from time to time when the need arose, but John fast discovered that what he deemed to be a “need” and what Castiel deemed to be a “need” were vastly different. After a long surprise lunch with his son-in-law, he was much more careful and respectful towards Dean.
Dean placed one hand on Castiel's hip while he used the other to guide his cock to Castiel's slick hole. "I'm gonna stuff that pretty little hole of yours right up, Sweetheart."
The three men stepped back into the wide front hall with its mosaic floor, curving stair, and tall windows that looked out on the immaculate front lawn. These stood open, allowing a breeze to flutter through...billowing the long white curtains, rustling the flowers on the hall table.
St. Bart’s popped into my head, but that was more because Brady had been bitching about it the last time we met up. But it did sound nice, from what I’d heard. So I kidnapped Cas again.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel whispered as he tried to ignore the stares. But even trying his best, he couldn’t quite escape the dark gaze of the alpha sitting at a table in the back corner. Castiel shuddered, obviously uneasy, and the nameless alpha smirked triumphantly.
What he really wanted was to wait and see how New Boy responded, how much farther he'd take this. Castiel remembered the text from moments before, the demanding "Show me." He hadn't asked or pleaded; he'd known what he wanted and he'd demanded it. Even this last text "look what you did to me"; on the surface, it looked cute and flirty, but underneath...oh, underneath hid worlds of possibilities.
Castiel smiled sadly at her then looked back to Lucifer. “Give the drive to Dean, tell him to pass on the message that your debt is settled. Maybe don’t take any more jobs from this FBI contact, while you’re at it.” He stood, grabbed his tux. “In six weeks, I’ll go to Crowley and you’ll get whatever you want from him, along with your credibility restored.”
Just before he slipped out, he glanced over his shoulder, only to catch Dean staring at his ass in his jeans. Now it was Cas's turn to smirk. “And that's why these jeans are so worth it.”
Castiel sighed. “But we just don’t have the space. Perhaps if we moved the —“ he was interrupted by someone clearing their throat lightly. They turned in unison, matching smiles plastered on their faces, to the pair standing behind them.
Dean frowned. “What was it to them? That true mates stuff ends up being complete bullshit most of the time.”
But that night, he knew it was time. He was ready for it, ready to give the handsome, generous man anything and everything.
It’s not as though they spent every evening together, but they were together more often than not. And, per both their preferences, they tended to spend more time away from Cas’s family than with. There was still the occasional family dinner or fundraiser where Castiel would be forced to attend, and Dean would accompany him, of course. But overall, he found his family much more bearable with Dean in the balance.
Castiel studied the women’s expressions, as if that might offer some clue even as his mind flitted back to his conversation with Dean that morning. The omega had said nothing about any emergency, but then Castiel remembered the way Dean had sat deathly still, barely moving to pass documents across the table. And there’d been the flush rising from beneath his collar, spreading up his neck.
Cas shook his head to clear the unexpected memory. He needed to stop this. Dean was a criminal—a criminal who’d evaded justice before, probably more than once. Cas needed to keep his head on straight and do his job, which at the moment included getting Dean Winchester behind bars.
For Valentine’s, Dean kidnapped Cas right after school on Friday. He’d apparently worked out some excuse for Crowley and Balth to tell Cas’s parents, should they ever actually remember that Naomi still had a son in the home.
That next morning, Castiel walked into school with his head held high. He felt a twinge of anxiety as different people did double-takes, but he mentally recited Charlie's words of wisdom with each step.
Castiel laughed. He stumbled and sat down heavily on the pavement, his back resting against the car door. "While you were trying to figure it out, whatever the hell
“To you, he’s gonna be mean as shit,” Ash promised. He punched Brady in the bicep then climbed back into his car and drove away.
Cas chuckled. “Don’t thank me yet.” He rested his chin on Dean’s head. “After I told them about what you did during the ball, they were ready to put you to work right then and there, but I made them promise to wait until after we’d mated.”
Without another moment’s hesitation, Castiel grabbed Dean by the hand and began tugging him toward the stairs.
Two days later, Anna released Castiel from the infirmary under the watchful eye of a good-natured beta named Donna. She immediately whisked him off, promising to get Castiel “squeaky clean.”
I meant it to be teasing, but suddenly it wasn’t. This look came into his eyes, and I’ll always remember it, cause it made me feel invincible, like I could do everything and anything he needed.
More time passed, more worrying, more wondering if Catiel was alive. Dean tried not to let it distract him too much. He even went on a few dates here and there, met some nice people. Unfortunately, none of them were Cas, so nothing came of them.
Dean looked as if he might reply, no doubt with something that wouldn't be anywhere near appropriate in front of their families, but Mary cut him off.
“No light, no heat. Just four stone walls gouged with scratch marks left by desperate men driven crazy by the isolation,” Harvelle described.
Cas stared at him, the words running on a loop through his mind, until his heart could finally accept, even if his mind could not yet totally understand. “You really are...you’re a shapeshifter.”
"Hello, Dean," Castiel replied shyly as Dean bent to press a soft kiss to Castiel's cheek. He gestured toward the Charlie. "This is Charlie. Charlie, this is Dean."
“Do you want to return to your home and pursue a traditional courtship?” Castiel’s smile was teasing, because he knew the answer even before Dean shook his head in annoyance.
So, on the morning of graduation, when Sam picked her up to drive to the ceremony, she looked at him imploringly.
The rooms were still fully furnished with priceless antiques, the open chests filled with gold and heirlooms, the jewelry boxes overflowing with diamonds and a multiplicity of other gems.
Dean leaned into the touch, a slow smile starting as he nuzzled into Cas’s palm. “And now I’ve finally caught you.”
Cas slipped his hand into the front of Dean’s pants, giving a squeeze to the bulge he found there as he whispered, “I think that gives us plenty of time, don’t you?”
Dean stood, allowed the brief wave of dizziness to wash over him, then walked to Cas’s room. He knocked on the door, but no answer came.
Dean’s face blanched, his mouth dropping open. The only reason he wasn’t caught by Crowley was because the man was looking up at Cas, lustful pride set in his features. Castiel’s eyes met Dean’s for only the briefest of moments, and then he was looking back to Crowley, his gaze worshipful.
He brushed his lips against Castiel’s one last time, then stepped away so Castiel could unlock his car and slide inside. He started the car, then rolled down the window so he could wave to Dean one last time.
“Of course,” Castiel agreed easily as he stood as well. “I’ll be sure to extend your invitation.” He walked back around the desk and held out his hand toward the office door, “Shall I see you out?”
“Initial contact successful. Next contact already scheduled,” Dean couldn’t help his smirk. If Henriksen’s silence was anything to go by, the supervising agent hadn’t expected to hear back from him so soon.
“Because,” Meg called as she sailed into the room, “I made it for you, and you want to be nice to people who make things for you.”
The figure painted there was dark, menacing. He stood far above the tiny worshippers below, lording his power over them.
me, and I can’t think of a single thing that could make me happier than having the man I love see me.”
Castiel remembered that moment, when Dean had paused to look at something in the distance. He wasn’t even sure what he’d believed Dean to be looking at, but now that he knew, he realized that he would have underestimated the omega.
It had been a long four days since Cas had disappeared, leaving no trace for Dean or the team to follow. He’d even called Henriksen, begged for his help.
Jess laughed and slapped his hand away. She looked back to Sam and found him smiling widely, despite his misty eyes. She knew how big this was for him, for Dean to trust Sam with his own future so Dean could start looking out for his future with Cas.
And dammit, I was a goner. Cas had me right from the start as I drove him home, loving the blush that would creep up his neck even as he threw out another sarcastic jab.
The clothes stayed on, of course. No matter how handsome and funny and captivating Dean was, Cas wouldn’t want to go too far, not when they’d just barely met. But it was like Dean could sense this. He didn’t push, didn’t move any further than desperate kisses that invaded Cas’s hungry mouth and emptied his overactive mind.
Kazimir’s corpse turned back to Cas. “Do you still think you can defeat me? You see what I am capable of, the power I hold.” He sailed closer to Castiel, and Dean’s breath caught in his throat when the demon quirked his head again. “It is the magic borne of true pain.”
He could feel Castiel’s family watching them, reactions ranging from angry and appalled to shocked and delighted, but he didn’t care. And from the enthusiastic response he received, he would bet that Cas didn’t care much either.
“Just a little longer, Winchester. You’re almost done,” he reminded himself softly. For some reason, the reminder didn’t help him feel any better.
“See you soon,” Castiel responded, watched as Dean walked back the way he’d come. He ignored the little flip his heart gave at the realization that Dean had thought about him, had brought him back a rocking chair, of all things.
He still couldn’t forget the way Cas’s eyes had glowed with so much power, his body practically thrumming with it. His thoughts skipped back further to the first visit, to the worshipful way Cas had gazed at Crowley while descending those stairs, but when he’d sat with Dean, he’d tucked his face away in his neck and kept his eyes hidden from Dean.
“I’m sure everything’s going well,” Anna assured Castiel as she patted his hand under the table. Hester had lumbered off to the bathroom, leaving Castiel, Anna, and Meg waiting for her.
Dean stared at that hand before looking back up at the alpha, studying Castiel’s eyes. Just this once, he wanted to let go. No overanalyzing, no running all the variables. He just wanted this one dance, probably the only dance he’d ever get with his alpha.
That one had been a little trickier to hide from Cas’s parents, but Crowley was more than willing to help cover things up…especially since Cas had agreed to cover for him too. If rumors ever leaked out that Crowley and Lillith were still fucking on the DL (with Brady footing the bills now) Castiel would provide the alibi. He really had no problem with it, cause Brady had been on his shit list ever since that whole 3-a.m.-phone-call debacle.
“My love,” He claimed Dean’s mouth in a fierce kiss, as if to drive all doubts from his mate’s mind. He pulled away just enough to whisper, “The fact that you’re an omega only matters insomuch that it’s a wonderful part of who you are. You’re just as equal as me, my brothers, or my father.”
Crowley lifted a hand to take Castiel’s and spoke in Russian. Cas blushed and dropped his gaze as  Crowley pulled his hand to his mouth for a kiss. Dean thought of the blush that had crept up Cas’s neck, stained his cheeks during that last conversation at the London HQ. He hated that Cas was blushing for this monster who so easily touched him when Dean had kept a careful distance, reined himself in so tightly.
“And who’s your handsome friend?” another girl asked, stepping up to Dean’s other side. Like none of them could see the way he and Cas were holding hands?
Cas didn’t even feel angry, like he had before meeting Dean. He didn’t feel unworthy just cause his mom wanted to forget about her previous disaster of marriage. No, now he had Dean. Dean had shown him the truth in so many ways: he was absolutely worth every bit of love poured into him.
Castiel finally did what he’d been wanting, aching, to do. He turned in towards Dean, smiling up at him softly.
A giggle escaped Anael, followed by a chortle from Michael. Soon, all three of the siblings were laughing hysterically.
It was, for those couple days, just us. The rest of the world didn’t seem to exist anymore. It was me and Cas, completely caught up together, and that was fucking perfect.
Dean’s gaze darkened, his hopeful smile slipping. “I know. And I feel terrible about that.” For the first time he looked away, licked his lips, but then his gaze returned to Cas’s, sure and steady.
to feel something for the woman. It had infuriated Amara to no end, until that day she’d walked in on Cas and Hannah. And now she understood Cas more perfectly than anyone else ever had or ever could, just as Cas understood her.
Castiel didn't walk Dean to the door. He heard the door slam, heard the car start down on the street, heard it speed away, but still he didn't move. He stared down at his stained sheets, his chest inexplicably aching at the meaning behind Dean's flippant parting words.
When they broke apart, Cas’s lips were swollen and red, as were Dean’s. Castiel huffed out a laugh as he bent up to whisper in Dean’s ear, “If I’d known it would get such a reaction, I would’ve brought you here weeks ago...”
"Dean, my name is written on a stall wall with the words 'Never says no.' I'd say that's pretty damning evidence to show that I really don't care where I get it from, as long as I get it."
She also felt Kazimir in there, his power dark and frantic as ever, but that was it. There was no one else in that orb.
They agreed to keep it under wraps for the time being; there was still the last quarter of the school year to get through, but that flew by, just like it always did.
Cas...the Cas who’d stayed up all night telling him about his shitty upbringing, the Cas who’d peppered kisses across the freckles on Dean’s nose and cheeks, the Cas who’d whispered confessions of love between soft gasps and pretty sighs.
When the elevator opened onto the forty-second floor, there was Henriksen, waiting to meet him. Apparently he didn’t trust Dean to find his own way to the conference room. Dean shoved down his irritation and offered Victor a smirk instead.
"You want more fries with that ketchup?" he asked as Dean kept squirting the red stuff onto his food.
“So, have I met her already, or…” Dean intentionally added the pronoun slip, since most people would immediately assume
"Yeah, dad's military, so we move quite a bit. But I think we're going to be here for a while," Dean smiled. "At least, I hope so."
“Let’s go, Gordon,” Castiel tried again, no longer able to hide the tears that thickened his voice. “Just you and me. I’ll go with you anywhere.”
I rolled my eyes again and held up a hand. “Sammy, I’ve known I liked guys for a couple years now, so no experimentation needed.”
“I—I just—I don’t know! This is the first time in so long when I don’t feel—I don’t feel empty.” She clutched onto Ana’s arm. “I know you are doing this, somehow. How? How do I control the emptiness?”
, before the heat started proper. He knew that if he was anywhere near Castiel when it fully hit, his omega would try to chase the alpha down. It would be a new level of pathetic for Dean, who’d been in some pretty low places before.
“But before the elections even happen, I’ll be able to approach Joshua, who hopefully now feels warm fuzzies for me because of my help to Marcus, and make him an offer with lower taxes and shipping prices on goods he wants to run through our harbor. That’ll encourage a major supplier to divert some of his cash flow into our economy, maybe even build a factory that brings jobs.
Castiel turned his blue eyes on him, his gaze assessing even as he floated Sam’s blade back to him. “You may call me Castiel.”
“I’m well aware of the situation,” Ana replied. She smiled sadly. “I am your omega’s supreme, after all.”
It would be so much easier if Hannah just told the truth, just gave him that one small kindness. But of course she hadn’t told the public everything, hadn’t shared how deeply Cas had loved her then… somehow still loved her just as deeply now.
Amara never did find M. Winchester to claim her prize. The story was that he had slipped away in the middle of the night, leaving everything behind...including his cat, which now lived at Lord Dupuis’s estate.
When they stepped into the dining hall, Castiel found that most people were already seated and eating. After scanning the room for a minute, he figured out the system and guided the children toward the food line.
Why was he speaking to Cas? He’d done the same before—several times before, actually—and it was still just as confusing.
. He was one of the best goddamned detectives on an international task force. He was better now; he’d made it through the pain, and he was a stronger person for it. He wasn’t going to give that up just because Dean popped back up and batted his pretty green eyes.
Castiel shook his head adamantly, groaning when the action made him dizzy. "Yes there is! Why else would everyone keep doing this to me?"
The pictures that Balth had tossed down onto his desk just that morning, the pictures burning a hole in his laptop case, proved it.
Dean, left with a permanent limp from the explosion, could no longer go out on missions and patrols, but he found he didn’t mind passing the responsibility off to the younger men. He was perfectly content to remain within the safety of the walls, his omega and their pup at his side.
“Yeah,” Dean answered, and his voice was steady enough to fool Sam, but Castiel knew better. Maybe because his biology was already so in sync with his mate’s, or maybe because Castiel knew instinctively that his own pain wouldn’t get any better if Dean left. If he had to guess, he’d say it was only going to get worse.
Cas’s face remained hidden as he nodded. “Just embarrassed…” he breathed so quietly that Dean could hardly hear him, so he knew the others definitely couldn’t.
“Shit,” he muttered. It was that weird Novak kid, the one who never talked or smiled or showed any hint of a personality.
“This is pointless!” Meg snarled as Garth wrapped the gash in her arm. “There will always be more dead people for him to bring to life!”
Before Dean could dissect Cas’s voice or the shadow that flitted through his eyes, a door opened down the hall. Immediately, the blue shimmer passed over Cas’s face again, and he wore the blonde mask with the glowing golden eyes. What Dean found the most disconcerting, though, was his expression. It had gone blank, but in a pleasantly absent way.
Dean’s eyes widened. “Pity?” He shook his head. “Oh no! I’m so sorry if you thought…” he smiled again. “Perhaps I should’ve explained: they’re a thank you, for feeding my cat.”
“Your cat is quite lovely, if just a bit overprotective,” she praised as Lord Dupuis saw her to the door.
Her eyes widened briefly, the first real show of emotion he’d seen. Her rage and malice were always manufactured, always designed for a specific result...but this shock, it was genuine. He took vicious pleasure in that.
Unseen by the workers who all faced the door, Gordon slipped from his hiding place behind the boiler and crept toward the basement stairs.
“This,” Anna spoke up with a pointed finger between the couple, “This is what I’m talking about, Gabe!”
“Somehow I feel like I do,” he admitted. Castiel seemed surprised, but Dean couldn’t fault him, not when he could hear the surprise in his own voice. “I mean, just watching you today, fighting with you…” His eyes bore into Castiel’s. “You were good.”
While he strode from the room, Castiel stepped over to a stool and sat, still keeping his eyes on the machine.
Dean was breathing deep and slow, trying to keep his temper under control. That bastard had no problem attacking a helpless omega? In Cas’s condition?
“I guess he tried to make a move on him after dinner the other night...luckily Kevin came along, stopped him from doing anything.”
"So," Crowley began, sliding across the back seat so he was behind Castiel and could see the side of Dean's face, "you're Cassie's new boyfriend."
“I’ve got you,” Dean whispered, his lips brushing Cas’s hairline even as his eyes remained locked with Benny’s, daring his judgment.
“I’m surprised Uriel agreed to sign the 1077. He seemed so adamant after last time,” Balth murmured. Cas merely shrugged, keeping his eyes on the monitor.
Cas looked back at them. “In the distant future, don’t worry. It’ll be the whole big ceremony with you two there, along with whoever else we want.”
“I understand,” Cas assured him, still not meeting his gaze. “I think that you and Anna will make a lovely couple.”
“But that is not a law,” Dean reminded him. “I checked, and the closest rule was something about breaking an engagement with a royal for another person of lesser rank. Anael doesn’t have to marry a royal at all, and if you stand with her on it, she’ll have the law of your land and her best advocate supporting her.”
Castiel could sense the tension between them, like he was some kind of shiny gold belt and they two heavyweights about to go head to head. It was as flattering as it was annoying.
He blushed and glanced down at the melting ice-cream that dripped down his hand. “Um, I’m not…” he trailed off, then looked back up at her.
Sam glanced down at his watch, at the message Meg had sent him minutes before. “Dean still doing good.”
“Thank you,” Dean murmured then gestured for Sammy to follow their guide. He stole a final glance back at the still-silent family and found them all glaring at the shortest of the brothers, Gabriel, who rolled his eyes and hurried in the direction that the alpha had gone.
“Dean,” the man interrupted, his voice suddenly hoarse with something Cas couldn’t identify. “My name is Dean.”
“I am so sorry,” Castiel mumbled as he began to gather up his supplies. “They’re just...they’re so beautiful, and I just wanted to—“
“Are we going to make any stops along the way?” He said it casually, but I could see the need in his eyes.
It was now almost ten after 7, and still no sign of Cas. The door swung open across the restaurant, and Dean’s gaze jerked up, like it had every time before. He froze when he saw Meg, not Cas, striding toward his table, a large purse slung over her shoulder.
“Whenever you say that, there’s always a reason.” Castiel rolled over to straddle his hips, forcing Crowley into eye contact with him. “What did you do?”
“We made it look like a botched job,” Luci confirmed, then leaned back and folded his hands behind his head. “So trust me, killing one agent ain’t gonna start any war. I’ll just make a little call to my friend, have him push it under the rug.”
Dean headed for homeroom, pulling his phone out to shoot a quick text to Cas. "We're still on for lunch, right?"
He poked his head into a few more doorways, sometimes smiling at the joy he found, other times frowning at the fear and pain. Some memories were clearer, sharper...others blurrier.
“Dean and I are together,” Castiel blurted. He fought the childish urge to throw his hands over his mouth. Those weren’t the words he’d wanted, but they would have to do. Crowley only blinked.
She rolled her eyes. “The usual, dumbass. Someone above you on the ladder’s been shelling out a lot of shady money to a lot of shady people for a lot of shady shit, and it’s all on there.”
“Hey Cas!” she greeted. Before she could even ask, Cas was throwing his arms around her in a tight squeeze, then stepped back quickly.
“I have to go,” he suddenly stuttered out, lurching back from Dean. Spinning away, he fled the hotel room with a slam of the door, leaving Dean to stare at the pictures still fanned out across the coffee table.
After glancing back over his shoulder to double check that the door to the other room was completely closed, Dean jerked his head backward.
"It's a huge deal! You could get a degree in auto mechanics or engineering! Then you'd get paid way more for doing something you love."
was too polite a word. Apparently, she'd gotten antsy and arrived a full hour and a half early. So she'd texted them in a panic and demanded that they get over there now, interrupting a perfectly good make out session in the back seat of the Impala.
Castiel smiled grimly, “Just because you can pretend that he doesn’t exist, that does not mean I have to.”
He looked to Castiel in a wrinkled tux and undone bow tie, unable to do more than nod and whisper, “Uncle.”
Dean settled into one of the plush leather chairs in front of the desk, nonchalantly crossing one leg over the other.
Dean smirked. “Well, if we’re going based off of technicalities, as long as I do my job right, your job isn’t
It seemed his heart certainly thought so, thrumming with the pain and humiliation that welled within him. His hands shook as his omega’s grief tried to burst free. He shut his eyes, allowing himself that single moment of agony, then pushed it away.
When Cas was close enough, I reached across and opened the passenger door for him. “Wanna ride home?”
“Deceptive?” Castiel scoffed. “This was nothing of the kind. I simply wanted to ensure he was worthy before burdening you.”
“Well, not totally,” Cas admitted as they pulled to a stop at a light. “I overheard him once making fun of me for something I’d said.”
Castiel shook his head. He licked at the drop of pre-come that beaded on the tip. Dean groaned, his head falling back against the sheets.
Dean took Cas’s face in his hands and wiped the tears away with his thumbs. “Of course I mean it,” he whispered, his expression earnest as he leaned back in. “I’ve never meant anything more in my entire life.”
“Right,” Cas’s voice was dry. “Sorry, I must have forgotten to stop by the corner store and pick up a $7 bottle of Barefoot.”
“So, uh...I’ll see you around?” he offered. Cas smiled, that blush returning despite what they’d just been doing.
The team ran out to the front to meet the threat, only to find a glowing pink cloud flying high above them.
Suddenly everything made so much sense. Castiel glanced down at his hands, trembling violently even as the pieces all slid together in his mind. “Your higher-up friend won’t cover it up for you.”
They were talking about something, with the guy waving his hands around and Cas nodding along, but then he glanced over in my direction. He paused, a tiny smile rising to his lips when I waved.
The demon spun to face him, ready to fight with its sharp grin stretching wider. “Oh young witch, her sacrifice matters not. You’re no match for me, not for the demons in your own mind.“
Dean stepped up to the wall to trail his fingers over the rough bricks. He’d thought that he would have to punch his way through or kick it in like he would a door, but the second he ran his hand over the surface, the bricks began shifting, crumbling. In the end, he barely needed to push.
He looked up at Cas. “And I finally just...I couldn’t take it anymore. So I ran away and chose a random village to settle down in.” A smile graced his lips. “And when I went to explore that very next day, I saw you. You were walking through the forest, bending to study the plants and flowers for nothing but their beauty. And I just knew...I finally felt it.”
“I’m always going to him about this, just throwing all my bullshit at him, and he doesn’t deserve that!”
“Dead…” Castiel muttered without looking away from his opponent. “She bled out within moments.” He finally glanced at her. “What are you doing here?”
"So then she just flat out asked me to meet up...in person! Like, out of nowhere!" she stared at Castiel expectantly, but he just stared back.
Cas held up his hands in an appeal. “Please,” he murmured. “I’ll give you the key, just let me free the cat so I can take care of its leg.”
The idea of throwing himself on his bed and sleeping for a week sounded appealing, but he wanted to shower first. He want to wash away any trace of the Castiel he used to be. He wasn't that boy anymore.
Ana stopped walking and turned slowly to face the wall beside them. She pointed, and Sam swung his light up to illuminate the giant mural.
"What will you do then?" Castiel demanded. "You need a diploma to get anywhere in the world right now."
Anna smiled widely, her eyes mischievous as she stepped forward to shake Dean’s free hand. “Castiel has told me all about you!”
He spoke until his throat felt hoarse, but still he pressed on. He described the scene as he had last seen it, with the grass brown and withered, and the town destroyed and burning, and the new wall—tall and strong, except for that one broken gap.
“Right?” Dean agreed with a grin. He grabbed the bag of grapes and allowed the fridge door to slam shut as he claimed a seat with them at the table.
Victor stood, towering over Dean, who remained calmly in place. “If Ash hadn’t gone snooping where he didn’t belong, I can guarantee you he would be alive today. None of this would’ve been necessary!”
"Thank you, Ms. Milton," Dean said, but her attention was already back on her Bible. Castiel led Dean into the kitchen, and as they set their books and supplied out on the table, he smiled up at Castiel. “How was your morning?”
“Wait, what?!” Sam cried out, but at his girlfriend’s pleading expression, he just rolled his eyes. “Fine, I’ll think about it.”
“Will a trade agreement be strong enough?” Sam wondered, giving voice to the question that had popped into Castiel’s own mind.
Castiel thought about what Dean had said the night before, about this being more, and he couldn't help but agree.
Dean looked back at the machine, disgusted. Now he understood why this needed to be hidden. Hell, his gut told him that it needed to be destroyed.
Dean had enough on his plate with running the sanctuary, keeping everyone safe and fed. He didn’t need some sappy omega who’d caught feelings pining after him, especially an omega who was pregnant with another alpha’s pup.
At some point Cas woke up, growling in irritation at Brady’s whiny voice he could hear from the phone. When Brady offered quadruple, Cas reached over to tap my chest.
Castiel stared at the words, made blurry by the alcohol and pain shooting through his head. Suddenly, it was the funniest thing he'd ever read. Victor had left it there so he would be taken care of, and now look. He was being taken care of, all right.
Castiel couldn’t even answer that, because he didn’t know the answer himself. He wanted Dean, that was obvious, but he couldn’t have him. He’d already invested too much into his career into a life of service to his father, his family. He couldn’t risk that. He had to stay focused.
"Wait, I think I've met him... Snarky dude with a British accent who wears all black and scares the shit outta everybody?"
Had he known that the conversation would end with Castiel once again leaving him behind, he’d have run at the very start. Now, he was even worse off than before, physically, mentally, and emotionally. His body, reacting to the nearness of its True Mate, had pushed things into overdrive, and he could feel the flush rising up his chest toward his neck, the sweat trickling down his temple.
Dean had to admit that he’d been worried at the way Castiel had closed up, unwilling or unable to talk when they’d arrived back. Now, to see him taking lead and guiding the kids through a game...it was night and day.
“Meanwhile, Gloria wins, Pete is gone, along with his skeevy relatives, making it easy for his legislation to actually do some
“Dean, everything he’s done has been to protect you. Even when he was with Crowley, he’d go check on you all the time.”
"Yes, you should've waited," Castiel agreed simply, not offering any more. Dean sighed, squeezing his hand tightly.
Dean realized why Castiel was so hesitant. Why he seemed to still hold part of himself away, protective and secret. It was simple self-preservation, preparation for later this evening when Dean would say, “Your family is awful; thanks, but no thanks.”
“Well, word’s gotten back to him, and he knows that I’ve got something good, something he can sell for a pretty penny.”
Cas looked back down at the letter, the acceptance letter to the City College of New York. His boyfriend’s acceptance letter to the City College of New York, which was...“This is right by me!”
Now that the alpha, Gordon, had gone, Castiel couldn’t stop the trembling. He reached out to grab the young man’s arm and squeezed tightly.
When he went to sit in the east drawing room, the cat followed and curled up in his lap as he read before the fire. But the usual silence of the room suddenly seemed wrong, so he began to read aloud.
I realized immediately what this was: another chance. A chance to find Cas and lay it all on the line, like I should’ve done weeks ago.
At fucking three in the morning, my phone buzzed and jerked me from sleep. I squinted, trying to focus on the name: Bag of Dicks. I groaned.
Everyone’s attention was on Sam and Anael, how their first meeting would go, since that was the whole reason for this visit. Dean
She watched him go, and only once he was out of view did she allow her worried expression to drop, crumple into the anger and hate she’d hidden so well throughout their conversation.
"You'd better not," Crowley muttered. He leaned back in the seat and looked out the window intently.
“Goddamn, Cas,” Dean breathed. His head fell back with a soft thud as his eyes slid shut. Cas shoved one of his thick thighs between Dean’s to grind against him. Dean’s hands fell to his hips, guiding him as they rolled against each other hungrily. “Just like that, Baby.”
Dean shrugged. "I was up there hanging out in the stall, and I saw your number and thought, 'Why the hell not?'"
Cas immediately turned away, purposefully staring straight across the street. No need to make this day shittier with a beatdown from some fratboy drug dealer.
Dean sighed and turned to him. “I, uh...I wanted to properly apologize for that. I shouldn’t have ru—”
“But not really,” Meg interjected. She glared at her cousin, her expression determined. “I don’t know how many times I’ll have to say this before you believe it: you are worth everything. Everything, Castiel! And if Dean can’t see that, then he isn’t worth a pile of shit, and he’s definitely not worth you.”
“I feel that I should be the starstruck one,” Arthur teased. “A real-live prince fangirling over me? And you can call me Ketch.”
“No shit.” Dean swung his flashlight beam back and forth, up and down. Suddenly, he froze and swung his flashlight beam back down to the ground. There were the three missing workers, all shot in the head and left to bleed out.
Why wouldn’t M. Winchester just let Cas fade away? He had to know from the others in town how deplorable a human being Cas was. Cas knew M. Winchester talked to them all frequently, for he was always in town, or at least he had been whenever Cas was there.
Almost as if they couldn't help themselves, his blue eyes skipped back to the last stall in the mirror's reflection. He could just barely make out the handwriting on the wall, reminding him, mocking him.
Suddenly the cat was there, nosing into the basket. It bit into one of the fish and trotted back into the house, dragging its breakfast with it.
Castiel spent the rest of the day in a slump. No one had ever affected him the way Dean did, and it was shoving his entire psyche off balance. He didn't like it one bit.
Dean's words ran through his mind, but Castiel shoved the thought away. Nothing that Dean had said was anywhere near the truth. He wasn't being used; he was the one using these other fuckers.
The rest of the tour seemed to drag on for Dean. He’d considered canceling a stop so he could run back to Cas, swoop him off his feet, but he knew that wouldn’t be fair to the fans. Besides, Cas might still be with Jacob, or possibly even another new person. So Dean’s tour went on as scheduled for more long, lonely weeks.
She nodded. “Red. An alpha’s eyes turn red in moments of...” she struggled to find the right phrasing, “let’s call it heightened emotion.”
. Castiel wanted a little more time to think about what he wanted to say, but before he could even hope to organize his thoughts into some semblance of something useful, the final bell rang and his legs were carrying him to Dean's car.
Before he could dive down that spiral, Castiel pushed the sadness from his mind and kept a bright smile plastered on.
She did eventually meet Dean, of course. Yeah, he was a bit of a flirt, and it seemed he had a different girl passing to-and-from his bedroom each week. But she also saw how proud he was of Sam, how much hope he held for his future. Sam told her that every bit of money that didn’t go to essentials or bills, Dean set aside for Sam’s college fund.
"I've never been here with anyone else before," Castiel admitted almost absently as he studied Dean studying the menu.
Castiel’s eyes shot up to meet Dean’s, his expression soft and grateful. “That’s what he used to always say, too.”
“Of course I am,” Castiel responded, his voice firm even as his posture stiffened. “It’s just been a long couple of days, as I’m sure you can understand.”
"I deduced," Crowley replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Castiel shot him a look in the rearview.
“But of course!” Zachariah gushed, standing to shake Dean’s hand vigorously. “If you can get us this account, I dare say you’d be one of the fastest promoted executives in the history of the company.”
“You think that’s funny?” Dean asked indignantly. “I could have died!” But then he was smiling again, warm and easygoing. Castiel’s cheeks heated, but he didn’t look away.
With the reminder of Dean’s boss, Cas’s mind slammed to a halt. “Wait..." He shook his head, took a step back, pulled his wrist from Dean’s grasp. "You lied to me! For
“I was in the neighborhood; thought I’d stop by to say hi,” Dean explained with a shrug. As if there were no other reason than for the sake of seeing Castiel.
“Yin and Yang?” Dean asked. Too late he realized his tone had turned teasing. Somehow, he didn’t mind it.
“How’s it going in here?” Castiel heard from the door. He turned to find Dean standing there, but couldn’t find it in himself to provide much of an answer.
“Did you now?” Dean asked nonchalantly. “Because, if I remember correctly, you kept hounding me every step of the way.”
“What did she say?” I tried to keep my voice level. All I wanted to do was punch that hag in the face, but he didn’t need that angry side of me right now.
“Um...I was kinda thinkin’ about, uh, gettin’ out of the game. You know...going legit.” I looked back at the TV, fully aware of the flush staining my neck and cheeks.
When he responded, Cas’s voice was soft...soft but sharp. “You know, they all wonder why I stay with Hester, why I let her push me around, her docile little bitch. I can see it in Dean’s eyes, every time we spend time with the family.”
The realization crackled through Castiel like ice, coating his heart and soul, leaving him numb: Amara had told him.
In the mid-fifties, military scientists had discovered the phenomenon. The promise had been “Higher planes of existence, sharper senses,” and even, “Discover your true soulmate!” The appeal of those promises had been far too enticing for many to ignore.
Cas nodded, and his face was so bright, so happy. She couldn’t be upset at him, not really. It wasn’t even
Dean smiled slowly, and damn that smile for still making Cas’s heart stutter. “Had a little help from some friends.”
But then there was no more time for him to worry, not when there was a new foe for him to worry about instead.
He reached the end of the row, still with that pained smile plastered on his lips, then slowly turned to begin the trek back to his resort. He'd been out for long enough, and now he only felt emptiness, exhaustion.
Castiel didn’t know where Dean disappeared to after the race; all he knew was that the omega wasn’t with Sam and the royal family when they arrived back at the palace. He heard through the grapevine that Dean had gone to Ketch’s estate for dinner, and dammit if that didn’t work up his alpha even more.
He leaned down to peck Mary on the cheek, waved to Ellen and Dean, reached over to fist bump Sam, and tried to pat Jo on her head, earning a punch to his bicep.
“It’s always so beautiful in the nighttime,” he explained. “All the lights of the city. The people.”
Dean kept a hand at Cas’s waist as they climbed the stairs, his thumb rubbing up under his t-shirt. His eyes a shocking blue beneath the club lights, Cas turned to smirk down at him. Dean’s breath caught in his throat. He was gorgeous, right here, like this, with the bright lights reflecting off his sharp cheekbones and dark hair.
“If it’s such a trifling sum, as you seem to think it, why not ask your father?” Meg flinched, but Hester pushed on. “I’m sure Lucifer would be more than willing to share with his own flesh and blood,” her tone was pleasant enough, but her expression was nothing short of cold, calculating. She’d known exactly how to truly wound her niece.
As soon as they reached the top of the stairs, they could hear the muffled sobs. Dean followed the heart-wrenching sound down the hall to a closed bedroom door. Another breath held. He pushed the door open. Another breath released.
As they moved together, their desire a rolling tide that built and built with each push, Castiel cried out, burying his face in Dean’s damp neck. He reveled in the sound of Dean’s voice cracking as he chanted Castiel’s name over and over, low and rough like a prayer.
The omega jumped up, and a wave of his scent washed over Castiel, making the alpha even dizzier. But more than that, it made him
“And uh...about Cassie.” Dean could see Cas tense, but he had to get this out there. “She came into my room, yes,” he shook his head. “Caught me by surprise. But I told her very clearly that I’m not interested in her. There’s someone else—another omega—I’ve fallen for.”
“Several of you have asked for me to accompany you to the festival next week,” he announced, gesturing to a cluster of young suitors before him, of whom Amara was obviously the most striking. An excited murmur ran through the crowd, but M. Winchester continued easily. “Yet I don’t feel I know you all well enough to really choose…so I propose a contest.”
“No, it's not that…” Dean hurried to assure him. Cas arched a brow, waiting for further explanation.
“No!” Hannah burst out, her red magic flaring. “No, I can’t do that to you!” Tears choked her next words. “You cannot ask that of me!”
Part of Cas—the part that still missed Dean with every painful beat of his heart—wished he’d call, or track Cas down, say it was all a big mistake and beg for forgiveness. Another part of him—the angry, bitter part that replayed the sting of Dean’s lies again and again in an unending loop—never wanted to see the bastard again.
Dean tried not to let that hurt him, that loss of faith. There’d been a day when Cas would’ve believed in Dean completely, when Cas would’ve laughed at the thought of a silly challenge from a dick-off like the Leviathan, but now…
The night before Valentine’s though, he was feeling that old restlessness crawl up his spine. He couldn’t risk another go with anyone, cause Lillith would find out and break things off again. So he did the next best thing and called up Winchester. There was no answer, but the voicemail said, “For business inquiries, call Ash” and listed a number.
“No!” Cas burst out, and Dean visibly flinched. “I mean, that’s not what I...” Dean took a step back, and something in Cas’s mind recognized that if Dean left now, Cas would never again see him. Panic drove him to his feet.
The device sent audio straight to his phone to be recorded, so he didn’t actually have to listen to the conversation while they were having it. Still, he slipped out a back door to “make a phone call” while Cas and Gabe escaped to Gabe’s office to “catch up.”
He pointed his camera back toward himself, but instead of snapping a picture, he switched the phone to video mode and pressed the red button. As the camera recorded, Castiel began to stroke down his chest toward his crotch with feather-light touches, not really doing anything, just teasing himself and, subsequently, his viewer.
But it was probably Dean—Dean and his kind smiles and happy eyes, his boisterous laughs, his shy blushes—that convinced Castiel. Dean who reacted so perfectly to Castiel, to his quirks and eccentricities. Dean who was unendingly patient and understanding. Dean was everything Castiel wanted, and he was his for the taking.
Dean barely controlled his eye roll. Because that really made it so much better, yes. Castiel had warned him just that morning about his family. He’d seemed genuinely worried about Dean’s reaction to his relatives, and now Dean understood. They were all a bunch of dicks.
Both Castiel and Dean glanced that way to find a beautiful girl about their age crossing the coffee shop towards them. Charlie’a wide-eyed gaze trailed her, a soft flush rising to her cheeks as the beautiful girl stopped at their table.
Castiel still dreamed of Michael, of course; he always would. But now when he woke from the nightmares, he found his alpha there to soothe him back into peaceful sleep.
“I won’t, okay? It’ll be fine.” He stood and walked toward the side table where he’d left his phone earlier. “I need to call Frank, see where he is on that…”
“Yes,” Dean replied with a roll of his eyes, but the sarcasm was offset with a gentle touch to Cas’s hair. “And, as an actual warlock, I can say with full authority that your excuses from the other night are absolutely silly.”
The only thing I could figure that kept him coming back was the sex, even though we hadn’t gone “all the way” yet. I
“You heard me! You think we haven’t noticed how distracted you’ve been? Playing your little game?” He shook his head disapprovingly. “And the worst part is, it’s like you wanted him to win!”
“No, I guess not,” Cas agreed, finally letting Dean capture his lips. He didn’t kiss back though. Some part of him just...couldn’t.
As Cas hurried up to him, Dean threw his arms around his boyfriend and lifted him in the air, pulling a giggle from Cas.
“Do you remember...” a long pause, almost as if he’d fallen asleep mid-conversation, as he had so many times before, but then he continued. “That day by the quad...”
"Ooh, a bench seat!" Castiel murmured, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. He reached across to run his hand over the denim fabric on Dean's inner thigh, but Dean intercepted his hand, instead linking their fingers together.
Castiel stared at her, uncertain. He knew that he didn’t need help; he was only four-and-a-half months along. But he dreaded the silence of an empty shower.
, Castiel realized. So that’s how he did it. Incorrect guessing led to corrections, and corrections always held at least some bit of the truth.
Two drinks and several stories later, Gabe suddenly jumped to his feet. “Oh shit! I gotta get back out to the booth. But look, I wanna talk to you again before you take off, ok?” He looked directly at Cas as he said this, and there was no misinterpreting his meaning: alone, without Dean.
Graduation approached, and he was surprised to learn that Novak had earned valedictorian. Apparently his whole “quiet student” bullshit hid quite a brain. Brady couldn’t wait to hear him stumble through his speech for graduation. At least there’d be something entertaining about all that sitting and standing and walking bullshit.
Castiel shrugged. “That sounds like a good question for your mom. I bet she knows all about the tooth fairy!”
“What?” he gasped. “Who did this to you?” He studied the device, hoping to find a way to release the mechanism. He tried tugging, pushing, punching the lever on the side, but nothing happened.
“Of course he was!” Gabe burst out, but his voice was farther than before, like Cas had moved away from him. “You would’ve solidified the alliance between them!”
at him, cared enough to sneer at him like usual. He’d been completely forgotten by the townspeople, just like he had been by his own family.
“What the hell is with these damn blogs!” Meg moaned. She leaned across the table to show Castiel her screen. “Apparently we’re getting back together again. Now it’s going to take me another three weeks, at least, to get that idiot to ask me out.”
"Where have I been all day? Where the hell have you been all day?" He challenged. "See, I was up in that bathroom, just like I'm supposed to. Because that's where whores belong!"
to help, but I wouldn’t let him. He had the brains, he’d be the one to do big things, help people. That was his job: keep his grades up for those big scholarships.
“Fuck!” Dean whispered as he slammed his mouth onto Cas’s, wrapping his arms around the man’s neck and pulling him close.
Castiel stepped forward to go greet Dean, welcome him back, but before he could get very far, Cassie was there, throwing herself onto Dean with a loud cry of, “I was so worried about you!”
The nightmarish god halted, and its expression looked shocked. The demonic figures shattered away, leaving their creator to fight Cas alone. It gasped in pain as Cas’s hand twisted in midair. He tightened his fingers into a fist, and the monster shuddered.
and even up to his MFA. He was scared, sure, but he knew that was where he was meant to be. The one time he had hinted at possibly going somewhere a little closer, like maybe Notre Dame, both Dean and Naomi had shot him dark looks and, each in their own way, called him a dumbass.
Dean left half the team there to keep watch while him, Benny, and Meg made the short drive further up the mountain to Crowley‘s mansion. They snuck in through a side gate that Cas had left wedged open with a rock, and Dean could hear the party still in full swing.
“Sammy…” Dean murmured. Sam finally stopped yelling long enough to finally look at his brother, to see the slight blush and shiny eyes.
His name was Dean Smith, and he was an investment banker. He’d just moved to California for work, but he missed his old life back in Kansas. He still needed to transfer his gym membership, he preferred Vonnegut to Brautigan, and he’d take a plain old beer any day.
"Open the door, Cas!" Dean commanded. Dean's expression was stern, his tone firm and authoritative, but even in his inebriated state, Castiel could recognize the fear in those green eyes, which just caused more confusion. Why would Dean be afraid?
Crowley’s laugh thundered through the dining room. “I have no doubt of that!” He smirked at Dean. “Yet you keep your hands to yourself?”
As Dean stepped back up to crowd him against the counter, he brushed light fingers over  Castiel’s panties.
“Oh my god,” he breathed. “You’re Arthur Ketch. You—you designed the original 330...” he trailed off.
Dean couldn’t help his frown at the worshipful tone in Cas’s voice. It was the same tone Cas used to use when he talked about Dean…well, he hadn’t known it was Dean, of course. He’d just known him as a faceless thief working the Bulgary job.
It only took a couple of steps before he heard the gentle call. “Dean?” The whisper barely broke the steady thrum of the rain, but it was enough to stop Dean in his tracks.
He started to text back, but Anna shook her head, still tapping away at her own screen. “No, that number won’t work.”
Dean smirked and reached up to tug at Cas’s plump lower lip with his thumb. “Are you trying to kill me?” Cas nipped at the pad of his thumb, his smile downright wicked.
Dean smirked as he pressed against the spot again, pulling another long moan from Cas. Castiel began to rock his hips back onto Dean's fingers, letting out little gasps and pants and moans every time Dean brushed that special spot.
Gabriel, who’d been holding in his mirth, suddenly burst out laughing. “Oh my god, I wish I could see Cassie’s face when he sees them!”
He'd never planned for it, never expected it. Just a few weeks ago, he never would have thought that something like this would happen to him, that someone like Dean would happen to him. And now that he had, Castiel didn't want to let this go, let him go.
"If you really wanna touch me, all you gotta do is ask. No need to go knocking me off my feet," he teased. Gordon just glared at him. "Just keep the offer in mind, big guy."
“What the hell are you doing here?” Dean ground out quietly as Cas spun and began leading them away into the house. Dean tried to keep his focus on the back of Cas’s head, to ignore the golden skin of Cas’s back. He clenched his hands at his side.
Castiel walked into the familiar house he’d visited so many times, his stomach twisting anxiously. He had no idea what he was going to say. He’d thought about it the whole time he was driving, but he still had no words.
His brain skipped back to that one thought, too shocked and distracted to really think of anything or anyone else for very long: Holy fuck, Cas had arrested him.
“Would it be appropriate?” he finally mumbled. M. Winchester’s brow furrowed in confusion, and Castiel hurried to explain. “Given that you’re courting Amara?”
Castiel stepped up to Dean and smiled lasciviously. “They are a bit tight, I'll give you that...but it's so worth it.” He pressed a brief kiss to Dean’s lips and sauntered toward the door.
So now Castiel lived in a drafty old house—unwanted, forgotten, alone but for the few times he ventured into town for some shopping. And even then, he somehow felt even more alone, more unwanted.
“What?” Dean snapped. Silence, then Dean spoke again. “Ok, we’re square. Now get the hell out of here.”
But, ever aware of his duties, he kept vigilant. By the time dessert was plated, he could say with absolute certainty that there was nothing there on either side for Sam or Ana. So he closed off that part of his mind and instead focused on finding another option to solidify their alliance.
The guy hadn't bugged him in weeks, but that didn't mean anything. He could have just been biding his time, waiting for the perfect moment. And right now, alone in this bathroom with Castiel too sick to put up much of a fight... This was a perfect moment, if ever he wanted one.
Castiel began to rock faster, his entire body trembling as Dean's cock slid in and out. Suddenly, it wasn't enough anymore. Castiel sat back up and rested his hands on Dean's chest for support as he began to move faster. He lifted himself up then dropped back down, whimpering as the head of Dean's cock brushed over his prostate.
Castiel groaned. Dean stepped back and yanked him off the counter. He spun him around and bent him over so that the dark-haired boy's hands splayed flat on the counter while his ass stuck out perfectly.
Cas groaned. “What the hell are you even saying? Do you hear yourself? I’m not some bitch to be traded and sold!”
Dean sighed and tossed the phone away. So tomorrow night, he’d hint at the idea of meeting Cas’s family. Because, as much as he was enjoying this, what would be the point of maintaining the relationship otherwise?
