, your sugar baby, is welcome to be here any time and another thing to say me and my kid that you knew nothing about are welcome here.”
“I didn’t really like that venue.” Tony changed the subject, and Steve took it as the hint it was. “The hotel is beautiful but the more I think about it, the more I want to be married outside. Maybe upstate, away from the city.”
“Can we go back to bed?” Steve mumbled around the shove of the Omega’s tongue in his mouth, yanking at the robe ties so he could get to skin. “Omega, my Omega let’s just go back to bed. Can’t knot you till we bond and I want to do that all the right way but let me just get my tongue in you at least.”
Tony was quiet, pale and withdrawn, arms folded tight to hide the way his hands were shaking, eyes wide as he watched the Alpha uncertainly.

It took Steve a full six minutes to calm himself down enough to even walk upstairs. The whiplash of being so worried about Tony being hurt to being so goddamn
“God no.” Bucky crammed another bite of pizza into his mouth and shook his head. “I can’t get you into a bar on singles night, I know better than t’ask about an escort. Plus Tasha would rip  my knot clear th’fuck off for that. No, I’m not talkin’ bout that sorta thing at all.”
“You laid my clothes out on the bed for me?” Steve ignored the sass and sucked Tony’s earlobe into his mouth, teeth sharp and tongue
“Because nothing this good ever lasts.” The Omega said softly, miserably. “You said it right, this is a fairy tale and I’m Cinderella and now I’m just waiting for midnight and I can’t relax until
“I’m not traumatized.” Tony wiped at his eyes carefully and grabbed the lotion to hide his shaking hands. “I’m just careful.”
“Fine fine.” She waved him off. “But you managed something pretty at least, yes? Maybe a bit of lace?”
“I uh--” Tony was still having a hard time talking, and Steve kissed his knuckles again, rumbling under his breath until the Omega’s shoulders relaxed at least a fraction. “I’m fine. Didn’t really expect to have that strong of a reaction. Still getting used to-- to this. To us and actually having options.”

Despite Bucky's size, swagger, sheer amount of bullshitting and general impatience when it came to anything even slightly inconvenient or time consuming, the Alpha never actually
“Nope.” The Alpha said flatly. “When I was younger I had bad asthma and the cold water made it hard to breathe. Now that I’m big, I just sink to the bottom of the pool or lake like a big ol’ rock. No swimming for me.”
The next morning they showered together in the small apartment bathroom, and Steve braced Tony carefully at the walls before dropping to his knees and licking around Tony’s hole, slurping and lapping and open mouth kissing until the tight rim eased and he could work his fingers into grasp at the base of the plug.
I was at the hotel and downtown at that diner looking for someone else. Honest. I happened t’see you and the baby and that lady outside the hotel but I hadn’t figure out what t’think about it yet and then I saw you with that real pretty Omega inside the diner and that didn’t make any sort of sense to me.”
“I don’t know if we’re ready for a dog.” Tony smiled apologetically at the same time Steve declared, “We’ll take the fattest puppy in the litter!”
“Yeah.” Bucky interrupted. “Yeah, it’s unacceptable and yeah I was a fuckin’ asshole about it but you can beat my ass later. Right now you need’ta stay calm and be nice.”
“I saw you outside the hotel and didn’t know what was up, then saw ya at the diner and stayed to watch where you went.” Bucky suddenly felt cold, frozen to his bones thinking about how Steve would feel knowing the Omega he loved lived in such squalor. “When you went runnin’ down the street just now I came in t’get nosy but I never thought--”
memory of his mother ever cooking. Maria Carbonell Stark hadn't spent much time in the kitchen other than Christmas Eve morning when she made pancakes for her and Tony to share together. Christmas at the Stark household had involved stuffy parties with politicians, a full staff to do all the cooking and decorating and gift wrapping, and a Christmas morning that was usually overseen by an exhausted Maria, an already annoyed Howard and a bevy of hired help whose sole job was to keep Tony out from beneath their feet while the house was readied for yet another holiday party.
then-- and for the record, I feel like it should bug me that you guys do that but I’ve met the rest of the friend group and you two aren’t even the scariest, so it’s fine. But if we’re being honest about everything..”
Steve was cleaning up in the kitchen while Tony locked the door and went up to make sure Peggy and Pete had found everything for bed, and when the Omega came back downstairs, he slipped up behind his Alpha and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, pressing up to the blond’s strong back and snuggling close.
“Easy does it, big guy.” Valkyrie put both hands up peacefully while Hope hide a fangy, knowing grin behind her hand as she sized up the situation. “I didn’t mean anything by it, I’ve just only seen people this pretty on stage in Las Vegas and

“That Omega isn’t invested enough to know you spend Memorial Day with your family. He didn’t know about the annual Fourth of July thing. He’s got no interest in kids, in family, he didn’t even--”
was Tony convinced to do whatever it took to get Steve to the point of being just a little selfish in bed, just a
“I can imagine it just fine.” Tony answered quietly, and Steve had another uncomfortable moment of realizing he didn’t know the whole story, or at least that
“Are you gonna sigh and roll your eyes over the excess?” Steve palmed over Tony’s ass, kneading and gripping until Tony popped his fangs teasingly and pushed the grasping hands away. “You haven’t even see what I bought yet!”
Diapers and wipes in huge boxes, and then pull ups because with life being abruptly less stressful than it had been in the last several months, Tony would finally have the time and energy and patience to start working on potty training. An electric razor for the few times Tony needed to shave instead of struggling with dollar store blades. High end shampoos and conditioners in big bottles and baby soap for Peter’s baths.
, not sure if he was charmed to hell by Steve’s fumbling or if he wanted to scream with laughter at the sheer lack of smoothness. “Obviously trying to
“It’s… fine.” Tony ducked his head to study the highly polished silverware so it wouldn’t be quite as obvious how much Steve’s apology and
“Trust me with your phone number?” Steve rumbled, pleased, and the Omega answered quietly, sweetly, “After tonight?
“Tasha, stop.” Steve rolled his eyes. “Tony’s been sick, this is the first time we’ve seen each other in a few weeks, I haven’t had a chance to even talk to him about Memorial Day.”
“She can’t have kids.” Steve slipped his arm around Tony’s waist and tugged him across the couch cushion so the Omega could look at the apartment options for Peggy. “I’m not really sure and she doesn’t talk about it much, but we all know it bothers her. When Val and Diana had their kids, Tasha took an assignment that had her gone for almost four months trying to cope and of course, after work like that, she ends up scenting like blood and danger. Most Omegas won’t even come near her, kids tend to run the other way… the fact that Pete went right to her and decided he loved her is huge. The fact that you trusted her with Pete is huge. It means a lot to her.”
“Two of the days.” Tony nodded. “Me and Clint have got that interview at the new place later this week, and I’m only going to work three days--”
worth of reconciliation to seek and forgiveness to beg for before I let you anywhere near my mate or our child.”
“I will make fun of you for everything from how high you wear your pants to the way you thought socks and sandals were acceptable beach attire, but I’d never make fun of you for this sort of thing.” Tony promised, then lifted Steve’s hand to kiss his knuckles and settled it down low on his own stomach. “So tell me, if we were having a kid, what would you want to name him?”

.” The Alpha said firmly and Tony’s soul warmed with the conviction in those gorgeous blue eyes. “But if I’m ever going to be in the running for Dad of the Year, you’ll have to mess up somehow and my fingers are crossed that the mess up involves Pete repeating a bad word.”
The frantic sound torn from Tony’s throat when the Command registered in his psyche would have broken a less determined Alpha, the way the Omega immediately turned his head and bared his neck, dropped his gaze and tried to curl in invisible
“I’ve got this.” Immediate regret made the words thick as Bucky scooped up the diaper box under one arm, put the messenger bag over his shoulder. “You just get Pete, alright? C’mon, we’re fine. Just-- just get going.”

You can leave and live a life, you can move on if you want but I’m asking you to choose

in a heartbeat. Once you get past that hardcore intensity and jokes that are--” he winced. “--borderline homicidal, you’ll love them.”
Tony loved to feel Steve finish in him, coating his insides with hot release and throbbing, pulsing so far into his core. But this time Steve didn’t pull out and he simply kept
, I’ll never forgive you.” the cheeky Omega  decided and Steve just laughed under his breath and left a quick bite at a rather tempting bottom lip. “Steve, I’m serious. I refuse to allow my child to curse like a character in an old timey black and white picture.”
“Me too.” Tony’s heart was beating fast, anticipation and nerves making his sweet scent spike as Steve bent to mouth at his pulse, the Alpha’s tongue counting each rapid beat. “M--me too.”
to mention how he’d contemplated taking one of the knot centric pictures, since it seemed to be what sugar daddies did. Just drop trou and knot it up on camera… the idea had made him want to gag and he was glad the thought had been brief and fleeting before he’d settled on the one with his suit. “Friends. I’d like that.”
them. “I’ve got some friends coming into town tonight and I was hoping to get a reservation at your place. I hear you’ve got good food there.”
“I’ll punch him if you want me to though.” Steve dropped a kiss on Tony’s head as he passed by on the way to the grill on the back deck. “Just say the word, sweetheart. I’ll lay his Bronco ass out.”
“Alpha.” Tony rolled his eyes, but made sure to squeeze at Steve’s hand so the Alpha’s feelings wouldn’t be hurt. “Alpha, you have two carts and apparently every intention of buying out half of Costco. You will have way more contributions to Pete’s life than bad words.”
“It’s okay.” the words were muffled in Steve’s shirt as Tony burrowed in close. “It was really nice of you to introduce me to the people in your neighborhood, Mr. Rogers.”
“No, Tony has a firm rule about over nighters.” Steve put out a set of candles, then changed his mind and put them away… then changed his mind and set them out on the dining room table again. “He likes to be gone before ten o clock cos it’s at least a half hour ride back to his place.”

“It’s for you and Pete.” Steve repeated, picking up the receipt and tucking it into the envelope again, handing it back to the stunned Omega. “It’s for you and your future. You’re listed as a co-owner on the account, Peter is the beneficiary. It’s your money.”
And then with his hand spread wide over Tony’s stomach, cradling him gentle and possessive, growling into Tony’s ear– “Everything right here is
“Damn you Clint, I need tips tonight!” Tony called in the background. “Don't turn down a reservation!”
“That’s so unfair.” Steve scowled. “They make it damn near impossible for you to live on your own, look down on you when you try and then threaten to put you back in an unsafe position when you ask for help? I never-- I never thought about how hard it is for Omegas before, that’s
The Alpha waited until Tony was almost out of sight and around the corner before turning his car back on and creeping along slow to follow Tony down the street. He couldn’t imagine where the Omega was going on foot right now-- the subway was the other direction and ten blocks north, the bus stop was passed without hesitation, and Tony ignored the flashed lights of available taxis cruising the street looking for a drunk to take home. Bucky had no idea where Tony might be headed that was close enough to walk to, but this was a dark, dangerous part of town and ihe briefly considered blowing his own cover and simply zooming up on Tony to demand the Omega get in and let Bucky drive him somewhere.
“Beep beep bed.” The Alpha confirmed, looking up at Tony with a smile almost as excited as Peter. “Sound good to you?”
The idea that Tony apparently willingly worked at this place when it was real fuckin’ obvious that Steve would be happy to pay every single one of his bills was yet another mystery wrapped around the Omega, so Bucky filed that one away alongside the one about the kid, the old lady and why Tony only saw Steve once every two weeks.
After Peter was asleep on the side of the bed closest to the wall so he wouldn’t roll out, Tony sat on the cold floor and leaned against the bedframe with an exhausted sigh. He pulled a box of bills out from beneath the bed and what was left of his tips from the week from his pocket and spread the pages out to begin dutifully counting out dollars to pay each bill.
until they were both gasping, the Alpha growling and Tony trilling and purring every time they parted enough to breathe.
, Steve. You invite me over to meet your friends and one of them actually said ‘my personality is an acquired taste’ before fighting with the other one about devilled eggs?”
He didn’t want to bring up the settling issue with the Alpha yet, mostly because Tony couldn’t bring it up without having to explain the
have stolen the watch from you, we’d like you to come down and confirm a few things with us before we call the police and have them arrested.”
“Sure.” Steve put a careful arm around Peter’s waist and held the baby a little tighter. “Can you tell me your animal’s name?”
“Obviously.” Mr. Stark repeated, and he sounded almost relieved. “I had thought for a moment you lost the child too, thought perhaps you were so traumatized by the events that you’d decided you couldn’t come home and maybe left the city entirely.”
“Welcome home, Captain.” Tony’s smile was almost shy, mouth tilting up at the corners and movements hesitant as he plucked at the delicately thin strap of a satin slip and let it fall down to bare his shoulder. “I’ve been waiting on you.”
“Oh I’m not a stripper.” Tony blushed furiously, suddenly regretting his attempt at wearing a sexy outfit.
The second the words were out of his mouth, Tony winced. Nothing like bringing up the sugar baby arrangement while they were trying to sexy to kill the mood. “Uh, what I mean--”
Tony’s scent calmed gorgeous, apple blossoms and chamomile layering wholly content and settled against his mate, but then--

Walking into this date, Tony had been prepared to dust off all old mannerisms and behavior, ready to play coy and sweet and soft for an Alpha who no doubt wanted a traditional, submissive Omega to be their sugar baby. If that’s what it took to make sure he and Peter’s bills were paid, then that’s what he was going to do.
as he traced around Tony’s hole, dipping inside the loose entrance to coax more free. “Oh sweetheart, this is so beautiful. I had no idea this sort of thing could be so damn beautiful. Look at you.”
truth, but nothing about it was a lie either. The watch was beautiful and Tony had loved it, but it was a ridiculous item for
“This one is full of Encyclopedias.” the Omega pointed to the bottom shelf. “And since Encyclopedias are printed and then almost immediately out of date or incorrect to some extent thanks to how fast technology moves and how quickly our understanding of the world changes, they must either be a gift from someone you love or a self purchase from a year that holds some sort of nostalgia for you.”
“Not at all.” Steve latched onto Tony’s neck, digging his fangs in and worrying a purple bruise onto the Omega’s porcelain skin. “I want you t’go, get good and pampered, take all damn day. Do whatever you want.”
“I was just curious, Spangles.” Tony soothed him with a sweet kiss. “I was just curious. Don’t worry about it. But I hope you know if anything like that
Steve jerked forward before Bucky could finish the sentence, gathered up Bucky’s shirt in both fists and
“God that’s good, but I’m not going to last, baby.” the Alpha grit out through clenched teeth, and Tony choked out a desperate laugh, nodding and nearly sobbing when Steve’s calloused palm closed at his cock to stroke him.
.” Steve didn’t know where to look first, couldn’t decide if the tiny rhinestones on the still secured strap were more eye catching than the rippled fall of champagne colored fabric against Tony’s skin, or if the peak of pebbled nipples at the bodice were more distracting than the length of leg showing where the slip parted at Tony’s thigh. “
There were three different forks, two knives, three different glasses for different drinks on the table. The napkins were embroidered linen, the table cloths pristine and crisply ironed, the wait staff dressed in all black complete with ties and dress shoes. When Tony used to visit places like this, they had greeted him as
“Don’t ever say that.” Peggy clicked her tongue, wisely choosing to ignore the mention of diamonds. “No matter what you were doing today, whether you were working or having fun. you can’t blame yourself for Peter getting sick, these sort of things just happen.”
to just get up and head towards the door without kissing or hugging Tony or promising another hundred times that everything was going to be okay. Steve didn’t know where to begin with his questions or whether or not Tony would be open to giving answers. He didn’t know if he’d done the right thing by not acknowledging the baby or if Tony would resent him for that since the Omega hadn’t made any move to invite Steve’s attention to the kiddo beyond checking to see if they could both stay so Steve just didn’t
“Wake up all the way, sleepy bug.” Tony roused the toddler to full wake, and smiled hesitantly at Steve when Pete just burrowed into his chest and refused to look at Steve. “Sorry, he’s shy. All he knows is me, Peggy and Clint so he doesn’t do very well with new people. He might not even talk to you.”
“I don’t see why not.” Clint caught the phone easily and pulled up a few profiles he’d already pre-scouted for his friend. “Someone needs to do
“Tasha, you look nice today. Love the leather vest on you, really shows off that chest tattoo.” Steve had to bend far over for the other Alpha to kiss his cheek, but it was either bend over or be taken out at the knees, so.... “I thought you’d given up coming by for our football parties.”
Nah nah nah, Bucky wanted to like the bright eyed Omega but he couldn’t like anyone who would end up breaking Steve’s heart. His friend had survived almost fifteen years of deployment, he’d even survived a helicopter shot out of the sky and crashing into the desert sand, but Steve would
, so he repeated, “No, not particularly. But I work full time at the… restaurant…and pick up as many shifts as possible so this arrangement has to fit in around the schedule.”
“I’m so glad.” Tony chewed at his bottom lip distractedly for a moment. “You um-- you look like you could use a shower too?”
“Don’t stop.” Tony reached to spread his own ass, grabbed at himself and offered up his entrance to his boyfriend. “Come on.”
The reassurance from Steve about his friends perceptions and intentions and the way they would feel about Peter went along way towards easing some of the stress at Tony’s shoulders, and late the next afternoon when first Clint and Peggy, then Bucky and Natasha showed up for dinner, he managed to greet volatile couple with a smile.
“T-Tony…” Steve’s hands settled cautious at his waist and Tony smiled, knowing and dirty, ran his tongue over the shell of Steve’s ear and whispered--
“Wowza!” Clint’s blue eyes bugged out wide. “And since that’s a word I hardly ever say, I’m gonna go ahead and say it again.
It was three am and Tony was only now off shift at the diner. The Omega hadn’t heard his phone buzz with the message from Steve nearly six hours ago and even though replying at some god-awful time of the morning was most likely a stupid idea, the Alpha had messaged back
thirty. But it doesn’t have anything to do with your looks, I bet you’d be this pretty at fifty and sixty too.”
“Very fun.” the Alpha decided. “I can’t wait for all those days with you, but you know, I wanted to talk to you about something else. Sort of related to this but-- but different.”
“You can talk while I make breakfast, huh?” Steve eased away reluctant after another long moment, holding onto Tony until the Omega found his feet and smiling when Tony instinctively came back for another quick kiss, up on his toes and nuzzling their noses together before finally settling. “I usually just make eggs and bacon but I also make a mean waffle. Does Pete eat waffles?”
Now the apartment was sparsely furnished and Steve only stopped by if he needed a shower or a nap between back to back missions or if Tony was out of town and not home at the Tower. Every few months Tony swung by to make sure the ancient pipes were holding up and that the radio hadn’t shorted out and caused an electric issue, but beyond that, there was nothing
“Yep.” Tony flinched just a little when the Alpha’s voice jumped a notch or several in shock. “One of
“I’m fine.” Even while greasy Tony was singlehandedly the  most beautiful person Steve had ever seen in his life, and he cupped at Tony’s cheek tenderly as they kissed. “How are you?”
“I’m twenty.” Tony had been fully committed to the lie of being twenty one right up until this very moment, but he was already keeping so
Tony made it home the next day by lunchtime, several hours past when he’d planned to sneak out of Steve’s place and get back to Peter, but still a few hours before work so he could catch up his friend about the night.
The Omega didn’t scream though, only hugged Peter up to his chest and kept waiting until they were allowed to go home.
“Uh, thanks. Right, that’s what I’m supposed to do, pick what my date is going to eat and drink. That’s normal.” Steve tried to smile, keeping his fangs carefully covered and his voice purposefully even. It wouldn’t do to let everyone in the vicinity know how nervous he was, the way his tie was strangling him and how the suit jacket felt itchy and foreign pulling at his shoulders and the dress pants weren’t near as comfortable as his favorite pair of jeans. The dress shoes pinched at his feet and he’d shaved his-- as Tasha so
Tony's contented, pleased laughter carried in clear from the living room, and Steve paused in stirring the sauce long enough to hang his head and blow out a carefully measured breath.
in a dirty apron taking a big bag of trash out to the nasty dumpster from the hole in the wall shitty diner.
“Archibald Stark Rogers?” Steve didn’t know he could fall in love immediately with a dog, but when Archie cracked a sleepy eye at him and yawned theatrically wide, he thought his heart would burst. “Tony, are you serious?”
“Mr. Rogers.” She started smoothly. “I can’t tell you how relieved we are that your piece wasn’t stolen, but
, but the Omega never let himself fall to pieces in front of Peter, so he only lifted his chin and tried for steady, “Thank you. I appreciate it. We um-- we won’t be any trouble.”
“The lottery, huh?” The Omega smiled, close enough that their mouths touched again. “So no one except Bucky and Natasha?”
“...okay.” Barely audible, but Tony put his cup down and grabbed the Alpha into a desperate, tear stained kiss when Steve leaned over to press their mouths together. “We’ll stay.”
It was as good as it always was, if not a little predictable in all the best ways. Steve never finished until Tony had come twice, he was so careful to not leave bruises and to not thrust too deep and leave Tony sore and when he came, Steve held Tony close for the first few pulses, then groaned out loud, easing out of Tony’s body to finish on the soft give of his boyfriend’s stomach.
“No no.” Steve cut in, shaking his head and voice hoarse as he took in the entire room, self control flickering as he looked back over his shoulder to the re-furnished and recreated apartment, back to the sheer
Tony plucked at the buttons on Steve’s jacket a moment. “Me and Mama used to go and pick out ornaments every year. We put our names and the year on it and every year we’d add to the collection on the tree. I’d like to start doing that with you?”
“The first of many presents from your sugar daddy?” Peggy winked suggestively and Tony blustered, “I didn’t even mean to ask for them! It just sort of slipped out and next thing I know, Steve ordered me half a dozen!”
over the Alpha’s body. Soap ran in rivulets along the lines of Steve’s bulk and Tony chased them with his fingers and then with his lips, tracking the scent down and down where it blended musky at the Alpha’s heavy cock and the Omega could open mouth taste pure desire.
rather you call me then sit there alone and miserable. But I don’t want you to have to do that because you don’t know how you’re going to make ends meet. If you call me crying, make it cos you had a bad day and want me to come cheer you up, make it because you tore your favorite shirt and want a new one or because you’re tired of the city and want a vacation. Not because you’re at your lowest point and feel bad about asking me for help. That kills me, knowing you were even in that position. It tears me up inside and I don’t want you to ever have to do that again.”
It was all terrible, but if this is what it took to start dating and ease some of his loneliness, then this is what Steve would do. He hadn't been able to stop looking at Tony’s picture all day and even though the Omega had waited until three am to message him back, Steve’s heart had still skipped a whole beat when his phone dinged with the notification.
“I am… able to rent because I pay cash for our apartment.” Tony began slowly, calmly, with all the resignation of someone who had tried and tried and tried only to have every avenue exhausted until
judged them for-- the sea bass and steak, lobster mac and cheese and asparagus as well as the rest of the bottle of wine he had purchased-- and the second they stepped outside the restaurant, Steve yanked at his tie and shoved it into his suit pocket, rolling his shoulders and popping his neck as he undid a few buttons at his collar.
“I said no.” Bucky jolted into action, snatched a hair tie off his wrist and twisted his hair up into a messy bun, hands on his hips as he surveyed the dismal apartment all over again. “Alright here’s what we’re gonna do. You’re gonna pack yourself a bag, get some stuff for the baby and the both of ya are gonna go downstairs and get in my car.”
been ringing for the better part of five minutes while he stood there sick-fogged and unable to think.
Peter turned his head to peer at Steve curiously-- curls riotous atop his head, chubby face flushed from napping and honey brown eyes lit through with gold flecks like sunshine in his gaze. His nose turned up just a bit at the end and when he smiled, a dimple spotted deep into his cheek and made him look positively mischievous.
“I think you’re spoiling me.” Tony gasped as the Alpha pinned him to the door of the master suite and started tearing at his pants.  “I can handle pillows and blankets but don’t you think spa gift certificate is a little much?”
“Friends.” Steve repeated, nodding tensely, everything in his core rebelling to the point of wanting violence if Tony, if
“Yes.” More sure of his decision by the second, Tony ignored Bucky and took Natasha’s hand to lead her to where Peter was playing with Peggy. A day ago, an

you understand why we thought the Omega couldn’t possibly have come into the piece on his own? We make every effort to protect our jewelry and valued customers that purchase it so--”
“I think the Alpha’s falling in love.” she said wisely, and Tony flushed a dull red clear to his ears as he drowned a piece of lobster in butter and popped it in his mouth. “Tony, this is absolutely beyond what a sugar daddy does for a sugar baby, don’t you think?”
“Tell me about this sugar daddy.” Clint made a show of shaking out a napkin and laying it on the table before resting his head on the almost permanently sticky surface. “Is he going to pay you thousands of dollars a month to throw some booty at him?”
“By taking one day at a time and making sure Peter was always taken care of so no one would ever have a reason to think he’d be better off with out me.” Tony said wearily. “It’s like Clint. He’s an Omega with a disability so he ‘has’ to have someone take care of him. Living with Barney is worse than trying to live alone but Clint isn’t allowed that option. He either has to live with his shitty brother so there’s someone there to support him, or he has to move into an Omega shelter which are flat out terrible, or he has to prove he can afford to live by himself which is impossible because very few people hire Omegas full time and even less people rent to us.”
, Bucky. Tony makes me happier than I’ve been in a really long time and I’m not going to give it up just cos you and your scary mate don’t like that he isn’t going home with me for Memorial Day or on the boat for the Fourth or ready to sit down and talk kids names. Leave it alone.”
Omega and that was enough of a link to have the Alpha acting out of character from his usual level headed self, barking Commands and inadvertently scaring the hell out of someone who had had too hard a life to deserve to be scared like this.
“Yes, yes I definitely am.” Steve laughed, low and almost wanting, and making Tony’s stomach swoop for an entirely different reason with the way the Alpha’s voice bottomed out gravely when the whiskey soaked through his words. “Any I miss you. I wanna see you when I get home. Any chance you’ll be waiting in my bed, sweet Omega?”
myself to a wealthy Alpha just so I have a chance to get ahead and the second my kid gets sick, I’m right back where I started.”
“I hope you do get used to this.” Steve dug his thumb firmly into the arch of Tony’s bare foot and when the Omega squealed, he soothed it with a kiss to the delicate ankle bone and up Tony’s calf as he lifted one long leg over his shoulders. “And I hope you turn into an absolute brat, I would
No matter what, Tony was lying about a kid. Was it his kid or the older Alpha’s kid? Sure Bucky had thought the little guy looked like Tony but toddlers with curly hair and cute noses and big smiles weren’t exactly rare. Who was the old lady? Family that Steve didn’t know about? A Mom or Auntie or little brother? Why the hell were they all walking out together? How in the fuck did Steve treating Tony to some fancy hotel turn into permission for the Omega to invite additional people to the thing and more than likely drive the bill up even higher?
“Omega.” Steve was serious now, sitting up all the way and tipping Tony’s chin so the Omega would look into his eyes and know he meant every word. “This is the money I wanted to give you while we were dating. It’s to make up for all the times you turned down vacations or clothes or gifts, all the times you returned the stuff I bought you to pay for Peter’s clothes, all the times you had to work a double and then came all the way across town to see me. This is for the doctor’s appointments and the medicine and the bus rides before I got you the Uber account and all the groceries you had to count pennies to buy.
too far so Steve squashed the desire and instead just brushed at Tony’s cheek, at his chin, thumbed at the corner of his gorgeous mouth and eased away to break the kiss before he got carried away.
“You’re gorgeous.” Steve’s kiss was adoring, worshipful, one arm secure at Tony’s waist and the other hand sat warm at Tony’s knee as he teased his tongue between Tony’s lips and groaned over the taste of a wine soaked kiss. “Tony, you are
Most nights they watched a movie and went to bed early for some predictably, amazingly perfect sexy times, other nights they drank until Tony was tipsy and then danced in the living room until the stars came out, some mornings they lay in bed and shared an early breakfast, other mornings they slept late and went for brunch.
, you’re beautiful.” Steve abandoned the idea of cleaning up and crossed the room to sink onto the couch, unable to wait a single second more before burying his hands in the Omega’s hair and dragging Tony in for a kiss. “God, Tony. Anything you want to wear when you stay the night with me is fine. This is perfect, you are
“God yes.” Tony canted his hips up and rubbed unashamedly into Steve’s palm. “Been half ready all damn day thinking about how much you’d like this. Yes but--but what about dinner? I made you dinner so it could be the whole-- oh oh oh!” he writhed under purposeful strokes. “--the whole experience that you wanted--!”
, furnished with an extra couch and chairs, end tables and lamps, a rug on the floor to make it all cozy. The lights were on in the kitchen and the whole place smelled like pot roast and mashed potatoes, there were candles on the dining room table and a bottle of wine open in front of empty place settings, the radio was playing Bing Crosby and there at the door to the kitchen holding a glass of whiskey was
“The hell I will, I’m not staying late.” Clint retorted, then back on the phone— “So we good here? You won’t ruin my day and I won’t let the cook give you food poisoning?”
“Hey.” Steve blinked open sleepy and groggy a minute later, his smile for Tony a little confused but still adoring. “I didn’t hear you come in sweetheart. How was work?”
, typed in his card details and submitted the final payment for the expensive set, then closed his laptop with a smile when Tony blew him a kiss hurrying out the door.
“My advantage.” Steve repeated. “You just said yourself that I’m tired of groupies. I don’t want someone who is into me because I played a little pro ball, or because I’ve got medals from the war or because I’m an artist. I don’t want that.”
...and then Steve pulled him to a gentle stop as the Uber ride slowed down at the curb and flashed his lights for them.
The note from Steve made Tony laugh until tears ran down his face, then the Omega sat on the bed, clutched up the towels and cried into their downy softness until he was red eyed and hiccuping and embarrassed about his reaction but too overwhelmed to bother caring.
“Mmmm.” Tony sighed into a third kiss, then whispered as they parted, “Mr. Rogers, it is actually hysterical that you corrected your language in front of the two year old.”
“Peggy?” Tony smiled when he heard the toddler playing in the background. “Hey, I’m sending an Uber for you and Pete. Pack an overnight bag and come spend the night with me.”
“Oh my god.” The Alpha closed his eyes, then cleared his throat and opened them again, and without looking away, ordered-- “Goodbye Bucky and Tasha.”
A massive brunette Alpha filled the doorway, bigger and broader than Steve, dark hair and glacier pale eyes, dangerous fangs glinting in a smile that seemed less welcoming and more
“They were all just trying to figure out how a guy like me managed to find an Omega like you, and whether or not I’d ordered you from a catalog cos you’re

more sultry, this entire conversation would be out of either a cheap porno or one of those romance novels where the Alphas are full on nip nops out on the cover. You got good nip nops my man?”
I mean a piece of machinery I am weirdly obsessed with and would probably go into extended mourning over if I ever had to sell it.”
locked even if other people were over. If Bucky hadn’t stopped to lock the door and if something was going on with Tony---
No, the Omega wanted a kiss and he wanted to lose himself in Steve’s scent and Tony wanted to feel like real and desirable and
“Alright.” Bucky nodded. “Alright, we’ll leave it alone. We’ll only say it once and if it all blows up, we won’t say I told ya so and if it all works out, me and Tasha will be clappin’ the loudest at the wedding. I just had’ta tell you, okay? Had’ta say it at least once.”
Too many appearances in too short a time and the state might step in claiming Tony couldn’t take care of him, there could be an investigation into their living conditions, into Tony’s work schedule and income to verify if they would be better off in the government run Omega housing and in
Clothes came off slowly, both Alpha and Omega wanting to hurry but not willing to rush this first time together in close to six weeks. Every inch of skin exposed was caressed, every kiss just a breath more stinging, just a hint sharper as shirts and pants fell in a pile and Steve walked backwards towards the steamy bathroom, pulling Tony along with persuasive tempting kisses until they could slip under the pouring water and close the shower door.
to struggle and nobody wants to help someone they think is willingly struggling and dependent on the system.”
“Yeah, it’s my super power. Comes along with the hearing aid and the degree in sarcasm.” Clint reached out and snagged Tony’s arm, dragging the other Omega in for a quick kiss on the lips. “I expect an invitation to the wedding. And don’t think I forgot about knee capping that Barnes guy. What the fuck kinda name is Bucky anyway?”
“Strawberry it is. I wanted to ask you something--” Steve froze when this time Tony leaned across the table, closer and closer until his fingers were hovering at Steve’s lips and they were staring eye to eye, close enough that the Alpha’s cedar scent tinted rosy in
“Mr. Rogers, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood--” Tony started singing,  laughing when Steve spluttered in shock. “A beautiful day for a
Steve Rogers, Captain America, the man he loved more than anything was literally admitting that his biggest most intense fantasy was to be strong and healthy and dependable enough for someone to want his
But then-- “Mr. Carbonell?” The same genteel Omega that had checked Tony into the spa and brought him to a private dressing room to change into his robe knocked lightly at the door to the lounge and peeked around to smile at him. “I don’t mean to rush you, but have you finished your lunch?”
Steve shut the door behind himself as he went, and Tony waited until the sound of his heavy footsteps faded away down the hall to put Peter back into the blankets and reach for his phone.
Tony’s fingers were trembling as he opened the envelope and saw the money crowded inside, the reassurance that he wouldn’t have to worry about rent for at least the rest of the summer, that he and Pete could have an emergency nest egg built up that would offer a little buffer against the next doctor’s visit or act as a down payment for a better apartment.
“Oh damn, I love that.” Steve’s rosewood scent lifted hopeful. “You’re not just saying all this to make me happy, are you? I know the uh-- this sort of arrangement tends to encourage that sort of pliant behavior but I’d rather you just tell me the truth.”
times. When I was pregnant or in those bad weeks post partum when I didn’t know if me or Pete would survive, I used to imagine all the things I’d scream at my Dad or if I wasn’t imagining screaming at him, I’d imagine all the ways I’d flaunt just how fine I was without him, how many ways I could embarrass him in public or call him out for disowning me…”
“Yeah, I’ll just be another second.” Tony called, and once Steve went back down the hallway, Tony rolled to his side and stood up on unsteady legs to gather his clothes. His core was twinging with each step towards the bathroom and once inside, he didn’t look in the mirror at his still flushed cheeks and destroyed hair as he re-wet the wash cloth and wiped down between his thighs but when Tony went to step back into his underwear, the Omega paused and shivered with the memory of the way Steve’s voice had gone hoarse and
“It’s good thing you’re here to distract your Daddy from being stupid all the time, huh?” he teased, and Peter-- who had no idea what was happening-- just grinned and kicked his legs when the Omega ducked under the table to clean his mess. “Yeah, you and your mess are super distracting but I love you anyway. I love you anyway!”
“You coming back to bed, Tony?” The Alpha caught a break in Pete’s non stop chatter and held out his hand for him. “Come over here and hear about his dreams. They were

as he dragged Tony’s hips back and up, propping the little brunette up on all fours and then shaking his head– “No no, want you down like this.” –and pushing Tony’s forehead into the pillow.
“Oh.” Steve’s eyes widened, heart beat quickening at the offer. It was always up to an Omega parent to introduce a child, even in traditional relationships with an Alpha parent present it was
“Babydoll, it ain’t stalking when you’ve got a private investigator’s license.” Bucky was quick to argue, but then-- “But yeah. Yeah I’m gonna stalk him some.”
be explored further but for right now Tony needed to catch his breath, try not to think about how the plug was practically floating in his ass, the amount of spend making it shift liquid and nudge at his prostate with every breath and try to get some rest.
“ Yeah, I know why you don’t finish in me all the way.” Tony burrowed closer to Steve’s side, still snarky as shit but exhausted from being thoroughly taken care of by his always attentive but also always restrained lover. “Super soldier serum, super soldier cumshots. I know. You’re legitimately worried about drowning me during a blow job but I think you’re underestimating just how much I’d love to gag on you.”
Tony clung to the Alpha tight, hooked his bare leg around Steve’s waist and rolled in the blankets until Steve’s bulk was above him again and they were touching forehead to forehead clear down to where their feet tangled. Breath coming choppy, physically and mentally overwhelmed and happy enough to sweet his scent almost syrupy
“We were safe at home.” Tony’s voice was thready, his usual fire dampened by the Command and his eyes still downcast. “We were fine.”
“Your art studio on the third floor of your Brooklyn Heights brownstone?” the Omega waggled his eyebrows and hummed, “It's a hard knock life, for you. It's a hard knock life! For you!”
that Bucky nudged Tony and murmured, “See that? Two years ago he was yippe ki yaying out of planes and trains and automobiles. Now he turns into a Nervous Nellie if you’re out of his sight at all. It’s ridiculous, I love to see it.”
“Get!” Steve flung a handful of noodles at the Omega, who squealed and set the plates down on the counter, dashing for the living room with his wine glass held carefully with both hands. “Brat!”
“What the hell is this?” Tony frowned down at the app Clint had downloaded, then back up at the other Omega in confusion. “What’s
“Oh I can promise that will never happen.” Tony took a too quick sip of the scalding coffee. “It’s uh-- we were um--”
“Did they scare you?” Steve didn’t want to tell Tony what Bucky had said about one of them being too invested and the other one not being invested at all. “Because it’s okay if they did. Natasha is scary as shit.”
“And besides.” This time Steve opened the waffle maker and removed the food instead of risking something else burning when he reached out to hug Tony again. “We met on a Sugar Seeking Sugar app, Omega. Why should we start getting stereotypical and traditional now? If you want a wedding lets do a wedding, if not then we can elope. If you’d give me the honor of adopting Pete, I want to make that official as soon as possible, if not then just make sure I’m on his emergency contact forms for school. All I want is--”
And before Tony could try for an answer, Steve shook his head again and bent to lay a searing kiss at Tony’s lips, sealing their mouths together and stealing every molecule of air from Tony’s lungs before easing back with a low,
“It is smaller than your bedroom.” the Omega started slowly. “The only place I could find that would rent to me and a baby, I pay cash for it and the landlord leaves me alone so long as I’m never ever late and pay all the utilities. Most nights I move the table over in front of the door so no one tries to come in, we hear gun shots and the police are there all the time.”
, Omega.” Bucky made a concentrated effort to lower his voice, to ease the ready rumble burning up his throat. He was full on fucking
“I suppose I never did come here with you and your dear Mama.” Howard opened and closed his hands, expensive leather gloves flexing in the cold. “But now that I’ve retired from the board of directors and from most of the company responsibilities, I’ve begun walking this route every day for the exercise and for the--” he blew out a deep breath. “--for the nostalgia.”
Had it always been this bad? Had the one window always been permanently scratched and grimy, the bed sagging low in the middle and the dresser uneven on one of the legs? Was the bathroom really that small and had that huge crack in the kitchen counter always been there and
Steve was still laughing when Bucky left a while later, but once he was all alone in the empty brownstone, he picked up his phone and scrolled to the
“I uh--” Bucky turned in a slow circle, his massive frame dwarfing the tiny space as he took in everything about the studio apartment for a second time. “Tony, what the hell are
“Okay but here’s the thing about being chivalrous.” Tony ducked into the foyer and let Steve take his jacket-- which was actually the Alpha’s jacket. “If you being chivalrous means I have to stand out in the cold waiting for you to show up just so can walk me up a few steps, it’s not chivalrous, it’s inconvenient. And nobody has time for inconvenient chivalry.”
Tony’s head snapped up, eyes widening when Steve stopped, cleared his throat. “Anyway. I’ll leave you guys to get some sleep. You can lock the door if you want, and I’ll lock the front door so you feel secure up here. We can talk in the morning.”
“Well then please don’t look in my top drawer.” Steve deadpanned, and the sound of Tony’s laughter echoed through the brownstone as the Omega wiggled away and went upstairs to find some pajamas.
“That's right.” Steve brushed his fingers at the small of Tony's back to guide the Omega away from the stove so he could take over cooking again. “How's your wine? Need a refill yet?”
shaky and not quite coherent, the shocking intimacy of being with Steve, of being covered and held and touched like he was beautiful and precious and
“Hi baby.” All of Tony’s worries melted right away when he stepped into the apartment and Peter turned round to squeal at him. The toddler raised tiny fists in excitement, grinned wide enough to scrunch his little cheeks up around his eyes and waddled just as fast as he could to greet his Daddy. “Aw c’mere Bubba. C’mere and hug me.”
“Oh yeah, I’m drunk as hell.” Steve confirmed. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t mean it. They say you only get uninhibited when you drink, not that it changes you so you know-- you

because when he answered the call and it was Tony, Steve blurted, “Holy shit, Omega are you okay? Are you okay?”
Clint peered a little closer at the other Omega, clocking the barely hidden tears in Tony’s dark eyes and the stress clouding up his usual sweet scent. “Hey hey hey, what the hell happened?”
lap first.” the Beta decided. “Boy howdy, look at you! You’re so much higher quality than the last one we--ACK!”
“Yeah, sweetheart?” Steve’s eyes were still glued to the panties, his thumb hooked into the strip buried between Tony’s cheeks and tugging in a fully distracting rhythm, his other index finger skating at the rim of Tony’s entrance. “What is it, what do you need?”

“Yeah.” Steve nodded shortly. “He told me. I’m sorry you’ve ever had to do that, baby. And the apartment-- that’s why you never let me send anything to your house?”
Tony wet his lips and when the Alpha’s gaze dropped predictably down to watch, he wet them again because he was suddenly parched. “Yes?”
“You still technically kidnapped me.” The Omega pointed out flatly. “Still definitely broke into my apartment and
“Christ.” Steve dropped his hands in an instant, backed up several steps and cursed under his breath. “No, Tony don’t do that. Don’t do that, this was so stupid and now you’re making fun of me. I shouldn’t have even said anything.
Steve made a noise that was almost uncertain and Tony leaned back to meet the Alpha’s gaze, trusting his weight in Steve’s grip and clicking his tongue when he saw the flash of panic in the blue eyes. “I’m

“No--nothing.” It took a few tries for Steve’s voice to work. “I just had our evening sort of planned out and timed for dinner and everything but
“To be honest, I didn’t realize how crazy it seemed to have all these people in one room until you said something.” Steve looked around at his friends, his coworkers and squad members, the people that had had his back and literally saved his life more times than he could count. “I guess… it is a little crazy?”
“Maybe we can change the schedule after we know each other a bit better.” he offered, and that was only a
“No soda, and the next time I catch Clint sneaking to give it to you, I’ll take his giant ass down.” the Omega said firmly. “Apple or orange or some milk?”
“Congratulations, you’re a daddy!” Tony hurried over to the crib and turned back around holding the chunkiest, fluffiest golden retriever puppy Steve had ever seen, the fat little guy wearing a bright blue bonnet and blue sockies on his paws. “And
“I wasn’t sure I was even staying until just a few minutes ago.” Tony confessed. “I wore this outfit cos I thought you’d like it. You-- you don’t like it?”

“It’s the only way I could be in the running for the trophy for Best Dad!” Steve laughed out loud. “You’ve got everything else covered! Teachin’ Pete a bad word is the only
“You don’t wanna be alone with me.” The Alpha nodded as if that’s what he expected, broad shoulders slumping and frosted scent skittering uneasy. “Yeah, can’t blame ya for that. But um-- you know I never meant t’scare you, Tony. Never meant to stalk you or nothing like that. Tasha always calls what I do stalkin’ but I wasn’t
“Oh the hell we are.” Tony bumped into the crib when he backed up another step, keeping himself between the Alpha and Pete as if his slight weight would even register as a deterrent if Bucky decided to take Peter himself. “Get out of my house. Go on.”
Tony bit at him again, cutting his little fangs into Steve’s earlobe, into the Alpha’s neck and into the meat of the broad shoulders until Steve groaned and stuttered forward against him, the hand at Tony’s ass shoving up beneath the sweater to get to bare skin and nails raking down Tony’s back.
“I’ll see what I can do.” Tony threw his apron in the laundry and pulled out his phone to text Steve that he was coming home early. “Love you.”
“Alright look.” the big Alpha ran his fingers through his long hair, pushing it off his shoulders. “Look,
“Steve--!” A surprised gasp trailed off into exhilarated giggles when the Alpha practically attacked his neck, nuzzling and mouthing wet kisses down to the hollow of his throat and over to where the sweater fell off his shoulder and bared a smattering of freckles left over from long days in last summer’s sun. “Ah! Stop! That tickles!”
“What?” Steve chuckled at him. “I buy you diamonds and now you think I expect ‘bite to eat’ to involve some sort of
“Well so long as we’re being honest?” Clint tugged at his collar theatrically and waggled his eyebrows at Tony. “If your voice was a
Leaving Steve at the end of a date got more difficult every single time, whether they were saying goodbye at a restaurant or after a walk through a park or along the river, or whether Tony was still shivery and shaky and
“Uh yeah.” Tony sniffed, rubbing at his face. “Yeah Steve’s new personal project is a study in the way my eyes look at different times of the day.”
“I don’t ever have the time to just walk through the park or along the river anymore.” Tony risked a glance up at the Alpha, and the sight of Steve smiling for real, fangs showing and eyes crinkled in delight made his heart
.” Steve shoved his plate off his lap and hurried to Tony’s side, pulling him into the kitchen and corralling him into a careful hug. “Hi.”
“Huh.” Tony pointed at an apartment option and Steve bookmarked it. “Well, I  knew when I saw her this last time that I could trust her with Peter. Bucky too, but Nat first.”
“Yeah, it was real fun.” Tony smoothed down his apron and tried for a steady breath, in and out and telling himself to calm down because
“But for right now, let’s just stick with the two week schedule.” Tony couldn’t tell Steve that it killed him to be away from Peter even just for a couple of hours every two weeks. Their down time together was already so limited with Tony having to work so much that giving up one of his nights off to be

Tony just nodded, a hint of the normal spark in his dark eyes as he turned and rubbed gently at the baby’s back. “Would you like to meet him?”
“This old thing?” Tony winked, and started serving up heaping portions of meat and potatoes. “Figured it might be nice if I dressed up for my fella every once in a while. Two things a man needs coming home from a war-- a good meal and a good amount of loving, isn’t that right? Let’s start with a home cooked meal and see where the evening…”
“Ew, Clint.” Tony scrubbed dried milkshake off the nearby wall, a lovely left over from lunchtime when a toddler had thrown a full cup and her exhausted Mother had just mouthed ‘sorry’ and kept right on eating. “Just… ew.”
and it had been such a long time since Tony had enjoyed anything in life that the simple act of learning Steve's kitchen well enough to put dishes away kept him smiling. Steve had never had anything even
on the other hand had always had a habit of yeeting himself from the proverbial— and sometimes literal— plane and then of course
Instead Tony moved onto the messages from Peggy and Clint, scrolled through the all-caps texts and repeated demands for a call and finally texted to the group:
“Okay.” Bucky shrugged, nonplussed. “So invite him out tonight. We’re all here, it’d be nice to meet him. Invite him out.”
trying to be open about something difficult, Tony grabbed at Steve’s hands and made an immediate effort to be serious.
had been almost therapeutic. Peter’s giggles as he slapped paint all over the walls, the excited gasps about the different colors and the babbled questions about the different brushes and different sized paint bottles and canvases… it had all been beautiful. Tony had given Steve back his inspiration to paint but
This time the question wasn’t half as good natured, and Clint put the spatula away so he could grab at Tony’s wrist and pull him in close, looking the waiter over carefully to make sure one of the patrons hadn’t tried to get
“That opinion still stands.” Bucky straightened up and squinted at the painting again. “No, no I get this one. It’s like a river right? Deeper waters here and then lightening up here but it ain’t full purple or pink or light blue or whatever cos she might be healin’ from grief but it will always linger?”
“I’ll call you.” Tony smoothed his hands down Steve’s shirt and tried not to feel so devastated at his own self imposed curfew and rules that the Alpha always
“I lost my Mama when I was thirteen.” Tony dashed at tears on his cheeks and sniffed loudly. “Dad just disappeared, I never saw him after we buried her and then I went to college at fifteen. The next real conversation we had was when I told him I was pregnant and that only lasted long enough for him to cut me off and kick me out. I don’t
Peggy walked Tony out to the waiting Uber and after he’d tucked the small box of Peter’s extra blanket and a few more articles of his own clothing into the backseat, the Alpha grabbed him into another fierce hug, holding on tight to the young man she considered her
“...I see.” Howard seemed to crumple, his shoulders folding in in defeat. “Well do you walk this park often? Perhaps I will see you again and we--
“I feel like I never had trouble with that, but hey maybe Pete just adores me endlessly.” Clint winked, and was far too gratified when both Alphas visibly straightened and preened under the attention. “You going over for the Christmas decorating party? Tony said something about a twelve foot tree and Steve sent out an SOS about a wreath or a garland or something?”
and even though Tony waited with half a breath for the first wriggle of terror that had accompanied his last tryst with an Alpha, there was none to be found.
Tony poured himself a glass of wine while Steve had some juice and they sat together in the living room in comfortable silence for a while before the Alpha put his cup down and coaxed the Omega right up onto his lap in the recliner. He popped the footrest and stretched out with Tony nearly on top of him, a hand resting spread on Tony’s rear and their legs tangled as Tony snuggled close in over his heart and Steve rested his chin on the thick curls.
“I’m real glad to hear that, Tony.” Steve tugged at his collar. “I would have freaked out and ripped the tie off before hand if I’d known you would appreciate it.”
“Do you like it?” Steve grinned, all too pleased with the sight of the Omega poking around in his living room looking simply
He never painted commissioned pieces during this time of the day, these couple of hours where he didn’t need artificial light to see his canvas. Steve only ever worked on his personal projects, his
“You know it.” Bucky dropped an extra large box of the best pizza in town onto the side table in Steve’s artist loft and came over to drape himself over the other Alpha’s shoulder, cocking his head and eyeballing the painting Steve was working on. “Hey here’s a question--”
Tony had to stand on his toes to reach Steve’s bonding spot, and when he dug his fingers into the curve at the Alpha’s throat, Steve arched into the touch and growled pleadingly,
“You did just perfect, Pete.” Tony jostled the toddler, sighing over the waste but knowing Peter would be thrilled with their dinner. “Good job, bud. Go bring me your plate out of the bottom cupboard and sit up at the table.”
“So speaking of spending money on things you insist we don’t need but I tend to disagree about…” Steve started conversationally, and when Tony started to protest, the Alpha laughed, “Baby, this isn’t about the car, I promise. I agree with you, this is New York, no one really needs a car when there’s a thousand taxis and services to drive us around. It’s fine, I’ve moved past that.”
Bucky drummed his fingers at the dashboard for several minutes, trying to piece together all the new information into any sort of coherent narrative and wondering just how long he was gonna sit out there like a bonafide stalker before giving up and going home to his mate. Several people wandered in and out of the building as he waited, an old lady in a funny hat, a couple with their kid, someone who looked as if they hadn’t been sober in years and Bucky kept watching and wondering what Tony had in common with these people and why he lived at this place.
It was so much and Tony was quiet as he put each piece back in the box, quiet enough that Steve eventually cleared his throat, wiped his mouth and stammered, “I uh-- I know buying clothes for an Omega is a pretty possessive thing to do, especially those sort of things, the uh-- the intimate things. But I hope I didn’t cross some sort of line. I hope you’ll wear them anyway?”
Peter barreled into Tony and nearly knocked the Omega over, locked his arms tight around Tony’s neck and slobbered an enthusiastic kiss on his Daddy’s cheek. “Daddy! Miss you!”
“We wanna take ya to dinner then back to our place for the weekend.” Bucky said casually, far too casually for how wide Clint’s eyes got. “Last time we all hung out, me and Tash said we wanted to call you, so this is us calling you. You wanna come home with us tonight and stay the weekend?”
The tri-level brownstone along the promenade in Brooklyn Heights overlooked the tops of beautiful trees, the water, the Manhattan skyline in the distance and a park where dogs and children played. There was a state of the art kitchen and expertly arranged dining-parlor area that walked out into a porch and small, fenced yard on the first level, a well appointed master suite right out of a high end show room and two additional bedrooms with custom bathroom on the second level, and the third level was a beautifully sunlit loft meant to be an artists studio or children’s playroom or office.
, up the cleanly neutral tone walls were toddler sized hand prints and what looked like feet prints in every color imaginable, slapped up about as high as Peter could reach and stomped low at the base boards and leaching onto the throw rug. One of the easels had the legs snapped off so it sat on the floor, what might have been a drop cloth was piled in a corner and dotted with still fresh paint and oh--
Tony couldn't think past the way Steve's muscles shifted beneath his fingertips or the way the Alpha's rosewood scent layered hazy
Tony sucked in a sharp breath and Steve nodded, crooning out something adoring under his breath. “I want to mate you up
“You’re so wet for me.” The squelch of lube between their bodies was indecent, the scratch of Steve’s leg hair chafing at Tony’s rear over sensitive as they rocked together. “So wet, take me so well, gonna fill you right up, I swear to god.”
“I’m not the one who used a Command on that Omega’s best friend.” she sniffed. “Extra charming doesn’t even describe it. Remember how you won me over?”
Steve’s entire body surged, muscles straining and frame tense with the effort it took to obey his Omega without
.” Steve said just one more time, and dragged his hands down his face before turning to grab Tony in a hug too. “Omega, I’m so sorry about that. I didn’t think the whole pile would come down on him!”
The baby was out cold, mouth open and drooling, clutching tight at Steve’s shirt with one hand and every other limb limp in slumber and Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding when he found them messy, but safe and apparently happy to nap together, the sight doing something swoopy to his stomach and heart as he watched them sleep.
“Okay.” the Omega’s smile was watery, but the frayed edges of his chamomile scent eased as the comfort and truth from Peggy sank into his soul like warm balm. “Okay then. Let’s get to work.”
The praise made Tony arch up and purr and Steve braced himself over the Omega’s frame so he could yank at his zipper and push his pants down his legs. Tony felt thinner than Steve’s remembered, the Alpha’s hands seeming too large at Tony’s rib cage and the give of his stomach and
“Wow, we’ll have to have a big party for such a big boy!” Steve exclaimed, and Peter burst into immediate chatter about parties and balloons and how
between their bodies, vibrated through Tony's core and skittered through his veins like sparks popping behind his eyes. “You smell so good, sweetheart.”
“I’m gonna hold you to that.”  Steve swept Tony up close for a hug that went on and on and on. “I love you, Tony.”
The Omega hesitated, reluctant, and Clint prodded, “Tony. I get that this is all crazy and you’re nervous but hey-- has Steve
to enjoy. He had new earrings, Steve had quite literally come riding to his rescue and he could catch the online sales tonight and have everything shipped to the house, so the Omega wrinkled up his nose and flashed his little fangs flirtatiously, “Or is this a ‘bite to eat’ at your place?”
“Steve almost killed you.” Tony decided and Bucky was quick to agree, “Yeah but so what? I just wanted to get you here no matter what. It was the right decision, wasn’t it? Even if I went about it like an asshole?”
“Tony?” a knock at the bathroom door. “I’m not tryin’ to be weird about this, but you’ve been in here a while and I’m starting to worry I hurt you or should have stopped when you told me not to settle you--”
Tony was gorgeous like this, every tiny gasp and breathless whimper electric in Steve’s ears, the grasp and slide of fingers against sweat soaked skin and the
Bucky had insisted that Steve couldn’t take Tony out for burgers on the first date because starting a ‘sugar’ type of relationship came with certain expectations and those expectations meant
Tony wanted so badly to just be held right now, to be cuddled close and kissed and taken care of but he couldn’t ask for that when
and Bucky swallowed uncomfortably. “You’re my best friend, Stevie. I’m tired of seeing you miserable all the time. Tired of seeing you in this big house and no one to share it with. Tired of watchin’ you at your art shows wishin’ someone was there to be proud of you besides me and Tasha. And it’d be fine if ya didn’t want someone, but I
“Steve.” Tony opened the door and stood up on his toes to kiss the Alpha quickly, effectively silencing whatever the blond was going to say. “I’m fine.”
Tony’s nose wrinkled up at the teasing and Steve couldn’t resist ducking in to nuzzle their noses together. “Keep talking, sweetheart.”
“Don’t laugh.” Steve warned good naturedly. “I’m an artist so you know this is going to be dramatic.”
“Is that so hard to believe?” Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s hair. “I had almost fifteen years overseas, Tony. What sort of people did you think I worked with?”
Tony smiled to himself listening to Steve hum in the bathroom, smiled to himself when he heard the big blond wet a rag and then squeeze it out to test the water, and smiled to himself while closing his eyes and trying to come up with a Plan B to get Steve’s always starched bloomers a little relaxed.
Granted, Steve hadn’t been able to put full words together after they’d stopped kissing so maybe he’d missed some sort of indication that Tony
“I’m really not.” Steve pulled the napkin from his lap and tossed it on the table. “I’m sorry about this Tony, but I think I’m going to go. I’ll pay for the meal and your time and if you’d like dessert, you can order some and leave it on the tab, but I think I’m done.”
and the food was every bit as messy and delicious as Steve had promised and he couldn’t seem to stop eating. “Why are you so partial to it?”
“Well hell, a kiss from you is sweet enough to about stop my heart and give me the diabetes.” Steve teased right back and oh--
“I’m an Omega.” Tony spread his hands in an ‘obviously’ sort of motion. “And since Omegas are apparently incapable of living alone and because I have Pete, applying for those benefits would trigger a welfare check into my life and past, which of course would include my father.”
situations the state might be inclined to decide Peter would be better off adopted into a bonded family pair instead of struggling through life alongside Tony.
kissing the Alpha goodbye at Steve’s house. Their kisses lingered longer and longer, the texts on the drive home changed from simply checking in to continuing whichever conversation had been interrupted by curfew, and whenever Tony’s heart got a little carried away, whenever he started feeling uncertain about the arrangement and not sure if he was doing the right thing, the Omega pulled out his box of bills from beneath the bed and tapped each and every one of the paid stickers before recounting the steadily growing stack of money hidden in the bottom.
“Mr Carbonell.” Steve hooked an arm around Peter’s waist when the toddler got a little too excited and nearly fell over, but paused to wink at Tony. “I sure hope you do.”
making me feel like that, I just-- I can’t shake that feeling. We’re playing house but it can’t last, I shouldn’t get too comfortable in this life because it could all be taken away-- I’ve kept this job at this shitty place because since I’m not paying rent I’ve been able to stock away every penny of paycheck and tips because i can’t stop worrying about what we’ll do if Steve gets tired of us. Its like walking on eggshells. Something’s gotta give.”
defending Tony but full on growling, arms locked down at Tony’s waist to hold him close and snarling to warn the others away.
suffer through that Alpha buying you expensive clothes from some high end rich kid store? My god is your life tough.”
“Night night, Bubba.” Tony hit order on the app and set the notification to go to Peggy’s phone when it arrived. “Love you.”
“There’s a kid, Stevie.” Bucky nearly whispered, and watched his best friend’s face go very pale. “Tony’s got a kid. So you can’t march in there growly or even real intent on scooping that Omega up and carrying him away. You gotta calm down and be nice, alright?”
Steve flushed goofy under the pure sunshine of Tony’s smile, and stuttered through an overwhelmed, “Oh n-no sweetheart. This-- this isn’t a birthday present, this is just the stuff we bought last week. I gotta do something else for your birthday.”
delicate to bleed but Steve made him bleed anyway, scratched his fangs across the Omega’s heart until Tony arched into him and cried out for more, dug his nails into Tony’s hips as he helped his little mate shimmy out of the too tight pants and tossed them away, punched out a groan that was damn near a growl when he saw the Omega not even wearing panties. The seam of the tight pants were damp with slick, Tony’s slender length already leaking by the time Steve got his mouth over the sensitive tip and suckled and two fingers between the Omega’s thighs came away
“I-- I don’t know what you want me to say.” he finally said. “And I don’t know what you’re planning on doing but you’re stressing me out standing there so why don’t you leave and let us be?”
over Tony’s prostate, and the Omega tore at the sheets, nearly came off the bed crying out as his body gushed slick and tried to clench around the bump of Steve’s knot. “Yeah yeah yeah, that’s good, want to see you come first, come on. Can I touch you here?”
“Hey sweetheart, hey come here, I got you some water.” Strong arms and gentle hands gathered Tony up off the pillows, cradling him carefully before directing a water bottle to his lax lips, and Steve dotted sweet kisses all over his forehead before saying, “Drink a little bit so you don’t wake up all cotton mouthed.”
“I might have gone a little overboard.” Steve admitted, unashamed. “But I’ll be worse for his birthday and don’t even get me started on how out of control Christmas will be. I’m thirty five years old and never had a reason to go absolutely wild for the holidays. Buckle up, babe.”
Tony forced out a steadying breath. “I can’t talk about it yet. It was hard enough to be gone from my baby. Please don’t talk about my baby being gone from
than this, or if he wanted to cry because he’d worked so hard for so many long long days and these meager offerings of a few belongings still littered with the remainder of clearance tags and thrift store stickers was all he had to show for it.
“Then it will be the last time we see each other.” Tony snuggled the baby up close and rained kisses all over Peter’s cheeks, purring and trilling at the toddler until Peter clicked his tongue right back and left a slobbery kiss on Tony’s chin. “Because I will
...the phone message was forgotten in favor of cuddling with Peter, and across town in Brooklyn Heights, Steve kept staring at the note on his phone that said the message had been
Before Bucky could put together a full thought or even put words to the emotions-- sadness and sympathy and guilt-- crashing over him, a voice from behind him shouted, “Get away from my baby!” and in the next instant the Alpha was shoved hard enough to stumble back several steps as Tony raced forward in between them, popping his little fangs and snarling as he scooped the baby up into his arms and curled around him defensively.
Steve tried like hell to follow along but really just ended up listening with a smile while the baby talked and Tony stood at the door watching.
decided I couldn’t come home.” The Omega was quick to counter, and Steve so admired him for not even wavering. “
“How’d you sleep?” Steve interrupted, his lips moving at Tony’s temple as he budged a kiss at the Omega’s hairline. “Is the bed comfy?”

“You always do.” Tony rolled onto his side when Steve climbed back onto the mattress, inching close and pursing his lips for a kiss. “I was trying to take care of
Tony tried to sound sassy but knew it only came out breathless, “Mr. Rogers, I’m not sure I could walk to the bathroom if I wanted to.”
He paused, cocked his head as he put two and two together. “Your birthday must be at the end of the month. Tony, am I going to be here for your birthday?”
come up at some point, you can talk to me about it, yeah? No judgment here, babe. I just want you to be happy.”
with laughter, then shouted louder when the Alpha’s tongue fell hot at the front of his pants, mouthing along the jut of his covered cock. “Steve--!”
“Take this.” From behind the easel that was Tony’s painting, the Alpha pulled an envelope out and handed it over to Tony. “Keep it. Use it for whatever you want, for rent or savings or whatever, use it to party for your birthday, use it for anything that will give you some peace of mind and make sure you never have to call me crying again.”
“What was that for?” Tony pulled away laughing, dark eyes sparkling and fingers to his lips where they tingled against the press of fangs. “Family size toilet paper doin’ it for you?”
in a desperate sort of way. Spring was beautiful in New York and he wanted to take Tony up into the hills to watch the trees green up and the first flowers bloom, he wanted to spend a night taking pictures of the Omega and then painting them into scenes, he wanted to spend an entire weekend-- and entire week-- on vacation with Tony getting to know the Omega
a decent Alpha’s time had the Omega ready to cry but he couldn’t do that, not here and not in front of Steve. The Alpha was so old fashioned he’d immediately assume the worst and Tony knew he’d crumble if Steve asked
“I don’t do any of that.” Steve looked honest to god confused and even a little horrified. “Why would I watch dirty movies or touch myself when you aren’t there? That’s--that’s-- No! I wouldn’t do that! I mean, sheesh Tony, doesn’t that feel like cheating to you?!”
It was just after seven pm when Tony finally discarded his apron into the bin and wrapped up a few left overs at the end of his shift. The Omega stood on his toes to kiss Clint right on the lips then slipped out of the diner, the smile on his face falling away into a wince the second he hit the sidewalk.
Steve made a punched out sounding noise, and Tony lifted one shoulder in as casual shrug as he could manage, “–and I also read that multiple orgasms can increase our chances as well, so we might have to go more than once.”
about it, and Tony’s mouth parted in surprise. “Did you really think it would matter to me where you lived or worked? Even from just a sugar relationship point of view, it wouldn’t have mattered beyond maybe me upping your allowance to make sure you could get into something better, but you and I are-- we are--”
for Bucky not to fight, but he forced himself calm and met his friend’s gaze steady. “I’m sorry bud, I am. I’m sorry about a whole lot of things from today. But you gotta deal with me later, cos Tony needs ya now and you’re raging and red eyed and he can’t handle that. Calm down and be nice to the Omega, alright?”
“Jesus.” Tony kept rubbing slow circles at Clint’s nape until Clint’s breathing evened out and he was practically boneless there in the booth. Then he eased off little by little so the blond wouldn’t be left a drooling, barely coherent mess stuck unable to get home after his shift. “We’ll figure it out, Clint.”
“Oh good Lord.” Tony’s face burned in embarrassment. “I um-- yes, when I bought this shirt, I ran through the intimates section and picked something out without holes in it.”
“...thank you.” Steve pressed his finger tips to the same spot Tony had touched, watching the Omega closely for any sign that the proximity had affected Tony like it had affected him, nostrils flaring trying to scent anything apple blossom
It was absolutely crossing at least a thousand different lines to step foot in that apartment, but Bucky couldn’t seem to stop himself and what the Alpha found inside made his insides swoop with what felt like suffocating
Steve had no way of knowing that all twenty six text messages and phone calls he sent to Tony while he was racing back to his house went unnoticed thanks to Tony’s phone still being in Bucky’s coat pocket, but by the time he made it to the brownstone he was breathing hard, eyes red with worry and scent skittering uneasy when he saw the haphazard way Bucky’s car was parked as if the other Alpha had been in just as much of a panic to get to the house.
“C’mere.” Tony might not like to be settled, but it was still ingrained in his biology to want to be settled and to know
“Well one day, I’d be happy to take the beach and watch you mermaid it up from a safe distance of ten yards inland, while wearing full protective flotation gear.” Steve said blandly. “Hell I’ll even take you to a pool, but I’ll have to watch from the hotel room as you splash around. I’m telling you, I get within five feet of water and I just start
of all, it’s not that hard to get a fake ID, give me a break. Go ask the guy in booth three. And third– and I can’t stress this enough– just don’t tell them you have a kid. Make it so you’re only available a few days a week and never overnight, no trips out of town, that sort of thing. It’s not that big of a deal.”
.” Steve really did almost collapse when Tony palmed over his cock, squeezing purposefully over the thick length. “
“Let’s make a quick agreement to never use that word or the one to describe me in a real sentence, huh?” Steve suggested, and Tony made a quickly relieved noise of agreement. “And for the record
“On that note, I’m going to go have a chat with the manager.” Steve eased back from the hug and ran his hands down Tony’s arms gently. “You go pick out something else you like and we’ll get this taken care of, okay?”
urging him into action whether he wanted to or not, Tony stumbled trying to hold onto it all as he lurched for the crib to get the toddler.
. Tony hid his face in his hands for a moment while he tried to piece together what he could barely believe. “Steve, are you sure? Because this-- we are-- I mean, we are fine where we are. This is a lot, you are offering a

painting day. A huge roll of paper, washable paint because this stuff would take some scrubbing, thicker brushes for less coordinated, little fingers, a child sized smock because Peter would be ridiculously cute in a painters get up and maybe even--
the entire world looks at me and tells me I’m not enough, that I’m nobody because instead of continuing to be that person, I wanted to keep Pete, I refused to give him up and decided to do it by myself. My life is working at a shitty diner and dealing with hostility and disrespect from almost every person I meet, having to
“It’s fine.” he repeated softly and Steve muttered another curse before kissing his temple and easing away.
, curving those big shoulders in around Tony's little frame and when  Tony's knees automatically opened, the Alpha pressed in closer, drove the kiss deeper until Tony open mouth
“I’m here.” Steve jumped down the last several steps and skidded his way back to Tony. The Omega was still sprawled on the floor, shirt up by his waist and dark red panties on full display, one knee bent and the other leg stretched out invitingly like Tony was making

house and Tony and Peter were only staying. It was Steve’s kitchen and the Omega was very careful to remember where everything went so he could empty the dishwasher or clear the strainer. It was Steve’s guest bathroom so Tony was very careful to keep their toiletries in the mirrored cupboard and off the counter, to keep their towels dry and neatly arranged and to wipe down the bath and shower every time they used it.
a Blu-ray player to watch them. A gorgeous, heavy knit scarf in the prettiest green Tony had ever seen to ward off the evening chill, and then a matching scarf and set of gloves in a shade of crimson red that Tony imagined matched the aura of Steve’s cedar scent.
“Oh my god you’re beautiful.” The Alpha wanted to taste his way down every inch of Tony’s body, count the Omega’s ribs with dotted kisses and growl into the give of Tony’s navel. He wanted to tear the leggings off and bury his face between the pillow soft thighs and
Close to eight weeks later, the Brooklyn apartment had been designated as the Friday night date night spot for Steve and Tony, a place to escape the world and their responsibilities and to disconnect entirely from what it meant to be an Avenger.
“I was really really scared.” Tony continued, and Bucky nodded quickly. “What you did was really shitty but I believe you were trying. Steve says you have good intentions but the subtlety of a tank and um-- well, my life is pretty good right now and I guess in a way I have you to thank for that.”
delicious served over meatballs and a generous sized portion of noodles, then slathered in parmesan cheese.
“Bucky.” Steve stopped and pinched at his nose, counting to ten so his eyes weren’t red when he turned to glare at the other Alpha. “Stop talking or I’ll kill you.”
“Tony.” Steve nodded jerkily and tried to salvage the conversation in a sugar daddy appropriate sort of way...whatever that meant. “So. I’m sure you had dozens of matches and messages before you and I linked, hm?”
money amount, maybe enough to do one nice shopping trip a month and eat out several times. It certainly wasn’t enough for rent anywhere outside Tony’s slummy apartment complex, it wouldn’t even touch the rent on an apartment anywhere close to where Steve lived, but it was an amount Tony stressed over every damn day.
…the door swung open to a bedroom filled with candles and rose petals, to Tony already lying reclined on the bed with his hair rumpled and eyes sultry soft and Steve didn’t know what he had been expected his boyfriend to be in– maybe the dress again, maybe a sexy pair of boxers or that one silky robe Tony wore when he was feeling dramatic.
Another flash of alarm over the Omega’s delicate features. “You saw us? That’s-- that’s Peggy, she lives here in the building. She watches Pete for me while I’m working or while I’m um-- with Steve.”
“Yeah yeah yeah, I got you.” A calloused palm circled round Tony’s cock, swept through the pre-come leaking at the head and used it to smooth the way down into firm, fast jerks, matched in time with the thrust of Steve’s tongue into Tony’s ass and the scrape of his teeth across sensitive sensitive skin that had Tony keening, writhing, fucking forward into the too tight hold. “That’s right beauty, gonna make you come so hard, want to hear you screaming for me, come on.”
distracting to watch Tony eat, the cut of little fangs into the meat, the pretty mouth stretching over the burger and lips shiny with oil, the motion of the Omega’s throat as he swallowed…
“I’ve missed you too.” Tony rubbed his nose at Steve’s heart, breathing in the settling scent of his Alpha and sandalwood soap and
“Captain Rogers, I could say quite the same thing about you.” Tony laughed softly when Steve moved to mouth down his throat, tipping his head back to allow the big blond access. “I appreciate the hell out of you in that uniform, but you really do clean up sort of ridiculously--”
“All these clothes.” Bucky inclined his head towards Peter’s clothing. “You bought them with the money Steve gives you?”
“Are you still going to punch him?” Tony wanted to know. “Cos Clint’s still pretty set on knee capping Bucky and breaking his nose.”
“You start storing rocks in your pocket for Pete and you’ll end up with more than you think.” Tony warned, but the Alpha only scoffed, “I’m a big Alpha, sweetheart. I can handle a few rocks.”
“Oh love, you had to return a gift from that Alpha so afford clothes for Pete?” She murmured, sad that their financial situation was so bad Tony felt like he couldn’t even accept
“It was well used, even though I hate you for it.” Tony pushed away so he could collect his next order as the plates came up. “And I’m not
“Can I ask you--” Steve scratched at his head uncertainly. “What about government programs or anything like that. There’s gotta be things set up to help Omegas in your position? I remember a time when my parents had food stamps was that-- was that not an option for you back then? Or now?”
“Everyone knows what it means.” Clint mumbled, and Tony couldn’t help but smile. “Go on then, give me the good details.”
“For deciding to stay.” Steve whispered, voice gone deep and hoarse. “For deciding we could do this. I know your mind wasn’t real made up until just the other night and I’m so glad you want to be here with me. Glad the
“Hello, darling.” Peggy whispered when Tony crept in to pick Peter up at close to eight thirty pm. “How was your date?”
Tony didn’t know the answer to a whole lot of anything just now. He didn’t know how to feel about Bucky dumping them here at Steve’s place, how he felt about the lingering tension of the Command buzzing at the base of his skull, or how he felt about Steve
“I’m not trying to say I’m ungrateful for you being generous.” The Omega said quickly, not sure why Steve had gone so quiet and trying to do damage control before-- before-- well he didn’t know what the
“Some of them are doubles.” the Alpha admitted when Tony held up two identical shirts in confusion. “I liked the color too much to just buy one. Take one home, keep one here.”
“Well I’m sorry for the time you weren’t okay.” the Alpha murmured. “Sorry for scarin’ your baby and making you mad. Even if it all turned out okay, I’m still sorry.”
“You need to get laid.” Bucky stated it so matter of factly, Steve wasn’t sure he’d even heard him correctly, but then Bucky elaborated, “Hell, all the famous artists were slutty, Steve. It helps the creative process. Gets the proverbial
The Omega stood up on his toes for a real kiss, and Steve groaned softly when their lips met again and again, the delicate points of Tony’s fangs teasing at his tongue. “I’m so glad you’re here, sweetheart. I’m so glad you decided to stay.”
Both of Tony’s wrists fit into one of Steve’s hands and they both moaned when Steve shoved Tony’s hands up towards the pillow and pinned them there, the motion stretching the Captain’s body far over Tony’s back and bumping his cock against the swollen hole.
Their whole lives had happened in this one room and Tony was stunned to stillness, to silence, to misery. The Omega wasn’t sure if he wanted to cry because Peter deserved so much
“Echo! Echo! Echo!” A voice from downstairs made Steve stop mid brush-stroke and smile knowingly. “Is there anyone here! Anyone in this mausoleum at all! Any ghosties I definitely shouldn’t piss off by putting greasy ass pizza on this unnecessarily white couch? Honestly don’t know why a fella would have a white couch! Seems’ta me nothing good can happen on pure white couches cos of stain issues! Seems like a boring ghost must live here!”
“Steve.” Peter was coughing harder and Tony’s anxiety ratcheted up a few notches. “Aren’t you worried about me just going crazy and buying stupid things on your card?”
to the pressure of Steve’s hand at the nape of his neck. Strong fingers drew firm circles against the sensitive skin and the Omega purred low and endlessly content, eyes hazy with bliss and tension leeching from his muscles one by one until he was liquid in the Alpha’s arms.
Tony started laughing because he couldn’t help himself, shoulders shaking and face hidden in Steve’s shirt as he giggled. “
“Right.” Tony ducked his head, taking another drink of coffee so he wouldn’t have to look at Steve just then, not sure he could handle it without breaking down over the Alpha’s endless generosity. “Right, I think I already knew that.”
Tony didn’t have the heart to tell Steve he’d wanted to refund the piece and use the money at a clearance sale for kids winter clothing, and only nodded instead. “Okay. Thanks.”
“Give me a minute?” Tony asked instead, and a flicker of worry was there and gone in Steve’s eyes before he nodded, “Yeah Tony, just come out whenever you’re ready.”
“I ordered the belts based on the pant size.” the Alpha clarified. “But if the waist needs taken in on the jeans, you’ll probably need different belts, too. Just let me know.”
There weren’t enough words for the rush of relief that left Tony weak kneed and clutching at Steve’s arms for balance, and when the Alpha kissed him again Tony kissed him right back, holding on tight and trying to convince himself that this was really

“God, if it weren’t so true, I’d be jealous of them.” Bucky had one more kiss for the love of his life, then asked,. “I’m gonna hafta be really extra charming to win Clint over, ain’t I?”
“Actually?” Tony stirred the few ice cubes left in his mostly lukewarm drink as he wondered just how much to tell his nosy friend. “...yes. Yes I did.”
through Tony’s skin. He groaned louder when Tony whined and bucked away from the pressure, belly growing taut with the amount of spend pumping into him, and when Tony whimpered and tried to wriggle away Steve checked– “Safe word?”
“I’ll tell you the whole story some other time.” the Omega said dismissively, and Steve took it as the hint it was and changed the subject.
He gestured around the loft, then further around to encompass the entire house. “-- big empty houses with no pictures on the wall and enough echoes to make ghost hunters anxious. I mean
“That’s almost verbatim what your mate asked me.” Tony kept a little distance between himself and the big Alpha, leaning against the hallway door and folding his arms tight over his body. He believed Steve when the blond insisted Bucky had only the best intentions, right in his heart the Omega believed the Command had been used in a moment of panic as Bucky tried to rectify a situation he hadn’t really understood or even expected.
“Well I’m here now.” The Alpha reached over to link their fingers together. “I believe you about not needing to be rescued, you were handling this just fine on your own even though the whole damn world was against you. But I’m here
It was maybe a little harsh, but Tony wasn’t going to take it back. Steve was a nice Alpha but Tony wasn’t going to take any chances.
“Ask Carol if you can borrow at least a shirt, she’s about your size.” Clint lifted his head enough to whistle at one of the still-on-duty waitresses and waved her over. “Her clothes will be tight across the chest, but you got that vintage lace scarf you found at the thrift store, right? Leave the blouse open, tuck the scarf in, nothing says ‘you’ll have to work for a kiss’ like covering up with lace.”
that had come from Steve’s mouth during sex to argue about his hips being up. He didn’t have the will or strength to argue when Steve skipped the usual clean up and instead curled up with his head on Tony’s chest, and when Steve also spread his fingers protectively overly Tony’s swollen stomach…
-- handle another call from you where you’re crying worried about just making it till the next day. I can’t do that.”
“Look!” The Alpha’s smile was just as big as Peter’s as he crammed the box on the bottom rail of the cart. “It blows up like an air mattress! Comes with two hundred balls! And it holds six kids!”
The Omega’s smile spread wider and Steve breathed out a sigh of relief. “Damn it’s good to see you smile, Tony. You scent easier too. Feeling better?”
“It’s better than all the things I thought you might say.” The Omega relaxed a fraction, his scent easing a notch. “And trust me, I’ve sat here and sat a lot about all the things you might say when you came through that door. Telling me I’m pretty wasn’t-- wasn’t on the list.”
Big hands at Tony’s thighs and the Omega gasped a little when he was bodily dragged right onto Steve’s lap. He scrambled to unfold his legs so he could straddle the Alpha’s thighs but the world went abruptly topsy turvy
made the Omega feel like he was abandoning his baby, made Tony sick to his stomach with guilt over enjoying time with Steve when he should be home cleaning or something.

The conversation between Alpha and Omega lagged as they waited for the food to come. Steve didn’t know how to have a conversation when he was
“Mmmm.” The Omega nodded tiredly. “Barney’s been a real dick lately, talkin’ bout kicking me out if he and this new Beta girl wanna live together. I’m stressed as hell.”
He sighed, rubbing at his face tiredly. “I was seventeen, Steve. It was my first real heat, I was pretty certain I had the world figured out so when some hot bodied Alpha offered to spend my heat with me, I took him up on it without considering anything else. I couldn’t even tell you his last name and honestly, his first name doesn’t matter much either.”
“You-- you smell good too.” Tony turned his nose enough to scent at Steve too, breathing in the already familiar scent of rosewood and heady pine that had lingered at the back of his throat all week long, every time he wore the Alpha's jacket. His fingers swept up to land in Steve's hair as the Alpha murmured something else hoarse and
“It’s not just that.” Tony scratched at his throat again, then hesitated and reached back beneath the collar of the shirt to the nape of his neck. “The Alpha I shared my heat with, he uh-- well he settled me to the point of me not even being able to
off the Omega’s skin. “I know, sweetheart, I’m not going to knot you, just want to be close to you, gotta get closer to you.”
classic hot rod that had been a sweet sixteen present from his father, the almost eighty year old roadster painted in a shade of red so gorgeous it had nearly made him cry. He’d only driven her three times before everything had gone to hell and Howard had kicked him out, and he let himself wonder only for a
Tony’s heart caught up in his chest when he finally spotted the culprit of all the mess asleep on the couch. There was Steve stretched out on the well worn cushions, paint on his face and over his knuckles and all over his once white button up, and cuddled on his chest snoring lightly and looking as sleepily content as he’d ever been was Peter with paint in his curls, on his cheekies and all over his little fingers.
when the blond stared bloody scarlet at him, fangs out and threatening, entire frame vibrating with the effort of restraint as Steve leaned in closer and growled
direction, and while Tony hated the idea of walking several blocks in his barely warm coat, the idea of Steve seeing his address on the shitty end of town or seeing the charge on his card for a long ride was somehow worse. “Actually I was just going to--”
that had happened last time, Howard was at his core a businessman, a Stark, and manners were hard wired into his every action with a stranger so he forced a cordial smile that carefully covered fangs and held his hand out for Steve.
“Omega, I--” Bucky swore under his breath, then swore again when the curse made Tony jump. “Sorry. Shit. Listen, I dunno what I expected t’find when I saw ya outside that hotel and now again at the diner but you gotta believe me, I was just tryna make sure you weren’t gonna fuck my best friend up. Steve straight up loves you and I wasn’t gonna stand there and let you hurt him. I had no idea about--”
, clad in a low heeled pumps and nylons, a simple belted dress with a gathered skirt and buttons down his chest, dark hair fluffed up in curls and a smear of red lipstick highlighting his lips, apron tied tight around his little waist and Steve’s dog tags glinting
The baby started crying and Tony immediately tried to hush him, the Omega clicking his tongue and crooning, “Shh shh baby baby. S’okay. Daddy’s got you. It’s okay Pete, what a rough way to wake up from a nap, huh? What a rough way for such a pretty baby to wake up from a nap. S’okay. We’re okay.”
was another mystery to add in to the whole mess. Sure, Bucky was relieved to hear there were real feelings from Tony’s side, but if Tony was in love with Steve, then what the fuck was going on with all these
“Whoever told you that lied to you.” Clint said flatly. “Nobody wants reservations here and you shouldn’t either. Also it’s only me and one other waiter today so we don’t have enough people to handle a group. Do your friends and me a favor and go somewhere else.”
The park was beautiful, even at the start of winter. The leaves had long fallen off the aspens, the apple trees past their harvest and bare, but the evergreens were full and lush and scenting like sweet pine, lining the perimeter of the park and bringing bright bursts of color to the faded grass and the gray water of the partly frozen creek.
part and Steve didn’t understand that, but he pressed on, “Tony, whether we are an arrangement or not, whether we met on an app and you have an allowance or not-- none of that matters. You are my muse, you are my
“Alpha, little boys are practically feral.” Tony clicked his tongue comfortingly when Steve’s face creased distressed. “You know that, I know that. Pete’s finally got the chance to act a little wild and not have to worry about being too loud or breaking anything and that’s-- that’s okay. Boys will be boys right? Right up to nearly dying beneath giant teddy bears.”
“That’s alright.” Two eggs cracked into the mix in quick succession. “We’ll get there. Sweetheart, I’ve got fresh coffee and that creamer you like, I went out early this morning and picked some up since we used the last of it last time you were here before my trip.”
sized anything was well worth the way Tony smiled up at him. “God, you’re beautiful right now. Let’s put Pete to bed then I’ve got something I wanna talk to you about.”
There were twenty six missed calls and messages from Steve and he ignored them, not sure he could take the emotional upheaval of the voicemails and text messages wondering what was wrong and what had happened. The last thing he needed while feeling so fragile was to hear what was no doubt an increasingly panicked Alpha on the phone.
“You are acting delightfully smitten.” Tony teased as if his heart weren’t pounding and his entire soul wasn’t
“That’s your version of getting some sugar, Mr. Rogers?” Tony’s apple blossom scent lightened in surprise and joy. “A
He pressed into Tony slow, and Tony hissed through clenched teeth and clutched hard at Steve’s shoulders as he opened steady around the Alpha’s size. He tossed his head back and gasped out loud, rim burning as the Alpha sank inch by inch into his core, the wider base filling him almost painfully full, the bulk of the already swelling knot at his rear making the part of Tony that echoed
“Are you alright?” Steve lowered his voice another notch, crooning comfortingly until Tony quit staring at the floor and finally peeked up at him. “Sweetheart what happened, what’s going on? What are you even doing here?”
“It wasn’t fun.” Tony swallowed, thinking about long nights at dangerous shelters and being turned away from religious organizations because he wasn’t interested in adoption and
The very second Steve strode into the jewelry store, the manager hurried over to greet him, shaking his hand and chattering excitedly and apologetically for this entire ordeal and for having to interrupt him so late in the day and how she desperately hoped this incident wouldn’t cause him to take his business elsewhere--
“Pete!” Tony abandoned the cart and sprinted towards the disaster, Steve over took him in a few steps and started pitching animals left and right trying to get down to Peter.
When they made it back into the living room to join every one else, Steve looked up from chatting with Peggy with so much
“Thank you, beauty.” Steve wanted nothing more than to fit back between Tony's knees and dig his fangs into Tony's scent glands, to wrap one big hand around the nape of the Omega's neck and bring Tony down settled because he knew-- he
No matter how badly he honestly wanted to see Steve, no matter how often he was tempted to stay over when the Alpha offered, no matter how much he’d like to curl up on that soft bed in the Brooklyn Heights Brownstone and sleep the rest of his
“Oh yeah?” Tony glanced around the room with renewed interest. “So the bookshelf with the unreadable books, the buffet with generic landscape pictures, the white couch and coordinating easy chairs-- what, it's all page forty seven from a furniture catalog?”
me. You feel skinny though, have you been eating? Are you hungry? Let me make you a plate and get you some food and--”
“Oh yes please.” Steve had made enough pasta to feed a small army, which wasn't really the Alpha's fault, it was hard to eyeball dry noodle servings and Tony was grateful for the extra that would be dinner for him and Pete for the next few nights. “But I was serious about the garlic bread so--
“You um--” Tony was trembling, nearly shaking, but he leaned further into Steve’s hold and managed, “Alpha, you’ve told me plenty of times how much you love me, even-- even if you’ve never outright said the words. I already knew. I-- I did.”
. What do you get out of it? Because you have given me not just my allowance but a lot of additional money lately, and you’ve bought me all these clothes and the-- the wine and everything else… what do
“Gamma Peggy!” Peter wriggled away from Natasha and raced after Peggy to meet her at the stairs, and Peggy waved off Tony’s attempt to take him back.
part of his life, and when he’d looked the watch up and saw that it cost the equivalent of a month’s rent, he’d nearly choked. It wasn’t a lot of money for Steve, but it would buy Pete an entire wardrobe for next year if Tony could hit the right clearance sales and damn it, Tony was a
creepy over the phone. Based on the location and current clientele alone, Bucky had to assume anyone who tried to flirt with either of the Omega waiters was full on trying to be gross about it and he certainly didn’t fault the Omega for hanging up.
“No, I was planning on taking a couple chairs up to the roof and watching the fireworks over the water with you and Pete.” Steve not subtly plucked the lollipop back from the display and tossed it in his cart along with everything else unnecessary. “Or if you want we can go into the city and get a hotel room, go to a couple of the events?”
He pointed towards the radio. “–that’s my favorite song playing on the same sort of radio that my Ma had in our living room, and you’re here wearing the kind of pretty things a fella could only
A work emergency sounded plausible, but Tony could barely hold it together long enough to ask the Uber driver to wait while they ran into CVS, and he knew talking to Steve would trigger a breakdown.
“Okay but seriously.” Natasha’s hair had been in a smooth bun at one point, her shirt clean of mashed potatoes at another point, but neither was the case now. “How does Tony do this as a single dad? How did he do this?”
watching the play of pleasure and open desire over Tony’s gorgeous features. He waited as long as he could before finishing as well, rutting into Tony’s body and winging the Omega’s release out as long as could until the echo of
to approach the dog, and the Alpha panted an apologetic, “Sorry about that. I don’t know if Pete’s ever seen a dog up close, he wouldn’t know to slow down and ask about petting first.”
“Tash.” Just like Tony somehow knew he would, Peter settled tight into Tasha’s arms entirely nonplussed by the aura of
“Shouldn’t take me long, I already picked it out.” he bent to rub their noses together. “I’ll go kiss Pete bye and call a car. See you tonight?”
“As ready as I’ll ever be.” The Omega surprised himself with just how reluctant he was to let go of Steve and meet everyone else. A stressful month apart had dulled Tony’s memory of how solid Steve was, how gorgeous those blue eyes and fanged smile and vibrating rumble was and the longer they held each other, the longer Tony thought maybe he
, you’d feel better about this whole situation.” She countered softly. “And maybe you wouldn’t be so stressed all the time.”
The fourth box was accessories, two pair of sunglasses, a new wallet. There was a new watch in a practical, simple design, a new case for his phone, just one tie that matched each of the new button ups and a two belts, one in black and one in dark brown.
. Not to work, not just hanging out, maybe out to dinner with you but since we’ve started cooking at your place or eating from food trucks when we take a walk, that doesn’t make sense either. I just didn’t need it and it didn’t really fit my life, so I was going to return it and get something else. I didn’t want to tell you because I didn’t want to seem ungrateful and it-- it’s usually easier to ask forgiveness versus permission.”
for an Omega, well over six feet tall and strong enough to throw most Alphas right out on their ass. Tony’s fangs were delicate like cut porcelain but Clint’s were long enough to be seriously threatening and they glinted
“You started walkin’ down the street in the dark and my first thought was to yank you into the car so Steve wouldn’t be mad I let ya walk alone in that place.” he admitted. “In retrospect, good thing I didn’t. Adding kidnapping to breaking into your apartment…”
Even with this being more of an arrangement and less of a relationship, making Tony this particular meal tonight just felt
“Can I leave break these?” he half pleaded and Tony bit at him in response, driving his fangs into Steve’s pulse point until the Alpha groaned, throbbed spilling at his thigh as he wrenched at the thong and snapped it with a quick jerk. “Oh oh oh fu--fuck Tony, bite me again.”
“Uh huh, on one side of that big ol’ bed you have yet to share with anyone?” Bucky raised highly judgmental eyebrows. “Sounds real homey and definitely like productive, healthy mental reasoning and not at all like you’re avoidin’ intimacy while being’ scared t’death of dyin’ alone and failing at painting visual representations of grief.”
“And I know we’ve more or less said these sort of things before, but it’s probably high time I just come out and say them for sure.” Steve cleared his throat and cupped Tony’s chin, smoothing his thumb over the hollow of Tony’s cheek and along the line of his jaw. “Pretty Omega, I forgot we were supposed to have an arrangement by the end of the first date, alright? By the end of the second date and all I could think about was seeing you again. By the time we actually spent the night together, I was
Clint was working a double Friday night and even though Peggy would have been more than willing to cancel her sewing circle plans with a few friends, Tony told her it would be fine, that she should have fun with her friends.
“I mean, he probably did.” Clint peeked around the corner. “My voice tends to carry. The whole diner knows you’ve turned into a Frosty Frieda since moving in with your sugar daddy and trust me, the whole diner disapproves.”
“How many nights have you fed me and Pete?” Tony couldn’t hardly keep his eyes open anymore, but he clicked the grocery store app on his phone and started an order before he got too tired to remember. “How many days did you cook dinner and give me half when you knew I hadn’t gotten a meal at work? Me and Pete wouldn’t have survived without you, I owe you a lot more than groceries.”
“Steve was actually the one to put the brakes on.” Tony finally got the worst of the milkshake off and moved on to another unfortunately unidentifiable stain. “He wants to wait until we talk through boundaries, which I appreciate seeing as how--” he blew out a short breath. “--I was almost sick to my stomach thinking about attempting sex after the
So why an Alpha with no mate, no children, no pets had moved into the space and was letting all but a few rooms sit empty and unused was a mystery to everyone on the block--
never failed to make the Alpha melt, and thoughts of roleplay and skirts vanished when Steve held out his arms for Peter and cuddled him close. “But uh-- you know, it’s getting cold out. How about we get come hot chocolate, get a ride home and get in our jammies, huh?”
wishing he could ignore the feeling that Tony wasn’t telling him the truth but unable to let it go. “Tony um… are you sure you’re okay?”
“I know I know.” the big Omega relented. “You’re a Dad first, I get it. So how was staying the night with Daddy Warbucks?”
“Right. Salad and fruit.” Steve closed his eyes again and muttered a curse. “I swear I’m not usually this awkward.”
, Tony couldn’t seem to stop shaking and after laying a tender tender kiss on his little mate’s forehead, Steve brought his fingers to the nape of Tony’s neck and asked,
“Yes sir.” She checked her notebook. “I have you staying the night tonight in one of our one bedroom suites, it has already been paid for and includes a late check out tomorrow afternoon.”
Dessert had been milkshakes shared while they walked through the park, stopping to kiss underneath the stoplights and check text message updates from Bucky and Natasha about Peter. Tony hadn’t expected Steve to book a room in the expensive hotel so when the car dropped them off at the front, he turned with wide eyes and the Alpha just kissed the look away and urged his soon-to-be mate up the stairs and into the lobby.
