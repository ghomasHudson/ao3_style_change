Steve nodded, not wanting to explain his reasons at the moment. He had a feeling of dread come over him. "Did you want it back?" He asked sadly as he looked back up at Tony. He saw Tony's expression had softened, and there was something in his eyes Steve couldn't explain.
“Keep making those wonderful sounds Tony, I want to hear everything.” Steve said huskily as he slipped Tony out of the dress and tossed it across the room. “Don’t think I’m leaving you out of this.”
After getting the horses back in the stables, Steve, Tony, and the council head to the meeting room.
That’s when Tony decides to take matters into his own hands. He looked around the room and found an excellent sword and made his way to the stables. When he arrives, Tony finds a horse that is currently tied up, gets a saddle on the horse, climbs on, and rides off to go help Steve.
Tony nodded and tried shifting into his human form to go to sleep but for some reason...he couldn’t shift back. He let out some whines to let Steve know something is wrong.
“Uh...Steve, how will everything you said go?” Anthony asked as he stared at the butterfly still on his finger before looking at Steve.
After I finish this fic, I'll be working on my next fic project and school. See you guys in the next chapter. Enjoy!
Both of them were traveling in the quiet forest. There wasn’t any noise except for the hooves of the horse trotting through the forest. The weather around them was a peaceful low morning fog. The trees around them were full and a beautiful green color. There were also some animals they saw and heard like the beautiful sound of birds chirping and squirrels chattering.
‘What a clown. Why doesn’t he retire already?” Harley said as he watched the video with his coach, Nick Fury, yelling at him.
Emmie: The pups are coming in this chapter guys, be ready for some fluffy cuteness. Warning: this chapter does describe the graphic birth of the pups so if you get grossed out, skip to the end.
Emmie: Hope you guys are liking how the fic is progressing so far, be ready because there’s more to come.
After they all make their way outside, Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy stripped down before shifting into their wolf forms. Rhodey, in his wolf form, was a charcoal grey color that was just stunning with how pure the color looked on him. Pepper, in her wolf form, has red and brown mixed to create a beautiful mix that looks perfect in the fall season. Finally Happy, in his wolf form, had a similar color scheme to Pepper but he was mostly brown with some red spots on his belly. All 3 of them turned around to see that Tony hadn’t shifted and they tilt their heads, seemingly in confusion of why Tony hadn’t shifted yet. All 3 of them walk up to him and rub their heads against his legs, seemingly signaling that they want him to shift.
Just seeing that made Steve feel hard. He just wanted to kiss Tony right now and taste the coffee on his lips.
“Tony can’t shift back to his human form and I’m scared,” fretted Steve as he cuddled his mate close to him in his human form.
“Dear Tony, everything is going to be alright. I’m going to keep you safe.” Steve spoke as he held his queen’s face in his hands and pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead and hugged him again.
This led into a brief explanation from Bruce, Tony, and Strange what the Infinity Stones were and who was after them, along with what he planned to do with them.
Steve and the others arrived back at where the army is. “King Howard is refusing to back down. This is the moment that we’ve been anticipating men, show no mercy to Howard and his men. This is a fight to save the queen.” Steve spoke as he fiercely eyed Howard and his men getting ready like they are, and unsheathed his sword. He then points it straight forward.
“Alright, I think I know why Tony can’t shift back to his human form,” said Bruce as he stood back up.
. Also if you haven’t seen the new Starkid musical, Black Friday, yet then go watch it on youtube. I AM OBSESSED!!!
Tony then turned to Steve, “You guys probably need new gear, yeah? Steve, you first. Follow me.” Tony turned and Steve followed him down to the workshop. Looked like he was finally going to be alone with Tony for a few minutes. Steve wondered whether that was good or bad.
Steve had sent Tony a burner phone and a letter, letting him know that Tony could call him if he needed Steve for any reason. After all this time, the phone still had no calls on it. Clearly Tony was doing just fine without him.
After they all had a quick after school snack, all 7 of Tony and Steve’s kids finally found the courage to talk about what has been happening at school.
Steve was about to respond to Natasha further when he noticed it. It was Wanda and Vision, and it appeared something was attacking them. Something...not of this world. He gave Nat and Sam a signal, and they all got in position to attack.
When their babies told them the horrors that they went through, Steve was immediately angry but kept his emotions under control. Tony went immediately into BIG MAMA mode, all he wanted to do right now is cry and hug all of his pups together so no one would be hurting them again.
“Me too, it gives me a chance to be able to spend some time with Pepper. She’s the greatest Alpha ever.” says Happy as he hugged Pepper from behind.
Steve then put one of his hands around Anthony’s neck and pressed lightly. Anthony felt a rush of adrenaline through his body with Steve pressing on his neck, may have even felt a bit more turned on.
After 1 hour passed, the candles burned out and Steve watched the smoke rise from what remained of the candles and patiently waited for Anthony to wake up.
Both of them then grabbed their clothes and put them back on before embracing each other and then looking at each other in the eyes.
Anthony was feeling overwhelmed with what Steve was doing to him and didn’t want it to stop. He heard Steve let out a low growl and his hands grabbing him tighter which made him let out a louder and more erotic moan. From there, Steve just lost control and stripped Anthony out of his clothes and quickly changed out of his own before picking him up like it was nothing and bringing him over to the bed and laying him down on his back. Anthony stared up at Steve’s eyes which were flashing red which he assumed is from the excitement built up inside. Steve attacked Anthony’s lips and they just started going at it.
“Steve, there’s one thing that I want to let you know.” Anthony spoke as he stared into Steve’s eyes.
“Alright, got that idea down. Now, there are some traditions that the kingdom follows for weddings but I want to know if you want to follow them or not.”
Shadows: Hey there guys! There be fluff and sexy times this chapter Enjoy! The song for this chapter is
“Now then, Steve, you look like you could use an upgrade,” Tony said as he eyed what remained of the suit. “Is that the same suit too?”
Steve rubbed his hands together before he gently slid one finger inside Anthony’s hole and went in and out again and again. Anthony opened his eyes and gasped from the shock of feeling what Steve was doing and felt a little discomfort since this was his first time doing this but didn’t ask Steve to stop because he was loving what was being done to him. Anthony felt it was good to let out more moans to let Steve know that he was enjoying this and he wasn’t in pain.
“And you’re the wolf that responded to my howl.” said the golden wolf as he rubbed his head on Tony’s. “So what’s your name? Now that I’ve found my mate, I want to know who they are.”
The pack went out for their usual hunt of the day with Tony tagging along with them so he could be with Steve. It was a beautiful autumn afternoon with some leaves turning different colors and falling to the ground. Tony was laying a pile of leaves while he watched as everyone did the hunting. While he was laying on the pile of leaves, he could feel his pups moving around inside which brought him a burst of happiness knowing that it’s less than 3 months until they’re born. Neither Tony nor Steve knew how many pups they would have but they were ready to see when they’re born. On their travels, they had slowly been accumulating the things they’d need for their pups. They had loads of clothes, blankets, and soft things ready in the back of the truck for when Tony gave birth.
After Steve and Tony mated 2 weeks ago, they finally arrived in the state of Missouri. Both of them were still in bliss from the mating and thinking about their future pups. After the pack arrived in the state, they made their way into Kansas City. As they made their way into the city, they saw a few packs roaming around as well but didn’t seem to bother them.
“Fine,” Tony replied, not really responding to Steve. “Just get here as fast as you can.” And with that, Tony hung up.
“I’m happy too Tony, I don’t have to worry about someone trying to take you and marry you off against your will.” Steve spoke as he wrapped his arms around Tony and hugged him.
“You’re too big! You couldn’t be Stevie.” Anthony said as the dog licked his face. Upon the dog stopping, he looked at said dog and it looked familiar.
Steve was busy keeping track of the weapons that were being prepared for combat, soldiers that were training for the past few weeks, and building up the defenses for the gates to the kingdom. Tony, is, of course, shaking and worrying about his father attacking but Steve is swift to hug and cuddle him.
Rhodey was the first to greet them, sticking his hand out to Steve, “Cap. I would say it’s good to see you again, but you look like crap.”
They decided they would travel up to 20 miles at a time each day so they would have enough time to eat, rest, and hunt.
After much discussion with Steve, Bruce, and Helen, Tony did agree to the spell that would allow him to carry his and Steve’s child. Bruce and Helen would be expecting Tony and Steve for regular visits as the pregnancy proceeded. Steve did everything he could to help Tony out as he got farther along. Tony kept a low public profile and mostly stayed at the Compound to avoid any prying eyes that could find him in the city. They were elated when they learned that they were actually having twins, two girls.
“I don’t know, it’s something I’ve thought about recently.” It wasn’t something they had discussed before, but for whatever reason Steve liked the idea of raising a family with Tony.
“Alright guys, time to move out,” Rhodey said as they got into formation. Rhodey and Pepper lead while Tony and Happy followed behind them.
Steve leans in to give Anthony a soft kiss to the side of his lips. The feeling of those lips on him made Anthony blush hard since he never had an intimate moment with someone before and he just met the person in front of him the day before. Steve could tell that Anthony is feeling a little tense so he takes everything he does slowly since they will be wedded in a few weeks.
Shadows: Let’s play a game called who wrote what part. Mind the graphic violence and birth. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
“Well my dear, you are now a vampire. You were asleep for 13 hours here while your body changed. You took everything very well and it made me very happy.”
They then laid their lips on each other and put their hands on each other’s shoulders.Tony opened his mouth slightly to moan and Steve took the chance to slip his tongue in his mouth while slipping his hands up the dress to cup the velvet bubble butt and knead it with his hands.
After they had their talk, Steve and Tony undressed for the night and got into bed, and fell asleep quickly with Steve having his arms around Tony.
They came across a clearing to which they see a wonderful view of the valley with a vast number of pine trees in it. Both of them take in the sight of the wonderful scene of nature before them. Aside from the pine trees around them, Steve and Anthony saw more animals. They saw a family of whitetail deer nearby, heard some hawks flying overhead, and saw a good amount of butterflies flying.
It’s been a week since Steve and Tony went to the healer and he wasn’t feeling any better. Steve decides that they needed to head back to the healer so he and Tony get dressed and headed to the hall where the healer is.
“Alright, the wedding will be tomorrow. Wanda and Pietro, send out word to the citizens that the wedding is tomorrow so the celebrations can begin.” Steve said to said people to which they nodded in understanding. “Be sure to get my suit and Tony’s dress finalized by the end of the day today so we’ll be ready for the wedding tomorrow.”
“Please dear, call me Steve. We will be wed in 2 weeks time so you should learn to call me by my name. Now, it’s time we are off on our ride together.”
Steve gave a nervous laugh. “Yeah, well, it’s kinda hard to keep up with shaving when you’re on the run. Plus it helps keep me from being recognized easily.”
Emmie: Here we are, we made it through Howl for Me and it’s sequel, The Next Stage. It sure was something to write both of them but Shadows made it fun and I loved every minute of it. Right now, I’m working on the 3rd chapter of Paint Me and my Stony song one-shots but writing this took a lot of energy out of me and I’ll get to them when I have it again. Thanks again for the love and we’ll see you guys next time when we post our own individual work.
“Listen up soldiers, King Howard from the Stark kingdom has received word that my bride is here and is coming to take him back. The wedding is being moved up to tomorrow so there is time to prepare for the up and coming attack from King Howard and his army. King Howard is not taking back the queen of the Hydra kingdom.” Steve yelled out, showing that he is very angry at the chance of Howard trying to take back his queen.
Over the next few hours, the pack would continue on the highway and take a break to eat and hunt for more food and find water to drink. They would also stop to play some games at some picnic tables at parks they found along the way to help entertain themselves after walking for quite a while
“Good morning my darling, glad to see you awake.” Steve said as he brushed one of his hands along Anthony’s cheek.
“Yeah he’s a wizard,” Tony added. “The kid & I helped him stop some aliens who were after his necklace.”
“Healer, it’s been a week since we last saw you, and Tony isn’t feeling any better. I’m honestly getting scared about his health.” fretted Steve as he held onto Tony’s arm.
“We’ll figure this out.” soothed Steve as he looked at all his pups. “We’ll figure this out. We’ll get all the information and we’ll go to the principal. I won’t let you guys suffer through this. I’ll keep you safe.”
“My dearest Anthony isn’t feeling well and I’m worried about him.” Steve said as he took Tony’s hand.
The ceremony proceeded, with the priest saying the opening prayer before the wedding party went to sit in the front row pews. They moved onto the readings, and afterward, the priest delivered a short sermon. When he finished, it was time for the wedding party to stand in front of the altar again, so Steve & Tony could recite their vows. They took each other’s hands as the priest turned to Steve.
Steve could hardly believe what he was hearing. His Tony. His Omega. His mate, was pregnant. This was… amazing. This was spectacular! In seconds, tears sprung into the pair’s eyes as Steve shifted back into his wolf form and bounded over to Tony. He all but plopped himself on top of his mate as he covered Tony in licks and nuzzles. He drank in Tony’s sweet scent with joy. Steve had never felt so happy in his life.
Tony didn’t really know what to say about that. He was scared. He was really scared. He was pregnant. He wouldn’t be able to help if they were attacked. The worry turned Tony’s scent sour and Steve started nuzzling him and pawing at his belly. Tony knew that Steve was trying to help keep him calm, but that didn’t stifle his worry.
“Steve, we got word that King Howard from the Stark kingdom has found out that Tony is here and is mobilzing his army to take him back.”
Emmie: Some crazy stuff is about to happen in this chapter. Only 1 more chapter before the end of this fic. Enjoy!
They came up for air and Tony pulled back slightly. “Is this ok?” Steve nodded, not daring to speak. Their mouths came together again. Part of Steve wanted to pull back and ask what this all meant, and another part of him just wanted to relish this moment, unsure if he would ever get the chance to kiss Tony again. There was no telling how far they would have gone if the sound of someone clearing their throat hadn’t interrupted them. They both broke apart and turned to see Shuri and T’Challa with frustrated expressions.
As they are riding through the main city, the citizens of the HYDRA kingdom notice their king and future queen. They stop what they’re doing and bow down and praise their king and future queen. Both of them reach the gate of the kingdom and exit through, heading into the forest.
“See how beautiful everything is? It brings me peace that we have a world like this. Also, I’m happy that I found someone like you my dear Anthony and I can’t wait when we’ll be wedded in 2 weeks and then the marriage will be consummated that night.”
Here's the next chapter guys. It does include some smut. Hope the wait for this chapter wasn't horrible.
Emmie: Guys, I’m AMAZED at how well the first chapter of this fic performed. It blew me & Shadow’s expectations out of the WATER. Thank You guys SO MUCH for the love & support for this. I also wanted to bring up that there is this fic series that actually inspired this fic so if you guys want to check it out, go look up “Night” by SparkleWeb_Stark on AO3. Also, I’m from the United States and Shadow is from Canada so there will be words said differently depending on who is writing which chapter so there’s the heads-up. Thanks for reading this fic and I hope you guys will LOVE the chapters coming in the future.
As Tony walked into the city, he could smell with his heightened sense of smell that there were some packs roaming around and he could see some wolves going into buildings. Tony planned on getting some food for the rest in the cabin and find some stuff for the garage like materials to build with like tools.
And finally, there was Loki. He’s opened up a book shop that sold just about every kind of book you could think of. Loki felt at home surrounded by books in his little shop. He’d spend his days reading and writing among the piles of books when he wasn’t helping people find things.
“Huh? Lang?” As soon as he finds out, Anthony feels mortified that a video of him skating to Steven’s routine from the Grand Prix Final has gone viral on the internet.
Shadows: Anyone order some fluff? Cuz that’s what’s on the menu for this chapter. Enjoy! Chapter title is from
“I’m feeling the same way Tony but I feel like we should wait for them to come to us so they don’t feel pressured to tell us anything,” Steve spoke before taking Tony’s hand that has his wedding ring on it up to his lips and kissing it.
Steve then started with the plans of letting the kingdom know of the future heir but found it important to let his cabinet know of the news. About 1 hour after the pair found out the news, Steve gathered his cabinet into the meeting room with Tony.
The golden wolf turned around looked at Tony in the eyes. Both of them seemingly freeze in place when they smelled each other’s scents. The scents register in their brains that they’re mates and they walk up to each other where their noses are touching. The golden wolf then walked around Tony and sniffed him before he licked his face, showing that he recognized Tony as one of his own.
“Hey, I said I’d come if you needed me. And I think you’ll need me, in spite of whatever personal problems we may have. I’ll be there” Steve wasn’t going to let the state of their relationship get in the way. The fate of the planet could be at stake.
Man, this took a while but I finished it. Hope you guys enjoy the new chapter. I'm actually really excited about writing this but I need a break.
“I’ve seen how you are with Peter, Tony. I think you would make a great dad.” Steve had noticed that while all of them liked Peter, the bond he had with Tony was almost that of a father and son.
Steve looked at the silver band with the blue diamond embedded inside. "Yes. I barely ever take it off."
Emmie: This is the end everyone, thanks for reading this fic and maybe we’ll have another coming out. I just posted the 2nd chapter of Paint Me but it did take a while since I’ve been focusing on making sure this gets done and handling college but since I’ve been sent home because of the coronavirus so now I’m doing my school work from home and I can work on my fics now. Thanks for reading this fic and maybe in the future, we’ll do another fic. ENJOY!
“Steve. My name is Steve. I’m happy I found you as my mate Tony.” said Steve as they both join their heads together where their foreheads are resting against each other.
“I see, there is one more test I could do and I think it will be the thing that will determine what is wrong with the Queen.” said the healer as he went to a part of the room and grabbed some tools.
“On to the most important part of the planning: what our attire will be. I have my tailors working on my attire which is a blouse along with a black waistcoat and pants. The buttons and ribbons on it will be red. Your dress is going to be black and wine red with a lace and corseted bodice with a square neckline. The veil will be long and lacy and have some embroidered flowers at the head and end. What do you think of your attire that I described to you?”
“King Howard, I’m going to give you one warning and only one warning. Tony is not going to be yours to marry off to someone else that he did not consent to. Tony is his own being and can make choices for himself and you can’t change that. This will be your only warning Howard: Back away or there will be bloodshed.” Steve spoke with an angry tone and his eyes flashed red.
“I said back off. If you can’t listen to basic instructions then that’s your own fault.” growled the golden Alpha as he looked back at Tony. Tony pushed himself further into the corner to keep himself safe. He just knew a fight was about to break out.
Emmie: It's finally here guys, read the chapter and I hope you'll like the smut that Shadows cooked up
“Sit down in the chair, Tony,” Howard said as he motioned towards the chair nearby. Tony obeyed Howard’s order and sat in the chair not far from the man.
“We will have candelabras and tapestries at the end of the altar. What color do you think they should be dear Tony?” Steve spoke as he took hold of one of Tony’s hands and rubbed it with love.
“Your wish is my command my darling.” Steve purred as he then slid home inside of Anthony’s hole. Steve grunted as he felt Anthony’s warmth clench around his member. Anthony felt his whole body quiver with each thrust from Steve into his body. He was thankfully for the stretching that Steve did beforehand and by GOD was the entire experience just full of ecstasy.
“Well, we’ll have to move the wedding up to tomorrow so King Howard knows that Tony is queen of the Hydra kingdom and it will be more difficult for him to take Tony back.” Peggy spoke.
“Anthony, is something wrong?” Steve asked with a tone that rivaled the toughness of his appearance.
It was hard to believe that their 10 year wedding anniversary was coming up after the school year is over for their kids. They were together for 7 years beforehand and the wedding they had was further proof of how much they loved each other. Before they’d both met each other, they’d never thought they would find THAT mate that would complete their souls. They couldn’t wait to celebrate their anniversary in June with their whole family.
Shadows: Hey peoples. Here’s a new chapter for you. Enjoy some fluff and a little bit of trouble brewing.
Emmie: Get ready guys, the next chapter is the halfway point in this fic and it’s the chapter you guys have been waiting for since Steve & Tony met.
Before the pack left Missouri, they settled for the night in a nearby park. Steve cuddled Tony by the fire that Pepper had set up beforehand and kept him close. He had the urge to lick Tony’s belly and nuzzled it, Steve was proud that he was going to have pups.
Steve is on the ground, clutching his side while he stares at Howard towering over him. “It’s over King Steven, Tony is going to be taken back to be married off.”
Tony bares his fangs and eyes flash red as he whips out his sword and stabs Howard in the neck which results in said person clutching his neck and falling to his knees
Anthony is watching the footage of Harley practicing is in shock of how good the kid has been doing since the last time he saw him.
To say the battle against Thanos and his army in Wakanda was intense was an understatement to say the least. Steve and Tony fought together well alongside the rest of the team and T’Challa’s warriors. It reminded Steve of how well they worked together before it all started to fall apart. Wanda stayed in Shuri’s lab, ready to destroy the Mind Stone once Shuri was able to remove it from Vision. The rest of them were outside, trying to buy them as much time as possible. The outcome seemed uncertain until Thor made a triumphant return, delivering the killing blow to Thanos before he had a chance to get all the stones.
“We need to move NOW.” spoke Sam as he looked behind him to check for anyone that might be hiding. As soon as Sam finished talking, everyone went over to the truck and Tony got into the front passenger side and Happy shifted back and then turned on the truck and started to drive with everyone else surrounding the truck.
In one of the rooms of the villa resort that isn’t available for public use. Anthony is in front of a vigil with a photo of young Anthony with his dog Stevie.
In the morning, Steve could feel someone licking his face which he guessed was Tony waking him up. When he sat up, Steve could see Tony wagging his tail with happiness in front of him and jumped off of the bed. After he got out of bed, Steve shifted into his wolf form and went outside with Tony following behind.
Fairly quick, the healer comes back with the things he needs and Steve is quick to hold Tony’s hand.
With a heavy heart, Steve slid it off his finger and dropped it into Tony's open palm. "Listen, I know I don't deserve it anymore, but it was my only reminder of you, of what we had, of when we were happy."
Steve was amazed. “Tony, you designed me a new suit?” He ran his fingers over the material. “But you had no idea if I’d ever be back.”
“Well...the thing is that my father, or Sir as I ended up calling him, had arranged for me to be married to an Alpha from a different pack because he thought it was time that I had started being useful for once. In the middle of the night after he told me the news, I ran off so I wouldn’t have to go through a mating I didn’t have a voice in. I thought I was going to die in the snow but of course, you guys found me which is why I’m here right now.” said Tony as he looked around at the others at the dinner table. “I don’t know if my father is looking for me or not. But if I’m honest, he probably doesn’t care since he thought I was useless since I’m an Omega.”
After their babies went to school for the day, Tony and Steve just sat at the table in the dining room with cups filled with coffee. They were both just staring at their cups of coffee before Steve decided to speak up.
After reading the announcement from the king, the citizens erupted in joy. Their king and queen were going to have an heir to the throne and they couldn’t wait for their arrival.
Steve and his team were checking on Wanda and Vision. The last communication from Wanda implied they were in Scotland, which was why they found themselves there now.
“Are you ready to become one like me? Do you fully agree to become my queen?” Steve spoke huskily as his eyes flashed red and fangs lengthened to where Anthony could see them from his mouth.
For days, Tony walked through what felt like a never-ending blanket of whiteness. He wondered if Howard was looking for him. He doubted it. He was nothing more than a useless tool for the man. He tried not to dwell on things. It did not good to think about the past. There were better things to think about as he trudged through the growing piles of snow.
“I have to go with “Bitch”.” and as Happy said that Tony screamed, “YEAH, I WON!!!” and gets up out of his chair and starts doing the running man dance. After Tony does his shtick, they clean up the games before Rhodey speaks up.
“These two kids are Pietro and Wanda Maximoff that we share classes or activities with,” Rowan spoke.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve said, giving Tony a small smile. Tony did not quite smile back, but the softness in his eyes was still there.
The past 3 months of traveling had been crazy. With Tony now pregnant, he had to be careful of what he was doing. Thankfully he had a strong mate and packmates to protect him from harm. It definitely made things easier that was for sure.
“Here darling, these shoes are fit for the future queen of the Hydra kingdom.” Steve then handed the shoes to Anthony who put them on swiftly.
The unforgiving climate of the Rocky Mountains was hard on Tony. His brown fur offered little warmth from the cold winds and clumps of snow started to stick to his underside. Yet still, he trudged on. He couldn’t stop moving. He had to keep moving. The best thing he could do was to keep moving. He needed to get away from his old home. He needed to find his freedom.
Hey guys, it's been a while. Don't worry, I'm not abandoning this fic. I just have school and I want to be focusing on that more than writing but I have been doing bits of this chapter here and there and now the latest chapter is FINALLY done after 2 months of waiting. Hope you guys enjoy!
After the news of his mate being pregnant sank in, Steve growled when anyone would get too close to him. His instincts were screaming at him to protect and defend his mate. It was very rare that Steve would leave Tony’s side. He only left if he was needed on a hunt, and even then he never took long and brought Tony all the best pieces of the kill. He wanted Tony and their pups to grow healthy and strong.
Shadows: It’s the last chapter guys! I can’t believe this journey is coming to an end! I hope you all enjoy this one. Italics are flashbacks and there’s some graphic birth in this chapter. Enjoy!!! Here’s a little song rec from me!
They stopped at a set of doors which Steve opened and led him and Tony inside and closed the doors behind them. The study had an atmosphere that felt cozy which was complemented with the fact that there was a fire place that was calmly burning in the background, a desk that had intricate designs in the wood with a cushy chair behind it, a number of bookshelves that were full of books, and a nice large window that was behind the desk. Steve walked over to sit in the chair and gestured for Tony to sit in his lap. Steve took out a piece of paper and brought over a fountain pen to start the list.
Emmie: Hope you guys enjoy this chapter, there is also the appearance of two characters that I have been wanting to show up since Howl for Me. Enjoy!
Tony spotted a hardware store and went inside. He went up and down the aisles picking up a 9 piece wrench set, a 50 Phillips head screws set with some screwdrivers to match the head, work goggles, face masks, and safety gloves. After checking out, Tony headed to a nearby store to get some food for the cabin. He picked out some fruit, vegetables, bread, milk, and other foods that everyone wanted in the cabin. After he checked out with the food, Tony started making his way back to the cabin.
Also, the journey to the east coast would take longer to accommodate Tony’s pregnancy in case he needed anything. It was better to take things slow and steady with such valuable cargo. Nobody had any problems with this new arrangement. After all, they all wanted Tony and the pups to thrive.
Upon Steve laying out the plans of announcing the pregnancy, everyone else at the table nodded their heads.
“Are you alright Tony? How come you’re not shifting back?” asked Steve as he sat up and looked at Tony who was still on the floor and in his wolf form.
Before he could continue on with talking, a tiny girl’s head popped out from the side of the rink with Hope.
Throughout the rest of the day, Steve and Tony visited the citizens of the kingdom so Tony could get to know his future subjects. Steve and Tony went to a restaurant in the kingdom that was highly regarded by the people. The owner of the place runs it with her family and was shocked to see the king and future queen come in. The dishes that they ordered were steaks that were drizzled in blood and had glasses of blood to drink. What stole Tony’s heart were the owner’s daughter who was surprised to see the king and future queen at their mother’s place. The girl gave Steve and Tony ribbons that she made with red and black silk. After they had their delicious meal, both of them thanked the owner for her hospitality and tipped nicely.
Before everyone went to sleep on their second day of traveling, Bucky went up to Tony to speak with him.
Steve thought about it for a minute. “I’m actually not opposed to the idea. We would probably need Dr. Cho and Bruce to keep an eye on us if we went through with it, just in case.”
“Steve...I still can’t believe that Howard is finally gone. I don’t have to live in fear anymore.” Tony spoke as his hands shook a little
“Well then let’s get this show on the road, I want out of this monkey suit”, Bucky replied, making Steve laugh.
Shadows: By popular demand we’re here with a little bonus chapter! A little something extra for these weird ass times. Enjoy!!!
“What do you think? Much as I would hate to rely on magic, there is an appeal to having our own kid ourselves.” Tony asked Steve.
“Remember my dear Anthony, you tell me to stop if you feel uncomfortable at any point.” Steve spoke softly.
Anthony walked over, being mindful of the dress, stepped on Steve’s hands which he used to boost Anthony onto the horse before getting on himself and taking hold of the reins.
Tony was still down on one knee holding the ring. “Look, I know this doesn’t magically fix everything, and we still both have apologies to make. I did a lot of thinking over the past two years, about us. Something about seeing the ring still on your finger though, made me want to try again. So yes. This is what I want. I want to keep my promise to you”
“This is far enough Howard, you are not going to harm Steve any further and I’m not going back to be married off to someone I don’t love.”  Tony says fearless with his eyes glowing slightly red.
“Rhodey,” Steve replied, relieved that Rhodey at least forgave him enough to joke with him. He wondered what Tony might have told him about what happened. “I will say it’s really good to see you again.”
Shadows: Well… this is just about one of the strangest things I’ve ever written. I really have nothing to say for myself. I tried. Beware the smut below. Chapter title is from
The rest of the service went on once they sat back down. At the end, the priest invited Steve & Tony again to stand in front of him while he said a closing prayer. Once he finished, they instinctively drew in for another kiss.
The two slept that night surrounded in their sweet scents and complete joy. Both dreamed of what their sweet little pups would look like.
Anthony then the routine that Steven performed at the Grand Prix Final which is what he is performing at the World Skating Championship.
“Thank you. I can get the saddle on her. You may leave.” Steve spoke which the servant nodded and left the room.
When they arrived back at the castle, all of the army went off to get medical treatment from the nurses available while Steve, Tony, and the council head back to the castle.
Steve and Tony then get comfortable in the chair before then lovingly embrace each other. They will be getting married in a few weeks and they’ll be bound to each other for eternity.
There was one incident where they were spending a few days in an old cabin on the outskirts of Pittsburg when they caught whiff of HYDRA. The only reason they were even staying in a place for more than one night was because Tony hadn’t been feeling well. Tony’s health and wellbeing had to come first.
Shadows: Hey there. Welcome to… mostly exposition! Get ready from some non-action and stop excitement! Here we go!!!!
Tony was enjoying his time laying in the leaves when the pack came sprinting back from their hunt. Now the pack coming back early wouldn’t normally be that big of a deal if they had a fresh kill with them. But they were empty-handed and Steve looked part frantic and part furious.
"Well then, I hope I'm not misreading this," Tony replied as he got down on one knee, holding the ring out to Steve. Steve held his breath, his heart pounding so loud he was sure Tony could hear it. "Steven Grant Rogers, my dearest beloved, will you marry me? And we’ll make it stick this time?"
“Is everything ok Steve? You have this weird look on your face.” Tony said to him as he sat the towel down on the desk.
But speaking of said family, they really were worried about their kids. They weren’t used to seeing them so quiet and Tony was positive that he’s heard Rowan crying in his room with the others the other day. He hadn’t said anything because they seemed to solve the issue at hand, but it was still worrying. They just wanted to make sure their sweet pups were alright.
“Then a few weeks ago, Sarah had enough and kicked Pietro’s ass after practice. It was at the same time as when Pietro insulted River and said some not so nice things.” Fawn spoke.
“Welcome back home after five long years!” said the woman who held a banner with Anthony’s name on it.
Bruce continued to work as the pack doctor. With so many members it was important they had a doctor on hand to keep everyone healthy. Especially the more accident-prone members. Clint came in with some sort in cut or bruise at least once a week. Speaking of Clint, he’d taken the job of teaching archery to kids. He absolutely loved his craft and was always excited to share it with others. Plus Clint working had the added benefit of getting him out of the house where he was even more messy and troublesome than all nine pups combined.
“No, he didn’t qualify. But fortunately for us, that means he can come home.” Maria said as she tending to a plant in the main lobby of the villa resort that the family ran.
“Now let’s talk about Anthony Stark, who was competing in his first Grand Prix Finale. What are your thoughts?”
Shadows: Hey there! Did anyone ask for even more character introductions and maybe a little bit of kissing? Because that’s what you’re getting. Enjoy!!
“Now come with me Anthony, there is a matter we must get to.” Steve whispered into Anthony’s ears as he caressed his neck with one of his hands.
A lot happened during the next year. In light of the battle against Thanos, Steve and the other rogue Avengers had been pardoned. There was arguing and apologies on both sides, and Steve and Tony talked a lot about the Accords, about Bucky, and everything that happened in the past few years. It was difficult, but both Steve and Tony knew it had to happen for them to move forward. They spent more than one evening in the beginning sleeping in separate rooms. But Tony never asked for the ring back or questioned wanting to marry Steve. Steve certainly didn’t question marrying Tony. They both knew they wanted this and were willing to work for it.
In the morning, the pack got some exercise before eating some food & drinking some water before resuming their journey to the east coast. Happy resumed driving the truck and everyone walked with the same partners and in the same spots as the day before.
They did spend time discussing it, as each of them had concerns about the potential quality of their parenting skills, as well the danger of their jobs. In the end, they came to the conclusion that they both wanted to raise a family. They just weren’t sure how. Adoption? Using a surrogate mother? It was Thor who came up with an interesting, if unorthodox solution. He had overheard the two of them discussing their options, and told them of an ancient Asgardian spell that would allow one of them to become pregnant. Thor assured them it would be safe and only temporarily alter the anatomy long enough to carry a child.
After their short conversation, both of them hugged each other and kissed before they got back on their horses and Steve called for the army to return home.
Seeing how Pepper and Happy were bonded, Tony wondered if he would bond to Rhodey but it didn’t seem like they were connecting like that.
Shadows: Yay! It’s time for a new chapter to help cut the boredom of being stuck inside. I hope everyone’s doing alright. I hope y’all are ok. Either way. Enjoy!
Tony is riding carefully through the woods, being on the lookout for Steve or anyone. Soon after he can hear sounds of shouting and swords clashing. Something told Tony that Steve must be nearby. After emerging from the woods, Tony can see the battle going on and is disturbed by all the bloodshed he sees. But something that Tony sees something that changes his tone immediately.
“Oh, we’re not, I mean, it’s just relieving some pre-battle tension, you know?” Tony responded, flustered, and looking as embarrassed as Steve felt. “But, you know, you’re right, we should get back to planning.” With that, Tony sat back down and turned back to what he was working on.
Steve’s tone changes in an instant as his eyes flashed red before taking Tony in his arms and speaking “Tell my council to suit up and meet me in the stables at once.”
On the T.V. in the main lobby of the villa resort, footage is shown of inside the Aviator Sports ice rink of skaters practicing.
“Nah, don't worry. How long are you staying, anyway? Are you going to help out with the villa resort?”
During the beginning of their journey, everyone stuck with someone to walk with besides the truck. Sam walked with Bucky, Thor walked with Loki in the back to protect everyone from behind, Bruce walked with Clint, Natasha walked with Pepper while they walked by the driver’s side of the truck so Pepper could be near Happy at least, and Rhodey lead the way in front so he could protect from the front. Of course Steve and Tony would be walking together. Since they found each other, they’ve been in absolute heaven since they found each other and couldn’t wait to mate fully in a few weeks.
Tony hesitates for a minute before opening his mouth and uses his tongue to lick the head and make little sucking noises to test out doing this. Steve closes his eyes and lets out moans of pleasure before opening them again and looking down at Tony working his magic on his cock.
With that being said, Anthony closed his eyes and allowed Steve to do whatever he wanted to do. Steve brought his hands to where Anthony’s chest is and planted some light kisses on his neck before moving down to his chest before moving his hands to Anthony’s hips. He placed feather-light kisses across his chest and moved down to his hips. Steve then laid his eyes on Anthony’s member and felt his fangs lengthen and eyes flash red a little. He let out a little hiss before moving his tongue to the head of Anthony’s cock. Anthony let out quick erotic moans from the intense feelings of what Steve is doing to him.
“Yes dear Steve.” Tony said before he took hold of Steve’s forearm before they left the study and headed down the hall.
Tony, Rhodey, and Pepper eagerly watch Happy as he looks between the 3 white cards, trying to decide which one was the best.
While all 9 pups in the house were working themselves throughout the school year, the adults in the mansion were also working.
He turned behind him and took Anthony’s right hand and kissed the knuckles. “Shall we head out my darling?” Steve spoke in a way that had a drawl in his voice and there seemed to be a lot of contractions in his words.
“So my dear Tony, do you have any ideas for the wedding?” Steve said as he held the pen above the piece of paper while looking at Tony.
Steve, Natasha, and Sam were in Scotland at night moving from place to place quickly without being seen since they were wanted for violating the Sokovia Accords. Bucky was safe in Wakanda with T’Challa and Shuri working on removing the HYDRA programming from his mind so he didn’t have to fear being controlled again.
Steve then guided Tony to the basement and into the weapons room. Immediately, Steve started to panic and rushed Tony over to a cupboard.
“That endgame I tried to warn you all about?” Tony said, interrupting him. “It’s on its way here. Now. As we speak.”
After Tony finished his story, they all just sat in silence and taking in what the Omega had told them.
Tony walked in and Steve had to resist the urge to run down the aisle, grab him, and kiss him right there. He looked beautiful in a white satin tux with a knee-length jacket and gold trim along the sides, carrying deep red roses. Their eyes met, and neither one looked away as Tony made his way up the aisle. Steve didn’t think he breathed at all as Tony made his approach. He finally made it up to the altar, where he handed his flowers off and looked up at Steve from beneath his eyelashes.
“Thank you. Now let’s be on our way Tony.” Steve spoke before him and Tony left the room to relax for the day.
Thor and Sam worked in construction which is why they were able to build the extension to their old mansion before moving into their current one. They were really good at the job, gaining a reputation across the city for their expertise.
They all make it back to the cabin with their treasure and then they settled down for the night. Before falling asleep, Tony thinks
“Tony, you were amazing. I’m proud of you for doing so well.” Steve said as he stroked Tony’s cheek with his left hand.
“Steve...I’m not feeling very well.” Tony spoke, holding his stomach and covering his mouth with one of his hands.
Anthony’s eyes snapped open and rose up. He watched as Steve walked in front of him and kneeled in front of him.
“Now Tony, I want to be clear on one thing before we can finally move on with our lives. Even though you saved my life in the battle, you didn’t stay where I told you to be safe and I’m upset with you. Even though I’m king and you are my queen, I still would like for you to listen to me when it comes to your safety.”
“Yes, make me one of you.” Anthony said as he turned his head to offer up his neck for Steve to bite.
“I’m fine. Thank you for saving me,” said Tony as he fixed his satchel full of the supplies he had purchased for the cabin. Tony stepped forward to the golden Alpha and licked his face in return. “You’re the wolf that I saw on the cliffs”
Shadows: Things are happening! Who’s ready for things? It’s a good one this time around. Enjoy!! Also, it’s Emmie’s birthday today! Happy Birthday!!!!!
“I’d love to, but is it still coming down hard?” asked Tony, still reeling from when he nearly died in the storm.
“Why? You should have it. It was made for you.” Tony gently put the shield on Steve’s arm, and for some reason Steve was reminded of Tony placing the ring on his finger.
“Alright my sweet Tony. Let’s get the wedding planned.” Steve said as he led him and Tony out of the vault and headed for Steve’s study.
They all continued this pattern for a few days before they reached the next state: Kansas. After they crossed the border into the state, Tony felt a breath of fresh air knowing that he was now far from his father and he was moving further towards a new life with his mate and future family.
Tony had told him his shield didn’t actually belong to him. Funny that Tony hadn’t mentioned anything about the ring. So Steve kept it on his finger, clinging to the forlorn hope that maybe one day he and Tony would come back together and fulfill the promise they made to each other.
“You see Tony, Omegas are only good for one thing. I’ve gotten word from the Stone pack that their Alpha son has come of age and is ready for a mate. I said that I would send him you. This way you are no longer my problem and you can retrieve us resources. It’s high time you take your place in this world.”
After putting on the dress, Steve stared in desire at how the dress is form fitting on Anthony’s chest and pushes up his breasts to give them some form and saw how the skirt flowed around his feet. Steve then brought over a pair of slip ons that were of the same color that had lace on the side and heels that were 0.5 inch tall.
Their hands are all over each other as they passionately kiss with Steve nipping Anthony’s neck. His hands go back to Anthony’s ass where he grabs, pinches, and kneads. That results in Anthony letting out some high pitched moans.
“Do you, Steven Grant Rogers, take Anthony Edward Stark to be your husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?”
“It’s ok Tony, the storm let up a few hours ago so it’s just the snow on the ground,” Rhodey mentioned as he put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Alright, let’s get a move on guys.”
After a nice day of interacting with the citizens, Steve and Tony headed back to the castle. When they got back, Steve’s council was waiting for them and they looked worried except for Bucky who looked upset.
They didn’t have much time left before Thanos and his Scooby-Doo gang would arrive. Everyone was currently in Wakanda to prepare for when the arrival of Thanos would come so Tony was making some final adjustments to his and Steve’s uniforms to make sure that there weren’t any faulty parts that could prove bad in battle. Tony was pleasantly surprised with how smart Shuri was. She was the one that designed T’Challa’s suit and he was impressed with how she was able to make a suit that had vibranium woven into the suit and didn’t weigh as much as Steve’s shield.
Very quickly, Anthony gets up and rushes out back to where the villa resort pool is and sees that his idol, Steven Rogers, is here and he’s speechless.
“Hey. I’ll be competing in the senior division next year. Maybe it’s time for you to retire. I don’t think we need two Yuris in the same bracket. Loser!” Harley speaks before heading out of the bathroom.
“We’re being followed.” supplied Bucky. “There were fresh paw prints in the mud. They smelled new. Smell like disease. Smelled like HYDRA.”
Shadows: This one’s a bit on the shorter side, but it’s full of sweetness. So… it’s like a cookie. ENJOY YOUR COOKIE!
Tony’s eyes shone at that. “Morgan and Sarah it is then.” Steve leaned over and kissed him, feeling nothing but happiness.
It’s only been 15 minutes since Steve left and Tony is growing restless. He is scared of what could be happening to Steve right now.
“Thank you Steve.” Tony said with his back turned. That kind of made Steve’s heart sink. He was trying to help make up for the past few years, which wouldn’t be easy, and he just felt like Tony was ignoring him in slight ways like this.
“Ha! I’m telling you, Cassie might be one of your biggest fans. Hey!” Scott said coming from behind Anthony.
“Sure enough, he’s crushed the free skate event, as well. This marks the 5th consecutive Grand Prix Final win for Irish Legend Steven Rogers. Rogers is now 27 years old. Some speculate that he may retire but his masterful performance here may lay such rumors to rest.”
? I don’t understand it.” She shook her head. “There’s just so much—there’s so much I don’t understand.”
“I think so. I think I’ve aged. Maybe a little slowly. I’m not as handsome as I used to be,” Steve teased. Tony snorted.
not dead, and last I recalled she’s got a couple of brats who can work her shit just fine,” the bald man spoke. “Get up high and stay out of sight, Johnson. If they didn’t come back out that means they’ve got at least one other entrance and exit—we’ve seen Barton and Danvers since yesterday.”
“Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk, hold position I’m going to go cover shellhead,” Cap said over the comm. Tony lifted the faceplate on the suit and started removing the gauntlets—he wouldn’t be able to do the work he needed with them on. Just as they were off, an alien landed on the roof next to him.
other universes. I mean, there were theories. Ideas. It’s just—amazing to find some of them confirmed, to figure out how it really all works.”
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Steve asked her in barely more than a whisper when they parted.
“I’m not one of your bots, Mom,” Kate replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “I can’t be perfect all the time.” Her mother pulled her close and kissed the top of her head.
“Well then, what are we waiting for? We’ve got science to do,” Bruce said decidedly. Peter’s face split into a wide grin. There, now, that was the Peter Bruce knew.
There were many things in life that Kate Rogers hated. Spinach, for one. She used to cross her arms and glue her mouth shut while her father looked down at her with a disappointed frown and an “eat-your-vegetables” standard speech while her mother kept her lips glued shut to keep from laughing. She hated going into her mother’s lab, because she inevitably got grease or oil all over whatever she was wearing. She hated the dentist, with their scraping tools and drills and bland customer service smiles. She hated lots of things, but at this moment Kate Rogers thought that the one thing she hated most in the world was
“Budge up,” James told his little brother as he maneuvered his way into the bed next to him. Peter groaned and rolled further into the bed as James shoved him over. It was quiet for a little while, the only sound being the deep breaths of sleep from his brother and sister.
“Well?” James asked, raising an eyebrow. He gestured with his arm and stepped aside, as if he hadn’t just been standing in the way of the entrance. “Ladies first.” Their sigh of relief was inaudible, but James heard it all the same. They filed in one after the other, and then James shut the door behind them all.
he was stable) they had transferred him to the triskelion hospital where the others had joined him. They couldn’t stay there for long, but at the moment Steve was ignoring the danger the MCU universe was in. Natasha could handle the administrative details while Steve handled his family.
“No, sir,” JARVIS replied. “I am doing what I can.” While JARVIS did what he could, Tony was screaming at 199999.
“No, so that when Kate wakes up we’re not fighting in front of her face,” she said stoically. 3490 Steve seemed to agree with that at least, as he let Antonella lead him into an empty room across the way. They both must have realized that every pair of eyes in the hallway—Avenger, family, or not—was still following them, but it seemed to be a condition they were both used to. They shut the door behind them, but it didn’t help much. The Avengers, alternate or not, seated so close, could still hear everything even though it was a bit muffled.
It was strange, for Steve. He had no idea how to navigate the stormy seas that surrounded James Rogers. He had made it perfectly clear that he did
“Most of the file was redacted,” Natasha responded. “It’s an anomaly amongst the others. We need the full file, the real file.” Clint was having difficulty focusing single-mindedly on the mission at hand. How could he, when there was such a nice steak in front of him? Natasha had no such problems. She had yet to touch her salmon.
“Of course, sir,” the pretty woman at the desk answered, her eyes flicking briefly to Steve. She ran the card, then handed it back along with two electronic key cards. Tony snatched them and moved quickly to the elevator.
Steve. And suddenly out of the smoke he appeared. Terror was written all over his face—he’d heard her scream and come running. He gathered her up into his arms. His face was beaten and bloody, and he’d clearly been injured. The shield on his arm was dripping blood not his own. But he was ok. He was safe. He was alive.
“I do not know,” Thor said. “The cube’s presence troubles me. I have not seen its like nor know its name. The tesseract is the only similar energy source I am aware of.” Steve figured that was not a good sign.
“Partly, yes,” Steve said, removing his hand. “Partly because of everything I’ve observed from her. She’s been—she’s been very kind to me. Kind to all of us, really. And I do think my double had a point—they could have locked us up, Tony. They could’ve thrown us in jail, but instead they invited us home. That has to count for something.”
, and so close to the end and I still—thinking about it felt like making it happen. Think about it, and maybe it plays out that way. Shove it away, leave it as an abstract, make arrangements but don’t
“Yeah,” Steve said. He felt his heart do a little flutter when Tony graced him with the tiniest upward quirk of his lips.
“Well, shouldn’t be long now,” his dad said. “Hand me one of those nuts over there—yeah, that’s the one.” His dad screwed a few things into place, then glanced up at Peter. “So, how’s the other guy look?” Peter was startled, but he managed an innocent, questioning expression. His dad just gave him a look. “Come on, Peter, I know a right cross when I see one. Yes or no, do I have to call somebody’s father?” A rush of horror flooded through Peter. He shook his head.
“I deserved that,” Dad answered quietly. “I know we need to talk—all of us—about what happened, everything that happened. I wish I had more time—”
“So. We’re stuck in an alternate universe. We have no way of getting out of here without trusting our alternate versions to do it for us. We have no idea what we’re up against or why we’re here. Sound like a succinct summary?” Steve asked the team.
“Light punishment works well on a kid like Peter, but not a kid like Kate,” 3490 Tony argued. “Besides, name once that Peter has done something half as bad as sneaking out at night to go to a
“What I heard in that office. Did you or did you not humiliate that boy?” Dad asked. James stepped closer, and peeked around the corner. He could see his little brother shifting his weight around and nodding a bit.
.” Clint looked a bit like he’d swallowed his own tongue at that, and 3490 Tony went back to her mission of setting out ingredients. Tony smirked in Clint’s direction.
“I don’t have time for this!” Kate snapped. “Somebody get the Commander to medical.” Kate didn’t know who would respond, if anyone, but she didn’t have time to contemplate it. He was a super soldier. So long as he didn’t get himself shot in the head while he was standing there staring at nothing, he’d survive a bout of shock. Peter was the priority. Peter was the one in real danger just then.
had cracked ribs and was getting beaten up at school and they were none the wiser and Tony wondered if they’d even
“Dwyer,” James said at last. “We’ll be stationed at Camp Dwyer.” Steve felt himself go cold all over, like plunging into the Atlantic all over again.
Tony watched her daughter from a distance as she sat in her room, doing her homework at the white desk that had been in her room since she was six years old. Kate tucked a lock of her long dark hair back behind her ear as she referenced something in a textbook. Kate was smart. She had always been incredibly intelligent, even if Tony was ashamed to say she often gave Peter more credit on that front. Peter liked the sciences, had an
“I knew how absurd that was, and how selfish—here we were, about to endanger numerous lives, and I was upset that my relatively new husband and I were certainly getting divorced. So I told him that. I told him how I felt about it, how upset I was over how this was tearing us apart, how I desperately wanted to stop, wanted to agree with him, but that I just couldn’t, physically, psychically couldn’t. And then it was like some sort of dam broke inside both of us and—all the shit we’d been through didn’t matter anymore. Frankly it probably didn’t hurt that I’d been dying just months before. It puts a certain light on things. Anyway, we worked our shit out and realized how important marriage was to the
“All of you could be dead if James hadn’t left. And James would be dead if you hadn’t slowed his fall off that rafter, if you hadn’t used your web to stem the bleeding, or if you had left him in the warehouse or in that tunnel alone. You saved him, Peter. It was his choice to leave that bunker, not yours,” Steve said. “Blaming yourself isn’t going to do anybody any good. If anybody’s to blame here it’s me. Leaving all of you in that bunker was a bad call. And before that—“ Before that, Steve should have taken care of his son. He should have done more to repair their relationship. He’d been told in clinical tones the exact content of James’ outburst by an overly calm (and thus, furious) Bruce. But there were some things you didn’t burden your children with. “—Before that, there was plenty I could have done to prevent this situation. Plenty I
“What do you mean ‘where do we stand’, Capsicle? We stand at the crossroads of ‘completely fucked’ and ‘totally fucked’ just like we did the last time we had a little team get together,” Tony said. Steve frowned at the nickname but he had to admit that Tony had a point, vulgarity aside. They were still between a rock and a hard place.
“These aren’t my dogs, Tony,” Other Fury said slowly. She could see his eye scanning the situation, and lingering on her. She kind of wished she’d had time to fix her hair. She couldn’t look intimidating, so she settled for bored. Sometimes bored was intimidating, and Tony figured that this was one of those times. “Look around, you recognize anyone?” Other Tony looked around. His cocky stance shifted slightly, almost into a fighting stance.
“Almost done?” Tony asked. Kate’s job was a very difficult one—not only had she had to get past her mother’s pass codes to get them into her lab, but she had to decrypt all of the programming that controlled the suits which would, with Tony’s biometrics, automatically bar him from piloting one. After that she would have to reset bits of the codes to allow Tony to pilot, and also to make up for his lack of Extremis. Tony wasn’t entirely sure she could do it in five
of his own. His right was occupied with yanking the gun from Thug #3 with another string. Peter jumped down from the rafters, using a new strand to slow his descent and swing him towards Thug #3 once more. He hit him full on the chest with both of his feet, and this time when the bald guy went down, he didn’t get back up. The girl, Thug #2, had not escaped her webbing—she still struggled in the bonds. Peter ran to James, his heart in his throat.
“It’s a gateway between worlds. Or, it will be. I saw it in Antonella’s private lab at SI. I only got a quick look, but it was enough to get the basic structure of the thing—problem is, I don’t know
“There’s ABCs in it,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve had alphabet soup since I was six.” He picked up the spoon and took a gulp, but he wasn’t really tasting it. What he did taste was tinny. He put the spoon back down and went back to mindlessly watching the movie. It was stupid and cheerful and hopeful and everything the kids needed just then. He felt a warm hand on his shoulder, and he turned his gaze to Steve.
too old for that, so.” Peter headed to the cabinet, getting out floor, sugar, a mixing bowl and some measuring spoons. Kate strolled along with his story, gathering eggs and butter and milk from the fridge. It took a few moments for the MCU Avengers to gather their wits about them, but then they started their game again, playing with a dampened enthusiasm. It was strange, Peter thought, to for once be the intruders rather than the intruded-upon. The Alts were obviously uncomfortable as Kate and Peter bickered comfortably about what kind of cookies to make. They eventually decided on chocolate chip—one couldn’t go wrong with chocolate chip—and set out to making the batter. No conversation of note took place with the Alts while they were present, and Peter was surprised that Kate had gone along with his story and not headed back upstairs. When the first batch was put in the oven, Peter turned and watched the Alts for a second. They had switched from Kemps to Euchre at some point, though Peter was pretty certain that only Clint knew the rules and everyone else was just wandering baffled through the game.
“Tell Dad—tell Dad I forgive him. Forgave him a long time ago,” James murmured. Peter’s heart leapt in panic.
“And it’s permanent?” Mom asked. “Bruce thinks it’s permanent?” She let him go, but only just. She still held onto his shoulders gently.
“Hence your solution is to get everyone drunk together and spilling heinous dirty secrets,” Steve said with a small upward quirk to his mouth. Tony grinned.
“Do you have any emergency medical training?” Bruce asked Peter. The kid was wide-eyed and pale and probably had an injury or two of his own. He shook his head vigorously. Bruce replaced Peter’s hands with his own on James’ bleeding gut. “Then go find me someone who does. Quickly.” Peter darted up onto two feet and ran off and was back not but a second later with Azari.
“Oh yes, Steven, yes,” Antonella replied with a grin. “Friday! This Friday we’ll pull something together. Leave it to
to him. Input was great, input was useful—arguments rarely were. Tony, of course, did not take kindly to his frown.
right now.” She jerked her head towards the house. “They’re just so….” She sighed, unable to find the descriptor she was looking for. “Mom’s a perfectionist. Dad’s got expectations so big I’m pretty sure God is thinking of striking them down like the tower of Babel lest they
“Ma’am?” Other Steve inquired. It wasn’t a concerned tone, more a prompting one. Tony wasn’t used to that, and she wasn’t used to the formality, and all she wanted in that moment was her husband.
“Well, your Daddy is right, don’t ever repeat it,” James said, putting aside his soup and pulling the little boy up onto his lap. “He’s also a hypocrite. You can tell him I said that.”
“The fuck are you sketching, anyway?” she asked. He looked up at her, a bit startled by the question. He nodded to the tree.
“Oh,” she said. She reached out and touched the back of his hand, and he immediately turned it over and laced his fingers with hers.
But he didn’t move. He stood there, his heart pounding and his mind racing, until he heard the shower turn off. A few moments later, Steve emerged, toweling off his hair but lacking towels in any other locations. The second Steve saw him, he yelped and rectified the situation, wrapping his towel around his waist.
paid off; thankfully evasive and offensive moves came to her as a second nature now. That was good since Kate wasn’t thinking anymore.
“I kind of like Peter the Loser,” Kate said. “He’s always been a really good person. And a good brother.”
, she thought, almost scornfully, but whether she was scornful of Francis or herself, she couldn’t tell anymore. Maybe it was both. She moved to get up, to get away, but he gently took hold of her upper arm.
like she could use a bit of sleep, which was unusual for her. It was difficult to look intimidating with your hair down and messy and slowly forming bags under your eyes from lack of sleep. Well, she’d just have to do her best.
like you should have in the first place, then—” Kate knew exactly what came after that, and so did Clint, without Kate ever needing to voice it:
“Director, Doctor Richards could not be reached,” JARVIS spoke. Tony felt her anger spike. No, she definitely wasn’t going to make dinner. Obviously, this person from an alternate universe with a cosmic cube was out to ruin her night.
“Fine, fine. Ok, uh…Never have I ever had a dick in my mouth,” Clint said. All the women groaned and grabbed for their shot glasses—as did Steve and Other Tony and, a bit reluctantly, Other Steve. She noticed the Alts staring at her husband and Other Steve incredulously. Her own Steve raised an eyebrow at the stunned expressions and just shrugged as Other Steve tried unsuccessfully to fight back a blush. Oh, how that brought Tony back every time.
“Fine you two; keep it to a little static shock,” Dad said, relenting. “Nothing remotely dangerous, understood?” Azari nodded. Torrun smiled. Peter shuddered. He’d been on the receiving end of Azari’s shocks before—‘static’ level or not (a description which Peter had to mental scold his father for—didn’t he know how dangerous static shock could actually get, like on other planets?) and it was never a pleasant experience.
“The hell HAPPENED out there?” James roared into the comm. Kate had never heard her brother quite so angry, and that was saying something. He’d gotten angry plenty when they were younger.
“If you require use of a lab, you can join Jane at Stark Tower in Manhattan,” mature Tony had replied unsympathetically.
“Organic webbing,” Peter said, matter-of-fact. “Should be stronger than steel, pretty damn sticky, and dissolve after a few hours.”
I fucked up, but—” it was obvious from her broken tone that Antonella was struggling to keep it together.
“We weren’t certain how they would react to a request to meet with you, and it seemed to be best to be honest about who we were meeting. They’d find out afterwards anyway, and then they’d be doubly suspicious,” Hill defended. Clint could see her grip on Coulson’s hand tighten. Coulson, however, ever a rock, did not move a muscle.
“I like these too.” Steve was startled as 3490 Tony took a seat on the bench next to him. It took him several moments before he even realized what she was talking about. Her gaze was on the shrub directly in front of them. It still had pretty pink flowers, despite the temperature.
“That’s fine. I just need somebody to hold him down. I didn’t want Peter to do it,” Bruce said. Azari’s lips thinned to a tight, hard line, but he nodded. “All the blood’s pooling by that leg. I need to do in-line traction to get circulation going, and then we have to stop that bleeding. Peter’s done a decent job of bandaging with that web but that’s not going to help for much longer.” Already the web was dyed a deep, dark red that Bruce didn’t like the look of. “Ready?” Azari nodded. He took over with one hand to keep pressure on the puncture wound—bullet, Bruce guessed, and he didn’t have time at the moment to flip James over and see if it had gone cleanly through or if it was still inside doing damage—and one arm holding his upper body down to provide Bruce something to pull against.
There was silence once again, and Francis held his breath. He had no idea which way this crowd was going to go. He was afraid that they were all about to shrug and head back inside the boardinghouse. For a second, Francis thought that their whole trip would have been a waste. But then Ava Ayala stepped forward.
“But he’s an excellent lip reader. We’re in sight of his table. It would be difficult to do from this far, but it’s not entirely implausible that he could still be listening in, so to speak,” Hill remarked. She had finally let go of Coulson’s hand all together, choosing instead to hold her glass of wine. She took a sip.
Finally they reached the river. Natasha glanced over to James, wondering what the boy had in mind. It was odd; he was only a few years younger than the Steve she knew, and yet he was plainly still a child. That was the effect of war she supposed. She wondered if the boy captain would still be a child at the end of these battles. Already he looked more worn than he had upon their first meeting.
“Woah, ok,” James said, wrapping his towel around his waist. He walked over to Peter and patted his back gently as Peter coughed and heaved violently. “Easy. Don’t hurt yourself.”
, Tony,” Steve replied. Stark looked at him for a moment, considering. Then he held out his hand, and nodded.
“Yeah, I think we’re done,” Steve said. There wasn’t much they could say within the Mansion, anyway, even if they had something to say about everything that had just happened. Thor left, and Clint and Natasha did as well, speaking quietly to one another, their heads close. Steve stood as well.
“We need to follow our orders this time, Kate,” Alt Steve said reasonably, but he looked like he was swallowing a lemon.
the helicarrier, Tony only knew what about fifteen of them actually did. Sometimes she wondered if Hill had hired the rest for aesthetics. Tony approached the central controls, quickly glancing over the basic stats of the ship before looking out the vast glass windows before her. The sun was setting, throwing a beautiful orange and pink hue over the whole of the glittering ocean. Tony wasn’t one to wax poetic, but she
“They want to gain our trust,” Natasha repeated, her eyes intent on all of them. “Maybe they have good intentions, maybe not. We don’t know, we
ungrateful to her—didn’t he see that she was sacrificing time with me so that he could have a chance?” James could not lather on the sarcasm any harder as he spat back things his mother had told him over the years. “You’re so right, Peter. I still have a fucking mother. Lucky fucking me.”
. And sure, Kate’s got daddy’s super soldier genes and goes to—what did they call it? Avengers Academy? Some freaky school for wannabe superheroes? It sounds intense—anyway even though she’s got powers and training, and ditto for the James kid, Peter
“No, you’re right,” Cap said. “Get off the roof, Iron Man, and tell me when you’re clear a hundred feet or more.”
“Not since I was thirteen, Pops,” James said. Peter groaned internally. Every time he brought out ‘Pops’ instead of ‘Dad’ or even ‘Sir’ or ‘Commander’, it was a bad sign. It meant James was
! Tony had no idea what it meant, but it shut them both up. The momentary silence was almost more painful as Antonella’s little gasping sobs were more apparent. The irregularity of the sound betrayed her attempts to compose herself.
“Good,” double Pepper said, looking amused. She locked her gaze on Pepper, who felt suddenly like a deer in headlights. “I’d hate to have give my condolences to you.”
—so my double clearly has tech that works at a microscopic level. Well. I went out to a bar. I guess she got worried and decided to look me up and check in—thing of it is, I didn’t have my phone on me. I checked my clothes—nothing. I slit open the credit card she gave me, but there was no unusual tech inside and I hadn’t swiped it once that evening. So either she managed to track my movements through a ridiculous number of cameras across several hours’ timeframe in a matter of seconds, or she’s got trackers inside of us, and fuck knows what else,” Tony said. He took a chicken salad sandwich and bit into it. Steve sipped at his sprite. The others followed suit fairly well, keeping up their picnic cover despite the situation.
worried about James. He had no idea how anyone could take a beating like that and still get up from it. That super soldier serum was potent stuff. Tony felt a bit bad for snapping at Steve when the other man pulled his hand away.
“You may not be our Tony, but I see your cleverness remains the same,” Thor spoke, leveling Tony with a measured gaze. “This is what my mother theorized. If the space stone could open into another universe, it would have to switch places with the one that already existed there. It might not be in the same
“Spaghetti! I’m making spaghetti and meatballs for dinner,” Tony replied. Ah, well, that was all right then. It was the only dish Tony could in fact make, and Tony didn’t just
,” Azari said with sudden venom as he shot up to a standing position. Blue lightning shot above Bruce’s head. He heard a thump as a body hit the floor behind him. Azari squatted back down. Bruce was vaguely aware of the fact that the shouting had gotten much more distant—the avengers and their young defenders had pushed the AIM group back outside. There was little else Bruce could do in the middle of this dank hallway with no equipment to speak of. He looked at Azari.
“No it’s not,” Kate interjected. Both men turned to stare at her. She shrugged. “I’d rather this get taken care of before the mansion gets blown up. Again. I can get you a shield and you a suit. I’ll help you out, but you’ve got to promise me something first.”
There was no great embrace, no passionate kiss. After a few heavily emotional moments, Steve kissed his wife’s cheek gently, and they moved the presents he’d brought to a spot under the tree. They didn’t have long until the start of the party, so Tony had to spend her time redoing her make-up while Steve set up the refreshment table. There would be time for great declarations later. Much later, after the wounds had healed, after they’d worked through the things they’d said, perhaps with some professional help. There would be time for Tony to tell Steve about the secret perched on the tip of her tongue—the morning, perhaps, almost like a Christmas gift. They would have time for passionate embraces and the stuff that romance novels were made up of. But for the moment, they could not concern themselves with that. For the moment, it was enough to hold a temporary truce, enough to spend time with family and be together for the holiday.
But here was a version of her father only two years out from everything. Here he was, taken out of the nightmare and then thrown into perhaps two more—first into the future and now into an alternate universe. She guessed that was why he always looked so pained in the serious, quiet moments. Kate knew that her own father was a man who carried a lot of weight on his shoulders, and she doubted this version was any different. But she wondered if he might be more willing to open up, being so close to events. Alt Steve shrugged and lifted his hands a little helplessly.
“So. We tagged you all. With nanites,” 3490 Steve said. He took a seat in the only available armchair as the older kids and 3490 Avengers stood around.
going to be a trick. Tony bit the inside of her lip. She didn’t know what she wanted to do about that just yet. Now really wasn’t a good time, what with everything happening with Peter, the Alts constantly around, Kate acting out and getting bad grades, James about to ship off overseas…No, now was the worst time, but she had no idea when a better time was going to come along, and she couldn’t exactly just hand him a baby one day.
“Leave him alone, Jamie,” Kate said. She didn’t sound particularly bothered, and went straight back to reading her documents. Peter wasn’t sure if he was grateful for his sister’s intervention or embarrassed by it. ”He gets enough shit at school.”
, Kate,” he said emphatically when he finally let her go. “And I’m proud of you. I want you to know that.”
“One minute,” Steve said quietly. He slowly drew his gun from the strap on his ankle. Another groan, louder this time and yes, that was definitely Senator Stark. Steve inched toward the nearest door, where the groans came from. Quickly he opened the door, one hand still holding out his gun. The door to the coat closet flew open, revealing Stark—but his face was not one of pain, rather ecstasy, and it was obvious as to why—the naked man on top of him as well as his own naked self was a big hint. Tony let out another moan as the naked man sucked on his neck, but then he opened his eyes and saw the Agent.
“Yes,” James said. “I have a—uh—announcement to make.” He took a deep breath, which made Steve’s stomach flip. James was nervous about whatever news it was—that couldn’t be good. “I’ve got my orders. I’m shipping out three months from Friday.”
,” Mom breathed out. She got up and hugged him tight, which was weird. Mom was affectionate but she wasn’t really the hugging type; that was Dad’s thing. “We—we need to get you to a hospital, make sure everything will be ok—maybe SHIELD medical—I’ll call Bruce—”
—except for the fact that there were a few triceratops wandering around and one particularly vicious T-Rex. At least, Kate thought it was a t-rex. It looked like one, but she wasn’t an expert. She was sure she would call it a Tyrannosaurs Rex and then later be corrected by Peter, ever the nerd, with some obscure and unpronounceable name that the creature
“Jamie?” his father whispered from the bed, and James realized that he’d been late to this idea. There on either side of his dad were Kate and Peter. Peter had genuinely passed out. Kate had one eye peeked open to see him come through the door, but it fluttered shut again as James came inside and shut the door.
“This is weird, right?” Tony asked, finally breaking the damn of tension in the room with his dry statement.
Steve’s wrists were chafing. He was bound by adamantium, and he couldn’t move at all. He was on his knees. This was not, Steve thought, the first time that this universe had done this. They were in an armored SHIELD truck, going somewhere, though Steve didn’t know where. He wasn’t sure that he wanted to.
“Do you really want to?” Tony murmured, pulling back and looking his Captain in the face. It was a young face. Tony paused for a brief moment to wonder about the morality of getting into this with someone who was simultaneously decades older than him and decades younger, but then Steve’s eyes went dark and his lips came crashing down and then there wasn’t any verbal conversation at all.
, suborder lacertilia—this is a more complicated genetics project, using what we learned from the spiders to attempt to combine spider and mouse DNA and regrow limbs…” As the group passed, Peter brought up his camera.
“Yeah,” Peter said, not sounding particularly convinced. He looked at her and raised an eyebrow. “Why are you dressed like a witch?”
“It’s only three days max, then we move to the next one,” James said. “We’ll fit until then. It’s not going to be comfortable, but we’ll make it work.”
“Give me five minutes,” James said. Kate left the room and James quickly changed before meeting her in the hall. “So am I driving?”
“I did! I do! Give me two seconds,” Tony said. She turned back to Dum-E with the iron. His hand whirred again, but only moments later she pulled away and closed the flap with a satisfying snap. She took a screwdriver to put the panel back in place. “No more smoothies, Dum-E.” The little bot whirred again and wheeled away. James gave the bot a pat as it passed him.
“I didn’t,” Steve said. “Your double did. She was looking for your input on something—you weren’t picking up your phone, so she called Bruce, figured you’d be at the lab with him, but he said you’d left hours ago—she got concerned, tracked you down. I thought she was going to send someone to fetch you, so I offered to come talk to you and make sure you were all right. What?” Tony had gone stiff as a board. He put his hands in his pants pockets, then took them out. He checked his jacket pockets and removed his wallet. He threw a bunch of bills on the bar—more than enough to cover his drink, Steve’s, and the tip.
“Nah,” Antonella replied, and Tony looked up at her in confusion. “Not more. Just sooner.” She finished her second glass. “You all are just starting out, Tony. But that means you’ve got years and years ahead of you to work it all out.” She picked up the bottle. “Sure you don’t want any?”
scary, realistically James knew that if it came to a fight, he would lose. That just pissed him off even more.
“Hey I could be wrong but seems like the beeping metal disc one of these guys just dropped could be a
“You have earned my trust, the team’s trust,” Commander Rogers replied. Natasha nodded in agreement behind him. “We hope we’ve earned yours.” The MCU team regarded one another. James could clearly see the Steve and Tony of the alternate team having a quick, silent conversation.
“Did you…did you want to talk about it?” Stark asked. Steve noted with amusement that the man looked horribly uncomfortable—about as uncomfortable, Steve figured, as he himself did around weeping women.
“Well, we have enough problems to warrant it,” he answered. “And when we don’t? Sometimes it’s nice to let another team take care of the problem. We don’t exactly lead normal lives, but we couldn’t have even any
This was somehow a lot less than what Peter had always envisioned and expected. This felt like…well, like high school, all over again, if the teachers cared a bit less. He didn’t know what he had expected exactly. Shiny desks and eager students? Enthusiastic professors? Interesting new material every week? He definitely expected more of what had gone on that morning—great scrimmages and practical training. He knew that was still something they would be getting to—he just hoped it would be better than the classroom. Eventually a bell rang and everyone left before Dr. Pym even dismissed them.
“I got misidentified, too,” Bruce said sympathetically. “She’s beautiful, their daughter. She’s beautiful and bright and she laughs just like Betty. She thought I was him at first. But he knew—their son. Benjamin. He knew instantly. He’s smart too. Dry wit. I like them both. Good kids, you can tell. They had them before—before everything. Good kids. Normal kids.” He stopped.
“Uh-huh, whatever, just play lookout for a minute,” Tony said, looking over the insides. He saw a tell-tale blue and something in the pit of his stomach dropped.
“Is that what you told Tony when you walked out a week ago?” James asked coldly. Dad’s jaw went tight, and Peter felt another flare of anger. He kept his mouth shut, but it was a struggle. How could he bring this up
And he realized, in that moment, that for the first time in a long time, he actually wasn’t looking towards the past—he was staring into his future, what might be his future, and he was ready to forge ahead.
“Every one of these kids but Francis has some form of super strength and super healing,” Dad said. “Nobody’s using full power in here—just keep those shocks to a minimum. If anything looks like it’s getting out of hand, we’ll call it. If you call down a lightning strike that’s too strong, I’m sure Torrun will take care of it. Won’t you, Torrun?” Torrun nodded. Thor did not look completely appeased, but he nodded reluctantly.
Pretty soon, Natasha walked over to them and said: “Hey guys, it’s time for bed. We got to keep moving tomorrow.”
Shadows: It’s pup time! Emmie did a lot of research for this chapter and it’s sooooo good! Give it a read. Enjoy!!
Emmie: Thanks for reading this fic, it’s been quite a journey to write this with Shadows. Maybe we’ll do another fic together someday. Enjoy! My song for this chapter is
“He’s unmated. What claim do you have?” snarled the other Alpha who was dark in color. He too crouched down and prepared to pounce.
As soon as he gets down the stairs into the main lobby, there’s a dog barking that Anthony sees that looks like his dog that died recently.
“Hey there little Omega, you look a little lost there.” said the Alpha as he backed Tony into a corner
“Alright guys, the final round of the game.” Happy said as he drew a black card from the top of the deck. Flipping over the card, Happy reads the following “Me Tarzan, You, _____.” As soon as Happy put down the black card, Rhodey, Tony, and Pepper start looking through their deck of white cards for the perfect card. As Happy waited for them to play their cards, each of them let out some hard laughs, probably indicating that they’d found the perfect card to play. As they set their cards down in a pile, Happy takes them and starts shuffling them.
“But Steve, there’s something that I want to do. Since you wanted to treat me like I’m a rare jewel, I want to do something for you.” Tony said as he slid down on his knees and looked up at Steve from where he was on the floor.
“I guess I wanted to be prepared just in case,” Tony answered. It might have been Steve’s own hopeful optimism, but Tony didn’t sound as distant as he had when they first arrived. “And there’s one other thing.” He hit another button and another panel slid back, revealing Steve’s shield. Tony picked it up and held it up to Steve. Steve’s breath hitched. He didn’t think he’d ever see it again. And yet, he was hesitant to take it.
The fight got violent quickly. Sounds of swords clashing can be heard very clearly and the sounds of agony are heard as people are being cut, stabbed, and mortally wounded. Steve then has his eyes set on King Howard, who sees him as well. They charged at each other knowing that this could very well be the deciding factor in the battle.
Emmie: New chapter guys, enjoy some drama that will happen which includes someone returning from earlier in this fic. Here’s the song for this chapter:
Tony gave him a quick nod. “Cap,” He replied, giving a closed-off expression. It was the same kind of tone he used when they first met, back when they had been little more than work colleagues. Maybe that was all Tony thought of Steve now. “At least, I assume you’re Cap, underneath all that facial hair.” Tony’s eyes lingered on Steve’s beard, and there was a look in them that Steve couldn’t quite read. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought there was...a hunger there.
For all intents and purposes, Tony should have been treated like a prince. He was the only pup of an older couple who had struggled for years. To the disappointment of his father Howard, Tony was born as an Omega. Howard was hoping that his first offspring would have been an Alpha or Beta. After Tony was born, Howard and his wife Maria were told that their chance of having another child was slim to none.
After the meeting, everyone heads off with Steve and Tony heading in the direction of their bedroom.
Well now Steve knew what that fight was about. “Actually I think it’s already here. We just fought off some aliens who were after Vision”
“I see...let me see if he has any injuries.” the healer said as he walked over to Tony and began to look over him. The healer then started to look over Tony in general before moving on to inspecting each of his limbs before finally taking a look at his head.
Steve lends out a finger which results in one of the butterflies landing on it. “Lend out your finger my dear.” He says to which Tony obliges and watches in aw as the butterfly flew from Steve’s finger to his.
Tony really ended up bonding with his new pack quite well. The way they cared for him after they found him in the snow was something completely different than what he felt in his birth pack.
“So Tony, there’s a group of other wolves that are in my pack and I would like for you to meet them. What do you think?” said Steve as both of them backed away from each other.
“Come by to practice any time. The Lang/Van Dyne family’s always got your back, you know that.” Scott said as he held Cassie close.
Tony led them inside, with Steve right behind. Natasha followed Steve, while Wanda & Sam helped prop up Vision while they led him in. Rhodey was already there, as was another man that Steve thought he had seen somewhere before but had never met. He had a rather elaborate piece of jewelry around his neck, along with a long red cape that seemed to move on its own.
Shadows: Well, that’s it. That’s the story! Thank you all for reading and all your kind comments. This was a blast to write with Emmie. It’s been quite the journey, hasn’t it? This was my first time writing a true sequel to something. I don’t count all the add on one-shots and such for MTHS since they all take place during the main story. Thank you all so much for all the love this series has gotten. It means a lot. If you liked my style of writing, feel free to check out my other fics. I’ve got a thunderiron one going on right now and a winteriron one in the works and a few one-shots. Thank you all so much for the support. This is Shadows, signing off.
“I wanted to look around the forest and then I saw this wolf on one of the cliffs nearby. Didn’t get to talk to him but he looked beautiful. Had this amazing golden coat of fur.” said Tony as he got right next to Rhodey.
Steve led Anthony over to a chair in the corner of the room and sat down in it while pull Tony in his lap to face him.
Hey guys! Can you believe that there's one more chapter after this? It's crazy to me. After I get the last chapter done, I'm taking a break from writing so I can wind down after dedicating myself to writing this multi-chapter fic when I'm used to doing one-shots.
After just hearing Steve yell, Tony is shocked and backs away from him out of mild fear. After just realizing what he had done, Steve lowers his head in shame before getting close to Tony.
Steve then pulled away from Anthony and looked at him in the eyes, doing that made it feel like such a tender moment between them.
After finalizing some other things with the council, Steve then called his army for an emergency meeting.
All the pups nodded and curled up around their parents. They knew that they were loved and protected with them. Nobody could hurt them as long as their Mom and Dad had their back. They’d figure out how to fix this together. Always together.
“We must get dressed Tony, there’s much that we have to do before the wedding aside from planning.”  Steve said as he gestured for Tony to get off of his lap.
After Steve’s parents were killed in the explosion of their house, he wondered if he would ever have a family again. Now that he found his mate, he couldn’t wait to have a family but was sad by the fact that his mom and dad were not around to be able to meet his future pups. So in his mind, he had thought of the idea of naming one of his future pups after his mom: Sarah.
“You ever think about being a parent?” Steve asked Tony one afternoon. They were in the common area of the compound, watching a movie.
“It’s about time you become useful to this pack. You’ve sat around for too long. It’s time you pulled your weight.” spoke Howard and Tony wanted to argue. He wasn’t useless and he sure didn’t sit around. He did all the cooking, cleaning, and sewing for the pack. But he knew it was useless to argue with Howard. The last time he did he ended up hungry and with whip marks down his back.
“They didn’t say anything about Anthony. Isn’t he competing?” A customer said to Maria, Anthony’s mother.
Steve laughed and leaned over to kiss Tony as well he could with babies in each of their arms. His eyes caught the rings on each of their fingers as he drew back. Symbols of the love he and Tony had for each other. And now they had two daughters as a result of that love and the promise they had made to each other.
“FALL IN!” James’ voice interrupted through her own earpiece. Kate was tempted to remind him that there was no reason to damage everyone’s ear drums, they could hear him
when it was 3490 Steve. It was like Tony had contracted amnesia and conveniently forgotten all the deep conversations he’d ever had with the man. It was an unsettling feeling, to have someone know things about you that you had never given them permission to know. Other than that, one other thing stuck out in Tony’s brain.
Steve’s words roared in Tony’s ears, and he shook his head in denial. This was a terrible plan. A no good, very bad, horrible plan. Tony was the last person on
“Hey, maybe you could ease up a little there, Dad,” James said. “Kid’s had his ass kicked every day at school as long as I can remember. A little revenge is a natural reaction, don’t you think? I mean hell, what’s your damn
. He opened up the back door and rushed inside. He went up the stairs to Kate and Peter’s room. He knew exactly which teddy was Teddy for Kate. It was a mangy looking thing with one eye and a little black mask. It had been James’ once upon a time, and before that James thought it was his dad’s. He wasn’t sure. He grabbed Teddy and rushed back down the stairs. He was in the kitchen when he heard the door open.
“I am,” she said quietly. “I’m afraid to look back on everything and—I’ve done so much wrong. I’ve wasted so much of my life to now. I’m afraid of wasting the rest of it.”
Tony since then, but he hadn’t exactly looked for opportunities to be with the other man alone, either. But now Tony looked at him, something different in his gaze.
“Or is it a girlfriend? Tell me you’ve got one of those. You have to have one by now it’s been…what, a year since I asked you last? It’s of your secret girlfriend, isn’t it?”
!” Steve said, a blush coloring his face. “What are you doing in here? Is everything ok?” Tony took a breath and shook his head.
.” But Peter couldn’t be sure. The bald guy lunged for him, but Peter just sidestepped the burly guy. Peter put on the safeties, webbed the guns and secured them to a wall with another shot of web. Before either of the AIM agents could make a break for them, Peter webbed them too.
anything. But it didn’t matter what he did or didn’t realize; it didn’t change the fact that he still could do nothing but stare.
been through hell in the past, I know that sometimes everyday is a struggle for you, and I could believe that you could slip up and make a bad decision, and I could forgive you for that, because we’re
“What are you doing here, Natasha?” Steve asked. Natasha had a look of cold professionalism that he’d seen on her one too many times. It meant that she was pissed off.
“And, there’s one other thing,” the Commander said. He pulled a shiny metal circle out of his pocket—perhaps a brooch or a medal or some kind. He tossed it onto the kitchen table. Natasha heard Steve’s intake of breath. He knew that symbol. So did Natasha. “Found this on one of the agents. Could be nothing. Could just be that one guy. Or it could point us to exactly who is behind this.”
“Well, I wouldn’t have to do this if you would stop trying to make me smoothies and then spill them all over yourself,” Tony stated. The bot’s hand whirred again and beeped as if in protest. “I can take care of
Steve had gone to the hospital alone. He found Bruce outside the OR, his blood pressure getting up too high because no one would let him in despite the fact that
