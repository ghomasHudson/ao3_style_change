“What man?” John asked, too quickly. “What did he look like?”
He sits carefully, waiting until he can think rationally about this. Once he’s worked it through, he gets up calmly and goes downstairs. Sherlock is in the bedroom, resting after a particular convoluted and energetic case of drug smuggling. The time spent in the meat locker had been particularly exhausting for them both.
He trails off, and Sherlock blinks rapidly, eyes scanning. "When?" he asks innocently, thinking it must have to do with Afghanistan.
“Then what are you doing? What is… all this?” he gestures, indicating the retrofitted tanker as a whole.
He watches as John surveys the space. Gone are the shelves and the hood and the lab bench John had put in as a gift to him when he'd given up his room. There's no trace of human or animal remains, except for some fancifully taxidermied bunny rabbits in hats, and the only poisons left to be seen are those depicted in the colorful mobile hanging over the beautifully carved wooden cot - family heirloom, wrested from Mycroft by physical force - in which Rosie is sleeping.
know? John risked a lot for him, regularly, without appearing to think much about it. Not to mention all the general taking-care-of he did on a daily basis. Sherlock did try to show that he was grateful, but the truth was he often failed to notice entirely, and when he did notice he usually failed spectacularly in his attempts at gratitude. John did not seem to mind this, aside from what he interpreted at good natured grumbling, but he began to be worried that perhaps John’s view of their situation was different than his.
"Mycroft keeps me informed. I'm impressed you managed to orchestrate something so elaborate so quickly after regaining your freedom."
Sherlock pushes through the fog to the lab in his mind palace and finds it mostly clear and workable. He moves quickly inside of it, breaking down every chemical from both compounds, reassembling them, reacting them with other chemicals until something starts to happen.
Without intent, Sherlock finds himself moving back to John and then halting, several times before he manages to still. He forces his body to stand obedient, several feet away, and yet he can feel his whole self inclining towards the doctor.
SHERLOCK. WHAT I DID YESTERDAY. THE PERSON THAT I WAS YESTERDAY. IT WASN'T OKAY. IT SCARED ME. I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE THAT PERSON AGAIN.
“Oh yes, it was
“And before me, he talked to his skull.”
"Go on, then. I've had at least as much practice as you. Who knows, one of us might even like it." She leans back in the chair and stretches out her bare legs. "Come now, Doctor. I've not hidden anything from you, at least not when it comes to Sherlock. You could do me the same courtesy. We might even find common ground. Is that so strange?"
"You're saying," he says slowly, like he can't quite believe what he's heard. "That when you were a child you had a friend - a best friend - with the same name as me, with red hair like mine, and that your...very troubled...six-year-old sister killed him and then was locked away permanently. But you had no conscious memory of this, of either of them, for years?"
“John!” he hollers. “Get your coat, there’s a body in the morgue with our name on it!”
He wakes some hours later, startled to find himself on the floor with Sherlock until the memory comes back. It is still dark. He panics briefly until he can assure himself that Sherlock is only sleeping, deeply but naturally. With difficulty he gets up and goes into the bathroom. His hands and arms are covered in blood, both his own and Sherlock’s, and there is a wildly purpling bruise in the crook of his left elbow.
The counterfeit case, though, that might have legs. The fact that either Ms. Mihov had managed to extricate herself from the charges or that Moriarty had arranged for it himself meant that she was more talented and more important than most of the other petty criminals that Moriarty had helped elevate. Most of those he cut lose easily at the first hint of trouble. The fact that she had vanished rather than turning up dead suggested that she had power or knowledge or both, and enough of it to protect herself.
“No,” John says, scrambling to his feet, unable to bear the sight of her any longer, queasy in her very presence. “No, don’t… don’t you ever speak to me again! Do you understand me? I don’t want to see or hear from you ever again. You’re a disgrace.”
“Lied to me,” John snaps, and instantly regrets it. Victor knows Sherlock was for real as well as he does. He’s on John’s side, and Sherlock’s. “Sorry, I just…”
He examines what Sherlock was last working on, paired photos of the victims and the intended suspects. The man’s handwriting is a disaster but John has mostly learned to decipher it. There are strings running crosswise between the eight individuals.
They break apart and fall to the duvet, hot, sweaty, panting, but keeping fingers and legs in contact, afraid if they stop touching the moment will be gone somehow. John has never felt so completely used up and so completely fulfilled at the same time. He feels his heart swell with emotion, but says nothing, only lazily traces patterns on Sherlock’s forearm.
“Why is she in love with me? I think I’ve made it perfectly clear that I do not reciprocate any feelings she may have in that area.”
, do you even understand that? You knew what might happen, you could have shared it with me, you could have warned me, we could have made a plan together. But you cared more about beating him than you did about me!"
Sherlock gives an amused rumble, smiling but not opening his eyes. “Come now, John.
John has nothing to say to that and Mycroft continues, “As the only immediately family of my brother’s very dear…friend… Harriet merits attention. You may rest assured that I will alert you if there is any crisis you should be aware of.”
John laughed, and smoothed the damp locks off Sherlock’s forehead. “No, I suppose I’m not,” he conceded.
It can’t go on. It does go on. It goes on for a month. John hopes and prays Sherlock will pull out of it, that it’s just a matter of him needing time to recover from Irene’s death and resurrection, from whatever that meant to him. But nothing happens. John lets it continue far too long, even once he knows that if this new status quo is to change he’s going to have to be the one to knock it off balance.
"No," Sherlock says quickly. Then, quieter. "Possibly. Does that make any of my points less valid?"
There’s a strange feeling of purity to their lovemaking, a sort of innocence rarely captured in intimacy under any circumstances, much less by two people who have been through as many hells as Sherlock and John have. It feels like a holy act, like the consecration and consummation of everything they've been through together. Like being bound together in a way that's deeper, more earned, than it was before. A rebirth into a new life created solely for them, together.
John won’t meet his gaze, but says, “I just wanted to feel something, anything. Cocaine always seemed to do it for you, but it made me see things, see you, not like this, bloody on the pavement, falling through the air, and that was worse. So, I thought maybe if I found someone, I could close my eyes, and pretend, pretend for a moment that it was you, that I was with you, but…” he shook his head numbly.
Sherlock protests. “I didn’t say anything about marriage! It’s a partnership with certain state and legal benefits that would be advantageous to--”
Sherlock looks askance at him. “People? What people?”
The man wakes to the dark shadow of Sherlock perched above him on the arm of the sofa, fingers steepled, observing him unblinkingly. John kneels beside him, taking his pulse. He gives a sharp gasp and begins to hyperventilate again.
“Yeah, likely,” Greg agrees. “Unfortunately, that’s all I got for you. Except… funny, I just remembered this. The last text she sent from her mobile. When I was searching her, after you boys nabbed her, I saw her phone screen. Right before the whole thing wiped itself. It was just one word.
“I – what?”
The question is so utterly
He starts with John’s hair. Nuzzling it, breathing in the faintly herbal shampoo, running his hands through it methodically, feeling the length (a bit shaggy, due for a cut), recording the colour (light brown, nearly blonde, sandy, each strand variable), noting the texture (thick, pleasant to touch, wavy to curly around the ears and neck). Oh, there is so much here, how could he have missed it before, when it’s been sitting in front of him, living in his flat for more than a year?
“He’s a coward,” said Sherlock. “He’ll suffer more from the terror of thinking I will hunt him down again one day, than from anything you or I might actually do to him. And his fear will breed more fear. And if it comes to it, I
John grows cold inside but shakes his head. “I passed out, I’m sorry.”
“I need to talk to you.”
win – and Moriarty is dead or behind bars, then there will be nothing left to worry about. No reason we can’t…”
She raises an eyebrow, serene as ever. "So, I was right."
It hurts, to be considered a liability, a distraction. But at the same time John is touched, realising that Sherlock is admitting just how important John is to him.
“Don’t know yet. Now are you ever going to get us something to eat or do I have to miss tea as well?”
fascinating. Plus, those
“Arrogant prick.”
Lestrade laughed. “Like hell! You aren’t getting near him. We have enough to convict him and put him away for three lifetimes. I’m just here to get your statement.” He shifted uncomfortably. “And to, um…make sure you’re all right.”
John takes a deep breath. “No,” he says again, forcefully, twisting easily out of Sherlock’s grip and shoving him backwards. Sherlock stumbles, falls to the floor, and stays there, unmoving.
“Destroy this phone. Get the data off the drive and destroy it too. And for pity’s sake find a better cover than Wayward Youngest Son of Italian Businessman Sent to the North of France to Dry Out Where He Won’t Embarrass Anyone. Your Italian is ghastly and your skin won’t take the sun. Stick with the northern ethnicities.”
Sherlock’s thoughts swirled around in his head, forming ever tighter concentric circles. He had to solve it. He had to fix it. He had to find out what his heart was. But he didn’t have a heart, everyone said so. Even John. It must be a riddle. He hated riddles.
Sherlock was already running. Their quarry was gone now, but he barely noticed. He ran the length of the pier and dove into the water blindly, without even a second’s pause at the edge. His slim form broke the water cleanly and he swam down at the angle it appeared that John had fallen in. Where was he, where was he? Sherlock couldn’t make out anything in the inky black. He swam down further, kicking his shoes off, groping in every direction.
John shrugs. "Someone motivated might. And I'm guessing losing the information on it is more than an inconvenience to you."
"No."
"You turned your lab into a nursery." John seems to have fallen a little behind.
Molly looks disappointed when he arrives. “Sherlock not coming, then?”
Sherlock’s head snaps towards him. “Then let’s talk about what they didn’t take.” He towers over the smaller man. “They didn’t take your television, stereo, computer, antique end tables, original impressionist paintings, or even the secret and significant store of cash you keep in a condensed milk tin in the back of the icebox. What does that say to you?”
“Oh you know we are, honey. We work the same way. Granted I work at a
“Did Sherlock leave to…?” she asks tentatively and John nods. “Do you think we ought to…?
“He’s wrong much less often than any of us,” John says furiously. “So just this
“I’m not a genius, Greg,” he says at last. “I helped Sherlock, I know he worked better with me around, and I’m sure I learned from him. But something like this, with no evidence or leads either of us can discern… I don’t think I have prayer of untangling it without… I mean, on my own.”
And they keep doing it right until the moment John discovers an unconscious Sherlock on the floor of the woman’s bedroom and she flips out the window and evaporates, still naked except for the greatcoat,
He scowls. "And what should I take from the fact that my loving fiancée is so pleased that I'm finding myself in mortal danger?"
So little has changed about the flat that Sherlock could almost imagine he hadn’t been gone, if it weren’t for a musty, empty, unused feel about it. It seems darker and colder. John barely speaks to Sherlock, although he does, occasionally, stare hard at him, as if trying to remember who he is, what they were to each other. Sherlock tries to figure out what he needs, tries to give him space and time, but he is at a loss. Some days he thinks he should just leave, just get out of his way and let him go on with his life, but he doesn’t want to, and he worries that it might make things worse for John. He won’t go unless John tells him to, he decides.
“The case.” Sherlock had forgotten about it, but is now glad for something to take both their minds off the incidents of the previous evening. “Yes. Of course.”
John was sitting half-upright, leaning against the back of the hospital bed. His eyes were closed, but he opened them when he heard footsteps. He smiled with relief. “Sherlock!” he croaked, and cleared his throat. “Ahem. Sherlock. Sorry, bit dry in here. They said you were around here somewhere.”
He allowed the letters to rearrange themselves in his mind’s eye until at last they settled into a recognisable form.
Sherlock snaps to the laptop shut and jumps to his feet. “Don’t be ridiculous, John.”
"John, move away from me a bit," he says slowly, pushing him off. John does as he's told and Sherlock tries to focus.
Moriarty cocks his head in genuine confusion. "You couldn't have known. I changed everything. You were deaf and blind."
John gives him a quizzical look.
Sherlock shuts his book with clear annoyance. “Just a legal matter I have to finish dealing with.”
Sherlock is silent for a long time and John waits patiently, relieved for a break from talking and hoping his friend won’t require further explanation.
“Clothes!”
“I don’t really care what you need right now, Sherlock! Let’s talk about what I need. You remember that? Making me promise to tell you what I needed? Because you were
“What are you on about, John?” Sherlock finally focuses on him properly for the first time since he had tackled the murderer, just in time to turn the blade away from Sherlock’s heart.
“Abel?” She giggles as if the man himself is a joke. “No, he’s not in today – hardly anyone is. I could take a message, or you… could leave your phone number and I could call you up when he’s here. Or….some other time?”
“This Christmas,” John whispers around the elegant digit, “I want to fuck every last part of your body. Is that all right with you?”
"And you?"
“I don’t know what would happen if you left him, but I assume you don’t wish to find out any more than I do. He needs you John, even when he thinks he doesn’t. You do something for him that cases and cocaine and money and even a suitable audience can’t. You keep him
“We’ll have to take the risk. He won’t be safe in his house, and if he’s with us we can give him an alibi if we need to.”
“Of course I came for you. I left the instant Mycroft told me. I just wish I’d got here sooner.”
“Counterfeiting,” John says. “Of course. But don’t you need special inks as well? Those aren’t made here.”
“And what does this mean for you?” she ventured.
When Sherlock wakes John is no longer in range, but has covered him with a blanket and is, by the smell of things, making Sherlock's favourite blend of coffee. Sherlock fumbles his way to the kitchen until he's close enough to perceive his friend, who presses a steaming mug on him. Sherlock wraps both hands around it and perches on one of the chairs, blanket still around his shoulders.
"One shot. Directly to the brain. No second chances. Before they come and kill us. Or worse." John tells him. "It's the only way to be sure. Better than being captured. Trust me."
But it does not go on. For better or worse, Sherlock’s agents in disguise drag John off of him and bundle Sherlock away to the morgue and the moment is lost.
Once they recovered, the second and third times lasted much longer. They were more deliberate, taking time to fully and methodically explore one another with hands, lips, tongues, and cocks, investigating every possible way they could fit together. Sherlock was far from experienced, but at least in this department he was miles ahead of John, and John let him lead. He was surprisingly gentle at the right moments, despite being otherwise forceful and aggressive, years of celibacy making him greedy and determined to take every moment of pleasure there was to be had.
“Must mean something if that’s the text she sent right before she was arrested,” John points out.
"Don't tell me you haven't thought about it," Sherlock says sternly.
no one had bothered to tell Sherlock about it.
, keenly. Too keenly. You know she does. Remember the lab rat incident? She cried for weeks.” He sighs. “It doesn’t even matter if we let them date or not, it’s too late. Her heart is going to get broken. If not now, then soon enough.”
"What do you want me to do, John? Tell me, I'll do it. Do you want me to leave?"
“I…should go. I shouldn’t have left him this long, really.” She walked him to the door, and they stood uncomfortably in the passageway.
John looked at his friend with pity. It must be difficult to be tortured by your own mind, day in and day out. He’d had enough of a taste of that to know, and he was sure it wasn’t half of what Sherlock was going through. “Does it always take you like this? This isn’t a normal reaction.”
After a pause he says, a little stiffly, “Thank you, Greg. I do appreciate this. Really.”
Sherlock can feel the stubble growing in on his cheeks. It's like microscopic spiders crawling over his face. He shaves twice a day just to avoid the sensation, unless he's out on a case or undercover. Such activities make him forget about physical unpleasantnesses like facial hair, body odours, dirt, grime, and rough clothing against the skin, at least until they are over and his attention is no longer taken up entirely with the work.
By the fourth day, Sherlock was in bad shape. He was bruised head to toe, and was certain he had more than one cracked rib, as well as broken fingers and toes, several missing fingernails, two black eyes, and more shallow cuts than he could count. He knew he could not hang on much longer. He was beginning to hallucinate in his cell and suspected he had developed some kind of infection. He had begun thinking of ways to end it on his own in order to prevent Moran from having the satisfaction of beating him, but his cell was frustratingly bare and he was watched. He might be able to get one of the jumpier guards to shoot him, though, if he was smart about it.
John pauses too long. “In fact… your visual cortex is responding normally.”
“Sherlock,” he breathed. “He did it, didn’t he? He went halfway around the world and rescued you! God damn it, that bastard.”
It doesn’t help that Ms. Adler is one of the finest specimens of the female form he’s ever seen – and he’s seen a statistically significant sample. From her perfectly coiffed hair to her carmine lips to her flawless skin and breasts and hips and more, she is sex embodied, whispering and screaming at him, and John’s body is, unfortunately, listening. He shifts and futilely tries to will away any sign of interest or arousal, cursing his still-extant susceptibility to the fairer gender.
After inspecting the room scrupulously for any means of exit short of charging the guards, and satisfying himself that the cell was indeed inescapable given his current means, Sherlock resumed his perch on the so-called bunk and his thinking. It took everything in him not to pace or fidget, but he would not give whoever was watching the satisfaction. Instead he went to his mind palace and tried to fully explore every possible outcome of his current predicament.
“For a man otherwise not meticulous with his person – slightly mussed hair, two days growth of beard, clothes as before mentioned – he had perfectly manicured hands and extremely well-trimmed fingernails.”
"When did you start carrying all the time?" John retorts.
John shakes his head as if trying to clear it and failing over and over. "You're right. I can't last at this heightened state much longer. My heart...adrenaline is a poison you know." His breathing is labored, and Sherlock is glad he lacks the resources to consider what might be going on inside of John right now. "If they don't shoot me first, my own body will take me out. Either way, we've only got a few minutes. But you, genius, you didn't think about delivery method did you?"
And it works. Or very nearly. John feels better, ready to take the final step and ask Mary to be his wife. Amazingly, the anniversary seems to have inspired the press as well and investigative reports surface at last, clearing Sherlock of all wrongdoing. It's bittersweet, but once John is satisfied he's not about to be murdered as a result, it makes him feel even more confident in his decision. Like the burden of keeping Sherlock's memory is no longer just on him.
"Oh, I doubt that."
Sherlock puts his mouth to John’s ear while continuing his progress southward. “I
Molly has no answer for that, but she’s still fuming. He envies her righteous and futile rage at the injustice of it, her stubborn insistence that this is wrong and there’s another way out. He wishes he had the luxury of sharing it.
of it all the time. You’re better than that…and you let them diminish you,
Sherlock makes a face that indicates that he couldn’t agree less, and claps John on the shoulder. “Now,” he says brightly, rubbing his hands together. “Don’t you think it’s time we attended to the extremely dangerous and convoluted case of Mr. Abel Bryant and the Society for Ginger Advancement?”
He texts Lestrade quickly.
There is a long pause. At last John says, "No. No, I don't suppose that would help. Your bedroom is the same, I didn't touch anything." He turns his back on Sherlock and goes upstairs to his room without a word, leaving Sherlock standing in the sitting room, desolate.
“The strongest case against them will be if we wait until they’ve actually loaded the shipment into the lorry to stop them. John, you’ll follow the lorry when it comes. Once it’s in place, take out the driver and whoever is with him.”
! You just dismiss what we have like it’s
IT'S TWO AM, SHERLOCK. WE CAN'T JUST SPONTANEOUSLY POP IN FOR A QUICK ONE. NO ONE WHO CAN HELP US WILL BE THERE. I'LL SEND A MESSAGE TO MOLLY AND CAROLINE AND WE'LL SET SOMETHING UP FOR FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. OK?
“How long?”
“Where is he?” John begs. “There has to have been a mistake! Show him to me… why isn’t he here on the table? Did you send him back up once you realised?”
mine and not anyone else’s. That’s what should matter to you.”
"The mighty Sherlock Holmes, taken out by a lowly paving stone...Can you put weight on it?" John asks.
“I’m sure you’ll put out of your head entirely,” John mutters, and goes upstairs to his room, leaving the door slightly ajar. He is not surprised to hear the light, catlike footstep on the stair an hour later.
“I think I’ve proven many times that I am indeed capable—”
Sherlock doesn't reply.
“Sherlock,” he says, and his voice is choked but strong. “I love you. I’ve never loved anything like I love you and when I lost you, I lost myself, and I’ve never quite found myself again since.”
“Well, you are a perceptive one, aren’t you?”
“Your life was boring, I gave you something to do. You’re attracted to danger, I provide it.”
Sherlock starts before John can finish, bridling at this. "You didn't violate me. Don't use your misplaced guilt to tell me I'm not capable of making it clear when I want something to stop. Or that I don't know my own mind. If I tell you that it was good for me, it was."
“He strives to be better without ever pretending he's something he isn't. And while he could turn criminal so easily, so quickly, he knows it and he never will. No one can take anything away from him or leave any stain on him. What you see as a kind of virginity, a naïveté, stems from the simple fact that what Sherlock Holmes is, is the one and only incorruptible human being I've ever met. Even if human isn't always the first descriptor you'd apply. And if you don't understand that about him, you've got even less of a chance than I thought."
“Hey. Are you going to be okay?”
“Please Sherlock,” John says again and Sherlock is ashamed to have made his friend beg for something he shouldn’t even have had to ask for. “I don’t think I know what’s real any more. I need to know that you’re  here, that this isn’t a cruel dream, that you…”
By the time he sneaks off the planes in the dark, damp air just outside of Bruges, he is feeling exactly what he should be – resolute and hungry for action.
The other man put up his hands. “Sorry. Shouldn’t have asked.”
“You know, sometimes…” John shakes his head. “Oh, just forget it.” He turns and walks away.
Still others he is quiet, focused, intense, saying not a word but approaching John with such dark gravity that John is silenced too, and something deep passes between them. It doesn’t matter how, John just wants it never to end, wants them to go on like this for eternity, flatmates, friends, partners, lovers, everything to each other, all the time.
Sherlock’s head whips around and fixes him with a savage glare for daring to speak.
John lets out a long breath and closes his eyes.
“Going to stay over?” she asked.
John closed his eyes. He remembered the months after Ms. Adler’s first “death”. Months in which Sherlock had barely eaten, barely spoken – done nothing but play the violin constantly and worked. Months in which he had been lost to John, even when they were in the same room. “I’m not in the mood for games, Ms. Adler.”
clear, Greg. I’m not doing this for you.”
“Hmm?”
“I know. And if you want… if she’s what you want… I’m not going to… I want you to be happy, I just need… I need to know.”
“Dr. Watson,” she greets him cordially, without any acknowledgement of her surprise or the scuffle they’d had. “How lovely to see you again. You really don’t want to use that in here.”
“Did you find out who she is?”
“Let me go,” Sherlock demands, struggling.
” he tried. Was there a man here, two weeks ago?
He draws Molly’s arm from behind her back, gently feeling for a break that is thankfully not there. He holds her wrist loosely for a moment feeling the inflamed heat of it in his hand.
“Hello, Mr. Bryant,” Sherlock answers in a sickly cheerful voice. “Oh dear, you don’t say, how awful, be right over, bye byeee!” Sherlock looks triumphantly at John, who can’t quite hide a smile at his cocky enthusiasm. “Shall we, then?”
He puts his hands to Sherlock’s jutting hipbones and glances briefly up at his friend, who is watching him with sharp, focused hunger shining in his sea-glass eyes. John wraps his fingers around Sherlock, enjoying the sight of his lean thigh muscles contracting in anticipation. John nuzzles softly around the base of him, inhaling him, as Sherlock lets out little halting breaths of pleasure with each movement John makes. He gives Sherlock’s testes a long, slow lick, the promise of more to come, and is just about to turn his attention to Sherlock’s enticingly dewy tip…
party in a rather mean way, and she’s still quite in love with you.”
Something about shipping. Ships, they had tankers. Les Butineuses was primarily a smuggling ring before Moriarty got a hold of them. They’d need transportation for goods, wouldn’t they?
Sherlock shakes his head, frustrated. “Not literally…not exactly. It was just…wrong. Now it’s fine, everything looks normal, you’re glowing like you should be.”
Sherlock had not moved from his spot on the floor. John was bemused. “Okay, I will admit I was tormenting you a little bit, and you deserved it, but I had no idea you found my touches so intolerable.”
Sherlock plays him like the violin, eliciting feelings and sounds from him he didn’t think possible, brushing fingers expertly against his prostate until John sees stars behinds his eyes and his nerves hum like strings, an unfamiliar but beautiful symphony. John’s body sings a harmony to Sherlock’s melody, completely out of John’s control, completely given over.
John gives him a measuring look but doesn’t comment. “Why don’t I make some breakfast and then you can tell me all about this new case?”
“I don’t understand,” he said helplessly.
“And how do I know
The looks on Sherlock’s face hardens, and he motions curtly for the officers to get her out of his sight.
She still looks royally pissed off, but she's starting to calm down.
He didn’t know how long he slept but when he awoke, Lestrade was standing in the room.
"John, don't be rash. Think this through," Sherlock says, backing away slowly.
John shakes his head. “No one could have survived that, Sherlock. A man with my name woke up three weeks later in Germany. But me… no.”
He had managed to reason out two things about the problem. First, that the box number must be a date. Six digits and something Sherlock thought John would know. Of course there was always the off chance that Sherlock thought John would know an obscure series of Tibetian runes which translated into a six-digit code for John favorite brand of tea, but there was only so much a normal human being could account for. Second, that whatever the box number and the password were, they must have some significance to both John and Sherlock, and none whatsoever to anyone else.
, compared  to the rest of the brain-dead slugs who walk around on this dismal earth.” His eyes shone in the murky light, like a cat’s. “But I could take it all away so quickly,
He doesn’t respond to John or reply to any of his carefully innocuous questions. He won’t eat any of the meals John stubbornly cooks for him, doesn’t sleep, stares at the telly like he doesn’t see it – he constantly mumbles corrections at it, but they are half hearted and mechanical. He will drink tea that John makes, but sips it with an air of surprise, as if he can’t imagine where it came from or what on earth his body wants with it.
He wakes in hospital, stitched up and full of painkillers. Sherlock is nowhere to be found, but Mrs. Hudson is there and Lestrade shows up soon as well.
At last Sherlock closed his eyes and darted forward quickly, brushing his lips against John’s then retreating back into himself just as fast.
“Maybe this one…isn’t?” John suggests, yawning. “I’m going to make more coffee.”
Moran stopped, inspecting the razor-sharp blade. “And that is?”
He does as he’s told and John joins Sherlock on the bed presently. "Smell," he says, holding a finger under Sherlock’s nose.
With difficulty Sherlock controls himself. “I want you, John. Right now.” He leans towards John again, but John fends him off.
“The centre! That’s where the killer lives. Newham, off Cumberland road. Catch up when you can.”
He shrugged. “At least it will be quick.”
John calms visibly as he accesses his medical memory. If Sherlock can just keep him working John might be able to avoid another break entirely.
Sherlock shakes his head, stopping and looking solemnly at him. "John, I learned a lot of things while I was away," he says in a low voice. "Many of them were terrible. And while I will never be what you could call a sociable person, I have learned to... appreciate the things I have. Lest I lose them."
"Genius."
Not sure whether to feel morose and abandoned, afraid for both of them, or thrilled his friend was alive, John made his way slowly back home via two busses, three planes, and a taxi. The flat was dark and empty when he got in, and he had rarely felt lonelier. He wished he could tell someone, anyone, about Sherlock but he knew even confiding in Sarah was risky. He was exhausted but couldn’t bring himself to go to bed just yet. He put the kettle on and opened his laptop wearily.
“Yes, hold on.” John was used to this by now, but he could by no means text as quickly as Sherlock could talk. “Okay, sent.”
It does little for the pain, but nothing can. Some time in the past 18 month he has forgotten how to be alone, and it is too quiet, too dark, too still without another human being, without someone to leave appalling messes in the kitchen, body parts in the fridge, mock crime scenes in the sitting room. But he cannot abide the company of anyone else, so he endures, still trying to hold on to the idea that it might all be a dream, or a trick, that Sherlock might still be alive, somehow. He wishes Moriarty were still alive so he would have someone to hunt, to kill, to take revenge on.
John climbed into bed, pondering the problem. The question with Sherlock had moved from one of if to one of how and when. John was, and had been for some time, comfortable with the confirmed bachelor flatmate status they enjoyed, the solving cases, the pseudo-domestic arrangement. And, at least given his reaction to the unexpected snogging, it seemed sex certainly wasn’t going to be a problem.
John coughed as Sherlock set him back down, hiding a grin. “So, I take it everything is…okay…then?” he said. “Is that it, is it over with Moriarty, forever?”
“Other thing?”
Sherlock sounds disgusted and John knows it’s not just a show. He was hoping for an equal, someone he could hate and respect, and he’s gotten a snivelling coward with a persecution complex and more knowledge of weaponry than is good for him.
"You were. Coming back now doesn't change that. You were dead for two years, and you annulled any chance we might have had the moment you threw yourself off that roof. When you convinced me you had committed suicide and broke every single promise you ever made me!
Sherlock only rises to bathe and to change the sheets a few times – he remains fastidiously clean even in his laziness. He sleeps naked, having told John that the feel of elastic or any binding fabric against his skin at night is painful and distracting and the only things bearable are his high-thread count linens. His only concession to clothing now is to throw on a dressing gown when he gets up. John doesn’t mind this in the least, although he sticks to pyjama bottoms and t-shirt for lounging purposes.
“Well… perhaps it’s having a sort of aftereffect on you. Your brain is… different.”
Sherlock shrugs off his concern and doesn’t answer. They tell Lestrade he’s not the guy, but that they ought to take him into protective custody. The DI does not look happy about this, but upon seeing the suspect is forced to agree that horrific murder on his part does seem unlikely. “I’ll be in touch,” Sherlock tells him and they head home.
John shakes his head vehemently. “No. The opposite of wrong.” He clears his throat. “Tell me, how quickly can you get that registrar back here?”
“Gone nine. You’re useless, aren’t you?”
“No, Sherlock, it’s not…” John pauses. He doesn’t know how to say any of it but he can’t allow Sherlock to think for a moment that John doesn’t want him anymore. He closes his eyes and lets out a long breath, sliding out of his chair to sit on the floor. Sherlock sits beside him, close but not touching, legs crossed, watching John breathe. He waits.
With difficulty, John stops himself from screaming at Sherlock for his coldness, for being upset about the wrong things. He knows him well enough now to understand that while he may be genuinely obsessed with the puzzle, he is not unaffected by the scene before him. Sherlock Holmes, master of displacement.
Sherlock searched his friend’s face and body for signs of more serious injury he might be hiding and found none. “You’re all right,” he repeated, with more conviction this time.
you come here?”
“What… what does that mean?” Sherlock asks carefully.
“Yes. Like the tree lit up and fire in the fireplace and sparklers and…
“Dull,” Sherlock lies. He stumbles into the sitting room and John finally gets a good look at him. He’s in his dressing gown, hair a tangle, eyes bloodshot, twitching.
"I'm going to examine you," John's voice says firmly, from immediately in front of him.
John glances at Sherlock, whose face is unreadable. “I think that might be a little extreme for a social club, don’t you?” he asks carefully. “Even one that’s gone a bit off the edge.”
Sherlock frowns. “What I do… what we do… is inherently dangerous. You can’t keep me in a bubble, John.”
But it still goes too fast, and in hindsight is tainted by Moriarty’s tentacles infiltrating their lives, almost unnoticed at first.
He ignored the question. “A nurse will not be necessary. I read your instructions as you were writing them and I am more than capable of handling all of those tasks.”
But he doesn’t. Instead he throws himself down on the sofa, fiercely, facing away from John in his all-too-familiar sulking position. He’s ignoring John, hoping to make him beg his pardon, to clamour for his attention, for John to try to cajole him out of it. But John’s not playing.
is to know that I’m with someone who won’t refuse to tell me anything that’s going on in his head, someone who won’t treat me like a servant at best and a burden worst until he suddenly decides he could use a good fuck again. What were you going to do after this? Go back to your composing and your brooding and leave me to clean up and get out like a cheap whore?”
Eventually John falls silent and just holds him, trying to shelter him from his own thoughts as well as he knows how. They are quiet for a long time, not sleeping, not speaking, just being, together but somehow separate.
Moran got to his feet, no longer bothering to hide his anger. “You’re going to pay for that, Mr. Holmes. But I don’t want to let pleasure get in the way of business. Tell me where the phone is, and I will try to find some mercy in my heart.”
Bryant swallows nervously. “I’m getting to that. Sometime last year something changed in the club. It got more serious, the more extreme members ended up with officer positions, and instead of a tone of ‘oh, we all have red hair, people make fun of us, gotta stick to together’ meetings instead started to involve resentment and distrust of everyone who was not like us. I stopped going, kind of distanced myself from the whole thing. I felt guilty about it, but it just wasn’t like it used to be and I didn’t want to hate anyone, especially because of something as silly as hair colour. It was all fine for a while, I went about my life. But then I started noticing….people.”
“Was that my gun you just made off with?” John asked weakly. “And I suppose shoes and a shirt would take too much time?”
It is only the next day when the Crown Jewels are stolen, announcing the return of Moriarty. It all ends so fast after that.
Reluctantly, he goes down to the morgue. He barely hears Molly’s chattering as he examines the body. The marks on the throat are certainly unique, but he’s lost his taste for this case. He takes pictures and measurements mechanically and leaves quickly, not wishing to return to the flat but not having any better ideas.
it to be formal and legal and all of those boring things so no one in the world can say we don’t belong to each other, that our family doesn’t count. I just… maybe need a little time. And therapy.” He smiles wryly, a smoldering Yule log.
He’s not sure how much later he wakes, but John’s no longer beside him. He shakes off the disorientating darkness more quickly this time, but something else is wrong. He can’t quite pinpoint it, so he calls out to John.
Finally it was quiet inside his head. Sherlock supposed he must have fallen asleep; certainly his body didn’t seem to be of any consequence at the moment, but he felt like he was thinking clearly for the first time in days. He knew he’d overdone it and had been a bit concerned at first that he’d gone too far, even for him. But the worst had passed, and he was aware of a cool sensation, radiating from his forehead that seemed to suffuse his whole being and bring clarity. He was floating. He felt like a balloon, like he might just drift up and away from everything if he weren’t tethered somehow. It was a paltry little string that held him, he could break it if he wanted to and fly off, but he didn’t want to right now. Now he wanted to think.
Victor grimaces. "So you think if I'd been Victor Smith with the brown hair you'd have taken no notice, just passed me by?"
As his attraction and attachment to the man continues to grow, he is not unaware of his friend’s hungry stares, abruptly terminated if John turns toward him. Sherlock stands closer to him and doesn’t realise. Sherlock grow more intolerant of long absences on John’s part. Sherlock takes obvious delight in any move John makes to protect or defend him. John notices all of this, but he’s not sure Sherlock does.
Mary sighs patiently and shifts so she’s balancing cross-legged on the stool. "Look, Sherlock, when you came back, once John was done being angry, I really thought he might leave me for you. And if that was what was best for him, I would have accepted it. He was so unhappy for so long I just wanted him to have what he needed. But he didn't do that. And why he didn't is between the two of you. But he still needs you, and I know better than to stand in the way of that. I don't want to. You're good for him, and he's safe with you."
from her, or maybe it’s that it’s hard to feel like part of a couple when the other half barely acknowledges your existence.
“On whether I’ve been promoted from the lilo.” He put a hand on her neck, under her silky hair, and impulsively pulled her face towards his.
There are plenty of things they don’t say, don’t talk about. Sherlock is never good with feelings, and John is more of a man of action, preferring to show rather than tell. It is not so much that they are avoiding it, but that they have better ways of communicating, and some things just don’t need to be spoken.
They held each other for several minutes more, clinging to one another like children. The emotion was too raw and the relief too great for propriety to reassert itself just yet. When they had both managed to compose themselves, Sherlock smiled wryly. “Now, I have to agree with you that people really
He hears John get up and pad towards the bathroom, probably assuming Sherlock needs a hand climbing into the shower or something similar. Sherlock faces the mirror, eyes closed and hands on the vanity supporting his weight.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock nods and swallows hard, trying to keep himself under control. He pulls away and John lets him go, and busies himself tidying up some clutter on the sitting room table. There has been a little too much intimacy and honesty in the past twenty-four hours for either of them to handle well, and both now feel uncomfortable at what they have shared, what they have admitted, both to each other and to themselves.
Sherlock being flustered like this flusters John, and it’s only made worse by how she’s taunting John with words he’s not allowed to say, not allowed to hint at, and it’s fine as long as no one else says them either, but she does. She just lays them out there carelessly, with a knowing look at him and instantly he’s naked too, but not naked like she is, like a little boy caught with his trousers down.
The need in his voice wakes the hunger in John, and he nods eagarly. He rolls over and feels Sherlock line himself up, long fingers gripping his hips tightly, and then slowly, too slowly, slides himself inside of John, just a tiny bit. Pleasure and pain explode behind John’s eyes, but he finds himself begging for more, more, please Sherlock
“Well, I can tell you one thing, Mr. Bryant. It’s not your Ginger club that’s out to get you.”
“My God. Hang on a tick, let me get my jacket…”
"Then you
“Christ, Watson, you didn’t get
Sherlock spins back to look at him incredulously. "You actually believe all this, don't you. That we have some kind of... what? Destiny?"
, John.”
“Christmas isn’t for two days,” Sherlock informs him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Miss Callan,” she snaps. “Of course
"And he's what now, 21?"
Sherlock tended his own wounds as well as he could, given that he only had water and a spare shirt to clean them with, and attempted to get some sleep. It was against his nature to give into sleep in a situation like this, but he knew he needed to try to keep his body strong if he was to last. He ate some of the food provided as well. He hoped Mycroft had gotten his message and was on his way. It might be humiliating to be rescued by his big brother, but it was preferable to the alternative at this point.
“So thrilling to hear of your enthusiasm for my safety, Dr. Watson.”
Mycroft has tea brought to them in the sunny parlour of a truly enormous house and sips placidly, as if they did this all the time. John glowers. “Would you like to get to the point any time soon? I’m missing my shift.”
"No. Stay, please. I need some light in here."
“That’s alright, dear,” she said patting him on the shoulder. “Honeymoon phase. I’ve heard worse!”
John seems to have composed himself, which is more than Sherlock can claim. He had thought blindness alone had made him helpless but that was blissful independence compared to the state in which he now finds himself.
John kisses Sherlock on the forehead and starts to move, gripping his neck more tightly and wrapping his other hand around Sherlock’s leaking cock, stroking, but not too much, not wanting it to be over. They press together as much as they are able and John rocks slowly, agonizingly, deliciously slowly, wanting to sear the feeling of Sherlock body into his heart and mind, wanting to fill and be filled. All thoughts but this are gone from his head, the desire for Sherlock, for them to never be parted again.
, and smell him, and smell his own sick, taste it on his tongue. He exists once more. The world exists, though it is greatly diminished.
"John, you asked me not to be dead..." He knows as soon as the words leave his mouth that they are a mistake. Rage lights behinds John's eyes and Sherlock thinks for a moment, hopes, that he might hit him. But he doesn't.
"Oh, nothing," she says with an infuriating little smile. "Just something someone said to me once."
“It was…not pleasant, but not the sort of the thing I learned how to get out of until after I left for uni. Mummy could be very persuasive. In any case, there were a lot of young people from other schools there and there was a boy I’d never seen before. I looked at him and he looked at me and I could see it, we were the same. I’d never experienced that before, and I was angry at my parents for making me attend, so I decided I would ask him to dance in front of everyone. I could see he’d say yes, he was very confident.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “I never knew his name, though I’m sure I could have found out. I think he was from Wales. But don’t weigh that incident too heavily. I’m certain I would have come to the same conclusion if it had never happened. I did have a few intimacies at uni, some as an experiment and some out of a youthful failure to rein in my impulses. They all resulted in distraction or distress for both parties. It didn’t seem to be worth it, and I learned to control my urges for the most part. It was better. I could focus on my work. Nobody expected things from me I couldn’t give them.”
“I’m not cancelling,” John interrupts. “This is important.”
“Letting me go is an option,” Sherlock points out. “I know nothing about your organisation and have no interest in it; my only interest is in running down someone you yourself wish dead.”
John made a noise of frustration. “No! I don’t know. I think we’d both regret it if it was the wrong time and the wrong reasons. This is so fresh, we need, I need to give it a little time, to figure it out. There’s too many other things right now to cloud our judgement. Can we get used to just being around each other again, first?”
"I know it sounds like a stretch... I'm not even really sure what to look for. But my gut tells me there's something to do with the Friesland Petrol company. The shipping division. You were in the business a long time. Do you know them?"
“All right. You know best.” The silent “for now” of John’s reluctant acceptance is painfully obvious, but Sherlock lets it go.
Sherlock sniffs. “Since when are you so concerned about virtue, John? What age did you start at, again? Bit of a double standard there.”
Sherlock has the good grace to look sheepish. “There was no sign of her. I deduced that she’d opted not to come personally so as to not risk her placement within the Ginger Society.”
“Oh, sod off,” John snaps.
“Whatever you say,” John agrees amiably, moving as slowly as he dares.
“Nineteen.”
He leans forward and nuzzles the hair above Sherlock’s ear in atonement. Sherlock exhales slowly. “I… regret… if any of the ways I have behaved made you doubt your importance to me. I was distracted. I didn’t ever expect to meet someone like her. Like myself, and unlike. Trying to puzzle it out took more of my attention than perhaps it should have.”
“Let’s go home, Sherlock.” John said. “Right now.”
“C-c-cold,” stuttered John. Sherlock cast around desperately for anything warm and dry, even a tarp, but there was nothing. His clothes were just as soaked as John’s. He could only think of one thing to do.
“Hello? Who is this?” He knew that voice.
And it’s not just for Sherlock’s sake, either. Hearing this gorgeous man moaning his name softly, watching his muscles ripple under his ivory skin while John rides him like prize stallion – it’s intoxicating. Beads of sweat form on his back, shimmering like diamonds as he lays flat beneath John, held by his powerful thighs, and it’s as close to perfect as John can imagine. He lets himself forget his fear for the time being and loses himself in the moment, trying to remember every detail.
“A plane? Now?! Where are you going?”
Molly pauses, then nods once, curtly, not meeting his eyes.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment or lift his eyes from the text.
“Nonsense, John, I’m the picture of health,” Sherlock pulled his sallow features into what he clearly thought was a convincing smile. “See? All I needed was a good night’s sleep.”
“John…”
The only thing Sherlock had not tried was confronting the problem directly, and at last he grew desperate enough to resort to that. Sulking, he flounced into the kitchen where John was reading and picking at some leftovers, and collapsed into the chair across from him. John did not look up from his magazine.
The other man makes a low noise that could, in some circumstances, be interpreted as pleasure or at least acceptance. John lays there quietly, until he feels the angry breathing begin to subside. Finally he asks, “What happened?”
“Quite. Mr. Holmes, you have in your possession an item which is of great value to me. My proposition is very simple. Tell me where it is, and once I have it and have verified the contents, I will let you go home without any further interference, provide you agree to extend me the same courtesy. Now, what do you say, Mr. Holmes, shall we close the door on this rather upsetting chapter of both our lives?”
. He gives in, fully this time, pulling Sherlock to him and once more letting their bodies do the communicating for them.
“I already know one thing they took, do you John? Mr. Bryant, you will find you are missing several items of clothing, including a tweed jacket with leather patches at the elbows. Additionally, I suspect that you will also be missing a hairbrush, favourite mug, and several other small personal items. Beyond that, nothing should else should be gone. Except, of course, your employee identification card, which you will likely find either in your car or your office tomorrow morning when you go to work, to make it seem like you simply forgot it.”
Sherlock starts looking around the room for clues, while John checks the hallway again. As he is looking back the way they came, he suddenly feels red hot pain slam into the base of his spine.
He feels John’s curt nod, not truly understanding but accepting. I STILL SHOULDN'T HAVE. I WASN'T. I DIDN'T. John pauses, swallowing something back. IT WAS NOT GOOD OF ME.
“In the scan… it was lighting up just like it would if you were receiving visual input. Caroline said—”
“Ten hour layover in Bahrain, what kind of monsters run British Airways?” he complains.
“Letting me go and praying that I don’t come back and slit your throat while you sleep?” Sherlock asked, brightening.
“Good luck,” John mumbles under his breath.
The final chapter! Almost 11 months and I'm done! I know I probably should have spaced these last few chapters out a bit more but the Instant Gratification Monkey is jumping up and down inside my brain and I just need it to be done! Thanks to ScopesMonkey for proofing this chapter, and the previous three.
“Okay,” John tells him, rubbing Sherlock’s arm reassuringly. “It’s okay. Just tell me what you can.”
He concentrates on sucking slowly, occasionally, shyly, stroking Sherlock’s testes with his free hand, and pausing to lick up and down the length of the shaft. It’s not long before he hears, “John, I… I can’t…” and he stops, not wanting it to be over so soon again. He  suddenly needs his face to be close to Sherlock’s and they tumble over each other, landing side by side pressed against each other, legs tangled, bodies pulsing with need, breathing raggedly.
“I think you care about living to see the end of the game. Since our time is growing short, it’s my turn to ask what I can do for you, Consulting Criminal.” Sherlock spread his hands mockingly. “Anything you desire! Or at least anything before our guests arrive. Ten seconds.”
Sherlock runs his hands through his hair, tugging on it, and tries to give John his attention. “Enough of what?”
John makes himself a strong coffee. He doesn’t think he wants to sleep tonight, even though he’s been short on rest for weeks now. And he’s concerned about Sherlock’s reaction. He doesn’t take losing well at the best of times, and this is a particularly ugly ending to a long and gruelling chase. John feels like he should stand watch, somehow, even though he doesn’t expect Sherlock to come out of his room again that night, and possibly not for several days.
me before you test things…” John mutters. “But it’s not always like an old photo when I’m not around you…is it?”
“Even if that were to be true, what does that have to do with you and I?”
Usually, when Sherlock’s away, he uses the time to detoxify the flat, get rid of old experiments in danger of becoming more serious health hazards, and generally prevent the place from drifting into condemnable territory. And it’s also a good chance to spend some time with friends he doesn’t see often.
The clerk pales instantly and covers his mouth, looking ill at the sight of blood.
He lowers his head, in grief, and takes one of John’s hands. He brings it to his lips and kisses it over and over, wanting to do more, wanting to enfold John in his arms, tuck him away inside his heart, but he senses John is on the edge and is fearful of pushing him over, losing him forever. He says nothing, just holds the hand to his mouth, hoping to convey everything he cannot say with the gesture. Eventually he feels fingers in his hair, stroking his cheek. Permission.
Sherlock nods. "Chatter is there's someone new involved, he's taking things in a more aggressive - and lucrative - direction."
Sherlock nods curtly. He takes a step towards John, almost flinching at the charge and heat that surround them both, and wonders if this part of what the drug is doing to him now. He puts his hands on John's shoulders and they tingle.
“Mean what?”
“No.”
“Did I do this?” he whispers, and John looks away; a kindness to not speak the answer they already know. Sherlock casts about for words of apology, but can find none adequate to the magnitude of what has been lost, for John, for him. He bows his head instead, bringing their foreheads to touch, slotting his nose against John’s nose, feeling the nostrils flare against his own, their lips only micrometres apart.
Countless women, exotic birds in glittering gowns every colour of the rainbow adorn a dance floor, in a house old enough and large enough to have its own ballroom. Men, elegant magpies in nearly identical coats and tails, attend them, twirling them round, showing them off, moving in step with them. Other men and women, likewise attired, line the sides of the cavernous room, admiring, eating, drinking, chatting gaily like a flock of finches, flitting about from one conversation to the next, never settling.
“But no time for that,” he declares. “We have about twenty minutes to get something to eat before Lestrade has us come down to the Yard and look at the suspect.”
Victor looks confused, then startled. "Romance? No. I'm not even sure where I'd start at this point."
“Midnight? I thought you said one.”
“Where are you going?”
“You won’t kill me,” Moran said, though his voice shook. “You’re a doctor.”
EAST SOUTHEAST, BUT CLOSE ENOUGH. PERHAPS I SHOULD START ASKING FOR ANSWERS IN DEGREES.
Sherlock nods thoughtfully. "Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for your... ingenuity. And your impressive aim, especially given that you were very nearly in a complete psychotic state. The fact that you managed not to kill or paralyse either one of us is very impressive. But...considering all that and the original delivery method of the toxin, instead of risking both our lives, healths, and sanities in a dubious display of medical machismo while under the influence of hallucinatory drugs... could you not have just sprayed up our noses?"
“It’s all lies, of course. You know that, but you might be the only other one who does, really. Without any doubt at all.”
John slams his mobile down on the table harder than is wise. “Okay,” he says, still breathing loudly through his nose in annoyance. “He’s doing it. It’ll be at be at Bart’s by the end of today. Do you think he bought my reasons?”
“It wasn’t a bad plan,” Sherlock is saying. “Rather ingenious really – gave me quite a lot of trouble. That
He chuckled, then caught himself. He hadn’t laughed since…well, he just hadn’t. He felt guilty about it, now.
John is safe. The reactions range from pulling John away for something urgent, with a venomous glare, for minor infractions, to completely eviscerating her self-esteem publicly, using basic facts deduced from her person, for the high crime of attempting to slip John her phone number.
John turns bright crimson and scrambles to cover himself and Sherlock, who seems completely undeterred by their landlady’s presence.
“I’m making a
Whatever the case, this phone was important and there were plenty of ways the information in it could be used, particularly if he met Moran. To get Sherlock back, for one thing, assuming it was Moran that had him. That was all John cared about at this point – he could worry about proving Sherlock wasn’t a fraud and about his own safety later, but right now he needed to know Sherlock was alive.
John looks at him levelly. "No."
The next day, Jim Moriarty, absent from all news and rumour for several months, breaks into the Tower of London and scrawls “Get Sherlock” on the case containing the crown jewels before allowing himself to be captured.
Not much he’ll be able to tell anything from whatever’s left, but he’s not in the mood to just stand around. Lestrade points him to the dining room, with white tape on the floor marking the spot. John kneels to examine the area. There’s a little bit of blood on the floor and on the sharp corner of the table and residue of something on the hardwood that might have been saliva, but it had dried. A chair had been knocked over, but there are no other signs of a struggle.
“Why not? Are you jealous, still? After all this time.”
Sherlock finally opens his eyes and gets up reluctantly, facing John cross-legged. “I’m not sure I can explain.”
“Why would you do that?”
“I had thought we were done with mind-altering substances,” John mutters as they board the train home.
John snorts. “Incredible. But one more thing. How could you have possibly known he’s a considerate lover? You had to have taken a shot in the dark with that one. Besides, no one wants to think he’s an inconsiderate lover. No man would contradict you.”
He bursts out of the elevator doors and casts around until he finds her face. Molly looks ashen at the sight of him.
“Well, do you have a term you prefer I employ? It seems an apt description.”
He grins widely as Sherlock plays the older man out to “God Save the Queen”.
“Do you like it?” John asks, shyly.
“Absolutely not,” John says solemnly. “I just don’t want to forget the paperwork.”
John is shocked by the recollection of his own recklessness last night, but realises he would do the exact same thing over again, a thousand times if he had to. The thought gives him an odd kind of perspective, and for the first time in weeks he feels very calm. He washes his arms and face and applies anti-bacterial ointment to the long cut.
“Afghanistan. Your wound.”
“You don’t believe that,” Sherlock growls. “Despite your determined attempts to appear otherwise, you're not stupid. You know what's happening to me. This won't get better. It will probably get worse. This is all there is for me now."
After an eternity, John tilts his head up and allows his lips to meet Sherlock, pressing his thin ones against the fullness of Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s mouth drifts open, slackly, accepting the kiss, wishing for John to use his mouth, his body, himself however the soldier desires. John’s tongue brushes against his like some sleek, velvety animal, strong and muscular, marking out a territory in Sherlock’s mouth. The flavour of John’s saliva is rich and sweet and surpasses the most wonderful food he’s ever tasted. He presses back against John now, craving more, letting his tongue explore the landscape of John’s mouth and saturate himself with the savor of it.
The no-more-drugs rule is never explicitly stated, and Sherlock is not sure if it is actually a rule at all, but he certainly doesn’t seem to need them as much with this new activity serving to both calm him and stimulate him variously as needed. And he has a sneaking suspicion if John sees drugs again, condoms will also miraculously appear, and that is something he is interested in avoiding at all costs.
Sherlock is halfway to the first floor in pursuit, careless now that’s he so close, when John notices something uneven about the next step in front of him. “Sherlock, stop!” he screams at the very instant the detective’s foot hits the step.
Sherlock blinks at him. "What?"
"Yes," says Sherlock.
John bows and holds out a hand. “One dance? Before we go. You lead.”
PHYSIOLOGICALLY THERE STILL ISN’T ANYTHING WRONG. YOUR HEART RATE IS ELEVATED AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE, BUT THAT’S TO BE EXPECTED AFTER YOUR FRIGHT. I’M SORRY.
Sherlock closes his eyes and leans into John’s hand, tangling his own fingers in John’s chest hair. Then he seems to shake himself and withdraws, swinging his legs so he is sitting on the edge of the bed.
“No… like a pulsar or a white dwarf. Compact but bright and powerful.”
After long minutes, Lestrade cleared his throat. “John… I’ve been meaning to ask you. Are you…okay? In general? I know things have been difficult for you since…”
“Done with.”
“Mm. Just thinking.”
Had Sherlock been trying to warn John against himself, knowing he would do this eventually? Or had he just been afraid at how much he was giving away. John’s mind spins desperately.
“Hmmm. Well, you did get rather a sizeable bump on the head that day.” John is quite startled by this whole thing, but doesn’t want to alarm Sherlock or make him feel persecuted. There’s no faster way to get him to clam up. “Sherlock, do you know what synesthesia is?”
John steps back, visibly calming himself.  He closes his eyes. “You know what, I’m sorry Sherlock. You’re right, you didn’t say anything wrong. It was a perfectly normal, lovely thing for a best friend to say at a wedding. You were great. Thank you. Thank you for all of this, it’s amazing.”
Sherlock Holmes isn’t sure at what point he’d decided to plan John Watson’s wedding. He’s not sure he’d really decided at all, in fact. John and Mary seem equally uncertain as to how this developed but show no signs of wishing him to stop, so he forges on. Neither of them seem particularly eager or adept, and Mary’s taste is, to put it mildly, appalling. Best if he handles things.
They both fall silent, but Sherlock breaks it.
actually hunt him down later and take care of him.”
John's breathing normalises at last, and he kisses Sherlock's cheek almost sweetly.
John barely has time to say, “Not remotely,” before Sherlock has dragged him back down to the bed, and then it is a very long time before he needs to say anything else at all.
"No."
“Oh no, I’ve done enough listening to you. You take me to him this instant. I need to strangle him. Or kiss him. Or both.” John was looking frantically for his keys and jacket.
“What happened last time is exactly why I didn’t tell you. You’re better off out of it.”
But really, the day is going along just splendidly until Sherlock punches John in the face. It all goes rather downhill after that. Distressed Stranger Sherlock is not a new one for John, although he’s not previously taken it to such an extreme, and they are ushered into Ms. Adler’s house with John dutifully playing the Helpful Bystander as is required of him.
“White dwarf.”
“Air is better up here for thinking. Floorboards springier. Can’t think down there. Stifling. And filthy.”
were. All the facts I gave you were perfectly in order, it’s hardly my fault you lot didn’t bother to pay attention. Look at him, there is no way he made those footprints, they were far too close together, couldn’t have been made by a man over five foot eight!”
A sudden urgency courses through Sherlock and he pulls at John’s cardigan, trying to unbutton it with one hand whilst gripping John’s shoulder and running teeth along John’s neck. John sides Sherlock’s suit jacket off his shoulders so skillfully that Sherlock hardly notices until it falls to the floor, and runs strong hands up under Sherlock’s aubergine shirt, mapping the lines of his back with sensitive fingers.
Sherlock fixes his brother with a venomous stare that slowly fades into simple exhaustion. "You'll watch him?"
“The ship – no name, just a registration number – left Reykjavik two days ago,” he tells John reluctantly. “Ultimate destination of Mersin, Turkey. But it’s scheduled to make port in Inverness on Friday on its way there.”
"What? What did she mention? Quickly!"
She shook her head. “Don’t be.”
“You’re going to try though.” It’s not a question.
On Sunday afternoon, they sat on the sofa as the light started to fail, John clothed and reading the paper and Sherlock still in his blue silk dressing gown and pyjama bottoms, flipping impatiently through channels, despairing of ever being allowed to do anything interesting again. John reached over and began playing with the curls on the back of Sherlock’s neck, occasionally fondling his earlobe absently. To his surprise, Sherlock made what could only be described as a wail of abject misery, switched off the telly, and sank bonelessly off the sofa and onto the floor.
Sherlock nods, and wraps his arms more tightly around John’s torso, afraid of what he will say next, that he will slip away from him again.
John holds him tighter. “I was just so afraid of losing you. I went a bit barmy. What can I do to make it up to you?”
John couldn’t think of anything else the box number could be. As for the password, that was trickier. John’s own name was ten letters but that was far too obvious, even for him. Something to do with a case, perhaps, one of their last? “Baskerville” and “Reichenbach” had been the last big ones they solved together, both eleven letters. “Irene Adler” was ten letters, but she didn’t have anything to do with John, unless Sherlock was in the mood to be cruel.
Mycroft is silent for a long period. “Would it surprise you to know that the only period of Sherlock’s adult life in which he has been entirely free of chemical aid has been the past two months? After your serial killer case. And his use before that, after meeting you, was at a record low.”
“Sherlock did not commit suicide,” Mycroft repeated. “He didn’t die that day.”
"Come with me," he orders, and John does. And he doesn't pull his hand away.
higher of a level than you…but fundamentally, we’re alike.”
John lets out a long breath and nods. “Of course I am.”
"If he wanted to discuss it, he'd have told me. But I wanted to clear the air between us, because I've come to consider you a dear friend, Sherlock."
The last time they kiss is the next morning, right before the call about the kidnapped children, and John is certain something is wrong. Sherlock is closed off from him, hard, cruel, mysterious in a way he hasn't been in months. But John thinks it is just the fear, after what Moriarty put them through last time. They will beat him, Sherlock will beat him, and it will all go back to normal.
John’s reaction was instantaneous. In a second he had crossed the room, slamming the older man against the wall with one hand, while relieving him of his umbrella and using it to pin him back by his throat with the other. Mycroft put his hands up and did not struggle.
John has been summoned to see Mycroft and is in a bit of a snit about it.
“No, dear brother,” Sherlock said tightly. “He wants to destroy me. And my only chance at escaping such an end is to learn enough to destroy him first.”
Sherlock agrees unhappily.
Moran shrugged nonchalantly. “It worked. Love wasn’t something Jim went in for. I’m not even sure he was capable of it. Although his obsession with you made me wonder sometimes.”
Sherlock moves his hand down to brush the side of John's face, but John slaps it away with astonishing speed.
“And by the way, next time you send a message with incredibly urgent information that is vital to your survival and the safety of the entire nation, would you mind being a little less god-damned enigmatic about it?”
Sherlock’s eyes are half closed, listening to the music, and he wears a small smile of contentment on his face. He seems happy and, moreover, peaceful, which is not an emotion John has learned to associate with him. They are too close now, John can smell him, can feel the blood pumping into his hands and his warm breath on John’s cheek. It’s too intimate, changing the dance from a simple quirk of Sherlock’s into something that might have another meaning, and it spooks John, brings him back to the reality of where he is and what they have been doing.
“And you don’t have to worry. About…that.” He coughed awkwardly. “I don’t always understand you,” John went on. “And I certainly don’t always understand what…this… is. But it’s…good. For me. I don’t need more. You don’t have to…be afraid. That you’re missing something. That you can’t give me what I need. Or want. I wouldn’t be here if that was the case, at least not like this.”

"Bloody Camembert," he mutters. "I don't suppose anyone in the history of fancy parties has ever eaten the Camembert, yet here it is every time. I'm starting to think that there's just one wheel of it in the world that goes from party to party, getting less and less appealing as it goes."
John nodded. “I can understand that. So what’s different now?”
John leans his head back against the wall and takes a long breath. “How can you be so insecure and so arrogant at the same time? Egotistical nitwit.”
“But you’re his brother, it should be you!” John exclaims.
“Didn’t sound like it.”
John feels his face burning from shame of how easily, how quickly he was willing to hop into the arms of another man to ease his pain, and how he still would if he thought for even a second he could use it to conjure up being with Sherlock again. He doesn't even care that it wouldn’t be fair to Victor, using him as a shadow, a substitute for what John would never have again.
"And what led you to this life of crime?" he asks, sincerely curious.
“Oh God, John, I’m sorry,” Sarah said, clambering off of him. “I didn’t realize I was so tired.”
She moves closer and John shifts automatically to fit her in his arms. He runs his fingers up and down her back, toying with her hair. "So, what is your natural colour?" he asks, stalling for time.
John jumps to his feet, all the anger and confusion he’s been repressing for weeks and months, since they met that damned woman, now finally boiling over.
John doesn’t resist. “I’m not going to leave you.”
“All of them.”
Sherlock cocks an eyebrow and John has evidently answered his own question. Assuming that should be enough for him, Sherlock goes to resume his conquest, shoving John back with two firm hands to his chest, but John resists.
He briefly considers jumping the driver at the first stop and bringing the lorry in himself, but they’ll be more alert at the first gate and he’s not sure if the security device requires some kind of activation or if it’s automatic. Better to run, then, and get them once they think they’re safe.
“My instincts kicked in then, I managed to wrestle my gun out of his hands and fire. I couldn’t lift my head to see, but I knew I’d got him, I heard the sound of a body hitting the ground nearby.”
Thanks again to OhDearieMe for her editing prowess!
… I always wanted.” He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock on the cheek. “And I won’t be forgetting it.” Then the black figures emerged from the shadows and engulfed them, and Moriarty was gone, laughing the whole way.
. They could slit my heart right open!”
There had been a string of anonymous men, tall, slender, handsome. John had hated all of them, hated himself, and none of them had made him feel like Sherlock, even for a second, even when John was very drunk, shutting his eyes in a dark alleyway, trying to hard to imagine he was in the arms of his partner instead of being fucked by a cold, uninterested stranger. “I wasn’t careful, and I haven’t been tested. I didn’t care.”
"Very bad things," Sherlock finishes and John nods, digging his nails into his palm. "If something were to interfere with the myelin, would that be enough to cause the problems we've been seeing?"
“There was the understanding that when I got older and more successful that I would give back to future young people through the Society, and I didn’t mind at all. Not only did they give me an education, it was through Society members that I got my current job and a decent future in my career too.”
He comes out of his reverie, startled to realize two things: That it is nearly dark and that he is somehow wandered back around the city and is standing outside of 221B.
It takes too long to get there, and the cabbie has no idea where he’s going so John reads him directions off his phone. The house, looming and shabby, is down a long, overgrown lane in an area that was fashionable for summer homes at one time, but has since become neglected and undesirable. All the estates they pass have an air of disuse about them, but this one has been let go to seed completely. The gardens have turned into a small forest filled with brambles and nettles and young trees, shading into the dark, true woodland behind it. The paint on the house is peeling and signs of rot are everywhere.
“Because no one would ever believe me to be a ginger, John. Besides, things are always much more interesting down with the help.”
"Ignore everything outside. Ignore everything but what I tell you to do and we will survive this," Sherlock says with more surety than he feels. "Now, what is a myelin sheath?"
Sherlock hesitated.
He takes it from her, tucks it in his suit pocket, and turns to flee, but she stops him.
“All right,” John said. “Here, sit up. This will take awhile. Take these.” He proffered Sherlock a handful of oxycontin.
John swallowed, attempting to contain the rage that was again rising inside of him. “So what you are saying,” he said, his voice clipped, “is that you have come here to tell me that the man I thought was dead for the past three months, has been alive and well for at least two of those months, but may in fact be…dead…now.”
“Ah ha! No witness noticed a strange man in the neighbourhood, and in a posh one like that people notice strangers, especially dirty ones. So he must have done it when it was dark out, probably late the night before she died. Furthermore I analysed the dirt from the footprints and aside from the local clay one would expect, there’s also a mix of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. Also known as potting mix.”
“Not just once. We need to do that a lot. In many combinations. For data. Comparisons.”
He opened his laptop and did a quick Google search. It
Still, John is relieved when Henry Knight’s case of the gigantic hound manages to grab Sherlock’s attention and take them to Dartmoor. He hopes the change of scenery will do them both good, although it doesn’t quite go as he had imagined.
John lets out a long breath. “No, love, I don’t think so. We all have to go through it, often many times.”
He has nothing to say to that, and changes the subject.
John wordlessly motions him in and to sit down. He collapses on the sofa, heavily.
There it was. John held his breath for a long moment while the DI considered. He knew playing on his guilt over Sherlock was cruel, but he didn’t care. The only question was, would it work or would make him so angry that he would refuse to give John anything?
Before he can ask, Sherlock crows, “Mycroft is removing all surveillance from 221B immediately! Not that the monthly bug sweep wasn’t a nice part of my schedule, but really it’s about time.”
Mycroft continued. “Moriarty…he had set a trap for Sherlock. If Sherlock did not admit he was a fraud publicly and kill himself, Moriarty had men with irrevocable orders to shoot and kill you. And Mrs. Hudson. And Greg - er, Detective Inspector Lestrade. That’s why he did it. And that’s why he hasn’t contacted you. The orders are still out there, Moriarty’s network is still active even if he is dead. If he had let you know, let anyone know he was still alive before he took care of Moriarty’s henchmen and cleared his name, you would be killed.”
On the second afternoon John runs into some friends from the Army, other medics that he’s served with many times. He finds he’s surprised to see them, though given the setting he really oughtn’t be.
John rubs his temple at the memory. “Only hazily, but I take your point. Thank you for remembering, I can’t seem to keep a thought in my head for half a minute these days.”
Sherlock recalibrates to the concept that John may need a bit more time than he’d initially calculated and sets about to restore the rest of his existence to its proper order. He dislikes change unless it’s his idea, and this forced sabbatical had definitely not been in that category. The sooner he can get everything back the way it was, the better.
It’s a weak lie and he knows it won’t hold.
“John…”
But they couldn’t just be flatmates who solved crimes and fucked, either, there was far too much emotional baggage there already. And it was the in-between stuff that worried him. The… well, the word “boyfriend” absolutely refused to coalescence in his head around the image of Sherlock Holmes.  The romantic partner stuff. The casual affection, the subtle negotiations regarding time and space and weekend plans you had with a lover but not with a flatmate. The talk of a future.
John rolls his eyes.
.” Sherlock made a sound of disgust.
Sherlock hesitates. “John, I just want you to know, while I was away, I didn’t… I mean… there was no one, and I did nothing that might…” He had stayed clean, and celibate, for John.
"Yes, and you've memorised nothing and never compose!" John shouts, then falls quiet. After long moments of silence he comes over and puts his hands on Sherlock's hips, sighing deeply. "I'm sorry. I know this is devastating for you. The truth is, I'm afraid too. But we will figure this out. Until then, how about I try not to take it out on you if you try not to take it out on me?"
Sherlock grumbles about this rule, but John is firm. He is willing to do virtually anything Sherlock wants, but a man has limits. Plus, even Sherlock Holmes needs manners. “If you are going to think of something so urgent you can’t possibly take five more minutes to wrap things up, then don’t start!” John tells him after the third time it happens.
“If I’m honest, it does me too,” he said, tucking in to the food ravenously. “But I’m more worried about Sherlock. If he doesn’t get over this obsession, he’ll be in no condition to face him again and then where does that leave us? If he can’t find a clue to Moriarty’s whereabouts, or figure out what his plan is, than I certainly won’t be able to. I wouldn’t even know where to start, I’m just glad I didn’t get blown up.”
Lost in all the seemingly random trivia about these people’s lives was all the information they had needed to figure out who the killer was, just so obscure and mixed up that they hadn’t been able to see it. But Sherlock had, finally, after a decent night’s sleep and some fresh perspective. And then he had run off after him alone, without out a thought for John or anything else but the hunt.
They go on this way for two months after the trial. John is happy and content. He almost forgets about Moriarty, convincing himself that the criminal has lost interest or at least is a long way off. His relationship with Sherlock may not be what anyone would consider normal, but he wants no more. Sherlock doesn’t work emotionally the way most people do, and the feelings he does have he doesn’t express well or at all. But John doesn’t need him to.
“Well, what do you think?”
And then Sherlock is off and running and John follows him without thinking about it.
“Okay,” John says. “But… when this is over, when you have won –  and you
The man swallows audibly. “Just sayin’. That’s kind of a bloody lot to spring on a bloke.”
Sherlock enters the room warily. Being almost entirely removed from the scope of femininity, to find himself in what is arguably one of the most mysterious places of womankind, the rooms where a bride and her attendants prepare, is disconcerting to say the least. There are far too many ruffles and things with flowers on them and mirrors everywhere. Planning a wedding is one thing, but this is something different entirely.
John hides his relieved smile by putting his head once more to the smooth chest, trying to regain his emotional equilibrium once more. He focuses on the steady sound of Sherlock’s breathing, on the unconscious fidgeting of his hands, on the dwindling daylight coming through the window. He is so intent on his meditations that he starts when Sherlock at last speaks again.
“I will not.”
!” Moriarty screamed, now somewhere to his left. “You’re as fascinated by me as I am by you. We may have ended up on different sides of the equation, but that’s how equations balance. Maybe mommy and daddy didn’t love me enough, and that’s why I’m the criminal and you’re the detective. Maybe I just had a
Sherlock relaxed almost imperceptibly, but was still shaking.
anyone. He wasn’t really sure how he’d go about it, anyway.
“That’s not the point.”
are the right person?” Mr. Božić said, shrewdly. “Forgive me, but it seems there has been a lot of…turnover… lately. I would hate to make another mistake.”
"Yes, John," he echoes. "And each other."
On to his lap tumbled a black smartphone. For a brief second, John thought it was Sherlock’s, but Sherlock’s was silver. He turned it on and began looking through its contents. Slowly it dawned on him. It was Moriarty’s! Sherlock must have pickpocketed him before jumping off the roof. And everything was here, all his criminal dealings and contacts, meticulously organized, spanning dozens of countries and activities from counterfeiting to espionage to murder. Sherlock was right, this could truly bring down Moran and the rest of Moriarty’s network.
John reaches it just in time to grab hold of a tweed sleeve as he slips through, but the door slams shut with heavy steel finality and John has to jump back to avoid having his arm sliced off. He finds himself standing alone, with nothing but a slightly worn jacket in his hands and a deep bone bruise on his upper arm to show for his pursuit.
“John!”
She growls something into his hand that is certainly incredibly obscene and manages to get an elbow back into his stomach with enough force to knock the wind out of him.
"I have a name," Sherlock says slowly, thinking back to a case almost a year ago. To a screaming red dye-job who knew more than she should have. "Hanna Mihov."
“Good...so far. I thought it would be like being chained up or held down, but doesn’t seem to be. It’s more like having a centre of gravity that can bring me back even if I go very far away.”
"Okay..." John says slowly, after assessing his posture. "What's wrong?"
This did earn him a tiny smile, quickly suppressed. “And the results of your experiment, Doctor Watson?”
“Oh, this is going to be fun,” Moran whispered, and caressed Sherlock’s jaw with the knife point.
Carefully John rolled off of Sherlock and on to his back, catching his breath. Sherlock propped himself up on one arm and gazed at John almost shyly. John ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair. Neither spoke for awhile. At last, Sherlock offered, “I’ve never let anyone do that before, you know.”
The sensation of bare cocks, bare thighs, bare everything pressed against each other is exquisite torture for Sherlock. “Please John,” he whispers, between kisses. “I can’t take it anymore.”
"The minor-est of minor concussions," she cuts in smoothly. "Here, why don't you sit down? I'm sure he'll be awake soon."
"Gah!" he cries aloud before he can stop it, suddenly feeling like a railroad spike has just been driven through his skull. He grabs his head, curling in on himself and squeezing his eyes shut as if that will shut out the pain. It ebbs away, not nearly fast enough, and he straightens back up, gasping for air again. Better save that for a last resort, then, lest he give himself an aneurysm.
“Would you like me to arrange it?” John’s face is cold and unforgiving.
“He’s also giving you his power of attorney, to make decisions for him if he is ever incapacitated.”
The music is the worst part, somehow. At first, when Sherlock picks up his violin again, John is thrilled. If he won’t talk, at least playing can let him express something, soothe him a bit. And he does play, for hours on end, a tune that is new to John yet somehow familiar, repeated over and over almost ceaselessly until Sherlock’s fingers grow numb and he is forced to stop, at least temporarily. By the third day the very notes of the song, whatever it is, are like nails on chalkboard to John.
We will not be tattooing internal organs. Or anything else.”
Sexually, John is constantly amazed at the perfection the two of them together unfailing produces, whether they are roughly ravaging each other, fighting for control, leaving bruises and bite marks, or sweetly, tenderly giving themselves to one another in a sleepy moment after a hard case. There are many tunes but they always seem to be in absolute harmony. John had never thought he’d want to be with a man at all, and certainly not that he could be so fully satisfied by one that all thought of anything else leave his head permanently. Sherlock is all he wants, and, he realises, all he’s ever wanted.
John breathes in very quickly through his nose several times. "The sounds..." he manages. Sherlock can't see any colors other than John's angry aura, but he'll bet his friend is white as a sheet and his skin is obviously clammy.
"Maybe she's just that confident in your ability to get back out again. One way or another." He rolls his eyes, but she puts up a hand before he can reply. "John, you're more alive right now than I've ever seen you. I'll tolerate as much danger as you need to keep you that way."
"I didn't--" John begins to protest but then stops.
“You really are thick!” John exclaimed. “Will you just listen to me for a minute instead of acting like you know everything?”
She goes with him to a café busy enough that no one will overhear them. They sit and Sherlock orders two strong coffees.
damaged, crippled. Unless there are things relating to this you haven’t told me, I can’t see why this would be psychosomatic. Are there things?”
He closed his eyes and visualised the numbers floating in front of him. Was it a code or a password? No. It would be words, a clue. But what was the cypher? He tried various common encryption algorithms. Gibberish. Suddenly he smiled. It was simple, like the phone number. Moriarty
“Okay, well I’ll be in the booth then. I’ll be able to hear you if you need me.” He hears John walk out of the room and the door close. It’s even more discombobulating to be lying mostly naked in the centre of an empty space like this, not allowed to move around, to speak, and he tries to focus on something else.
Sherlock dropped his voice to a hoarse whisper. “That, and where ever you go, you will tell anyone who has worked for you or Moriarty or who might have any connection with any of Moriarty’s plans regarding me, that at the first sign of any attempt to follow through on threats to my life, my reputation, John’s life, or the lives or livelihoods of any of my associates I will hunt them down and repay them in kind for whatever they’ve done, as well as for every cut, blow, and broken bone that you have given me. And then I will do the same to you. And then I will let John kill you. Does that sound like a fair deal,
“So did I. This is much more interesting. Better get ready now so we can collect Bryant and be in place well before midnight.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I saw you. You think I don’t know when you’re aroused? I could smell it on you.”
"I know," John agrees. "I told them that. But you know how they are."
Sherlock had tried to conjure up the number in his mind, but could only retrieve a few digits. He had only glanced at it once – normally that would be enough, but he had crumpled the paper when picking it up, in his annoyance over being disturbed in his work. Half the digits had been obscured. It was no use, he could not reasonably deduce the other numbers. He needed the note. It would still be amongst the piles of books and papers he’d left in the lab, he was sure of it. Molly never touched his things when he left them there, and never let anyone else touch them either. It looked like trash, but unless it had fallen to the floor it would be undisturbed.
"Do you... want to talk about it?" he asks, remembering that he's heard people say that in similar situations.
After a few hundred metres he spots a small footbridge almost invisible for lack of illumination in the area. He takes shelter under it, pulling his legs to his chest and vanishing into the darkness. He waits and hears distant shouting but no footsteps coming closer.
He thought desperately for several more minutes. He couldn’t think of anything they shared that fit the number of letters. Maybe it was something about him, a description? Army Doctor? That was ten letters. He didn’t feel totally confident about it, but he couldn’t think of anything else that fit. He would have to give it a shot.
When Sherlock wakes, John is sitting on the floor slumped against the side of his bed, fast asleep. He cringes as the memory of the previous night comes back to him. He is ashamed of his actions, and puzzled by them. He doesn’t understand the things he does lately. It’s like he has no control over himself when it comes to John. Even now, sober in the light of day, he has to repress the urge to run his hand through John’s hair.
“Oh, my
“Footprints, mud, and coffee! I’ll meet you back home!” He claps John on the arm and vanishes, leaving John smiling a bit stupidly at the praise and his friend’s enthusiasm. Very little could be as exhilarating as Sherlock on the trail of a murderer. He notices Lestrade staring at him with a knowing grin.
"He does," Sherlock interrupts firmly. That much had been easy to deduce. "And in any case, I’ve found the young, educated set these days are less hung up on gender. It's rather fascinating."
"Twenty-two. I'm nearly twice his age. And he works for me, at least while he's still deciding on a graduate programme. It wouldn't be appropriate."
Sherlock allows himself to be roughly untied from the chair without a struggle and frogmarched out of the room and through a narrow corridor. He focuses on discreetly flexing arms and legs to restore circulation.
“And what if it was?” Sherlock demands, harshly. “How would you know? I was out of my mind, I needed something drastic to bring me back. I know you think you were just out of control, but you know me like no one ever has. I’m yours and I know you never would have hurt me, not in a way that matters. If you can’t trust your own judgement…trust mine?”
He disappeared into the back and returned with two cartons of the
Sherlock groaned, head in hands. Yes, he loved his parents dearly. He just preferred to love them from afar. They could be quite the helicopter parents.
“Yes, but it could be different. You met a pretty lady tonight and now you are thinking this is too much trouble for you and you’d rather marry, have kids, and do all those things that normal people like to do. Get on with rest of your life.”
"No. I have need of it." Sherlock said stubbornly, picking up his tools and holding them close to his chest.
"Yeah..." John's voice trailed off as he looked to the hardwood floor. Everything he was doing right now was contradicting against
"He hit me e-everyday for two weeks. Always so drunk you couldn't believe he was still standing. Left so many bruises I wore long sleeves in 26 degree weather. After every time, he asked me if I was gay. And I'd have to look him in the eye and say "No, sir. I am not gay.'" John's words stumbled as he remembered the horrific incident. He shuddered and leaned more into Sherlock's touch. Enough time had passed that he could think of the memory without his throat closing up and his eyes stinging with tears.
John didn’t let up on the tight grip he had on the back of Sherlock’s coat. His brow was heavy and his steps were carefully measured as he marched to the men’s room. He shoved people by without much care.
"I really do hate repeating myself. I'm going."
Sherlock staggered over, his eyes half lidded. He was quickly finding out he was more of a sleepy drunk than a partying one. John took hold of his thin wrists and pulled him over his knees with remarkable speed for a man so wasted.
“How’re you liking your drink?” Both Sherlock and John turned to face the other side of the countertop where a woman stood, big smile flashing at John. It was not a friendly smile. More like a “my bedroom’s upstairs do you wanna come look at it” smile.
Let me know what you think, I’m dying to hear some feedback for this one!
Moran sneered. "He doesn't want you. Not for this. Make up your mind."
"Oonnee."
Despite what everyone thought, he wasn’t actually
“What. The. Hell. Was that!” John tried to contain himself, but for fuck’s sake, Sherlock had been inches from being run over.
"Sherlock," John paused, surprised to hear his hoarse voice."You said something about rabbits last night." Sherlock's face visibly paled, which is a feat in itself considering how pale his normal complexion was. "Yes, and that you would return them on Monday. That's tomorrow."
"Go." Sherlock muttered, holding onto the stiff material of John's trousers.
A car pulled up near the building within minutes after John arrived. Mycroft carefully stepped out, a grim expression on his face. Sherlock and John walked out to meet him.
“At first, you seemed so angry, angrier than I’ve seen in a long time, loud and yelling. Now you’re still angry, but just quieter. I thought that you punishing me could make you calm down and not want to—“ Sherlock paused, looking up to John’s eyes, debating whether or not he should voice what he really thought.
John gave a half smile. “I’ve already made too many excuses. Can’t have any suspicions.” At the moment, John refused to leave Mary, saying that he couldn’t hurt young Rosie with a broken family. Not yet. Maybe when she was older.
"I have several wooden spoons in my kitchen, would you like me to fetch them and make use of them?" She was only bluffing, but found it hilarious at the quick way his cheeks pinked. "Or would you like me to call John?" Mrs Hudson added, catching the way his eyebrows jumped.
John lifted an eyebrow at the word several before speaking."Yes, I suppose I was."
John pushed the door of the men’s room so hard it swung on its hinges, revealing one solitary man washing his hands. The man’s eyes were wide at the boisterous entrance, the water continuing to run as he met John’s eyes.
Lestrade widened his eyes and nearly spilled his sloshing drink. It turns out Drunk Sherlock can remember his first name without a problem. That was definitely interesting. He promised himself to ask Sherlock about that in the future.
Sherlock nodded, knowing it might be a good long while before he could.
His eyes landed on John. His brows furrowed and his plump lips pursed. “Not good?”
"Thirty-five." Sherlock said darkly. He hid his face in his crossed arms, as it was blushing a bright red.
Mary would be coming to Baker Street soon, picking John up for dinner now that the case was solved. There was no case.
As soon as he opened the door, he was quickly met with a cloud of smoke. He coughed into his elbow, waving away the smoke.
-------
There were rabbits everywhere. There were at least four adult rabbits and twenty baby rabbits. They were all nearly pure white, save for very sparse and pale brown spots. "How the hell did you keep me from noticing?" John fought to keep his voice calm. The smell alone should have been noticeable.
Molly didn't start out drinking hard and fast. She took one here and there, and as the night progressed imbibed more than the rest. She was a quiet, shy little thing that sure could hold her liquor.
Sherlock’s eyes widened to dinner plates. He took in a sharp breath. Damn human bloody fucking emotion.
John returned to the side of the bed, cupping Sherlock’s cheek and giving a small kiss to his plump lips.
John smirked at the detective's usual cynical attitude. "C'mon. We can invite Molly and Greg for drinks. We can get a cake too."
“Did you forget? We’re visiting your parents tomorrow morning and it wouldn’t exactly be classy if you show up with a hangover.” John leaned over on the counter, stretching his legs and cracking his neck.
"The babies aren't yours though. Today, you will return them all back to the pet store. Understand?" John said, stepping out from the doorway. No matter how hungover he was, he still had to go to work, and his shift started soon.

Next to him lay something that could barely be called human. The body was terribly battered and bruised, blood slowly dripping to the floor.
"Here's what I don't get. You knew you'd get caught. You knew you'd get punished. So why do it? I know you're clever enough to sneak and put them somewhere more conspicuous. So why make it so obvious?" John asked, trying to figure out just why Sherlock would resort to such a blatant form of misbehavior. He usually was able to get away with his trouble for weeks without John figuring it all out.
(See the end of the chapter for
After that, the memories get blurry. One of them started crying. It just so happened that both were rather the “tell my life story and cry about it” type of drunk. Neither were sure who exactly it was or why they were crying. Nonetheless, the other offered a hug in response, and somehow they were kissing after that. Then more crying, and sweet, gentle kisses.
He was never going to repeat that day. There was no way in hell Sherlock was getting a spanking today.
John came home from the clinic holding a bag of take-away. He had grabbed some lo mein from the local Chinese restaurant for dinner. As he walked up the stairs to 221B, he could have sworn he heard some noises from 221C. He would have gone to investigate, but remembered that Mrs Hudson said she had a rodent problem down there, so he ignored it. He found Sherlock sitting at the kitchen table, dressed in his blue dressing gown. He was on his laptop, his face aglow with the light of the screen as he typed away at what John assumed to be another blog post on The Science of Deduction. When John neared, Sherlock quickly closed the chat screen and switched it to his blog.
“Hmmm,” John considers. “Do you want him to know?”
John thought briefly of trying to rouse him, but decided against it. He grabbed the spare quilt from the shelf of his bedside table and threw it over Sherlock, then settled himself in the only way he could fit on the bed, facing away from Sherlock, mirroring his position, each man’s toes to the backs of the other’s knees. John smiled to himself. Closeness.
“Bed? Coffee? Sex? Not in that order.”
mental?”
“Why the hell would I want that?”
John swallows hard. “Fine. I clearly can’t change your mind. But I won’t forget it. I don’t want to. It’s been some of the best…” his voice breaks a little. He clears his throat. “The best moments of my life have been with you, right here, over the past three months. I’m not giving those memories up, even if I have to give you up.”
them to hear. I want to make you scream until every last person in this building knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that you belong to me.”
John said nothing and resumed his quiet vigil.
Fear crossed the man’s face, and he opened his mouth as if he was about to offer information. Before he could speak, John heard a soft sound and two darts zipped past him, one embedding itself in the wall inches from his head, and the other finding his opponents throat.
John let out a sigh of relief, followed almost immediately by a swell of heartbreaking empathy. He was not the only who had felt alone, then. And how much worse had it been for Sherlock, to be unable to express this, even in the confines of his own head? To be constantly, forever, missing social cues, trying to find a connection with someone but never really knowing why it failed, until it was too late. Not knowing how to act as a friend or a lover, and not really knowing the difference between them. No wonder they had taken to each other so immediately, so desperately. And Sherlock was not asking John for something he wasn't sure he would be able to give, either.
John smacks him on the shoulder. “Conceited arsehole—Wait, what ball?!”
Some months later, John is going through the remaining stuff in his cupboard. He’s in a purging mood, and has decided that anything he hasn’t looked at in the past six months, with the exception of photographs and army mementos, needs to go.
“Everybody dies,” Sherlock says coldly. “You of all people should know that.”
“So, explain to me again what we are doing here,” he asks his glowering friend cheerfully, sipping his second…third…glass of good vintage champagne.
“You really ought to tell that man you aren’t dead,” she comments idly. “If only for the safety of others.”
John nods curtly and his fingers twitch like he's going to say something but he doesn't. He settles back in his chair and they drink their coffee in silence. John seems to relax and by the time they reach Bart's yet again he seems almost back to his usual self.
John looks completely unsurprised by any of this, if not exactly thrilled to see him. “Can I help you?” he asks, dryly.
“Not any more. But it’s effective. I’m sure he’s not the only nursery owner or farmer who keeps an old tin around to kill rats with. Oh…fantastic! Only one garden centre that is within walking distance – Gentle Billy’s Plants and Garden Supply, a cheerfully ironic name. Text Lestrade right now, hurry up… ready? ‘157 Bridge Rd, St. John’s Woods. Garden shop. Look for something missing from the pesticide shed and a man with size 12 wellies.’ Got it?”
"Oh shut up, you love it."
Before he can collect any data, the individual is gone and Sherlock is smacking into a set of doors. Relieved, without too much time to wonder about his benefactor, he pushes through and emerges in the less-than-fresh air of a London weekday morning. He walks just far enough out to avoid being slammed into by others coming through the doors and stops, lifting his head and inhaling deeply.
“What?”
“Glad it was worth it,” John says, still angry. “In the future could you please not hurt yourself deliberately in the pursuit of a case if you can possibly avoid it?”
“I know.”
There are too many sensations to process, and John is content to be still for a moment, being filled, being touched, being together. Slowly, Sherlock begins to move, lipping the back John’s neck, seeking permission. John rolls his hips in response, reaching back to grip Sherlock’s waist, keeping them tight together even as Sherlock thrusts, slow at first, then harder, matching his strokes to the tempo of his thrusting.
Sherlock peers beneath the lorry and raises an eyebrow. “I didn’t expect there to be more than two. That’s seven for you. A record?”
Sherlock snorts. “Oh yes, lovely. He’s lied to her extensively, lost their life savings gambling, put himself in hock to dangerous criminals, endangered her and her children through his folly, and left them on the brink of financial ruin that will take years to recover from. But she welcomes him back with kisses and tender words because she
John paused, and gave Mycroft a faint smile. “Likewise,” he said, and punched him as hard as he could in his ample stomach.
“Neither do I,” Sherlock said, cheerfully.
They wriggle out of trousers, now only in pants – two thin layers of fabric (one cotton, one silk) all that separates them. John feels Sherlock’s hardness against his own, pressing insistently up into him, and it is almost too much for him, but he wants to remember this moment.
“Well, no, but –”
"Still, I think I did rather well considering I was pretty well sure the Taliban were about to break down our door and also there might have been vampire birds after us," John points out, wiping his eyes. "I'd like to see you do better!"
Gradually, Sherlock does seem to become more comfortable with what they are doing, what they are. He is less vicious, less controlling, more able to let John be an equal partner in their lovemaking, to even take charge, dominate him occasionally. He feels safe with John, grateful that John never pressures him, never seems to judge, never demands what he cannot give. John accepts everything Sherlock throws at him, in bed and out of it.
“Well, in common parlance we seem to have just broken up, so I assumed…”
Sherlock has to trust that his unconscious mind has put this together for him correctly, that it's not just a shot in the dark. He maneuvers himself closer to the doors so he won't miss his chance again and braces himself for the stop. When he hears the hiss, he steps forward with the crowd, letting them carry him along.
“Yes, what?” the detective snaps.
“Sherlock…” John said, growing suspicious.
He is surprised at how much coaxing it takes for a man so obviously smitten, and begins to second-guess himself, wondering if he has misinterpreted all the signs. But once they meet in that first kiss, so soft and wet, Sherlock’s body trembling beneath his, wanting to respond even while being completely overwhelmed, John knows there is no turning back. That would be like death, he suspects, for both of them.
“What do I look like?” John asks, pulling back for just a moment. “Can you still see?”
“Mmm. Well, you know me, like to be thorough. Come on, John.”
Sherlock give a tiny, distant smile when Moriarty pulls away, visibly surprised at the lack of response. He straightens and steps back from his foe.
John nearly spits out his champagne. “Mycroft’s got a lady companion? Mycroft’s got any companion?”
“It’s touching that you think that, really John. But you're mixing up obligation with affection.”
“I know you probably won’t come round again,” she began.
….on our bloody sofa! What are we going do?”
She seems at least to consider that, if not accept it, taking a few moments to think before she replies. "If he's as thoroughly deflowered as you say, then why does he seem so..."
“This is the paper they print British banknotes on,” Sherlock says. “It’s a well-kept secret, for obvious reasons, but this is the factory that makes it. They’re very skilled. It’s shipped from here directly to the Bank of England, where it’s printed up and distributed.”
"You should have seen Sherlock!" she tells him a little gleefully, as she sets him up to convalesce in front of the telly, with firm instructions not to move off of the sofa. "He was like a great mother hen. Wouldn't leave you for a second - barely let even me near you till you'd been looked over. Don't torture him too much longer, John. He did save your life."
Sherlock looks trapped and annoyed, but doesn’t move away. He fidgets, and looks John directly in the eye. “I can’t tell you that Moriarty isn’t capable of instilling in me a sense of my own mortality, vulnerability even, that I am not accustomed to. And perhaps that has…coloured…my actions of late. But I don’t plan on dying any time in the immediate future. I have no doubt he will try to kill me, but I have no intention of allowing him to succeed. In fact, I much prefer it to be the other way round.”
"Don't go overboard with the compliments or anything," John mutters. "All right. Chat her up. For any particular purpose?"
“I think that was my point,” John mutters and goes to make coffee. He’s starting to feel like this case is eating their life. Literally every waking hour of Sherlock’s and most of his own are devoted to it and they are making almost no progress. Sherlock hasn’t gotten properly dressed in several days, though at least he still showers and grooms himself meticulously.
John forces himself to relax, to bite back the anger and jealousy that makes him want to storm out of the room and leave Sherlock there, exposed and unfulfilled. He knows he should reward Sherlock for making the right choice, prioritizing him, but what he really wants is to punish Sherlock for the fact that he would even consider doing something different, that he even has to fight the urge to come running at her call. For the fact that he’s left his phone on, for the fact that he’s never changed that damned text alert, for the fact of the woman’s existence at all.
He realized only then that it had not occurred to him to simply move downstairs and let Sherlock have the bed alone. This was not a position he had ever imagined himself in, even after meeting Sherlock. It felt alien, but it felt… right, too. He relaxed. It didn’t need to be anything else, not right now and maybe not ever. It didn’t need a name. He let his hand drift behind him and rest on Sherlock’s feet, and slowly he fell asleep.
