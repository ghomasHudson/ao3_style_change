The barn was not quite what Dean had been expecting. He’d been thinking of a barren, cavernously empty space, filled with a smattering of hay, and he was briefly distracted by everything he was seeing.
“Stay with me a moment longer,” Castiel begged. It began to rain harder still. “I don’t want this moment to end,” he whispered, squeezing his eyes shut and forcing himself to rise despite every inch of him protesting that he wanted to stay in the warmth of Dean’s arms just a minute more.
Sighing, Castiel motioned to the drier land up past the river bank. “You can sleep anywhere above the flood line. The animals of the forest won’t harm you, and the others won’t come until dawn.”
In which Castiel admits that there is, indeed, such thing as too many dogs, Dean experiences mixed emotions about putting Mirabel up for adoption, and Sam gets the short end of the stick when it comes to sleeping arrangements and discovers that the ratio of dogs that can fit on any one bed is higher than he'd previously believed.
Castiel put a hand on Dean’s elbow, and led him over to Ace’s crate, when the dog was sitting placidly, no doubt awaiting his new life with equal parts excitement and trepidation. “It’s okay, Dean,” he said, wishing he could offer more than platitudes. “Go say goodbye.”
“Dean Winchester, you are my everything. I know I’m leaving in a few days, but I promise I’ll write and call and visit. I can’t imagine life without you. So, this is me, asking: Will you marry me?”
Holding up a hand to silence him, Michael said, “Sam and Dean were unstoppable. Not even God could help those who tried to stand in their way,” he hissed. “And now you’ve unleashed their memories. Anything could happen.”
Not to worry, I have not forgotten this story - I have just been super busy. Please enjoy this chapter, and let me know what you think!
“No!” Castiel exploded. “No, you don’t. You haven’t laid eyes on your beloved since the Fall. You won’t even look at him from afar, let alone visit him! You say you love him, yet-”’
Castiel was crying openly now, and Dean thought that it didn’t bode well – that this angel, the one who had raised him from perdition, the one he’d fought to stop the apocalypse with, the one who had still been learning how to be human, was weeping. “Dean,” Castiel pleaded. “Please don’t make me lose you again.”
“Gabriel,” Dean called. “Please…” Gabriel stilled. “Please make me remember. I need to remember. I don’t care if it kills me. I’d rather die for who I am, with those I love, than stay here and live a lie.”
“Gabriel,” Castiel greeted. The frustration in his voice melted away slightly. “What brings you to this neck of the woods?”
“Look at me, Castiel,” Dean said, and the angel helplessly complied, turning his gaze back to meet Dean’s. “Beautiful,” Dean murmured, eyes roving over the length of Castiel’s nude body, exposed for him and him alone. “Exquisite,” he added, pressing a line of tiny kisses along Castiel’s hips, so close to his length he could feel Dean’s rhythmic breathing billowing against his cock, making him ache for more. Then Dean began to lick him, just inches away from where he needed a warm, perfect mouth, and Castiel flew apart, writhing in his bonds so hard that the bed began to shake.
“I want them to have a choice,” Castiel said, falling to his knees. “Isn’t that what we were fighting for?”
He sat up, and once again made a desperate gesture for his coffee. “What time is it?” He asked blearily.
Sam came rushing out of the trees, looking like he was caught somewhere in that liminal space halfway between a child and a man. “Dean?” he asked.
He couldn’t stay underwater forever, though, and after about a week of this, he finally broke and climbed onto the banks of the river. The world had changed since he’d last seen it from this angle, and he marveled at the late-blooming flowers and the thickening of the forest’s canopy. A riot of green greeted him, and he shielded his eyes despite the evening’s gentle light.
He went to the cellar where they kept their food and potions, and gathered the most recent vials that his brother had laid out for him, all neatly labeled in pictographs that were drawn neatly yet hurriedly, and he made a mental note to remind the other to draw slower next time.
Violet turned to look at Castiel, who gave her a smile. “The one dog we have for adoption that I think might fit your family’s needs is Ace. He’s one of our youngest dogs, and I think he’s a better choice than Mirabel. She can be short tempered.” He frowned. “The only problem is, Ace has become attached to one of our kittens.”
“Sam,” came a voice that was unfamiliar to the brothers. Its speaker sounded utterly betrayed, and Sam turned to the sound like a planet turns towards the sun, a lost look in his eyes. “Castiel,” he breathed, turning to his brother. “You summoned me here for –
Castiel turned away. “I was tasked with cleansing this river. The process is sustained by what’s left of my Grace. We… We wanted to make the world habitable for you. Here,” he said, tossing Dean the necklace he’d showed Gabriel.
The first dog had been Dean’s idea. He gladly surrendered the sliver of his bed that wasn’t already taken up by a long-limbed bed hog of an angel to the mutt. He’d even bought it treats, and a higher-end kibble.
The stars were fading with the dawn, and he watched the last of them dim and disappear, contemplating the world they’d left behind. Nights with Castiel always had sent him back to the fathomless wilds of the past, when they’d been glowing and golden in their youths; but that light had long since fled, and they were left to face the savage dawn of a brave new world – older, perhaps, but scarcely wiser.
In the distance, Sam could hear someone calling his name, but Gabriel just clung to him tighter, and Sam still couldn’t find the words to protest. Eyes wide, he nodded.
Gabriel looked around at the gathering twilight. “It’s getting late. I should be back before nightfall if I leave now.”
When they slowed to a halt, the two mares breathing fast under them, they were laughing and breathless.
He greeted them all, and was rewarded with a soft nuzzle by a racoon, as well as a squeak from a possum. The other animals were not so enterprising, and kept their distance. Castiel respected this; the balance of the forest was a delicate one, as he knew, perhaps better than anyone else alive in the woods. It required striking a fragile peace between all creatures, each of which took only what they needed of the world and from each other, unlike those who had gone before them.
Castiel put a hand on Dean’s knee, prompting Dean to meet his gaze. “If you’re not ready for this, we can put it on hold.”
The water burbled in response, and Dean grinned. “I was wondering… I mean,” Dean paused, his mother’s voice echoing in his mind.
By the time the third dog rolled into their lives, Dean was beginning to suspect that his life would never be the same and began to have prophetic visions of their bed, completely taken over by a variety of dogs of all shapes and sizes, all merrily snoring away, while he and Castiel slowly became resigned to sleeping in whatever tiny spaces the dogs generously left to them.
“I know. But Ace told me that he was happy with where he was going, and he promised me he’d take good care of his new baby brother and he also said to me that he’d never forget either of us, for our kindness, and for our strength.”
“I assume,” Castiel hastened to add. “I mean, I can’t read his mind or anything,” he said, and Dean rolled his eyes at the obvious bluff. “I just presume that’s what he was thinking about, but in any case, once he met Cherry Pie, he was a new dog. I think he’s ready for his forever home now.”
Castiel couldn’t help but grin. “Animals can be slow to trust humans. Trust must be earned, usually. You have to approach the animal slowly. Establish that you’re not a threat. Sometimes, it can take hours. Days, even. The taming of a wild thing is done with great patience and great love.”
Turning away at the mention of Lucifer, Castiel bit his lip and tried to calm his racing mind and his traitorous heart.
So I have this vision in my mind of Castiel taking progress photos of the house and barn he renovated and giving them to Dean in an album as an anniversary present. (Shh, don't tell Dean.)
“I love you too,” Castiel whispered before raising one hand and bringing Dean in for a savage kiss. Dean was helpless in the face of such an onslaught of pleasures. He came hard, grunting out his pleasure and briefly collapsing on top of Castiel.
“I did,” Castiel agreed. “Come, sit.” He motioned to a spot a few paces away from the river, where they could sit and stay dry.
“Cas…” Dean’s mind was racing almost as fast as his pulse. “Everyone says you’re ancient. You’ve been in that river more winters than I’ve been alive.”
Gabriel turned to Samandriel. “Take her away. If this thing goes wrong…” He let his voice trail off, hoping the other angel would catch his meaning. “This is my fight,” he said, jaw working as he turned to each of his little brothers and sisters in turn. “Go. All of you. Go to your beloveds.”
Castiel’s heart was thundering in his chest, and his breath was coming in little desperate gasps. He just turned his face into the crook of his elbow, the long expanse of his arm pulled taut by the soft padded restraints that tethered him to the bed.
For a while, he sulked – there was no other word for the way he refused to surface for days. The dryads that weren’t Dean began to wonder at the absence of the surly nymph. They said as much, and Castiel was all too happy to indulge their desire for him to be gone.
Sam’s face lit up. “Sort of? I mean, I know you said you were taking a break and everything, but there are these kittens that were abandoned at a farmer’s front door a few towns over and-”
Eventually, he rolled over onto his side of the small, narrow bed, and held Castiel close to him in the aftermath.
For a beat, Gabriel looked torn. “I’d like that very much,” he whispered back. “But I’m needed elsewhere,” he said, voice hardening.
“I promise,” Dean said, though his heart skipped an uncomfortable beat, its stutter rendering him suddenly breathless. He wasn’t sure ‘careful’ was the word he’d use to describe the way his heart melted at the thought of the nymph. It wasn’t as though he were treading into those uncertain waters; he was plummeting.
“Well, we’re one for two here. And I’m not going to risk your life with those kind of odds,” Gabriel said, with a meaningful glance at Sam.
A flock of misgivings and regrets took form in his chest, beating their savage wings against the cage of his ribs.
Closing his eyes as if defeat, Castiel sighed, “You were loved by many of our kind, but by none more than me.”
He couldn’t help but smile at the way Dean was looking at him, and he said, “Now you’re the one looking at me like that,” he chided gently.
Dean leaned down and kissed him. It was a hungry, desperate kiss, but it was also so full of love that Castiel was overcome. Dean’s hand moved frantically between their bodies, and it wasn’t long until Castiel was coming with a long, drawn-out moan, spilling into Dean’s hand and going limp under him.
When he opened them again, Dean had divested himself of his underwear, finally, finally; they’d been at this for so long that Castiel had lost track of the hours. He was pleased to see that Dean looked nearly as desperate as he, cock red and flushed and leaking pre-cum.
Dean found himself being pulled in, the cold water filling his lungs and inciting a momentary lapse into panic. He spluttered as he swam up to the surface. “I’m sorry,” he gasped, heaving himself back onto the bank. “Forget I asked.”
“Ace. He’s good with kids – he came from a family with three of them, but when the family moved to the city, the new landlords wouldn’t let them keep him.” Castiel’s face twisted into a grimace. “Ace was heartbroken, and for a while, he didn’t want anything to do with the other dogs, and he just keep thinking about his old family and-”
Dean had rolled his eyes at that. Like many of the younger generation of dryads, he took stories of ‘the Great Awakening’ with a grain of salt. It was true that there hadn’t always been dryads in these wilds, that much was certain. If there had always been, the ancient trees wouldn’t be troubled by the kind of blight they were, and their trunks wouldn’t be so sooty. There must have been some great fire, it was presumed, that had killed the previous generations of their kind. But that didn’t explain why there was no evidence of their existence whatsoever – no hordes of acorns hidden away in trees too high up for the squirrels to reach, no burnt patches indicative of the ruins of woven shelters, no meticulously kept patch of wildflowers where one or another of their kind had tried to woo their beloved. If there had been others, before the so-called Great Awakening, they’d left no trace of their existence.
Already, he could imagine the long, dark winter of the soul that was sure to follow the death of love – already, he could imagine Castiel stepping onto the train that would carry him towards the coast, fingers pressed against the glass, but only for so long. Letters were sure to follow, late-night texts that would slowly wane into the occasional postcard and infrequent phone calls and an ocean of longing, the distance between them slowly growing insurmountable.
“You’re okay.” Dean’s voice was a steady presence above him, the pressure of Dean's hips against his own a comforting weight. “I’m right here.”
“Of course, you will. But they’ll always be with you,” Castiel replied, bringing his hand up and pressing it over Dean’s heart. “In here.”
They kissed for a while before coming up for air, both of them breathless from the meeting of their lips.
“Thank you for the water. I just woke up and I was so thirsty I could have drunk a whole horn of mead by myself.” He smiled at the image that conjured in his mind. “I was wondering if you could tell me about the Great Awakening.”
In the distance, Gabriel could hear Michael calling their names. The sun was rising, and with it, the creatures of the forest.
“Show off,” Cas grumbles and Dean laughs before dipping his head down for another kiss, which Cas happily supplies.
, of course, had been no help at all, just giving Cas his own petrified look and helpless shrug as Ellen bundled him from the room. And that’s how Cas ended up at Chipotle, being grilled even more thoroughly than the overcooked steak in his burrito bowl.
in The Empty. “You sure it’s not just because you kind of like us after all?” he asks, arching a teasing eyebrow.
“Asshole,” Dean grumbles and Cas lets out an undignified snort, wiping tears from his eyes as Dean rebuttons his jeans.  He breaks into giggles all over again when Dean grimaces and readjusts his still half-hard cock.
The plump blonde snorts, pushing a wayward fringe of hair out of her eyes as she leans against the doorjamb. “Maybe you oughtta be the one fostering him then. He seems to like you.”
Surprised, Dean fights a blush. How did Cas know that? “I might’ve,” he mumbles in a casual tone that’s sure to be a dead giveaway.
“Big brother’s prerogative,” Dean finishes for him with a wink.  “It’s okay, Cas.  I get it.  I would have been just as pissed if someone had walked out on Sammy like that.  Speaking of which, I need to call the little moose before he gets it in his head to do something stupid, like come over here.”  Rolling away from Cas with no little difficulty, he sits up and reaches for his phone where it sits on the nightstand by his side of the bed.
Castiel would be ashamed of the joy this brings him if he were even capable of such an emotion anymore.  It may not seem like much, but transferring to a commode means no more bedpans and is one step closer to pissing in privacy, so he’ll take it.  RBF’s uninspiring countenance aside, Castiel’s day is looking up.
standing next to him.  Castiel is fully focused on his husband, eyes adoring, smile wide and genuine, features wrinkled in mirth.
Chuckling, Castiel sits the wine on the table and takes his seat between Dean and Sam.  While they eat and talk and laugh, he looks around, studying the faces of his assembled family in quiet appreciation.  Dean catches him staring at one point and gives him the same soft smile that’s made Castiel melt since that very first day, when a firefighter with summer-green eyes smiled at him through the shattered remains of a windshield.  He still can’t believe they’ve made it here.  He’s still aware their relationship is going to take work and that all the love in the world won’t make the wounds they’ve both suffered disappear overnight, but he’s proud of what they’re building with one another now.
Frowning at his phone, Dean sits down heavily at the spindly kitchen table. CJ seems genuinely remorseful, but Dean isn’t quite ready to forgive him yet. He blinks in surprise. Huh. He hadn’t realized until just now that he was even considering forgiving CJ, but there it is.
“Because you did, Cas. At least for a minute, you did.” Dean presses and Cas drops his eyes, unable to disagree. “If you believed that, for even a minute, man, why are you still here?”
“This okay?” he asks softly, nearly nose-to-nose with Castiel as his hands trail across Castiel’s shoulders, shucking off the unbuttoned shirt.
Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop him from picturing bottle green eyes and cupid’s bow lips as he counts backwards from one hundred and surrenders to the gentle lull of anesthesia.
“Oh, Dean.” He shifts back on the couch, turning to face Dean more fully, disturbing the bag still lying between them and feeling something hard roll against his hand.
Keeping an iron-fisted grip on Dean’s arm that’s certain to leave a mark, Castiel uses his remaining energy to propel them both toward the shore, leaving the capsized fishing boat behind them.  Releasing Dean once they’re safe on the sandy beach, Castiel hovers above the young man.
Even more powerful than the first, the second blast rips the hunter and angel apart, throwing them both to the ground, several feet from their original positions. Castiel would think they were experiencing an earthquake, if such a natural phenomenon could make the very air vibrate with menace.
Sam.  The Sammy who’s had Dean’s back their whole goddamn lives.  The brother he’s hunted with; fought with; grieved their mom, dad, and Bobby with.  The brother who would still be locked up in that goddamn basement, being tortured by that British bitch, if Dean weren’t here.  This is the Sam who gets Dean like no one else ever has.. well, with maybe one exception, Dean thinks, glancing at the angel across the table.
Dean’s been at the coffee shop for nearly a week when a familiar red head of hair bounces through the doorway and spreads her arms wide.
As much as Dean has loved everything he and Cas have done together, there’s still something else he wants with Cas, but he’s been unsure how to broach the subject.  Everything else they’ve done together has seemed to come as a sort of natural progression, but
Moving into Lucifer’s space, Jack meets him eye for eye. “I’m nothing like you,” he says vehemently. “You’re...broken. Diseased. I can see it now.” He looks Lucifer up and down, a slightly vacant look in his softly glowing eyes as he examines the True Form behind Lucifer’s human guise. “Every piece of you is twisted and rotten. There’s no part of you unblemished.” He meets Lucifer’s gaze once more, eyes full of remorse. “Nothing left to save.”
” the tiny redhead answers shrilly, “after a slight difference of opinion, this is true, but that entire situation was blown far out of proportion.  That young man could have turned into a newt any number of ways. There was no reason for them to blame me. If one can’t trust one’s sister-witches, who can one trust?”
At Dean’s questioning look, he elaborates, “I’m an English teacher.  I love words.  Like most things, words only have the value that we assign them.  There are no such things as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ words, only words that should or shouldn’t be used in certain contexts or by certain people.  Most children are able to understand that certain words are only allowed to be used by adults.”
As he wheels into his room, he’s surprised to see Dean stretched out in the chair next to his bed, legs crossed in front of him and hands folded across his stomach, upturned face watching Cupcake Wars on Castiel’s TV.
“Yeah?”  Jo’s grin is uncharacteristically bashful and Charlie didn’t think she could fall any more in love with her best friend, but Merlin’s beard was she wrong!
“You’re welcome,” he says gruffly, before nodding at the still untouched phone. “I should at least read it, right?”
Dean shakes his head at his other-world self as he slides behind Baby’s wheel.  Man restores classic cars for a living and his husband drives around in
The life he and Dean share together is a happy one and for his part, Dean seems content.  However, as the days stretch on, Castiel finds himself becoming increasingly dissatisfied with his vessel and the limits it places on the nature of his and Dean’s relationship.
Sure enough, it’s approximately twenty-seven seconds later when Claire’s head pops up from her pillow. “I wan’ nack.”
Lisa coos sweetly over Claire’s chubby, chocolate-coated cheeks, “She’s adorable, Dean.  And she really seems to adore you.”
Striding onto the stage with a wave and a fixed smile, Dean wonders, for what must be the hundredth time, if this was a huge mistake. Fergus Crowley is known for going off-script and pulling more from his guests than they ever intended to share. The man has been after Dean for years, sending
“Well if I’m Robin and Cas here is Batman, I guess that makes Red there Harley Quinn and you must be... Poison Ivy?”
“I tried to tell you,” she points out reasonably, “and I stayed out of the pool for the longest time, but the stakes were getting ridiculous. You just won me two hundred bucks, dude!”
“Oh, uh,” Dean rubs the back of his neck in that nervous gesture Castiel loves so much, “Balthazar.”
“Are you kidding?” Kaia asks. “She’ll have this posted on every account she has, which is pretty much all of them, before we leave the building.”
Cas reaches behind himself for the wheelchair’s armrests and gingerly lowers himself down, wincing as he settles himself into the seat.
period English 10 class.  The bottom card is perhaps the one that surprises Castiel the most.  It’s from the staff of Shawnee Mission North and nearly every member is accounted for, even Mr. Walker, and Castiel takes a moment to wonder how Charlie accomplished
“You’re perfect,” Cas murmurs in return. “Gorgeous.” He leans down to kiss Dean’s forehead. “Kind.” His cheeks. “Selfless.” Their cocks graze one another maddeningly with each kiss and Dean whines as his hips buck up of their own accord. Chuckling, Cas leans over Dean one more time, rolling his hips teasingly as he grabs Dean’s pillows and prompts him to sit up so he can position them behind him.
, this past year has been one of hardest and most terrifying experiences of my life, but it’s also been the most rewarding. My work at The Bean, this apartment, they’re the first accomplishments I’ve ever actually felt proud of. I’m sure that sounds stupid to you, but it’s true.”
As the EMT starts to argue, Dean talks over him, “Look, it’s pretty clear that moving hurts him.  There’s no reason to move him more than you have to.  Leave it.”
Castiel spins, but the threat on his lips is silenced when Jack turns after him, the entirety of his eyes bathed in glistening gold. Jack drops his gaze and with a jerk of his head, Castiel is thrown to the side, finding himself on the ground along with his brothers as wings begin to emerge from Jack’s human-appearing frame.
He and Raphael step away to give the three of them a moment to say their (temporary, Dean reminds himself) goodbyes.
you too, you know.  You better tell that succu-bitch to keep her damn hands to herself.”  Ah, Castiel had thought Meg let her hand linger a little longer on necessary on his arm, but he’s fairly certain it was only to rile Dean up.  Apparently, it worked.
“Hey, guys.  What’s going on?” Dean asks, starting to walk towards them, then pausing in confusion as Castiel holds up a hand.
“Sorry Charlie, but Harvelle’s giant head was blocking my view,” Ash smirks, gesturing to the left of the two computer monitors that take up the majority of the small desk.  Admittedly, it’s a tight fit for all three of them to crowd around the two screens, even with Ash perched on the edge of Charlie’s bed behind her and Jo.
Cas squeezes him around the waist and Dean drops an answering kiss on top of his head before finishing the song.
Maybe it’s because Dean still looks a little lost, lying there in that hospital bed, likes he doesn’t quite believe Cas really is coming back.
For nearly a full minute after his confession, Sam just stares at him in stunned silence...before suddenly doubling over in laughter. Yup. That feels
Castiel pulls back far enough to meet Dean’s eyes. “I enjoy everything we do together Dean, but I have to admit, I think
Dean...can no longer sense Dean’s emotions...the love that had moored him so securely in the midst of the tempest. His anchor ripped cruelly away, he drifts...untethered. He doesn’t weep. He doesn’t mourn. The effort would require far more energy than what he has...and what he has is fading quickly. It will be a relief, he thinks, to fade to nothing. A relief, except for…
Three faces light up with anticipatory grins and Charlie nudges Jo with her elbow, “Good call on the lube moat.”
“She’s right, Dean,” Sam says seriously.  “Believing Rhonda Hurley when she said she wouldn’t show anyone that picture of you wearing her panties is what makes you unintelligent.”
As Castiel wheels up to the table, he catches sight of their meal and grins at Dean, “Dean-burgers?”
So there you have it!  What did you think?  If you're concerned that they missed something in their big feelings talk, fear not!  We sill have a whole other chapter of feelings, fluff, and smut coming soon!  You may have noticed that I added a final chapter count for this story!  All we have left after this is one chapter (23) and an epilogue!  It's been such a wild ride, I can't believe it's almost over!  I'll be posting the next chapter on Tusday and the final chapter Next Thursday.
and his best options are currently hopeless romantic and self-proclaimed super hacker (whatever that is, Charlie assures him he doesn’t need to know) Charlie Bradbury, or Gabriel (the horror of which actually makes him shudder).  Reluctantly, he tells Charlie all about Dean, careful not to use the firefighter’s name.  Not only would the well-intentioned computer science teacher stalk all of Dean’s social media accounts, she’d probably also manage to obtain a full background check and a copy of his credit report.  Castiel
“Thanks, Charlie, really. Again,” Dean says earnestly as the sour-faced teenage cashier rings up his items, clearly annoyed that he’s still here ten minutes past closing. Dean shoots her an apologetic smile and offers Charlie a grateful two-finger salute as he heads back out into the cold.
“Ask me to stay,” Cas purrs in Dean’s ear, guttural and low, before nipping at Dean’s earlobe and pressing a kiss just below it.
He can’t help but be curious about CJ’s job. “Customer service” could be anything from retail to high-end event coordinating, to sex work, to the
bed, of course), Dean remembers the feel of his arm around the other man’s shoulders at dinner, and he grimaces at the memory of that ridiculous show he put on for Sam and Jess.  Cas had seemed okay with it at the time, but was he really?  Christ, Dean had made
“It’s tomato rice,” Dean explains as Cas stirs the soup in his mug. “My mom used to make it for me, and then I made it for Sammy when I got old enough.”
Nodding mutely, Castiel begins bouncing his leg up and down as he fights against both his rebellious stomach and his traitorous brain.  His stomach rolls with every dip and turn.  He winces as the phantom sound of crunching metal fills his ears every time a car veers too close to their lane.
Feeling her face flush as red as her hair, Charlie clears her throat and manages to squeak out, “Look, I think something’s happening.”
Trying to ignore the renewed heat in his cheeks, he opens his mouth to deny her (incredibly accurate) observation, but is blissfully saved from responding by a sudden joyful screech.  Dean’s pretty sure he didn’t know that
“It doesn’t really matter now, does it?”  he snaps.  “Either way, Dean and I are no longer friends.”
thinking about the fact that he just told Cas to wear his clothes, Dean leaves the bedroom, pulling the door shut behind him and making his way to the kitchen via his usual route of hallway, bathroom, and cat hurdles. He only trips over Cupcake once, which might be a new record.
“Yeah. The brick makes it feel a little rustic, but the bright colors make it feel a bit fresher. Not just the kind of coffee shop you can visit in the morning, but an all-day kind of place, you know?”
“Aww, are you tired, sweet girl?” Dean asks, stroking Claire’s soft curls and rocking her slowly, side-to-side, before glancing back up at Anna, “How’d she do today?”
“I don’t blame you, you know. I’ve never liked feeling trapped either.” When Castiel finds just the right spot behind Benny’s left ear, the cat flops onto his side, seemingly forgetting that he’s supposed to be big and tough and soaking up the affection instead.
“Cas.” She sees Dean’s mouth form the word as he nods toward Rowena, clearly having to use every bit of his own borrowed power to hold his point in the pentagram. But Castiel is already moving towards the vampires, his angel blade falling into his hand as goes. Far behind him, Rowena catches sight of another figure. Scythe in-hand and eyes on Rowena, Betty stands sentinel on the other side of the field. Even from this distance, her pale face radiates concern, but true to her duty, she doesn’t intervene.
The flight from San Francisco International Airport to LAX takes a little over an hour and a half.  Taking deep breaths through his nose as the plane taxis to the gate (Fuck, he hates flying. Why didn’t he just rent a goddamn car and drive, again?), Dean switches his phone off airplane mode and slips it back into his pocket, closing his eyes against the nausea still rolling through him. He feels the phone buzzing with missed calls and text messages, but ignores it. It’s probably Sam, demanding to know what the hell happened last night and giving him shit for disappearing without so much as a “see you later,” but no way can he deal with his well-intentioned moose of a brother right now. He’ll call him back later. Sam will understand.
being attached to a face with such a strong, masculine jawline. Castiel had barely been able to look him in the face when Dean appeared at his side, prompting him to turn the heat down on his cooktop. It was like looking into the sun. And Dean’s later revelation that he’s bisexual certainly hadn’t helped quell Castiel’s attraction.
“So, Dean,” starts Sam as the three of them sit down to dinner (prepared by Dean, because neither Sam nor Jess can do much more in the kitchen than boil water) in Sam and Jess’ spacious Kansas City apartment.  They’d upgraded from their modest one-bedroom when Sam landed a job at one of Kansas City’s top law firms after passing the Kansas bar two years ago. “How’s
“Mother,” Fergus answers and Claire’s eyes widen in recognition. He smirks at the wee blonde girl, but directs his words at Rowena. “Don’t tell me the cast of Toddlers and Tiaras here is your new coven.”
They make their way into the familiar house, with Dean leading the way.  As much as Castiel loves his adopted family, it’s going to take some time before he’s comfortable just walking in without knocking the way Dean does.  To be honest, having grown up in a home with a high-level security system and then spending most of his adult life in Chicago, the fact that the Singer-Harvelles leave their door
“Alright, keep your diaper on, you,” Dean grumbles affectionately, scooping the carrier up in one hand and waving goodbye to Cas as he heads toward the door.
” He lets go of Castiel’s cock to gesture between them and Castiel would really regret asking if it weren’t for Dean’s next words, “You being your usual snarky self and giving me shit with that fancy English teacher vocabulary of yours.”
“I think where we need to start,” Garth finishes, “is with a little respect for my hombre, Castiel, here.”
After dumping the ground beef into the bowl, Dean adds a conglomeration of spices and begins mixing it with his hands, a process Castiel refuses to watch. His Dean-hand-kink certainly hasn’t
“Like hell you will,” Rowena hisses fiercely, speeding up her pace, her hands flying between the cauldron and her assembled spell ingredients. Chuck spins, his face splitting in a darkly amused grin as he catches sight of her. Apparently Jack’s power shielding trick doesn’t include sound-proofing from superhuman hearing. Ah, well. She’s nearly ready anyway.
Several long seconds later, the blinding light fades, leaving a very stunned Amara in its place. His great-aunt runs hands over a body that must feel familiar and foreign all at once before looking at Jack in astonishment. “I’m…”
They would have invited Kali to join them, of course, but since she’s Hindu and doesn’t celebrate Christmas, she always volunteers for the Christmas Day shift at the hospital where she works as a pediatrician—the same hospital where Castiel was treated after his accident, in fact.
“Well, let’s go say hello then.” They stand up, Dean not without a little difficulty which Jack knows from previous experience to ignore. Dean will complain all day that his “knees aren’t what they used to be,” but that won’t stop him from tearing someone else’s head off if they offer him a hand.
Castiel freezes, ice water flooding his veins. He straightens and his eyes snap to Dean’s, who’s stepped back as far as he can in the narrow entryway.
For a while that was his dad’s garage. It had been John’s dream to hand that garage over to Dean someday and his old man wanted that so badly that Dean couldn’t help but want to give it to him. So, he tried to make it his dream as well, but it never quite fit. If he’s honest, he’d felt more relief than sadness when they’d lost the business to John’s debt. Just because he loves working on the Impala his dad left him doesn’t mean he likes playing “guess the noise” with some yuppie’s import.
in there, not just a handsome stranger with soulful blue eyes, and he shudders internally.  He’s suddenly grateful that Cas refused to let Charlie introduce them.
Seeing Castiel’s gaze lingering where their joined hands rest on the seat between them, Dean clears his throat and leans back in his seat, releasing Castiel’s hand and moving his own to his lap.
“Okay,” announces Mom-Bun cheerfully.  “Let’s get you sitting up!  If that goes okay, we may even try standing today!”
Cas grunts in acknowledgement of Dean’s presence, but doesn’t lift his head or open his eyes, keeping them squeezed closed against the pain.  He shakes his head a couple of times, indicating that he’s unable to explain.
This place exists outside of linear concepts of time, so Castiel isn’t sure how long he’s been arguing with his brothers, but it certainly
As Gabe bats innocent eyelashes at his now glowering best friend, Dean interrupts, “Don’t you see the glasses? Clearly, I’m Clark Kent.”
Dean rolls onto his side and props himself up on his elbow to get a better look at Castiel, who copies the position.
The least he can do is let Cas in a little. First though, he’s gonna need a little more liquid courage. As he talks, Dean deposits his empty bottle on the counter, taking Cas’ and doing the same before retrieving each of them a new beer from the fridge.
“I’m not,” Dean agrees. “I just mean that no matter how or when our dumb asses figured this out, I think I still would have chosen you. Not because it was ‘meant to be’ or some bullshit, just because you’re
Brushing his teeth and shaving over an actual sink and not just a basin is another novelty in which Castiel delights.  Donna seems equally pleased, beaming at him periodically as she quickly and efficiently tidies the bathroom, piling wet towels and washcloths out of the way into the shower.  Since Castiel doesn’t have a roommate, they don’t have to worry about anyone else needing the shower before the nursing techs get a chance to take the towels to the laundry.
He’s a little surprised the coffeeshop is even open with it being a federal holiday and even more surprised to see that they’re fairly busy.  He smiles when he spots the large sign out front, announcing a special, “Last Day of Summer” game day for the local high school students.  He can see why Cas and Charlie choose to hold so many of their GSA meetings here.  In fact, he recognizes several GSA members from his time spent volunteering at their fundraisers and events.  The kids eagerly greet Cas with a smile, a laugh, and sometimes a hug and they grin and wave excitedly when Cas turns and points Dean out in the car.
” Dean pants into the sheets, face buried in the crook of one arm as he reaches the other behind himself to grab at Cas’ thighs, pulling him in as deeply as possible.
On the Supernatural front, I'm fairly certain unless this fic and Netflix are your ONLY interaction with Supernatural, you probably have an idea of what happened in this week's episodes. Be warned, there may be spoilers in the comments! I will bury my own semi-spoilery thoughts down as far as I can in the end notes, so make sure you exit out of your browser without scrolling down when you finished the story to avoid them.
“Why’d you do it?” Sam asks the question he’d promised himself he wouldn’t. “I get that you were under Chuck’s influence and felt...trapped and whatever else, but still, Dean. Things had been...better with you and Jack. I thought you were close to forgiving him.”
the asshole’s mask begins to slip and Dean can see the frustration written all over his face. Good. At least Dean’s not the only one facing disappointment tonight. His irritation still mounting, Dean finally gets an opportunity for something he
Finally, Cas pulls off, only to collapse on the floor, laughing uncontrollably while Dean struggles to pull his pants back up.
Hearing a baby’s squeal, followed by a quiet laugh, Dean stops outside the door to his friend’s new hospital room and peers inside.  He sees Cas, sitting on top of the bed covers, legs stretched out in front of him.  The man looks soft and slightly rumpled in his t-shirt and flannel pants, but a gummy smile lights up his face, making him look younger than Dean’s ever seen him.  Even in the shitty fluorescent hospital lighting, Cas is handsome.  His hair looks freshly washed, sticking out at angles, soft and fluffy without product.  His brilliant, shining blue eyes are crinkled around the edges in mirth behind rectangular, black frames and the day’s scruff along his jawline only adds to the appeal.  The new pajamas give Dean a better view of Cas’ body than the oversized, dingy hospital gown had.  His dark gray t-shirt is tightly fitted, stretching across his chest and outlining the well-defined muscles there.  The sleeves hug lean, but muscular arms and the flannel pants look soft and well-worn, but still pull taut across thick runner’s thighs where they’re lying
a demonstration,” calls the woman who’s still standing next to Billie, looking entirely unfazed. Castiel supposes he can understand Death not being knocked sideways by Jack’s powers. After all, Death is the only force that even entities like Chuck...and Jack...are subject to. It does grate a bit that Billie’s still standing as well, though. Castiel is quietly pleased to see her looking uncharacteristically shaken, however, her face for once missing its normally smug, knowing expression as she stares at Jack like she’s truly seeing him for the first time.
“Because eight o’clock in the morning is too early for an ugly sweater party,” Charlie explains as if that’s the most obvious reasoning in the world.
“I said, no,” Castiel protests loudly.  “I’m not paying you to talk about my relationships, past or present.  I’m paying you to talk to me about the trauma I suffered in my
The insistent pounding on his front door echoing in his skull, Dean squints at the late afternoon sun filtering in through his faded living room curtains as he makes his way across the worn carpet.  He’s spent so much time in Cas’ much larger and nicer apartment over the past few months, that his now seems even smaller and sadder in comparison.  Or maybe that’s just Dean.
“Well, what do we have here?” he asks. “A family reunion and no one invited me? Why am I not surprised?”
Dorothy always followed her own path.  When she graduated and that path no longer included Charlie, she’d walked away without a backward glance.  Once again, Jo had been there to pick up the pieces.  She’d reminded Charlie of who she was, of all the things she loved, and of how much she loved that she loved those things.  How could Charlie do anything but fall in love with her after that?  Telling her though, that was out of the question.
before he could walk again, but he still feels his heartrate picking up speed as they near the OR doors.  For a moment, he wishes Dean were here, the firefighter’s steady presence somehow simultaneously calming and electrifying.  At best, Castiel knows Dean’s touch would soothe his frazzled nerves.  At worst, well, it would at least make him nervous in a very different kind of way.
“Sorry,” he says quickly as the brothers clamber to their feet. “It’s just...” His eyes dart to Betty. “We thought a...demonstration might help.”
Though Castiel may not have a particularly...robust catalog of experience to draw from when it comes to kissing, he can’t help but think even if he did, kissing Dean would outshine them all. Dean manages to lead the kiss without making Castiel feel like he’s being pushed or rushed. He takes, but never more than Castiel has to give. And when it comes to giving...oh, does Dean
“Flatterer,” Ellen teases. “Good thing too. I happen to know your ‘kingdom’ is mostly smelly gym clothes and band posters. All right, Sam and I are heading out and I think it’s time for
“We’re not really your uncles, we’re from a parallel universe,” Dean echoes at him incredulously.  “Really?”
“Where’d your brother learn manners?” Eileen asks, standing on tiptoe to steal a kiss and laughing as she catches the two packs of napkins that slide off his pile of plates when he stoops down to oblige her. He’s pretty sure he’s never going to get tired of that...the laughing or the kisses, that is.
, but I promise more...action *eyebrow waggle* next week! And one of our couples makes some definite forward progress. My question for you is...who do you think it's going to be? Dean and Cas or D and CJ? Let me know in the comments! And maybe I'll do a Twitter poll on it later this week too...🤔
Ah, yes. Castiel winces internally at the memory of the body in front of him exploding in a red haze. He supposes their last meeting could be part of the reason Raphael is so reluctant to cooperate with him now. Of course, it’s not like Raphael’s never killed
“You don’t approve?” Cas had asked, quirking a small grin at his kitchen-mate. He’s grown both accustomed to and quite fond of Dean’s general disdain for the same “fancy baking talk” he claimed he took this class to learn.
“Pffffft!” Jo sputters and the three friends guffaw even louder than before, Ash holding his sides and rolling on Charlie’s bed, while she laughs so hard she actually falls out of her desk chair with a yelp.
Fun fact:  My ICU nurse's name actually was Jessica.  And I actually did try to hook her up with a friend who visited me in the ICU.  I was EVERY BIT as blunt and awkward as Cas is in this chapter.  And I'm not sorry about any of it.  XD
They place their baking sheets into the double oven, Cas’ tray going on top, while Dean slides his into the bottom and resolutely does
“Like I said, this will get you started, but if you’re going to be fostering long term, you’ll need more supplies. A litter box, toys, a scratching post—”
Fergus looks after him delightedly for a moment before turning back to Rowena, his face serious. “You’re dying.”
“Oh, come on,” Sam interrupts. “Don’t tell me that’s just some rando in there, Dean! I thought you were tired of hookups?”
Another heartbeat and the empty space is filled, Castiel’s dread increasing as he spots the humanoid bodies rearing elongated, supernatural heads full of deadly dagger-like teeth.
Speaking of, Dean makes a beeline for the Starbucks he spies on the next street corner. He hesitates before entering the coffeeshop, casting a rueful glance down at his black sweat pants and brown Oxfords, before shrugging. Fuck it. He looks like an idiot, sure, but he’d rather be a caffeinated idiot. As much as Dean thoroughly enjoyed he and Cas’ early morning exploits, he probably should have taken him up on that offer of coffee. Blowjobs or not, Dean’s just not properly awake until he’s had at least two cups.
Dean’s voice, the quiet endearment, and the extra point of contact at his forehead ground Castiel.  How Dean knew, he can’t imagine, but everything he’s done is exactly what Castiel needs in this moment.  His eyes tear up and he wishes for the words to express his gratitude to the firefighter currently curved over him protectively, his head bowed to rest against Castiel’s, exposing his neck to the shower of crumbling safety glass.  As it is, the words seem to get lost somewhere between his brain and his mouth, so he presses his forehead back against Dean’s, doing his best to reassure the firefighter that he’s heeded his words.  He’s still here.  He stayed.
“It’s messy,” Cas agrees. “Maybe it’s easy for some people. I hope so. Or at least I hope someday it will be. But I think for most of us there’s a lot of learning… and unlearning to be done. And that’s even without adding in the worrying about how the people around you will react.”
Pressing his blunt cockhead against Dean’s rim, Cas presses forward until he’s breeched the tight ring of muscle at Dean’s entrance, pulling a groan from himself and a quiet hiss from his boyfriend.  He pauses a moment to let Dean adjust, then, wrapping long fingers around Dean’s hips, slowly pushes onward, sinking into the tight heat of his firefighter’s body with a groan.
Leaning back down, he licks into Cas’ mouth before latching onto his husband’s collarbone and sucking a mark into his tanned skin.
Dean’s jaw drops open in shock.  He chances a glance at Cas sitting to his right and sees the same expression reflected back at him.
ever imagined,” he spits out condescendingly. “You commanded us to love. To love you, to love one another, to love humanity, but you had no idea what that even meant, because to you...to you, love is obedience. It’s...it’s servitude. It’s something to make you larger while diminishing the rest of us.”
Retrieving the paper with the animal rescue guy’s information from the hook by the door, Dean pulls his phone out of his pocket and thumbs open Twitter, doing a quick search for “@CJAngelRescue.” He fires off a DM to the dude, explaining his situation.
Charlie thought it was a great idea as well, and eagerly signed up to help host their first game night. Dean’s brother Sam had offered to stop by as well, being one of the home-for-the-summer college students Dean had referenced. Sam just finished up his classes at Omaha last week and he’s been a frequent visitor to “
“Did we break him?”  Charlie stage whispers to Gabriel, bringing Dean back to the present and startling a laugh out of him.
angel, Dean supposes—gripping his bicep as stumbles into Dean’s space. He’s not quite used to this new angelic strength, but it doesn’t seem like Cas is complaining, not with the way he’s looking at Dean right now.
Castiel shakes his head, the lump in his throat making it impossible to talk.  He didn’t.  He didn’t believe Lydia, not really, but Dean will never believe that now.
What was he thinking?  First, he inserted himself into Cas’ life without asking, showing up in the man’s goddamn hospital room like he was some sort of eyeglass-rescuing superhero.  Now, he’s inserting himself into the man’s recovery as well?
But the birthday party was cute, right?  After you're done yelling at me in the comments (which is entirely deserved, I know), I'd love to know what you thought of the party and Gabe's cake.  He's not the most subtle wingman, our Gabe.
“Yeah, well, if your ‘friend’ has come to finish what her old boss started, then I guess it was all for nothing.”
Dean doesn’t usually drink coffee this late in the day, especially in the summer since he refuses to order one of those frou-frou iced coffee drinks (even though he’ll undoubtedly steal a few sips from the one Cas is sure to order), but he’s not going to make Cas get coffee alone.  He’s working on it, but his boyfriend still has a habit of feeling guilty when he thinks people have gone out of their way for him.  Dean figures that’s the last thing he needs on his mind today.
“Where’s Rowena?” Jack asks, looking behind where Sam’s clomping down the last few steps behind his brother.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well there you go." Cas replied, placing his empty bowl in the sink. "There's the secret I spilled for the day."
Soon the struggle to stay awake ended as Cas's eyes drifted closed and Dean smiled to himself. Cas was stubborn, he'd give him that, but that was one of the reasons why he liked him so much.
"So I guess you'll be wanting the grand tour?" Dean said, dropping Cas's bags and turning on a light switch. "This," He said, waving his hand in a flourish. "Is the hallway, obviously." Cas couldn't help but grin and followed Dean. "And this," He opened the first door. "Is the bathroom." He continued down the hallway which opened up into a kitchen and living room. "Kitchen," Dean said, pointing one way. "Living room." He pointed the other way. He opened the last door. "Bedroom," He announced, giving Cas a suggestive wink and causing him to blush. "Hope we spend a lot of time in there."
"I'm sorry." Cas whispered. "I know what's going to happen-your going to get hurt, maybe even die, and I'm too selfish to do the right thing! I just want to lie here with you forever, I don't want to let you go-"
Cas smiled softly as Dean packed away his supplies and gave Cas his t shirt he'd been wearing underneath his flannel shirt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean slowly opened his eyes. "Cas...." He clenched the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turned white.
"Listen, can I ask you something?" Dean wiped his hands on a rag and went searching through his tool chest. "It's just...you always say your dad. What about your mom? Maybe you could live with her."
Cas smiled softly, trying to cover up his fear and sadness. "You know, I secretly liked it when you called me that."
Life seemed hopeless really, but still he found a way to make it through each day. Maybe it was hope. Hope to get out of his house, hope to get out of this town. Or maybe it was revenge. Pure, hatred driven revenge that he wanted his brother and father to experience the same pain they made him experience.
Ellen appeared and looked overjoyed to see Cas. "Cas!" She cried in relief. "Oh sweetie, I'm so glad your okay. Dean told me what happened."
Cas pushed the dwindling pile of books over to Dean as he sat down beside him again, carefully replacing the arm of his sleeve that had moved to expose his forearm. No one could ever find out, he just couldn't go through that pain again. "Damn, you were doing a lot of reading last night." Dean said, looking at the tiny pile of books. Cas shook his head no and Dean waited for him to go on. "You gonna elaborate or what?"
"Hey you." Cas smiled, his voice hoarse and low from lack of use. Dean smiled and took his hand, gently locking their fingers together. He wanted to lean down and hold him tightly, desperately needing to know he wasn't imagining this, but decided it was better not to. He was afraid to push too far. Cas searched his eyes and smiled. "My hero." Dean let out a little laugh and blushed. "Saving the damsel in distress,such a night in shining armor."
"So you don't make friends because you know your going to have to leave them? That's stupid. Live a little! Your supposed to enjoy everday and it sure doesn't sound like your happy."
"I know," Dean murmured softly. "I knew you did." Dean pulled up a chair and sat down, squeezing Cas's hand with all his desperation, fear and pain.
Cas kissed the hollow of Dean's neck. "Me either." He whispered, feeling it in his bones. If there was a way to keep Dean safe, he'd want to be with him forever.
Cas touched the cool metal in his palm before looking at Claire's sleeping form. He quietly strode over and sat on the edge of the bed.
"Dean..." Cas took a seat on the couch and seemed nervous, edgy. "I don't understand why I...my feelings...but I know I like this-being with you. I don't ever want to loose you. I....I have so many things I wish I could tell you, how happy you make me and how I absolutely love you...but I don't have any words."
"Would you believe I was trying to protect you? If you can't find them then there's less chance of them finding you."
" I can't." Cas said, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice. He shook his head slowly. "I just can't. I know you don't understand and I'm sorry but...I just can't."
"Sammy always get's to bring Jessica, his girlfriend, so I'm bringing you." Dean said with a small smile. "I'm always the awkward one out, the lone one, and it pretty much sucks."
Dean couldn't help but shake his head with  a small smile as Cas's messenger bag flapped around his legs. So desperate to be a goody two shoes. So desperate for approval.
It seemed only minutes later when the sun began moving over the sky, signalling it was late afternoon. "Damn." Dean muttered. "I come out here and never want to leave."
"Hey Cas." Dean sat beside him on the couch and Cas leaned into him. "So you didn't die or anything."
Cas knew there was a stupid grin on his face as he looked over at Dean. "Okay, well I don't want to use any of the other cliches either so I'll go with....Honestly, I don't have a good enough word." Cas said, laughing.
Cas blushed as Dean touched the tip of their noses together. "I never expected to fall in love again, let alone with....a guy-you."
It was scary, Dean wasn't going to deny it. The longer Cas was unconscious the less chance of him waking up. At least that was what the doctors said. But Cas was strong, Dean had to keep hoping he was strong enough.
Bobby shook his head with a smile and turned to Dean. "You tell your parents yet?" He asked quietly, his gaze going from Cas to Dean. It seemed he knew exactly what was going on.
"No sweetie, I'll be fine." Ellen leaned down and hugged Dean feircly. "You take care of yourself Dean, you hear me? When your ready, call me. I'll always be there for you."
Dean caught it with a grin and followed Cas outside where it was getting dark. "You look even prettier in the moonlight," Dean murmered as they turned down the road. "It kind of hides your face-"
"Hey," Cas replied, putting his messenger bag on his other shoulder and leaning into Dean. They walked down the empty hallway and into the parking lot. "You work today, don't you?"
Cas involuntarily flinched as they crossed the threshold and Dean moved his arm around Cas's waist. "Come on, we're going." He announced, turning back to the door.
Cas let out a soft mumble and Dean whipped around, relief filling his eyes when he saw Cas awake. "Hey," He whispered, taking a seat on the edge of Cas's bed. Cas smiled up at Dean shyly and Dean felt his heart soar. Suddenly, everything was okay.
"Yeah, canon, like actually acknowledged in the show. Fanfics are nice and everything but seriously, is just needs to be canon already. It's been six freaking years coming! Like seriously, with all that subtext they've got to make it happen. Or everyone will think Supernatural's been queer baiting this whole damn time! It's the greatest love story and it's never been told! Ugh, and everyone thinks all the destiel shippers just want to see two hot guys getting it on but it's not like that. I mean, that would be nice, but their relationship is just so much more! I just need some hand holding and cuddling. I just need Dean to admit that he'd in love with his best friend. They make his character so macho and make it seem that it totally wouldn't be okay if Dean was a little gay for Cas. It would be perfectly fine! They love each other so damn much, anyone can see. They are each others home. Hell, all the things they've been through together and how much they would sacrifice for each other, I just don't understand it when people try to say that they are just friends. It's the deepest kind of love, what they have. Even if they never do admit it aloud or make it canon, we'll always know. Dean and Cas totally and absolutely love each other and it's beautiful."
They were out of view of the school now and Cas took Dean's hand and skipped through the parking lot, a huge grin emerging on his face. He twirled around in the sprinkling of rain and laughed aloud as Dean caught up to him and shoved him in the car.
"Ultimately the decision is yours Dean. No one can tell you what choice to make, we can only advise you."
Finally, he left the hospital and found himself sitting in his car. The passenger seat was eerily empty. It was then Dean finally broke down. The shoulder shaking sobs emerged as rain began to pour down from the sky, only encouraging his grief.
"Ugh." Cas reached his arms above his head to stretch. Luckily, Dean was focused on the road and didn't notice the exposed bruise where his shirt had risen up. Cas quickly pulled his shirt down to cover it up. "Where are we?" He asked, squinting outside.
There were sirens in the distance and and Dean gave a shudder of breath. "Okay, it's okay. Your going to be okay." He reminded himself, feeling a little lightheaded. "Your going to be okay Cas."
From then on it was a blur. The paramedics arrived and everything then on was fuzzy. Hell, it was all just a blur and this, the waiting, the pain of not knowing. He wished this could seem less real. He remembered the horror and the way Cas's hand felt unnaturally still when he held it on the way to the hospital and the fear and the....
They drove around aimlessly for half an hour, Cas lying his head on Dean's shoulder. He finally decided to pull into the garage parking lot and shut off the engine. "I'd go to the falls, but you know," Dean said, motioning outside. "It's raining."
"You can. At least for now, please, just for a little while. I'll prove to you that nothing bad is going to happen to me."
Dean shed his leather jacket and removed a flask from the inside pocket. He took a seat on a large rock. Cas took a seat on the rock next to Dean and took off his sweater. The weather was getting warmer. To a certain extent, that made Cas happy, but it also made it harder to cover up. Walking around in a sweater in 30 degree Celsius weather looked a bit odd. He made sure his arms were covered and threw his sweater to the ground. "How'd you find this place?" Cas asked.
"Nah...it wouldn't be as fun." Dean grinned wickedly and Cas swallowed and stuck out his tongue at him.
"Just...meet me by the front doors after school and we can talk about it." Cas said, sprinting out of the room so he wasn't late for his next class.
The bell rang and Cas shook his head. "Hey, good luck on your test." Dean said, plopping the calculator down and taking off with a grin.
They made it across the yard and Cas slid into his seat with a huge grin. "Oh God, I can't believe I just did that." Dean grinned over at him and pulled out of the parking lot with a squeal of tires. Cas let out a whoop, he felt so....bad ass. It was nice. "Yes!" Cas shouted over the music, sticking his hand out the window and feeling the wind rushing by. He'd never felt so carefree. "Why didn't I ever do this before?"
Cas adjusted the collar of his shirt so none of the new bruises were invisible and nearly jumped when Dean leaned against his locker. "Jesus!" He cried. "You scared me!"
Cas kissed her on the forehead and tucked the blankets up around her. "Now, you have to get some sleep."
"No, no, I didn't mean it like that Cas. I just...it's nice to have an optimistic outlook for once. It seems that my relationships never last very long..."
"Lucky." Dean grumbled and grabbed his jacket. Cas picked up his sweater and followed Dean over to the car. "You can come hang out at the shop if you want." Dean offered.
Cas laughed as Dean got in his side and pulled away. "Gosh, that sounds so horrible," He teased. "But seriously, thanks for the story back there."
Dean traced along Cas's jawbone with his thumb and smiled. "I guess we better get some food, huh?" Cas blushed as Dean threw him his clothes and dressed hurriedly. "You okay?" Dean asked, taking Cas's chin in his hand and looking Cas in the eyes.
"Why would you care? Why are you trying so hard? Heck, why are you even sitting here talking to me?"
"Dean...." Ellen's voice softened and she looked at him with concern. "Let's go." She said, grabbing her jacket. "Get Jo to cover for me would ya Ash? I'm heading out." She helped Dean outside and grabbed a burger. "Hospital food sucks, the poor thing must be starving."
The wrench Dean had been holding fell to the floor with a clang. He bent to pick it up, his heart pounding. "Jeez man, I'm sorry."
This was the end. Everything had been holding on and now the holding on was over. It was time for letting go.
"Who cares? You'll be away from him, and legally you'll be an adult. There's nothing he could do." Cas resisted the urge to laugh because that statement was the farthest thing from the truth. "The falls?" Dean asked and when Cas shook his head yes signaled left. "You know if you tell anybody about this place, I'll kill you, right?"
Cas thought he spotted a wave of curly black hair in a window and felt his stomach clench in grief. Meg. It took all of his control to not sink into the sidewalk and wail in pain. This is why he couldn't get close to anybody, they got hurt.
Dean sighed as he grabbed Cas's hand while they lie in the grass. He looked over at Cas and shook his head with a heartfelt smile. "How can people not love you?"
"So is this like your tree or something?" Dean asked as he found Cas sitting under the same tree as a few days before.
Cas yawned and leaned his head against Dean's shoulder."You seriously need to get more sleep." Dean said, concern creeping into his voice. "It's not healthy Cas."
The hours ticked by and Cas couldn't help but notice that Dean was strangely quiet. It was beginning to worry him. "Hey, are you alright?" Cas asked quietly.
Cas smiled as they entered the building and went around to the back where Sammy's mustang sat. "Go ahead." Cas said, taking a seat. "I'll just enjoy the view." He raised an eyebrow suggestively and Dean pulled him close for a quick kiss. "Get to work." Cas said, swatting him away with a small smile.
This time Dean reached for him too late and Cas slipped out of his grasp. "Cas." Cas turned around and gave him a soft smile. "Hey, are you going to be okay?"
They bumped to a stop and Cas was the first one out of the car. Running, flying it seemed, across the sand and pebbles, his trench coat billowing out behind him like a superhero cape. Dean shook his head with a smile smile before closing the door and following.
Cas heard the slight purr of a car engine and stood up, watching as Dean pulled to the curb. Cas hesitantly opened the passenger door and Dean surveyed him worriedly.
They left the mall and after picking up a bag and some wrapping paper started the drive back to the motel. Cas was strangely quiet and Dean was becoming even more concerned. "Cas...you seem kinda quiet."
"Don't you dare- you have no right to just barge in here!" The oldest cried, lunging for Dean, who ducked out of the way.
Cas got up and logged onto one of the computers. Dean followed. Cas was surprised to find Dean standing over him. "We did a pretty good job." Dean announced, clapping Cas on the back encourginly.
Dean place his hands around the exposed part of Cas's stomach and pulled him closer to him. Dean's cell phone rang, loud and clear and Dean shoved his head under his pillow. "Shut up, I'm not going into work today." He mumbled, willing the ringing to stop.
Dean's heart hammered and his brain ceased to function because of what Cas had said. Not she thought you loved me. She thought you loved me back.  That one word meant so damn much. He closed his eyes for the briefest of seconds and leaned his forehead against the steering wheel.
"They were your family, I understand Cas." Dean said gently. "In some sick, twisted way, they are still your family, your blood. Of course your going to care about them,even if they don't deserve it."
"Dean, it's the slimmest of chances, basically nothing. Even if he did miraculously pull through, I doubt he would be the same. There would most likely be permanent damage to the brain. He wouldn't be able to live a normal life, he-"
Dean smiled and tenderly pulled him close. "Me too," He whispered, kissing Cas on the temple. "I can't even remember what I did without you, and babe, I promise you'll never loose me. And as for having no words....well I'm with you there, because that isn't just my thing but every chance I get I'll show you how much you mean to me babe. And I know I'm probably a really crappy boyfriend Cas, but....I'm going to try to never let you down or never let you feel alone. And I swear as long as you love me, I will never ever leave you babe. Okay?"
"Okay, the whole no talking thing is really creepy." Cas remained staring out the window. "Jesus, what kind of drugs are you on, I want some."
Dean opened Cas's door for him and leaned and kissed him. "Well I sure as hell would rather spend that time with you."
"Ah, sure." Cas replied, but he was nervous. They weren't out together in public frequently and Cas wasn't sure of what anyone would say.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter!  What did you think of hedge witch Rowena?  And how about that spell?  Any thoughts on what Dean's reaction is going to be?
Castiel’s life in the hospital has settled quickly into a routine that is mind-numbing for someone accustomed to the chaotic activity of an eight-month-old and the hormone-fueled drama of adolescents on a daily basis.  Every morning, starting at 5 AM, Castiel is visited by a parade of medical interns and fellows from the orthopedic, urology, and trauma departments.  Each set of doctors asks Castiel to roll on his side (which he can actually do now, he’s pleased to say) so they can check his dressings, examine his healing incisions, and look for signs of infection while baring Castiel’s naked backside to the room.  A tepid and thoroughly unappetizing breakfast follows, along with meds, vitals, and the nurses’ shift change at seven.  About an hour later brings a tech, who bathes Castiel and changes his sheets, unhooking the fitted sheet from the top and bottom of one side of the mattress and rolling it toward the center until it’s bunched underneath Castiel, who then rolls over the lump so the sheet can be pulled free on the other side and the process then reversed with clean linens.  More meds come with an equally disappointing lunch (he was at least upgraded to a solid diet yesterday, after
“No,” Dean answers quickly. “No, I’m definitely single. Believe me, I wouldn’t have let us get anywhere near that close if I weren’t. It’s uh, more of an unrequited thing, but he…I’m…” Dean trails off, gesturing vaguely with the hand that’s not still clutching the back of his neck like a lifeline.
Charlie snickers and Cas bites his lip and seems to be fighting back his own laugh, despite turning bright red.
says it has to be this way,” his brother retorts, opening the Impala’s trunk and pulling out the two cans of spray paint they’d stowed there before leaving the bunker. “I’m still not sure I trust her.”
After a moment’s consideration, he walks back to the living room, grabbing the towel and the still-warm rice sock from the box with his free hand. Returning to the kitchen, he places both on the counter top, scrunching the bunched-up towel into a sort of nest around the make-shift heating pad.
.”  Dean knows he must look as pathetic and helpless as he feels, but for once he doesn’t care.  He’d get on his knees and
“For those at home, that lovely residence in the background is the Palo Alto mansion of famous, gorgeous, and available software developer, Castiel Novak. And,” Crowley pauses dramatically as the photo on the screen behind him changes, “This is the esteemed Mr. Novak wearing what appears to be the
“Yes,” he agrees, eyes steady on the wretched once-God clutched in his fist. “We have. But not as many as him. He has to be stopped.”
label on the mug he’d found abandoned in the cabinet his first morning in this apartment. It, along with nearly everything else in this place, Dean included, had been cast away, forgotten, replaced. But Cas, Cas has chosen to drink his coffee out of this old, battered mug every morning since he started staying with Dean.
“Stay with me, Cas.” The press of fingertips against his cheek pulls Castiel back from the edge of that abyss...cool and soothing against his overheated nerves. He clings to this new anchor as he feels the now-familiar sensation of Dean’s grace moving through him...not raging this time, but gentle, almost hesitant as it checks him over, searching for wounds both visible and unseen. A moment later Castiel feels those wounds close and mend with the healing touch of grace.
Dean turns on his back and stares up at the ceiling for a minute, before suddenly turning on his side to face Castiel, propping himself up on one elbow.
“Alright, guess I’m off to my first day in the world of ‘automotive restoration,’” Dean announces, quoting the website where they’d found Dean’s picture the day before and trying not to sound as excited as he actually feels.
“Interfere in Cas’ deal with The Empty?” Dean plays along. “That wasn’t necessary to your plan. Chuck is gone. You won. You could have just let The Shadow take him back.”
She chuckles at that, lowering Castiel’s legs to the floor as he pushes himself upright with much more ease than he had just a couple of days ago.
At least his jeans are clean and his t-shirt doesn’t have any holes in it (he doesn’t think so anyway).  He glares at himself in the mirror one more time (as if it’s his reflection’s fault Dean’s a dumbass), before raking his fingers through his short brown hair and stepping outside.
A shy smile spreads across Cas’ face and Dean relaxes. “It sounds like Sam thinks you were pretty serious about this CJ guy,” he says quietly.
“Getting better, but slowly,” Cas answers, sounding more relaxed than before, but still more strained than his usual gravelly baritone.  “I could use a distraction,” he adds.  “Talk to me.”
guys wouldn’t want to hang out with you and Claire, but those guys are assholes who aren’t worth your time anyways.  Look, I know I got a little flustered with the whole pterodactyl thing, but I didn’t mean to make you feel like I’d rather be somewhere else.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean agrees with a smile that feels more like a grimace as he tries to ignore the wrong, sour feeling in his stomach at the thought of being Claire’s ‘cool uncle.’
“Okay,” Castiel agrees easily. And it does feel easy, here in Dean’s arms. He’s sure it won’t always be, but as long as they can find their way back to this, he has faith that everything else will work itself out.
Castiel smiles down at his smartphone, his finger tracing gently over the photo message Dean just sent him.  It’s a picture of a smiling Dean holding Claire, her face smeared liberally with chocolate ice cream, both hands clutching a dripping ice cream cone as she beams at the camera.  His chest fills with warmth as he looks at this captured moment of bliss:  Dean’s face filled with amusement and contentment and Claire’s the absolute embodiment of child-like joy.  He sets it as his home screen before texting Dean back.
Castiel nods slowly, the twinge of disappointment he feels easily overshadowed by the immensity of his relief. “More than you know.”
is what Crowley’s been after all along. He’s known, or at least suspected, that Dean isn’t straight for years and now, finally, he’s pretty much secured the first ever coming out announcement of an active NHL player on
Meeting Dean’s eyes and moving slowly, giving him plenty of time to back out, Cas leans forward, closing the distance and hovering over Dean as he presses their lips together, his blue button-up falling open around him and grazing Dean’s bare chest. This time, when Cas reaches for Dean’s zipper, Dean leans back to give him more room.
“You shut up, too,” Mr. Winchester says sternly, pointing an accusing finger at the suddenly innocent-looking penis-substitute.
After ordering their meals, the two of them chat about their days, their jobs, the traffic on the way to the restaurant; ordinary, first date small talk that flows easily enough between the two of them.  Lisa is friendly and bubbly without being over-bearing or falsely sweet.  She laughs easily, but genuinely, and the conversation carries them until their food arrives: a burger and onion rings for Dean and a steak salad for Lisa.
For a long moment, no one speaks, all eyes focused at the end of the long row of tables. Smiling, Jack stands there, hands at his sides and seeming completely unperturbed by the lack of greeting.
.  He can remember those first few weeks after the fire, when he couldn’t even take a goddamn piss without someone checking up on him.  He was constantly surrounded by people and yet he’d never felt more alone, because try though they might, none of them understood.  How could they?  How could any of them have any fucking clue what he was going through?  They didn’t.  They couldn’t, so they tried to “be there” for him instead.  Every damn person he knew was in his face constantly, “being there” until he felt like he couldn’t breathe.
Dean moans loudly and feels Cas’ smirk against his neck, “Careful, Pet.  Get too loud and someone might come investigate the noise.”  He grasps the base of the silicone plug through the satin and begins twisting it between his fingers as he continues to stroke Dean through the front of the soon-to-be-soiled panties.  Dean whimpers and pants as he strains to stay still, to be good for his Dom, his fingernails digging into burgundy paint.
, time and again: mentally, emotionally, and now physically.  And Dean wants that for him, he does, but he also wants Cas to know that, for the first time in his life, he doesn’t have to do it
Jack smiles. “No, of course not. Betty,” he gestures at the fair skinned woman with the loose brown curls, “will transport us all back to Earth. Once we’re no longer in The Empty, I’ll be able to recreate your vessels.”
“He’ll have it, if that’s what he wants,” Jack assures her and Rowena relaxes, relief settling over her. “I’m going to clear out The Empty. All the angels and demons who have suffered there will have a choice, return to Heaven or Hell and remain there or start a new life...as a human.”
“Hey,” Dean argues on a laugh, “Not my fault your ass is too lazy to walk down to the laundry room.”
“I threw it away,” he lies. Really, he should have thrown it away. He’s still not sure what possessed him to tuck it safely away in the pocket of his messenger bag instead. At least he didn’t do something truly reckless, like program it into his phone.
“At least hold onto me while we’re walking to the building,” Dean pleads.  “It could be slick and the
“Oooh, thanks. This is my third one this week,” she confesses with a grimace. “I really shouldn’t have ordered another, but they’re freaking amazing.”
“Get it together, King Candy,” Charlie orders from her spot on the floor, legs criss-crossed beneath her like a small child at storytime, a sharp contrast to the battle-hardened expression on her pale face.
Looking over at Cas, Dean narrows his eyes at his husband’s cocky smirk.  Smug, self-righteous bastard.
Dean spends the entire next week worrying about Cas’ “surprise” anniversary date.  He’s never been a big fan of surprises.  After all, he reasons, surprises for the Winchesters have almost never been a good thing.  By the time Saturday evening rolls around the following week, he’s a nervous wreck.
The rest of the evening passes amiably.  Castiel still flinches and closes his eyes at times on the drive from The Snack Shack to his apartment, but during the worst of it he keeps his eyes focused inside the Impala and uses the color-naming strategy Dean taught him to center himself and they make it home with no further incidents.
in his entire goddamn life. “You don’t need me, Dean. You’ll be okay. You have Sam and Eileen. You have Jack. And Donna and Jody and the girls. You can have that life with them.”
With a sigh and a brief thought that this is not at all how he saw his night (or any night ever) going, Dean rests the kitten against his shoulder as CJ instructed. After only about a minute of firm petting, he hears a small, high-pitched bubble-noise that he assumes must be a kitten-burp.
CW for head injury, hospital scenes, and brief descriptions of violence/physical assault. Nothing graphic or life threatening.
“I’m the only one it can be,” Cas says reasonably. “If you or Sam go, he’ll see right away that you have archangel grace and realize we’re trying to trap him. The same is true of Michael, Gabriel, or Raphael, of course.”
White icing paw prints cover Dean’s countertop, matching paw-shaped depressions in several of his freshly iced cupcakes. Dean’s stringless Omaha hoody hanging askew from one of the stools on the other side of the peninsula countertop tells the story of how the kitten climbed her way to confectionary conquest.
interested in Castiel romantically?  The last thing he wants to do is hurt the handsome firefighter.  The handsome, thoughtful firefighter who worked a twelve-hour shift saving people and fighting fires, then drove to Castiel’s favorite coffee shop to buy him coffee, and is now sitting across from him looking a little shocked and embarrassed at his own admission.
Castiel shrugs awkwardly from his position on the floor. “Maybe I was just flirting with the wrong people before. You make it...fun. I didn’t know it could be like that.”
Cas is silent for a long moment.  When he finally speaks, Dean starts in surprise at his question, “Dean, would you still be willing to pick me up from the hospital and take me home Saturday?”
from the bunker storerooms. She wouldn’t let Sam get close enough to see what she was gathering, knowing he’d be trying to figure out what kind of spellwork she’d be doing. She’d looked almost proud as she’d shooed him away with a strict instruction to “stop hovering.”
Rowena glares daggers at Dean, eyes matching her hair in their intensity. “You’re not the only one who’s lost someone to The Empty.” She lifts her head defiantly. “It has something that belongs to me.”
Betty doesn’t answer him, but she does let her eyes drift back to the far side of the diner as she takes a sip of her milkshake.
“Hey, of course I’m not uncomfortable,” Dean lies. He’s all kinds of uncomfortable with this, just not for any of the reasons Cas thinks. “I still say I don’t need a babysitter,” he glares at Sam and Ellen, “but I ain’t gonna say no to spendin’ more time with you.” And isn’t
What had he told Dean?  That he didn’t have time for a relationship?   Dean had fit into their life, their routine, so seamlessly.  He’s sure it would have taken some adjusting once he went back to work, but Castiel knows in his heart, has known for a long time now, that Dean would have fit into that life as well. He wouldn’t have placed any extra demands on Castiel’s time or energy, but would have devoted his own time and energy to lessening Castiel’s burdens.
He places a hand on the small of Lisa’s back as he walks her to her car, smiling as she subtly moves closer.  It feels nice to be with someone like this, to be
“Look, it was terrible, I know,” Bart says in a voice that would sound contrite if Castiel didn’t know his ex to be incapable of such a genuine feeling.  “I shouldn’t have just left like that, but I’m sorry my love, I truly am.  I miss you.”
?” Dean rockets to his feed.  “Is that what you think I’m doing?  You think this, you, Claire is all some kind of game to me?  Something I’m just gonna get bored with a few months, hell, a few years from now?”
The wind may be blowing again, the sun restarted on its slow trek across the sky...but Castiel knows there are no bees buzzing in the tall grasses...no birds silhouetted in the bright sunlight above. Still though, his eyes don’t leave his father’s.
Castiel asks curiously, “You were worried?”  He’s not used to having anyone other than Gabriel or Charlie worry about him.  It’s... nice.
Feeling his eyebrows lift in appreciation of the display before him, Cas openly ogles his naked boyfriend, eyes roving from Dean’s hair, mussed from pulling off his shirt, down his smooth chest, chiseled abs, and thick thighs.  Even his boyfriend’s
That earns another full body laugh and Castiel learns those are even better when Dean’s wrapped around him during. He resolves to make it happen again and again.
to play out.” If she were as prone to human affectations as the two creatures before her, Billie would roll her eyes at this juncture. Instead, she settles for raising a dignified eyebrow. “That’s why I arranged for a replacement. One even Chuck fears.”
Cas stares straight ahead and Dean follows his eyes, watching two rain droplets race one another down the slippery windshield, winding this way and that as they careen down the glass.
“Of course, I don’t mind Dean visiting,” he mumbles, just barely managing to keep the blush from his cheeks.  Dean lights up at that and shoots a cheeky grin at Jody.
“Nah,” Dean answers, his attention focused on their double oven as he sets each one to the correct temperature. Now they have about twenty minutes to kill as they wait for their ovens to preheat and their crusts to chill, before they need to roll out the top halves of their pie crusts.
Castiel had kept each answer as short and perfunctory as he could make them, and yet it felt like Missouri had read novels in each begrudging sentence.  The most difficult question to answer though, had come after Castiel was already feeling raw and drained from revealing far more in one sitting about his less than ideal childhood than he ever had before.
, but Dean refuses, reminding Cas that he’s finished his last overnight of the week and now has three days off to get his sleep schedule turned around for his upcoming stretch of day shifts.  The longer he can stay up today, the easier the transition will be.
Cas’ only answer to that is another kiss...one Dean accepts in full before finally dropping his arms and stepping away.
Is Billie a good guy or a bad guy? What do you think? Also, I didn't want to be too spoilery at the beginning, but this chapter is dedicated to our very badass ladies of SPN. 💖
He’s been careful to have the nurses help him change positions slightly every few hours, tilting his body to the side slightly and then asking the nurses to prop him up with pillows, in order to avoid bed sores or cramped muscles (because apparently no one else thinks to do that unless the patient is unconscious), but this is the first time since the accident that he’s been able to remove all of the pressure from his back and legs.
Speaking of which, what little human pains would you most like to see Chuck suffer through during his small, unremarkable human existence? Charlie horses? Erectile dysfunction? Weekly papercuts between his fingers?
Castiel tosses his keys onto the stand Gabe keeps next to the door just for this purpose, not that he ever remembers to use it himself. The number of times Castiel has watched his brother search the entire apartment for his keys, only to find them somewhere completely unexpected (the freezer, under the sofa, in the shower, and
“Speaking of which,” Cas segues, and Dean looks up from the bell pepper he’s slicing, “I have my first follow-up appointment with my orthopedic surgeon next Tuesday.  I’ll get an update on my prognosis and find out how much longer I’ll be off work.”
Cas is still staring at him, looking desperately for his friend; the friend Dean promised himself he’d be.
Tiny arms tighten around Dean’s neck as he crosses the threshold and he spends a few extra moments just standing next to Claire’s “big girl” bed, rocking her back and forth.
“Kiss me,” he orders and Dean dives for him, releasing his legs as he brings his arms up to frame Cas’ head again, capturing his lips in a kiss that says everything it feels too soon to breathe out loud.
Lisa had invited him to join her and Ben for Christmas dinner, but he’d declined, explaining that he had a family dinner to go to.  He wonders if he should feel guilty about that, but he can’t.  He and Lisa have only been dating a month and that feels far too soon to be having an intimate, family Christmas dinner together.  As much as Lisa assures him that they’re keeping things casual and that she’s not ready for anything more serious than he is, it’s beginning to feel like her actions are saying something different.  Dean likes Lisa, he really does, and Ben’s just awesome, but it wouldn’t be fair to any of them to let this thing move too fast.  After all, Dean’s still recovering from the last time he let himself get in too deep.  The last thing he needs is to jump into something new without looking before he leaps.  He just hopes Lisa really is on the same page.
“Jack here got one hell of a grace boost when he hoovered up all that primordial energy,” Betty explains, pulling out the chair that Rowena’s been ignoring in favor of the tabletop and perching on an arm and seriously, do neither of them know how to use a damn chair? “But that wasn’t the only thing that got powered up. While his grace was sucking up creation juice, his
?  When?  And for how long?  Why did he stop?  Was it because he finally gave up hope that rescue was coming.. or was it because he, like Dean, kind of stopped wanting to be rescued?
mug that he’s about 95% certain Dean didn’t pay for. It’s even odds on whether it came with the apartment or was stolen by Dean after a night of drinking and a plateful of Eggs Over My Hammy. As much as he loves this mug, the chip on the rim makes drinking from it a bit of an adventure. He thinks about his “Give me a <br>” coffee mug, collecting dust in his and Gabe’s kitchen. Maybe he’ll stop by the apartment on his way back from class today and grab it. Perhaps it’s a bit presumptuous to assume that Dean will want him to keep staying here now that their agreed upon two weeks are over and Dean’s returned to his normal activities, but after last night, Cas thinks it’s worth taking a risk.

He’d swallowed and wiped away one of the tears that never seemed to be far off if he thought about Eileen for too long. “Yeah,” he’d said, looking back at the tiny redhead, “Crowley, too.” He wasn’t sure if they were promises or just lies the people you love tell you when you need to hear them most, but he meant it just the same.
Pressing his contacts button, it’s only seconds before Dean has the phone to his ear, Meg’s number dialing.
Dean grimaces. The doctors had warned him about the concussion symptoms he’s going to continue to experience for at least the next couple weeks and even the possibility of something called “post-concussion syndrome” that could take Dean’s recovery from weeks to months. But none of it matters, because…
Sam breathes deep, letting out all the air in a rush, the sound much louder in this silent, timeless world. It might be Lucifer’s grace that he’s accepting, but it’s not Lucifer he’s saying yes to. Lucifer is gone, but Jack and Cas and Dean...they’re all right here. And they’re the ones he’s saying yes to. They’re the ones he’s choosing...his family.
, he knows that Ten is CJ’s Doctor, though Dean has always favored Eleven. The way Matt Smith can go from goofy, lovable dork to stone cold means-justifying badass is beyond impressive. They’d actually had that conversation the night before the soufflé class. He bets CJ would have found his Soufflé Girl joke hilarious, but for some reason, Dean has been hesitant to tell him about his baking class.
Jack’s eyes meet hers momentarily, the strain from whatever way-beyond-Donna’s-pay-grade mental battle he’s having with the guy Dean’s previous description tells her is Chuck clear on his face.
Jack looks around at his assembled family, wondering if this will be the last time he sees their faces. His eyes travel over them: Cas and Dean, Sam and Eileen, Amara… Amara. His gaze lingers on his newly human aunt, who holds his eyes before offering a single nod.
“Very okay,” Castiel agrees playfully, “though I’m fairly certain this violates the rules of ‘personal space,’ as they’ve previously been explained to me.”
“Peace on Earth and goodwill to all, bitches,” she chirps, flashing them a peace sign before slipping out of the apartment and closing the door behind her without waiting for Dean.
“Thanks,” he says softly, nodding to Cas, who takes a sip of his coffee, before returning Dean’s nod.
Cas reaches forward with a wobbly smile, tangling their fingers together as he brings Dean’s hand down to his knee.
“Goodbye, Bug,” he coos into Claire’s curls, kissing the side of her head, “Be a good girl for Dean and for Miss Anna.”
He starts in surprise at the sudden kiss, before sinking into the feeling of Cas’ dry lips against his own, one of his hands cradling the back of Dean’s head while the other cups his cheek.  Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ waist, pulling the man to him until their chests press together.  Cas trails the hand on Dean’s cheek down to his shoulder, fisting it in Dean’s shirt sleeve like he’s afraid Dean might disappear.
He doesn’t get the chance to finish the question before Cas’ dry lips are pressing against his own.  The kiss is a little uncoordinated at first.  Noses bump and Cas starts to pull away in embarrassment before Dean reels him back in with a hand at the small of his back.  It’s the tiny imperfections that reassure Dean the most.  This is
that has to take precedence over the inconsequential feelings of one lonely hunter and his angel side-kick.  And when there’s
“You first,” he rasps, partially because he wants to see Dean naked and partially from a desire to see the other man follow another of his orders. Dean doesn’t disappoint, though instead of climbing off the bed to remove his pants, he stands up on his knees, meaty thighs straddling one of Cas’ own as he slowly lowers his sweats and boxers in tandem, his already mostly erect cock bobbing free of its confines and hovering, flushed red and gorgeous, just inches above Cas’ own.
So, Dean smiles, not big and flirty and charming, like he usually does, but soft and sweet, before giving Cas’ knee a squeeze and stepping out into the downpour. They definitely have more to talk about, but it finally feels like they’re on the same page for the first time. Everything else can wait until tomorrow.
Tearing his eyes away from Cas’ ass before the man can turn back his way, Dean stutters out an excuse about needing to get started in the kitchen and beats a hasty retreat down the hallway, not breathing properly until the kitchen doors swing shut behind him.
“Must have a thing for the name,” Sam joked with a grin. “Seriously though, Dean used to have a lot of…” Sam eyed Ellen, choosing his words carefully even as she rolled her eyes, “
Cas doesn’t waste any time once they reach Dean’s bedroom, pulling Dean into a long, slow kiss as they both fumble with buttons and zippers. Cas’ fingers drag over Dean’s pecs and down his sides, finally coming to rest on the waistband of his jeans as he pushes Cas’ open shirt off those broad shoulders, covering the newly exposed skin in wet, sucking kisses instead.
“I think you know what you need to do next, Dean,” Sam shot him an unimpressed look, “and you need to do it soon.  We’re supposed to be having Thanksgiving dinner with the Miltons in four days and you and Cas need to get your shit sorted out before then.”
Cas hesitates before answering slowly, as if he’s carefully feeling out each word, “I’ll admit, knowing where your interest lies does take a little of the pressure off…in a way.” Looking up nervously, he adds, “But I guess I’m hoping that who I really am might be enough.”
He looks back at Dean, only to find Dean’s eyes already on him.  His green eyes glow in the dim light coming from the twinkle lights behind them and Castiel’s breath catches in his throat.
“Dean, you didn’t,” Castiel chides, “I told you it isn’t necessary.  I’m sure Bobby and Ellen don’t want a bunch of strangers intruding on their family holiday, especially since they didn’t get to spend Thanksgiving with you and Sam.”
“Oh, Dean.  You know Lydia?  She’s my occupational therapist.  I guess I never told you her name,” Castiel winces and looks apologetically at Lydia, “Dean is my... friend.”  He suppresses a cringe at both his hesitation and the word, “friend,” and thinks he notices a slight wince from Dean too.
“I know you don’t have access to your money right now or whatever,” Dean continues, “but I guarantee you there’ve been times when you’ve spent more money on a single meal than I do on groceries for the entire week. And I ain’t faultin’ you for that. Hell knows if I could, I would.” Grabbing an unlabeled container from the counter, he shakes it liberally over the burgers. “Garlic powder, salt, and pepper,” he explains at Castiel’s quizzical look. “My not-so-secret secret seasoning.”
Dean savors those memories now, reminding himself of the feel and taste of Castiel’s body, because the knowledge of that reward is the
Also, the fact that Dean's Christmas party aligned with my own was just a very happy coincidence, but in the interest of keeping that holiday spirit alive, I'm going to be giving all of you dear readers a Christmas present!  Now, don't get too excited, I'm going to tell you up front that it is NOT Dean and Cas getting together.  (Didn't want to get anyone's hopes up.  That would be like asking Santa for a new car and getting a Matchbox one instead. 😂)
Reaching up to stow the mixing bowl away in the cabinet next to the sink, he spies a rubber spatula that somehow missed his kitchen once-over. Dean turns, picking up the icing-covered kitchen utensil, only to find himself staring at an equally icing-covered kitten.
and therefore something he can really lose.. or it will prove that it’s not.  He’s not sure which option terrifies him more.
Dean chuckles nervously and asks, “Do you want me to scope the place out for any cute boy-nurses or orderlies?  I might have some pull over at the nurses’ station.  I think they’re really starting to warm up to me.”
Novak smirks again, eyes dropping momentarily to Winchester’s lap, and there’s no way Charlie’s mistaking that heat in his eyes.
A moment later, a blonde head appears around the library’s entrance, quickly followed by the rest of her as a slightly smaller figure bumps into her from behind.
Castiel rolls his eyes as Gabriel turns, bowing to Jessica and then nodding to Dean, “Unavailable-Pretty-Nurse.  Totally-Random-Guy-I-Don’t-Know-But-Who-Cassie-Is-Going-To-Tell-Me-
Cas however, holds his position and looks up at Dean with a wicked glint in his eye.  Instead of releasing Dean, he tightens his hold on Dean’s hips and presses his forearms against Dean’s thighs, pinning him against the washing machine as he redoubles his efforts to suck Dean’s goddamn brain out through his dick.
He’s well on his way to a nap when he catches a warm, whiskey-rich voice that he’d never thought to hear again, coming from right outside his hospital room door.
Dean waits his turn as Cas hugs Jack goodbye, before pulling the kid in for his own hug. “I’m coming back,” Jack reminds him.
When Cas looks at him quizzically he adds, “Baking. He was a mechanic, owned his own garage and practically raised me in it. He wanted me to take it over some day and more than anything, I didn’t wanna disappoint him.”
Recovering first, Cas continues Dean’s train of thought, “But why now?  How did you find out we were here?”
“You know, I think Claire-Bear here needs a diaper change, so I’m just gonna…” Gabriel, the traitor, trails off as he snatches the baby Castiel was hoping to hide behind like an adorable human shield and books a hasty retreat into the house, only to be replaced in the doorway a moment later by Bobby.
Castiel smiles in spite of himself.  To the casual observer, tough firefighter Dean Winchester would seem like the last person to sit at his dining room table dutifully addressing Christmas card envelopes, but Castiel can picture it perfectly in his mind’s eye—Dean, wearing his flannel pajama pants and one of his faded band t-shirts, bobbing his head to Mariah Carey’s
At a reassuring nod from Rowena, Cas crosses the field at a run until he reaches Jack’s side again, kneeling next to him helplessly as he exchanges terrified looks with Sam and Dean.
All thoughts of toiletries and towels disappear as Cas parts Dean’s lips with a tentative tongue.  Dean opens willingly, the taste of Cas’ coffee mingling with the flavor of his minty toothpaste.  Okay, so it’s not the most pleasant flavor combination, but Dean doesn’t care, because this is

“The Supernatural series is huge. It’s epic,” Becky answered uncertainly. “How do you know I could do it justice?” She wasn’t sure why this strange young man’s opinion mattered to her at all, and yet…
Rinsing his hands in the sink and drying them slowly on the towel looped over the oven door to buy himself some time, Dean licks his lips. “Uh. About CJ—”
It’s not long before they’re cuddled together under the covers, pajama pants back in place in case one of them needs to get to Claire quickly in the middle of the night. It’s been one hell of a year, but even given everything that’s happened this year, there’s still nowhere Dean would rather be than exactly where he is now and he can’t help but see a bright and hopeful glow on the horizon.
“So, she’s really going to die?” the slim Black psychic asks, huddling closer to her friends and folding her arms tightly across her chest as if she can feel the encroaching chill of...well, Betty.
Castiel’s second full day in the ICU passes much like his first, but without the pleasant distractions of Gabriel’s antics or Dean’s bow legs.  He’s visited by doctors from Trauma, Orthopedics, and Urology again, although none of them have anything new to report.  He gets one more MRI (to get a look at things now that the initial swelling has gone down) and is told that he might get to enjoy a liquid dinner this evening before he’s cut off from food again after midnight, in preparation for surgery.  On the bright side, Castiel is pleased to see that his nurse for the day is Jessica again.
Feeling suddenly out of place as Dean plays with Claire on the floor, something Castiel is still unable to do, he tries to push down the melancholy feeling.
“Oh no!  Not in my apartment!” Jess says loudly, pointing at Dean with the fork she’s been using to feed Claire small bite of burger and tomato on her lap, “Cas can watch you drool over Harrison Ford at his place.”
Be sure to check the end notes for warnings and oh, in case the chapter summary wasn't clear and if you're maybe, sort of interested in that kind of thing, this chapter is NSFW.
Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, Cas recalls he and Charlie’s whispered conversation as they hugged goodbye in Dean’s hospital room Sunday.
“Jesus, Billie,” Dean breathes, shaking his head. “Dramatic much?” He looks back at Castiel. “Whether or not it was technically necessary, Cas, it wasn’t meaningless.” Holding Castiel’s eyes, he gives a single, decisive shake of his head. “Not to me.”
Cas rolls his eyes and gives him a flat look, “The Gas-n-Sip.”  He pauses, then adds darkly, “There, people poured their own coffee.”
an experience he never wants to repeat... one that involved a bedpan and yet more nudity), followed again by vitals, rinse and repeat until dinner and bedtime.  At this point, just about anything new is a welcome distraction (excepting the aforementioned bowel movement).
“Toothbrush?”  Cas glowers and pulls his toothpaste a new toothbrush out from the vanity drawer, practically shoving them at Dean.  Dean chuckles and offers up a saucy wink before leaning over the sink to brush his teeth.  Cas isn’t the only one who can tease.
“Why is she here?” Dean grits out, resisting every temptation to wrestle that goddamned scythe out of the bitch’s fist and avenge Cas the only way he knows how. Sure, “Betty” would only be replaced with a new incarnation of the same asshole, but honestly? Dean’s got time to kill and slaughtering Death over and over again with their own scythe doesn’t sound like a half-bad way to spend the rest of his life, however long that may be.
“Run, Dean,” Mary orders, but Dean ignores her, looking desperately for a way through the flames.  Brave, stupid child. A sudden groan sounds from above, followed by a sharp crack. Boy, woman, and spirit look up simultaneously, but Castiel is the only one who can see Alastair gripping the ceiling in his blazing grasp and tearing it asunder.  The roof begins to cave in and Mary spins, eyes looking through Castiel as she pleads with the spirits, “Please, save him.”
“The best kind, Cas,” Dean whispers, reaching over to squeeze Castiel’s hand, “the kind that loves her.”
“Mmhmm,” he murmurs noncommittally between kisses, “I suppose we could do that now.  If that’s what you want…”
Cas, who pulled on Dean’s faded old AC/DC shirt when he ran out of clean laundry. Who kept the disposable cardboard coffee sleeve Dean wrote his number on as a keepsake. And who, on the night they met, didn’t mock him for being kind to Marv, even though the guy’s a dick. Didn’t recoil at the man’s bad manners or tell Dean he was probably going to spend the money Dean gave him on booze (which is almost certainly true).
Finishing his cereal and slurping the now purple-tinted milk, Dean shakes his head to clear it of sexy, Constantine-cosplaying computer nerds as he sorts through yesterday’s mail on the counter. Seeing an envelope with a return address for Boeing Industries in Arlington, VA, he pauses, fingering the top corner of the envelope for a long moment before finally tossing it back on the countertop.
As Dean started dicing butter and measuring flour for the beginnings of his choux paste, he’d heard muttering from the dark, tousle-haired head behind him, “I thought baking was a science, not a Bob Ross painting.” Dean snickered, but not wanting to come across as a creeper, had kept to his side of their shared workspace and tried to keep his eyes on his own cooking and not the perfectly rounded backside of the man working at the next stovetop.
Shortly after the doctors leave, a member of the hospital transport team comes to whisk Dean away, bed and all, for the aforementioned scans the neurologist ordered.
been a change,” she says, snapping the book closed. “But it’s nothing we can’t account for. It’s a good thing you let me see the book though. Otherwise, we could have run into a real snag.”
“Yeah...about that,” Betty says, looking as close to sheepish as Dean thinks the normally smug Reaper can get. She stretches out her arms and a moment later, the book appears there. It’s not lost on Dean that this probably means she could have called the book to her at any time while they were in the bunker before, but waited until Sam, Dean, and Jack were ready to hand it over. His trust in the new Death goes up incrementally.
Tightening his arms around Cas’ waist, Dean kisses with renewed vigor.  Cas responds just as eagerly, surging against Dean and pressing him backward against the countertop, the cool feeling of granite through his thin pinstriped boxers a sharp contrast to the heat he feels everywhere else.  Cas’ arms have migrated beneath Dean’s own, wrapping around them and gripping Dean’s shoulders from behind.  His hips pin Dean’s against the vanity and Dean can feel himself hardening in his boxers at the feeling.  Then Cas shifts his hips and Dean feels the press of the other man’s half-hard cock against his thigh.  He lets out an unintentional and completely un-fucking-avoidable moan at the realization that Cas is just as affected by their kiss as he is.
wishes to be in another car accident.  At least it would mean an end to this God-awful conversation.
Claire and Gabriel are already gone for the day when Dean gets to Cas’ apartment.  He knocks before letting himself in and it feels weird already.  Fuck, have they really gone and fucked everything up?
Pulling off his apron and tossing it over the back of his chair, he leans down to give Miracle a scratch. “We didn’t really ‘get’ a dog. It’s more like we got stuck with one,” he tries to defend himself to Patience, who looks at him with that same
“I’ve been wondering when you’d show your classically handsome, yet incredibly stupid face around here.  I’m not sure I’m talking to you right now,” the baker sniffs, barely glancing at Dean as he loads fresh pastries into the café’s display case.
“If the spell is tied to her life force or whatever,” Claire starts, cutting off Fergus’ tirade as she looks between the two of them, “what if we all add ours to it? Won’t that keep it from killing anyone if we share the load between enough of us?”
as Death, but I am no longer privy to Death’s foresight. I have no idea how Chuck dies. Or how to kill him.”
you've been hoping for, but I do hope it was enjoyable nonetheless. I think both of our "couples" made progress today, even though Cas and Dean's progress might not have been the kind we would have like to see. They definitely made big decision about the nature of their relationship, didn't they?
CJ’s name is Clarence? No wonder he goes by CJ. Of course, this is Meg, so who the fuck actually knows. Meg lies like breathing.
Blinking her way back to reality, she eyes her tea suspiciously, suddenly not sure if it’s more caffeine she needs or less. Turning back to her document, she sinks back into the world of her story. Truth be told, writer’s block hasn’t been much of a problem at all this time around. She’s really not sure what possessed her to write an ending to the
The sun shone bright and warm on the day they were to bury this world’s Bobby Singer and Dean resented its very existence.  The only small comfort he had was in knowing for a fact that there was no supernatural in this world and therefore no fucking celestial beings around to appreciate the fact that even the piece of shit sun had to have its turn fucking with Dean Winchester, mocking his stormy mood with enough cheerful sunbeams and chirping birds to fill a goddamn Disney movie.
Dinner passes in a flurry of pterodactyl screeches and rushed conversations about their days.  Though they’d met teaching at the same high school 9 years ago, they’ve both moved on to different schools since then and although Dean misses riding to work with his husband, the change has been good for both of them.  Dean listens to Cas commending a group of his AP English students’ clever use of Three Dog Night’s “One,” as the soundtrack to their video project on
Exhaling through his nose, Dean takes Cas as far back in his throat as he can.  He doesn’t choke this time, but he does swallow reflexively.  Cas groans and tightens the fist in Dean’s hair, pulling him off his cock.  Dean doesn’t pause before dragging the hand still wrapped around Cas up and down his shaft.  It only takes a couple of pulls before Cas is coming in thick white stripes across Dean’s chest.
“Every step we’ve taken in our relationship so far, you’ve led the way.  And I love you for that.  But this time, if you don’t mind, I think it’s my turn to take the lead.”
“Then I don’t see why not.”  Chuck shrugs then, claps his hands, “All right, I think it’s time to get this show on the road, but first..”  He moves to stand in front of Cas, who still doesn’t let go of Dean’s hand, for which Dean is immensely grateful.  He still doesn’t trust Chuck and he knows that holding onto Cas isn’t going to stop
Lisa’s brilliant smile falters for a half-second.  Before Dean can comment though, it’s replaced by one that’s just as wide, but a lot more predatory.
“What happened?” Sam Winchester asks, looking at the four young women standing on the other side of Rowena.
I hope you enjoyed my plan for Chuck. I have this image in my head of him and Metatron bickering in a coffee shop, Metatron assuring the barista Chuck is just speaking hyperbole ("He's a writer. You know how those creative types can be...") as he goes on about how the suffering he'd put every single employee at that pathetic excuse for a publishing house through if he were still God would make even Job's trials look insignificant by comparison. Pillars of salt. All of them! He'll show them "unoriginal and pedantic." The classics are classics for a reason. Anyways...I could easily picture an entire Odd Couple-esque sitcom of those two as Chuck suffers all the little trials and indignities of human life. 😂
I hope everyone enjoyed the chapter! We're getting so close to the other half of our two-person love triangle! What do you think of Dean's dream job? Did you have a dream job that's very different from what you ended up doing?
Seeing Dean staring at the meowing box with a disgruntled expression, Sam hesitates, his hand on the doorknob. “Good luck with the kitten. Are you sure you’ll be okay?”
had been. It was worth it though, to see Cas so happy and to be able to smell that fresh pine scent every time he walks into the room.
Dean’s cheeks are distinctly pink now, the double meaning to his words made even clearer by his shame-faced expression. Castiel’s heart aches at the sight.
“I bet we could write down anything and as long as it sounded vaguely science-y, he’d never know the difference,” Charlie scoffed.  Jo’s eyes hand twinkled mischievously and Charlie knew that whatever her friend had planned was a very bad idea, just as she knew she’d undoubtedly go along with it.  That’s how they ended up sneaking dirty words into their science homework, holding their breath each day as Lafitte “checked” their notebooks.  They grew bolder and bolder, increasing their dirty-word-to-science-vocab ratio, until eventually they were basically presenting their teacher with earth-science-themed-porn.  As it turned out, Charlie had been right.  As long as they threw in an occasional “igneous rock,” or “stratification,” all they got was a nod and a check mark.
“Oh,” Castiel says again, swallowing.  He feels a lurching feeling in his stomach as he realizes what’s been keeping Dean so busy lately.
Recovering swiftly, Cas rolls his eyes and shakes his head, though he can’t suppress the tiny smile tugging at his lips. The man is insufferable.
Dean paces for a minute longer, Cas watching helplessly from the doorway, before he bursts out angrily, “It was supposed to be
Anna, owner and teacher at Little Angels Childcare and Preschool, is currently bundling Claire into a green fleece jacket with white polka dots.   She’s undeniably pretty with her slim frame, light brown eyes, and vibrant red hair.  Under different circumstances, Dean wouldn’t hesitate to put on the Winchester charm and see if he could put a blush on Anna’s pretty features to match her hair color.  Now though, he’s only got eyes for one teacher.
Taking a deep breath, Dean scoots closer and reaches for Cas’ hand where it’s fisted in the blankets next to his leg.  Wrapping it in both of his own, he dips his head until he can meet Cas’ downcast eyes.
Twenty minutes later, Dean and Cas climb out of an Uber and look up at the windows of what is apparently
“Me?” Billie actually barks a laugh at that. “I was just going to kill you. You’re the one who launched into the love confession of the ages. Dean Winchester. Really, Castiel?”
Drawing back, he looks into Dean’s eyes, heavy and hooded, though which is weighing on them more, lust or exhaustion, is up for debate.
“I know.” She picks up the long, thin object next to the shadowed basin, feeling its cold weight in her palm. Knowing what comes after doesn’t make this part any easier. She fights the urge to make a joke, pushing aside her natural tendency toward sarcasm. This moment seems too big, too important, for gallows humor, even if she is uniquely qualified in that department.
of the entire thing hits Castiel and he slumps back against the maroon vinyl. Would Dean even believe him? And is this really a conversation he wants to have at the coffee shop? Where they
Dean sags in relief as he studies his friend. The guy’s usually impeccably ironed button-up is rumpled, his hair is even more of a mess than usual (which is really saying something), and every pore seems to radiate sadness. Cas looks like Dean feels and Dean takes a chance.
“I do. And I think we may not have a choice. I bet Charlie could even design car magnets with our business logos that we could put on the sides. It’s a great way to advertise without having to spend the money for a custom paint job.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathes, “Not that I’m not enjoying this, but it’s getting late. I’d ask you to stay, but I know you don’t—” Dean inhales sharply as Cas shifts above him to better see his face—”usually hook up on the first date. I wanna respect that, but I think I’m gonna need to end this date in order to do it.”
“Okay, Aunt Ellen, car’s parked. Where’s Dean?” A tall, lanky youth with light brown hair reaching past his ears fills the doorway. This has to be Dean’s brother. Cas isn’t sure if he’s more nervous or relieved to meet the little brother who is so clearly the most important person in Dean’s life. At least he knows who Sam is, though.
“Because,” Dean scoffs, “who in their right mind would wanna volunteer for this shit show, Cas? I’m a loser who barely graduated high school with a dead mom, a formerly drunk dad who abandoned me so he could go set up a franchise in fucking Minnesota of all places, and a fucked-up childhood. I’m not exactly cul-de-sac material.”
Face falling, Charlie shakes her head.  “Cas, I love you, but I don’t think I can talk to you right now.”
“You should,” Castiel advises as the rinses out the cloth and washes his hands at the sink. “Anyone who makes you feel like that is worth taking a chance on.” A small voice in the back of his mind taunts him for his complete inability to take his own advice, but he ignores it. It might make him a fraud and a hypocrite, but at the very least, maybe he can help Dean improve his romantic life. One of them should get the chance to be happy with the person they care about.
Castiel covers his face with his hands and sucks in a ragged breath.  He hadn’t realized just how heavily that fear had been weighing on his mind.  Now that it’s gone, the relief is dizzying.  He takes a long moment to compose himself, then drops his hands and looks at Dean with wet eyes.
Instead, he wraps his arms around Dean tightly and tells him, “The only place you’re going is to bed.”
Neither of them saw Dean exit the house, one hand hovering over his mouth as if willing himself not to be sick.
“Wait!” the other cried. “Please don’t throw me in. It’s late, and this is my only spare set of clothes that is dry, and most importantly, I brought you pie-fruit!”
But Sam, afloat in the war-torn waters of his fevered dreams, was listening from afar, and it sounded an awful lot like “Hope.”
“Sam,” Gabriel spoke, shouting to be heard over the thunder. “You said you wanted to remember.” He paused. Lighting sparked across the sky; the thunder sounded overhead moments later, and Sam felt a cool chill race down his back. “Be sure that is what you want.”
“Close,” Castiel sobbed out, and Dean pulled away, placing his hands on Castiel’s hands to still their motion. He moaned, hyper-aware of his throbbing need. “Please,” he whimpered.
Castiel shook his head back and forth, but then Dean did something unexpected and brilliant and torturous all at once – he straddled him and lined up their cocks, taking them both in hand and beginning to stroke, so slowly it hurt.
It was only when he stumbled into a clearing that he finally understood, all at once, and much too quickly, what Castiel had been trying to warn him of.
He couldn’t read Dean’s expression as the other leaned over the side of the bed to retrieve a water bottle he’d briefly placed in the freezer earlier. Castiel gratefully accepted it, pleased to find it was still cold.
It wasn’t until one of the possums gave Castiel a love bite that they sprung apart, Castiel nursing his ring finger, which the possum had seen fit to nibble upon.
“Castiel!” A voice was calling him from the surface. He rose from a fevered sleep and broke through the surface, only to find himself being hauled onto the shore by a furious Gabriel.
A heating unit in the corner would ensure their larger animals never got cold in the winters, even though said winters were mild, and a ventilation system sat beside it, ensuring they’d always have fresh air.
Dean smiled, so bright it reminded Castiel of the sun breaking over the waters of the river at sunrise. He could not help but return the gesture, and as Dean leaned in to kiss him, he thought there was no greater feeling in the world than being enveloped in the arms of his beloved.
,’ and I’m asking you the same question, now. Don’t you think you deserve more than this? More than bleeding your Grace dry on the off-chance this might work? Don’t you think you are owed that much at least?”
Lips quirking up in a half-smile, Castiel settled himself in Dean’s lap. “I don’t think you can possibly want me,” he said, “even half as badly as I want you.” With one smooth motion, he made Dean’s legs fall open and ground their hips together, drawing a ragged groan from Dean.
“What’s your job around here?” Dean had asked at one point, as the grueling mid-morning sun bore down on them. “Surely, it can’t be to follow me around and make sure I don’t fuck up.”
Castiel groaned in dismay. “As much as I’d love to, Gabriel said there’s a very important errand I must complete in the lowlands to the west. It’s about a quarter of a day’s ride each way.”
In the distance, the horizon blurred into little packets of heat and humidity. The fields of corn were unyielding, save for the small semicircle of flattened crops that fanned out around the place where Castiel appeared to have crash-landed.
Everything hung in the balance for a moment. The stars stilled in their orbits, the tides stopped responding to the ever-present tug of the moon, and the celestial bodies all trembled and stood still.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice penetrated the fugue. It clearly wasn’t the first time the other had spoken his name.
In the end, Gabriel didn’t leave him any choice in the matter, shoving him forward. Castiel yelped as he fell, but he landed on something soft a great distance away, within sight of Sam and Dean’s dwelling.
“Dean,” Castiel groaned. “Oh-” he said, moaning as his hips rose and fell to the rhythm Dean had set. “I need-”
The other’s calls were drawing closer, and Dean broke into a sprint when he saw the angel’s shadow in the half-light.
“Of course not,” Sam had sighed. “I’m the younger brother, so it falls to me to manage the matters of household, to trade with other dryads and to forage, and of course to practice magic of healing and strength.”
“I’m scared of losing you again,” the other whispered, twin trails of tears making their way down his face. Gabriel wiped them away angrily. “My answer still stands,” he said, ignoring the proffered hand and rising on his own.
Dean seemed to surface from the fog of his lust long enough to realize that they were out in the open, completely exposed. It wasn’t hard to imagine someone coming across them. Dean momentarily lost his nerve, but then his eyes fell upon Castiel, lips slightly parted and still shining, and he could not help but lean in for another kiss.
“I don’t know if you can hear me where you are,” he said, slowly, eyes filling with tears. “I don’t know if it matters – you said… You said saying it was enough. Is saying it… Enough? Or is it too late?”
The city stood across the waters – and Dean put a hand over his mouth and willed himself not to be sick.
Gabriel took the long way down the mountain. He was dreading going to Dean and Sam and Castiel with this revelation. He had time enough to lament the pettiness of his dreams, and he allowed himself to weep very quietly at the unfairness of it all, and the way everything he’d worked for over the past hundred years could be undone with a wayward snap of his fingers.
Dean looked at him with an expression of melancholy. "You deserve to be safe Cas and...you never will be with your dad or brother around. I know that now. I won't be able to protect you like I thought, like I promised..." Dean let out a small sob and hung his head.
"To get out of here, remember? To get away from home." Dean propped himself up on his elbows and looked out at the water before back at Cas.
Dean murmured a response and kicked off his boots, running across the sand with a carefree grin. "We should make a bonfire when it get's dark."
"Oh." Cas replied stupidly and followed Dean over to the student parking lot. Cas felt his mouth drop open a little bit when Dean opened the door of a 1967 Chevrolet Impala and threw in his backpack. He couldn't help it, he opened his mouth. "That's your car? Jesus, it's nice." Cas hesitantly slid into the passenger side and set his messenger bag in his lap.
He did go back to his apartment though, he had to. He hurried through the door, lowering his head so he didn't see something that would cause him to completely come undone. He unplugged his cassette player and hurried back out, not even bothering to lock the door behind him. He drove around aimlessly for the rest of the night, just waiting for the sun to rise.
Dean laughed as he went into the living room and turned on his cassette player. He watched Cas from around the corner. "I hate you." Cas muttered. "And you might want to find a better hiding spot, I can see you."
"So how did you two meet?" Jo asked again. You still never answered, but I bet it was super romantic."
Dean gave him a determined look. "Okay mister you think you cook a hell of a lot better than me. I bet you can't cook either."
They made their way outside to the nearly empty parking lot in stride. Dean hopped into his car with a smile. Maybe this is happiness. Cas followed suit and sank down into the seat, smiling shyly. They headed down the road when Dean's phone rang. He fumbled for it and flipped it open after checking the caller ID. "Hey Rick." Dean listened for a couple of seconds and then glanced over at Cas. "Fine, I'll be right over." He ended the call and gave Cas an apologetic look. "Hey, I hate to say this, but that was Rick, Dad wants me to go down to the garage, one of the mechanics called in sick."
Dean pinned him down and kissed him with a grin. "You know you can't stay angry with me." He took Cas into his arms and Cas blew a raspberry at him. Dean sat up, still holding onto Cas. "Are we going to try this again?" He asked, putting the flask in Cas's hands.
"So your just hiding behind it." Dean said, stating the obvious. Cas nodded his head slightly, he felt exposed, naked. Dean plopped the textbook down with a thud, re-instating Cas's wall of solitude. "There you go, hide from the world." Cas wasn't sure if he was being rude or just teasing so he didn't respond. "So, the civil war, nice and boring. Unless your a nerd and this is just your absolute heaven." Cas didn't respond and Dean studied him. "Are you always this quiet?" The bell rang and Cas scrambled to pick up his books and papers. "Hey, before you go running off to your next class, which, by the way, I'm sure you just don't stop talking in, where do you want to meet to work on this?"
They walked hand in hand outside where the sun was just begging to set. Cas smile when he spotted the impala. "Now this is home." He murmured as Dean started the engine and Cas reached over to put in a cassette. Dean smiled over at Cas softly before Cas reached over and kissed him on the lips.
Dean pulled Cas to him with a soft smile. "That's better." He whispered, reaching up to push Cas's hair away from his forehead. Dean moved to give Cas a kiss but Cas dunked him underwater and swam away. Dean resurfaced and gave Cas a playful smile. "Well if you want to play that way." He pulled Cas underwater by his feet but Cas somehow squirmed away and splashed his way to the shore. Cas plopped down on a rock and Dean lay down next to him. "I love you." Dean whispered, leaning over and tenderly kissing a bruise on Cas's neck.
They leaped up and went running across the sand holding hands like a pair of love stricken teenagers, which they were in a way.
Each day that passed was another weight bearing down on Dean, crushing him in excruciating slow motion. Each day was another day of lost hope. Each day was more pain, more fear and more memories. All he wanted to do was go back. Back to when Cas was okay.
It was sometime later that Cas looked up and spotted the clock. His heart pounded as he slammed the book closed and scrambled to pick up his things. "I gotta get home." The words rushed out in one long breath. "Want me to check these out under my name?"
Dean leaned in close and kissed him gently on the lips. A few tears managed to trickle down Dean's face as he let out a soft sob. "Cas, I can't. I just can't...."
Cas followed him in awe, standing by the edge of the water and admiring the scenery. The waterfall made a gentle splashing sound that was oddly comforting and the cliffs with the bushed and trees...it all took his breath away.
"Cas, I'm sorry. I know your whole world seems to be just falling apart, but it is better this way. They won't be able to hurt you anymore." Cas picked at a thread on the blanket, his composure sullen. "Cas, I'm sorry." Dean leaned down and gave him an awkward hug.
"Damn it." Dean paced and looked into the horizon. He finally stopped and placed his head in his hands. "Cas..I....I do." He was somehow able to squeeze the words out. "I love you okay, and damn it you must know that because....if you didn't then you must feel so damn alone and...."
"I know you are." Sam said quietly, giving him an empathetic look. "I could only imagine how I'd feel if this happened to Jess."
"Losers." Dean supplied, admiring the battered black 1985 mustang they had approached. "You can't tell Sammy what I'm doing."
"Hell yes." Cas laughed and pulled Dean close to kiss him. "Now you just have to break me out of here."
Dean looked at him carefully, swallowing another oncoming sob. "I'll find a way to get you out of this so you don't get hurt." He promised. "If it's the last thing I ever do, I'm going to destroy him and make sure that your safe." Cas tried to smile as Dean placed a lingering kiss on Cas's temple. "I promise." Dean whispered, looking into Cas's eyes and causing Cas's breath to catch. "I promise I'm going to get you out of this." Cas gave him a small, mostly worried smile.
Cas took Dean's hand again as they walked through the trees, the sunlight filtering through the canopy overhead. "It's so pretty down here, it makes me want to get into photography."
When she emerged Dean's knee was bobbing nervously. "Do you want me to stay sweetie?" Ellen asked, her eyes wet. "I will but I'll also understand if you want to be alone."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yeah, but we gotta hit the road." Dean said, jerking his thumb towards Cas. "Can't have mister goody two shoes being late-"
By this time Dean was bent over with laughter. He moved out of the way of Cas's tackle, causing Cas to crash to the ground.
Cas rolled his eyes and tried not to smirk. He let out a small sigh and looked up at the blue sky. "Just think, once school ends we'll be able to come out here all the time...."
"None taken. I hate this place too, but dad wants me to take over the garage, so I'm kind of stuck."
"Nope." Dean said with a grin. Cas shook his head with a small smile. "Damn it!" Dean shouted. "These need stitches and I don't have any dental floss or a needle!"
Dean took Cas's face in his hands and bowed their foreheads together. "No, you promise me something. Get rid of that guilt, about Meg, if something happens to me, just promise me that you won't blame yourself. Even if something does happen....I wouldn't give up my time with you for anything. I wouldn't change any of it. I fell in love with you and I wouldn't ever do anything to change that."
Dean laughed. "It's a lot simpler than that. You weren't in school that day, so I automatically knew something was up. You may hate school, but you hate home more. You said it yourself, school is your escape and when you didn't show for school, I knew something was wrong. So I waited until lunch and got into your file from the office-"
A few more tears trickled out but Dean kissed them away tenderly. "No," Dean whispered hoarsely. "I know it must be hard for you to believe, but it's all over-"
"Cas," Dean bowed his head and closed his eyes. "I love you." He murmured, looking into Cas's blue eyes and wondering if he could get lost in them, drown in the sea of blue. They were like the sky or the ocean, but more still. There were no words to describe them.
"Cas." Dean breathed, a hitch in his voice. He strode over and took Cas in his arms, which caused Cas's tears to finally fall. He pressed himself closer to Dean, leaning his head against Dean's chest. He felt Dean's grip on him tighten. "Cas." Dean whispered, his voice breaking. "Oh Cas....." He gripped the back of Cas's head with one hand and rocked him back and forth tenderly. "Cas." His voice was filled with horror and pain.
"Sure." Dean followed him up the stairs. "I hate this place." Dean announced, looking around the empty hallway in disdain.
Dean clapped Cas on the knee with a smile. "Come on, let's get out of here." Cas grabbed his stuff and followed Dean across the school grounds. He tried not to look as Dean stripped off his jacket and carried it in his arms. "Come on," Dean said, turning back to Cas. "It's nice out, you don't need that thing silly." He slipped off Cas's trench coat as if it were nothing and threw it at him with a grin. Cas caught it, his cheeks flaming. Cas stuffed his jacket and messenger bag in the backseat and Dean sped out of the parking lot. "Falls?" Dean asked, rolling down his window with a smile. "There's nowhere else I'd rather be in this weather."
Cas turned to Dean and gave him a shy smile. "Thanks Dean, but believe me, it's better this way. I'll see you tomorrow."
"Oh God, are you drunk?" Dean asked, trying to hold in his laughter. "Jesus Cas, it was only one beer." "I love you,"
"Dean," Cas murmured when he spotted the figure in the doorway. He seemed to be in a daze and it made Dean's insides clench with anger. "Dean," Cas repeated, his voice becoming a warning. "Go, you shouldn't be here-"
"...I had to get out of the house, I had to see you, I didn't think it was that bad." Dean shook his head as he dumped out the contents of his backpack onto the floor. "What are you looking for?" Cas asked shakily.
"Dean..." Cas looked down at the floor and tried to hold his food down. Even the subject made his stomach roll. "I can't...I have to go back home. If I don't..." He trailed off, afraid of his brother and father's wrath.
Cas took a deep breath. "A long time to be honest, but it really got worse after mom died." Dean shook his head sadly and Cas clenched his hand.
"Why do you think he's always in here sweetie?" Ellen laughed. "That boy couldn't even boil water if his life depended on it."
Dean pulled Cas close by his belt loops to give him a kiss before grabbing his car keys and wallet. "Here, wear it." Dean said, giving Cas his leather jacket. Cas was confused but gave Dean his trench coat wordlessly. Dean grinned wickedly. "I guess that means I have to wear this old thing." He slipped on the trench coat with a smile and took Cas's hand as they walked out to the car.
He ended up by the turnoff for the falls, but he drove right by. He couldn't, he just couldn't. Nowhere would ever feel the same again because everywhere would remind him of Cas. The falls wasn't Dean's spot anymore, it was their's, and he wouldn't go alone.
"Really?" Dean asked, opening one of the doors of his car and pulling out a package of marshmallows and a package of hot dogs. "Bet I could make it better."
"Dean is right sweetie, you need to be more careful." Ellen chided. "Life is precious, you need to respect that."
"Cas, no." Dean's voice was hard yet pleading. "We're not going to go there because I swear to God I will start crying right here in front of you."
"My parents?" Dean let out a tiny laugh as he unlocked the door. "I live by myself. I already told you that, remember?"
Cas beamed with pride and Dean kissed him. "I'm proud of you." Dean whispered, his hot breath tickling Cas's ear. "So damn proud." Cas smiled and turned to him, giving him a long kiss. Cas's hand rose to caress Dean's cheek and he sighed as he leaned into Dean. Dean placed a kiss on the tip of Cas's nose before Cas pulled him back down to his lips. He ran his hands through Dean's hair as Dean moved closer, holding Cas against him by a hand on the small of his back. "God, Cas." Dean murmered, gently placing a kiss on Cas's exposed neck. Dean tenderly touched the bruise on Cas's shoulder, which filled him with anger. "I don't want you to go." Dean said truthfully, searching Cas's eyes as he stroked Cas's cheek with his thumb.
"Um." Cas sputtered. He hadn't expected Dean to ever acknowledge him again much less sit down and talk with him.
At this Dean couldn't hold it in any longer. He felt a few lone tears trickle out but was somehow to keep in the shoulder shaking sobs. "I love you too Cas...I'm so damn glad I found you." Dean shakily caressed Cas's cheek with his thumb.
Dean gave him a confident smile. "No problem." He squeezed Cas's hand as Ellen came back with their food.
Dean pulled Cas close and held him against his chest. He kissed the top of Cas's head before letting him go. "Okay mister,it's bedtime for you." Dean said sternly, nudging Cas towards the bedroom.
Dean rolled his eyes and cleaned his plate with a smile. "Alright, I'm never going to challenge your cooking skills again."
Dean let out a long sigh. He knew he didn't stand a chance, he'd always give in to Cas. "Fine, but no excuses tomorrow."
"Thanks." Cas mumbled, leaning his head against the window. Dean gently stroked the side of Cas's cheek that faced him with a soft smile. "You know it's harder to fall asleep with you doing that, right?" The skin where Dean's hand had been seemed to be on fire, but in a good way.
Cas smiled as he leaned down and placed a kiss on Claire's forehead. "Goodnight Claire." Cas whispered before standing up and walking away.
"Thanks." Cas said honestly, watching the darkened world pass outside the window. It was quite for a few more minutes. Cas wished Dean would put on some music or something but it seemed like he had more to say
Dean's hands slipped underneath Cas's shirt and he pulled him even closer. "Cas?" He asked quietly, the silent question hanging in the air. Cas broke him off with a responding kiss. He let his hands slide down Dean's body and he let out a soft sigh.
“Um, yes?” Castiel scrnches his eyebrows at the oddly-acting blonde. “How did you know Dean is on his way to the Bean, anyway? Did he call you?” He can’t imagine why Dean would have called Jo to let her know he was going into work, unless of course they had plans. Oh dear. Had Dean lied when he told Castiel he was free? It would be just like him.
Dean adopts a wounded look as Castiel climbs the steps toward him, a plastic-wrapped tray in his arms.
“True, but I hardly think this is the same as collapsing into a cheap motel bed for a 2 hour nap after spending 6 hours hunting a wendigo in the rain.”  He pauses, then continues, “Sharing a bed as a married couple.  It has.. connotations.”
Surprised, Castiel pauses before answering cautiously, “Are you sure you still want me to come?  It’s okay if you’d rather bring Lisa.”
“I can’t believe you forgot the milk again!”  Cas grumbles from his position kneeling next to the bathtub while Jack and Emma splash happily in the warm water.
much stretch, he hooks his fingers and turns them in search of Cas’ prostate. A few thrusts of his fingers later he reaches his goal, drawing a half-moan, half-shout from the man writhing against him.
Americano now in-hand, Dean finally makes his way back to his hotel. After more than half a decade in the spotlight, he’s become something of an expert at eluding paparazzi and he’s fairly certain he’s managed to avoid the goddamn vultures as he slips in a side door. He’s probably being overly cautious. Being an NHL player isn’t exactly the same as being an A-List celebrity, even if Dean does garner more attention than most. Still though, paps can smell a scandal from a mile away, so it never hurts to be careful.
“Since when do I need a special occasion to cook?” Dean deflects while whisking together the dry ingredients. “You know that’s what I
“You have a…lovely home,” he says diplomatically.  Dean assures him that humans tell “white lies” like this all the time, especially when they want something, and Castiel definitely wants something from this unconventional hedge witch.
Dean watches the medevac grow smaller as it carries Cas toward the trauma center at the University of Kansas Medical Center’s main campus in Kansas City.  It’s the top trauma facility in the state of Kansas;  he’ll be in good hands there.  Sighing, Dean shakes his head at himself before turning away from the shrinking chopper and walking back toward the accident scene.
“Glasses.  They were on the floor of the Highlander.  Probably flew right off Cas’ face.  I’ll stop by the hospital and drop them off tomorrow before my shift.”
He hadn’t been planning to be so late, but got caught up talking to Gabe when he dropped by the apartment. Most of their conversation had been Gabe teasing him mercilessly about his current living arrangement with Dean, true, but it had still been nice to reconnect with his friend, mortifying as it was.
That done, Castiel uses the buttons on the side rail of his hospital bed to recline the mattress and lies back for his previously interrupted nap.
“I don’t know,” Cas considers, “I’ve always thought Brad Pitt’s too full of himself to be a good lover.  Edward Norton may look unassuming, but I bet he’s a force to be reckoned with in bed.”
“One vegan option plus a seasonal item offered daily, with additional items to be added pending success of the first two and the hiring of more bakery staff,” Cas says brusquely, leaning against the peninsula with his arms crossed in front of him. “But, not only do you have to promise not to tease Dean for the way we met, you also have to do what you can to deter others.”
Climbing onto the stool next to Gabe’s, Charlie opens her laptop on the counter. “So don’t,” she says, eyes focused on her screen as she types furiously. Smiling triumphantly a moment later, she turns the computer sideways to face both Gabe and Castiel. “Just train someone who’s already in-house.”
Smiling, Castiel looks up as a grinning Alex steps into his room, “Castiel?  You have guests waiting in the common room.”
He shrugs again, “Just goes to show that they’re right.  You should never send a man to do a woman’s job.”
Cas chuckles as he follows her down the hallway to say hi to Sheriff Mills himself. A long-time regular, she’d asked Dean if he’d be willing to tackle a special request for her son, Owen, who insisted upon a “slime cake” for his eighth birthday. Dean had been happy to oblige. He’d tried three different recipes for the neon green “slime” icing before he’d been satisfied.
“Please, Cas.  I don’t know what you’re so afraid of, but I want to help you.  Please, just let me help you.  Let me take care of you.”

Pulling a bowl and a box of Captain Crunch (because Dean’s a grown goddamn man and he can eat whatever cereal he wants, thanks) he wonders what kind of cereal Cas likes, or if he’s more of a toast or bagel guy. If Cas had stayed, maybe they could have hit up that greasy spoon a couple blocks over that Dean likes. It’s perfect hangover food and Dean would bet Cas is a bit hungover this morning. He didn’t drink much more than Dean, really, but the guy didn’t look like someone used to a lot of liquor.
And Cas, hopeful look in his eyes or no, just had what Dean is pretty sure was a panic attack of some sort back at the arena. It’s probably not a good time for him to be jumping into anything, and what kind of asshole would Dean be for taking advantage of Cas’ vulnerable state right now?
He’s still nodding along distractedly to Gabe’s animated retelling of his and Kali’s latest spat and, Dean cringes, reconciliation, when Charlie throws her arms around him in a fierce hug.
“Dean,” blue eyes bore into green, “I’m sorry you had to go through that and I’m so sorry you lost your mother.  Is she why you decided to become a firefighter?”
Already, Jack can hear Chuck’s words ring true, feeling his grandfather’s power strengthening as his own grasp weakens.
Dean jerks upward, nearly braining himself on the dryer he’d been reaching into, when he feels the sudden press of his husband’s denim-clad erection against his ass.
Blinking to clear the sudden onslaught of memories, Dean looks around with a small smile. It might not look like the Santa’s workshop Mrs. Butters created, but he still thinks he and Sam did alright. There’s a large tree set up in one corner of the library, decorated in an assortment of red and gold ornaments that Dean will be forever grateful came already packaged as a set. Add some twinkle lights, a little tinsel, and a star for the top and bam. Christmas bunker.
Having spent the drive to Dean’s neighborhood, a small manufactured home park on the outskirts of town, thinking of a plan to find or coax Cupcake back home, Castiel managed to completely forget that it was “CJ” Dean messaged for help and that he’s certainly not going to be expecting his friend Cas from work to show up instead.
“If there’s anyone here who should feel any kind of shame over where they come from or how they were raised, it’s me,” Castiel says hotly. “And I would
“If you recall, I never said we were going to a restaurant,” Gabe answers cryptically.  “I just said we were going

“Kiss me,” Dean pleads against hot skin. Cas cranes his head toward Dean and Dean releases him long enough to place a palm against Cas’ cheek to help him along. The kiss is sloppy and desperate and perfect. Finally taking Cas in hand, Dean deepens the kiss as much as he can given the angle while Cas moans into his mouth.
Finally, thank you again to the creative minds who brought to life the story and characters of Supernatural, not that you'll ever see this. While it's true that we can always write our own ending, mine wouldn't exist (nor would the rest of my writing), without the incredible beginning you gave us. Thank you for Supernatural and thank you for Destiel.
“The Shadow,” Castiel explains next to him and Dean, acting purely on instinct, steps in front of him.
manage to scare the hell out of Dean every damn time, she’s also taken to climbing everything she can find (it’s a good thing his sofa was already a secondhand piece of crap), knocking things off of end tables, and stealing and hiding whatever of Dean’s belongings are small enough for her to carry. Fortunately, her hiding spots are fairly predictable. Dean’s gotten used to searching under the couch for his keys and sunglasses. Of course, the first time this happened and he couldn’t find said sunglasses, driving to work with the sun reflecting off their fresh, mid-March snowfall had nearly blinded him.
“Sure, I’ll get your kitty.” Clambering off the bed, Dean fetches a small, orange and white stuffed kitten from Claire’s toy box.
“Oh, right.  So, what do you wanna do?”  Before Castiel has a chance to answer, Dean snaps his fingers.  “I know,” an elaborate green and blue striped kite appears in Dean’s hands, “I’m going to teach you how to fly a kite.”
“Isn’t there anything else you can tell us about the plan?” Sam asks Betty and thanks Sammy, way to defend your brother’s intelligence. He
coping mechanism, but you did it as responsibly as you could.  You stopped drinking and left without incident when the bartender cut you off, you made the choice to take an Uber instead of driving, and you went somewhere safe where there was someone to help you instead of going home alone.  All in all, yesterday and last night could have gone so much worse.”  His voice warbles on the last word and guilt clenches in Dean’s stomach.  Now, on top of everything else, he’s gone and worried Cas.  Scared him even.
And, since a lot of my questions are parent-centered and I don't want to leave any of my readers out, if you DON'T have kids, you can feel free to substitute "drunk-people-charades" into the question above. 😂
“As I said,” Rowena explains patiently, “We were in Death’s library, which is outside of Chuck’s creation. He couldn’t reach us there.”
Holding up his phone he starts to read one of their most recent reviews. “‘Three stars. This place has five-star coffee, but one-star bagels. Too bad, because I really do like their iced mocha.’”
“The point is, Castiel, Dean hasn’t been my client in more than five years.  Leaving people behind isn’t really something he does.”
Regarding warnings, there are a few for this chapter, so please check the end notes before reading if needed.  Okay, enough procrastinating from me, on to the chapter.
Cas eagerly complies, fucking up into Dean’s fist and then rocking down onto his finger.  Dean urges him on as Cas takes his finger all the way in, his breaths turning to ragged pants.
For his part, Dean has gone back to staring at Castiel like this is the first time he’s ever seen him. He supposes, in a way, it is, but he hopes seeing his True Form won’t cause Dean to lose sight of the rest of him. He’d shown Dean far more of his true self that night in the dungeon than he’s seeing now. And what wouldn’t he give for
Dean’s booming laugh from across the dining room brings Castiel back to himself with a jolt, his face flushing a deep red as he realizes where his mind had wandered at work. When Linda returns from her break a moment later, Castiel escapes the front of the shop, heading for a much needed breather in the kitchen’s walk-in cooler.
“So, is this it then? Last night was our ‘one more night?’ A two-month seduction for a one-night-stand seems a little over-the-top to me, but what do I know?” The words taste bitter, curling Cas’ tongue like over-steeped tea.
“Plus, since Alice in ONEderland,” she annunciates, holding up a finger to signal the number one, “is a popular first birthday party theme, you could always do that for her party and reuse her costume!”
Sure, he’d taken an abandoned kitten in for the night. Who wouldn’t? He would have had to have been a monster to let the poor little thing freeze to death.
Next week:  Cas and Dean both reveal a couple of big decisions (pinky promise), Thanksgiving comes to our happy little Kansas family, Cas takes a HUGE step forward in his recovery (hint, hint), aaaaand Christmas decorating!  Whew, there is A LOT going on next week!  Farewell until then, dear friends!
“What is it, sweetheart?”  Dean asks as he gently presses Castiel down into the memory foam.  “What’s goin’ on in that head of yours?”
“I see you’re still holding a grudge about that whole me pitting you and Sam against one another thing. If it helps, I was rooting for you!” Lucifer pastes on his favorite faux-innocent expression and Castiel clenches his fists at his sides. The fact that this festering canker is even in sight of his son sets Castiel on edge, his grace sparking and snapping at the tips of his fingers, urging him to violence. He quells it...barely.
Charlie frowns. “Everyone has at least one friend. Dean’s around people all the time. How can he not have friends?”
That’s all the talking they do for the next several minutes as they turn in opposite directions, walking in a large circle around the empty field. It’s unsettling, seeing the tall prairie grass stand unnaturally still, bent in the direction the wind had been blowing when Jack froze time. No breeze blows now though and if Sam had thought the world felt lifeless before, that feeling now is ten-fold.
Dean smiles down at his phone. He knows it kills Cas to hear his baby cry and not be there even if he knows logically that she’s fine, but he also knows Cas won’t just barge in and take over, because he trusts Dean as Claire’s other parent.
Looking satisfied, Sam dries his hands on a towel and leaves the kitchen.  Dean finishes prepping the vegetables, steadfastly ignoring the voice in the back of his head that tells him Sam’s advice might already be a little too late.
Dean blushes, glad for the darkened room, as his mother continues, “Of course, with the string of bimbos you paraded around in the years right before you met Castiel, your father and I were just so relieved you’d finally brought home someone of substance, I’m not sure we would have cared whether they were male, female, or a cactus.”
He wonders if those hands are running across CJ’s soapy body right now, his thumbs grazing those brown nipples. Dean runs a thumb over his own nipple and shivers at the zing it sends straight to his cock.
“Castiel,” Chuck says, eyes soft and serious, “I know you’ve wanted to talk to me for some time now.  I apologize for avoiding you, but I knew that I had no words you would want to hear from me.  I am everything you think me.  I failed you, abandoned you, sacrificed you.. and yet you remained my most loyal and devoted child.”
Breaking away from their kiss, Cas drops to his knees.  Dean feels momentarily bereft at the loss of Cas’ tongue in his mouth, but the feeling is short lived.  Cas doesn’t play or tease, hands wrapping around Dean’s thighs in a vice-like grip before deep-throating Little Dean like his goddamn
Resigned, he had sighed and assured the daycare assistant that he was on his way.  After assigning reading for his students to complete and quickly arranging for an office staff member to cover the last 25 minutes of his class, Castiel had rushed to his SUV and pulled quickly out of the parking lot.  Feeling guilty and eager to get Claire home, Castiel’s mind had jumped from thoughts of how much children’s ibuprofen he had at the house, to how he was going to rearrange his lesson plans for the next week to make up for missing half a class today (thank goodness it was Friday and he’d at least have the weekend to make adjustments), to how he was going to get dinner made with a sick child at home (not to mention the grocery shopping and other errands he needed to do this weekend).  Castiel loved his daughter more than anything, but sometimes the stress of being a single parent caught up to him.  Feeling exhausted and defeated, Castiel had pulled up to the stop sign at an intersection less than five minutes from his school, his mind still on his seemingly endless “to do” list.  He had looked both ways before pulling into the intersection.  He knows he did.  Did he see the other SUV?  How could he not have?
Making a face, he opens the can of wet food Cupcake always starts her day with before dumping it onto a saucer with a disturbingly moist
“There, I’ve got you.  Just relax,” says Dean, easily taking Castiel’s weight as he sags against him with a sigh of relief.  Castiel has no idea how long they sit like that, only vaguely aware of the movement and voices of Dean’s fellow firefighters around him as they cut away the driver’s side door.  The floaty feeling from before starts to press against Castiel’s consciousness again and he feels himself start to drift like an unmoored boat floating away from the shore.
which means it’s his first official day as a baker and his first day keeping bakers’ hours. Not, of course, that Dean has the first fucking idea what he’s doing here. Whipping up apple pie and buttercream frosting at home with his beat-up old hand mixer is a far cry from baking enough pastries to sustain a business in that fancy industrial kitchen with its three ovens and giant-ass floor mixer that, quite frankly, scares Dean a little bit.
Gabriel smiles, “The munchkin’s fine.  Charlie’s got her for the day, which is why your BFF isn’t sitting next to your bedside with me.  I do have a message for you though.  I’m supposed to tell you not to worry about anything (not that you’ll listen), your classes will be taken care of (even though you’ll probably complain about what an awful job your sub did once you’re back), and that she will be royally kicking your ass for leaving her to face the ‘rabid hoards of teenage hormones’ on her own.”
thing he wants to do now that it seems like he might actually have another chance with the man in front of him.
Letting out a humorless chuckle, Dean wonders why his family and friends complain that he never tells them things.  When in his damn life has he ever even gotten the
Castiel rolls his eyes as he opens the passenger door of the Impala.  He’d thought about trying to convince Dean to bring the Pilot since it would be better on the Singer-Harvelle’s long gravel drive, but the firefighter was already scandalized enough by his beverage choice.
“Mmm,” Cas agrees in that deep rumble of his. “I’ll have Charlie write up a job posting and we’ll see if we can find some extra help, even if it’s just someone part-time for catering events. Was the van okay?”
“Alright,” Dean tilts his head, accepting the response before he asks his next question, “but why now? Why after all these months?”
“Well, I coulda told you that,” Dean quips, eyes growing dark again as he touches himself, looking down at Cas’ body.  Cas fumbles weakly for the bottle of lube, tossed carelessly onto a pillow, and squirts some into Dean’s hand.
“Yeah, well it looks like you need it way more than me. No offense, but you look like hell, man. You okay?”
relationship?  Was it Bart?”  God, Dean hopes not.  He hopes Cas had at least one positive relationship between the bitch who abused him and the asshole who used him.
“Less so even,” he adds wryly, looking down at his lap, where blankets cover the many well-stitched incisions from when a team of surgeons had worked for hours to repair Castiel’s shattered pelvis and punctured bladder.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, not a care in the world. "It happens." He walked back out to the kitchen and Cas trailed after him. "But I suppose your in a big rush to get to school." Dean rolled his eyes.
"Dean, open your eyes damn it!" Benny shouted as the nurses ran Dean through the hallways to the nearest free room. "Don't you dare die on me!"
Cas glared at Dean's retreating back and let out a long sigh as he downed the rest of his coffee and got another cup. He couldn't help but smile as he heard Dean's voice float from the bathroom, singing along to AC DC with enthusiasm unbelievable this early in the morning.
Dean clenched his jaw and pulled away, giving Sam a tight smile. His mind and heart were reeling and he felt numb. Like he was disconnected from his body. Like all this was happening to another person. "I think I just need some space." Dean whispered, taking off down the hallway.
He turned to the younger and pinned him against the wall again. "I'm going to make sure neither of you ever lay a fucking finger on him again!" Dean felt a rage build inside him and his heartbeat sped up from the adrenaline pumping through his body. Oh, how badly he wanted to punch him, to hurt him, to even kill him. But the thought of Cas lying on the floor helplessly cleared his head. He had to get his priorities straight. He could deal with those two assholes later, right now it was Cas who was important. He backed away and knelt beside Cas as he heard the ambulance pull up.
"They're kissing!" The employee that had rearranged them popped out of nowhere and squealed. "Which totally needs to happen. Like, aren't they just the cutest couple? They love each other so much, I just wish they would make it canon!"
"Do you have your reindeer up on the roof?" Mary asked anxiously. "I want to meet them! Can I have one for a pet?"
"I know she didn't kill herself, she wouldn't! I know it was Dad, he killed her and didn't want to get caught so he made it look like a suicide! Jesus...I wish I hadn't seen her like that..."
They pulled into the library parking lot and Cas was surprised to feel sad that their journey was over. Cas got out and gently closed the car door. Dean noticed and walked over. "You are officially cool in my books, nobody slams baby's doors." He ran his hand over the trunk before heading inside.
"Who cares? Late I think." Dean replied, running his hand up and down Cas's arm. "You feeling any better?"
Cas's blood pounded in his ears as he pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. He dialed the number with shaking fingers, his ribs aching furiously. He pressed the phone to his ear so hard that it hurt, but he was used to pain. Pain was nothing anymore.
Cas woke to sunshine filtering through the window. He groggily rolled over onto his side, shielding his eyes from the sun.
"No you don't." Cas interrupted as he followed him. "You might get some help from Ellen or Jo or something."
Breathing suddenly seemed labored and Dean felt his heart jolt. He was suddenly afraid of being alone. Afraid of what like would turn out without Cas by his side, without Cas to lean on. Without Cas, period.
"And it's all my fault!" Cas let out a soft sob. "God, I wish I could go back in time and tell the both of you to run far away from me."
He didn't sleep though. Hell, he didn't even want to go back to his apartment. He knew he would see Cas's jacket still hung up next to his. Or see some of Cas's clothes or textbooks and loose it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean shook his head with a small smile. "I keep forgetting your Mr. Goody Two Shoes." Dean turned to go.
His car keys fell to the floor with a gentle clang but he didn't notice as he fell to the floor in front of the slumped body.
Dean leaned forward, his hands resting on the table in front of them. "Well then do something about it."
"Thanks." Cas whispered, but Dean had already hung up. Cas sat cross legged on the sidewalk, trying to forget those horrible images. In another few months he would be 18, legally an adult. He would be able to move out. The very thought scared him though because it seemed wherever he went, his brother and father would find him. There was nowhere to hide, no escape.
Cas laughed as he wrapped his arms around her. "Okay, listen." Cas took a deep breath, dreading his next words. "It was me." He rushed out. "It wasn't really Santa you saw tonight,  it was me dressed up in that stupid suit. Dean wasn't kissing Santa at all, he was kissing me."
"Dean!" Cas's head shot up and Dean searched his eyes anxiously. "You can't! You can't ever stop it! Ever! There is no end! Nobody can help! God, now I've put you in danger too! Dean, I'm sorry!"
"Let's head out then." Cas grabbed his messenger bag, which he'd almost forgotten he had with him, and followed Dean out to the car. He searched through Dean's cassettes and put one in the stereo.
"I'm gonna start working on Sammy's mustang today. I hope you don't mind. But you can tag along, I might need your help."
Cas let out a squeak as he was pulled away from the crowd of people and around the corner. "Hey!" He cried, but his tone softened when he saw Dean. "Hey." He repeated, softly this time.
Cas and Dean finished eating and Jo cleared away the dishes. "Hey Dean," Jo called. "Don't let him get away, he seems like a special one. And bring him around more often would ya?"
Cas blushed and Dean wrapped an arm around his waist as they headed outside. He stopped by the car and kissed Cas gently, his hands rising up to cup Cas's face. "The special one indeed. I won't ever let you get away." Dean murmured, Cas blushed again as he opened the passenger door.
He could feel Dean's eyes on him, surveying him, judging him. He took a deep breath just as Dean leaned over to inspect his textbook. "What the hell has got you so interested? Hiding some porn in there or something?" Cas held his breath as Dean grabbed his textbook and scoffed. "You always like to read this crap?"
"Hey you." Dean said, giving Cas an affectionate smile. Cas smiled back as he grabbed his lunch from his locker. "Nope." Dean said, shoving Cas's lunchbox back inside his locker. "You are going to eat some real food."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean grabbed his arm and pulled Cas back. "You can take the bus if you want, but I'm taking my car."
Cas let out an awkward laugh. "Nuh uh,not me....Dad did actually. Well, before...." Cas searched through the compartment and found a 1967 Impala, laughing in astonishment. "God, I forgot I had this." He ran his hand over it with a small smile before placing it in Dean's hand. "Here, I want you to have this-"
"Dean, promise me." Cas's voice was wobbly. "Promise me you'll find me. I don't wanna be alone-" A sob caught in his throat. "Please." There was a desperate plea to his voice and it made Dean feel pain he could never have imagined.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas's waist and kissed the back of his head. "Mmmmm." He murmured, he could still here Zeppelin playing softly in the other room.
Mary's face lit up as 'Santa' approached her and bent down to hug her. Mary wrapped her arms around Cas's neck as he picked her up. "Santa I've been really good all year, just ask Dean!"
Dean got up and followed him. "Why not?" Cas shrugged his shoulders as he piled their arms with books and headed back to their table. "So....what's your favorite band?" Cas shrugged his shoulders. "What's your favorite TV show?" Cas shrugged his shoulders. "Favorite movie?" Cas shrugged his shoulders once again. "Okay dude, seriously, enough with the freaking shoulder shrugging." Cas buried his head in a book, hoping Dean would take the hint. He did. He even picked up a book himself and leafed through it.
He tried to cover them up the best he could, but there was no way to hide the cut under his left eye or the bruise on his left cheek. He debated for half a second of not even going to school. There would be questions after all, but they had to finish their project. And Cas had to get out. He had to get away from his father and this house. School was the best option, an escape.
"Nope. If it's bedtime for me then it's bedtime for you too." Cas reached out and snagged Dean's wrist.
