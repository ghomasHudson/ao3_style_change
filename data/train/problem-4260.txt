A swell of shouts and laughter rises from the small crowd that’s gathering around the Miltons, as more friends and family join in.
Cas can feel the smile spreading across his face, and can see the answering curve of Claire’s lips.
“It doesn’t matter what they think about me,” Cas snaps. “Jack has their respect.”
Anna meets him half-way. Before he can ask how she’s doing, she takes his hand.
Sometimes Cas would babble when they were together like this. In Enochian, or Aramaic, or Greek. Strings of syllables that were meaningless to Dean, although he understood the desperation in Cas’ voice, the sincerity, as Cas tried to share as much of himself with Dean as possible.
They slid into the car, with Cas behind the steering wheel. Dean passed him the keys.
But he also remembers that Other world, where humans lived on a dying planet, huddled together and hiding in forests, hunted by angels.
When Dean glances up, he notices Cas watching him. Dean’s lips quirk shyly, and colour rises in his cheeks, but Cas doesn’t stop looking. He’s allowed to look now, Dean told him as much himself.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up and he’s about to ask,
“Come on, you gotta have a setting between ‘fully-suited-up’ and ‘naked’,” Dean says. He’s leaning over the side of his bed, reaching to grab his t-shirt and pajama pants from where he discarded them on the floor last night.
“I’m not saying it was
"I give you headaches?" Cas asks in a small voice.
“Like this?”
“Yeah. Of course.” He laughs uneasily. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Dean?” Claire prompts with a note of concern.
“There’s still time to run errands before the stores close.”
Dean wrenched himself away from Cas, who let out a petulant whine.
Castiel thinks back to fields full of scorched wings, to so much blood it seemed to run off his hands in rivers, to primordial beasts determined to feast on humankind.
“The heaven that we’re in now, it’s still just based on a memory. But what would your perfect heaven look like?”
Dean scrambles back reflexively. “Don’t touch me!” he hisses, the painful, overwhelming mass of emotion still too fresh and terrifying.
Sam won, but not by much, and that was enough for Dean to clap Cas on the shoulder and tell him, “That was a real good game, man.”
When they’re done, they rest in an orchard in the south of France. The sun is warm and the air is sweet with ripening apricots. Jack sits in long grass that’s as gold as the sun, and leans back on his elbows, a pleased curve to his mouth. “I think we did good work today!”
“People generally want to be with their families, Uriel.”
Dean considers telling Cas that his distracted rambling makes him worry, but decides against it. Instead he says, “We’re stuck in Purgatory. 'Worried’ is pretty much my default setting.”
“I love you,” Dean says, looking Cas solidly in the eye. He says the words like he’s casting a rope around Castiel and pulling him close. He hasn’t let go of Cas’ tie.
Cas can’t look Sam in the eye.
Meanwhile, Cas sits next to Eileen at the map table as Sam fills Jody in on the details of defeating Chuck. Jody listens with eyebrows halfway up her forehead and mouth hanging open.
“Not if you -” Cas cuts himself off, but Dean thinks he’s beginning to understand anyways.
“I will. To his face.”
Dean swallows, and licks his dry lips. “Yeah. I said you could do that, didn't I?”
“Hey, why don’t you talk to Dean about it?”
He pushes Cas back with a gentle hand on his chest, and slides out from between him and the counter. Their eyes stay locked as Dean trails his fingers down Cas’ sleeve to take his hand.
“Jali-il!” Aaila whines.
“Nah, Sam’s right,” Dean says, waving Cas off with a tight smile. “Stay, hang out. I’ll see you in a bit.”
He tucks his phone into his pocket, and strides into the kitchen with his arms spread wide. "How’s this?" he asks.
“I never knew my father,” Uriel interjects, his voice soft and deep, and mildly slurred. “But I can tell you that your son has already surpassed him in every way.”
Maureen had told them not to do anything, so Dean just bounced on the balls of his feet as he waited for her to return. Of course he was excited, he always liked it when a woman knew what she wanted and took charge. It wasn’t that what was about to happen was so different from what he and Cas were used to doing together. They’d still be showing a lady a good time, just the way they’d be going about it would be a little different.
“So get this: it looks like a haunting at the Boston Aquarium.”
“Hey! Bill Murray is awesome!” Dean countered. “Cas enjoyed it, right?” Dean said this confidently. He had seen Cas’ mouth quirk up, and his eyes glittering with mirth in the TV-light, so he knew he was right.
“With the classics, of course,” Dean answered, and typed “A fistful of dollars” into the search bar.
“Anything else?”
Dean’s legs hit the bed, and Cas shoves him backwards.
working.”
“Hester. Rachel,” Anna replies.
Cas falls over the edge.
Castiel is purpose, and that’s one thing that has not changed. He draws some comfort from that. Castiel is a warrior (
She looks around the table, smiling, eyes glittering. “Come on! Let me show you guys around!” she says, and springs to her feet.
That was how they met Cathy.
"Just sayin’," Dean shrugs, "I’d better look for some new recipes."
In the hallway, Cas smiles and blushes.
"Yeah, that’d be great," Dean says, tension switching out for enthusiasm. "Hey, I’ve got just the thing to make, too: I was looking at all these fancy ways to do a grilled cheese -- that sounds like Jack’s sorta thing, right?"
“Like what?” Dean asked skeptically.
“No,” Cas says, voice rough in Dean’s ear.
Cas considers his answer before saying, "It means that you saved me."
“Yeah?”
Anna turns to Cas, and her face is not at all as flat and lifeless as her voice has been. Wide, glistening eyes and quivering lips, she says, "I’m not really their daughter."
By the end, Dean was covered in 20 year-old lymph, Cas was gasping on the floor where he had collapsed after the witch had tried to choke him, and Sam was holding her decapitated head by the hair.
“Why don’t we move this to the bed?” Dean suggested, keeping his tone seductive.
Castiel’s head snaps around to look at Dean, and look on his face is horrified, disgusted.
A worry line appears between Dean’s brows. "Oh."
Dean rolled his eyes, but there wasn’t any real ire behind the gesture. “Don’t worry about it, it’s on me.” With one last pat on Cas’ back, Dean headed towards the bar.
The sound of electric organ floated from the speakers as they pulled out of the parking lot.
"No, I didn’t mean… I’m not being literal."
Jack smiles. “I’d like to talk to Cas alone before I leave.”
about his reaction, about his happiness. Cas likes that it's directed towards him. He thinks he could get addicted to seeing it.
Sam barely stops for breath. “Yeah, and it wasn’t even to solve a case; we’d already taken out the ghost that was killing people. And then the goddamn adrenaline or whatever he gave me to inject him with didn’t even work, and
“Hey Cas,” Dean asked, pulling the balls from their gutter and rolling them across the table to Sam. “You ever play pool before?”
“Sorry Kevin,” Cas replied solemnly.
Castiel’s spiraling thoughts come to a halt with a realization. He fixes Naomi with a piercing glare. “You’re sowing discontent.”
Something about being in the backseat of Baby, with Zeppelin on the stereo, gave Dean a second wind. He and Cas fumbled to get their clothes off in the cramped space, but by the time the slow groove of “What Is and What Should Never Be” started, they were both naked, Cas laid out on his back across the seat, Dean kneeling over him.
, Cas types. He feels it’s important to let Claire know that his relationship with Dean isn’t some casual fling. After some consideration, Cas adds, ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍 💌💘💝💖💗💓💞💕💟❣️, hoping it will convey the depth of his emotion.
“I left you alone because I wanted to see Eileen,” Sam replies indignantly.
“He’s literally god,” Anna says, entirely unconcerned. “You think he can’t deal with it himself?”
Cas shrugged and looked abashed. "I think I would have liked to have been a more active participant.”
That was what Dean knew he ought to do. But he froze when he tried to get the words out. Instead, all he could do was ask in a broken voice, “Say that again?”
“Okay, calm down,” he reasoned with himself. “You knew this day was coming. He’s your best friend. This is just the next, logical step in the relationship.”
“Forever,” Cas repeats without hesitation. In a mirror of how Dean is holding his face, he brushes a thumb across Dean’s cheekbone and curls his fingers in his hair. “I’ll be at your side forever.”
Cas blinks and furrows his brow.
Beverly looked at him curiously.
“We were talking about what a terrible father Lucifer was,” Jack answers, with a blitheness that says he’s been matching his mother drink-for-drink. His gaze flits towards Uriel, and then slides towards Cas with a knowing gleam. “But I think we’ve exhausted that topic.”
"Of course."
“I pledge myself to you, Dean Winchester,” Cas says, voice heavy with celestial intent. “As long as you want me.”
There’s a repolarization of electrons in the air that portends Jack’s arrival. So Cas isn’t surprised when he appears in the library. Dean, however, fumbles the cutlery he’s carrying. Forks and knives clatter around his feet.
"Dean is a werewolf," Cas announces.
“I won’t,” Cas insists.
"Let me show you."
Just as Dean was starting to develop a grudging respect for Lady Gaga, the next song started. It was a bit dancier, and the lyrics struck Dean as trite, some bullshit about self-esteem; but it wasn’t terrible. Then the chorus kicked in. And the thing was, Dean
Cas suddenly feels very tired.
After they returned to the bunker a couple of days later, Dean paced around the garage.
The lights burst. Cas comes with a strangled cry.
In the past six thousand years, however, humanity has gotten more complicated, as has the task of constructing their afterlives, and as yet, few angels have risen to the challenge. There’s the swathe of heavens that Uriel has built, aglow with trauma that decomposes like radioactive elements. There’s a smattering of heavens for the orphaned, abandoned, or newly deceased children -- the kindergartens, as Inias and Samandriel have started to call them -- teeming with activity, dotting the landscape like confetti, and just as colourful. And then there are the heavens of the new generation of angels, constructed for humans very much like what they once were: an alleyway of fun parks, resort spas and upscale restaurants, shining like the Las Vegas strip.
“You have me,” Dean promises. He slides his cock next to Castiel’s, and jacks them together with one hand. He repeats, “You have me.”
“But he doesn’t
Cas knows that this has never been a perspective that Anna enjoyed.
Cas cocks his head and squints at Sam.
Cas’ voice cracks when he says, “I promise.”
Dean coughs, and claps his hands together. “We ready to roll?”
“Guys!” Sam interjected from further down the table. “Could y’all maybe cool it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Claire!” Jody exclaims, as Sam chokes on his beer.
As Dean opened his mouth to speak, he turned to look at Cas. The guy was innocently bobbing his head to the music, a gentle smile on his face. Like he didn’t have a voice in his head judging him in that moment, like he was free to just enjoy things. Dean knew that if Cas didn't have that voice telling him what was okay and what wasn’t, then Dean would have to provide it for him. That was part of the job that Dean had taken on for himself when he promised Cas that he would teach him how to be human. How to be
“Jesus
Dean grins. “Perfect! We got a plan.”
Sam picks a table by a window that offers a view of the post office. When Eileen takes her seat, he shuffles his chair closer to hers and settles his arm around her shoulders.
Cas. Want you inside. Go-
“I’ve upset you,” Cas said, low and serious. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-”
Cas’ eyes go wide in surprise.
Cas looks down at him, wide-eyed. Dean holds the base of Cas’ cock, licks a stripe up the length, circles the head with his tongue, and gently closes his lips around it. Cas whimpers, and his lips fall open in an
The bell over the shop door rings as Cas enters, but it’s a muted sound, as if the thin layer of dust that covers the merchandise weighs down sound waves as well. Most of the floor space is taken up by circular racks of clothes, crammed so full of hangers that the jackets, t-shirts and dresses push each other outwards like blossoming petals. The air smells like old cotton and faintly of sweat. The walls are lined with shelves of mismatched housewares. At the back there are milk crates full of old cassette tapes and vinyl, and that’s where Dean is, engrossed in flipping through records. Off to the side, behind a glass counter displaying knives, lighters and jewellery, a balding man flips though an army surplus mail-order magazine.
“What’re you even doing?” Kevin asked.
“Not a word, Sam,” Dean chimed in, not moving from his spot on Cas’ lap.
“Hey, hey!” Dean protests. “That monster cares a hell of a lot about you. And you care about him. What happened to
“No.” Dean shoves himself up from the table, and paces towards the doorway. “Nope, no, no.”
“I’m yours, Dean.”
Cas deadpans, “I am adventurous by nature.”
“But I want to watch!” she complains, and Cas isn’t sure how much she’s teasing, and how much she’s serious.
“I don’t think there’s anything you
“Wait, separate rooms?” Sam asked.
feel dissected, objectified, threatened, scared. He should feel disgusted too. That would be the easiest thing.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
Cas holds Dean in place with one hand on his hip. “I need to hear it,” he whispers.
Castiel doesn’t pay the other angels any mind. He stands stock-still in front of the weeping machine-gunner. He watches as the man is lifted out of the mud and into the arms of the men he’s killed, barely able to stand for sobbing so hard. But the men around him hold him up.
Jalil toddles over to his sister, and drops the hula-hoop on top of her, so that the arc of it falls across her lap. She scrunches up her eyes and frowns harder.
it feels… Dean, you feel perfect.”
“Anael, you’ve lived among humans. You understand them. You should be here, teaching other angels. Leading them.”
“Haven’t I?” Cas says, and he can’t keep the trace of knowing smugness from his voice.
girl, Claire?” Dean responds, brow furrowed but grinning, without an ounce of true defensiveness in his voice. If anything, he speaks with a glow of pride.
“Yeah,” Anna agrees. With a significant look, she adds, “Thank you.”
Cas feels a pang of worry. But Dean has always run hot and cold with his emotions.
Still with bits of grass in his hair, Jalil gracelessly drops to his knees, and wraps his arms around Aaila’s neck in a hug. With a long-suffering sigh, Aaila pushes the hula-hoop aside, and hugs her brother back.
Cas narrows his eyes. Dean is coiled with tension, a deep line between his brows and a grim frown on his lips. There’s too many emotions coming off of him to make sense of -- resentment and anger, longing and envy, shame accompanied by a fine thread of destructive cruelty, the fear of a child mixed with existential dread, all of it aimed without direction, as likely to hit Dean himself as anyone else.
Cas settled against the car door, watching Dean as he drove. “I don’t care. As long as I’m close to you.”
Dean watches in confusion as Cas gets to his feet and takes a couple of steps to stand next to Dean. He reaches for Dean’s face, murmuring, “Can I… ?”
“Are you ready?”
Dean holds Cas’ face between his palms, and demands, “You know you can’t love me like that and take it away again.”
“Stroke yourself for me.”
“Hey,” Dean prompts, nudging Cas to look at him. He looks up, face flushed and eyes glassy, both innocent and debauched. Dean thinks he could get used to Cas looking that way.
Dean is tired of fighting, of running, of freezing and starving and being scared, of doing anything but seeking comfort. He kisses Castiel and it’s not happy, it’s not painful, but it is warm.
Dean kept his eyes closed as he choked out, “Good. Sounds good.”
“What’s wrong?”
“Come with us,” Anna says, and while she’s friendly about it, it’s not a request.
Cas shifted on his feet, and scratched the back of his neck. “Well, I, uh, I wasn’t the one who suggested it. But Maureen saw us together, and was wondering, um…”
“Hello Dean.”
Dean masks his frustration with a smile and coils Cas’ tie around his hand. “Nah, come on.”
Sam's eyes slide to where Cas' hands are sorting through potatoes.
“You’d like that?” Cas asks, genuinely unsure.
He immediately spots Claire a few yards away, leaning against an erosion wall and exhaling fumes into the fading light. As he approaches, he feels as if Claire is made of barbed wire, coiled tight and razor-sharp.
“To be fair, I don’t think angels are supposed to,” Cas finally says, voice rougher than it had been, and somehow distant. “Even as a human, I’ve never had a soul.”
Cas balks, and narrows his eyes at Sam. That doesn’t sound right.
In a daze, Cas opens his eyes. He catches a glimpse of Dean’s face, raw and vulnerable, before a grin breaks across his cheeks, lighting a manic gleam in his eye.
Dean keeps watch. Every so often he runs his hand up and down Cas’ arm, or through his hair, or glances briefly at his sleeping face. And when Cas wakes and it’s Dean’s turn to sleep, the two of them hardly change positions at all.
“I couldn't. I'm sorry.”
“Good.” Maureen positioned the pink cone under her ass, and pressed a button on its side. It did, in fact, vibrate. She settled on top of it with a sigh.
Dean stays where he is.
Dean gets in his car and burns rubber, trying not to examine how he feels like he’s found something he’d lost, trying to just enjoy the satisfaction.
“Because you're God?”
“Yeah. They do,” she says.
Sam approached with an armful of dried pasta that he dumped in the shopping cart. They’d been procrastinating on restocking the bunker for a while, and decided to make up for it by buying a few months worth of food in one go.
,” Sam continued pointedly, “I found a case.”
“You could say ‘partner’--”
took them when all they ever did was live and die according to the rules set by
Hands on Cas' hips, Dean leans in to kiss him, heavy and sure, like an anchor.
“You gotta put syrup on it first.”
“The details of human life did often get lost in the bigger picture,” Cas explained. “But Dean is helping me catch up now.”
“Oh,” Cas said, still clearly confused. But he smiled anyways. “Heh.”
“Watch the road, Dean,” Sam snapped impatiently.
It’s like poetry, like a dancing fire, like an avalanche. Dean dodges and strikes and kills and feels
“I used to think I wanted to possess you,” Cas said, his voice rough and confessional. “Fill your body with my true form, feel my grace in your fingertips, my light pressing against your skin.”
Through the thin material of Dean’s pyjama pants, Cas feels Dean’s cock give a weak twitch, but otherwise remain aloof to the proceedings. It doesn’t concern Cas; after all, the first thing he and Dean did that morning was have sex, and Dean is over forty.
Cas was still beaming when he answered, “Oh Dean… ever since I knew that I loved you, I’d hoped… but I didn’t really think…”
Dean managed to just avoid choking on his coffee.
“You’re not going to build it.”
“No. Stay, please? I…”
“But it wouldn’t come for me until I let myself be truly happy. And frankly I didn’t think it would ever come to collect.”
“You want that, right?” Dean says gently. He brings a hand up to Cas’ face, traces Cas’ lower lip with his thumb. “Make me yours like no one else has. Know what it’s like inside me.”
He furrows his brow and studies Dean’s face, trying to make sense of him.
He said it so easily, it made Dean’s heart stop for a second.
“Kind of,” Dean answered, which earned him a confused look from Cas. Dean licked his lips and plowed ahead. “Actually, buddy, um, Beverly’s got a place nearby—”
He stays next to her.
“Feels good,” Dean answered, because he knew that’s what she’d want to hear. And because it was true.
It’s been several hours, and the sky is starting to darken.
“Looking at me openly. Touching me whenever you feel like it.”
“And I’m sorry that I had to stab you in the throat to keep you from killing Castiel,” Anna says brusquely.
Kaia glances around anxiously. "Should one of us, maybe, check on them?"
Castiel looks on them and can only feel joy. If nothing else, he is proud of these.
“Ya think?” Dean asks with a grin.
“Hi Beverly, I’m Dean,” he replied, with a tried-and-true lopsided smile.
Luckily, it seems to be answer enough for Anna.
Cas ignores him and reads the message on the screen.
Cas turns to Anna, and freezes, taken aback by the look on her face. She’s absolutely stricken.
“Cas! Over here!”
Dean was soon placated by Maureen coming to sit next to him. She took him in her arms, and kissed him, easy and soothing. Touching her, soft and curvy, was like coming back to home turf. She whispered to him, “You’re doing so well, Dean. You look amazing, and watching you makes me feel so good.”
Cas reaches the crux of Dean’s body, and breathes in the scent of his musk and sweat, earthy and salty. And he needs to taste, to be closer to Dean. He draws his lips gently up the shaft of Dean’s cock, exhaling against the delicate skin, and then back down. With a groan of desire he presses the flat of his tongue to the base, and licks up the length; he laves every inch of him with his tongue before closing his lips around the head and sucking.
Sam’s mouth flattened into a thin line. He closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.
“Well, I’m happy for you,” Sam says sincerely.
“Yeah.”
Benjamin takes a long, shuddering breath, and looks at Anna, pleading.
“I’m actually looking for Jack,” he says.
Cas’ brow was furrowed and his head was cocked as he glanced between Dean and Maureen. As confused as he looked, he still answered, “Yes…”
By the time that they were about to leave on the werewolf hunt a few weeks later, Dean and Cas had worked their way through Led Zeppelin’s discography, and were starting on Pink Floyd. Sometimes they didn’t listen to music, but watched movies instead, Dean’s eyes bouncing between the laptop screen and Cas' face every time there was a great line of dialogue or a cool looking shot or a plot twist.
Dean relaxed. “Yeah. We can do that.” He threw a smirk at Cas. “Hope you like being little spoon.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where do we start?” Cas asked
Dean kissed Castiel for the first time that wasn’t a performance for someone else. Pulled him close and wrapped his arms around him tight, crushed their lips together bruisingly hard, drank him in. It was a kiss that couldn’t be walked back or brushed aside, a kiss that made its intentions clear. And Cas opened to it, clinging to Dean just as tightly, giving as good as he got, eager and shameless. It was everything that Dean had been aching for without even realizing it.
Eileen is looking back-and-forth like someone watching a tennis game, reading lips intently.
Maureen rose off the bed. She went to the night stand, pulled out a bottle of lube out of the drawer, and set it on top. Then she arranged herself on her chaise again.
Sam wanted to wait before going on another hunt. Dean insisted that he was fine, that it was as if he had never been impaled at all. Sam insisted back that Dean seemed distracted, “off his game”.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not on this,” Cas says, apologetically. “Either way, I’m happy to be wherever you are.”
end up in the car?”
“Sorry I took so long,” Sam said, as he returned with a pitcher of beer and started pouring it into their pint glasses. “This place is packed.”
“Lie down,” Cas says again, and Dean does.
A bit more of Castiel’s grace evaporates with the sweat off his skin.
“Comedy, my ass,” Dean grumbled when the movie ended. If he wanted a story about messed-up father-son relationships, he’d just read the
“Shut up,” Dean muttered.
“It’s barely been over an hour, if you need more time…”
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Can we pull over at the next rest stop?”
"You’re bored?" Cas asked, tearing his attention away from the screen to look at Dean.
While the cab ride wasn’t cheap, the hotel they were staying in definitely was—an aging low-rise with a burnt-out neon sign and an out-of-service elevator. Dean and Cas sleepily trudged up the stairs, steps echoing in the stairwell. Dean decided it was time for a debrief.
He tells her gently, "It gets worse. Do you remember telling me that?" He shakes his head. "I couldn't imagine then how right you were."
“So on a scale from April to better-than-April, how did that rate?” he asked
been in love before, hasn’t he? That’s how he knows what to call his relationship with Cas (family, brothers)? But when Dean thinks of
There was no turning back from this. Now that Dean had Cas, really
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Dean says with mock grandeur, “dinner is served.”
Dean did allow himself a smile at that. “It’s different for everyone.”
“You can keep tearing through the souls of my children,” she says, and there’s something angry and vindictive under her calm exterior. “But after what you did to us, we will never let you go. You can battle through this realm for a hundred years, a thousand years, and we will
“Something up?”
He shoves Cas away; Cas lets him. Of course, out of everything that Dean feels, anger is what comes to the fore, running tense through his body as he stands.
Dean's gaze darts away. "Yeah."
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want you to look into each others’ eyes as I count down from ten,” she said, and Dean nearly laughed again. He and Cas had staring matches longer than that all the time.
And with that, Anael flies away.
, Dean had said, and at the time Castiel thought it was a prudent suggestion, but now Dean
“I’d be happy to,” Cas says. “But maybe, um, another time?”
Even now, Cas gets a swoopy feeling in his stomach when he remembers the way Damian proposed to Giannina.
“It’s actually kinda nice here,” Dean says, lagging behind to look around.
The air was cold as they left Maureen’s building. It was like stepping out of a dream, back into the waking world.
"Uh huh.” Dean watched the players break from their huddles and reposition themselves. He took a sip of beer and sighed. “Good. We'll keep watching, then."
“I can’t… I can’t take it,” Dean gasped.
They were passing through Nebraska—one-street towns with peeling paint on the storefronts and churches with prim white steeples, wide open farmland turning from green to gold in the early autumn air—when Dean switched out
"You said he-- you’d be young forever. But you don’t look like him anymore. You look old." She tells the sky, "But I guess you do still look like him, ‘cause he would've looked like this, right? If he got to get old?"
“I know,” Cas says weakly, drained from the flight. “We needed to get somewhere safe.”
Cas doesn’t mind being Dean’s model, so he shrugs the jacket on and zips it up. It’s snug where sits on his hips, and the padding feels bulky on his shoulders. He taps on Dean’s arm to get his attention.
“Yes.”
Just as Dean feels he’s about to be overwhelmed, something else cuts through. Something cold and sharp. A clinical, scientific fascination, that wraps itself around his brain and won’t let go, digging in its claws and compelling his attention. It’s followed by a sense of aesthetic appreciation that’s so aloof and objective that Dean wonders how it can coexist alongside emotions at all. But it’s soon overcome by loyalty, all-encompassing but soothing in its familiarity. Then the loyalty grows into devotion, and the devotion into worship--the kind that demands sacrifice. It keeps growing, terrifying in its weight until it’s shattered. By frustration, jealousy, betrayal, resentment, that all flash briefly together and then disappear.
say things like that in front of Jack?” Cas hisses, certain that his face is turning red.
a free heaven if we don’t build it first.”
Dean exhales, swallows, and looks up at the ceiling. “Thanks.” He takes another breath before he adds, “Claire already told you, didn’t she?”
Dean decides to give Cas what he needs to stay. That starts with acceptance and forgiveness, in the form of a plate of scrambled eggs.
“Here, let me.” Dean grabbed the caddy from Cas and glopped syrup all over the fried chicken. “Okay, now try.”
Kevin snorted. “A what?”
“I’ll stay forever.”
a normal thing that guys do with their friends.”
Dean felt his heart sink.
"Knew it!" Dean says.
He slid back, nestling his cock between her breasts and squeezing them together, teasing her nipples with his thumbs. He thrust against her chest, watched her face twist and her lips fall open in climax, felt Cas’ breath on his skin and Cas’ hand brace against his back. “You’re doing awesome.”
Cas considers telling Dean,
“Mm hm. It was… more intense. Although…" Cas paused as they reached the landing of their floor.
"Oh."
“Hello Sam. Eileen,” he says, nodding to them each in turn.
Dean felt like he could melt into the tiles, as he was engulfed in steam and heat and water. He felt slick skin sliding his own, and Maureen’s kiss.
Sam’s footsteps come to a halt. Cas can practically hear the cogs turning in Sam’s head in the hallway. And then they click. “Okay…” he says in a disquieted tone. “G’night…”
Cas shuts his eyes and clenches his jaw, and says nothing.
Cas’ eyes go wide and he makes a choked sound at the back of his throat. Anna rolls her eyes and throws her hands up. Jack raises his eyebrows and turns to Cas and Anna, looking more entertained than shocked.
Eileen brightens. "Me!"
On his knees as if in prayer, as if in praise, but his mouth is not full of words of prayer, praise doesn’t fall from his lips. Instead it’s engaged in taking Cas in, giving him pleasure. And this is holier than prayer, this is greater than worship, this is Dean on his knees Cas’ cock on his tongue like words of praise his eyes raised to Cas’ eyes as if to Heaven Cas’ hand resting on Dean’s crown as if bestowing a blessing, and Dean has given himself to Cas in so many ways already, but this, this is…

Dean hunkers down in front of his plate and digs in. As he takes a gulp of coffee, Dean watches Cas raise his fork to his mouth and take a delicate bite of the eggs. Cas nods minutely, and Dean allows himself a smile.
is a comedy, Dean,” Sam said mildly, relaxing into his chair as the movie started.
Cas nods thoughtfully, and considers how to best explain. As he thinks, he hears Dean’s voice, both far away and very close. He’s praying.
And by the end of the song, it was the easiest thing in the world for Dean to sing along, “Oh honey, tramps like us, baby we were born to run.” To turn to Cas with a smirk and a wink and a, “Come on Wendy,” and sing, as Cas ducked his head in laughter, “Tramps like us, baby we were born to run.”
Claire comes over for dinner.
Cas nods thoughtfully, then asks, "Who do you think she made it for?"
“Yes. Holy,” Cas rasps.
“Sorry!” Sam fumbles. “I just thought… I’m just… surprised. Not in a bad way!” he hastens to add. “I support you.”
She casts him a side-long glance as he leans against the wall next to her.
She nods, and shuts her eyes. After a long moment she exhales. “Thank you.”
Dean visibly chews on the inside of his cheek.
It wasn’t long after that Sam found them a case.
The way he looked at Dean in that moment, warm and calm and confident, made Dean feel sure as well. The way Cas looked at him made Dean feel like he could fall into his eyes.
Dean laughed. It occurred to him that he could teach Cas to be more subtle. But then he wouldn't be Cas anymore, and Dean loved him the way that he was.
Dean rolls his eyes. "What the hell, sure."
Dean was about to roll his eyes and tell him that it wasn’t a documentary, when Cas added with a smile, “But they were fun, yes.”
Kaia quirks an eyebrow at Claire. Claire responds with a calm smile.
“You’re not even going to try to defend yourself? No, ‘You went behind my back, Balthazar’? No, ‘It was the only way to stop Raphael’?”
Anna’s mouth tightens, her eyes shutter, and she nods. “Of course.”
Dean furrowed his brow, as he tried to place the song, but couldn’t.
Jody, Sam and Eileen have already exhausted the topic of tofu preparation and Eileen’s complaints about Sam’s eating habits by the time an awkward silence settles over the table.
Claire scoffs and takes a puff. “You gonna tell me it’s bad for my health?”
That was when Dean understood what was going on. “You think just ‘cause you’re not good at stuff right away, that you never will be.”
"I got bored waiting," Jack explains pleasantly.
One man collapses to his knees. A machine gunner. Castiel looks at him and knows that he killed hundreds. He bows his head and holds out his empty arms. His shoulders heave, and tears fall from his face to become part of the mud beneath him. A man from the other side kneels before him, and takes him in an embrace. A few paces away, the man who killed the machine gunner with a grenade stands with his arms around his comrade of three years, who died of flu after the ceasefire. Together, they meet the sixteen year-old who ran the grenadier through with a bayonet, welcoming him as a brother. Next to them, an infantryman who lost both of his legs and half of his right hand meets a soldier who wore a tin jaw to hide his shattered face until the day that he took his own life. They clasp each other’s hands, both of them whole, and smile as broadly as if greeting an old friend.
The guitar and bass dropped away, leaving only the faint patter of John Bonham’s drums, and the percussion of Dean and Cas’ bodies. Skin against skin, rhythmic gasps and moans sounding with every thrust. The drums built in volume and speed, turning frantic, relentless. Cas sighed out Dean’s name in one long syllable, lifting his hips, urging him deeper. The openness with which he wanted Dean, his shamelessness, was stunning, and it lit a fire in Dean’s core. He braced himself against the roof of the car, and gave Cas what he wanted, pounding into him. Cas’ deep moans turned into cries, and the frenzied beat of the drums turned steady, rocking. Dean could feel tension building at the base of his spine, and bit his lip, hard enough to taste blood. He wrapped a hand around Cas’ cock, gave him a few good strokes, as the drums rolled, building to the climax of the song. Cas jerked erratically in Dean’s fist, arched his back, and came with a shout, spilling over his chest, as the sound of guitar burst back over the speakers. A few more sharp thrusts, and Dean was coming too, fucking Cas through his orgasm, stopping only when his vision turned gray at the edges.
“She is,” Jack acknowledges. “But then, so are Jody and Kaia. So are Alex and Patience. What if something happens to one of them? Or to someone else that they consider family? Where does it end?”
Cas feels colour start to rise in his cheeks, and grins.
don’t make sense.”).
“You don’t always have to be working, you know,” Cas says hurriedly. “You can rest.”
He focuses on the movie.
Sam rolled his eyes. He started shoving the weapons on the card table into a bag, to be taken back inside where they’d be sharpened and cleaned. “Okay, sure, if you say so. But maybe you could teach him something useful while you’re at it?”
And Cas… he doesn’t know what to do. Dean is carrying tension in his jaw, his shoulders, his fists; and things are uneasy between him and Sam, and Cas doesn’t fully understand why. He knows it has something to do with him, but he doesn’t think he’s done anything wrong. He briefly considers going away, giving the brothers space to sort themselves out, and maybe coming back with something nice for Dean, maybe a new jacket to replace the one he stained with blood. But, Dean wants Cas to stay. He’s said so, so many times in the past days that Cas can’t do anything but believe him. He asked Cas to promise to say, and Cas did. Cas can feel the want emanating from Dean, and understands now that it’s directed at him. So he doesn’t think leaving will fix anything.
Dean's smile is still on his face, though it's wavering. "That’s a lot of people to have over for grilled cheese."
The rest of the evening passes quietly in the library. In one corner, Sam and Eileen sit next to each other, heads tilted together to watch videos on Sam's laptop. Every so often, a burst of laughter bubbles up between them.
“Good.”
Dean’s gaze flits around uneasily. He’s not certain if he sees monsters creeping through the dark or if it’s his mind playing tricks on him. He shifts nervously and reminds himself that the wards will keep the monsters at bay. He wishes he found himself more convincing.
“You really didn’t think you’d ever be happy?” Sam clarifies.
Beverly bit her lip and raised an eyebrow questioningly, twirling a strand of hair between her fingers.
Sam and Eileen look at each other. “Officially? About two months?” Sam suggests, and Eileen nods.
Cas’ hands run up and down Dean’s back, lightly scratching between his shoulder blades, caressing his sides. “I just want you, all of you.”
Cas stands by Dean’s bedroom door, waiting for him to get dressed. He glances down at his own body, at the suit and coat that he put on with a wave of his hand a few seconds ago.
The Rice Krispie mix is sticking to the wooden spoon in a giant glob, so Dean gestures for Jack to pass it over. He rolls up the sleeves of the pressed shirt he changed into, and starts spooning the mix into a tray. Then, with an adamant, "Careful not to crush it too much," he passes the spoon back to Jack.
“Thank you.”
Castiel ends each day a little more tired than the day before. Then Dean kisses him, and the touch of Dean’s lips does something to him, makes him feel things he didn’t know he could, and he doesn’t know what it means, but it must mean something. The touch of Dean’s lips breaks him apart, but he doesn’t care. Purgatory is slowly killing Castiel, but he doesn’t care.
“I need to confer with Anna,” Cas says. “We’ll catch up.”
Dean shoots him a questioning look. Cas would squeeze his hand in comfort, but both his hands are resting on the table at the moment, and Cas is sure that Dean wouldn’t appreciate such a public display.
He whispers,
Cas gets to his feet and shrugs. “It doesn’t matter to me.”
The ten seconds lasted longer than Dean had thought. But they did end. And Maureen asked, “Cas, can you tell Dean something good about tonight?”
Cas frowns. Sam has taken Jeshua ben Josef’s name in vain three times now, and while Cas does not care about the blasphemy, he does think it’s an over-reaction. “I know loss hits Dean hard, but he does
Dean clapped his hands together. “Cas, ever gone wolf hunting before?”
With Jack gone, Balthazar has recovered his confidence, though with less bravado. He glares at Cas flatly, and doesn’t say anything.
Cas smiles at him and watches him disappear back into the mouth of the bunker, with one more backwards glance at Cas.
Every weapon Dean wields feels wrong in his hands. The only things that could hurt the souls of purgatory were Castiel and the angel blade. Even though Dean doesn’t use the blade anymore, he hasn’t given it back to Cas.
Beverly and Cas sat on the edge of her bed. She leaned with her back to his chest, as he dragged his teeth along her neck and sucked marks into her skin, one of his hands caressing her breasts, the other trailing his fingers up her inner thigh, along the lips of her cunt, and then back down to her knee again. She sighed in pleasure, and Dean smiled, pleased. Then he realized he was the only one who was still dressed.
Richard picks up the toy, and stands to fling it back towards the game.
As the discussion slides into neutral territory, Cas notices the expression of increasingly grim concentration on Jack's face.
Though he didn’t hear her say it, he was sure that Maureen had told him to.
for reference. Especially "Moby Dick".
Dean is self-aware enough to realize that he doesn’t like the sound of Cas questioning his feelings. But he stops short of considering why.
“Yeah, good,” Dean mumbles.
In fact, Dean was a little offended on his friend’s behalf that Beverly was eyeing Dean so eagerly, when Cas was
“Wanna watch TV?”
Then, to Dean’s shock, Castiel sinks to his knees in front of him.
Dean pulls Claire into his arms next, squeezing her fiercely for a brief moment before letting her go.
, Sam.”
“You too,” Cas says, with what might be a bit too much sincerity.
Dean grinned. “Well rack ‘em up.”
And yeah, Dean had been there, with that chick in Austin, when Dean could barely keep his eyes on the road long enough to get them back to the motel in time.
Dean doesn’t answer.
want that, Dean?” she whispered. It was either her breath on Dean’s ear, or the question itself, that sent a shiver down his spine.
Cas eases down, covers Dean's body with his own, lies on top of him. Dean sighs, and Cas can feel the contentment all down the length of him. He nuzzles Dean’s neck, and smiles against his skin.
“Fuck,” Dean muttered into Cas’ hair.
Dean’s gaze falls to the ground. "’Night," he mutters, and stalks away.
Castiel turns to look, and Dean sees his shoulders sag defeatedly. A few seconds later, though, the angel draws himself to attention, posture ramrod-straight and soldier-like. Dean allows himself to feel a bit of relief. Seeing his friend’s old behaviours and mannerisms resurface has been Dean’s one source of comfort since they found themselves in Purgatory.
The thing was, since Chuck had been defeated, Dean
Dean gasps, “Holy… Cas...”
Dean is still muttering
Cas assures Dean that whatever it was is long gone.
," he hears Claire say, a tremor of irritation in her voice. "
"Yeah,” Cas agrees. “It would."
He crossed paths with Cas on his way into the store to pay for gas, and snagged his sleeve. “By the way, Sam switched seats. You’re up front with me.”
Dean brings his lips close to Cas', the ends of their noses brushing against each other. "Everything you thought it’d be?"
,” Dean said. Then he caught sight of the spare sawed-off at the back of the trunk, and remembered that he hadn’t cleaned it yet. He grabbed the gun and chucked it on the table. “Second, that’s not what this is about. Cas needs to know how to get by in the world. He needs someone to teach him how to just be a

Cas shrugs back.

Inias looks around at the other angles, seeming entirely lost. “Yes?”
"I know," he says instead, voice soft. "I got the texts you sent when I… when I was dead."
"Hey, Cas," Dean says.
Cas turns his attention to Claire, though under the table he trails his fingers across Dean’s knee, in what he hopes is a soothing gesture. And sure enough, as Claire tells her story, he feels Dean begin to relax.
With a growl deep in his throat, Cas swings Dean over onto his back. He covers Dean’s body with his own so they’re touching thigh to chest; laces his fingers with Dean’s and presses his hands next to his head.
“Come on, the dude’s had more important things to focus on right?” Dean interjected. As he got up from the table to refill his coffee, he glanced towards Cas for confirmation.
Cas looks to Sam, hoping for him to change the subject. Instead, Sam just raises his eyebrows as if to say,
Cas withdraws his fingers and lowers Dean’s hips onto the bed. He closes his fingers in a tight ring around the base of Dean’s cock, kisses his thigh, kisses his abdomen. Dean’s muscles tremble under his lips.
It could have been the fact that Cas was hitting Dean’s prostate with every thrust now that made him cry out Cas’ name, made his arms fall away and claw at the sheets even as he longed to pull Cas closer. But Dean knew that it was the words washing over him, spinning in his head. Dean thought,
Dean raises his eyebrows expectantly and waits.
"Alright, curses aren't part of the game play. Unfortunately," Eileen says. She gets to her feet. "And it's night time. Everyone close your eyes."
’s and
In Purgatory they find an empty cabin with a packed-earth floor, a half caved-in roof and a hearth where Dean lights a fire without thinking. Dean has been too tired for too long to think about what he’s doing.
“Like Anna murdering me,” Uriel adds bitterly.
Jalil does nothing of the sort. He keeps hold of the hoop, jumping up and down with excitement and laughing.
Dean leans into Cas harder, tongue thrusting into his mouth, teeth scraping his lips, until Cas has to brace himself on the table to keep from falling out of his chair.
And Dean is about to get up, he is. He plants his hands on either side of him to push himself off the ground, but his muscles ache in protest. He’s tired. Not just from the past night, but from everything. He’s tired, and he’s lonely.
Dean said, clutching at the silk sheets under his hands. “Please don’t stop, please,
“Are we switching teams?” Cas asked as Dean strode towards him.
At the sound of the garage door swinging open and footsteps echoing across the concrete, Dean spun around.
Every now and then Maureen would pipe in with instructions. To take their jackets off. For Cas to take off Dean’s shirt. For Cas to undo Dean’s belt and push off his jeans. For them to get on the bed. Dean enjoyed the sound of her approval after every step, but he was starting to get annoyed at being nearly naked, while Cas was still entirely clothed. The whole point of the navy t-shirt was so that ladies could tell that Cas was cut, and yet, here they were -- Cas’ hands sliding up Dean’s bare chest, pressing hot against the skin of his back, ghosting across his thighs; while Dean still had to put up with denim and cotton.
“Cool,” Dean said. He found his toothbrush, and headed towards the bathroom. “So, pick a side. And no spooning, y’hear?” Dean tossed a wink over his shoulder and shut the bathroom door behind him.
Cas began to draw back, but Dean curled his fingers tighter in his hair.
Cas thinks that if he had known that hanging his coat in Dean’s room would have earned him that look, he would have done it long ago.
Dean bit his lip to keep himself from doing or saying anything. To keep from acting on the voice that sounded like John, screaming,
Castiel reaches the spot where he saw the shapes, but no one is there.
to stay, don’t you? You want me?”
“How do you even know it’s a bad thing, Dean?” Sam asked one day in the library.
Cas is dimly aware of the sound of Eileen clapping. Most of his attention, however, is taken up by Dean angling his head and urging his lips open with his tongue.
“Out of everything I’ve seen, you know, this is one of the weirdest,” Claire finally says, and there’s no mistaking the bitterness in her tone. “You guys acting like you’re all normal. Like some kinda Stepford gays.”
“Racism isn’t a joke, Dean,” Cas said, deadly serious.
“What?” he snaps, and he can’t even look at her. “What are you going to say, Anna? That you agree with her, but I should keep trying anyway?”
Cas would really prefer to go to Dean. But Sam is looking at him with that serious, sincere, open expression of his.
“Dean, you know I’m right here.”
Maureen turned on a tap outside the stall, and columns of shower heads that lined the walls burst with water. Dean glanced towards Cas, reflexively, to catch his reaction, to see if he was just as impressed and delighted as Dean was. Cas met his gaze, and smiled. It felt easy for Dean to smile back.
Dean goes wide-eyed and pale. His eyes dart nervously between Sam and Eileen, and Cas.
All the softness in Anna’s face falls away as she stands. She nods to Cas in acknowledgement, and they rejoin Jack and Balthazar together.
Death was the only thing that separated them. They searched for each other in Purgatory until they were reunited. They are sisters in death, in eternity.
Cas withdrew his fingers, and Dean whimpered at the loss. His eyes were closed, but he could feel Cas’ gaze on him.
“I don’t know.”
He watches Kaia tear the corners off of her napkin. He catches her eye, and smiles kindly. Kaia smiles back.
The walls of the bunker are thick, but not thick enough to block sound from travelling to an angel down the hall. Cas tries to respect the Winchesters’ privacy, but sometimes they’re just loud. Like they are now.
“Relax. Socialize,” Cas suggests.
Dean nods. “Cool. I’m gonna make scrambled eggs. Want some?”
Dean’s mouth hangs open in invitation; his eyes look up at Cas, wide and dilated; his thighs flex around Cas’ hips.
Cas flinches anxiously. Balthazar is overestimating Jack’s tolerance for lying and mockery.
Typically, Dean would have a beer or three before bed, just to relax. He hadn’t gone so far as to drink himself to sleep for months. The night after they got back from Ohio, he opened a bottle of scotch and didn't stop drinking until he passed out.
"Relax, sweetheart,” Beverly purred to Cas. “Let me take care of you."
“I want to love you completely,” Cas says, as if he’s confessing all over again. “I want all of you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He watches the pattern that the spatula makes as he drags it through the slowly solidifying eggs, and realizes that Cas actually makes
"I can tell you what Heaven was," Cas says.
“Hello!” Jack says, with a raised hand and a pleased tilt to his smile.
It’s the last thing Cas expects to hear, and all he can say in response is, “Talk about what?”
She led Dean and Cas to her bedroom. The walls were a deep, velvety red, except for the one across from the entrance, which was entirely mirrored, reflecting the warm dim light that came from wall fixtures. The bed was decked in black silk sheets, with large airfoil-shaped pillows. Between the bed and the mirrored wall there was a leather-upholstered chaise lounge, shaped in a swooping s-curve: high in the back, dipping in the middle, and rising again in the front. Dean glanced up -- the ceiling was mirrored too.
They clear out the building, honeycombed with apartments (and Dean thanks whoever’s listening for the fact that it’s been months since Cas last rambled on about bees), and choose the least decrepit one to spend the night.
He hears a clicking, a whining from the shadowy archway. He turns.
Dean forced himself not to care.
He leans in, tasting Cas' lips, the tip of his tongue darting and caressing. Cas raises his hand to the back of Dean’s neck just as Dean pulls away.
Claire glares at him. “No. Don’t.”
And as he sat in the car, he felt exhausted at the prospect of having to keep grasping for another day.
Cas hovers with one foot in the car and the other on the ground.
“Talk to me about what?” Dean asked, trying not to show too much concern.
“Maybe you’re giving them what they need. What they never got on Earth,” Cas continues. He turns to the angels at his side, his gaze sliding from Jack, to Inias, to Anna. “Safety, and time.”
Dean moved closer to pick his flannel up off the floor, and shrugged it on over his t-shirt.
Castiel looks at Dean, and thinks that lying down next to him and never moving again wouldn’t be a bad thing.
“When you think about it, what’s the difference between an endless day of playing with toys, and just reliving their happiest memories?” Anna asks. “Either way, they’re in a state of stasis.”
"It’s second-hand," Cas explains defensively.
Castiel stands at his side and watches, fingers tracing a line up and down Dean's bicep as the phone rings.
As always, Cas is struck by Dean’s form. Muscular, but soft around the middle, freckles scattered across his shoulders. By human standards he’d be considered strong, but Cas can only see how delicate and breakable he is, and how much in need of comfort.
Now, however, he’s beginning to understand the appeal.
Dean startled, and turned around with a muttered curse. Sam snickered.
“Sorry,” Sam apologizes quickly.
For a brief moment, Dean thought that he couldn’t
Dean already had condoms in his wallet, so he just dug a bottle of lube out of his duffle bag, and stuck it in his pocket. He grabbed his jacket, and turned to Cas, who was standing in the same spot with a puzzled look on his face.
Cas reared back, and when Dean’s eyes fluttered open he was fixed by Cas’ gaze, wide and glazed over with bliss, inhuman in its focus.
. He says
Ultimately, while there’s a lot of clothes to choose from, the variety is limited. Cas finds himself some work boots; a pair of heavy, straight-cut jeans, and a handful of t-shirts promoting various farm implements and local insurance providers.
as a guy."
Plant sang, with that hint of a wail that he always had on the high notes, voice stretching over the bluesy melody.
Dean grins when he sees Cas and Claire returning to the library, incisors-wide, anxiety and relief rolling off of him in equal measure.
“Huh?”
He decides the lie is worth it when he sees Dean’s smile return.
“Ugh!” Kevin grumbled, slapping the coin into Dean’s outstretched palm. “I swear, since Cas moved in, you’ve gotten even more obnoxious.”
“On a regular basis,” Sam clarified.
By this point, Dean has smudges of yellow on his forehead and cheeks, and flecks of blue in his hair. When Mary dabs some red on his nose, he erupts in giggles. Dean reaches out with a chubby blue hand, and Mary leans down to let him paint her nose in return. He giggles again, as if there's never been anything funnier than his mother's paint-smeared face.
“Tell me how he looks.”
“Let’s go,” Cas grumbles, shaking his head. He looks around for the exit.
As it turned out, meeting a woman wasn’t that hard. As Dean predicted, all Cas needed to do was stand somewhere visible, flash those guns and those baby blues, and then let Dean’s charm do the rest.
“Pfft, no!” Sam shrugs in a poor attempt at acting casual. “This isn’t weird at all. Why would it be weird? It’s perfectly normal to be gay.”
A heavy silence falls between them.
she placates. “But, Cas, what kind of point of reference do you have?”
There’s a hug from Sam, and a story from Jack, told around the kitchen table. As far as Dean is concerned, these are distractions.
Cas thinks, all things considered, it’s not the worst way that conversation with Claire could have gone. Still, he knows Claire is a complex person, who often uses humour as a shield. So he takes out his phone, types,
“Oh.”
“For starters, it would tell me that I at least died for a good reason. That this all means something, and I’m not just a toy you broke in a tantrum and glued back together.”
Dean felt suddenly warm. He stepped away from Cas, cleared his throat and pointed towards the mirror, encouraging Cas to check himself out.
“Nah,” Dean answered. He ticked his head towards the back seat, where Cas sat slouched over and lightly snoring. “Let the guy sleep, he’s earned it.”
“She started it!”
“I want to feel you in me,” Cas says.
From his new position, Dean couldn’t help but look in the mirror, at the picture he and Cas made: Dean open and vulnerable, Cas encircled around him. Then Cas thrust into him, hitting his prostate, and Dean broke his own gaze, tossing his head back with a moan. Cas captured his lips in a heated kiss. The only thing Dean was looking at when he came was Cas’ eyes.
Into nurturing and sustaining the people he cares about. Cas wants to be sustained by Dean.
He wraps his arms around Cas to hold him in place, and the angel nods off again almost immediately. His hair is soft against Dean’s cheek, but Dean doesn’t think about that. He doesn’t miss having a fire anymore, because Cas is warm and heavy.
"Where else would I go?" Cas asks.
“There you go.” Sam gives Cas an encouraging smile. “I’m real happy for both of you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After the song ended, Dean and Cas got dressed, and Dean was relieved at how easy the silence between them was.
From above, Heaven casts a gentle glow. Most of the rebuilt heavens shine with summer sun or autumn bonfires. The first generation angels gravitate towards them, the ones that are easy to design. To be fair, they make up the vast majority of the angels' work, as they hold the vast majority of humanity -- the first two hundred thousand years of tribal people, nomads, early farmers. In their heavens the harvests are good, the hunting is plentiful, the earth full of bounty  and it’s a time of feasting and festivals. There is food, and music, and games, and people gathered. Not only from neighbouring villages or sister tribes, but from across generations. Souls sit, as youths, at the feet of their ancestors, and listen to their stories; and then they turn, as elders, to look on the faces of their children’s children’s children with joy and pride. There’s a sense of community, of family in these heavens that has nothing to do with the angels’ constructions.
when he answered, “In my limited experience as a human… yes, I think so.”
"Careful," Sam says. "He already barely lets anyone else use the kitchen. I don’t wanna see what happens when he’s encouraged."
“Talk to me,” Cas says, voice low and rasping.
“I’m an angel, I can keep myself from achieving sexual climax for as long as I want."
“Anna, are you--”
The white wash is flaking off the walls where they aren’t covered in creeping plants, and the leaded windows are dark. Dean and Cas circle the exterior - there are no signs of activity.
Cas freezes, the spike of Dean’s anxiety pinning him in place.
. “Man, I’m telling ya: open highway, windows down, Zepp on the stereo. There’s nothing like it.”
Cas feels Dean’s eyes on him, and tries not to give anything away.
Cas squinted at Dean. “... I just thought you should know?”
Sam stood silhouetted in the light of the bonfire. It’s heat didn’t reach Dean. When the fire finally burned out, and Sam walked back to the car, Dean pretended to be asleep.
Cas smiled proudly. “I brought a tape.”
“I’m glad this happened,” Dean echoed, as he searched for the words to say what he felt. “I’m glad we shared this. You’re my best friend, and I…”
“Yes,” Cas said.
Castiel knows that the monster souls can’t die in Purgatory, so maybe the same is true of him? But Castiel is neither a soul nor a monster. Perhaps his Father intervened again, though Purgatory is not His realm.
Dean decides to make an effort. To live. Because it’s what Cas would have wanted. Even though the phrase
Cas sighs. “You know, if I didn’t know better, I’d say you took after your father.”
Cas passes the cigarette back to Claire with a frown.
Cas kisses Dean, hard.
Finally, he couldn’t take it any more. Trying to keep it casual, Dean picked up a box of ammunition, flipping the lid and shaking it around to determine if they needed more silver bullets, and asked, “Hey Sam, what did Kevin mean when he said I've been ‘obnoxious’? What's that all about?”
So he took it out on the nearest target. Said something about how,
A spike of worry rockets through Cas. It’s not a conscious prayer, but the feeling forms words, almost of its own volition.
Cas’ gaze flits across Dean’s features, like Dean is a puzzle that can be solved by looking at it. He’s tentative in his looks and his touch, as if any movement could shatter the moment between them.
Dean waves him off. “Nah, it’ll be fun. It’ll be great,” he says without enthusiasm.
“I don’t understand what’s so funny,” Cas said quizzically. “That’s what we were talking about.”
“Hey Jack,” Anna says, “weren’t you going to introduce me to your mom?”
Cas shoots Jack a reproachful look, but Jack just shrugs innocently.
Dean took a breath and tried to muster as much dignity as possible. “Look, if it’s good enough for Clarence Clemons, it's good enough for me.”
“Yeah,” Dean breathes in between kisses. “Yeah, let’s hit the town.”
Cas opens his mouth to speak, and for a moment Dean thinks he’s going to say it. Instead, Cas hesitates, meeting Dean’s demanding gaze with a searching one.
Dean returns from the kitchen and starts passing out beers. Cas is about to share his verdict on dessert, but before he can, Claire is speaking.
“Guys! Just five more minutes!” Sam pounded on the door again.
"Cas?” he hears faintly, as if through water.
"It’s nothing," Dean insists. "There’s no problem. I was overreacting. It doesn’t matter."
Gabriel takes the toothpick out of his mouth, and flicks it away. It lands perfectly in the martini glass in the waitress’ hand. He regards Cas seriously. “That a free Heaven means they can do whatever they want.”
Dean nods more firmly in assent. “Alright, then.” He pushes the door open.
“Those souls will eventually find closure,” Cas explains, with considerably more patience than he’d started the day with. “And when they do they’ll want to return home.”
“Today was good,” he says contentedly.
“Eight ball, side pocket,” Cas announced, and sank the shot with practiced ease.
flows from Dean’s lips, high-pitched panting, broken up by long guttural cries. Cas curls over his back, straining to get deeper, closer, knowing that he can’t but trying anyway.
Dean doesn’t think about what would have happened had he gotten stuck in Purgatory by himself. He doesn’t think about getting up and making his way through those woods alone. Or about the exhaustion, or the cold, or the loneliness. He doesn’t.
The emergency lights come on, red and pulsing.
Something about the question made Dean’s smile slip.
As soon as a table opened up, Dean was striding over and feeding quarters into the coin slot before any hipsters had the chance to claim it.
"Cas?” Dean asks, voice already sleep-thick. “What's 'Hosanna' mean?"
Kelly smiles to herself.
"You haven’t rebuilt it yet," Cas comments when he finds Jack there.
“… ache.”
“Yeah.”
“Still,” Uriel insists, and for a moment all his defensive haughtiness is gone. “I am sorry.”
He thinks back to Cas’ most human wants, the ones that hollowed him out with longing and buoyed him with warmth. Dean lets that warmth shine out of his eyes and colour his voice.
Cas leads Anael through a series of heavens. A massage parlour with glossy-skinned attendants, the couture section of a Saks Fifth Avenue, a restaurant with gold-leafed wagyu on the menu. They end up on a broad, brick-paved avenue, lined with pastel-coloured shops and leading to a half-scale castle.
been helping,” Anna shrugs mildly. “We made the rounds, I introduced him to everyone. Then Uriel asked if Jack could join him in the heaven he’s working on, and Jack went.”
he remembers her telling him.
“Then tell me,” Dean says.
Dean’s failures aside, there was still a list of movies that he had promised Cas they’d get through. And hell, he could still kick back and relax with the guy, right?
“Cas, hey,” he says, soft and syrupy. Dean coils his arms around Cas’ neck. He turns the two of them around and walks backwards until his back hits the door. Dean pulls Cas closer, so Cas is pinning him against the door, cants his hips, and ducks his head to murmur against Cas’ skin.
Cas rolls his eyes and is about to sign something back, when he’s distracted by a tap on his shoulder. He looks up to see Dean standing above him.
“You’re wrong,” Anna says, and Cas feels like they’re comrades-in-arms again.
you…” Cas releases Dean’s hand, and strokes his face.
He hears Cas get up and follow him. Dean closes his eyes, and silently counts to five as he inhales.
an all hands on deck situation!” Cas insists.
Sam sends Cas a sympathetic look. Cas doesn’t acknowledge it.
"Can I ask you a theological question, Castiel?"
, he remembers. He shakes his head as if doing so will clear the magic away.
Cas’ eyebrows come together, his mood suddenly tipping from arousal into concern. “Dean…”
Cas was holding his head high and there was a pleased curve to his mouth, so Dean knew that he was happy with his performance too.
Dean turns to the stove, and Cas watches the roll of his shoulder as he ladles batter onto a hot pan. He thinks about food -- as nourishment, as a thing that’s shared, as a symbol of community and caring. And Cas knows that, imperceivable flavours or not, he would gladly eat anything that Dean gives him.
Castiel tenses. His gaze tracks Eve as she paces along the border of the campsite, not passing through the wards that he’d drawn on nearby trees. He takes a few slow, deliberate steps to stand between her and Dean.
He licks his lips, and notices Cas’ gaze drop to track the movement. Dean licks his lips again, slowly, leaving them wet and glossy. He lets his mouth hang open invitingly for a moment, waiting to hear a small hitch in Cas’ breath, before he continues.
tastes bitter in his mouth. Cas didn’t get what he wanted. For his part, Dean doesn’t know if he’ll even able to want things anymore.
“You’re not gonna,” Dean insists. “How do I prove that to you?”
he cuts himself off, an aborted blasphemy. “Fuck me, Cas, please, please,
By the time Dean has braced himself, he and Cas are already across. Cas wobbles on his feet.
He watched Cas work, felt Paula writhe against him, heard her moan in his ear. Cas’ eyes slid up to watch Paula’s reaction, pupils blown wide under dark lashes. His gaze met Dean's.
"Hello Claire," he says gently.
"And I’m one of them."
“Leave the stubble,” Dean said as he left the bathroom, and pulled his dark red button-down out of his duffle bag. Red was a sexy colour, always a hit with the ladies.
Cas frowns.
“What’s wrong with my outfit?” Cas asks.
it. He wants to be able to take whatever Dean can give him.
“Dean,” Cas ventures, grasping for the right thing to say, “you know we don’t have to go.”
“What’s so funny?” Cas asks, pressing his lips to Dean’s ribs, one by one.
The angels watch the children play around them, with four different contemplative gazes.
At some point, Cas’ hands had moved to Beverly’s hips, and he must have undone her jeans, because he was soon pushing them down. The next moment, much to Dean’s surprise, he dropped to his knees with frankly astounding eagerness.
Claire stands in front of Cas, warily looking him up and down.
Castiel cocks his head, confused. “We don’t have a deal, Dean.”
together.”
Dean’s gaze slides over to meet his, and holds it, the bashfulness falling away. There’s a spark of desire laced through with possessiveness in that look, the feeling striking Cas clearly. Castiel’s heart might not need to beat, but it beats faster now.  Dean pulls his lower lip between his teeth and lets it go, pink and shining.
“Stay still,” Dean says.
Hosanna in the highest.
Uriel shrugs, abashed. “You were my brother. And I did want you to join us. I was angry that your faith in God was so strong after it was so clear that he had abandoned us.” He purses his mouth, and adds, “You chose him over me.”
It feels so inadequate.
“Better. Best.”
“But you’re not researching.”
“I actually have a plan,” Dean ended up saying.
Dean circles his arms around Cas' waist, eyes flitting over his face, soft and fond.
Eileen rolls her eyes.
, followed by,
Dean shivers at that, closing his eyes and swallowing.
Dean felt the bed shift as Cas got up, heard his footsteps as he walked towards the door.
“Dean,” Cas places a hand on his shoulder, but Dean twitches reflexively away.
“I just need a quick cigarette,” Claire says. In response to Kaia’s look of curious concern, she smiles reassuringly, and then heads towards the door.
Dean huffed an uneasy laugh. “No, before that.”
Dean hit the floor on his back, the floorboards collapsed, and he kept falling.
For the first time in months, Dean felt a twinge of frustration at Cas’ cluelessness, instead of his normal amusement. He did his best to repress the feeling, and said, “Because he’s black.”
“Just stop, okay?” Dean says.
They wave goodbye to Jack, and wander off.
“Ready for adventure!” Eileen says, winking at Sam. She slides into the backseat.
Dean was a lot more direct in his approach. “Okay, Cas, listen here,” he said firmly. He knew that Cas had gotten a lot better about being bad at stuff after the firing range, but this was too important to give Cas the chance to get frustrated and give up.
“He looks goddamn pretty,” was all Dean could think to say. Cas hummed against his cock, sending vibrations up his spine.
Dean actually
“--I just answered an ‘All hands on deck’ call,” she steamrollers on, “and now I’m stuck!”
sense now. Now that Dean knows what proportion of him is human, or at least comparable to human. Now that he knows the kinds of things that Cas feels, it’s like pieces of a puzzle falling into place, completing a picture that Dean had only seen fragments of before. Going to war with Raphael and the deal with Crowley, staying in Purgatory, his immediate commitment to Jack. None of it is discordant with Dean’s image of Castiel anymore. And all the times that Cas had left to go off on his own, those make sense too. A kind of sense that Dean hates, because it still took Cas away from him; but the drive to protect, the single-mindedness, is something that he can get his head around.
Cas opens his eyes a slit and looks up at Dean. “Will you make me pancakes again?”
Wendy stepped away from Dean, and he let her go easily. She walked up to Cas.
Dean feels split open in every way. He doesn’t know how, but he’s sure that every emotion he’s ever had must be on display for Cas, the same way Castiel opened himself to Dean the previous night. And yet somehow, Cas doesn’t recoil. Instead, he murmurs about how Dean is
Dean smirks at Claire. “Yeah, I’ve been getting a lot of exercise lately, if you know what I mean.” He curls his hand in a loose fist and wags it up and down.
“I think I can find a way to appreciate the taste,” is what Cas is planning to say, but the next thing he knows, Dean is sliding his hand into Cas' hair, crowding up against him and crushing their lips together, rough and messy.
With a triumphal “Alright, then!” Dean heads over to join Cas at the kitchen table, two plates of food balanced on one arm, and two cups of coffee in the other. Cas starts to get to his feet to help, but Dean shakes his head. He’s grinning, so Cas assumes that struggling with delivering food to table is part of whatever dining experience Dean is trying to create. He manages successfully enough, only spilling a small amount of coffee along the way. Dean sets the plates down, a pile of bacon, eggs, and pancakes for himself, and a neat stack of silver-dollars for Cas.
For the first time with Cas, Dean wasn’t thinking about what looked good, or how to put on a good show. He was just thinking about Cas, and how he wanted him, how he wanted to take his time. He wanted to spend time on the spot where Cas’ neck curved towards his shoulder blade, curling over him to get the right angle. He wanted to spend time on the crease of Cas’ hips, walking his lips up his side along to the rambling guitar riff of “Lemon Song”. He wanted to kiss the spot under Cas’ ribs where it would tickle if Dean wanted to break the mood, but with his tongue and hot breath, Dean made Cas twitch and shiver instead. He wanted to trail his lips down the inside of Cas’ forearm, mouth at his wrist, kiss his palm, take his fingers in his mouth and suck on them, making Cas’ hips cant up and his dick twitch in anticipation. So those were the things that he did.
“No, it’s making fun of racist people,” Dean explained. “It’s satire.”
When Dean speaks he’s breathless, like the wind’s been knocked out of him. “You’re kidding me.” The corner of his mouth twitches up, some defensive reflex telling him to smile, like it’s all a joke to him anyways.
It’s partly to silence his own thoughts, and partly to explain his shell-shocked reaction that Dean says, “I didn’t even think that angels could feel stuff like that.”
“Ugh, that sounds stupid,” Dean grumbles. “But yeah. Cas is… my boyfriend.”
“Oh, I was talking about Beverly,” Dean corrected, with a grin that said he knew exactly what kind of reaction he was about to get from his brother. “She really tuckered him out.”
“Should probably get a couch one of these days,” Dean says, shoving one of the recliners so it’s right up against the other.
Despite waking up not long ago, Dean is on the very edge of sleep. Soft and comfortable, vulnerable and trusting, Cas feels the urge to dive inside of him, to cover and consume him. To nestle next to his soul and stay there for eternity.
“Okay.” Dean stares at him sideways. “You can be a real weirdo sometimes, you know that?”
“I guess it is,” Sam says. He squeezes Eileen’s arm affectionately. “We’ve been showing Eileen around town.”
He looks down, and sees his daughter, staring up at him with wide brown eyes, her red hair shining in the afternoon light. She raises her arms and makes grabby-hands at him.
“I suppose I did.”
. Dean thinks about those words so that he doesn’t have to think about
A smile curves Cas' mouth, small and close-lipped, the one that only Dean seems to bring out of him.
The dazed look on Cas’ face as Dean leads him towards his bedroom is almost comical. Dean can practically see the cartoon hearts dancing around Cas’ head, and bites his tongue to keep from laughing. It crosses his mind that Cas is going to look at him like that for the rest of his life, full of devotion and wonder, and he can’t help the giddiness that bubbles in his chest. He’s going to keep Cas.
Dean has gone back to the menu, though he reads it with an unfocused gaze. “It’s just me and Cas, Sam, you don’t gotta roll out a friggin’ rainbow parade.”
When Sam, Dean and Cas stopped for lunch the next day on the drive back to the bunker, Cas didn’t look at Dean any differently. He didn’t behave any differently when he took a cursory look at the menu before asking Dean what he should order. But still, Dean couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed.
Dean takes Castiel’s coat and spreads it on the ground, and rolls up his own as a place to rest their heads. He pulls the angel down to lay with him the firelight.
“Well, we’ve seen
Sam and Eileen are leaning against the Impala in the garage.
Cas insists that Dean let him help with
He felt Cas’ body tremble beneath him, and it was a moment before Dean realized it was with laughter.
"Of course not." Cas lets his gaze drift over Dean’s face, every precious slope and angle. "I did something wrong, and I didn’t know how to fix it."
Dean grins. "Awesome."
"I’m sorry--" Cas says, because it seems like a better response than asking what specific lie Claire’s referring to.
“Right.”
Blindly, Cas pulls a book off the shelf, sits down, and lets it fall open. He stares at the random page, and reminds himself of Eileen’s advice.
“It was good to see you laugh,” Cas explained.
"You know, if you ever need me, all you have to do is pray. Even if you just need someone to pay for your french fries." Cas tries for a smile again.
Cas straightens up in his chair when he sees them. “Hello.”
Cas froze.
Cas tries for a smile, gentle and understanding. Claire doesn't smile back, but he can see some of the tension ease off of her.
Cas would feel frustrated if he thought he had any right to be. But he can’t help insisting, “And it
, and Cas’ gaze goes heavy-lidded and seductive.
It’s getting harder and harder for Dean to ignore the part of his brain that’s telling him,
Cas continues to watch Dean askance. And then he realizes.
“Oh! Almost forgot…” Dean snaps his fingers and springs back towards the kitchen counter. When he sits down again, it’s with an armful of condiments.
"No," Benjamin admits.
Hester balls her hand into a fist and makes a weak punching gesture. “Working hard.”
“Oh. Good. Nice.”
"What the hell happened?” Dean asks.
“And if we bring a chick back here, it’s better to have one big bed than two small ones, y’know?”
Castiel looks at them and knows their story, as he knows all the souls in Purgatory.
Dean backs up, pulling Cas along with him, not breaking the kiss, until his legs hit the edge of the map table. He sits on the table, and Cas dips his head to keep kissing him, until Dean wraps his legs around Cas’ thighs and pulls him close. Cas groans at the increased pressure against his growing erection, as Dean pulls back from the kiss to draw his teeth across Cas’ neck and bite gently at his skin. Cas leans forward, one hand on the table keeping him propped upright, the other curled tightly in Dean’s hair. His breath is rough in Dean’s ear, and he grinds against Dean’s hip.
“You’re joking, right?” She says indignantly. “I had a life there!”
Cas hears Dean’s next prayer as a chill runs through him.
"Very much so," Cas says. He studies the different shades of green in Dean’s eyes, wondering if there's names for all of them. "Today was a good day."
“Cas?”
Dean takes a breath, clenches a fist against Cas’ back. He feels like he’s gotten away with making a crossroads deal without paying any price.
Cas collects himself, and straightens his tie around his open collar.
A smile breaks across Cas’ face. “You love me,” he says with a hitched breath, almost a laugh, almost disbelieving.
“Ha! Go team werewolf!” Dean exclaims. He reaches across the table to ruffle Jack’s hair triumphally.
This time, it’s Castiel who stops.
Dean couldn’t really question her judgement there. Cas did look awfully good that night, in jeans and a blue button-down from his Fed getup, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. After he’d gotten the hang of pool he was all steely determination and confident movements, tempered by a lightweight tipsy grin that gave him a quirky kind of warmth. The guy’s only sexual experience so far had ended with him nearly getting stabbed to death, so Dean was loathed to deny him a round two. He might have suggested that Beverly take Cas home on her own, because Dean was selfless and a good friend like that. But the idea of being there with Cas, showing him the ropes, and making sure that this time was everything that it should be for him, seeing his reactions during the best parts… the idea made his stomach roll over and his heart flutter in his chest, but it didn’t suck.
Cas rolls his eyes before he can stop himself.
“Can I try that?”
But there was another part of him that heard “I love you” and it felt like a lyric from his favourite song. The part of him that had beamed at Cas, riding shotgun in Baby, as they sailed down a Nebraska highway, belting out, “Tramps like us, baby we were born to run.” That part of him wanted to sing
Cas stayed rooted to the spot as Dean went to him. With one hand on his jaw, Dean tilted Cas’ head back, and dipped to press their lips together. Cas sighed into Dean’s mouth, a deep, heavy sound, and his stubble was rough under Dean’s palm. It was different from kissing a girl, but it was surprisingly easy. And yeah, Dean liked it.
“I love you, Dean,” Cas said, soft and sincere.
“Y’know…?”
“Fine,” she rolls her eyes, and Cas isn’t entirely sure that she’s lying.
The three of them turned to Cas. He blinked under the sudden attention. “Oh, um…” He furrowed his brow thoughtfully. “I thought it was funny when Zuul became the marshmallow man.” As if to prove the point, he chuckled at the thought. “It’s a comical choice for an all-powerful being.”
, that sealed it.
“Hey-”  Dean starts, but is silenced by a pointed look from Cas.
“You okay, man?” Dean asks.
"Mostly, yes."
“Now, where were we?” Kelly asks as she returns to her seat. She leans forward with a tipsy eagerness.
Cas closes his eyes for a moment, to maintain his composure. “Maybe you should wait for Sam to return, and then we can all spend time together.”
“Look Castiel,” she says, folding her arms. “You didn’t save me from the void. I owe you squat--”
“You smoke?!” Dean demands. “Since when do you smoke?!”
Then Cas was coming too, fucking Dean through it, arms tight around him, moaning against his neck.
"No, it's Kaia," Jack argues.
He shifts so that he’s sitting in the centre of the bed, and Dean follows to straddle his lap.
Dean blinks, confused. “Yeah, I know…”
“No. We need to keep going.” He grabs Dean by the arm, and starts walking again, but Dean is dragging his feet.
Sam sighed and went to buy the next round of drinks, while Cas fed more quarters into the table.
“Oh! Thank you!” Sam casts a glance at Cas, and then Dean, who’s studying the menu intently. “Uh, you know, my brother, he --”
Cas noses at his chin until Dean tips his head back so Cas can kiss the hollow of his throat. "Mm?"
and neither of their hands have been still since.
Sam nodded towards the bar, and Dean followed his gaze. Cas was in deep conversation with a woman. She was a bit older, and very attractive in a tight dress, hair done up like a pin-up model, and bright red lipstick.
“A cabin by a mountain stream, or a beach house along a lonely stretch of coast.” Cas smiles as he describes it. “We could go, and be alone, and no one would see us. And we could just… belong to each other, and you--”
Dean Winchester’s face swims into focus. He’s scratched up, but in one piece. Castiel attempts to smile, but doesn’t think he’s very successful.
Castiel finds Gabriel in a smokey room, dimly lit by a single lamp that hangs over a card table. Gathered around the table are several men in expensive suits and slicked-back hair, smoking cigars. A woman enters carrying a tray of martinis, and through the door Castiel catches a glimpse of trumpets and trombones, and a crowd of people dancing.
Kevin had already scooted over to Dean’s laptop, and was typing into the search bar. “If we’re on a Bill Murray kick, can we watch something by Wes Anderson?”
“Great!” Sam says, grinning. There’s a split-second hesitation before he adds, “It'll be like a double-date.”
“If you say so.”
When Cas comes downstairs he finds Dean buzzing around the library, straightening chairs and collecting playing cards. Dean has apparently already changed into his nightclothes, and has his robe wrapped tight around himself.
Cas put his fork down and tentatively drizzled syrup around the edges of the waffle.
He braces himself over Dean, desperately working his cock, and can see the glow of his own grace reflected in Dean’s eyes.
“Yeah, but you’re the grown-up,” Claire argues.
Cas’ gaze drops to Dean’s hand, and his eyebrows draw together. “You’re bleeding,” he says, and strides over. A soft touch, and a jolt of sensation, somehow both electric and soothing, briefly floods Dean’s body. It shakes him from his shocked state.
Cas kept talking, his voice light and babbling. “… I was just thinking that I ought to have known then that you would not be what I expected. … and I think the fires of Hell must have touched me as well, because something was… lit within me.”
Dean knew he had a responsibility towards Cas. To teach him to be a guy, do guy things with him. But he didn’t think he would be abandoning the responsibility if he just… bookmarked football and came back to it later.
“Damn,” he said, as if he hadn’t noticed who Cas had been talking to before that moment. He nodded back at Maureen, with his lopsided smile and a wink, and turned back to Cas. “Well, one more time can’t hurt. You good to take care of Baby, Sam?”
“Dean, look at me,” he heard Maureen say as if from a great distance. He raised his head. Maureen was splayed out, displaying herself for him, skin flushed and glistening, muscles quaking with pleasure. She watched him with bright, wide eyes. “You’re doing amazing, sweetheart,” she hummed.
“You sure? It’s okay to say no. If you’re not comfortable, you can leave right now. I’ll explain to Maureen, and we’ll go back to the hotel together.”
And, God, Cas is easy for him
Cas doesn’t have an answer to that, and apparently Anna doesn’t either, a fact that Naomi emphasizes by letting the silence hang between them for longer than necessary.
“Huh?” Dean freezes, confused.
“Yeah. Yeah, no, of course,” Sam stammers. “Just you and Cas. But… boyfriends now.”
One of them reaches out her hand, and Dean thinks that he would like to take her hand and join the dance, to dance through the trees and let the woman's strange music flow through his veins and never stop. Castiel is tugging at his arm, but Dean reaches for the woman anyways.
Dean wakes up the next morning with a headache and a crick in his neck from sleeping on the floor. He remembers what happened the night before, but there’s too much fog in his brain to think about it very closely. Instead, he clambers to his feet, brushes his teeth, and stumbles towards the kitchen.
there is a love that angels are supposed to have for creation for each other for their Father and Castiel had that love and a piece was broken off and put back wrong with edges and corners out of place stabbing and tearing at him but it’s precious it’s (more than the dead more than) the world to him and it’s
They kiss and touch, hands sliding under clothes, not undressing because they have to stay warm. Dean says things without thinking, because it makes him feel warm, things like,
The wallpaper in Dean and Cas’ room was peeling, and the curtains were frayed, but it smelled faintly of bleach and much more heavily of air freshener, and the floor had a dull shine that said it had seen a lot of traffic but was recently cleaned. Not bad, considering.
“She was protecting me from you!” Cas protests, as Anna exclaims, “You were going to kill Cas!”
Dean doesn’t think about it, but he knows that Before he wouldn’t have said those things, that he wouldn’t have laid down besides the angel. He’s too tired to care, has been too tired for a long time. Castiel marks Dean’s neck with love bites while he slides his palm across Dean’s chest, trails his fingertips down his stomach, slips lower under Dean’s clothes. He’s clumsy and a bit frantic, grinding against Dean’s thigh half-awares.
“I was wondering…” Cas’ gaze drifted from the table top, to the bookshelf, to Kevin, to the ceiling, and back to Kevin again. He looked everywhere, except at Dean. “Wondering how you know… how… football works?”
When darkness fell, and they settled down for the night, it was a different story. Castiel’s mind would wander, and he’d chatter about botany and evolution and a dozen other things. Dean talked too, relating stories about growing up on the road, and Cas would listen. He skipped over the parts about hunting, and instead told the angel about the minutiae of his childhood: the one science class he actually liked due to the teacher starting things off by setting fire to his hand; the time all John left for Sam and Dean to eat was several boxes of Pop-Tarts, and Sam was bouncing off the walls; his speculations about what exactly was so intriguing about the world’s largest ball of twine.
Cas’ face comes into focus, lines of anxiety and regret catching the blue light of the TV screen. He reaches out a hand to help Dean up.
Dean is asleep when Eve appears at the edge of their campsite.
As Cas settled on the bed next to him, Dean shifted awkwardly. Had they always sat so close together? They must have. Whenever Dean tried to leave a breath of space between their thighs, the laptop shifted awkwardly.
In the blink of an eye, the cutlery is arranged neatly on one of the long study tables.
As they made their way through Purgatory, Castiel was keen and alert, ever much the soldier of God as he was when he strolled into that barn years ago, and Dean was glad. It felt good having his old friend at his side again.
As he makes his way back to the kitchen, Cas can hear Dean talking on the phone with Claire. There’s a surprising amount of trepidation in his voice.
“Want you in me,” Dean says urgently. “Please.
“Whoa!”
“Then after.”
) of faith. Of course the soul can’t truly be killed, just subjected to a great deal of pain as it dissolves for the time being.
It made Dean want to share more things with Cas. Which, Dean reminded himself, he ought to be doing anyways. It was, after all, part of his job as Castiel’s friend, as his family—to teach him how to be human.
While Cas is painting the crumbling walls with wards, Dean paces the room. There’s a narrow, dusty palate for sleeping, a rickety table, and a single chair with a broken leg, but otherwise the room is bare. He looks out the window at the decaying settlement, buildings packed close together, vaguely humanoid creatures staring out of the shadows with glowing eyes, and finds that he’s looking forward to tomorrow.
Dean.
Dean could have laughed at the look on Cas’ face: dazed and goofy, eyes bright, lips gently curving upwards, hair plastered to his head. But Dean figured he probably looked the same.
He caresses Cas’ face soothingly. “Hey buddy, it’s okay. We can slow down. We have all the time we need.”
“Let me see how hard you are for me,” Dean says.
Dean draws the angel blade across his palm, drips some symbols onto the ground around him. He doesn’t know if the wards will work as well with human blood as with angel blood. But this is as good a time as any to find out.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Fine. I guess Murray gets a pass.”
“Thanks Jody.” He shuts his eyes and huffs something resembling a laugh. “I, uh, I gotta check on the potatoes. See you when you get here.”
“Yes,” Cas answered, his voice light and cracking.
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asked, voice tight with concern.
"You know they don't have to be perfect, they just have to taste good."
Cas comes inside of Dean, tense with restrained power, light leaking out of his eyes. Then he relaxes, collapsing on top of Dean, mindless of the mess on Dean’s chest and stomach. He peppers kisses across Dean’s face, and Dean can feel wetness on his cheeks under the press of Cas’ lips.
“I heard what you said to Claire,” Jack says. “About praying to you for help.”
“Dean, you know I could learn to drive in a different car.”
Frustrated, Cas shakes his head. “Nevermind.”
“Yeah, why wouldn't it be?” Dean answered nonchalantly, pulling the balls out the gutter and rolling them across the table.
A cool breeze blows, lifting Cas’ tie and pushing his trenchcoat around his legs. It sweeps through the willow branches, making them sway across Castiel’s view of the reuniting souls.
“Dean, I’m in love with you.”
“Then why isn’t he here?” Cas asks with narrowed eyes.
“I don't need to make love with you to be happy, Dean.”
Dean could feel Cas inside of her as they moved in tandem. They both had a hand on Wendy’s hip, their fingers interlocked. Dean rested his head against Wendy’s shoulder, overcome by the heat and the pressure, and sensation. He was determined to not be the first to tap out, but then Wendy clenched around him. Dean’s eyes flew open, and his gaze met Cas’, blue and steady, and he came.
“You mind driving today?” Dean asked casually. “Me and Cas really tired ourselves out last night. If you know what I mean,” he added with a wink.
They eat in comfortable silence. While the taste of the pancakes is still a bit too much for Cas to parse, he does appreciate the texture, light and soft enough to fall apart on his tongue. He tells Dean as much, and Dean seems pleased with the verdict.
Telling him that “I love you” from Cas was an insult. A threat.
Content, Cas nuzzles into Dean’s neck. The glow of Cas’ grace slowly fades, until they’re lying together in the dark, catching their breath.
“What?” Dean asks, lowering his beer bottle from his lips. “And you’re just gonna let her talk to your man like that?”
Dean told Cas once. So Cas takes a moment to devour Dean. The planes of his chest and the jut of his hips cast into sharp relief by the emergency light, throbbing and red as blood. His cock hard and beading pre-come, having barely been touched. His pupils dark and wide, his lips open and wet. Dean props himself up on his elbows, his chest heaving, his legs hanging open off the edge of the bed, waiting for Cas to fill the space between them. Dean, open, and trembling, and
“What’s wrong?” Cas asked in confusion.
With the gentlest pressure, Anna starts steering him away from the group.
The angel turns to Dean, sharp and resolute. “We need a new plan,” he says matter-of-factly.
No answer.
“You’re my home, Dean,” Cas said.
“It’s simple physics. It can’t be that hard,” Cas replied
“No.”
“It’s been years since I could fly.” Cas says carefully. “I was thinking I’d take some time for myself, get used to it again.”
Cas’ legs were wrapped firmly around Dean’s hips, heels digging into his thighs. He pushed himself off the seat to meet Dean’s thrusts, encouraging Dean to go harder. Dean wasn’t able to deny him any longer, didn’t think he’d be able to deny Cas anything ever again. He picked up his pace, drawing a low groan out of Cas, contrasting with the wailing guitar. He watched Cas’ eyes squeeze shut, his jaw tighten, and knew he was getting close.
They slid back into the front seat. Before shifting into drive, Dean turned to Cas.
“It’s not nothing,” Cas insists.
“Good.”
“Okay, I know I’m good, but that was fa-
“That’s the problem with this group,” Inias sighs. “Their parents are still alive. I could make them fake parents, but… I think that could get awkward later.”

“Hey, look, here comes the food!” Sam said pointedly.
“We can wait,” Cas says
Cas catches himself before he sighs in displeasure. He would prefer to leave Dean marked with the evidence of their coupling. But he can understand how that may be uncomfortable for Dean. Objectively.
“Oh! You found it sexually arousing when I sucked on my finger.”
fighting things, and Castiel isn’t there to help him, and
If Sam reacted, Dean didn’t see it, his eyes already closed.
Wordlessly, Benjamin nods. And then he’s gone.
Uriel rolls his eyes.
“With you?” Cas’ eyebrows fly up incredulously. “How many times have you wiped them clean?”
“What happened?” Dean asked, dazed.
Dean does flinch away at that, his jaw tightening and his mouth forming a thin line. He shakes his head, and plasters a smile across his face that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Come on, sweetheart, I saw what you wanted, remember?”
By the time the opening bars of “Born to Run” started playing, Dean had to admit that Sam was
In response, Cas squeezes his eyes shut tighter. He nuzzles Dean's stomach, making him laugh.
Anael blinks at him. "Okay. And?"
The only light in the room is what leaks under the door from the hallway. Still, Cas can see Dean smile when he says, "Get up here."
Maureen grazed the shell of Dean’s ear with her teeth as her voice dipped lower. “Have you ever seen a more delicious cock in your life? And those hands, so wide and strong.”
Fix it.
Sam turned his laptop towards Dean. Dean slid his chair closer, the screech across the floor making Kevin cringe.
"Cas…” Dean chokes out, followed by a whine as Cas pulls off of him.
“Actually, I’m curious now,” Kevin said, with an earnestness that made Dean think that the kid might not be too mad at him after all. “What’s next on the list?”
Cas notices, and keeps himself from looking too self-satisfied. His gaze quickly flits to Jack, who looks like he’s trying to maintain a stilted conversation with Balthazar, Inias shifting his weight uneasily from foot to foot next to them; and to Benjamin, who is now kneeling on the ground, shaking with tears. Anna sits next to him, holding his hand, comforting. Her eyes meet Castiel’s across the lawn, a brief acknowledgement before they go back to their respective tasks.
“Dude,” Dean slides his eyes from the screen to Cas. “That’s, like, the least important part.”
Dean takes him by the arm, and helps ease Cas to the ground. “Dude, there’s a reason why you don’t fly me around here,” he says, more worried than upset.
“Cas, Dean,” Maureen said, “when you leave here tonight, I want to know that you’ll have good memories.”
Dean gawks at him. "Dude, I literally just bought all that food."
Dean glowed at the praise.
His heart jackhammers in his chest. “That one thing you want. That you thought you couldn’t have. This is it?”
Lying further up the bed, Dean had forgotten what movie they were supposed to have been watching. His entire sensory experience had narrowed to one person, to Cas. The flex of Cas’ muscles under Dean’s calves where Dean’s legs were locked around his waist; the press of his broad hand against the small of Dean’s back, as he angled Dean’s hips; the roll of his shoulders under Dean’s fingers; the sweet scent of his hair, the salty tang of his sweat, the breathy moans in Dean’s ears. The steady thrusts of Cas filling him up, the relentless rhythm between too much and not enough making him delirious enough to clutch desperately at Cas’ back and murmur his name helplessly into the air.
Like his own vessel dissolved in a river.
And Cas feels too much. He feels too big.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees Cas step into the back room. He takes his flint out of his pocket. And hears Cas’s voice, urgent.
“We did.”
“Yeah,” Dean says.
Their attention is drawn to the sky. Dean can’t tell when Castiel’s wings twitch nervously.
Dean’s smile faltered, before he plastered it back in place. “But how about those proton packs, huh? That’d make our job a whole lot easier.”
Cas furrows his brow, not sure that he’s heard right. He turns to Uriel.
Cas was inexperienced, but damn if enthusiasm didn’t go a long way. Dean threw his head back with a moan, and his eyes fluttered open. He saw himself reflected in the ceiling. Sprawled on the bed, hips in the air, Cas bent over him and bobbing his head. Next to the bed, Maureen’s robe was thrown open, her hands teasing her own body. Dean saw her too, laid out on the chaise, almost mirroring Dean.
“Yeah, I noticed,” Dean says, quirking a smile to mask his tension. He tries to keep himself from mentally cursing Jack for returning Cas’ ability to fly off, in case the kid can hear.
“Nah, screw it,” Dean says. He leans over and captures Cas’ lips with his own, relishing the sound of Cas’ sigh. “How ‘bout we just go for a drive?”
There’s no irony to Balthazar’s anger anymore.
“About you encouraging some of the angels to challenge Jack,” Cas says, dropping all pretense.
“Lady Gaga.”
A frisbee comes gliding through the air to land in the grass between Richard and Cas.
So instead, Dean researched. With angels ordered off the playing field by Jack, Hell under the benevolent dictatorship of Rowena, and Billie dead, there wasn’t much else that could have pulled Dean back from the brink like that.
Wendy had fairy lights strung around her bedroom, and a king-sized mattress on the floor, piled high with multi-coloured pillows. Cas lay on his back among the pillows, as Wendy rode his cock, and Dean fucked her ass.
Beverly grumbled as Cas got to his feet and joined Dean. “Well if you’re ever passing through again, give me a call?”
Dean dumps the groceries in front of Sam in the library.
. It’s over too soon. His skin is humming, his nerves are buzzing, and it’s not enough. He thinks,
“Is this what you’re gonna wear?” Dean asks, drawing back just far enough to eye Cas’ thrift-store t-shirt.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas trembles under Dean’s hands, and his eyes glisten with tears. He swallows and takes a breath that’s probably supposed to be calming, but doesn’t seem to do much.
“The-the last time, he was taking dumbass risks on cases, like he didn’t care about his life anymore,” Sam says, speaking progressively faster. “He literally fucking killed himself, just so he could talk to some ghosts.”
Cas smiles at the idea of him and Dean being a cute couple. He signs back,
He drags his breadstick through the sugar on his plate, and the sugar adheres to the oil. He takes a bite. It's tolerable.
Rachel and Hester freeze. The two pairs of angels stare at each other.
“What?” Anna asks.
Cas slid his hands up Dean’s chest, until they caressed his neck and shoulders. Dean sighed at the feeling. He leaned in, bringing his lips close to Cas’ mouth, nearly close enough to kiss. But he couldn’t close the distance. A strangled whine escaped his throat.
“Come on, man.” He sighs, mock-dramatically. “I gotta have breakfast.”
Dean's glances questioningly at Cas before stepping forward. "Sure, follow me."
Dean grabs Cas' sleeve. "Hang around?"
“Thank you,” he mumbles.
Cas takes an experimental bite out of his cheesy breadstick. He's immediately overwhelmed by the taste of oils and fermentation. Sadly, he sets it down.
Dean bit his lip to keep from smiling at how dramatic Cas was being over a stubbed toe. He would laugh about it later.
Cas swallows and hesitates before saying, “Anna, you know--”
bewitched, just the dumbest man alive) was home alone, and posing as environmental inspectors looking into a gas leak. For once Cas’ encyclopedic knowledge of geological processes came in handy for bullshitting, and Dean couldn’t help feeling a spark of pride. But then Sam found the bones and jarred fluids of missing people going back decades in the basement, and the witch came home early, and all bets were off.
Dean softened under Cas’ wondering gaze. He shrugged. “Well, I can be a little slow on the uptake sometimes.”
Cas smiled proudly.
“Cas…”
Dean woke up on the floor of the barn. His head throbbed where it had apparently hit the ground, and there was a dull, quickly fading pain in his back, but besides that, he was… fine.
“Do you suddenly believe in the goodness of Heaven?” Naomi presses, with a bite of irony.
Dean’s stomach was in knots as he passed by the passenger side door, to get into the back seat with Cas. As nonchalantly as possible, he toed off his shoes, and lay across the seat with his head in Cas’ lap.
“And I should’ve seen it,” Sam says, shaking his head. “After Jess, I should’ve.”
Luckily, Eileen had started to sign to Cas about Netflix early on in the brothers’ argument. Then Cas mentioned that he’s seen
“Dean. Oh, Dean…” Cas whispers. “I love you, I’m here, I’ll stay.”
Dean raised his eyebrows curiously.
But there are things that Castiel can’t watch out for. Like the fact that as time goes on, the less Dean talks about getting out. The more he seems at peace in Purgatory. And Dean’s peace unsettles Castiel.
He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. “Look, Cas,” he said, catching his friend’s gaze with his own, “One thing about being human is that we gotta
She nods and sets her shoulders. "Okay."
Sam shrugs and shakes his head. “Just that you’d made some kind of deal with the Empty, called it in, and then it took you and Billie both.”
of course;
She toes at a clump of grass and won’t meet Cas’ gaze.
, Cas, God, you’re amazing, baby, Cas… Cas, god
Cas joined Dean in the main room, grabbing his jacket from the back of a chair and shrugging it on. “Try to proposition a woman to have sex with us?”
Cas offers him a smile and a chuckle. However, Cas is far more concerned about the way Claire has been sullenly picking at her food.
Jack takes a step towards Balthazar, and the air starts to physically vibrate with tension. Balthazar’s eyes widen as he realizes just what kind of bear he’s been poking.
It was stupid. Dean didn’t even have his crowbar out when he rushed the ghost to distract it from Sam. So of course all it did was stop Dean in his tracks and fling him across the room.
Castiel doesn’t know what he can say to that. He just aches. "I suppose so."
I…” Cas cut himself off with a whimper.
Cas looked at Dean as if he agreed.
Eileen signs to Cas.
Cas says, “No.”
Sam stretched and said something about going for a run, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
“Of course,” Cas says, avoiding any indication of either curiosity or concern.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas shifts until he’s sitting in the crook of the tree, facing Dean. “Turn around,” Dean instructs him. Cas does as he’s told. “Lean on me."
“That would be nice,” Cas says. He’d suggest watching TV in Dean’s room instead, so they can sit on the bed with Dean’s arm slung over Cas’ shoulder, their thighs growing warm under the laptop battery and from being pressed together. But at the moment, there’s something appealing about being far from the main hub of the bunker. Cas suspects that Dean feels the same way.
“But what?”
It was Sam’s turn to straighten up and fix his brother with a confused look.
Dean raises his hands to Castiel’s face, holds it between his palms so he can look into those eyes lit by a spark that he put there. He says something without thinking, and the angel breaths out his name, shudders, and stills. Dean lowers a hand to wrap around Castiel’s hand, still wrapped around his cock, guides it to the rhythm he likes, squeezes it to get the right pressure. He comes too soon, but Dean’s too tired to care. Anyways, it sends a warmth flooding through him, and something that reminds him of happiness.
was, but it sounded like the type of thing he shouldn’t be exposing Cas to. “Anyways, we’re not on a ‘Bill Murray kick’,” Dean protested. “We’re on comedies. I have a plan.”
The corners of Dean’s lips twitch, as if someone’s telling a joke that Cas is unaware of. “Yeah, in real life. This is a movie. The curse is just an excuse to tell the story.”
There are so many things that Castiel wants to tell her. He decides to start with the most immediate.
“Hi, I’m Beverly,” she said, holding out her hand.
“Well? Don’t I get an apology too?” Uriel says, interrupting the silence.
“Dean!” Jody exclaims.
Before she can fly further away, Cas says,
“I just… I just never thought I could… see you like this,
A spark of nerves flashes over Mary’s face, but it quickly disappears when John laughs.
“This is amazing,” Jack says in an awed tone. “Thank you, Uriel.”
“Oh, I know you are.”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Was that a joke? Are you developing a sense of humour?”
As he was waiting for Cas and Sam to join him in the garage, Dean sorted through his cassette tapes. He wanted to save his all-time favourites for the record player in his room. But there was still plenty of great music that Cas hadn’t heard yet.
“Well that’s lovely, but I still want out,” Balthazar is saying. He glances towards Anna and Cas as they approach, and looks around for Anael and Benjamin, only to realize that they’ve gone. He rolls his eyes and crosses his arms.
But he can’t leave Dean.
“There you go!” Dean sat back from the table in the bunker library, formed two “L”s with his fingers, and held them together to make a goal post. “Now take your shot!”
Dean watches the movement, swallowing down a mouthful of egg. He filters through what he knows about Cas, his freshly acquired insight: what he knows the angel wants, what he can offer him to stay. Acceptance, companionship, camaraderie. He doesn’t show his hand yet. He waits for the other shoe to drop.
“Yeah,” Dean shrugged, trying to bring an easy tone back into the conversation. “I mean, training wheels have gotta come off some time.”
“You’ll see, it’ll grow on you,” Sam is saying. “There’s an antique shop, and a theatre--”
Dean would have come a second time from just watching if he wasn’t already spent.
Cas tenses.
Dean breaks off the kiss, masking his breathlessness with a fierce look. “Say it.” he demands.
“I picked these out myself,” Cas explains, trying to maintain a neutral tone.
A flash of irritation passes across Dean’s face. “Come on, you don’t have an opinion?”
A passing car honked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Cas?" Dean says eventually.
Not everyone is happy with the new order in Heaven.
he signs.
Dean moved closer to Cas, until he was just within arms’ reach. “One more time?”
It looks like something massive plowed through the forest, snapping not just branches but entire trees, trampling them into a wide path.
Claire nods, and falls into step besides Cas.
Cas was caught off-guard by Dean’s sudden impatience, and blinked in confusion. “I’m sorry,” he said sincerely.
Shocked into straightening his posture by the forcefulness of Cas' answer, Richard stares wide-eyed.
The late afternoon sun glares off the sidewalk as Sam, Eileen, Dean, and Castiel climb out of the car.
The angel just smiled back at him, charmed and puzzled. "And the strange thing is that it’s unique to you. In all my millions of years, I’ve never-“
Cas pulled back just enough to look Dean in the eye again, and Dean wondered if Cas could tell how much he wanted this. And then Cas surged forward, pulling Dean into a crushing kiss, one arm around his back, the other hand curled in his hair, tilting his head for a better angle.
Cas freezes at the unexpected touch. At Dean kissing him. In front of everybody.
“He’s with Uriel.”
Dean can only stare, mouth hanging open.
There's a brief argument about where to eat. Sam wants to go to the Mexican restaurant, but Dean shuts him down quickly, threatening to make him find his own ride home. Dean suggests the local bar, but Sam protests that he doesn’t want to spend dinner with the smell of stale beer and the sound of Cliff sleeping it off in a corner. So, pizza it is.
“Feels... so much…” Cas choked out incoherently. “So good. Dean, you’re
“It seems that he shares your opinion on the futility of a free Heaven,” Cas says grimly. “He thinks we might as well give up now, enjoy ourselves before Naomi takes over again.”
Sam coughs.
"Hello Dean," Cas says.
There’s a loud hum as the generator falters, and the lights flicker.
“Is that better?” he asks, and turns to see Dean watching him with a soft look and the ghost of a smile.
Cas doesn’t look Jack in the eye when he says, “Hopefully we won’t find out.”
“I love you.”
Cas touches Dean’s forehead before finishing the question.
“I know. It’s just a lot to process. You hopping on my dead father’s dick.” There’s a tremor of something in Claire’s voice.
Once he was undressed, Dean climbed onto the bed. Beverly clutched at his hair as he kissed her, trailed her fingers down his chest, his stomach, and closed a hand around his cock. Dean gasped at the contact. But he broke off the kiss, caught Beverly’s eye, and nodded over her shoulder to remind her of their agreement.
“Will you help?” he asks Anael, with an air of finality.
"I didn't know that they intended to."
“Hm?”
Dean did his best not to laugh as Sam’s mouth tightened into a thin line, and he glared disapprovingly.
“Claire’s really cool. I’d like to be friends with her.”
From the kitchen, Cas can hear Dean say, “Good. Thanks. That, uh… that means a lot.”
"No." Cas tightens his arm where it’s slung around Dean’s hips. "I want to stay here with you."
It never occurs to Castiel to think that way. Instead of stripping him down to some primal creature, every death has left him more confused as to what, exactly, he is.
On his knees, Dean can’t help but stare at Cas’ cock. Long, and flushed and hard, beading precome at the tip.
Before they stepped out the door, Dean tugged on Cas’ sleeve and pulled him close. He pecked him on the lips, and Cas’ frown faded somewhat.
Cas and Anna turn to Uriel, with twin incredulous stares.
Dean’s eyebrows flew up. “Oh.”
Castiel looks at Dean intently, trying to get through to him. “You must remember,
“Just give him time.”
Wendy asked Dean for tips on playing darts. She leaned into his chest when he came up behind her to adjust her stance with a hand on her hip, let him guide her hand as she took her shot.
Cas shakes his head at the brothers’ bickering, and tries to focus on Eileen.
Cas gawks at her. “You said you’d help him!”
Dean glanced at Cas. He was rolling his shoulders, getting used to the fit of the shirt. The sleeves hugged his arms, showing off well-toned biceps. The material of the shirt was taut across his chest, hinting at the defined muscles underneath. And yeah, the colour definitely brought out his eyes.
Dean gave him a
Dean hums. “Feels good, Cas.”
The next time they stop to rest is in the ruins of a massive stone structure, against the one corner that’s still standing. Dean builds a fire while Cas paints wards with his blood on the grey stone. Dean insists he take first watch, and Cas doesn’t argue much.
Suddenly, supporting the weight of his vessel feels like far too much effort. Castiel collapses on the ground. He feels blood collecting in his throat.
Dean nodded. He and Cas were in love. Good. He’d make it good. And fuck anyone who got in their way.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah, and you always look like you’re ready to run out the door.”
Cas smiles helplessly, and Dean kisses him.
And yeah, this was definitely an experience that Dean wouldn’t mind revisiting.
This time he spoke in English.
And Dean couldn’t do it. He never wanted to hurt Cas at all. He wanted to indulge Cas, in this, and in everything else, for the rest of their lives. Maybe the world would be cruel to him -- hell, it already had been -- but selfishly, Dean didn’t want to add to that cruelty.
“While I appreciate the effort,” Cas says, and he can’t stop smiling, because Dean
Cas waits for Anna’s reply. But it doesn’t come.
Dean felt a warmth building inside of him at her approval. He stopped biting his tongue, and groaned loudly at Cas’ next thrust.
“Dean, can you get on your hands and knees, facing me? You can use the pillow.”
Cas smiled. “I feel good.”
Cas rolls his eyes and huffs in frustration. “There won’t
“Dean, please stop,” Maureen said.
. When he came up for air, Cas didn’t look so smug anymore.
“Aren’t these caloric enough without the bacon?” Cas asks.
"Yes."
“I’ve got her on hold right now.”
Cas shrugs, and nods.
Cas and Hannah reconnect.
Running his fingers up and down Eileen’s arm, Sam says, blushing, “I could get it for you. Like an anniversary present. Happy three weeks of not being dead.”
“Oh, uh…”
Cas looks around the table. He takes in Claire’s brash confidence, Kaia's shy reticence. Sam, as the first villager to be killed off, is watching the game morosely, arms crossed. Cas notices the hint of a smile cracking Eileen’s composure, Jack’s serenity masking a thread of glee, Jody’s professional steeliness. And Dean’s artful indifference, the casual slump of his posture, the sure tilt of his mouth.
“C’mere,” Dean murmured, closing his fingers around Cas’s wrist and tugging gently.
Dean led Cas to his own bedroom across the hall, and pointed him to the small couch that stood against the wall. Once Cas was seated, Dean held up
“Yes,” Cas adds. “They were impressive creatures. Not terribly creative, though.”
“Shouldn’t they be with their families?” Cas suggests.
he says now.
Naked. On his knees. Before Cas.
There’s a proud tilt to her chin when she answers. “Yes, and he will come to me in person when he does. Not through a mere human.”
“A pitcher of your finest, cheapest lager,” Dean ordered, biting back a comment about the bartender’s manbun. He let his gaze drift around the bar as he waited.
“Look, Cas…” he started, but then came up short. There either weren’t words for what Dean wanted to say, or when he came close to finding them, they sounded kinda stupid.
Dean looked at Cas’ cock, at his hands. He gulped.
Two weeks later, Dean held a blonde named Paula in his lap, as Cas knelt with her legs over his shoulders, and his mouth on her cunt. Cas hummed sensually against her clit, and Paula arched her back, grinding her ass against Dean’s cock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey!” Dean shakes him by the shoulder. “Cas! Wake up!"
He feels Cas’ gaze follow him as he strides over to the fridge, and deliberately adds a nonchalant swagger to his step. He’s going to be normal about this if it kills him.
So Dean did.
“There’s something else.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Seemed better than letting her wander around,” Cas mutters.
Then Dean remembered he was supposed to follow them to the bed.
“Still…” Cas breathes.
“Excuse me?” Claire scoffs. “A hunter’s bread and butter is their people-reading skills. My skills are

“Nice talking to you,” Hester finally says. She takes Rachel by the arm and begins to lead her away.
“Yes.”
Dean watches his friend nervously, reaches to take him by the arm. "Let’s just step away from the ledge, okay?”
“Dean, your turn,” Maureen said.
"Patrice."
“Jalil! Go play with your own toys!”
“You know," she says in a distant tone, "I didn’t believe a word of it.”
“Yes, we’ve been watching movies. Dean has a curriculum.”
Dean trembles in the aftershock of his orgasm.
(See the end of the chapter for
Kelly pours a drink and passes it to Cas. He smiles in thanks, and she turns to refill everyone’s glasses.
things that I want,” Cas explains. “I want Heaven to be at peace and for the angels to be free,” he says, and doesn’t miss the way Dean frowns at the mention of Heaven. “I want the best of humanity to have the chance to flourish. I want there to be no more monsters to fight.”
Viewed from afar, the children on the field could be a flock of birds, swooping and turning as a single body, their cacophony not so different from bird calls.
“Hosanna in the highest.
However, the traffic on the way into the city had been a nightmare, and Dean was eager to get some rest.
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, that’s probably true.” After all, the guy didn’t know any better. He tossed the coconut in the cart, and continued down the aisle, keeping his eyes open for tinned pineapple.
Dean blinks. "Okay. Good." He smiles uneasily. "Good to know." His smile widens, without looking any more natural. He nudges Jack in the side. "Hey, you know, me and her had a bit of a thing back in the day."
Dean knows what makes Cas tick, probably for the first time ever. As crap as he feels about not understanding Cas before, Dean thinks that this can be a good thing. He can be a better friend; and if Dean is a better friend, then he can keep Cas with him.
Purgatory was never beautiful. But Castiel's relief at being alone, at being punished, made it feel like it was.
Dean met Cas’ eyes on the elevator ride down, and he couldn’t help the goofy grin that spread across his face. Cas smiled back so wide his nose crinkled. It was good to see that smile.
Cas lifted his gaze to stare at Dean with a furrowed brow.
“The old days.”
He finally looks at Anna. Her eyes are wide and apologetic. But Cas is just tired.
It was the kind of case that made Dean feel good about putting down the monster, but still left a sour taste in his mouth. The kind of case that was just bad enough to give Dean some motivation to get some beers and a lay in between him and the experience, but not bad enough to stick with him on the drive home.
“No worries,” Dean said, caught between the generalized frustration he was feeling that night, and regret at making Cas feel bad, again. “What’s up?”
Uriel smirks, which is the only warning he gives before saying, “Is that what you call screwing Dean Winchester?”
But then Dean drops to his knees.
But sometimes (often) (every time) it occurs to Castiel that what it is, especially, is trust. And then it occurs to him, that Dean is caring for him in return. And that’s somewhat more difficult to comprehend than the physical sensations that Dean is drawing out of him. It’s a bit much. It’s a bit too much. It’s much more than Castiel can handle because it’s more than just skin, it’s trust and care, and Castiel hasn’t fixed anything, only tries because Dean needs him to. And it’s Dean’s breath that’s hot on his neck. And Dean’s hands that are on him. And Castiel wants to die. He wants to die, but he’s selfish, and more than death he wants to hold on to Dean. He wants him. He wants. He loves.
“- but I knew that though you had been touched by corruption, it didn’t change who you were. You were there for righteous reasons, and it was the nature of Hell to corrupt,” Cas said, reassuring. He fixed Dean with a steady gaze, and Dean felt his breathing slow, his heart rate calm.
Cas shrugs. “I don’t know, he just seems…”
"What did Jack wanna talk about?" Dean asks, drawing back, but not too far.
But… he thought about what it would be like if, the next time they watched a movie, or listened to a song, or ate at a new restaurant, Cas looked to Dean for cues on how to react, the way that Dean used to look to John for approval in everything he did. Instead of Dean watching Cas and seeing his honest reaction, it would turn Cas into a mirror. He wouldn’t be sharing things with Cas anymore, not really. It would ruin everything.
,” Dean said, ignoring both the glare from the kid, and the frown from his brother.
Regardless of what he told himself, Dean just couldn’t seem to get his heart rate down. He braced himself against the roof of the Impala, and took a deep breath.
"Oh, hey man. Hey, Cas." Sam looks Cas up and down, taking in his new outfit. He smirks and asks, “Did Dean give you a makeover?”
They reach Dean’s bedroom --
It was surprisingly easy to get used to living in Cas’ space over the next couple of days as they worked the case. At first Dean and Cas kept walking into each other on the way to the bathroom or the kitchenette, or misplacing each others’ things as they searched for a lost razor or comb. But by the time the case was solved (A tourist had accidentally dropped an old locket in the penguin enclosure. And as upsetting as it was to see the little guys possessed by a ghost, it wasn’t terribly life-threatening.) they’d fallen into a rhythm.
“No,” Anna answers immediately. “I remade my parents’ Heaven because if there was a chance for them to be genuinely happy, I wanted them to have it. But they aren’t free. They’re just prisoners of my will.”
"She literally apologized for killing Sam."
“That's true,” Cas admits with a smile. “What do you know?”
if this isn’t a fantasy that Dean hardly even acknowledges to himself: Cas’ lips around his cock, tongue swirling around the head, cheeks hollowed out and
Cas remembers that night. The confusion at Alastair’s escape, the sense of betrayal when he discovered Uriel’s plot, the certainty he felt when facing his own death. “We were all soldiers. We were all doing what we thought was right, in our way.” He can hear emotion rising in his throat when he says, “Thank you.”
“I like to watch.”
Dean grinned as if he’d just won a prize. “See? The man’s got good taste.”
Anna’s central eye turns towards Cas; a rich, deep brown that catches the light from Heaven.
Dean glanced over Cas’ shoulder, seeing Maureen leaning against the bar. She raised a manicured hand and waved at him.
Dean sets his jaw, and draws back.
Jack nods. "He’s making his first heaven now."
“Nope!” Dean answers happily. “Come on, Cas, our chores are done.” He reaches to grab Cas’ tie, hesitates, and changes course to take Cas by the elbow and pull him up from his chair.
He cuffs her on the shoulder. “See ya later, Yoda.”
Balthazar blinks, his smirk falls away.
Dean’s about to ask how far it is to the next rest stop that Cas scouted out, when the angel throws an arm out in front of him.
"What'd I tell you?" Dean says around a mouthful of meatlovers'. He gestures towards Eileen’s plate. "I'd offer to trade slices, but that’s not a pizza; that's a crime."
"Of course."
Cas’ mouth on his cock, not really, not like that. But Maureen was giving him permission, so he shoved the thought aside, and gasped, “Cas, please.”
It hasn’t yet been thirty minutes when Cas feels a tug at his grace, the ache of Dean missing him. He takes a moment to let his own relief wash over him, then gets up to join Dean in his room.
And oh, there have been times when Cas felt that was true.
Dean expects the ancient hunger within Castiel to rear its head. He swears he can feel it seething beneath the angel’s skin. But instead, Cas is achingly tender with him.
Dean smirked, and set up his fingers as goal posts again. “Exactly.”
Dean and Cas drop their purchases in the car. With a blink, Cas changes into his new clothes, picking out a shirt with an International Harvester logo that stretches slightly over his chest to wear under his new jacket.
to make Heaven better. You don't have to accept that. But I will keep trying regardless.”
Sam shrugged. “Making the EPA the villain of the story? Especially when there’s legitimate environmental concerns about guys running around with nuclear reactors on their backs?”
It wasn’t clear that Cas liked it though. Dean could feel the tension in his jaw and neck, and he barely kissed back. He was just experiencing it passively, just letting Dean kiss him. Dean wasn’t happy to settle for that, and he was pretty sure Maureen wanted something a bit more interesting too.
Claire sends a tight smile in the vague direction of Castiel, before hunkering down next to Kaia. She coils an arm around Kaia’s waist and pulls her tight to her side. Kaia’s hand finds Claire’s, and she gives her a fond look.
Sam’s eyebrows fly up at that. “Jesus, Cas.”
the one who taught him how to shave. And how to use the coffee maker. And the microwave. And told him what vitamins to get. And how to use his points card at the grocery store.”
“So we’ve got whipped butter, syrup, and strawberry jam,” he says, setting each one down in turn. “Take your pick.”
busy,” Dean says.
“I slept with him one time,” Anna explains with an exasperated sigh. “It was just a spur-of-the-moment, imminent death thing. And honestly, it wasn’t earth-shattering.”
Claire closes her eyes, and breathes in the settling night. "You know, you lied."
Dean pulled what he hoped was a confident smirk and nodded. “I think that can be arranged.”
He headed back to where Sam and Cas were waiting for him by the Impala, passed Sam a room key, and then beckoned to his friend. “Come on, Cas, you’re with me.”
“How ‘bout I teach you?” Dean asked, preparing to insist if Cas said no. Pool was a key component of hunter life: A way to relax after a hard day, to make some quick cash, to size-up other hunters, to show off for the ladies. Dean would be derelict in his duty to Cas if he let him go through the rest of his life not knowing how to play pool.
Anna is silent.
He looks back at Cas, and finds his blue eyes staring back, a question in the line between his brows. Dean realizes how much could be read into what he said, into
It’s a nice sentiment. And Cas appreciates it, in a way. But it expresses something less than trust. And it’s spoken after it would have really mattered.
"When do you think Sam and Eileen are gonna get hitched?" Dean asks after a while.
Cas swallows, and nods. “Thank you.”
It’s the familiar emotions that hit him first. Affection, joy, comfort, and yes, love. They flood Dean with warmth, lift him up like a cresting wave. And like a wave, they ease back down, into longing, loneliness, grief, pulling at Dean’s chest like a fishhook. And this is love too, he knows. There’s so much of it, the good and the bad, both trying to drown him in different ways.
"You’re not being dumb," Cas says, all the more serious for Dean’s self-derision. "I’m aware that the way humans relate to gender and sexuality is complex and socially conditioned--"
Dean plunks down in a chair next to Cas, kicks his feet up on the table, and gives Claire the finger.
, and he
be having sex with at the same time—so much the better.
“Oh honey, don’t worry about me,” Dean said in response, and nipped at her earlobe.
“Oh.” Castiel considers this. “In that case, I think the movie presents an interesting metaphysical scenario, akin more to some conceptions of reincarnation than a proper curse. It also poses the question of what it would take for an individual to truly change their lives for the better. The film suggests that it’s necessary to kill the self, symbolically, or in the weatherman’s case, literally, before he can genuinely begin the process of self-improvement. And that the only actions that can be considered purely good are those that are not only unrewarded, but don’t even contain the promise of any consequences at all, positive or negative. Philosophically it’s not an invalid perspective, but personally…” Cas can’t help but reflect on his own experiences with change, and with consequences. “Personally I think it’s a bit pessimistic. What do you think?”
“Claire.” Cas watches ellipses pulse across his screen and then disappear.
"But I'm here now," Cas says quickly. He moves back towards Dean, trails his fingers up his bare forearm, the soothing ghost of a touch. “And I'm not going anywhere,” he adds, knowing that whenever he’s said that over the past couple of days, Dean has let go of his tension. It works this time, too.
"My apologies,” Cas says with a fond smile. “I hope I didn’t keep you waiting."
Dean takes a calming breath as Cas rises and takes the couple of steps to cross the room.
She brought her lips up to his ear, and whispered, “Just didn’t want you to feel left out.”
He doesn’t stop to think. He’s not scared of the monsters outside because Castiel put up protections in his blood, and he knows that he’s not scared of Castiel. Dean kisses him in the firelight.
He opened his eyes. Cas was standing tall in the neon light, a streak of blue running across his jaw, red framing his shoulders, open and unashamed.
Cas drops a light kiss on his shoulder, on his collar bone, on his neck. He lies on top of Dean, lazily kissing him, until his laughter dies down.
, Cas had said.
Keeping his eyes on the road, Cas pulled a cassette out of his jacket pocket, and fed it into the tape deck.
Dean rolled his eyes. “No friggin’ appreciation for art,” he mumbled to himself.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean says, out of breath and edgy. He kneels next to Castiel, trying to asses the angel’s condition. “Let’s never do that again.”
Looked for the image source on this, apparently it's a CD cover from an artist named Phaenon.
Cas can see Richard and Amy smile with glistening eyes.
Slowly, Cas steps closer. Cas’ hand reaching towards him brings back memories of the previous night, but Dean closes his eyes, determined not to show panic. As soon as Cas’ palm cradles his cheek, Dean relaxes. The touch is warm, and gentle. Dean covers Cas’ hand with his own, holding him in place, and opens his eyes.
Beverly watched hungrily as Dean pulled off his clothes. Dean found himself kind of wishing that she wouldn’t. He wasn’t sure what he had been expecting Cas to look like under his clothes, but the way his muscles rolled along his back and shoulders, the definition around his chest and hips, left Dean feeling a little self-conscious. If he had been in Beverly’s position, there was no doubt over which man he’d be paying more attention to.
Dean moves around the kitchen with a confident grace, and Cas sits and watches the arc of his arms, the skip in his step. Dean whistles to himself as he opens the fridge and bends to reach for the eggs, a bright and lilting sound. He pivots to close the fridge door with his foot, slides over to the mixing bowl, and cracks the eggs with an easy snap of his wrist. There’s a poetry to all of it.
Cas thinks, before his attention is drawn back to Anael by her scoffing.
Next to Cas and Eileen, Dean and Sam are bickering. Cas stopped paying attention to them a while ago, and is only dimly aware of the way the topic of the argument has shifted from being about Dean eating Sam’s food (“Thought you wanted me to eat more fruit and shit?” “Not when it’s
“Hello!” Jack says brightly.
"It was an honest mistake!" Jack insists with wide-eyed innocence.
“Angel,” Cas reminds him, and cleans away the traces of raw meat on his hands with a thought.
isn’t the issue. Because he knows that Dean loves him. "But people
“There was a job opening. I took it,” Cas answers simply.
“Nothing.” Dean sighs again, a light and floating sound. “Think that was the best orgasm I’ve ever had.”
Dean tilts his head to avoid Cas’ kiss. “And?”
He turned to look at her. She was sprawled out across the chaise, her legs hanging over the end, hips angled high. He could see the vibrator pressing against her clit, sliding between the lips of her pussy, and then dipping in. He stared, mesmerized, as she stroked once, twice, and then pulled out to tease her clit again.
Focused as he is on the door that Claire left through, Cas doesn’t see Dean roll his eyes.
He blinks, and considers. “Basically, yeah.”
He hears a giggle from Anna. She looks from Uriel, to Cas, to Jack, suppressed amusement making her mouth twitch, until she bursts out laughing. Uriel snickers along. Cas and Jack share a look, both confused.
, Dean thinks abruptly. He’s just stopped another apocalypse, and all his friends are alive this time, including his best friend. So the guy’s had a bit more going on under the surface all these years than Dean suspected, so what? Dean Winchester isn’t about to have his happy ending torpedoed because he can’t deal with
“Dean?” he asked, puzzled. “There’s only one bed.”
Cas’ voice was rough and flat when he said it, so serious that it couldn’t be mistaken for anything but the truth.
Not only because Castiel swore to Dean that they’d find a way out. And not only because he owes Dean for what he did to him, or because he owes Dean for the renewed trust and camaraderie that he has begun to show towards Castiel. Even a renewed sense of friendship, despite everything.
“Not even a little pissed at me?”
Chapters should be shorter from here on out, so I'm hopeful about sticking to the two-week schedule.
And then Castiel feels guilty for that, too.
I basically lifted the line "You can't have it if you can't say it" from
“Cas, what is this?”
She wobbles her head as if she’s thinking it over, though the gleam in her eye says she’s already decided. “I’ll see what I can do.”
Cas folds himself over Dean, so he can feel Dean’s heaving breaths against his own chest, vital and needy.
Dean quirks an eyebrow skeptically. “Okay. Don’t get eaten by racoons.”
"They’re taking a while, huh?" Jody says.
Dean felt his stomach flip over, and grinned back at him. “You sure did, buddy. Blew my goddamn mind.”
“I thought the point of your new Heaven was free will, not enlightenment,” Anael says, cocked head and folded arms. “Free will includes the ability to choose hedonism.”
and that was a flagrant violation of the rules and why does
, to hunger in a human way, to ache for food. That’s in the past now; now Cas not only doesn’t need food, but it’s an effort to find pleasure in eating at all. But he

Then, all there is, is
“I’ve been in love with you since… since I don’t know how long.”
your opinion?” Cas presses, quickly losing patience.
"Cas?”
Eventually, Anna rejoins Castiel, looking exhausted and overwhelmed, but happy. The two of them make their farewells for the day, but Jack insists that the discussion he’s having with Richard is too important to cut short, and says he'll stay a while longer.
He braces himself with his wings, and fucks Dean harder. Dean’s shoulders writhe against the mattress, his muscles trembling and giving way; he’d be collapsed on the bed if Cas didn’t have a steel grip on his hips. A beat of percussive
Dean feels selfish. He can’t remember the last time he’s wanted something so badly for himself as he wants to hear Cas promise to stay. He thinks maybe he’s earned some selfishness.
"Castiel," Dean whispered, searching Cas' gaze, "let me take care of you."
He asks Richard, "Would you like me to introduce you to the new god?"
Cas blushed and ducked his head. “Actually, I, uh… I’ve been studying.”
, nothing is clear or defined. So he answers honestly. “I don’t think I can describe it.”
Cas narrows his eyes. “About what?”
“If you wanna call it ‘teaching’, go ahead,” Sam sighed, untangling a pair of amulets. “But Dean...
Jack shrugs. "I mostly give the angels guidance. Sometimes I visit some of the souls, like my mom. I had a very interesting talk with Anna’s father yesterday--"
Before Cas could reply, Sam interjected, “But not good enough to get you out of buying our next round.”
“Have a good day, boys,” the shopkeeper says, the picture of politeness.
to ask, “But
There’s a beat before Dean says, “Wait, so our best friend comes back from the dead, and your first thought was that you miss your girlfriend and wanna go see her instead?”
“Is it really?” Cas asks. He thinks of his human friends, he thinks of Dean. He’s certain that they could describe their heavens without hesitation. He plans to build Dean’s heaven himself, so that it’s finished and waiting for him, and Cas doesn’t doubt what it will contain. Family. Places that have felt like home. Places where Dean was never able to spend enough time.
There was a stinging in his right palm; not acute enough to be painful, but irritating. Dean looked at his hand. There were scrapes where the bark of the branch had chafed against his skin; redness fading into small beads of blood, bits of dirt and moss lodged under peeling skin.
Cas freezes.
“It brought me back from the dead, isn’t that enough?” Dean answered with a glare.
Deans licks up Cas’ neck, and breathes against his ear. “Again.”
“Good. I’m glad.” Cas draws back.
And oh, Dean did
"The three of us, we want to return to Earth."
"Uh huh?--" Jody begins to prompt, at the same time as Dean says in a rush, "Me and Cas, we’re uh, we’re dating."
As Eileen walks behind Cas, he feels her tap him on the shoulder.
“Fine! Just a sec!” Dean called back.
Dean couldn’t see whatever he did next, but it made Beverly gasp.
Jack's eyes drop to his hands, his fingers lacing together and pulling apart.
Cas lowers his hand. "I was thinking, since Sam and Eileen are here now, that Jack should have dinner with us tomorrow night."
He smiles and embraces his brother, ready to get back to normal.
He turned to ask Cas if he was ready to go, and saw his friend still doing his hair in the bathroom mirror, getting it just the right level of messy. He was wearing the navy blue t-shirt.
Dean raises his other hand to caress Cas’ neck and jaw, thumb brushing against a fluttering pulse point. Cas swallows a whine.
He pulls out, turns Dean over on his back, and takes his own cock in hand.
“Dude, how long was I like that?” Dean asks.
“Yeah. Okay.”
“I don’t know,” Cas says, voice near a whisper.
, he thought.
“You’re welcome,” Cas smiles.
, as Cas very loudly, and very obviously, kicked him under the table.
“Cause you’re not going anywhere, right?”
Dean would have responded with a smirk and a quip, but Maureen wasn’t that kind of dame. He could tell that she had something else in mind.
Dean strolls into the nest with a shout of “Dinnertime, you filthy freaks!” Six ghouls come at him at once.
Dean knows he’s said the right thing when Cas’ body turns more fully towards his, a look of wonder on his face, breathing out his name, “Dean…”
“I think Cas would eat anything you make for him, Dean.”
Dean breathes.
Cas asks.
“I’d like that,” Cas answered simply, readily.
Sam sighs. “In that case I’m going to need another beer.”
“Yeah,” Dean croaked.
“It seems a lifetime ago,” Cas interrupts quickly, before he's even certain what she's going to ask, just knowing that it's something about before, something he can't think about. Something about the question, the context of it, scratches at his brain the wrong way.
Cas wants to take Dean’s hand in his own, to hold it gently and still its fidgeting. But he can’t tell right now if Dean would find that comforting or confining.
Cas frowns.
Gabriel leans back in his chair and crosses his arms, still chewing on his toothpick. He looks Cas up and down, sizing him up.
“What I do know,” she continues, voice low and firm, “is that Naomi has
“Okay, shift her into drive… and gentle on the gas to start.”
“Who wants to hear about the time I knocked out a homophobe in Idaho?” she asks the room at large.
Eventually, Dean took him down to the firing range to get some of that aggression out. Cas didn’t do too badly—a couple of shots were wildly off-target, but most were grouped nicely, if a bit off-centre. Inspecting the target, Dean started to give Cas some pointers; but Cas just put his gun down, flung his earmuffs aside, and stormed off as Dean was talking.
"Roger that," Sam says.
?" Jody asks suddenly.
When it was Cas’ turn, Dean was happy to return the favour. He watched Cas’ shoulders sag, his head loll to the side, heard his sigh amid the pounding water. Dean realized how much he had missed seeing Cas enjoy himself.
"Was starting to think you weren't coming back," Dean says, laughter in his voice as he approaches Cas.
Anna softens her voice further, and continues, “He wanted to meet ‘the woman who was deemed worthy of bearing the Morningstar’s child.” She finishes with a snicker and takes a sip of mimosa.
Anael is all business when she meets Castiel.
Sam and Dean find a nest of ghouls in an old mausoleum. They make a plan of attack. Sam says they both need sleep, that they should go in the morning, and Dean agrees. He lies in the dark, listens till Sam’s breathing becomes slow and even, and then leaves.
