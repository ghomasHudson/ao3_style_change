to stay behind, would you do it?”
“Jesus, Dean.”
“Call me any time. And-- Dean… It’s going to be all right.”
“No.” It comes calmer, surer. “You were right… I was having a good time. I can’t spend my whole life jumping at ghosts, you know? So… I’m gonna sit here for a minute, and I’m gonna try and have a good time again. And if I can’t do that by the time Gabe and Rowena get here, then I can call Jody.”
“What if I’m a disappointment?”
, you’ve never felt anything like this, you really are just a whole new level of virgin.”
“Hello, Dean.”  Cas smiles, as Dean approaches the truck, giving the roof a little pat. “It is for Mondays. Or for any other occasion when a truck comes in handy. Gabriel and Rowena only have a single parking spot at their current place, so I still have Gabriel’s car.”
Dean?
“What was it like, for you?”
“I heard there’d be pie.” He grins, moving to lean against the counter. He snags one of the apple slices Cas has just finished prepping, popping it into his mouth.
“Okay as anyone can be, with… you know. It’s not as bad as it looked like it was gonna be, he--” Dean shakes his head, has to close his eyes tight a moment and just focus on keeping it together. “He needs time to recover and I don’t know how much time we have. But there’s no reason he can’t-- Nothing’s broken. He passed out  before I could try and give him an aspirin, maybe I should’ve done that first, but when he wakes up… I’ll get him to drink some water, and he can down a couple painkillers. He’s… he’s gonna be okay. But he’s done, Sam.” Dean turns from Jack to Sam at that. “Whatever next plan you come up with, you leave Cas out of it. He’s not in any kind of shape to fight, and he could be down for a long time. And you know… you know if you bring up the
me so. The desperation and the… the hopelessness.”
Close… not perfect, but close.
“He’s a piece of work.” Castiel sighs. “How long did he have this… Dean, you said?”
For all the ways their histories might look like total opposites to others, Dean is sure no two people could get each other more than he and Cas do.
“That makes sense. Probably what I would do if it were me.” Cas nods.
“Do we have bacon?” Benny breaks out in a toothy grin. “Brother, I guarantee you the best bacon any of those girls ever had. We just got in a big ol’ hog at the shop, too, that’s five hundred pounds of goodness. You goin’ over there?”
He nods, going quiet for just a moment.
“Yeah?”
“I see. And you… Your intent, is it to remain here, doing tiring, all-too-thankless work, or is it that you hope to find your brother so that you can take him home?”
“But you want this now.” He nods.
Cas splutters in near-protest, but Sam clears out, and Dean drags him back to the bedroom for some serious privacy. The kisses aren’t remotely what he’d call ‘making out’-- they stretch out together and trade a few, gentle. Neither of them has real experience, in this… Cas, with his lifetime of seeing little point in kissing anyone he wasn’t sure he’d spend his whole life with, and then certain he wouldn’t get to have that, and Dean… Dean, with a solid decade of being used, but never allowed this. Never really kissed. Any other omegas he might have been able to turn to for the simple comfort of a touch meant to be kind wouldn’t have wanted this, not in the places he’d been. His first kiss was a lifetime ago, and since then…
“No. I don’t. I know this version of you, and this version of you… this version of you has-- You make my life better than I thought it was going to be. And… you only know this version of me. You don’t see my ‘stuff that’s missing’. You know, because I’ve told you, that I have a condition, that it’s worsening over time, and you’ve seen me on good days and on bad days, but there are things… You and I never saw each other at our very best, and we never saw each other at our very worst. I happen to-- I happen to like this version of you. And I think that you’ll regret it if you never talk to him… if you never see the man he grew into for yourself. And I know that I would have regretted it if I kept him from you just because I was selfish, just because I like having you here, and seeing you, and working with you, and I would be a lonelier man if you went back to your uncle’s.”
“I do not eliminate waste. And I think it would be difficult at this angle.” Cas frowns.
“What--?”
“Dean…” And then there are lips, trailing along his jaw, a kiss that stops short of reaching his mouth, but it lingers, tender and intimate. Cas bears some of his weight on his arms, still lying atop Dean, and it’s not exactly ‘sexy’, or he doesn’t think it’s trying to be, but it’s a lot. “I promised you I would be here when you woke…”
“I know. But I know… you desire men.” His head falls back again, Dean sort of wants to bite him. That throat. “
“Okay. Fine. I’m just trying to look out for you, bro. I’d love to see you… be
, exactly, you know… sometimes you want to think about something a little first, right? Figure it out real slow?”
Cas glances away. “Yes. Sometimes… it’s easier, safer, to be alone. To be able to understand yourself before you have to worry about anyone else. I  don’t know if many alphas feel the same, but I’ve always… I’ve always understood the idea of… security, control.”
“Speaking of Sam.” He shifts his weight, one foot to the other. “He’s gonna get out of your hair and let you… catch up. If you need me, I’ll be with books. Doing book things. Reading, is what I’m going to go do.”
“No camphor?”
“I should try…” Jack looks from Cas to Dean. “I should try to heal him.”
“Every desire, huh?”
“Yeah?”
“We’ve got Cas, now we have the
Dean thinks he gets why Cas is opening up now, while Dean is the one being massaged into relaxation and not him-- in part, because if Dean gets incensed on his behalf, he can soothe him again. Mostly because in this position, Dean can’t easily look at him. They’re touching, fully connected to each other, but he doesn’t have to bear being looked at while he spills his history.
“You can make yourself at home.” He offers, when Dean comes in, head ducked and expression uncertain. “Jody will want to come in for coffee when she gets here, you might as well be comfortable.”
“Well, I don’t know if-- it’s not that he’s my
were supposed to be gone.” He takes a couple more steps towards Cas, flings Dean back with a casual gesture when he tries to run forward. “Castiel… such a
At that, Cas convulses as if struck with something else, something big. Dean can’t get the rest of the way to his feet, against whatever psychic godly woo-woo pressure is emanating from Chuck, but he can crawl, on the ground, even though it feels like he’s trying to push through a brick wall, he crawls until he can’t crawl any further, until all he can do is reach out, until he can just get a hand around Cas’ ankle.
Dean doesn’t ask, but Castiel expects he wants to, and desperately. Wants to know if it was someone under his command, or someone he failed to save, and after a long moment of Dean vibrating in his seat and doing his best not to stare, Castiel figures he might as well tell him.
“We don’t?” He can practically hear the furrow in Dean’s brow. “I mean don’t get me wrong, I wish the idea of traveling didn’t break me out in hives, because he can’t really come out here until Sam’s got a place and, like… furniture. I can’t invite him to stay at Jody’s and Sam hasn’t even started apartment hunting, so he’s in a motel… but Sam’s taught him how to video call, so we’re just going to try and talk when we can and hopefully bring the old guy out for Thanksgiving. You probably… you probably have stuff you guys do every year, but maybe you guys can meet when he’s here. Sam says it’s about time he planned a vacation for himself.”
“‘M not a baby, you don’t have to give me a lollipop because something scary happened.”
“Don’t sell yourself too short there, stalwart protector. You know, Jody’s told me some stories about some of your exploits. Pretty sure I’ll be safe with you.” He winks. “And, you know. If it’s not such a good day, I’m not so bad myself.”
“Yeah. That.”
“I’ll look at my schedule. If Charlie sends me something, I might as well come around and plot in person.”
of the center, Mister Winchester,  not a ward. Even if that were not the case, suppose I had been mistaken, suppose I had pushed you in front of the wrong Dean because I was working from incomplete information and a genuine but underinformed desire to do good?”
“Is that good?” Cas asks him, fingertips dancing over his belly, making the muscles jump. “Dean, you have the prettiest bottom. I would like to dress you in silk and lace, just to be able to see it framed the way you deserve…”
“Hey, Cas.” Dean’s voice is languid, warm. “This a good time?”
“What… what are the, uh, more universal instincts? How do I know if I’m…?”
Dean breaks first, in the ensuing staredown-- breaks pretty quickly. Unfolds his arms so that he can cup Cas’ face between his hands.
“So am I really good or really bad at that?”
And then Dean smiles.
“Glad to be back.” He nods, sweeping past Sam and gliding down the stairs, all grace and speed as he makes a beeline for Dean.
. This version of you? You just can’t,” Chuck gestures, Cas’ head snaps to the side. “Do.” and again. “Anything.” Again, and Cas collapses to the ground. "Right.”
“Always thought… you know, you look at marriages. Other people’s marriages. So many of ‘em seem so miserable. You wonder why people even do it… like they hardly seem to like each other. Spent a long time thinking if that’s what that life was, I didn’t want it. But I wanted it.”
Well… the panties definitely count as that. He hasn’t even told Cas about these, yet.
“Just you and me?”
“But he thinks… there’s nothing left for us to try.”
“Staying home with you. With or without sex.”
“Did you use that stuff, for yours?”
“I would love to see that, actually.” Sam says, stepping into Dean’s line of sight and reminding him that he’s actually still there. “He’d be way more worried about the car than about you dropping him down a flight of stairs.”
“I hurt you. Caused you to take on guilt for what happened. But that choice was mine to make. I was prepared… I was prepared for everything, except to hear that you…”
Cas, and still he heard him? How much did he feel, when he heard Dean grieving him? Did he know he was loved, did he know?
“One on the house to get them hooked and then you’ve got to pay?” Cas raises an eyebrow, making Benny laugh.
“No, you’re-- okay? Listen to me, you’re a big friggin’ deal here.”
“Don’t look at me. Cas is the one who put it up.”
“That’s fucking smooth.”
“My eyes are wide open. They have been… and I know where I belong.”
“Okay, this has been a magic friggin’ moment, but can I get back to kissing my new boyfriend now?” Dean gives Sam a gentle shove, reaching up to tousle his hair. “Hey, have you even had a haircut since the last time I gave you one?”
anything, he hasn’t
Second, a biological note: I'm writing an a/b/o universe where ambiguous genitalia is a fairly common thing-- mostly because I'm coming to a/b/o as a trans man and that's what fuels my interest in reading and writing about worlds where some men can give birth but they have to put up with being feminized/reduced to society defining them by the uterus, being fetishized, infantilized, or harassed in turn. So... yeah. Feels good to take that kind of world and take a character who's been through the ringer and give him a happy ending.
“You could celebrate with us, then. I’m already planning out the pie menu.”
“Well you
“Yes, perhaps it is best if this is between us.”
“I usually want to call you.” Dean admits.
“If this was Scrabble, I wouldn’t let you play it as a word.”
“He’s in pretty rough shape. We might have to do this without him.” Sam says softly, his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“My old man taught me a little. He, uh, wasn’t gonna take me to get a license or anything. But he still taught me, in case there was an emergency or something, while I was-- just in case of any kind of emergency, I guess. License would’ve been more freedom than I could handle, that’s how he put it. A waste.”
“Totally! Well, we’ve met. But he got this guy to finally watch Star Wars, so he’s in my good books.”
“What are you talking about? Good for-- Are you kidding me right now? Are you kidding me? You don’t get to sell yourself short like that, not after everything-- not after everything.”
“... Okay. You gonna hire him?” Dean leads him into the living room, flopping down onto the couch. A far cry from the uncertain way he’d perch at the edge of his seat, back when they first met.
“I just, I need…” He nuzzles in, lets himself take some comfort in the fact that if this is Dean, his own, the same man he had that moment of such intense feeling over, then it means he’s safe and healthy, it means they did right by him. “It’s
… that would change a man’s perspective.
“I can go pick up lunch for us both, if you would like.”
“That’s really great, Dean.” Sam pulls him in even tighter for a moment. “I was so worried, after all these years, that… I don’t know what. But-- That’s just, really great. God, I need to call Bobby.”
“One for tonight and one for breakfast.” Rowena declares.
He doesn’t leave until Dean goes to take a shower and Jody goes to start on dinner prep, until they both seem like they’ve digested the news and are ready to carry on. But once he’s home, he knows what he has a duty to do.
He laughs softly at the admission, something Dean feels as much as he hears, the warmth of Cas’ breath huffing out against slightly-damp skin.
-love, the kind that has you want to ride off into the sunset with a guy. There are plenty of kinds of love, Dean knows, that can make a man trade his life for someone else’s. But he’d known what Cas was saying, there was no mistaking it. How long had that love been there?
At least for today, he has Gabriel for company-- and for much-needed help, even if neither of them are keen to address it head-on. His older brother isn’t prone to heavy discussion, but that’s what he needs. The rest of the family are all too interested in asking probing questions about his health and his prospects, Gabriel knows how to respect a boundary when it’s important, even if he plays at not believing in them.
“Then why do they call him ‘One-Eyed Eddie’?” Cas asks.
“Ro and I are househunting.” Gabriel offers, taking Cas’ mind off of the question of what his point had been to begin with. “Thought you should know.”
Maybe soon, maybe next time… Cas eases him through his orgasm and the aftershocks, kissing the side of one knee and sighing deep against him.
“And…  I thought I’d get a pie in the oven-- I got the prep work done while you were out, I thought… it would be nice to celebrate with, after your big day. It can bake while we eat dinner.”
“And you’re so good at it, dearie.” Rowena pats his cheek, heading back for another crate as Gabriel gets the little pergola for their booth loaded. “Go on now and get the tables and chairs in, and I’ll treat you to something special when we get there.”
“And Garth-- Garth, Sam.” Cas says, watching as Garth goes straight for the hug. “Uh, Garth is in charge of counseling, the non-physical side of trauma recovery. He also organizes groups that are omega-only spaces for, uh…”
“Excuse me, but I didn’t come in for advice on my personal life. Or my health--”
“Both. Sometimes it’s bad. Sometimes I dream I’m almost out the door and then Alastair has me, and when I wake up sometimes it’s like… like when you’re not sure where you are ‘cause you’ve been moving for so long but all the rooms are the same in the dark. Only the part that gets me is being in a room at all, being in a bed, and I gotta remind myself everything that really happened, that I’m safe. Sometimes it’s good. Patrick Swayze roundhouse kicks the son of a bitch trying to beat me down and he carries me out.”
“That would be best, I think. Thank you.”
Cas hushes him, one knee on the mattress beside his hip, and his hands move up again, to cradle Dean’s face.
“Mostly you’d hear ‘em outside, but, uh… it was when Azazel came, mostly. Kid that’d come with him. He’d threaten you with ‘em. It was talk, mostly, but they’d be there in the room, looking at you like a raw, bloody stead, snapping and growling, and he’d list all the things they
He knocks, which feels dumb, but Cas just comes back in when he does, smiling that warm little smile that crinkles up his eyes and makes the sun look a little less brilliant in comparison. The one that’s barely a smile around his lips, just up at his eyes, until the moment Dean smiles back and then the biggest, widest grin breaks out.
“Think you could keep doing that? Least until my heart rate goes back to normal. Or, comes back out the other side of normal but in a nice way?”
But he knows himself now, and he knows who he’s been, and he knows there was never really a time where he’d have accepted this, before… well, maybe not before the day he lost him, but was there a point before Jack, before Cas made that deal and sold himself out to the Empty, when Dean could have accepted his love?
“You don’t have to know how to talk to people. You just gotta… stand next to me so I can remember how to talk to people.” Dean nudges him, his smile familiar-- soft and wry and uncertain all at once, Dean’s pain and resilience and personality shining through the smallest quirk of his lips. “You just gotta keep me from punking out. I told Garth I’d ask someone but he might have to explain… you know. All this.”
“That’s good.” His hand slides back down, the heel of his hand rubs a firm little circle, just above the waistband. “That’s what I asked you to do. You never do enough for yourself… just for yourself. What do you like about them?”
But… he could stay, later. When he runs the bath, when Dean gets into the bath, Cas might stay, and might look at him, or even touch him. Not without permission, but Dean is ready to give him permission.
Dean is destroyed.
The pamphlets aren’t all career-oriented-- they wander that way before braving small talk with strangers, and alongside titles such as VOCATIONAL STUDY OPPORTUNITIES, YOUR HIGHER EDUCATION OPTIONS, and OMEGAS IN THE WORKFORCE, there are pamphlets on other topics. Titles like STARTING A HEALTHY FAMILY alongside THE CHOICE TO BE CHILD FREE. And then, LOVING THE MASCULINE OMEGA.
is not propositioning
“Cute.” Dean snorts. Tybalt chatters softy at him, before settling back down on his chair. “So… same as last week, right?”
“It’s a lot easier against a wall.” He promises him, grabbing onto one of the two ropes. “Just… watch how I do it, and then follow. I’ll wait for you when I get to the top.”
Dean’s eyes light up, for a moment, but he pulls himself back from it, and doesn’t ask. Still, his hands linger over the package of ground beef as he puts it away.
Well, it’s not surprising, all things considered. He just hadn’t known until the moment he noticed how carefully Dean was avoiding certain details, and now he wonders how he could ever have thought Dean
He gives a jerky nod, leading with his chin, and Cas thinks it must be something he tells himself often, something he needs to believe.
“My brother--”
“That would be practical.”
“What, he… he wasn’t happy before this, then?” He says at last, with a heavy note of sorrow.
“You took one look at the engine, got a wrench, came out, and fixed it.”
“You are
“A bottle broke, it startled a few people. If I can’t handle that--”
“Okay,
“I am really not.”
“So, deadheading-- there’s not much to worry about this early in the year. I mean technically it’s just pruning, at this point. Leaves that look brittle or unhealthy, or segments of stem that are off-color from the rest of the plant, you can take off. The actual ‘heads’, that might be more of a concern in mid-June, but… well, you see here?” He pinches a stem carefully, and shows Dean where to snip, as well as what else to look for. “And any trimmings will go out to the compost, for now, but when we have blooms to deadhead, I’ll be saving those, Rowena uses the petals.”
“Stop acting like one and I will.” She fires back, hugging him before they all move towards the door. “See you next week, kiddo.”
“Okay.” Dean gulps, nods. He can take a turn to be the strong one for Cas, if it means having him back, if it means getting to lean on him when it’s over. “Okay.”
“And what good’s trying supposed to do us, huh? We can’t read the damn book. Is it just gonna be trial and error until he doesn’t think us trying is funny anymore? And that doesn’t even start on how we get everything else back if he doesn’t want to deal.”
small dog?”
Step one is post-breakfast dishes. Cas helps tidy up the kitchen in silence, but the silence is comfortable. Meditative, if Dean was a meditative guy. Calming, because Cas fills up the space. Cas makes the kitchen feel full and bright and warm when it’s just the two of them putting things right again. Jack and Sam bring dishes in, and then Sam goes to do more research, and Jack sticks close to Cas.
“All right.” Cas sounds pleased, in a shy, surprised kind of way, and he gives Dean’s shoulders a squeeze before his hands fall away, so that they could move back to the bedroom.
Dean rises, and Cas already misses just having him near enough to feel the dip in the mattress.
Dean changes into his pajama pants-- ones he’d chosen, ones he’d bought for himself at the store, he’s still not quite over that. When he’d first moved into Jody’s, she’d had some clothes for him, and they hadn’t been so different from the things he used to wear when he was free. Jeans and henleys and flannel, and a sturdy jacket that stood up to the weather pretty well, some basic sweats and undershirts that he’d slept in, and those things were all comfortable and he liked them, but it was an embarrassingly long time before he realized he could pick things out for himself. Even with money to his name.
He leans over to find the travel-sized tube of lotion buried in his duffel bag.
“I do.”
sometimes, even with how little they’ve really started to do. It’s a lot, to face the way Cas loves him head-on. He doesn’t know if he’s ever going to feel like he deserves it, except when Cas works him down into that place where he stops worrying, and then… then it’s okay, to be loved. It leaves him shaking but it’s good.
“What?” He stares at it, numb for a moment, helpless. Unless Jack has Cas’ phone somehow, but why the hell would Jack call him from Cas’ phone, wouldn’t he know--?
… you’ve hurt him enough.”
“Sam’s not much better than you are when it comes to cooking anything other than salad-- although he’s a freak for salad, so that works-- but he’s
“It can be.” He chuckles, trailing fingertips up Dean’s back. “We are free now… I confess a certain eagerness, to meet your every desire.”
“Figured it was time I introduced you to the all-time greatest rock band ever.”
Dean’s a dead weight, insensate. Sam is struggling to get him up off the hard floor when his phone rings, and he lets him slump back down with a groan, answers without a glance at the screen.
He picks his time carefully, to come into the center, wanting to cause as little disruption as possible. It means he winds up in the staff lounge with just Rowena, the center’s resident midwife-- and Castiel's sister-in-law. She settles in next to him, cup of tea in hand, and he lets the fact that the room is otherwise still take the edge off of his nerves.
“Okay, look… this? Is not the kind of conversation most friends have. But since you’re an angel and you don’t… like, do this stuff, we’re gonna… We’re doing this once, and then we’re gonna drink and pretend it didn’t happen. I mean…” He groans, looking at the adorable scrunch of confusion on Cas’ face.
“Yes, pretty much. There might be a little less to do… but in the next couple of weeks I might get your help with planting-- cucumbers and tomatoes will be ready to go into the ground. The next row of planting beds.”
I will not follow you. Either we both live, or we both die, but I will not sit here wondering which it is. I will be with you.”
“You’re a friggin’ weird little dude, huh?” Dean crouches, offering his hand for Tybalt to sniff, marveling over the texture of him when he immediately decides he would like to be petted-- the little patches of velveteen-soft ‘flocking’, and the wider spans of baby-soft skin. “He’s really warm.”
“And you swear this is not a ‘set-up’?” He presses.
“I don’t really-- The butchers at the farmers’ market sent that along for you all. But I’ll tell them next w-- well, if I go… I’ll pass it along when I see them.”
“We might not make it, next week.” Gabriel says without preamble, as he and Rowena help get the truck loaded for the market. “Got an appointment we’ve been trying to move, but it’s been a real bitch.”
“Right. Yeah. No, that’s fine. Growing boy’s gotta learn sometime.”
“I really wish you wouldn’t do this.” He blurts out, steps from the door. “Fighting Chuck, just-- there’s gotta be another way. Something where you’re
.” Cas places his hands at Dean’s waist, turning him, moving him to the edge of the bed. His hands move from waist to shoulders as he urges him to sit. “I will be here when you wake.”
“Technically I wasn’t ‘killed’.”
Jack is kneeling next to them now, eyes wide and wet, uncertain. Dean can feel Sam at his back, a moment of hesitation before there’s a firm, steady hand on his shoulder.
Well, that’s the first Cas has heard about the offer… then again, it’s not as if he’d have argued against it if they’d come to him, and the little detached unit is their property to offer. If Rowena isn’t using it as a personal base of operations-- and he supposes she must be preparing for parental leave, getting ready to focus on their own babies-- then the space is just sitting there unused. Sam could stop wasting money on a motel until he finds his own place, and as an added bonus, Sam being here on  the farm means Dean spending more of his free time here on the farm…
“Wondering how you were doing. Also.” Some of the torpor vanishes from Dean’s tone in a nervous cough. “With the… farm stuff. Not thinking about you, uh, inappropriately.”
“And I got that marinade bottled up for Rowena, you let her know.”
“I heard you.” His hands keep moving, soft, over Dean’s face, his hair. Like he’s some skittish horse Cas is trying to gentle. “I
happens, you can, uh…”
He doesn’t know how to explain that it isn’t a matter of ‘ready’, so he lets it go. He’s been happy most of his life not worrying about ‘hanky-panky’-- he’s been happier without it, actually. And yes, just once, he caught a whiff of someone who could have, in another life, been the one, but he’s not missing anything by not throwing himself out into the dating scene.
again.” Dean laughs. “I-- Hell, I thought… I thought a lot of things, I dunno. Look at you, man. All grown up. You’re gonna tell me everything, I wanna know… I wanna know everything, okay?”
“I can’t believe you’re going to be the grown-up in the house.”
“I have a phone.” Dean smiles over at him, picking Cas’ up anyway and opening it. “Eighty-two fifty-eight… Tybalt?”
“Your raw chicken is really into this stuff.” Dean says. Cas can feel Tybalt settling on his mid-back. “Hey, you, behave.”
“Mm.” Cas frowns, glancing over towards where Tybalt is napping, belly-up on his chair. “That’s… something to discuss, I suppose, if he intends on getting one right away. Of course there is ample space… and I’m sure he would be diligent about training, we could easily set up a run so that it’s tethered when it’s outside and it can’t get into any mischief with the planters or the chickens Rowena wants to get now that the coop is repaired…”
“I won’t have any help with the stand, so I might not…” He takes a deep breath. “Unless-- Are you busy on Mondays? Because-- I could pay you, of course. If you might be available, to help out?”
“How can we run out of water? You just… boil it, man. There’s water all over the place, it’s still gonna rain some of the time and we get more water. Starving is gonna be a problem, ‘cause I don’t know shit about farming and it’s a little late to learn, and hunting and fishing are out because there are no animals. So I mean we’re boned. Are we done hugging?”
“It’s friggin’ weird having your doctor give you, like… medically recommended sex toys.” Dean snorts. “Got a list of reminders for eating and stayin’ hydrated and like… when to take lukewarm baths and crap, but... at least whatever happens with it, I’ll be alone and I can just… take care of me.”
“Yes-- I was just thinking about you, actually.”
Cas laughs, soft and beautiful, infused with sex, and he gives him one of those looks again, soft and heated, his head rolled to the side, his eyes half-lidded…
More like Dean’s never made a conscious decision to keep his back turned, and now it seems like until they decide to go for it, it’s more polite? He doesn’t know whether that’s going to be a big part of things, with them. He’s not really ready to have that conversation, he’s still dealing with the fact that he’s got Cas back at all, and some part of him won’t relax and accept it. There’s still too much hanging over them, and maybe the Empty can’t take him back the way he is, but a lot of other things can.
“I think I-- I think I need to come…” He pants, fingers winding into Cas’ hair. “I can-- I can go and rub one out real quick in the bathroom, or… you can watch me.”
“Tybalt. I mean, no. I mean, he’s a cat.” He shakes his head-- at hearing his name, Tybalt rises, ruining the raw chicken illusion as he stretches and turns with a little ‘mrrp’. He hops down from the chair and trots over to circle Castiel’s ankles.
“Mm. Well, there’s plenty of space between us and the nearest house, I suppose.” He nods, attention split between the conversation with Rowena, watching Gabriel through the sliding glass door, and watching Dean fuss over the pot on the stove. He’s never actually seen their nearest neighbors, thanks to a combination of fencing and trees, though he knows the closest house is somewhere to the right of Gabriel and Rowena’s, and he thinks it’s a smallish cottage with a fair amount of land. “Perhaps they’re parents themselves and they know it passes.”
Anyway, feel free to scream with me in the comments, like... as much as I'd love to know what people think of my first SPN fic I am also down to just talk to other people who are emotional about this.
“You deserve to be happy, Dean… and you deserve to want things, and to get them. All the things that were taken from you, or tainted for you, they don’t make
“Perfect. If the other place didn’t work out, this is certainly convenient.”
“We good? You think sharing a bed’s gonna work out tonight?”
“It’s not.” He chuckles. “Unless you feel
He’s lying on the floor. Again. Scattered bottles. Again.
“Okay, well don’t get ahead of yourself.” She laughs. “You won’t see that part until the second one.”
“So… you never really know what kind of day you’re gonna have, with your leg?” Dean asks him, as they sit down to sandwiches again, and then he curls in on himself hard, some part of him expecting to be punished for the grand crime of curiosity.
“Profound?”
Cas offers to draw a bath for Dean after a long day earning his place on the strike team... then he offers to keep things fair.
Cas shivers and moans, bucks up into his own hand, and Dean’s afraid to kiss him, but he lets his hand slide from Cas’ wrist, up to his hand, up to his cock. Starts working it with him, slow and steady, feeling the heat of him, incredible...
“Yeah.  Me, too, bro.” He tugs Cas’ other hand over to rest on his belly. “You’re going to be a good uncle. We… had a garbage childhood. But my kids… they’re not gonna live like that, they’ll never know what it’s like not to have the people around you just love you, everything you are. Thanks, for that.”
Yes, things had gone a little sideways, the second time, but Dean’s third Saturday is going more than well enough to make up for it. They’d been light on work, with Cas expecting one more spring frost before they could plant his cucumbers and tomatoes, and so he’d tried to do something a little better than cold sandwiches for lunch, hoping an additional week of watching cooking shows might have made an improvement in his abilities.
“Well, look at you!” Donna pushes forward and grabs Sam’s hand. “Oh, gosh, aren’t you a tall one? Well it sure is nice to meetcha, everything Dean’s told us about you, you were a little kid.”
“It’s my spine, actually. But, yes. I mean, sometimes I have an idea about what tomorrow will look like, but… it’s good days and bad days.”
“Hey, Cas. You, um, doing better?” Dean nods to him, indicating the lack of cane.
The garden is getting to be too much. Castiel knows it is, but he can’t bear the thought of losing it.
“I didn’t--”
“I think I can understand that.” Cas says, so steady, so free of judgment. He likes that. Cas doesn’t rush to coddle him every time he opens up about shit that’s bad. Maybe because he and Jody have both been trained to deal with trauma and the people who’ve had too much of it. But also because that’s just Cas-- he cares, and he’s gentle. He loves Dean so much he aches just to think about it sometimes, and he’s always ready to protect him when he can, when Dean needs it, but he trusts him, too. And he knows what it’s like, he’s seen shit, he’s grown up being controlled just as much as Dean ever was, even if the details are different. He knows being messed up over something sometimes doesn’t mean you’re falling apart, and he knows sometimes… sometimes you just gotta be able to talk about your messed up shit like it’s normal. Because it was his normal, and he can’t have a big chick-flick sobfest every time he wants to open up about one little thing.
It’s nice, being tempted-- not fully aroused, and anyway he thinks he’s too tired out for that, but… tempted at all, like this, getting to appreciate the view, wanting just to touch a little, to know whether Cas has sensitive spots he’d like Dean touching, to know… to know how it would feel to kiss his way across that chest, to run his hands over bare skin, to touch the way he wants to, just… above the waist stuff.
“Right.” Dean swallows. “I’m just… helping you out. So, if you’re ever, uh… on your own, and you… if
be happy ‘cause you built a family, only if you let yourself enjoy it you’d lose it. They’d lose you.”
“It’s true, when I started work I got a scented candle and a bunch of carrots.” Charlie nods.
At no point in his life before Cas did he ever have room to
“Where else would I be?”
He hides in the bees a little longer.
It’s definitely the stupid part of Cas agreeing to that, though he might have agreed anyway, just from the way Garth and Jody and Donna all light up at the idea of Dean taking on a new challenge.
“Is it way too much if I maybe stay in your room? I’m with you on taking it a little slow right now, just… I swear, nothing’s ever made me feel as safe as the way it smells in there. And I’m, it’s… you know, I get my full four hours a night nowadays, but I’m told that’s like… half as much as normal people sleep, so… maybe if I was sleeping close to you, it’d… it’d feel right.”
“The good is there.” Cas’ hand finds his leg, for a clumsy pat. “We’re still… alive.”
Or maybe they kiss.
“Now nothing. We don’t have a plan. We don’t have a weapon. We don’t have a bargaining chip. We got nothing.” Dean frowns, but he lets Sam help him to carry Cas, Jack hurrying ahead to let them back inside.
“The job is his to accept.” Cas promises. “I’m… I’m sure he’ll want to talk to you about everything before he signs a contract-- this lunch is just to let you reconnect in a way you’re comfortable with, and to spend as much time as you’re ready for with him. With all of us around you, or one-on-one, that’s your decision completely, you can make up your mind or change it whenever you feel like. And if Sam likes what he sees here… I hope he will take the job.”
“He’s gonna be a lawyer.” Dean murmurs, eyes closing. “That’s the job he’s gonna do, my little Sammy. Great big alpha lawyer.”
Cas works his lotioned hands up Dean’s back, after, lets his hand rest a long moment at one shoulder, and then he’s getting Dean’s panties back in place, and sliding into bed to hold Dean close, in his arms and in his wings.
He think about being bitten. Claimed. Something no one’s ever bothered to do to him before… Dean belonged to Alastair as an object, a plaything, never a person. He was below that. The idea of actually being mated would have been absurd even if he’d been the only one. When he was young enough, he could be passed around as a pretty little thing, tormented but left more or less unharmed. Bruises that would be quick to fade, but no scars that would spoil the picture he made when given to some business acquaintance to use for a while. The first couple of years after being sold to him, it was… bad, but he had no idea how bad it would get for him. How once he looked like an underfed beta pretty-boy more than a ‘proper omega’, not pretty
“How could you be? Dean… after everything that you went through, after all the work you’ve put into recovering from it… how could anyone look at you and find you wanting?”
Could he kiss him, the way Cas would want to be kissed?
you, in a way that is difficult for me to explain. I am bound to you by choice, but I am bound.”
“I… I used to be-- and now, everything’s… God, and I remember him, this little shrimpy twerp, you know? Real smart-ass at Scrabble. This kid who’d look at me like I… like no matter how I presented, it didn’t matter to him, ‘cause I was his cool big brother. ‘Cause I taught him how to tie his shoes and make macaroni and cheese, so if I ever… if I ever wasn’t there to cook for him, he’d be okay. I can’t just fucking fix this with mac and cheese.”
“You really think I could fix cars for a living?”
“Oh. She didn’t say.”
“I’m glad they’re getting along so well.”
“You’ll do great.” Jody adds, clapping him on the back. “You’ve got the all-time record holder to coach you.”
“Sure thing.” He says, and lets himself be drawn in. Locks the door behind them and strips down to tee shirt and boxers, watches the ceiling as Cas changes back into the old sweats and the Icarus tee.
“The market’s different, it’s… we work next to the same people for a season at a time, we barter sometimes… The only other place I really go is the library.”
, was inspired to move up here and devote his career to helping strangers because of how you loved him, and how he lost you. He spent years waiting to hear about you, any kind of word about you, waiting hoping your father would bring you back… After ten years, maybe he’s afraid to hope, but he still gave me your name. I expect he wants you more than anything. He and your uncle.”
to hear that he’s good at being one. And confidence is sexy on him, too, the way he puffs up whenever he’s reminded of the faith Dean puts in him. The drive he has to be a good alpha by giving, not taking… yeah, Dean’s beginning to see how much he could like that drive being applied here.
“Just eat one healthy dinner, and I’ll carry you back to bed to feed you fudge.” Cas promises, and that sounds like a pretty good deal.
“Good or bad?”
“Technically.” Sam frowns, looking between them. “But Cas needs to be one of them.”
He guides Dean to the truck, not examining the feeling this time. Once they’re on the road, box on the seat between them bearing gifts for Jody’s place, burritos rapidly devoured, he feels better, anyway.
“Yeah, absolutely.”
. One who forms the highlight of Cas’ week, whose approval he seeks, whose smile makes him smile, whose laugh makes him laugh.
“Sam. Pleasure.”
Hope? Faith? Those are concepts so utterly tied to Cas that Dean doesn’t know where to look for them if he hasn’t got him. If he taught Cas about love, about happiness, well… Cas has changed him just as much. Of course it’s terrifying to face losing that. But he’s always dealt with terrifying before, why can’t he man up about it this time? Why can’t he turn his own brain off for a movie?
“That’s… an answer.” Cas raises an eyebrow. At least now that he has a last name, he can focus his paperwork search. “I’ll be entirely honest with you, Mister Winchester, we have never kept a lawyer on for very long. It is a long, hard road to be on the right side of history, and we’re not a very big organization. The pay is modest, compared to the going rate for a good lawyer, and true altruists… some burn out, some move on to bigger arenas and louder fights, they lobby in the capitol or they look for cases that bring publicity to the issue… The work here may be more grueling than interesting.”
“Exactly.”
“What’s your favorite thing?” He asks, after the subject of their shared history of kidnapping and confinement comes up. “I mean about being out now. Mine’s lemonade. Or toilet paper.”
“Whatever you’re having, then.”
“Oh.” He turns away again. His hand starts moving, slow.
Their fingers are twined together, loose and comfortable, sock feet on the coffee table, well in each other’s space. Dean’s head is a comfortable weight, his body warm beneath the afghan slung across both their laps, his stomach full under Cas’ other hand. The volume on the television is turned down low, a movie Dean’s seen a dozen times or more, and Cas’ hearing is good enough…
Dean is hovering over the refreshment table, but when he spots Cas coming in with Garth, he moves over to join them.
Garth eventually makes it to the other side after him, muttering a soft ‘oh boy’ at the monkey bars-- still, he’s not truly daunted. Even if his arms are sore after the ropes, he has fun with this part.
“Shut up. Yes.” He lets Sam fold him up in a hug, and just kind of sinks into it. “Bitch.”
He hauls Cas in at that, kisses his cheek with the same deliberate slowness Cas had treated him to the night before. One kiss, then two, three kisses, then four. Until he’s shaking, until he has to wrench himself away and gulp down air and deal with the fact that it takes so little to strike him so deeply.
He nods, hand now smoothing Dean’s hair back. “I’ll arrange the picnic-- Jody, you know where the tables are. And… we’ll try to get Garth there, at least. Maybe your doctor. I want… I want your brother to know that you’re-- you’ve been safe, you’ve been healing, you haven’t just been turned out on your own after being rescued, or--”
“But they still held views you reject.”
at the core of him building. Dean holds his legs open and lets the rest of him just melt, until he’s shaking apart under Cas’ careful ministrations, until his legs are bouncing against his hold like he’s on a caffeine overload, the muscles in his thighs and his belly twitching, his dick and his hole twitching, too. Can Cas see that, the way at least one part of him does ache to be filled up on his own terms?
“Hot.”
He nods, slipping out of his boxers, leaving them and his pants tangled on the bed with the rest of their discarded clothes.
“Choking… what? Dean, I’m very concerned right now about the ramifications of an angel choking a bishop.”
He’d left him there for a while, rolled him onto his side and focused first on cleaning the place up because it was easier than trying to move Dean.
Garth bops out of the room with a nod, and Dean follows, and so Cas trails behind them, just staring, as Garth gets the tools and Dean proceeds to get the Lincoln up and running.
“No. It is. Because I knew… I knew what was… We didn’t have time for anything else, we had one shitty plan and he told me… he told me. And I knew I couldn’t… if I stopped him, we would both die, I would still have to watch him die. And I knew…” He gulps down air, his shoulders shaking. “I knew what he wanted. Summon the empty at the right moment, take Billie with him. Spare me, so one of us could make it back to you and Jack to try and save the world. He knew it was a suicide run the whole time… I just-- I don’t know. A part of me hoped… hoped if I could make it back we both would. I think he knew when he said he’d go with me that he… A part of him knew. Maybe not what would happen, but-- knew that he’d die for me, at least.”
“That’s all right.” He laughs. “I have developed a preference. However, I have not explored it.”
“You like ‘em, then?” He mumbles, his lips against Cas’ throat, nose filled with the smell of him. Honey and dandelions, sunshine and rain, the tang of a coming storm and the peace of a summer evening. And soap, Dean’s peppermint soap. One of Cas’ hands is wrapped around his shoulder, right where they both know its imprint used to be, and he wonders if Cas misses seeing it there like he misses wearing it.
“I am sorry-- I’m… trying to learn to cook. You’ve probably figured out just how disaster-prone I am in the kitchen by now. It’s… a lot of salads and peanut butter sandwiches, around here. I managed to burn spaghetti once, and… I grew up in an environment where I was not… expected to learn to take care of myself. To be fair, Gabriel wasn’t, either. Which is about the only fair thing I think you can say about the rest of our family… When we wound up on our own, it was…” He snorts, gesturing with his sandwich. “I do some pickling, and I’ve learned how to make a couple kinds of candy, mostly because my sister in law can be a very patient tutor… but it felt like it would be an imposition to ask someone to teach me to cook, the candies are business, really.”
Sam doesn’t know how to fix this. He knows it’s bad… he knows Cas is gone, the one place Dean can’t get him back from. He’d thought Dean handled it badly the last time, but this…
“No. I don’t. But I will.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “A lightweight one, yes. He’s normally dressed-- when it’s chilly, he needs the help, and when it’s not, it keeps him from getting sunburned-- and I’d like to see you try to keep a cat from finding a sunbeam.”
“Dean…”
“Thank you…” Cas smiles, as much as the split lip allows. “Dean? I love you, very much.”
to wait to ‘blow’ you. I may have to do so in the shower. Still… that would be acceptable to me if it is to you.”
“I doubt this plant is going to harm me.” He says at last.
about making yourself the kind of presence that our clients can feel safe around. You’ve also seen a lot of the cruelty that some alphas are capable, including members of your own family. I think it’s easy to internalize a lot of the worst of what we see here, and I think it’s easy to forget, when that’s what you see and deal with, when you hear about it even when working remotely, that that behavior isn’t born of true alpha instinct. Those are just choices that some people make, and when they make the choice to hurt others, some people need to tell themselves it’s natural, it’s what anyone would do. But we know that’s not the truth.”
“Alex, um… Alex really liked one of the sausages. And burger night was big, Krissy liked that a lot, and she’s not real picky about food much, but… everyone liked burgers. Jody got a lot of use out of that chicken, she made a big casserole and a pot of soup, so… any of it’s good.” Dean shrugs, and he presses a little closer to Cas, taking a deep breath. “Do you have bacon?”
“No, dude, take care of
“And he
“You don’t understand.” He shakes his head, and the tears are falling now.
“You’re a good man, regardless of designation.”
He shifts, lets Cas have as full and unobstructed view as he can give, and it’s just for fairness’ sake this time, just to share everything with him, but it still feels good, when Cas gives him a quick, shy once-over.
“I am what I am now because of you.” And he says it so matter-of-fact, like nothing about that is super fucking romantic. “It stands to reason that the bond between us would therefore make for… intensity. I am not an angel, but I am
“Perhaps… you will design a tattoo for me, next. So that I have your permanent mark upon me, too.”
“Okay. I’m good.” He says, but hazy nightmare memories are starting to filter back to him, and maybe ‘good’ isn’t the word.
Dean is a surprisingly charming salesman, despite his earlier anxiety about being around a crowd for the first time since his rescue. He winds up chatting to a growing group of young women, betas and omegas alike just as thoroughly charmed as they usually are by Gabriel. There’s a slightly different spin to the way he casually flirts with customers, how it comes off as friendly and social rather than an earnest play is the same but the style is different. Still, he can see what Gabriel meant, when he said he and Dean had their similarities. If Dean hadn’t lost ten years of his life the way that he did, he might have the same loud and carefree swagger, but even with all he’s been through, there’s just… something there. Something bright about him. He
Cas comes back from the dead at full angelic strength and sweeps Dean off his feet... literally.
“No, of course.” He turns away, faster than Dean thinks he should be able to move, his expression tight. “You don’t… you don’t want that, from me. I understand, of course. I…”
“Cas? Wait-- For real? Dean said you were-- gone-gone, man.”
“I… I kind of meant after, I thought maybe that would get me through to after. You know. Something to… fight for. Look forward to?”
Usually he moves around, usually he’s satisfied to bring a kind of an even glow to the surface. This time, he delivers each stroke to the same spot, until there’s a nice, sweet ache there.
“I take a shower every single day.” Dean says. “The water pressure? Fantastic. And the water’s hot. And the door locks. I got towels, I got soap.”
“Uh… y-yeah, I mean…”
, let’s go!”
“Great, all right.” Dean shifts in his lap, he feels sparks again. “Take off your coat and stay a while?”
“Well, uh, let’s just say number five is Parenting. And if you’re acting as pack leader, you’ll probably have some of those instincts come through as an uncle, but I wouldn’t worry about it too much-- the first three is where you want to start, and when you’re comfortable talking about Procreating and Parenting, we’ll get into it. But you said you’ve never been in rut, so… I don’t want to throw all that at you  too fast. Look, some alphas have naturally low drives, where, uh, procreation is concerned. It’s unusual not to have ruts-- some alphas prefer not to engage in sexual activity with a partner outside of their ruts, some have fewer or less intense ruts… I think that it’s something to look at, because never having one is unusual, but I also want you to know that it’s okay if you do the work to untangle any trauma around your sexuality and what you find is that you just aren’t built that way. If it doesn’t cause you distress, I’m not going to label it as unhealthy just because it’s outside the norm. But it sounds like you’re not sure right now yourself-- you’re used to pushing your inner alpha down because you’ve been worried about what you’d find, or about loss of control… and a first rut  can definitely feel a little scary. It feels like a loss of control, because your body is going through these extremes. But a healthy, natural rut isn’t stronger than your own sense of self-control, and it can’t make you do something you don’t want to do. It can’t make you hurt someone-- but it can sometimes be hard to get your equilibrium when it’s something you’re not used to yet, and most alphas get a couple of false ruts early on. Plus it’s totally normal to spend your first few true ruts alone.”
“Just my coat?”
is a ‘big negatory’, Dean.” Cas interjects, complete with air quotes. “Where you go, I go.”
He calls a halt to the war meeting when he can feel Cas listing, and Sam frowns and nods. It’s not like they have much of a game plan at this point. They’ve moved on from all the things they don’t have, but the list of what they do is coming up short. They’re stuck playing defense for now.
He doesn’t make a big production out of it, crying. A couple big sobs, and then it’s just intermittent sniffling, tears that hit the pillow or soak into the collar of his shirt, the shaking of his shoulders. He gets it all out, the tears run dry, his throat feels thick and his head feels stuffy but he’s a little bit lighter.
Whatever he’s been through, Castiel won’t look up, though some of it will be a matter of record he could easily access. Dean will confide in him or he won’t. But… Rowena had said it was a lot, and it’s clear he’s made progress. Those little flinches or half-panicked moments of indecision spoke to his past, but he’s controlled himself well enough, and it’s heartening to watch him at work, to see the way the muscles of his back and shoulders move beneath his overshirt, or the way he pauses and tilts his face to the sun when it breaks through the clouds and cascades over him. He hadn’t realized how badly he really has missed working in the center, but seeing Dean, his moments of confidence and his obvious resilience… Castiel helped to build something that helps people. Whatever he feels about himself on his worst days, he helped to start this, and the thing he helped to start makes a difference.
Saturday is fast becoming Cas’ favorite day of the week.
“Hey.” He whispers, hand moving to Cas’ cheek. “You, uh… you go ahead and rest up, uh… shit. Here I am thinking I’m never going to get you back, swearing up and down if I
“Always.” He relaxes, stroking up and down the back in question. Dean’s confidence in him is an incredible thing-- few things come close to the kind of calm he gets from that perfect trust. “I have plenty of closet space for you, probably more than you need, but… there’s room in this house for you to put things in. Walls you could help decorate. I’m yours-- that means what’s mine is yours. And… if there’s any way I can make this place a better home to you, well… say the word.”
“There’s been a lot of time when, if you’d said what you said back there, if I knew what you meant, maybe I’d have to run the other way. But things aren’t like that now. Anyway… Sam and I are going to save the world, maybe. I’d like it if you woke up sometime, but don’t-- don’t worry about it. I’ve got this one. Next apocalypse is yours. Just… keep breathing. Be here, so if I come back… when I come back, I have you to come back to. This isn’t goodbye, you hear me? Because I do, okay? Because I do, I-- I feel that way, about you, I… love you. Maybe I always have. And I’ve got work to do, but-- So this is just… I’ll see you later. Yeah?”
. I can help you with finding journals, reference books, articles, news stories. Anything you need.”
“I think Bobby would’ve killed him if he didn’t. It was a couple months before we really heard from him. He called and said he got a lead on the guy but that he and you were both long gone, out of state. Week or so after that, he sent a bunch of money, and then… I dunno. We heard from him less and less.”
“I look forward to it. To seeing you both.” He adds, nodding to Dean. “Thank you again for all your help today.”
you?”
Cas bursts into a smile of his own, hugging them both.
He leans back enough to give Cas a grin-- delight, mischief, surprise, interest, pleasure, happiness-- and a sweeping look.
“If you believe for a moment that I could leave you now… please tell me where I’ve failed. How should I love you better? There is
He probably means lingerie, or at least stuff in that vein. Stuff that would make Dean feel soft and pretty. And Dean thinks it’s way too early into this thing, to ask about a collar. Though what he wants is a lot more serious than that.
“Looking for a touch of grey, got it.” He says, with a brittle grin that falls away too quick. “Dead-- Yeah. Or, um. No, I got ya. I’ll get to work.”
part of yourself for that. For me.”
“Great. Well. I--  I’ll call you after it’s over?”
“We won’t make a move until I’ve got something. But we have to be ready. If he comes to us? We have to have a plan in place, even if what we’ve got isn’t very good.”
“Do you mind?”
“If this position bothered me, I wouldn’t have said I was good.” Cas says, and Dean can practically hear the eye-roll. He pauses for a moment, before the long strokes resume. “Or did you mean the scars?”
“Two alphas and I’m doing the heavy lifting?” Gabriel says in mock-complaint.
“It’s the same way we always drive.” Castiel sighs, taking a hand off the wheel long enough to give him a pat.
“Nah, it’s stopped. But if you keep talking, you’ll start it up again.” He takes Cas’ hand and brings it to his lips. “I’ll get you later, sweetheart, don’t you worry about that. Better not get erased from existence before we get to…”
No. They’ve been sun-kissed to his skin over the course of the warming spring, the time he’s spent working in Castiel’s garden.
“There. That’ll keep you warm.” He touches his hair. “Warm enough. Now I’m gonna sit right here while you sleep, and I ain’t moving an inch ‘til you’re doing better.”
“I came to Earth as soon as I could, where is he?” He demands, before Sam can bring up testing him before letting him through. “Your brother prayed to me in unbelievable agony.”
“It’s really wonderful. Why didn’t you say the place you were looking at was so close?”
“Yeah. You did. I just… I dreamed… I dreamed I thought you came back. Only-- only I went to you and it was Lucifer, and… and you were still-- and I never got you back.”
“He is. Like a living hot water bottle.” He smiles, and Tybalt falls in to help lead Dean back to the door onto the garden, chirruping along the way. “Though when the temperature isn’t so warm, he needs a little help. Do you like cats?”
Maybe they were always doomed.
“Well, let’s try sitting up first.” He says, with a wry smile. Then he stops, brow furrowing as he brings his fingers to his not-so-split lip. “Well.”
“Cas knows what the tryout’s like, Cas probably designed it.” Dean rolls his eyes again, though this time he’s blushing and bouncing on the balls of his feet. “It’s not a big deal, anyway-- you can celebrate when I’m actually on the team.”
“Hm, perhaps it would be for the best.” Cas nods, though he snares Dean’s hand before he can leave, and brings it up to his lips. “I hope I am equipped to help Jack put a handle on what he is feeling.”
He’d say something stupid, like ‘thanks’, or ‘I’m sorry’, something stupid like ‘I love you’, and it wouldn’t sound sweet and profound, it wouldn’t sound like Cas’ ‘I love you’, but wouldn’t Cas know, that he meant it? He’d hold him. He’d hold him, and yeah, he thinks if he kissed him maybe it would be just about right, it would be the thing he’s never let himself look for because Dean’s got one thing in common with Cas, he never imagined himself being
“Dean…”
“Hey there, coming by to check if you got any special order for me this week.” Benny greets, and Cas has never once felt his hackles raise around Benny-- until now, when he casts a curious eye towards Dean, who’s moved to stand in the circle of Cas’ personal space, using him as a shield. “This a brother I don’t know yet? Am I ‘bout to collect the whole set?”
get the rest loaded alone, unless an unexpected flare-up hits. And as little as he wants to ask for help, he knows there are other vendors who would gladly help him get unloaded and set up-- the only other two alphas at the market would
“I got rooms I remember, even if I’d rather forget ‘em.” He says, when he thinks Cas has closed his eyes. “So… you know. I get that.”
“Watch out, Cas.” Dean teases, pausing and looking him over, the picture he makes standing in the doorway. Like he really is this little awkward nerdy guy, and not a powerful and awe-inspiring angel of the lord. “Hang out under the mistletoe like that and you know what might happen…”
“Oh, shit.”
“You’re here.” He presses his cheek against Cas’. “You’re here.”
“Feels like it’s too late.”
They finish their coffee, while Jody catches him up on how things are going for her other fosters-- all good news, and he waves off her offer to gather up mugs and glasses.
“Mm?”
. He wouldn’t want you freaking out like a baby every time he’s not in your direct line of sight, what’s the matter with you?”
Chuck kicks Cas once, hard, Dean hears the meaty thud of the impact this time, the weak whimper. And then Chuck is gone and Dean can move, they can all move. He scrambles up to his knees and crawls the rest of the way, to carefully pull Cas up into his lap, into his arms.
Cas and Dean wind up with similar problems to work through alone... this time.
“... Son of a bitch.”
with awe. “Thank you, for showing this to me.”
Chuck's been kicked to the curb, the lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, Jack's in his heaven, all's right with the world... except, of course, for Dean.
to ask if you needed a ride, but of course if you wouldn’t want to be seen in the ‘pimp mobile’, you’re free to wait until she can swing by to pick you up. I’m sure Garth has plenty of pamphlets you can read if the wait gets boring. Maybe you can have the puppets act them out.”
The plan itself is as solid as anything else they could have come up with-- for what little that’s worth. It’s just that it’s hard for Dean to think about anything that isn’t Cas, in danger, when he’s just got him back. Cas, who Chuck doesn’t want for his grand plan the way he needs Dean and Sam’s compliance. Cas, who’s frail now, depowered, highly vulnerable. And Sam, putting him in harm’s way when they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing, because they can’t break into the fucking book.
me, Beloved. It is your softness that leaves me in awe, it always has been. And your eyes… you have very pretty eyes, you know. Warm and green as new life… bright with the good inside you. Gentle, the way you look at me…
“Can you imagine…” He wipes at his face, has to take a long moment and several not-so-steadying breaths. “Can you imagine sitting next to someone, and… and loving that person, like, in big capital letters, loving that person… but you can’t say it. Because that would open the door just a crack, maybe a crack too wide. Sitting next to someone, and wondering, or even knowing they feel the same, but if you say it, you’re gone. And if you ask for love, that’s worse. Dangerous. I mean it’s one thing if you think, well there’s no point. ‘Cause
He slaps his hand away anyway, but not as hard as he might have.
with that. I’m on this now. Because you, you haven’t been playing. But now? Now I can say dance, little monkey-man, and you’ll dance. After all the time I’ve spent pushing you, and pushing you, and trying to get you to play ball, why would I give this up? I finally get it, I get your real weakness. I get what makes this little troublemaker
, but-- I mean… is it-- Does he look… bad?”
“Jody is far more of an expert than I am when it comes to long-term rehabilitation work… but I’m aware of how she does things. When the center was… Before we had real facilities, before most of the people we work with now, she was one of the first to join Gabriel and I. She would keep her ear to the ground for any news, any potential trafficking operation the police weren’t going to move on. I took on the job of planning our strikes, and she and I would go in together. We took care of the people we saved in our homes-- Gabriel was living with me then, he did… he was better at that part than I was. Jody, though… she does it all, it seems like. We were lucky to cross paths with her.”
“Wh-- what do you mean
Dean’s head snaps up, his expression pure anguish. “What?”
“I just thought you’d be hungry when you woke up. And…” He bites his lip around a frown, glancing between Cas and Dean. “I thought I felt you wake up.”
“I would like that.” Cas smiles.
“No-- Dude, no, of course I haven’t sucked a guy off, like I said, it’s not… It doesn’t… I don’t--”
“I am wholly and entirely into
“Well… I’ve looked at a couple of places, but… I dunno, I’d like to find something pet-friendly. Just thinking about the future, thinking once I am settled, you know… I’d want to be able to fit that into my life, but the places I’ve seen in my budget… either they’re too far out or there’s no chance of keeping an animal, or…”
“Well, when we left, it was…” He pauses, with an almost soundless chuckle. “We rented a trailer and packed it and the car our father bought me with as much as we really… physically
He nods, and Dean gives them both a rinse, before he works up to it, his hand loose around Cas’ half-hard cock, the two of them side-by-side on the bench, the stone smooth and cool against Dean’s heated skin… It’s an awkward position, but then, he’s not here to get Cas off, this time. He just wants to know how it feels to get a hand around him, the weight and heat of that cock in his hand. He doesn’t tease too much, doesn’t want to accidentally take it too far, but it feels good to know. It feels good to be trusted to touch without taking it too far.
“I’ll just have to eat two pieces before I head out.”
“And you…” A hand slips from Cas’ hair, stroking his cheek. “That was you?”
“Am I?”
“Precisely.”
“Well… you know.” He shrugs a little and picks up his own mug, retreating to Tybalt’s chair so as not to crowd Dean on the couch. “Working from my home office and calling in has been working out.”
“Thank you.”
“I would like that, too.” He nods, and he leans in, but he lets Dean be the one to bridge the gap between them.
The coffee is ready, when Jody arrives, and taking the tray back to the kitchen to fix three cups gives Castiel something to do with himself, when he starts to worry he’s poor company, that the silence between them must be getting awkward now. She’s sitting beside Dean, the two of them talking softly, and when he gets back in, he sees Tybalt has taken up residence wedged between them, purring up a storm as Dean grants him tentative pets.
he is. He’d thought it was big enough when he was just getting a glance at the thing clothed, but hot damn… who knew? It’s
No tongue action, but like… it’s
Talk remains mostly inconsequential, until Dean draws Cas off to the side.
… but there’s a beauty in them, they mark him as a survivor. A hero. They tell a story of his strength, and his constant willingness to put himself in front of danger, if it might save others. His family, yes, and his friends, but strangers, too. They mark him as resilient… beautifully stubborn in the face of all life had thrown at him.
Dean winds up squeezing down when she starts, but it’s not bad, it’s the good kind of pain. The first time, he got a little lightheaded by the end, but this time it’s…
“That’s Cas, though.” Sam leans over, reaches out, pats the knee he can reach before withdrawing again to leave Dean his space. “He was always ready to give. And to give something up.”
“You and Jody… maybe Garth, or Gabe, or… Maybe?”
“What ways do you think she protects Gabe?”
Cas opens up to Dean about his own trauma, during a night of shared comfort.
Cas’ instruction had been simple-- While he was at the farmers' market with Sam and Jack, Dean was to do something for himself. Something just for him.
Which in a roundabout way, Dean figures is true.
a ‘little bitch’, you’re allowed to be upset about… about all of this. You’re allowed to have a hard time with it, you’re allowed to cry. We’ll set up whatever feels most comfortable. He could come here while the girls are over at the college, or he could come out to the farm, or you could use Gabriel’s office at the center and I’ll call him back in… Anything you want.”
“Oh-- right, right. Sorry. I’ve-- This is my first interview.” He manages to make himself look small, for all that he’s anything but. His youth helps with the puppy-dog-eyes apology, an odd tactic for any alpha, but especially one that would tower over Cas if they were both standing. But… one that might serve him well here.
“Don’t want to get my shirt wet.” He explains, and he begins deftly undoing buttons. Dean watches, wide-eyed, as the shirt is shed, and he gets his own first proper look at Cas’ chest. Not as hairy as a lot of alphas, but broad-shouldered, thick with muscle. A little softness over his stomach, around his hips, and the skin beneath his clothes is a little less tan, but considering his self-imposed isolation and the reduction in his physical activity since he left the strike team, Cas is
“The fact that I can’t still do it--”
“You wanna take a step back?” Dean offers, half-breathless. “Pick this up again later?”
“Listen, Cas, I gotta go.” Dean’s voice is breathier, lower. Cas isn’t sure if the twinge he feels is desire, or just a desire to care for him. The two feel tangled up right now, impossible to separate out. “I, uh… well, I gotta go. Don’t think either of us is ready for the call this is gonna be if I don’t, but… Talk to you when it’s over for real?”
, Cas is very close to human, in the ways which matter most.”
on pizza man’s cock.
It will be a pleasure and a privilege to hammer the lesson home.
.” Cas says, turning towards him, dressed for bed. There’s an
Capable.
“Well, I’m going to tell you one thing I know about your inner alpha, Castiel. Your inner alpha is the voice in your head, growing up, that knew that they were wrong. That voice that knew being an alpha didn’t mean using your strength to hurt other people, that piece of you that held firm even when they sent you to Naomi, and let her hurt you, that part of you that clung to who you are and what you value no matter how hard they tried to change you.
“Sure. If the couch doesn’t pull out.” Dean grins, grabbing his overnight bag and following Cas out.
“Hello, Dean.”
“I just passed the bar exam. And so… here I am. I thought… maybe you’ll get into a situation where you need a lawyer. And maybe this way, I’ll get into a position where I can help someone.”
“I’m not so certain we ever get to feel ready, for this.” He shrugs. “But we have each other, all four of us. And whether or not we are ready, I take comfort in that. And I had hope… that I could give comfort.”
“I just got you back.” He looks away. “I know I said I’d do anything to have you back for even an hour, but I’m not…”
That’s the thing Cas offers him, that no one else has ever been able to. With Cas… it’s okay, if he just wants to let go and let someone else protect him. He’s never really had that… even when Bobby had tried to let him be a kid, he’d had responsibility beat into him-- usually metaphorically-- too much to let go and not be on guard. Even with an adult who wanted nothing more than for him to be a kid, and who was fully capable of keeping him safe, he was on guard, all the time… It took a lot of time and work to start undoing that damage, and he knows a lot of that is work he’s done on his own, sure, but… having an angel watching over you sure helps.
“Peer socialization and healing. Among other things.” He gives a little shrug and a lopsided smile. “The health team is small but they’re real good folks. About half the department’s made up of omegas. We got people who handle emergency situations, regular check-ups, physical therapy, uh… omega-specific health concerns as well as just general stuff. A lot of clients come in to get their care with us even after they mostly settle into independent life, you know, we keep offering services to anyone who needs us.”
Garth hands his phone over to Donna.
“What’s hummus?” Dean asks, in a low voice.
“I also wondered… when you said ‘when I get back’, did you mean ‘when next I see you’, or did you mean ‘after we save the world’, because I would like to.”
“... Yeah.” He bends to kiss Cas’ neck this time, as he works his way carefully down his spine.
. Safer.”
“Shit. Is that what we’re doing?”
“Well you are taking that out of context. Just, way out of context. Okay, you can’t-- you can’t
“I’m an angel.”
“Excuse you, brother mine? Are you suggesting
“This is… a fantastic sensation.” Cas breathes the words out, his head falling back, the line of his throat a thing of frigging beauty.
“Well… like a dip. Although you could also use it as a spread? I’m not doing as good a job of selling it as they do, but then, I’m… There’s a reason I’m not usually the salesman.”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas says, apparently sensing the moment the threshold between sleep and wakefulness is crossed.
? Many. And you’re not taking a pair of craft scissors to my hair in the bathroom, thanks. Never again.”
“Mm. I believe that I am mortal.”
She snorts at the finger-quotes. “No. He needs to learn to be around unmated alphas again without feeling threatened, you’re trustworthy and you have a job he can do. Castiel, dear… Dean’s been through hell, and I don’t say so lightly. He was rescued some time ago, from one of the Masters’ operations.”
David laughs, handing over the bag in his hand-- from the familiar weight of it, Cas doesn’t need to peek inside. It’s the same trade they make every couple of weeks.
“Gotcha.”
“Well, could you call him?”
“Congratulations. I’m happy for you.”
“Come on, man, just be proud of yourself for ten whole minutes.”
“Hoping. We, uh… we haven’t been that lucky, yet. But it looks like, yeah. We wanted to have a house before things got too far along, wanted things… set up.” He flashes a fragile smile.
“With the baby.” He doesn’t hesitate a moment. “He told me about how they’d been trying, and how it wasn’t certain for a while, but… he trusts her to protect their children, even if she’s never been in a physical fight before-- and I believe that. But more than that… she’s so careful with everything. Everything she’s learned as a midwife, she’s putting into making sure that they stay healthy and safe. Even before all this… she tempers him. He’s always been the wild child, and I’ll admit, when he first brought her home, I thought this was going to be a disaster-- they felt like… well, you know that, uh, air of sheer chaos they put out. I was so sure it was going to be a mess, but… but in reality, they learned how to be more… careful. Grown up. She can be the kind of wild and fun partner he wants, but underneath that, they’re alike in the right way-- they’re both capable of caution and planning, even if you’d never guess it to look at them, and they bring it out in each other somehow, they… they stabilize. And… they’ve both had hard times. I know her life as a female alpha wasn’t always easy, and I know she’s faced tragedies, and I think… after what Gabriel went through-- not just being held captive, because I know he was… when I got to him, he wasn’t in bad shape, but the betrayal coming from our family, that part… I’m very glad he found someone who could understand some of those same feelings, just coming from another direction. Someone else he could heal with. I think she’s been good for him.”
“Kinky.”
somewhere inside him that’s not quite an answering need, not quite sexual. But it’s not devoid of sex, either. The longing is undefined, curious, worlds away from the way an omega’s heat might trigger an alpha’s rut, but… perhaps within the same galaxy.
This place is like…
“See, Jody and Donna are real busy and had to skip out before the social hour, and right now the rest of Dean’s pack is in school. We’ve been talking about how important today is, it’s--” He pauses, turning to check in with Dean to make sure he’s sticking to what Dean’s comfortable with him saying. “Coming to this workshop has been one of Dean’s goals, so I’m really excited he’s here. We had a couple great speakers, too! But basically, well, now that it’s just mingling, I’ve got to spread myself around, you know? So I encouraged Dean to invite a friend so that the whole thing would feel less daunting.”
“I’ve never kissed anyone.” He hadn’t thought it needed clarification. He can feel his face burning, at having to admit to it in words like that, but Dean just cups his chin in one hand,  warm and callused and certain as it had been against his back.
Cas picks it up, while Dean looks skeptically over the array of career-based pamphlets.
Dean shivers once, in his arms, and squeezes him even tighter, impossibly, wonderfully tight.
“Good.” He lets his eyes drift closed as Cas starts the massage in earnest, proving himself. He’s careful but he doesn’t shy away from the scars.
“How was it?” Cas greets him the moment he comes through the door, meeting him with a warm kiss that lands just shy of catching him full on the mouth, but that lingers long enough for Dean to turn and correct the distance.
in-- Before I met you, the only place I ever
And then Dean’s free to shower without eyes on him, which is… He thinks it’s good, but he’d been psyching himself up to be seen for the first time, totally naked, and it’s weird how off it feels when that’s not what happens, when Cas operates from the assumption that not only does Dean naturally want privacy, he deserves to have that respected without question.
“You make the nest and I’ll make the popcorn and cocoa?” He groans, stretching out under Dean’s hands. “That feels good…”
“Our neighbor is a
Cas hums contentedly, and it feels like in the wake of his unloading about his past, a lot of the tension is bleeding out of him. It’s never easy, bringing another piece of bad out into the light, but it feels good to be the guy Cas trusts with his past as well as his body.
“Oh, maybe.” She gives a little shrug and a secretive smile. “We’ll see how it goes. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to sell a few wee hats and booties to fund our parenthood program, if I’m ever short on new bairns to put them on through the center.”
If he could have him back?
“Yeah, and he does it all with just his left hand. On account of it’s the hand he’s got left.”
It’s only after they’re back home, when he’s admiring it again in their own mirror, that he asks Cas what it says.
“Me, too. For what it’s worth, man, if you want to reach out to someone, you should. Don’t get in your head thinking about how anyone else might not be able to handle you. ‘Cause from what I’ve seen, people really like you.”
“Yeah. You know, pointers. Tips? How to switch things up, keep it good?”
“Not your fault.” He shakes his head. “I haven’t… been affected that way in a long time, thinking about it. But… I try not to think about it often. You’re allowed to be curious about my history with the center.”
“I’ll think about it. Guess I oughta think about actually… dunno, working two days a week?” He snorts. “Least until I finish up the GED and figure out what to do with my life. Plus I heard there were food trucks.”
“You know I’m all yours, right?” He runs a hand through Cas’ hair, and then along his jaw. “Gonna show you how you can touch me, okay? No pressure… this is just fun, for both of us. Right?”
“Sorry-- I didn’t want to have this conversation while you were, uh, trapped under a cat. I’m not exactly Mister Conversation, go figure I’d screw this up--”
. Just… another way our father put his stamp on all of us, because it was the exact same car he gave every one of my alpha brothers. So I took it to a dealership, and traded it in for two… older but serviceable ones. I imagine when they get a house, Gabriel will come and pick up the Lincoln, but until then I’m keeping it running. And sometimes Rowena drops him by and he takes it out, when he needs it.”
his imagination. He isn’t tasting the apples Dean had been eating while baking, he’s scenting
, you know? I’m just… I’m just some lousy bum who, who got lucky exactly once in his life. Afterlife. ‘Cause I got you. And you were gonna… just send me on my way and do your own thing and… but you kept coming back for me. You kept coming back for me and I got to… to relying on it. Not because you were a big gun I could pull out, because you were my friend. And… and it got to be I didn’t know what to do with myself, if you didn’t… if I couldn’t… I just wanted you there. Wanted you to stay. I guess I always knew you couldn’t. You had your own stuff… stuff you had to do, places you were needed when I didn’t really need you. But I wanted you.”
“When I started… It’s different.” He sighs, moving onto the raised bed with his carrots-- not raised enough, and he digs his knuckles into his lower back. “I’m not… I can’t do everything I used to do, there’s no point in me coming around when I’d be the opposite of a help to you.”
“You don’t have to thank me. But I mean, that’s… that’s the thing, you know? I’m… all this, the therapy and shit and working out that I’m not what my old man raised me to think of myself, and I’m not what Alastair tried to make me… don’t get me wrong, it’s good to know what I’m not, but… it’s better knowing what I am. I’m good at fixing things… and I’m good at taking care of people. I forgot that about myself, for a long time.”
He hesitates a moment, and then he finishes the homework Garth had assigned him.
“My schedule’s pretty open.” He nods. “So, tell me about how this goes. I mean, I get how it
“Yeah, probably. I don’t know… I don’t know how long he looked after that, I really don’t. I like to think, you know… that he kept at it, not just because Bobby would never let him in the door without you. But I don’t know. He disappeared after a few years… after I went to college, I never saw him again, neither of us did. I don’t know what he ever really found, if he got in trouble with someone else, or if it was just… dad. Getting into his usual trouble.”
work for bacon.”
But Cas gets it. Gets tripping over talking about things neither of them has much real practice talking about, outside of therapy sessions that sometimes feel like pulling teeth and sometimes turn into a sidebar where Dean explains the plot of a movie instead of talking about himself. For Cas, he can imagine tangents about gardening instead, beekeeping. The kinds of lectures he’s teased out of him while they work together, but not in the same easy way. They both get deflecting until they can deal, or even just deflecting from a problem that can’t be fixed to one that can.
“If I have the strength to fight, I will be at your side, I need to know what options we have. Otherwise I cannot be certain, if I would be any help.”
Dean hums, tucks in closer to Sam, his voice muffled for whatever he says next, whatever Sam laughs softly at.
. His secondary gender would have trumped his primary and it would have been a sign that he
“I’m working on that.” Sam promises.
Cas hums and nips very gently at his neck, not too close to the scent gland. “The leather in your scent gets stronger… and you start to smell more like cinnamon. I find it… it makes me want
“I don’t know where his phone is but yeah, he’s-- Wait. Are you here?”
“I would love to. Next time.” Cas drops a kiss to his bare shoulder, his lips warm. “I’d better put on some clothes and make that salad before your brother gets here, though…”
alive
“If you die, I’m taking my shirt back.” He says, because why not make the dumbest, pettiest argument possible?
“I could… it is an incredible waste of my powers.” He says, between slow kisses, and a light scrape of his teeth across soft, warm skin. He drags his tongue higher, until he feels the rasp of stubble. “And I think it would be more fun to use my hands on you.”
The other man nods in agreement, and it’s not as if Cas didn’t know, that this would once have been an undreamt of luxury, but he still aches, not at the reminder, but because of how casually they can discuss it. How naturally.
Well.
The second the words are out of his mouth, though, he sees it. Cas might not be totally healed, but the split lip is gone.
a man, and that’s… that isn’t why I, what I-- But I’m… physically, I’m capable of a fraction of what I was when I started. It’s not a bad fraction, I think if I was in an emergency situation on a good day, I’d be able to act fast enough, and I wouldn’t necessarily hurt myself too badly in the process, but… I won’t always be this capable. It’s not just-- not just finding someone I’m interested in. Gabriel and Rowena are expecting, and I… They moved to live near me, they… they’ve been treating me like pack leader, and… What happen when I let them down?”
This is… different.
“Okay, well… mission accomplished.” Dean coughs, releasing him. “I do not remember what I was dreaming about, and I’m pretty sure I know what my next dream’s gonna be.”
“What do you do when you can’t… can’t protect someone, the way--?” He groans, head dropping into his hands, fluffy shredded bits of tissue getting in his hair as the larger torn pieces float to the carpet. “I don’t
“No. No, I… If I wait until that’s over I’m gonna… I’m gonna overthink it. Rip the bandaid off.”
“Mm. Is this your way of saying you’re lucky to have me?”
“That could work. Thursday, when you’re setting up, if Dean goes with you, Gabriel and I can bring lunch out, and ask Sam to meet us there around noon? Garth, if he’s available. Dean can introduce Sam to his support system, and Sam can talk to a few other people who work with the center, if the job with us is what he really wants... We’ll have plenty of fresh air. And we won’t overlap with the actual training. Unless you would rather wait until after the training weekend?” He asks Dean, stroking his forehead now.
“I killed him, Sammy.” His voice wavers, quiet under the sniffling, the shuddering of his breaths, and he can’t say anything without falling apart, but he can’t hold himself together any longer, either.
Castiel can see the way Dean takes him in, cautious and observant, and he can imagine the way he must look from the outside. He’s shorter than Dean, though he’s built with more muscle-- though, if Dean keeps filling out as part of his recovery, and doing physical work, it’s possible he’d be a match for him as far as physicality goes. The big thing, though, is that today, Castiel’s using a cane for balance, and Dean doesn’t stare or say anything, but a little of the tightness goes out of his shoulders seeing it. However long he’s been with Jody, and however much he’s had people vouch for Castiel to him, there’s a part of him that’s comforted by the visible proof that if he had to run, he could.
“Me?”
To be fair, some people, Castiel wouldn’t respond well to such a question from. Most people, really. But Dean’s… It’s different, with Dean. When he asks, it doesn’t feel
.” Sam reaches over and smacks him gently upside the head. “You’re disgusting.”
Cas is happier than he’s ever been, even with the crying baby. Rowena and Dean have been taking turns with comforting a baby or working in the kitchen. Sam’s still down at the center, he’s working on a legal defense for emancipating an omega minor from a potentially dangerous home situation, and right now it means long hours, but he has a pack to come home to, and Cas has come to appreciate just how big a difference that can make in whether a long, hard day feels good or bad.
to you, in a way that’s never happened before, not for me. And when that man put his hands on you, tried to keep me from getting you clear, I killed him. I didn’t even think about what I was doing. At least, even if someone else in that place had found him and administered emergency care, he’d… he’d have been brain dead, that’s enough to feel a very complicated kind of guilt about. But I certainly didn’t do anything to… to try to minimize the harm I’d done. At the time, I wouldn’t have. At the time, the only reason I didn’t do more to make sure there’d  be no saving him, is because it was more important to get you out, so you could be cared for.”
Cas laughs. The puppets are definitely a quirk, but sometimes a helpful tool. Garth had not stooped to using the puppets with him, when he’d been getting some fairly intensive counseling, but the times that they’ve rescued small children, the puppets help. As something soft and friendly to talk to, or to talk through, or just to hold onto.
He’d been close to home free, when one of Alistair’s goons came out of nowhere, ripped the limp body of the man Castiel could have loved from his arms… even unconscious, the pitiful, pained moan had been heart-rending, and the fight that followed…
“Yes. I’m going to send you directions to the fairground, and the time. Just park near the vehicles you see in the main lot, head through the open gate, and turn left, and we’ll be very difficult to miss, and lunch will be set up. Until then… just take the time you need to process the news.”
“What will you do with the nursery?” He asks, touching one little penciled-in line, showing how tall a little boy once was at age four. For a moment he pictures that child-- there’s not a name written in, but the one that floats to mind is Jack.
He looks happy.
“Possibly not. And even if I did, they might not be so useful… I fear I haven’t got the strength to check just yet. And… perhaps I should check when I’m somewhere where I won’t knock all of your belongings over.”
omega’s suffering and end them as well. It had been a frightening thing to feel, he’d been almost outside of himself, logging all these impulses, these emotions, like it was a stranger. The possessiveness was the part that terrified him most, more even than learning that he was capable of killing someone-- that part had been defense, he could have dealt with it, moved on, eventually returned to the field… but he’d been thinking of the omega he’d acted in defense of as if the man
do, if he gave the command. Said maybe if any of us ever got to be more trouble than we were worth to keep alive, he’d test some things. There were times when I… uh, I didn’t know whether I’d rather be dragged off somewhere by Alastair or have to be in the room with this kid and his dogs. Wasn’t really afraid of ‘em before that, wasn’t… dunno. Wasn’t a dog person like Sammy, but I wasn’t not.” He gives another shrug. “Anyway, trying to, uh… trying to get ahead of that one, working on not freaking out over the idea of being around a dog so Sam can have one.”
“Well, that’s what I like to hear.” He tosses off a wink to Gabriel. “Been a while since I been told I made an omega’s night. Any time you want the same, you let me know, we’ll set some aside for you.”
“Yeah?”
Dean sighs, and feels a little more tension drain away.
“But you’re used to going into the worst kind of places for an omega. It’s not illogical, just a little misplaced. You’re not crazy, Castiel, you’re reacting to real situations you’ve seen, situations that people close to you have been in, situations you’ve had to fight through. It’s okay that you can’t put it all away in a neat little box just because you don’t do that anymore. But, you don’t have to be afraid of unlikely scenarios for the rest of your life, either. When you get those worries, I want you to acknowledge them--
“It’s… along the lines of something he once told me.” He nods. “So I know it’s not easy advice to take to heart when you’re coming down from a moment of panic… but I also know it’s good advice.”
“It’s not like I don’t, I just… I don’t feel… ready, for this.”
“I’m not surprised.” Cas nuzzles into his neck, breathes him in, sweat and all. “Hop in the shower and rinse off and I’ll run you a hot bath? Trust me, a good soak after makes all the difference in the world.”
“Yeah? Part of you’s growing.”
“I won’t if you won’t.” Dean echoes, and Cas rises, and tugs him the rest of the way onto his feet.
“I can see you’ve been a very good boy.” Cas’ voice is low, and the door clicks shut again behind him, but Dean still can’t bring himself to turn around. Not even as Cas’ hand skims up his naked back, curves warm and steady around the back of his neck and kneads away a little of his tension. “You’ve been treating yourself to something you like.”
