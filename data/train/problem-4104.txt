“No, especially after that coroner’s report that you found—the ‘maybe death by suffocation’ thing was weird.” Dean flops onto the bed, outstretched, with a groan. “All I know is that I’m tired. And sick of not having answers.”
Dean waits until Sam stomps out of the room before carefully dialing the number. He holds it to his ear and waits, hearing his own heartbeat vibrate the receiver.
Knowing full well the way Dean would react to the double entendre, “Dean, I wish you wouldn’t peg me under any circumstances.”
“Gabe,” Dean hissed. He took a hesitant step forward, the toe of his shoe tapping at the ground. “Gabriel, where are you?”
Cas can feel Dean’s warmth as he leans toward him, looking over his shoulder as Cas smooths the crinkled paper onto the table with his palm. He doesn’t recognize most of the names on the list, save for the three names at the top, ranked in order: 1.
Humming in agreement, Dean begins to push the cart, once again making their journey. “Let’s keep an eye on them.”
“I don’t understand what is fun about this activity,” Castiel announced, hands shoved in his pockets.
Rather than following Dean inside the house, Castiel continues to contemplate his hat. He feels guilty for the way he is treating Dean. But he knows that it’s all temporary. Whatever friendship he forges with Dean will be snatched away as soon as Heaven deems his mission complete. He’ll return to Heaven, have his grace restored, and continue to fight for Claire’s memories and safety. There will be no room for Dean.
Dean blinks and squints into the dark, waiting for his eyes to adjust. He wishes they hadn’t, once he can see what’s across the room.
“No, Cas, listen.” Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. “I’m trying to ask you out, okay? On a date.”
The Empty wiggled its fingers. “Great plan, isn’t it? Thought it up when your new idiot god came knocking on the door to get Castiel back. I would say pass on the message that it’s his fault, but, well. You’ll all be exploding soon anyway.” Turning toward Dean, its blue eyes flashed. “Now. What to do about
Dean finally gusts out a sigh and reaches forward, snatching Cas’ hand. The touch between them is dry and clammy. Dean’s skin is softer than Cas imagined it being against his own hand. They avoid each other’s eyes.
Dean grunts as he clicks on Faith’s wifi to hack into. She deserves it, anyway. “Got anything useful in there about Vetala? Or psychic attacks?”
“From, you know. Being. You know.” Dean cuts himself off awkwardly and pretends to be really invested in a chip in the wood on Mary’s desk. He knows his mother well enough to feel her scrutinous gaze on him.
“That was our plan,” Bob says with a grin that holds no humor. “Except now we have twice the manpower.”
She sighs explosively. “Okay, fine, Winchester, I know something. But he told me not to tell anybody, especially you. He said he’s ‘working it out for himself’ or some Cas-like bullshit.”
Sam said, firmly, because he knew exactly what his brother is thinking, “You’re not bad for Cas, Dean. You’re not screwing up his life with your friendship. And even if he became human, that wouldn’t change.”
“Guess we’ll only find out if he becomes human." Dean glares at his hands. "Which won’t happen, if I have anything to say about it.”
Cas hitches a gasp when he feels Dean’s hands trail under his shirt, across the bare skin of his stomach. Dean says, close and lowly in his ear, “I kept thinking of what we would be if we weren’t faking, Cas. The whole week. Because it wasn’t fake for me—not for a goddamn minute.”
Castiel wants to tell her that it was her words that inspired him, that gave him the bravery to take the leap — but all he can croak out through dry lips is, “Choice.”
“Yeah. Can’t put my finger on it.” He jams his hands into his coat pockets and straightens. “Just no splitting up, got it? This is one of those times where there’s safety in numbers. You got your knife, right?”
“This feeling of being stuck,” Cas says, breaking a moment’s silence, “what does it have to do with Lisa?”
Castiel stuffs his hands in his jacket pockets, frowning across the playground. “A few of your students are coming over here,” Castiel says softly.
Sam, more of an avid tea drinker, takes his mug without hesitation. “We took your side, Mom, because Dad’s always been clearly in the wrong.”
Snorting, Jen took another drag. “Somehow I believe you on that.” She scratched at her temple with dirty fingernails. “If you’re talking about that small little cave that was there, no, we didn’t find anything. I checked it out myself—lots of kids running in and out of it since the landslide last  month, wanted to make sure we weren’t crushing anyone with our work this morning.”
“Cas and I can still sit by the Jerrys,” Dean says, “but we’ll try to sit higher up than them.” He looks at Cas. “Bleachers aren’t that tall; we can jump down and run after someone if need be.”
The knowledge that Cas, without Dean saying a word, can read Dean and this situation so well slams into Dean like a freight train and leaves him breathless.
Dean chuckles. Looks at his hands for a moment. Then Dean is moving forward and, before Castiel can blink, he’s being gathered into Dean’s arms, enveloped in a warm, strong hug and Dean says by his ear, “Thanks, Cas.”
Dean nodded. Closed his eyes briefly. Sniffing sharply, he plastered a smile on his face before twisting around to Eileen, arms outstretched. “Well, if we’re doing hugs…”
“What example do you suggest I follow, Dean?” Cas asks. “Should I use your countless reckless decisions and penchant for self-sacrifice as a template?”
Not stooping to Dean’s tactics to derail the cleaning situation, Sam calmly slides another Nike shoebox in Dean’s direction.
Standing at the trunk of the Impala, trenchcoat clutched in his hands, shivering in the dark and the rain and knowing he won’t come, he’ll never come back, he’s dead, but waiting all the same.
“Colloquialisms, Cas,” Dean says shortly. He stabs a sausage link and savagely chews it, pointing his fork in Sam’s direction. “I got a rule and you know that. I don’t double-dip. Comes with the job.”
?” Dean snorts. “That’s some slow play. Either you’re the shittiest hunters I’ve ever met or you’re pulling a fast one on us.”
His chair clatters noisily when he returns to the table and sits down heavily, his fingers messily trailing through his hair. “Look, Cas. I’m really sorry.”
of you. I know my own feelings, and I don’t need you two making wild speculations like a couple of loons. Butt out of my love life; it’s my business.” He takes an angry swig of tea and firmly sets the mug on the desk. “I’m going back out to reality with the sane people.”
She stares at him for a long moment; finally, she bursts out a sigh and falls back into her chair. “I don’t know what to think.”
“I’m doing it.” Dean turned to Jack, face firm, knowing if he looked at Sam he would snap again. “When can we start?”
“I think it’s popular on this website for people to show their animals that they raise. I believe this woman has what’s called a ‘hobby farm’.”
Dean chuckles and blows warm air into his cold, bare hands. “No, smartass.” He frowns at his fingers turning blue. “Do wish I brought some gloves, though.”
They sat in silence. The plastic encasing the mixtape clicked as Cas tapped a fingernail against it nervously. Finally, Crowley popped his lips, sighing.
Castiel leans into John’s space, another hand carefully and dangerous curling on his shoulder, close to John’s jugular. “Or, if you prefer the harder way, I will resort to violence. And believe me when I saw that my uppercut is ten times stronger than yours.”
Blinking, a slow smile crosses the man’s face. Dean can’t believe he’s only just noticing how blue his eyes are. “Well, I’m not getting a graduate degree in logic.”
May slams all legs of her chair onto the ground and pitches forward, finger pointed. “Listen, kid. You don’t even
Dean remained standing, his hands shoved into his pockets, rocking back on his heels as Jody dialed the number. He scanned the pictures on the walls: of Alex and Claire hunched over a cake, Claire rolling her eyes but with a small smile on her face, of a small candid one of Kaia and Claire cuddled under a blanket on the screened-in porch. Towards the center of the wall was a large one with them all sitting at the table with Christmas decorations, Donna’s grinning face half-tilted in the frame as she took the selfie over her shoulder. Dean couldn’t help but smile at that one.
the caption had fretted. Dean was ready to scroll past it, when something oozing from the rocks caught his eye—a very familiar, very dark substance. His blood froze.
Sam’s explosive sigh resonated through the hall as Dean marched back to the quiet living room. Claire had moved to the couch next to Kaia, whose arm was wrapped around her shoulder. Sam moved to stand next to Eileen; they exchanged concerned looks.
She has a nice laugh. It makes Dean realize that he’s never heard Cas laugh. What could Dean do to coax a laugh out of that stoic angel? Probably something more intricate than an awkward date story.
George burst to life then, whirling on Dean and grabbing him by the throat. “Where the fuck were you?” he shouted, shaking Dean. “Where the fuck were you when my boy was getting
There’s a loud clang outside the kitchen door in the hallway, the sound of something heavy falling soon after. He places the water on the counter and quickly goes toward it.
Does Cas even realize how gorgeous he is? Even with those perpetually dark circles under his eyes and the underwhelming outfits he wears? “Did you….” He clears his throat. “Um.”
Crickets buzzed lazily around them. A pair of cardinals perched on the branch above them, chirping irritably at each other before flying off. The wind brushed against Dean’s cheeks; a nudge.
“Almost did it,” Dean said, breath shallow. His frame was trembling, and it seemed an effort to get out the words. “Just one more step to do.”
"So she's..." Dean fumbles over his words, trying to control the horrified expression on his face. "She died?"
“Either way. Some of the people that got killed were kind of shut-ins themselves. A few of the victims were married, but the most recent victims? No one knew them very well. The last guy to get killed? He had just gotten a divorce.”
Dean wraps an arm around Cas' shoulders, a fierce grip on his arm. "We'll find a way to get those memories back, Cas, okay? I promise."
Jack placed his hands in his lap, nodding. “Well, as Dean discovered, the Empty is… leaking, so to speak. Portals are popping up all over the world—and since our soul bomb woke up the demons and angels in the Empty months ago, they’re finding ways to escape through these portals.”
“Uh, well…” Dean coughs. “I guess people cuddle but… I’m not takin’ that leap this soon, dude, no offense.”
Dean stops at a red light and drums his hands nervously against the steering wheel. “Is that why you’ve been acting weird lately?”
Dean swiped a hand over his face, taking a sharp sip of the rest of the beer and firmly crushing the can in his hand before turning on his heel, walking toward the sliding glass door into the warm house.
“’Here for Dean?’” John repeats mockingly. He fumbles in the pocket of his leather jacket and withdraws another flask, taking a long draw. “Let me ask you something,
“Sure were,” the man next to her, assumedly Bob, grins. He holds out a hand. “Don’t think we’ve met yet.”
On Monday morning, when Castiel raises his head from his book, expecting to see Charlie for their afternoon coffee in the teacher’s lounge, he instead sees another red-headed friend land in the chair across from him.
“I know him. Nice guy. Runs a diner when he’s not landlording way too many properties.” The man slides the credit card through a small attachment on his phone, frowning again in a thoughtful way. “This might not work, you know.”
Sam and Eileen came stumbling into the war room just minutes after Dean called Sam, barking at him to wake up. Eileen had pulled on a sweater, her hair frizzy from sleep; Sam was in a hastily thrown together outfit of sweatpants and a lopsided blue sweatshirt.
But the words were coming without his control, spilling out of him— “You called him a father, and then you abandoned him. Abandoned
“It’s over, Faith,” Cas says. His voice is surprisingly strong. “We didn’t fall for your mind games. You’re outnumbered. It’s done.”
Dean stared at Cas for another long moment, his brain still rebooting. Sharply slapping his hands on his legs, he turned to Claire. “Nope. You’re good. Show Cas some games.” Marching toward the door, Dean gestured between them. “Gonna make some lunch. You two want anything?”
“Well, I’m full of surprises today,” Dean quips back, putting Baby into drive as Lisa buckles her seatbelt. “You had dinner yet?”
Dean takes a steadying breath. “You know… you’re different, Cas. You’re… I dunno. You seem more comfortable in your own skin. Before, it was pretty bad. Back in the bunker.”
“It’s a kale salad,” Castiel murmurs into his pillow. He can feel his glasses pushed errantly to the side of his cheek, but he doesn’t care.
“There is,” Cas said firmly. “If you were able to consume Amara’s power, then you can reject it, in a sense. Go back to what power you had before.”
“I think he burned that bridge of ‘trying’ a long time ago,” Dean says, scuffing his foot at the concrete driveway, not letting the tingling pain in his gut show on his face.
Cas’s tie askew as he leaned back in the couch seat, a lopsided smile on his face as Liza Minelli sang, the way that Dean’s fingers twitched toward Cas’s hand—yeah. Of course Dean remembered. He fumbled with his wallet, the folds slipping in his sweaty hands.
As Jack’s words rang throughout the room, Dean waited for the ground to swallow him whole. But he stayed, surprisingly, numb. Licking his lips, he asked, softly, “What do you mean ‘gone’?”
Dean nearly bangs his head on the table as he scrambles out from under it. He’s on his knees, staring up at Cas. “You what?”
Castiel is writing the definition of Montague grammar on the squeaky white board when there’s a loud crash in the back of the room.
With a grunt, Dean rolls over to face him. He hesitantly pats the bandage covering half of Cas’ face. “Does it hurt?”
many of my brothers and sisters I thought were dead,” Gabriel explained as they walked toward the war room. “Like Felicity—now
Dean tilted his head, grin widening. “Okay, kid, here’s the thing. We can do this the hard way or the easy way.” He pulled out his fake badge, flashing the emblem. “Easy way is you tell me what I want to know, I move on. Hard way is that I tell your parents where you’re thinking of going tonight, and you get grounded for probably the foreseeable future. Which one you want?”
After the temporary relief of seeing his older brother alive had passed, Sam took in Dean’s closed eyes, his ashy pallor. Dean wasn’t all right; hadn’t been for months.
He can feel the words rise in his throat, but he has no way of stopping them as he blurts, ”Because that’s what people do when they’re in love! They act like assholes!”
“The last time I saw him was probably… I dunno…” Dean whistles through his teeth. “Probably when I was eight or nine.”
From the doorway, Dean rubbed a hand over his face, shaking his head. Could barely open his eyes to watch what was coming next.
“Take care of yourself, okay?” Anna says. “I’ll try to come visit you at Charlie’s work sometime; she doesn’t usually let me come, because of the school’s guest policies. But I’ll try.”
“But we can rent some!” Sam says, pulling out his phone and waving it wildly. “Wichita has a bike sharing program now! You can go anywhere in the city!”
“Yeah.” The man chews at the bottom of his lip, frowning down at Castiel’s fingers that are fumbling to get the credit card out of the tight wallet’s pockets. “You said you biked here?”
Dean stared at the words for another moment. Blinked away moisture in his eyes. Standing sharply, he went to his dresser and yanked open the top drawer, a large bottle of whiskey rolling into view. He sagged onto the floor next to his bed, whiskey in hand, taking a long pull.
He’s clenching and unclenching his hands, indecisive, until his phone begins vibrating violently in his coat pocket. He scrambles to take it out with his stiff fingers and pulls off a glove with his teeth so he can hit the green button on the touchscreen. “Hello?”
“I wasn’t ‘freaking out’,” Dean said with sarcastic air-quotes. “He was just askin’ stupid questions.”
match the files that Cas gave him—mid-thirties, brunette, barely six foot.  “I can see those fake vamp bites from here,” he says, craning his neck to get a better view.
“Just focus on getting him back. Okay?” Sam drew back, wiping at his eyes. “We’ll handle the whole end of the world thing.”
“Jody called Donna down. They’re going to help Kaia track down and take care of the rest of them tonight.”
Dean feels stupid for being in a flannel and boots on a bicycle. Sam keeps reaching over and pinching Dean’s cheek while they’re riding. But then they get to a tall hill overlooking the city skyline, sun setting on the backdrop, and Cas turns around to smile all sweaty and bright-eyed at Dean, the happiest Dean’s seen him in well, ever, and Dean can’t suppress an answering smile.
Shoulders sagging, Sam tilted his head forward, chin hitting his chest. “Good. Okay.” He looked back up, a hopeful smile on his face. “We’re almost done packing. Gabriel’s flying us out in an hour.”
“Jesus, fine,” Dean tentatively putting his arms through the sleeves, wincing at the disturbed bruises on his skin. “I didn’t realize Sam hired a nanny instead of a bodyguard.”
With a large steaming to-go mug of coffee nursed between his hands, Castiel can finally share in Dean’s enthusiasm for the day. “Where are we going first?” he asks as they tumble back into the chilly car.
“Peachy,” Dean shoots back. He falls back into his chair, trains his eyes once again onto the computer screen again.
“It wasn’t.” Dean takes another gulp of tea; grimaces. “I don’t even remember what I said out loud or what was just in my head. I didn’t say anything weird or embarrassing, right?”
“A Vetala,” Sam says on the phone in almost the same beat. “Remember Dad hunted one once? His journal had the measurements of teeth, from what I remember, and they were the same. Well, way smaller than a vampire’s, anyway. Do you have his journal with you?”
of that. Of Chuck saying there’s a fucking story I gotta follow—or that we gotta lose everything, sacrifice everything, that we can’t—that we can’t have—”
Now, Castiel steps forward to the chainlink fence, gripping the cold metal between his palms. The door a few yards away is inconsequential: chipping red paint, rust creeping up its sides. Yet somehow it holds behind it the apex of Castiel’s life; his compass. He knows he won’t be able to breathe easily until Dean comes through that door.
“I suppose,” Cas says with a grimace as he pushes at the back of his neck. “It’s not pleasant, either way.”
Dean closes his eyes, searching for calm, reminding himself that killing his younger brother would undo all of his hard work protecting him over the years. “You
Cas stands at the front doorway; he shuts the door with a gentle click. “Dean,” he says; in that voice that indicates he wants to talk about something serious.
“Then you remember…” The book in Cas’ hand is clenched between white knuckles, “when you were closing the bar? After everyone had gone home?”
in him. I couldn’t resist the temptation to peek into what made him happy enough to fulfill our deal. Completely worth it, I should say,” it added, its hungry eyes roaming up and down Dean’s body.
I’d have to do research before I go anywhere to see if the place is wheelchair friendly. In fact, I’d have a hard time going anywhere that doesn’t have fucking ramps and door buttons. I would have to relearn how to navigate the entire world. Doors would be closed that were never a problem before. And the world was going to look at me and see a burden, an obstacle, or worse, an invalid.
“Cas, if you’re worried I’m not satisfied because you’re a little new at this, don’t be. I am hella satisfied.”
Dean was the one subject to temptation. But today was evidence that Dean could control himself. He got to keep his new client and get to know him more. He couldn’t wait to discover new things each time they were together. And maybe someday, they could even become more than this. Dean wasn’t sure what he was looking for from Castiel, but he knew he was special. Dean wasn’t one to let that sort of chance get away from him.
This was divine. This was ecstasy. He would let Cas do this to him for hours if he wanted. Being tied down took all responsibility out of his hands and forced him to let someone else take care of him. He didn’t mind the responsibility, especially when his partner was as enthusiastic and responsive as Cas. But this was nice too. Dean could get used to this.
Dean’s train of thought was abruptly derailed when Castiel broke the silence. The heated stones rested on Castiel’s back and Dean had let his mind wander. “What’s up?”
“Well, yes… no. Um.” Cas shifted, looking around the garage uneasily. “You see, I think I need to make the request now while I still have the nerve, and I know you’re busy so we don’t have to follow through right now, not to say that I would be oppos-”
“You’ve certainly convinced me,” he said. “Listen, I didn’t mean to be rude or anything earlier, I was just–”
Dean asked him to lay on the reclined table. When he was settled, Castiel looked to Dean like a lost puppy. “Now what?” It was like Dean was subjecting him to some heinous torture; Dean almost wanted to laugh, but he thought that would not be productive just now. He picked up the oil and coated his hands.
I checked my watch. Exactly five-thirty. I stepped outside into the cool air, leather jacket on my arm, and waited for Dean to show.
Dean rubbed his stubbled jaw with the palm of his hand, the tiny hairs scratching and rasping against his skin, making Cas' fingers twitch with the urge to replace that hand with his own.
Dean trembled, his cock so hard it actually ached. The look on Cas' face alone was the sexiest fucking thing he'd ever seen. But when the fingers in his mouth started to move, to slide in and out of Dean's lips, Cas fucking his mouth with just his precome-covered fingers, Dean fell apart.
Dean spotted Cas once more at the back of the room, before he finished to loud and enthusiastic applause. He set his guitar aside before jumping down onto the dance floor, finally free to search for Cas and desperate to make sure he was okay. He’d barely taken a step before he came face to face with his parents once again.
Body wash covered hands were sliding over his back, down his sides, over his ass. Cas slid one hand around him and wrapped it tightly around Dean's cock.
Laying in his bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, Dean wondered if Cas had been attracted to him in the same way when he'd had all his Grace. He wanted to call and ask, but knew he wouldn't. Was love as an angel different to love as a human being? Sure, they'd exchanged some pretty heated looks, but Dean had never been sure if Cas felt it too. But then:
"I don't write a thing anymore," Chuck agreed. "Well, apart from my Biography, which I'm working on right now, actually. It's pretty good, even if I do say so myself. Clears up some of those pesky mistakes in the Bible, explains what
His breath caught in his throat as Cas' other hand slid between his cheeks, sliding over his hole and making Dean's hips jerk. Then the feeling of Cas' fingers was gone, replaced by the slide of Cas' cock between his ass cheeks. Sliding against him, catching on his hole, making Dean wonder with every thrust and movement if this was the moment where Cas' cock would start to press into him.
“I know," he told Cas unrepentantly. "And I don’t want to make you feel awkward, Kate, but me and Cas have a shit-ton of things we need to talk out."
“If you’ve got something to say, Dean,” Cas growled, backing Dean against the counter, “then for fuck's sake, use your
That was what changed everything. Cas telling Dean he'd loved him had been incredible and moving and had brought him to fucking tears, but those other words had been undeniable. What else could he want that he didn't already have? Was he right that he couldn't have it? Because if Cas wanted an official relationship, if he wanted them to walk around Target hand in hand, if he wanted Dean to get down on one knee, that wasn't anything Dean could give him. If he wanted that, then Dean needed to tell him how off-limits it was and why. Cas deserved that much at least.
balls instead?" He laughed at his own joke, obviously thinking he was hilarious. Alcohol had a lot to answer for.
"I can imagine that it's exactly why Jack chose this spot," he agreed. Jack was that kind, that thoughtful. As horrified as Cas was by how Jack was trapped with Amara, he couldn't quite shake the glorious feeling that it meant Jack hadn't changed. He was still the same giving, kind boy his mother had always known he would be, and that fact alone gave him hope. They would save Jack, whatever else happened.
“Kate. She just vanished. She didn’t storm out of the apartment, she didn’t run off. She stumbled, righted herself and then vanished.”
Dean fought to stay awake because he'd promised Cas that he'd watch over him, but at some point the steady brush of Cas' breath against his throat, the feel of him warm, real, and safe in his arms—it became impossible to fight, and finally he slept.
Cas smiled, truly moved by what she'd done. "You weren't actually going to tell anyone tonight, were you?"
" Dean admitted in a low tone. "I feel like I need to be touching you all the time. I don't know what's got into me today."
“Every inch of my skin is freakin' singing, Cas,” Dean said, surreptitiously adjusting his jeans to try to untrap his throbbing cock.
“It turned him into a fucking toddler,” Dean hissed, hoping that Cas was too engrossed in his food to be listening. He watched Cas trying to get all the noodles from his soup onto his spoon in one go. “Trusting, naive, unsafe! Anything could have happened to him!”
you - he belonged to Michael. Every other Castiel fetched him from Hell, pieced him back together and handed him over. You just
Well, he didn't need asking twice. Or maybe he did, but definitely not a third time. He lifted his hips, pushing at the rather tight waistband of his pants—he'd been comfort-eating a lot lately, and junkfood was so tempting when the alternative was cooking for just yourself. There was no one there to moan in pleasure with each forkful of food that he'd lovingly crafted now.
"And while I might not be writing your pathetic little lives anymore," Chuck said, "what I've already written can't be changed. You, Dean? You're no different from any other Dean that I created, and I don't just mean physically. I mean, sure I made you good to look at - every good story needs some eye candy - again
"I'm not running." Dean's hands were on either side of Cas' face, cradling it. "I'm here, however you want me. I was stupid for five minutes and I freaked out and acted before I had chance to think, and I will regret that for the rest of my life. I don't want to hurt you anymore…
Dean leaned on the solid wooden railings of the porch, gazing out onto the water. Soon it would ice over, too cold for anyone to imagine dipping a toe in. But in the summer this would be the perfect place for swimming and cooling off, just like in the dream home Dean had talked to Cas about on the phone a few weeks ago.
“You’re doing good, sweetheart,” Dean praised gently, squeezing his shoulder and then going to top up Cas' glass of water. “You’ll feel so much better soon.”
They were comforting sounds, but he couldn't relax. He was no closer to figuring out how to best approach Dean, how best to convince him that changes needed to be made, that his life had value. He was holding out hope that Dean had calmed down overnight and would maybe seek Cas out himself. They did have a lot to catch up on, and if they could put Cas' confession of love behind them, they could get back to being friends again.
"Cas," Dean murmured, reaching out for him as if to pull him close. Cas flinched back so violently that his back hit the wall behind him.
"Is this what we do now? Argue, hug it out, repeat?" Dean asked. "Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining - I mean it's working for us, right?"
Just as Cas was about to take his next shot, his gaze lifted to Dean's. There was no searching the room, no looking for him—Cas knew exactly where Dean was without even needing to search. Bright blue eyes locked on his, pinning him in place. Dean wet his suddenly dry lips.
Dean turned away to give Cas some privacy to change. He could hear the rustling of clothes, the sound of jeans being fastened, belts being threaded. Dean did the same, hurriedly fastening jeans, pulling a fresh t-shirt and shirt on, unsure if Cas had turned around to give him privacy too, or was just blatantly ogling him while he changed. Not that he'd have minded. Dean wasn't shy.
Dean had leapt off the bed and moved across the room in two single strides. His hand covered Cas' mouth firmly, clamping down and smothering anything else he wanted to say.
Cas had started off trying to hold his tongue when it came to Dean's relationship with his father, but after weeks of listening to what John was putting Dean through, his tact had worn thin.
Before Dean could anticipate it, before he could read what was happening and react, Kate had hurled herself at him. Winding her arms around his neck tightly, her mouth pressed to his, hard and forceful, as if she was going to take this kiss no matter what. Her body pressed into his, breasts firm from being crammed so tightly into her dress, sliding against him like this was a makeout session instead of an impromptu, unwanted kiss.
"Guys, can you stop making out over there and put just a little bit of effort into helping us escape?"  Dean and Cas had been too wrapped up in each other to notice that Sam had crossed the room to stand in front of them."Honestly, it's like you've gone back to being teenagers."
As she held it closer Dean shook his head, recoiling from the package as if it might contain something as horrifying as Cas' remains. He scrambled backwards, away from both Amara and the cloth wrapped bundle she held.
books knew that Dean was bisexual. But it was only a few weeks ago that Dean had been in denial about that—not entirely to himself, but very much so to anyone around him who ever pressed him on it. Unlabelled was fine, but Dean deciding to embrace a label enough to claim it, that was a huge deal for him.
Cas pulled Dean's face closer to him by the lapels of his shirt. "You are the most infuriating, impossible, needy-" he turned them so Dean was the one with his back against the wall. "-and your mouth - fucking hell, Dean. It should be illegal for you to look the way you do,
" Cas interrupted, lifting his hand to Dean's face. "I don’t want a wife. The only person I've ever thought about having a family with is
A freaking chastity belt wouldn't stop him wanting to touch Cas. He'd willingly gnaw the fucking thing off to get to him. But underwear did provide a layer, and it would make cuddling slightly less dangerous. Slightly.
"I see." Cas got up onto his knees on the bed and, using Dean's shoulders for support, he straddled Dean. "Fine."
"You're no fool—you know how places like our new refuge work. His soul is bound to the earth where he died. It's absorbed—gone." She sighed impatiently and images of her being torn limb from limb flashed vividly in Dean's mind, tempting him, beckoning to him.
to be touching Cas right now, so much that it physically hurt not to. He couldn't do any of that right now.
"Not counting Cas, the last time was three or four years ago," Dean answered, like Cas hadn't just almost died on his own apartment floor. Okay he was being dramatic, sue him. But what the hell?!
was attached to Cas. Who knew how Cas really felt these days? All he knew was that he craved him like someone had coated the Angel in cocaine. He'd tried to stop it and couldn't - It was fucking terrifying, like driving a car with no brakes. He wasn't sure he would survive if he were to throw himself free of the vehicle. Better to stay in the car and keep on driving until its inevitable fatal collision.
“Yes, I know he was taken, Dean,” Sam says, “you called me at least ten times while I was in the car.” He pushes a hand through his hair and huffs out a sigh. “Tell me
"Aw, gee, thanks." Winding an arm around Cas’ shoulders, Dean pulls him close and gives Faith the biggest shit-eating-grin that he can muster. “So, Faith, you spotted May yet?”
“Right,” Dean mouths to Cas before they both get to the last stair. Like loaded springs, they whip around to face the rest of the open-planned house: Cas facing the living room, Dean the kitchen. Nothing.
Castiel nods mutely, staring at a spot in the wall beyond Dean's shoulder. He feels the outline of his cell phone in the pocket of his jeans, pressing insistently against his hip. "That would be lovely," he says, voice tight.
His left knee cracked as Dean stood. Feet unsteady, he looked at his brother, who he could tell was moments away from asking him not to do this—but staying silent all the same.
The warning washed over him like freezing cold water. Cas’s eyes, normally warm and loving, were cold and blank. Dean’s knees buckled, threatening to topple him as he stopped in his tracks.
Sam sat down at the table and pulled his own laptop out of his shoulder bag, placing it on a small pile of manilla folders. “Did you get in touch with uh, crap—” He tapped his fingers against the table, thinking. “What’s his name?”
When Castiel looks up, Dean is in front of him, cheeks flushed with joy and eyes sparkling. “No, but Lisa does.” He takes the bags from Cas, their hands brushing, and disappears into the kitchen.
May holds up a hand. “Wait, wait. That’s why you both left so early? How do you know it was a psychic attack?”
“Your guardian angel?” Dean stands, putting his coffee mug in the sink. He hates it when people leave dishes lying around in the teacher’s lounge, and he’s not about to do the same. “Do you even need guarding anymore?”
Cas nods. He stands in tandem with Dean, withdrawing his knife. Dean shoves his gun into Cas’ hand—just in case a knife doesn’t cut it—and grabs a pistol from under the pillow.
Hollow, bloodshot eyes stared at him from the mirror. It took a jarring moment to realize they were his. It’d been weeks since he’d properly looked at himself: his cheekbones jutted more sharply under the dark circles of his eyes, his mouth downturned in a permanent frown. Patchy stubble was sketched into his pale skin; a result of not shaving in days. There were lines on his forehead he didn’t remember there being before.
“I…” Cas licks his lips. His lips look painfully dry. Dean mentally adds chapstick on his list of things to buy for Cas. “I had to think about things.”
It only took one terrible moment for Cas to make his decision, and change his and Dean’s future forever, with Sam having to pick up the broken pieces left behind. Without any thought, without any hesitation.
.” Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. “Fine. My dad is a dumb old drunk who sits in his house all day and occasionally emerges to gamble the money he doesn’t have away. Happy?”
Dean shakes his head with an angry huff, carefully applying the bandage to Castiel’s forehead. Castiel represses a shiver when Dean’s fingertips flutter over his skin. “No, Cas. Don’t make excuses for him.”
Dean remembers the number as soon as he reads it: 555-9875. Cas had told Dean that if they ever get in trouble, or move away, they have to remember each other’s phone numbers so the other person can help. “Even when we’re adults!” Cas proclaimed from atop the slide, arms outstretched before he tumbled off the side (he did that a lot, climbing to high places, and making Dean’s too small heart already having premature attacks from fear).
Castiel is struggling to pull a sweater over his head when he hears a voice from the doorway: “Hey. You’re out of bed.”
Almost as if Dean would be an idiot to pass up the opportunity to tell Cas the thoughts that are in the dark corners of his heart.
Cas stares at Dean. Opens his mouth, then shuts it. Finally: “I do not know who Ricky and Lucy are.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean shrugged again. “Not much else to do except go on hunts looking for leads on how to find you.”
“It was me, Cas.  It was me trying to find you, trying to get you out.” Dean bit at the inside of his cheek, tampering down the burning in his chest. “We can get you out of here, but you have to fight for it. Okay?”
Nodding, apparently satisfied, Castiel sits back on his heels. He says informatively, “I believe I’m drunk.”
There was a pressure behind Dean’s eyes where moisture gathered at the corners. Leaning forward, he grabbed Sam into a tight hug. “Thanks,” he choked out.
Castiel blinks at him. Dean stares back, speechless in the wake of his accidental confession. He steps away from Castiel, the fight draining from his shoulders, his body slumping into a kitchen chair. He holds his head in his hands.
Dean lay back on the bed, shifting up until his head found the pillows. He slid his hands under them and watched Cas expectedly, laughing when Cas practically tumbled onto the bed to straddle him.
During his darkest moments, alone at night in his room, Dean would wonder if him dying on a hunt might be what they needed to set them all free. For Cas to find that family he yearned for—for Sam to finally be allowed to concentrate on his family instead of worrying about his screw-up of a brother. Those were the nights where he wouldn't let himself hunt at all, just in case he became reckless—just in case he gave up.
Cas watched as Dean dressed his wound, gently and efficiently. “Having such sensitive nerve endings takes some getting used to," Cas admitted, pulling a face at his stinging finger.
He picked up the little silver dog piece and moved it to Boardwalk with a triumphant bow as he counted his paper money out loud, slowly and smugly.
"You know I'm banned from the strip club," Cas reminded him. Dean had been making this same complaint repeatedly all week. "They've even got my photo stuck to the door."
Cas didn't answer. He'd made the mistake of turning and looking at Dean as he talked about Jack, and saw the love in his eyes, in that little half smile. Cas heart clenched at it.
he loved, earning himself good natured, uncannily coordinated eye rolls from Sam and Eileen as he completely missed the prompt to produce the rings. His eyes locked with Cas', the sound of Rowena's Scottish brogue repeating the question for the second—third?—time still not breaking through the haze as the heat rose inside him, feelings bubbling to the surface.
"That's awful, Cas." Kate reached out and covered Cas' hand with hers. Cas felt Dean's thigh twitch under his other hand.
Eileen wanted to try out the Safe Harbor, and no amount of petty jealousy was enough to make Dean admit that he didn’t want to see Kate and Cas interacting with each other when his and Cas' friendship was on such rocky ground. He kept quiet and hoped that it just wouldn’t be a night that she was working there, a hope that was shattered when she met them cheerily at the door to the restaurant.
The loud ringing that came from his pocket made him wince. It wasn’t as if being directly outside Dean’s door was a particularly clever hiding place, but there had been a tiny, minuscule chance that Dean hadn’t been aware that he was out there until his ringtone had given him away.
Silently, Amara looked down at the package sitting forgotten on the ground next to them where Naomi had left it. She stretched over and picked it up, holding it out to Dean, who stared at it with horror in his eyes.
Amara looked at him in consternation, and Dean knew what her answer was before she opened her mouth.
"Do you know what happened to me the first time my dad caught me with a guy?" Dean asked. His voice sounded strange, like it wasn't his. Maybe that was a good thing? Maybe he could pretend none of this was him.
A surge of protectiveness filled Dean suddenly and unexpectedly. He reached for his discarded t-shirt and, letting himself enjoy the view of them wet with each other's cum one last time, he gently cleaned them both up with it, before throwing it neatly into his laundry basket.
The last straw for him had been coming home in the early hours of the morning to find that Dean had pulled a chair up to Cas' bedroom door and was fast asleep in it. He'd obviously not meant to fall asleep - his head had fallen back against the wall, his jaw slack, his hand still clutching a half finished cup of coffee in an impressive death grip. If the plan had been for the coffee to keep him awake, it had failed spectacularly.
Not right now, but later, when he was all alone in his bed, Cas would tear into himself over this; over how he'd not known that his Jack wasn't Jack at all; over how badly he'd let Jack down. He'd had moments when he'd feared that the boy he loved so much was disappearing, that the power he now had as God had changed him so much that occasionally he was unrecognisable. But not once had it occurred to him that Jack had been possessed. And every time 'Jack' had made something better, made things a little less cruel, he'd wanted to believe it was Jack's goodness so badly that he didn't look past it at all.
"Would you drop me off at the apartment, please? I've left a few bits at the Bunker, but I don't really need them. I'll get them another time."
"What did you expect would happen when Castiel came here? Did you think we'd greet him with open arms? The former angel who betrayed us all, then walked out on us to be with his little human—again?" She looked at him pityingly and Dean gripped his blade more tightly. "He was nothing more than a lapdog, and there was nothing I could do to save him."
"Never came up," Dean shrugged casually. He hugged everyone in turn as the three women filed down the stairs and into the main room. Kaia stayed close to Claire until she spotted Miracle and then made a beeline towards him. He was definitely the most popular of the Winchesters.
Dropping his voice low, so that the other two would hopefully stop listening in, he growled, "My clothes look almost as good on you as they do me."
"Then what is it about?" Cas challenged. What did he have to lose at this point, really? Their friendship wasn't going to survive this, and whatever else they'd had before was lost now. Why not just set fire to it all? "One minute we were making promises to each other and planning amazing sex, and the next you're shuddering in disgust when you accidentally touch me."
"We tried out a few classes while you and I weren't spending time together," he told Dean, trying to hide his embarrassment, but making it come out as defiance instead. "Something to fill the time. Cooking, still life, self-defense— I was so bored of job searching…"
"I've had my submissive moments. I mean, years ago if there was someone who would hold me down and do whatever they wanted with me - I was all for that. Bondage, toys, dressing up, anything really - but I've got more trust issues now than I had back then. I don't like being vulnerable and I don't have a whole lot of good memories of being tied up."
we're doing this again!" Dean looked up at Cas, feeling guilt stabbing at his chest. He'd made Cas feel like this and he needed to fix it. He wriggled.
. I painstakingly reconstructed every part of him - every freckle, every eyelash, and you claim I staked my claim, but I didn't. I was prepared for that man to be sacrificed for the greater good. I was a different person then."
After hours of searching, they'd dragged their equipment back down the mountain and Dean had taken cold comfort in the fact that they'd not found a body. That night he'd cracked open his last cans of beer and toasted the sky before finally giving in to the weeks of pent up emotion, screaming in despair into the cold night air and sobbing into his hands until the effects of the alcohol and the silence of the night drew him into a fitful sleep, where once again he'd dreamt that he was in Cas' arms again, being soothed and held until morning.
wanted you to leave?" He wished he was brave enough to just crawl into Dean's lap. But he wasn't, and besides, he was still very much trying not to fall back into what they were before, last night's slip excluded. He’d given himself a stern (and silent) talking to in the shower and was steeled to resist Dean, however difficult it would be.
"I should really thank her," Cas murmured, dropping a kiss on Dean's jaw and then pulling reluctantly out of his arms.
Dean slid the very tip of Cas' middle finger into his mouth and slowly, deliberately, agonisingly, lathed it with his tongue. Cas tried to suppress a groan, but it escaped his lips anyway, low and needy in his throat.
"You want me to be happy, how about you come play pool and drink beer with me one night? Or come on a road-trip. We can hunt some monsters, maybe explore some new towns."
Cas spun around from where he was rifling through a drawer full of old newspapers, and stared at Dean in disbelief.
One light touch and Dean’s nerve endings were on fire. It was such an intense pleasure that Dean didn’t know if he loved it or hated it. He remembered Lisa buying a load of toys on Valentines day, and that night she’d pressed the vibrator against the tip of his cock and he’d nearly shot off the bed. It was that sort of intense - incredible but borderline too much.
need to talk," Cas agreed, his voice floating clearly through the door to Dean. "But you've got people due to arrive any time now, and you know Dean - in the sober light of day, he's going to want to talk about this as much as he'd want to give up pie for Lent. You're not going to get anywhere today."
Kate had become a little withdrawn and sad after lunch. It was obvious that it stung a little watching other children play when her own were hours away, playing the same sort of games with her ex husband and his new wife. It was at that moment that Dean had dropped the edge of hostility he had reserved for Kate, and he'd tried to distract her from her unhappiness.
"It's okay. It's not like I haven't been pitching a tent on and off since you held my hand earlier. It's just that now it's gonna be all I can think about."
"Then find me," Cas whispered back urgently, his breath seeming to scald Dean's skin with its heat. Dean pulled back to look at him, taking in his eyes, big and round like saucers, shadowed and haunted. Dean's stomach twisted and clenched at the look in Cas’ eyes. Anxiety rose in his chest unbidden, thick and choking, clawing at the inside of his throat.
Holding Cas tightly, Dean fell backwards onto the bed, taking Cas with him. Half on top of Dean, Cas wiggled himself into a comfortable position and Dean pulled the covers over them both.
Cas watched him for a moment from his position still straddling Dean's hips. Dean watched him back, trying to hold his gaze, forcing himself not to let his eyes drag down over his bare chest.
Castiel opens his mouth in surprise, about to ask where Anna is, when Dean claps him hard on the shoulder and says, “No use, Charlie, guy doesn’t speak a shred of English.”
“Cooking books,” Castiel replies, holding up a red checkered one that he is currently reading, “and many books on the American presidents.”
Anna squints at the lettering. “’Lisa Braeden,’” she reads, “’failed soulmate connection with Dean Winchester.’” She stares at Castiel incredulously. “You have to be a
“Sorry, you got yourself into this, Dean,” Sam replies. The door opens. “My best advice? Do what the angel says. He’s here on direct orders from Heaven after all, and that tells me that they mean business. If it doesn’t work out with Lisa, well, at least you tried. And he’ll go away.”
“No, no way. He moved after we broke up.” Dean tilts his head to frown at Castiel. “Why all the questions about Benny all of a sudden?”
“Cas!” Dean grabs his hand, kisses his forehead, lets out a strangled laugh. “Cas, your eyes are open!”
“Because we’re not looking to form teams here,” Bob says with a rap of his fist against the tabletop. “We don’t even know who you are.”
Cas runs his hands up and down Dean’s back, presses adoration into his skin. Waits for him to continue.
Finding the flashlight, he shined it onto his arm. The black liquid dripped lazily onto the ground before slithering back to the puddle.
Sam smiled gently. “They can handle it, Dean. They’re more than capable. Not like Rick Johnson and those vampires.”
“I would choose the word ‘annoying’, personally,” Dean grumbles, fingers gingerly exploring the back of his head.
Castiel is about to fit his key into his apartment door when he hears the voices: Dean’s gruff baritone mixed with a lilting melodic voice.
It’s ten at night when he gets home from his date with Lisa; the earliest that a date has ever ended for Dean. The house is dark but for one lone light in the living room, indicating that Cas hadn’t disappeared and repeated last weekend’s post-date fiasco.
,” Chuck said, wagging a finger in Dean’s face. He winced as Dean pushed the gun’s barrel harder into his skin. “However, my ending for you—seems to be working out just fine.”
Dean scoffed into his beer as he took another sip. “Gee, Sammy, thought you were pre-law, not a pre-poet.” When Sam leveled him with a look, Dean waved his hand. “Yeah, yeah. I hear you. I do.”
Castiel tries to explain to her that as an angel—and a cupid trying to pair Dean with his soulmate no less—it’s one of the worst things.
updating a day early! feeling chaotic good this weekend. (although the piles of grad school work i have to do would beg to differ)
Dean nods into his hands. “He just… left.” He drops his arms to rest on the table; shakes his head to clear it. “Sorry. I’m being a dumbass.”
more detailed trigger warning: Cas is severely depressed, gets up on a ledge, talks about jumping (not in the suicidal sense, just that he could do it as an angel and now can't do it as a human). overall, just a bad mental state from Cas.
Something flashes in Cas’ eyes that Dean could almost label as hurt; he looks away. “If that’s what you want.”
Castiel can see Dean’s anger fade into something much more terrifying—John’s words are cutting into him deeply.
One of Dean’s vibrant green eyes looks at him from between his fingertips. He grins. “You’re something else, you know that?”
Dean crouches before him, arm propped on one knee. “Cas, what the hell? You were out there all night?”
. Where the hell were you bastards when my marriage was falling apart, huh? Why are you here for Dean just because he’s a pansy about
Cas extends his arms arms toward the ceiling in a languid stretch. A strip of skin peeks out from under Cas’ shirt as it rides upward. Dean quickly averts his gaze when Cas catches him staring.
Letting out a sigh, Dean unwound his arm from around Cas’s shoulders. Cas always looked past the veil of his jokes. It was unsettling.He studied his hands. “I’m not kidding myself or anything, Cas. I know you’re getting restless, that this isn’t enough. And you’re acclimating to being human and all, and—yeah. I know the next step here. I’m just… wonderin’ when I have to start preparing myself, I guess.”
When Castiel observes a coffee date between Dean and Lisa on Wednesday afternoon, Castiel’s heart clenches painfully as he records observations of their relationship in his notebook.
Trailing his hand across Cas’s chest, Dean said, “I know your grace was in me the whole time you were gone. That’s why I heard your voice, why you could hear me. But now that it’s gone… it doesn’t feel like anything’s missing.”
“Cas, fuck! Oh God, yes!” Dean sang a litany of praises, not believing how hard he was without having any direct stimulation to his dick. “God, you’re perfect Cas.”
And with that, Dean was left with one very pleasing, yet apparently uncomfortable client. It was all over his face.
The Friday before finally arrived, and Dean couldn’t be bothered by a thing in the world. Dean loved his job, but he’d never looked forward to a client like this. He made sure to give his full attention to each of his customers that day, though. He didn’t want them to think he was not focused on them. Meg was the last customer before Castiel; she was always a fun client. Her appointments were relatively frequent, but erratic. She just worked it in whenever she felt like it.
It was a fairly busy day at the butterfly garden. Friday’s were always busy because that’s when schools would take the kids out for field trips. The garden had a small apiary which produced just enough honey to sell at the gift shop. The bees were my specialty. It was a perfect, low-stress job for a student. When I wasn’t tending them or helping elsewhere in the garden, I gave talks about honey bees and honey production. I was giving one such presentation when I first saw him.
The day starts out manageable enough. Dean forgets his lunch (as he usually does), and Castiel decides to bring it by Dean’s classroom (as he usually does).
“Lucky for me,” Cas agreed, his voice low and rumbling. He pulled Dean down toward him, his hands guiding Dean’s hips to slot against his. Dean shivered at the contact.
Suddenly, the ground began to rumble and quake. Gabriel withdrew his own angel blade from his sleeve, holding it high. “Shit,” he muttered. “No, not yet—
He cuts off when Dean promptly rips the note in half. Cas watches, mouth agape, as Dean tears it into smaller and smaller pieces until it’s just shredded paper. Scattering it on the ground, Dean dramatically brushes his hands against each other and walks back to the bed.
His sneakers squeak as he stumbles onto the bus, feeding the quarters into the coin tray. He sits in the very back of the empty bus, settling against the window. Content to sit there forever, and forget the events of the day, he looks at the city lights and people whooshing by on the sidewalk, mind blissfully blank and numb from the cold.
The entryway was empty, save for Eileen’s duffel bag deposited on the shoe bench. Voices, raised and talking over each other, floated from the living room. Dean and Sam exchanged looks as they pulled off their shoes.
There was a long stretch of silence; it sounded like Dean was barely breathing. Finally, he said into the quiet, “Danny locked me in there. The monster was too strong, and—we were both going to die, we knew it. But he.” Dean made a broken sound. “He locked me in there and saved me.”
“It makes sense, with what you told me; with your father and you and Sam constantly being on the road.”
“It’s okay, man, I’m just giving you grief. Sammy has too many books anyway. What’s it called again?”
you that. I never made it obvious or clear.” He squeezed his eyes shut, shaking. Cas, his concern obviously overriding his confusion, placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I should have gotten over my goddamn intimacy issues and just—just
“He left and I don’t even know where he is. All I have is this goddamn note.” Dean’s hand goes to his left jeans pocket, patting it. Cas can hear the paper crackle. “It’s proof that I fucked up, Sam. So stop telling me it ain’t my fault.”
“It’s not even my house,” Dean says, still not quite sure where he’s going with this, “it’s Benny’s. I co-signed onto it so I can still pay the mortgage, but… it’s mainly his. He’s the one that put work into it when it was still a shithole, he was the one that used the kitchen mostly to make dinner…. He liked this house way more than I ever did. That garden in the back? It’s the only thing I like. It’s really pretty in the summer. But, really, it’s fucking depressing to come home to this place.”
“It’s just so lovely that you’ve gotten yourself married,” Kate—or was it Nancy?—gushed, gesticulating a wrinkled hand toward Cas across the room. “And he’s such a nice man. Richard and I just met him.”
“It’s awesome. I’m a classic rock fan myself, but most people don’t find that music relaxing enough. This way, you get your nice chill music, and I get my jams and no one is the wiser.”
As Dean moved up Castiel’s arm, he watched as his eyelids slowly drooped and his face gradually loosened. By the time he reached the second arm, Castiel’s eyes were closed and a smile played on his lips.
Saturday night was weekly “bro-time,” so Dean had Sam over for dinner and video games. It had been fun, but a little embarrassing. When Sam had asked him about his week, Dean had accidentally spewed his enthusiasm about his newest customer. Try as he might not to be weird about it, the words just kept spilling out before he even noticed.
“Dean, let’s go!” The other chaperone, a middle-aged woman with spiky hair, called from the hallway that led to the beetles.
A voice nearby shouted. My eyes opened blearily when the light was blocked by a dark figure. The voice shouted some more, but I wasn’t paying attention. There was too much noise, too much pain. My heart beat so fast even that hurt. I couldn’t get enough air in my lungs and I could feel my mind giving up trying to organize the chaos. The world got one shade lighter as my visor was lifted away and faintly the voice said something I did comprehend. “Oh my god… Castiel?”
“Yes.” Cas gazed with regal approval at his bound and totally naked handiwork, then deflated a bit with trepidation. “I have one more request.” He said tentatively. “I do not wish to gag you, because that seems… I don't know. I do not like that. And I want to hear your sounds fully, and naturally. But I don’t want you to say anything. Can you do that? I just want to observe without being made fun of.”
“Alright, that sounds good. Thank you, Dean.” The smile Castiel wore was so bright, he didn’t even look like the same person he’d met ninety minutes ago. Dean had done that. He wanted to do it again, and soon.
“Okay Cas, I know you’re a little nervous about this, but you’re on a roll here. I think you need to give my foot massage a try.”
Dean gave it everything he got, attacking his worst spots and everywhere in between. He smooshed his face against Castiel's neck, his hands worming their way under Cas’ shirt. Dean hummed and nuzzled there, adding even more vibration to the assault on his senses. While Cas was overwhelmed, Dean continued his commentary.
got it? Nothing about this cupid or soulmate bullshit. This is my work. I don’t want to get fired because of you, or Heaven, or whoever the hell insists on poking their noses into my personal life.”
He had slid into the barstool just four hours ago, rapping on the counter for a beer. The bartender, recognizing him, at first refused to give him anything. Dean waving the usual wad of cash in his face changed his mind.
“Sam.” Dean’s voice was hard as flint as he stopped at the foot of the stairs. He gripped the banister hard, shoulders hunched in as he tried, valiantly, not to lose his cool again. “I’m gonna take Miracle for a walk. By the time I get back, decide if you’re on board or if I’m leaving you behind.” His feet were heavy as he continued to walk up the stairs.
“Ideally,” Castiel sighs, “but occasionally punishment is dealt out.” He briefly wonders how Mary knows that, since the politics of angels are normally lost on humans, but he leaves his questioning for another time.
“Oh, no, he’s at work,” Dean says with a broad smile, the one that has, historically, charmed women into bed. “But I’ll give it to him when he gets back, okay?”
“Because I’m stuck,” Dean says before he can stop the words. He blinks at Cas, who doesn’t seem to have any reaction to that. “Yeah. I guess… I’m stuck.”
Jody was already at the front door when Gabriel deposited them onto the winding driveway. Dean looked at her, held up his hand in a wave, and then promptly threw up all over the lawn.
“Don’t you dare apologize,” Dean warns. “Don’t you apologize for—something that’s so—“ Dean growls in frustration when words fail him, and instead depends on action: he cups Castiel’s cheek with one hand, pulling Castiel forward by the shirt with the other. Dean’s lips impatiently seek his, and Castiel shivers when he feels Dean deepen the kiss, pressing their chests warmly together.
Cas traces his fingers against the corner of the paperback spine, shoulders hunched like they normally get when he’s uncomfortable. “I didn’t mean to steal it. It’s just… a very significant book to me.”
“Okay.” Sam leans over a kitchen chair, props his elbows onto the back of it. “I think we should canvas the neighborhood together. Two pairs of eyes is better than one, right? And she can’t have taken him far, since all the victims were found in this area.”
Jack took a step back from Dean, sloppily attempting a pair of finger guns. “And I’m still a Winchester, right?”
Castiel continues to walk down the sidewalk to avoid Dean’s observant eyes. “There’s many reasons. It would take too long to explain.”
“Dean, really?” Cas asks, his tone a mixture of disappointment and fondness. “She’ll never go down for her afternoon nap.”
“I know that lead didn’t pan out in Washington—but you can’t keep doing this. Getting your hopes up about something that could be related to the Empty, only to have it come to nothing. Because you know what happens when it’s nothing, Dean? This. Me picking you up in a dive bar with half your face bashed in.”
He remembered where Jody’s bathroom was from when they had dinner there last—his feet carried him down the hallway, his hands pushed open a door. When he heard footsteps following—probably Sam—he shut the door, leaning against it.
Sam’s smile grew wider. Dean returned it. He watched Sam’s back as he walked down the hill. As soon as he was out of sight, Dean’s face fell, and he looked back out into the distance.
Dean sees Sam’s Volvo as his headlights flash across the driveway. After he shifts his car’s gears into park, he rests his forehead against the leather steering wheel for a moment to steady his rapid heart-rate. When the interior of the car starts to get cold without the engine on, he goes inside.
His memories shatter and morph to a glaring Dean standing in front of him. Castiel takes a steadying breath and takes a step toward the fence separating them.
“Novak,” Dean groans into the fabric. “I’m gonna text him, but he won’t text me back, because who would text back a psychopath that just randomly calls your childhood best friend’s phone number—”
Dean pulled Chuck away from the wall just to slam him into it again. “You wanna try again?” he growled as Chuck wheezed for breath.
“Any pets,” the man says impatiently behind a shelf, “any pets that would get into your garden and eat stuff when you’re not looking.”
to be there. He’s not on Earth, you didn’t sense him on any other planes of existence—there’s literally nowhere else he could be. The Empty’s probably just hiding him. Right?”
The fear immobilizes him for only a moment; the quick shuffling of thoughts only distract him for a second (
The door is locked when they get to it. Both brothers flatten against the wall on either side of it. At Dean’s nod, Sam bangs the padlock a few times with the butt of his gun before the wood splinters, a chunk of the handle clanging to the floor.
He’s cleaning the tables (not his job, technically, but he insisted on doing it after a week and a half of no love letters) when a woman comes through the door. She stands in the wake of the bell, eyes scanning the cafe hesitantly. When her eyes lock on Dean, she hones in on him like a homing beacon, walking toward him with new purpose.
Dean turns toward the voice; nearly sprains something as he doubles over, laughing. “Dude, what in the hell are you wearing?”
Across the house, a door slammed shut; the voices in the living room, once leveled, pitched to a higher volume. Dean and Claire shot each other a frown before Dean moved toward the doorway; it Jody nearly collided with him as she came around the corner.
“Fail to see—are you—“ Dean sputters. He pinches the bridge of his nose and squeezes his eyes shut to the headache coming on from Cas’ stubbornness. He grits out, “Fine. Here.” Shrugging out of his leather jacket, he takes Cas’ arms and forces them into the sleeves. “At least wear this so you don’t die of cold.”
“You know I was sorry to hear about your friend too.” Jody chewed at her bottom lip, frowning. “Castiel.”
He loves the isolation more than he should. He calls in sick to work the first week. Then the next. It morphs into him writing a truncated email to his boss announcing his resignation. He deactivates his email after that.
As Dean shrugs at the floor, Mary says slyly, “People have seen you around town with Lisa, Dean. Don’t hide that you like her from us.”
He flops onto his bed, determined to get at least a few hours of sleep before his internal clock inevitably wakes him at dawn. He listens to the familiar noises of the house; of Cas running the shower.
