John looked to Sherlock, who answered him with a nod. “Of course we won't. Now tell us, what happened?”
“Yeah, I know, I just-..” John sighed, eating a forkful before a thought struck him. “Are you-? I mean, are you into Alphas then? Which is fine, by the way.”
Okay, so. The response to the first chapter was so massive (for my standards), that it kind of frightened me and I instantly started on the second one.
! I'd never have taken you for the kind to stay at home, baking the bread.” Lestrade murmured, starting to pace around a bit.
“Alright, I will ask you to try to move it up to this week, if possible tomorrow. Now, the bleeding should stop sometime within the next 5 minutes, if it doesn't, call again and we will directly transport you into a hospital. As I said, there seems to be no direct harm on your pup, but your doctor will have to make for a clear vision on that.” the mid-aged man informed in a kind but clinical tone.
“Sherlock, how about no one?” the look Sherlock threw him at that said all there was to be said. “It'll be fine, really, I'm very capable in that field.”
Somehow, that was exactly what John had wanted to hear. Sherlock lifted himself off the ground and climbed, or rather squeezed, into Jon's chair, his legs pressing between the Alpha's thighs and the armrests and they shared a kiss. The first proper, whole-hearted, sorted-out kiss since Sherlock had gone missing. It was going to be good
Neither of them lost memory of this time, both staying in tune for the wonderful feeling of John's member in Sherlock's wet, tight hole, maddening kisses to whatever part of Sherlock John could reach and that final, blissful moment when orgasm hit them both simultaneously, Sherlock's body milking John for all he could give and John's teeth breaching the skin on Sherlock's neck, closing the circle their bodies and hearts formed sending both of them far, far away into the absolute of human pleasure – the bond of Alpha and Omega.
He looked around the room. The floor boards and wallpaper looked as if they might still be originals. Most of the furniture was also rather vintage. He couldn't say he didn't like that touch. He certainly preferred it to the clinical boldness of the more modern furniture in his family home.
John hadn't noticed yet, though. He'd been stressed and distracted most of the time and it was a very minor change after all. However, Sherlock Holmes wouldn't be who he was, if he couldn't make use of it. He lay down with his back to the door and started to prepare himself until John walked in moments later.
True to his word, John applied to various surgeries and hospitals all over London, sending them his letters via email just as he started consulting a doctor himself to start his journey for suppressants. Getting on the list when he was a young boy had been much easier; an OP in his mid-thirties put on suppressants after a two-year break in which he'd had multiple pregnancies and only five still with him – it wasn't really a safe case for prescriptions. He was, no doubt, expected to relapse at any moment, like the slut he was. Back with his old doctor, he'd had to agree to undergo examinations every week for the next month to keep track of his development. He just hoped they'd get there before his heat returned, which could be anywhere between one month to two months after his last pregnancy.
. A mere year ago, he had never anticipated experiencing the punishing throb love left in his heart. He wouldn't believe himself an Omega had it not been proofed first hand.
As if on cue, the droning sound of an ambulance approaching echoed through the settlement. The car had barely stopped, the men hardly gotten out when John was already on them, ordering them to get Sherlock on a stretcher immediately. Naturally, the Omega picked up a fight again as John tried to get him off his arms, but he silenced his pleas by giving him the most longing kisses of his life. He was quiet only temporarily, but distracted enough for John to make him let go.
“This is none of your business, Mycroft, go and help yourself to a cake in some ridiculous café!” Sherlock snapped, waving his hand in gesture to dismiss his brother.
They went on as usual after that, the only difference being sex. A considerably high amount of sex. Really. A lot.
Mycroft leaned forward against his black umbrella, his expression patronizing. “I think you will find your mate will agree that being an Alpha is not quite as.. 'relaxing' as you seem to think.”
Yvonne approached him, hands settling on his hips. “That's right, I tried to paint you innocent there. You wanted 'a night full of hot, passionate, wild shagging!'”
“Well, how could I not with you constantly begging for either sex or food? It's good for my stamina, though.”
Sherlock immediately flung himself over John again as soon as he was within reach and held him even closer, tighter. If he were strong enough right now, he might as well have hurt John. It limited his mobility and taking off the cuffs took longer this way, but that didn't matter now.
The closeness to and intimate attention by John sent out waves of endorphins and pheromones, ejected by John's contented alpha nature, through Sherlock's body and it was with great pleasure that he felt John's attention shifting further down to his hardening member. Just the tip of John's tongue brushing all the way down the shaft, followed by the entire width of it pushing all the way up again, his lips enveloping the tips sucking lightly at it.
sane. There were times you were struggling with raising your share of the rent and working cases with me. That's when you worked nine hours at maximum a day. How can you begin to think to feed six, work more than half of the day and work with me to keep me in my right mind? It's humanly impossible, John!” Sherlock almost pleaded for John to understand, to shed free from his pride and accept some help for the sanity of both of them. It was odd, Sherlock being the reasonable one out of the two of them. It needed to change soon.
There was a small pause in which Sherlock looked as if he was close to crying about being betrayed. “Because he keeps picking on me!” He barked defensively
That particular boy had experienced John's anger in the second week of endless terror as he tried to insist on him going home and John towered his 5'6'' and barked at him until he stood down.
While the Alpha was biting at his neck, Sherlock's head bobbed to the side, finding John holding himself up merely by his arms' strength. It made sense – the sofa wasn't very spacious and their positions didn't allow for John to balance himself any differently. It did give Sherlock a nice look at the Alpha's physique, though, and, as much as Sherlock loathed to admit it, it was the typical Omega's wet dream. He was just unnaturally strong; each muscle an exaggeration, ridiculously big and defined. He followed his arm's curvy line back to his torso and down his back. There, rhythmically moving with his rutting, were his buttocks, round and breathtakingly firm underneath his trousers.
John re-entered the flat after work to find Sherlock in front of his laptop in his chair. “Hey. What are you doing?” he asked, moving up behind him, leaning over the back of it.
“Where is Sherlock, dear? Is he not home?” the woman asked in honest confusion, as if she'd been informed Sherlock would be here.
John grinned. “Not a bit.” he answered, leaning down and kissing Sherlock softly at first, then cruelly. He bit the Omega's lip until he could taste his blood.
“Hm, sounds like somebody missed their chance..” She was flirting. She was flirting and John didn't know what to do. It had been a good while for him and he wasn't sure he wanted anything like this at the moment.
So, I was and still remain happy to receive both positive AND negative feedback from you guys :) It helps me get to know what you like and what not, what I can improve and what I should set as my trademark writing ;)
“Why would I be baking anything?” Sherlock questioned with a frown. He didn't understand what being with child and doing some cooking had to do with one another.
“I'm just saying that 'home' can be anywhere you call it. My home is 221B; without my brother, without a mate, without children.”
What did John expect now? Did he expect anything? This was Sherlock, after all, and John knew that. An upset Alpha against a recovering Omega, however, not so favourable. “Not, that I want to break it, although, considerably, it would be the easier problem to take care of, but there's no point in pursuing a solution just because it's easy – I might be eccentric, but I'm not entirely hopeless, so I would, at least, give a bond a try, even if more for your sake than for mine-”
He was joking, she didn't seem the kind, but her face fell. Then she leaned in closely. “I could have sworn they were green!” John chuckled and turned his face to the light for her to see better. “Damn, they
John pushed inside him quickly and used the advantage that angle was giving him to aim for his partner's prostate, trying to make this as quick as possible for the other. He was keeping his mouth by Sherlock's neck, teasing his gland over and over again to prepare it for a bite. “We don't need bloody Alphas!” he whispered poisonously, nibbling on the sensitive flesh before him.
Sherlock tried to make John see he didn't blame him, but the Alpha seemed adamant. Maybe he needed some time.
“I hate to repeat myself, John.” Sherlock said in a warning tone, but not one that showed aggressiveness. Instead, it was one John found quite endearing, like a petulant child, striving to be taking seriously by the adults.
“Why would I be sexually attracted to small, inexperienced, innocent, unknowing, un-consenting children?”
“Here it is.” Sherlock didn't ask again if John was sure he wanted to see this through with him, which the Omega was glad about. There was no doubt in Sherlock concerning John's mental strength and whether or not he could 'handle' it – likely because the Alpha was aware that John had gone through much worse than Sherlock could dream of, having gone to war and all.
“I'm just still fascinated by you.” Sherlock explained. He tilted his head, but kept the straight face nevertheless.
“Well, John, it's highly probable I already am pregnant and, if incredibly not so, will be by the end of this heat.”
Dr. Field laughed softly. “I understand this is your completing three months week?” Sherlock nodded. “Well, thanks to the number and size of your pups, according to your last ultrasound, it is logical for you to be more advanced than a usual three-month-mark looks like, but, believe me, Mr. Holmes, this is nothing compared to what awaits you in about a month.”
Sorry for the long wait. This chapter is absolute bollucks crap. It could have been something, but I feel... unattached at the moment, can't really get into any sort of emotion due to stress and so on, but I need to write to keep the stress level under control and so you get a shitty chapter. Sorry.
John swayed his head side to side. “It's not uncommon, unfortunately. Because of our accelerated development, especially as unborn pups, we need a lot of nutrition. If the carrying Omega doesn't ingest enough of something, the purist twin is always prioritised in receiving all the necessary stuff, thus essentially starving their non-purist twin. These days the only real reason this still happens is Omegas living on a diet throughout their pregnancy, which is dangerous and potentially harmful to any fetus.”
“That's exactly it. You don't try to make me see how perfect and incredible you are. You don't even try to make me love you, no, you just manipulate me, then tell me off, expecting me to wander off, leave you on your own, make a run for it.” he shrugged with an amused smile on his face. “I could go out there, find myself a nice and socially adequate female Omega, who promises to always take my wish as command, be the good houseomega and beg me to spend the rest of my life with her. When have I ever chosen the boring way?” As ridiculous as that little speech had sounded, John had a point and it made Sherlock grin a tad. “I don't make decisions easily either. Sure, I've played around in the past, but because I chose to. I was never looking for something really fixed or I'd have bonded ages ago. I'd not have bonded with you had I not been ready and I wouldn't have been ready had it not been you.”
John, again, not deeming Mycroft a party to share much with, listed the most obvious steps to his future, with no small amount of sass.“Have the lot, get a job and start living like a human being again, I thought.”
In the morning, John was gone early, had only briefly woken Sherlock to tell him he was off, there was breakfast in the fridge to re-heat in the microwave and a not-so-chaste morning and good-bye kiss.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.” John replied warmly, gentle smile on his face, his hands instinctively coming up to carress his belly subconsciously.
It happened multiple times. Sherlock kept trying to initiate, but John turned him down continuously. One time he got as far as to lay atop John, rubbing his belly against him firmly. John had pushed him away, laboured breathing, shaking hands and an impressive erection tenting his pyjama bottoms. It was a soldier's determination and willpower. It would have been arousing, had it not been used to stop the same.
“Yeah, but it's still not the same position you're in, opposed to me. I mean, an omega prick would be no big deal, but yours is about beta size, which, in comparison, is a bloody big deal!.... Christ, you're just so big!”
“Hey darling!” Yvonne greeted him in a very elegant green blouse that framed her body enticingly, but not without a whole lot of class. Her short black, curly bob hair cut accentuated her cheekbones. John thought her a stunning woman every time he saw her.
“I don't live far away. I told my parents I was going to a friend's house, since we have the day off school.”
Sherlock, a little stunned by John's words, took the Alpha's hand and let himself be pulled to his feet. However, John broke contact as soon as Sherlock was up and just started moving – this wasn't really music to partner for after all, was it? Sherlock watched John for a second, the way he used his whole body, carelessly swinging it around, a lot less stiff than Sherlock would have imagined him to dance. Then he put his own body into motion, rocking along to the music.
John's posture suddenly fell, all fight drained out of him. “You want to know my secret? I was initially planning to show you when I'm finished, but if it bothers you this much..” he said, standing, grabbing Sherlock's hand and gently pulling him along behind him.
Yes, John was smart, smarter than most people. It didn't really surprise Sherlock, that he had figured out how to block the other out only two days after he had been experiencing the same for the first time – the night they thought he had miscarried. Just thinking about it sent shivers down his spine and he felt sick to his stomach, the sheer idea of losing only one of their pups was enough to make him feel so low, he wanted to hide in some corner, get on a trip and never see the daylight again.
A smile spread across John's lips, and he whispered a heavy “thank you” before getting back up and sitting down on the floor by his pups again. Sherlock joined the group in the living room, though instead of sitting down, he reached for his violin case. He instantly had the attention of all the children, with such a new situation, they were eager to see what would happen. They looked back at John occasionally to see his reaction, but John hardly noticed and, as ever, they imitated him, looking at Sherlock and smiling. Emilia bumped her fist against Jacob to point at where her brother was already looking, sharing the amazing thing she had found, even though she didn't understand it, only that it must be captivating, if her dad was so focused on it.
“I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention...”
After a while, Sherlock straightened and fled the embrace, clearing his throat in embarrassment as much as in apology for his behaviour. John let a hand glide down his arm to tell him it was okay.
“I know you didn't. But think it through next time, yeah?” John nodded and mouthed a 'thank you' at him. “Don't worry about it. Now, you two go home, we can take it from here. He's about ready to confess, I think. Anything else I need to know?” John shook his head at the floor. Sherlock shook his head more minutely at Greg. “Good, I'll see you around then. Take care you two.”
“Secrets?” John asked with genuine confusion. “You don't expect me to tell you about my sessions with my psychologist, do you?”
Finally, through the windows of one room, he saw a room in the opposite building lit up, inside, two people. He looked more closely and recognised Sherlock's shape. Knowing that Sherlock was over there, likely with the serial killer, John tried calling out to him, but, of course, Sherlock couldn't hear him. John was about to run right back out and get over there, when he saw Sherlock holding something small. He could hardly believe it when he could make out Sherlock lowering what he could only assume to be the poison the other victims had taken, to his lips. He panicked. At a loss for better solutions, John opened the window, grabbed his gun, aimed and shot. It was only when Sherlock turned around that John fully realised what he'd done. He ducked and slowly crouched back towards the door, then ensured nobody saw him as he made an escape from the building after washing his hands inside, wiping over the sink where he'd touched it.
“Meant to have been here already.” Sherlock frowned, looking at the clock on his phone. He disliked late people. He disliked being made to wait. It made anticipation battle boredom and usually ended with him doing things that were not so good. He focused his thoughts on John, his anchor in the last 11 months. They'd known each other for almost a year. They'd lived together for almost a year. Wasn't there something about celebrating an anniversary? “Cake” he said aloud, waking himself up out of his short trance.
quick. A nurse will take another blood sample this afternoon to make sure it's not just superficial, but I'm confident that everything has healed up just fine. Now, as soon as we're sure you're safe on your legs again, you can be released. Judging by the guidance your mate has offered you so far, I'd estimate next week will be the definite timespan. You've been fighting really well, Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock grabbed his arms as John swayed and carefully leant him against a house wall. “What do you mean? How do you know?”
Sherlock got up about two hours later, enjoying the hearty breakfast John had left him. He decided to go out for shopping afterwards – John's taste in clothing was not really his own style, so why wait for him to return from work in the afternoon and then take him out to argue about choice of clothing.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you'd feel uncomfortable with, just tell me what he's up to.” And there it was. John had already decided against it. No sum of money could make him betray his own ideals like that. He'd rather be indebted to Sherlock for the rest of his life than betray Sherlock's help by selling him out to anyone.
“We don't have to worry about money, I can work at home and am generally a rather energetic person, although I realise that the last weeks might not have been the best of examples for that...” he mused, both hands unconsciously coming to lay on his middle, shielding it, protecting the hint of life inside. “I didn't want to lose one pup. This doesn't change just because there is more of them now. I want us to try, John.” he decided, looking into John's eyes demandingly.
When he came into earshot, he realised his worries had been justified, as he could hear Sherlock's deep voice rumble through the echoing, quiet streets of the night, calling for help; calling for John.
spit it out anyway, even if it's just a big load of nothing.. It'll stop eventually, though, love. Now, how about a cup of tea so you don't dry out on me?” he offered, knowing full well what would be coming right after that.
“Sorry, Sherlock.” was all the answer he got. Angry, Sherlock stormed off into their bedroom, closing the door and sulking on the bed.
It was Sherlock's turn to smile unkindly. “First of all, a choice. Secondly, a cock. I don't like women, I have told you many times.”
From the living room came the voices of children babbling to each other while, one after another, they were exchanged. Usually, John would do multiple at once, but, Sherlock had to admit, there was only so much room on the wood surface at the moment and John, as ever, didn't want to bother him too much. He wanted to snap at the silly man for thinking so little of himself. For a clever man, John could be very stupid.
Once Lestrade's team arrived, people suddenly started moving quickly. Particularly the employees of the club moved towards the back almost in panic. They tried to flee through the back door, which wouldn't open due to the tightly packed Omegas on the other side, some of whom started actively blocking it. It took about 10 minutes to have he building secured and about 30 to officially arrest every last criminal in the venue. Lestrade came back into the foyer with a flock of Omegas tailing him. Tommy went straight for John as soon as he saw him, wrinkled his nose and buried his face in the leg of his jeans.
Pain set in as his partner inserted a third finger, pushing it, not as gently inside, and realising only when John's whole body tensed in reflex. The response was Sherlock crooking one finger to brush it, expertly so, over his prostate, having him inhale sharply as his hips snapped forward instinctively.
John nodded once. “Yes, it hasn't really changed since his first appointment here. I mean, the nausea was gone very fast and is replaced by mood-swings, as you may have noticed, but I think we're handling quite well.” he smiled back.
Sherlock didn't cease his playing when he saw John, just looked him up and down, making a face resembling approval and concentrated on his bow again. So John just stood there, in borrowed clothes, feeling comfortable for the first time in two years and feeling misplaced all the same.
Sherlock failed to correct him on that statement. “No, I was just.. chatting. Meaning to ask whether you were still going for that whole
As soon as they were back in the flat, John got unusually clingy. He had Sherlock against the door, his nose in the crook of his neck. “Please, Sherlock, can I..?”
Sherlock's head fell back onto the bed as a shuddering gasp escaped him, his cock waving John 'hello'.
John was ranting on as the officers walked him to the door, not resisting in the least. “You are disgusting and a shame for all Omegas! To put an innocent
John hung his head both in shame and apology. There wasn't more he could tell Sherlock than the same old. “I know, I'm sorry.. It's just difficult to really balance all of this and still have-”
Sherlock handed it over without question, watching as John left the room with it. “The bathroom's to left down that hallway. You go take a shower and put your dirty clothes in the laundry hamper.” The order rang through the room for a couple more moments as John took another flight of stairs up, his phone call connecting.
Finally, Mycroft opened up, just a little bit, and his reply was evenly voiced and entirely serious. “Because I worry about him. Constantly.”
As John started his way into the kitchen, Sherlock suddenly shot up. “When are you going to fuck me properly? You lured me in with a promise you knew I wouldn't reject, but now all I'm good for is quickies?” he asked spitefully.
He gave her a quick scan, made mental notes of her divorce and her drinking. “That depends entirely on what you would want from him.”
“Sherlock, I am going to punch you and it is going to hurt.” John said in that calm tone that seemed so much more threatening than when he shouted, although, if he ever did, of course his shouting was still one up on his calm, since it happened so rarely and meant the final loss of control over the alpha-soldier mix that was John, while as the calm was the soldier keeping tight grip on raging alpha.
The woman's smile became less and less pleasant. But maybe that was just Sherlock's very subjective perception of her. “I thought you were supposed to be super intelligent? Let's hope your detective skills are better than your people skills.”
“Alright. Let's see.. There's been some tearing, but it seems to have healed fine. The rest also seems to be in check..” she said, prodding him with gentle but professional touches. “Anything that's been troubling you?”
“When you started telling me your plans, I thought I might as well look into it, yeah. I knew you wouldn't have much time left after your release from the hospital before you'd start having problems. You won't be able to help with these things and my time will be limited by that as well, so... I figured I'd make sure we'll be done in time. I know it isn't too much yet, but I've got almost all the stuff stored for now, just some little things missing like curtains a-”
“Deliberate murder, then, probably a ritual, likely an Alpha or someone skilled.. Still, take photos, get me a blood sample and any foreign DNA there is to find!”
“Could you not keep doing this, please?” John said in a hushed voice, but with a big grin on his lips. He hadn't felt this alive, this useful, since Afghanistan.
John, shoulders hanging, walked over to sit down in his chair, seeing no point in doing any more housework. “Neither, thanks. The caffeine?” he mentioned as a reminder.
They got chatting. The landlady especially focused on complimenting him for his pups. He had to keep reminding her that he was a Purist and that their lack of noise and activity in this stage was normal. Her comments on his own development were much the same in terms of answering: Yes, it was usual for OPs to not be flabby after 'small' litters like this, their skin was very elastic. However, she seemed to like what he was getting most self-conscious about; his weight.
“Although,” John butted in, still not looking up, ”I can't even begin to imagine what being an Omega is like. I mean being alpha isn't always easy and pleasant, but we've had about 30 years to adjust to it and, since I've gotten used to it, I don't always realise that any more. Growing up with it makes it a bit easier, I guess..”
He'd been texting with his mate all evening until he told him to go to bed at around 11pm, which was responded to by a call from Sherlock, leading to their first ever telephone sex because he was missing him and he was just 'thinking of you, John and immediately got aroused, so find a restroom to wank in', which John did. It had been magnificent. Just hearing the sounds Sherlock always made gave him the opportunity to let his imagination run wild with pictures. Starting with Sherlock touching himself because he longed for him so much, passing the most cliché positions that John didn't usually allow himself and ending in him spread under Sherlock in the most Omega position of all: face buried and held down into a pillow, head just tilted to the side to let him breathe, but also giving him a fantastic view of Sherlock ploughing into his drawn up in the air arse, swollen belly gliding over it with every move.
The older Holmes kept calm and seemingly indifferent. “No, but I ensure financial stability for you. You're living on
He heard the Alpha click his tongue, but he didn't sound pissed when he spoke next. “I am a doctor. My flat's just around the corner. You come with me, I need to take a proper look at you.”
A couple of minutes later, he felt Greg shaking his shoulder a little more insistently and gathered consciousness to his surroundings as his voice faded back in.
Then again, Sherlock had felt miserable himself without really knowing why. All this talk about the mythical soul mate business – was this what it really was? Being tortured by your love for someone? He knew he'd felt devastatingly lonely and ached for John's presence in way human words couldn't explain, but he'd also felt those pains intensify irregularly. Was that their bond playing ping-pong with their misery? How useless – that would make them leap through a viscous circle, spiralling into misery until Sherlock passed out again.
Please don't ask or pressure me about other stories. If inspiration doesn't come to me, I won't force myself to write. I do this for free for your enjoyment, I have a real life and real problems and you're not helping me want to work on my stuff with that kind of behaviour. Thank you.
John considered Greg's request and while he didn't fancy ever talking to those people again, he could tell the desperation in the detective's voice and face was genuine. He agreed to come in the next morning, then got ready and left for work.
He retrieved some pants and got his dressing gown, and emerged from the bedroom, finding John cutting some bell pepper in the kitchen.
“You don't strike me as the kind to make friends easily.” Mycroft was pressing all the right buttons at this point and he knew it.
John hadn't mentioned a change of clothes, so Sherlock sat there, back in the sitting room, on the sofa, naked, wrapped in nothing but a towel he'd found. He looked down his bony limbs. Long, and long past slender. There was always a slight shiver to his body and he hadn't been sure about whether it was the drugs or him being way underweight in a long time.
The Omega himself, however, was less than pleased. In his impatience, his annoyance that his plan wasn't working, he got demanding. “How am I not what you expected, John?!”
Facing each other, there were gentle caresses and sweet kisses, sentiments they'd both deny in public. Some time along the line John's hand started travelling from Sherlock bump to his bum, squeezing playfully.
Just as John nearly replied with a 'not really', Sherlock spoke again. “I suppose you will have a hard time finding work that pays well enough, though, Omegas barely earn enough to live anywhere near London, can't imagine the cut an OP has to face, even as a doctor.”
He'd just have to keep trying, nudging John to eat a little more now and then, coaxing him to finally regain his weight. It would take a while, Sherlock knew how difficult it could be to gain weight, though his greatest problem was his metabolism, not his hunger, but the only important thing here was to get John to a safe weight.
“Have you been to the toilet recently?” the Beta man between his legs asked as he cleaned the area as best as he could under the constant blood-flow and Sherlock shook his head, doing his best to keep composed and not let on too much of the hurt and fear he was feeling.
He read the new message from Sherlock and decided it was time to end this. He'd heard enough to be bored again and he'd made his decision some moments ago anyway. “No.”
“No!” John said strictly, wanting to end this argument as quickly as possible. “Not happening, you hear me?”
John, despite being aware that phones weren't allowed inside the hospital, gave it to Sherlock, knowing he'd get it sooner or later anyway. The man tapped away at it for a second, then invited John under the blanket. As their ritual went, John followed the invitation and tucked himself in beside Sherlock, scenting each other a little before falling asleep.
“It does seem the most plausible in all possibilities... But there hasn't been an awful lot of research yet, so it's all very questionable still. Maybe I'm just a very late developer and there isn't even such a thing as a perfect bond.”
It only confused him more. “But then why am I here? I don't understand..” Why pay a fortune for him if he didn't want him?
“Well, your body needs energy to support that little one in there,” John said, his hand lovingly drifting over his now flat stomach, that would usually be concave in this position on his back, “so there is less for you left, which is why you have to eat enough.”
Sherlock nodded. No more words were spoken that evening, apart from 'good night'. But when John did go to bed, he felt warm and weird.
John looked back up at him. Sherlock was already looking like a glowing pregnancy again and John was just 'looking better'. He'd gained a few pounds, yes and was out of the danger zone, but only just so. If and when the Alpha let his body out of its grip again, John would still not be well. They were all just numbers applied to the general public, not a specific body. “Honestly, Sherlock, right now I'm just... terrified.”
“Are you sure, Sherlock? It's likely going to get worse with the longing.. especially with your first heat.. You'll probably curse yourself at some point for having refused to take the help – I've seen it happen, really.”
Sherlock studied both of their faces for a moment. “We'll see.” he then simply stated, brushing the topic off. He didn't like hospitals. Much less did he like having to lay in one, unable to do anything and besides, how hard could it be? A bit of cramping, a bit of pushing, out comes a baby. He could do that. Shouldn't be worse than heat.
“Sherlock is already promised to another Alpha. The contracts have been signed, the lady has paid up, his ceremony is
John suddenly sat up, causing some of the water to splash over the edge of the tub. “Shit, really?! Sorry, I meant to prepare lunch!” John said quickly, hurrying to get out of the water that had turned a little cool.
And still he had not been able to decide. Did he want this child or did he not? Surely he couldn't give it much more time to be thought through – Omega pregnancies were not tolerated to be aborted after passing the eighth week of pregnancy nowadays.
, unbonded Omegas we're not only pheromone radiators, but unbonded Alphas were also constantly of the opinion they had to take them, claim them and nurture them so they would lend them their fertile wombs. Purely homosexual relationships were still frowned upon and definitely never considered to be present. Every Omega needed a strong Alpha with a big cock to care for them; at least, that's what they all seemed to believe.
John sighed happily. Saying he'd missed his mate wouldn't even scratch the depth of this feeling. He said nothing, just revelled in the solid feeling of his mate's fleshier hand in his, seeing Sherlock's belly lead the man's way by now, size coming up to where it's supposed to be at this stage with four pups. It satisfied a deep alpha urge inside him, seeing his bonded healthy and growing with his offspring. Just Sherlock's steps were still a little wonky – the rapidly gained weight didn't help his developed muscles carry him steadily.
“As I already said, it's all your decision. I will not insist on you keeping it and I will not tell you to abort it. You would be the one most affected with your body changing and all. I don't wish to force you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.”
There he was, slowly curling up further and further the more painful his cramps got and knocked the air out of his lungs.
“Yes, not good, but okay. You might have noticed he's gravely underweight for his stage and the pups have stopped in their development as a result. We're pumping him as full as we can without him throwing it all up again, but it'll take a couple of weeks until we can release him. That's when we'll know whether or not the embryos have taken to the belated nutrition and continue growing again.” The doctor explained and John just nodded. They were okay. They were
And still, John opened the door and came to him, he looked down on him with that defensive look and only now Sherlock could understand what it really meant: John acknowledged he'd done something wrong and he didn't want Sherlock to push it any further because he was sorry, he just defensively avoided the 'please, forgive me' part. How people could think John to be the emotional one out of the two of them, he didn't know; his own mood swings, even when being genderless, were much more frequent and strong, John was merely the one that could really feel empathy. People were stupid. Stupid and boring. John wasn't. Well, he certainly wasn't a genius, but he wasn't witless. And, more importantly, he was here and he was cuddling right up against Sherlock's side, a woolly jumper and rough jeans against his still naked form, throwing an arm over his softening middle and pulling him closer protectively and then settling for stroking with his fingertips up and down his side slowly, softly, only whispering touches on his goose flesh, the only sound that of their breathing.
Sherlock's gaze drifted back to him slowly, almost as if he couldn't believe he was talking at him about this right now. “I'm not looking for a mate.” he repeated the old mantra.
Apart from the appointment, it had been a really lazy day and Sherlock couldn't deny he had enjoyed it.
Sherlock drew back to throw him a disbelieving look. He searched John's face for lies and false promises. He didn't find them. “You'd do that for me?”
Sherlock looked beyond offended and outright hurt by John's telling look at him, so it didn't come as a big surprise when his reply was more a quip than anything else. “Well, if I embarrass you-”
John turned around immediately, kneeling beside Sherlock, who had slunk against the brick wall and was eerily still. John spoke to him very softly to not startle him in his state of shock, slowly warning him ahead of touching him. He nudged the brunet to stand up again, helping him pull his trousers back up, buttoning them and, cautiously, hugging him, to give him comfort through his scent; an Omega scent that Sherlock was well used to.
John let out a deep groan, making his laziness known, but got up in the end. “Right, good night then.” he muttered and shuffled his way upstairs.
Sherlock had never told John exactly how he had worked around and managed to shut down the auctioning society that had held him. In general, Sherlock didn't share much of his work with him. He supposed it had to do with some sort of confidentiality, like the police didn't tell the press everything.
A moan escaped the back of his throat as something stirred inside him; something that felt dangerously like nausea.
“You want to help me cook?” John asked disbelievingly, his face staying just as straight as Sherlock's. Still not good, then.
He didn't have much more time to ponder his new surroundings, as heavy footsteps sounded on the stairs moments later. John re-entered the room, stopping when he saw Sherlock and smiling. “You're a bit light for my taste, but cutting out on the drugs should get you there.” he said, walking over to Sherlock, dropping his phone on the coffee table. “Rule number two: No drugs. You won't be craving them any more any way. Rule number one:” he continued, grabbing Sherlock's chin. John pupils were blown as he looked down on him, “You're my bitch now. When I call, you come – in whatever way I want you to. You're clever; you'll know
A long and elegant hand brushing along John's jaw to cup it softly. Instinctively, the Alpha leaned into the touch taking a whiff of his mate's calming scent as his wrist was right there next to the Alpha's nose. All that's happened, the stressed-out doctor still tried to look composed, eyebrows creased a little as the exhaustion showed itself in plain sight. “John,” Sherlock whispered, his free hand coming to coat the back of John's hand, laying it on his belly, “you are anything but incapable. You're an incredible Alpha and you know it. I am only too aware of your wish for independence, but at some point you have to accept that you simply can't do
“You want to go out for dinner today?” John asked, dreamy look on his face. It was ridiculous, really, he knew that, but he couldn't help feeling this levitated, invincible,
John twisted his upper body and pulled his sock up the rest of the way. She looked as sleepy as she sounded. “Well, you know, I trust Sherlock and all, but I do have to get back to my children. I also miss them.”
The Omega, ridden with boredom of months, years of inactivity, felt his heart leap suddenly, practically tasting the adrenalin as it was let loose on him. “Oh, God, yes!” he breathed and dashed after the Alpha.
“Don't you dare! I'm already fighting enough with this whole omega and hormones business, I don't need you to become another hard-to-handle thing!” the younger man replied in a strict, even accusing tone.
“No, I guess not.” he replied, sitting up with a good stretch. He saw Sherlock holding the sticks from the ice lollies and felt really horrible. The children could have choked on them and he'd just fallen asleep. And Sherlock was picking up after him. He cursed himself internally and looked down when he felt his shirt sticking to his body. “Ah, crap.” The pups, eating slowly, must have dripped their treats on him.
“Ah, haah, Sherlock- Sherlock, I-” John tried to warn, but couldn't quite speak around his breathlessness.

“But I have to..” John whispered weakly as Greg went in front of the door to call his sergeant, who immediately grabbed a colleague to take with her to check on Sherlock. “He's pregnant, what if it's something to do with our pups? He's only just entered the second trimester, he could be having a miscarriage-”
“No, really, Greg, I can't. I could have fallen asleep at work, where I sat hours just staring ahead, not taking a sip of coffee, or even here these past few hours, but I just can't. I can't...”
The older Alpha, whose brown hair had a clear red shimmer to it, tilted his head, raising an eyebrow and smirking in such an arrogant way, John wanted to lash out at him for, not only intruding (though Sherlock had clearly expected him), but additionally for his and his assistant's horrendously pretentious behaviour in Sherlock's home.
He looked at his watch, feeling the warmth in his cheeks. Sherlock would call him in fifteen minutes and no new information had been given on services for London. He almost felt confident enough to just ask for a taxi. Almost.
“Ah, you're arguing about your feelings again, huh?” she asked, then continued in a whisper, “John, you have to talk to him!”
Sherlock turned back to his notes and scribbled something down. John took seven toddler-friendly ice lollies out, put one down next to Sherlock's papers and squeezed his arm on his way past. The Alpha waited for John to disappear around the corner into the living room before he freed the hardened fruit smoothie from it's paper wrapping. John, meanwhile, kneeled back down with the five toddlers, getting their attention easily and handing them the treats one by one. They were all the same colour, so there was no fighting over reds or greens; John guessed Sherlock just made one full smoothie and then spread it out among the self-made moulds. He'd cut the cups shorter and split down the side to tack them back together more tightly, creating small moulds, with flat tops for minimal risk and optimal portioning. John couldn't help his smile as he licked on his own ice lolly, his pups first watching, making sure this was edible, then focusing entirely on their new task. John thought it funny how they'd put toys, choking hazards and pointy things in their mouths without care, but looked to him to demonstrate food wasn't dangerous. Most of them were surprised by the cold, as they'd not had anything frozen before, but they seemed to enjoy the taste. Which their father could understand – they weren't too bitter, but also not overly sweet and really quite refreshing.
When he woke up again, the scent of the masked Beta was stronger and there was also the aroma of a cooked meal. He regarded it, laying right beside the door, very likely just within his possible reach. He considered resisting and not eating it – he obviously was of value to whoever kept him there so starving himself would at least get him information. But then there were his pups and even the risk of the food drugging him again wouldn't stop him from nourishing who needed him most.
“But Alphas don't just go share flats with Omegas!” He started to feel ridiculous. He wasn't supposed to contradict an Alpha and still, here he was, reasoning with Sherlock about his own issues.
John's expression fell and he felt a weird sense of disappointment and sadness. He hadn't expected Sherlock to suddenly like his kids. He couldn't explain why he was so unhappy in that moment. Kat noticed it and was confused. She made a noise that was their version of 'papa' and he looked back into her confused face. She was a clever girl. He pulled her into his lap and cuddled her, wearing a fake smile. Luckily, their bond to him was not as sharp as the one they shared with each other, so they couldn't detect the lie just yet, though it would only be a matter of time.
When he looked down at John with a sigh, he met with an amusement he clearly hadn't expected. “Those were your parents?” he asked, still not quite able to get his head around that fact. “
Sorry for the incredibly short chapter, but I just.. don't know. I didn't feel like writing too much to this since there are more visits to the doctor's coming anyway and I have a much more interesting chapter ready and steady for you anyway ;)
John would always love him, he was sure, but if Sherlock ended up rejecting him, unreachable, would their relationship survive that? Unlikely, since John would end up being the last the Omega wants to see. John wouldn't blame him, he had every right to be scared of Alphas, especially John, after what had happened. But how would they cope without each other? Even going back to just living together seemed impossible, not to mention their unborn pups and their destiny.
“I'd like that bath now, my legs hurt.” Sherlock replied a minute later, kissing the top of John's head.
“I want a rocking chair in the nursery. Made of a dark wood. One that looks ancient.” he said, his eyes and voice soft.
Immediately John's expression fell, giving his partner the legendary 'are you kidding me' look. “I'm definitely not getting up now. For once, I'm sitting and I'm comfortable, more or less. You go.” he, too, spoke to the telly. The telly wasn't interested.
“I read it on a couple of forums on the internet. A lot of Alphas said that about their Omegas.” John blinked rapidly.
“John, you are dying. For all the joy you express for me being alive and getting well, you are taking poor care of yourself.”
John grabbed his face and turned it to look at him. Dark blue was staring at him intently spelling out thousands of words and yet telling Sherlock nothing. “Listen to me. Whether or not you lose this pup is irrelevant now, Sherlock.
“Freedom? No offence, Dr Watson, but you don't strike me as an Alpha to treat their Omega with an exceptional amount of love.”
“If that is what you want.. We'll manage somehow, I guess.” John replied and folded his hands in his lap. “I'll just work extra hours for as long as possible and-”
John left his room to get another coffee, his eyelids heavy as fuck, but he couldn't sleep now, not on duty. Besides, Greg could call him any minute.
The guy sounded relatively young and stank of various Alpha scent markers. He detected at least a deodorant, aftershave and shampoo specifically designed to make pathetic Alphas confident in their virility and sex-appeal. “I was here before, but my Alpha just brought me back. I was lead backstage and told to wait by the dorms for you to let me in.” If he was lucky, this guy was new and would fall for it. Damn, he'd have to pick up work-outs again so he could apply his skill set from the army in situations like this. This one guy, he could take down easily, but if someone like that human house at the door crossed his path, he wouldn't stand a chance. He'd have to try his luck.
“No. No, I'm not- no. I'm just curious. That's all. You know I couldn't deal with a relationship right now if I wanted to – which I definitely don't!” John tried to clarify.
John and Sherlock went straight home from there. In the cab, the Omega turned to his companion, feeling able to breathe properly for the first time since Lisa had announced her arrival this morning. “Thank you.” Sherlock turned an inquiring eye on him. “For listening earlier and not just brushing it off. I had nothing to really base my accusations on, so you could just as well have told me to sod off.”
He let go of the knife and reached behind himself, carding his hand into Sherlock's soft curls. He turned his head around and Sherlock pulled away a little, looking back at John for a long minute. The kiss that followed was short and apologetic as well as grateful, from both sides. When it ended, they lingered, breathing each other in. John gave him another quick peck that felt like a little promise before turning back to his vegetables.
John's gaze turned into a loving one several moments later, his hand coming to lay against his mate's cheek. Sherlock leaned down, catching his lips in a slow kiss.
John cast a look to where Sherlock's ankle was bruised and cuffed, gently fighting himself free of the anxiously clinging Omega to search the dead Alpha for keys. After hearing a miserable sound out of Sherlock's throat, John was happy to find a bundle of keys quickly, returning to his mate's side.
“Well, even more so then. John, this pup will be yours. Even though you might think me incapable of feeling empathy – granted, I don't feel any empathy, but I can guess about how you might feel about this pup and it
“What is it, love-” the doctor began to ask innocently, then stopping when he saw Sherlock standing in front of the mirror, trousers still undone. “No!” he grinned, his eyes practically sparkling as he stepped up behind his Omega.
So, yeah.. I'm not completely happy with this, but I've come to accept that I'm simply just a bad writer ^^ I shouldn't use that smiley - it's a dark chapter
“I'm not saying you would. Point I'm trying to make: You don't make decisions without thinking them through. You have thought about this long and hard. I have your back.”
“Well, natural birth is very much out of the question, as you've said yourself on our last visit, so there isn't really much choice, is there?”
The Omega, however, quickly turned around and stopped John, going around to face him and looking him into the eyes with a soft smile as he placed the Alpha's hands on his abdomen to let them continue what they had been doing a moment ago. His look intensified as he slowly drew in a deep breath, deliberately inflating his belly and revelling in the sight of John's pupils dilated instantly. It was only too visible on John's face how he was cursing internally while Sherlock smiled wickedly. He leaned down, sealing the Alpha's lips firmly, an unspoken promise given and he knew John understood, could feel it through their finally fully developed bond and the feelings of gratitude, great anticipation and love rose inside Sherlock as they built inside John.
He didn't watch hungrily as Sherlock fought to do up his buttons on his shirt or the button on his trousers; simply pretended to be occupied with his own clothing.
“Okay, let's say I'll call you in an hour. If you don't know any more by then, I'll send a cab to pick you up. Deal?” Not that Sherlock wouldn't want to be alone with them for more than two hours, but he also didn't want John to be stranded forever.
When he left the bathroom, he asked Sherlock if he minded having them at the table. Sherlock knew it was rather a question of 'is it safe for my child' and he invited them with a hand gesture, engrossed with his microscope.
Complications can upset an Omega. Some Omegas are dysfunctional, however, and deal with it their own way.
“I was hoping you'd eat in the kitchen, with me.” John gently asked, pushing back some stray curls covering Sherlock's closed eyes.
Sherlock sat back up with a small, affirming noise and rubbed his eyes as he stood up, padding back to their shared bedroom.
Sherlock took a long hot shower, leaning against the cold tiles on the wall for half of the time, the beautiful contrast between hot and cold making his blood pressure rise and his body feel alive again.
By the time Sherlock was put down on a leather sofa, he was feeling dizzy from all the movement. Presently, the Alpha brought a bowl with him when he joined them there. He applied a sphygmomanometer, taking Sherlock's blood pressure and dug out a thermometer, sticking it beneath Sherlock's tongue and pushing his mouth shut with one hand. He ran a number of other tests to confirm his suspicion. “What's your name?”
“So,” Sherlock restarted the conversation, feeling too uncomfortable in the awkwardness that had been the previous topic, “how was... your girlfriend?”
John relaxed visibly, sinking back down next to him until he lay facing Sherlock, now looking at him from the corner of his eyes. “Our bodies are just coming down from hormonal high, give it a day or two. We're neither as young as is usual, might need to take time to regenerate the strength and stability.” he answered softly, but moving no further in terms of touching Sherlock in any way.
Sherlock stayed silent throughout breakfast and John didn't try to bring him to eat more than a single slice of bread, jam anything but generously spread on it.
Sherlock shrugged at that. “Haven't the faintest. Hungry?” he asked, already ducking into a restaurant. John followed. Sherlock seemed to know this place very well, addressing the waiter that showed them to their table by name. “22 Northumberland Street, keep your eyes on it.” he said with a nod to a building outside.
“Alright, let's see. There's one.. two.. three... four.” she counted as she took pictures and marked them on the computer. John observed the marks indicating his pups' size and position within Sherlock. They were still four delicate little creatures, but beginning to crowd up the space. The estimations had been right, the growth spurts would start soon.
“I'm Lisa.” stuttered the girl, not looking at either of them. “My parent's mustn't know I'm here, promise you won't tell them, please?”
“Very well. Please make sure to inform reception and urgently see your omega physician.” she insisted. “Have a nice day!”
“They were.. bearable.” he answered, his voice raspy from the lack of use. “No, it was.. the physical pain wasn't the problem, it was more.. there was just so much blood..” he breathed out, turning his face away from John.
“You wouldn't dare, you couldn't go even a day without me, without touching me, without the reassurance that I'm still growing four of your –
Sherlock cursed internally and got up almost violently, stomping over to where the Alpha still sat and shoved the computer away to stretch out over his lap like a cat before rolling in on himself a bit. He still pouted and crossed his arms in emphasis, however.
Sherlock waited a couple of seconds to be completely sure it wouldn't go away, that feeling he wanted to ask John about. “I feel nauseous.”
I know, I know.. I am annoyed by them being this short, too, but, for dramatic purposes, this just works best..^^'
With a start he finally jerked awake properly, out of his trance and he apologised to Sherlock for his absent-mindedness. “That's alright, you've been very busy. I just wanted you to get off the floor. It's not the most healthy place to sleep.”
This time, though, sleep was more peaceful. He'd woken with a tremor shaking his body, but it disappeared after some time and John was sleeping in his arms. He was so glad John was sleeping because for all the instinctive strength the Alpha had built up to aid him, he had actually looked ready to die on his feet. Sherlock could tell he'd slept and eaten even less than himself, which worried him. Never had he seen John go more than 36 hours without either and the soldier was very hard to break to such a point.
He pulled Kat and Alex closer as they finished up, resting in their love as he tried not to think about what may have happened to all his other pups. His first set of twins would be 23 by now. Adults. He shifted gently and put his pups back down on the bed to get the other three and start feeding them.
The Alpha looked at him in awe and somehow John's hand on his abdomen made something click inside his head – they were alive. He and the pups. Alive and in John's loving hands. The pups were alive and growing. They were growing again.
Promptly, the shyness was back. “Well, I've never been..” John cleared his throat. “No one ever dared to place their mouth on me, they just looked... terrified.”
Well, this fic is actually sponsored by someone who contacted me over on tumblr (not sure I may out them publicly like this yet) and at first I was skeptical about whether or not I'd be able to get into this at all, but now I've got scenes playing out in my mind and, Lord, let me tell you, I'm hooked on this darkfic! (It's gonna get dark soon, just you wait. But also a bit fluffy. I can't write without love, sorry, but I just don't dig that. I don't read it, I don't write it. I hope that's okay..)
“Uh, no I was rather thinking because I break a sweat easily and have a tendency for bad morning breath.” He threw her a cheeky smile and saw that it worked instantly. “But thanks for the warning, I'll know not to seek you out alone at night.”
After a bit of glaring at each other, averted his eyes to put down the violin case to lean against his chair. “Very likely since it concerns you, but I don't think I will address it just now.”
Trying to level his breathing, Sherlock pressed out his reply. “I never presented!” He was drawing up his legs onto the seat of his chair now, an attempt to hide his body from the world and, most importantly, from John.
“I imagined no less of him.” the tall man said, approaching the bed with his usual impassive look, though it was clearly tinged with worry. Sherlock would notice his creased suit. The way he finally stood by the feet of the bed, so high on his defences, but not to protect himself, to protect the twitching body of his vulnerable little brother. Like he was building an invisible wall around them. John was included.
His muscles were clamping down so hard on his organs, he couldn't possibly not roll in on himself, shielding his pouting belly. Another sore cry escaped his throat and he was wondering what for. Everything smelt so repulsively strange and wrong, he wanted to flee or block his nose or do
John loomed over Sherlock. The Omega's breath hitched when the doctor touched him, shamelessly, between his thighs. He had him pinned against the sofa. “Yes, sir.”
John appreciated this and, while it would have been nice for once to have someone show he wasn't alone, he was glad he could proof his own strength in this moment.
Sherlock looked a tad embarrassed as he drew back and thanked John in a low tone, but then John found it just as hard to look the Alpha in the eye. “So, exactly what's the plan? Judging by that case you were working when we first met, I assume you don't know where this circle might be sitting or else it wouldn't be there any more. So, are we just going to wait until that Beta leaves the house and then follow her?”
With all his posture and pretending, however, Sherlock finally lashed out as another member of the force insulted the man's professionalism or just his general capabilities.
Sherlock simply looked up from where he was sprawled out on the couch. “I'm pregnant, John, I'm not supposed to do hard work.” he gave as a lazy reply, which seemed to only infuriate the Alpha even more.
He took a paper-clip from Jacob's hand, stopping it on its tracks to an eager and curious mouth. “Not for eating,” he said calmly, shaking his head lightly, paper-clip well in sight. Jacob looked at it with great interest, his brain working through the new information. Rosie made a noise playing with her stuffed dog and promptly, Jacob had a new game to focus on. John got up and walked into the kitchen. “Hey, I know I can't ask you what to do and what not to do in your own flat, but could you give me a heads up about stuff like this laying around on the floor before I let the children loose? I.. don't fancy a cab ride to the ER for someone swallowing shit..”
Unfortunately, John thought, that had been the perfect step stone for Mycroft.“I'd be happy to pay you a 'meaningful' sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
A month later, the living room had been freed of all the boxes and was instead cluttered with sheets of paper and books everywhere. John didn't get it, but Sherlock swore there was a logical order to it all. The Omega was just glad that he was still there and accepted it all.
John lowered himself down from his elbows again slowly, relaxing gradually as Sherlock's finger pushed in and out of his hole by inches and his lips circled the helmet, he hollowed his cheeks, drawing another huffed grunt from the Alpha. So, Alpha and Omega cocks were alike, then, same areas more or less sensitive than others. He just had to do what John had done on him and what he had imagined John to do ever since. However, he was aware that taking down all of John would be impossible, not even because of gagging. He had to cover up his plan to not expose John to his apparent embarrassment any further, so he let his free hand push up the muscular thigh and had it play with the Alpha's testicles for a moment, all the while teasing the tip of his cock, before he slid his slender fingers up to the base of it, massaging the skin that covered his knot.
It was two nights later, that they both lay in bed, peaceful and untouched. John had had a stressful day at the clinic and simply was too tired to start anything exhausting. That's when Sherlock turned his head to look at the other man. “John,” he addressed.
“You sure you're okay looking after them tonight?” John zipped up his jacket to shield himself against the cold outside, but stood locked in place as he watched Sherlock put Kat's sock back on her foot. Again.
Sherlock, whilst already risen out of his mind palace, remained in his position, not reacting to John, not because he didn't want to speak to him, but because he wanted the Omega to initiate the conversation. After a while, John cleared his throat carefully. It would have to do, Sherlock thought and opened his eyes to look at him, but still not speaking. He looked at John with a clear expression of expectation. John turned his head slightly as if checking Sherlock wasn't addressing someone else. Eventually, though, John did speak. “I, er... can I ask you a question?”
Mrs Hudson must have heard them because she came stumbling out of her flat with Alex in her arms. “Oh, you are a saint, Mrs Hudson. Thank you so much!”
She smirked proudly. “I was afraid you'd say something like economics. So what's your name, Mr Doctor?”
Lestrade chuckled lightly, then turned to take his leave. “Oh, and, uh, Sherlock? You're looking good for a change. Couple of extra pounds suit you well. You look healthy.”
John was still rolling his knuckles against the slim back, his fingers exhausted by now, when he was beginning to feel really tired.
Without further debate, John took off his shoes and climbed in beside Sherlock, who frowned in disapproval at feeling his spine under his hand as John carefully draped himself over him a little. John just felt his insides scream in bliss at being so close to his mate again and leaving scent on him this way again.
listen and it didn't matter that John wasn't very good with all this 'tell me what you feel' business because Sherlock might never tell him anyway and John would not ask, would just always stand there and give that smile when the situation arose; the smile that felt like home,
“Hm.” the Omega grunted in reply. “Mind you, I can't say I'm a big fan of his. Not really someone who inspires trust in him.”
Sherlock was still on medication to help him sleep through most of his nightmares, so he often woke drowsy after sleeping through a night.
“John,” Sherlock began more seriously, “we're going to have babies. Four babies. I want everything to be ready before it's time and I want it done before I'm too immobile for the tasks. I'm in my fifth month of pregnancy and you heard Dr. Field – I'm only going to grow faster from now on, which means I'll qualify as my own household in about a month and a half. We need to get this done.”
“I.. Yes. Sherlock look at me. I'm... I'm not good. What if it stresses me out too much? What if I.. What if I shout at it? Or hit it?”
At some point, Sherlock tilted his head upwards, pulling John's head down with one hand as he cuddled into the smaller body and pressed soft kisses to his mate. John returned them happily. He'd always been very fond of kissing his partners and Sherlock was no exception.
Yes, he was kinky about this whole pregnancy deal and yes, he would, should Sherlock let him, enjoy and relish every moment and bit in his Omega's now ever-changing body.
been so much as interested in sex and far less any emotional bond, hadn't been able to understand others, who were. It was John. John had changed him. Was it bad? In a way it was, he supposed. When he'd first seen John, he was immediately tied up by the story he told and yet never told a word about. John was different from everyone else. He wasn't
Turning into the alley, John saw the problem. Sherlock was certainly a strong Omega, but a skinny and light frame like his was still very easily overcome by an Alpha especially in rut. His eyes were wide in a silent plea as he looked over at John, all colour drained from his face.
I'm too much into this story. I'm sorry, but the entire concept and thought around it is just genius and I don't even know how to thank myself.
Gentle hushing noises were released as the Omega clawed at him, whining, mewling, his whole body shaking while he tried to bury his nose even deeper in John's neck.
It seemed nowadays they spent a lot of time just staring at each other intensely. It seemed nowadays it always ended in some sort of sexual encounter.
Some people liked to catalogue scents by icomparing them to fruits or flowers or other natural scents. John never did that. He wanted to smell the human being, not something that smelt similar because he was thinking about it. He wanted to smell Sherlock, not
His eyes snapped open, he hardly dared to turn his head to the side, finally having the sound of soft snoring reach his ears. As his careful gaze at last took in the sight of John... Did John-? Had he-? Oh, god, he didn't-!? Sherlock reached a trying hand towards his neck, brushing over every inch of skin he could reach. Nothing. He sighed his relief.
He fell asleep despite himself and woke up to John gently caressing his shoulder, saying his name. “Dinner's ready, you need to eat.”
The world is biased and John has difficulty finding his proper place in it. Luckily, Sherlock knows how to help.
After some moments of silence, the Alpha made a stronger attempt to drop the tone of this conversation.“Would you like tea?”
The door opened and John stepped in, blinking against the great moisture in the air, the steam swooshing out through the barely opened door. “Sherlock?” he asked again and Sherlock couldn't help it and smiled lovingly at the smaller man.
The DI, the Beta whose scent John kept recognising and could now finally pin-point to him, answered him for Sherlock. “It's Jennifer Wilson's phone, he said the murderer has it. Must've fallen out of the case.”
. Have you observed yourself sleep lately? You toss around for the better part of the night, only to curl up against me. The last time I've seen you like this, was the first few weeks we lived together. Please, do us all a favour and avoid either of us going mad.” Sherlock asked of him, leaning down to ask for permission on a kiss, which was quickly granted. “Now, feed and fuck me, my incredible Alpha!”
“Don't be simple, John.” he accused, turning around with a smile though, leaning down to kiss the Alpha. “Now, how about breakfast? I'm starving.” he complained, earning a soft chuckle from his mate.
Like this, it never took John long to come. It was just the setup for a quick fuck. Sherlock didn't mind at all. Once he was spent, John pulled out and, while taking off the condom, buried his face in the Omega's rear, eating him out. John always made sure Sherlock could come in whatever way.
it! What if something goes wrong? What if our child has a disability? What if it dies without even being born just yet?!-”
“No, no. Just checking.” John answered giving a small smile that was returned before leaning down for a quick peck that ended in a deep kiss.
He couldn't bare and never wanted it to end, the symphonic melody to which John rocked their bodies. Gliding in and out of his body, hitting that one spot that seemed so secret, but in plain sight for John. The unbelievably talented orchestra that was merely John's mouth, granting freedom to croaked moans and stifled cries of incredulous sensations and yet Sherlock was the only one to ever hear, to know and not to tell. It was theirs. His. John was his and he was John's.
“I figured someone would come in if they thought I was asleep.” Sherlock said monotonously. He opened his eyes and turned his head to regard the tall blond man.
“You finally got the suppressants then?” Sherlock asked him over dinner, which John found peculiar, chatting wasn't normally in the Alpha's interest. Then again, he'd often asked John about medical stuff, perhaps he was just interested in his unusual biology.
John came back and thanked him, sitting down across from him with an apple, caressing his daughter's cheek. Sherlock saw his gaze lingering on her milk. John wasn't stupid, he'd notice there was less of it there than when he'd left. He smiled so softly it was almost unnoticeable and hid behind biting into his apple.
“Because I like holding you. I like your hand on our little one.” John let his hand draw another circle on Sherlock's stomach for emphasis, placing another kiss on his lips. It pleased how easily he could make John feel better, calmer. “Do you have to work tomorrow?” he asked, hoping that, no, he didn't.
Sometimes he got distracted by other thoughts and John would eventually pull him out of it in the late evening hours to have dinner and then go to bed, not caring whether Sherlock wanted to or not. There was sex before sleeping, so Sherlock always wanted. With his heat, he had discovered he was disgustingly addicted to having John's thick penis up his tight arse. He just felt complete, sated, full, like the whole in his heart was stuffed by John showing him his love as he gently, lazily gave slow thrusts, cradled him in his lap and pushed him up and down against the headboard or, rather rarely, leaned over his back as he served him from behind in a frantic and punishing rhythm that left them both breathless. The very best thing about their bond, however, was when John bit him, favourably during sex after he'd whispered compliments and praises into his neck. Warm breath caressing the tender flesh of the ever-open wound as his mate filled with overwhelming passion and the longing to be closer to John, although they were already as close as physically possible.
When he'd first started doing these, Sherlock had grunted at the silly behaviour John was displaying, but eventually just accepted that this was what parents did. Now, not a sound came from the kitchen while John made learning a game for them.
was both relieving and confusing. Relieving, because John wasn't actually screaming at him, just talking to him calmly.
“Honestly, I don't understand why you're making such a fuss about it. It's not like we're packing your things!” she tutted in amusement, sitting down across from him.
“It's not working.” he replied in an amused, superior fashion. Sherlock reminded him of himself a little; feisty, never shy to speak his mind. Most of all, he was trying to be manipulative. What he didn't seem to realise was, that John had other plans. But he'd learn, John thought. Soon enough.
