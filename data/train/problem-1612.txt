Well, so much for that. “I love you too.” I replied.
I rang John, handed the phone over, and a few seconds later, we were back in business.
Yet Sherlock had insisted, even seemed to have done research on the thing somehow, and his devotion to his role of best man I found frankly quite touching. Traipsing around between noisy pubs may not have been the most ideal way I could imagine my “last night” with Sherlock, but I’d bite.
My head was pounding, the nausea was not going anywhere, and I started to cry. I rolled into a fetal position, searching for inspiration.
“Mycroft is so mean…” Sherlock pouted.
“Alright, alright,” I huffed out. “John is not a trained assassin.”
“See!” John beamed. “That’s a lovely thing for you to say,”
After about an hour or so of this, the crowd seemed to thin. Some had volunteered to text others, the few remaining seemed to almost enjoy their vigil, as if having endured some act of God together. So, feeling my duty dispensed with, I bid my farewell and headed home.
I huffed a bit irritatedly. “Can be arranged,” I stated. A text to John.
“John, you see..has a past. Well,” I stammered, “I guess we all have a past. But John’s past involves a bit of a double life..yes..a double life. And his other life is…uh..well quite different from the life of which we are all aware. Yes, John, unassuming, pleasant John, who we all know and love..well he’s actually, or he actually was a….what shall I say? uh well,” a thought struck. “Yes, he was a trained assassin.” There was a collective gasp, bewilderment, shock, disbelief.
“So, I’m afraid, um, no wedding today, folks. Perhaps you could all go out together somewhere as you are all dressed up.” There, I thought. I felt rather pleased. I thought that was tied up pretty well with a bow. But then I double checked. The reverend: still ashen, looking worse actually. The wedding goers: equally displeased, gasping, tearful, shaking their heads, talking amongst themselves. Ah, well.
“All the time,” Sherlock said simply. He smiled ruefully. “I just don’t do tears.”
And then things began to slide a bit. Perhaps I’d somehow miscalculated the amount of alcohol I could hold, and then he was not particularly forthcoming about his output of urine at that fourth place. But no matter, the pleasant buzz I’d been trying to maintain started to deepen, commandeer more neurons than I’d planned on, affect my balance, my ability to maintain visual acuity, the quality of my speech, and, and…
My breath changed, becoming shallow and ragged, easily giving me away if not for John’s current mental state. I shifted over and faced the railing. We continued to tease each other, and then,
“Silence, the three of you. You’ll ruin the experience I’m so desperately trying to orchestrate here. Leave at once,” I ordered. They returned to their faces of distress and did as I asked.
“I feel everything you are saying, and I can’t stand the thought of not making love to you again,” I said with such emotion in my voice.
Sherlock:
“Listen,” he cut in, sounding desperate. “I don’t know what’s happening to me…I don’t really know who I’ve been or where I’m going. But I know this: what we had last night, I have GOT to have it again, do you understand? I’ve GOT to…..SOON…..A LOT.......So how can I get married? What am i going to do? Stand next to Mary in a church and then drag you into a closet somewhere? And then come to Baker Street tomorrow morning? Don’t you see?” he pleaded with me.
Sherlocks breath quickened. “So you’re showing me you can get me aroused again ten minutes after I have an orgasm? Is that it?’ Sherlock moaned, starting to writhe in pleasure.
“Oh my dear,” John said, sliding down to lay next to Sherlock, taking him in his arms. John held the photo behind Sherlock’s head, continuing his dialogue with his beautiful boy. “Do not worry, young man. If you ever see those kids again, you point them out to me.” His voice had become hard, quiet, fierce. “I will take each one and make them sorry they were ever mean to you. And when you grow up, I’m going to move in with you, and I’m going to be your best friend, and never let you be sad again.”
He put both forearms to each side of my head and he raised his beautiful face above mine. “I’m going to come,” he panted. “You’re going to make me come just with what you’re doing, and I want you to see it.”
I pictured waking up tomorrow morning, alone, engulfed again in my “new” life, John and Mary patching things up, slowly. John feeling renewed in his commitment to her. What had I been thinking? I pounded my fists against my head.
“Hmmmm,” Sherlock pretended to think. “No,” he said flatly, “not a good idea.”
The phone beeped and I grabbed it like my life depended on it.
Then, his words coming out sleep slurred, he said the two most beautiful things, up there with "Possibly a serial killer," or "Mycroft is jealous of you...," things like his.  He said,
“Yeah, I was lonely at uni too. Wish I’d been with you then. Could have kept you company,” John said, leering and grinding his hip into Sherlock’s thigh.
I knew this like I knew my name.
After a moment, he leaned back and looked me straight in the eye. “I love you, John Watson” he said, his eyes serious, but the barest hint of a  smile.
That this was right.
Free?
God, how did this feel so good? I marveled. His mouth.. what can I say about his mouth?
John:
And Sherlock could hug him back.
I suddenly remembered the feeling of grinding into him last night, actually having forgotten that this was the
Then, particularly if I’d imagined holding him as I fell asleep, the dreams became frankly more sexual. I still feel aroused as I remember it, clearly knowing I was asleep, yet getting so hard at the same time. His lips on my neck, his breath in my ear, his hands skimming down my side, stroking my cock…
Tears welled up in my eyes. “I can’t wait,” I said huskily, trying not to let the sob rising in my throat reveal itself over the airwaves.
“John,” Sherlock spat out, his body tense. “Stop talking!” he pleaded. “Everything you’re saying is making it worse!” he squeezed John tightly, and growled through his teeth, attempting to clamp down on his heart.
“Wha….?” she stared, her lovely mouth open. “The best man?! That’s not how its supposed to work, John…” she said, rather foolishly.
my heart.
“Boy, you’re on this picture kick, aren’t you?” but Sherlock seemed to think. “I do have one here,” he said, almost shyly.
And that, I’m afraid, was that.
“Hey,” I whispered. “That was fantastic, so intense, god, so intense,” the slur almost completely gone from my words, though I still felt an extra layer of giddy, no doubt alcohol induced.
Mary at the door. “John,” she sounded worried. “John..” a bit louder.
First off, I didn’t even believe the first part, that my access to him would be uninterrupted, that he’d be jumping up from dinner tables full of crying children to come chase around with me. Though knowing John, he’d much rather be racing toward risk and disaster than wiping small noses. Nonetheless, at a certain point, limits on his availability would be inevitable.
How could you describe this? What I was feeling? Certainly a little lightheaded, giddy even. Prone to laughing.
And then there he was, reaching for me, sliding his had over my hip, my thigh, and there,
“Things where you say what you feel, how I matter to you,” Sherlock said, hiding his face again in John’s neck. They both sighed.
! Anything, anything could be happening. He could be giving in, changing his mind, overwhelmed with guilt, smacking himself on the forehead…
But then, doubt set in. What a responsibility. What if John was just confused, or sick, or had cold feet? I pushed on, holding my breath as if I were defusing a bomb. “But John, you’ve planned a whole wedding…you love Mary…I can’t…”
Sherlock gripped my shoulders in a way that thrilled and terrified me. He knelt too, his eyes drilling into me, as he brought his face closer to mine. Beautiful. Overpowering. I couldn’t breathe but this thought stalked forth:
It opened me up and unpacked me, before I knew it?
I am very good at pretending. I can pretend with grieving widows, wary suspects, terrified accomplices, anyone with whom I need to pretend, in order to get where I needed to be. So many chess pieces to be removed from the board til I got to checkmate.
He pointed ahead of him. “Bed!” he ordered.
Sherlock smiled wryly and turned to wrap his arms around John and bury his head in his chest. “There are few eras in my life that I do not wish you were a part of. I would have liked for them to have plopped you in the crib next to mine at the hospital where I was born.”
Home! I started to breathe, but my heart pounded and my hands shook.
John’s mind went on and on, as John’s cock was reeling from the outrageous, delicious, breathtaking pressure of Sherlock’s belly against it. John’s mouth stayed shut, but his eyes gave him away, when just the tiniest of tears welled to the surface.
“Jesus” John moaned, his ankles locked around Sherlock’s waist, his cock stiffening with each thrust, his eyes rolling back with the intense pleasure of their bodies joined in this way. “You see what you do to me?” he asked.
He came toward me, stumbling. In the most innocent and minute of ways, he just reached out a hand, just a dusting of contact, a small touch, to my knee. Lingering there, near my body.
Sherlock:
Still, that was the faintest part of the experience. Mostly, I knew this was terrible, what I was doing, cowardly to not have figured this out sooner, spared her this “day of the wedding” debacle. When it was all said and done, I knew it was my own fear and weakness that had brought us to this place, raking her over these coals. And the only thing that could save me, and her, and heal this ugly wound I’d slashed into her, was time.
“Okay,” the doctor said, with an impish grin, gently returning Sherlock to sitting next to him. “Now I want to see the picture.”
I attacked (and it felt like an attack) this ritual that would be the beginning of my end, with my characteristic verve and perfectionism. There was a certain level of intoxication that I believed it was my responsibility to insure, so that we could have the right spirit to endure the night, without becoming so overly saturated that either of us took ill or passed out. I decided we should visit bars on the streets where we’d found a corpse; quite meaningful, I reasoned.
As other people entered, they were quickly informed of the turn of events. Some of them approached me directly, and I did my best to review the “facts” of the case for all of them, adding in the appropriate grave nod and sympathetic tone as needed. In truth, I was glad to be over with this, and couldn’t wait to get back to Baker Street to await my reunion with John, but I’d agreed to stay and see to all of these idiots, and stay I would.
my breath started hitching in my throat, becoming faster and shallower.
Her outrage continued, as I deserved it to. At one point, she threw me out of the house. I pounded down the sidewalk, only to sit myself on the curb, attempting to regain control of my breathing and delay the next round of vomiting. Never had I been so affected by emotional anguish, and I’d seen my share. I don’t think I’d ever felt so responsible for causing pain to another, and with this physical reaction as the punishment, I’d try to avoid it in the future.
No, given the importance of this person, and the enormity of what I was about to lose, no, this was the worst night of my life, to be certainly followed by the worst day of my life. The night before John Watson would be married, and the day he would leave me forever.
I did my best with coat and the shirt, but I was having trouble with coordination. Every time he kissed me, my neck, my shoulders, he groaned as if he’d not eaten in days and I was his only food. All this delicious outpouring from him went straight to my cock, (and actually, my heart,) and I felt such an urgency to devour him as he was doing to me. I felt dizzy, my breath shallow—I think I figured out swooning, not really believing before now that there was such a thing.
The phone rang. I started:
I played the scene over and over in my head.
“I can’t believe this! This is highly irregular…are you sure? I can’t just let you disperse a room full of people based on this. I have to speak to the bride or groom,” he said, seemingly pleased that he’d thought of something, anything, to say.
keep running with me, he’d keep climbing the stairs at Baker Street, he’d keep leaning over my shoulder as we researched hypotheses on the internet, breathing hard with me as we tackled whoever needed tackling, smiling his approval with his beautiful smile when something finally clicked or I figured it all out.
Something dawned on me. I spoke slowly, tears coming back to my eyes. “This…does…not…feel….like a choice,” I ground out. She flinched. “A key does not…wake up in the morning and ask…’which lock shall I fit today?” I said, my face crumbling into a sob.
John leaned forward in his chair, ever so slightly, and my heart leapt. I could barely keep a coherent thought, but I somehow sensed his coming toward me. He continued to lean forward, still teasing, playing this stupid game. What?? What now?? Was he actually falling out of his chair?? Into my lap?
“Well,” Sherlock shifted on the bed and pulled slightly away from John. “Probably lonely.”
Holding him like that, I felt such emotion, such tenderness, such.....love, but somehow it just seemed too much, too soon to say; I should wait.
I rolled my head to the side and scanned the room with one eye. The throbbing in my head intensified and no flatmate. I called as loudly as my invalided state would allow. “Sherlock! Where the bloody hell are you??” Silence.
I let out a sob of relief. I felt the blood return to my limbs, and the lightheadedness eased.
Consciousness and recollection swam toward me, along with the profound disappointment of awaking to the apparent state my body was in.
I started thrusting my hips toward him, and he groaned,
The bed hit my legs and I fell back, inching back onto the blankets, holding his gaze. The slight break in the action required by maneuvering helped me get my bearings a bit more, slightly reduced this overwhelming crescendo I’d felt myself heading toward. He was facing me now, both on our sides, his breathing heavy, his brow furrowed as he looked into my eyes, slowly stroking the side of my face. He stroked down further on my neck, my shoulder, just lightly dusting his fingertips, cataloguing my every inch. He started to caress my chest, gently circling around the left nipple. This turned out to be incredibly arousing, a bit surprising, not something I’d been on the receiving end of too often, well, frankly because I was always focusing on her nipples,
Sherlock smiled his small, knowing smile. “You are perfect” he said, regaining his rhythm with renewed intensity.
“Yes, well, I have to be pretty miserable.”
Awaiting no further instruction, I held up my hand and drew the attention of those gathered.
“When’s the last time you had a good cry?” John asked, raising up on his elbow to look down at his lover. He was worried he might be pushing things a bit, but he sallied forth nonetheless.
Despite the momentary flood of arousal during my call with Sherlock, my hangover seemed to have returned full force, accompanied by perhaps a migraine headache and a panic attack. I’d called Mary from the cab, the most dreadful phone call I’d ever made.
All the alcohol reduced my ability to form thought just about down to zero, leaving my lizard brain free to take the wheel. All that was left for me was sensation. I wanted to wrap my arms around him as if my life depended on it, but momentarily, I froze. What a feeling, to kiss him. I could taste all the alcohol and the longing and the passion in his lips, his tongue, making me dizzier and breathless. He moaned while his mouth opened mine, and I thought I’d dissolve into him just by that alone.
"Undid embarrassing situations, mostly. Got my sister out of a couple of scrapes. Used it for the occasional date. Time travel is great for practising pick up lines."
I'm sorry, I feel like I'm rambling. I don't do well on less than seven hours of sleep and I've been sort of stressed lately.
“....Maybe another time. In person. Maybe.”
The Champions and their partners were lined up one behind the other at the entrance to The Great Hall. Janine was with another Beuxbatons boy, with linked arms and flirting in hushed French (though John was pretty sure Janine had a boyfriend back in France). Moran was with a tall, blonde girl from Durmstrang, and they weren't talking at all. If it weren't for the fact that Moran's hand was almost clinically held on the small of her back, he doubted that they knew each other at all. John could just about hear the sounds of flutes and stringed instruments tuning up behind the door, and the buzzing of hundreds of excited voices inside. His heart sped up rapidly.
But this time, he’s not alone. He senses it from the moment he wakes up without even needing to look. When he does, his anxiety softens and his pain sets itself aside, just a little.
Sherlock looked up around the room cautiously. "Where is he?"
"But it's progress, isn't it?"
Once they're done and John paid ('No, I insist, Sherlock. I didn't pay for the ballet, I can pay for this), they walk to the station together, barely a centimetre of space between them.
"It's alright. I'm good. Great, even. I'll never get used to magical medicine." John smiled. Mary exhaled in a way which sounded like a laugh, then he felt her lips crash into his. John suppressed his surprise and relaxed into the kiss. He wasn't sure why it felt so odd - they'd kissed before. A couple of times. Luckily Mary pulled away quite quickly and gave a small shy grin.
"So young, yet so intelligent. A mind in a league of my own, almost. I've been trying to get your attention for a while but..." Moriarty sighed.
"No guarantees, though. I'm starting to think this whole thing you're doing is part of some social experiment."
Moran repeated Janine's actions, and brought out a scaley monkey-like creature with a hollow head, filled to the brim with water. "The Kappa." Mcgonagall said, holding the bag out to John. He inhaled and put his hand in, jumping slightly as he felt a creature land on his palm. He didn't even need to see what it was. He already knew that the winged, serpentine creature in his palm was -
Sherlock went down to breakfast the following morning at 7am. He sat with John and Lestrade - as long as there were no visitors and it was not the first assembly of the term, houses were encouraged to mix - and poured cornflakes into a bowl, only to stir it and watch it turn soggy in the milk.
“Okay. And if it is? Are you really going to be much use against him right now? No offence, but you’re a bit of a mess. You’re going through withdrawal, you’ve barely eaten or slept, you look like you could collapse any second. I suggest, as your friend and your doctor, that you take the night off and recharge your batteries.”
They lean back against the wall of a building together, John's stomach sinking in disappointment, when suddenly Sherlock starts giggling. "That was your plan? Pretend I was your foreign boyfriend to get a discount on tickets?"
“There. Done. Surely there can’t be any more balloons needed? They're bloody
"You were supposed to wake me you know," John said as they left the compartment.
Earth is… chaotic.
"All in good time, Sherlock. I've barely woken up, and I can't be bothered to find him with all these people around. But I'm sure you'll love him. He's gay. And you have a thing for the strong, natural leader types, right?"
"Which part, running out of a theatre? Or the fact that you broke into one in the first place?"
John smiles properly this time. "I love you."
"What always comes, but never arrives?" the eagle said, in a voice barely above a whisper, to which Sherlock snorted and John sighed. He knew that Ravenclaw's password had always been a riddle, which only Ravenclaws could apparently solve, but with one of them drunk and the other a slow Gryffindor...
"Babe, we really didn't."
I like science too, by the way. Well biology mostly. I sort of have to if I’m going to become a doctor. And chemistry is good too. Not physics. Physics can go fuck itself as far as I’m concerned.
“One pain in the arse older brother.”
John swears under his breath, but then forms an idea in his head. He sighs at Sherlock. "Sorry, love. Maybe next time, eh?"
When Sherlock woke up the next morning after a slightly less troubled than usual sleep, he knew from the warmth of a smaller body next to him and the harsh texture of the plain starched mattress that he was still in John's bed, which surprised him, as he assumed that someone would have ushered him away at this point. Nonetheless, he decided not to question it, and he scooter over closer to John, wrapping himself around him, breathing in his scent, a small smile forming for the first time in days -
"Yes, I know that. Why are we in the Zoology section? Your care of Magical Creatures homework?"
“Don’t go into work today. The disappearance of your wife warrants a day off,” Sherlock says from the kitchen.
He yelled up the staircase, “Pink!"
“But I need you!” John yells this before he can stop the words from falling out, and instantly the air sobers and the room falls silent. Sherlock opens his mouth to respond, then closes it, frowns, his eyes soft and confused in a way that makes John’s chest tighten. Does he know? He looks like he’s on the verge of knowing, with the same look on his face as just before he solves a case, the moment where everything is nebulous and urgent, before the dam finally breaks.
Is taller than trees Up, up, up it goes,
"I didn't write much."
I wish you had gotten the chance to meet Redbeard. He would have liked you, I know he would. He liked anyone I liked. Or gave him food. Or didn’t kick him off the sofa. Still, however low his standards, he would have liked you and you would have liked him too.
"Alright, alright!" Greg held his hands up in defence. "I'm sorry I made a comment which expressed an opinion. It didn't mean anything, Mycroft, and Molly: you don't have to turn everything everyone says into a feminist thing!"
Write back soon with your stories from France. Is it sunnier there than it is here? Have you been visiting lots of art museums and historic sites and whatever else it is an intelligent family does on holiday? Have you eaten any snails yet? If so - you poor thing.
“I’m leaning more towards the latter.”
When John left the stadium, Mary left too, back to Beuxbatons' carriage, where she knew she would be alone.
“There. Done,” he says as he stands up. “Anything else? Water? A blanket? Painkillers?”
"I suppose we are."
John quickly realised that no one had spoken for several seconds and that they had been staring at each other for just as long. He cleared his throat.
“Anderson?!” Sherlock splutters. “That incompetent fool? He’s a minor deity at best. The place will be in chaos within a day!”
"We should probably - ah - assign roles," Sherlock murmurs.
He swallows, gets his breath back and fights the urge to pass out from his raging headache. Behind his back, his fingers twist and struggle against the ropes binding his hands. The knots are by no means amature, but it shouldn’t take long to release them. “Five, seventeen…” he coughs and shudders.
"Angry? Christ, Sherlock, of course not. That would be cruel."
“You’re really not.”
“You’re… happy about it.”
“Of course not. She and her entire forensics team couldn’t solve the case after three dead bodies. This woman -“ Sherlock gestured to the body on the floor – “needs the best minds to solve this case, and it just so happens that the next best one available is yours.”
If you could write back soon confirming my deductions that would be appreciated. I would also like it if you told me more about yourself as well. Writing to you does provide a decent distraction from boredom.
But now she's God knows where, doing God knows what, for God knows how long." John grimaces, rubbing at his temple as though it would soothe out all his tangled thoughts inside. "So yeah, I'm glad you told me what you did, last night. Because it's going to be a hell of a lot easier to divorce someone you were never really married to."
"You're still considering dropping out?!"
Then Karlssen returned, carrying John in his arms, his robes soaked in blood and Sherlock's stomach turned.
She walks in on her first day of work soaking wet, her blonde hair turned dark from the heavy rain and laughing as she shakes out her umbrella indoors. "This is rather ominous for the first day of work, isn't it?" She jokes, white teeth on show. The other doctors and nurses laugh with her and introduce themselves, welcoming her to 'the clinic family'. (Complete bullshit.) John pays her no interest. New nurses are always coming and going, after all, when NHS salary turns out to not be enough and maternity leave takes priority. He feels her eyes bore into the back of his head as he sits, unresponsive, and going through paperwork, sticking out like a sore thumb among the rest of the staff who have already fallen for her charms.
“You do? You’ll show me?” John’s eyes widened with his smile. “Go get it, mister!” and he slapped Sherlock’s arm playfully.
Determined? There, way in the back, if the guilt settled down to a low roar, there was this other sense of what this was.
“Okay,” John said mildly. He had learned that there were moments like this, not usually awash in tears, but times when Sherlock was frustrated with himself, the world, everyone in his path. He’d pace the flat, clench his teeth, and shake his fist, not being able to control what he desperately wanted to. At those moments, John had learned that it was best to say nothing at all, as saying anything (“you’re being an idiot,” “you’re completely brilliant,” “Earl Grey okay?”) would just further the spiral into angry outbursts. In those moments, John would slow his breathing, try to relinquish any frustration he himself was feeling, and just send peaceful thoughts Sherlock’s way.
“Last night..” sounded strange to me, but still seemed somehow appropriate. For weeks, I’d been noticing urges to talk more honestly with him, about what, I wasn’t sure. To thank him, I guess. To tell him all the things I wanted to after he died, how important he was to me. To tell him how much and why I valued him. I may be playing “blogger” for him, but words were not necessarily my speciality. Sherlock could crank out words by the bushel, but they were rarely about relationships or emotion. So in this, we were quite the pair—two blokes, desperately committed to each other, falling away, rejoining, most things left unsaid.
…! my mind supplied. Oh well, not the first time I’d snatched tragedy from the jaws of delight, and probably not the last. I felt well prepared for my role as bearer of bad news, and spied the reverend among the crowd.
Actually, I’d been dreaming about him since the moment I left. But then, the dreams became more confusing, more…more emotional. I actually began imagining him rescuing me, or at least finding me somehow, and we’d finish off what we needed to together. Then I’d remember, with great regret, that he’d never come find me, as much as I might be longing for that, because I’d seen to it. Not only would he never be able to find me, he would not even be looking, as I’d so convincingly died to one and all (or almost all).
John considered what he said next. “You can be however you want with me,” he said, his voice returning to gentleness, kissing Sherlock’s shoulder.
about John’s life, our bride groom to be, have been…revealed.” An unbidden image of he and I writhing on the floor flooded my brain, taking my breath. I shook my head vigorously and continued.
“So, how’s it going?” I had a little speech planned about last night, but I thought I’d just ignore it for as long as I could.
I’d wandered through St. James Park and Trafalgar Square as long as possible. Occasionally I’d sit and stare a bit, or cry, but mostly I walked about, trying to think reassuring thoughts or distract myself by deducing passersby.
Sherlock pulled gently out of John, and buried his face in his neck. John’s breath sounded like he’d just stopped running. “Jesus,” he laughed the laugh Sherlock loved the sound of. “How did I get on without this in my life? What in the hell did I do?” he mused, in (almost) mock disbelief. “What did I care about? I’m just not sure,” he went on, pulling the detective close to him. “You are just so marvelous,” he said, and Sherlock raised his head, his small smile widening just slightly, his eyes shining.
“Yes,” John continued, “meeting in the nursery—now that would have been something. I wonder if you were some kind of brilliant baby, that would have been standing and running and climbing on things when the others of us were just rolling over.” John chortled at his own joke. “Wait a minute, “ he said. “Baby pictures! We are going to your folks’ place next weekend, aren’t we? Ring up Mummy Holmes and tell her to drag out all the baby pictures! Yes- that will be a fantastic way to get to know you.” John practically clapped his hands in delight.
Sherlock and John: drunken groping, almost no words exchanged, barely a thought registered, easily erased the morning after.
That was generous of her. Truth be told, we hadn’t had all that much sex lately. Not the point.
“You don’t have to do this, you know..” her voice regaining clarity and strength. “I know you love me. You don’t have to make this choice…”
So that’s what he did now. Except now, miracle of miracles, he could also pull him into his embrace, meeting every anguished cell in Sherlock’s body with a calming one in his own, breathing in concert with him, stroking his hair.
“Sherlock…” John’s breathing was heavy.
I could feel the joy crumple into guilt, sadness, as the realization of what had occurred today revisited with a stab. His face fell; he looked almost panicked.
“Not quite,” John said, and Sherlock walked toward the bed and gracefully sat next to John, placing the photo under his pillow. “What?” Sherlock asked softly, a fond smile on this lips.
“Six,” Sherlock intoned, very slightly raising the octave of his voice, as if he were playing along with John as his young self.
“I’m sad,” Sherlock said sadly, continuing in the part of himself as a child, his voice soft.
“Jesus, I want you so much,” I groaned into his ear, and his mouth found mine again.
I waited what felt like an eternity. Was he thinking? Re-writing? Letting me down gently??
I sighed into his shoulder. “No, no you’re right. That is what happened today, and I’m going to have to face it.” I paused, trying to gather my thoughts.
Mostly, what kept crashing through my pleasant, buzzy confusion this night, was how good my detective looked. The drunker I got, the more he captured my attention, which I regarded from a corner of my mind with some amusement.
John thought. “You don’t have any pictures here, do you?” he asked.
So, yeah- stag night.
Not a surprising character trait given who I am, really. But in this form, I held the complete assumption that John would be waiting for me, exactly as I’d left him, able to pick up with me from where we’d left off, with me now achingly clear on what I needed from him. Easy. Of course, I’d presumed that just as his life had re-started when he’d met me, that without me, it would basically stop, go on hold, like a frame frozen in a movie, and that when I sauntered back in, I’d press “Play,” and I would get my handsome prince.
More minutes ticking. I checked the phone again, and threw it onto the sofa.
…And now that I’ve actually felt it and tasted I think I’d die if I have to go on without it. I felt like I was dying, and now I’m alive again.
“Ah, Hudders….”
No use beating around the bush.
At first, I’d lay back with him, my heart pounding, then gathered my courage and turned my body so I was facing him. So close…
I gave in.
I wanted to write. But I thought better of it. I was dedicated to honesty with John from now on, but it had been an overwhelming day, and I figured I’d better gauge his state of mind before this kind of admission.
A devastated look in her eyes. “But you’re not….gay,” she whispered, incredulous, shaking her head. “I know you’re not…we have sex all the time, all the time…” she added, with emphasis.
The cab ride was excruciating. John alternated between closing his eyes and giggling, seemingly replaying events from the last couple hours. He tried to talk, but he was slurring too. I watched his lips move, losing track of his words, willing the distance between us to disappear. The world was spinning, and I realized that my state of drunkenness was in no way dissipating through being in the night air, nor as my sadness materialized. I decided the only sane thing was to play it safe, joking as best I could…
I looked down in shame. “You should. So do I,” I said simply.
I realized, cold, clear, slicing through all the turmoil and the shallow breathing.
Minutes ticked by, another hour. I felt sick. My skin was clammy and I was having trouble breathing.
Sherlock knelt down in front of his dresser and began carefully taking out what he found in the lowest drawer. “Hmm,” he said, biting his lip. He could have been as casually sorting through apples at the Tesco as he was stationed naked on his floor. A self-conscious thought seemed to have never been born in his head, and he moved with careless grace through his search.
Angst! Redemption!
Sherlock:
“God, you feel good,” Sherlock panted, his mouth only inches from John’s. “I’ll never get used to this.”
“Sherlock…” he said. “I’m sorry, love, but I’m literally falling asleep as I talk.” I kissed the top of his head, stroking his hair. He called me “love.” I was in heaven.
That seemed to help. Except for the extreme fucking mountain of problems I’d caused myself and everyone I loved, things were going much better.
John paused. “So, young Sherlock, you look….a little sad to me. Are you sad?”
Molly gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. She flew toward me and embraced me. “I feel like saying congratulations!”
Sherlock thought, but his mouth stayed shut.
I could hardly believe what was happening. I gathered myself for a moment after I got out of the cab, replaying the conversation we’d just had over in my mind. Like an obsessive compulsive checking the locks, I couldn’t quite reassure myself it had actually happened. Was this more wishful thinking? Had I projected something into the moment that actually wasn’t there? In the end, I grew in certainty, and joy and relief flooded me. A reprieve. The wagon drives past the gallows. The doctor apologizes for his mis-reading of the scan. Bullet dodged.
Then…to have to be left alone in 221B, watching his back disappear as he walked down the stairs, or even following him down to the front door to say goodnight, thank you, to lean my head as close to his as I could, to inhale him as much as possible before he was swallowed up by his life without me. Too much to bear.
I continued to pace. Should I go over there? What if John was in trouble? What if Mary turned out to be the assassin, and John was tied up somewhere?
And he did.
She opened the door to me, in the dress (! damn!) and I stumbled in. “You look terrible..” she said. I knew her though. She tried to show calming, knowing smiles, but there was panic in her eyes.
I sighed. It took everything in me to not lay back down with him, clasp him to me, caress him into alertness, arousal, orgasm. Desperate for that, yes.
I breathed in his ear.
“Neve stop making those sounds…” he whispered, and pulled me closer, burying his face in my neck. He continued to kiss where his hands had just been, lowering his head to the same nipple, swirling his tongue around it, over it. It hardened and he began flicking his tongue. I was out of my mind.
“How can you do this to me?” she looked so vulnerable, like a little girl, and I was responsible for killing her dog. If only the earth really did swallow people. I deserved it. I hated myself.
They were operating on pure instinct from this wanting part of my body, my brain, my soul. Have got to get closer…. I pulled his shirt out of his trousers and let my fingertips touch his skin, at first trying to maintain some gentleness, but quickly resorting to the urgency I felt coursing through me, pressing him to me. I put one hand between us, grazed his waist, and then gently cupped his erection.
“Quiet!” I barked at them and led them to a corner of the sanctuary furthest from the others.
I wanted to scream, to stop the cab and run around in traffic, jumping up and down on cars in celebration. My heart was pounding and I felt faint.
“So… well…..so John and I….” My mouth went dry and I had no idea how to complete that sentence.
I left the church feeling free and excited and so desperately in love, anticipating seeing John soon and being swept away in days of passion and ecstasy. I settled in back home, taking off the hated “best man costume," and relaxing in my usual pajamas and dressing gown. Easiest to remove, I figured. I settled back on the couch and let my mind wander. John’s hands, his mouth, his voice…oh god yes…the delicious sound track as I pictured my body aching, arching, finding the perfect friction,
How had I not realized the precariousness of this situation? The risk…the waterfall of panic and grief that I was stepping gingerly across, stone by slippery stone, completely uncertain if I would reach the other side, or be swept to my death down the rampaging waters.
I thought.
The corner of his mouth turned up slightly, and his chest started to heave, like he was preparing to devour me. I took him in, inch by inch, and he let me, seemingly without self-consciousness. His ethereal eyes on me, I lowered my gaze, his mouth-watering torso, his long, straight cock, already half erect, tantalizing my own. Long, muscular legs, those elegant feet. He took a step toward me, and not breaking with my gaze, he began to turn, showing me, asking me to drink him in. He faced away from me, his arms extended down to his sides, his perfect, plush arse and strong back before me. I remembered the last time I’d seen this view of him, so momentarily, in Buckingham Palace no less. I’d played that scene in my mind any number of times after I’d been part of it, (and if I’m honest, it usually led to wanking) and now, here he was, languidly offering me this breathtaking view. He completed turning and drew my gaze again. I am staring, wide eyed, mouth open, sinking back on my heels. Being on my knees seems appropriate to the worship I’m feeling.
Find the mobile.
After a minute. “So the tears…” Sherlock quirked an eyebrow.
I thought.
“John…John, I...I’m sorry.” He clutched me to him again, his back tense in my arms. “Molly is right, of course. I’m always saying the wrong things, the most horrible things.”
. “God…Sherlock…god…” I moaned, writhing next to him.
Such skin. John let his eyes wander lovingly up and down his back, his arse, his legs. He imagined his own hands on that skin, gently caressing, feeling every inch of smooth and rough, soft and strong, sending shivers up Sherlock’s spine. In his mind, he put his mouth everywhere, tasting every spot and hearing what sounds the detective made as he licked a pathway up and down.
She sobbed too, then anger came into her eyes. “I hate you…” she spat out, her voice rising.
“Sherlock,” I huffed out, a bit desperate. ”Anyway we can slow this down a bit?”
I felt such longing. I gritted my teeth as a brake pedal to the urge in my body, my hands, my mouth, to reach for him, engulf him in my warmth, luxuriate in his. Stroke his soft hair, his skin.
"And I'd prefer for us to meet in happier circumstances. It's meant to be important, our first time meeting. Those are the stories that get passed down generations and all that."
"I'm still allowed tea during the interrogation, right?"
My offer for you to stay in Sussex still stands. Bring Harry too, if needs be. Speaking of whom, I don’t suppose she has said anything yet, has she? I don’t think I am ‘jumping to conclusions’ by saying it’s best if you stay out of the way of your parents as long as they continue to think those things about me. About us.
(See the end of the chapter for
"She's here of her own accord. And her name is Alissia." John's voice said.
"Not interested." Mary said firmly. "I'm sorry, sir, but no matter what you insist, I do not miss that life."
“You don’t have to say it back or anything.  I didn’t even mean to say it, it just sort of slipped out.”
"Shut up. Look, can we talk about something else? Like Sherlock again. Back to Sherlock."
John's lips twitch slightly into a smile. "I'm being stupid, aren't I, by being angry at them."
"He was nice. At first. And charming. But I didn't like him. I don't think so."
“You really need more faith in me. And you need to stop crossing things out. You did in the last letter too. Who knows what important things I’m missing out on?”
"I don't know. I doubt we'd have anything interesting to talk about."
"Spam letter, that's all. Offering me twenty thousand galleons to reply with the correct answer to some trivia question. Nothing to worry about."
“Is he any good?”
Sherlock comes in and sits on the sofa, his head buried in his hands while John busies himself with the kettle, trying to keep calm. After all, his wife and child are asleep, and it probably wouldn’t do any good to wake them up with panicked and frustrated yelling. John brings a mug of tea over to Sherlock, who accepts, then sits beside him. They drink their tea in silence for a few moments, until he is sure that Sherlock has calmed down slightly, then asks. “Are you sure? That Moriarty’s back and we’re in danger?”
“We’ve got a serial killer, Hopkins. That much is definite. They’re hard, serial killers. You have to wait for them to make a mistake.”
"And my mum and sister?"
But John was stopped by Sherlock pressing his mouth against his. It wasn't particularly romantic - in fact it was fairly obvious that Sherlock had never kissed anyone before I his entire life; John was fairly certain Sherlock was holding his breath while his (soft, chapped gorgeous) lips were trapped against his. But something about knowing that it was Sherlock who was kissing him, it was Sherlock's hand covering his, made John freeze in shock, his brain complete shut off, before it even occurred to him to kiss back.
“But it’s urgent. The truth is, I’ve been thinking about what you said at the end of our last video call session yesterday.”
Sherlock: I deserve better than this token casting
"Charity?" Sherlock spat.
“Sherlock!”
It was a fairly harmless and, Sherlock had thought, obvious statement, but John had a surprised expression and looked in silence at him for several seconds. "You want me to work with you."
As the kiss continued and increased with enthusiasm, the world shrunk until there were no more cabs to run after or serial killers to catch or hiding criminal masterminds to be forever paranoid about. As far as the last one was concerned, over time that fear had shrunk until Moriarty seemed like a bad dream, too long ago and far away to be worried over. Right here, right now, with John pressed against him and his arms wrapped tightly around his waist, they were safe and unafraid. After all these years without any sign of him or his people, what were the odds that they’d ever return?
Thanks again everyone!
“What are we doing?” John asks, very much aware of how tightly compressed they are, how Sherlock can probably feel how hard John’s heart is beating. His mouth is directly parallel to Sherlock’s neck, which is exposed under the orange glow of a nearby street light, his head leaning back against the wall.
"Will they be sitting together every day?" Sherlock looked over his shoulder at John and Mary. They were laughing with Molly over something Lestrade had said, and their arms were close together and hidden by the table, obviously holding hands. "Can't they separate for just one second?"
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s a celebration. May as well make the most of it.”
Sherlock had dismissed John’s idea with a roll of his eyes, saying how he never went to a muggle primary school. “My father tutored me at home, with reading and writing and maths. Mother helped me with magic and deductions and the more useful stuff, when she wasn’t at work.”
We kissed.
“Oh. Oh! So why did you cross it out?”
"Clearly." Janine leant in to look at the spine of the book. "Charlotte Ozymander? I didn't take you to be a magical creature-person."
"Are your feet really that exciting," Sherlock asked, "Or are you sleeping?"
“I - I love you too.”
“The person you what?”
"It's stupid the police wouldn't let you get involved. Can you imagine how much less crime there would be if you caught all the criminals?"
"Well, you don't like alcohol, and yet - y'know."
Boss, as the young woman sitting at a computer desk had called him, raked a hand through slicked back, dark hair and groaned impatiently. There were multiple cameras on the inside and outside of the building, none of which had been discovered yet. The two men living there hadn’t even noticed that people had broken into the building a mere few days after they had first moved in there together. But then again, the operation was run smoothly and efficiently by Adams.
Sherlock shakes his head, pulling a face. “I probably wouldn’t like it. Baths are for cleanliness. It seems counterproductive to initiate that sort of thing in there.”
“Fair enough. Continue with your complaints. Have you spoken much with your parents?”
“I’m being serious.” Holmes separates himself far enough for him to look Watson in the eye, intense and sincere. “I’ve been thinking about this for a while now. Stakeouts, gunfights, chasing criminals - it’s a young man’s game. We’re...not. I need reading glasses now, for God’s sake. Your leg flares up and your shoulder aches twice as much nowadays as it used to. And tonight - “ Holmes takes a steadying breath when he realises that his voice has been rising in a steady crescendo. It wouldn’t do to awaken anyone at this hour. Not when they are embraced in so compromising and unexplainable a position. “Twenty years ago we would have caught and apprehended the man much quicker. But now you’ve paid the price.” His hand falls to the bandage, barely touching it, as he adds bitterly, “and so the whirligig of time brings its revenges.”
19:48 See you soon
Mary seems slightly taken aback beneath her facade, her gun lowering as though she was expecting John to jump for joy and go,
"What can you do? You're not even of age, Sherlock," John said gently. "Maybe you should listen to the Minister and wait."
This was apparently where Sherlock drew the line. His face at first contorted into a sad frown, then as he seemed to recollect himself, he scowled, something that made ice-cold regret land heavily in the pit of John's stomach.
"If you want to be crude about it, yes."
"Little bit not good there, Sherlock. You could have just asked, instead of asking your brother."
He turns it off, jumping at the sound of the alias he gave Marco earlier that night. The man in question is now sitting up, the bedsheets rumpled around his waist. It’s a sight even Sherlock, who usually experiences little interest in these things except for ulterior motive, can appreciate. “Sorry,” he replies in Italian. “Go back to sleep. I just need some air.”
Sherlock jumps at the sound of Mycroft’s voice, and turns to glare at the god currently standing in front of his throne. “What do you want? You never visit me. I’d assumed your eating habits had left you perpetually stuck in your throne.”
Watson can’t help but chuckle silently. “Christ, he’s even reciting Shakespeare now. Sherlock, I can’t make you stop working. You love your cases.”
"Hello?"
"Mycroft, listen, this is important - "
"Good," Harry says firmly, then softer, "I hope it goes alright."
“What?”
“Christ, Sherlock Holmes, giving me emotional advice. Never thought I'd see the day."
"Stubborn seems more like it, but thank you."
Dear John,
“What was a guy handsome as you doing dancing alone?” John asked, displaying his most charming, most 'I'm harmless, come talk to me' smile. He knew it was incredibly cheesy, possibly the least original pick-up line out there, but one benefit of time travel was that the option to undo mistakes made him incredibly confident, bordering on hubris, when using pick-up lines on people. Particularly very beautiful people.
He still sees him sometimes, in a mop of curls in the queue at the underground, or in a long coat flapping in the wind, or in the memories found at the bottom of a whisky bottle. The latter is saved only for special occasions, when key dates approach that he can’t help but connect to Sherlock. He has it under control. Today just happens to be one of those days.
"Vell, ve all know vhat happened last time Hogvarts hosted." His voice was sickly and slippery and his cold hard mouth seemed stuck in a permanent smirk. "Sixteen years ago. I vas a young teacher at ze time, barely began my career. I remember reading about it, hearing people's accounts of it; You-Know-Who's return, ze death of a student - your own champion, may I add... I hope you have been spending at least half of your budget and time on security as you have on... Decorations."
"Good."
Mary wrapped her arms around his shoulders in a tight, possessive hug. "God, you're adorable." She murmured in his ear. John scoffed.
I have to say I laughed a little bit reading your message. Not at you. Not like that. It’s just that I’ve imagined since I was a kid what my first interaction with my soulmate would be like and murders, divorce rates and the scientific impossibility of the soulmate journal certainly never came up. But then again I lack imagination. It's the main reason I'm not very good at English in school, so pray for me when I do my exams this year.
"Think literally and laterally." Sherlock advised "Double meanings, puns, all can be part of a riddle. Be creative, but sometimes the answer is obvious"
He rolled over onto his side, clutching his pillow and curling up into a ball as though it could shield him from the injustices of the world, until his mother called him down for breakfast. He ate none of it, his appetite completely gone after the revelations of his phone call with John.
There was a moment of silence, where Sherlock was considering an answer - or whether to answer at all. "Well, for starters I would make sure that Yanovich didn't bring his damn children along."
John shakes his head, grinning."Of course you do."
“But... the tickets were sold out weeks ago!”
They were so close, though. But still only just, frustratingly out of reach.
"What?"
“Okay. Now take my hands and shut your eyes.”
Sherlock scowls, his bottom lip protruding into a pout but pours some more whiskey into his glass and takes a swig. “It doesn’t even count. It was for the Magnussen case.”
Sherlock shook his head. "Nothing. Nothing I can do. The events will fold out whatever I do. Whoever did this has planned this. They're clever. They know what they're doing and it will happen no matter what. I'll just have to respond appropriately."
Dear Sherlock
You really needn't worry about giving me permission - rather a waste of ink I think. In case you have somehow already forgotten, not many people like me, let alone are attracted to me. And don't do your old but 'I like you! you're a nice person on the inside!' et cetera, et cetera. It's a basic, indisputable fact. You're the exception that proves the rule apparently.
Once out of the room, the doctor pulls off his mask and hat, revealing a worn yet somehow youthful face that defies age or time. His hair is sandy, almost grey, and his eyes are the most exquisite colour Sherlock has seen in over a millenia. The underworld is grey and dark and damp. This doctor - this
“Yeah, exactly. And I really don’t want to take her to Angelo’s. It’s a nice place. I’d rather not disturb everyone with her screaming.”
“Oh.”
"Oh,it's dull. Mother gave it to me. She says as a half-blood I have a responsibility to choose between the muggle world and the wizarding world." The boy put the book down with an air of disgust, "Can't see why I can't have both. But only the good bits."
"I dunno. Something to make up for the fact that I just called you pretty and all but came out to you." He chuckles weakly. "C'mon. The first thing that comes to mind."
“Just subtle things. Like, ‘oh this actor was born in 1967? Coincidentally, that was five years before soulmate journals were legalised between same-sex couples in the UK.’ Or like, ‘you know, I hear that Maurice is a very good movie.’ I haven’t received any responses other than small ‘hmphs’, which I think is progress,” he says optimistically.
Molly bit her lip, averted her eyes towards the ground. "Greg - isn't feeling well."
19:28 Not especially. Why? SH
"Boredom. If we carry on making such dull potions."
"She doesn't speak much English." Mary explained.
I have sent a photo from a couple of years ago of me and Redbeard. There are few pictures of me where I look like I enjoy having a camera shoved in my face, but I'm sure this will do. It's not from a special occasion or anything - my mother insists on taking pictures at random times. But I think it was a good day. Just us at the park, me throwing tennis balls for him to catch, and him going in the complete opposite direction to greet a nearby labrador.
Your friend,
"Cocaine."
“You can hide it under your shirts, you know. I thought the simple chain would be better. More discreet if -“
"I'll be fi - John!" John had grabbed Sherlock's wrist and was now dragging him towards the tree. Sherlock ducked obligingly, rolling his eyes, to get inside the hollowed tree, and was relieved to find that the 'ceiling' was high enough that he could stand up straight without hitting his head. The only issue was that, though the tree was wider than average, it wasn't wide enough to allow both him and John to have some sense of personal space inside it, and Sherlock ended up with bark pressed up against his back and John standing right in front of him, his face almost pressed against Sherlock's chest. Sherlock's heart sped up rapidly from John's presence, even if they were now going out.
"Yes. He'll wake up tonight. Hopefully. Maybe. I don't - " Sherlock felt his lower lip wobble and bit down on it to prevent it from doing so further.
She hesitates, before admitting, "It did. A guide for parents of same-sex soulmates. It's very educational."
"Honestly, I don't understand why these things still exist." Madam Pomfrey tutted. "Every time, something like this happens." With a wave of her wand John's head stopped stinging and his vision cleared a little.
"Hate crime, perhaps?" Lestrade supplied. "John being an openly bisexual muggle-born and all that."
The bedroom door slams in his face, leaving John to drown in his confusion and panic and... relief.
"Yeah. Look, Mary, I'd love to talk more, catch up and all, but I think I'd prefer to do it when I'm not about to enter a possibly-deadly tournament. Why don't we meet tomorrow morning here at breakfast?"
“Aww. My point still stands though. You don’t like pubs, you just like me.”
Soon John was left alone, fuming with anger and confusion.
"'To thine own Slav be true'."
“Mmh.”
“Is that what your diagnosis would be for a patient experiencing the same symptoms as you are now?” She asked, her voice calm and patient. John hated it. “I don’t think it would be.”
"That's fair enough."
, with a capital F - that was pulling him into this room clearly lies in this man. Why? He’s nothing more than a doctor, albeit an impressive one. He watches as he cuts and prods and pokes the injured man with various instruments, not once breaking into a sweat or shaking. Instead, he has an intense, dark stare that goes unbroken for the duration of the entire surgery. How long has it been now? An hour? Two?
More Angst!
I couldn’t help my hands traveling all over his body.
“Okay….what what will you say to everyone?”
Once again, I felt like the world stopped. I was overwhelmed, overjoyed.
“You are very good at saying things like that,” Sherlock whispered, kissing John gently on his forehead, nose, jaw. “I’ll try to get better”
With any remaining brain cells I had operating, I marveled at his skill. His intuition in knowing how to approach this with me was overwhelming. If orgasms were mountain climbing, he’d deftly guided me up one the steepest slopes I’d ever known, with ease, passion, love?
“How’s it going?!” John practically screeched. “Why are you not here? How could you have left me this morning?”
It never dawned on me, in no way entered my mind, that I would lose some rare opportunity that I’d had with him. That this window which I’d barely been able to open, would suddenly, permanently close without my knowledge or say so. Never saw it coming.
“Not here, hmm” Sherlock frowned, breaking John out of his reverie.
John grabbed Sherlock’s arse and began forcefully rocking into him, his whole being demanding to reconnect with the interrupted sensation. “Jesus, don’t stop, don’t stop” John panted. “I’m fine; I’m perfect. I’ll tell you later.”
I decided to play a game with myself as I completed my ablutions in silence. If John woke up before I left, I had a chance to…what? It was too ridiculous to think about. Well, at least to express my feelings to him.
Ten minutes passed. Twenty. I somehow drifted into a sleep like state, unaware of the exhaustion that had been building up. I startled awake, hearing John bang the door open. Without looking my way, he locked the door behind him and strode purposefully toward my room.
“You do not understand..” I said sternly, the weight of my words settling on me like concrete. I was gulping breath; I felt like I was drowning. “I’m not who you think I am….I’m not who I think I am.. I’m on my way over.”
“I’m all yours…” he said, a wistful look in his eye, but starting to smile again.
Then, it hit me, though.  I realized its one thing to flail around with someone in a darkened room, your bodies and brains soaked in enough alcohol that a match should not be lit in your presence, two lost boys, crashing into each other, with no thought of past or future, giving into the false freedom of your frontal lobe being blessedly off line. That’s one thing.
I was 15 years old again?
Molly and Mrs. Hudson were giggling like school girls.
A text alert sounded. My breath stopped. I dove for it like it was a grenade I had to throw out the window, and clicked it open.
I gripped his shoulders and fell to the floor with him, both of us on our knees within millimeters of each other. The alcohol made me deliciously aroused and deliciously brave all at once. His face full of fear that I blithely ignored, I pulled him roughly toward me and collapsed into a heart stopping kiss, groaning deeply from the back of my throat. I had no idea how he would respond, what manner of punishment I was about to receive, but I ignored it all, and kissed him like the starving man that I was.
I tried to smile, and the tears began again.
My head was pounding a bit, but I otherwise seemed to have escaped a hangover. I shifted slightly to observe my beautiful doctor to my right, laying on his side, his hand resting lightly on my chest, breathing deeply, his mouth pulled into an adorable pout. He seemed entirely unconscious.
That was it. I could not see, could not hear, my whole world dissolving into falling stars within and around me, an orgasm I’d never seen the likes of before, pounding through me, splitting me in two. I think it was me I heard shouting, although his voice raised too as he stiffened and spilled over my hand, my my belly, my thighs.
I cleared my throat. I would plunge forward. “ I…I’m in a cab; I’m on my way to the church…”
I shook my head. Too smart. She’d never buy it. I slowly rose from my place near the toilet, and opened the door.
“Listen, I love you. I do. You have changed my life. “ Breathe, breathe. I held her gaze. “You saved my life. But…”
Well, that was it.
At home, the stairs overwhelmed us, at least at first. We’d only sat on the bottom stair to begin with, trying to gather our bearings, and reduce the breathless fits of giggles we’d been lapsing into. Then, seemingly exhausted, John laid back, his head resting on the third stair.
“John..” Mary sounded completely reasonable, calming, soothing. “Dear, you’re just nervous. Don’t be silly. Whatever it is..we can get it all sorted. Not to worry..” she almost giggled.
I was, it turns out, best able to pretend with myself, up until the point when I could no longer. Since I’d seen John take out that ring at the restaurant, since this woman Mary had become a reality in my mind, I’d been pretending: pretending that the main thing I cared about was the mustache, pretending to like Mary, pretending to plan the wedding, pretending to be delighted planning the wedding, pretending that this reality would all fade away, and that John was still mine, and could become even more mine with just a bit of courage on my part.
I was desperate to see it. “You’re so gorgeous,” I whispered. “Come for me and I’ll come with you.” His face almost looked pained as the orgasm began, his head thrown back. It felt like a volcano rumbling in my arms, his body finding the exact friction it needed. No thoughts, no words, just nature putting her hand on his hips, guiding him. Holding on to this force, knowing I’d created it, was overwhelming and the delicious pressure that signaled to my impending climax flared. “Oh god, Oh god.. John….” he cried out, and I was over the top seconds later.
The best thing I’d ever read.
“Really,” John said out loud “just come over here,” John said, hoping he sounded less pleading than he felt on the inside.
He reached between us, his large artist’s hand finding both our cocks, stroking, caressing, my cock against his, both of us in his hand. “God….God…” was all I could get out. I was drowning in arousal.
She texted me, and I stumbled back to the house.
“Great, “John said dreamily. “But come here and let me show you something first.”
“Mary…” I started again.
Oh my god! I bolted up from the sofa. Why had I assumed we were free and clear?
John: 9:45 a.m.
“This is you…” John said in awe. “Wow…look at you!” He stared deeply into the eyes of the young child staring back at him.
You did not have to ask me twice. I rose without hesitation and, not able to wait any longer, disrobed as I walked. The dressing gown fell back off of me, pooling on the floor. I undid the tie on the pajama trousers and they slipped down as I moved forward. I opened the door of the room and stepped out of them, fully naked before my lover.
John practically whispered. “Hello, young man,” he said with great affection, his eyes riveted to the photo, stroking his finger over the cherubic face. “And how old might you be?”
I moved my hands lightly up and down his back, to his sides and then skimmed one hand between our bodies to his waist. “John, John, God,…” he ground out, practically shouting, pulling my hips to his and started to grind against me. Clearly, a sensitive spot, I thought, reveling in his cries of pleasure. His moans were addictive to me, and I couldn’t wait to hear more. All night. All week. God, it was so perfect.
I felt certain of my understanding of our current predicament.
“Oh Sherlock…” I moaned, and pushed up against him, feeling the delicious pull that would not relent.
“Sherlock, what the bloody hell…..?”
But instead, like most men, I channeled my passions into anger, and a brawl with another inebriated soul over my expertise in ash seemed to be as good a place as any to channel. But there he was—my angel intervened, and we made our way home.
“Look, there’s a problem. I’ve caused a huge problem, and I..I can’t…I can’t let you marry me today..”
And there we were, somehow, in our chairs, blessedly able to continue our dance, care of two fingers of scotch. John had somehow created this ridiculous game, involving figuring out who we were by staring at each other and asking questions, and though getting drunker by the minute, the irony was not lost on me.
In a way I will never be able to recount, we were both somehow on the floor, laid out next to our chairs, him on top of me. My head was swimming. “You feel so good…” I moaned as he returned his lips to my neck, his mouth soft and wet, groaning my name. Feeling him stretched against me like that, vulnerable, virile, wanting, made me so aroused, and I felt my hips buck up involuntarily as he began to thrust against me. I swiped one hand down his arse, gently stroking the cleft as well as I could through his trousers.
“I’m going to Mary’s,” John said, his voice sounding tearful as well. “I’ll keep you posted.”
time I’d had him like this.
“Jesus, John,” he gasped, a slight smile, “lay down with me before I faint….”
Lestrade, again: “What the bloody hell is going on?” he spat out, losing patience.
“A pirate!” John repeated. “Well you look every bit the pirate, Master Sherlock,” he said, his eyes fixed on the photo.
“Why sad?” John asked softly, holding the picture closer still to his face, studying every detail.
“Yeah,” he said softly. And that was about the last thing I remembered before deep sleep claimed me.
Hmmm. I was a bit puzzled. John did not look ready to make the passionate love I’d been hoping for. Indeed, he looked like he was almost already asleep, his face planted roughly into the pillow, his coat still on, his arse slightly up in the air, like a toddler who’d barely made it to the crib. I paused, uncertain. He saw me out of the corner of this eye, and he shot up.
Sherlock let himself drop heavily, as they both lost use of their muscles, sinking into each other and the bed.
Sherlock: best man, devoted friend, nodding, smiling, playing violin, blessing their marriage, left on his own.
“Fuck…” Sherlock’s brow seemed to furrow, beginning to become undone by the sensation. “John- me too,” Sherlock gasped, his face started slacken in the beautiful way that it did, making John’s heart pound.
He got impatient and began working the button and zip on the trousers, still kissing me the entire time. He reached his hand between both layers of trousers and pants, and pushed them down over my arse, then reached to the front and gently wound them away from my cock. They fell to the floor and I finally stepped out of them.
Like everything with Sherlock, sex was intense. There was no forgetting where you were, no spacing off wondering where you’d left your umbrella, no doubting if your partner was paying attention to you. John reminded himself that this could be a bit of a honeymoon period, where the electricity between them could have lit a city block, where they felt magnetically pulled toward the other if they were within five meters of each other, where it was hard to think when the other was in the room. Sherlock applied the same platinum level of concentration to making love to John that he would to a corpse, a wall full of clues, the tells of his suspect. John felt entranced, his mind focused, his cock responsive and throbbing, and every cell in his body open, listening, feeling for Sherlock.
“Ugh.” He rolls his eyes, even as he chews at his food. “Fine. If you insist, Captain.”
They cross back over the road and separate themselves. Adrenaline pumps through John's veins as his stomach flutters both nervously and excitedly. His breath hitches in his throat fearfully at the thought of being caught, but at the same time he can't remember ever doing anything so exciting. He leans back against the wall and watches Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. Delicately, smoothly, Sherlock's long fingers reach into the pocket of a nearby woman's coat, then places it into the pocket of a passerby. Sherlock nods at John, who yells out, "Stop! Thief!"
“Yes, a born storyteller, our Johnny.”
"Fine. But I swear to god, if I go to prison for this - "
“Really? Because sending a text that says ‘SKYPE CALL NOW URGENT’ in block capitals kind of sends the wrong impression.”
“I’d like to see it on you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, of course, it won’t. It’s just, you know, your parents, whose approval I have to win and make last for as long as we will continue to be associated with one another. No pressure, of course.” Sherlock’s deadpan voice doesn’t quite hide the anxiety, the nervous way he bites his lower lip and drums his fingers on the counter.
Sherlock shrugs. "It's fine." Then his eyes widen, and a grin forms on his face. "Although...I think I have an idea on how to watch it. For free."
But there’s been a couple of uplifting things to mention. Exams have been going well. It’s nice to know that everyone else did so much worse than me in most exams, and I’m probably not as ashamed as I should be when I say how smug I feel overhearing people’s conversations afterwards about the questions and thinking to myself 'wrong!'
"We both know that whoever has sent this is the person who did this to John, then?"
"Woodwind player in the orchestra. Would be able to hide the darts within the case or the instrument. At the right angle and with a particularly strong blow, a hidden dart would come out and hit Yanovich and his family, piercing the skin with poison. Yes. that's it." Sherlock burst out of his room, determinedly walking past John towards the door. "I have to get back to the theatre. There will be an interval soon, and If I get back before then we can - "
"I don't know, those greasy, oily hands currently handling my coffee are kind of doing it for me - ow! I was kidding!"
"Yeah, yeah, fine. I just think that maybe I should have taken you up on your offer to run away to Portugal."
He scrubs at the surface of the counter quickly, glancing at the clock which taunts him with each second that passes,
He sees a sign for St Bartholemew’s Hospital and Mortuary and thinks, ah. Perfect.
“Several episodes in a row does not count as ‘once’.”
He continued regardless, teasing in a wistful, romantic voice, "Maybe you'll brush hands as you both reach for the same cheeseboard...lock eyes over the table at a formal meal in your gowns... both correct a professor at the same time by reciting pi to the twentieth digit. And that's when you know - he's the one."
"Definitely compared to last time Hogwarts hosted. Harry Potter was one of the Hogwarts' champions."
“Good. Great. Do you want to have another go at holding her?”
"And how would you measure mine?"
"So, what did you do over the summer?" He asked.
“Perfect. No smiting and no drowning. A whole 0.8 percent taken off the long list of the dead,” Sherlock snaps. “All this just to get me to
"Exactly. So why would some mechanic with no sense of personal hygiene even have a chance against you?"
"He just...left. He seemed confused. A bit angry. Shocked, mainly. I don't know." Sherlock sat on the bed, holding his head in his hands. He felt the bed creak as Molly sat beside him.
"..."
“You, mostly.” Bugger. That’s meant to be a secret. “Wait, no, not you. Something else... Plants?”
“I’ll be fine, okay?” John kissed Sherlock’s forehead gently. “I’ve been studying hard, and I know what I’m doing. Sort of.”
"So if you're so worried about Mary, why didn't you just text me? It's a lot quieter than calling."
"For god's sake. It's a logic issue. I'm taller, and therefore it will be easier if my hands were
"So, you two..."
"But seeing as the age limit has been lowered to anyone in sixth year, instead under the age of seventeen, I will assume for the moment that it will be a less dangerous creature. A kappa, maybe."
"It's not like Lila will need it. It's fine, I put it back afterwards. And the other victims' phones, after I took them from the evidence room in Scotland Yard."
"Mycroft, you don't understand! I met him!"
"Can you see me?" Molly asked, "yes? Then I didn't blind you." With a flick of her wand, both John's and Sherlock's suitcases opened and their school robes dropped in front of them. Sherlock observed that her summoning charm was improving. "Go and get changed. We get there in 15 minutes." And she was gone in a blur of black and yellow robes, her brunette ponytail swishing behind her.
