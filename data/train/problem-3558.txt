Dean tells him he’ll stay.
Later, Sam pulls Castiel aside to ask him if he’s okay with Sam leaving. Castiel insists that he’s fine, and that he need not worry about Castiel’s feelings, but Sam just gives him a look. He reminds Castiel that he’s family, too, and that he matters just as much as Dean. Castiel nods, and he’s conflicted again by the individuality of humanity and the necessity for family. His ‘family’ is disjointed at best; he has Claire, who has come around to being something close to a daughter again, and he had Jack, who he still feels wherever he goes, but corporeal form does a lot for the human senses. He has Sam, and of course he has Dean, but when he feels more than helpless on a few hunts, he can’t help but feel like he doesn’t contribute. Sure, he has the knowledge to aid with research, but when push comes to shove, he’s often better off staying back in the car. His body doesn’t move like it used to, and while Sam offered to do some workouts with him, he knew that time was not on his side. With the slowing frequency of their hunts, they were all losing their mojo.
“I said I’ll be
The thought of having to sit and talk shop with Cas three feet away, basically naked, had been more than Dean was willing to handle. He didn’t understand then, didn’t want to
“It’s been a hell of a year,” Dean admits.  He taps his index finger against Cas’ knuckles a few times, still feeling a little too wired with the contact and not yet ready to shut down.  “Cas, you still awake?”
on the other hand—”
“No,” Cas rumbled out the word against him.
“I thought it was forever.”
And it stops.
But as the footsteps neared, Dean could tell by the sound of his soles that it was Cas come to check in on him.  He paused on the other side of the cabinets.  Course he already knew Dean was in there, probably heard his heart beating from the hallway and honed in, sensed Dean’s presence and was guided there—but he was waiting for permission. Knew it had been a hell of a day—shit, not but 24 hours ago Dean was a man-bomb chockablock of souls, ready to die—and he didn’t want to intrude on whatever feeling Dean had landed on about any of it.
Cas reels backward a little when he opens the bathroom door and finds himself nose to nose with Dean.  “Hey,” Dean says with his most flirtatious smile, elbow propped against the doorway. “Come here often?”
Dean is more cynical and just thinks everyone has retreated to their corners and nobody wants to be the first one to start shit again.  Not after All That.
“What?  No, we’ll kick it in here.”
It’s a lot to take in.
“It’s
Dean is left hyperventilating on the floor, slicked down in a cold sweat head to toe.  Half afraid his eyes have been burned away, Dean looks up. The first thing he sees as his vision clears, are the bunker’s support beams above his head.  Papers are slowly drifting down all around Dean, which doesn’t make sense.  He tries to say
“We can share.”
specifically?  He’s a fucking one man apocalypse.  Then, who would want that in general?  There’s the intimacy of it, the lack of privacy. The never being alone.
that—always says the wrong thing when he should shut up and listen, and says nothing at all when it might make a difference.
Dean stresses.
“Probably would have been an asshole about it if you did.”
At some point in the process they’d been given Percocet for pain and for awhile both of them had turned into a couple of dumb, giggly teens.  One of them laughing would start a chain reaction that would end in both of them gasping, tears in their eyes, and the doc telling them to hold still for their stitches. Without the burden of all his inhibitions, it didn’t feel like such an impossible thing to touch Cas with other people in the room.  Dean was just playing it up at first, the whole sham, putting his arm around Cas’ shoulders, ruffling his fingers through Cas’ hair, letting lose a
Small, reckless touches. Gentle smiles and lingering gazes that left Dean confused and unsatisfied.
Silence.
and is wrenched from life.
“I know that,” Sam says gently, “Eileen, Jody, Claire, Jack, everyone—we all know.  We were all there, we saw what losing him did to you.  We know.  But Cas wasn’t here, he doesn’t know.  I think he’s just afraid of getting hurt, Dean.”
“Oh shit, who's dead,
.  It’s
Cas’ eyes go big and luminous, but then his mouth thins and he takes a step backward. “You don’t have to say that because you think it is what I want to hear.”
The car ride home is even worse.  Dean drives as usual, but instead of Cas riding shotgun like he did the way over, he gets in the back before anyone else.  Sam tries to make small talk, but Dean has cycled into the part of the self-loathing where he gets snappy so eventually the car lapses into silence while Sam and Eileen exchange meaningful looks in the rear-view mirror.  Cas just sits in the back brooding his ass off, and Dean replays the morning over and over in his head looking for mistakes.
Dean’s stubbornness is not something to take lightly. After all, it defeated God.
“It was…challenging, but I managed to get Cas out as part of my mission to, uh, fix things upstairs.” Jack fiddles with Dean’s bedsheets, looking more like a child than a deity.
“What are we talking about in here?” Castiel asks, yawning big as he finishes his sentence.
Jack smiles softly, and Dean feels his shoulders tense.
Dean, on the other hand, isn’t doing so well. It’s a troubling silence that falls over the bunker after Jack leaves. Miracle, the dog Dean rescued, is at his side most hours of the day, and Dean is in and out of his room to feed Miracle for the most part. Sometimes he’ll cook something and leave it out for Sam, but most days he’s cooped up in his room. Once, Sam thinks he sees Dean go into Castiel’s room, but he doesn’t mention it.
Eventually, he says, he would leave the bunker. He asks Castiel why, and it’s such a multi-pronged three letter word that it makes Castiel’s head spin. Why, indeed. Castiel shrugs, shoving aside his thoughts in favour of an empty ‘just curious’, and Dean clears his throat before volleying the same question back to Castiel. Castiel blanks, having never yet sincerely thought about leaving the bunker, or leaving
Sam takes him out to the farmer’s market, and Dean always insists on tagging along if Castiel is going. Castiel knows Dean doesn’t like these kinds of things, the earnest and overbearing goodness on display all around him, but he’s happy that Dean’s there with him. Dean pays for the two buckets of honey that Castiel had been eyeing – one buckwheat, the other wildflower – and carries them despite Castiel insisting that his arms work just fine. Dean asks what he plans to do with the honey, and he just shrugs. He has no plans, but he knows it’s something he likes, and so he wants it. That’s also a new human sensation, to give in to a want as trivial as honey, but it’s satisfying.
The cart wobbles along behind him, one of its wheels busted after years of neglect, and Castiel weaves his way towards the clothing section. It’s overwhelming at first, the excessive variety available to him. He realizes he’s become far too accustomed to the fashions at the bunker, which were really nothing more than palette swaps of the same configurations of clothing. Even the women in their lives, he realizes, all dressed quite similarly. Except Rowena, of course, but witch fashion is a whole other thing.
“Like you said, I’ll do my best. Which isn’t much, but it’s something.”
“It’s incredible how powerful just seeing someone’s face can be, isn’t it?”
“He, much like you, didn’t say it, but you two don’t do a very good job of hiding what you want.”
“Dean Winchester, you are the man who was ready to sacrifice his life ten times over for the freedom of others. You always chose free will. Freedom isn’t really a gift to you when you fought so hard against fate that it literally broke.” Jack sees Dean take a breath and he holds his hand up. Dean relents.
. It’s ridiculous for his protective parental instinct kicking in over a fictional character, but he pays it no mind. “Why Archie? Isn’t he kind of boring?”
Jack laughs at that.
It’s such a strange thing to be human. He thinks the reciprocation would be accompanied by some cosmic revelation, some great happening of light and emotion, but instead he just feels warm. He feels warm when Dean pulls him into a hug, when their lips meet in the middle, when he feels his hands wrap around the back of his head.
“When I promised that I wouldn’t interfere anymore, I meant it,” he starts, speaking in the same manner he used to, thoughtfully chewing on each word. Dean swallows, hard.
It's only about a half-hour into his drive when he receives a phone call from Dean. Deciding to be safe, he pulls over onto the shoulder of the highway and picks up. Dean’s voice is strained but not angry, and he asks vehemently where Castiel is. When Castiel asks him if he saw the note on the kitchen table, he hears Dean’s footsteps through the phone, and his eventual sigh upon reading the note. He reprimands Castiel to leave the note in a more ‘obvious place’, before asking when he would be back. Castiel has no idea, but he gives a rough time approximation that he hopes puts Dean at ease. As he pulls back onto the highway, he wonders if this, too, is a part of independence.
He raises his hand in that same sedentary wave he had adopted years ago.
Castiel takes a deep breath. “I missed you, of course, and I never stopped thinking about you. But right when I thought I had my life somewhat on track, like I could…I could
“It’s what Cas wanted, too,” Jack says, and Dean feels his jaw go slack.
Dean crooks an eyebrow at him. “You guys have, like, the same face dude. Can’t be that hard,” he jokes, and Castiel scowls at him.
They stay there for a bit longer before Kaia finds them, saying Jody’s looking for them, and they crawl back into the house to be greeted by a table full of dessert. He sees Dean’s eyes lit up with delight at the pie in front of him, and Castiel drinks it in. He wants to memorize each curve, each highlight, each freckle that spell out the joy emanating from Dean. He wants to recreate it, over and over.
Some days, Dean thinks Castiel didn’t give him a chance to say anything back. Other days, Dean thinks he didn’t deserve to say anything anyways.
“Now, I think it’s time for late lunch. I’m hungry.”
“Well, who else would it be? You know Sammy can’t draw for shit,” Dean laughs, and Castiel has to agree. He’s seen Sam try and draw during their research meetings, and it’s…abstract at best.
In that moment, right before he pushed Dean aside, he truly was happy. It was overwhelming, terrifying, even, but he was
Dean scowls. “What’s that supposed to mean?” Jack giggles.
Jack smiles wide. “Just like in Riverdale?”
It’s a normal morning like any other when Dean wakes up to see Jack sitting at the edge of his bed, mindlessly scratching Miracle behind the ear. Jack looks up, his serious face breaking into a smile.
“That’s a lie, but I think I understand. It’s about what Jack said, isn’t it?”
Jack clears his throat. “I guess I like Archie. I…” he trails off, his eyes avoiding Dean’s. He picks at his fingernails – a bad habit he picked up from Dean – before looking back up at Dean. “I guess I want to be his friend.”
“Nothing. But I think you know.”
“Yeah?” Dean replies, somewhat relieved Jack hadn’t said
If Jack never said anything to him, he might be better off. Maybe one day he could take on finding Castiel on his own terms – he’s sure there’s some spell he could find to get Castiel back, after all. Maybe then he could go on and live his life like Sam is. He hears Sam call Jody a few times, and Dean thinks about Claire. He wonders if Claire knows what happened to Castiel, and he wonders if Sam told her.
Dean stands outside Castiel’s door for what feels like hours, and he swears he can hear Castiel breathing in his sleep. Still, he’s not convinced that he’ll be there when he opens the door. Sam is in the kitchen, and he gave Dean a knowing look before telling him to go to Castiel. He takes a deep breath, counting his fingers and toes and pinching himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, and he opens the door slowly.
Even though they’ve been in countless motels across the country, Castiel never slept much in any of them. The covers are scratchy, the mattress uneven, and the temperature wavers menacingly between balmy and frigid. In all accounts, it should be miserable, and to some degree it is, but he can’t help but wonder as he falls asleep if this is how Sam and Dean felt all those nights he watched over them, and just as he’s nodding off, he thinks about how much he missed when he thought he was paying attention.
“It felt like being on fire and doused with ice water all at one. I was happy, but I was scared of that happiness. That the stability I thought I had could be dismantled so easily like that.”
Jack immediately perks up at that, turning to Dean expectantly. “Ooh, what’s for lunch, Dean?” Dean groans as he pulls himself up, moving behind Castiel and wrapping his arms around his middle, his chin perched on Castiel’s shoulder.
“Indeed, he would. Selfless, caring, and protective.” Castiel’s words seem pointed at Dean, especially after Castiel’s hand finds Dean’s, squeezing it softly. “He always puts himself before others and believes in doing the right thing no matter what. Reminds me of someone we know.”
He wanders in and out of various stores, picking up things that catch his eye: a polaroid camera that seems far too expensive for its antiquated technology, a sturdy looking sketchbook with a few pencils, a few CD’s from a music store, not really paying attention to who the artists are, but he figures he can’t really go wrong, and simple white baseball cap with the words ‘gone fishing’ emblazoned on the front in small green embroidery. It’s a modest haul, all things considered, but he can’t help but run his fingers over each item as he sits in his truck, fingers lingering over the grooves on the side of each jewel case, the sturdy brim of his hat, and the metal spiral binding the sketchbook together.
Dean smiles back, the corners of his eyes wrinkling in the way that Castiel loves.
And so, they stay like that a while longer, hand in hand. Their bodies are real in every way, and for a moment, for this moment, Castiel becomes a little less afraid of how real he is.
It was a quiet few days after everything came back. The world whirred outside the bunker, but Sam and Dean spent most of their time inside. It was exhausting, debilitating, even, to have been bestowed freedom in this way. Sam works slowly, reorganizing the bunker, making calls to those who are still around, and just wandering outside, observing the new old world. Sam is intimidated by the sheer breadth of possibility, but there’s a growing spark in him that is excited to carve out a new path.
Jack hums thoughtfully. “I knew you would say that” he says, his tone light and playful. Dean gives him a glare, but Jack is unaffected.
“In a way,” he sighs, his voice steady, “I think Jack meant that we didn’t have to worry about anything, Dean. To live our lives the way we want to.” Sam pauses, and when Dean continues to be silent, he continues.
“I will admit we have striking facial similarities, but he’s…different. Brighter. Happier.” Castiel sighs, and Dean gives him a strange look.
Dean spends his sober hours wondering what the hell Jack plans to do. He’s almost certain that Jack means to bring Castiel back, but he doesn’t know in what capacity. Would Castiel still be an angel? Would he be human? Worst case scenario, would he just bring back
“You know I don’t like surprises.”
Halfway through the pizza, something breaks inside Castiel and he feels himself asking a question before he can stop himself. He asks Dean if he plans to move out of the bunker too. Dean is silent, chewing slowly, and avoiding eye contact with Castiel. He feels a frost spread inside him.
He tells Dean that he loves him. That he still loves him.
Before his humanity, he always found it odd how many photos Dean seemed to keep. He could understand the sentimental value of the photo of Mary that he kept close, but he was always less clear about the more seemingly meaningless snapshots, such as when he would occasionally snap a photo of Castiel on a hunt, or a picture of him and Sam hunched over old tomes in the bunker. Turning over the polaroid in his hand, he thinks he’s starting to understand the human fascination with photos.
“It’s silly, Dean,” he mutters, fiddling with his pencil between his fingers, “he’s here with us, and I feel him, I do. But…”
While humanity is complex, it’s also fettered with routine and simpleness. The days are repetitive – they switch between researching and relaxing, and sometimes their days are punctuated by visitors like Eileen, but otherwise they’re much the same. Some days Sam talks about his plans for the future, but Dean never participates. Castiel, understandably, has no idea what his plans are, and so they don’t press, but he can tell Sam is nudging at Dean.
"It's unbecoming of a Prince to roll in the dirt. That goes for the both of us."
"I already broke down in front of you and Dean earlier this evening. I should be fine."
"Oh? I've heard of him, nearly every Alpha wants him. I've seen him to, very pretty... But not very obedient. Humans are disrespectful little creatures, not to mention he was raised as if he was an Alpha... He won't be a very obedient Omega." Lucifer scowled crossing his arms over his armored chest.
"I do not need a babysitter."
"We'll lay low enough. But-" Lucifer paused and stood, turning to look at his younger brother Gabriel who looked as if he had something rather important to say for once. Lucifer gave him a hand wave to continue to speak.
Dean frowned slightly unsure what his Father was getting out. His heat was due in two weeks. He didn't think he would be traveling anywhere for quite some time.
Dean's face whipped up to loom at Lucifer with fear filling his face and scent
Sam's face snapped into another one of his bitch faces
Castiel took a deep breath before he began to speak
Michael closed his eyes and shook his head
"Michael I-"
"No." The angel gasped out, blood trickling from his lips
"It's a good thing we're getting married soon though, I'll-I'll be showing soon and I-" Dean rambled his free hand resting nervously on his stomach, face turned towards the sea with a frown
"Where would this place be on the map? Will you fly there and carry Claire? Would you take a boat? How exactly are you planning on getting there?" Sam rambled his questions, eyes scanning the maps to keep from letting Gabriel see his embarrassment
Michael and Sam sent Castiel each a shrug, while Dean made a motion with his arms for Cas to hug the man back.
Dean smiled with a tired nod, kissing Castiel's knuckles before the two parted ways. Dean closed his door, flipping his light on as he shuffled to his bed, flopping face first on it with a groan. He seemed to freeze, sat up and gently took the wedding photo in his hands confusion plastered over his face as he tried to decipher how it was broken.
"Help me sit up."
"I needed to talk to you."
Dean felt a tug as his heart and it made him want to sob in sorrow, but sing in joy at the same time. A red warm light caught the corner of his eyes, looking to Castiel beside him he was mesmerized by a thing glowing bright red, string of sorts from Castiel's chest, connecting to his own.
"And who told you that, hmmm?" Crowley spat out between his teeth, his eye glowing red with hatred as he sat himself down at the head of the table. "That wretched whore Abaddon, I presume?" Crowley's voice was smug, eyebrow raised as he lifted a cup pretending to admire the gold "Stole my throne more like."
"Red Strings of Fate are fairytales Gabriel." Chuck spoke more seriously, a dark look coming into his eyes, seemingly looking past Gabriel to the little wedding painting of him and Cassiel that rested on his nightstand "There's no such thing and I forbid you of talking of such. I don't want you believing the lies of a witch. If I discover you looking for her, or anyone else of her kind there will be serious consequences." Chuck's tone was final as he growled it all out, his eyes fixing on Gabriel, who shifted uncomfortably under his father's stern gaze. The blonde's nose twitched at the authority and anger in his father's scent. Why was Chuck angry? Gabriel had only brought up a subject...
"Michael has won the duel! We will hold the funeral for our fallen Prince in two days time! The Kingdom is expected to pay their respects!" Chuck then waved his hand in dismissal before exited the stand he and his children had been sitting in.
Dean frowned and shook his head quickly
"He was our baby brother. Respect him."
Castiel blinked a few more times, his mind not wanting it to fully register. A frown fell on his face as he looked at Dean
The Crowned Prince sat back down heavy in his chair "I was young when the Witch came before, and Father forbade us from interacting with her since she was a Witch. But he was so happy after meeting Cassiel... If Gabriel succeeds do you really think it will change anything? What if- what if I'm not True Mates with who I want? And what if Dean and Castiel are not actually True Mates? Than the Wedding will still have to take place and I can never make your brother truly happy." Michael muttered with a sigh
"No. He was glad to see me I suppose. But you know how our relationship is." Lucifer growled a little before one look from Kellie deflated the growl in his throat and he actually choked a little bit.
"Oh, Gabriel. Good morning son." Chuck smiled, he looked so worn without his crown, older, gray in his beard, hair a mess from sleep
Lucifer growled, his eyes narrowing at Michael
"Socks man. You gotta wear socks with boots." Dean helped his son put socks on, looking at his watch he realized just how late he was going to be to taking Emma to her mom's.
_______________________________________________________________________
Castiel nodded his attention back on his nephew "Thank you Mr Winchester."
Dean shook his head, clamping his mouth shut as he began to shut everything out. He couldn't breath, couldn't think, couldn't speak properly. It made him angry. It made the anger of everything that was going on finally bubble over and he let out a pained cry before shoving the vanity to the ground. The large piece of wood crashed to the marble floor, the mirror shattered and scattered everywhere, drawers opened and cracked.
His six wings tucked close as he roared the horse to turn and address his troops.
"Meaning I will be married upon his return."
Raphael was dead.
"You sound as if you are convincing yourself." Lucifer said rather dryly "On a different note I have met your Omega yesterday. He seems... Rude to say the least." The angel chuckled with a shake of his head
"I shall wear it always." Dean smiled
Dean closed his eyes. A few slow tears slipped silently down his freckled cheeks. He felt safe in his father's arms, safe as he was surrounded by his father's scent.
"You can't escape this Dean! We were meant to be can't you see that?" Castiel looked down at his hands, blinking the tears away
"What kind of affairs?" Chuck sat on the edge of a chair as he looked up at his son. Gabriel had always been a mystery, raising him had been nearly a full time job. He tended to terrorize any nannies and teachers they brought in for him. But after Chuck's dear Cassiel passed, Gabriel had matured and helped take such good care of Castiel and little Samandriel, until the youngest had gone missing... Chuck shook his head dismissing that rabbit trail of thoughts "Why would you want to consort with a /witch/ of all people?"
Castiel frowned and shook his head, handing his horse over to a servant and nodding
"My name dear boy. Is Alistair."
Everyone though was patient with the Alpha, except Raphael.
Lucifer leaned over the railing trying to make out which shadowy figure in the dist cloud was Michael.
"Come on Dean." Cas stood and headed for the bedroom door, tearing his shirt off as he did.
"We had meals that could have been done at." Crowley purred not turning from the window
"It's not nasty. And it's only cracked because I forget it's in my pocket when I'm crawling around under cars." Dean pouted as he held his coffee mug, plastic spoon in hand as he took a bite
Had Raphael really been conspiring with Abaddon? Michael was sure the demon hadn't a clue what he was speaking of... But then again, Crowley wasn't one to necessarily/ lie/ but simply to emit certain aspects of the truth...
"Come on." He growled before roughly grabbing Dean's arm and yanking him down the hallway
"I was bowing to the both of you. Prince Adam wasn't it?" Castiel's wings shuffled as they settled a little to tense behind his back
None of the Prince's looked that happy when Sam had met them.
Drowned out by the emptiness of sorrow and pain. Michael barely registered when he was told it was time to head back, didn't even notice how he stared, unblinking as his brother was buried, shook his head and uttered a single
"Dean Winchester I have dealt with your shit for so damn long I think I know what my Righteous Man sounds like!"
It had been tragic.
"How could he?!" Castiel growled his wings raising in irritation "Against his own brother and family!" The young Prince pulled his thing silver crown in one hand and ran his free hand through his hair "Michael, he's-He's our brother" Castiel's voice fell to a whisper and his wings drooped "Raphael does know what challenging you entails correct? A fight to the death, and if he wins not only has he killed his brother, shamed his family, but then Dean would have to be owed to him!"
Michael raised an eyebrow and gently took the letter, taking a small knife from his belt, his wings stiffened unsure of whether this was good news, or if it was quite the contrary.
Sam nodded and pulled out of Gabriel's comforting embrace. Embarrassment reddened his cheeks
(See the end of the chapter for
"Did I not show you, that if you are to insist on having longer hair, different things you could do with it?" Dean complained as he combed his fingers through his brother's collar length hair
Here we go with one of the big plot points
"I'm only a kid. You don't gotta bow. Unless your Boeing to Dean?"
Castiel suppressed a growl as he neared the demon that was going on about how he was innocent and had never even seen the Omega Prince.
Sam stayed by John and Dean. Watching Heavens royal family, the silent tears slipping down their cheeks as they forced themselves to shake hands and take on thousands of muttered apologies.
The Alpha knew what his problem was. He had given the Crowned Prince his heart many years prior, he was to attached to his charge. That in itself was a dangerous thing. He needed to distance himself.
Dean released Ben's hand, readjusting the backpack of Ben's overnight things on his shoulder.
Lucifer dove down towards a little cottage near the stables, landing outside he knocked urgently and firmly on the door.
"You'll settle eventually, brother. Some 'kitten'" Cas teased, using Balthazar's words, "will eventually get the better of you." he grinned his crooked grin, running his thumb over the incredibly detailed surface of his crystal glass.
He was expected to give heirs to his future husband, he was moving away from his home.
Bobby slapped Dean in the back of the head again making the Winchester rub the back of his neck.
Gabriel smiled the type of smile that the men in the Novak family didn't smile often, their Dad had that smile when he spoke of Castiel's mother, Lucifer smiled like that when he talked about Kelly, it was a certain kind of smile
"Dean is sad, Sam is sad, Mom and Dad are hiding it but they're a little sad." Adam's voice cracked "And I Don't know why they're sad! They just tell me it's fine, that they're fine and they aren't! Dean is all beat up and hurt! No one tells me why they're sad because I'm just a dumb kid that won't understand! Someone hurt my big brother." Adam's face was twisted in distress and his usually neutral scent that children had was braided with confusion and sadness
"And what, needs to be rediscussed?" The demon King crowed, lips quirking into a snake like grin. Hands folding under his chin with a slight tilt of his head, pointed black horns glinting in the low warm light of the chandelier.
"Yeah, Earth isn't so chilly, but I've heard Spring and Summer here are beautiful. The ocean view is nice as well."
"There you are Dean! Prince Sam." She bowed to both of them before continuing
"I don't know. Gabriel and I were speaking privately and we turned around to see him take off down the hall."
"And you will be dead now shut the bloodh hell up!" The Demon Alpha hissed eyes flashing red as the demon backed down
"Dean," Michael started, the Archangel stood and quickly took a step back when Dean flinched. Michael's wings folded as close to his body as he could to try and look less intimidating "Dean look at me." Michael kept his voice calm and quiet, but firm enough that Dean knew he was serious
"A myth you say? Like the little rumors about you dear boy? The rumors uttered to me about the strange Archangel with the golden wings, the prince that isn't what he seems?"
Lucifer never believed in such a fairytale.
Castiel sighed deeply as his oldest brother tried to calm him down with his usual optimistic talk.
"Castiel!" Michael shouted grabbing his brother's arm and forcing him to turn away from the startled demon "What is wrong withyou!? We came to speak with her! Not threaten her!"
He supposed maybe it wouldn't be to bad to be married to Michael...
Dean stumbled a little, on shakey legs, he was swiftly caught by Castiel, the Angel's hand rest heavy on his lower back, concern danced in those blue eyes, one of his wings stretched out behind Dean, a few feathers flitted to the ground, Dean was immediately worried about that and the gash across Castiel's cheek and part of his neck. The Prince did not have time to worry as his vision swam, nausea taking over, he gdabbed Castiel's free hand to steady himself, bloody nladee clattering to his feet.
"Charlie?" Michael asked upon entering the kitchen. The Red headed human was busy as work flirting with one of the other maids when he came in
"Charlie, run a bath and get him cleaned up. I'll be up when he's rested."
He had always been told one day he would be King of Earth, that he would be given a beautiful wife and he would rule from his father's throne...
"Yeah I know. But everything is going really well and he knows if he messes up once, Jack and the house are mine and he will be on the street. Kelly even agreed she won't let him by her place." Michael laughed faintly as he glanced over to Castiel's car
"I do believe I beat you Alpha."
"No. I'm a Prince actually." Gabriel rolled his eyes, placing the tray on the glass table by the crackling fire
Loving Michael hurt so damn much.
The words struck Gabriel deeply. His brother was definitely in love with the elder Winchester Prince.
"No." Dean spoke truthfully now calmer knowing the intruder wasn't going to hurt him. "I slept decently but not well. It was..." Dean looked down at the twisted sheets around his body and to the trenchcoat he was clutching with one hand "Eventful." He smiled sadly before his eyes flicked up to meet Charlie's.
"Enough of this prattling. Chuck is hardly a father." John's voice boomed, echoing in the room as he forced himself with a hiss to stand straighter, hand still over his side "He has my blessing to be King over Heaven."
Michael focused on the aromatic tea in his hand, his eyes flicked up noticing Kate watching him closely.
"Why are you grown ups so dumb? Dad and Dean try not to let anyone see them upset... Even Mom and Sam do it. If you're upset be upset! I'm upset right now, see?" The boy pointed to his face and Cas noticed the boys red rimmed eyes
Dean had grabbed Michael's sword from his hand, holding it up to meet the Queen's blade. His hands trembled a little with a mixture of rage and fear, permeating his scent, souring the vanilla and burning the leather. A growl erupted from his chest as he used the sword and pushed the woman back out of his space
Dean put his head back in the window as they slowed before and entered the city that was below the castle nestled away from the ocean, except for the far side where Dean figured there were docks for ships and boats. Dean hoped he could see the ocean from wherever in the castle he would staying.
With a light chuckle Michael nodded and followed Gabriel into his room. Castiel was asleep on his stomach, on one of the two couches that Gabriel had before the fire, one arm and a wing hung limp over the side onto the floor, the other wing over the back of the couch, arm tucked back beside him, feet over the arm rest, and a fluffy blanket over him.
"Where on Earth should I start with this steaming pile of crap?" Mike sighed dejectedly, resting his forehead against his propped up hand.
Michael huffed a laugh but shook his head, sniffing he wiped his face, trying to scrub away the tears
It was normal in the royal family to present at a young age, around 9 or 10, and Samandriel had presented as the only Omega in the family at the age of almost 9. The kingdom, instead of celebrating mourned when he was suddenly gone without a trace at the height of the war a year ago.
"I don't know. I get fired from a lot of things... Something about not being a proper lady." The beta huffed looking up timidly st Michael
"How is Dean? And your family?" Michael asked with a tilt of his head
"Never."
"We will discuss this further in private. For now we will set up a room for you and no one will know you're alive as of yet." Michael simply stated standing and motioning for a maid to do as he had requested
"What's got you so riled up? Michael not happy to see you?" She smiled and nudged his arm playfully
"I don't want to talk." He grumbled sitting on the edge of his bed
The people would most likely revolt. They would demand to know reasons, details, and would never accept Michael, their future King, with an Alpha. Let alone a none royal Alpha as Lucifer.
Michael had to actively clear his head as he found himself staring into thin air once again - the young, grey-eyed detective frequently got lost in thoughts, especially if he was to analyse something. Most of the time, just thinking out loud would've made the situation he was in so much easier, but no. He was a thinker. After clearing his throat and adjusting his tie, he gave Dean another nod and pushed the newspaper articles towards him - a non-verbal invitation to share what he knew with the casanova in front of him.
"I said play nice Dean. And it's Lieutenant when we're at work. Did your Father teach ya nothing?"
"Why did someone challenge you for the throne." It wasn't in the form of a question, as Lucifer already knew why.
Dean felt his face heat up like the puts of Hell and he knew how red he was.
Lucifer's feathers fluffed up and a growl rumbled his chest
Once at Heavens border the army split into groups, each heading to their city and villages.
"Son of a bitch!" The Prince screamed as the glass bottles of cologne and jars of various hair and skin products slammed to the floor with a crash of braking glass.
Dean bit his bottom lip holding back a wince as he felt the healing cut split open again
"Don't challenge me little brother. You are not the next King for good reason." Michael growled out his eyes holding a dangerous look to them as his wings rose to meet the challenge
Castiel went rigid as his eyes locked on the door, a low growl emitted from his chest as his foot slid into a defensive stance.
"It's Novak-Barnes. He and Lucifer hyphenated." Castiel corrected matter of factly
"Good night my Prince." Castiel kissed the back of Dean's hand with a bow before taking off up into the sky and out of sight against the black of midnight.
"The Omega? Perhaps he's only in his room. Or went for a walk in the gardens, maybe he went to the kitchen." Raphael said logically as he tilted his head. He took a step towards his older brother and placed a hand on Michael's shoulder, his purple wine colored wings shifted a little as he looked at Michael's face
"Dean." He purred before his gaze shifted back to the paper in his hands
He had no chance to decide which he would do as suddenly his father's strong arms were wrapped around him. Surrounding him in the smell of home and the strong scent of burning leaves and saw dust. Something associated with the loving but stern and steadfastness of his father.
"What is it you need Dean." Cas said a lot softer as he placed a hand on Dean's knee, quickly drawing it back when the Prince flinched a little
"Why take me here Lucifer?" Michael whispered, worried to speak louder than a hushed tone
Dean howled out a laugh and turned to look at Michael
Sure whatever made the Prince happy right?
Sam jolted from his sleep haze with a start at realizing it was Gabriel that he had fallen asleep with.
"I understand. It's alright Father really... I will go pack some of my things now." He stood giving John a small bow before heading out and towards his bedroom.
"Dean boy I said are you alright?" John said for what was probably not the first time.
It was repulsive.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Castiel, is Sam in the library?"
"Answer the fucking Question."
Dean hissed in pain as the woman's long nail dug into the small cut on his lip and she growled a little
Lucifer frowned and his wings flexed before looking over to Castiel
"Oh yes, Mikey, Cassie, Balt, Raph. The whole nine yards when if comes to my brothers." He held his chin up as he spoke before the maid smacked the back of his head and pointed to the mess on the floor.
So hot.
"Good."
"What happened to him?" Michael said simply in a hushed tone as soliders wandered around going to rest and relax
As the rain thundered and poured, Michael let out a desperate pent up cry of rage, sorrow, and heartache, only heard by the dead, and drowned out by the thunder.
Years of fighting. Years of trying to make a difference. Gone.
The Angel side down onto his back side, knees drawn as close to his chest as he could get them, wings tucked as close to his back as possibly. Resting his cheek om his knees, wings pulled around him to hide himself from the world, the Prince closed his eyes and tried to relax, tried to get his mind off his broken heart.
"You were dead!" One of them cried out in shock
Please pardon a LOT of odd typos and /this/ on words. I will be going through to edit all the chapters when I finish the story
As Spring arrived Heaven was no longer at war with the Kingdom of Hell, the King had declared a surrender after Heaven threatened to call for the aide of the Forces of Purgatory.
Once at the bottom of the stairs Castiel had to take a step back and breath slowly. The smell of Dean, of his heat and his distress was so strong, that the Alpha could practically taste vanilla on his tongue. It was so heavy in the air that Castiel vaguely heard Lucifer order their men to stay at the top of the stairs and keep a look out.
He wasn't coming back.
"Is everything alright little prince?" Gabriel decided to ask anyway, but he wouldn't pry
"Answer his Question." John spoke up officially done with the Angel King. The Human Alpha growled
Michael forced the tears back as he returned the tight embrace, wings stretching out slightly on either side of the Human King.
"That's me!" The boy gave Castiel a big gummy tooth filled smile "Your name is Prince, Casserole, Castle, Casino-" Adam frowned and stomped his foot "Dad told me how to say it in the carriage and I can't remember!"
"You love him." Michael huffed, a bitter chuckle escaping his lips. Why was the world so cruel
Sam simply growled before he noticed Dean staring down at his breakfast with a startled look. He watched as Dean wiggled his nose and was biting the inside of his cheek.
And again, and again and again without abandon.
John's face fell, Sam could see anger and sorrow on his father's face and he didn't know what to say, what to do. He sat there with a punched expression as he watched his brother for not the first time in the last few days just, crumble.
"Prince Michael returned from the war last night, and your family arrived yesterday afternoon. They were wondering if you would be joining them for breakfast?" The maid smiled and tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear.
Sam watched with a sad smile, he had to wipe the tear that suddenly slipped down his cheek.
"I've chosen two Beta female gaurds to stand outside your tent. They will only come in if you call, and will help tend to you. Their names are Jo and Claire, they are humans that work for your family, joined us about two weeks ago."
The entire kingdom of Earth, was in a huge state of shock when the oldest Prince presented.
"Talk it out while we clean." Her voice was soft as she glanced over at the nest Dean had created of the bed, Castiel's coat front and center with his pillows.
Dean paused and stared at his slippers. He didn't know anything. He felt stupid, ignorant.
The Alpha knew if he stayed alone with his thoughts any longer he would plunge himself into the deepsea for the spirits and Sirens of the sea to consume his very being.
The demon looked down at his boots and then back up at the Prince before grinning, blood on his teeth "I am the demon Alistair, Butcher for the Queen."
"Was the nightmare about your captivity?" Sam whispered pulling a pillow towards him, playing with a tassle on the corner of the silky pillow case
From what Sam had learned of Gabriel he was a kind and generous Alpha, he loved children and was a listener. Which honestly were a couple of odd traits to find in an Alpha.
"Sam I can practically hear your bitchy face. It's unbecoming of a future King."
The three brothers nodded and separated to their tasks, leaving Michael alone with his thoughts and throbbing ribs.
Heading down the hallway, Castiel's footsteps slowed as the angel approached Dean's door. It was closed, the inside silent, light was seen below the door though, a shadow passing by every once in a while. Cas lifted his hand to knock, but paused.
"I know Sam." Gabriel frowned as he opened his eyes "I never thought I'd lose him like this. I mean he wasn't even mated, had no children..." Gabriel sucked in a breath to calm himself as he folded and unfolded his hands "It didn't help that this Abaddon Demon showed up and claimed she was Queen of Hell. That Crowley was dead and she asked for Dean!? Can you fucking believe that?" Gabriel's expression hardened to one of disgust "She practically asked for Michael to name a Price and sell you off."
"I prefer not say." Dean spoke with a setness to his voice but his eyes flicked back to the tattered coat beside him
The thought alone made Lucifer even angrier then when he started the day. He already had barely seen his best friend since they arrived home, now he had to deal with the realization that there was no stopping this wedding, the planners and florists, caterers and tailors were arriving tomorrow  and Michael was as good has hitched.
"He was kidnapped."
Michael hid a laugh behind his hand but his wings shook with amusement.
He had let go of the Prince's hand as the sound and scent of the nervous Beta and simply stood beside the Prince.
Dean raised an eyebrow, noticing something in the Prince's hands.
Chuck stood as the murmuring began to erupt, raising one hand the entire place was silent yet again.
"I'm sure The Prince here is tired and could use a small break. I will escort you, Madame to your chambers, all fabrics have already been set inside."
Dean's eyes met eyes that triumphed over the blue of every summer sky imaginable. Dean knew this Alpha was royalty, perhaps it was the way he held himself, perhaps it was the armor of a knight that he wore, or even the slim silver band that was on his head, nestled in his black hair.
Dean just nodded and closed the door behind them without a word.
Gabriel stopped in front of the door he had been looking for, an undecorated door, as were all the doors, but the simple white lettering reading the Angel's name and rank;
"Whatever Dean." Sam huffed again before returning to reexamining an early map of the Kingdoms territories.
"Abaddon." Castiel spoke simply, venom in his voice
Michael Apologized to Lilith for his little brother's rude and aggressive behavior.
"I'm a fucking traitor to a man I'm marrying soon." He hadn't admitted it, but Michael didn't smell right he didn't smell bad but he certainly didn't smell right.
Dean had a moment of clarity and felt his heart in his head and panic rose. His scent was now mixed with fear as he once again tried to get free of his restraints. No no no! This could not be actually  about to happen!
"Wh-what?! No! Gods no Sam!" Dean pushed the pillow off his lap and stood. "Wh-why... I'm not trying to nest!"
"I'm so sorry little brother." Gabriel pulled Cas close, his golden wings enveloping black as he held his hurting little brother. He didn't know what to do to help Castiel, but there had to he something. An idea suddenly struck Gabriel like an arrow to its target
Michael smiled weakly but it quickly fell as the Prince sucked in a breath. They were now behind the stables, away from any and all potentially prying eyes and over eager ears
"Oh! Good morning Dean!" Charlie smiled with a tilt of her head "I came with the laundry. I didn't mean to wake you." The red head smiled cheerfully as she began to put the Prince's clothes away
Castiel roared, his hand clenching a fistful of the other Angel's dark feathers, pulling them from the wing as his other fist collided with his other versions face
"W-when do I head out?"
Chuck tensed and his gaze narrowed, as he looked at Gabriel, who ignored it in favor of messing with a few trinkets on his father's dresser
With a beat of his pure white wings Michael shot up into the air and looked around. He couldn't tell where the intruder could have gone but he figured perhaps Madame Lilith may know something.
Dean was officially out of the loop. He was used to people telling him he can't do this or shouldn't do that and he ignored it all the same.
"There. Now you don't have to worry about your nasty ass cracked phone dying."
This particular fluttering belonged to none other than his Angel, Castiel.
"No... No way that can't be-" he looked at Lucifer with complete fear he knew who the Archangel was now, an Archangel with no royal blood, born in the roughest part of Heaven that had been taken over by Hell centuries ago, it was no place for anyone to live, no matter the species. But The Devil of the Cage was a bloody legend. It had been rumored that the Devil was in the Royal gaurd but no one believed it.
But then most bedrooms should feel intimate, after all that's where the magic happens.
"Michael sent me clean up the mess..." Charlie looked around at the mess around the Prince's chambers "He didn't tell me what had happened.. Were you attacked?!" She asked quickly wide eyes suddenly on Dean as she whipped her head to look up at the Omega "Is that why your hand is bleeding? Are you hurt?! Oh I swear to all gods that I'm gonna-"
"What do ya say?" Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows.
As the Alpha and Beta came into the Hall Charlie let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding and began to ramble on
Dean still was winning as he pelted the various food at Michael, the Alpha finally, out of breath, admitted defeat and surrendered.
"Don't take that tone with me feathers. I told you we should find the Witch. But no. Even with the signs becoming more obvious you can't pull your own judgemental convictions out of your feather arse." The demon stood, bowed, and he to parted to his room.
"Sounds romantic. Is she to be your future Queen? She is a lovely Beta, of good heritage and wealth. A loyal and noble family, her father serves in the King's court Afterall." Dean spoke of the lovely blonde as he curled up in the chair "Bring me a couple of those pillows from the small couch by the fireplace would you Sam?"
"Partially. The other thing I need this loophole for is Castiel and Dean. There is a law, so old most don't even bring it up except for extreme cases. The 'True Mates' law." Gabriel let out a muttered "Ah hah!" When he found the section he was looking for "Here it is" the angel slide the book to Sam and smiled widely
"ENOUGH!" Michael roared and slammed his fist down on the dinner table.
"Thank you. You're like the little sister I never wanted."
Both Princes said the other's name at the same time, making them bith pause and erupt into light laughter
Every knight, Gaurd, King and Prince had swords at the ready to be drawn. Michael's wings shielded most of Dean, one arm out to try and shield the human as well. His other hand twitched at the handle of his sword as the wretched Queen prattled on.
"Don't." Dean growled his eyes opening as he lifted his head to meet Sam's gaze in the mirror reflection "Don't give me that pity shit."
Gabriel knocked a few times, in a urgent kind of tone. Wings lifted slightly and chin up to make the short Alpha seem just a bit bigger.
"Present your proposal Crowley." Michael stated with a sip of wine that only made his stomach churn. He had gotten no real rest, no real processing time since Dean's kidnapping, return, his brother's challenge, the duel, Abaddon's appearance, or Crowley's return. To say he was under control was a vast misinterpretation of the entire situation
"You won't think that when you're older." Dean smirked at the dark haired little version of his brother Sam.
"Come out and eat your weird ass slushie!" Dean called through the door as he tried for the handle
Heading down the hall Dean had to wrinkle his nose, something smelled, well it smelled wrong and it immediately put up red flags for the young Prince. It made the Omega part of Dean squirm uncomfortably and want to hide, of course Dean wouldn't do that, he was raised that Alphas don't run and hide. Even though he wasn't an Alpha it's what he had been taught.
"Good. I, and my family appreciate the initiative." Chuck commented glancing at Castiel and giving him that look that Father's give their children to silently tell them to straighten up and behave. Tk which Castiel did straighten his posture, readjust his wings and lifted his chin respectfully
"Ben, I told you to put your shoes on so you can go to Uncle Sammy and Aunt Eileen's until Mommy gets off work" Dean grumbled as the dark haired freckled 4 year old paused his cars and looked up at Dean
The demon turned and gave Dean a smile that honestly made him uncomfortable, her lipstick was as red as blood and so were her long manicured nails.
"It'll be alright Dean."
"Dean." The Prince spoke with narrowed eyes, no Alpha was going to try and manipulate him
Gabriel did not answer his door when Chuck knocked, neither did Balthazar. Castiel did though, and was still fully dressed, but stressed looking, though his youngest did not want to talk much. Which Chuck respected, when Castiel was deep in thought a lot of conversation was out of the question.
Charlie led Dean back into his room and handed him a broom
"Good. But I guess since we'll be married we'll have to uh..." He paused clearing his throat and trying to sound a bit more manly
The mansion was a good 20 minutes away from the city center, but the buzzing nightlife was another 30 minutes across town. Main street at some point turned into one bar, restaurant and club after the other as soon as banks, shops, the post office and the such were left behind.
"Why didn't Balthazar let me know he was in? You know Pop needs to know these kinda things. If Baltz messed something up and France is all wet, we sorta need to know this shit," Lucifer hissed casting an angry amber glare to the other man.
Castiel nearly jumped out of his skin and to his feet, wings flaring out, dark constellation blessed festhers fluffing up in an aggressive but surprised manner when a small warm hand had threaded into his feathers. It was the softest and most hesitant of touches.
Dean headed down the hall and finally just slid down the wall.
Ben immediately let go of Dean's hand and ran to Bobby shouting "Grandpa!"
"Baby, huh? Well, she's gorgeous. I'm impressed… not many people out there who know how to change oil, let alone how to rebuild a car. How long did it take ya?" he asked curiously, glancing over at the ridiculously handsome man he now called his partner. "And where did ya learn all that in the first place?"
"And I love getting you gifts. I know the other ladies at the bank are jealous of how pretty you are with those Pearl's I got ya. Even without my presents you're still the most beautiful gal in the world." Lucifer stated as they continued on
"And you're like the big brother I never knew I wanted." She leaned up and kissed Dean's cheek and patted his shoulder
"Kelly." He forced a small polite smile as the woman bowed, wings lowered as she smiled
Michael's eyes were wide as they fell once again on Lucifer and the Alpha's current state. How, how had that happened? What had happened? The Archangel was pulled from the spiraling onslaught of questions by Dean's grip on his arm, the Omega's short nails digging into his flesh through his black suit
"Cas." Dean butted in side eyeing the dark winged Alpha "Just call him Prince Cas."
"I know."
For that Michael was grateful. Eve was a kind Queen, unless threatened. The moment she became threatened she became a very powerful enemy, or ally.
"Dean." Michael breathed and lifted a hand, he was going to place it on the young Prince's shoulder, but halted the action when Dsan flinched slightly
Castiel stiffened at first, sending a wide eyed deer in the headlights kind of look over John's shoulder to Dean, Sam, and Michael
"My younger brother, Castiel, and the General Lucifer, are to thank for Dean's safe return. I was forced to remain here." He had explained but John merely shook his head.
"Supposedly an Alpha, but, you're so short, which happens I mean /I/ am short for an Alpha but... Your /scent/ is so... /Soft/ and /sweet/" Crowley raised an eyebrow as he continued "Almost more like-"
"You'll be a great King one day you know that kiddo?" Gabriel laughed ruffling Sam's hair.
"Gabriel, I've not lost a brother before, but I know it's hard. If there is anything Sam or I can do?" Dean spoke softly running a hand through his hair
"I'm glad you're alive to Luci."
Both Alpha and Omega let out a small sigh of relief at the fact they weren't expected to change or bathe together.
Dean didn't hold back the motherly purr that came from his throat as he tousled Sam's hair and hugged Adam.
Castiel's thoughts swirled and pounded against the corners of his mind, his wings rigid and fluffed in aggression and aggravation, jaw clenched, fists tight, his walk was stiff and his eyes held anger as he made his way towards his room.
Climbing off Bobby’s lap with a polite little "Okay Grandpa" Ben took his uncle's hand
That's how these kinds of marriages worked.
A throat cleared and both Michael and Dean looked up quickly as Chuck looked at the two with a raised eyebrow and small smirk.
“It means,” Jack says, “they are tied together in a way.  They’ll be very
“No!  I mean yes!  No, I don’t feel like I— I
While everyone is waiting for dessert to come out of the oven, Dean walks over to Jody’s mantel and looks at all the pictures in their mismatched frames.  He picks up one of Jody and Donna with all the girls at a state park,
She nods.
printed in a speech bubble, hung next to the fire exit route.
“Sam, c’mon,” Dean tries to say, feeling surprisingly calm, “give him a break.”
Dean has so many shortcomings and weaknesses, and Cas loves him not in spite of those things, but because they are a part of him.  It hurts a little, to be wanted like that, to discover for the first time that you’re allowed.
Dean knows his brain is going into shock because the naked state of the body below him doesn’t register anything besides a distant peal of concern that he might be cold.  Dean can see goosebumps raised up along a tan expanse of skin.  That’s something that happens to alive people, right?  Real people?
Sam had said because Dean was suddenly struck dumb at the sight of it, and Cas looked down at his body, shivered a little from the cold and the wet.  Little puddles gathered around his bare feet and he wiggled his toes until they made a small splashing sound against the floor.
Dean gasped, mouth open, eyes squeezing shut.  Blood pounded in Dean’s ears.
Dean loses track of time.  For all he knows they’ve been down here weeks.  Rowena continues to ignore their calls, so they get dumb and desperate and start in on the spirit world— communication between realm incantations, some actual Enochian divination spells that involve having to look into an
“Cute kid, huh,” Dean drawled and took a drink.  The picture is one thing, but Dean doesn’t remember the sun bearing down on his shoulders or that look of childlike invincibility. He remembers mom and dad fighting because dad wanted Dean to jump.  Dean had been afraid, and the more Dean showed that fear, the more insistent dad had been that he had to do it.  He knows his dad called him a
Cas fingers are frantically undoing Dean’s button down.  “I don’t know if I’ll be good at this.”
“Profound bond,” Sam mutters to himself, huffs a laugh and shakes his head.
having that conversation.  “All you need to say is that you’ll try to find something.”
He isn’t the only one either!  Well, I haven’t..you know.. With other guys.  But I’ve
haven’t.  Flew the red eye to Scotland to pick up Crowley’s bones, but that wasn’t exactly a vacation.
“How do you do it,” he asks her later, once she’s made up the sofa for him and is turning off the lamp.  Jody pauses for a moment, fingers still on the switch.  She flicks the light off and sits down there in the darkness with Dean. “It’s almost been a year and it still—” Dean’s voice turns thick, “
Dean demands, shouldering past Sam to where Eileen and Jack are standing, and then he looks down.
Cas reached over and took the pictures from Dean’s hands, smiling sometimes as he flipped through them.  Finally he paused on a picture of Dean standing on the Sleeping Bear Dunes in Empire, Michigan, his small five year old’s arms curled into a strongman pose while mom stood below, ready to catch him if the sand slipped underfoot.
Cas pulls Dean’s wrists over his head, coaxes his spine into an arch and fucks him that way, his lips and teeth a gentle soothing presence in comparison to those rough and powerful thrusts.  Dean loves it.  It feels like Cas is desperate to be lost in him, to make his mark, like he’s waited forever to have Dean blissed out and vulnerable underneath him, and for some reason—that does it for Dean too.  Cas wants Dean completely—the whole battered length of him—not just some idealised version someone made up, placed in Dean’s hands like an unwanted gift, and demanded he live up to it.
