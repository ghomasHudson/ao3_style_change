-“ he started but Sherlock cut him off.
“Do I get an opinion here?”
“Win what?” Kelsie pushed. “Who can we play against? The closest women’s soccer team is over in Queens- unless you wanna try and play with the rich kids in Midwood.”
“Wonder if this still works,” John murmured against his skin and then his teeth were at the base of Sherlock’s jaw, the piece of skin that made Sherlock’s legs turn to water and he nipped at it. Sherlock groaned and John laughed underneath him, working at the skin until it bloomed red and Sherlock knew it would be purple tomorrow and he couldn’t have been happier.
But Mycroft was just getting started. “You’ve very lucky Mummy took a room on another floor. Imagine how appalled she would have been to hear such
“No-“ John called while simultaneously Sherlock and Hamish stood and yelled “Wait!” But it was too late and Laurel was staring into the fridge that was unfortunately staring back in the form of five eyeballs in a jar, along with the assorted body parts.
“This stays between us,” she ordered, looking back so they were eye-to-eye. “I don’t want that girlfriend of yours putting out a hit on me.”
“It’s beautiful,” John said proudly, pointedly ignoring the look from Sherlock that read
Hamish beamed.
“We should go to the bed,” Sherlock advised, kissing John in easy breaths.
“Why do you care?” Sherlock snapped suddenly.
“It’s alright, baby,” he clucked and Sherlock wordlessly pulled Hamish back into him, spider fingers skittering up his son’s back in a wordless apology for the earlier insult. John just turned back to the kitchen. Hamish still had homework to finish, but John wasn’t going to interrupt.
“Easy for you to say.”
“Sherlock, I don’t know if you want… I only told Mike about us but…” John tried, flustered.
“You’re dirtier than I expected,” Sherlock smirked and John growled, capturing Sherlock’s bottom lip in his own and kneading it raw. His second hand snuck itself under Sherlock’s shirt, trailing up wet skin to leave scratched down the side of the teen’s chest and Sherlock groaned, loud and satisfied, into John’s mouth, never breaking their kiss.
“Violin, yes I know,” John soothed. “I’ll order tickets now.”
John sat up and looked down at the boy beneath him. Sherlock's face was soft and easy, John’s cock still inside him, with his indecipherable eyes sated and lust filled, halo hair a sweaty mess of tangles, his chest sticky with his own come, and he smiled at John, flushed and happy and
“Write to me!” Sherlock yelled out of the open window and John yelled back an “Obviously,” that made the genius smile. And then the car disappeared and Sherlock was no more than a summer memory, etched into photographs and letters.
Joan smiled at her attempted use of slang and slung an arm around her shoulders. “I already feed you and keep you from freezing yourself to death,” she joked as the two made their way down the hall. “Permit me a little anxious worrying as well, if you will.”
“Yes, they will be,” John replies.
Sherlock does his best not to pout, but with his headache, and the burning desire to know all the answers, it’s hard to be patient.
Sherlock sighs and lets his arms flop down to the mattress. John is right, of course.
“It isn’t winter, it’s autumn.”
Sherlock almost snaps the end of his bow. John’s daggers grow into swords.
under his paws? It’s not like soil, nor the gravel by the car.
“I can’t just create patience whenever I need it,” Sherlock complains.
He pushes his hips forwards. His cock, already interested when he woke up, is hardening. Already it feels good. He wants John to feel it too. He slides his hand down from John’s belly and rests it over his clothed cock. John hums his approval and starts slowly rocking his hips forwards into Sherlock’s hand, backwards against his cock. Sherlock closes his eyes again, enjoying the slow, gentle push and pull. After a few more moments he shuffles a little so that he can mouth at the side of John’s neck. He finds a particularly sensitive spot just under his ear that makes John moan breathily. He wants to hear more of that. He focuses on that spot, accompanies it with a squeeze of John’s cock.
Thankfully Lestrade calls in with a case the next morning that keeps them busy for the next week. Sherlock largely blocks out his rant about them vanishing for the past few days, and his worry that
John didn’t have help, why should he?
Hesitantly (and John has never seen Sherlock do anything hesitantly before), Sherlock lifts his foot and rests the heel in John's outstretched hand. For the first time John is able to see the splinter that has apparently made Sherlock's life hell.
“There’s no footage of which vehicle they used,” Lestrade says. “And I think these men would have enough sense to dump it and change vehicles at some point.”
“Kidnapped,” Mycroft says, with obvious contempt for the repetition. “Taken by someone.”
He allows John to lead him back inside. The fire isn’t lit, so John shepherds him upstairs, to the sea side bedroom, and puts him into bed, into the warm patch left behind from his nap. He strips off his coat and shoes and climbs in too, facing Sherlock.
“Are you saying—”
His mind flicks back to their shower together at the cottage and his cock twitches just a little against John’s leg.
He leans back against the side of John’s armchair and closes his eyes. He likes it here a lot. Mycroft won’t find them. He has warmth and isolation and John’s companionship. There may not be any murders, but for now everything is just fine.
“I’m glad you didn’t try to climb along the cliff in this weather.”
John! John is standing in the doorway with a takeaway cup of low-quality tea which he almost certainly won’t enjoy. Mycroft grimaces; he detests being ordered around.
“It’ll be ready in ten,” John says, joining him in the living room. “Pasta’s just boiling.”
They look at each other for a moment, then Sherlock twists to the side and darts away. John chases after him and tumbles over Sherlock when he suddenly pulls up short. What’s that? A human scent. It smells like him, but not like him. Sherlock puts his nose to the ground and follows it.
“You idiot. You’re meant to let your wolf in, not block it out. Blocking it out won’t help anything.”
Sherlock’s headache is a dull bass throb that’s amping up with every second that Mycroft stays.
John’s expression says that he’s already said Sherlock’s name a few times, unheard.
They both wait until they hear the front door close. John turns on him.
last night.
“Why did you leave this morning?” Sherlock asks.
“Come and get some breakfast when you’re done. Your body will need it.”
Quickly he strips and changes. It’s a few days away from the full moon now, but his wolf is just as keen as he is to find Sherlock, so the change is easy. The video Mycroft showed him had the location as well as a timestamp. That’s where he’ll head now.
“I didn’t read you wrong?” he asks.
Sherlock kisses him again. There is nowhere he would rather be than here, kissing John, his One, the only thing he ever needs a fix of now. When John’s fingers slide into his hair and start stroking slow patterns, Sherlock breaks the kiss and tips his head back with a soft groan of absolute bliss.
“Hmm, Sherlock? What—?”
Together their hands on John’s cock slow and still. He lets go and flops back down onto the bed. His brain is quiet and fuzzy, his wolf content, the stress and tension of the past few days gone. John shuffles, turns over, and insinuates himself in Sherlock’s embrace. He nuzzles at Sherlock’s chest, neck, pushes himself up the bed on stretched toes and kisses Sherlock, warm and unhurried. Sherlock feels himself melting as he returns the kiss without finesse, soft and sated. He hums his satisfaction.
“Sherlock?”
Come, run with me,
He nods. Stripping in front of each other is embarrassment-free now, and he has full rein to rake his eyes over John’s strong body, his muscles gleaming in the dying glow of the fire. John does the same. Sherlock has gained a little weight, from the mountains of food his body needs after a change. John, with his doctor hat on, has said it’s healthy weight, and admittedly Sherlock does feel stronger, so he can’t complain. He doesn’t complain about John’s very tactile approval of his healthier body, either.
Sherlock thinks he cries for the full three hours but he can't be sure.
Sherlock's hips roll slowly and settle into a pace that’s like oozing through honey. It feels gorgeous, just enough to send shivers sparking up John's spine, but not so much that it feels like a frantic, hurried mess. John's fingertips flex with each roll, tighten and press into Sherlock's skin. His own hips work in tandem, muscles flexing as he rocks up to meet Sherlock halfway.
“At least change the door back, so I don’t have to carry you home again.”
“Okay,” Sherlock says, but inside he’s not thrilled about the prospect of having to help John up another set of stairs.
Upstairs there are two bedrooms, one on the sea side of the cottage and one on the land side. Sherlock takes the bedroom at the back, the land side. It’s smaller, but cosier. He isn’t planning to sleep much anyway. From its windows he can see the land rising up into the woods at the top of the hill. No signs of civilisation. This will be the perfect spot for them to change. Plenty of space, and no chance of being seen. Might Weres be more widely known and accepted in the countryside? Or more feared because of the potential threat to livestock? Does one hunt when in wolf form?
John rubs his nose against Sherlock’s cheek, then pulls back so that Sherlock can see his grin. “Don’t worry,” he says. “I’ll have you screaming wordlessly by the end of this.”
“I don’t know what you want, John!” Sherlock exclaims suddenly. “You initiate and then you pull away, and it’s all so unnecessarily confusing!”
Sherlock is home as much as Baker Street is home. He thinks about holding Sherlock in his arms, and then he thinks about kissing him on those gorgeous, full lips, and then he has to stop thinking.
“Ready?” John asks.
John slides the hand that isn’t still linked with Sherlock’s around the back of his neck, and draws him all the way in. Their lips meet again, and this time Sherlock isn’t too surprised to kiss back. His lips part slightly, moulding around John’s, his hand curls into John’s coat. John slides his hand up into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock makes a soft noise that he would love to hear again and again, and—
“I’ve been ready for
“Sit,” John says, pulling his face away from Sherlock’s fingers. “I’m feeding you up today. You’ll need your energy if you want to stay in wolf form for longer tonight.”
“Deducing me even during sex?”
It’s proving elusive. Sherlock still isn’t sure how he reached it in the first place.
A soft smile. “And now you remove my splinters.”
He publishes the blog post and goes out to town.
“Someone has to carry this rucksack.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A few blinds twitch along this suburban street. John decides this will be over quicker if he does as Mycroft says and gets in the car. They pull off at a normal speed, heading towards the city centre.
“I’m going to start work. Let me know if you need anything.”
Sherlock’s stomach wrings itself into knots. “We’re—”
Into the cottage, up the stairs. The bed sheets have been washed since their last stay, of course. They smell wrong, chemical, floral. Sherlock jumps up onto the bed, sniffing. Not acceptable. He rolls around, covering the sheets in his scent. John jumps up and does the same. There. Much better. The bed smells of them now, their combined scent. Sherlock walks a few circles and curls up. John flops down next to him, licks at Sherlock’s ears, grooming him. Sherlock’s eyes close. The attention from his packmate is making him sleepy.
Images flash into John's head of Sherlock writhing, sweating on these sheets with his fingers inside himself, thinking of John. Moaning. Moaning his name?
The next day, John dies.
John has let Harry believe what she wants about his and Sherlock’s relationship for ages now. It’s easier than arguing.
There’s a long pause.
Sherlock texts John when Mycroft has released him.
He’d been hoping to change back in his sleep, but this is a point John won’t budge on, he can tell. Fine. He hushes his wolf, concentrates hard on what it feels like to be human. The change is easier every time.
Lestrade changes tack. “What about his new, uh, condition? It hasn’t been that long since he was bitten. Could it be related?”
Sherlock pulls a face. Although he can cook a few meals, it reminds him far too much of enforced lessons in his childhood house. Mycroft preferred baking, Sherlock preferred none of it.
The journey back to the flat is uneventful. Sherlock leads. He has to protect John. They change back, shivering, in the shed, and he hustles John up to the flat and into the bathroom.
John sits up and nudges him. “Don’t be a spoilsport. I know you appreciate it too.”
The ride takes them out to Greater London. They get off at an insignificant stop even Sherlock has never heard of, with no connecting lines. Surely they’re going farther than this?
want Mycroft to know what he’s realised. “And you’re making it worse. Go away.”
He stands up, grabs his coat and leaves the house, feeling like he’s walking through fog, just thinking
Admittedly, it’s fairly large, as splinters go.
“Good day, Dr. Watson. Sherlock.”
At around the four a.m. mark, John slows the video down and watches more closely. He’s never seen himself in wolf form before. His wolf has never been fussed about seeking out a mirror. He doesn’t blend into the alley as well as he would have hoped — certainly not as well as Sherlock would have, with his dark coat. He looks like he’s determined, on a mission. The video cuts out when he leaves the depot, looking less determined, more dejected. He opens the next video, working backwards in time.
the wolf. And yet they’re different.
“Of course I was planning on having one anyway,” John says, taking the mug.
“This wasn’t meant to happen,” he says.
The town is very small, almost a village, but it does have a small Tesco. John gives Sherlock some of his cash and sends him to the local butcher’s before they close for bacon and eggs. He finds John after, in the Tesco, and eyes the contents of his basket.
“You look tired,” Sherlock tells him.
“Trust me,” John says, picking out a jar of jam from the small selection. “Changing makes you hungry. Very hungry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock moves then, grabs John's hips and pulls. John falls against him and presses him flat against the bed, biting at Sherlock's full lower lip.
Sherlock glows at the pet name. John wrestles the duvet out from under Sherlock’s body and drapes it over them, drapes himself over Sherlock, settling his head on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock glows more. He wraps his arms around his packmate and lover. His John. He’s so full of happiness he could burst. It’s an unusual feeling, but not unwelcome. And it won’t be unusual from now on. He has everything he needs for the rest of his life, right here with him in this bed. Oddly, he could even be grateful that he was attacked, that he went through everything he did, because it brought him John. It brought them together.
John gets ahead. Sherlock gets caught behind. It shouldn't happen like this. It is always Sherlock leading and John chasing after. It should be the other way around. It should be Sherlock who gets into a brawl with the surprisingly good fighter. It should be Sherlock who comes off worse in the fight, beyond bruises, more bloodied. It should be John, not Sherlock, who comes careening around the corner to see the other lying helpless on the floor, coughing up blood, as the suspect gets away.
“I love it when I make your legs weak,” he grins, standing up.
Sherlock wakes slowly, warm and rested. He opens his eyes to the clear morning sunlight, the gentle blue stillness of the sea side bedroom, and John’s sleeping face. He’s rolled over in the night; he’s now facing John, who must’ve fallen asleep still stroking Sherlock’s hair, because he has one arm stretched out towards him, fingertips resting lightly against Sherlock’s chest.

John thinks his heart might just about burst then. He’s still running on his adrenaline high. His wolf is running circles in his head, joyful at being reunited with its packmate, its partner.
“Enough with the twenty questions.” John rests a hand on his arm, but only briefly. “Yeah I, uh, I looked it up. There was a full moon a few days before we started this case, so you’ve got a little under a month.”
Sherlock's cock, when John pulls it out of his pants, is hot and hard. It’s thicker than John imagined (he’s been imagining for a surprisingly long time) and speaking of
Sherlock strokes his hands through John’s hair, cups his face, brings it up to pepper it with kisses.
The pinch of the needle, the anticipation of the relief, is almost as good as the relief itself. He’s wasting considerable energy on keeping his thoughts sane right now, keeping the world from drowning him. It will be bliss to let go and just float. The cocaine is good — already the rush of emotion is slowing down. He leans back on the sofa and sinks into it.
John schools his face into a more neutral expression. “No, I agree. Last night was the best change Sherlock had. He’s making progress.”
“You plan to do that? To retire with me?” Shouldn’t he be worried or upset that Sherlock has decided his future without consulting him? He can’t bring himself to be.
By the time he gets back into London, purchases what he needs, and gets back to the flat, it’s late. Almost a new day. The first day without John. The first of many, isn’t that what they say? Unlikely. He strips his coat, leaves it in a heap on the floor. Prepares the needle. Strips his suit jacket, that joins the coat. Rolls up the sleeve of his shirt, doesn’t think about the matching shirt that John is wearing, the way it’ll be removed tonight, small feminine hands. No. He doesn’t think about that.
“I know you’re clean, Sherlock, but I doubt that you’re fine.”
“Perfect.” He can hear John smiling.
John laughs. “That might be fun, but no. Dinner?”
“Do her,” John says, pointing to a woman with an animal carrier.
“Perhaps we should leave the bathroom,” Sherlock suggests, attempting to regain a measure of dignity.
“I can’t stop,” says Lestrade, answering his unspoken question. “I’m just popping in before work.”
“Correct as always. How did your composing go?”
After all that, slipping into a relationship didn’t seem like such a big change. It felt natural. It felt right.
“I’m not saying you should let your wolf into your mind palace right now. I understand that you’re…”
Sherlock jerks awake a couple of hours later. John is breathing deeply, asleep, his hand buried in Sherlock’s fur. Ah. He’s still in wolf form. But it’s not that long after they went to bed; he can hear the beginning of early morning rush hour. Something’s woken him.
“Fine, but you could. You could guide me.”
Sherlock stares at him incredulously. Unusual? Has he not been paying attention to their lives?
John glances at him. “Do we need to stop again? Let you stretch your legs?”
“As you can see,” John says. “Sherlock is just the same as always, and definitely doesn’t need to be locked away in your centre. Now it really is far too early in the morning for this. Leave.”
that I deduce you during sex,” Sherlock replies, punctuating the word enjoy with a delicious roll of his hips.
Suddenly he is afraid. This sounds like an incredibly important conversation. Their entire future may hinge on it. He needs to tread carefully.
Their eyes meet. Packmates. Lovers. John slowly pushes into him. Oh, God. He bites his lips against the stretch, focuses on John’s pupils dilating as he gets deeper. He’s so warm inside of him, and so hard. He swears he can feel John’s pulse racing inside of him.
John latches on to Sherlock's nipple and sucks, not hard, but insistent. Sherlock's hips push up as he groans.
“I feel like a whale,” Sherlock complains as they leave the flat that night. John has stayed true to his word and provided Sherlock with an impossible amount of food throughout the day.
John shivers at the mention of the shower. “I think we stopped being just friends a while ago, only I couldn’t admit it to myself. And I would never have thought that
Sherlock's wide, dark eyes stare up at him, all pupil with only a sliver of silver. He seems to be hastily processing, cataloguing, or trying to. His stare is too hazy for it to be fully working. John starts thrusting, mirroring Sherlock's slow but steady pace from before, drinking in the sight of his genius almost short-circuited by John's cock in him. Sherlock's arms wrap around his back and clutch at him.
He grins and takes off. Sherlock follows closely behind him. He’s put some thought into this. They’re shaking off tails both physical and digital.
“John. Can’t talk for long.”
John sighs, stands up and folds the blanket Sherlock left in a heap on the floor.
For a split second John wants to punch Mycroft in his supercilious face. But then he realises the truth of what he’s saying. Panicking doesn’t help. He stares out the window and tries to calm his racing thoughts.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And my internet history all of yesterday morning. The B&B looked lovely, but we won’t be turning up there.”
John gets his laptop and spends the rest of the morning on it. After lunch (and force-feeding Sherlock a sandwich) he moves onto Sherlock’s bookshelves, pulling out maps and guidebooks from old cases. He’s planning something.
John pulls back. He could kiss that little crease of confusion between Sherlock's eyebrows. In fact, he might.
In very little time the car pulls up outside 221. Mrs. Hudson lets him in (John’s keys are still at Harry’s and although he’s certain Mycroft has a secret set of keys, Mycroft clearly doesn’t want him to know for sure). Inside the flat Lestrade is pacing up and down, phone in hand.
“I know how to fight, Sherlock.”
“Good. Great.” John pulls on his jacket and shoes. “I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
“There. That wasn’t so hard, was it?” he says, standing to put away the tweezers. “I’m sure you could’ve done it yourself with how, um… flexible you are.”
This is the part he loves. When John’s talented hands and mouth and cock start taking Sherlock apart. When all the observations clamouring in the background fade, and all Sherlock can focus on is the pleasure. He knows he gets loud at this point, and he knows that John loves it.
Evening already? The day has slipped away without him noticing.
Who does he think he is, John’s fucking therapist?
John smiles, still stroking Sherlock’s hair. The room is dim and warm. Sherlock’s head is a comfortable weight in his lap. His shoulder presses against John’s thigh. John can feel the tension slowly draining from him.
He hears Sherlock take a deep, steadying breath, then feels him brush past him. “Wait for me in my room,” he says.
in bed with you,” Sherlock says. “I’ve never done that before. Or wanted to. But there’s so much data to collect.”
“Exactly,” Sherlock says.
Slowly twisting his hand around the base of Sherlock's cock, John hollows his cheeks and sucks. Light pressure at first; he doesn’t want to rush this and he’ll save the best for last. Above him, far above him, Sherlock groans. John can detect the slight impatience lingering just behind the noise. Of course Sherlock would expect everything to be fast and hard. John is going to teach him how slow and deep can also be a good option.
Sherlock reaches the cave with ease. When John catches up to him Sherlock is inside, sitting cross-legged on a dry ledge, trousers cuffed and his feet sandy and his hair windswept. This is what Sherlock must’ve looked like as a boy. His face is lit up with a quiet joy that probably hasn’t been there since his childhood.
And Sherlock sleeps.
“I told you,” John says. “I was too hungry to stay in bed.”
When John gets up the next morning Sherlock is already out. He hasn’t left a note, but that’s not uncommon for Sherlock. He probably has a case that doesn’t require John’s assistance. He pokes his head into Sherlock’s room, just to make sure he isn’t in, and suddenly he feels overwhelmed by everything that happened last night. He’d lain awake for a long time after Sherlock had left. He thinks that Sherlock thinks that John doesn’t want any contact anymore, not even cuddling. But really, who knows what goes on in Sherlock’s big beautiful brain? At the moment, John isn’t even sure what’s going on in his own brain. He needs to get somewhere he can think. He can’t be here right now, everything is too… everything.
The coils in Sherlock’s belly tighten. He’s going to explode any second now. John’s hand squeezes Sherlock’s thigh and suddenly Sherlock is lost, coming hard, thrusting fast between John’s thighs. His moan is long and low and vibrates against the skin of John’s neck. As he slowly comes down, feeling heavy and warm, John’s hand wraps around his on his cock, encouraging him to stroke faster. He pants Sherlock’s name, breathless and needy. Sherlock lifts up on one elbow, watches as John comes apart in his hand, arching back into Sherlock’s body, moaning his pleasure.
The sand won’t go. John calls again. Sherlock goes to him. He’s at the edge of the water. This isn’t his home territory (but there aren’t any other wolves here so it’s okay). John is excited because his home territory doesn’t have water like this. It’s
“Yes, darling?”
John chews on his lip as he cleans his cuts. It’s one of his thinking tics.
John is calmer now, reassured that Sherlock is fine with his secret.
“Maybe not that observant.”
John is quiet. Normally Sherlock kicks him out of the room if he needs to go to his mind palace. But now he’s lying in John’s lap, allowing him to see, allowing him to know Sherlock’s
John is so shocked that he completely forgets to react. A split second later, Sherlock is pulling away. John has never seen him look so young, so unsure, so nervous, so vulnerable.
Sherlock lets out a snarl. John steps closer, but not to protect Mycroft. Sherlock smirks inwardly.
“I want that as little as you do,” he tries to reassure him. “John, sit down.”
“Don’t think we’re done here, Sherlock.”
Is he really that obvious? No. Only to John. They’ve been living together for long enough now that even someone as unobservant as John can read him almost as well as Mycroft does. But he doesn’t feel the need to hide his feelings around John the way he does with Mycroft.
“Take your coat off, you’ll be here for a few more hours.”
“There’s enough for a month there.”
“Have you found something?” John asks.
John seems reluctant. “I can’t. I can never sleep when my wolf is upset.”
John moves, crawls up onto the sofa and lies over Sherlock. Sherlock wraps his arms around him, feels the tension in his body. He slowly rubs his hands over John’s back. John gradually, minutely relaxes, until Sherlock’s hands have eased the pains of the past enough for him to continue. He murmurs against Sherlock’s neck.
“I know,” John agrees readily. “You’re hardly incapable. But would you want to?” He pauses. Re-reads the same sentence twice, still not taking it in. “I wouldn’t want to go back to living alone now.”
“No,” John says, “I want you close.”
“What, fail to undo your shirt?” Sherlock says, successfully undoing it.
The smoker walks around behind him, boots scuffing on the rough concrete floor. There is a sound that Sherlock can now identify perfectly: the whispering drag of the whip being picked up, the crackle of it being flexed. He could identify that sound blind, upside down, in a thunderstorm, under water, anywhere. Despite the chill, sweat prickles out on his face and neck, like needles. Long seconds of stillness pass, and it’s almost worse than being struck. He knows, he
“We need to change tonight as well.”
He’s halfway through his food and Sherlock hasn’t started. John nudges his leg with his foot.
Here is my Christmas present to you: Sherlock's first change!
“Jo— Ye—” he gasps. John was right. He’s wordless.
“Sherlock.”
He gets up, places a folder on the table, and shows himself out.
“You’ve already killed people I care about!” the man shouts, voice cracking. “You just killed Daniel, and you shot Ste, and you killed Tom!”
You’ll always feel your wolf as a presence in the back of your mind. But if you’ll accept it, it will keep quiet, unless the moon is nearly full, or unless you deliberately call it out. It feels foreign to begin with, but if you take it in, your brain will recognise it as your own and it will be close to unnoticeable.
It is a normal, quiet night at Baker Street. Sherlock sits in his armchair with his eyes closed and his hands steepled, decluttering his mind palace. In the background, a nature documentary plays on TV at a low volume, and laptop keys clatter as John types up his latest blog post in the armchair opposite.
They were on a case. David Finchley had asked Sherlock to find out who had taken his engagement ring just days before he was going to propose to his partner. Boring. Sentiment. The culprit had turned out to be his half-brother, Thomas. Jealousy. Dull. He’d run away when they went to his apartment to confront him. They’d chased him down alleys. John had been behind. God, his head hurts so much.
“Not really, but too late for visitors,” Sherlock replies. Reluctantly he pulls himself away from the soft sofa and soft, warm, sleepy John. “Up, John. We can’t have Mycroft thinking we go to bed in the afternoon like a couple of old men.” He switches on the light.
Ten minutes will be just right. “Excellent. John, sit. I have something to play for you.”
“I was looking for him.”
When the doors open and the doctor comes out to talk to them, Sherlock is in there before he can utter a word. The doctor looks scandalised and rushes after him to herd him out, but Lestrade flashes his police badge for Sherlock for the first time ever and procedure is probably broken but he's allowed to stay.
He thinks the last thing Sherlock needs right now is to be left alone with his mind. The change clearly disturbed him.
He stares into the depths of his tea. Clara looks at her watch.
Ah, no. John can hear footsteps on the stairs. His door is pushed open.
“Could be interesting,” he says. “How long ago did Lestrade contact you?”
“Some people become suicidal,” Mycroft says.
“You clever thing. You beautiful thing.”
Building number two is laid out in exactly the same way. John makes his way stealthily down the stairwell. This basement isn’t as dark through the empty doorway. Something, somewhere, must be giving out light. He takes an almost silent step forward, but then has a better idea and retreats into the darkness under the stairs.
I imagine it won’t be easy to accept my wolf now. SH
Sherlock finds his wolf more easily this time, and doesn’t take long to change. John follows after. Even now, after a couple of years, the change is still a little painful, like working out muscles that have never been used before. It’s gone the moment he’s in wolf form.
“John, wake up!”
Hell is a place on Earth and it’s called rehab.
“No,” Sherlock replies. His stomach rumbles again. “One breakfast is enough,” he says, as if he’s trying to convince himself.
“Ah. Mycroft.”
“Who is it?” John whispers. “Do we know them?”
“Marco,” the man says eventually.
John takes his coat off him and drapes it over a chair.
John grins. “Ah. You’re just trying to get me naked again.”
John doesn’t have time to remove the rest. “It won’t be long now,” he says. “I hope you weren’t too attached to that suit.”
. John’s muscles twitch under his hands.
“Ridiculous,” Sherlock replies. His throat is sore. “I have a mind palace full of data.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know you don’t want to,” John says. “But your wolf will thank you for it.”
“John.”
“Not all adapt,” Mycroft counters.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You should have learnt by now that you can’t bluff to me. Why persist in trying?”
“Or one could argue that Sherlock is a fully grown man who is able to accept and adapt to this change, like all the other people who have had to.”
“Angry? I’m impressed.”
, stairs going down. He slips into the stairwell, letting the door fall gently shut behind him, and stands motionless, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. Then he creeps down.
He sits John on the edge of the bath and fetches the first aid kit.
“Why not? A life of music, you’d enjoy that.”
Sherlock nods.
“How is wolf life treating you, brother?” Mycroft asks. “Have you decided to see sense and come to our specialist centre yet?”
“It’s not stupid. It’s intelligent in a different way. It can see in the dark better than you and hear much more and run faster and for longer and hunt and track. All those abilities function better than they could in your human form.”
Harry takes them paintballing. John laughs that even on his days off, he has to use a gun. They play free-for-all, hunting each other mercilessly.
“Of course,” he smiles and he’s glad. He can always use more friends in these pits.
“Clearly I miscalculated,” Sherlock admitted caustically and John could’ve laughed.
“I’ve seen it happen enough times to not bother entertaining false hope,” she bit off and Joan nodded.
“Just, be careful, alright?” she urged and John found himself nodding before letting himself out of the nurse’s shack and walking down the road to breakfast. Suddenly, he didn’t feel like swimming today.
“Your tea, sir,” she said, setting the business on Mycroft’s desk. Hamish watched her slip a purple bottle into her suit pocket and then blinked rapidly.
“I wasn’t particularly distraught,” Sherlock excused. “I didn’t really understand it till I was eight and by then I had discovered how to use an electron microscope. And then there was the Carl Powers case and I finally figured out what I was best at.”
“Yeah, alright,” she said, tucking a blonde curl behind her ear and the woman smiled.
Sherlock waited until he’d heard the pounding of John’s feet down the stairs and the slam of the front door before taking his own coat off. He hung it up and then sat gingerly in the chair his better half had just vacated. Hamish sat still as his father’s eyes roved over him, taking in every small scrap and torn nail.
“Don’t worry, you would still have Mycroft,” Sherlock supplied and Mycroft looked up long enough to scowl.
Sherlock could have hit himself. Now John thought he was tragic, something to be pitied.
Mary did not move her own eyes. “Do come for lunch tomorrow then,” she asked and he nodded, unsure of himself.
“You want me to send you a picture in the mail of my eyes?”
“Joan?”
He awoke to the sound of his mobile ringing. Blearily, he sat and answered it, the morning light shining through the open blinds.
“Harry was supposed to help take care of you,” Sherlock said before realizing perhaps it was one of those things people didn’t like being reminded of. But Joan only gave a small nod, still not quite meeting her eye.
“John,” Sherlock prompted softly and John tore his eyes away from the lake and looked at him. “You never ask about my father.”
Above him, John let out a breath and then Sherlock could feel him smile against his head. “Yes,” he promised, closing his eyes, “yours.”
“I will solve this murder,” he declared, hands on his tiny hips.
“- Justice Harry Blackmun presents the opinion of the court, who finds in favor of Jane Roe on a count of seven to two,” the newscaster said and the room erupted into ecstatic cheers of joy as girls hugged and screamed over the sound of the TV explaining that this ruling struck down the abortion bans of several states, rendering abortion federally legal across the United States.
Joan lunged to raise the volume and the man on the TV was suddenly saying “-right now, at the NASA center in Houston we are watching Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt step foot on the surface of the moon- let’s take a look-“
John-“
“Want you-“ John gasps, “Inside me.”
“And you found us,” Shulamith laughed. “It’s so nice to hear your high school has a feminist organization-“
She even sounded like she meant it.
The two thugs in black jackets were definitely not Mrs. Hudson. “Just the boy we were looking for,” thug number one smirked, turning from where he’d been playing with Sherlock’s carefully stacked papers. The second thug was sitting in John’s armchair like it belonged to him.
Hey guys- Shay here. So, we need to have a little discussion. The summer's almost over and our boys have to get back to school. I was thinking of writing a sequel of their next summer together with a couple of bridge chapters thrown in. What do you think? Do you like it? Do you not like it? Do you want to just continue here? Do you want me to wrap this story up so you can get on with your lives? Do let me know.
He turned on Sherlock, face livid, and Sherlock shrunk back in his seat. “He cares about you Sherlock. For god’s sake, he’s your brother! He loves you, you goddamn idiot! He nearly went out of his skin worrying when you disappeared.”
John ran his hands reverently over Sherlock’s chest and the pace suddenly slowed, pausing down to a slow heavy state of bliss, as John’s hands catalogued every part of him, from his ribs to his arms, to the soft hair that trailed down to his groin.
“Your left braid is crooked,” Mycroft said in response and, toeing off his own shoes, he padded over to sit beside her on the couch. Wordlessly, she inclined her head so he could undo the braid and start it over, twisting the strands neatly from the crown of her head.
The first time they sleep together in John’s bed it feels like it should be a beginning, but it’s really an ending.
Sherlock reemerges to hear John coming up the stairs —
Maybe now isn’t the best time for an ‘I told you so’ lecture. John shifts to slide an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders.
“To Baker Street. We need you to help us piece together what happened before Sherlock disappeared.”
“…apprehensive of what will happen if you do. But look at what the extra-strong door is doing to your mind. You can’t function like this.”
In his room he can hear the wind howling through the trees. The rain lashes against the window. He rolls over with a huff. It may be sensible to go to bed this early, but that doesn’t make it easy to fall asleep. He doesn’t know how long he spends staring into the darkness of his room, but it must be approaching an hour. His wolf whines.
“Mngh. Not quite yet,” he replies, admittedly after a struggle to find his voice. “You’ll have to—” (his breath hitches at a particularly good stroke) “—try harder.”
John is reading the departure screen. “Our train leaves in three minutes from the other side of the station. Are you ready to run?”
He slides a hand into the soft fur on Sherlock’s chest and Sherlock decides that yes, he’s settled now. This feels lovely, just as he expected.
“Perfect spot for a picnic,” Sherlock says.
“Right, just go with my bullshit,” says John. “Ready?”
He leads Sherlock out to the road and hails a taxi. As soon as they get inside Sherlock slumps over, obviously tired of pretending to be fine. He leans into John’s shoulder.
Sherlock frowns. He sees John’s dim silhouette shift to look out of the window. He follows his gaze. A bolt of lightning forks jaggedly through the sky, illuminating the pouring rain.
When they’re done, John’s meal finished and Sherlock’s picked at, John asks the bar if he can borrow a torch for their walk home in the dark. He promises to return it in a few days.
His wolf curls up and dozes. Ever since he was bitten, John has been there to guide him, to advise him, to soothe his headaches. From what John and Mycroft have said, John’s own transition wasn’t as smooth, didn’t feel as… safe. He feels safe, secure, supported. He can only imagine how John felt. He doesn’t know the details. He wants John to feel how he feels now. How can he do that?
“John, thank God, finally.”
He closes his eyes and suddenly realises what a bizarre situation this is. They ran away from London, and now they’re standing in a holiday cottage, both naked, not for the usual reasons people stand naked together. He shifts from foot to foot.
Sherlock shrugs. It’s grey and windy; admittedly, leaving the cottage doesn’t hold much appeal. Hopefully it won’t rain later.
He picks up his violin. This can be added into his composition, this frustration, the need to change already, before it’s even dark. He tries out a few melodies but everything ends up with him venting his frustration through his violin, and not in a musical way. After fifteen minutes he can’t stand any more.
“If you could stop that intolerable racket, baby brother, we could begin.”
“Perfect, Sherlock, well done. This will only hurt for a little bit.”
He swipes his composition up off the table and sits by the fire, staring at his music and chewing on a pencil.
“So do you,” John counters.
“Thanks, we will.”
John.
John continues stroking slowly but firmly. “I know you wanted to tease me,” he murmurs, breath puffing warm on Sherlock’s cheekbone.
. He really needs to clear his mind.
Sherlock tuts at his phone. No kennels will be involved. Another text comes through.
“The cottage,” John says.
John knows what he wants. He wants him, John, to persuade Sherlock to go into this private institution, that it’ll be the best thing for him, that everything will go horribly wrong if he doesn’t.
It works for a split second, then Sherlock flicks over again. His human side has control now. John huffs and rolls out from under him.
John is silent for a long time as Sherlock finishes taping the gauze.
might be a better word. He’s probably drunk.
“Storm tonight. A big one. Someone in the pub warned you, so you bought candles because you like to be prepared.”
Throughout this there's a hand on his shoulder, probably Lestrade's, probably the only thing that stops him detaching from the earth and floating off. As they take John away from the alley the hand pushes him towards the ambulance and he stumbles, clumsily. The paramedics don't stop him getting in the back of the ambulance. He doesn't hear what they're saying.
“I thought...” he begins.
In short moments they’re lying in bed, snogging. Sherlock’s hands slide over John’s body, John’s cock pushes insistently against Sherlock’s belly. He breaks from John’s lips and kisses down his neck.
“We’ll tell you as soon as there are any developments,” Lestrade says.
“I took a long time to change back. My wolf didn’t feel it had been out enough. They had to put me under a second time in the same night. I was out of it the next day. Healing better, thanks to my wolf, but weak and still not in control. I couldn’t really process what was happening to me. That evening they restrained me, but a wolf is a different shape to a human. The restraints tugged painfully on my limbs before I managed to get loose, and then they had to tranq me again. They kept me under for the next three days, in both forms. I felt so ill. That was my first change.”
Sherlock looks at him curiously, observing. “May I…?” His hand hovers over John’s side.
He kisses him firmly, then leaps out of bed, too excited to stay still. The cottage! Space to run free, just the two of them. This is an excellent idea, so much better than a change in London. The secret cave. The bees. He can’t wait.
“It’s just that it’s, well… It’s… a bit…” John spends several seconds searching for a suitable word. “A bit unusual. That’s all.”
He’s not angry anymore. Sherlock smiles a real smile down at him and John smiles back.
Sherlock grimaces. The idea of running without a chase could not seem more purposeless.
John hears a dull thud and a low, pained moan. Then there’s the sharp retort of a gun and for a split second he’s frozen —
. When they hit the ground he feels something in Sherlock flick on and suddenly he seems much more
“Slow and steady?” John says. He’s not sure he’ll be able to manage slow and steady though, not with the tight-hot-yes of Sherlock around him.
“So as soon as I was bitten you knew I’d find out sooner or later. Why not just tell me?”
“Oh. Of course.” Mycroft is clearly mostly forgotten now. “Okay, let’s do that.”
He’s a puddle. Is he meant to reply? He doesn’t think he can.
Sherlock flicks an ear. Ridiculous. He likes their furniture, so he respects it (except the kitchen table. That’s expendable). John hums softly, gently stroking Sherlock’s chest. The tune is from the piece Sherlock is composing. Part of the cottage section. His eyes drift closed.
John grins and pulls his fingers out. Sherlock kneels up and away from him and grabs the lube from where it was abandoned on the duvet. John watches his chest rise and fall, fast like they’ve just chased a criminal. His own is the same, he notices, quick with anticipation.
“And you didn’t?”
“I can look after myself fine without you,” Sherlock says. He sounds a little put out.
“Sherlock! Fuck, he bit you. Okay, we need to… Oh, God.”
“Exactly,” John says. He looks over and grins. “You won’t know yourself, Sherlock Holmes.”
He’s still staying, Sherlock can tell, but something in John’s face suggests that there was more to the context of the promise than he can remember. He’ll figure it out later.
“We should be gone by then,” John says.
Slowly he slides his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, around and behind his ear, where John always suffered his own migraines. He keeps his touch light, but not so light it’s ticklish. Sherlock’s tense form relaxes just a little. His curls feel so soft slipping through John’s fingers. If he’s honest, he’s wanted to do this for — well, for ages, now. Sherlock has always been more hands-on with John, more in his personal space than John would dare to be.
This whole exercise is pointless and frustrating. He’s connected with his wolf exactly as much as he wants to. He doesn’t need John’s interference.
“Too late for that,” Sherlock says.
“No bites? No scratches?”
“Find something to do,” John says.
“More kisses,” he says.
John wakes up much closer to Sherlock than he’d been when they went to sleep. Sherlock has rolled over in his sleep, facing away, and John is curled close behind him, just a few inches away from spooning him. He carefully shuffles backwards. He doesn’t want his body to betray him again. He’s been over this so many times, and he knows that a relationship with Sherlock is something he can never have. He won’t sacrifice what they have. The words ‘Sherlock Holmes’ and ‘relationship’ do not go together. Sherlock doesn’t
John’s logic is perplexing sometimes. “What inevitable?”
He arches up, cock pushing into John’s mouth, a strangled cry escaping his lips.
“You didn’t get me begging,” John says, as they near the edge.
He’s getting closer. Sherlock can feel his muscles gradually tensing. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get tired of bringing John to orgasm, cataloguing his little reactions, hearing his moans. John clutches at him. He speeds his hand up. John leans in, kisses him desperately, messily. His hips jerk once, twice, then he goes tense and still and wetness blooms over Sherlock’s hand. John’s moan is muffled between their mouths.
John blinks owlishly at him, smiling, and Sherlock only just realises that he is sporting a rather foolish, sappy smile. He doesn't feel the need to correct it.
“I can’t sleep, John,” Sherlock says, silhouetted in the doorway.
John slides across the seats, closer to Sherlock. His hand cups Sherlock’s cheek, his thumb strokes gently over a bruise.
“Mmnnghhh,” Sherlock replies, rather incoherently.
Sherlock is left, steadfastly denying to himself that he has a soppy grin plastered across his face. He doesn’t do soppy. (Maybe he does, a bit, when it comes to John.)
With no need to avoid Mycroft this time, they take the train down to Sussex, which Sherlock finds he infinitely prefers, despite the increased chance of screaming children and dimwitted members of the public. But the small, uncomfortable seats of the train allow him to sit closer to John, and John doesn’t mind when Sherlock rests his head on John’s shoulder and drifts into his mind palace to play with his energetic wolf. John even kisses Sherlock’s curls to bring him back when they arrive.
“I’ll remember that,” John replies, and switches to the other nipple.
It’s a token protest. His hips are rocking with Sherlock’s now.
The case goes smoothly, easily, dragged out by the complexity of its hidden clues. At last they tumble back home. Sherlock is triumphant, buzzing with success. His wolf is alert and running happy circles in his head. John is exhausted (Sherlock kept him awake a lot) but still grinning at Sherlock’s genius, praising him. It makes Sherlock glow. He feels the praise thrumming through his veins. But then John announces that he’s going to bed to sleep for the next three days, and Sherlock’s warm glow is dimmed by a rush of disappointment. It takes him a while to process (emotions were never his forte). John is in bed, and Sherlock is ready for bed but still alight with energy when his disappointment slots into place.
John bursts out laughing.
When they get back to the flat it’s time to check Sherlock’s wound. John sits him on the edge of the bath, turned towards the light. Sherlock’s skin is pale in the bright bathroom, the red of the bite an angry contrast. John cleans the wound with light touches, murmuring an apology for the sting of the antiseptic. He redresses the bite and gently pats the unharmed skin beside it.
“John,” he says.
He wonders what Sherlock thinks of all this. Of John running away (because that’s what he’s doing really, isn’t it?). Does he care? Sherlock notices him more now, even in the middle of cases. He will have noticed. Will he think that John is rejecting his friendship? John isn’t an idiot. He’s aware that Sherlock has real feelings that can be hurt, no matter how hard he tries to hide them from everyone. John doesn’t want to hurt him. He’d never, ever leave him, but he’s not sure if Sherlock knows that or not. He doesn’t think that Sherlock’s ever had someone who loved him that much. He’s not entirely convinced that Sherlock’s even been loved at all. John just wants him to feel loved, to feel positive emotion, not the spiteful jealousy he gets from certain Yarders. He wants to fill him with so much love that it makes him feel like he’ll burst.
“John?”
John steps away, hooking a finger into Sherlock's trousers and tugging him with him. The blush returns to Sherlock's cheeks, which is adorable. It turns out he wasn’t embarrassed at being carried earlier after all. He likes being manhandled. Sherlock's hands fly to John's shoulders for balance and then cling on, both pulling John closer while pushing him away towards his bedroom.
John jogs up the hill to him. “You nutter, it’s bloody freezing! Come back inside.”
“Explore? We can scout out some places to run in tomorrow.”
Slowly, ever so slowly, Sherlock slides his lips down the length of John’s cock. John’s hand, resting warm on Sherlock’s shoulder, grips in time with his soft, shaky moan. Sherlock would smile if his mouth weren’t full. He loves taking John apart piece by piece, doing all the right things to make him gasp and groan and tremble. He loves the clean-sweat-arousal smell when he’s here nose deep in John’s groin, the unique scent that reminds him every time how lucky they are to be here and together.
“I’ll get you, John Watson,” he says.
“What? No. I have a splinter the size of the Shard lodged in the bottom of my foot.”
He trusts John with his life, but trusting him with his mind seems harder, somehow. But John wouldn’t lie to him about this. John knows how important his mind is to him.
John takes the tube from Sherlock and flips it open. “Well. These fingers may be shorter than yours, but they find exactly what they need to.”
Soon they’re back inside. Sherlock races up the stairs and into the flat, then sits in the living room giving John a doggy grin, tongue hanging out. He has a plan for this evening. It will be brilliant.
Well, that
“I know what it means, I— When?” He wants his gun, he wants to find the people that took Sherlock, he wants to hunt them all, then he wants to take Sherlock home and keep him safe.
want to comfort you, but… Do you— Are you saying—”
“Ah,” says Lestrade. “You haven’t slept.”
It works beautifully. John’s hand, which has wandered to Sherlock’s hair to hold his mouth in place, suddenly vanishes under the covers to push his pants down. He wriggles to work them off his legs and Sherlock moans as John’s arse — his naked arse — rubs deliciously against his cock. John, completely naked in his bed. Unbelievable. Unbelievably good.
“Sherlock…” Sympathetic pet names rise to his lips but he pushes them back down.
Another flash. Sherlock automatically counts the seconds until the thunder. It’s getting closer. Here the storm is all-encompassing. There’s nothing around them. They’re exposed to the wind, the rain, the thunder and the lightning. The wind through the trees at the top of the hill sounds like screaming.
“Dr. Watson? Do you know these men?” Mycroft asks.
Well, partially, but not precisely. John decides on enigmatic. “That’s for me to know and you to find out.”
“Of course,” Sherlock says. “You’ll be there. Unless you find a wife to settle down with.” Sherlock pulls a face which eloquently expresses his distaste for that idea.
“I’m not sure you have the necessary data to put it all together,” John says.
“What now?” asks Sherlock. The full moon is the day after tomorrow. Suddenly it seems an age away.
“Good start,” says John.
“I’m not thleepy,” Sherlock lisps into his pillow, eyes closed.
him. He picks up the scent just a second later. Three wolves, at the edge of their grassy area, watching them. Even from here he can sense their hostility.
“I propose that Sherlock be moved to a centre where this process can be facilitated. He will be monitored, and any issues will be addressed by the best doctors and psychologists in the country.”
He can tell it won’t be long now. It’s a fine balancing act sometimes. He can deduce, can tell what will get them off in a matter of minutes, but too quick and they won’t give him anything in return. He has to find the line: fast enough to get out of there as soon as possible, slow enough to count.
John huffs a laugh and averts his eyes. “Sorry.”
John smiles to himself, trying not to think too loudly about how adorable Sherlock is being. He pulls their sandwiches out of the bag and passes Sherlock his. Together they eat in companionable silence, watching the dark grey clouds that are rolling along the horizon.
“Right. You go and shower or have a bath and I’ll start making us some dinner.”
“We need to discuss Sherlock.”
He doesn’t have a good concept of time right now, but he holds out for what he thinks might be thirty, forty seconds of bliss. Then he slides his hands, one to Sherlock's thigh, one to his shoulder and (in a well-practised move) flips Sherlock onto his back.
“John,” he says quietly. It means friend, packmate, lover, support.
Sherlock feels almost proud of the lengths John is going to to hide him from Mycroft.
“Are you thleeping too?” Sherlock mumbles into his pillow.
They strip, change and set off. They have a long way to go to get to quieter streets. They planned their route together, Sherlock’s mental map of London very much useful. They’re having to keep quite tight control over their wolves for the navigation. Sherlock doesn’t mind (his wolf does) but he can feel John’s wolf getting agitated, let loose but unable to run.
Won’t be hard. His wolf is almost asleep anyway. He slips just a little more and falls away into sleep.
“No, Marco, don’t—”
John drags himself away from Sherlock, equally annoyed at the disturbance and excited that he can now get Sherlock upstairs and have his way with him. His cock is already semi-interested just from the snogging, and from the tightness of Sherlock’s trousers, his is too.
“You were like heroin John, but better. You made everything interesting but
“Why don’t you just deduce it?” she muttered.
“Sherlock,” John chided and his husband recanted.
this feeling before she finished her coffee in one long swallow, tossed it in a trash can, and nodded at her. “Let’s go,” she ushered and Joan followed her into the office.
“I don’t wanna go swimming,” he sobbed into Sherlock’s trousers and the genius sighed before scooping him up, cradling him to his chest. There was a wet spot blooming on his purple silk but Sherlock was rarely ever bothered by body fluids on his clothes, no matter who they came from.
“Do you want to lie down, and I’ll-” Joan started and Sherlock was already nodding, moving herself backwards up the bed so she could lie back. Joan crawled up to lie besides her on her forearms and kiss her, her legs between Sherlock’s own and very intentionally not straddling her. This they’d figured out from dry-humping, how Joan could get on top without covering Sherlock, without her feeling trapped or caught. Sherlock arched her back up just to get Joan’s hands on her waist again and Joan moaned softly into the space between their mouths, reaching back for her and she bit at Sherlock’s lower lip.
Sherlock gazed at him with heavy eyes. “Are you okay to walk?” he asked Harry, not looking away from John.
John looked at him a moment. “Can I read my book?”
John stared at the servant. He’d liked the man, by far John’s last suspect. “How could you possibly know that?” John hissed back. “You just got here.”
“I adore you John Watson,” Sherlock confessed, and he was rewarded with the sight of John’s eyes widening and his mouth curving upwards in an uncontrollable smile.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” he smirked and Sherlock breezed past them, waltzing into the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
John knelt down so they could see eye-to-eye. “Well your father usually looks at the body,” he offered and Hamish nodded at the sage advice. He walked over to the fuzzy body and touched the knife hesitantly. It came up in his hands and he was surprised to find it was a plastic knife.
“Brilliant deduction John, you were always fast on the uptake,” Sherlock said briskly because he didn’t know what else to say.
“I need to stretch or I get uncomfortable,” he said awkwardly.
“I’m a genius, Sherlock, not a mind-reader. I know the obvious bits, friend from school, height, weight, hair color, class year. But I hadn’t realized you’d, well-“
“It was my father,” Sherlock said into the quiet, and Joan watched her, holding her own hands in her crossed lap. “From ages 11 to 14.”
“Do you tease me because it gets you excited or because you’re a sadistic bastard?” John asked as their mouths crashed together again and
“Hand me my gloves, Hamish,” she instructed and Hamish did, taking them gently from her tool kit. She snapped them on with a loud sound that seemed to please the tiny detective and set about carefully slicing the late Mr. Humperdink open, baring his fluffy insides to the world.
“Sherlock-“ John warned.
Hamish took a deep breath. "I'm extending," he said. "Taking off some more time."
“No darling, because we don’t have one,” John tried, looking to the boy behind Hamish. He was blonde, in a dirty tee-shirt and shorts, and he smiled politely at John.
“Let it be,” Mycroft advised from his position at the table, buttering toast. “He needs to process.”
“I will pass it on to Papa,” Sherlock assured and then both turned to the sound of John calling,
Sherlock hadn’t magically started sleeping more once he’d starting sharing a bed with John. But even he had to sleep sometimes, and now he was passed out in his own bed, his arm flung haphazardly across John’s back as they both slept on their fronts.
“Well then, let’s fix that,” John suggested and Sherlock was suddenly much more excited about the party.
“I know, baby. He’ll be really excited too,” he promised. “Daddy’s just must smarter than all of us and-“
“For who?” Sherlock asks, even though he’s too smart for that.
Angelica looked him up and down. “You should get a haircut,” she advised the taller boy. “You look like a girl.”
This time he’s waiting for him in the airport, and when he sees that familiar mop, now practically sun-stained white, it’s only seconds before they’re in each other’s arms, John still in fatigues, and he smells like sand and carpet when Sherlock rests his head against John’s shoulder.
Sherlock can’t
“I don’t like to think about it,” he choked and for some reason, John burst into laughter.
Hamish looked through the car window and startled at the sight of a steering wheel. “Forgot you Americans drive on the wrong side of the road,” he chuckled, running around to the other side.
“I’ll come around lunch to check on him,” John promised and Chris hugged him goodbye, an oddly touching gesture, before following Tammy to the back. John was turning to leave when he heard his name called across the shack.
Hamish ran into the waiting room, eyes already searching for a familiar figure in a long, black coat. He waved to his favorite nurse, Maria, his father's favorite nurse Patrick, and skidded to a halt next to the filled chair further down the hall.
“It’s…I’m not sure. It looks like uniform orders for the football team but there’s two copies of it,” Joan puzzled, turning over the sheets in her hands.
“Oh, love-“
“Sherlock right?” the inspector makes sure, taking in his height and age.
“Christ.”
“Football team has been doing real well these past few seasons,” she kept going, her tone light and casual even as her eyes blazed. “Well enough that Mathews has been getting offers, much better offers, from other schools. But what would Bushwick do without its award-winning team?” she asked, turning suddenly mocking and cruel. “It’s our school’s very spirit. It’s what sets us apart- the best team in Brooklyn. Who could blame you for wanting to keep its coach here? You had to. It was what was best for the school.”
“Sherlock, the boy hung upside-down in a tree for an hour for you today. You tell me what you are,” Mycroft said condescendingly and closed the door behind him on an utterly wrecked Sherlock. Mycroft tended to do that, wreck you thoroughly and leave you to clean up the pieces.
and this posh boy’s eyebrows leaving his forehead altogether.
John hit the water with an almighty splash and a yell of “Sherlock!” As he surfaced, he looked up to see the lifeguard laughing mercilessly, clutching at his sides, and the only thing that kept John from giving him a rather undignified two-finger salute was his kids swimming around him, laughing just as loud.
“No. Not exactly safe to go running through London at 11 pm.”
“Why not?” John complained, laughing into Sherlock’s hair. He wasn’t sure if he did, really, but he knew instinctively he could. Given time, energy, and a lot of this absolute
“That’s the thing,” Sarah smiled at him, eyes shining. “He turned her down.”
“You say that like you’re telling me I’ve got cancer,” Joan giggled.
“Dull,” Sherlock deemed.
“Why are you crying?” Sherlock cried softly, struggling up to cup John’s face in his hands. “Did I get them wrong?”
“Mike!” John shouted and a burly boy
“Piss off, you git. Mycroft’s probably listening.”
“Yeah. It’s a wonder you don’t already. You’re so good at reading people, you’d make a great matchmaker.”
“You too,” Sherlock murmured as the woman walked away. Her eyes sought out Joan in the crowd again and she blinked as she found her, one hand combing back Mary’s hair, making out with the taller woman in the center of the dancefloor. Mary, for her part, had slipped one hand below the waistband of Joan’s jeans to cup her hip and had the other tugging her up by her ass.
The clinic had been clean and small, just a few other women in purple, plastic chairs. Some were with partners, others alone. Mycroft forged most of the forms, stating she was twenty, that she had a job, that their parents were dead. In the end they only had to bribe the doctor, who took one look at Sherlock’s body littered in bruises and poorly-stitched cuts and wanted to call the police. It was the first time Mycroft had seen the extent of it too and he still looked queasy as he counted out bills to give the gynecologist- an older man with salt-and-pepper hair and coffee-bitter breath. The procedure itself took only minutes as the doctor examined her before suctioning out the pregnancy tissue with a small machine he could hold in his hands. It hurt just a bit- Mycroft had made her decline any pain medication because she was trying to detox- but then it was over. The last of their father was gone from her life.
They made the mistake of looking at each other in the near-darkness and both teens burst into giggles.
“Absolutely beautiful,” John murmured, his own clothes on the ground. Sherlock was shocked to see Mycroft was right, John had lost close to two stone since their last summer and his stomach nearly touched his spine.
Mycroft stared at a spot of wall just left of John’s head. “Technically. They’re not living together though.”
John is sure he heard a scuffle in the stairwell. He prays Marco didn’t hear it too.
John must sense his growing agitation.
“Yes, last night was a success,” Sherlock says.
“You were on patrol,” Sherlock prompts.
feel nice. Sherlock strokes and John sinks into a soft state of bliss. Neither of them keeps track of the time.
The contents of the USB, when John plugs it into his laptop, are data-heavy and take a while to open up. He goes to find more food, starving again already, and pours himself a big bowl of cereal. He sniffs the milk and decides to pass on it.
Sherlock nods, John’s finger still on his lips. John replaces it briefly with his own lips, then gets up to go to the bathroom and get ready for bed.
John leaves early for work the next morning, before Sherlock is awake. Instead of the usual substandard articles and poorly researched medical journals that he’s been leaving for Sherlock all this week, he leaves a document open on Sherlock’s laptop:
“Good. Good.”
“Sherlock? Are you okay? You’re out of breath. Whose phone is this?”
The month progresses with astonishing rapidity, quicker than any month has a right to, Sherlock thinks. A combination of cases, normality and time eases the tension between them and soothes Sherlock’s worry that they’ll lose what they have. Things are neutral now between them, business as usual, but his mind wanders to John more often and his hand wanders between his legs more often. Towards the end of the third week back, Mycroft makes a predictable move and picks John up from work for a chat.
“Second drawer.”
“Correct me if I’m wrong, John, but as a Were…” Sherlock pauses, considering the pronoun he’ll use next. “As a Were, one can scent other Weres.”
“But it’s not up
He shows himself out. Mycroft waits a moment longer, looking closely at John.
Sherlock’s eyes fall shut. “Yes. Makes it even better, after.”
“Put your violin down,” John says, standing up.
They collapse together, limbs heavy. His mind buzzes gently. His wolf is relaxed and content. He traces his finger slow and soft over John’s back and John practically purrs. The moment is quiet apart from their breathing. Outside they can hear the waves crashing against the beach, and the birds calling to each other as they welcome the day. Sherlock slides his fingers up John’s back, over his shoulder, tilts his chin up for a sweet, slow kiss. He feels so loved and loving. He’s not good at the words for this, hasn’t had the practice that John has had, so instead he puts it all into the kiss, drawing John closer even though his limbs are weak and his come is drying unpleasantly between them.
“I didn’t anticipate an in-person check up,” Sherlock admits.
John bites at his lip. “It wasn’t a dog.”
Sherlock opens his eyes to look at him. He’s frowning in concentration at his laptop screen as he picks out letters and words and sentences. His typing has got quicker, actually. It’s the smallest thing that has changed since they first met years and years ago, but even so it makes Sherlock smile. Other changes have been bigger, monumental. His suicide, his return, John’s marriage. Getting shot. Telling John everything that happened while he was away. Dealing with Mary and the child that was never John’s. Helping John. John helping him.
“I like watching you connect with the music so deeply, even when you just play a few notes.”
“That’s happening. And I’m not leaving Sherlock, but I don’t know if things will be the same if I stay. And if they’re not, will I be able to carry on?”
Everything packed, they head to King’s Cross. At the ticket window, John buys two tickets up to Scotland, to his father’s home town. The train leaves in an hour. Sherlock frowns as he pays by card. Is he an idiot? This isn’t under the radar.
Sherlock closes his eyes. He looks comfortable there, now that his migraine has eased off. With Sherlock’s eyes closed, John allows himself to look for once. To really observe, as Sherlock would say. His eyes are moving under his eyelids. He’s probably roaming the corridors of his mind palace. John wonders what it’s like in there. Does it take on the form of Sherlock’s childhood home? Of 221B? Sherlock’s prominent cheekbones are pink-tinged, resting in the warmth of John’s lap. One cheek is imprinted with the texture of John’s jeans. He rarely gets to see Sherlock looking so ruffled. It’s a lovely sight. His eyes drift down to Sherlock’s lips.
There’s a moment of silence as John takes this in.
John is silently watching him work it out. He seems reluctant to offer up details himself.
John has fallen asleep, his head tipped back and to the side.
“The specialists he’d see are second to none.”
“I am,” John replies. “It’s just– this is–”
“No, Sherlock, I didn’t mean— Fuck it. I enjoyed it, okay? I’m fairly certain you did too, so that’s great. Good. Just it’s not what people do.”
Sherlock is beautiful, cheeks flushed pink, lips parted and kiss-swollen. His cock is straining against his trousers. God, he’s a gorgeous sight, and they haven’t even made it out of their coats and shoes yet.
doing this to John, bringing him pleasure, is heady.
“I woke up and you weren’t there,” Sherlock says.
John gives him a moment of privacy then follows up after him. Sherlock is kneeling hunched over the toilet, his sleepy, rosy cheeks now pale.
The owner leaves.
Alleyway fights with case suspects are meant to be fun, adrenaline-pumping, nothing too serious. A few bruises at the worst.
One more gentle kiss, and he carefully slides out of Sherlock and out of bed. Sherlock watches him go, watches the play of muscles in his arse and his legs and thinks about what else he’d like to do to him, but is distracted by a huge yawn. He shuffles, shifts up to a half-seated position with only the slightest of winces, and looks out to sea. The sun is just above the horizon, dark gold against the deep blue sea, staining the sky an orange which fades up to the palest of pinks. It’s rather beautiful.
He frowns at Sherlock, trying to understand.
John nods. “Yeah. Yeah, that’s a basic summary.” He’s silent for a few moments. “We were on patrol. There are quite a few packs of Weres hiding out in the desert or the mountains. They’re excluded from society, there, so they band together and live as outcasts. We heard them at night a lot. Or maybe we heard real wolves. I don’t know.” He trails off, lost in thought.
“And last night?” asks Harry.
“Sherlock has a lot of control over himself in wolf form,” John says. “He wouldn’t lash out at me any more than he would in human form. This isn’t helping. It might not have anything to do with him being a Were.”
“Yes, but if you don’t eat, you can’t take your painkillers, and I’d imagine your head is quite painful now, after a day and a night on the sofa with only two cups of tea and one biscuit.”
Sherlock has the music for this one in his mind palace. It’s one of his favourites to play for John. When he has nightmares Sherlock tends to stick to the calmer first section, but today they have time and are nightmare-free, so he’ll play the whole thing.
He’s almost pleased to see Sherlock looking disappointed. It’s much more normal. He turns back around and allows John to continue detangling his hair.
Sherlock hums a few notes, then hums them slightly differently, then springs up to get his violin and play through them.
He hates everything about it. Hates the lack of drugs, hates the lack of stimulation for his brain, hates that he can’t have his violin, hates that he’s forced to attend group therapy, hates that the staff look down on him like he’s some idiot. He’s not an idiot. He’s cleverer than the lot of them put together. They think only an idiot would get addicted to drugs, but  they don’t understand the way his 7% solution speeds up his thoughts and muffles everything else and just makes the world
that getting angry with Sherlock won’t get him out of his sulk, but sometimes the man is too difficult. He could be making the transition so much easier for himself. They only have a little over a fortnight until the full moon and Sherlock’s first real change.
“Your stomach is rumbling,” he says. “And mine, too. I know it’s early, but how about I make us some dinner, and then we go out?”
“When you remove…” Sherlock starts replying, but doesn’t finish.
“Fine, you ‘didn’t like’ the storm. I didn’t really think ahead.”
“It’s better.”
John shakes his head and silently begs his knees not to give in when Sherlock ducks his head and sucks on a nipple. The grin on his face when he straightens back up is positively evil.
Sherlock is silent. John worries for him.
“Well, don’t just stand there shivering.” John flips back the corner of the duvet and pats the mattress.
“Tell me then.”
Instead they play, chase, fight. Sherlock enjoys the fighting. He’s much better at fighting in human form — he knows his body and its strengths and limitations — but he’s still learning in wolf form. Every time they fight he picks up a new trick from John, a new way of predicting his opponent’s next move. He knows John lets him win sometimes, but he’s starting to win fairly, by himself. He wonders whether John is training him up for London, for the violent packs that he mentioned, the ones he was attacked by. At least now John won’t be fighting them alone.
worried about Sherlock finally understanding his heightened senses.
. But his human side thinks it’ll feel nice. He angles his head in invitation.
John shrugs and helps Sherlock move into his arms, onto his chest. “Trying a new one out. What do you think?”
“Here, lie down,” he says once they’re in Sherlock’s bedroom.
If he didn’t have him pinned in place with the comb Sherlock would be long gone. John prepares to run after him if he bolts.
He has never felt so surrounded by John. He kisses back hungrily, arching his body up against John’s, clinging to his arms, trying to get as much contact as possible. They both feel his muscles shift around John’s cock as he arches, and both groan into their kiss. Neither of them can hold back after that. John pulls back, slides out to the head of his cock. The slide is strange to begin with, but as John slides back in deep, Sherlock moans. It feels so intimate to be that close to him. Together they get a rhythm going: deep, slow thrusts that make him tremble. John’s hands run over his legs, up his sides, over his chest, warming his already flushed skin. Sherlock breaks their kiss, pants, tips his head back. John kisses and sucks down his neck and he moans his pleasure, watching the orange rays of the sunrise fill the room through half-lidded eyes. John is murmuring against his neck now, telling him he feels amazing, hot and tight, and he looks beautiful, and he makes gorgeous sounds, and Sherlock melts under John’s praise. He wraps his limbs around John, tries to pull him closer, runs his hands down John’s back. John’s strong hands slide to his hips and hitch them up. The angle changes, and he arches, gasping and moaning. John’s answering smile is breathless and triumphant and just the right amount of smug to drive Sherlock wild.
“Stop, John. I’m home now.”
He finds Sherlock almost immediately. He’s standing halfway up the hill, looking out to sea, in only thin pyjamas and a silky dressing gown. He’s barefoot.
“So… what do you want from me?”
“You’ve only just realised what we’re doing?” Sherlock asks.
“Yes, you will,” John agrees. “But not tonight.”
Sherlock hears it as clearly as if someone were shouting in his head. The wolf, noticing something. A scent.
Then he doesn’t think much, because John has him pressed against the wall and is sucking at his neck. Sherlock clutches at his arms, slides his hands down, around John’s waist, to his lower back. The cold of the tiles hardly registers on his back but John’s body against his prickles with heat, almost stings. John grabs one of Sherlock’s cold hands from his back and brings it to his mouth. He looks into Sherlock’s eyes (his eyes are wild, wolfish) and slides his mouth down over Sherlock’s cold index finger. Sherlock gasps, the sound echoing off the bathroom tiles. John’s mouth is warm, so warm, and soft and wet and Sherlock
, Sherlock?”
Specifically, when Sherlock starts school. During primary school, Nyx spends as much of her time as possible in the form of a bird, perching on the windowsills of Sherlock’s classroom. After classes, they stay out late and play. Nyx is a happy puppy, a soaring buzzard, a cheetah for Sherlock to race. They come home as the sun sets, happily exhausted and eyes shining, and Nyx changes into a little dormouse and hides in Sherlock’s pocket.
“I could spend
He texts John.
When Sherlock emerges more than just a few minutes later, John is making an omelette while snacking on toast and jam. Sherlock moves to stand behind him (closer than usual, or is John imagining things?) and watches over his shoulder. For a second, John expects arms around his waist and a kiss to the back of his neck. It’s been years since he’s had that. He holds his toast up over his shoulder and Sherlock takes a bite before moving away to get his cup of tea. Their movements feel close and warm and domestic, more so than their life in Baker Street usually does. John can feel things shifting. So far, they’re going in a good direction. He just hopes it will continue that way.
He doesn’t know if this realisation has narrowed or expanded his choices. He wasn’t going to leave Baker Street, but can he continue to live there now that he knows he’s in love with his flatmate? Especially now that they’re confused about their relationship. It seems like he has two options now: stay as close to Sherlock as he can, but suffer the heartbreak of loving someone he can’t have; or try and start a relationship with Sherlock, an attempt that would probably end in rejection and heartbreak and never being able to be the same with Sherlock again. Both outcomes seem awful.
There’s no point hoping for something that will never happen when what they have is perfectly good. And if he thinks about it too much, Sherlock might be able to deduce it, and that would not be a good situation. John knows exactly how he feels about Sherlock, but he’ll deny it until he can’t possibly deny it any more.
He comes to stand with John in the doorway, pulling his dressing gown tighter around himself. “What are we doing today?”
John watches him pace excitedly, grinning.
“Not until the full moon. Any sooner will be too difficult for you.”
, swollen lips pulled up in a smirk. “Prostate,” he says.
Sherlock takes a gulp of his whisky. “The wolf certainly enjoyed it,” he says.
“Finally! No, we don’t need to stop. We’re almost there, aren’t we?”
“I wasn’t even sure if you’d come and find me,” he says. “And I certainly didn’t think we’d end up like this.”
Sherlock takes his tea with him to the bathroom. John sighs. He’ll probably find that mug tucked away in a corner in a couple of weeks. By smell, when it starts growing mould.
“You were the one who invited me into your bed, John.”
The frown line that John so loves appears between Sherlock’s eyebrows. “Little bee?”
Then Sherlock starts boarding school, and soon after hits maturity. He quickly learns to sneak out of the dining hall at lunchtime, after three hours of lessons on the third floor. He holds Nyx tight to him, clings, and hisses angrily at her. Why did you have to settle like this? Why did you choose this form? Change into a bird again! Nyx tells him calmly that it hurts her just as much to stay on the ground, skulking where she won’t be found and chased off by the groundskeeper.
After school Joan was waiting by her locker with that same, nervous grin on her face but when Sherlock snapped “What’s going on?” Joan quickly wiped it away.
That was also the year John starting dating Julia Mathers. They went to the cinema together and he held her hand and she let him kiss her two blocks from her house one night after he walked her home. If she had short, curly black hair and gray eyes, who was say that meant anything?
back to the house. They were tired of running.

“Sherlock, will you give Chloe a bath?” he asked and Sherlock nodded, taking the girl’s small hand and leading her unresistingly to the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, John bent down to look his own son in the eye.
,” John nudged him, settling his hands in Sherlock’s hair.
“Shit Harry, he’s just a kid,” George coughed back, waving the dust from his face. And then suddenly Hamish had an idea.
A chorus of “Yes”s filled the room and Anne let out a small smile. “Great, let’s get started,” she said, taking a seat. “We’ll go around the circle clockwise and if you have any concern or comment you want to raise about our response at Monday’s rally, now’s your time.”
“Stay,” Sherlock eased, running his fingers through John’s hair. “So you don’t have to stretch me out next time.”
“Hey,” John smiled, putting down his book and glancing at his watch. “It’s a bit early, isn’t it? Wasn’t expecting you for another hour-“
Sarah shook her head. “Just said no.” She paused a minute, and then leaned in to say, “Of course, now all the girls want him.”
Hamish nodded against John’s shoulder and John set him down. He immediately latched on to John’s hand and the two of them made their way back to the conference room. Sherlock was in the middle of explaining something but he stopped dead as the two boys came back into the room.
“I know,” Hamish whispered back but still clung to him and that was how Mycroft fell asleep.
John kisses back, then ruins the kiss by grinning. “Your nose is cold,” he murmurs. He rises on tiptoes to kiss the nose in question.
“Wolf quieter now?” John asks. His eyes flick down to Sherlock’s lips. His hands roam over his back.
John’s face clears and he allows Sherlock a breather, mouthing at the delicate, pale skin of his inner thigh. Sherlock works himself back from the edge.
“You can meet the aunt tomorrow,” John whispered soothingly, planting kisses in his son’s soft curls. “But it’s up to Chloe, okay?”
“John!” Sherlock tackled him, and this was the proper way to great someone, all arms and hair and flailing limbs.
“Dara Carmen’s house,” Hamish filled in. “She was Juliet.”
It was coming up on three-thirty when Joan let out a soft noise and Sherlock unburied her head from a pile of expense reports.
“No, I stayed home sick,” he explained as twelve or so yarders pushed past Greg and entered the flat. “Who are all these people?” he demanded, growing frantic as they began to root through the flat. “Why are they touching our stuff?”
Sherlock wrapped around him like some magnificent octopus and John only had a moment to freak out before the boy nestled his head in the crook of John’s neck and murmured, “Never leave me, Wendy Darling. I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back.”
“I shall miss you Johnny,” she said, patting his cheek. “Take care of yourself out there.”
“Sherlock,” John corrected, smirking. “I met him when my kids had swim.”
“Thank you Grimsbey,” Victoria nodded to the driver. “I’ll call you when we are ready to head to the park.”
John had just drifted off to sleep, tucked against a warmer body, when a piercing shriek filled the flat. Sherlock was up in seconds, John following close behind, as they raced up to Hamish’s room. John was ready to barrel through but Sherlock had paused by the open door, staring at the scene within.
When she’d been four, it had been a great game. She’d let Mummy tuck her in and stroke at her hair a bit but never let herself fall asleep until Mycroft came in. Then, like clockwork, she’d turn to him with big wide eyes and whisper
“I’m going to send you a book, okay?”
“So that’s why Sherlock purchased all that camping supplies,” Victoria remarked coldly and Sherlock flushed. “Very well. For how long?”
“What if you die?” Sherlock asked and John kissed him temple.
He wanted it to never end, to stay safely nestled inside John for the rest of his life, blanketed in the kind of cocoon only loving sex can weave. But all good things must end, even acts of utter union, and Sherlock could feel himself unraveling at the seams, deep inside the one boy he’d ever loved.
“I’m not sure, sir,” he replied, grasping his stuffed monkey in his other hand and trying a higher voice. “We’ll need to try some speriments on brains and mold and squishy things.”
“Well, I’m sure you could come over every spring cleaning or so,” she suggested and both men turned to her as though she’d given them the world. “After all, what would the criminals of London do without Peter Pan to stop them and his Wendy to blog about it.”
Sherlock, you utter berk
“You had your turn to dominate in the shed,” he reminded the boy and he felt his own ears flush at the memory. “Now it’s my turn.”
Ten minutes later, the two boys ran down to the vans. The lifeguards looked up in surprise at Sherlock, John guessed they had invited him along from the beginning, but said nothing as everyone climbed into the vans and drove the twelve minute drive into town.
“But Mummy!” he pleaded and he could faintly hear Mycroft behind him, muttering about how childlike he sounded. “Summer is our time.”
“We’re going to need-“ he started to worry but Sherlock stopped him with a smile.
“And here I thought you had somewhat of an intellect,” Sherlock sighed and then reached into his sweatshirt pocket and tugging out a crumpled ball of fabric that he threw at John without so much as a by-your-leave. “Put that on. It might be a bit small, but more’s the pleasure.”
“One day you have to draw those pictures on paper so I can see them properly,” he told Sherlock and Sherlock looked up. That was as good an opening as he was ever going to get.
Mycroft struggled for a minute to puzzle out what Hamish meant by “flowers.” “Do you mean it has no fluoride?” he asked finally and Hamish nodded proudly as they walked from the living room up the stairs.
Sherlock looked up at him, eyes wide and helpless. “But you are.”
“Boys, get up!” John crowed, jumping out of bed. Anyway, he continued his train of thought as he helped rouse his kids and shuffle them to the bathroom, it wasn’t like he had a shot. The boy had already turned down two people, three according to Sarah’s count. He had as good a chance as he would with Anderson.
Sherlock Holmes, and even though this was the stupidest thing he’d ever thought of, he did it anyway.
“But people are idiots, aren’t they?” he prompted and Sherlock laughed.
“Three days maybe,” John offered. “We’d be back by Saturday morning.”
“It’s alrigh- Harry, that’s a fowl! No eye scratching!” John yelled and Harry moved his hands away from Sam’s face. “They give you the week schedule?”
“Okay, let me walk you home.”
Sherlock moved him gently, letting him slump against the stall wall as he tried to re-orient himself, and then opened the toilet so he could spit. John ran a hand through his hair, trying to remember how to breathe, and Sherlock stood up to meet him, wiping his mouth on his the back of his hand.
“Fucking hell,” John sighed as he sunk lower in his seat. They sped down the small highway and Sarah reached out one hand to pat his shoulder comfortingly.
John immediately saw where he was going. “Jesus Christ,” he begged before arranging himself around the toilet so Sherlock had room to fall to his knees, fingers digging sharp in John’s hips, the pale boy’s back pressed hard against the stall door.
“Yet another wedding we’ll have to go to.”
“Good?” Joan asked into the space above them.
“Not sure,” Sherlock said, between gasps. “Lost track after four.”
Sherlock opened his eyes long enough to gaze at John in heavy-lidded arousal. “Your book,” he laughed and then sat up, stripping off his shirt to lay back down, exposed from the waist up.
Mycroft smirked at the thought of Hamish asking his brother to let him go off alone for a week. "My brother has always been very protective of the things that are his," he offered and Hamish nodded, non-pulsed at being called a 'thing.'
“It’s bigger than you are!” John gaped and someone shushed them. John flushed and lowered his voice.
“Piss off,” Sherlock smiled and John laughed out loud, prompting the mothers to look down from the head of the table and smile. Then he let John finish his sentence which ran along the lines of “So I noticed there’s a lake on the property” and everything ran a little smoother after that. Especially because John let him run on and on about his algae experiment last year.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock mumbled, unconcerned. John was not displaying any signs of stress.
I know.
to smile at Hamish in the Sherlock version of encouragingly.
“Mr. Holmes,” Lestrade said, actively nervous, and his eyes flickered over to the pair of ambulances. “Your brother-“
“It wasn’t a problem,” John smiled good naturedly and Sherlock felt his heart swell with pride behind him. John was so
As the boys sat at their tables, eating noisily, John took a look at their schedule. “We have arts and crafts first, then swim,” he told Mike, who sat at the end of the big wooden table and was trying to keep Harry and Sam from killing each other with plastic forks. “Then riflery and lunch.”
“I told Sherlock about the army and he flipped. He keeps heroin under his bed Harry; I think he might’ve done something awful.”
“Yes. Maybe. Quite possibly,’ Sherlock finally decided. “Worth investigating at the very least.”
“This is not about me,” Mycroft said, still completely calm. It ruffled Sherlock, how he always managed to stay so bloody
“Get out,” he says and Victor starts. “Don’t ever speak to me again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey Dad,” he tried carefully and Sherlock cocked his head to show he was listening. “I love you. Like so much. And I get you and everything you do and you’re honestly the best father. But when Laurel is here could you maybe act a little…you know a bit…”
-message deleted-
Sherlock reached down and over to unzip the bag and hovered above John for only the minute it took to pull the offending fabric out from between them, before he came back down with a snap of his hips that sent John’s eyes rolling back in his head.
“We usually take it to Uncle Greg and he runs it through the system,” John explained and this seemed to please Hamish greatly.
John paused a minute. “We can make it work,” he decided, less sure, and then they set themselves in motion.
Hamish cocked his head, confused. “Then how did you and Daddy have me?” he asked and Sherlock immediately stopped laughing.
“Papa, I was so scared,” Hamish bawled, breaking down all over again.
“Night,” she said as he disappeared back down the hall and into the living room to unfold his own bed. She stared at herself a long minute, eyes still a little unfocused, gash across her cheek from a sewer pipe and her hair pulled back in a perfect braid, before turning on the water to brush her teeth.
“Now how on earth could you have known that?” she demanded and Mycroft’s mouth quirked into a small smile,
Before you ask, it’s 124 days.
That was also the first time he properly met Mycroft, not just at a distance or over the phone, but in the hospital cafeteria. The ginger-haired boy, man really, was clutching a cup of terrible coffee as though it was the only thing keeping him upright.
“How about we go to the symphony and you can pick what instrument you’d like,” he offered gently, like feeding a feral cat. Hamish considered this a moment before nodding.
John smiled at him,
“Doubtful,” John muttered and then regretted it. It was Sherlock’s job to doubt Mycroft. He was supposed to be the one giving him second chances.
“And what’s our way?” John asked, looking up into indescribable eyes that he could draw in his sleep.
Hamish followed her back on the train and then Chloe took him for ice cream, the two of them holding hands as they walked around outside.
“What on earth are you doing here?” Sherlock snarls and John wishes the couch would swallow him whole.
“Maybe you should listen to his apology.”
And it had been sinfully good, John’s lips on his. He’d felt warm, warm all over and for a minute everything was
“John isn’t my pet,” Sherlock insisted, his heart thudding painfully in his chest. He would never admit it out loud to anyone, but Jim scared him. Few things scared him, because he understood them. Understood what made them tick, what made them work. You couldn't be scared of something you understood. But no matter how hard he tried, he could not understand Jim. And that frightened him.
“You said Harry was nineteen and John was seventeen,” Sherlock reminded her.
“Different kind of wanting,” John said and Sherlock thought he understood.
“And we love you,” John promised with a soft kiss noise and then he hung up, tossing the mobile back on the bedside table. But the mood had already been taken into a back alley and shot in the head.
“That’s different,” Joan jumped to defend her, and Sherlock raised one eyebrow in a challenge. “When you do it- well, okay so there may be similarities. Maybe you should be more careful, actually.”
“That’s bogus,” she giggled and Sherlock, as she always did, made another little mark in her mind at having prompted the noise. “Who knew that all we had to do to advertise was call Nixon a pig? And here I’ve been doing that for free. Oh, hey Kelsie!”
He’d had a small family all his life; it’d be interesting to see what it felt like to expand. “I’d love that,” he agreed and he did not falter as he followed Annemarie into the dining room.
“Oh my
“But Daddy!” Hamish cried, suddenly frantic and Sherlock turned to him. “You can’t tell Papa. He still thinks Father Christmas is real. He’d probably cry real hard if you told him. And Papa’s face gets real red and scrunchy when he cries and I don’t like it at all. ”
“Who is this?”
“Good morning John! Time to get our kids up- oh fucking hell!” Mike cried, crouching in the entrance of the tent.
“Hamish, this is Chloe,” John explained, holding her lightly by the shoulders. “She’ll be staying with us for a few days.”
“You soggy old romantic.”
“Follow my lead,” he grinned and then grinded against Sherlock, fingers digging into his skin and Sherlock’s eyes widened.
“Guys! I think it’s on!”
“You’re awfully smug for a man who just had a cock in his mouth,” John shot back, still slumped against the wall, breath coming in pants.
Sherlock had no idea what on earth that was, but he was starting to get the idea as John pulled his shirt off completely and threw it on a rock where it was quickly joined by John’s tee-shirt.

“There are a lot of different kinds of love, Hamish,” Sherlock offered and both heads turned to him as they always did when he took his turn at imparting life lessons. “I love Papa in a different way than I love you. But both are important and both should be recognized.”
“Sorry to have missed it,” John chuckled from the stove. “But speaking of Christmas, we have a problem.”
John and Sherlock exchanged indecipherable looks and then nodded. “You should have a partner,” Sherlock suggested with hinting eyes. “They are indispensably helpful.”
“He’s given you an opportunity,” she said calmly, as though she wasn’t upsetting the very foundation of his world. “A chance to move on and find love. Take it.”
“You did put him to sleep, yes?” Anthea asked and Mycroft froze. “It’s past ten and he’s only six.”
“It’s alright,” Sherlock said, and meant it. In truth, she’d mostly forgiven Joan last night. “I suppose it’s a bitter taste of my own medicine. I often end up deducing information others are less than thrilled to have shared.”
“No one of your concern,” Jim smiled. “But you can call him Moran if he must have a name. Where’s your pet?”
Subject: Cor that’s hard
So a few of you, and by a few I mean nearly all of you, have been asking for a little teenage Hamish. And who am I to refuse my darling readers?
“You’d be a great pirate,” he smiled and the rope inside Sherlock’s gut twisted tighter at that smile. He wanted to ruin that smile. He wanted to kiss that smile
“So you-“
When Hamish blinked open his eyes, he was somewhere very dark and moving. He moaned softly, his head hurt terribly, and then the unfamiliar voice was back.
“But it’s good, to have a break with my ‘cousin,’” she said, her voice suddenly somber. “A guy I can actually trust.”
She’d just finished washing her dirty clothes in the sink and was in the midst of hanging them in the shower to dry when she heard the apartment door creak open. Mycroft padded through the living room and then directly to the bathroom, not even stopping to peak in her room.
“I’d like to,” Sherlock said. Her body felt good, still shivering a bit with the second orgasm, and she wanted Joan to feel as good as she did. “I don’t think I can do all that yet but I can do something.”
, solving cases, and the other 20% having, what you call, ‘a sulk,’” she pointed out plainly and John could feel his cheeks flush involuntarily. “Just when would I even have
“Well isn’t this a nice surprise?” a voice drawled and suddenly Sherlock wanted nothing more than to die, right there in the theater.
“Hey Sally, what’s up?” John asked, leaning back.
“You didn’t hear Sherlock on the phone Harry. I broke him. Dear god, I broke him.”
Mycroft rubbed gently at his eyes. “You’ll want a lesson, I presume,” he deduced and Hamish nodded emphatically. “Well, you’ll have to wait. This will take a little longer-“
Nancy, formerly known as girl-between Kelsie’s legs, had started running her palms up and down Kelsie’s calves until Kelsie tightened them around Nany’s waist and their kissing sped up almost instantly.
Joan blinked, as though coming out of a daze, and pulled the wrinkled copies out of her back pocket, smoothing them out on Richards’ desk. As soon as he saw them, Sherlock knew she was right.
“This is so much better!” Mike crowed, splashing John with abandon.
I promised age-jumping and I deliver.
Buckle up, we got a long road ahead of us.
“I didn’t know what else to do!’ Joan begged. “I’m not stupid, Sherlock, I knew something was going on and you weren’t telling me and I wanted so badly to help you and I thought- I just thought-“
“It wasn’t your fault,” Sherlock said pointlessly.
“Think John!” Sherlock called, moving out towards the car. “It was by the river, mud and water, but no blood. It didn’t catch anything. It’s hungry John!”
“Cambridge,” he smiled and Annemarie let out a low whistle, revealing yet another little sliver about her character.
“No,” he purred and Mike shuddered. “But if it helps, think what you like.” And with that, he strolled away to wake up the B221 boys. With yodeling.
“Your shaving strokes are uneven,” Sherlock said and John’s eyes widened. “You can see, especially in the firelight, it’s faint but they’re across instead of against the grain. No one ever taught you to shave, you taught yourself. Ergo, dead father who passed a while ago, long before you started needing to shave.”
. And he wasn’t. He was scared of what he’d find, a Sherlock thinned and wide eyed, spaced out and distant.
“You don’t have anyone. And I’ll be damned if you lose your first friend because of some loyalty to me-“
“I want to be a pirate,” Sherlock told him with absolutely no hesitation and John nearly laughed out loud.
“Even when you’re sick, you read me like a book,” John swore, looking at Sherlock with a mix of pity and pride.
“Harry, go to his room and tell him John is on the phone and I get one bloody phone call a week and he better talk to me.”
And then John had pulled back and Sherlock had seen in those eyes confusion and
“Does he work for you? Is that it? Did you bring your
“I don’t want to learn the violin,” a voice said seriously from the doorway and both men turned to find Hamish at the bottom of the stairs with his hands on his hips. “I’ll take music lessons. But not the violin.”
Sherlock,” he begged and Sherlock blushed.
biological reaction.
“Because you’re better than them,” John said immediately, rubbing Sherlock’s knuckles with his thumb. “Because they know that you will rule the world or do something equally amazing and all they’ll ever have is a desk job and a drunk wife.”
John tells him.
John laughed, loud and eager and it eased Sherlock. He could identify John across Greater London by that laugh alone. Pressed for time, he could identify him by his intake of breath right before he laughed.
Sherlock noticed, of course he noticed, and pulled back sharply. “John-“ he warned but John was already moving back too, eyes wide. He realized with a sudden jolt he hadn’t really believed Sally, hadn’t believed that such a brilliant mind could have let it waste away, until that very moment.
“It’s hot,” Mike shrugged, and it was, criminally hot. Flies had been wilting on their windowsill all morning.
or something.
“Yeah, that’s it,” Hamish agreed.
Sherlock heard the house door close behind her before he turned to Mycroft.
“No it’s-“ Sherlock stopped himself from saying beautiful.
” he explained and she groaned.
“Not a problem,” John smiled back and handed Mycroft his key.
Mike nods, smiling back. “Thanks for coming. We’d love to have you round for dinner once she’s a little less fussy and Molly’s back on her feet.”
John was awake now. “You had a wank right next door while I was reading?”
“I’ve never been to the opera,” John confessed, blushing slightly.
Inside was dark and loud, with people in his personal space and music he didn’t like blaring at him from all directions. Sherlock felt uncomfortable. No, he felt
Mycroft smiled awkwardly. “It’s quite all right,” he excused, “I was just leaving.”
“Yes it is,” Sherlock put it from his seat in the back. “It’s the most dangerous game ever played. Although I would appreciate if you left me out of your games in the future Mycroft.”
“How are the cases?”
Where exactly did you go to take these?
“My kids have a movie in the dining hall,” John told him, sitting down by the slide so they were on the same level. “I’ll be there with them.”
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock snapped, impatient. “Wait here a moment, I have the letter upstairs-“
They roamed the halls of ASDA together, throwing a collection of food and sprays into a bag. Sherlock stole something from John’s cart. John dutifully chased him down the halls, yelling at him. They threw pillows at each other in the bedding section. John convinced the thin boy to buy some canned vegetables. And, at 11:45, they climbed back into the vans and drove back to camp.
“Let’s go back,” he urged, and this time they ran next to each other. Their shadows overlapped and Sherlock was more than happy to think symbolism.
The woman to her right was talking about being raped by a friend of her brother’s, about his clammy hands and his thick breath, and all Sherlock could feel were those hands- cold and sharp and never sweaty. Never ruffled. The way they’d held her neck, pushed down on her hipbone until she could feel the sharp press of the bedframe from beneath the mattress, counting down in her head from one hundred-
“He held her hand.”
of me, I’ve never wanted something so badly-“
At eight, she cooked up some noodles with cheese, ate a little more than a fourth, and set the rest aside in a plastic tin in the fridge for when Mycroft came home. She lit matchboxes on fire from nine to eleven just to see which kind of cardboard burned faster, and crawled into bed at twelve so she could avoid her brother when he came in at twelve thirty, sweaty and exhausted, to check on her.
“I’m not allowed to leave my kids on the last night,” John told him, turning his head slightly, and if his lips brushed the lifeguard’s ear, who was to say it was his fault? “You can come visit us.”
“You constantly underestimate how much he cares for you,” Mycroft said softly and John shook his head. He knew Sherlock cared for him, every now and then he even imagined he loved him. But there was no way Sherlock loved John as much as John loved Sherlock. It wasn’t physically possible.
“Oh god,” John cried softly, a sob rising in his throat, and Sherlock kissed him till he was dizzy, till he couldn’t see straight.
“I love ducks!” Hamish encouraged and Mycroft felt his chest ease. “I love ducks and I love school and I love the whole world! Did you know my room didn’t have a rug until last week when we asked Mrs. Teacher in room 9 if we could have one of her rugs so now we have a rug in the shape of an elephant with all the letters of the alphabet on it.”
“You want to live together?” Sherlock said, softly.
“Amen,” Sherlock grinned against John’s mouth and Lestrade coughed.
“It’s stuffed, it hardly needs a name,” Sherlock scoffed but John noticed he held the bear closely against his hip, one arm wrapped around it protectively.
suit and gasping into Sherlock’s open mouth.
“- and I have this idea I want to try and test out with Nitro-chlorine. You in?”
“Mycroft?”
“Oi, don’t tell him your name- idiot!” someone from the driver’s seat called back and the car took a sharp turn. George’s box slid a few centimeters and a cloud of dust was kicked up.
and firmly shut the door.
There was some laughter around the room and one choked guffaw from the woman sitting next to Anne who, upon closer inspection, Sherlock realized was Shulamith in her wide, circular glasses with her bushy hair held back in two braid.
Sherlock looked put out. “I had a problem I wanted to run by him. I’ll just call.”
?” Sherlock sighed before shifting his focus to John’s neck, sucking bruising kisses into the soft flesh there before moving down to kiss John’s chest, sending jolts directly to his sorely confused cock.
John didn’t look offended, just tilted his head because he knew Sherlock would explain and Sherlock did.
“You’re busy,” she reminds him. “And you forget what we mere mortals need sometimes.”
“And how’d you know about my dad?” John pressed, pushing back unpleasant memories.
“As you get older, you become more and more aware of how much time you have and how you’ve used it,” he confided. “Nothing is worth putting off.”
“It was really nice Mum,” John smiled.
“You won’t even miss me,” John tried. “You’ll be at Uni, exploding things and driving your teachers mad and working with the Met to save the world.”
You’re a berk
There are few things John registers doing anymore. He didn’t need to; everything is yelled at him, commanded to him by tall men in green camo. How and when to eat, how and when to sleep, how and when to move his feet and arms.
it was near pornographic.
“Right,” John said and then the kiss must have hurtled itself back into his mind because John let out a small
"Short wail means she's hungry," Hamish decoded and his father gave him a long look.
“Shit,” John groans, arching into his touch, “you’re going to ruin my suit.”
“I’d be a corn,” Hamish explained animatedly. “See, cause then I could be so many things! I could be baked, raw, mashed. And I could even be popcorn! And if I was popcorn I could see a lot of films cause popcorn lives in the cinema and I could just jump out of the little glass case and roll into the theater only I might not be able to see so well on account of how popcorn can’t jump up into a seat.”
“Maybe you should set her up with someone.”
“I’m so scared of ruining the illusion. I want him to keep believing, Sherlock. It makes all the difference,” John explained sitting down.
One officer stayed behind and helped John up. “You okay son?” he asked and John brushed himself off.
“Pa?” Hamish’s voice echoed in from the front hall to the den seconds before his own feet pounded up the stairs. “Pa, are you here?”
“Still. I had my first kiss at twelve,” he confessed and Sherlock didn’t try to hide his shock. Was that normal? He tried to imagine himself at twelve, all gangly limps and untamed hair.
“It will definitely freak her out,” Hamish promised and John was already looking apologetic.
Her brother was sprawled across the pull-out couch he fastidiously refolded every morning before he went to work and then undid each late night after he came home.  Back in what Sherlock adamantly refused to refer to as ‘their old house,’ her brother had not only had his own room, but a small personal study beside it. Even after he’d gone to college and moved out most of his books, the maids still dusted it every Monday. No one was supposed to go in but Sherlock would curl herself up underneath the mahogany desk on particularly bad days, missing her brother with a pain she refused to label.
“Don’t worry, I have big plans for you tonight that involve me peeling that suit off,” he whispers, hot breath sending chills down John’s spine despite the June warmth. “Possibly with my teeth.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
John was going to come in a fucking camp shower.
“You don’t have to watch me, I’m not a child,” Sherlock reminded him. Although the thought of John watching him, John
, she would have been wearing at least one.”
When John left, Sherlock drove with him to the airport.
“No, no, I’d love to meet them, sure we’d get along
“You are in Uni, yes?” Victoria asked.
-message deleted-
Sherlock turned red and shook his head, running into his room and closing the connecting door. He could hear John laughing as he lay panting against the frame and let himself smile.
“I want my Daddy,” Hamish sniffled. “And my Papa.”
“Hey, I just thought- my friend Mike texted me. There’s supposed to be this house party tomorrow night, we could borrow the car. Have you been to a house party before?” John said, his words a stream of conscious.
John came back from the community pool wet and dejected for the fourth time that month. They, well mostly he, had been trying to teach Hamish to swim but the four-year-old was not buying it.
“K is a very nice letter,” Mycroft agreed.
“I love you too,” Sherlock promised and they kissed, slowly, with all the time in the world. The room was lit up by the afternoon sun, lazy and languid, as John swirled his tongue in Sherlock’s mouth, fingers trailing down Sherlock’s back in long, lazy lines.
“Hurry,” Sherlock urged and John could have cried.
“It’ll be closed soon, let’s go,” she prompted and Sherlock rushed over to pull her boots on, holding Joan’s hand for support. “You mind telling me again what we’re looking for? Not sure I really got it the first time.”
And it didn’t even make sense. So she’d gone to a meeting and had never come back. People did that all the time. She didn’t see Joan following anyone else around. Why, of all people, had she been picked as the senior’s pet project?
“You too,” Sherlock nodded, and Joan looked confused. “You’re dripping all over the carpet, go change,” she instructed and Joan nodded, embarrassed, before fishing out a long-sleeved shirt and worn pants. She stripped in front of Sherlock, never shy with her body, but Sherlock looked away anyway as the two of them dressed in silence.
“Yeah Sherlock?” John asked, looking over at him.
“Bit late to catch him anyway,” Sherlock admitted and John smiled.
John nodded. “That’s right. And did we give you permission to take Daddy’s things?”
The drive was only four hours and John had just come to the last chapter of his book when the car stopped and the passenger door opened.
“Stupid nurturing complex,” Sherlock muttered and John kissed him again.
“John-“ Sherlock said softly and John drew back, a worried look immediately crossing his face.
“Hey, stranger,” Joan smiled at her, pushing her ponytail back over her shoulder and Sherlock spared her a tiny wave before sitting back down on the team’s bench. “I just need to finish with this one and then I’m off to the shower. Don’t feel obligated to help.”
how did that feel so good?
“Mike!”
“Mummy was just showing him baby pictures,” he said casually. “Yours, specifically.”
You know how people like to quote great literature, philosophers etc in conversations? Well Irene likes to quote... (make of that what you will.)
Dressed in swimsuits, cuts properly bandaged, and sunscreen liberally applied, the boys headed out to arts and crafts where they made coffee mugs and then headed down, running and hollering, to the lake.
“Thank though,” he tried again, smiling, and taking the tickets from Mycroft. “Now tell me what this is really about.”
. “Tried to run. Not a smart move.”
“Not as messy as you said,” was all Sherlock said before he dived back in again. His tongue ghosted on John’s lips and John felt himself open his mouth, felt Sherlock’s tongue rub against his like fire, felt Sherlock bite his lower lip, felt Sherlock moan softly as their mouths collided again and again and
“Stop,” he ordered and John did, looking concerned. “Too much…” he struggled to explain and John laughed.
“I’m here all week,” she joked but then they were separating the kids into groups and John found himself in a raft with Sam, Jason, two girls from G221 and Molly.
“You can still have torch time after lights out,” Mike eased, an already-drowsy Carl on his lap.  “And you can talk to your neighbor as long as you whisper and stay in your bunk-beds.”
John glanced up from his book from where he was curled in the huge bed
“Can you manage these yourself?” she asked and Sherlock nodded, sitting herself down on the bed to pull the worn t-shirt over her head.
Mycroft eyed his assistant warily. “Hamish, whatever is this about?” he questioned.
“Faggot.”
“She was going to poison you,” Hamish imputed. “Just like she poisoned Mr. Humperdink. The poison is in her pocket, Pa- I mean, my partner.”
Lestrade was all nervous energy and frantic motions. “Yes. We think-“
“Mycroft,” Greg sighs happily, smiling at him, but Sherlock knows better.
No screams woke him up and Sherlock almost missed them.
“I know just- not so high,” he protested meekly and Hamish dutifully slowed the swing down a bit. Sherlock looked back towards his bench but Irene was gone, her words about builders and wreckers circling through his head as he watched Hamish push Chloe, beaming as she let out a chocked laugh.
“Oh wonderful,” Victoria smiled. “We must throw you a going-away party at the end of August.”
Sherlock smiled at him and if John didn’t know better, he’d say it was fond. “Not tonight,” he excused, despite how hard he seemed pressed against John’s leg. “Tonight was your turn.”
She opened her mouth on instinct, ready to rattle off her perfectly believable story, but what was resting on the other side of her throat was not words at all.
“Not much to tell. Older brother, mother, father. Standard family model,” Sherlock said, not even bothering to look at him.
“One day, that will be you,” Mycroft said suddenly, pointing at the bathroom where Sherlock puked his guts out. “I am more interesting than he is for now, but I expect that to change. I say that not as a brother,” he said, addressing John’s shocked face, “but as a genius, in my own right.
“You’re an inspector,” Sherlock began and John knew they were done for. “Have been for five- no six years. Desperate to move up but you just can’t quite get there, can you? Stuck, that’s you, stuck at work, stuck in a loveless marriage. You’re wife cheated on you, thought about leaving, but you forgave her. Bad move, cheaters always cheat again. Two kids, young, toddler and baby- so that’s why you won’t leave her. Dog too, short haired. Poorly trained, but that’s your kids fault, they feed him scraps.
This time it wasn't much of a silent conversation. "I love you too, you tosser," John grinned and Sherlock stuck his tongue out at him before stalking off.
“You,” Sherlock said, even though
Armchair listened and the police stormed in two minutes after that, Lestrade at the head of the pack followed by two arms-carrying officers. He searched immediately for his nephew and then couldn’t hold back an incredulous headshake at the sight of the teen holding two assailants up at gunpoint.
The reply is almost instantaneous.
We don’t get long leaves
“Why is forensics here?” he asked as people started to shift up the stairs. “And like half of IT? And, hey Sally!”
“John please,” he begged, grabbing John’s wrists and locking eyes. “John I go to school with them, I have to live with them for another two years, just please. Let me handle this.”
The boys called him “Three-Grades Watson,” and the girls dyed their hair black and got perms. Sherlock just rolled his eyes and never realized all of John’s exes could be his twin.
as her Holmes children but she certainly wasn’t your average middle-age woman and most of her “friends” were equally rich socialite women who competed over most expensive dress. Cynthia Watson was so profoundly different from those women it took Sherlock a minute to realize Cynthia was Victoria’s John.
“You are famous, Joan Watson,” Sherlock teased right back. “I might have to start making appointments just to see you.”
“Night, love,” John kissed back and then he watched them walk up the stairs to the flat as he turned back to thank Mrs. Hudson, smiling as he heard Sherlock begin, “Well Hamish, when I say something is mangled, it simply means-“
A small blonde woman in cheap jeans and a loose tee-shirt stepped out and into the waiting arms of Victoria Holmes, dressed in her usual Kors fitted dress, heels and perfectly manicured nails.
“You were

person.”
Or maybe you’re just going into withdrawal…. What was the phrase again? Right, you compared me to heroin.
This is not the last you'll see of me.
“Would you mind if I bought you one?”
"For goodness sakes, John. Must you be such a gentleman about this-" Sherlock started effortlessly and then whined as John pressed inside him, two fingers scissoring gently, stretching him out.
scared anymore.
“We have time,” John laughed, curling up into the arms of the taller boy. “We have all summer.”
“He hit me once, in a nightmare,” Sherlock confesses and she nods.
Hamish didn’t seem to be paying attention though as he followed Molly to an autopsy table. She gently nudged over a stepstool and Hamish climbed up it without comment, watching her unload the body from the bag and lay it out.
“If it looks ridiculous, but it works, then it’s not ridiculous,” she said back, plaiting and unplaiting the bottom of her hair to keep her hands moving. She needed a cut, the tangle of her curls was getting miserable, but right now it was still another source of warmth. “I loathe repetition, Joan, so I’ll let you answer this one yourself.”
"Oh god, have you gone blind?" Sherlock cried helplessly and his husband smirked at him.
couldn’t even say the words ‘birth control’ because of all the lovely images it prompted and god, birth control was not
“It’s wonderful, Sherlock. I did my first in-field patch up. I feel like I’m helping out here, Sherlock. Like I’m changing lives.”
She heard Mycroft sigh, the softest noise, before he cleared his throat. “I left money on the counter if you could pick up some milk and fruit tomorrow after school.”
Yes, I do realize the profound lack of smut this chapter. Patience, my young grasshoppers.
“Yeah?”
“You don’t use a pillow,” he pointed out.
the ring there!”
“Jesus,” John whispered, tightening his hold on the younger boy. “I thought-“
“We packed up our bags while my parents were out for the afternoon,” Sherlock told Joan, who was still holding her ankle. “Whatever we could carry- a suitcase and a duffle bag each. Some jewelry we could pawn but nothing too expensive. Took the train to New York, spent too much on a motel, and found a clinic two days later who could take me.”
Usually their kisses were soft and calm, neither one rushing, neither one pushing. This kiss was desperate, the kiss of two boys denied each other for months. John’s hand went up to wrap itself in Sherlock’s black curls, and his other hand found the younger boy’s waist, desperately trying to pull them even closer.
“Why?” John asked, leaning back on his elbows to look at the boy. Sherlock could have been asleep, face soft and calm, breath even, eyes closed. Only his voice, constant and unaffected, confirmed he was not adrift in dreams.
“You must be really drunk,” John said, taking his finger from Sherlock’s mouth and petting his cheek. “Go to sleep.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Exactly,” she grinned and then turned as Yvette took out a pad and pen and cleared her throat.
“How long do we have before he comes down again?” Sherlock begged, already working on opening John’s shirt.
“Papa!” Hamish called down and both men turned towards the steps on instinct. “Come see our drawing!”
The Holmeses were not nearly as excited.
“Yes?” she asked sullenly, leaning on the doorpost, and it took Hamish a minute to remember how to speak.
“The mugger had taken my coat too so I was shivering and this shorter, blond man comes up behind the beanpole and shrugs off his coat before draping it around me and introducing himself as Doctor Watson. That was when they told me my mugger was actually a serial killer they’d been chasing for weeks and suddenly I wasn’t so upset about my wallet being taken. I filled out a report, was escorted home, and felt personally responsible when they caught the mugger two days kater based of my description. That should have been the end of it.”
“Finished my service a couple of months ago,” she explains, sitting down. “Lasted two months on pension before I wanted to tear my hair out. Figured I’d start my own clinic.”
“You boys are so lonely up here,” Victoria Holmes in the tone both boys had come to associate with
“So basically your advice is I should wait for Laurel to do something?” Hamish smirked.
Hamish shook his head and John smiled to himself. "I'll have to find it and show it to you," he noted. "Meticulous notes, that man took. On what you ate, drank, how much you pooped, consistency-"
and then she was outside making the four block trek to her own apartment.
Sherlock woke up the next morning and, for a moment, fear gripped him as he thought it was all just a dream. But then John’s kiss from last night rolled back to him with their kisses by the lake, Sherlock’s back against a tree, as John taught him how to turn his head, where to put his hands, how to rock back and forth until they’d both been dizzy.
, clearly we had different tastes.”
“Thank you so much for having me,” she smiled, handing over the wine, and Sherlock set down his violin to join them.
“We don’t have-“ he started but John snapped at him, cock practically leaking.
Sherlock could feel his eyes drifting closed and John muttering, “Sleep it off,” before they were pulling up in front of the house and John was helping Sherlock out of the car.
Hamish shook his head, embarrassed to meet his father’s eyes. “No, you love chemistry. And I love you so I can see where you’re getting confused-“
Neither of them were surprised when the librarian on duty asked them to leave two minutes later.
“Brilliant,” his Da agreed and Hamish glowed with pride. He looked behind his Pa’s shoulder to see his Uncle Greg coming down the aisle.
“Hamish-“
“78 days!”
“I know you’re not particularly fond of me right now but if you think I’m going to let you put yourself in danger,” Joan said, hands on her hips. “I’m not joking Sherlock, I’m still your friend-“
