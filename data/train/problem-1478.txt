After he put the groceries away, John headed upstairs, a small smile on his face as he took off his shirt to prepare for a nice long shower before Sherlock got home. John opened the door to their bedroom and stopped in the door way, eyes wide and heart completely stopped in his chest.
“You’re alright,” he reassured him, and began unbuttoning John’s shirt until a golden defined chest was exposed. With more care than given to a baby, Sherlock eased the shirt off, careful to not make John move his arm. “There,” he said. At that moment, Sherlock couldn’t help himself. He placed his hand on John’s nape and leaned in to kiss lax moist lips.
When Sherlock left the room with a wink, John smacked his head with his good hand. “You idiot,” he chastised himself for acting so needy. He’d never been this way before, no, John had always prided himself in being the trestle that held everything together. Always the guy you wanted on your side in a fight or when you needed something handled. But now, now he could feel himself crumbling after one touch from Sherlock, could feel himself losing the strength he’d used to hold up his mum and friends. It was as if evolution was taking place in that one spot in time, removing what was no longer needed, like an appendix or tonsil. Now, John’s body was adapting to the new, stronger, support in his world. “Oh God what is happening to me,” he fought as hard as he could to keep the tears in his eyes from shedding, causing them to burn painfully.
“I know,” John cut in quickly. Although he was sure Sherlock already knew everything there was to know about John’s past, he didn’t want Molly think it was okay to talk about it in front of Doms. If something ever happened to him, God forbid, Molly would be on her own and who knows what kind of influences she’d have then. “I do too, love, I do too.” John reached his arm up slowly, rubbing his hand through her hair like he used to do when she had nightmare in the Pipes. He never told anyone, but it helped him fall asleep just as much as it did her.
“I rented the place at the other end of Baker Street, 221 I believe. It’s not as extravagant, but it will do until our estate is rebuilt. Here, I had Anthea buy you some more clothes, as all of yours are smoke stained.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, tapping his finger to his lips. “They have no use for a Sub cured of their RDD.”
“Good morning, Sir,” a woman said. She walked into the kitchen and sat across from John, who now had a goofy grin on his face. The woman was beautiful, with long brown hair and a great figure even with the dress suit she wore.
As he sat in his big comfy chair and drank his tea, John started to close his eyes. It was getting close to dawn and he had had a long fulfilling night. That boy at the pub was quite tasty, and John secretly hoped he would come back again and get smashed. He felt bad for the boy in the alley though.
“Don’t you dare lie to me, Mycroft, not when John is at stake. What happened?” Sherlock actually growled out the words, feeling tremors inside him, a preamble to the earthquakes that threatened just on the fringes of his mind.
The vampire growled deeply, blood dripping down his chin as he strained against the ghost twine. Something primal was triggered in Sherlock, an urge to protect his sire so great he felt his whole body ache with fear and anger. If this human hurt his sire, Sherlock would…
“Sher!” She said, confusing John as he hugged her tightly. To his surprise, when he held her to his chest, she smelled clean and her hands were warm instead of the usual dead cold appendages they all had during the winter.
When they arrived, both Sherlock and Mycroft remained in the car, blocking John in the middle. “What?”
John wracked his brain until his head hurt, but finally he came up with a Watson approved half-baked plan.
“They wanted to take mine, but John stopped them.” Jim stroked the metal collar around his neck, making sure it was still there and nobody had actually taken it.
“No thanks,” John laughed, feeling relaxed and a tad giddy as he batted the hand away, “I’ve got plenty,” he looked down at his soaked trousers. John had lost count of how many shirts had been ripped by Sherlock, how many zippers had been broken, and how many pants had been stained. “You can keep it,” they both laughed at that, but Sherlock took it to heart and began moving his tongue around his own fingers to get every drop.
It was all a dream though. In reality, Sherlock was naked and tied to a chair with his sire standing over him, a sad and disappointed look on his face. It hurt him, somewhere down deep inside, but especially the bite on his neck, to see John look at him that way. The frustration and regret was palpable, like a thick rotting musk from a bog.
She nodded her head, pulling the red cap down over her ears. “Rule number one, don’t make any loud noises. Rule number two, don’t take any electronics ‘cause there might be a…a-“
Finally, the GPS popped up and told John exactly where he needed to go. “Haha! Yes!” John shouted, bouncing a little in his seat in his excitement. One of his master plans finally worked. “It’s about bloody time!”
God, did Sherlock taste just as good on the outside as he did on the inside. Maybe even better! John ran his tongue and hands all over Sherlock’s body, pulling in his canines when he grew closer to the man’s erect cock. He buried his nose in the short dark hairs, sniffing deeply and making Sherlock buck his hips. A dark smile spread across John’s lips, aware that he had Sherlock under his spell.
“And if you feel like crying, then cry and I shall kiss the tears away,” Sherlock whispered, doing exactly what he said he would do and pressing his lips to John’s cheek.
John put his hand over his mouth and closing his eyes, remembering then and there why he stayed with Sherlock, why he let the man brand him, why he panicked when Donovan seemed suspicious. He was the barrier, the oasis, the sun that kept Sherlock occupied and sated so no one else would be taken down into the deep dark hole where the Detective took his prey. John would happily live in that cave when he saw a vision of a small blonde boy sitting in that ambulance with no one to protect him. John would though, he would make sure Sherlock couldn’t sink his teeth into anyone else…he just hoped he wouldn’t be consumed completely before it was all over.
Sherlock placed different smelling ointments and disinfectants on the raw burn, making John hiss in pain. Then, he would stop and stroke down John’s back lovingly, playing with his bullocks or his hole a bit until the pain died down to just a constant ache and start tending to the wound again. Finally, Sherlock had patched him up, peppering kisses around the gauze before he lay back down on the bed, placing a long arm and leg over the boy’s body. “Go back to sleep, we can do the front tomorrow,” Sherlock said, his breath warm on John’s ear.
“Yeah, what do you know?” John said sarcastically, but his eyes had fallen closed and most of his weight was being supported by leaning into Sherlock.
“Then, he drove all the way to the WestQuay to pick me up and then we went to one of the coffee shops, where he bought me a latte and went back to 221B.”
“I’ll need you to sign your statement, John, but other than that you’ve given us all we need. We’ll do our best to find those Subs who blew up your home,” Greg said.
Then a finger made its way into his mouth and pulled Mycroft away from him. He saw the man collapse to the floor in a boneless heap, ready for the taking. Instead of lunging for him though, Sherlock waited a moment to see what his sire would do. Sherlock wanted blood, of course he did, he was a fucking vampire after all, but he was also learning what happened in between feedings.
“Well, as long as my reputation is okay that’s all that matters,” sarcasm laced his voice but Mycroft could tell it was just the man’s coping mechanism.
“One week,” Sherlock said, grabbing the man’s arm before he could hit send. “Just one week and then I’ll let him go.”
“I will, however, win him back. Do you really think this barista stands a chance for John’s heart now that I’m back? Really, Mycroft? No, I will simply go to his flat and wait for him to fall into my arms, like he’s meant to do.”
“I’ll believe that when I see it. You both look like you’re about to collapse on the floor. Here,” Greg said standing up and grabbing Sherlock by the shoulders, “sit down before you hurt yourself.” Sherlock slapped his hand away much like the way John had slapped his when he was toweling off.
“You know I’m gonna beat you right, you really want to challenge the varsity goalie?” John laughed but was soon knocked off balance from his board. Mike had shoved him, then cheered and started pushing to pick up speed towards their destination. “Bastard,” the boy laughed, throwing on his helmet and pushing off hard to catch up to his friend.
John took it slow, but tried to move as fast as possible to get to Sherlock. The traffic lights seemed to take forever, with John tapping his fingers and cursing loudly for them to hurry up. When he arrived at Baker Street, John spotted the house immediately, his heart stopping in his chest.
Sherlock paced back and forth, his hand running spastically through his hair while his teeth gnawed at his lower lip. It wasn’t fair, and not only wasn’t it fair, it was wrong, plain and simple. John couldn’t survive without him, it wasn’t just one of those meaningless sayings boy’s used to get someone in bed, no, this was a scientific fact that his boy had become dependent on him. John was strong of course, that’s why he picked him, but now, Sherlock had whittled away at those sturdy legs, carving them into ornate sculptures of what the boy used to be and now…now there was nothing there to support him.
So this is it, the last chapter for the Strange Desire series. I'm quite sad to see it end, but I think it's best to stop while it's still good and not ruin it like the Saw movies. Anyways, I want to thank everyone for the continuous support and I really appreciate all the kind comments and kudos you've left for the story.
He started with his neck, looking it over for scars from where he was first bitten. It is said the changing bite burns a permanent scar on the vampire’s body, but Sherlock couldn’t find one until he saw the beast’s shoulder. On his right shoulder there was a large white scar that had healed with slightly bubbled up dead tissue. Sherlock ran his hand over it, pressing slightly and was in awe when the vampire actually winced in his drug induced sleep.
Greg stared at him for a long moment, then turned his gaze to John. “He’s hungry. You need to get him something to drink before he drinks you, Sherlock.”
The taller man opened his mouth to say something, then shut it again and nodded his head in honor of John’s request. Sherlock left the room, and John felt both happy and sad about being alone in the room. With all his frustrations built up, John hit the wall with an open hand. The loud smack resonated through the small room, as did the stinging in his palm.
Thanks again to everyone who has either commented or left kudos. They really make my day. Also, I apologize for the evil cliffhanger in advance :(
The blow hurt John’s hand more than it hurt David, causing the teenager to cradle his hand his chest.
“When we get home, you are to go shower and then come down to my study for your punishment,” Mycroft said as he stepped out of the car. The man held his arm, which was supported by a sling, close to his chest. He looked exhausted, but his icy blue eyes continued to stare at John, making the Sub want to tuck his chin against his chest.
Sherlock's POV. A fellow hunter comes for a visit. It doesn't go as well as Sherlock would've hoped.
John twisted his hands together. Okay, now he was really nervous when he saw Sherlock sit down in a chair that wasn’t facing Mycroft, but John.
“Make him shock me? You’re kidding right?” John took a step back, hitting the door with his back. Sherlock looked up from testing the water with a disapproving look.
“I’m trying to apologize you…frustrating child,” Mycroft actually stuttered. John knew he’d really struck a nerve, which oddly enough didn’t give him the satisfaction he was hoping for. Perhaps it was the fact that Mycroft actually seemed to show a normal range of emotion, or that the collar had messed up his rational mind, but John wanted to forgive the man.
All through the afternoon, they were in different lessons. Sherlock was in Chemistry and John in Biology. Nevertheless, both of them were sat at their desks, fretting and pondering over the same things- whether Felix was alright, and wondering what he was doing, and just generally thinking about him. Sherlock had never expected this much of his mind to be preoccupied with the child. He had never foreseen how many involuntary worries he would be feeling for the child's safety, once he knew he wasn't in John's or his own care. Even when he tried to concentrate on the chemistry work, his mind wandered away. Always back to Felix. Once the bell for the end of the school day had rung, and their lessons were over, John and Sherlock both rushed out and towards Molly's dorm room, eager to see Felix again. Even after only being apart for a couple of hours, it was the first time since they had 'got' him that neither was with him, and the two long hours felt more like two weeks to the pair.
As they neared the buildings, they realised they needed some sort of plan to get Felix into the school without being seen.
"Yeah, they are designed for babies." He looked at Sherlock's raised eyebrows and sighed, knowing full well that none of these little farmyard sets or Noah's arks were going to be gracing their flat any time soon. He huffed, and took one last glance at the aisle, as Sherlock threw his elephant into the corner of a shelf, where it made a loud clattering noise, over the gentle shop music.
"Cute?!" Sherlock exclaimed, picking up a brightly coloured, plastic elephant with hauntingly large eyes. "What purpose do these toys serve? Are they...educational?" He scorned, holding it with the tips of his fingers and away from himself.
His face lit up, like a child on christmas morning, and he darted off to the sofa, swiftly moving items off it.
"Well I can hardly let Mycroft win can I?" He opened his eyes and let out a short laugh at John's face of disbelief. He continued, half fearing some sort of attack from John if he didn't.
Merry Christmas for Thursday! :D and please comment if you liked it! Or want to see anything in the story and i shall do my best :) i love to hear what you think! :) thankyou!!
This mantra kept on through his head, again and again as he swiftly made his way to the only possible back entrance to the club where the group could have snuck in.
Please please comment if you enjoy it or if you dont! I want to hear what everybody thinks! Thankyou!!! :) xxx
“Mycroft will sort it. He knows how to change these things. We will both be the chil- Felix’s parents, and his legal guardians.”
John relaxed, absolutely loving Harry for breaking up the awkward dinner they had been about to endure.
He also felt sure now, upon deciding, that this was the right name. Sherlock was happy too, John thought, glancing at him standing next to him. He somehow had got his own way, with the child being named after two composers. John thought that the matter of the surname was strange, he felt that it was bizarre them putting down a double barrelled name, which is usually a mix of the two parents... but somehow it felt and sounded right despite their odd situation.
His friends had been doing a pretty good job so far of distracting him, Greg had been pulling out some very interesting and unusual dance moves on the dance floor, much to the hilarity of the group. John guessed he was doing it badly on purpose due to Greg winking over at him, however it was funny, all the same, and being part of this group was helping push away the nagging and persistent strange emotions he had been feeling lately.
All the group surrounded them in a circle, the music loud and heavy enough that there was no point in even attempting conversation. John looked around to the raucous bar area, craving the taste of another cold beer, as with each one he had he was slowly getting further from the stresses of Sherlock, and he was starting to even find he was enjoying himself, in spite of the earlier fight they had had. Although something still lingered, a sense of something, he didn't know what it was. His fuzzy mind couldn't understand it, a sort of want for something? He brushed it aside, blaming it on his cravings for another beer, not thinking it could be anything else.
"No! No don't worry it's fine! I will find my dorm and come over to yours when I have dumped my stuff..."
"Well why do I have to listen to you! I didn't cancel on my friends to sit here and listen to you saying this sort of-"
By the time John had looked over to the group and then back to where Sherlock had been standing, he was gone, leaving nothing but the orange glow of the streetlamps radiating out onto the pavement.
Once they pulled up at the small station, John pulled Sherlock off the train where he stood looking around him, blinking in the bright light which was seemingly harsh on his eyes due to him having just awoken. As the train pulled away, they were left on the small and empty platform. They had chosen to come on a train much earlier than the ones which people from their school usually get to transport themselves to school, as a precaution against anyone they might know seeing them with Felix. Sherlock looked around him in bewilderment and then got on a bench and looked around again.
Just to say: The piece of music mentioned at the end I absolutely love! this is the version I listened to whilst writing this chapter (Just ignore the piano ;) ) and the violin is how I imagined it being played in the story :)
He sat on the tube, which was reasonably empty on this line, although would get less so once he changed onto the Victoria Line in a couple of moments. Getting slightly hot, he took off his jacket where he was wearing a short sleeved shirt underneath, he looked down at his arms in horror. He had forgotten he had put the fake tan on his arms as well, and it was streaked in a patchy mess across his forearms. John hurriedly put his jacket back on and cursed himself for being so stupid to think he could just stick fake tan on and look like he had a real tan. Why had he listened to Sherlock? He suddenly realised that he would not be able to take his jacket off for the rest of the afternoon, which made him groan and regret the fake tan even more. He only thanked his luck that he had got on a dark shirt and jacket and so if it rubbed off, it at least wouldn't be visible on his clothes.
John left the room, and went into the living room and picked up Felix from his cot, and put him playing with his building blocks he had on the floor. He was irritated with Sherlock, he had threatened him with something Sherlock knew that John couldn't compete with. His parents. They thought he had been spending the summer at a Holiday Adventure Camp, which would go towards his DofE award, which in truth, he wasn't even getting!
"Well I am at a loss! I have no idea how we can manage to take our A-levels, with us also taking care of a child! I mean what are we going to do? We can't actually take him to school and just leave him in our dorm room Sherlock!"
Molly came over 10 minutes later, and sat patiently whilst Sherlock explained his idea for the present and all the process to buying it before producing it with a flourish from his pillow, whilst Felix was facing the other direction. Molly held the box in amazement, incredulous that Sherlock of all people could come up with such a perfect gift for the occasion. She looked at Sherlock's expression which was one of uncertainty, one she's never seen on his face before, and didn't know he was capable of.
The next morning, John came to outside Sherlock's bedroom with a cup of tea, feeling dubious to whether or not Sherlock would have sorted the 'nanny problem' by now, or whether he had more likely been distracted by some murder in the news or something of the like. John was hoping that he didn't have to worry about the whole situation any longer, although assumed that he would find that he did. He knocked on Sherlock's door. When there was no answer he went inside.
"Ssh Sherlock!" He complained quietly, embarrassed by his friend. "Okay fine, we will find something different."
"Well, yeah he does, but um, no relation unbelievably!" John quipped, grinning at Molly's reaction to Felix.
As they walked over a small hill, John could see the school building just encroaching into their sight, and once they had crossed over the small stream, via the precarious wooden bridge which lay over it, they ended up on the far side of the school grounds.
"Yes, Dad, okay." He paused, looking towards Harry who he could see was trying to stifle a laugh whilst half watching the TV. "Mum. Um, I've got to go now."
"Yes. Of course I can. I'm not an idiot!" Sherlock retorted, continuing to glare at Mycroft, who half closed his eyes, let out a big sigh, and then turned to John.
I arrived at the door to the library, but  deciding I didn't want to work I walked out into the gardens, loving the feeling of the warm setting sun on my face. I needed to think straight. That's one thing my soldier of a father had taught me. To be able to stop and put the facts in order. A skill at that moment I was highly glad to possess.
"Did you find out?" John looked up from his schoolbook he was studying, and which Felix was craning over to look at the pictures in.
"You come from a seriously different world to me." John exclaimed marvelling at how normal Sherlock seemed to believe the idea was."
Finally, he started to crawl towards Sherlock, but on coming to the first obstacle, a shoe of Sherlock's, instead of going around it, he picked it up and threw it, and then continued. Sherlock, with all the expressions of an overly proud parent, enthusiastically encouraged him to continue.
John picked up a toy from where it had somehow made it's way into his bed. He sighed and placed it on the floor in the area where Felix seemed to enjoy playing in. He looked down into the cot which was shoved between the two beds. They had shifted them as far to the sides as they could go, and after taking out the nightstands they had been able to squeeze the cot between them. Felix was lying in it on his back, his arms slowly flailing in the air although he was fast asleep.
"Of course you would have to live here in the holidays and we would have to have the same dorm room this year, but you barely leave here anyway, it's just a matter of getting you ke- oh- yeah, you already have keys."
She got up to leave, going to kiss Felix on the head as she went, who reached his arms out to her for a hug, so she picked him up into a big bear hug, making him giggle, before putting him down on the floor. As she got to the door, in her head she queried why it was this particular month that Sherlock was giving a gift to Felix.
Sherlock opened his eyes and clocked two or maybe three Johns standing in front of him, he lurched to his feet, the room spinning around him.
"Marie Curie was slacking in her protection against radiation poisoning, incompetent woman, which lead to her extremely preventable death. She would not get within a mile of Felix!"
They carried on walking, and it's not that the people stopped staring, on the contrary, but at every disapproving face John just looked at Sherlock and at Felix, and as they made their way through the people, he started to slowly not care whether anyone else didn’t like it. Or what they might be thinking. He didn't want to make them happy. It was none of their business. He was was happy. That was all that mattered.
"Well what about if they don't? I don't know any nurseries near our school do you? Sherlock it's in the middle of nowhere!" John was getting himself into a state and so took in a deep breath to calm himself before continuing. "What other options are there?" He slowly asked, holding his head in his hands.
They had been chasing a man down the streets of London and John had managed to lose track of Sherlock. He was trying not to panic as he walked back home, knowing that he would be informed of everything later. When he was, he discovered that Sherlock had managed to commandeer a taxi cab, (despite being too young to drive, let alone drive a taxi!) and driven it manically around until he managed to “skillfully” (Sherlock’s description) run the man over, with the skillful part being that it only knocked the man out. This was NOT going to be happening again John thought, as he kept his eye on Sherlock as he moved away.
"You do!" Sherlock blurted quickly. "Of course you do! You are very... Very clever John! I mean..." He trailed off, regretting his sudden, uncharacteristic outburst. John moved on, trying to relieve the awkward air that suddenly surrounded them.
“I really would rather not. Anyway, Sherlock just doesn’t do swimming and Felix can’t swim either and we might be seen from school by someone an-“
"Well I wasn't entirely truthful... I haven't been at a camp for the summer. I've been um, staying with a friend-"
Sherlock's face dropped. I realised I'd been slightly too harsh on him. I didn't want to fall out over something so trivial.
"Hello! Come in!" John sang cheerfully, suddenly nervous as to what Molly would make of the whole situation.
"Yes." Sherlock said, trying to move away from the boy and pulling in the bundle closer to his chest, which Oliver noticed and thought it was rather strange.
“Judging? What do you mean?” He asked not understanding, and looking around at the faceless crowds in the shopping centre.
She ran across the room to her bag. After rummaging around for a couple of seconds, she returned holding a fistful of tickets.
"Sherlock." He lifted his head up to face him again, and found that Sherlock was staring back. His ice blue orbs reflecting back at John his own pain. "It didn't mean anything... She kissed me." John found himself saying, not understanding quite why he felt the need to justify the previous action. Sherlock merely stared back, and John no longer being able to take the look in his friend's eyes, looked anywhere but into them.
The star of the hockey team seemed pleased that John had come with him, and started making conversation on the way up.
"Wha-? Of course I wan-" I started angrily before repeating in my head my mantra, -'Don't react. He only wants a reaction.' Taking in a breath I carried on calmer.
He stood just staring at his hand, his independent hand, which had wanted to be placed where it now sat.
"Good. Confidence. Girls want someone confident, they want you to ask them. I expect to meet this girl next time I see you."
"I'm Cecilia Ophelia Rosalind Brown" She announced, "My parents were sorta into Shakespeare"  She said smiling at Felix and tickling him some more. "Can I come with Felix to the next house?" She suddenly interjected, bouncing up and down with excitement.
"Fine. Get one suit if you really must... one!" Sherlock looked over to him in triumph, a his lips hinting at a smug smile. John continued sighing,
“Well yes. I can believe it. He is clearly an advanced child for his age and it was inevitable that he would be able to identify the two most important people in his life before long.”
Sherlock started striding towards the park’s exit and towards his flat, John followed behind holding the baby. Sherlock dialed in a number as they walked.
“Sher- oh for god’s sake you are useless!” John sighed, and started to put the items strewed around back into the bags.
He looked at Felix for a split second contemplating what he was going to do before picking him up and bundling him up in his long grey coat. Although fairly well covered, Felix was by no means hidden and so Sherlock was relying on moving fast as not to be caught.
Thankyou yet again for your splendid an amazing comments! I love the fact people are reading my writing! It fills me with such inexorable joy! And I adore to hear what you guys think so I really really do appreciate all your comments! :) Been away for a while so I do apologise for the slight delay in updating! But anyway, here it is! Enjoyyyyy! :)
There was another where Sherlock had obviously not realised he was taking and was a sideways shot of the edge of his face, and from the look on it, John could tell that he was obviously getting very frustrated with the camera's many variety of buttons. There were several of Sherlock alone, which John had insisted on taking as he had declared that they can't all be of him, and had managed to take a few of Sherlock looking very moodily at him into the camera, with his eyebrows raised in half distain, which made John laugh when looking back through them.
Once they finally got to the shopping centre, as they walked through the main square, John started to notice that people were staring at them. They had come a fairly quiet route to get to the centre, and there hadn’t been many people who paid attention to them on the street, but here... Everyone did.
'I-I thought it would be nice... I missed the 6 months, which according to the internet, is the bigger month, which is absurd as its just because it is half of a year."
"Here i'll take that" He said, going to take the bucket from John's hand. His fingers brushed John's and sent a thrill up his spine, like electricity as they touched, John clearly felt it too and looked up at Sherlock, his eye's wide and questioning. Uncertain as to everything.
"Sherlock has a child." She tried to stop herself from laughing by putting her hand up to her already smiling mouth.
"Oh, yeah that would be great! Sounds fun." John said smiling and grabbing his keys from the stand by the door, following Greg out, and closing the door firmly behind him, without even a glance behind him.
Sherlock started to pace up and down beside one of the lab benches, his hands pressed to his head and his face screwed up in frustration and uncertainty as to what to do. Molly noted his behaviour, and putting Felix down, she got up and went over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder, he too wrapped up in his own thoughts to notice her.
John’s face dropped as he stared in shock at this little boy. Sherlock too had been stopped in his tracks by the first word his son had ever said. The corner of John’s mouth was the first part of his face to change from shock into absolute glee. His eyebrows then followed and twitched into a lifted position. His eyes then filled with tears, he was that happy. He didn't think he'd ever cried from happiness before, but John had a feeling that this would not be the last time he did so in this journey they were going on with this dear little boy who was theirs and all theirs.
“No,” he almost shouted, not wanting to give Jim the slightest window of opportunity to plant something in John’s head, like he’d done to Victor all those years ago.
John actually moaned in pleasure as Sherlock kneaded his back; the tight knots and deep aches proof of sleeping in a pipe for years. Every time Sherlock worked a tough spot, especially at the base of the teen’s skull, the pain would become less and less until John felt nothing but the tingly warmth from the blood flow increasing under his skin. John had no idea fingers could do this to someone but as he continued to drool and murmur nonsense, the Sub was thankful for the small bit of relief. “Shhh,” a voice said to him, coming from the edges of darkness where John now floated. “Can you hear me John?”
“The others will be taken and collared. We can use them as a test group and bring them to the expo.”
“Such a strong boy,” Sherlock cooed in his ear, warming him from the inside out because the same way John never lied to Sherlock, he knew Sherlock never lied to him either. “Let’s get you on the couch so you can play on the laptop, like promised. I’m going to work on a few experiments in the kitchen then I’ll make us lunch. How does that sound?”
John opened his mouth, keeping his threatening gaze on the Dom as the bar of soap was inserted all the way until the edges were braced just past his molars while the other end was sitting on his lips.
“John’s not,” Sherlock said, though John didn’t know why that was important. He was feeling quite warm now, and honestly, all he wanted to do was close his eyes and curl up next to Sherlock. “Don’t close your eyes, do you understand me John?”
“Mr. Holmes said you liked a little milk in your tea,” Devon said, bending down to talk to John. “Is that correct? Or shall I get you a fresh cup?”
With that, John ran back into the house, his lungs feeling the burn just before the dopamine took over. “He’s upstairs!” he heard Greg shout from outside. Without thinking, John ran upstairs to find a completely different battlefield than downstairs.
He could hear Sherlock laugh through the curtain, but he didn’t care. John stood at the back of the shower and peeled off his clothes, throwing them carelessly onto the bathroom floor and secretly hoping Sherlock would slip and fall on them. That’s when it hit him…
“Yes it is, John,” she said, no doubt answering that same question every time she recruited someone. “Now, your first mission-”
While John was distracted by Sherlock’s scent, Sherlock had pressed his thumb just behind his ear and jaw bone. “Ah, so pressure points do work on you, interesting,” Sherlock said, removing his finger.
“It’s alright, Greg, he’s secure and plus, John won’t hurt us,” Sherlock said, a hint of pride in his voice.
Mycroft’s eyes fluttered open, though a glaze still remained. He grabbed Greg’s hand that was caressing his cheek. “Don’t let them…Sherlock…Please, Greg,” Mycroft said, showing more emotion than Greg had seen in the seven years he’d known the man. Greg didn’t understand Mycroft’s loyalty to his little brother, but then again, he himself was an only child whose parents died when he was sixteen. The hunter knew nothing of attachment and loyalty until Mycroft recruited him for the League. Until then though, Greg was just a punk who didn’t give a shit about anyone but himself.
Slowly but surely, John’s stomach muscles began to tighten under Sherlock’s hands. It wasn’t long after that, that John gave a cry of pleasure and Sherlock’s mouth was filled with his seed. He drank it up greedily, as if this was the only oasis for a thousand kilometers. It was something only Sherlock was allowed to do, no one would ever touch John again, let alone get to drink from him. John was his now, his.
He sniffed deeply, then turned his attention to the door on his left. His senses told him there was one man in there alone, ready for the taking. As silently as he could, which surprisingly, was quite discreet, he opened the door and stepped inside. A wave of animalistic urges washed over him. He could feel his toes curl in excitement and his legs bend to adopt an aggressive stance.
John sat up, “no, I brought some. I’ll go change,” he stood up and walked slowly towards the hall. When the air hit the wet spots on his clothes it seemed to start a chain reaction of coldness shooting through his body. Now he wanted the warmness Sherlock had to offer.
“Good, because now that I have you, I won’t let anything, not even my brother, take you away.” He said, a fierceness in his eyes that John had never seen before. He thought Sherlock was okay, he never really hurt John, but the man still held him captive. And there was something wrong with a man who said ‘because now that I have you, I won’t let anything take you away.’
John turned his head, feeling the cold water splash against his already frozen neck. He saw Sherlock and Greg leaning over the edge with their hands close to the water, motioning for John to swim closer. “Come on, lad, swim to us,” Greg said, blasting his bliss a million kilometers an hour towards John. Whether the cold or the amounts of adrenaline running through his veins, John didn’t feel anything compelling him to follow the order. “You can do it, John,” the older Dom praised as John forced his legs to paddle them closer.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped through the ground and straight into hell when he saw the gun so close to his John’s head. This was going downhill quickly and Sherlock was losing control as every second passed by. “Alright, alright, just calm down Sebby,” Sherlock made his pitch higher, trying to trigger something in the man’s subconscious.
Again, Sherlock rolled his eyes, in awe of how primal normal peoples’ brains were. “Will you just promise you won’t tell anyone and follow me?”
“Do you think Teddy will be okay?” he heard Molly ask and with that kind of question, John couldn’t help himself. His curiosity got the better of him and the teenager peeked around the corner to see Molly sitting on the floor, using a needle and thread to mend the stuffing sticking out from her bear while a tall man, most likely in his early twenties, watched her with a smile on his face.
Bliss exploded through his veins like a nuclear bomb. It blinded him for a moment as heat permeated throughout his skin and deep into the marrow of his bones. It felt amazing. It felt like defeat.
Mycroft opened the door to let Greg inside, then closed it. Greg had a large Styrofoam box in his hand and a grim look on his face. As soon as the man stepped into the room, Sherlock smelled the blood inside the box and began to growl. There was so much, so, so, much and it was all right there for him and his sire.
“Here is the key to the restraints,” the Dom handed one of the Doctors standing next to him a key. The man was taller than both Mycroft and Sherlock, but had much less hair and his face was gaunt. Over all, the Dom had an eerie feeling to him and John was definitely not looking forward to being in a room alone with the man.
Hello again everybody! Well, you can all than my hubby for getting sick because we were planning on going out so I wouldn't be able to write this chapter until Monday. Now, however, we're both at home and he's throwing up and I'm drinking beer writing this fic. LOL.
Without wasting any more time, John circled around to the back of the tallest building on the street. Spotting a ladder, he quickly scaled it to find five makeshift tents and empty food cans strewn out across the roof.
Sherlock sat in the car, ignoring the trivial chattering between Lestrade and his brother. All Sherlock cared about right now, and all anyone should care about, was getting John back where he belonged. His hands felt cold without warm blonde hair to run them through or a soft neck to caress. It just wasn’t right how much this simple Sub made him feel so uneasy when John was gone. It just wasn’t right!
“You broke two ribs and your ankle was burned quite severely, John. I would say that is not ‘okay.’”
“You’re me!” his voice said from below. Moriarty had morphed into what Sherlock had feared most from the moment he’d met John…himself. “You’re not on the side of the angels, Sherlock.”
“It’s okay, Jim,” John whispered in his ear as they were led into a brick building. “They’re Subs too.” Jim calmed a little at that. The darker haired boy had been found naked behind a rubbish bin, so John could only imagine how much fear Jim had for Doms.
“Thank you,” John said, breathing a little easier now. He could understand why Jim wanted to go back. Hell, John wanted to go back. It was so much easier to let Sherlock take care of him and all the big decisions.
“No!” John’s head shot up immediately, ready to beg for Sherlock not to torture him like he did with the cock ring. It did feel good at the end, the final explosion when Sherlock removed the piece of silicone, but the wait was so infuriating. However, he was learning, at least that’s what Sherlock had told him, because they had done it enough times for John to finally realize all he had to do was lie back and trust his lover to take care of him, which he always did.
Hello and welcome to one of the most depressing chapters I've ever written. Please check the tags for updated warnings because John has, for the lack of a better term, cracked and gone into a deep depression.
The tension hung thick in the air. This was only the second time John had seen Sherlock nervous, the first being when John and Mycroft almost drowned in the Thames. It pulled at something deep down inside of John, something that told him to lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder to comfort him. The teenager wasn’t going to do it, or at least that’s what he’d planned. Now though, his head was resting gently on Sherlock’s shoulder, and his body was pressed up against the Dom’s side.
Thank you again to everyone who left comments or kudos. It still seems surreal at how many people are reading and enjoying this fic.
“Come on,” the red headed man said. He helped John stand up and follow Jim out the back of the van. The younger Sub looked terrified out of his mind and continued to wring his hands together nervously.
“That’s very simple,” she said, pulling a file out of her brown leather bag. She flipped it open and began flipping through the contents. “John Hamish Watson, Sub of Mycroft Holmes, sixteen years two months and twenty-two days old, brother of one Harriet Jane Watson, son of both James and Marie Watson, 5’4, 102lb, blue eyes, blonde hair, birthmark on left upper thigh, favorite food-”
An hour later he was sitting at his desk, two fingers of Rye in his crystal tumbler, watching Greg swirl his glass around, staring intently at the ice chips. “So, are you going to tell me what is wrong with Sherlock? Is it cocaine again because I’ve been keeping him away from the drug dealer cases,” the man defended, knowing Mycroft had placed much responsibility on his head when it came to Sherlock.
The boy sighed and chewed on his lip, mulling over the two options that would determine the rest of his life. Starting over would be amazing, hell, who didn’t want to start over and fix all the things they did wrong. He would, however, still see the beautifully carved ‘SH’ and the bullet wound on both his shoulder’s every morning and night in the mirror. He would still feel Sherlock pressing up against him the shower. He would still feel Sherlock inside him and all around him. He would still hear the hearty baritone in his ears even though Sherlock was nowhere to be found. John would always be Sherlock’s, but the only question was, would he accept it?
“That’s all I need,” Sherlock said, releasing John’s finger. The vampire licked the pad, tasting his own bland blood.
After the initial panic wore off, John stilled a moment to assess what was actually happening. Burning flesh, that’s what it was, burning flesh permeated the bedroom as John lay struggling and helpless under an unmovable mass.
Tingles spread through his skin, dulling the constant ache in his skull, and even bringing a smile to his face.
It didn’t seem too long before Molly woke up and strangely felt wide awake. She shifted her feet to the side of the bed and hopped down. Keeping Leopold in hand, Molly opened her bedroom door and headed downstairs to get a glass of milk.
“Johnny!” a familiar voice ran through what looked to be a police station, or at least according to the crime dramas on the telly he watched with Sherlock. Those were some of his favorite, even though Sherlock would yell out the clues and who the killer was in the first ten minutes of the movie.
“She…she,” John thought back to his meeting with the strange woman and realized that Sherlock was right, she didn’t offer him anything.

It was nine o’clock at night by the time Sherlock made it to John’s temporary residence. He stood outside, his breath sending up clouds of fog as he made his way into the flat, easily picking the lock. When he entered, the noises he heard confused the detective until he crept closer to the source. There was a rhythmic banging matching perfectly with grunts and moans. At first, Sherlock convinced himself John was only wanking and he got the most wonderful romantic idea that he would show up and finish the job for him. John would call out his name as he came, his deeper voice would be placed on another gramophone in the study as it moaned ‘Sherlock’ over and over again.
Mycroft tugged the lead once more, motioning for John to stand up, but the Sub only turned his head slightly to look in the other direction. John knew it was a token rebellion, but when you’re sitting on the floor with a muzzle, arm restraints, and a lead, it was worth it to torment the Dom. “Up,” he said, his voice stern but not commanding. Five seconds later, John was shaking on the ground again, the pain hitting every muscle in his body before it stopped at his feet.
“What took you so long?” The deep voice was right behind him, making John squeak and turn around quickly. John gripped his towel tighter when he saw his clothes in Sherlock’s hand.
“I meant every word I ever said to you. Let me show you how much I care for you, how much I love you John. Please, let me make it up to you for being a stupid git, I misjudged how mature your were and I…well I was just so scared of losing you.” Sherlock brought the small tan hand up to his lips and kissed the soft knuckles, watching in pleasure at how the boy’s cheeks turned pink.
“This collar is the way to a peaceful revolution, not giving false hope to Subs and angering Doms in the process.”
“Okay, that’s good right there,” John said, when Sherlock’s teeth were mere centimeters from Greg’s neck. “Sherlock,” John said, keeping one arms wrapped around his vampire and using the other to tilt his head back. “Let his scent fill you, but don’t let it control you. You are in control here, not the blood, not the scents, you.”
“Watch your tone, boy,” Mycroft told him, narrowing his eyes. John subconsciously moved sideways, farther into Sherlock’s side.
Jim felt tears prick at the corner of his eyes from the flood of emotion filling him. He had never been hugged like that before, hugged like he was the only thing that mattered at that single moment. Quickly reining his emotions back in, Jim followed Greg outside and into the car.
Hello once again everyone! I know I say this every time but I really do appreciate all the support, comments, and kudos you guys have left for this fic. I'm not one of those writers who can just write for themselves or just write for the sake of art. I love hearing what y'all have to say and all the different opinions and POVs. Sorry, enough with the ooey gooey fluffy stuff. On to Dark!Sherlock, although this chapter is a bit fluffier than most because as you can tell, I'm in a very sentimental mood right now(:
John knew surprise was on his side, so he took a deep breath and then slowly began to lick along the detective’s lower spine. “J-John? I’m tired I really don’t…oh!” His protests were cut off when he felt teeth clamp down on his left arse cheek.
“Hey, Mike,” was all he said and then the other boy turned around to face the front of the class. As the professor gave his lecture, he glanced at John every once and a while, a small smile and his brow pulled together in the most condescending look he’d received yet.
“I know,” Sherlock smiled and in one smooth motion flipped John over and pulled him up to support himself on all fours. The boy only shuffled for a moment, but to Sherlock’s pleasure, stayed exactly where he was supposed to. It was happening, just like it had done when John was fourteen, his mind was shifting. Sherlock smiled at this and immediately thrust two fingers into John’s hole.
“Hey,” John waved to his friend, giving a wide smile as a feeling of home and friendship washed over him. It was wiped away however, when Jim asked about Molly.
Until Sherlock opened his wide in understanding. “Oh, yes, of course,” he said and turned around like he did the first day John took a bath.
“Oh, then, uhh…boyfriend? ‘Cause that’s fine, I mean, it’s all fine.” John said before a shoving a huge bite of beans in his mouth.
“But Molly is in there too, Jim, we can’t just set the house on fire. Are you mad?!” Mike exclaimed, panic in his voice.
The boy was brought out of his internal musings by a sharp noise and then a slight burn on his thigh. “Stop it John, stop it this instant,” Sherlock’s voice was stern, leaving no room to argue his way out of what was so obviously going on in his head.
The man complied, but kept his hand tucked tightly against him. Finally, after about a minute of staring into those silver orbs, John found what he was looking for and pressed against it. Sherlock’s eyes began to grow heavy and then closed, letting his hand drop into his lap. John picked it up quickly, and licked a long strip, making sure his saliva got into the wound.
“I know,” John said, playing with the curls on Sherlock’s forehead. “That’s why Greg is coming today.”
“No, if we set someone’s house on fire while they’re asleep they could die before they even know what happened,” John told him, not willing to budge on his decision. He hated those rich bastards but they didn’t deserve to die because of they were being used as a distraction.
“John, you must realize that this is going to help you. If you misbehave in front of all those people, I will be forced to punish you. This way,” he motioned to the brown leather hanging from Sherlock’s hands, “we won’t have to worry about that.”
“Well it wouldn’t be the first time something like that happened.” Greg shoved past Sherlock, examining the area. His head shot up to the second floor when he heard a loud clang, like something had dropped to the floor and continued to roll around. “Who’s up there?” Greg asked, turning around to face Sherlock with a cheeky grin on his face. “A girl? Oh no, that’s right, Mycroft said you were into boys.” The man wagged an eyebrow, showing he approved.
“I’ve never seen a Sub that greatly effected before,” Sherlock said, pulling out his mobile to type something in. “I’ll check with security to see how much they are pumping through entrances of the building.”
The room was completely white, with a white bed in the center. John was strapped down by all four limbs, and lay calmly, looking at Greg standing in the corner. “What did you do to my brother?” Mycroft asked, walking over to loom above the vampire.
As expected, the pain was instant, hell, John didn’t even realize Mycroft had the remote in his hand until the teenager was on his knees and clutching at his neck reflexively. If he didn’t know any better, John would have sworn the pain lasted longer this time than the last but it was hard to count accurately when it felt like every nerve in his body was on fire.
“No, I’m afraid that would be quite fatal. A vampire is a vampire, family or not.” Mycroft rubbed his hand over his face.
“I will be providing sexual stimulation in order to form the relationship between pleasure and patience. When Sherlock starts to drink, I will stop. When you pull away, I continue pleasuring him until I say we are done.”
John thought he was going to have an ally in Jim. Someone who shared his same fighting spirit for what was right.
Once they were back home, John set about printing the pictures they had taken, and he started to have fun going through them all on the computer, as not all of the photos were ones he would be showing his parents! He found some of him and Felix which Sherlock had insisted 'the light was perfect' for taking, and John had to admit he was right, it looked a very pretty, pale yellow and was streaming through the trees onto their faces, and Felix looked so small and cute in John's arms that it made up for the (again) wonky angle.
Harry’s discordant singing woke John with a start. He had been in a pleasant enough slumber where in his dream he had found himself as a bear and he was just sitting having a cup of tea with another bear when he had been so rudely awoken. Although thinking about it, the blow was softened by the fact he knew Harry meant well. However, it was his Birthday, a day he detested and he wanted no fuss made and he knew that this was merely the beginning of a whole heap of fuss.
John glared in distain at Sherlock and then sighed again, and looked at the baby assuring himself that he was alright, the baby was very content with just chewing on the cushion. So John picked up his laptop and sat down his his chair, keeping half an eye on the surprisingly well behaved baby.
"Yes. He is. My friend." John confirmed, smiling. I'll text you then." He said, and after one last hug, he left.
At half time the score was 7:5, with their school winning on account of John and Greg's playing boosting up their score massively. Sherlock looked over to John, who was standing by himself, fiddling with his gum-shield on the edge of the pitch, he got up to go talk to him before he spotted Greg and a couple of other players going over to talk to him instead. Sherlock thought better of interrupting that, and sat down, feeling a weird jealousy wash over him. He tried to shake it off as he watched them laughing and joking about and clapping John on the shoulder. He felt such an urge to rush over there and rip their hands off his shoulders and move them all away from John. He felt angry about the fact they were even standing near to him. His John. He was his friend, they shouldn't be allowed to make him laugh like that.
"Sherlock. It's, it's just beautiful. It's perfect." She replied, watching his face light up with an slightly bashful smile.
"Look, calm down." John reassured, walking over and handing him the cup of tea, which Sherlock took gladly from him, cradling it in both hands. "You just need to think about it. Have you rung all the people from the agencies?"
"You have to bring home an imaginary girl?" Sherlock said, the corner of his mouth now toying with a smile.
John picked up his slightly unnecessary water bottle from the side of the court, and started to amble up to the changing rooms along with all the other guys, feeling desperate for some sort of physical activity, after the lack of running he had just been doing during the game. He looked over his shoulder out to the field and the running track longingly, hoping that he might spot some small group out there, bearing the weather, but no luck. Nobody wanted to be out running in this grey and drizzly autumnal time. John sighed and took a sip of water and carried on walking to the changing rooms.
"What? It's nice! Don't you think?" John asked, observing Sherlock's air of distaste written over his face.
“John? Wha- What’s wrong?” He looked suddenly concerned, and stopped John from walking forwards any further, by stepping in front of the pram.
Sherlock smirked slightly and outstretched his legs, crossing one over the other and just continued to watch Felix playing.
"A family. We look like a family." Sherlock whispered, raising his head to look at John, who could see that his bright blue eyes were shining with happiness.
Hello again! Hope that the people still reading this story enjoy the update :) As always, comment to tell me what you think! It really brings me joy to hear what you guys think! Love you all! xxxx
"So, one of us needs to go collect the dorm key from matron." John stated, knowing they would be in the same dorm from sending the school their pairs request email during the holidays, confirming the shared dorm.
Sherlock followed him dutifully out of the station and onto the little country road which stretched before them into the distance.
There was a knock at their door, interrupting John. Both of their heads snapped up, looking towards the sound. John looked over to Sherlock with panic clearly written across his face. He started mouthing indistinguishable words and gestured silently and frantically toward Felix and then to Sherlock and the bathroom. Sherlock quickly but calmly picked up the child and hurried inside shutting the door behind him.
Sherlock sat on the floor with his long legs crossed, waiting for John to return. He had been building an assault course for Felix to crawl through, created from their bags and stray items from around the room. Felix had just been placed at the starting line, and Sherlock sat towards the end with his arms outstretched, attempting to get Felix to come to him. Felix only burbled, and laughed at Sherlock's flailing arm gestures towards himself, and grinning towards Felix.
"Stultiloquence... Idiocy, foolishness, nonsense." Sherlock ranted, turning the pages of the book furiously with distain.
Sherlock put Felix down on the rug, in front of the sofa, and wandered over to the two beds and stood between them, looking from one to the other, before going and sitting on the one on the far right, by the window and against the outside wall.
"I should probably go now" She said sadly, scuffing her shoe against a curb. "Bye Felix! Bye bye Felix's Daddies!" She gave a wave and then skipped around the corner getting lost in the dark within seconds.
"John. What is going on? You are behaving really strangely." She asked, narrowing her eyes at his dithering and strange facial expression.
“Come on Fee, lets go out.” He said, suddenly excited at the prospect of being able to go out with the child for the first time. Mycroft had delivered around a very expensive looking pram that morning, which meant it would be easy to take him out for a walk now.
An hour later, Molly climbed up the steps to the flat and was met at the top by John, whose mouth was straining into an awkward smile.
"Hey" John said briefly whilst looking up quickly from his phone before dropping his head back down again.
Suddenly thinking of what Sherlock might be doing, as it was very quiet, he hurried into the living room with the bottle.
After a very short time Sherlock had sobered up entirely, all the alcohol now being out of his body. John had cleaned up his sick from the floor, despite Sherlock's protestations, who had been ordered to remain huddled in the blanket on the sofa. Once John was done and sat back down he heard Sherlock murmur under his breath.
John pushed the door open to his dorm and went inside, Sherlock was sitting with Felix on the sofa, where he was reading him a large book which looked suspiciously like a medical school textbook, with detailed anatomy drawings and labelled pictures of injuries and wounds. Obviously the perfect bedtime story for a baby.
There was a small girl, wearing a cat costume sitting on a front wall of a house they went up to. She waved at the three of them and leapt down.
Although to be fair to them, Sherlock did look rather peculiar, he is tall for his age anyway, and currently wearing a dramatic long black coat with his dark curls falling around his head like a wild disheveled birds nest. What made it worse was he was on the floor on his front looking at a patch of grass by the edge of the swings through his magnifying glass, and John was sure that in the mothers minds this was Sherlock ‘ready to pounce’ on their unsuspecting children.
"John?" I heard him say. His voice shocked me still, rooting me to the ground, like I didn't expect to hear it. I turned around and met his eyes, but I couldn't hold the gaze.
“Mmm?” Sherlock mumbled whilst picking up a small screw which he had obviously missed from the cot, and hurriedly putting it in his pocket where John wouldn’t see.
John ran into the school and up to Matron who has all the dorm keys. Luckily there was no queue because he was much earlier and the school felt very empty, with only a few people who had come up last night wandering around. Once he had obtained the key he looked at the tag attached to it, room 21, he gave a sigh of relief, he knew where that was.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment before nodding slightly. There was a brief moment of pause before Sherlock turned and retrieved the package from where John had placed it earlier.
Hello lovely people! I haven't posted in a while so I thought I'd do you an extra long chapter :) I'm super excited to post one I just wrote but i'm a little ahead in the story so you're going to have to wait a little! (Needs polishing anyway.) Thank-you for those who are reading this! It means such a lot to hear you comment on it :) Please if you like it share it and pass it on to your friends, and comment and tell me what you enjoyed or didn't :) LOVE YOU ALL! xxxxxx
"Well we were given him, and now we have gotten attached and um, well he's so lovely and the most beautiful baby ever, and um we just couldn't give him to the authorities and he, he-his name is Felix." John blurted, letting it all out.
"Sherlock?" John tentatively approached, looking over his obviously drunk friend through his newly sober eyes.
He looked down at the gift in his hands and it suddenly seemed so pointless, so irrelevant to him. Why would John ever want this gift? As when he had planned to give it, it was truly to try to show John how good he could be at parenting, but John didn't care anyway. Silly, sentimental gift. He chucked the box into the corner where it made a dull clang as it hit the wall. "An-I-com-an-find-you-an-you-don-care-anymore." Sherlock finished, his face creasing into a sad realisation, and with this he crumpled onto the sofa again, and curled himself back into the corner. Not crying, but breathing heavily with his eyes wide open and staring into space as he hugged his knees.
Sherlock was holding Felix in his arms, the little boy dressed in a long dark coat and black top hat which was clearly too big for him, and completely covered in red paint. The paint had somehow managed to also find its way to be all over the kitchen counter, floor, splatterings on the walls, all over Sherlock and also every appliance in the kitchen.
"Sherlock!" I said raising my voice. "Shhh, I can hear Felix from out there!" I hissed, gesturing towards the door, merely paranoid of being caught out with a baby in school.
"We will be perfectly able to 'cope', Mycroft." He said defiantly, refusing to be beaten by his brother.
Sorry it's been so long! Here's a slightly longer chapter to make up for it! :) Please leave a comment if you like it!!! enjoy!
“It’s awesome, I started labelling all the things in the kitchen cupboards, but then Mama dearest told me it was ‘horrible’ and that ‘we are capable of working out what a spoon is without a label.’”
"I'm just, I had something on my foot and I was getting it off and I fell over..." She responded, moving up into a sitting position.
For Sherlock, he didn't know quite how he felt about the names John had just used. 'Daddy and Papa?' He didn't know what the nicknames meant. He was sure it must mean something. That John saw them as a pair? Something similar? He took a glance over at John's creased up and worried looking face. Of course they were a pair! They're bringing up Felix together aren't they! It just never occurred to Sherlock that they needed names other than their own for Felix to use in the future. He had always referred to his own as Father, he had never used the more childish 'Daddy' or 'Papa' but of course it made sense to be called them, wouldn't it?
"Okay good, thanks." John said reaching over to rescue the child from Sherlock who was holding him in a strange position and looked as if he was about to drop him.
Sherlock walked around the side of building, his determination building. Find John, find John, he kept repeating in his head, Find John, apologise. Find John, apologise.
The three of them were sitting back in the dorm at school. Sherlock looked down at his son and whisked him up off the floor and sat him on his lap on the sofa next to John. John tickled Felix who giggled happily, before Sherlock put the child back onto the floor. But before Felix moved off he just sat and looked between both of his parents and then scrunched up his little face in confusion.
Sherlock's face dropped the minute the door clicked shut. He sat holding Felix, a little bit taken aback and disappointed. He had been hoping that John would stay in the dorm this evening, and he would sit with him and Felix for a bit, Sherlock would show John how he'd taught Felix how to point to where the liver was and where the spleen was on his own body. But there had been hockey practice and then he now had friends he would rather sit with instead. Sherlock looked down at Felix's little face looking expectantly up at him, and ruffled his hair and held him close as he leant back onto John's bed, the smell of John wafting around him. He shut his eyes and Felix did the same. Waiting for John came back was all he seemed to be doing at the moment.
"You look like an Oliver." Sherlock said in a unthinking, monotone voice, opening the door to his room and stepping inside with John shortly stepping around and following behind him, giving a slight nod over to their neighbour as he passed. Leaving Oliver behind them with his mouth slightly open and his eyebrows furrowed, staring after the pair acting strangely, and the curious bundle. Both of which he had carefully taken note of.
"Ooh, look at you lying to mum and dad! Proper teenager you're becoming! You rascal! What have you been up to then?" She joked, punching him in the arm and grinning, which made him smile too.
Sherlock watched the action intently, admiring the way all the players on their school managed to get the ball off the opposing team. But especially John. John seemed to be one of the best players on the team, and Sherlock was amazed that he hadn't been on the team for long and before long he had scored another goal with the help of Greg. Sherlock cheered and clapped with the rest of the crowd, suddenly understanding why people went to games such as these and why people were often such avid sports fans. Of course he wouldn't find it exciting at all if John wasn't playing in the game.
Until he saw it. He froze where he was, his mind blank and empty. He felt like all the life had been sucked out of him. There was John, his John.... Kissing a girl. A girl, (that with all probability) John had just met. Sherlock was rooted to the spot and his eyes were locked on the couple. Unable to move, he had no option but to watch them for the couple of seconds it took before John looked up and pulled away. Almost as if he could sense Sherlock's presence.
His face went from smiling to shock, his eyes widening and rapidly surveying Sherlock's face for his reaction to his mistake? Or not? John didn't know. They'd not talked about that sort of thing yet. Not really.
They shifted the cot over to one side of the room and, moved across the sofa slightly to fit it in. Then John picked up the baby, still gripping his union jack cushion, and put him in it. The baby sat and stared up at John. John looked down, he had been half expecting the baby just to fall asleep just because he had been put into a cot, but obviously that was not going to be the case.
"It's only going to get more difficult you know." John reasoned, looking across to Sherlock with a knowing look.
"Oh- real-? oh right..." The woman stuttered, confused, and becoming awkward and flustered. Bowing her head, she quickly finished scanning the items.
“I’m not.” He replied flatly. “Birthdays are ridiculous celebrations. Why celebrate the fact you exist, with trivialities such as cake and… laughter.”
"So what do we know about the child Mycroft?" John asked, a little windswept by the rapid decision that had just been made.
"Wait. Okay. Sherlock, IF you tidy up a bit of...that." I gestured to the toys littered all over the sofa. "I will make you a cup of tea."
"Look. I'll show you how." She declared, before coming round to the other side of the sofa, Felix's eyes following her all the way around.
"Sherlock? Have you been up all night?" John asked, as he looked over his friends face. Suddenly feeling guilty at his own full night of sleep.
"Pleased to meet you John. Pleased to meet you." Oliver said, picking up John's hand and shaking it vigorously, which John thought was strange, but went with it anyway.
"Sherlock... What is that? What did you just throw over there?" He stood up and retrieved the item and brought it back to the sofa with him. Sherlock looked up at him, his face going pale. All of a sudden his friend leant over to the floor and threw up. John immediately knew how to behave and briskly hauled his friend towards the bathroom, offering reassuring words as he did so. He then held back his friend's hair and patted his back as he proceeded to throw up all of the bottle of whisky he had so ardently polished off earlier.
John still grinned and linked his arm into Sherlock's, "come on, you can't be grumpy, we found this amazing street! Well no, you found it. Let's go trick or treating!"
He was now concluding that this was possibly the drunkest he'd ever been, as his brain started to have the strangest thoughts... About, Sherlock? He thought of his friend and the way his hair looked ruffled up first thing in the morning, the way his skin looked like porcelain, white and beautiful... beautiful? John didn't understand his mind's wandering thoughts right now, so he tried to focus on what this girl next to him was saying. She was speaking to him and he hadn't been listening. He managed to focus on her, just as she looked over at him, her eyes darting across his face. He nodded briefly as a way of a reply to whatever it was she had been saying to him, which he hadn't heard.
"Fine. We won't ask the school. For now!" responded John, annoyed with his friend an drawing his mouth into a thin line.
Just then he heard the sound of footsteps outside the door, his eyes widened, as did Harry’s and she leapt up off the sofa and crawled over the back of it in a hurry to get to the door.
There they found two teddy bears, which John fell in love with and became determined to buy, despite Sherlock declaring loudly that children should not be given ‘such caricatures of life’, and that bears ‘look nothing like these toys and by giving them to children it will make them all the more willing to approach a dangerous animal’, this speech of his, made a woman further down the row give them a strange look, which of course, still didn’t hush Sherlock up. But John insisted on buying them, and so they went to the counter where they joined the back of the queue.
"Jack the Ripper! After he's killed all the prostitutes." Sherlock beamed, "Doesn't he look excellent."
The pair ran, John holding Felix to him tightly as Sherlock (being the faster of the two) was practically dragging John behind him. They just made the train a few seconds before the doors closed and as they did, the pair paused for a second, breathing in a sigh of relief. Haphazardly making their way through the carriage, they got plenty of stares from the people curious at the latecomers. At last they found a couple of seats in the last carriage and sat down to prepare for the long journey.
“Okay, hang on. You don’t know the basics of the solar system and yet why have you memorised the stages of development in a child?”  John asked incredulous.
This jarred something in John's chest and he wanted overwhelmingly to apologise to Sherlock although he didn't know what for... surely it was just to apologise about their argument they had had earlier... or maybe... John and Sherlock's eyes locked for a moment more and John could see some sort of feeling he had never seen before in his friend's eyes... perhaps it was pain? Suddenly, their moment was snapped by John's friends pushing their way rowdily out of the fire escape, laughing and drunkenly shoving each other.
How swiftly everything had changed. He almost didn't believe what had just happened. He looked around at the park but there was nobody there anymore. John had a feeling that they must have left before the shooting or else they would have heard some screams from the overprotective mothers, whose overprotectiveness didn't seems so ridiculous to John anymore.
Not that he could call this house home, as there were no memories for him inside this house, which supposedly was his house as well. He felt more at home in his dorm at school. Or more recently, at Sherlock's flat. He rang the doorbell and hoped that the rest of the day would all go by quickly.
That Saturday Sherlock was excited, he had wanted to do something nice for him and John, but had felt unsure of what to do. Today Felix was 7 months old exactly, and Sherlock decided he could look on the internet for ideas to do with what he might do for the occasion. He had found out that although it was meant for a seven year anniversary, the present to give was wool or copper. He assumed John knew about this tradition, and got extremely excited at the prospect of finding something perfect. so the day before whilst John was at his hockey practice, he had phoned up all the antique dealers in the area and found what he thought was the perfect gift for the occasion, and had it delivered to him the next morning. It was a small wooden box with intricate carvings painted in a copper coloured paint, with copper clasps and a tiny copper key. When you opened it up, there was a small copper music box, which after being wound up, played the opening to 'Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64', by Mendelssohn, the composer Felix was named after. Sherlock thought that him and John would give it to Felix that evening, and spent the entire morning pacing around waiting for it to arrive, and when it did, (luckily John was out as he wanted it to be a surprise for him too) he looked around the room panic stricken. What was he going to do about wrapping paper? Sherlock looked over to Felix who was happily playing on the carpet with Sherlock's shoes and some pencils which were lying strewn around, he subtly hid the present behind his back to get past Felix and put it under his own pillow on his bed, as he had no doubt the child was clever enough to spot he had something in his hand and wish to play with it immediately.
John politely as he could in his state, declined her offer of a cigarette and instead stood next to her, both of them leaning against the hard cold wall of the outside of the club, washed by the yellowing light of the street lamps. She breathed out the smoke into the cool night air, as John stood, trying to stop his vision from spinning.
There were no more texts from Sherlock after that, and when John walked into the flat everything was surprisingly quiet. He went through into their living room, where Sherlock was sitting waiting for him on his chair reading a newspaper, and he looked up as John came in.
"We will have frees at different times we can take care of him then, leave him in our dorm room the other times."
"Sherlock. I know you feel this sudden need to try and bring up your new child prodigy, and also for you to not have to admit to Mycroft that you can’t do something, god forbid! But I just don't think that this is possible!"
Sherlock nodded, and the pair headed over to the door, standing behind a group of small children all dressed up and pointing out to Felix the pumpkin and all the decorations, to which he made small delighted gurglings at.
“Harry wai-” John feebly protested, as she pulled on the handle and swung open the door, revealing Sherlock with key poised, holding onto a little bundle in his arms.
"Really? Thank you ever such a lot!" John gushed, suddenly beaming and relived that most of it was worked out.
This flat was a apparent “Necessity” of Sherlock’s, bought 3 years ago, (with the Holmes’s fortune) and it was “needed” for Sherlock to live when he was sick of the huge family mansion, and home from school. Inadvertently he usually lived there for the entire holiday. His parents didn't seems to care where he was, maybe they thought it boosted his independence, and so long as he was there for Christmas, Birthday’s, and other festive occasions, they turned a blind eye to his absence.
The facts: I felt weird about Molly being near Sherlock. I am clearly therefore jealous of their relationship. I am jealous because I like Sherlock. I mean...because we are really close friends ...with a child. Well then it's obvious...
“Oh great. Brilliant! Now we are stuck as 16 year old parents because you won’t give in to a stupid, childish argument! Just let Mycroft win for god’s sake!”
"Oliver. Yes I know." He said, edging his way around him, praying that Felix didn't move or make any noise. Oliver looked taken aback, obviously used to doing his own introductions, and stood staring at Sherlock with an air of amazement.
"Sherlock!" John called sharply into the other room. A few seconds later, Sherlock walked in carrying Felix proudly.
“Well John, it doesn’t matter, we shouldn’t push him to do something he is scared of.” Harry said in a coy voice, giving a sidelong glance over at Sherlock who was now getting increasingly more frustrated about being labeled as ‘scared,’ and completely falling for the child tactic which Harry was employing.
Sherlock didn’t know how to react to this, and neither did John so they simply stared in complete silence.
John narrowed his eyes, but didn't say anything to Sherlock, instead going and having a shower in their bathroom, and getting changed back into his school uniform again.
"Yeah, I'm sorry but I do." He apologised, looking at his watch, which read 8:20pm. He felt a little sorry for his mother, but he wanted to get back, and he also wanted to escape any more awkward questions from his father. He stood up and then went over to his mother who also stood up. He said goodbye to his mother and gave her a hug with the earnest promise to see her at the next holidays. He said a stilted goodbye to his father, and then Harry walked him to the front door.
They went downstairs, stopping for a moment for John to take his bag from his room, which he put by the front door on the way into the lounge. Their mum, got them to sit down with them on the sofa to watch some television. After a little bit of time, John took off his jacket, forgetting about the tan disaster, until his mother called out, and made everyone else turn around as well.
After an hour of lazily drinking tea, whilst Felix slept, John set off for his parents house, armed with his pile of photographs, a mournful attitude, and a slightly tanned looking face... from the fake tan which Sherlock had just managed to persuade John was a 'good idea' to use on his face and arms.
She was beckoned over by one of the guys in the group, and came over grinning and batting her long and fake eyelashes at the attention, obviously a little tipsy due to her staggering a little as she made her way into the centre of the group. The group eventually made their way back to the dance floor, bringing the girl over with them. As they all danced, the guys jovially tried to push her and John together, by 'accidentally' shoving into them as the crowd moved. John being tipsy and carefree, didn't feel awkward, in fact was quite enjoying the attention he was getting off of the girl and his friends and he began to laugh along with it. The girl seemed to be thoroughly enjoying herself too, laughing and throwing back her long shining hair over her shoulder as she danced, running her hands through it and eyeing up John. So when she asked him loudly over the music, moving close to his ear, if he'd go outside with her so she could have a cig, he happily obliged and dutifully followed her out the back via the fire escape where they had originally entered from.
John hung his head, feeling their absent, unspoken words affect him. Sherlock who was walking beside him, was completely obliviously to all this, until he suddenly noticed John shying away from the other people.
Once Mycroft had left, John sorted out the baby's bottle, making sure to thoroughly clean the bottle, (who knows what Sherlock may have used it for!) he also set about making a cup of tea for himself and Sherlock. Finally, he sat down in his chair and passed across Sherlock the tea, which he started sipping slowly.
John's group had been in there for the last forty minutes, and during this time, Sherlock had been standing nearby, gearing up the courage to enter. He felt scared, not for fear of rejection due to his age, as even putting the lax rules aside, he was tall and looked far older than he was. No, he was more scared of John... What he was going to say to him. This type of rejection sent a fierce chill down his spine. What if John didn't want to be his friend any more? How would he cope? What would happen to Felix? Sherlock paced, his head reeling in these thoughts, his mind uneasy with sentiment.
"Mmm." Sherlock said, walking into the room properly and surveying it. "Perhaps not. We need our things in here first."
“Oh! That was it! You want a man to be strong enough to pick you up and twirl you round. That was what Cosmo said. That would be pretty awesome to be fair”
John wafted the air around his head to try clear some of the steam, giving a slight cough as he did so.
They ended up in the children’s play area in the park, by the slides and swing and immediately obtained disapproving, overprotective looks from the mothers, who kept a firm eye on their own children and the pair. John sighed, he just didn’t understand their prejudices, the mothers just saw a pair of teenagers and were automatically wary for their children's safety, without even knowing them!
"Yes you do! I didn't mean for you to stay up all night trying to find a nanny! We have still got a week to sort it."
It was as though some sort of magic lingered in the air as the birds started to tweet and the sun began to peep from behind grey heavy clouds. And the pale blue morning light made all the red leaves on the trees appear as though it was still summer, and they weren't in fact dying and about to fall off onto the ground. The light washed everything with a sense of excitement, and John felt this as he clutched Felix to his chest and scurried through the trees. Once they stepped off the train into London again, Sherlock ran outside of the station and stood breathing in the morning air. John scuttled after him, and looked at his friend confused until he understood. This was Sherlock's city, this was where he belonged, and he was merely taking it all back in again after the months he had spent away. He grinned over at his friend who remained perfectly still with his eyes closed and his mouth slightly parted, breathing deeply through his nose.
Hey all! I really would love for more people to be reading my story! The numbers seem to have decreased a tad :( so If you can recommend it to friends though it would be brilliant :) Thankyou for those reading this now! i would so so love to hear from you! please leave a comment if you liked it or didnt!
John quickly got up placing the baby on Sherlock’s lap (much to his annoyance,) and hurried to the kitchen and started to heat up some milk and found an empty water bottle which he washed thoroughly before putting in the milk.
But out of all the photos that they had taken, there was a series which was definitely John's favourite. They had found a low branch in the forest which John had balanced the camera on. He had then put on the self timer of the camera and had got it to take a sequence of pictures. All the pictures were of him and Sherlock, both holding Felix in their arms and looking towards the camera. The expressions on their faces changed as the sequence went on, from Sherlock being surly, and John smiling falsely (as in all the ones took for his parents.) The pictures then went on to see John nudge Sherlock in the side to try to get him to smile. The last picture was by far the best one. John leant in for a closer look at it. John had obviously just nudged Sherlock but had continued to look at the camera, and was now grinning what John noticed to be a more genuine smile. Felix in between the pair was smiling at the camera as well, and had his little hands in the air in glee. Sherlock however was the only one not looking at the camera, but instead was looking over at John, his face in a curious expression, a mixture of the clearly happy and rare smile which he wore on his face, and something else John couldn't identify.
"You do realise it would taste exactly the same of you made it yourself!" I commented, stirring the milk in.
John jogged onto the field, trying to keep his mind focused on the game he was about to partake in. It was his first chance since being put of the A team for hockey that he had had for showing the team and the coaches what he could do, and he was determined not to mess it up. He looked up at the greying sky, hoping it didn't rain and put the match off.
John looked stunned, "are you sure that's accurate?" he asked, looking again at the watch, his eyebrows furrowing.
"You don't seem to." He mumbled to himself whilst picking Felix up and bring him to his bed, where he sat with him on his lap. He then started to talk through Felix at me, something he knew would wind me up.
The second Sherlock lifted the lid, the beautiful notes of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor rang out in dainty tones across the room. It brought a tear to John's eyes as he heard the docile tones and he rapidly shut his eyes as an attempt to stop a flood as the music washed over him.
'Great' John thought. 'We have about three useful baby gros and an abundance of incredibly useless baby suits.'
"Okay... So IF the head allows us (god forbid!) to keep our child in school with us, we still can't make it work! What about during the day? What then?"
"My thoughts exactly." Sherlock murmured distractedly, looking out of their window down to the pathway outside. He then pulled out his phone and started texting. John looked briefly towards the window before turning back to Felix.
Sherlock had been wandering aimlessly around the streets outside the club which were filled with those groups of friends either making their way to or from the pubs or bars. This was the place where he had deducted that John and his friends were, given the easy access and lack security of the small town club, who didn't care too greatly for seeing anyone's identification.
“Nobody plans on it until BOOM, there’s a brilliant shirt for your boyfriend and you can’t get it cause you don’t know what size he is. Quelle dommage!”
He had been avidly drinking since they snuck into the club through a fire escape at the back about an hour ago, but the mixture of beer and the few vile coloured shots he had been persuaded to do, were starting to go to his head. A fact he wasn't particularly fussed about, as he wanted, (to some extent) to drown his sorrows in the alcohol. Make his mind stop fixating on the argument from earlier, which it was perpetually doing.
“At least your brother understands that a baby has a need for things other than tea and unidentifiable stuff you found in a shop!”
“This is a real problem then Johnny, how you ever gonna buy him a shirt if you don’t know his neck measurements?”
That evening, John looked over to Sherlock who was proudly standing by the (now built) cot. He had spent hours creating the item which he had originally deemed to be ‘so simple that the baby could have built it himself.’
John realised once he had looked in the mirror at the appalling looking 'tan' on his face, that it had been an appalling idea in the first place, that Sherlock knew nothing of what he was talking about, and so John had tried to wash his face to get it off, but a considerable amount wouldn't come off, and had tinged his skin a sort of dirty brown, which John hoped to look convincing enough to be a real tan, but wasn't really sure if he could rely on Sherlock's hurried affirmations and nodding that it did as he walked out the door.
"Oh yeah I'm kind of living here now... It's all, I shall explain." John stuttered, his smile faltering slightly.
“Yes, Felix i’m your Daddy, you are correct, do not worry. And this, is your Papa” Pointing to each of them in turn and trying to make it as clear as he could for the undeveloped mind of the infant.
"Yes." Sherlock replied, his eyes creased in worry at his friend's reaction. As soon as John opened his eyes he saw this and went to reassure him that they were happy tears, but his friend cut in first.
The day of Halloween fell within the half term for the school, so the students were allowed to return home for the week if they wished. John had wanted therefore, to do something memorable with Sherlock and Felix, and he was sure that Felix would love this holiday especially the part where he got to dress up. John already had so many ideas for a costume for him, and the thought of creating it was making him very excited.
Sherlock stood up, he had gone over in his head exactly what he wanted to say to John. His apology was right on the tip of his tongue and he needed to find John and make him listen to it. Make him forgive him.
Sherlock placed the metal into the beaker and there was a small explosion and a huge cloud of smoke flew into the air. John started coughing again, and looked at Felix who was gleefully banging his timer against the table of his highchair and giggling extensively. John smiled and decided to leave them to it, giving up for the moment on his schoolwork. He took the book and shoved it away in his schoolbag to do some other time, and then wondering curiously as to the contents, he went over to the boxes which Mycroft had delivered previously, which still weren’t unpacked yet. He rooted around in one of them and pulled out a book. It was a huge book, and was entitled ‘How to care for you and your baby.’ John inquisitively opened it up on the first page and looked down at it. His curiousity deepened and he sat down further into his chair reading it, the details gripping him. Once he was about 40 pages into it, Sherlock stuck his head around from the kitchen and came over to see what John was reading.
“Sherlock, come on it’s my birthday, you can’t be annoyed with me on my birthday!” He grinned, trying to snap his friend out of his silly mood.
John went back to the form and sat down at his desk, pulling out a pen. He filled in the name box, and jotted down the date of Felix’s birth on a slip of paper, which he placed in a draw for later reference. He looked over the rest of the sheet, then noticed something.
Sherlock sat outside on the tiered seating, by the hockey pitch waiting for it to start, the sky was grey and looked like there was the chance of it raining, so Sherlock pulled his scarf and his coat more firmly around his as he waiting in anticipation for the players to arrive. He was looking forward to seeing John play as he had heard he was very good from the other players, and he hadn't seen him play for years, just because he hadn't been in the same PE set as him, and Sherlock had dropped PE as soon as he physically was able to. He hadn't seen John to tell him that he would be at the match, so he had sent him a text telling him he was coming, although he doubted he would have seen it before the match.
John positioned himself on the starting line. He always loved this, the feeling of just about to start something, the suspense building in his chest as he waited to go. He breathed in and ran, feeling the drizzly rain brush over his face as he did so, refreshing and spurring him on. The next time he ran he tried to time himself on his watch, but it was difficult to get it accurate as he was trying to stop it just as he went over the line, but his running prevented it from being exactly the time he crossed it, so he gave up trying to time himself after several attempts. He hadn't run since the end of last term, and it was a good feeling, to just feel the cold air around him seemingly turning warmer, as his body temperature rose the more he ran. As well as that rush of adrenaline as he built up speed.
"Oh how wonderful! Here you go children, take some sweets." As each child got their sweets they ran back to the street for the next house with a squeak of "Thankyou" in their wake. John reached in and plucked a few sweets for Felix and put them in his bucket.
Once they felt they had enough to sufficiently convince John's parents of his whereabouts for the last month, they headed back to the flat. Felix had been with them in his pram for the duration of the photo-shoot, and despite loving and clapping in amusement at seeing John and Sherlock messing about at first, was getting rather tired and kept yawning as they made their way back on the tube.
"Oh. Okay... wait, is Felix actually timing?" He asked curiously, looking over to the child who was firmly holding the stopwatch with one tiny finger on the start button ready to be pressed down.
I looked over at him, thoroughly irritated now, and therefore deciding to use his own tactic against him, I spoke to Felix too.
"Well. Yeah, I just didn't want to lie to you. I hoped you wouldn't care-" He looked so sad Harry felt sorry for him and she stood up and pulled him into a big hug.
John moved slowly towards the sofa where his friend had quickly curled himself up into a little ball in the corner, his long curls falling across his face, looking as small and as fragile as Felix.
One minute left, John had the ball and ran with it, only to have it tackled off of him, leaving him angry at himself. He used his anger to push himself towards the player and he knocked the ball out of his stick's reach and into his own and curved around, following the edge of the pitch down towards the goal. As the goal loomed in the distance John heard the cries of the last few seconds being counted down and he knew he only had one option, and so he hit it with all his might towards the goal, where it sharply just made it past the goalkeeper and with the force that John had flung it, bounced into the back of the net at the top of the goal. There was a fraction of the continued silence from the crowd before they erupted into cheers and clapping.
He was smart, he understood it was only the start of term and he couldn't have been expected to be in this year's A team immediately, but it was always the same people, they just managed to be that little bit better than John at the game, and therefore he never seemed to get a chance.
'Molly has been so great with helping us,' I thought as I looked over at her handing a toy down to Felix. We are so lucky to have her help. Why do I feel... Strange about her then? I had felt this strange feeling about her for a few days now, I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, I liked Molly... I'm sure that I like her? Why wouldn't I? It was just that way she put her hand there, on Sherlock's arm. And she keeps looking at him like, she fancies him or something. That sideways glance look she just gave him, and the way she keeps bowing her head every time he speaks to her. I didn't like It.... But. Then this feeling... Was it? No, that's absurd! It can't be jealously! Why on earth would I feel jealous? I don't feel jealous! Or do I? I looked back up to the pair of them sitting there. They are too close. That was my immediate thought.
"Yeah, like I said. No problem. Um, maybe I could come up and see Felix sometime? When you're at school?"
Sherlock just grinned knowing he could quite easily overrule John if he wanted to, and moved to the next aisle, whisking the pram from John's hands and pushing it in front of him, John followed hurriedly behind.
"Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn" John whispered, in awe at the beauty and thoughtfulness of Sherlock's gift.
Sherlock felt stunned. He hadn't expected what had happened to take place. He didn't feel okay, he felt strange, as if all the tendrils of his connection to John had snapped. He didn't know quite what to do with himself. He picked up Felix and then put him back down again. He paced from side to side then glanced at the sofa where the present lay, now looking like a sad pathetic little box rather than the lovely surprise it was meant to be. He realised with a start that John wouldn't get it today when he was meant to get it, meaning the whole present meant nothing now, the idea of it being 7 months meant nothing. This thought made him almost tear up, although he didn't understand why.
"Don't worry Felix, we're fine! Your Daddy and Papa just found something very funny!" John said then looking up, he caught Sherlock's eye and realised what he had said.
He took a step back away from her, his eyes fixed on Sherlock, his eyebrows creased into a worried frown as he took a step towards his friend. Sherlock flinched at this and reacting by taking a step away from John as if he didn't want him to come any closer to him.
A week later John and Sherlock were  the most exhausted that they had ever been. For the last week they had spent every single night being woken up at 1 hour, 2 hour intervals throughout. It was apparent to Sherlock that Felix was teething, as he wailed and grasped his mouth and just wanted to bite everything he could find, which meant Sherlock was forbidden by John to put Felix in the kitchen and to keep him away from all toxic materials for the time being, orders which he grumpily was forced to comply with. John's book hadn't been a lot of help, and after attempting many times to put to use the advice from it, only to be put down by Sherlock, he had given up.
"He is the most adorable child!" She exclaimed, "he looks just like Sherlock!" She looked surprised, and glanced between Sherlock and the baby.
As the pair left for the doorway, Greg gave John a nod of recognition, and with it, a conformation of his name. A common way of leaving a conversation between two guys, one which was more familiar to John than the outdated mannerisms of his partner. Although nevertheless, after shutting the door, John thought that he could see them all getting along. Well... Except for Sherlock, but then he never really gets on with anyone! John thought to himself with a slight grin.
The pair collapsed onto the comfy sofa in their living room. They had just managed to get Felix to sleep, despite it being the middle of the day. Sherlock looked over to John who was sleepily shutting his eyes, he nudged him in the side and John rolled his eyes open and looked across to Sherlock moodily.
In particular his father had forever complained of any expense spent around his birthday or anyone else's. Complained that the money could be spent better elsewhere. A result of this childhood filled with no birthdays, was that John never wanted anyone to make a fuss. And even the mere thought of his Birthday happening filled him with dread. Therefore, he took great pains to ensure that none of his friends or anyone knew that it was approaching the next day. This way, he figured nobody could make a fuss or spend ‘pointless’ money on him for a ‘ridiculous’ celebration of his birth.
After purchasing a pair of trunks from the front desk for each of them, as neither of the pair seemed to have owned any, and of course Felix didn’t. The group wandered into the hot changing rooms, which were clammy and foggy with hot steam.
"No. He's not our brother." He replied forcefully with a stony expression, turning back to the lady. John's face with wide eyes, lifted to look at Sherlock.
“That is a completely illogical game. Even the baby isn’t so stupid to not realise that you haven’t disappeared.”
"No! Leave me alone" he shouted, wildly raising his arms before turning around and throwing himself onto the sofa face first.
Sherlock swiftly darted along the corridor holding Felix in his arms along with several jumpers, which for the most part covered him. All the corridors seemed to be longer than they knew them to be, out of fear of being caught. They both kept going all the way to the girls wing, keeping to the quiet routes around the side of the building, and walking down the corridors cautiously, managing to only meet a few people, who were in such a rush to get to their destination, that they barely paid attention to the pair. Therefore, in spite of a few close calls, they managed to arrive at Molly's dorm room, without Felix being noticed, much to John's relief.
Comment if you like it or want to see anything happen to the characters! Would love to hear your feedback! :) Thanks so much for reading!!!
“But also- oh it doesn’t matter...” He said bowing his head down, embarrassed, and trying to walk forwards, but Sherlock was still there, and put his hands on John's shoulders to stop him from moving away.
"I am fully aware of the basic laws of Physics, thank you Molly." He curtly replied, glaring at her.
Also he was extremely nervous for Harry and Sherlock to meet, they both had similar traits in their personalities and he was worried that they were going to end up in some huge shouting argument and then never speak to each other again, he wanted them to get along, however this would be a miracle considering Sherlock’s track record with making new friends. He usually insulted them, blanked them, or stunned them, enough to drive them away within seconds. Harry however was clearly buzzing to meet the pair and did everything she could to bring them back up again in conversation, much to John’s dismay.
As the train travelled cross-country John looked out of the window at the already turning brown with the Autumn English countryside which was whizzing past them. Felix sitting on John's lap had his little hand on the window and was staring out with his eyes round and darting about at all the interesting things which were going by. Looking over at Sherlock, John smiled because his friend had fallen asleep and had his head lolled back onto John's shoulder, with his mouth pursed shut and his knees pulled up to his chest, and John thought that he looked just like a little animal curled up next to him. John relaxed and looked over his friend's familiar face and how much like a child he looked when he was asleep, his hair around his face in an unruly mass, curls falling over his peaceful face. One in particular was over his eye and although they were all messy, seemed to be out of place to all of the others, John instinctively leaned over and gently picked it up and moved it out of his eyes, holding the curl that second too long before letting it bounce back into place.
At John’s innocent question, the detective had to stop his ministrations or this conversation would be over far too quickly. “No, I’ve done it twice,”
“Lestrade,” Sherlock greeted, smiling dumbly. “To what do I owe the…erm,” he paused trying to think of what he knew he was supposed to say. “Pleasure! Yes, yes, pleasure!”
John needed help, and he needed it quick. Mycroft could help him, Mycroft always helped when Sherlock got into situations where he couldn’t get himself out. The light were dimming quickly as small shadows ran around with snuffers and pails of water to put out any light John had set ablaze. Sherlock knew if the light went out in John’s eyes, then the light would go out in his mind palace forever, leaving him in eternal darkness.
“Well thank goodness you’re above all that,” John said without thinking. His tongue always seemed to get the better of him in dangerous situations, which was not always the best survival strategy.
John saw a wolfish smile at one side of the mirror while the lower half displayed the giant initials ‘SH’ burned into his left shoulder. “So you don’t ever forget,” Sherlock whispered above him, a slight threat heard in the timbre of his voice. “This is mine,” he placed his nose on John’s blonde hair, “this is mine,” Sherlock wormed his hand under John’s hip, grabbing ahold of his limp cock, “and this is mine,” he finished, placing a kiss to the boy’s back where his heart was. “And I’m yours, John,” Sherlock said into his nape, making a shiver run down John’s spine.
With a loud yelp, John arched his back, presenting Sherlock with a better angle for deeper penetration. Sherlock rubbed his hand up and down John’s back slowly, encouraging the moans as he entered a third finger. “Sherlock, please,” John begged him, his boy falling right into a lustful headspace.
“I know you want it too, John,” Sherlock said, letting his hand splay out on his stomach and his legs spread wide in invitation. “Just…just a little taste. Please, are going to let me bleed out, here?” Sherlock said, playing on John’s caregiving nature. As an extra incentive, Sherlock put his hand around the gash and squeezed, forcing more blood out. A line of deep read dripped down his inner thigh, almost touching where his bollocks were stowed away.
This chapter has explicit material at the end but I'm sure if you've made it this far you already know that John is underage and Sherlock is not.
“Well, I could tell you why I think you did it but I don’t think you are going to like the answer,” she continued to smile and John wondered if it was permanently tattooed on her face.
“Yes,” she handed him a green folder in a plastic bag. “A brand new school history for John Franklin Thomas, complete with top marks, school IDs, and a clean permanent record all the way back to primary.” Sherlock smiled when he heard the name. He had been up for two nights straight trying to come up with the perfect name to replace the equally perfect name of Hamish Watson. At first, the detective thought it would be easiest to give John the last name of Holmes, but when the boy got older, how would they marry if they were seemingly related? No, it was best to identify the boy as a God Son from a long lost friend who died tragically in a fire, or at least that’s what the papers said.
Sherlock was sitting in a sofa with his burnt arm tentatively held out to his brother, who sat next to him.  “Stop squirming, Sherlock,” Mycroft growled at his brother, who tried to jerk his arm away every five seconds. The elder Holmes was dabbing the burns with a soft cotton ball soaked in some sort of liquid, while the younger kept his head turned away with a pained expression on his face. “The sooner you start behaving the sooner it will be over, now hold still.”
“Sherlock,” John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “this isn’t some game. It’s not good for you to be feasted on every day. Plus, I need to know what’s going to happen to me at the end of the week. Is your brother going to release the entire league on me because I’m drinking from his baby brother?”
“Who the fuck are you people?” John said, his eyes wide with fear and disbelief. He had never seen nor heard of this group before and somehow they knew everything about him. With his hand on the panic button the nurses gave him, John glared at the neatly put together woman. “Well? You better start explaining yourself before I call my Doms in here.” John couldn’t believe his own words, but still they offered comfort in this unknown situation.
Once they entered the exam room, the door was closed and John took a deep breath to center himself. “Turn around for me,” the first command came, though John could tell it was a preliminary test. Many Doms had tried this with John before, giving just a little push to see how sensitive the Sub was. He assumed it was because they were just lazy arseholes who wanted to put forth the least amount of effort to get what they wanted. Most of the time he was right. This however, was much, much different.
It took an hour to strap Sherlock securely to a chair. They removed all of his clothes and wrapped the twine around calves, thighs, stomach, chest, and arms. Mycroft decided he would be the one who Sherlock drank from, while Greg sat on the couch with a tranq gun in his hand. The two humans had talked alone outside, though they didn’t know John could hear them, and discussed when and if they would shoot the older vampire. It was good to know where the humans stood, and at least they weren’t planning on shooting him unless things went south.
“Well, the way I see it, you can either put your trousers back on, leave, and let Mycroft come back in a couple of days to try again, or,” John paused, looking over at Sherlock, assessing, “I can wake him up and we can try again. It’s up to you. You need to be willing or your fear is going to trigger Sherlock’s instinct to hunt.”
“Well,” John said, picking up Mycroft underneath the armpits and dragging him back over to the couch, “the fact that he’s only sniffing you and not trying to take a bite, I’d call that a huge leap in Sherlock’s self-control.” John settled the eldest Holmes comfortably on the couch, crossing his bruised and bloody arms over his chest like a…well, a sleeping vampire in his coffin.
“Hmm?” Mycroft grunted, but opened his eyes and made a valiant attempt to get off the bed. “Yes, yes, of course I can, why wouldn’t I be able to walk on my own?”
“Oh, wow, you actually went to the college and picked them up for me? That’s…wow, thank you! Yeah, I could really use a coffee, too. “
“Mike…Harry?” John tried, frustrated at himself for not having the right words to show his friends the error in there ways. “Please, you have to trust me. They’re not going to hurt us.”
He placed his ear to the small tan chest, listening to the heart beat that gave his possession life. Life that was now his, well, would soon be his, in every way. Yes, John would be upset at first that he wouldn’t see his mom again or his friends but he would soon learn, just like he did in the shower last night, that his Sherlock is all he needs. “Mine,” he licked over the tan neck, relishing in the sweet salty mixture that John provided for his pleasure.
The coldness John felt on his back when Sherlock left was intolerable. His muscles tightened and he squeezed his eyes together as he waited.
John steeled himself, ready for the man trying to sweet talk him into putting the scalpel down so they could put him down. “John?” Greg called through the door, then opened it to see the Sub holding a nurse hostage. “Are you okay?” He asked, but to John’s surprise he was asking him, not the woman.
After a few moments of taking in the graphology and style of the handwriting, Sherlock began to write as John.
“Oh, Johnny I almost forgot! How did the tryouts go today?” His mother asked, excitement in her eyes. John, however, knew her enthusiasm wasn’t for him but instead it was based on her hoping he would make the team so she could brag to the other football moms that her son had made varsity. It didn’t bother him too much anymore though, he was trying to be proud of himself and now he knew at least one other person was really happy for him.
“Are you okay?” John asked, ignoring Sherlock’s presence completely. “Did they hurt you? Did they touch you?”
Sherlock could still smell the blood, the cherry scent, and he still had his hunger. Now though, he realized what he needed to do to get that blood, let that scent wash over him, sate that hunger. John wanted him to be a good boy, to wait. Sherlock could do that. Yes, he’d had a moment of weakness, but now he was sure he could control it to get what he wanted and outsmart John.
John looked at the clock again, “fuck, almost midnight, sorry footballer I have school in the morning,” yawning he typed his goodbye.
“Normally I would be the one doing this, but since I can barely move my arm, Sherlock will be taking over. John,” he motioned towards Sherlock, “you will receive a spanking of 40 swats.”
“John?” Sherlock asked, placing his hand in the middle of John’s back. Once again, the calming presence stilled the Sub’s nerves and helped him refocus on the task at hand.
“If my brother is spotted by any trackers or hunters, I will not be able to keep him off the League’s list.”
Sherlock mumbled to himself as he opened the door, letting the warm salty air envelope him. The sun tingled and heated his skin as he sat down on what seemed to be some sort of hammock chair. Mycroft had chosen a condominium right next to the ocean and Sherlock watched the white sand as it was darkened by the waves coming in at high tide, taking some out to sea but leaving others to pack deeper and darker on the shore. The sound of the surf crashing was so loud, too loud, causing Sherlock to cover his ears until he was able to dive into his mind palace, taking solace in the only quiet room he knew existed, and tuned out the rest of the world.
He blinked a few times and shook his head, realizing it was all just a dream. It might have been a dream, but he found his cock to be moist and tingly, as if it had all really happened.
“I don’t know. You’re the professional, aren’t you supposed to tell me?” John asked, already on the defensive.
John smiled to himself for a moment, thinking about how far Sherlock had gone to keep him at Baker Street. To have someone that cared that much about him was amazing…
“Shhh, you’re alright, Sherlock,” John said quietly, petting a cold hand through his hair. At that one touch, tension started leaking out of the young vampire’s body. It was as if John could release some sort of relaxing pheromone that only affected Sherlock. “We’re not going to hurt you, I promise, love. We just want to help you, okay?”
The door closed and John let out a sigh of relief. He had to think of a way out of this, a way that didn’t end with him getting shot or Joann getting hurt. “Let me go,” the woman tried to assert her dominance over him, shoving out a weak wave of bliss. He felt bad for the girl, he really did, but John knew he wasn’t going to hurt her. However, he had to make it look like he was willing to do anything if they were going to take him seriously.
“Ah, John, Sherlock, good of you to join me,” Mycroft said. He was sitting in his chair behind a wooden desk, and had a glass of what appeared to be scotch in his hand. “John,” he set his glass down and leaned forward to brace one elbow on the desk. “What you did today was dangerous and juvenile, not to mention disobedient. You ran from your Doms. That is your first offence. Secondly, you took someone hostage-”
"He has no name which we are aware of. Perhaps the parents named him something, but this is unknown. We only know the number he was issued which is '191218'."
"Oh okay. Sure." Molly assured, stepping into the living room, where John gestured for her to have a seat on the sofa. He had hastily moved the baby toys into the box and half hidden the cot behind some more boxes, as not to freak her out immediately. He hovered nervously in the doorway.
Sherlock in this situation would have usually gone running after the shooter, regardless of the danger. But this was different.
"Don't you want him to have fun John?" He said in a mournful tone, with a hint of spite, raising his eyebrows at me.
Sherlock collapsed in misery in the doorway of a closed shop, onto the cold and hard paving slabs, the doorway somewhat sheltering him from the stares of any other people on the street. His chest ached and he didn't have any clue why. And that unnerved him. He looked down to his hands and they were shaking like a leaf, so he shoved them into his coat pockets and scowled, disliking the feeling of weakness. He never felt weak. He never felt... sad? But right there, sitting in the doorway, riddled with uncertainty he felt overwhelming sadness. And he detested it.
“Sherlock, we came all this way. You have to have a go on the Slide of Death.” John cried, jiggling Felix about in his arms who looked adorable in his little baby trunks and when he was in the water he had been in this kind of floating seat, so he could splash about to his little heart’s desire.
Heyy sorry its been a while since i posted!! ive been ever so busy! :) but anyway here is another chapter!! hope you guys like it! :D
The dorm rooms were in sets of ten beds to a dorm for all of the lower school, but now that the pair were in lower sixth, they could have the privilege of getting a dorm to share with one other sixth former (provided they were of the same gender.) John, as was said previously, had sent in his room allocation request to be with Sherlock. Now, they had a small room to themselves, which felt to John like a miniature flat. The walls had dark wooden panelling and so did the floor, but the floor was also covered by a giant rug which was made of threads of dark blue, black and red's woven together into a old fashioned pattern of triangles and squares. The furniture in the room was, as you entered, to the left- two wooden beds which matched the darkness of the wood which surrounded the rest of the room. Each headboard had a patten carved into the wood, made up of swirls, and each bed was made with a thick, woollen blanket laid on top.
"No it is good, I like having time to myself! And she's got a provisional art scholarship too, so she needs to work hard now." Molly finished, trying to convince herself, just as they arrived at the bottom of the staircase up to John's dorm.
"Go into the drivers carriage, there is a lever where you can override the main settings for speed, which is underneath the main desk. After that the rest is simple. Follow the dials on the left hand side of the board."
“We are not calling him that with you telling people it is the abbreviation for Nickel! No periodic elements!”
"Your Daddy is going to have to get his own cup of tea if he wants one." I said in the most sickly sweet voice I could manage, before looking up at Sherlock's face. "Because I am not going to make him one."
“Clair de Lune. Debussy.” He looked back at John, a small smile playing on his lips, relishing the commendation of his playing.
Sherlock gave a half smile at John, and then sat back in his chair, John put the baby down on the floor, between the two chairs and sat in his own. They both looked down on the child, who looked up with blue eyes back at them. John turned his face up to Sherlock, and spoke.
Sherlock looked up, his eyes narrowing and his head swaying slightly from drunkenness. John moved to approach him, but before he could even take one step, he was rooted to the spot by the mere fact that Sherlock flinched away from him as he moved. This shook John to his core.
“Stop making excuses John. You three are all coming with me, in my car and we are going to WaterLand whether you like it or not. And you will have a different attitude by the time we get back.”
“Yeah, I mean, that’s kinda my opinion too.” John murmured back, although he wasn’t convinced, he had definitely seen that flash of hurt on his friend’s face, he knew he had, no matter how much Sherlock was now trying to cover it.
Suddenly, both of them realised how close they were between the plastic ferns. They had had to move closer so they could see each other through the leaves, and were now in a pocket of space between them, each plastic decoration on either side forcing them to stand close. But they were very close now.
John stormed out of the school building, walking through the orchard to his right. Sherlock was seriously getting under his skin. He was fuming at his last remark about him not being 'allowed' to play football, I mean who did Sherlock think he was? With all of his behaviour which he has to put up with! John leant his head against an apple tree in the dark, the damp cool bark placed against the heat of his angered and flushed face. John suddenly thought about the fact that he had turned down going out with the guys from the football team tonight due to wanting to see Sherlock. He sighed, oh of course Sherlock had ruined the nice night he had been envisaging. Well why shouldn't I go out? He thought whilst picking at one of the tree's low hanging branches.
Just then, the doorbell rang. John looked toward the door and then back to Sherlock who was unmoving. He grunted and then went to answer it, mumbling about how Sherlock doesn’t even answer the door in his own flat. At the door was a delivery man with several large cardboard boxes and a form and pen.
John felt good, really really good but the problem with feeling like that was his mind just couldn’t quite grasp onto any thoughts as they passed through his brain. He was sliding down fast on a slick surface with only Sherlock standing at the bottom to catch him, which should terrify the young boy but he felt too good to care. A forehead was pressed against his, hands wrapped tightly around his chest and back, and the hot breath on his neck brought John even deeper into the light blue haze enveloping his entire being. There was quite mumbling next to his ear but John couldn’t make out the words, nor did he care to try because the deep timbre of the voice offered comfort in a way he’d never thought possible.
Sherlock washed John with a new found vigor, scrubbing the teen’s hair with his one good hand. John leaned back in the tub, enjoying Sherlock’s touches so much his hands fell away from cupping himself to rest on his lower stomach.
Sherlock continued to stare at John, apparently seeing right through him. John lowered his eyes, unable to face the scrutiny he was being placed under, until Mycroft took mercy on him and pinched his brother’s neck. “I believe I told you to go back to your room, Sherlock Holmes. Don’t make me order you.” That caught the younger Dom’s attention, startling him out of the trance he seemed to be in.
Sherlock almost agreed. He was so close to believing John had realized what threats lay out in the world if he didn’t stay at Baker Street. However, this was just too important to leave any loose ends open, so the Detective made his move. “Hmm,” he scratched his chin, moving to step around John, “I’m not so sure. Children observe many things adults dismiss as superfluous. Young Archie could have seen something that will lead us to the person who murdered his parents.”
John’s eyes grew wide at the new revelation. He remembered that name, remembered it very well indeed. “Why?” he asked, confused even more as to why someone who instant messaged him so long ago had kidnapped him and taken him to an abandoned warehouse.
John watched the ceiling panels go by one after the other, noting how white they were. While he was still staring at the ceiling, something strange happened to his vision. Green text started to appear out of nowhere. “Wha’?” he tried, but his tongue felt too heavy to move.
Sherlock was about to tell Mycroft about the tracker, when a knock came from the front door. His hope wanted it to be John, but the image on his phone indicated his boy was in some sort of warehouse ten kilometers away. He went to the door and opened it to find a manila folder. “Hold on,” Sherlock said to his brother as he picked up the folder and pulled out the contents.
“Oh yes you are,” Sherlock countered moving down to kiss along the boy’s cheek and down to his collar bone. “And cute, and adorable, and smart, and cheeky,” he emphasized each compliment with a kiss until he got down to the armpit, “and stinky!” John panicked, realizing his breath must smell awful, along with his armpits and his greasy hair.
“But what? He wants to stay with me doesn’t he, wait for me ‘til the end of time?” Sherlock smiled broadly at the slight crinkle in Mycroft’s eye that told him he was right.
“Sorry, here let me clean you up, yeah. Then we can go snuggle before bed.” John nodded slowly, exhausted from having two orgasms, and let Sherlock move him around like a rag doll. “I promise it won’t hurt next time, love, you know I would never intentionally put you through pain. That’s just how it always feels the first time, understand?”
The dark woman blanched at the name and John knew instantly that he would not find any help here at this crime scene. He sighed in relief, his body relaxing of its own accord.
“They know your name Sherlock, John told one of his friends, a Mike Stamford, that he met a ‘Uni boy’ in London named Sherlock that he was going to go visit.”
“Not yet, wait, yes, I know this name? There, wait for him to make first contact,” Sherlock said, placing his fingers under his chin and waiting for the fish to bite.
“It’s alright, you’re alright,” Sherlock kept repeating, though John thought it might have been more to himself then to the teen. “The bleeding’s not stopping. We need to get him down to medical, and fast.”
“You-you’re the only reason I’m okay,” he moaned, feeling a third finger, knowing this morning was going to be one of the gently ones, as Sherlock put his hands under John’s armpits and turned him around so the boy was straddling his hips. That beautiful blue fog entered his mind, ensuring everything was okay and safe while he was in his lover’s arms.
“Just stay here, I’ll be back,” Sherlock whispered as he pulled the covers up to his panting chest, giving a quick kiss to his lips when John whined in frustration and confusion. Surprisingly, the thought that a stranger was down stairs didn’t enter his mind until Sherlock threw his pajamas back on and ran out of the room.
“Sir?” John asked, confused by the statement. It didn’t feel any different from when Mycroft made him put it around his neck.
Suddenly, John couldn’t breathe. He tried to gulp in air through his mouth but the leather only allowed a straw full and his nose wasn’t doing the trick either. His chest felt like it was on fire, he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe, and they were going to sell him to God knows who and he would never be able to get back to his sister. He was going to die at the hands of some filthy sadistic Dom and-“John! Breathe!” The command came, and this time, John’s brain followed the order without hesitation, latching on like a starving cat. As if following Sherlock’s words at a biological level, John’s sinuses cleared up and he was able to gather enough oxygen with each breath to stop his lungs from panicking. “That’s it, good boy, just keep breathing,” his tone was light as he gently rested his hand on the back of John’s head.
“John, look at me,” the boy did, staring into the dark eyes of the Inspector, “I need you to be honest with us, okay? It is very important that we get the real story of what happened between you and Sherlock. We want to help you both, John.”
“Sherlock,” he broke away from the deepening kiss, “what happened? Wh-why am I here and not in a hospital? Where is my mum?” John watched the man’s eyes carefully, trying and failing not to lower his gaze and watch the swollen lips that had sucked him off the night before.
“Leave me alone, Sherlock! I want to call Mycroft, he said I could call him whenever I wanted. Now get off of me!” John thrashed as Sherlock carried him up to their bed, easily controlling and dodging the swinging limbs. It might be best to call his brother but first, he wanted to see if being in their bed would calm the boy enough so Sherlock could work out the true origin of this outburst.
“Sherlock offered to take away your pushups, resulting in you losing the ability to do them yourself. Does that make sense?” John mulled it over for a good three minutes before finally, a spark of life came back into the eyes.
“That’s the funny part,” John said and looked up to meet Harry’s bewildered gaze. “The Doms who took her and I in, well, they aren’t that bad.”
This chapter is a bit bloody, but nothing too bad. Sorry it's a tad short, but I'm going to try and get another chapter out tomorrow as well(:
Finally, a hand on the back of his head stopped the pain completely, sending a rush of pleasure through his neck and back. “Easy now, John,” it was the younger man’s voice, John though but couldn’t quite tell with his face still pressed to the ground with drool leaking from his lips.
He looked at the number but he didn’t recognize the caller. “Mycroft Holmes speaking,” he answered, pressing the button to call Anthea into the room.
Mycroft had collapsed in pleasure, which was perfect, Sherlock’s brain supplied; now, his blood source couldn’t flee from him. The vampire hummed in pleasure, the blood flowing into his mouth, into his heart, into his limbs, and into his cock made him suck greedily with the intent of draining his brother dry.
Mycroft, who still thought he could scare John with his eyes, went over to examine his brother. “He’s alright?”
John looked at him in confusion, trying desperately to identify the man who had apparently kidnapped him. “That’s okay, you only know me by my user name, StripedTiger.”
“John, do you know what Stockholm Syndrome is?” John shook his head slightly, wondering if it was a Swedish reference. “It is a term coined in the seventies, to describe an emotional and psychological phenomenon in a hostage or captive situation. In 1973, there was bank robbery at Norrmalsmstorg Square in Stockholm, Sweden that lasted six days. Do you know what happened when the police finally captured the two robbers and saved the hostages?”
When the realization hit him like a ton of bricks, John paled and hung up the phone with a loud bang. When the secretary looked at him curiously, he smiled and said, “wrong number. Actually, my mom texted me and said she just pulled up. Thanks for letting me use your phone.”
Within another minute, John could hear shouting from around the house, panicked voices filled the front yard as the neighbors realized someone’s house was on fire.
As he looked through John’s file, Mycroft sighed at the picture of the young innocent boy who had no idea what he’d just stepped into. Blonde hair, blue eyes, athlete, decent grades, virgin, father: deceased, mother: a closet alcoholic, homosexual interests: 79%, heterosexual interests: 20%, asexual interests: 1%, isolated, and lonely…yes, John was the perfect lamb for the black wolf to grab by the throat and drag into its cave. What, with the promise of a better life, to be cared for and protected, a little mental manipulation, and there was no denying his little brother’s sexual attractiveness, especially to a young boy still discovering himself, physically and emotionally. When Mycroft looked down at that page of statistics, he knew John Watson didn’t stand a chance.
“Why-why would you say that? You don’t know,” the boy’s words were strong even though they were high pitched due to his stuffy nose.
“Oh, is he the one Molly always talks about? She’s such a sweetheart, I love when Mr. Lestrade brings her in when he’s working. Actually, I believe he brought her in today, they should be up in his office.” At this, John looked up, making eye contact with the woman, which was apparently a very big mistake. Electricity ran through his collar, and John was just lucky his knees were already on the floor. Suddenly, tingling warmth started to drown out the pain as he was being pushed under by Sherlock’s Bliss. As soon as it was there though, it was gone with a stern look from Mycroft.
“Worth it?” John asked, confused. He knew what it was like having a collar on his neck, and it most certainly was not worth it.
“Gregory, welcome,” Mycroft said, opening the door to let the man into the living room. “Please have a seat. Devon is brewing some tea as we speak.”
“I love you too,” Sherlock repeated, but knew his words fell on deaf ears, as the boy was already asleep. He loved John more than anything in the world, and now they would be together. Forever.
“We needed to get the history report for Jim’s collar. We should be able to track where he was as long as the Resistance hasn’t take precautions for such a thing,” Mycroft said, removing his hand from Sherlock’s knee.
“’M fine,” John said groggily, his mouth not working quite right. Sherlock chuckled and pushed John’s head back up so he could get out of the car.
Sherlock put a hand on both his wrists and lifted them slowly into the air, letting them stop just above his head. “Don’t move,” Sherlock instructed, his voice like honey to John’s ears and…
“With you it is. John, for some reason being around you is different than the other men I’ve been with. You are so young and vibrant and just so much wiser beyond your years…you’re perfect John. I just wish I could make you see that.”
“Like what?!” Lestrade yelled back, but the mysterious man was already getting into a cab. The DI scratched his head in confusion but knew Sherlock was always right, so he had the knife sent off for printing.
“I must have missed the class where they said, ‘hey when you have anal sex make sure to hit the prostate ‘cause it feels amazing.’” Suddenly, he felt John relax and enjoy what was being given to him and added in a third finger for the final step before he would take him. “Ahhh, no Sherlock that’s too much, wait ‘stop!’” He heard John yell but he knew everything was fine and his boy was just scared of what was happening. Soon he would be begging Sherlock to fill him up.
“Who were you talking to?” the boy’s face was bright red. Sherlock could tell he’d been crying and exerting a tremendous amount of effort to move around the room.
When he finally pulled himself down from the blissful high, he grabbed his mobile to plan their meeting now that John was out of the shower and getting dressed.
There was a stench of rust and old metal in the air, completing the entire look of an old abandoned warehouse. As he walked farther in, Sherlock saw John, his beautiful brave John, tied to a chair in the middle of the vast room. Another man paced back and forth in front of John, his reddish brown hair giving away his identity immediately.
Embarrassed again, the teenager tried to pull away from the intense gaze of his friend, but the hold on his chin didn’t loosen. He saw something else while staring in those bright eyes, lust and…something else, something John couldn’t quite put his finger on, but it made all the blood in his brain go down to his lower regions. “I-I just don’t know what I’m feeling…no I don’t mean that I just-ugh, I’m sorry.” If he couldn’t even get the situation straight in his head, he knew there was no way he would be able to articulate his feelings to Sherlock. All the boy could do was close his eyes and pray that the only person who had ever taken this much interest in him wouldn’t drive him back to his home in Southampton and never call again.
“Ohh, testy are we?” The man lifted his eye brows as the smile on his face grew darker. “I haven’t seen you this worked up since Victor. How many years ago was that, three, four? Hmmm, that didn’t work out to well for you, now did it?”
The fourteen year old was so caught up in stroking himself he hadn’t realized his phone buzzed with another text until a second one came.
“Yes?” Sherlock looked down at the deep blue eyes peering out, noting the seriousness in the boy’s features.
