Anderson’s eyes widened in surprise as the taller man continued.
She giggled at Sherlock’s wide grin.  “Mycroft would get really exasperated with us,” she continued, “but he never complained to his parents.  I think he secretly enjoyed being included in the fun.”
“Oh, no,” Emily said.  “Sherlock refused to have anything to do with me after I left in 1984; never replied to any of my letters to him, wouldn’t take my phone calls.  We haven’t seen each other since Sherlock was ten.”
“Find another way, Sherlock.”
“Good boy.”

“Because they’re not really your area.  Your interest lies in a different direction.”
Harry’s bags, John moved out that afternoon.

Still grinning, he turned back towards his friend, who sighed dramatically. “Yes, John,” he said in resignation. “I’ll find a way for you to talk to

“Yes, I know you’re proud too, but
“Don’t shut yourself in your room,” he pleaded.  “Stay out here.  You know I’m not going to push, so I’ll say it just the once: I’m here if you want to talk.”
He paused momentarily, then began to cackle hysterically.
“I’m going to kill you,” John told him straight-faced. “You’ve survived all this time, and now I’m going to kill you where you stand.”
“What?” John asked.
~~~~~~~~~
“He asked me to keep an eye on you tonight,” he confirmed, “but I wasn’t planning on going out anyway.  Are you okay?”
“Did I ask your opinion?”
Barely opening his lips, Sherlock mumbled five syllables.
It’s hard being a genius, with a mind that never stops working even when it has nothing to work on. The sheer frustration of knowing he is smarter than everybody around him – that there’s nobody with whom he can spar on an equal level – makes him want to scream with rage sometimes.

And John didn’t have the faintest idea what the hell he was going to do about it.
writers and so, although they each posted the stories in their own Livejournal blogs and may have possibly transferred them to AO3 since, I just felt it might not be appropriate to include them in this collection.
John spoke softly, concerned about the anxious look on Sherlock’s face.  “Being with you, I’m more joyful than I’ve ever been in my life.  Let me prove it ...”
“Sorry, what?”  Sherlock frowned at John’s latest strange utterance.
“Mmm,” Sherlock agreed vaguely, then frowned but still didn’t look up. “Is that your attempt at humour?” he asked.
don’t care about that, I do, and I won’t let someone else get hurt trying to help you.”
Sherlock opened his mouth. He was probably about to correct John over the number of seconds he had been indoors; and if he did, John was going to punch him very hard indeed and this time he
Anderson glowered at him and continued to the door, opening it and going inside before closing it softly and turning towards the bed. He was far more comfortable with dead bodies than he was with live patients, and he fought hard not to flinch at the sight of both of Sherlock’s arms bandaged from his hands all the way up to his elbows. Sherlock was awake but didn’t react in any way to his arrival. Anderson wasn’t even sure if he knew who had come into the room; his gaze was fixed on the ceiling and the lack of expression in his eyes was painful to see. Sherlock Holmes – annoying as he was – was always such a blaze of frenetic energy whenever he was around and it was frightening to see him so still and quiet and pale and ... lost.
what he would say if he were here, but you haven’t let yourself think about it. You’ve thought about nothing but finding and dealing with his killer, and once you had done that, you decided you had nothing more to do and it was all right to take your own life.”
--------------------
“But you kept in touch all these years,” he said.
“Go away.”
He had been arguing with the tall man with the umbrella for the last fifteen minutes and didn’t seem to be getting any closer to gaining admission into the hospital room. Anderson was becoming increasingly convinced that the man didn’t even work at the hospital, and certainly neither he nor the attractive woman beside him with her eyes permanently locked onto her BlackBerry looked like the usual type of administrative staff to be found at this hospital.
They looked at each other sadly for a long moment, then John carefully cleared his throat.
“Oh,” John said. He turned and blinked innocently at Sherlock. “So does that mean that the best laid men have mice and schemes?”

And then he’s back at school, on his knees in the playground, his books scattered around him where they’ve been dumped out of his bag, and the big boys and their leader are sneering at him while the playground monitor turns a blind eye. He blinks rapidly, determined not to cry, and the fury grows inside him.

The day went downhill from there.
She waved off Sherlock’s scowl and winked at John when he couldn’t help but smile.  Then her face became serious.  “You’re chasing him through the streets and end up in some godforsaken back alley.  He turns and fires a gun towards you, and your friend goes down.  The man’s running off again and you know that if he gets away he’ll almost definitely kill more people.  But you look back and see that your partner is on the ground, covered with blood.  There are no police officers around and you’re not even sure whether he can manage to use his phone.  But that man will
Opening his mouth to give the obvious answer, John hesitated. He didn’t actually want to go home. Back at the flat he would either face a peeved flatmate who would want to continue the argument, or be greeted with a petulant and silent sulk. Neither of those options appealed to him but now that he considered it, he had nowhere else to go. He definitely wasn’t going to Harry’s; and any of his friends – although they would surely be willing to give him a bed for the night or even for a few days – would either ask pointed questions or keep a diplomatic silence which would be even more irritating.
“His name is Saint Bartholomew,” Sherlock said pompously.
thing and he’ll be able to help others when he gets older, so why are they so horrible to him? Don’t they realise he might be something brilliant, like a doctor, and save their lives one day?
“You took a lot of notice of what the client’s daughter was holding,” John commented.  “Did you have one when you were a kid?”
Sherlock glared at her.  “I don’t care.  I don’t need you.  I won’t

to be a 221 with such an obvious ‘b’ word at the end), I realised that if John gave Sherlock a bear, Sherlock would behave as if he wasn’t interested but would secretly be thrilled, and would name it in honour of the place where he and John first met.
Again he tried to tug Anderson away but again the other man resisted him, protesting, “Leave off, guv! I’m talking to Mike!”

“Just for once in my sodding life can I have
John stared.  Sherlock wasn’t meeting his eyes; he was perched on the front of the sofa and was fiddling awkwardly with a loose thread on the blanket draped over its arm.
“I’ve never felt so alive.”
Sherlock winced against the pain in his chest and tried to settle more comfortably on the hospital bed.
“It’s all right,” Greg told him as John’s throat tightened.  “She’ll understand better than anyone.  Mrs Turner’ll take care of her tonight, and we’ll check up on her tomorrow.”  He put the car in gear and pulled out into the traffic.
He opened the door to his wardrobe and smiled with delight.  Still sitting on the shelf inside was John’s ridiculous gift, proof of their friendship, proof that John cared, the pointless foolish ludicrous and soppy present which Sherlock had tried not to love but nevertheless did, and had named accordingly.
In the hospice, Emily lay back against the pillows, exhausted but pleased with herself that she had managed to hide her pain from her visitors.  Well,
I feel about them?” Sherlock demanded. “You threw yourself in front of me to protect me from the explosion in the factory; you were willing to sacrifice yourself, and I won’t ever forgive you for risking your life just for me.  I’m  angry at seeing you so damaged.  Those scars shouldn’t be there. You got them by being more noble and selfless than I could ever be, and they make me feel ashamed.  I intend to spend practically every waking moment ensuring that the rest of Moriarty’s network is taken down so that they’ll never endanger you again.”
She patted his hand.  “It’s all right,” she said gently.
heed the warnings first.
Mrs Holmes nodded her understanding and looked down at her notes before raising her head again.  “You understand that we’d need you to come in every week day afternoon during school term time, from three o’clock until seven thirty?” she asked.
“Too much heart,” Mycroft scoffed into the empty of the stairwell, “that was always Sherlock’s problem.”
Anger welled up in the pit of his stomach, “You let him make a fucking demon deal?”
” This was far worse than any pirate he saw later on that evening.
“Fine. Then let's make a deal. Ten years and then, you come collect.”
April Fools.
On December 23rd it hit John that he had forgotten the sound of Sherlock’s violin. He so desperately wanted to go to their old flat and grab a tape to listen to for Christmas, but he couldn’t. He hadn’t been back there since a few days after the fall. So he gave in and called Sherlock once again. “I miss your violin.”
“Ah, I see. So,” Sherlock gazed guiltily at the counter where he had set all of the goods he intended to steal. He cleared his throat, drawing his attention back up to the being that presented itself before him wracking his brain for what he should say in the silence, “what should I call you?"
“I’m unattached if you were worried,” Sherlock couldn’t stop the compulsive words from slipping from his mouth and he turned bright red. John coughed and looked up from his position standing before his charge as those full, pink lips spread and spoke once more, “and my address is 221B Baker Street.”
It was like that sometimes, for Sherlock. The world became, all of a sudden, too loud to handle. He ached to cover his ears and curl into a ball, but his hands were wrapped around his brother and covered in blood and his body couldn’t curl any further with the dead weight in his lap. He cried out again, and in that split second heard it clearer than ever.
voice, the one that had been a ball of light just moment before, “The one who gripped you tight and pulled you from perdition.”
, he supposed. John frowned at this last thought of his. Sherlock was now past tense. And, as John lived in the present, he felt further from Sherlock than he had this entire time of grieving.
A man stood before him wearing a wiry Christmas sweater and looking stern, even more soldier-like than his older brother tried to present as.
“John.” Sherlock spoke, more softly than he had intended, “It suits you. Fit for a military man. One of heaven that is.”
Howls encroached on him as he stood alone and felt the fan of hot breath around his feet before searing pain overloaded each nerve in his body and he was torn to shreds by hounds of Hell.
“Sunshine?” Lestrade's voice called from the bottom of the stairs and, though faint, Sherlock beamed, pleased with the prospect of what might have happened in his absence.
John just nodded and Sherlock stepped out from behind him to kneel beside his brother.
Lestrade had dropped off a box of Sherlock’s things; a DVD caught John’s eye. He poured himself a drink and placed the disc in the player.
Mycroft quirked his head a bit, “Why would I not be-”
“I called you. 59 times, Sherlock. 59 times. Just once you could have answered. I told you so much in those calls, Sherlock, so much.”
What Moriarty hadn’t expected was the pure rivalry and evil that some of his participants harboured for one another. He thought a bit of jealousy might arise, but he certainly hadn’t planned on them turning on one another and doing the slaughtering with their own hands. But ah, someone had told him once that intellect was a curse, not a blessing-- he should have listened. Then again, as much as he liked stripping sheets of skin off of his victims, he was climbing up the ladder in the demon world, and he was starting to enjoy the whole ‘orchestrate everything, but keep your own hands clean’ deal.
Nowadays, I like to make up little crime narratives in my head about the patients I see.
The sound of the door at the bottom of the stairs startled Mycroft from his sleep. He knew Mrs. Hudson was out for the day and Greg wasn’t meant to be home for at least an hour. His bones shook at the thought that it could be Moriarty, back to reclaim his soul and drag him into doing his dirty work.
John struggled to reply, his mind still riddled with thoughts of words left unsaid, “Yeah, yeah, me? Fine. I am fine.”
tonight, she knows I’d rather not, but she insisted it’d be good for me. Sometimes she really thinks she knows better. She knew it would bring you back to me, that it’d be sheer torture for me, but she said I need to get over it all.
“I-I-I- I didn’t know.”
Nearly two years before, no one could have told Sherlock that his brother would go out like this, especially since they hadn’t been on speaking terms, not until the night Sherlock decided to retrieve Mycroft from his small office job within the government and thrust him back into the world of monster hunting.
Call forty-one was a simple “I’m growing a mustache, Sherlock. Not sure you’d like it, but life goes on.”
Once over, his wool Belfast jacket stuck with the job of straddling the chain link fence for padding, Sherlock shook out his curls and looked back to Lestrade, who was leaned against the car, waiting dutifully for Sherlock and Mycroft’s return. He gave a curt nod in the direction of the silver-haired man and headed into the complex. Despite the ringing of
Someone who was not Sherlock Holmes.
The pavement felt smooth under the tires of the glistening, black car, Sherlock’s blue scarf flapping out of the window in the wind. His curls were almost too long for him to drive safely with the windows down, but Greg had insisted, with a fond pat to the side of the car, “Windows down and music blasting, that’s the way to enjoy this baby.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at that but smiled as he had lowered himself into the driver's seat before Greg could see.
He stood from where he had been slouched down, napping in Sherlock’s old chair, and wrapped a silk robe he got for Christmas around his body. He grabbed the gun that hung over the mantle and snuck around the corner to peak out of the doorframe that gave him a straight shot down the stairs.
, but along with candy, I gave them each a deerstalker that fans had sent before you-- just…
With Mycroft beside him now, he wrapped the Belstaff properly around his dear friend and hoisted him into the backseat as Sherlock army crawled his way under the fence as well. He was grateful that his coat had made it so he didn’t have to drag his belly along bloodied ground.
“No, but seriously. When you were dead, I went to your grave.”
The woman only licked her lips and shook her head.
He reached down and placed his fingers on Mycroft’s forehead and suddenly, all the chaos, the conflict, the resistance, fled from within him. He looked up with wide eyes, far too innocent looking for a man of his age, but he couldn't help himself.
“There’s a case here for you. Just, come back. Come back, please.” and with a broken voice, John hung up. Call five took John straight to voicemail, he supposed Sherlock's phone did have to die eventually.
“Today’s the day, isn’t it, Sherlock, the day that you didn’t come back. I never thought you would stay...dead. I just, I wish you weren’t. Somehow.”
“-lock? Sherlock.” Lestrade’s voice pulled him out of his trance, and he realized he had been stewing all the way up to the curb in front of his and Mycroft’s flat.
“M’sorry it’s been so long Sherlock. Life has been so busy with work and family and now Mary, of course. But it’s June now, and I reckon I’ll be calling more often now. I’ve been dreading June.
His eyes snapped up, wide and shaking with anger and fear and sorrow, to see Anderson stumble around the far corner of the hall.
Sherlock mentally smacked himself for being so incredibly transparent, but then again, caring had been at his advantage for once in his life. It had lifted him from hell, saved both him and his brother, saved two souls instead of one.
Sherlock only shook his head ‘no’ and drove.
Greg’s jaw dropped at the sight of Sherlock and Sherlock stood, moving towards his dear old friend and mentor. Greg pulled him into a gut-wrenching hug, entirely too tight, and despite the eye roll he shot Mycroft, he softened into it and laughed.
he sighed to himself.
With the shut of the back door, Greg entered and sat himself beside Sherlock in the front, gingerly closing his passenger door.
I like to think you probably did that when you were bored. In a sort of twisted way, it makes me feel closer to you.”
He snuck in and walked along the edge of the wall so as not to disturb the dust or the silence. Suddenly, in the hallway adjacent to him, a body rushed past, followed by another, one almost inhuman, screaming and leaping just out of view. Sherlock slowed his heart rate and said a silent prayer to a God he knew didn’t exist as he continued down the hall, this time moving a bit more swiftly. When he leaned forward to look around the corner, he nearly cried out, a man, wily and bearded was straddling his brother, a rusted metal rod, presumably, the blunt leg of a desk chair, held above his head and attempting to push down against Mycroft.
‘John? Who’re you talking to?’
John just tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hand and used his other hand to heal his forehead with a simple swipe.
“I’m sure you’d scold me on my choice, say it was unnecessary, but I’ve got to make up the difference in my love for her somehow. Fuck, that sounds cold.”
The ground around him was suspicious, but rather than stay and observing what looked like a blast site, he just committed it to memory and set off. His body needed water and he was going to get it.
He smiled at the angel by his side and popped the collar of his coat before pushing gently into the flat.
Sherlock looked eagerly at the angel that stood before him, the one that looked so beautiful both within his soft, kind vessel and without it, in his terrifying and awe-inspiring true form.
“I took Mary to your grave today. She wanted to see what it was like, wanted me to open up about what’d happened. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, share you with her I mean, but life goes on, and maybe it was good for me in the end. “
After a few hours of tinkering, it had worked, and soon, a distraught (but grateful) Sherlock was on his way with Greg Lestrade, owner of The Scotland Junk Yard, a run-down auto repair joint, in a 1967 Chevy Impala, imported from the States and practically the only car Greg had attempted to fully restore to its former glory.
Call twenty-one was meant to be lighthearted, but birth was, to John, just another reminder of death.
Sherlock and Greg parted to make way for the angel who Lestrade looked up and down and turned to Sherlock, “I like this one.”
“Greg. Where is he?” Mycroft asked sternly.
Sherlock
The angel smirked at him, “God’s work, Sherlock. Not mine. I am but a soldier in the battle for heaven’s souls.”
had reached out to Sherlock, he
John’s fifty-third call was to tell Sherlock he’d gotten Mary a ring.
Lestrade nodded like it was a normal occurrence, trying to ignore the pure terror he felt upon the realization that, of course, nothing that rose a man from the dead could be pure, could be without consequence.
moved to take his hand from its spot on his shoulder. Sherlock instinctually stopped that from happening by placing his own hand on top of John’s, caging it in.
Sherlock took in a shaky breath as he realized what she was saying.
He gazed at the register, blanking out into his thoughts for a moment before opening the register and taking what he would need to escape this hellhole in the middle of nowhere.
“It’s today, I’m proposing today. I’m finally at peace with it, with all of this. I really think it’s the right decision. Mary has turned my life around, made it bearable to survive without you, and I think that’s all I have to say on the matter.”
Sherlock just rolled his eyes and pushed his body closer to hers, “Bring my brother back.” he breathed through clenched teeth.
John sat in silence after he hung up the phone. It was time, he thought.
He turned to face the demon. A woman stood there, stark naked, save for a pair of black heels and lips as red as cherry pie. Her hair fell against her shoulders, black as the riding crop she held in her left hand.
“Yes, John, I listened.”
His forty-fourth call came after this contemplation. As always, he called to simply discuss his thoughts to an empty receiver, ask questions that would never be answered and pause in moments of silence to make up his own responses in his mind.
Mycroft was smart-- too smart for his own good apparently. That was overtly clear on this particular Tuesday, as well as during the preceding week.
“I was tempted to tell Mary about it. Maybe even take her for a meal, but that’s our place, that’s our memory.”
“Sorry about this.”
Sherlock just leaned into the shock of the affection and smiled into his brother’s thinning hair, “Better have been for good reason.”
“Where does an angel like you stay on earth?”
John tried with all of his might to not depend on him in those moments of memory, but the only times that truly mattered to him featured Sherlock Holmes.
shutupshutup
John looked up as the waiter persisted in his rabid champagne quest and that’s when he saw him.
However, the brief loss of his memories and with the hyperboles of his drunken mind, John became convinced that he had forgotten the sound of Sherlock’s voice.
He let out a frustrated, “No!” and abandoned post at his brother’s body, letting him fall gently into age-old dust. Sherlock ran so fast he nearly missed the turn and hit the wall ahead of him straight on. When he got to that particular turn, Anderson was still hobbling, nearly reaching the next turn. Sherlock took his knife out of its sheath and in one quick movement, with a reverberating ‘ching,’ flicked it full force at the man running from him. With a crack, it hit Anderson in the neck and he fell, limp, lifeless,
“Sherlock, you are going to tell me how you did it? How you jumped off that building and survived?”
Sherlock shook his head, “You.” He fumbled with his words and then, “Why?”
3 months. 3 God Damn months. How could he have possibly blacked out for so long?
Mycroft stood there, in awe, wondering what to say, or do, or ask, when the door downstairs opened again causing Mycroft to flinch. John spoke calmly towards him, “Just Greg. I can sense his soul. Greg is his name, yes?”
“A year sure solidifies things. Up until now, I really did hold out hope that you had some sort of plan, some sort of way out of the grave. But you- you’re gone and you aren’t coming back. You said goodbye to me over the phone so I suppose it’s my turn. Goodbye Sherlock. That’s all I have to offer, Sherlock. A goodbye.”
John scowls and looks away. “I’ve learned the hard way not to ever assume that someone you think you know is definitely not a murderer,” he says shortly, and begins eating again. His brain is a jumble of Mary, the case, Andrea Redding, and whatever is going on between him and Sherlock, though the last one hurts too much to think about directly. Not here. Not now.
There is another pause. “I… thought we’d done with that,” Mycroft says carefully.
“What are you – ?” Sherlock goes willingly, though, not resisting John, and John sees that his cock is flushed dark and lying flat up against his torso, it’s so hard.
Sherlock is still looking at Aston curiously, but gives him a slow smile. “Understood,” he says. “And seconded: thank you. This may be exactly what we needed.”
, Sherlock,” he adds snidely.
I’m confused. “What? What do you mean?”
He stops, and suddenly John guiltily wonders if he’s somehow made Sherlock think of his childhood friend again. “Sorry,” he says, quieter. “I didn’t – I’m just worried.”
“All right, then. But we have to figure out what to do with Rosie. Mrs Hudson is out.”
He studies John’s erection up close for a moment. “This is everything I imagined and more,” he pronounces, and John’s heart gives an impossibly even-bigger throb.
And so he falls a second time.
“There you are,” Sherlock tells them. “So: whoever this is will be looking for a six-year-old next. Get looking!”
Mycroft looks at Sherlock, even while reaching into his retinue and drawing out a large manila envelope and passing it to John. “Doctor Watson. This is for you,” he says, transferring his gaze to John at last.
“I’m not objecting,” he says, trying not to sound awkward. That was hopeless. He clears his throat and tries again. “That is… that would be – nice.”
Mrs Hudson types back at once.
He’s never asked anyone this before, never dreamed of offering himself this way, but he wants it – he knows that perfectly well right now. He wants it very much, and he wants it from exactly one person, right here and right now. Sherlock’s breath catches. “Wh – why are you… I – ” He stops, seeming confused about what to say.
Sherlock looks over at him. “You don’t look or smell disgusting, but go ahead,” he says mildly.
. “You’re now a millionaire. Don’t spend it all in one place.”
“Oh.” John gets it. “Right. Okay.”
John smiles at him and gets to his feet, stretching so that an inch of his flat stomach shows beneath his shirt. “You’re the best,” he says. “Thank you.”
He’s still home, and looks startled to see Sherlock’s stern face at the door again. “H-hello,” he says nervously, looking Sherlock up and down, his eyes flicking anxiously over to me. “What’s going on, then?”
I don’t give in. “Well, do you?” I ask stubbornly.
From just over John’s shoulder, Sherlock speaks for the first time. “You would really do that?” He’s cold, colder than John’s ever heard him. “You’d have your own infant daughter assassinated?”
John looks slightly sheepish. “Right, yeah,” he says. “I’ll try. I promise I’ll try to do better at the talking thing.”
“I did.” John opens his menu, avoiding eye contact. “I read about it in one of the reviews I saw. Shall we decide what we’d like to eat?” he proposes, neatly changing the topic.
Andrew and Avi both raise their hands, and so do a few other couples, and Todd opens up a discussion on this. The entire thing is enlightening and informative, and Sherlock feels decidedly glad that they came. They’re sent off thirty minutes before lunch is to be served and find themselves in the courtyard with Justin, Thom, Andrew, and Avi. Sherlock stretches out in a long deck chair, his eyes closed under the overhead sun, John next to him in a matching chair.
John makes an interested sound, but his eyes are closed again. “In a moment,” he says. “Tea can’t compete with this. With waking up with you for the first time.”
He cannot speak but John understands anyway. “Like this?” he asks, his voice rough with a mixture of emotion and desire. “On your front?”
Sherlock glances at him from beneath his lashes. “What have you done with Rosie today?” he asks obliquely.
Oh. This eases the tightness very slightly. “All right,” Sherlock says, though it’s still cautious. “After supper, then. How late are they open?”
Sherlock looks at him. “Have you thought at all about what you’d like to do, once we get back?” he asks, his expression a bit careful.
I shrug. “Maybe he thinks he’s being clever.”
Sherlock shrugs. “There’s no point going into it. Not now. It’s long over.”
Sherlock looks at John, then shakes his head. “No, I don’t think so. We might hike down to the bridge and just have a look around, see what things look like. Has it snowed? Will we need special footwear or anything? We’ve brought hiking boots.”
Finally the tightness eases and Sherlock nods, making a sound of encouragement, and John begins for real now, setting up a slow but steady rhythm of rocking into him. Half the pleasure is the psychological knowledge of having John there within him, but now the purely physical is taking over. He moves his hands to John’s sides and back, stroking, then, as his need grows, grasps John’s arse with both hands and pulls him in as deeply as he can. John is moaning and thrusting hard now. He shifts very slightly and his penis starts rubbing against Sherlock’s prostate on every stroke and the pleasure doubles, trebles, turning to molten silver in his nervous system and shivering down his spine. He hears himself making rather a lot of noise.
“Safe and sound,” he promises. “They haven’t even left the envelope. One digital copy was made and it’s been destroyed.”
Sherlock makes a sound of negation. “Just tell him that I’ll try to be in touch tomorrow. We’ll have wrapped this by then, probably. Don’t say that, though.”
John looks at him in astonishment. “Your family went to church?!”
“Let’s have the berries with lunch,” Sherlock suggests.
John presses his lips together, lest he say something he really shouldn’t. “I’m glad,” he says, carefully light. He clears his throat, which probably gives the entire game away. Maybe it would be safer to talk about the food, after all. “You still up for going round to a shop or two after this? The weather’s nice…”
He erratically raced to a familiar crossroad ahead and came screeching to a halt when he was within walking distance. He grabbed the box he had prepared from the passenger seat and exited the car with purpose. He took ten paces to the center of the crossroad and kneeled, digging furiously with leather gloves protecting his hands. Once he deemed the depth appropriate, he placed the box in its spot there and covered it with dirt and gravel, standing and clenching his fists to release the tension he felt gripping his soul.
She’s nice. Her name’s Mary, we met through work and I think she’s going to be very good for me.”
“Mycroft.” Greg sighed, “you didn’t see him. His heart was completely broken.”
“No, Mycroft.” Sherlock looked over his shoulder and he saw another man enter from the entry, calm and steady, “This is John, he’s an angel.” Sherlock reached his hand out for John to take in his, “He pulled me from hell.”
The next time John called it was because he’d just walked by Angelo’s.
That was call thirty-one.
“What do you want?” Sherlock snapped.
Understanding his situation, one he would rather not have to deal with, being buried alive and all, he quickly shut the metal lid of his lighter, not wanting to waste a single more breath of oxygen on the small fire. He noticed his scarf had returned around his neck, which he promptly used to cover his nose and mouth to avoid any dirt intake, and quickly began to kick up against the end of the box, splintering the wood and letting the dirt build at his feet. When it became looser, he pushed the top of the coffin up with a huge amount of force and pushed the dirt that fell in down to his toes. Slowly, he maneuvered his body into a crouching position in the loosened dirt and stood, the brightness of the morning sky too much after such physical deprivation of light.
“Yeah,” he spoke, still holding Mycroft’s soft hand in his, “yeah, it’s me.”
Finally, he stood, feeling naked without his coat, and took off his scarf, wiping it over his face, and then his red palms, throwing it to his side without any regard when he was done.
Moriarty knew these bright, young minds would either end up in the British Men of Letters, a natural enemy of all things demonic, or find some way or another to use their intellect against him. So, he rounded up the 99th percentile and threw them in a ring together, seeing who could figure it out first, who would resist least, who would ultimately win out against his competitors and serve him-- and then he’d burn the rest.
Mycroft gazed down at their latched hands before surveying the room, “What happened?”
Sherlock tightened his grip on the steering wheel, “What’s burned stays dead Greg, you know that.”
He licked his lips and gave a single nod, “Thank you for staying with me.”
Mycroft looked up at his brother, so clearly smitten already with the man -the angel- that stood beside him. He smiled, pushing down the pain that came with seeing Sherlock after mourning him for so long. He stood finally and motioned towards the living room where Sherlock took a seat on the couch, if only to leave room for John to sit beside him. John took him up on the offer, sitting gently beside him.
“Fine. five.”
Upon reaching steady ground and stretching up, he rubbed his forehead as a loud, sharp pain struck him, but he ignored it and began the trek to civilization.
“I keep meaning to call Mrs. Hudson. I know you’d probably be pretty pissed at me if you knew I hadn’t phoned her. Anyways, I saw her today, from the end of an isle at the grocer’s. As soon as I saw her, I slipped away, hopefully unseen. I knew it would hurt all over again if I went to greet her.”
Sherlock steps out from the shadows behind the monument. “John.”
Sherlock’s mother says, sounding excited, “But then, do you see? That would just make us officially Rosie’s grandparents! It all just makes so much sense, doesn’t it?” She falters a little and looks to Sherlock’s father for support.
“Which increases the chances that he’s still waiting for other members of the cell to arrive,” John points out. He looks at Sherlock. “You think he’ll leave the station to meet them, don’t you?”
Sherlock’s response is non-verbal but decidedly affirmative, and they make their way down the corridor to their bedroom, stripping off each other’s clothes with hungry hands, and Sherlock has just enough passing thought to think that it was all right in the end: he did all right with remembering Rosie. If it had gone sideways, the entire wedding might be off at this point. But it isn’t: John actually allowed himself to weep in front of him for only the second time in their entire history. Sherlock thinks of those raw words about bleeding out and feels intensely grateful that John was willing to be that open about it in front of him, letting him inside it, letting him hold him through it. He feels closer to John than ever, and is glad.
“Always.” Mrs Hudson smiles at him. “So how will you know when to go back to your own bed? Will you just wait until he asks you to, or tells you that he’s all right on his own again?”
John struggles not to laugh. “Er, no. She’ll be eighty this autumn.”
“It’s more the body parts in the fridge that I mind,” John says dryly, which makes the others laugh. “While the science equipment all over the table is annoying, I do realise that it’s for your work. It’s important.”
I feel my eyebrows jag up at that. “I definitely want to know,” I say, and lean in to kiss him.
Kyle steps up to the podium as they kiss again and gets everyone’s attention, suggesting they find their seats and that perhaps the grooms could make their way to the head table at their leisure, and that dinner would be underway in a few minutes, so they make their way without haste through the crowd to the head table on its slight platform. They had two attendants, just Mycroft and Lestrade, but invited Todd and Kyle to sit at the head table as officiate and MC respectively, as well. They sit down at the two-person padded bench in the centre of the table, which has been draped in white fur.
“Who or what is DirectCom Incorporated?” John asks.
“Now, if we’ve
Sherlock picks up his serviette and wipes the chocolate away, nodding. “Yes. Very.” His eyes go to the chocolate torte, the top and back covered with a thick layer of rich-looking ganache. “What else did you find?”
“Yes.” Mycroft does not tell him how he knows; to tell him would be to say too much. “If you go, you will leave the child behind. I can tell you that where you would be going is no safe place for a child of Rosie’s age. She will be looked after.”
Sherlock and Irene both look at him, Irene surprised and slightly put out, Sherlock intense and unreadable. John’s eyes are locked to Sherlock’s for a single, breathtakingly loaded moment, then Sherlock looks back at Irene, creases forming between his eyebrows and at the bridge of his nose as he frowns. “
John takes the hint and reaches over to turn out the lamp, then shifts over to wrap himself around Sherlock in the safety of the darkness, revelling in being allowed to do this again. It’s already been too long since last night, exacerbated by having to consciously not touch Sherlock too much in front of Lestrade and his crew during the day. The odd, sexual tension from recent nights seems to have faded in light of the case, too, which is good. John doesn’t care about any of that right now, anyway. All he wants is this: to be holding Sherlock exactly the way he is. “Good night,” he says.
“Three,” Scott corrects, under his breath.
Mary closes the door behind Molly, then pushes her up against it, kissing her hard, harder than Molly would like, and tears spring unwillingly to her eyes. Mary doesn’t stop kissing her, her thumbs already wiping the tears away. She yanks Molly’s jumper up and kisses her tiny breasts through her bra, her fingers pressed to Molly’s mouth to keep her silent. She straightens up again with difficulty, the weight of her belly making her movements ponderous. She says, her hands still holding Molly by the face, “I know, darling, I know. But you can’t go pulling this stuff on me. You’ve got to be stronger than that. Any drama between us and the entire jig is up. I need you to play this part and play it well. Do you understand?”
versus what they might individually choose to do, then Sherlock hears that, too. “I don’t mind,” he adds. “But otherwise – just sticking around here, then?”
Sherlock still has his left arm around John’s shoulders. He tightens it and leans in to kiss John on the temple again. “Yes,” he says, his lips on John’s skin. “Problem?”
“I’m sorry, sometimes the weight of your loss is just too much Sherlock. I just…why did you have to jump? Why, Sherlock? I could have helped. Was I not enough? Was I nothing to you?” The calls, for John, were getting too hard. He was angry and he was lost. After the sixteenth call, John decided to give it a rest and go about life.
Barking in the distance grew closer as the kiss deepened and then, suddenly, his lips were free.
What were his motives in killing his brother?
Sherlock sighed, mocking shock and signaling to John to approach.
A love confession cut short by the beeping of a voicemail box that would never be cleared as it was filled up with messages that would never be heard.
Calls three and four were on the same day. John had finally emerged from his flat. He didn’t really want to go out, but milk grows sour and he wanted cereal. He admitted it was a bit sloppy to just be mourning with the company of alcohol and cereal, but he was convinced he was coping. In the moments before he turned the handle to open his door out into the world, John decided he needed Sherlock to help him. He pulled out his phone and quickly called. The voice spoke quickly, so John swung open the door as fast as he could and rushed out onto the sidewalk. He probably looked a bit odd rushing out of his place so quickly, but John avoided looking at anyone around who may have seen as he hurried off to the grocers.
He let the light of the fire only glare for a moment, within a second he knew where he was, the death sigils carved above him all too familiar.
“No sorry, not now.” John honestly couldn’t help but snicker at the fact that the universe was seemingly working against him at every turn, first Sherlock’s full voicemail box, and now the proposal? It seemed that life could not get any more absurd than in that moment,
Pulling his hand back, bloody and shaking
It was a Sunday when Sherlock came back from the dead, decidedly more human than he had ever been before.
“Today, I saw a man who looked a bit like Anderson. You would’ve loved seeing it, Sherlock. His eyes were all bulging out of his head and his facial hair was a mess. It wasn’t him of course, Anderson’s too much of a…you know. Anyways, if it had been him, it would probably have pleased you very much. All you really wanted in life, I’m sure. So, Happy Birthday Sherlock Holmes. You deserve it.”
He saw a shadow in the frost of the entry door that looked like-
Greg first caught sight of Sherlock in the floodlights that came on at nightfall coming around the corner of the nearest building and nearly melted with relief. Nearly. As quickly as that relief had flooded him, it dropped him from a cliff high above an arctic sea and as it crashed, so did he. Cold, broken, suddenly slammed down on his knees without explanation.
Not in a year.”
“Not dead.” For but a moment, Sherlock’s voice came back in to focus.
With that, Sherlock rushed past all the other buildings that sat crumbling in what felt like a tiny ghost town of concrete and metal and headed towards the education building where soldiers would study up during their short leaves from combat.
So, he dialed Sherlock. The phone rang incessantly until finally, after what John thought seemed like hours, he heard the familiar, soft, comforting sound of Sherlock’s voice. His drunken mind allowed him to chuckle at the voicemail as it was a clear creation of Holmes himself, but, John thought, indeed a colder reflection of who the man really was. Or
“Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes?” spoke a voice, deep and soft.
John didn’t know why, but he just couldn’t escape Sherlock Holmes. Over a year gone by and he was still stuck with Sherlock on his mind. Sure, he had moments where he forgot the pain, but then someone would come into his practice with a stain on their tie and he would wonder what Sherlock would deduce about them or other times he’d find himself ordering in Chinese food with Mary and her friends, and the fortune cookie he had gotten on the first night he spent with Sherlock would flash back to him and leave him breathless and alone amidst a group of chattering voices.
He managed to crack a small smile and he took a deep breath.
“Greg...” Sherlock heard Mycroft say, before hearing Greg take two steps at a time up the stairs in utter concern. Mycroft stepped back inside the living room, letting Greg follow him and take in the sight.
The glossy, black headstone on which the name “Sherlock Holmes” was etched in gold, stood out among a clutter of grey memorials. He stood before the stone, just as he had before, except this time he knelt down and placed a single white rose on the cold, February ground. “I’m always yours, Sherlock Holmes. I-“ But he couldn’t say it. He was certain he never would and that was all right with John Watson.
“Mycroft, you’re safe, I am an angel, here to watch over you and your brother.” John said and, Sherlock in tow, began walking up the stairs to where Mycroft had collapsed into himself against the wall in the landing. He was shaking and small and not at all as Sherlock had remembered him.
Sherlock Holmes was back.
Calls twenty-four through thirty were taken care of not long after.
He watched, numb, as Greg struggled to lay Mycroft down in the back seat and then shook his head, silently rounding the Impala and climbing into his usual place in the driver’s seat.
“I’m on my fifth drink and I should probably stop, but Jesus, fuck, it hurts so much without you. Please.”
The soothing violin of ‘Dust in the Wind’ filled all the blank gaps in Sherlock’s mind palace as he drove out, further and further from London, and into the green countrysides surrounding Sussex. When he reached the dirt path he was seeking, dawn was just beginning to stir.
The twenty-third call was answered.
Greg just pursed his lips and stood for the first time in hours, moving to Mycroft’s position in the doorway, gazing at the torn, bloody shirt that exposed his miraculously healed back, before enveloping him in a hug with a soft, "But you're okay and that's what matters." Mycroft froze at the contact, he and Lestrade had drifted since he moved out, but this, this hug felt all too much like
John noticed his calls were becoming short and casual. He couldn’t decide if it was because he was trying to distance himself from Sherlock or if he really was healing. He didn’t know how to tell the difference really, but it almost seemed like his calls were more casual now. Just an update here and a memory there, Sherlock would appreciate that, John thought.
It’s funny; anniversaries are so often a time for celebration, but not this one. To think that it’ll have been a yea-”
May 2nd brought call thirty-two. “I went for a date. I don’t think you’d like to know that, but I suppose not all is what we’d like it to be.
Amidst the joy and the sounds of stories being passed on, Mycroft looked over to catch Sherlock’s eyes, a knowing look pasted on his face.
in the detached tone of his brother’s voice that bounced around in his skull, Sherlock was not going to let his brother just die here.
Once outside, Sherlock jumped into the Impala and sped off faster than he ever had. He was used to only using the car on long hunting trips while opting for cabs when working in the heart of the city.
When did they snap, and what secret are they hiding?
Call six was nothing. Just a quick dial and hang up before he could hear the voicemail. John was determined he needed to just let go already.
“Oh it’s fine, but you’re stuck in the upstairs room now.”
Sherlock ignored all reason, because this simply wasn’t reasonable, and replied “Yes?”
He pushed himself up from the deep using the wood of his coffin to give him a slight advantage on the whole “six feet under” thing.
June 16th
Call fifteen was a rant. “Bloody hell, Sherlock. You knew what losing you would do to me. I’m slipping right back to where I was before you.”
Sherlock drowned out the sound of her wails and just gripped his brother tighter, finally reaching the first level of his flat and steering the body into the kitchen. Disregarding his own advice, he quickly swept all of his chemistry equipment and other clutter off of his table and sent it crashing to the floor as Greg helped him move Mycroft to lay there.
Lestrade backed up to the edge of the table as the older Holmes’ loomed over him
The fourth call
However, John did call on the 1st of April with the absurd hope that this all might be some intricate, twisted plan of Sherlock’s, but he was sent straight to voicemail and John hung up without a word. He knew it was absurd to even think that Sherlock might answer, but, he thought, what is life without hope.
fallen for her. She’s pretty ordinary, nothing like you really. She gets me out of the house, but for rather domestic things, like grocery shopping and buying new shoes. I think I just like having someone to ground me, to help keep my wits about me, but if you were here, I’d avoid her. She’s the key to the cookie cutter life I feared for so long before I met you. But, perhaps it’s time to settle down.”
“There’s just two of us here now, Holmes,” the man’s voice shook through clenched teeth.
Where was she when the family bank account was emptied?
“I’ve decided to stop blogging. I think I’ve just gotten myself stuck on the past we had and not the future I have to look forward to. Of course, Sherlock, I suppose that means I should probably stop calling as well, but not quite yet, I don’t think.”
His mind squashed down all hope, until it rose like bile as the door pushed open and there stood his brother, bright-eyed and fresh-faced. Any nicks he had from hunting completely gone, like a too perfect version of his brother.
On top of it all, though John didn’t want to think about it, no one was going to clear the voicemail box either. That was it, that was his last conversation with Sherlock Holmes, and it could not have left him more unsettled.
To sum it up, calls forty-six through fifty were made up by ramblings about Sherlock being the missing piece in John’s life.
She swayed again and ran a finger down his chest, brushing over a spot of his brother’s dried blood on her way down. At this, his own blood boiled and he swiftly grabbed her wrist “What then? A year”
John exhales hard and looks off to his right, then nods. “Right,” he says. “Got it.” He looks back at the agent. “Thank you.”
I nod against his face. “No, you’re right. We are.” I pull back enough to look up into his eyes. “I love you,” I say soberly, and he smiles and strokes my hair again.
Todd takes a mock bow. “I live to serve,” he says. “See you at lunch!”
rather good, if I may.”
He can feel his face heating ridiculously even as he says it, but he glances up just in time to see John swallow hard. “Sherlock,” he says, his voice quite unsteady, “that… um. Wow. That – I can’t tell you how much that means to me, to hear. From you, of all people. I – yeah. Okay. When, then, not if.”
They look at each other, that same shadow of pain on both their faces. “Yes,” Sherlock’s father says heavily. “We failed Eurus. We know there wasn’t much more we could have done for her, but we failed her nonetheless. And we failed you in having failed her, too,” he adds, to Sherlock.
already done all of that: jumped off a building without knowing he would survive, just to keep him alive, put himself into voluntary exile after, and then again after Magnussen. In comparison, maybe this isn’t nearly as much to ask – for the small ‘price’ of being kept in John’s life this time. His throat grows tight. “You’re incredible, you know that?” He can barely get the words out.
John gives a tight smile, lips clamped together, and raises a finger on the hand that’s not holding Sherlock’s. “I see what you’re doing there,” he says.
Sherlock doesn’t respond right away, breathing a bit quickly, himself. Then he says, slowly, “Or… not. You could… stay down here. If you want.”
“Teach you to call me a bad liar,” John says, and Sherlock gives a startled laugh.
Sherlock nods. “Very all right,” he confirms, then smiles, feeling strangely shy. “That was – good. Very good,” he amends. It doesn’t say nearly enough, so he tries again. “That is to say… incredible.”
But so far he hasn’t, so Molly plods through her days with dreary bleakness.
He’s leaning against Sherlock, smiling into his face, and Sherlock feels his chest turn molten. “Was it really that incredible?” he asks, feeling only a very little bit shy about it.
John opens his mouth to speak, but then Paul materialises out of the crowd. “Hello again,” he says smoothly, ignoring John completely.
Her eyes twinkle a little, and Sherlock finds himself reluctantly smiling. “You’re good,” he acknowledges.
“I asked him,” Sherlock tells him. “I had him lean on the maître d’. He owed Mycroft a favour.”
Sherlock nods again. “Okay.” Then, as John detaches himself, he adds, “Hurry.”
“What do you mean by that?” Sherlock asks, curious, splitting the last piece of the pudding and dredging it through its sauce.
He’s dazed and panting hard when he comes to himself, Sherlock lying heavily on top of him, spent and limp. There’s a strangely peaceful silence that’s gathered around them both, not pressuring John to talk or say anything to ‘normalise’ this, as if that would even be possible, but to break the aftermath and reframe it briskly as a coaching. Besides, he feels far too sated to be bothered. This is fine. They can just lie here for a little. It’s fine.
John swallows hard and gets out of his chair. Corey gets to his feet and John hugs him tightly, every ounce of jealousy and resentment he’s harboured toward this man over the past few weeks disappearing forever. “You really are a superhero,” he says. “Thank you. So much.”
“There’s still lots of formula,” Sherlock says. The conversation is going better than he cautiously imagined. “Maybe another box of Earl Grey?”
you. Trust you in a way that I’ve never trusted before. Trust that you meant it years ago when you said you knew me for real. And now – ” He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly, shaking his head, then looks John directly in the eye. “You are uniquely capable of causing me damage, now more than ever before. You are far closer to me than any other person ever has been or ever will be. I realise that this is a monumental overreaction on my part. What you said was barely even – it was the principle, not the action itself. Regardless, you wanted to be told if you hurt me, and that did.”
I might as well apologise in advance to
“No,” came the clipped reply.
Sherlock was already shaking his head and he resumed his approach to the front entrance, John following with his mind racing.  ‘Oh, dear god,’ he thought to himself in horror.  ‘If it’s Mycroft ...’  He couldn’t even finish the thought.  Despite their behaviour towards each other, he knew that the brothers’ public display of bickering hid a much deeper affection and if Sherlock were to lose Mycroft, John wasn’t sure how he would cope.
It wasn’t painful, only bright and colorful and overwhelming and it felt like the last time he had dosed up with his special 7% solution. He shook his head, attempting to rid himself from the sound, but soon he fell back letting the ecstasy overtake him. The windows burst around him, but he was unaffected as he lay there behind the station counter.
Silence engulfed the last call of the day. John just had to hear the voice one more time before he drank himself into oblivion.
Luckily, Mycroft had managed to avoid the chaos that was going on outside of the room he isolated himself in. It was stale and old MRE’s were scattered on top of the desk and shoved into the drawers. He deduced that, to some degree, hunger was one of the forces driving his peers to go feral, that and the lack of societal structure.
had stomped back into his brother’s life without a care and dragged him back into the life, all to find a father who had trained them, “Don’t be a hero. You can never save anyone but yourself.”
In the silence of the countryside, pink sky rising to greet the world, and bees waking from sleep, Sherlock’s soul screamed as it was dragged down to Hell.
Greg cleared his throat, even then it cracked with his attempt at forming a proper sentence, “Sher-” he paused “I know this is hard.” another pause, “I’ve got firewood at my place, I’m sure you know you’ve passed it. Mycrof-” He couldn’t finish the name, but continued despite the tears that threatened to choke him, “He’d want a proper hunter’s funeral.”
“I’d like to think, if you were alive, that we’d be together by now. I wish with every bone in my body that I had said those words before you fell. But I couldn’t. So here I am, alone. Happy Valentine’s Day, Sherlock Holmes, be mine?”
At the mention of his brother, Mycroft pulled his hand from Greg’s and turned, swinging his legs over the side of the table and staring intensely into his friend’s eyes, “What did Sherlock do? Don’t you dare tell me you let him do something reckless.”
Mycroft ran his hand down his face in frustration and sucked in a tight breath, “Time to find him then. At least we’ve got ten years before he gets dragged to hell.”
He entered the tiny station and looked around before heading to a fridge towards the back and grabbing a bottle of water, guzzling it down without regard to the liquid pouring out from the sides of his dry, pink mouth.
“You have important work to do for us. Heaven’s work.” spoke the energy that pulsed before him, magnificent and beyond all reaches of his wildest, childhood imagination.
All Sherlock had ever done was hunt-- his brother had gotten out, was on his way to the top, when Sherlock,
“Oh, no, I-” John stuttered as he pulled his hand from under Sherlock’s. “I-”
“God, life is so boring without you. You needed cases; I needed you to need me for cases.
Mycroft had disappeared, the yellow-eyed demon, Moriarty, dragging him to an abandoned military base with 6 of the brightest minds of Britain, him included. Moriarty had something in store for him, for all of them, but it became apparent that they were not just there to serve some intellectual purpose.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock eased.
The last whisper snuck into his mind as he hoisted his brother over his shoulder,
“What?”
“Out. I’m going out.”
Sherlock, she’s still devastated. Hasn’t even touched our old rooms. Our chairs are still sat right across from one another, the dust you refused to clear away has settled in like another piece of furniture, the wallpaper is still covered in bullet holes and yellow smiley faces. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit how much it hurt. I could still hear your violin playing, I could still feel your eyes watching me from your spot at the desk, I could still smell the familiar scent of your favorite soap. God Sherlock, I miss you. But, like I told Mrs. Hudson, I’m moving on.”
A devilish smile crept across her lips, “Your brother escaped the King of Hell. Moriarty isn’t too pleased with that. Mycroft was the only one leftover from his little...experiment. He needs someone for the job
John phoned Sherlock five times on the day of the proposal.
Sherlock cried out
With a deep breath of fresh air, he quickly took inventory of his body, only to notice that any discomfort he had had...before...was gone, and the only pain that existed was on his left shoulder.
“The fortune cookie I got tonight said ‘Sometimes a stranger can bring great meaning to your life.’ What are the odds? It triggered the memories of you, Sherlock, and I wondered how life might have been different if that’s the fortune I had gotten on that fateful night. You gave my life meaning and now you’re gone.”
“You know what I want, Sherlock. Even you can deduce that.”
Mycroft deserved to wake up and move on, pursue his career, his dreams,
“Here it goes Sherlock, just two hours to dinner and the inevitable moment I’ll truly have to let go of you. I hope you’re savouring this.”
He lowered his voice and it rumbled like the gravel beneath his feet, “Take me now then.”
The second call came when John was drunk. He’d had a bit too much whiskey as he sat on his couch marathoning James Bond movies and thinking about the night that he had convinced Sherlock to watch them with him. Sherlock had adamantly refused, but after only 15 minutes into
“Sherlock must’ve don-”
Mycroft pulled back from the hug with a slight chuckle, “I’m the responsible one here, don’t forget that I’m the one meant to order you around, Sherlock.”
John was so close he was just reaching for the ring when the pesky waiter from earlier shoved a bottle of champagne right between himself and Mary.
On December 24th John called in the middle of a Christmas party at Mike Stamford’s. “I wish you were here Sherlock. I know Christmas was a bit of a disaster last year, but at least you were here. People are right, the holiday’s are the hardest part of loss.” John took a deep breath and closed his eyes, “ I just wish…” But John couldn’t say anymore. He hung up the phone and rejoined old friends with a painful smile on his face.
John didn’t say much else; just that he missed Sherlock and all was going well.
to pull away
He dug into the old military rations with care, desperately projecting the memory of Mummy’s Christmas pot roast onto the “Ham and Chicken Loaf” that he emptied from an old, rusted tin. He also utilized the materials at hand-- scrap metal, an old radio, a screwdriver, some overly acidic batteries, and old telegram cables-- to interfere with a signal to the Greater London Area, hoping to zero in on 221B Baker Street, which he and his brother fondly referred to as their ‘home base.’
“Sherlock’s dead,” He said with conviction, still pointing the barrel of the gun right between the eyes of the intruder.
“Are you staying?”
A pause overstayed its welcome and, at that, Mycroft stood from his position and walked to the door frame, leaning into it when the soreness in his back settled in.
John thought,
“Mary insisted we play
He turned, nothing. No one. He nearly yelled out into the brightening abyss when a figure caught his eye. The hair on the back of his neck stood up, but that was to be expected next to a demon of the crossroads.
“Christ Sherlock, can you believe I nearly forgot dinner reservations.” John chuckled
He moved his hand beside his body only to feel the rough scratch of wood along his knuckles.
John looked at Sherlock curiously and felt pulled to the humanity that this straightedge soul so overtly presented in the current circumstances.
The second call
John decided, on the first of October, to call Sherlock and wish him happy holidays. He didn’t know why, but he’d always felt that October was the start of the season, and Sherlock has always loved the holidays.
As he pushed a pile of twenty and five dollar bills into the pocket of his jacket, (it looked new, just slightly different than the one Greg had wrapped around his brother, the gold buttons a dead giveaway to its provider--
John wasn’t sure what message he left in his blurred state of mind, but he decided that was for the best. He took one last swig of whiskey straight from the bottle before lying down on his couch and passing out.
What unfolded next was a muddle of John tripping over his words while trying to bring himself back to earth and Mary’s expectant comments as she waited for the moment John would propose.
Darkness. Nothing but dark, black, nothingness. The dark was an unexpected shock after seeing such commotion in his commanding spot beside the racks of hell.  Something bright and white and
The tension of city traffic began to ache in the silence of the car and he switched the tape player on, the song they had arrived at the compound playing, and then pausing, starting mid-chorus.
He suddenly threw himself at his little brother, wrapping his arms around him and grasping at the extra fabric in the coat that he wore. He sobbed into Sherlock’s shoulder “You were gone, you were dead. You were gone. For me, Sherlock, you died for me.”
to be saved, and so Sherlock told himself that he didn’t care, that he wasn’t worried, that he wouldn’t let pesky emotions cloud his judgment, no matter what the scene he arrived upon looked like.
“Give it up, Moriarty says it’s either you or me.” the man was pushing down harder against Mycroft, barely getting his words out, “I prefer the former.” Sherlock could see the man pressing his arms down with all of his strength when suddenly, Mycroft flipped the man over and pinned him down, one hand tossing the chair leg to his side and the other delivering a quick sock to the jaw.
“Alright, I know it’s only been 6 months, but I’m not going to find anyone else, am I? I wish you were here to knock sense into me, but my God, Sherlock, I think I’m going to propose to Mary. Tell me I’m not completely insane, it just feels so good to be wanted by someone. Life is empty without you, so I might as well, right?”
He opened the door quietly, his hand reaching to his side to put a hand on the hilt of his knife, specially, specifically and scientifically curated to kill demons.
Sherlock laughed and grinned as John relayed his tale of rescue to Greg and an eavesdropping Mycroft.
-know how much I loved you, thought John, his eyes shut and his head dropped a bit, anything to stop his world from spinning any faster. His stomach was turning, his heart was shattered and in that moment, he knew the words had come too late. Why couldn’t he have said it two years ago instead of letting them slip on the night he was going to propose to someone?
. Sherlock let rage carry him to the end of the hall, ignoring the tears prickling in his eyes and gripped the hilt of his weapon, pulling it from his victim's neck. He then stood straight, turned, and walked with purpose back to his brother’s body.
He returned his hand to fit on Sherlock’s shoulder and spoke: “Hold on.”
“You know my methods John, I am known to be indestructible.”
“Sherlock, it’s nearly January 1st” John slurred his words, “I’d reallllly like it if you’d be my new years kiss.” He let out a little ‘humph’ and a smile in his drunken state. “Don’t tell anyone I’ve said this, but I’d realllllly like a kiss from you.” John gave his phone a little peck and hung up. When the clock struck midnight, John was alone in a sea of people locking lips.
Silence filled the black of the car. It felt like a hearse, easing down the pavement and riding past its usual home at the Yard.
Two weeks had passed since Sherlock fell. Two weeks and John was numb. He felt empty like the void of silence he had just committed to Sherlock’s voicemail box.
‘No one, hold on a minute.’
The day after Halloween, John called again to tell Sherlock that two little boys had showed up at the door dressed up as small versions of himself and Sherlock. “I hope you don’t mind…in fact I’m sure you
The woman sucked air in between her teeth and broke the gaze that she was holding with Sherlock, “See, the King down there is not too pleased that you got out of your fate so easily. And your father, well, he pushed his luck with that last deal.” She looked back up, eye flashing red between batted eyelashes.
Mycroft drew his eyes from the angel that stood over him and looked to his brother.
The calls he made when he felt suffocating loneliness in groups of people or the times when he feared that life was going to pass him by were the most painful for him. He rarely knew what to say and often times didn’t speak a word. He knew that was all right, Sherlock wasn’t there to listen anyways.
But those days of estrangement and abandonment were whisked behind them, any remaining resentment being left in the dust that kicked up behind the Impala.
