“Yes.” John said. He bit his lip. “I just went into it right when I saw him. I saw the look on Sherlock’s face. Seb was holding his leash.” John shrugged. “I went nuts.”
Sherlock didn’t tell him he didn’t know if he liked it or not, seeing as he’d never fucked a man before.
John handed her his extra copy. "They meet Sundays at seven. Mrs. H is hosting this month so it's at 221."
John texted Sherlock once his shift ended, having changed out of his doctor clothes and into a navy blue long sleeved shirt with pearly white buttons and white top-stitching. He was wearing the pair of jeans that did good things for his backside and his usual black jacket and he was standing at his desk in his office, his bag packed in front of him. He sent a quick text.
“Sherlock!” John snapped. “I can’t take you anywhere—it’s amazing, Betsy. Thanks so much for asking us over.”
"I really don't think anything's broken." Sherlock said mildly. He left the gown on the table and carefully pulled on the Tshirt. "I'm sore as hell but the pain isn't sharp. I know what a broken bone feels like."
“Who the hell are you? How do you know Sherlock?” John’s first instinct was that this man was a dom. John’s hunches about this sort of thing were usually correct.
Sherlock was staring through the dripping window to the small groups of people making their way about in the bad weather. Many turned and waved, delight on their faces despite the foul weather, once they realized it was a royal carriage. Flanked as it was by guards on horseback even the dullest citizens could gather that at least one royal family member was inside. It was idiotic. Anyone in the area who wanted to end the Holmes royal line would know to attack
"Fine. Mrs. Hudson, then." Donovan grabbed hold of his arm to steady him and urged him forward. He stumbled. "Someone has to know. I'll not have you dying on my watch."
enveloped him. He walked faster, turning out of the prison compound and striding off to the main road to catch a taxi back to his hotel. As far as he was concerned, Mr. Berwick dug his own grave with every stab of the knife. The evidence was obviously conclusive, given that the man was in prison, and Sherlock gave it no more thought. London was his agenda now, and he was sure he could be back at 221 and at his dom’s feet by tea time. He raised a gloved hand and hailed a cab.
“Huh.” She shrugged. “Alright.” She gathered her things and left and forty minutes later, John was in his bedsit. He should follow his own advice, he reasoned, watching the news and eating a reheated leftover curry. He took his Equivo dutifully when he was in Afghanistan, as he wanted to be at the top of his game as much as possible, but since coming back to London he’d been taking his pills sporadically at best, reasoning ‘what was the point?’
They exchanged small pieces of tart and across the tent Mel and Molly watched curiously. John was suddenly self conscious. There were cameras everywhere, and no one else was sampling each other's food. He was sure there weren't rules against it, persay, but the last thing he wanted was to draw the commonwealth's attention to his idiot schoolboy crush on Sherlock.
“Can I see?” Mike slid over on the sofa, expecting the detective to sit beside him. Instead Sherlock armed his way out of his suit jacket, flung it at the bison head (where it hooked on a horn) and yanked his sleeve back. “See?” He held up his bare arm and plastered a fake smile on his face. The scrape was just a faint red patch on his skin that would fade in time. Sherlock flexed his arm up and down to prove his elbow’s mobility. “Perfect, wonderful, just like new.” He started to pace into the kitchen again—
He put two fingers on his sub’s wrist and looked at watch, counting out a ten second interval. It was a little fast, but that was normal for his sub.
"No!" Sherlock snarled. "This is what I've come to, John. Examining the finer points of children's tales. I may as well retire now‒there's no coming back from this." He pushed his mug back into John's hand and collapsed into his chair. The book he'd been flipping through fell to the floor. "There's no point in continuing to be a professional detective. I'm finished." He curled up into a pathetic ball and put his face in his hands. John grit his teeth at the melodrama of it all at stared at the ceiling for patience.
wanted him to pick a word. If it was just a simple request, why did he look so worried? Sherlock studied his face and John rolled his eyes.
let you know. That is the point of the safe word, correct? When it gets to be too much, I let you know and we stop. That’s exactly what happened yesterday, John.”
“Possibly. She’s a barrister, a dom, enjoys fine foods, and she’s been out of town for two months on business.”
John didn’t have to wait long to see the hierarchy in action. Since he was new to the herana, he anticipated the others might take an interest in him. After breakfast on John’s first morning, Buck put his foot out as John walked past. He stumbled.
He was in a foul mood from being forced to look at Seb’s stupid face. Violet had left so it was just him and Jim’s band of morons. They’d briefly talked about trade deals and the like until the drinks were poured and everyone started talking about inane gossip. That’s when he’d left.
“Good—excellent. That’s a relief. If you’d be willing, I’d like to explore those things with you, but not all discipline has to come with physical sensations. We could instill something simple like a set of rules for behavior or a curfew for you too.”
"Let's see who we have here." A cultured Britannian voice spoke from inside the carriage. The man, elegantly dressed in a rich green overcoat and silvery-white shirt, descended the narrow steps. He took a lantern hanging from the side of the carriage and approached John and tugged his gaiter away. He blinked, surprised, before a satisfied grin crossed his smarmy face. "Well it must be my lucky day." His voice was soft and he spoke slowly. “Captain John Watson. You've been making quite a name for yourself in this little…” he glanced at John’s team, each held fast like he was. “…ragtag group of yours. You've a positively massive price on your head and when I deliver you to King Moriarty, we'll both get what we deserve. How convenient. I was on my way to visit him anyway."
Molly gave them a fancy bottle of wine and Mrs. Hudson gave a beautiful hand-knitted blanket as wide as the bed and sinfully soft. “How did you make it so quickly?” John asked in amazement as Sherlock ran his fingers over the powder blue yarn.
“Whoa.” John steadied him, and Sherlock buried his face in John’s shoulder—an impressive task considering he was a good five inches taller. “Hey.” John embraced him, “Are you under?”
are you?” John growled. It was already a weird, borderline creepy situation, but the fact that this stranger had his file was unnerving.
Just then, Greg’s phone started ringing. He picked it up, muttering a gruff, “Lestrade,” into the receiver. “Yes…yes….really?” He jotted notes and Sherlock craned his neck to try and see over the mess.
Sherlock shrugged and turned away. “I don’t care one way or the other.” He ensured his voice was as bitchy as possible.
“Maybe.” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth went up in a grin. “A starting point, anyway. Can’t confirm anything while trapped in this blasted castle.
He was in the zone all morning. He mixed all his fillings and cooked his pastries. While they were cooling he gathered the sticks and then dropped spoonfuls of fruit filling into each cooked circle of pastry, pressing them together and slipping the stick inside. He'd brought along a festive wooden cake pop stand that he'd found at a thrift shop and he stuck each pop into it.
"How the hell did you do that?" John asked him once everyone's had been judged. They were waiting for the next segment to begin filming. Make up was being applied to faces and there was a sort of collective toilet break going on. "It usually takes at least five days to make the starter."
He shook his head. If only he could do it without getting himself or both of them disqualified. He could only watch helplessly as Sherlock struggled to complete his piping.
John drummed his fingers on Sherlock’s back. He looked over his shoulder. The cream was just behind him, and really, he could reach Sherlock’s arse the way he was curled up. Was he going to indulge in this ridiculous behavior? Yes, yes he was. He managed to free his arm and grope behind himself until he found the tube.
to see his response to that question.” John’s fist clenched, both as a stress response and because he really wanted to punch Mycroft in the face. The older Holmes seemed to sense this, as he stopped pursuing it and wisely chose to shut up instead.
“Fine.” Sherlock strode off and John rolled his eyes fondly. Sherlock was adorable when he was on the hunt, all enthusiasm and bright intelligence. He was proud of him too.
“Let me.” John kissed him and lifted the shirt, mindful of the medical tape. He tossed it aside, then slid his sub’s trousers down. He pulled the socks off and stood before his naked sub, eying the bandages. “He hurt you.” John growled. His hands clenched and his cock stiffened. He growled and the hairs on his neck stood up.
He ignored it but the words rang true. This life of being used and disposed of wasn't something he could maintain. Prostitutes on the street had the luxury of saying no but he wasn't even afforded that. If his body didn't give out, his spirit would. He shook his head. He couldn't do that to Molly. He couldn't do that to Sherlock. He eyes welled up at the thought of the handsome, kind Prince. He cut through a courtyard to get back to the herana faster. He paused in the doorway, looking across the open outdoor space. It was dark, save for a couple torches in sconces on the walls. A couple of the guest rooms overlooked this space and in mild weather guests would take tea out here.
“We were dating.” She said in a croaky voice. “He had just broken up with David, and…” her eyes filled and she dabbed at them, “and we were just…” she started crying harder, “I loved him. He was the one, you know? We would have been married.”
“Good idea, Captain.” ‘Sofa’ had become code for, ‘let’s snog each other stupid’ and Sherlock grinned and they crushed their lips together in a heated kiss, hands groping over each other’s backs and thighs and bums and crotches, managing to stumble into the sitting room.
snogged on the sofa like a couple of horny adolescents? Had he really made such a fool of himself? Coming off like one of those pitiable subs from the crap daytime shows Mrs. Hudson always had on, pining for their doms in a simpering sighing mess of blatant need. Fucking hell. He threw off the blanket, his happy cocoon ruined, and got to his feet. Ulgh John probably thought this meant they were
Mike wondered now if Sherlock’s anxiety had spiked up worse than normal. His opium habit had landed him in embarrassing disgrace with his brother and he had  just come back from Hibern and seeing his old nemesis Jim. It was very possible Sherlock’s emotions were getting the better of him. "When did this horrible aching pain start?" Mike asked, jotting more notes.
He took a bag of frozen corn out of the drawer. He’d keep this to himself for now. The feeling was still new and fragile and he wanted to let it percolate in his brain for a while, like trying on a new pair of shoes and wearing them around the house to test the fit.
"No! I refuse to do that!" He leaped out of bed. Someone had put a pair of loose cream trousers on him. He was glad of it. Shouting at his brother while naked would take the heat right out of his anger. "You can't force me to stay here like a prisoner and I refuse to go to Hibern! I hate that odious little toad and I…I'm the Prince!" It was a weak argument and Sherlock knew it.
Sherlock stood up off the toilet and slipped the gown off, then looked at himself in the mirror. His back was dashed with little circular marks from the flogger and his nipples were bright red. There were pink marks near his mouth from the gag and his wrists smelled of leather. The cuffs were comfortable, if nothing else. He looked like he hadn’t slept in about forty years. A shower. That’s what he needed. He got in the tub and turned on the water, then pulled the curtain and let the warmth gush over him, rinsing away all the evening’s tension. The dried semen loosened on his thighs and the water was cool enough to not aggravate his sore back and chest. He stretched his arms and felt the tension pull in his muscles. He tentatively reached between his bum cheeks. His hole was tender. John hadn’t harmed him though. He didn’t think John could ever really harm him. He would be fine.
John unfolded the white strip of fabric and  slipped it up to his waist. He tightened it above his hips and stared at it. He was barely covered. A breeze would show him off to the world.
Sherlock was coming back today! He looked at the time stamp on the texts. He’d sent them hours ago. And—Bondage!? Hell yes he was amenable. He gulped his snack and thumbed out a response:
Shame pierced his belly and Sherlock hastily shoveled more food into his mouth in lieu of having to answer.
Betsy rang the doorbell an hour later, hugging John hello. He brought her Mrs. Hudson’s door and knocked once before letting himself in. It smelled of sugar and roasting meats and butter and onion and so much good food. He’d told them that they didn’t have to cook and he and Sherlock would be more than happy to cater (surely Angelo would be thrilled), but they insisted and told him not to worry. He didn’t protest too much. Whatever they made, it was bound to be amazing.
thing you should be saying to me, and that thing is ‘thank you.’ You have for whatever reason elected to hate me, but I’ll not stand here and endure your poor attitude the way everyone else seems to be happy doing. I went out of my way to do Mike a favor, and you could show a little gratitude.”
"What? Oh‒yeah! I forgot, her and I hadn't met before you left. Yeah," he was smiling stupidly, playing with the thin collar. "I went and got myself caught."
He rubbed his hands together and started smoothing them over his chest and shoulders. The light, sweet scent of rose petals and a deeper, spicier musk filled the warm air. John inhaled. It smelled wonderful.
comfort. He rubbed lotion into sore skin and checked how tight the ropes were. He was fine with cuddling in bed and the days spent together were strewn with sweet little touches—a hand on his waist, brushing hips, a nuzzle into his neck or a kiss on the cheek, often accompanied by the words ‘gorgeous,’ ‘amazing,’ ‘fantastic’ and the like. That Gordian Knot of feelings that was so constricting a few weeks ago had unraveled and his view of John in his life was much clearer now.
“John!” Sherlock gasped and instinctively reached forward—but the ropes tightened across his forearms, locked away behind him, the cheap acrylic-plastic digging hard into his skin. He growled through his teeth as that tongue laved him and tiny love nips stung bright.
When John woke up, the morning light was trying to seep through the closed curtains. His eyes were crusty and his mouth tasted like something had died in it. Garlic curry, a hint of whiskey, and teeth that hadn’t been brushed. Why hadn’t he…oh right. Last night’s events had not been one of his better moments and a sudden sensation of pathetic bastard washed over him. He’d come home from work and eaten shite leftovers, then popped his switch pill, drank a bunch of whiskey and jacked off to thoughts of a submissive who didn’t want anything to do with him. Wonderful. Real top-notch doctor behavior. He groaned and got out of bed. He had to see Ella today, and he was definitely not going to mention this.
Sherlock frowned. How would John know when the box had been touched? Was there some sort of compound that he’d rubbed on it that would come off? Some kind of varnish?
echoed in the silent space and he belatedly realized that it was early morning and he might have woken someone. Whatever. It cleared his head a little further and no one shouted through the walls.
The final tier, the lowest group was the hardest to abide. They struggled with their status. These were the people who kept the others awake with their sobs every night, who needed lots of medical tending. They were too good for this fate and while initially John’s heart had ached for them, he’d had to harden himself lest he go mad.
“You’ve been warned about this.” The Headmaster said, crossing his arms. “You’ve been warned that repeated disobedience will earn you nothing but a trip to my office. I know your parents were called the last time this little incident took place, but it appears whatever discipline they imposed on you had no effect whatsoever.”
“If you blow me right now, I’ll take them off.” John didn’t look away from his magazine and he turned a page.
Sherlock pulled off his suit coat and let it splay in the doorway. The drugs were kicking in and numbing the worst of the pain and making him dead tired. He dropped to the edge of the bed like a sack of flour, wincing only a little, and fumbled the buttons on his gray shirt.
Prince Sherlock Holmes croaked out his name and pushed past him. "I'm dying!" He sank into Mike's chair and rested his face in his hands, elbows on knees.
"Sherlock." She said. She pursed her lips at the unmoving body. "You've made two maids cry, lost your valet, and nearly made four other people quit! Now tell me: what is wrong?"
The next hour was a whirlwind of shooting and re-shooting and pulling individuals aside to get reactions and short interviews. John just hoped his voice didn't shake much and that the editors would be kind and not put anything stupid he said into the final cut of the episode.
“John,” Mycroft called from the sitting room, “how is it spending so much time with Sherlock? Hellish, I imagine…”
They both trotted into the kitchen, tearing open the bags and tucking into the eggs and pancakes and bacon.
“Yes.” Sherlock stepped back and went to the kitchen, poking through the bags. John found three plates that didn’t have either food bits or body parts on them and brought two to the table.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, John. Please.” John nuzzled his neck, inhaling the sweet hide scent and his sub’s natural and familiar smell. It buzzed up into his brain and made his dominance roar.
John headed for the kitchen and poured them each a glass of water. He made two pieces of toast and fixed them with butter and jam. That had gone well—very well. He felt confident and happy and he was delighted that Sherlock had not only responded so well to the cropping, but had also been completely accepting of his earlier admission about the safeword. It felt good to clear the air. John didn’t want to screw this up and Sherlock appeared to be fine with his confession.
“Lines?” He rubbed his backside again, the sting of John’s palm dancing delightfully over his skin. “No way. Can’t you just suspend me?”
. He hadn't expected for one second to get in (had only entered at Harry's and their grandmother's insistence, to be honest) and the rest of his night was spent making phone calls to friends and family to tell them the news. Everyone was delighted and thrilled and supportive and it was evening when he finally hung up the phone for good.
Until now. John had slipped into a crack in his mind palace and set up residence and Sherlock couldn't evict him. He wasn't even sure he wanted to. It was exciting and horrendous and made him feel a little bit sick. His feelings were all tangled up and all he could parse was that he did indeed want as much of John as possible.
In theory it was completely straightforward. On paper the plan worked perfectly. In reality however…
have been Sherlock’s limbs on that tarp, but it wasn’t. His sub was safe beside him, pulling his suit coat over his shoulders. “There’s only so many routes he could have taken that start at the pub and use that street to get him home.”
Nothing clever came to Sherlock in that moment, which rankled even more than what Seb had said. He gave him a fake smile and turned, going up the steps.
“What do you think?” John asked, looking at the displayed bands. Nothing really jumped out, but if Sherlock had his heart set on something he’d relent. He would be the one wearing it, after all.
John continued. “I can’t let you go off on a case so early in the morning without giving you a nice relaxing evening the night before. I still have to treat your bum.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He was hunched in shame, looking at the floor. He hated this! He had made a dumb mistake and everybody knew about it and now John was angry and he hated John shouting at him and he hated that he was deprived clothing while John was fully covered. This wasn’t at all like the fun, sexy scolding John indulged him with earlier today in the school scene or weeks ago at his bedsit when he packed that suitcase. This was real and awful and his dom wasn’t done.
As if summoned, John appeared in the doorway dressed in jeans and a green shirt. He blinked, seeing his sub awake, and crossed over to the bed, crouching on the floor in front of his face.
.” He chuckled. “I’ll never use the crop for punishment since you like it so much, and I’ve known plenty of people who don’t like corporal discipline. But with you? I think that option should be on the table.”
“I hope you’re still interested in fucking me.” John said, standing there naked. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he nodded. “Excellent. It’s been a while, you know that, so I’ll need the plug first. Can you put it in?”
Sherlock grinned, feeling naughty and submissive, and patted the skin hard enough to make his bum wobble. He smiled and smacked him a little bit, enjoying himself.
Sherlock turned around and saw his dom with his arms crossed tight, staring up at him with a less-than impressed expression. “I don’t want you to be a paradigm of manners, love. Sally I let slide because she was an arse first, but what you said about Lestrade was bloody uncalled for. Do we need to revisit our conversation about when I rein you in?”
“John.” Sherlock was again surprised with his own sentiment. He wanted John to feel better. He wanted his dom to not beat himself up about this. Sherlock knew that, if he felt so inclined, he could tell the doctor to do damn near anything and John would do it just to make amends. Just because he felt so shit about last night. He could subject the doctor to all manner of unpleasant experiments in the name of apology and revenge and he was certain that John would obey his every wish. He didn’t want that though. If he asked John to eat or smell something foul, he wanted it to be because the doctor agreed, no strings attached. Not because he agreed out of guilt. He patted John’s knee. He just didn’t want his dom to feel so crappy anymore.
“Not now.” Sherlock shook his head. Lestrade glanced at John. “Later. I’ll call.” He got into his car. The ambulance was gone and he merged into traffic, disappearing up the road. Whatever Mycroft had told him must have worked.
And jammed the send button. There. That would put a stop to it. Seb wouldn’t even be able to write back since he put his number on the blocked call list. He typed up his entry again, scowling at the screen as his fingers slammed across the keys. After a few moments of this he shot away from the table and wandered to the window, glancing down at the street. Customers at Speedy’s, a few cars rolling by. The door downstairs was locked, right….? Of course it was. It always was. If he didn’t lock it or John didn’t lock it, then Mrs. Hudson would.
Sherlock whined and John slipped his tongue off the slit. He angled his wrist and dug fingers into Sherlock’s hot sore cheeks.
They all traipsed back to the kitchen and John saw the chocolate brown leash trailing from the silver chain glinting on Mike’s neck, the end of it tucked into a pocket. The dominant inside of him reared up at the sight and he licked his lips. Oh God if only he could collar and leash Sherlock.
Sherlock’s phone chimed in the bedroom and he reluctantly pulled away fand went to the bedroom to grab it. His dom followed, instinctively guarding his sub’s back. The text was from Lestrade.
John tugged at his hair. His chest was getting tighter. Sherlock was out there somewhere and there was a bloody
John's brows knit together. The herana? What did that have to do with anything? Heranas housed concubines.  Many larger homes and castles had space for such a thing. Wealthy people‒nobility, monarchs, aristocrats, and the like‒usually had at least a few concubines available on site for themselves or for visiting guests. Concubines were often versed in the arts of hospitality: music, massage, dancing, serving, and of course, sexual favors. It was considered a sign of huge luxury to be able to house and pay concubines for the sole purpose of entertaining your guests. John had never seen one. He'd never known anyone rich enough to either keep concubines or to know someone who did. He didn’t know why Moran was bringing this up. John was certain Jim hated him and the feeling was very mutual. There was no way the King of Hibern was going to allow John a concubine to keep him entertained.
“Oh, dears.” Mrs. Hudson popped out of her flat when they stepped into the foyer. She opened her mouth to say more but fell quiet when John stalked past her and up the steps.
John stiffened. How did this man know he was domming Sherlock? “Dynamic snob are you? If you knew Sherlock at all you would know that he’s hardly weak.”
John kept stroking his arms, his sides, his hips. He squeezed his arse and rubbed his hands up and down his bottom. He’d missed this. Sherlock had only been gone a day but still he’d missed the warm touch of his sub. His hot skin and the little breathy noises he made when John did something he liked. Christ. He stared down at his sub’s hard cock, pressed up against his own rapidly stiffening one.
died! Look.” He held it up by the wing and John grimaced, a disgusted, “oh!” escaping his mouth as he stepped back. Two children kicking around football nearby stopped and watched.
Sherlock clasped his hands behind as John went off to get the items. The pressure of the pins was zinging through his chest in a not unpleasant way. He looked down, observing the pinched flesh, stretched between the wooden legs. The skin would be sore later. The good sore.
and content in an excited sort of way. It was humiliating as hell to admit that John scolding him was a turn-on—which was exactly why the doctor was rambling on in his ‘Captain Watson’ voice about rules and obedience.
John put the envelope down and rolled onto his stomach. They were eye level and John reached for his hands, grasping them.
He heard footsteps behind, but thought nothing of it. People and cars were going to and fro in the early evening.
He pulled on white smalls and a long tunic. The brilliant white fabric was soft from use and he liked the way it settled on his sensitive skin, the silk and cotton blend light as air. Black stockings and trousers came on next. He pulled a pair of bespoke, velvety black shoes on his bare feet, the interior soft and fleecy and good for walking around indoors. He found a tunic, striped in alternating shades of dark blue, and threw it on over his head. He didn't bother to lace up the neck. There was no need to look his best. It was just Mycroft. He found an embroidered cloth belt flung over a chair where he'd last thrown it and tied it sloppily around his waist. He mashed the sodden licorice root around in his clean mouth and went to the ensuite bathroom. He tossed the used stick through the toilet seat where it would fall several floors and float towards the moat surrounding the palace before carried off into the Thames. He rinsed his mouth clear using a fresh pitcher of water a servant had brought in. He splashed some on his face and, invigorated, wiped himself dry.
"I had dalliances in my youth." Sherlock said. "Moments that lasted as long as a school semester or as short as a weekend before abruptly coming to an end."
.” Sherlock let the name pop out of his mouth. “Recently promoted at Scotland Yard—an idiot, but might be good at his job someday.”
He pulled it out and switched off the alarm. “Molly.” He lied to John. He tapped his thumbs over the screen as if texting her back, then stood.
Sherlock looked down. "As much as I could. He's the most fascinating human being I've ever met and now he won't let me forget him."
“Just how I like you.” He squirted some lotion into his palm, rubbed his hands together, and smoothed over his shoulders. Sherlock sighed into mattress, going soft and pliable the moment John touched him. He rubbed the cream into his skin, getting it down his spine and scapula and ribs. He squirted more lotion onto his palm and rubbed it into his bottom, getting it down his thighs and behind his knees. Sherlock spread his legs and John teased at his balls, slipping his fingers up through his crack and getting the lotion
“Dammit.” He muttered. He popped out of an alley near Dixon’s home and found a bench under a shady tree. Sweat was slick under his arms and on his back and he wiped a hand over his brow. It came away glistening. He sniffed his shirt collar and wrinkled his nose at the scent of car exhaust and rubbish. Maybe John had better luck. His phone made a noise and he eagerly tugged it out of his jacket pocket, frowning at the unknown number. A text. He opened it up and immediately a block of ice dropped into his belly.
“Are all your cases like this?” John asked, his voice still filled with wonder and joy. He spooned rice onto each dish Sherlock set on the table.
She made an exasperated noise. "That stuff is dangerous. I don't like that you get high." She walked over to him and put two fingers under his chin, tilting his head up to look at the bruise staining his eye. She tutted at the blue-purple mark.
Suddenly, Logan looked up towards the front window, the curtains taped closed. He gripped the knife and lifted the curtain and peeked very carefully out the window, glancing up and down the dark road. Sherlock whimpered, unable to do anything but watch the crimson river slide out of his throbbing forearm. He really hoped the knife hadn’t nicked the radial artery. If it had, there wasn’t much time left. He rested his head back on the tarp, angry and terrified at how helpless he was.
So Sherlock began by saying how Seb had come up to him on the pavement and spoke to him and tugged the leash. John listened, trying not to get too upset. Then he gave his side.
John reached behind himself and grabbed a plastic cup with a straw off the little table, holding it as Sherlock sipped. John put it back when he was finished.
Sherlock stood up, the chair scratching loudly on the concrete floor. He’d had just about enough of this. Berwick got angry and killed his dom girlfriend. He clearly hadn’t gone into Defense. A ghost must have placed the knife in his hands. Open and shut domestic, too bad, so sorry. There was no case to solve. He strode for the door.
Sherlock’s angry scowl softened and he turned with a swirl of coat and opened the black door, striding inside.
John was striding down the sidewalk in the clammy nighttime air. A hot cup of coffee and a cold breeze had cleared his head and he felt a little better. He’d thought about calling Mike or Betsy to vent and ask advice, but realized he didn’t need to. Demanding Sherlock off the case wasn’t his right. Sherlock was an adult and if he wanted to go after the killer, then John could only voice his opinion. He didn’t
It was an odd thought, one that Sherlock didn’t even know how to process. What did it mean? It was a fact, yes, but did he like that fact? Did he want John around here more often?
He grunted and sped up, slamming with every thrust. Sherlock stopped dragging fingers over his back and instead simply held on, letting his dom do what he wanted. John rocked them back and forth, gasping and panting hard. The normally quiet bed squeaked in the frame. Sherlock buried in face in John’s shoulder and clung to his back. John was intense and focused above him, fucking him like he’d never been fucked.
“Get in the corner.” John deposited him there and stepped back. He scrubbed his hands through is hair. This had been
"Oh, John." Sherlock pulled him close and held him like he was something precious. He slipped his hand up the back of John's neck and cradled his nape. John was actually trembling in his hands. "I will never do anything you don't want me to do." He said, his words strong with conviction.
“Oh I do.” She said. “I’ve known him long enough to learn that if you try to cage him, he just fights that much harder to break free. And he always breaks free in the end.”
“No. He was dead. Thank God…” Molly looked at the covered face of the corpse sadly. “There was some mud inside one of his pockets.” She said, “I know how you like to run organic material, so I ran it.” He looked up at her in interest and she brought him to her computer and he sat down in front of the graphed results pulled up on the screen, “there’s what was in the mud. I thought at first it was just Thames grime, you know? But I figured you could make more sense of it.”
“Mmmm…” Normal speech seemed to be beyond his grasp (for once) and John took a moment to enjoy the fact that his boy was in subspace and that
"Thank you, John." He said kindly, reaching forward to take the saucer and save John potentially dropping it all.
“A helpful tip, these doors cannot be unlocked from the inside. Not from back here.” The voice was smooth and familiar and completely unconcerned at his frantic tugging at the door and John sighed, thumping his fist on the window in defeat.
“The one?” Sherlock spoke as if he had a bad taste in his mouth. “Surely you could find anyone to grovel for?”
John tipped the little bottle into the water and swirled his hands around. A vaguely minty scent filled the air. It wasn't unpleasant and it almost had a menthol-meets-eucalyptus flavor about it. John added another generous dollop of the gel and paddled his hands in the water, creating frothing bubbles.
John closed his eyes. If Sherlock was going to insist on being an arse to the cops, John was going to need to draw the line somewhere.
“I need you to trust that I’ll take care of you when you need it. That’ll you’ll trust me to keep you from crashing into the ground. When you’re on a case and you haven’t eaten or slept in a fortnight, I’ll fix that.”
“Serves you right.” Dimmock snipped thirty minutes later, closing the jail cell door on Sherlock, who was still holding his aching arm to his chest. “Cool your heels in here while actual police officers go solve the murder. If you make bail, don’t bother pursuing this case anymore, Mr. Holmes, or the inside of a jail cell will be the least of your problems.” He left and Sherlock made a childish face at the door before he sank to the crappy little cot in the cell. Dimmock had allowed him his phone and all his belongings at least, so he grabbed his phone and dialed the one person he could think of to help him out.
“That dom was flirting with you and you bloody responded!” John hissed. “First Coel and now him? Is it like a kink of yours to piss me off?”
John put the phone down and took it. He opened it and looked at the collage. His jaw tightened. “Do you want to take this to the police?” He asked.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock muttered at his shoulder. He lifted his head and John kissed him sweetly on the lips, his stomach flipping when Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed and he practically melted against him. Dammit he didn’t
He said it so quietly that Sherlock almost thought he misheard him. He glanced at the DI, who looked both amused and slightly worried, like he was afraid Sherlock was going to verbally tear him apart for his comment. He was right though, Sherlock was certain, and his expression softened. John would no doubt sing his praises. That he was even still in Sherlock’s life—and
The sweet strains of the violin floated down the stairs and John smiled. Sherlock was in a not-insane mood and John ear twigged the piece: "Oh Come all ye Faithful." That was a surprise from his atheist flat mate. John knew Sherlock liked Christmas music, even if he didn't believe.
“Does anyone else hear a dog barking?” Sherlock said, his voice pointed and sneery as he glared at the other man.
“Yes?” John helped him step into the jeans and he pulled them up, buttoning and zipping and getting a grope on the bum and crotch in for good measure. Sherlock smiled and reached for the undershirt John had pulled out for himself. He slipped it on.
John adjusted the temperature to something lukewarm, as hot or even warm water would just hurt his boy’s sensitized flesh. They were already nude, so that helped too. “In you go.” He pulled back the curtain and Sherlock obediently stepped into the tub, facing the spray. John got in behind him.
“Yes.” John took a bite of food and thought. “I like having rules in my relationships. If those rules are broke, I wouldn’t be lenient with you.” He looked up at Sherlock and put his fork down. “Generally. I understand that the cases are important to you, and when you're on a case, that takes priority. I get that. I'll follow you in and give my medical perspective and cross London in the name of a text if it helps the case, but you need to listen to me too. You push yourself too hard, love. You barely slept during this whole banker case.”
His mount, a flighty, nervous little thing, danced sideways as some dead leaves blew across the dirt path. Sherlock jerked it back to center. Charcoal grey clouds rolled overhead and the misty air was touched with chill damp. The forest was thick with tall pine and ancient oak trees and the air was sweet with sap and heavy with moisture. Moss clung to rough bark and the trees were so thick in places it looked like twilight rather than late morning.
"It's fine, Kate." He smiled and stood, gathering his plates. "Let 'em know I'll be available. Usual place. Okay?"
John smiled and Sherlock's heart ached. Why did he have to leave? Who had dared book him tonight? Sherlock had half a mind to pound on that person's door and declare John his and off-limits.
The leather cords smacked across his shoulder and Sherlock yelped around the gag, jerking in the restraints. That flogger packed quite a punch. John must be feeling
the crop over back, careful to avoid his spine and the bony parts of his shoulders. Sherlock wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but John finished cropping him and the fire’s heat made every tender spot on his body burn and sting. His cock was harder than ever.
"No, Sherlock. You are behaving like a child. Stop this tantrum and grow up. You're a prince. Start acting like one!" He flung Sherlock's hand away. "Rest today, sleep this mistake off." He sounded disgusted and Sherlock's chest tightened with shame, "and then pack your things. You're coming with me and I'll hear nothing more about it." He gave Sherlock a terrible fierce stare and Sherlock turned away.
John shook his head. “Naughty, naughty boy, Sherlock.” John strode towards him and the sub backed away, trying not to giggle. “I ask you to do one thing.” John said. He stopped walking when Sherlock had bumped into the corner. His hands were at the small of his back and he was looking at the floor with his shoulders hunched up.
She wasn't sure what he meant. She wanted to stay with him but she had an assignment, with Greg as it happened.
She made a face. "The guy's dick was all red at the top. Oozing like, and looked like a couple spots. His cock was real small, too. 'Bout the size of his brain."
“I hadn’t seen Owen in a long time and I was just hoping we could talk a little bit—Oh God, it sounds so
Sherlock gestured over the Mills board on the table in front of him. "I've a bit of money and I'm feeling lucky." He explained. "You look like a man who's not afraid of a challenge."
“There.” John slipped the needle out and pressed gauze onto the wound. He looked around for a place to dump the used needle.
Thank God for that. John put the phone aside and headed for the loo to shower, glad that he wouldn’t be stuck all day in either his bedsit or Sherlock’s empty flat with nothing to keep him company but a head full of war memories.
Sherlock stared at his shoulder, examining the scar. "Difficult to tell since it occurred so long ago. You're clearly not from wealth. I would guess a gunshot wound but guns are barely available now and even so are available only to the highest buyers, likely they were even more rare when you were a child. Most Hibernians make a living at either farming, fishing, or some sort of mining. Miners your age have obvious signs of it, blackened fingertips, a telltale cough. Your hands are clean enough and you've not coughed once since you've been in this room, so, farming. Again balance of probability states that it could have been a plowing accident or such. Based on the shape of the scar, something long punctured the skin and muscle, but, that's conjecture." He sniffed. "I don't have enough evidence to go further."
She still wasn't convinced John wouldn't try to hurt himself. The worry weighed in her mind for the rest of the day. She returned to the herana late that afternoon, limping a bit from the attentions of her most recent guest. The room was filled with commotion.
“I almost did!” John snapped. He put his feet on the floor and rested his face in his hands, taking deep breaths. That had been awful. He was still sweat dampened and warm. The sheet was twisted on the bed and he must have been thrashing around a lot to have woken his sub. His leg was throbbing and his head felt fuzzy and heavy.
“Is your Defense over?” He asked, saving the document and closing it. The doctor had lost the ‘angry badass predator’ look he had going on before, and now he just looked like his normal army doctor, contradictions and light-focusing abilities and all, in a jumper.
, picking his way into Jamie’s house in a matter of minutes, very nearly breaking his own personal lock picking record. Smallish home, decorated in lots of florals. Who needs a warrant now?
"You don't." She corrected. "Naughty boys who get high and worry us half to death don't get to have cake."
Sherlock gave him the phone and John read the texts. He scrolled down, shaking his head back and forth.
His own cock was drizzling, making his thighs sticky and wet but he held strong. He clutched the crop and stared over his prize, this beautiful man trusting him wholly to not hurt him but to make him soar.
John slipped into the flat, thrilled to see the kettle boiled and steaming. He poured himself a quick cup of tea and as it steeped, he retreated to his room to change into dry things. A pair of sweatpants and a fleece top felt much better than his damp work trousers and vomit-y shirt. He slipped fleece slippers on his feet and sighed in pleasure. He hurried downstairs to get the tea before it got bittered by the bag. The fridge yielded leftover Angelo's he'd forgotten about and he heated it up before carrying it all into the sitting room. When John appeared, food and tea in hand, Sherlock launched into "Angels we have Heard on High." The tension bled out of John's shoulders as he ate the cheesy sausage ravioli and chased it with creamy tea that was just tolerably hot to drink. He sank deeper into the sofa and sighed, glad to be home.
“Lestrade. He—there’s a body. Dom. Suspected poisoning.” He paused, shuffling his feet and looking longingly at his coat. “Interested?”
“Thank you, Miss.” He grunted. Her eyes were wide and she nodded and John realized she was frightened of him. He didn’t feel very scary. He felt like a broken dog. He finished the water and she took the cup, vanishing back into the room’s darkness.
“Easy. Take a breath.” Mike put his warm hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “We’ll get to the bottom of this, we always do. No need to fret.”
“Wait, wait.” John came up for air and rested his forehead on Sherlock’s chest. He squeezed his boy’s waist and peered up at him. “If I asked you to undress for me, would you?”
The car pulled up to a posh white building and Anthea popped the door open the moment the car pulled up to the curb. “Come, John.” She didn’t look up from her phone as the doctor got out and followed her inside. A gold plaque beside the doors read ‘Diogenes Club.’ Whatever that was. She lead him down some long silent halls before depositing him in a comfortably furnished office. John looked at the dark wood desk and the large portrait of the Queen on the wall.
Sherlock hummed and John could feel the delicious rumble of his voice in his shoulder. He rinsed him off and turned off the water.
He wanted to keep Sherlock safe and he found he was genuinely irritated that his sub was pushing him aside for this case. Did he really not see how much he resembled and the victims? He was the exact type: Pale, young, dark hair, submissive, male. It was insane. Was Sherlock
He debated ignoring it but went to answer. A bland servant of the castle was on the other side when he pulled the door open.
This wasn’t Sherlock’s fault. It was up to him to read the signs. To be able to read his submissive and see when it was too much. He’d fucked that up tonight, badly. He wanted to both put his fist through a plate of glass and sink to the floor crying, so he settled on making tea. He sipped the scalding beverage and took a deep breath, enjoying the way it warmed his gums.
“Sally?” John said. “We’ll see you there?” He didn’t think it would be a good idea to put Sherlock and Donovan in the same car for any length of time. John would probably end up spending the evening thinking of inventive punishments to quell his rude remarks…not that it would be a bad way to spend some time.
. A lot. He cared about John and he cared what happened to him. Never ever once had he cared about Seb or anyone the way he cared now about John. At least, not in this capacity. He imagined John being gone—being dead. This whole past few weeks would seem like nothing but a wonderful dream if John had died tonight. He’d wake up again in an empty bed and an empty flat. He’d do coke again and sullenly accept invitations from Mike and Betsy to have dinner. The unassuming doctor had awoken something excited and warm and alive in Sherlock that he never wanted to see extinguished.
John—and John loved him. He blinked back a swell of tears. Seb couldn’t ruin this. John couldn’t find out. If John found out, he would get upset and think Sherlock was cheating, then he’d leave. He never wanted John to leave.
"Me too." His eyes were suddenly filled with tears and he refused to accommodate them. A heavy, painful weight took up residence just under his ribcage, dragging his cheerful cloud down to the dirt. Sherlock had said they would see each other again before he left. He promised! John was looking forward to it. It was his bright spot in the darkness and now. He swallowed. It was fine. Sherlock was just a visiting guest. Of course he would have to go back to his kingdom to do whatever it was he was doing. He owed John nothing because John was nothing. Just a whore. Just a prisoner.
She seemed surprised, but she lifted the tape and permitted him past. Every officer on site was staring, watching as John walked beside Sherlock up to where the leg and arm lay on a blue tarp. A stained brown boot was beside the leg. They both crouched down to get a better look. “Didn’t realize I would be taking center stage.” John murmured at his sub.
Sherlock wanted to haul John to bed, tear his meager clothes off and demand to be fucked. He wanted to tuck John away, safe and sound and keep him from harm. He wanted to take him apart piece by trembling piece. He wanted to learn all of John's sweet spots and learn all the things that would make him shudder, gasp, cry out, and shiver. He wanted to feel John inside of him, filling him, fucking him. He wondered how John would sound, what noises he would make, how he tasted. He wanted to learn everything there was to learn about this magical, wonderful man. Oh how he wanted.
“There now.” Logan nudged his limp arm with his foot. “Nice and quiet. Pliant.” He pulled the gag out of his mouth and untied Sherlock’s wrists, then his ankles. “Come on, roll over.” Logan grabbed his body.
She startled. "Yes, Prince!" She darted off and had the sense to pull the door closed behind herself.
The group of tasked concubines headed for the bathing room once the assignments were read off. The others, grateful for the reprieve, retreated to various corners of the herana to play cards or dice.
“Because you’re my sub and your behavior reflects on me—and no one likes to be insulted, Sherlock. Especially police officers.”
He simply put his shoe and sock aside and untied the other shoe. “Lift.” He said. Sherlock did, and John took off that shoe and sock too and Sherlock stood there barefoot.
Sherlock stared at him and for a horrible moment John thought he’d be upset. He exhaled when Sherlock laughed and said, “good! What time is it?” He turned and looked at the candle clock. “Good God, is that accurate?”
“It was a long time ago.” He ground out. “If Sherlock doesn’t want that, then I won’t give it to him—not that this is any of your damned business!” He was shouting by the end, and the man looked up at him. “Is that what his other dom did to him?” John asked in a quiet voice. “Forced him to do things he didn’t want?”
“Good.” John gripped him harder and whispered in his ear, “I’m going to tie you up tonight, Private Holmes.”
“I’d say too that he was brunette or black-headed, going by the color of his arm and leg hair. As to where the rest of the body is…I have no idea but if I was a murderer, the Thames is an obvious dumping ground.” John looked up at all of them. Lestrade nodded, lost in thought as he looked down at the limbs. Sherlock beamed with delight, his chest puffed up and proud.
“You look good with that in your mouth.” He slipped his hand down to Sherlock’s bum and ran his fingers through his crack. “My cock would look even better between those nice pink lips.”
John smiled and hung a heavy coat, so dark grey it was nearly black, on a wooden rack in the corner. "Why do you hate him?" He asked.
Both of them were on their laptops a couple hours later, the remains of lunch scattered around the kitchen. Sherlock had his foot up on John’s knee as they both looked at their respective screens.
Melissa came in behind him with some supplies, bidding them all a cheerful “good morning!” She pulled his chart out. “I’m just going to check your vitals, Mr. Holmes.”
cheeky.” John pulled Sherlock’s long dressing gown on, tying it tight before trotting down the steps. He made sure he was totally covered and knocked politely on Mrs. Hudson’s door.
“Mrs. Hudson is a saint.” John said through a mouthful of pancake. “Pushing aside the fact that our landlady just saw our sex toys in the sitting room. That’s excellent.”
There was a pause, followed by a burst of raucous laughter. John's head snapped up. No one had ever laughed before. This was usually the part where they would demand he strip off his outfit (if this knee-length loincloth could be called an outfit) and begin pleasuring them.  John didn't see what was so funny.
"You have plenty of other dirty business to attend to." Sue winked and Mel hooted and John smiled as he cleaned off the last of the drips.
and Sherlock shifted around beside him, humming in his throat and pulling John closer. The doctor ignored the phone and settled on the pillow, watching his boy sleep.
Ideally John would be present when Sherlock worked further on this at Sherrinford. John would be able to provide further analysis of results and even possibly pinpoint what the substance was faster than Sherlock could. As a healer and a vigilante he was uniquely poised to hold the answer. Also, he would just be good company.
“You imagined me on my knees?” Sherlock asked. He grinned and John shook his head in amusement. No one naked on their knees should sound that smug. “Go get the clothes pins!” Sherlock declared.
touching me." He crossed his arms. The sun was warm but the air was cold, making him shiver and sweat at the same time. His back was starting to hurt again and John's used clothes were tacky on his skin. "I just," Sherlock began, he turned away from John and looked down, "want to go home."
He'd had a bad smoke years ago and he remembered throwing up a lot while Mrs. Hudson wiped his brow and looked on disapprovingly. He didn't remember feeling so awful in the aftermath. The ceiling tilted dangerously and Sherlock closed his eyes.
He rubbed the sponge down, then back up in long broad strokes. He rubbed across a trapezius muscle and squeezed the sponge, mesmerized by the trickle of clear warm water over his muscles.
Sherlock moaned and let his hand flop down. John humped him harder, smiling at the gasping sounds he made. He squeezed Sherlock’s hips and jammed into him, snarling as he orgasmed and spurted into Sherlock’s warm body. He fucked him fast, spending himself completely and then falling still and sweaty.
"Good." She said. "It'll be nice to have another one around. There's lots of injuries here. We're not allowed to leave the herana. All of us, thirty-some people are all confined to that sleeping area, the kitchen, and the baths. People get stir-crazy. Between escape attempts, the stuff the guests do to us, and all the fighting that goes on here," she nodded towards the main room, "you and I will always be busy."
The kiss started chaste and unsure. Sherlock didn't know if John really wanted this or if he was just humoring him. John kissed back, being enthusiastic like a good concubine should be. Sherlock's tongue nudged forward and…oh but that really felt rather nice. John kissed him a little deeper and Sherlock, more confident now, slid his hand around to cradle the back of John's neck. John stepped forward, closing the small gap between them. Their bodies pressed together from chest to knee and John smoothed his hand down Sherlock's hip. The Prince hummed in delight and they wrapped their arms around each other. Heat shot up John's spine and a delightful chill of gooseflesh trickled down his thighs. In the back of his mind he realized that this was the best kiss he'd ever had. No one, not even pretty Telma back in his village, who'd taken pity upon his aching body still recovering from the harpoon incident when he was fourteen and kissed him 'til he came in his pants, not even Sarah‒rest her soul‒came close to this moment.
Sherlock and Jim had gone to boarding school together on the continent. The two had taken an instant disliking to each other that rapidly morphed into hatred. Jim was a hot-tempered little shit and Sherlock's scathing insults hit home every time. There wasn't a month that went by that they didn't fight until blood was drawn and instructor intervention was required.
"I have an assignment after this one." John said. He was surprised to hear that his voice was steady. He was quaking.
and his cock was soft and small, not at all interested in this kind of spanking. This was awful. He heard John shift on the bed and he risked a glance over his shoulder. The doctor was facing him, his arms crossed over his chest, and he raised a brow when Sherlock looked over. He whirled and hastily focused back on the wall.
The car dropped him off at Sherlock’s—not that he’d been asked his opinion—and he strode up the steps. He was still riled from the Defense. The adrenaline was fading from his veins but he was still testy and ruffled. He knocked hard on the door.
“Okay.” John fingers twitched as he thought of ideas. “Okay, what do you definitely not want to do?”
“He was killing other submissives before their fictional cancer could.” Sherlock murmured, looking at his dom. “That’s what he meant about saving you. He assumed that I and all his other victims would get sick and die and their deaths would hurt their doms like Anthony’s death hurt him.” Sherlock was slumped down a little in his chair, his face pale. He looked up at Lestrade. “I’m assuming Anthony was the original ‘type’ for this case? White, male, under age 35, submissive.”
“Oh.” Sherlock blinked. “Thank you.” He took it and flipped open the keyboard, clicking out the fastest text John had ever seen typed.
Sherlock peered around. Seb’s text was still fresh in his mind and he kicked it under a rug in his palace. He was not going to think about that. Not now. He hadn’t responded, so Seb would probably stop texting him.
John heard more noises below. It sounded like a group of guests were pouring into the room. He heard snippets of male voices.
Logan plunged the knife between Sherlock’s right ribs. The sudden pain of it jolted more adrenaline into his body and he elbowed Logan as hard as he could, but it was like a mouse pouncing on a lion.
Maybe because the last time he’d seen Sherlock he was hurt, so his subconscious decided to injure him even more and throw him in the murky soup of his Afghanistan memories. Sherlock was fine and well and John knew this. He wasn’t dead on the side of a road somewhere, he was in 221. Probably slicing up a tongue or something. John found himself smiling at the image of the manic sub awake at—he looked at the clock—half three in the morning, hunched over a body part like some mad scientist. He put the cup in the sink and went back to the bed, sitting on the edge and picking up his phone. He had the absurd desire to text him, just to make sure he was alright. He dropped the phone on the side table with a clatter, disgusted at himself. Text him? For what? What would he even say? ‘Oh hey, sorry to bother you at three in the bloody morning, but I dreamed you died. Are you okay? Cheers.’ It was utter lunacy. He didn’t even know Sherlock. Annoyed at himself for crushing on this poor unknowing sub like a horny Uni student, John curled up under the blankets and slept soundly for the rest of the night.
“Ow!” The surprise and genuine shock at the sting of it was evident in his tone. The detective looked back at John over his shoulder with alarm shooting through his moon wide eyes.
"You sounded like you were reading your own death sentence." He smiled and propped his head up on his hand. "You hate it here, but then…" he looked at John from head to feet. "That’s obvious by the way you're standing."
John smiled. “Um, well, it’s like I have this desire to kill and destroy anything that’s making me feel threatened, whether it’s friend or foe or human or animal. Anything that’s a threat to me or my sub can no longer live. My body chemistry changes and I get a rush of adrenaline and a huge burst of testosterone. Suppressants keep those testosterone levels low.” His face turned pink and he chuckled. “It’s a little embarrassing, really.” He shifted on the floor and rubbed his neck. “I really scared the hell out of him last night. Were you frightened?” John asked.
“He’s fine. Long story short—he decided to take a walk and now he needs to be picked up. Thanks for the meal Betsy, I’ll call you guys tomorrow?”
Mary and Paul exchanged a glance. "We'll leave you to it then." They moved on to Greg. John watched Sherlock measure and drip things into a bowl. He made dough and put in the refrigerator, timing it. He glanced up at John and gave him a smile. John smiled back. It had been nice getting to know Sherlock these past weeks. He was rude and antisocial and could be very funny. He could read people to an almost alarming degree and shown John his deductive skills on the bus, scrutinizing the other bakers. John had been amazed. He really wanted to ask for Sherlock's mobile number but always managed to convince himself not to for a myriad of stupid reasons. If he said no John would feel like an idiot, so instead the doctor chose to live with the torment of wanting to, but not doing so.
Sherlock grunted and some of his own tension melted away. It felt good to hear John say that. "It's your Defense." Sherlock said into his shoulder. He smelled of dust and old fabric and day old deodorant. Sherlock smiled and leaned back, searching his dom's face. "Your eyes are dark, your lips red." He glanced down. "You've had a partial erection since we walked into this room. You're very sexy when you're Defensive." He gave his dom a wicked little grin.
They did just that, and the next morning Sherlock was awoken by warm hands rolling him onto his belly and groping at his thighs. He wasn’t surprised. John had been especially dominant right after the last time he’d subbed, and Sherlock knew he needed to regain that dominant head space. He spread his knees and lifted his bum obligingly and was greeted with John’s insistent fingers working him open, followed by the full pressure of his cock. Sherlock grunted into the pillow as John held him down with a hand on his scruff, taking him fast and hard. It stung a bit and he smiled and squeezed the pillow, whimpering softly into the bed as his husband and dominant fucked him. John leaned over him, still thrusting, and nibbled his shoulder, lapping the area before he bit down and humped furiously, spilling inside. Sherlock pressed his face into the cotton, exposing his neck as he waited for John’s commands.
Now Molly was confused. “I…I gave him some results this morning, about Owen, but I haven’t heard from him since then. Is everything alright?”
He was far less interested in the 'why' of it all. He was royal and thus a target. Jim ruled with an iron fist and groups like John's highwaymen hellbent on Jim's demise bubbled up all over Hibern. These groups existed in Britannia as well (there was always someone who opposed the crown) but it wasn't nearly as heated as the climate in Hibern. Funny how treating your subjects well made them less likely to want to kill you.
He left the alcove, taking care as ever to peek out into the narrow corridor before sneaking out. All clear. He went back to his pallet. If Jim had ordered this one person’s death, who else had he killed? Rather, who had his ‘hired hound’ killed for him? It was one thing for Jim to kill his own people indiscriminately. He held the highest rank in Hibern. There was no one to take him to task. It was quite another thing to be ordering the murder of foreign nobles. Surely even a king couldn’t do that? He laid uneasily on his pallet before a fitful sleep took him. His dreams were full of blood and knives.
“Ah!” He growled out a shout and tightened his hold in Sherlock’s hair, holding him steady as he pumped into his mouth and spurted across his tongue. Sherlock held still as John fucked his mouth with easy, deep thrusts.
“Jesus.” John rubbed his hands hard through his hair. “I’m so sorry, can we, you need to drink something. And eat too. Can I look at your—”
"Evil spirits." John said. He shrugged. At Sherlock's skeptical expression he said, "it's not sillier than kissing under a dead plant."
John Watson was flabbergasted when he received the phone call one Tuesday afternoon informing him that he was going to be a contestant on
Sherlock scoffed. "Please. I gave them to Mrs. Hudson. She’ll get them into the hands that need them most.”
John wasn't stupid enough to agree. He decided to change the subject lest he make his true feelings about Moriarty known. Heaven knows how the Prince had worked out how much he hated it here. It was possible Sherlock was a spy sent by Jim to see how he really felt. Royals were sneaky and conniving like that. John wasn't going to fall for it.
Sherlock wasn't even sure what he had done to provoke him. Such was the mercurial temperament of doms though, right? Cruel and manipulative, that's what Seb had been. At least, according to Betsy and Mike. Sherlock didn’t really know. He didn’t have a whole lot of experience with doms other than Seb. His ‘relationship’ wall in his palace was in a dimly lit white drywall corridor and the notes there limited pretty much to what he learned from Seb. There were lots of angry holes punched in that wall. If Betsy could see that wall, she would probably be sad and cook him something. Stamford seemed very happy with her and Sherlock wondered sometimes what names she called him. How she made him feel small. That's what doms did, right? Breezed in and out of your life for sixteen years, making stupid subs drop to their knees at their beck and call, using sex as a weapon. Mycroft was right. Subs were the weaker dynamic.
"What?" He said, dejection coloring his tone. His shoulders sagged. "Now? To who? I had two appointments tonight already!"
Sherlock folded his hands over his sacrum and finally, finally went quiet. John took a deep breath. Boundary testing, that’s what this was. So far they’d had a pretty easy go of things, all things considered. Sherlock obeyed with a general minimum of fuss and any fuss was met with scolding that usually turned into groping and orgasms. Sherlock had been happy to be away from his dick of a former dom and wasn’t giving John any grief because of it. Now though, it seemed he was testing his dom to see how hard he’d have to push before John pushed back.
“Lots of naughty subs have felt this paddle and it’s made every single one cry. Since you only disobeyed me a little bit, I’ll make sure you don’t cry, but make no mistake,” he slapped the paddle against his palm. The clap! burst out and Sherlock startled. “You will be sore.” John took him by the forearm and sat on the edge of the bed. He pulled him down, mindful that he couldn’t balance as well without the complete use of his arms, and adjusted him over his lap. His prone body was supported by the bed and he was resting on his bent elbows.
Sherlock leaned off the mantle and got to his knees before his dom. He opened his mouth and sucked John’s cock in as far as it could go. He couldn’t get him all in his mouth, unfortunately. John was just too big. The dom didn’t seem to mind and Sherlock decided he’d practice this so he could give him this kind of pleasure. John sighed and leaned back in the chair, clenching his arse muscles to gently fuck his sub’s mouth.
In fact, it was all so amazing that Sherlock wondered how long it would all last. He had nothing to go on. No experiments that could provide data, no hypotheses to test. John was here now, but how long until he got sick of him? How long until the severed limbs and case work got to be just too much? Mycroft always told him his
“C’mon.” John encouraged. He shifted on the mattress, straightening up and adjusting his grip. “Show me how you get off…”
“Oh you two!” She gushed. Her arms were laden with a wicker basket containing piles of their clean laundry.
Sue wandered over to him while he was drawing out circles on wax paper so he could measure the piped dough evenly. He needed two dough circles for each pie pop.
He binned the paper plate. He was officially bored. He glanced at his phone and saw that only fifteen minutes had passed. Dear Lord.
Sherlock turned away from the forensic tech. “He probably worked as a repairman of some kind, maybe fixed home appliances or the Tube.”
“I won’t leave.” He rested their foreheads together. “Alright? You would have to kick me out screaming.”
"‒those bruises are huge and you're getting x-rayed." John told him. "This isn't an argument or a request, Sherlock." His voice rose in volume. "You could have internal hemorrhaging or hairline fractures, or, or anything. You're getting looked at today whether you like it or not! This isn't an argument!"
Sherlock took an offered bite of toast, chewing happily. He was warmed by the thought that John would fly into a rage and kill a man to save him. “How many times have you been in it?” He swallowed.
They exchanged thank yous and goodbyes and Sherlock and John took the lift down and wandered out into the sunshine. "Tube, I guess." John said. "A cab to the hospital would cost a fortune."
“Well,” now it was John’s turn to look away. He licked his lips and felt a blush creeping up his face. He smiled. He had just come down his sub’s throat but
“Yeah. But black and white. The guy thought someone was outside. He was really skittish, looking out the curtains. He heard something in the garden, like a banging sound and he took off out the front door. I managed to get hold of one of the knives. I cut the rope he tied me with and left through the open front door.” He laughed humorlessly. “The door was just open.” He swallowed and Blair handed him a foam cup of water. “Thanks.” He sipped. “I was feeling pretty light headed and I thought he might come find me, you know? I walked a long time, I think. I don’t really know how long. The moon was out so I could see. I just remember walking along the dirt road. Slowly. I don’t know how I managed to get up and walk, even. I was so out of it.”
"This time!" Mycroft stomped up to the foot of his bed. "You could have been mugged, murdered, thrown in the Thames and we'd never know! We’d never know what happened to you!"
Both men slept in the next morning. The important parts of the case were finished and all that was left was some paperwork that Scotland Yard could deal with. John didn’t have work, and he dragged himself awake at ten am long enough to dash off a text to his therapist, Ella.
die. He was the one. He was the person John wanted to spend his life with. God, why hadn’t he said that to him yet? Sherlock could die never knowing. John couldn’t think of that. He couldn’t dwell on whether or not Sherlock was going to be dead when they found him. He sure as hell wasn’t going to break down crying in front of Lestrade. He had to focus now on finding his partner and getting him safe. Sherlock would roll his eyes and scoff and call John sentimental if he knew he was fighting back tears. The doctor smiled to himself and called Sherlock’s phone again. It was at least something to do.
Sherlock grabbed the morphine drip and cranked it up, closing his eyes. That had been disgustingly exhausting. John and the nurse stripped off their gloves.
the truth, he didn’t know. One of his minions must have seen Sherlock exit the flat and make the trek to Speedy’s.
carriage. The guard may as well paint a target on the sides. If safety was an issue, Sherlock thought they’d be better off wearing sackcloths and walking on foot. No one would think to look for the King and Prince meandering in the mud as commoners; he knew that from his experience in the Barrens. He’d once suggested this to Lestrade. His response had been to blink at him owlishly before giving him a firm, “no.”
“Sherlock, I need to ask you…what was he talking about with the texts?” He looked up, concerned and sad. “Has he been contacting you?”
Sherlock grunted. Mycroft wasn’t wrong. Violet was an interesting enough person but there wasn’t a soul on earth who could make Sherlock actually want to visit Hibern. Mycroft sighed. “You’d have a much more pleasant time if you’d lose this attitude.”
He wasn’t sure what hot rock energy was, but he was happy to attempt to change her opinion on the necessity of using her dynamic regularly. “Think of it like food. Just like a body will become malnourished without proper food and vitamins, so your quality of life will suffer if you ignore the needs of your orientation. Go to the chemist’s and buy a bottle of Domall.” He said, quoting a popular brand of dom-specific compounds. “Follow the instructions on the package and if you don’t feel better in a fortnight, call.”
distraught about his death. Concerned in a polite way, but with his business and his multiple subs, he’s unlikely to be the murderer. He might be able to provide an alibi too, once we figure out an exact time of death. Molly’s on that now.”
“I think I’ll get going. Thanks for everything.” Sherlock stood up. If Vincent touched him again he’d drop the ‘silly sub’ persona like a hot rock and slug the guy across the face.
Lestrade had wisely stayed back this whole time and he cuffed the man and handed him off to backup officers. John came away from it all with only bumps and bruises. When Sherlock stood up he had a metal star-shaped ornament sticking out of his bicep. Blood drizzled down his suit sleeve. Two customers fainted at the sight of it and the paramedics were summoned. Sherlock refused to linger in the shop, insisting that John would make him right.
John reached around his hip and found his hard cock. He squeezed it. Sherlock let out a little hiss-gasp and the dom left it alone for now. He had a plan.
“Ah, you did!” Seb pointed at him. “You’re doing that thing with your face where you try to hide everything.”
He hung up his coat and sat on the chair for three seconds before his bottom convinced him to stand. He leaned over the desk with a dreamy little sigh and logged in to his website.
And sent it off. He put the phone down and went back to the microscope, a little grin playing at his lips.
“Yes.” He smirked at him. “C’mon, did you think I would kick you out? Break up with you? If you remember, you’re moving in tomorrow.”
. John is…" He shook his head. "I'll never see him again." He looked up at her, tears in his eyes. He opened his mouth, closed it, and looked down. She stood, bending to pull him into a hug.
“Look,” Lestrade picked up a pen and tapped it a few times on the desk. He threw it down and stood up to pace. Sherlock watched, amused. “I may be way off here,” Lestrade said.
“It didn’t seem like nothing.” John’s voice was cool and Sherlock turned around when he heard the mug shoved onto the counter with a clatter. “Last night was hardly nothing, Sherlock.” He took a few steps into the detective’s space and the sub looked away, taking a few steps back himself.
Don’t you see? The case takes precedence over everything else. Let me organize first, then you can teach me a lesson.”
“A few more.” John countered. “You remember your word?” He adjusted his legs, getting Sherlock in a better position.
John looked at the sumptuous bed with longing. He had slept there last night. He and Sherlock had talked until John nodded off. He’d slept like the dead.
“That doesn’t give you an excuse to be so disrespectful!” He snapped down at him. “You’re already getting punished, don’t make it worse.”
was in charge. He yanked a dressing gown over his shoulders and swept into the kitchen, ready for a fight, ready for John to be waiting for him. What he did find was slightly anticlimactic and actually rather nice.
"Actually you told me not to blow the flat up or gas myself." Sherlock corrected. He forced down a smile, pleased at his own perceptive sense of timing.
Sherlock swallowed his bite of food. "M'sorry." He said sincerely. "I didn't mean to make everyone worry."
Sherlock clenched his teeth at the arsehole's voice. Obviously he had been given a spirited mount on purpose. No doubt Seb wanted to see him struggle with it all morning. There were five of them on this blasted hunt, each armed with a pistol courtesy of Castle Chilgrave's well-stocked armory. The Gräfin of Saxony, Violet Hunter, was one of the five. Sherlock had met her through parties and various diplomatic functions and discovered she had a quick mind and an interest in natural science. He fondly remembered passing an otherwise dull evening with her discussing, among other things, mycology, unexplained phenomena and cryptids, and mysterious recent deaths over crystal cut glasses of Champagne. She and her husband were staying at Chilgrave to meet with Hibern’s reclusive queen, Lady Siobhan Glundub-Maolconaire.
Donovan was coming down the hall when he rounded the corner to head for his rooms. He’d forbidden her from riding with them.
. Greg had never seen him so pliant and soft. It was because John was here, he knew. He felt privileged that they were comfortable enough to show him this side of their relationship. He poured milk in his coffee (strong enough to walk. John knew what he was doing) and smiled, letting out a long, breathy "ahhhh" as the heat filled his belly.
"One spoon, please." King Holmes said. John sprinkled a spoonful into the cup, stirred it with a separate spoon, and picked the saucer up. He ensured his grip was firm before he moved it towards the King.
the blowjob and the painfully delicious scolding and paddling. The big cup of coffee had been thoughtful and Sherlock contemplated this as he stared out the window. He’d like to reciprocate, but how? Should he ask the doctor to move in? Was it too soon? They’d only been dating a short time, but everything seemed to be going well. He’d certainly
“Are you up to talking for a bit?” Greg asked the detective, pulling a small black recorder out of his desk drawer. Donovan slipped into his office then, a pad of yellow paper and a pen in her hands. She gave Sherlock the tiniest smile. “Recovery going well?”
Sherlock lay limp on the tarp, breathing deep long breaths. He blinked slowly as a haze gradually settled over his body. His arms ached. His torso throbbed. He was sticky with dried blood and the stink of iron was overwhelming. Each time he closed his eyes he thought of John. John was coming for him. John loved him. The thought gave him strength and he formulated a small plan.
“You’re thinking very loudly.” John said with a grin. “And I think something else is more interested now too.” John tilted Sherlock’s head down to stare at his own dick. It was fully hard now. Sherlock took a deep breath, his pulse starting to race.
“That’s imported leather from Italy.” Nina said. “The lining is a silk blend and very breathable.” John noted the chrome buckle and D ring. Sherlock ducked his head and John pulled off the first reject. He slipped the second one on Sherlock’s throat and buckled it. The sub looked in the mirror. He gulped and blinked at his reflection. The pewter grey stood out on his pale skin and as he moved his head, the blue would just barely peek out. He really liked the way that looked. Sherlock touched the shining silver buckle and the D ring, saying nothing. He licked his lips. He glanced at his dom’s face in the mirror. His eyes were shining.
John shook his head. He could never, ever abuse a sub in any way. One of his kinks was giving pleasure, and the thought of abusing a sub that had placed that kind of trust and intimacy in him was so repelling that he had trouble even conceiving of it. The sub in him winced and a protective urge surged through his chest.
Sherlock looked disgusted. “I would never panic under your hands, you fool.” He kissed John’s forehead and ran his hand impertinently over his dom’s bottom. “Shower, Captain?”
The cook, a ginger-haired woman with a bright face and warm eyes, turned and kissed him on the lips. "Well Mike Stamford, look at you all handsome in your suit and tie." She winked at him and turned back to pan of sizzling stir-fried vegetables. She appeared to be essentially the female version of Stamford in both build and demeanor and John got the impression she probably loved to spoil her sub and his mates with food. He liked her instantly. A ring on her little finger echoed the chain pattern of Mike's collar and John figured they must be pretty serious.
“No.” Lestrade corrected, “you and John will go to Mudd and see if anyone there knew the victim. Sally,” he glanced up from writing his notes to glance at the Sergeant, “go with them.”
Next time. There would be next time, right? He nodded to himself and closed the laptop. The knot of feelings didn’t seem so tight anymore. In fact, nothing hurt at all. He contemplated this for a moment, then went to the kitchen to tend his experiments.
“Get the massage oil. Yellow glass bottle. It’s small.” John said. Sherlock rooted past the paddle and some cuffs and pulled out a little bottle of oil. “Yes, perfect, come to me now and kneel so I can tell you your punishment.”
"Fold everything." Sherlock said. John did, the corners of his clothes crisp and neat and military. He set them on the bed and then stood at attention, awaiting orders, and it was here that Sherlock paused. What now? What should he have John do?
Sherlock grabbed the pillow. John sat on the far side of the sofa and angled the table out so he could access both his and Sherlock’s dishes easily.
He fought back, pushing further into Sherlock’s mouth as he squeezed his bottom. Sherlock relented almost instantly and John broke the kiss.
“He was slit across the throat.” Molly pointed at the crusty laceration by his neck, “but that’s not what killed him.”
"If he wasn’t such an arsehole and if he had an ounce of diplomacy, he wouldn't be in this cold war with Scotland.”
“Male, I’d say, though it’s difficult to tell with half the body missing the way it is…” He looked at John and the doctor nodded, picking up the deductions.
Sherlock pushed up and rubbed his hand through his messy hair. He glanced down at his shirt, damp with his ejaculate. The inked lines on the page were smeared to nothing.
“Maybe you’ll have better luck with him.” Sally muttered to John. She handed him the bag and headed towards the other employee. John gave the evidence bag over to Sherlock and stood beside the door, out of the way. He didn’t want to be here. He was feeling sulky and irritated and not at all willing to help.
“Yep.” She said. “I don’t know how much was in his system initially, as the body had been in the water for so long. Evidence of fifteen milligrams of it were found in Owen’s tissue. Dixon’s limbs didn’t have traces of anything.”
Greg explained how Jim wanted more Britannian soldiers guarding the west and north. “Mycroft wants more saltpeter from Jim in exchange for the soldiers but Jim’s not budging. And anyway he doesn’t need more of our soldiers.” Greg said. “He has plenty of his own soldiers and already has some of ours. The idiot went and got himself into Scotland’s bad graces so now he’s flaunting his military. If it was up to me we’d pull all our people out of there and let Jim deal with his own messes.”
"Don't know who it was yet." Kate said. "The attendants are scrambling, trying to get everyone accounted for. That's a bad way to go‒what if the water doesn't kill you, you know?" She shuddered.
