Before he had time to soak in what she had said, and correct her that Steve was very much still on the market, most definitely not interested in Tony, and probably waiting on Gladus to make the first move, she turned to Peter, sweet smile still gracing her lips.
“Mister Steve said you didn’t want hugs, Mister Iron Man,” Peter warned, the five year old furrowing his brow and frowning, lower lip jutting out in a pout. Steve’s gaze fell to Tony, who opened his arms a little wider, an unsure smile gracing his lips.
sleep tonight,” he knew that if he could see her face right now, she’d have a gentle smile playing on her lips, full of sympathy and care. This was the smile she usually had right before she gave him one of her light, barely there hugs that always made him feel like he was made of glass.
anybody here. I’m alone. With a child,” and simply just saying such a thing brought shivers of fear down his spine. Tony was still trying is hardest to deny the reality that despite learning jack shit about parenting, the life of a child was in his calloused hands.
“Go to hell, JARVIS,” Tony barked, not needing the sass from his AI that he had lovingly  installed.
reminded him that he’s only in the guest room, that Peter’s Iron Man was not a helicopter flying over Afghanistan desert, and the writhing monkey was only a five year old who, apparently, wanted toast.
tried to give Tony the space and time he had needed. Although he didn’t exactly approve of Stark’s tendency to hide from conflict, he always attempted to give him an ample amount of alone time before approaching. But he couldn’t wait three days this time. He barely made it past one, too wrecked by Peter’s seemingly constant mood of sadness. The boy had really taken Tony’s reaction to heart. Peter hadn’t known what he had done wrong, but the guilt was obviously eating him up inside. Steve could not handle seeing Peter feel bad for simply being excited to meet Iron Man, and therefore, Sunday afternoon found themselves confronting a reluctant Tony in the library.
“He does?” he found this hard to believe. Cap was goddamn perfect, there was no way the man had ever come close to destroying Pete’s vision. The super soldier was the best Dad anyone could ever have, there was no way-
“Oh, right. Okay,” and he honestly  wasn’t sure what he was feeling. It was an odd mix of relief and something that could have possibly been disappointment. Sadness, maybe? It was hard to decipher the tight ball of feelings replacing his thumping heart in that moment.
Tony ate breakfast with Pete the next morning, distracting the child as Cap talked on the phone with Fury about the morning’s headlines. Fury was scolding the Captain about taking the Hulk off the field and not thinking about the media fire, if the loud shouts from the other end were anything to go by. Which honestly didn’t make much sense to Tony because wasn't SHIELD dismantled?
“You’re full of crap, Tony. Call Bruce. You have to be at tomorrow's meeting with everything prepared, no exceptions. Make sure to get
It was after breakfast, Peter full with blueberry waffles and Steve feeling good after a refreshing morning run, that they got onto the elevator and headed down to Tony’s workshop. The mechanic would freak that Steve was bringing Pete down, but maybe catching Stark off his guard by bringing the object that was causing him distress would be what they needed to resolve this.
For some reason, Tony had assumed the walk to the berry lady would only take a couple of minutes. For some reason, Tony forgot that Steve Rogers did not get tired of walking and a five year old boy had all the energy in the world. For some reason, Tony did not remember the fact that neither the Captain nor the small child would have a sense of exhaustion or time when it came to a stroll in the summer heat.
“What’s up Cap?” Tony greeted, not looking up from the device in his hand. It dawned on Steve that Tony had yet to realize that Peter was with him, because although there was tension in the mechanic’s shoulders, he didn’t look like he was ready to bolt.
And although the prolonged shrug was cute, Tony couldn’t move on from the subject. Even if his brain pleaded with him to pretend it never even happened.
” Tony shot back, and it was imperative that Pepper know this, because although he had made many mistakes in his lifetime, accidentally creating a small human had gladly not been one of them.
“Does anyone know what that was about?” Steve tried, looking for reactions from any of the others. He had read Tony’s files, researching the torture methods mentioned and looking up dictionary definitions. He learned everything he could about what was mentioned in the file. So for the life of him, he could not imagine why Bruce cringed and looked down at his worn hands, fiddling his thumbs nervously.
But Tony was the only available adult unit left in the tower, and the child needed to be fed, no matter how badly Tony wanted to ignore it.
“Yes, you can. Peter loves you!” Cap exclaimed as he dug out his duffel bag, stuffing his pile of clothes in it without caring to fold them, “You’re great at co-paren-”
“Peter, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have yelled like that. Did I scare you?” Tony apologized, resting his hands on his knees instead of placing them on the boy, not wanting to scare him. He knew better than anyone how one comforting hand coming towards him could bring back memories. And Tony really hoped there weren’t any memories
“Yeah, sure,” Tony responded with a lazy wave of his hand to the empty air, as if Pepper could see it, “See you tomorrow.”
“Peter Parker!” and oh no, he had used the tone his dad would use; that deep, ground shaking tamber that lodged fear right in every throat of the children who heard it.
He inhaled a ginormous gulp of breath, his head going slightly dizzy, before releasing it in one rush, blowing it straight into Cap’s face, slightly rustling the blonde hair. Tony’s mind quickly supplied him with the tune to “America, the Beautiful”, likening Steve’s-
“‘Kay, toast, I know, stop screamin’,” Tony protested, turning his head on his pillow to glance at the clock positioned on his side table and
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. You don’t need to tell me,” Tony paused, not knowing what the hell he was doing. He had a hard enough time comforting
Many would accuse him of his hero complex, arguing that Steve had only brought Peter home because saving people was the only thing he knew how to do. Of course, this accusation wasn’t necessarily wrong. Steve couldn’t deny that seeing someone in need caused him to go softer than the drill sergeants from the 40’s would have tolerated. But then again, if this had been the reason for taking the child, then Steve should have also been equally okay with sending Peter off with a capable, non-superhero-crime-fighting family.
It hadn’t gone wrong, necessarily. Stark hadn’t ran away, so obviously it had already gone better than it did the first time the two met. But Peter didn’t understand the body language of “do not touch”, giving away hugs and kisses to a man who didn’t seem to know what to do with them. Steve should probably have interfered when the little guy had face planted into Tony’s chest, but then again it had been so
And then he stepped into the bathroom, smile slipping from his face, recalling what bathtime entailed. Peter was sat on the bath mat, waiting for Tony to help him get ready.
“Okay, buddy. What stories does Mr. Steve usually tell you?” Tony asked as he sat down on the edge of the bed, near where Pete’s feet lay. The boy smiled and snuggled into the blankets, looking outrageously comfortable and cute in his space pajamas. The undeniable surge of affection hit him like a freight train; Tony had never thought it possible to get attached to a kid so quickly. Children were always such a difficult topic for him, but Peter was turning everything the genius knew upside down.
It was supposed to be comforting. And it was, to an extent. Hands warm like a furnace, resting gently on his shoulders; eyes Tony could get lost in looking down at him with such earnest. Yet the words were not comforting. They left no room for failure and Tony was all about making mistakes.
was going to be the one left alone to take care of him! I can’t do this Rogers, I just can’t-” Tony was freaking out now, waving his hands about in wide gestures, trying to convey to the Captain that his distress was much more important than any mission the man could be assigned.
As Clint left in his taxi, Tony felt a very small flutter of something not quite like fear in his chest. Like the first rain drop of a forecasted hurricane, or possibly akin to the feeling before going down the hill of an outrageously tall roller coaster. He had ignored it however, chalking it up to some odd sort of separation anxiety, which he didn't even question because what was one more issue on his already long list?
“You’re welcome, Sir,” JARVIS replied, and Tony knew it wasn’t possible for an AI to get choked up, but he swore he could hear emotions catch in JARVIS’s metaphorical throat.
Steve received a wet snort at this, as though it was funny, and Cap was confused until Tony mumbled into his chest, “You said dick.”
But of course, he was only overthinking the situation, as he did most of the time when it involved Peter.
Maybe Steve brought Peter home because he reminded the super soldier of the late Peggy Carter. Sweet, caring, and ready to do the right thing. He had thought he had seen Peggy in those tearful eyes, but that brown wasn’t Ms. Carter’s shade of brown. It was a beautiful brown, with flecks of gold and dark reds woven subtly into the warm chocolate color. Eyes that were
Bruce had quickly volunteered himself to stay and look after Peter, snapping at the team to get a move on before casualties started building. Luckily, they had come home after with barely a scratch, Hulk’s absence on the battlefield not having been missed. But the media latched onto it with their conspiracy theories, wondering where the green Avenger had gone. It sat on all of their shoulders, an uncomfortable prickle as the media breathed down their necks. Of course, no one was bothered by the media itself; they had dealt with the pressure before. It was the threat of uncovering what the Avengers were hiding that had the team on high alert. Because keeping Peter a secret was high priority, and a leak was much worse than an announcement at a PR conference.
As he replayed the scene over and over in his mind, the weight on his shoulders feeling lighter than it had in a little while, he started a new design for a mini Iron Man suit. Designed to fly around a child’s room, emitting a calm hum to help the boy fall fast asleep.
It felt as though the air had been punched out of his lungs, rushing out of him as if it couldn’t get out fast enough. Dad? Gladus thought…. Dad? And ‘Dad number two’ implied there was a ‘Dad number one,’ which meant Steve Rogers, which meant Gladus thought they were both dads, which meant Gladus thought they were
Tony mocked her, humming unsurely, as if he didn’t always come running to Pepper when anything happened; as if he didn’t know she was a good listener.
And oh no, Tony looked about ready to puke, the man’s eyes were glassy with unshed tears. There was a sound of a faint rip as the shirt hem that Tony had been anxiously fiddling with tore at Steve’s words. Cap really needed to stop.
I loved this chapter, and I hope all of you love it too! Don't forget to leave feedback, I live off of every single review XD
Tony locked gazes with Steve, and when the mechanic didn’t turn away, Steve closed the distance between them, gently wrapping his arms around the shorter man.
The each retired to their rooms, leaving Steve to stand alone in the living room, watching the city below and contemplating just what Tony had felt the need to pull out of his personal file.
“Toast? Please?” Peter pleaded, pulling the man out of his musings. And Tony really wanted to say no, because the bed was comfortable and taking care of the child was something he was not qualified for. If social workers caught wind of the Avengers leaving young, impressionable Peter Parker with notorious ex-playboy Tony Stark, they would all collectively have an aneurysm. And even though Tony had stated, several times he might add, that he was done with that lifestyle in front of heaps of reporters, it didn’t seem to make a difference. He would still be seen as the man from his party days.
Cap’s words echoed loudly in his skull, bouncing off of each other in an intimidating fashion. The man’s words had implied that ‘bath and sleep’ shouldn’t be too hard to accomplish. And Tony had never heard screams coming from the bathroom when Cap corralled the boy in for his bathtime, so it was plausible that Tony could do this. Peter wasn’t a bad child after all, how hard could this be?
“Mr. Steve always tells me a story before I go to bed,” Peter mumbled, voice thick with sleep. The boy seemed to be barely awake, but Tony knew that if he did not tell Pete a story, the boy would not be going to sleep anytime soon.
The boy leapt up from his position on the carpeted ground, eyes wide with worry at the thought that Iron Man would be sad. Tony couldn’t help the sharp twist of something unforgivingly sweet, originating somewhere underneath his rib-cage. It made him smile, and the sensation only spread as Peter all but threw his toys into his toy bin, cleaning up after himself as quickly as possible before dashing to the bathroom.
It was hard not to miss the look of intense disappointment that Bruce sent the billionaire's way. It was the same glare that Steve’s mom would give him when she knew he had broken the flower vase, despite his insistence that he hadn’t.
“I will admit, I’m very disappointed to see Steve is a taken man. But you’re soft on the eyes too, so I’ll let this one slide. You both make a wonderfully good-looking pair.”
Peter paused his playing, looking off into the distance with a very Cap-esque concentration. The boy nodded to himself as if resolving an internal conversation, eyebrows furrowed in determination, before turning back to his toys, “Twelve o’clock.”
When the team had first started living at Stark Tower, the citizens had gone haywire. There was an excitement in the city, everyone keeping their eyes wide open in hopes of catching one of the Avengers doing mundane, everyday things. The Whole Foods business had skyrocketed across America when Thor had been spotted eyeing the olive bar at the Whole Foods on West 24th street. The Starbucks on 7th street had never ceased to be crowded after Tony Stark and some unknown man (Bruce) were spotted buying a coffee and some green tea. And of course, the media flipped their shit when the adonis of a man, Captain America, was spotted running in Central Park at the buttcrack of dawn a few days after moving into the Tower.
“No,” Peter protested, crossing his arms with a determined pout to his lips. And Tony, for the life of him, could not understand why ‘no’, because the toast looked perfectly fine. The butter pools were now gone, surely Peter could eat the toast.
When Cap had moved into the tower, Tony had tried to tell the man that he could bring Bucky along. The troubled soldier had obviously had a rough go of it, and probably didn’t have a place he could call home. It was the least Tony could do; maybe even offer an arm tune-up as an apology. But Cap had only shook his head, saying Barnes had chosen to stay in Wakanda for his health.
“No killing!” Peter exclaimed, before falling into another fit of laughter, splashing more water out of the white ceramic tub. Tony couldn’t help but chuckling along. Tony attempted to commence the bathing once more, but Peter making a game of it to dash away from the genius. This, of course, got old very quickly, until he gave up on the rest of the bath, settling for the half-washed child.
And that was slightly confusing, because when had this lady ever met Peter’s late father? Did this pair go back? Was this Peter’s actual Grandmother? It was at this point, while Tony was caught in a rambling thought, that she finally turned away from Peter’s beaming smile to land her gaze on him. Immediately, her brows furrowed in confusion.
Tony pressed his face harder into Steve’s shirt, as if he wanted to become part of the fabric. Peter and Stark were sometimes eerily alike.
It was a perfectly warm, windy summer day in the city, something Tony could fully appreciate when Central Park finally came into view. Across the Columbus Circle, standing next to a FedEx office, the green trees of the park could be seen. Tony almost felt his shoulders drop with the feeling of relief when the screaming of children could be heard over the car traffic. He looked down to see Peter with a smile on his face, still gripping the life out of the older man’s fingers. Despite how hard Tony looked at Peter, he could not find a smidge of disappointment on the child’s face, and god he had never felt so relieved.
The only evidence that the man was still alive was the small pieces of ‘Peter Proofing’ that had been laid around the tower. Random things that popped up, such as plastic covers for light sockets and squishy corner covers for table edges. New protocols, like “Feed The Creature”, which would supposedly alert a nearby Avenger when Peter was hungry. However, Steve was pretty sure it only alerted him, because Natasha had been in the kitchen when JARVIS alerted the Captain from his workout four floors down. And then there had been protocol “Change The Payload”, which was there to alert when Peter needed his diaper changed. And that’s when Steve knew that Tony didn’t know anything about children, because the five year old child was already potty trained and assured Steve that he was in fact “a big boy” and could use the potty “just fine”.
And from there everything was suddenly turning up sunshine and daisies. Which should have been the first warning sign that something was coming, because that’s how life worked. It went up, down, even sideways sometimes. And everyone knew what goes up must come down, because gravity was as real as Captain America’s hero complex, and physics worked not only on physical objects but Tony’s happiness as well. Realistically, he should have learned his lesson the first twenty times he was surprised when his happiness didn't last indefinitely. Something would always happen. Good things were always followed by not so good things, and for some reason Tony only remembered this fact
“Hey Pete? Let’s let go of of him, okay? Mr. Iron Man doesn't want to be hugged right now,” Steve informed the boy.
He had spent 70 years alone under ice. He could not tolerate a single moment more, no matter how much Tony liked to avoid people and disappear into himself.
Tony gave a wet sniffle into Steve’s left peck, the super soldier honestly not caring if the man was leaving a tear stain or not.
Here’s the honest to god truth: Steve knew that adopting a child was spontaneous. He knew this was coming from way out of left field, knew that he hadn’t even thought about having children before Peter. But when he had found the small boy, curled under the bed with tear tracks streaking down soot-covered cheeks, he knew he would never be the same again.
“Mr. Tony, I know you’re awake,” Peter said, giggling as he pat at Tony’s face. The mechanic groaned, eyes fluttering open at being found out. The boy cheered and began wriggling once more, bouncing up and down from where he sat on Tony’s chest.
I hope you guys enjoy the chapter. And feel free to follow any of my media accounts, I love talking and interacting with each and every one of you!
And the pair sat there for a good amount of time, feeding the ducks until there were no more berries to offer. In fact, the idea of going back to the tower did not even cross his mind, until he glanced down to Pete, just in time to catch the boy from picking a berry out of the lake that the ducks had failed to consume, and eating it himself. It was a quick but challenging grapple of hands, Tony desperately trying to pry the berry out of the small human hands. By the time he succeeded in getting the lake-infested berry out of Peter’s hand, the both had berry juice artfully covering their hands, and there were tears streaming down Peter’s cheeks because “he was hungry and wanted a berry, too.”
Tony’s eyes were wide, and he knew the man was regretting everything he had just told Steve. But there was no going back now, and the waterworks were open, and damn it, why did they always do this to each other?
Then Clint left the tower. Tony knew it was probably because Peter was making the archer homesick, and although he was good with the kid, Clint probably wanted to be around his own kids more. Which Tony understood. And they didn’t need Clint around at the moment. Crime was low and the bad guys that did show up were outrageously manageable.
Tony gently wet Pete’s hair while he tried to contain his laughter, filling the red solo cup perched on the bathtub ledge with water. Peter instructed the genius to keep a hand at the boy’s hairline to make sure no water got in his eyes. Tony did as best he could, and considering the lack of shrieks coming from Peter, he fancied himself doing a good job.
Everything suddenly felt full of cotton balls. His mouth went dry and the noises around them in the busy park went muffled. Because Peter had just confirmed to this stranger, albeit a sweet one, that Tony was indeed the second dad. He had also just assumed Tony liked berries, but that wasn’t the fact Tony decided to focus on.
do this to me Rogers, I swear-” Tony began, yelling after the Captain, who was taking three steps at a time up to his floor. The genius followed as quick as he could, not having as long legs as the other man did.
“Your breath smells like pizza,” Cap reprimanded, taking his hands off of Tony’s shoulders with a wrinkle of his nose. Tony snorted at this, stepping back to relieve them of their close proximity to each other.
Tony tightened the embrace for a few seconds before pulling away, cheeks slightly flushed as he emerged from the comfort of Steve’s arms, “So you aren’t angry?”
“Sir,” the AI curtly responded. Another sigh could be heard from Pepper as the conversation with JARVIS ended. Tony glanced over at Peter, who was still happily chewing at his Poptart. The kid seemed to be completely unaware of the predicament happening, his world having become zeroed in on the sugary breakfast, looking at the pastry as if it was his long-time lover.
Tony rocketed out of bed with a fear-filled heart pounding against the metal casing of the Arc Reactor. Those were Peter’s screams, and although he wasn’t “Dad”, he was still shook to the core by the terror in the child’s voice.
At least this is what Tony told himself until Bruce stopped by the communal living room, hastily packed duffel bag slung over his shoulder, announcing that he “got a call from a girl and had to go to some university.” Of course, this wasn’t exactly what the scientist said, but Tony hadn’t been actually listening until he realized what the words meant.
“Tony…” Pepper muttered quietly when the silence came too close to the line of ‘blatantly awkward.’ There was something just shy of mournful in her tone, and it unsettled him.
Okay so I honestly love this chapter? Fluff gets me just as much as angst does. Don't forget to leave kudos and comments! Your feedback does wonders to my motivations and inspiration :p
And it should have been easy to solve this issue; easy to let the old fruit vendor know that she was simply mistaken. But his brain conveniently forgot how to speak English at that moment, as it always did when he needed it to do its job the most.
“Yup! But he always lets me get him back,” Peter seemed to remember this fact as he said it, because as soon as he finished his sentence, his head snapped up to look at the genius. A mischievous smile began to spread across small lips, innocent eyes glinting with something that should have warned Tony.
Tony forgot all about Cap in that moment, instead focused on horrid images of Peter going blind from the soapy water, or possibly even dying. If Rogers didn’t kill him for the ‘boner water’, it would be for Pete’s loss of eyesight.
“You’re welcome. I’ve been told my pizza breath is simply divine,” he retorted, grin spreading across his lips as they once more fell into familiar banter. The super soldier offered Tony an exasperated, yet somehow still fond smile, before returning to the duffel bag. He zipped everything up, carrying his shield on one arm and bag in the other, and the pang of anxiety hit Tony once more at the thought that Cap was leaving and he was going to be
Tony must have seen something in Cap’s blue eyes, because he looked down at Peter with a grim expression, “Hey Pete, why don’t you go play with DUM-E over there. He loves meeting new people,” the man pointed over to the robot, who chirped at his name. The boy giggled with brimming joy, running at DUM-E who was now scooting around in circles, happy to have a new playmate.
The kid was barley lucid by the time the mechanic had set him in bed. As gently as he could, he covered the boy in his blankets. He smiled as Peter gripped his Iron Man toy closer, and Tony really needed to find a plush Iron Man for him, because plastic armor couldn’t be very comfortable to sleep with.
“No it’s not. Mr. Steve says you don’t go to bed until two sometimes,” and damn it, the kid had pulled the ‘you don’t do it so why should I’ card. The worst card of them all, and Peter had thrown it out on the table in their first argument. Fucking hell, this was going to be a long week.
cute.Stark’s gaze had gone so fuzzy and awed, and Steve was sure his heart had melted into a useless puddle.
“I’m fine with it,” Bruce agreed,still not looking away from Tony, “I think Peter would be happy here. What about
Conversation halted immediately around the table as she whipped the phone out, pressing the green call button and answering with a stern, “Agent Romanoff.”
So of course, Peter was dressed with a shirt of the Captain’s shield, Nike shorts that had the “Just Do It” swish artistically placed to be Iron Man’s smoke trail, and gym shoes with all the Avengers on them, lighting up with every step the walking advertisement took.
And Tony told stories about James Buck. He had heard enough tales from Cap about the man before the Civil War in order to do the storytelling justice. Half way through the story, getting to the part where James was saved by Captain America from the horrible Nazis, he was abruptly interrupted by a snore. Tony stopped in mid-sentence to look down at the child, who was fast asleep, small hands curled around the plastic armored toy.
“Mr. Tony? Are you sad?” Peter asked, concern heavy in his tone. The boy began to sit up on his bed, sensing something was wrong. Tony reached out and patted Peter’s legs, assuring him that he need not worry.
Steve’s blues seemed full of conflict and regret as he leaned in to Pete, brushing his brown hair aside and planting a rushed kiss against the kid’s forehead, “I know, I’m sorry, but I have to go, sweetie. I’ll eat as much pizza as you want when I get back.”
“Mr. Steve always tells me stories about James Buck,” Peter said, and it was obvious he liked these stories, because saying the name of the beloved story character made his wide eyes light up. And Tony wanted nothing more in the world than to tell Peter about ‘James Buck’. But he had no idea who this was.
Tony took the sock and gently placed it back on Pete’s foot, chin lightly resting against the top of the boy’s fluffy head as he reached around the child in his lap, “Uh. Yeah, he taught me how to be angry. Howard taught me a lot of things. Best to save that story for another day.”
“JARVIS, coffee please. The usual,” Tony requested, pulling the sandwich bread out of the fridge as he did so.
re-lived those days whenever an episode was triggered. There was no fighting it off. His PTSD was as hard to fight as it was to defeat a dragon. And dragons weren’t real, so it was damn near impossible.
Tony flinched as large, calloused hands gripped his shoulders. Blues bore into warm browns, Steve commanding all of his attention, “I’m not the least bit angry. Sometimes, I may get carried away with stories from the past, I won’t deny it. But now is more important than then. And Howard Stark was then. You’re now. I prefer now.”
“No. I wanna keep playing,” Peter replied, and damn it, Pete never said ‘no’ to Cap when he asked. Tony was being conned, he knew it, the child was a manipulative little bastard.
And the two made quite a pair. Tony looked as plain as he could, wearing a (borrowed) Brooklyn Dodgers baseball cap, a pair of unassuming, non-expensive jeans, a red Harvard University shirt he had picked up off the guest bedroom floor, and a pair of reflective aviators. Black tape had been placed over the Arc Reactor to hide the telling glow, a task that always left Tony feeling slightly nauseous and doused in a cold sweat.
“I did on numerous occasions, Sir. You insisted on muting the reminders with every attempt I made,” Tony grumbled at this, JARVIS continuing to talk over Tony’s unintelligent mumbles, “May I also comment that Sir’s habit of projecting fault onto my software is considered unhealthy?”
Silence followed, causing Tony to look from the bath to the boy standing behind him. Peter shrugged in answer, and that really wasn’t helpful. He could have asked the kid to put his hand under the water to test it, but what if warm to Tony was boiling to Peter, and the small hand was burned off in the process? Yes it didn’t make any logical sense, Pete’s hands could not be burned off by bath water, but Tony wasn’t about to take any chances. Crazier things had happened in the tower before.
Yay, new chapter! And not horribly crippling angst! This is the first chapter that I've written in a long time without ripping my heart in two, so that's an accomplishment.
“If you come down now, you can have some ice cream, how does that sound?” Loki said, approaching him slowly with his hands raised in defeat.
“No mood for humor then, alright,” he teases, but brings them into a slow kiss as they move together to the music, golden rings laced together.
They watched more of the show and then Loki felt a warm body snuggle up into his side. He glanced down and saw Peter, in his pajamas, sucking his thumb with his body snuggled up against Loki.
Peter made a disgruntled noise of anger and formed his lips into a frown, but allowed Loki to dry and dress him in defeat.
Steve smiled sadly, but forced out a laugh, “you have no idea.” The room fell silent for a moment, each of them considering the words spoken.
“This is extortion,” Tony said through his lips, “You're the reason I’m not getting this done, you tell Pepper that when she releases her wrath.”
“Not done yet capsicle,” he said, more loudly than necessary screwing in a nut. “Gotta wrap up this project or Peps gonna get pissed off.”
“I will take that as a yes,” Loki said, picking up the now luke-warm bottle and handing it to Peter. He sat on the couch again with Peter in his lap. He sucked happily on the bottle, his eyes trained on the television and head resting on the back of the couch.
Tony was fascinated by the little girl. Her hair was dark like his, and she smiled up at him in his arms. His own hair was laced with white patches and behind him stood what seemed to be endless acres of trees and lake. In the girl’s arms was the helmet of the suit he had seen in the other drawings. Something about her drew Tony to her, and so his fingers followed every line of the paper trying to recognize her even though he had never seen her before. When he looked up, Steve’s eyes were on the ground.
He holds Tony close, arms wrapped around each other as the dance to the music. They built a life for themselves here, and maybe there are no aliens to kill and no bad guys to catch, but they are happy. Steve brushes a few of Tony’s early grey hairs from his face and smiles.
“Hey, look at me,” Tony said, placing his hands on either sides of Steve’s face, “It doesn’t matter what happened in your past- well the future I guess, but that's not important- it matters what we have now, and I'm fairly sure you and your Tony didn’t get this.”
Half an hour passed, and with one last look at the child snuggled up to him, he felt his eyes close and he fell asleep.
“I died, didn’t I,” He says bluntly, and Steve pulls him tighter. Tony guides them to the couch and they sit, sharing salty kisses and gentle promises through the night as the music grows quiet.
“Haven't I told you I didn’t have a choice,” Loki quipped, leaning against the couch with a smug look on his face. “Besides, the child likes me, how hard could it be?”
“No, Peter doesn’t cry,” Loki said in a deflated tone, jogging over to the couch and standing on the cushions, he reached his arms up toward Peter. “Come down, and we can watch it.”
It was a (semi)  quiet day in the shop. Steve dragged a chunk of charcoal across the canvas, trying with every move to perfectly capture how Tony’s eyebrows curled when he figured out a problem, how his hands skillfully crafted pieces of machinery, and how his muscles curled under his Black Sabbath shirt.
Tall and proud the Stark Tower stands, oval and sleek. His feet glide over the pathway to the entrance with false confidence. The main office is different than the Avengers tower one; cleaner and flashier with more woman sitting at reception desks.
“You didn’t come down I had to magic you down.” He said, looking down at the toddler sitting next to him.
He carried Peter over to the sink to wipe off the banana. The paper towel made a “rip” noise, which once again made Peter laugh.
It had been a year since Steve had come back to Tony. They easily slipped into a pattern of friendship, and rarely went without each other. Steve would sip black coffee and sketch as Tony worked on the latest weapon design, both of them chatting away and laughing. Steve had never been so happy in his life, and he was deep into love. He wanted more, but if that never happened he would come to terms with it because Tony was alive and with him and that’s all that mattered to him.
“So,” Tony said, gesturing for them to sit on the couch. “Indulge me, what was, or will I be, like in the future?” he took another sip.
Tony was pouring champagne into two glasses. “Hope you don't mind, I thought we could have a pre-dinner drink?”
“Steve hey,” he finally said when they pulled away. Tony hesitated for a long moment before the realization hit him. He pulled Steve into a hug as hard as he could and stroked his hair as he shook. He pulled away and looked directly into the ocean of red-rimmed blue in front of him.
“Well you know I was thinking somewhere a little fancier that old sweatpants and a S.H.I.E.L.D shirt.”
“I Loki, son of Odin command you to come down here this instant!” He stomped his foot on the ground.
Steve looks up from his book and sees Tony, dressed in a fancy suit and dark black hair gelled back with a fresh shave.
But Steve cut him off again and sobbed into a kiss, not wanting to let go, not wanting to explain. All his emotions from before came crashing through him all at once and the tears streamed down his face. His lungs were screaming for air as he sobbed through it, but Tony kissed back a little harder.
Tony considered this, and though he was still terrified he really wanted a night with Steve. “Fine, but he can be quite the handful.” Tony pulled on his suit jacket and walked over to Peter, who was in his high chair.
“JARVIS, what’s the temp of the core in here?” Steve nearly melts. It’s Tony’s voice, young and smooth as ever. He squeezes his eyes tight to try and clear his head.
Tony nodded and closed the sketchbook, “it’s probably best for both of us if I don’t know who she is.”
Steve Rogers was not the same man he was in 1930. He has seen tragedies he thought he would never survive to see and fought in battles with gods. Sure, a part of his heart would always remain in Brookline with Bucky and his coy, boyish grin, but his heart belonged to someone else now. Nausea still swarmed in his stomach as he proved to Bucky he had not forgotten their life together, how much he had meant to him.
Steve explains as much as he can. He explains the Ice and who finds his body ten years from now, and how he is from the future. He explains the time traveling, but avoids everything about the Avengers, they have to figure that out together. He gives personal details about Howard to prove himself and it works, but Tony seems extremely flustered.
“Well, looks like Petie can tire out even the god of Mischief himself,” Tony said, strutting into the living room holding in a laugh.
“What in Odin’s name-” he looked up to see Peter, dangling from his feet, walking upside down across the ceiling.
Steve Rogers stood tall, grass riding up past his ankles. His face presented stoicism, but he was far from prepared for the choice he had made. He was tired, god he was tired. He knew what he wanted to do, but he couldn’t leave Bucky here. How was it fair to leave his best friend in a time he doesn’t belong in knowing what damages it had done to himself so long ago.
“Stay here,” he commanded, placing Peter on the changing table and traveling to the dresser to grab a shirt that happens to have Iron man’s face on it.
Sam pauses and looks at the ring, “You want to tell me about her?” he asks, corner of his lip turning.
“Ugh,” Loki said, just barely managing to not drop him on the floor. “You dare use the god of mischief as a napkin!” Peter giggled ferociously in Loki’s arms, which were outstretched far from his body.
Her eyes go wide, and he can tell she doesn’t believe him, but she sends him up the elevator anyway. The ride is painfully slow.
Things were relatively smooth for an hour or so, Peter occasionally laughing at the tv and Loki groaning at the terrible storylines.
Thanks for all the feedback! I decided to write another bonus chapter because you guys liked it so much! Let me know if you'd like more of these, I have a few ideas.
Dinner was nice. They had a private table in the back room, candle lit in the center and Steve couldn’t shake how romantic this all felt. They talked about normal things, but quieter and somehow more serious. Tony was clearly tipsy by the end of the meal, but not enough so he didn’t know what he was doing, in fact, it seemed to make him more confident.
Tony gave him a disbelieving smile and snatched it from his hands. Against Steve’s persistent request, Tony flipped through the pages and saw countless sketches of himself. In clothes, he didn’t recognize, with people he didn’t know, and a little girl and teenage boy frequently placed at his side. Tony’s smile dropped.
They collapse into an embrace, but it’s not one of sadness. It’s one of acceptance and long sated love, and Steve pulls away with tears in his eyes. He doesn’t take his eyes off of Bucky until he’s on the platform.
He combed his hair at least three times and took far too long to pick the suit he was wearing. It was his favorite suit, it showed off his broad shoulders, so he glanced nervously in the mirror one last time and stepped out of the bathroom.
Minutes, hours, Steve didn’t know how much time passed, but Tony was out of breath and smiling, and the song switched.
Loki carried Peter over to the bathtub and magicked water to fill the tub. Peter gasped in surprise.
Steve didn’t hesitate, just kissed him harder and held him closer and closer. His mind spun and his heart clenched and he thought he was going to drown in the kiss-
“How can I,” he smiles, long brown hair shining in the sunlight cast through the trees, “you're taking all the stupid with you.”
“You are a very humorous child,” Loki says, not so gently rubbing the banana off of Peter’s face. “I suppose you need your shirt to be changed now,” he sighed and carried Peter to the nursery.
“My brother has changed his ways, Stark, he is not a threat to the spider child,” Thor said, clapping him on the shoulder and pulling on his coat to walk out the door.
“I love you, Pete, be nice to Loki okay?” Tony kissed his head, followed by Steve. Peter made a bubbling sound and grinned while he stuffed a mashed banana into his mouth.
Steve gazes out over the lake water, tired legs resting on the bench. He observes the shine of the orange sunlight and waits for the inevitable. He is at absolute peace.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist and the walked out the door together with a few final glances to their son.
“I’m sorry I am not so easily persuaded to let the man who tried to destroy New York babysit my son!” Tony said.
Steve played with the glass in his hand, “you were the most selfless, bravest, smartest man I ever knew.” he said, swallowing in his dry throat.
“Peter, he is not here either, they will be back soon. Let’s just watch the show alright?” He walked over and picked Peter up, gently pulling the shirt from his hands. He decided this was a good time to change Peter’s shirt, so he brought him to the nursery and, learning from last time, held him as he got the shirt and pulled it over his head.
“What are you doing, child, was I wrong to assume you wanted a bottle?” He crossed his arms and raised his eyebrow.
“Steve, Steve,” Tony said a little panicked, pulling away slightly. He ran a hand over Steve’s cheek and it came back wet. “Steve what’s wrong, I’m sorry I shouldn’t have assumed-”
Sometimes he could swear Tony saw it in him, with the way he smirked and tilted his head when he caught Steve staring. His brown eyes would twinkle and he would run a hand through his hair. Steve fell a little more in love every time.
When they were both lying in bed, kissing lazily as they fell asleep, Steve finally made a confession through parted lips, “I love you.”
He paused to throw on a large shirt from one of the wooden drawers. He had no clue as to who’s shirt it was; the guest room was a bed for the people that were too tired to make it up to their respective floors. Clothes were left behind all the time, and the next user of the guest room was allowed to borrow said clothes if need be. This rule had been implicitly made after Tony had a romp in the guest room, he and his partner having been too hot and bothered to make it up to his own floor. That morning, he had walked out into the living room with no clothes on, to the horror of the team enjoying their morning. From then on, the dressers were full of mismatched clothing items for all sizes, not-so-subtly urging Tony to leave his birthday suit for the bedroom.
For a split second, Tony considered dissuading the young child about seeing the ‘berry lady.’ Work still hung over his head like an unwanted, depressive shadow, and going to the berry lady meant walking and taking longer at the park than he had planned. But then, Peter looked so set on seeing the berry lady, and who was he to stop a little man and his dreams?
Also also, I swear this is the last bit of angst. Like really swear. I had to get Tony through some things before I could get the characters to where I want them to be, so angst we must endure. After this though? It'll become much fluffier (hopefully). Thank you all for staying with this even though Tony can be a sad bean sometimes.
Steve felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. Had Peter just watched them scream? Oh, he had been such an idiot, bringing the boy and then proceeding to forget the child was in their presence, instead focusing on yelling and cursing.
The Captain walked over to him, gently placing large hands on the shorter man’s shoulders, “Tony. I know you can do this. Okay? You’re stronger than you think.”
“That strapping young blond would be Steve. He’s out for a little, so I’ve been put on kid duty,” he offered his hand, “I’m Tony.”
Cap was known to be a creature of habit. The super soldier loved his routines, loved having a schedule that he could rely on. He took pride in the places he considered his, from his room in the Tower, to the room he had commandeered as an art studio, to the alleyways he had been beaten up in back when he had been a scrawny kid in Brooklyn. So Tony felt somewhat safe in assuming that Central Park was the right park. Peter hadn’t piped up about the walk taking too long, so he could only hope he was doing the right thing.
Sooner than later, the media stopped covering Cap’s morning run. Whether the news reporters were getting too tired at waking up at such an ungodly hour, or they were bored by the Captain’s lack of reaction, Tony could only guess. But Rogers was left alone every morning to his run in Central Park, something he swore relaxed him and started his day off with a smile. Which Tony thought was absolute bullshit because who in their right mind enjoyed running? But then again, Tony’s lung capacity was not the greatest, so maybe he was a little biased.
So first of all, I am super sorry for the huge hiatus there. Basically, school happened, and for me, it's really hard to juggle being a science major in college with my joy for writing. So naturally, I fell off of the face of the earth without a word.
Steve raised an eyebrow at this, crossing his arms as he always did when Tony told lies, “Well something is, because ever since Peter came to the tower, you’ve ceased to exist.”
“Berry lady! Berry lady!” Peter cheered as they moved towards the vendor as fast as Tony would let them. The woman turned her head at the sound of her name (was her name really ‘Berry Lady’? Surely not), and a large smile that crinkled her sweet, wrinkly face appeared on her face as her gaze landed on Peter.
As always, reviews, comments, and kudos are my bread and butter! I love hearing what you all have to say, whether it be constructive criticism or gushing about all the things you liked about it!
Peter nodded, obviously seeing the subject as resolved and over with, “Did you want to feed the ducks?”
The genius tensed, but he hugged back anyway, allowing slightly shaking hands to hold the overjoyed child. A smile spread across Tony’s face as Pete giggled, and the man looked up at the super soldier above them, smile reaching his brown eyes for the first time in a while.
Steve had expected that the genius would have relaxed after the kid relinquished his grip on his legs. Maybe it was physical contact? Peter did tend to spring up on people, enjoying the act of giving out surprise hugs. But Tony had never been one for jump scares, and maybe the physical contact made the experience uncomfortable for him. And yet, when Peter pulled away, instead to be distracted with the shiny and interesting workshop, Tony still stood stalk still, pale and tense.
“I shouldn’t have said the things I said,” he continued, “It was wrong of me. You are right to be upset, I completely lost my temper… Gosh, Tony, why didn’t you tell me sooner?”
However, this blissful ignorance was short lived, because the small vibrating body next to Steve was too excited to keep quiet once he saw Tony.
The biodegradable basket was offered to him, little hands barely able to encapsulate the whole thing. Tony wordlessly accepted it, throwing it into the lake, completely lost in attempting to stave off an odd sort of panic attack. It wasn’t a feeling he’d ever experienced before. It was something of a panic, sure, but it was filled with emotions that he couldn’t discern. And he usually ignored his emotions, but this lodge of something foreign-feeling would not let it’s presence go unnoticed.
When Clint had been assigned the duty of buying Peter clothes, they had assigned Natasha to go along with him, in hopes that her presence would mellow Clint enough so as to not pull his usual shit. However, when they had returned with twin smirks on their lips and many shopping bags in their hands, the team realized they had made a mistake.
“Cut them off, please!” Peter called back from the living room floor, voice floating from the space obstructed by the sofa. Tony grinned to himself, taking some odd happiness in having to perform the same duty Jarvis had executed all those years ago.
The second warning sign had occurred a couple of days after the Captain’s hug, when Doombots were once again sighted terrorizing the unfortunate city of New York. The team went into panic, all looking down at the child in their possession, none of them quite sure what to do.
Regardless, whatever reason that convinced him to take the boy home, it had happened. To Steve’s pleasure, the teammates adored Peter. Bruce enjoyed playing with Peter and the boy’s Avengers figurines, allowing the boy to defeat him every time. Natasha allowed her motherly “Auntie Nat” persona to shine through, something Steve hadn’t known existed until their stay at Barton’s home. And Clint treated Pete as he would any of his kids, sneaking blueberry waffles across the table despite the Captain’s insistence that Pete had already had more than enough.
Silence followed his unfiltered comment, and if he listened closely enough, he swore he could hear her sigh, which she had probably tried to cover with the palm of her hand to the receiver.
“Well, you're not the strapping tall blonde I was expecting, now are you?” the woman said with a humor-filled smirk, and of course Cap would be flirting with old fruit venders in Central Park and making them lust after him. Classic.
Removing the twist-tie from the sandwich bag, he pulled out a single slice of bread. It reminded him of when he was a child, watching Jarvis do the same with a small Tony insisting that all crusts be cut off in the background. Jarvis had done what the young Stark had requested without question, and those mornings were some of the few moments in his childhood where he had felt listened to.
“What’s a Howard?” Peter asked, voice hushed as if he were too afraid to give the man a reason to get angry. It was a scared tone, an anxious one; the same tone that Tony had used with Edwin Jarvis, asking questions about why Dad had been mad while the butler was bandaging him up.
Bath time occurred early that evening because of this, beginning with an exhausting chase after the elusive five year old monster who ‘didn’t need a bath’ and ‘liked the pb and j on his face just fine.’ And even though it turned out to be quite a struggle to get the peanut butter out of the child’s hair, Tony was ready this time for the ornery splashes of bath water Peter sent his way.
Tony followed behind him, grinning like a stupid idiot. This was, dare he say, slightly enjoyable? Cap was right, he had this in the bag.
“And these things he hides? Are they somehow connected to small children?” Clint asked, and Natasha’s eyes suddenly widened, jaw clenching with a tension unrivaled.
Smiling to himself, Tony slowly rose off the bed, ducking his head as he stood so as to not collide with the flying Iron Man making laps around the room. He left the door open behind him, just in case Pete yelled for him during the night.
Oh god, he wasn’t going to be able to get down to the workshop today, was he? Pepper was going to murder him.
“Well, when I wear the suit, I’m Iron Man. But my real name is Tony?” and it ended like a question because what if the only reason Peter tolerated him was because he thought he was only Iron Man? Maybe Tony should have just said that he was Iron Man and had no idea why Cap called him that. Had he just screwed this up?
Peter didn’t speak for a second after that, a thoughtful look on his face as he surveyed the living room. It was almost comical, those tiny eyebrows slightly furrowed with a barely-there frown. Such a Steve expression.
Tony sighed, “It’s as if you assume I haven’t already thought about calling him. Which is out of the question because I am
“He’d be sad because he… He wouldn’t have anyone to protect at night, and that’s the only thing he’s wanted for, so he’d be sad,” and ‘
,” Tony glared at the hidden cameras he knew were placed in the room, seeing as how he had done the placing, “Are you spying on us, Ms. Potts?”
Peter’s splashing continued as Tony was left to his inner frantic thinking, the splash radius growing with each pat, until the bath water was soon flying over the edge. He was about to tell him to stop it, that bath water was meant to stay in the bathtub, when Peter stopped abruptly with a screech.
Tony was almost out the door, having turned on the night light and made sure that the Iron Man flying around was fully functional, when a groan of protest came from the bed. He looked over to find wide eyes looking back at him, peeking out from under the covers.
In a stroke of genius, Tony victoriously grabbed a paper towel, walking over to where Peter sat. He took the towel and dabbed at the toast, Peter’s brown eyes widening in absolute horror as the man did so, “Mr. Tony! What are you doing?!”
Once breakfast had been successfully achieved, the next step of the day was the park. A step that, at first, Tony thought could be put off until later in the afternoon so he could start working on the smartphone prototype. However, he was soon proven that, no, the trip to the park had to happen right then because apparently, Pete and Poptarts did not mix well.
Truthfully, Tony hadn’t been to many parks in the area over his time living in the tower. He never really had a reason to. Back when they were still together, if Pepper wanted to take a walk, they’d usually fly to somewhere scenic and breathtaking. Parks always had screaming and crying humans, and Tony didn’t find relaxation from the symphony of squealing children. He always did his exercise in the Tower’s gym, or when he began to feel too antsy, would take a suit out for a spin. So there really had never been a need to go to a park
Also, fair warning, there is some mentions of abuse in this chapter? I mean there already has been some mentions but this is more straightforward than it was in previous chapters.
Steve appreciated all that Tony Stark was doing, of course. The ‘helping parent from afar’ approach seemed to be the one the man was taking, helping in anyway he could without actually interacting. He didn’t know why the man was practicing such strained distance, and it bugged him to no end that the man couldn't just express his feelings. Couldn’t just tell Steve why he had a problem with Peter.
“Tony. We need to talk,” Steve said, trying to make eye contact with the brown eyed man, who looked down at his shoes, observing something that was not there in false interest. All he got in response was a hum, and there he went again, chewing at his bottom lip until it was red.
“How could a small child be worse than Afghanistan?” Steve questioned, eyes flickering from Natasha to Clint to Bruce, who were now all looking at each other with meaningful glances. It was like some telepathic conversation they were all holding, and he hated it, hated feeling that he was out of the loop. Especially when it was about Tony.
There were so many parks in Midtown Manhattan. Chelsea Park, Bryant Park, Robert Moses Playground, St. Vartan Park, Madison Square Park, Bellevue South Park and then that one park by Hell’s Kitchen. The reviews were unreliable and all over the place due to white soccer moms and what their idea of a “good” park was, and Tony was panicking. Because obviously Peter had a specific park in mind and the kid seemed so excited to go and scream along with the other small children. But Cap hadn’t left a Post-It note with his signature smiley face in the right corner telling Tony what to do. It almost felt as though he had been set up, doomed to disappoint the child.
dads, and Tony Stark’s weak heart felt ready to implode because damn it, he had not prepared for this sort of thing in a simple stroll through the park. But of course, nothing was ever simple in their life.
There was a gasp from Pepper’s end, the noisy scrambling ceasing in the background as she locked on to what Tony had implied, “Steve?
, not a machine, and Tony was really starting to feel the need to scream because the universe just really fucking hated him sometimes didn’t it-
This was always the worst part during the impending catastrophe, when the doom was setting in and he
Steve’s breath suddenly caught in his throat, watching brown eyes glisten with happiness, gold and dark reds highlighted by his wide smile. Warm, welcoming, beautiful; not quite Peggy’s shade, something particular and familiar.
“Mommy a-and Daddy… They were… The plane… And eyepatch man told Aunt they were dead… and I-” Peter was having a hard time getting out just exactly what he wanted to say, but Tony could piece together enough to know that the child had been reliving the death of his parents.
“DUM-E escorted young Sir into the hall upon my orders. I thought it might be the best course of action,” JARVIS explained, as if he had read Steve’s mind, hearing the stream of concern.
I hope you guys enjoyed! I especially loved writing Pepper, because of course, who doesn't love their friendship????
They both sat in silence, watching until the bath was ready before pulling off Pete’s Hulk themed underwear. He squealed when Tony dipped him in the bath, writhing in his arms with enough gusto to make the genius weary of an accidental punch to the nose.
Cap had never seen Tony Stark flinch as hard as he did then, jumping in the metal stool he was sitting in, sliding off of it by accident. Peter ran at Tony, who looked frightened for his life, the small human barreling towards him with a speed unmatched.
he tried to tell himself, cringing inwardly at his words. However, Peter did not pay attention to that part of Tony’s message, focusing instead on the fact that he was letting his favorite superhero down.
Cap thanked the ceiling as Peter ran up to them, jumping up and down with excitement, “We played chase! I won!” DUM-E chirped happily, raising it’s one metal arm up and waving it about, as if celebrating. Tony chuckled, and to Steve’s surprise, crouched down to Peter’s level. He held out his arms slightly, tentatively, as if not sure asking for a hug was necessarily what he wanted.. The small boy immediately backed up, glancing frantically at Cap.
He tried to last for as long as he possibly could along the walk that Peter was giving him. And Tony was proud to say that he had made it pretty far before considering turning around, probable upset child in tow as consequence. The Loeb Boathouse was in sight, and the ducks on the lake were quaking, and really, he had done good to warrant a turn-around. But just when he was about to break the bad news to the brown-haired boy, Peter suddenly began to tow Tony along with a new vigor. And just like that, they were suddenly on a bee-line path straight towards an old lady with a fruit stand, her back to the lake behind her.
“Howard was my dad,” was the only thing that could come out of his mouth. Really, it was the only thing Tony could say that wouldn’t earn him a disappointed frown from the Captain, if the man was there. But then again, if Cap were there, Tony wouldn’t be talking to the five year old or getting ready to take him to the park.
Tony had then left his hiding spot, walking away and down the hall, stupid grin stretching across his lips as yelps of excitement faded away. And although Peter had been tired and grumpy the next day, having stayed up too late in his uncontrollable joy the night before, Tony Stark regretted nothing.
The too-hot bath water went down the drain, Tony trying yet again once all remains of the offending water had disappeared. This time, he let the bath fill with a much colder water, and it actually made a little bit of sense that Rogers would draw cold water for baths. Ever since the ice, he had always been a slight bit more sensitive to hot temperatures. Of course, that never stopped Cap from going on his morning runs in 90 degree weather. But with small things, such as preparing a bath for a child, he would adjust things to his own sense of temperature without even thinking.
“Did Howard also teach you how to be an asshole? Because I doubt it. You keep yourself so high up that pedestal, and you can’t face a child that wants a hug?”
Everything stopped at that moment. Everything froze. Steve felt like he was under the ice again, cold and shocked and useless. Useless as tears slid down oil-streaked cheeks. Useless as he realized that his friend had been a horrible, horrible father. Useless.
The pair stumbled when the boy launched himself at Tony’s legs, clinging to them in a hug with a wide smile plastered on his face. Pete’s cheeks were rosy red in excitement, and for a moment, Steve allowed himself to enjoy the child’s happiness. However, he quickly reminded himself why they were there in the first place, and changed his focus to Tony.
Tony gazed up at the ceiling, not sure whether he was asking JARVIS (or maybe a Norse god?) to spite him for messing up something as simple as buttered fucking toast. He did not have enough coffee in his system to deal with his own incompetence this early in the morning.
“Daddy is my favorite dad,” Peter declared into the room, causing Tony to pause wiggling the other tiny velcro light-up Avengers shoe onto the boy’s foot, “I love him very much.”
“Who?” he asked, wanting to get any details he could out of Peter in order to pull some quick story out of his ass about this character.
“You mean Betty?” the abrupt excitement in Pepper’s voice was obvious, no matter how hard she attempted to conceal it. Apparently, ‘Betty’ and Bruce was something to get excited about. And damn her because somehow, she always knew the latest scoop about every Avenger, as if they all went to her as their resident superhero therapist.
, and although he knew Cap would have done it much quicker, for a first time, he didn’t think he had done all that bad.
“Pete, we uh, we can’t stay up till’ midnight, okay? That’s way past bedtime,” Tony attempted. Peter looked up from his toys, brown eyes falling on the man with innocent curiosity.
His brain was swimming with work, figuring out his plans for the day, until a child’s disturbingly accurate sounds of play gunfire interrupted his train of thought. He realized exactly then what the full extent of Peter’s existence in his every waking moment truly meant.
“Maybe call one of your teammates?” Pepper suggested, “I’m sure Bruce would understand. And he’s got a soft spot for kids.”
Things seem to be getting better for Tony. That is, until the universe decides that this just won't do.
Tony had been keeping this all in, all to himself. Every cell in his enhanced body told him to hug Tony, to comfort the man who was drying his tears a few feet away. He could easily push him off, sure, and Cap would feel the slight sting of rejection. But taking the risk to comfort his teammate, dare he say friend, far outweighed the danger of Tony’s possible reaction.
Peter rushed back to his toys as the Poptarts were placed in the toaster. The beep the toaster made sounded annoyed, as if it didn’t know why it had to cook something else when the bread had been toasted perfectly.
“Uh. Pete, buddy. Why’d you tell old Gladus over there that I’m your… Dad?” Tony asked the boy, trying to catch his gaze. But Peter continued on, throwing berry after berry into the lake with some sort of rhythm that he had in his head. Tony almost believed Peter was too deep in duck-feeding to have heard him, and was about to repeat the words, when Peter paused his berry throwing to shrug. His shoulders rose to dramatic heights and stayed at his ears for a considerable amount of time, as if he had just started to learn how to shrug from observing others, and hadn’t quite mastered the subject.
“I’m sorry buddy, I’m sorry, too close to lava? I’m sorry, let’s try again,” Tony profusely apologized, feeling a slight bit of pride in his response. Howard would have screamed at Peter, telling him that he just had to deal with the scalding hot water. He would never let anyone treat Pete like that, ever.
I’m only taking care of him because Cap is out on a mission, and for some reason, he trusts me with the kid!
Once they crossed the street, Tony began to lead Peter to one of the nearest playgrounds, Heckscher Playground, at the entrance of Central Park. Because of course, he had assumed Peter would want to play with all the other young, chaotic children on the playground. Tony did not expect the noise of discontent that came from Peter.
He sighed as he crawled under the sheets. Maybe no one had been there for any of that with him. But he had had someone to read bedtime stories to him. Someone who made sure young Tony ate his vegetables, who had administered band-aids with a loving hand.
As soon as Tony caught his breath, even though his hands still slightly shook, his face broke into a grin, “Oh, you’re gonna get it!”
He, however, did not have the stamina of a super-soldier or a child; a fact of which he was painfully reminded of as the hunt for the berry lady began.
“I have time,” Tony replied, avoiding Pepper’s question because he in fact did not have a single sketch done, “I’ll be able to whip it all up before the meeting in a couple of weeks-”
A father, in charge of the happiness and well-being of a child. A dad, who was in a happy relationship with a nice looking, dorito of a man. And fuck, if this wasn’t sending Tony into a spiral because truthfully, he never imagined himself ever being called “dad” by anyone. He had never had that talk with anyone he’d ever been with; Pepper and him didn’t get their relationship stable enough to ever reach that point. And Tony had never really felt the urge to have a child, or be looked up to in that sort of way.
And then there had been Peter, giggling as if his birthday had come early, his first present being a hug from “Mr. Iron Man.” Tony hadn’t been able to stop the smile from forming on his face, despite his weak heart nervously palpitating underneath small hands. Eventually, he pulled away from the hug, smile weak as the child looked at him in wonder. It was a small victory of course, something so trivial to be happy about, and yet Tony hadn’t been able to stop the swell of joy that had filled his chest. Tony Stark had just hugged a child and hadn’t hurt them. There could be some physical contact that didn’t involve pain; Tony could make a small human happy. He could pretend all he wanted, could tell himself that it was weak to be so happy about something so small, but Peter liked Tony and damn it if he wasn’t over the moon with it all.
Peter dropped his figurines at that, looking genuinely concerned for the Iron Man flying around his room, “Why would Iron Man be sad?”
subscribe. I don’t need porn when I have superheros working out in my gym,” Tony pointed out, thinking of one superhero in particular. And he really shouldn’t have said that, because Pepper Potts was not dumb. He had been caught by his CEO giving Cap’s retreating form the ‘I’m not looking but I totally am’ on numerous occasions. And no matter how many times he had tried to deny her accusations of glancing at that American ass, she was sure on what she had seen; Pepper knew what Tony Stark looked like when he was checking people out.
“Okay Peter, let’s try this again. Boner killer water might be up your alley,” Tony announced, helping him back into the bath once more. This time, the boy didn’t squirm or shout in discomfort, so he knew he must have done something right.
“James Buck. Captain America’s very best friend,” and oh, Tony’s heart dropped to his stomach. Bucky. Of course, there was no one better to tell bedtime stories about than Bucky Barnes.
“Tony, have you considered finding a babysitter?” Pepper asked through the speakers in the kitchen, “I’m sure someone will be available to watch over Peter while you work.”
“It’s a mission. Clint’s not here, so Fury’s calling you in with me, Steve,” Natasha announced as she got out of her chair quickly, leaving her food behind as she rushed off to her room, presumably to get her suit and gadgets. Captain Rogers cursed under his breath as he rocketed out of his chair, eyes landing on Peter and then Tony, both looking up at him with fear in their eyes, both for different reasons.
Tony shot out of his seat at the dining room and chased after the man, ignoring Peter’s cries of protest at being left alone.
"Tony?" a nurse asked, opening the door out to them. "He wants you." The engineer looked back at Harley.
"I thought you were coming alone," he said, even though he was starting to see black dots, leaning heavily against the tree now. Steve stepped up to him, leaning down to press a kiss to his lips. He gently caressed the side of his face, looking back at him. And Tony just looked back even as his vision started to fade.
"He needs you. Go. I'll be fine." He pressed a kiss to the boy's temple before following the nurse inside and over to Peter, standing near the boy's head. Peter opened his eyes to look up at his father.
"Tony," Natasha spoke up, walking into the hallway with the others. "Harley called." He looked up at that as she put the phone on speaker, telling the boy that the engineer could hear him.
I am doing a sort of cleanse. And I need to work on my actual book more. For a month, I will not do anything related to fanfiction stuff. It'll probably help with school starting soon too. Sorry this wasn't an actual update. So, I'll see you in September.
"Do you wanna talk about it?" Tony asked, causing Harley to let out a quiet breath, curling more into his father's chest.
"Why did you bring me here?" The soldier looked back at him intently for a moment, seeming to study his whole face, his smile warming a bit as he looked at the man he loved. Tony wasn't sure about all of this. Steve had kind of kidnapped him and taken him hostage probably until he agreed fully with what they were doing and there was no chance of him leaving.
The engineer sat in the car for a moment before opening the door and stepping out. He closed the door behind him and walked over to the big oak tree in the middle of the park. And that's where he waited for about five minutes, thinking about how he had gotten himself there. And that's when a pair of footsteps approached him. He looked up to meet Steve's gaze.
"What are they doing here?" Tony sighed, hoping they had stayed in the jet. It was going  to be a very difficult story to tell before Peter probably even talked to any of them. Or stopped glaring at them for taking his father.
He had a week. He would figure it out later. For now, he was going to spend time with Harley and Peter.
"Peter got hurt on patrol. Someone anonymous texted him a location and a picture of some people who were hurt, so he went, but I didn't let him go alone. We got all the people out, but the person was waiting for us. He shot Peter after shooting him with something in a dart. I think his powers aren't working. He'd gonna die, isn't he?"  Tony looked back at Steve. The man sighed.
"I'm not sure yet." He really didn't know if they were just going to leave him there until he complied or if they wanted to do something else. He hated that they had taken him away from the two boys. He needed to be there for them in case something happened. What if Peter called him in the middle of his patrol and was bleeding to death or something? He could die.
The super soldier walked into the cell and sat down in the chair that was sitting beside the nightstand that was beside the bed. They were both silent and Tony was sure the man was staring at him, but he was just looking back at the wall, rejecting even the thought to look at him.
Slowly, the man walked over to the desk and looked at the package. Not much mail actually came to him. When it first was sent to him, he had someone that went through it. Then, it was sent to the secretary. Then, he got whatever she deemed was okay. Which led to this.
He was angry at Steve for taking him there. He'd been up for a talk with him alone, and then going back home to the boys, going back to his normal life, but no. Steve had to drug him and take him to a Hydra base. He would never forgive him for that. He was sure of it. He would never forgive him for keeping him from his sons. He would never forgive him for any of this. Not until he could be back with his kids. Not until he would let him leave.
As they watched the movies, the others mostly left them alone, though every now and then someone would step in and watch whatever part of the movie they were on before leaving again. It bothered Tony a little bit, but he didn't say anything, just watching the people come and go. He was just going to relax for the weekend. Well, for that Sunday. But he would relax the whole day.
"Are you gonna be back for the science fair in a few weeks? Peter and Ned are looking forward to it."
With those thoughts, the phone rang. The engineer looked back at it, holding it in his hand. Should he really pick it up? Maybe Steve would reveal something about his location. It would be best for all of them. He flipped the phone open, pressed the accept button, and put the phone to his hear. He was met with deep breathing and had to close his eyes. It was definitely Steve.
Tony was surprised to find Steve, Natasha, and Bucky still awake, talking quietly in the living room. He decidedly ignored them in favor of focusing on Harley. They walked over to the couch and sat down away from the other three.
"You have one five hundred and eight new emails. There's a package on your desk. You have another meeting at three." He nodded and closed the door before she could say anything else, sighing heavily. The package on his desk stuck out, the brown packaging sticking out on the red and gold desk. Clint and Sam had decided to paint it for fun.
"Let's get into the jet," Steve said. Tony shook his head, looking down at Peter. He needed to be there as soon as possible. The jet would take twice as long.
"No. He'll fly there." Harley looked up at him like he was crazy. "Peter, I'm gonna put you in my suit and you're going to fly back to the compound, alright? Dr. Cho will be waiting for you and she'll be there right away to help you." The boy grasped his hand.
"Yeah," Tony replied. "It's probably not important, but I should take it anyway. You know Fury." They both nodded in agreement to that. The director was kind of crazy sometimes. Tony stood up and walked into the other room, answering the phone. He didn't even have to answer before the other man started talking.
For a few hours, they would just forget everything and be together. It would all work out in the end, Tony was sure, but it was nice to take a break in the middle of everything.
"Yeah, well, I thought about not coming." He'd seriously considered just staying with Peter, making sure the boy was safe and okay, but he knew he should come and talk to Steve. He was worried about him, anyway, and about all the others. He wanted to make sure they were all okay and alive. He was worried.
"Really?" she asked. "That's not good. A scientist found that out. He could sell it to others." He took a deep breath, giving her a look.
Just as Tony feared, something happened to the kids while he was gone. Will the others let him leave to help?
This was crazy. Was he really going to go to Steve? He couldn't. Yet he couldn't stop himself from checking his phone every five minutes.
Tony drove a Prius to the park where Steve wanted to meet him. It was outside of the city, near the cemetery, and no one was around. There were no cameras, either, which made Tony anxious to get out of his car.
The jet landed and Harley and Tony were the first ones out, hurrying quickly inside and upstairs to the med bay. They didn't go in, though, waiting outside as Cho worked with a few other doctors. Pepper showed up later, eyeing the former Avengers before she stepped up next to Tony, looking into the hospital room. She glanced back at the father and son to see the tears on Harley's cheeks and the worried look deeply etched into Tony's face. That's when she noticed why he looked so different.
"Really?" he asked. Tony had known he was going to have a nightmare? How pathetic was that? Knowing that the boy had issues of self-deprivation, Tony looked back at him for a minute, hoping that he'd get his point across.
When lunch rolled around, they made sandwiches, got some chips from the cabinets, and went back in to finish their marathon. They were all very happy to be with each other and were all in good moods. That is, until Fury called.
“Okay, I’m having Friday put parental locks on your Instagram account before I get you your breakup edibles.” Tony was absolutely serious about that.
Tony: Absolutely awful. The Princess kept trying to convince Friday to refer to her royal sibling as Kitty brother. By convince, I mean, trying to get into my systems, more than once.
“OK it’s clean. And no we’re not here to arrest you. The boss just wants to talk to you. Mr. Hogan was supposed to be part of the conversation but he’s not ready.” Agent Davis explained.
Cuddle Bunny: I’m not even surprised. Hydra definitely wouldn’t want you anywhere near them. Me neither, for that matter, which probably explains that ridiculous way they tried to ease me into the truth.
HSBF: Tony, what’s going on? I saw on Twitter pictures of you passed out on your plate? Friday, you tell me what’s going on?
“That would be Morgan. This is saying something because I invented clean energy and discovered a new element.” He looks over to see Steve open his mouth wide in shock. “OK, theoretically Howard discovered it, but I made it.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. Now this conversation starts out with an in person conversation but since it is mostly text messages I decided to label it as an interlude.
Anthony: I also get my own share of marriage proposals and nude pictures. Along with a lot of paternity suits, but those are extra ridiculous now that I no longer have a sperm count. Those are also filtered out. Actually they should've filtered yours out of your fan mail as well I have had my people going through the Avengers mail since the beginning.
Nomad: I’m fine. I know Friday is concerned, but I don’t need help. Did you really let Tony take your daughter to meet the president?
Boss: Considering how fucked up we left things, using Vision as an intermediary is probably the best call.
Me: Okay, the obvious answer is each other. Or maybe Benji for you. At least that’s what Friday is putting down.
“Do we just bring back the people who were snapped, or do we bring back everybody who died from other complications? Should we bring back Yo-Yo or Vision?” Steve added to their list of ethical dilemmas.
Cuddle Bunny: Even Pepper has gone on TV to defend you. She actually said things fell apart because your heart was too big to just care about one person. She’s right.
BITC: I understand. Is this related to the reports of the exploding hammer? Apparently, the Norwegian government has a leak.
Nomad: I didn't want to invade his privacy. Also, you do realize that bisexuals existed in the 1940s?
Nomad: I’m painting and sketching. I have some stuff that I’m actually sending you, but not from the sessions.
Ana Junior: They are not at this time. I was initially not planning to tell you that until the princess returns from her frappe break and her conversation with her brother. I feel that you need to vent; otherwise, you may end up punching Leo.
Tony: Besides, this way I can text message you. Texting and driving is bad. So again tell me what are you most grateful for? Although, even though this is encrypted, please don’t say you know what.
We can totally do winter school at my house at an undisclosed location. I can even arrange for extra teachers to show up. Although, if you are there, the agent who shares a name with your aunt will also be there. I think she would like to spend some quality time with her other BFF.
FRIDAY: I will not be able to find Jonathan from Freddie’s of Arlington without more information. However, the image I found of Melinda Gardner with her ex-husband at an academic conference nine years ago is a 99.2% visual match to the female SHIELD agent currently in your driveway.
Anthony: I don’t think Ross is because he is currently busy at a Congressional hearing about misuse of government funds to build the Raft.
Yes, you may use Friday for official Shield business. You’re pre-approved. Although, is it really still Shield, if you’re going to continue using the ATCU as your public front. Congratulations on Agent being in charge again. As well as Mack being the new number two. I’m sending balloons and chocolates. The good stuff.
Chief Mechanic: Actually, yes. After the Battle of New York, we wrote a bunch of contingency plans. It's also why we started working on the upstate campus right away, and we never fully moved everybody into the tower like initially planned. I felt like we would be less likely to deal with another alien invasion at the new campus. The board was furious at the time. Not so much now that we're making a lot of money leasing the tower to the federal government for the ATCU.
The new consultant: No, because honestly, I was planning to do this sometime next week if they kept tiptoeing around each other, especially because the placebo is now gone for good. It was going to be Flash’s late birthday present.
Melinda: There was an explosion at a power plant in Pasadena because Eli Morrow decided to create his own transformation chamber to give himself powers. He did, but his transformation resulted in an explosion that made Phil, a member of our team, and an asset helping us named Robbie disappear.
