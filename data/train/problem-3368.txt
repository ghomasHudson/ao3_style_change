Sam's suspicions had begun a couple months ago, when he'd tried to inform Dean about a recent phone-call with Bobby. A new case, and it sounded pretty urgent.
The profound knowledge that someone loves you, and wants you to stay, that you feel the same.
To Cas.
"I've been, remembering, a lot. These past few days." Dean gnawed at his lip, and Cas waited. "With Raphael and heaven and Naomi, those friggin Leviathan, Crowley, just—" he took a breath, still focusing on the darkened road. "Everything, I guess."
"You never stop to think things through, do you," Dean spits out. "Never have, never will, I guess."
times," his voice broke, and they pulled at last into the motel's parking lot. The rumbling purr of the engine died as Dean yanked out the keys.
In the morning, things would be different. Strained. But for now, Dean could at least offer comfort.
"But good?"
things.
"…about the
As it turns out, that
angel, like himself, was not exactly romantic material. Besides, Dean seemed to have a preference for females explicitly.
Dean massaged his chin, wincing. "Man, you really wouldn't make a gentle nurse."
The room is quiet after Sam leaves, and Dean realizes suddenly that he hasn't eaten breakfast yet. "Well?" He rubs his hands together and gestures towards the kitchen. "What'll it be today, angel? Blueberries or chocolate chips?"
"Over a hundred songs, yes," Cas nods, looking awfully smug. "I memorized them all years ago. I suppose I was trying to- well—" he hesitates.
He scanned the menu further, then flipped to the back.
is what humans call a 'pinky promise,' Cas. It's like that weird saying '
Cas gestured questioningly at a solid red ball near the right corner pocket. A straight shot.
“So… they had a child together?”
He’s never had to give comfort in this way. Never allowed himself the luxury of touching Dean, not like this.
Sooner or later, Dean would be alone. Isn't that what he deserved, after all?
When their lips meet, it’s everything and not enough. It’s everything because it’s
Sam groaned inwardly, rolling his eyes into the back of his head and flipping his laptop shut.
And Dean listens, and smiles. Because they’ve all changed. But some things still remain the same.
Dean squeezes their fingers together, shifting closer to the angel's huddled form, and Cas barely holds back a sob as Dean continues speaking.
, I—" the words stuck inside his throat, and Dean coughed out a weak laugh.
"Dean—"
Dean takes a deep breath, then immediately closes his eyes in concentration, praying as hard as he can.
And although he knew Dean could never truly be content settling down with a wife and kids, living the 'apple pie life,' as he called it, Sam wished that his older brother could find someone, a hunter, who understood the life, someone he could be happy with.
Dean smiles, gently prying the popcorn bowl from Cas’s hands and dipping over the side of the bed to place it on the floor. It’s a good thing
That was why Dean had kept the coat, after Cas had wandered into that lake. Even though it stank of swamp-water, and leviathan goo and blood. Even though he had to keep moving it around with each new car they 'borrowed.' It was the first thing he grabbed from the trunk, the first thing he made sure to have with him every time they changed cars. Not just because it mattered to him, but because WHEN Cas came back—as he knew he would—the dorky angel would need it, just as much as Dean needed his car.
Sam had always joked about Cas's staring contests with Dean, how the angel never did it with anyone else, how Dean actually seemed to enjoy it. No doubt about it, Dean had even initiated the stares several times, just to feel it again: the bond. Time seemed to stalemate every time they touched glances with one another, and Dean craved it, but the lingering damage inflicted by his father's judgement thrust a shock of fear and self-hatred into every moment of connection.
Dean sighs as he hears Sam and Jack laughing all the way from the ‘Dean-Cave.’
"Sam wanted to stay at the motel, and Lee and I went to see a special screening of 'Back to the Future.' First time I'd ever seen it. It was pretty awesome. I think you'd like it, actually." He glanced a look at Cas. So far, so good.
The ending that tied the entire footnote together. Who knew that three simple words could fill in all the missing pieces? Could give so much more meaning to every other word before it.
“You sure must like hearing yourself talk then,” Dean breathes.
about that night, not after what happened. But Sam had been around John Winchester long enough to know when the man was lying through his teeth. And even better, Sam knew when his
“Well then I’ll teach you! It’s not that hard,” Dean pats him on the shoulder, obviously amused by the angel’s worry.
Dean was so deeply buried in his thoughts he almost didn't realize Cas had started speaking again.
Cas feels Dean's warm arm wrap around his own quivering body. It is comfort like Cas has never felt before.
“—and Dean, man you have to do something about it, because your ‘staring contests’”— Sam makes air quotations— “are seriously scarring me for life. And that’s saying a lot, considering. And Cas, look, I know—”
Love was always supposedly that “cheesy girl thing.”
“Check the—” Cas clears his throat, and his voice becomes stronger. “Check the inside pocket.”
The clenching fist digs heavily into Dean's chest, and he can feel Castiel looking at him funny, but there's too much weight, too much—
Cas bit back a smile, amused at Dean's reddening ears, but the feeling quickly faded as the memories surfaced. Of how he had stood in that steaming shower room, inches away from Dean's bare chest. Of how nudity had never affected him before, but Dean seemed to be the only exception. Of how seeing Dean like that, it made him want to do things, want to feel things he'd never felt before. Of how Sam had trapped them in that sigil, his intentions kindly meant but hastily executed. Of how shocked, how utterly
He sighs deeply. He can't ignore the soft request. He looks over slowly, his fist still clenching the faux leather seat hard enough to hurt his fingers. Cas's eyes are kind when he meets them, soft and understanding. "Dean, it's okay."
"Uhh..." Dean wracks his brain. "I think... I have this weekend off. Why?"
he's gonna cum if Cas doesn't stop.
Cas's hand curiously runs over his bare balls, rolling them with his gentle hand. He runs a finger up over Dean's dick with a light touch, and Dean shudders, gasping. He wants so much more than this. "So desperate. So entirely responsive. It's refreshing."
"Be still. Feel this." Then there's a lot of pressure. It's moving back and forth, coaxing his muscles to loosen and let Cas in. Dean relaxes his muscles as best he can, and suddenly Cas is pushing inside. Oh, fuck! Dean groans loudly, and Cas joins him when he does.
Dr. Bradbury nods and makes yet another note, "Alright, well, I'd like to get some blood from you, run a hormone level panel, and check your reflexes. All that other fun stuff."
Dean nods and looks down at his lap. For once, he's satisfied with just the answer. "What do we do now?"
"How did you know I was awake?"
"Ahh... No. But I feel like it should feel that way, I suppose."
"Uhh," Dean looks down and finds the sign on the weather-beaten board, "20 cents apiece. They're really fresh too. We just got these off the vine this morning."
A sudden beeping brought reality crashing back down for him. That was his phone. Oh no. Zachariah. "That damn thing's been going off since last night." Dread was filling him as he realized what was going on. He had never texted Zachariah last night. "I need to text-"
Dean smiles faintly at him, "I guess. I'm sorry I'm so... weird."
"I know, honey. It'll be okay. I promise."
"I'm sorry."
Castiel nearly swallows his tongue when he sees the way Dean signed his name. As if the godfather comment wasn't enough to give him heart palpitations. Oh heavens... After waiting a few moments for his heart to calm down he writes out his reply to Dean and gives it to Gabriel to deliver immediately with the addendum that Dean isn't at his apartment when Gabriel tacks that to his door.
He wouldn't want Dean to be gone from his life even if their sexual relationship came to an end.
Castiel's immediately alert. "What do you mean?"
"Would your father actually cause you physical harm?"
He never thought he'd be saying that to his boyfriend at this age, but
"Mates." Castiel agreed, hoping they would have the discussion now. He wanted to know. "Okay. First things first, this is a monogamous relationship here. You're mine, I'm yours, either of us fucks that up, there are repercussions." Warmth filled him at the thought of Dean being his.
Cas's hand is flying over Dean's dick, squeezing and twisting in all the right places, and he doesn't stop pulling on the rope, fucking Dean back into him. "Cum, Dean!"
"Cas," Dean whispers in a broken plea, and his right hand comes back over his shoulder to grab the nape of Cas's neck, pulling him as close as he can get.
"I did. His name was Sam."
"I should hope not. I like to think of myself as rather unique."
"Yes," Dean breathes without hesitation. Cas's words made his chest feel achy and gooey, like Christmas morning. He wants nothing more than to just melt into his boyfriend's arms. So he does. They scroll through numerous options, taking almost an hour to finally get what they want. It's lovely, just laying in Cas's arms like that. They decided that it'll be a soft brown leather with deep green accents braided around it. They also chose a dark blue gem to go in the center where it'll rest against his throat since neither of them wanted an O ring on it. Dean's very happy about the idea, more than he thought he'd be actually. It'll be several weeks before they receive it, so that's plenty of time in case... Well, just in case.
ready to be fucked.
"Ah, Dean, that wouldn't have been any fun. I wanted to surprise you boys. And I wanted to meet your..." John's eyes linger over Cas, looking him up and down,  "Partner."
"Where did you go, baby boy?"
"Well... I needed information. And she gave it. After some prodding. She was in on it just as much as Barty and Big Boy were. They're all dead, and they all deserved it. They hurt you, Cas!"
"I think I should be punished for teasing you... Sir." Cas's eyes widen at the honorary and Dean's breath hitches. Fuck, this is going to be so good. His cock is straining upwards, hoping for some touch. Cas's hand preferably. Or fuck, his
Dean feels blood rushing to his head, suddenly in fight mode once again. He can’t believe he ever felt so numb just hours ago, now his entire body seems to be flaring with emotion: the anger, the fear, the relief, and yes: the
. The angel had always been known for engaging in abnormally lengthy eye-contact, particularly with Dean, but on that day, there were dozens of occasions when Cas seemed to purposefully look away from the one man he could usually never keep his eyes off of…
"I don't know. It's not really socially acceptable, to wear western outfits out in public. Not unless you're down in Texas, or you have a career as a rodeo star or something."
“Cas?”
Dean realized with a pang that he hadn't even come close to understanding the problems his best friend had been dealing with.
"What does that mean?" Cas turned his head away from the screen to ask, shifting his weight slightly. Dean almost didn't register the question, as it was suddenly very difficult to concentrate with Cas's warm knee pressing into his thigh.
Castiel would be lying if he said he wasn't at least a little bit satisfied with this information. But the feeling only lasted a moment, as he realized that once again, Dean's life had been disrupted, and once again, it had been Cas's fault entirely.
he reminds himself, despite the obvious heat settling deep into his face.
need are some lessons in how to not be so literal about everything. Also: how to have a conversation."
You guys mean so much to us.
“Dean!” He pushes for room at his brother’s side. “Oh my god, you’re okay—”
I couldn't have done this alone. I couldn't have done this without you thoughtful, supportive readers. Special thanks to Onloveslightwings2266. Nayeliq1. LovelyOtt98. WantsToFlyAfraidToFall. crowley_the_snek.
"Second of all, you're trying to be something you're not. So stop. Cas is an eloquent guy. He's going to speak his thoughts, because that's what he's used to doing. You, not so much."
The room chilled slightly, but Dean had been wondering the same thing. Cas sighed, and threw Dean's wrappers in the nearest trash can. "I should go soon. Perhaps I will be able to fit in the meeting while you two sleep. I may very well be able to visit again tomorrow morning. If that is alright."
The constant question mark, forever plaguing his thoughts. Most of the time, dean had chosen to ignore it, but this morning, blame it on curiosity or simple excitement, Dean allowed himself to consider the idea. The idea of Cas being something else entirely.
Cas blinked out the memory, and looked up to see the same Dean, the real Dean staring at him.
Cas squinted at the menu. "I'm wondering if you can help me decide, actually. If you were trying to prove to someone that you possess a sense of humor, but you also want to impress them, and make them feel less awkward, what would
"—Or me, huh Cas? I know you wanted to kiss me—"
I know, I know... it's been FOREVER. I'M SORRY.
Even though Sam's curiosity levels were an all-time high, he'd decided to wait until Charlie arrived before digging into the evidence. Or at least… most of it. He did want to be a little less of a novice in the
splattered across a few of the pieces.
Sam slapped himself in the face a few times to stay awake, blinking rapidly, and began reading.
He had already overstepped his finish line.
Something blue caught the corner of Cas's vision, a dripping sigil, still freshly sprayed on the inside of the motel door across the room. Then he noticed the larger sigil beneath his feet, encircling both himself and Dean.
He glanced at the rear-view mirror, to see Cas peering interestedly out the window.
"You see a random teenager, who
“Dean! I thought I heard the door open.” Jack steps out into the map room just as Dean steps off the last metal stair. The boy is holding a bowl of something and honestly Dean is too hungry to care what it is.
“Jack! Atlas! How was your flight?” Cas greets his son and his joyfriend.
Dean takes a breath, considering. "But- I can write it all out, I mean, I have—"
Dean’s grip on the tie weakens, and the corners of his bloody lips creep upwards, a ghost of a smile.
the color of Dean’s cheeks as his mouth speaks words of desperate desire, the color of all and everything that is felt when fire meets fire and control is withheld.
"It's…. better than the sandwich," Cas admitted.
"STOP."
“Sammy! Eileen! How was the drive?” Dean simultaneously signs and says.
And now the same man was throwing Dean at a case. Alone, for the first time.
close to spilling the whole story in Dean's face, if only to shut him up.
But now, sitting on a garishly-patterned bedspread, only inches away from Dean's tear-streaked face, the hunter's warm hand gripping his wrist more tightly than ever before, Cas feels a spreading panic writhing inside his chest, screaming warnings in his mind. He looks up at Dean, eyes wide, face tightening.
WE LOVE YALL.<3
And Sam was in love with her.
Tucking the receipt inside his coat pocket, right next to the mixtape, Cas walked down the alleyway and disappeared, a soft smile still hanging on his lips.
But now, the never-ending road to a bloody death, the promise of consistency, of purpose, the road he thought he'd die on….
Dean shook his head slowly. "Honestly, I don't know. If there's a hidden meaning, I wouldn't know it. I guess…" Dean shrugged, and picked up his fork again, flashing a grin at Cas. "I guess I just like you guys best, or something."
Dean shoots Cas a questioning look. He responds with one of his own that clearly says
He shoves a handful of the mix into his mouth and—
were the one who enjoyed it."
Actually, a lot of people had mentioned it.
Dean catches a glimpse of his angel’s amused smirk. “Oh, shut up,” he says as he takes Cas’s hand.
Golden light splashes across his flickering eyelids, and he hears more shouting. The throbbing pain is beginning to set in, but Dean feels more awake now, as if the numbing surprise has faded into panic.
Cas grunts, trying to push himself away from the Entity’s throne.
Cas bent over slightly, biting his bottom lip in concentration and Dean had to look away. The image was far too similar to—no. Those were the types of things he couldn't think about.
Dean stammers onward, gripping the angel tightly, because he can't stop speaking now that he started and Cas looks at Dean: finally meeting those too-green eyes, and he can't think, can't move, he can only feel, his chest shaking with each new hot, terrified breath, and he hangs on to Dean as he would to a rope ladder, the only source of safety above a pit of hellish nothingness.
“I, er, I mean, maybe a little,” Dean’s teeth chatter. “Sam must have f-f-forgotten to p-put the heat on.”
Dean grunted. "Hell of a visit. Almost killed us all."
Dean scoffed. "Who
He cleared his throat, and started over, tracing circles over Cas's thumb as a calming distraction, mind racing with everything he wanted to say.
Apparently, 'someday' was closer than anyone had expected, because three days into the hunt, Sam called. He'd met someone. He hadn't had much time to explain, but Dean was able to learn three things before Sam hung up.
Sacrificing their saved lives to save the life of the sacrificer. Around and around and around. And yet… Castiel knew he would do it a dozen times over, even if it was just to save one human.
Frowning, Cas pinched the front of his trenchcoat, and sniffed it. Still a bit damp from when Dean had fallen backwards into him, and apparently the source of the strong flowery scent.
Dean pushes his way through the opening, stepping fully into the blackness, ignoring Jack’s shouts of warning, and reaches out desperately for Cas’s wrist. Behind them, the Empty snarls, but this time, it’s not Meg’s voice, it’s cold, high-pitched, and definitely
"Why do you call me that?"
“If you think I’m gonna even
A long, hot, shower later and Charlie is in Cas’s ex-room. As she sits on the bed, something crinkly tickles her leg.
So Dean smiled as warmly as he could, and gripped the wheel tighter, forcing himself to act cheerier than he felt.
The arguments they had had—the memories caused Cas to grip his aching chest, almost bending over from the agony of it all.
"Plus—" Dean shuffled down to a different bin. He had collected about three films so far, but Cas couldn't see their covers. "I've had more fun with you in the past 24 hours than I've had with Sam in years, and you ain't exactly the life of the party," he joked.
"Oh." Cas fixed his attention back to the screen, and Dean was amused to notice that for once, the angel had
It felt so long ago.
“Dean! Now!” Jack shouts. Beads of sweat are already forming at his temples.
“Hey, you can do it now, buddy.”
And now it was enough to keep him going.
That in itself was enough.
----------------------------------------
Without waiting for an answer, Dean snatches the blue mug and walks quickly towards the kitchen, not looking back.
He sits there for a little longer, then finally realizes the one person, the only person, who would be able to help.
"I mean… yeah it's obviously our kind of thing, but how do you know for sure it's the same type of vamps we fought with Dad? These things could just be regular blood-suckers. Idiots, for sure. But… regular."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
have to dig through Dean's things to find evidence.
Dean frowned, puzzled by Cas's odd questions. "I mean, yeah. Why all the questions, Cas? You want to dress up as a cowboy again or something?"
But at 16 years old, sometimes being the big brother wasn't enough. Sometimes, when the newest motel room's walls seemed to stare at him, and the arsenal hidden under his bed kept him awake, and the sound of his father shouting through his phone in the next room became too unbearable, he felt a desperate, scratching need to be anyone but Dean Winchester.
"Let me get this straight: you come here. At night. To do art."
? What’re you doin’ over there?”
He would often visit Dean then, just to make sure. Cas could've calmed Dean's mind, soothed his dreams with a single touch of a finger, but Dean would never want that. And so the angel would sit in the soft chair that Dean kept in the corner, and every time, wondered what would happen if he finally did it, just pulled back the covers and held Dean as he deserved to be held, and loved with everything Cas could give.
"—well, yeah, you can't possibly feel sexy in a friggin trenchcoat," Dean interrupted, then paused. "Seriously, though, ever considered switching up your duds, there?"
know, but she nods all the same.
Hanging up the call, Sam pulls himself up out of the chair, his back and shoulder muscles aching in complaint.
"oh—oh man—" Dean wiped a tear sliding down his cheek, and he took a deep breath, straightening to relieve the cramps. He patted Cas fondly on the shoulder, still panting. "It means a 12 year old boy was here, Cas. That's what that means."
"Why would I burn down the bunker? I—wasn't
People were often amazed by how well Dean could remember the lyrics to every song he ever heard. They'd ask him to sing a random song as far as he could remember. Most times, 'as far as he could remember' ended up being the entire song, each word placed perfectly on melody.
him. Everywhere. Watch him in the library, head bent over Enochian literature. He'd walk into the map room, and see Cas arriving back home through the door, and watch him walk down the stairs, and he wouldn't have to wonder if the angel's visit was temporary, because it
But that was before he’d fallen in love with Dean. That was before Dean taught him to care, about Sam, about Jack, about the whole world.
Dean immediately reached over and grabbed the phone from Sam's hand, and answered it, ignoring Sam's glare.
Jack frowns, noticing his three dads looking at him. "Is something wrong?"
“There’s something I’d like to give you,” Cas says quietly.
Cas took a shaking breath. "—I know they were not
"What happened?"
"Hey, Jack: me again. Uh, just curious, but why are Claire and Kaia there? Actually—hey—put Claire on the phone, wouldja?"
A steady mantra of words pound in his head, but it takes a second for Cas to realize what is being said and who is saying them.
" Dean buried his face in his hands, squeezing his eyes shut against the voice. His
"Hello Jack." Dean could hear the angel's fond smile, even without looking.
Dean just grins and tosses his keys in the air before catching them. “You know me too well, angel.”
Angels weren’t made to feel emotions, and doing so would cost you.
How the ground had been slippery with puddles, and Dean put all his focus into each step because he knew if he stopped, he’d fall to his knees, and Cas would fall with him, into the earthy mud, and he knew neither of them would ever get up again.
At this moment, however, trapped in a sigil contrived by his younger brother in hopes of exposing their supposed
Cas tilted his head questioningly, as if he couldn't understand what Dean was so upset about. "I apologize. Perhaps I could tell you more about myself, so we can be—" Cas mimed quotation marks "—
Dean finished most of the meatloaf on his own, before Cas brought a fourth container out of the bag. "OH yes," Dean grinned. "Man I'd almost forgotten." He dug a fork eagerly into the pie, and almost groaned with relief at the familiar sweet cherry flavor. Cas smiled, amused at Dean's obvious euphoria.
the world had flashed through his eyes like water through a siphon, but he’d seen only shades of red, angry and dangerous.
Thanks for the comments and kudos so far guys ♥♥♥
For now. "You are, too, y'know," Dean mumbled hastily, before the voice could make another surprise entrance.
What do you do when there’s nothing left to dread? Because the thing you dreaded the most finally happened, and the person you want to talk to the most is gone, and the memories you love the most seem like dreams because how can they be real if
sticks, by the way), Dr. Sexy episode immediately reverting to where Dean last left off.
Inhaling heavily, he slumps backward, lying on the paint-splattered floor of the college art room. He feels warmth beneath his shirt, the cheap wood baked from the golden sun streaming in through large windows.
Cas stares ahead, into the morning sun. The light feels out of place amidst everything that has happened. It should be darker. It should be sunset, when everything bright fades in one last glorious display of color, the last crescendo of life before darkness.
Cas nodded, but Dean thought he could see a shining wetness in the angel's eyes that hadn't been there before.
Cas could feel his face burning up.
Cas sighed, and gave him a pointed look. "You spoke, and now I have a few things to say, and you are going to listen without argument."
Dean grabs a plate of chili-pepper mangos, and chews thoughtfully on the tangy slices of orange fruit.
He fights for words, but what is there to say? How do you find words when you know they could be your last? What do you say when any second could be the one you finally cease to exist?
Charlie jotted down the time frame, and sighed. "So that means we have about seventeen hours for me to find Dean's notes, while you read up on Chuck's new books, plus
"Heh," Dean stared at the sandwich, almost wondering if it was going to start oozing gray slime in a minute or two. He was at least 98% sure it wouldn't… but still.
Silence.
Cas realizes he doesn’t know how to knock.
Jack chomps on his burger. It's only been a couple hours since the deal was made, since the hourglass turned over.
Dean shook his head, stuffing his phone back into his jacket pocket. If Sam wanted to keep secrets, to hell with it. Dean had his own secrets after all.
Cas takes a bite of his pancakes. He never pours syrup on them. ‘
A strange mantra to repeat in one's head, but it's the only thing that has ever helped.
Liv hands Jack a list of things to remember while Dean gets better. “Remember to drink
“Are you… nervous?” Cas’s voice is gentle, but unworried, and Dean wants to stop these
Cas steps among the aisles, Dean following close behind with a basket. Cas turns around to inspect the items in Dean’s hand. “Dean, is that much sweets really necessary? You have…” he stops to count. “Three tins of pie, two chocolate cake mixes, a box of cookies, a bag of jolly ranchers, and
“Shut up and kiss me.”
Dean looked suspicious, and, Sam supposed, with good reason. Complicated as these vamps were, they were still just vamps. With a little digging around, and some visits to the nearest abandoned warehouses, Sam figured they could eventually find the nest. He'd done as much research as was necessary, and had actually found quite a bit of lore on old-timey vampire slave-owners. The pieces fit perfectly, which was rare in Sam's experience, so he knew there wasn't much else to do in the research area.
“I guess-” he breathes out a rattling laugh. “I guess this makes us a couple of dumbasses, huh- finally saying it on our freakin’ deathbed-”
A terrifying freedom, at worst.
—for Cas.
So this is kind of a short chapter—I'm so sorry.
"That's the black one."
Because there was no way Cas meant…
Man, our lives are weird.
Dean snapped out of his thoughts to see the angel waiting patiently for new instructions. He took a breath and hefted his own stick.
It’s been a tough road.
Dean grits his teeth at the memories, his stomach clenching.
Dean almost laughed, imagining the look on that poor cashier's face. "Huh. Well, dig in, I guess."
Shoved out of a home for the second time: first by heaven, then by Dean.
The blue eyed perverted janitor.
Cas let out a small breath, almost a laugh. "Boring."
Cas was standing at attention as always, hands dangling by his sides, and head tilted in that squinty-eyed expression of Cas-like confusion.
He feels a stinging tear slide its way down his cheeks, landing soundlessly in Dean’s mussed and bloody hair.
He would turn to that page—no bookmark required—countless times, until the corners were worn and thin, and he would trace gently over the words at the bottom of the page until the ink faded into indecipherable smudges.

"Cas, I…" Dean's voice was low, strained. He coughed and tried again. "I'm so sorry."
“My grace was dwindling anyway. It’s better this way.”
"Take
Cas shrugged his head slightly. "I didn't want to crease it. But other than the removal of the vest, I slept and worked in the same outfit."
But Dean didn't wait to hear the rest of the question. He stormed towards the door, grabbing up the keys from the table, knowing Cas would follow suit.
The quiet felt new, but so very welcome. Dean lifted his gaze to meet Cas's, eyes shining from the epiphany, relief and

"Oh." Dean considered this, surprised. "Have you ever—have you ever thought of—" he didn't honestly know how to finish the sentence without sounding intrusive. But Cas just smiled softly, knowing what he meant.
He laid backwards on the bed, and flipped on the TV, scrolling through the channels. Nothing good. He was about it turn it off when Cas stopped him with a gesture. It was a National Geographic documentary on native Hawaiian yellow-faced bees. Dean raised an eyebrow. "Really Cas. Honeybees again?"
Sam scoffed and gave him a shocked look. "I thought your whole saying was 'driver picks the music and shotgun shuts his cakehole!'"
Cas leans in and presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips. They both want more, but this is enough. For now. Closing his eyes, Dean tilts into the touch, their foreheads brushing together, and Dean can’t remember what he’d been worried about.
particular popcorn mix doesn’t include raw onions. Cas’s breath smells warm and buttery as he speaks, and Dean wonders if tonight’s kisses will once again be a new favorite flavor.
word of objection from Sam, but the hunter sank back down and seemed to abandon his half-sentence with… gleefulness?
Truly, all of you: your guys's comments… You all have been a fantastically happy part in my life, and I really won't ever forget you. (although, since we're writing more fics in the future, heheh, guess this isn't truly goodbye.)
Dean snorted when he saw it. "Good luck fitting your legs under

Cas flickered a smile at the remark. "I'm not—I was just thinking about people. Angels. I tried to help them, to show them how beautiful—" Cas stopped and Dean thought he could see a faint blush. "—how important, humanity is. I tried to show them that being an angel means… protection. Fighting for what's right. Not just following orders blindly."
“No,” Dean smiles, biting his lip, and he feels the inner glow of something warm curling inside his chest, bubbling its way up into his throat, his lips, his head. “No, definitely not, Cas.”
If he was honest with himself, Dean had known he was… not quite straight. For a long time. But after John had caught his son with… well, his father's reaction had been more than enough to stifle any growing curiosity. Until Cas.

“Dean?” Cas dips his head. “Is something wrong? Did I not do it right?”
At Dean’s door, she takes a deep breath.
"Dean, is ketchup a vegetable?"
The fondness in Cas's eyes when he had said those three simple words… the affection, true and earnest. It was undeniable. When would he ever become used to Cas's blunt devotion? He didn't think he ever could.
Even then, the fallen angel had been resisting heaven's most strict regulations, simply because Dean Winchester
Cas raised an eyebrow. "Actually, I think
“Cas, sunshine, of
Each book was like an individual chapter in the giant webpage collection, and with a little coding-hack courtesy of a certain red-haired genius, Sam could view all the chapters on one long single page, eliminating the need to load them up individually, and allowing him to search for key-words and terms throughout the entire compilation of works.
“Dean… of course you are. You are always beautiful.” Cas responds, certainty strengthening every word.
So now, he fulfills Dean's last wish: the last one he ever will.
“—but don’t you enjoy the bunker?”
Dean closed his eyes and took another breath, but it felt strangled in his burning throat.
Dean chuckled, and turned on speaker-phone, so Sam and Cas could hear. "No, Jack, you're good. Don't worry about it."

"So, Cas—" Dean started, then realized he didn't know what he'd planned on asking. "uhm—"

Dean coughed on the other end, and Sam frowned. "Dean?"
It had only been a few days since the proposal, and Dean had already committed a large portion of his mental energy towards the act of self sabotage.
Dean shook his head, but the image of Cas's electric stare seemed to have imprinted on the back of his eyelids, like a white hot light in a black room that you accidently stared at a little too long.

“Yeah, pal, I get that. So, here’s what you’re gonna do. Make a fist with your hand, like a fist bump.”
Yes. Dean could lie to himself, he could pretend and deny, he could hide himself in everyone's assumptions, but the truth came out in his humor, his teasing, he masked the thoughts over with lame jokes and fake laughs, but deep down, Dean wanted them to
“Dean,” Cas sighs and looks up at the ceiling, as if questioning the universe for why it handed him such a seemingly thick-skulled person to fall in love with.

Jack's powers still hadn't fully recovered, and according to Dean-Logic,

Well damn, they'd both been through some shit. And Cas has his scars, just like Dean. Cas has the dark bags under his eyes and the crows feet when he smiles..
He feels his hands shaking as Cas’s long fingers pull at the edge of Dean’s white t-shirt, sliding it off with simple ease, and Dean

- Charlie
It didn't take much convincing for Charlie to drop everything and hit the road. Luckily, she'd been attending a comic-con only a few hours away from the bunker, and as soon as Sam mentioned 'Dean and Cas,' that was all she needed to hear.
, if he tries to ignore everything that just happened: maybe the Empty won't consider it as true happiness.
it hurt even more than the shouting, because at least then, Sam could have said something, could have protected Dean like Dean had always protected him.
Swallowing, Dean nodded. "Good, I—I'm glad. But uh—" He patted Cas on the shoulder before opening his car door. "You need to invest in better friends. Your
"Yes."
Cas's hand was still shaking, and Dean squeezed their fingers together, praying Cas would understand what he was trying so desperately to say.
He answered it, because what else could he do? "Dean? Everything okay?"
“But you will always be beautiful to me. You will always be beautiful, Dean Winchester,” Cas breathes, and oh this feeling shouldn’t be real, this apprehension that all rules are about to be tossed out the damn window, that two minds will soon be lost in a small lamplit bedroom.
The pleading in Cas's voice almost froze him right then and there, almost made him let go. Dean held on tighter.
Dean nodded, giving Cas a wary glance as the angel joined him to look over Sam's shoulder. "Yeah, I remember. The apprentice vamps and the dead chicks they killed for their 'owners' or whatever. Weird masks, too."
It was strange, but undeniable, that over the years on Earth, Cas had become accustomed to humans' enhanced designs built specifically for comfort and relaxation. The impala, particularly, had some of the best cushioning he had ever experienced. He knew why Dean was so fond of the vehicle. He also knew that it wasn't simply due to the exceptional seating, or sleek appearance.
But he never got the chance to ask for any of that. Dean had just shoved some change and a used spare phone into his hand and let him out the door without a second glance.
His vision flickers, and he falls to his knees, just barely missing Cas’s body, his own blood flowing, dark and thick, around the cold metal in his stomach, and he has a sudden, strange feeling of guilt for ruining Cas’s trench coat.
"Cas, listen to me. Some stuff? You just gotta let go, okay? The people you let down, the ones you can't save—you gotta forget about 'em. For your own good." He tapped his forehead twice and gave Cas a 'sage' look.
Enjoy the pain ;)
The once-angel pulls away, just a breath of a moment, a low whisper into Dean’s ear: “I feel the same.”
?” Dean’s voice cracks, and he feels a new clenching in his chest. But this is the good kind of ache. The ache that grows and becomes an ache called happiness.
Last chapter: much healing, Charlie found Dean's poems and letters, which she shoved under their door. Cas read them. Dean proposed to Cas. No reply as of yet...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas seemed a little taken aback but nodded softly. "Of course."
"Really?"
“I’m glad you found these,” Dean whispers. And it’s true.
Sam shrugged his shoulders, shaking out his wrists and elbows.
I'm sorry it's been so long guys. I had a huge ice storm out here. No electricity. No wifi. NO FANFICTION. But after three days of misery, I'M BACK BITCHES.
Cas shakes his head. “Dean- don’t you understand? All these reasons, all the things we’ve done for each other— we’ve been real long before this. We were just too stupid to believe the other would feel the same way.” His words are bitter, and he feels Dean coughing weakly, head shaking against his thigh. The only thing he can do is keep talking.

sensation.. Almost like water running down his stomach. He can hear his own heart pounding.
"Yeah, I'd say so. She's a beauty, sir." The man grins, and Dean knows he says the right thing. He just landed the job. He can feel it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Holy… Okay. Cas, can I touch now? Please? Or are you just teasing me some more?”
but sure. Dean just shakes his head a little and smirks. After another few moments, Cas is back, but this time he's between Dean's legs.
" Cas slams his cock inside Dean, all the way to the hilt, and Dean's never felt so full. Pleasure rolls through him in a soft wave. Cas is above him, looking down at him with a pure unadulterated blissed-out expression until his eyes slip shut. But he's just sitting there.
“There’s always a chance, Dean,” Castiel says softly. At Dean’s sharp breath, Castiel turns to look at him. “I don’t want this to be over yet. More than anything, I’d just like a chance to do this the right way.”
"Oh, please, Sir. Don't leave me empty. Please. I need you!"
"I am his boyfriend, so if you don't mind, I would very much like it if you stopped trying to prostitute yourself to him." She gasps loudly and Castiel reaches down and grabs Dean's hands. He hauls him up onto his feet and meshes their mouths together, startling Dean into a gasped moan of shock and surprise. He grabs Dean's ass and pulls him against him, savaging his mouth with his tongue. He pulls away when he feels like Dean might need some air to look over at the woman and she has her mouth dropped open slackly, just staring at them.
"May I see where you were just talking to me from? I'm curious if we share the same layout." Dean shrugged.
Dean winces, and Castiel reigns his voice in, but his anger is pulsing red and hot. "If you think for one second I'm going to let your bastard of a father intimidate me away, you don't know me at all."
Dean nods enthusiastically. "Yes, Sir." He moans when Castiel brings the tip of his cock into his mouth and swirls his tongue around the slit. He thrusts his hips abortively, and Castiel pulls away with an eyebrow arched. Dean calls it his Dom Brow.
It definitely is, and that makes him infinitely more curious about the doctor and who designed these rooms. The other paintings appear to be innocent, but he's pretty sure that's Yoda standing behind a copse of trees in the one by the window.
“Damn right,” Cas says with authority. They dissolve into a fit of laughter.
"Hey, Cas."
He can't believe that he and Cas are about to get married. He and Sam live in Cas's house now, but only because Sam wanted to. Well, Dean wanted to live with his boyfriend, but not at the price of Sam's sanity. When Dean and Cas started dating he and Sammy had been living in the house Cas had given them, but after a year Sam had said it was stupid because they were either always over at Cas's house or he was over at theirs. That had been the deciding factor, really. Moving in was stupidly easy, and it made everything better.
"I mean, sure. We got along. After everything happened with Dad and Cas took you home, we got some food. It was so weird eating takeout Thai next to someone like him. He's so... put-together."
"Good."
"Good morning, baby boy," Castiel cradles Dean's face in his hand for a moment, looking at his boy. He's happy, blushing, and healthy. Castiel loves it. He can't imagine it getting better than this.
Cas groans into the phone.
Cas chuckles,
Sammy."
The hot water pounds down over his shoulders, and he can finally breathe a sigh of relief. He feels lighter than he has in a few days. The incident with John is going to linger on his mind for a while. As it is, he has a constant reminder every time he sees his face in a mirror or tries to rub his nose. The bruise is going to start yellowing around the edges soon but he's not sure how long it'll take to heal. It still smarts sometimes, and he isn't fond of the feelings. As he shampoos his hair he makes a mental note to ask Cain what happened to John. It's Castiel's dearest hope that he's locked up somewhere with no sunlight and maybe a bucket to piss in. Castiel doubts that he's lucky enough to get his wish, but he can dream. He shakes his head at himself and rinses off. He really shouldn't wish someone ill, but if anyone in the world deserved it, it would be John Winchester.
The doctor clears her throat and begins, "How often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, irritable, or hopeless?"
Oh boy. I'm really excited. I don't have a Beta reader, but I do have a wonderful sister who puts up with my BS and reads my fanfic just because I ask her to, and she's never even watched Supernatural. She helps me with my mistakes and doesn't care to point out when a sentence sounds retarded, so I'm totally doing a shout out right now. Love you, 'Retta! You're awesome sauce, and I'm sorry I made you read my crappy smut! *dies laughing
When he finds Dean sobbing and gasping for breath on the bathroom floor, his heart tears a little, but he also knows that this is the first step on Dean's way to healing from his past. So Castiel will be here, he'll hold him, and comfort him, and guide him through this. He almost wishes it could've ended differently, but he knows there wasn't any other way. He sits next to Dean on the cold tile and cradles him against his chest, a few moments later Sam joins them.
"What about... circus?" He looks up at Cas.
"Tell me. It's alright."
His voice was husky and Dean's hands were twitching on his thighs. "Yes. I apologize if this is inappropriate, but my own was covered in semen." Dean briefly closed his eyes as he chuckled then shook his head as he stood up and made his way to the dresser. "Here." He tossed Castiel a plain grey t-shirt that he immediately donned since his semi-naked state seemed to make Dean uncomfortable. It was a little loose on him, but he liked the smell that wafted up from the fabric. It smelled like Dean and he couldn't help but breathe it in deeply. The man genuinely smelled amazing and it had the oddest effects on Castiel. He found himself enjoying it.
then brought Castiel's entire length into his mouth, and
The bathroom door is closed. Castiel can hear the water running, though. Did Dean fall in the shower? Maybe Dean just slammed the door on accident. That could've been what woke Castiel. Tentatively, he allows some of the concern to wash away, but he still needs to check on Dean. He knocks on the door with his knuckle and waits. And waits. After a few more moments, Castiel raps again but met with the same result. Maybe Dean did fall.  More concerned now, Castiel opens the door. He mentally prepares himself to be met with the sight of blood, but there's nothing except his gleaming tile. It feels as if Castiel has stepped into a tropical jungle.  Steam is billowing out, and the heatwave is enough to make him sweat almost instantly. He’s suddenly glad that he didn't get dressed.
"He has a name!" Cas roars, "He's your son, and you should treat him with some respect."
Dean chuckles as he puts the key in the ignition. Dad had been so pissed about those picture day results that he'd torn Dean a new one so he hasn't risked doing it since. The thought of Dad sobers Dean a little and he sighs. He rubs his face with his hands and leans back in the seat.
"Look, lady-"
After they eat breakfast, and they're just sitting at the table, Cas brings up the subject of kink negotiations. The negotiations involve a contract and ten billion questions. Dean's mind is kind of blown. Cas is his boyfriend, but he wants to do this contractual BDSM thing with him too. He guesses it makes sense. That will keep their playing safe, and Dean won't have to worry about Cas not knowing his limits or pushing too far.
He slips the tip of his thumb into his mouth, pressing the textured pad of it against his front teeth and closing his lips around it - not even thinking about it.
"Angelic, hmm?" Cas leans forward and presses a kiss to Dean's forehead, "I can accept that, but only if you tell me you're beautiful."
He looks up at her, "Why do we need to do all that? I thought this would kind of be a wham bam situation."
"I agree. That was amazing... Are you still wanting more, Dean? It's fine if you're not, I will most definitely not hold it against you. You've been amazing tonight, more so than I ever could've hoped."
Dean laughs. Dude is always so formal. "Best regards" Nobody talks like that anymore. He grabs a sheet of notebook paper from the dwindling pile on the table and writes his letter. He drops it off at the post office on his way to work and he wonders all day about the reply he's going to get.
He sighed almost inaudibly and Dean gave a small chuckle. "Sorry. A side effect of blood loss. Sleep. I've got ya. Sleep, Cas." Castiel was out before the words were even finished, he was just so tired all of a sudden.
He closes his eyes and breathes deeply. The room is hot and smells like sex and sweat, and it's glorious. He's addicted to the smell, he thinks. It's a homey, thick smell that makes him think of silk sheets and pillows that feel too nice against his head. Big bathtubs and slick skin sliding against rough callouses. He lays his head on Cas's shoulder and snuggles into his neck so he can listen to his heartbeat.
IF YOU ARE SQUICKED EASILY: Please review the bottom notes (SPOILER ALERT) before reading. NO trigger warnings, it just might gross some of y'all out. It read HAWT to me, but everybody's different.
"I'm glad I was able to. Thank you for bringing me." Dean smiles at his boyfriend's shy blush. "It's all good, Cas. I really don't mind. But don't tell Sammy I said that. I have a rep to keep up." Cas's amused smile warmed his blood. "Your secret's safe with me, Dean."
Silence falls again, and Dean wonders.
"How can you promise that? They're bees!"
"Hood!" Dean says, shaking his head.
"You could've fooled me. Do you always run from intimacy? Or is it because you initiated it?" Dean gulps. Fuck. Cas apparently knows him pretty well. Well crap. In defeat, Dean lays his head down on his arms, which he brought up to rest on the counter. He sighs deeply.
"Yes, baby boy. Cum for me." Castiel grips Dean's cock in hand and starts stroking the slick member with a firm grip. Dean keens and throws his head back, panting wildly and gyrating his body. "Gonna cum. Gonna cum, Sir."
When they were finished Cas leaned over and kissed Dean fully on the mouth with slightly greasy lips and said, "Thank you."
"It feels fucking amazing, Sir. It's restrictive, but kind of like a cocoon too. I feel safe. And secure. And I'm really, really, ready for you to do something with me, Sir. Please." Dean is aching to be touched. Rope apparently really turns him on, or maybe it's Cas having all this power over him, or it's both, but whatever it is, it has his cock hard and 100% ready to be touched.
"Ugh. It was just so damned stupid. The clients were hovering over me the whole time I was looking over the Maserati, which is a great car, by the way, and they were questioning me about everything. These idiots didn't know the first thing about cars! They questioned my credentials and qualifications, like I'm stupid or something and not literally fixing their precious piece of garbage. It was ridiculous!"
Fuck, all the authority in that voice has Dean immediately going still. Okay, he can do this.
::::::::::::
"Then why didn't you embrace me?"
Dean sighed. Early in the morning for deep conversations, really.
Dean wakes to warm breath coming across his face, and it doesn't smell pleasant. He cracks an eye open and chuckles, his throat rusty from disuse. The side of Cas's face is squished against the pillow, and his mouth is open. With the sun shining in a bright halo behind Cas, Dean can see the age difference in themselves. Cas has eye crinkles and forehead lines where Dean does not. He has the tiniest glint of silver at his hairline by his ears. It's almost impossible to see, and Dean doesn't think it'd be noticeable for several, several, more years. But he can see it just now, studying him. Cas's skin is tan, lined, and loved, obviously sun-kissed and wind-hugged. He looks like a man that loves the outdoors, and Dean knows that's true.
They break apart in confusion at the same time and Dean flushes crimson when he sees someone standing at the front of the car. An elderly man with a cane and a floppy hat gives them double thumbs up and a huge false-teeth grin and starts walking away and Dean bursts out laughing. Cas starts laughing too, and soon Dean can't breathe he's laughing so hard. What the fuck? He finally finishes giggling and wipes away the tears from his eyes. He looks over to find Cas staring at him with something unreadable but happy in his eyes. "Apparently we did a good job."
Of course. Cas sends him another answer and Dean's eyes start to water as he reads the message. God, he's been waiting for this day forever. Today he gets to marry his best friend. The crying boy from next door who was just too loveable to ignore. Dean hasn't been happier. They had decided to walk down the aisle together so Cas was literally just outside his door right now. With the words of Cas's last text ringing in his mind, Dean pulls open the door only to have his future husband waiting on the other side with a beautiful, blinding smile, and he still had the bluest eyes Dean has ever seen.
"Who was your first kiss?"
And he had been. He had found this place after all. It was a half burnt out old house, but he and Sammy stayed in a back bedroom. It still had a door and everything so they didn't get too cold at night.
"What? I want to know."
Dean rolls over at the ding from his phone and unlocks it. He's hoping... Yes! It was a message from Cas. They'd talked a few times since the meeting at the diner, but they'd both been busy. Dean had been hoping to hear from him tonight since he wasn't too busy the next couple of days.
"No need to apologize. I'm glad I was here. Thank you for telling me, Dean."
at the stretch.
"What's next?" Dean asks in a choked whisper. He feels cold metal sliding down his throat, and he doesn't understand what it is until Cas starts swirling it around his nipple with a slight metallic clanking, like a chain. Dean moans when he figures out it's a clamp, raising his head up and flopping it back uselessly. "You want it, baby boy?"
D: fuck I think it was about 0'4 or so
"Do not lie to me, Dean. I can smell it. And if that weren't enough, a certain part of your anatomy is currently poking my vessel." Cas rocks his hips down just to prove his point and Dean bites his lip to keep from moaning out loud at the friction on his dick from the thin pillow rubbing against him.
There's a command in his voice, and Castiel arches an eyebrow at it as his eyes meet Dean's, but he says nothing. He doesn't have a right to say anything right now anyway. Dean's verdant green eyes implore him.
"You wanted to feed? Attack, I'm guessin'?" Dean looked at the cracked pavement with a small amount of shame at his lack of self-control. "Yeah, something like that." Benny laid a warm hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently. Dean looked up at him curiously. "It's alright. It happens. It's a claim."
Cas had given him the softest smile when he’d offered it to him. He’d remember that fondly for a while. Dean’s surprised to find a lump forming in his throat, and he chokes a little and blinks against the wetness in his eyes. Cas turns around, eyes worried.
Everyone turns to look at Cain. He looks for all the world like the cat that ate the canary. A powerful businessman with the world at his fingertips. "If young Sam here can track a cellphone, we have a way of locating the man in question." He turns his steely grey gaze to Sam. "Can you do that, boy?"
Suddenly hands are cradling his face, and he's being nudged to look up into big blue eyes. Kind eyes, he realizes.
So good! Don't stop." Dean pants. Castiel chuckles and pushes his fingers into Dean slowly and gingerly, loving the gradual build.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel rubs his hands over his stubbled face and sighs heavily. Meeting the parents is supposed to be a momentous occasion. You dress up for it, put your best foot forward, and wear a brave face. You don’t get punched in the face. Castiel had been happy to do that, not just for Dean but Sam too. The eldest Winchester had deserved that, and more. But since he’d come around, his and Dean’s perfectly weird relationship had changed into something that they weren’t prepared for. It wasn’t even Dean’s fault. It was just emotional fallout on both their parts.
At least this time it had been a relatively happy memory. It hadn't exactly been Brady Bunch level happy, but it had been enough at the time. Sam had been eight at the time, and Dean twelve. That had been the first time he'd met Benny, but it certianly wouldn't be the last. The guy had kept showing up over and over again until Dean had finally questioned him about it.
"I hope so, Sir," Dean quips back and gasps and rocks forward when a hand lands on his ass with a loud
Dean feels his mouth drop open, but he can't summon the brainpower to fix it. Cas? A sub? What? He can't put the two things together at all. He can't imagine Cas being willingly obedient to another's will or obeying someone's orders. He's just so dominant and in control all the time. He blinks up at Cas, who's smiling at him, eyes twinkling. "You can't see it, can you?"
Dean chuckled at the angel's ruffled tone. "Yeah,
Cas seemed to be getting more and more distressed as Sam's silence continued. The hunter was squinting at him curiously, as if trying to decipher Cas's sentence. But it had been perfectly clear, he thought? Sometimes, the human language seemed to possess an unmanageable number of 'slang' terms and completely incomprehensible references. Dean himself seemed to hold an entire archive of strange words and phases within his being. It was frustrating, being unable to understand his—
He tried to ignore the heat pulsing through his body, the way his forehead felt flushed and his knees were so numb and

Janitor boy watches, standing awkwardly a few feet away, as if he is the intruder instead of the other way around.
He listened to the voicemail twice, three times, a dozen times, until his hand was shaking too much, his fingers too cold from the morning air seeping in through the door’s holes, and he’d tucked the phone back into the trenchcoat’s inner pocket, right next to the Zeppelin mixtape.

Of course, to John, this wasn't some 'father son bonding session,' it was just another lesson in survival. Another lesson proving that 'fun' wasn't part of a hunter's vocabulary. Not even for a five year old hunter. Certainly not for Dean.

flown, quite literally. It was undoubtedly a pleasant experience, and was missed deeply on the several occasions he’d been deprived of his wings… but there were far better experiences. Far better comparisons.
Every day at that gas-station, Cas believed that Dean would've allowed him to stay if he'd been an angel. If he'd been
Turned out Dean had been right, even though Sam had hated to admit it. And looking back at his younger, much less experienced self, Sam realized now just how right Dean had been.
"—well, because those songs and I have been through a lot together." He tried desperately to meet Cas's eyes, maybe Cas would know what he meant, maybe he wouldn't have to suffocate himself with pathetically inferior
That's what matters of course. Death is only tragic when it kills, they say. Better the inside than the out, they say.
Then the embarrassment passed, and with it, his sanity.
"Castiel…we feel you are becoming too close to the humans in your care. Particularly, a certain Dean Winchester. The other angels are becoming… resentful. They are beginning to wonder if humanity, and its many tantalizing peculiarities, is perhaps superior to heaven's duties."

as he always had.
She'd hesitated slightly, each time she spoke of the Bad. This detail is somehow still clear in Dean's mind, even months later.
And as Cas dips him down into the mattress, their mingled sounds slowly working to unfold the last secret between them, Dean remembers when he thought red was a bad color.
The bathroom walls were slick with condensation, the air humid, Dean's occasional humming filling in the spaces for the song lyrics he couldn't remember. Cas almost left the bathroom. He hadn't realized Dean had been taking a shower. In his experience, humans seemed to become rather self-conscious about their naked forms when around others. It wasn't something Castiel understood very well, since he himself even as a

Maybe it was all about saving one human after all. Maybe it was selfish to risk the entire world for one man's life, but hadn't Dean done the same for him? For Sam?

The end never comes when we expect it to.
A beige trenchcoat draped across his lap.
And how had he gotten lost here, and then everything would feel wrong and terrifying because how could happiness be comforting, if it could so easily be replaced by fear? And how could comfort be real, if he was always going to be second-guessing its validity?
Cas walked hurriedly away from the sandbox-portal, knowing that despite her offering of peace, Hannah's instincts revolved around justice, and her first decree of business would undoubtedly be the immediate apprehension of the Rogue Seraph, Castiel.
----------------------------------------------------
And it is still pain, but just for a moment, and it is the color of the marks Dean leaves on a dark haired man’s neck, the heat from their breaths, a flush in their cheeks that will reappear tomorrow morning when Sam inevitably asks the question.
This is one of the best experiences of my life so far, writing this. I’ve met so many amazing people. we’ve laughed, screamed in anguish, and cried together, and I love all of you for it :>
to him about it… he denies everything." She frowned so seriously, Sam could have imagined she was working a deadly case, instead of trying to parent-trap his brother and their best friend.
Dean thinks, and sliding one hand around the back of Cas’s neck, Dean doesn’t try to explain. He doesn’t try to second guess himself. No more doubts.
"We stayed in the same town working on hunts together with Dad, for a few months."

was the mess, and Cas could never be truly happy with him. Peace was something Dean Winchester had never had, and yet it was only the bare minimum of what Cas deserved.
“Here, take my coat.” Cas shrugs out of his tan trenchcoat and wraps it around the plaid-clad hunter.
When he gets home, the lights are on, the TV is tuned to Dr. Sexy, and the smell of burgers waft from the kitchen.
The thought struck a spike of nervousness through Dean's throat. He liked the idea of just being

more.
The rest of the evening was relaxed. Cas was able to finish the nature program before he left, and to Sam's surprise, Dean spent the next hour or so watching the following program, which was apparently on America's most dangerous animals.
"ahhh. So you've got yourself some company do you? And how is the poor love-sick Dean?"
Dean gestured at the triangle, and the 15 balls nestled inside. "Okay, so this is how you set up the game. Make sure to put the 8 ball in the middle—" Cas leaned over, dark head right below Dean's chin, studying the arrangement.
Cas shrugged. "Actually, it's not as molecular as other foods I've eaten. Less ingredients, perhaps. Do you want to try the sweetbreads?"
"Cas, I—" he croaked, but couldn't finish the sentence.
The guy kinda sucks at expressing himself, so we'll have to see just how much he's actually come to terms with, and how much he's still… ignoring."
"It—heh. It means 'I'm your man.' Like, 'I'm the man you're looking for.' Sometimes, though, it referred to a significant other. "
They are downtown. Cas has to admit it is a very beautiful city; the capitol building a spectacular work of architecture.
She follows Sam out of the door, casting a suspicious look at Dean and Cas.
If Cas was blue ocean waves, Dean was the hurricane that twisted the beautiful water into a fury.
And Cas, the angel he fell in love with, the ratty trenchcoat and the backwards tie, and that smile reserved just for him, and that stupidly endearing head tilt, stands before him.
"No. Everything is fine, Dean. I only want you to know—I'm here to stay. If you'll have me."
So when Sam arrives early back at the bunker alone, Dean is nervous, to say the least.
Dean shudders as the entity crouches down next to them, faceless head tilted down at Cas’s horrified expression.
"Shit, I really am losing my mind."
thank you for your interest and support. Jupiticas, and you guys: ya'll are the reason I'm smiling right now.
“Wait—Cas. Earlier. Did you… call me-
Her smile quickly fades to a frown as she sees Sam’s exhausted expression. “You forgot to sleep last night or somethin?”
“I love this song.” Dean snuggles in closer to Cas, drifting off to sleep.
He knew now, he had been selfish, to show his truth to Cas, but he hadn't had it in him to keep his secret a secret any longer. He only hoped Cas would forgive him, and be able to move on.
Sam choked out loudly, hoping she could take a hint and save the call for later. Later, when Dean wasn't around.
ALSO: thank YOU GUYS for your BEAUTIFUL FRICKING COMMENTS. I have cried a couple times reading them, and istg some of these comments are the longest I've ever seen on AO3. (you know who you are <3)
Trying to hold back a laugh, Dean coughed into his arm, hiding an amused grin. "Gee, Cas, you weren't kidding. That's gotta be one of the weirdest questions yet. I mean—" he gestured vaguely at the angel's outfit, "there's no way you were able to sleep in that stuffy trenchcoat when
Hannah was wrong. His instincts did not point to heaven and they never had. He knew whose side he faced towards, and he knew which side he would betray, again and again and again, if only to save one human.
So Dean shoved away the pain, as far back as he could reach. He scooted closer to Cas, gently wiped away the angel's tears, and without another word, laid Castiel back onto the bed. He adjusted the pillows, and unfolded the blanket. He wrapped it tightly around Cas's shivering body.
Then, a few months ago, on the day Sam had walked up to Dean's door after Bobby's phone-call: he'd heard the damned thing again. Of course, this in itself wasn't enough to warrant suspicion. But there had been more than one occasion when he'd walked in on Dean clacking away, only to have his older brother sheepishly yank the sheet out, crumple it into a ball, and throw it into the wastebasket, all before Sam could even get a glance at what he'd been writing.
Cas tries to hide the pang of sadness that comes over him, forcing out a weak nod. “Yes. Yes, I suppose so.”
wait." Charlie took a deep, shaking breath, and sat up, wiping away the tears. "How did Dean react?"
. Cas looks so
feel, and I just- can't."
Dean spins around, mouth opening with a rebuttal but Cas only speaks louder. "-I have to be there when they want me to be there, because I haven't forgotten what I did to that place-"
I can't believe I did that to you. You're
—but there was only silence.
Free-time had never been a good thing to Dean before. It had always meant reaching 'the end,' the big bad deadline, and knowing it was too late to keep all the promises he'd made, and far too late to make good on all those secret hopes, experiences, that he'd put off for another day. It meant drinking himself to sleep at 4 in the morning because he woke up alone, twisting in his own cold sweat. It meant taking every chance he could to rip out the last of his anger, and he did: God, did he ever. When he wasn't drunk on the pain, he was dishing it out to everyone who was still alive, who still had the guts to be around him.
"Get a B&B in Vermont," Cas says..
Sam had almost thought of asking to go with Dean, but something about the hard glint in John's eyes had stopped him. This was meant for Dean only, and the thought scared Sam. He could still remember how bloody and broken his brother had looked on that night only months ago, and how cold his father had been… as if he hadn't cared. As if beating his son within an inch of his life hadn't bothered him one bit.
Sometimes, the fake characters made him laugh. And he learned laughter was the best way to hide the pain.
"I was thinking more along the lines of a computer," Blue Eyes retorts.
Cas tastes salt as a tear slips in through his own half-smile, and he presses a quaking kiss to Dean’s forehead. “The next time I say it you’re going to be okay, Dean, you’re going to be alive, and we’ll have plenty of time to say it, and—”

pain… Sam was curious, but there was a difference between researching and
Making a mental list of all the friends he'd ever killed, and an even longer list of all the memories he'd spent years trying to repress. It meant regretting all the times he'd cursed Sammy's name, calling him a monster, a
So Sam had to sit in silent sweatiness for about half an hour before Dean finally came out of the shower wearing a red flannel and looking even more miserable than before.
Dean paused, still refusing to meet Cas's gaze; voice roughened and hard. "He's fine. You spoke to him yesterday, remember?"
Dean closed himself off, almost of habit. It was like flipping a switch. Turning his mind to stone had become easier than pretending, at this point. Easier than putting on that dumb act of a joking, care-free brother. A perfect hunter, not only built for the job but
"I believe I might be killed immediately if I reveal any of those things to you Dean," Cas said, obviously amused at Dean's curiosity.
"You pleaded. You shouted. You told me lies, that I tried to ignore, but there are days, sometimes, when I can still hear them, days when I wonder if there may have been a bit of truth to them.
Charlie waited as Sam read through the list, his eyebrows climbing higher with each sentence. "And you really think
But then the feelings of confusion would creep in, and
"Nah. I can't believe that. An angel's life? Boring?" Dean prodded Cas's shoulder. "Come on, I just revealed to you my deepest secret, you've gotta have something better than that."
"So how's Eileen?" Dean asks, leaning casually against the table with Cas pressed into his side. He tries to keep the goofy grin off his face, and fails miserably. For once, Sam doesn't make a teasing remark, which Dean supposes is due to the appearance of a certain name.
The lady just stares at him with cold, blue eyes. Nothing like the dream-man.
