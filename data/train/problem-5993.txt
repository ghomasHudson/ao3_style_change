“We never really talked about the giant, fairy sized elephant in the room,” Natasha hummed, turning the corner onto their street. “Did you get a look at his fairy? You’re officially in a lifelong bond, too, y’know.”
, for Christ’s sakes.
“Tony Stark,” he introduced himself instead, and stuck his arm out for Steve to shake once he had straightened back up again. “Nice to meet you.”
Peter was also usually a really good kid. He had his moments, because all kids did, but he was usually well behaved and happy. Now, however, he scrunched his little fists together and actually
“Kitchen,” Tony told him, helpfully snatching up the top couple of boxes before they could fall. “Thanks, buddy.”
“How so?” he bit, glancing over at the barman across the bar before leaning over to grab an unopened bottle of whiskey from under the bar.
“My friends tried to get tickets,” Peter replied. “It’s sold out, Pops.”
“Okay,” Tony called back, and then grinned sheepishly at Steve. “I better get back to my buddy.”
“- came along and suddenly you throw our friendship away? What’s so special about that damn place?”
“Yep,” he replied instead, taking a drink from his own bottle. “All wet and glistening and everything.”
“Save them,” Tony whispered against his lips, pecked him one last time. “
“Oh, it’s in my truck outside,” Lang replied. “You want me to pull it in?”
Steve didn’t immediately understand.
“I guess so,” Tony agreed, chest feeling a little tight even as he said the words. “So, uh… yeah. I’ll meet you at the airport later.”
The power was immediate. He felt himself screaming, but couldn’t hear the sound coming from his mouth; his vision immediately disappeared, replaced by an intuition he wasn’t sure he knew the origin of. He was everything and nothing all at once, power and lack thereof, and knew he would quickly get lost in the sensation if he didn’t focus.
“We can’t all go,” he told them, “because that’s too many variables that could mess with time. I’ve chosen you to come with me because I believe we’re the best chance at making this work, but it’s going to be dangerous – deadly, even. If you don’t want to risk that, there’ll be no hard feelings, but you should make it known now.”
“Daddy did all the work,” Tony mumbled under his breath as he passed Steve to grab a bag of candy. Steve caught his wrist before he could get too far away, however, and reeled him in for a kiss.
“Why don’t you just go over there and give him a piece of your mind?” Bucky asked, shovelling pudding into his mouth from his seat next to Steve in the cafeteria.
Taking a couple of deep, steadying breaths, he took the knife from the stove and sat back down at the table. He shook as he laid his left hand down on the table-top, palm up.
all of a sudden?”
It was a trap – it had to be a trap. But… Peter was tired, and his hand hurt, and he so desperately wanted it to be his real Pops, his not-brainwashed one, that he found himself shuffling forwards towards the door. He wanted to go home, and he wanted pizza, and his jammies, and his bedroom, and –
Running a towel through his damp hair, he padded over to the bathroom and quickly relieved himself. Then, feeling marginally better, he snagged a clean shirt from the back of a chair and padded back out into the hall, thinking it was probably better to get the meet and greet out of the way in Steve’s room so nobody had the opportunity to take any of his stuff.
He thought about going back out through the door, but where was the showmanship in that? He was already going to have to remodel the building – might as well go out in style. With that in mind, he kicked his foot repulsors to life and went smashing through the wall, sending plaster and debris everywhere.
“You pulled your tracker out, huh?” his Dad added, gently taking Peter’s left hand in his own. It had been bandaged while he had been out, and – all things considered – actually hurt the least of all his injuries. “You knew that’s how we’d get to you.”
Natasha smirked, as though she knew exactly how weirdly nervous he felt. “Adorable.”
Natasha smirked, and Steve felt his face heat up a little.
, as Tony had started dubbing it (not that he thought about it at all, of course), he once again stepped out of his apartment to head off to work, only to have a towel clad body dart past him from James and Tasha’s apartment next door.
Tony didn’t know what he’d done to deserve this.
“So, what’s your plan for the day?” his Ma asked as she finally sat down at the table, placing a plate stacked with bacon between them.
be on stage,” Tony told him. “You’re really good.”
“Will do, bud,” Bucky nodded.
But after a quick, stern talking to himself, he took one more deep breath, and then strode forwards as confidently as he could manage.
“Hey!” the blonde woman called, having just spotted Steve skid to a halt in the middle of the lawn. “Hey, you! Friend or foe?”
Tony was gone.
they were talking about.
“He wouldn’t be yours either if you hadn’t moved and left me back on the old block,” Pepper sniffed in reply, and then grinned at him.
“We need to destroy the whole thing,” he continued. “That’s the only thing that can hold all that power and not burn up – we have to use it to destroy the stones.”
“Sure thing,” Sam nodded. “Now would that be what we have on tap, or do you wanna try one of our cask ales -?”
“You’re rambling again,” Natasha sighed.
Around them, the other people in the bar laughed raucously and sang as they drank; Tony was under the impression that a team had won a sports thing, or something. Probably. Honestly, Tony had no fucking clue.
Tony had found, especially over the past few years, that the term
Steve swallowed hard and took a deep breath. “I have to believe we can.”
“Okay,” Peter sighed, resting his little head on Steve’s shoulder. “I guess that’s okay, then.”
“Good morning,” he smiled at his Ma, who was already up and standing by the stove. The smell of sizzling bacon hit him, and he hummed. “Smells good.”
“It’s nice to meet you, James,” she continued, and Bucky found himself grinning like a fool.
“Hey… guys,” he smiled weakly, but there was no hint of recognition in their eyes. “Look, why don’t we just put this behind us and go get milkshakes? Huh, Uncle Thor? I’ll get you a banana one –“
“We have to sacrifice something?” Lang asked incredulously as they all stared down into the depths of the pit in front of them. “Um… what?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Sure you don’t want something a little stronger? Bucky’s not gonna suddenly choke and die just because you drink a beer.”
have died if not for their quick thinking, but you did it anyway. You’re not a bad person, Iron Man.”
Peter did feel safe. There was still an overwhelming urge to pull away and run, a tension in his spine that had nothing to do with his injuries, but he knew that would go away. He wanted it to go away, because he knew he was safe.
“Can I come?” Clint asked hopefully, tucking his chair in as he spoke so Tony could squeeze past to sit at the table with them.
“We had a misunderstanding, but everything’s okay now,” he smiled, and Tony nodded in surrender. “So, are you boys ready?”
Tony cried a lot over the next couple of days. He cried when he first saw Rhodey, cried when he learned what had happened to Pepper, cried when Natasha hugged him, cried when he had his first cheeseburger, cried when they added Peter Parker, Steven Strange, Peter Quill, Drax, Gamora and Mantis onto the list of those they’d lost.
“You really think,” Rhodes started, and for the first time Steve heard a little slur of alcohol in his voice. “You think we can reverse this?”
“I should probably put some clothes on first,” Steve muttered sheepishly.
“Hands off,” Tony told her. “He’s my wet dream inducing, stud muffin neighbour, not yours.”
Maybe Tony wasn’t quite done being Iron Man yet, after all.
“Get out,” Tony whispered, and then screamed, “GET OUT.”
“Oh,” was all Steve could manage.
“So this might be a little bit presumptuous, seeing how you just died,” Tony started, “but do you maybe wanna spend the rest of time with me?”
All at once, the world shuddered back to life with sickening speed, and Steve felt a little dizzy. Taking a deep breath, then another, he managed to gasp out, “Take the bike to Tony’s. He’ll – he’s the best in town.”
They ended up talking for a lot longer than either of them had anticipated; in the end, Rhodey decided to crash at Tony’s place. It wasn’t the first time they’d spooned – at this point, it was practically normal to loan Rhodey a pair of his PJs and get some snuggle time in.
. Glancing over at Natasha, she sent him a look that told him she was thinking the exact same thing.
“Natasha!”
Fine. Whatever. It’d only be a couple of weeks, tops, anyway. Tony could manage being small and discreet for that length of time, he was sure.
When the fog cleared from his eyes, the guy had obviously moved on over to the bar, having already forgotten Tony was there at all, but Tony felt different, somehow. Changed.
“This is property damage, Tony,” Steve told him seriously, though he didn’t complain when Tony handed him a carton of eggs.
They were in for a long night.
,” he whimpered before he could stop himself, and, as if he were in some sick dream, the lion’s head jerked up and it stared at him lazily.
“Morning,” Tony hummed with a happy sigh. Smooching James sloppily on the cheek, he let the boy down so he could wrap his arms around Steve’s waist. “You’re looking particularly ravishing this morning.”
“He was watching after all?” Tony huffed. “I gotta say, he’s hot, but you’re not instilling much confidence in me, here.”
Steve heard more than a few sighs of relief.
Tony froze.
By the time he had turned, had dodged a series of bullets that seemed to be coming from everywhere, Pietro was already off his bike and in a heap on the ground, covered in blood. Steve heard Wanda scream, and knew that she had realised what had happened, too.
“Just a second, honey,” Steve replied with a patience that Tony honestly couldn’t fathom.
“You -” Tony caught his arm as he made to sweep past him, “- could drop by my restaurant sometime, if you wanted. I – we could return the favour. Only if you wanted, of course -”
“He’s… he’s been like this all morning,” Steve croaked, gesturing with Peter’s suit still in his hand. “I don’t – God, I don’t know what to do.”
“I’m just fine, J, okay, but I need you to put me through to Pepper,” he replied, grabbing the pair of pants Cap had left for him. He began tugging them on one handed. “On a private line, if you would, dear.”
The back of his head was starting to niggle with pain as he dodged past a couple very enthusiastically making out at the end of the bar, and he wondered if maybe he’d drank a little too much, too. He spotted a fairy, small, tucked into one of the guy’s pockets and offered her a harried, empathetic smile as he zipped on by.
“Some of us need time to recuperate from traumatic experiences, Steve,” Tony grumbled, his breath hot against Steve’s back. “Shut up and at least pretend to be asleep before your Ma comes in here and reams you out.”
fairies knew of their existence, but the general consensus was that they were just mythical creatures, and that’s the way the Fairy Elders wanted to keep it.
“All I’m saying is that it’s been
Now, Steve was beginning to realise even
She was ex-military, like Bucky and Sam, so he hoped so.
Tony smiled, but for a moment it was sad. “Yeah, we… we were pretty stupid about everything, huh?”
Peter rolled his eyes and shifted in his seat, resting his head against the bus window. “This is my
“Yes, please,” the seven year old replied, fiddling with a Black Widow action figure on Tony’s other side.
“I promised my Ma I wouldn’t get suspended again,” Steve grumbled, jabbing a bony elbow into Bucky’s side when he snorted out a laugh. “Shut up, jerk.”
“What’s wrong? Is it Peter –?” his Dad started, all before turning and realising that Peter was awake.
A huge bar spread down the left side of the room, deep mahogany in colour and with a black marble finished surface on top. They were stocked with booze up to the eyeballs, it all on show in racks behind the bar. At the other side of the room tables were set out with chairs tucked neatly under them. The empty ones, anyway, which there weren’t a whole lot of – the place was pretty much packed solid.
It hadn’t been difficult to find Baxter’s house. All employees’ places of residence were on company file, so all Tony had had to do was ask JARVIS. Once they’d gathered the information, they’d slipped out of the party to go to the store, where they’d grabbed as many rolls of toilet paper and cartons of eggs as they could carry, and had then headed over.
Because towards the end of the movie, as Buddy was helping Santa fix his sleigh, little Petey got his second wind. Steve had actually thought he was asleep, but then he suddenly sat up and silently toddled over to the floor-to-ceiling windows across the room, taking his Iron Man figure with him, and sat down.
Rhodey shrugged. “I dunno. I think we gotta wait until the opening rush calms down, see how many people actually go back for a second go.”
“Sure,” Tony nodded.
Damn.
“Went as a werewolf last year,” Peter shook his head. “Can’t do the same thing two years in a row, Daddy!”
Wandering over to the wardrobe he and Natasha shared, he opened it and quickly located his tie rack at the very end. He took just a moment to debate over which one to choose, before pulling a deep crimson one out. It matched well with his charcoal grey jacket and slacks, so he popped his white collar up and quickly tied it around his neck, before smoothing the whole outfit out. He bounced across the room to inspect himself in Natasha’s dresser mirror beside her.
His mind was a lot clearer when he next woke up. He took a moment before opening his eyes to just take in his surroundings via touch and hearing. There was a soft, thin blanket over his body, and the way it felt told him he was naked underneath it. Warning bells went off in his head and his eyes snapped open; his helmet was still firmly in place, though it appeared to be broken.
“Oh, honey,” Pepper murmured, running a reassuring hand through Peter’s wavy hair. “Tell us what’s wrong. Nobody will get mad, okay? We just need to understand.”
And then Tony passed out in his arms.
“Dad,
And then, as if on cue, Rhodey called from inside the apartment, “Tony? We’re gonna need to buy you an entertainment system or something to put this TV on, because it’s currently on the floor.”
“Oh, really?” Steve replied, a little confused. “It looked pretty good to me.”
It was all he needed to double down, to focus all his remaining energy on turning the stones inwards, on destroying them with their own power. He knew exactly the moment he had done it, because something broke in his mind and everything started to fall apart.
“You fly down there, you’re not coming back out again,” Tony cut her off. He had a strange expression on his face again as he turned to Steve. “Steve –“
“If we can find Thanos and take the gauntlet, he’s immediately weakened, right?” Bruce continued. “He’s not as much of a threat. We use that window to use the Time Stone and stop him from ever finding the stones in the first place.”
, he told himself.
me to -”
me to be quiet.”
“Nooooo!” the kids all squealed at once, looking collectively horrified.
Taking a deep breath, he asked, “Wanna play a game with me?” and watched as Steve sat up a little straighter, intrigued. “We each have to say five things we like about each other, and one thing we need to improve on. Might break the ice?”
“Pretty much,” Buck nodded. “He’s an idiot.”
“The mechanic’s gun, Captain?” Thor cackled as he zoomed past them, and Steve just rolled his eyes.
And then, with nothing more than another grin, Flash wandered off to the bullies’ table at the other side of the cafeteria.
He hadn’t had to climb any walls yet – that he did know. Was that a bad thing? He had thought Clint was kidding, but now, lost like he was, he was starting to think otherwise -
He tried to ignore the worried glance Pepper and Rhodey shared.
“You know he probably only likes you because of that, right?” Peter replied, probably both a little too quickly and bitterly.
“Mmmm, then imagine how turned on you’ll be when I tell you I have to go change the kids out of their gross cereal pyjamas and make them presentable,” Tony replied, going back for another kiss. “You need me to help you with the dishes first?”
“Where’s the Quantum machine?” he asked, and felt Bruce and Tony bristle with excitement. They could read him, and they knew his question meant he agreed with them.  “How do we play this?”
“Y’know, Pete,” his Dad started quietly, and then cleared his throat. “You could maybe try a little harder to make some friends, kiddo –“
Sat at at table, halfway through his breakfast, Rhodey just rolled his eyes. “She would not. Your Mom had more of a sense of humour than you do.”
“You’re stuck in war mode,” Natasha murmured from the doorway, startling him momentarily. “Don’t deny it.”
“A very rare thing,” he informed them, as though the didn’t already know. “Precious.”
“You won’t believe the things we saw,” a woman – Natasha, Tony assumed – added, patting Rogers’ shoulder as he pulled away from Bucky.
dropping this,” Bucky called from his other side, rolling his eyes as Pietro sped past them dangerously quickly, whooping happily. That kid was a speed freak. “Why didn’t you tell us?”
He was a complete mess. Steve couldn’t begin to imagine what must have happened up in space, but Tony looked like he had taken a thorough beating and was barely hanging on.
“I’m fairly certain we can handle it,” Tony deadpanned.
Rogers Mansion, and the proprietor thereof, Mr. Steven G. Rogers, had a reputation for being… a little out there. With his mansion set miles upstate of New York, Tony’s accountancy firm generally didn’t hear from the estate at all for months and months on end, because God knew Rogers had enough money to literally do whatever he wanted with it, but every once in a while one of them would be summoned. Usually, Pepper or Rhodey came (Tony tended to deal with clients of the young, blond and female variety), but both of them were otherwise occupied with business this time, so the responsibility had fallen to him.
a number of things we
“I was too late,” Peter shook his head ruefully. “You’d already got my location before I took it out.”
The gang knew that Steve was seeing someone, but they didn’t know it was another man, and they certainly didn’t know it was Tony. He tried to keep his work and private life as separate as he could to protect each party.
“I cannot believe this has happened,” Tony shook his head. “I
“Aaaand you ruined it,” Tony grumbled, and Steve pulled away laughing. “I am not breathtaking, Steven, I am a wanton sex god.”
if it weren’t for you.”
They were meeting them at some fancy, upscale restaurant that Natasha had booked out a full portion of so they wouldn’t be disturbed or asked weird questions when supposedly only two people were sat at a four person table, or why they were ordering for four. The waitstaff would probably guess, else think Bucky and Natasha were just extra hungry, and Tony was fine with that either way.
“Sir, if you could just calm down,” he placated, holding his hands up defensively. “I just… I need to understand why you need this in the first place. Your letter makes it out as a dare, but there aren’t any neighbours for hundreds of miles around here, and it’s really not a sound investment -”
“We’re actually really proud of him,” Steve hummed gently, watching George with interest. “When Natasha first brought him back from the rainforest, we weren’t certain he was going to make it. He had been abandoned by his mother too early, and he was so tiny – barely bigger than a fingernail. He couldn’t change colours, and we were scared for him, but he seems to be doing pretty well now, huh?”
Peter took a deep breath and glanced at his Dad, who at least looked a little concerned. Then, shaking his head, he replied, “I’m fine. Just regular school stuff – it’s no biggie.”
you –?“
Because he got crammed into a locker, Peter didn’t see Tony in the hall during the changeover between morning classes. He did, however, find the baseball hat he had thought he’d lost behind a stack of books he hadn’t moved in almost a month, so at least there was that.
“He’s Baxter’s kid, that gross, racist board member I told you about,” Tony told Steve. “Remember, the one who kept touching Pepper’s butt?”
Natasha texted back.
Steve took a deep breath, and then, without really thinking too hard about what was about to happen, he slid the gauntlet onto his arm.
blame me for this! I wanted everyone safe, not in more danger!”
But he couldn’t help but also think that yes, Tony
“Dork,” Rhodey rolled his eyes, though he pulled Tony in for a quick, one armed hug. “Okay, more boxes?”
“Yep,” Steve agreed, springing to his feet.
“Good eye,” Tony praised with a grin, glancing behind them to confirm the earpiece. “I swear, the things you pick up, you could be a spy or some shit.”
Tony came to a stop mid sentence, realising that both Pepper and Rhodey were looking at him with raised eyebrows and matching smirks. He cleared his throat, trying not to think too much about the fact that those words seemed to have just come out of him without his conscious decision, and took a gulp of his beer to distract them both from the fact that his face was heating up a little.
“I’m Natasha,” she smiled.
There weren’t a lot of boxes left in the hall when they made it back out there. Tony actually didn’t own a lot of stuff; at least 50% of the boxes were filled up with scraps of metal and a couple of tool boxes, because he liked to tinker in his spare time. Other than that, he had his laptop, TV, a box of pots, pans and cutlery for the kitchen, and some clothes, and that was pretty much it.
while I help Peter with potty and teeth time?”
They only had to circle the stretch of street outside the clubhouse for a few moments before HYDRA members came pouring out. They looked startled for a moment, as though they hadn’t expected Steve to come after them, but then they started yelling and laughing, passing guns and things to throw out of the door.
How wrong Steve had been.
“I’m not a baby!” Lily cried from behind them, and with a final kiss against the nape of Steve’s neck, Tony pulled away from him to go greet his other children.
And he really was.
“Give me the stones.”
True to his word, Cap came back around twenty minutes later with a pile of clothes and an ancient looking cellphone. Tony had to hold in the urge to tut at it and promise him a state of the art Stark Phone, because he had managed to nearly roast alive and not have his secret identity revealed; he wasn’t about to do it himself by letting something stupid slip out.
“While you were stuck in the Quantum Realm, Earth was attacked,” Steve explained with a heavy sigh. “The whole universe was. A being called Thanos collected six powerful gems and used them to eviscerate half of all living things. He called it mercy, but…”
Tony spent most of the day going over some manuscripts with Natasha (boring), and cruising the cafeteria for some action. He had the ability to change the perception of people around him, meaning he wasn’t quite invisible, but… easily forgettable to all but Natasha. And, unlike all the other rules that he tended to skip over, this was one he simply couldn’t. He had been trained from birth to camouflage himself, to keep his business out of plain sight; more than that, he was bound by fairy law to keep their existence in the shadows. Of course, people
beaten up?”
“That’s okay,” Tony replied with a shy smile.
“Wait,” Tony shook his head. “Steve gets his dick out in public and
“Well, I certainly have the room,” Rogers replied, smile still in place.
Steve was proud of their club house. It wasn’t particularly glamorous, of course, but they had a bar (plus bartender in Bruce), an assortment of chairs and tables, and even a pool table that Bucky had shown up with one day, lips tightly sealed on where he’d actually gotten it. It wasn’t much, but it was like a second home to Steve.
“I can work with that,” Tony replied, slipping into his own seat. “My people are born pansexual. All about the brain and heart, not the junk, that’s us. Plus, y’know, why limit yourself? So many pretty people out there -”
“Great,” Tony beamed, and then snatched up Steve’s hand and tugged him forwards. “Come on, how many times do you actually get to be on stage?”
, but he was the most handsome guy Tony had ever seen in his whole life.
crap.
Steve felt a little dazed as he was tugged up onto the stage, and even more so when Tony reeled him in and held him close. His breath caught in his throat, feeling Tony settle, pressed against his body. They stayed like that for a few, loaded moments, Tony staring down at him with a strange, intense expression on his face.
“Ew,” Flash grimaced, and then patted Tony on the back. “Well, when you get bored of him, and you will, we have a spare seat at our table for you. Thanks for letting me copy your pop quiz, by the way.”
Steve baulked, taken aback by his own words, and felt a blush rising on his cheeks. “I didn’t – that’s not what I said -”
But apparently not.
“Exactly,” Steve hummed, finishing the last of his breakfast. “There’s no stability. You don’t wanna live like that, mooching off Ma for the rest of your life. You could have your own place – somewhere in the city.”
“J, buddy, hi,” he greeted, watching as Cap left the room again.
“Nah, we’re good,” Tony waved her apology away as she let him into the apartment first. “You were right; I wasn’t pulling my weight. It’s all in the past now, though, baby. We’re not the same people we were back then -”
“Don’t you think it’s way past your bedtime, young man?” Steve asked, surprised, as he walked back into the lounge after his evening shower.
“I’m not gonna ruin this for you,” Tony replied quietly, letting Natasha rub her lipstick mark off his cheek. “I might be a dick, though. That’s just part of the package -”
,” Tony insisted, already taking a step towards the pit. “Come on –“
“I’m gonna go get Bruce,” Rhodey murmured, pointedly not looking at Tony’s gaunt face. “See if there’s anything he can do.”
“Well, I dunno, I mean, I got to ride on the back of Natasha’s bike, wrap my arms around her and get real close,” Clint began, and Steve chuckled lightly.
“I… really?” Lang asked. “A lot of stuff has been going on, and I… well, when I got back I came straight here. What’s…
Since the news had broken, they had barely managed to get Peter out of their room. When he wasn't at school, eating, or doing his homework, he was sat by Tony's sock drawer, usually talking to the eggs about what a wonderful time they were all going to have together once they had hatched.
“Well, is it?” she asked again, unashamed. “We used to be able to hear you two going at it like rabbits on the tour bus. Is the spark still there?”
“You must be Mister Stark,” the man hummed, drawing Tony’s attention back to him. “Clint mentioned you had arrived. I’m Mister Rogers.”
Tony glanced down at the seat, heart hammering a little faster, and then let out a somewhat hysterical laugh. “You named a chair George?”
He wasn’t bitter. He wasn’t. Why would he want to be a part of the nerd gang? Rules, regulations, government intervention? Ha, not for him, no sir. He didn’t need any more friends, either – he had Rhodey and Pepper, and JARVIS, too. He had more friends than a guy knew what to do with.
“The news tells people I terrorise people,” Tony replied with a shake of his head. “My beef isn’t with the American people. I only ever wanted to make amends, I -”
“Yes,” Steve sighed. “I was, um, I was thinking a reunion show. I know it’s a lot for me to ask of Bruce, because he’s front man now – it’s
“You’re a traitor,” Tony announced as he walked into the staff room that morning. “My mother’s probably turning in her grave.”
Tony Stark, who was only doing the damn musical because theatre girls were the only remaining clique he hadn’t screwed his way through yet; Tony Stark, who was unfairly talented for someone who was also so smart and popular; Tony Stark, who
“Take mine,” Wanda replied evenly, already rolling up her sleeve. “Take it, heal him.”
He was just thinking about exploring upstairs, maybe taking a nap before he came up with the next part of his plan, when a terrifyingly loud bang came from out in the hall. Peter’s immediate thought was
“There’s Bruce and Betty, too,” Rogers went on, almost as an afterthought, “though they tend to keep to the labs. They’re scientists.”
“But I like this one, as well,” Peter huffed with his bottom lip sticking out, tugging on a Buzz Lightyear costume hung up above him. “And I like the Papa one, too. But then there’s the clown one –“
“I hope so,” Tony frowned, finishing up the last of his breakfast. “I guess I’ll just have to snuggle the jitters out of her.”
Tony grinned and looked back in the mirror at himself. Natasha had been right - the hanky offered a little pop of colour that completed the outfit nicely. He looked pretty damn smart.
yourself sick if you cram it in like that. Don’t force it.”
“You don’t kill people,” Cap murmured firmly a moment later, as Tony was trying to haul himself to his feet, and that sentence was so unexpected that he slipped a little bit and wobbled in shock.
“Uh, yeah,” Tony managed intelligently.
Peter didn’t really know what was going on. One minute he had been helping the Avengers take down some kind of Voodoo Witch who had been tearing things up in Midtown, and the next his family had turned on him.
It seemed quieter now, and when he pushed Steve’s door open, he realised it was because the gaggle of girls had disappeared, probably off to someone else’s dressing room - except for one, who was making out with Steve
In return, Tony held out his other hand and Steve drew back as Rhodes went into his arms willingly. They embraced like long-lost brothers, and Steve had to swallow back a surge of sudden, unexpected jealously that crept up his throat. Where had
Peter... had been excited by the thought at first, but now he was really starting to regret agreeing to this so readily.
“Sure,” he forced out a smile, more than aware that it probably looked closer to a grimace. “We can do that. You… crazy kids have a nice night.”
“I don’t know,” Steve sighed, heart feeling heavy in his chest. “He’s always back by morning, and he… he
“Yes,” Rogers nodded. “He owns Frigga, who you also met.”
And then Doctor Strange was there.
“Okay,” Steve nodded, and smiled sadly when Tony looked up at him with surprise. “I don’t always disagree with you, you know.”
“We go back and destroy the stones before he can get to them,” Carol nodded. “Everyone’s saved, and it’s like none of it ever happened.”
“Okay,” Lang rang his hands and glanced around the conference room for a moment, as though he was trying to figure out where to begin. “Okay, so… I’ve been travelling in time.”
“I –“
in the chair opposite Tony. “I am the owner and manager of this place, after all.”
“Fury…” Steve didn’t really know where to start. “Fury’s gone. So is Hill, and most of his team.”
“Nope, nuh-uh,” Tony shook his head, already grabbing another couple of toilet roll tubes from the coffee table. “Can’t do both, kid. There’s no way I’m letting silver paint near that thing now it’s finally dried.”
“It’s not a dive bar.”
“I was thinking,” Tony replied, swallowing his bite, “that we get ourselves spruced up a little bit, maybe have a couple drinks at home so I’m at least a little buzzed before we go out -”
“Tony, are… are you upset because a bunch of teenagers don’t think you’re cool?” Steve asked gently, and Tony’s pouty bottom lip told him all he needed to know. Sighing heavily, he took the guitar from Tony’s hands and pulled him into a hug. “Honey, you’ve never been a cool human being – not back then, and definitely not now.”
“Peter wants to take your name, too,” Steve told Tony nonchalantly as he started to lead Peter forwards, and grinned when he got a bit of shocked resistance, obviously on Tony’s part. “Just thought I’d let you know, honey.”
Rhodey glanced at Steve for a moment, which in turn caused Tony to turn his head to him. But Steve didn’t know what to say. He knew what it was like to wake up after thinking you were dead to find out the people you loved were dead instead, and he didn’t wish it on anyone. Rhodey seemed to realise he wasn’t going to get any help, because when Tony turned back to him, all he could do was shake his head sadly.
The Red Skull, leader of the gang and aptly named because of the huge red skull tattoo covering his whole face, came to a stop right in front of them, and only then did Steve realise, with a sickening jolt, that there was someone tied up on the back of his bike.
“As I’ll ever be,” Tony grinned, and then settled down as the doors opened in front of them and their friends quickly paired up to head on in. Within a few moments, the hall had emptied and they were the only ones remaining.
as the third longest single to stay at number one. Hell, they’d beaten out Queen’s
“My gauntlet!” he screamed as soon as he spotted Steve, and surged towards him.
In the meantime, Steve and the others were thinking tactically. They didn’t know how to destroy the Infinity Stones, but if they could collect them all and somehow use them to defeat Thanos first, then they’d have time to figure out how to destroy them afterwards. Steve planned their route, starting on Earth and then branching out further and further into space. The concept was terrifying, and he didn’t know how Tony had done it and kept his mind, but what kept him going was the thought that they were going to get everyone who had disappeared back. They were going to save them all.
he signed as he sat down opposite Clint at the table, placing the hearing aid between them. Clint, at least, had the decency to look a little ashamed.
“I want this for the rest of my life,” Tony hummed, nodding his head a little. “So sure, I’ll marry you.”
“Are they... are they eating eggs, or baby eggs?” Peter asked. They'd tried to explain to him how eggs worked, but he still couldn't quite wrap his little mind around it yet; he was convinced that there were two separate kinds of eggs – those for eating, and those with babies inside.
“I have nothing to say to you,” Tony told him insistently, attempting to step past Steve.
– shook his head. “I’m in two minds to walk back outta this door and leave you both to it –“
Despite desperately trying to force it down, Steve felt a blush forming on his face as Tony bounded away. He hated that he got like this – it really didn’t mean anything, after all. Tony flirted with
“And when we get home, we go right back to how everything was before,” Steve added. “The only thing that changes is that me and Daddy will wear a wedding ring, and we’ll have the same last names.”
Without further ado, he tore a bag open and offered it to Peter, who reached in and pulled out a bite-size candy bar with a big grin on his face. Then, while Peter toddled off to eat in peace, Tony poured the rest of the bag into a plastic pumpkin and reached for another bag to do the same.
“For him,” she agreed.
The Reality stone was a little more difficult, as The Collector who was keeping it wasn’t at all happy about parting with it. After Carol transferred what Steve assumed was an atrocious amount of money into the Collector’s account, however, he seemed to loosen up a little bit and handed the stone over.
Crap.
“Douchebag,” Strange muttered under his breath, but he was already ascending the stairs. “Wait here – I’ll go get the stone.
“The problem is,” he mumbled, cramming some noodles into his mouth, “is that being bombarded with his dick is actually the perfect way to start my morning.”
“We’ve got to stop meeting like this,” was out of Tony’s mouth before he could stop himself, and then he had to keep from smacking himself in the faceplate.
They had the same problem with Peter every year. Halloween was his favourite holiday, and, being Steve’s son, he always went overly melodramatic for the occasion and wanted the best
“I don’t want to,” Peter replied firmly, and then turned back to his work. “It’s not like we have to be glued at the hip.”
“He’s
And Tony Stark was ruining it.
with them.”
Peter growled, annoyed, because he had worked
“Is this… is this better?” Tony asked quietly, ducking his head a little to lean in.
Now, Lily, their daughter, was seventeen, and Peter was fifteen. They were the lights of both Steve and Tony’s lives, and Steve knew that Tony didn’t regret quitting when they had. He
Tony, Bruce, Carol and Lang formed their own science division. Carol had a startling knowledge of space, and – aided by Rocket – they managed to make a map of where all the Infinity Stones had been hidden. From there, they researched and field tested the Quantum machine until they’d successfully managed to jump through time to within a second of when and where they wanted to be.
“You wanna stay at my place tonight? It’s closer,” Bucky murmured to Natasha as they were paying the bill, and Tony felt his heart leap into his throat.
“You called me your boyfriend,” Steve continued earnestly, “and I love being your boyfriend, but… I want to be your husband, Tony. It’s been five years – neither of us is going anywhere, so –“
“Oh, that’s fine,” Tony waved away his concern. Honestly, he had been more worried about them trying to steal the design. “I need to take a look at the cooling systems anyway – I’ll just make a new one.”
“Why didn’t you do it?” Peter asked, exasperated. “We had a full week!”
Seeing everyone (or everyone they had left) suited up made Steve feel better than he had in a very long time. It reminded him of who they had lost, certainly, but it also showed him how strong they still were, what a great team they still had.
Steve blushed as he perched himself on the other end of the couch, and it was a beautiful sight to behold. Tony lamented, just for a second, that it was a shame the guy’s personality wasn’t as nice as his body, but he knew that was probably a little too much to ask for. They sat in silence for a few moments, just sipping their beers, and Tony felt a sense of awkwardness coming on.
“Well, the clubhouse needs fixing up a little,” Steve hummed around a mouthful of eggs. “A couple of kids broke some windows. Then me and the guys are gonna transport some stuff over to the toy drive at the rec. center later.”
, as he was now supposed to exclusively call him – sighed and rolled his eyes into the back of his head. He’d been on a mission with the Avengers when he’d been hit with some kind of magic beam that’d deaged him to around sixteen years old. Not really knowing what else to do with him, because he obviously couldn’t carry on as an Avenger, and nobody trusted him to stay at home by himself even when he was an
“I don’t doubt it,” Tony hummed, because James was already starting to overtake Peter in height, and there was half a year between them. “And then, when you’re big and strong, you’ll be able to carry me around like I’m carrying you, huh?”
“Tony,” Steve laughed from behind him, and Tony threw a grin over his shoulder. “Don’t put ideas in their heads. You know full well they all want Iron Man to make a visit anyway.”
“Cheatin’,” the little girl replied, tugging absentmindedly at her tutu. Tony was pretty sure belonged to one of his board members. “He’s usin’ his hands.”
“I… I don’t,” Tony agreed quietly.
mumbled. “You seem to do something different everyday.”
, Dad. Way to be supportive.”
“But anyway,” Natasha cleared her throat, bringing Steve back to the present. “His party.”
“P – Pepper?” Tony asked, voice like gravel as Rhodey pulled away again.
When the snap happened, Steve realised that he really hadn’t understood the true magnitude of everything that had been lost. The following days acted as a tally, on which he kept adding the names of friends, of colleagues, of politicians, of… of everyone they had lost. Everyone
“I’m not Captain America,” Steve replied quietly, and the other side of the phone went silent. “Not anymore.”
“It’s just so easy,” Tony replied. “And the situation kind of calls for it. I wake up naked and alone in a strange room – if I don’t joke, I might cry.”
“You're ridiculous,” Steve smiled fondly, and Tony felt his heart beating quicker in his chest at the sight. “What are we going to do with them?”
“Great, thanks,” Steve nodded. “Okay, so that just leaves the toy drive later. Did everyone pick up the toys ready for -”
Bouncing from foot to foot like a little boy, Tony let out an excited squeak and grabbed a microphone from a table. Leaning up for one last kiss, he bounded out onto stage, to immediate, ear-splitting screams.
They were all there – the Avengers, the Guardians, Strange, Wakandans. Everyone that could possibly help was there, standing together in their uniforms.
“No,” James guffawed as they stepped into the elevator, and Tony gasped melodramatically.
“First I can’t mention Steve. Now I can’t talk to people. Am I allowed to do
“Come on,” Tony hummed, gently curling his fingers around the nape of Steve’s neck to soothe him. “Come on, Clint’s gonna be fine. I’m… I’m sorry I yelled at you.”
“No, no way –“
He had to duck to avoid the first bullet, and thought in passing that he was going to have to ask Tony to develop some kind of shield for the front of his bike in the future. Bucky zipped past him, gun in hand, and started shooting at the wheels of HYDRA’s bikes. Realising what he was trying to do, Steve yelled, “Shoot their tyres! Make sure they can’t follow us!”
“I do
“There’s blood on your neck,” Rhodey hummed, as though it were the most normal thing in the world. “And… all over your face.”
“Is the radiation dangerous?” Tony asked quickly.
Peter sniffled some more, bottom lip sticking right out around his pacifier as he raised his little head, but ultimately nodded his head and raised his arms for Steve to pick him up. Never passing up a chance to carry his boy, Steve scooped him up and cradled him to his chest.
“Did you know it’s cool to hate us now?” Tony snapped, and then sighed. “It’s a craze, apparently. Only
Natasha’s returning smile almost stopped his heart.
, but… but they were alive. Alive was enough. As long as they were alive, they could fight.
Tony grimaced. He knew exactly who that kid belonged to.
“Tony?” he asked quietly, wrapping his arms around his middle. It was chilly in the autumn air.
“Look, okay, I know he’s a weirdo,” Buck waved a hand to shut Tony up. “He gets panicky and makes bad life choices when he likes someone – it’s a thing, we’re working on it – but, honestly, that’s just the kind of dork he is, and it can come off a little creepy, but he’s a good guy and he deserves someone who’ll treat him with the love and respect he deserves.
“He’s gonna be fine,” Steve told her, and didn’t know who he was trying to convince. “He’s gonna be fine.”
“Okay, my name’s Sam, I’ll be your waiter today,” the guy told him as he sat down, handing him a menu. “Can I get you a drink to start you off?”
Still living with his mother and adopted younger brother, Clint, in their tiny Brooklyn house at the age of twenty five hadn’t exactly been what Steve had envisioned for himself when he was younger. Factoring Tony into the mix just made things all the worse, but he couldn’t go home to his abusive family, and he earned a decent amount fixing up cars, sure, but not enough to buy a place of their own in New York. Tony had nowhere else to go, basically, and Steve’s Ma had always been a sucker for a stray – Clint was evidence enough of that. It just meant that things were a little tight, four of them living in her tiny house.
He was lost. He was definitely, without a doubt, one hundred percent lost, and he was also probably going to die in in this creepy old mansion without anyone having realised he was even there, because it had gotten to the point already where he was questioning whether Clint and Jane had actually been real people.
? It didn’t make any sense.
“What’s with the guitar?” Steve asked gently, drawing attention back to it. “You were always more of a piano guy.”
“The day you get an A in Math is the day I let you come to work with me,” Steve replied with a raised eyebrow, and grinned when Clint scowled at him. “Come on, Clint, we both know you’re smart enough to get into college. You wanna be doing crappy odds and ends jobs like me for the rest of your life?”
“The same reason I haven’t told my family what I do with you guys,” Steve replied. “The same reason I carry a gun down the back of my pants.”
He researched for a little while, shooting emails off to lawyer friends as well as Pepper and Rhodey, respectfully, and got a couple of interesting replies. While he was doing this and trawling the internet – good job he’d brought his portable USB connection – Rogers paced up and down the room, twirling an American flag painted frisbee between his hands as he went. He was very well built – had Tony mentioned that? The seams of his upper sleeves stretched taught over his bulging biceps, and his broad shoulders tapered down to a trim, tiny waist that even women would die for.
“Then expect a flaming bag of dog shit on your doorstep tomorrow,” Steve replied with a grin of his own, gesturing for Sam to bring Tony’s food over. It was a burger. “I’m throwing the gauntlet down.”
“Punk,” Bucky replied, prodding Steve with his spoon. “Need
since we got laid,” Tony whined, holding securely onto Natasha’s hair as he perched lightly on her shoulder. “The whole point of me being your fairy godmother or whatever is that I help you get laid.”
“So, he hummed,” trying not to show how heavy his heart felt in his chest. “It’s your birthday in a few days.”
” Pepper replied quietly. “
“Hang on, I have something for you,” Natasha murmured, finishing up with some red lipstick. Leaning across him, she caught up a slip of patterned yellow material and then folded it neatly to tuck into his breast pocket. “There. Much better.”
“And…” he continued, “turns out that I’m not great at it and I don’t totally know how it works, because I ended up in 1985, and then the future, and then I’m pretty sure I saw a dinosaur, and then –“
, they were really good. He tried not to let it show on his face, but the look on
“He came out in a
“Um…” Tony cleared his throat. “I – okay. I can do that.”
“They’re VIPS and competition winners,” he called over the noise, and Tony laughed, patting Steve on the back.
The bastards
“I don’t really think she’s sick,” Steve hummed. “I think she’s nervous about starting the second grade next week, and it’s starting to show.”
This was their chance, though. If they told him they were eating eggs, they'd be able to get rid of them without much of a fuss. It was the right thing to do, after all – they really couldn't take care of five more ducklings. They'd barely managed to raise Jemima.
“Um, you could get beaten up?” Peter replied immediately, surging to his feet after Tony as he got off the bus. “You could get
“I know,” Tony sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger for a moment. “I know, okay, and I know there’s nothing we can do about it, but… but sometimes I just wish we were young again, newly married,
In that moment, Steve realised what he meant to do.
, and they were only too happy to help once she explained to them what was at stake.
And just like that, everything, for the moment, was forgiven.
Possibly the most annoying part of Steve’s whole situation was the fact that Tony was just so damn
“With that in mind,” Buck sighed, “you think maybe you could have told him you were seeing someone before he got his dick out in the hall?”
“Ever since that fight a few weeks ago,” Cap shrugged, “the one where I hit you in the face with my shield -”
“You, uh, you saved my life,” Cap cleared his throat again, reaching up to scratch the back of his head earnestly. “When Stane fired the rocket launcher, you pulled me under you. I would have melted alive if you hadn’t.”
“Well, since you asked so nicely, I suppose I can allow it just this once,” Steve hummed, and then smiled when Peter grinned and turned back to his movie. “Have you had your supper?”
“That is such a dad thing to say,” Peter rolled his eyes. “Did you not hear him call me a nerd? Or do you just not care?”
He didn’t start to worry until lunchtime rolled around, however. He’d texted Tony during class directing him to Peter’s usual table (
It was a nice smile, Tony decided.
Tony waited in silence with bated breath, for once in his life not really sure what to say or do. Then, after a pregnant pause, another voice replied, muffled, from somewhere nearby, “Goddamn it, woman, not again! I just showered!”
When Steve got his first look at Tony in the entrance of the church, he knew they’d made the right decision. While Steve’s tux was a dark, navy blue, Tony’s suit was a charcoal grey. He’d opted for a neck tie rather than a bowtie, but that was fine by Steve; he looked wonderful. Even Peter, who was thankfully now in his own suit and clutching Tony’s hand, seemed in a much better mood.
He really did have to fix the clubhouse’s windows, but it hadn’t been kids; HYDRA, a group of neo-Nazis that paraded around as a rival biker gang, had been looking for trouble. Luckily they had disappeared before Steve and his gang had been able to find them, but it wasn’t the first time they’d gotten into turf wars. Tony, at least, knew the truth, because he’d had to pick Steve up from the hospital more than once after a fight.
They were all just stood there as though they had glitched and were rebooting. Peter managed to focus his attention long enough to watch first his Pops, then his Dad, then the rest of his family slowly come around. One by one they shook their heads as though clearing the last of the brainwashing from their systems. Peter forced himself to hold on just long enough to catch his Dad’s eye and see the horror – real, genuine horror – spread across his face.
“All right, well, I gotta get to work,” Rhodey continued, slinging an easy arm around Tony’s shoulders. “You want a ride?”
“No, Pepper, it’s fine,” Tony sighed. “It’s all good, okay? They don’t know who I am. They patched me up on the sly, okay, and they didn’t take my helmet off. Everything’s good.”
“HYDRA paid us a visit,” Steve replied, following Tony into the garage as the others wheeled what was left of their bikes inside. “They… Tony, they have Clint.”
“Adorable,” Steve murmured as they pulled away again, and then, to Peter, asked, “Did you say thank you to Daddy for helping you, Pete?”
“Where’d you want these boxes, Tones?” Rhodey huffed, carrying a set of stacked boxes through the door of Tony’s new apartment. “Do they say kitchen or bedroom? I can’t see from this angle –“
“I see,” Steve grinned, and Tony found himself charmed by the sight. “So, let me ask you a question. Are you just here for dinner, or do you have an ulterior motive?”
It was true. There was an ash tray sat on the table, a lit cigarette perched inside with the remains of many others inside. Beside it, there was a packet of tobacco sleeves, and on top of that -
“He’s the reason we have the soul stone,” Carol told her, holding up the bag of stones. “It’s his soul.”
He paused.
“That’s, mmm,” Steve momentarily got distracted by Tony’s lips again. “That’s the cheesiest line I’ve ever heard.”
“I say…” Tony took a deep breath, and let it out with a cheeky grin, “that I knew I married you for a reason.”
insisted the government official on the other side of the phone.
“Shit,” he hissed, batting the tears away from his eyes as though he were ashamed of them. “Shit, Peter, my Petey, my baby –“
“Shh,” Bucky hissed, momentarily distracted, and then couldn’t help but smile as he came up in front of the red haired beauty. She looked at him with a coy smile in return, and he was momentarily dumbstruck, barely managing to croak out a lame, “Hi.”
“Tony –“
“But it was a smart move,” his Pops told him. “A brave move. It can’t have… have felt good.”
“Do my gifts mean nothing to you?” Tony asked mildly as Steve stepped out of the truck, watching the others as they helped get the bikes down. “Three bikes I’ve made for you, and every one’s been sent back in pieces -”
Steve, he was a little embarrassed to admit, was his best friend. The guy took his work very seriously, sure, but he was good for a joke, too. Bucky had never met anyone as fiercely sarcastic or sassy before, and he loved Steve for it. He encouraged Bucky to quit his job at the building site, because it really wasn’t making him happy, and start afresh with something new. Now, he was only working in a bar, but it meant that he got to meet tonnes of new people every night and have a good time on the job; the money wasn’t bad, either. It was the start of the change that he had been craving for so long, and it felt great.
like the whole place was going to crumble -
But clearly Uncle Thor was in more of a chocolate mood, because his hand shot out with a speed that really shouldn’t have been possible for a man his size and grabbed Peter’s arm –
“Yeah, and knock before you just barge in this time -”
“And you don’t know where he’s going?” Natasha asked, brow furrowed in concern. “He’s never cheated on you before – why start now?”
“Tony, don’t tell me you’re getting self conscious in your old age,” Steve hummed, and laughed aloud when Tony rolled his eyes and took the guitar from him.
Tony thought back to the explosion he had heard earlier, and realised it suddenly made a little more sense. Horrible, terrifying sense.
“Just because you’re the cutest guy in school doesn’t make singing and dancing any more fun, Steve,” Tony rolled his eyes. “I wouldn’t be here at
Rhodey assessed him for a moment, and then, shaking his head, he sighed and pulled Tony into a one-armed hug. “I know you are, buddy. But if that’s what you want, then you have to talk it out with the guy. He’s a grown man – he’ll understand if you ask him to respect your wishes. And if he doesn’t, send him my way, okay?”
Metal rattled as the gate slid back into place, and Steve could only imagine the imposing image they must have made, stood in a line, ready to attack. Lang looked like he was about to soil himself when he caught a look at them all.
He thought about calling Pepper directly, but decided against it; the number could be traced back to him. He decided to call JARVIS instead.
“No he’s not,” Steve sang, holding up the hearing aid. “He just dropped this.”
And it was just as he was thinking this, sat alone in his apartment one evening, that someone started knocking urgently on his door.
“I’m not saying this place is bad, because I love it here,” he went on, holding his hands up defensively when Tony opened his mouth to ream him out. “You trusted me to manage your baby all those years ago, and I think I’ve done a good job, but I can’t eat your Mom’s meatballs every meal for the rest of my life, okay?”
Peter flinched, but didn’t look up from his work.
“Yeah,” Steve replied, suddenly feeling the need to defend himself. “I’ve been looking through his work to see if… well, to see if there’s anything that might help us track down Thanos.”
back – then together they could come up with some way to save all the people they had lost.
Said friend was watching Tony warily, and with a unappreciative crease between his brow. God, he looked sexy even when he was disapproving.
, but he soon realised, with a sigh of relief, that he was safe. He was safe because his Pops was sat in a chair next to him, and his Dad was curled around him on the bed, and neither of them were trying to kill him.
Steve had been hiding in a motel.
“If I lose a single cent,” Tony huffed, “you better tell me, okay? This is a battle, Pepper, and you need to get your war paint on.”
“I’m not sick!” Lily insisted, picking up her fork and cramming eggs into her mouth. “See? M'fine.”
Tony felt his heart lurch in his chest, confused and hurt on a fundamental level. “What? How? I haven’t –”
“Well, he’s not looking his best right now,” Danvers tried, though the joke fell spectacularly flat.
“Hey, sugarplum, how’s it going?” he called over the crowd, slipping into a space beside Natasha at the bar. She looked considerably drunker than he felt. “Any luck yet?”
Tony didn’t really know what to say.
Tilting his head up towards the floor above, the man called out, quite calmly, “Thor? Frigga has escaped again and is looking for you.”
The rest of his sentence was lost against Steve’s lips as the guy leaned forwards and kissed him. Tony assumed it was meant to just be a peck, but he brought his hands up and cradled Steve’s face in his hands, deepening the kiss further. Steve gasped, but allowed it, and as they tipped backwards to lie on the couch, Tony couldn’t help but grin helplessly.
“James, this is Tony,” she introduced after they had pulled apart. “Tony, this is James.”
“No!” Peter cried, grabbing him by the back of the collar to stop him getting any further away. “Look, just… please don’t cause trouble?
Despite everything, Peter found himself laughing.
Everything was already going to hell when they got outside. Even without the gauntlet, Thanos was incredibly powerful, and even the Hulk didn’t seem to be able to quite get the better of him.
knocking drinks onto the floor after spotting one slimy guy in particular going around dropping something into girls’ glasses.
“Okay, we’re gonna create a diversion,” Steve instructed to everyone, gesturing them in to a tight circle. “We wanna draw them out onto the street, so make as much noise as possible. While we’re doing that, Natasha, I want you to find a way in and get Clint out as quick as possible, okay? Don’t wait for us – as soon as you’ve got him, make a break for it back to Tony’s garage. Text when you’re safe and we’ll rendezvous with you there later, okay?”
They landed back in the Facility. It looked the same, and for a moment Steve was struck dumb by how normal everything was.
“Let’s just hope she doesn’t infect the boys, too, huh?” he hummed, patting Peter’s tummy gently. “The last thing we need is
“There’s a storage unit place nearby,” Sam suggested. “We could rent a unit out, park ‘em in there everyday. It’d mean walking a couple of blocks to get here, but we could all use the exercise.”
“Is there any wonder, the way you wind him up?” Steve replied, though he leaned in for another kiss. “Good morning.”
Steve laughed again. “Of course you are, honey -”
“Right…” Tony nodded, a little bemused. “Okay, I… do you live here full time? Only, I don’t think Rogers put anything about a spouse or girlfriend on his tax forms -”
should go to school with Peter so he could keep an eye on him.
He wasn’t sure how they quite managed it, but somehow the Avengers managed to get Tony out of SHIELD. Seriously, it wasn’t like the Avengers on their own were the most inconspicuous of people – add onto that Tony, dressed in a pair of standard issue blacks and the
today; why Peter had decided that that meant he needed to be as difficult as possible was beyond Steve, but every task had been a chore.
“Just because he needs help doesn’t mean he’s not dangerous,” Steve muttered, but stepped forwards all the same and held his hand out for Lang to shake. “You’re supposed to be a dead man.”
Steve offered a few more of his own goodnights, made sure the kids had made it to their rooms, and then slipped in his room behind Tony.
Steve just snatched him up and kissed him quiet again. Tony couldn’t say he minded all that much.
“Why are you copying my homework if you can work it out faster?” Peter hissed, snapping around to look at him. “Give it back!”
“There’s Clint, obviously, who you’ve already met,” Rogers continued, “and there’s also Thor and Jane -”
“Rogers, makes sense,” Tony nodded, and shook Steve’s hand. Then, rather tactlessly, he dived right in. “So, you opened a dive bar opposite my fancy restaurant and somehow you’re stealing my customers.”
He wrapped his arms around Peter before he even had a chance to process it was happening, which seemed to work in his favour because he didn’t have time to flinch away and ruin it. His Dad’s arms were like coming home, strong and gentle and achingly loving all at the same time. He was warm and smelled like
“I’ll start doing some research,” he said, and then turned back momentarily. “Oh, and… Tony’s waking up.”
“He came to us from a circus,” Rogers murmured, and then smiled when Tony stared at him blankly. “Clint. He ran away from a circus when he was a teenager, ended up wandering through my grounds.”
He struck a shaky chord, and then another. With a reassuring smile from Steve, he seemed to get his confidence in order, because he strummed with more flair. And then he began to hum. There were no words, because Tony really hadn’t ever been a
Again… Tony had never been very good at sticking to the rules.
Steve squeaked, surprised, but immediately pressed back. He felt dizzy with adrenaline and endorphins, but also the smell of Tony’s cologne and how safe he felt in the circle of Tony’s arms.
The arena was packed out. As far as he had been told, nobody had sold this many tickets since the Beatles; The Avengers were officially the voice of a whole generation.
Just like Strange, he seemed to realise why they were there. Steve was glad; he was done with explaining – now was the time for action.
“I want there to be a university that is open for all,” he finished on barely a whisper. “I want all year round housing for people who can’t go home, or who don’t have a home to go to. I want courses that can be taken via Skype, so that people fighting overseas can still get an education for when they get back. I want access for the disabled, both physically and mentally. I want people to be able to learn at their own speed, and not worry about the cost. I want a place where people can be
Another, harder giggle, and then James mumbled, “Papa sez y'gotta come get breakfas’.”
“You have a
“Mine!” Peter called a few moments later, and Steve just huffed out a fond laugh and grabbed two from the box on the counter.
“I didn’t know what to do,” he sobbed against his Dad’s shoulder, and felt his Pops drop down onto the bed behind him. Another pair of arms wrapped around him, and he felt completely safe, completely encompassed by their warmth and support. “I was scared, and I didn’t know what to do, and –“
Steve looked as put out as Tony felt when they all stepped out of the restaurant and onto the sidewalk outside. Tony couldn’t help but feel a little peevish over that - was spending a night with him so unappealing? What was Steve’s problem?
“You can sit down, you know,” he hummed, taking a deep swig of his beer. “I don’t bite, you know. Not unless you want me to.”
“Huh,” Rhodey hummed, peering over Tony’s shoulder. “Looks like he got the message after all?”
The room beyond the archway was vast, more of a second entrance hall than an actual room, with a grand, open staircase leading to a second floor right in the middle of it. Tony wandered across the room slowly, taking in the suits of armour mounted on small plinths and abstract paintings on the walls. He was torn – on the one hand, he could try the stairs and see where that got him, or on the other, there were a few doors leading from this room that he could also try.
“Tony,” Steve tried wearily, reaching a hand out for him, only to have it slapped away.
It made him feel powerful – like he had a purpose. The world was ending, billions were gone, but he could still lead his team.
“Don’t you
“You’re welcome,” Rogers replied with a grin. “Now, I have some business to attend to with Mister Stark, so if you don’t mind -?”
“Peter, honey, I’m glad you like it,” Tony rolled his eyes, “but could you stop trying to pick up candy with your claw for two minutes and come talk to me properly?”
“Uh…” Steve replied intelligently, staring at where their hands were linked as Tony tugged him forwards. “Not very often, I guess.”
thoroughly against a wall.
He wasn’t going to lose anyone else.
” JARVIS told him through his earpiece. “
Steve didn’t know what to tell he. He knew she could see what had happened because her face changed immediately. Everyone was there but Tony, and they all looked as though they had been dragged through hell backwards. All he could do was shake his head to confirm what he knew she must be suspecting, and she nodded her head and swallowed back what looked to be a lot of tears.
It hadn’t been easy. He’d been disowned by his father once he’d told him he didn’t want to take up the family business, that he wanted to sing and play music in his friend’s rock and roll band, so he’d had to figure out how to live by his own means. In the early days, when they were playing a lot of bars and small festival circuits, he’d worked part time as a repair guy. It certainly hadn’t been the most glamorous of lives, and definitely not what he had been used to from childhood, but Tony had great friends, and he was making a go at doing something he truly loved for the first time in… well, ever. He was also a complete hit with the ladies (and gentlemen), so that had been an added bonus.
,” Tony sighed, running both hands through his hair. “Do you think we’re in trouble?”
started.
happy? Most of the time, at least?”
The ride over was completely silent, save for the purr of their bikes’ engines. Now he knew everyone else was safe, Steve was beginning to realise the true nature of what they – of what
Where the others had just stepped through.
could mean a number of things, though. Space was colossal, unforgiving, and Steve – now he had physically heard Tony’s voice – couldn’t bear to imagine him slowly choking to death from lack of oxygen, or starving to death, right outside their atmosphere.
“Right, and you
“Please, for the love of God, do not do that,” Natasha hissed in reply. “What happened to being normal? What -”
. It would have been bad enough if the guy was an asshole – that, Steve was very well versed in – but he really wasn’t. When he bothered to show up for rehearsals, his infectious personality immediately shone through, and he charmed the pants off everyone in attendance; there was really no wonder he had gotten the male lead.
A madman, that was who.
“How so?” Steve asked warily, and bent down to scoop a water bottle up out of his gym bag.
“We don’t have the technology to track the message directly,” Bruce shook his head, “but he has to be close. The suit only has a limited reach, so if it’s picking up the message it means Tony’s got to be nearly home.”
“Bye, Papa!” Peter called, a grin breaking out over his face as Pepper closed the door behind them both.
?” Steve asked, uncomprehending. “What, like a date?”
“One of them is for you,” Peter mumbled, looking down at his feet. All of a sudden, he felt embarrassed, and hated the fact that his father, knowingly or not, had had a part in that.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony nodded, clearing his own throat. “Um, yeah.”
Steve swallowed hard and stared at his hands planted on the table in front of him. It would be dangerous, and – as Bruce said – damn near impossible to pull off, but… but Steve couldn’t think of a better option. It was
“Tony would know what to do.”
“What are you doing up here?” Steve asked instead, very quickly realising this wasn’t some sordid affair, but no closer to actually finding the truth. Tony made an aborted move towards a small side table next to him, and Steve gasped. “You’re
“You’re nasty,” Rhodey groaned, grimacing. “I just… what’s the problem, then? Are you doing that thing where you overthink everything when you could just be getting your mack on –?“
– you’re fuckin’ lazy. All you care about is yourself. It was fine when we were stupid kids, but we’re grown ups now and y'gotta start acting like it.”
“I was gonna do it last night, but then I Skyped Suzie Jenkins instead,” Tony replied, and then momentarily ducked his head as their teacher walked past. “Come on, kiddo.”
The general masses didn’t seem to agree with him, however, because there was a warrant out for Iron Man’s arrest these days. Tony was just glad his identity was secret, because even the
, Peter’s Pops had decided that Da–
And dripping wet.
Tony almost choked on a sip of his beer, realising his slip. “Shut up, you know what I mean.”
Steve’s grin was brighter than the sun, and he stepped aside to let Tony in without question.
“Sure, string bean,” Sam chuckled.
Shit, Tony was in love.
“I still don’t think it’s possible,” he sighed, and then held his hand up when Rogers started to snap again. “But there
Steve had kind of been hoping that he’d be able to wear Tony out enough with sex that he wouldn’t have the energy to sneak off, but it was only an hour and a half after they’d finished, and Steve had fallen into a light doze, that Tony quietly rolled out of bed and shuffled off.
“Good,” Steve smiled. “Now, what would you say to getting high off our asses one last time, for old times sake, and having wild, rooftop sex?”
know what to do. He always knew what to do, whether his plans directly opposed Steve’s or not. There was always something – he always saw things a little differently, a little less black and white than Steve knew he himself was prone to. More often than not, the two of them created something between them that almost always worked.
“No, Daddy,” Peter shook his head vehemently, and Tony despaired. “Don’t wanna be Iron Man. I wanna be a proper robot.”
Tony was still feeling pleasantly buzzed from the half bottle of whiskey he had consumed at home, though he was sure by the end of the night he would be considerably less so. He’d worked out a system whereby he took sips of other people’s drinks while they weren’t looking. He breezed right by them without them noticing, and he only took a few mouthfuls at a time – the drunks at the bar didn’t even notice.
“Yeah, but this isn’t just an Empire, Nat,” Steve shook his head. “This is the whole
“Aw, Cap, you care about us?” Sam grinned as he levelled off with them all.
His head was a mess of pain and confusion when he woke up. His whole body was on fire, tearing him apart from the inside out, and he managed to get a burnt hand up to make sure his helmet was still on, still protecting his identity, before he passed out again.
Later, when Peter looked across the cafeteria at his Dad laughing it up at the popular table with all his new friends, he wondered if gluing himself to his father’s side might not be the worst idea in the world, if it meant he didn’t feel so lonely.
In fact, with them both making a conscious effort not to rile the other up, Steve found that they actually had far more in common than he had initially thought.
“You’re one to talk, Captain Back-Alley Fights,” Tony grumbled, though he didn’t move any further away. Instead, he gestured for Peter to come to him. “C’mere, baby. Show me which one Jimmy is.”
“I dunno,” Tony sighed. “It’s not done yet. You were always better with words, so it’s kinda just melody -”
“But you never even
“Really?” Tony squealed, and then had the decency to look a little embarrassed.
He felt
“We didn’t know what else to do,” Clint murmured out loud, and Steve opened his eyes again. “We tried calling Bruce, but we all kinda just panicked, so we took you to Ma at the surgery and she patched you up.”
“I might just take you up on that offer,” he hummed, and then, with a final smirk, patted the napkin and then walked away without another word.
“What, really?” Tony pouted, heart clenching in his chest. “She seemed excited when I took her back to school shopping last week.”
?” Tony rolled his eyes again.
“We’re going to fix this,” he murmured softly, and then kissed him again. “We’re going to get them back.”
His Pops made a sound like a dying animal, and it was the worst noise Peter had ever heard in his life. Worse still, it seemed to rouse his Dad from his slumber, because he took a big breath and sat bolt upright all in one motion.
Tony laughed. “Oh, really?”
Steve was shaking, full bodied. His hands trembled by his sides and it was all he could do not to ball them into fists. He’d automatically ducked his head as Tony started yelling, trying to make himself smaller, and he knew that they had to make a sight – Tony, tiny, lithe, 5'9 Tony screaming at him – but he couldn’t find the strength to fight back. He had been stupid, and he knew this was his fault, and Tony was just scared, had always been scared that something like this might happen.
He didn’t know a lot about medical equipment, but he knew enough to be able to quickly locate an oxygen mask and tank, which he hooked together and slotted around Tony’s face. It took a moment, but after a few seconds Tony seemed to deflate, and then took a huge breath that sounded painful in Steve’s ears. He put his hand back on Tony’s chest, feeling for his heart, and liked to believe the action was what caused Tony’s breathing to stabilise, if only for a moment.
, maybe they could have sat down and come to a compromise.
“Well… I’ve been thinking about putting some new calzones one the menu,” Tony tried, and Rhodey just rolled his eyes again. Sighing heavily, he sat down at the table opposite him. “It’s really a nice place?”
“Hey, you want some coffee?” Steve called from in his apartment, and Tony realised he was still frozen to the spot by his front door.
But even if he did have the occasional thought about joining the Avengers, rebranding himself, he was pretty sure they wouldn’t take him. He was fairly certain that Captain America guy had a stick so far up his ass it was physically visible every time he opened his patriotic mouth; there was no way he’d let someone like Tony on the team.
“A nice guy who seems intent on getting you to see him naked?” Pepper hummed. “In my experience, those aren’t the kind of guys you want to be dating.”
Natasha shrugged her shoulders tiredly. “Empires fall every day.”
, so I told him to try stripping off completely. Really, he shouldn’t listen to me –“
When he glanced at Buck, the man smirked, and he suddenly had the craziest idea that this had to have something to do with Steve. Rolling his eyes, he paced the room and threw his door open; across the hall, Steve’s door was also open, and Tony could just about make out what appeared to be a classical three-piece string band inside.
“You said that if we weren’t up for this, to back out,” Tony reasoned quietly. He was balancing right on the edge of the pit, and looked so small. “I’m right here.”
,” Steve cackled, wrapping Tony up in his arms. “What happened to your dirty mouth?”
The party was going swimmingly, if Tony did say so himself. Though, honestly, he couldn’t remember a party he had thrown that hadn’t been anything other than a complete success. His parties these days tended to have a lot less coke and hookers and a lot more family friendly activities, of course, but the sentiment was still there.
“Not that weird, but yeah, couple drinks beforehand,” Tony continued, “and then we’ll head out to the Oak Tree at the end of the street and start the search, huh?”
It took a moment for Steve to get his hand coordinated enough to reply,
“Hey, neighbour!” Steve called over his shoulder as he pushed his door open. “Water’s not working in my apartment, had to use Buck’s shower.”
“He could use a haircut,” Tony hummed, tucked securely into Natasha’s breast pocket as they made their way home a few hours later. “But not too bad, right? Nice jawline, body, and those
Peter’s Dad, at least, had the presence of mind to frown. “Who, Peter?”
Steve hummed, leaning in to kiss Tony soundly on the lips. “You’re so sexy when you’re good with the kids.”
“That’s the spirit!” Tony grinned, bounding out of the elevator after her when it stopped outside her office.
to fuck him up?”
“Yes,” Bruce agreed, and then turned to Steve directly. “It’s going to be damn near impossible, but it might be the only hope we have.”
Companies sent him clothes, food, gadgets, cars, anything and everything, all in the hope that he would be seen out with or in them. He went from looking like a homeless alcoholic to getting $500 haircuts every few weeks and drinking bottles of Cristal that cost more than a whole month’s rent had in his old place in Massachusetts. He was verified on Twitter, which he didn’t use very often even though he was told constantly he had one of the most subscribed to accounts, and couldn’t go five minutes without his face being on some television channel for whatever reason.
Steve hummed under his breath as he crossed the room to give Tony a heaping pile of bacon, eggs and toast, though he still leaned down for a kiss when Tony puckered his lips. “Your highness.”
“Jesus,” he squeaked, startled, and then frowned when he spotted Tony grinning at him. “That wasn’t very nice, was it?”
“I’m going to find you, little Terrans.”
“Tony, no,” Steve ordered, but Tony wasn’t backing down. “We can find another way –“
“I just want to apologise,” Steve tried. “Please, just let me –“
What Steve couldn’t stop thinking about was that, regardless of the Accords, regardless of everything that had happened, Tony hadn’t even stopped to think before hurling himself into battle against Thanos’s goons. Steve had seen it on the news; Tony had thrown himself onto that ship without pause to try and save the world.
. You leave your opponents debilitated, but you never kill them.
“Thanks, kiddo,” he mumbled around his mouthful of sugar and milk. “At least
“Again, I own the business!” Tony yelled after him as he padded across the tiny landing to the bathroom across the way.
Cracking an eye open, Tony peered down at his four year old son now happily wedged between Tony’s side and his arm, sucking milk out of a sippy cup. “He said that, huh? So, of course, he sent you to do his dirty work?”
So that was why he was only wearing a towel.
-” Ah, so Rhodey was with her, too.
to rehearsals,” he replied, exasperated.
Tony would say,
It was enough. Steve saw realisation filter across Tony’s face, before his jaw set and he looked away. He blinked hard, and only a few tears fell – better than Steve had managed after he’d been defrosted.
“We could have saved all this if you’d let me hire someone to decorate,” Tony hummed, tacking the last line of spooky flags onto the wall. He turned and almost snorted with laughter when he spotted Peter crouching down on the floor in his costume, head tucked into the main body, and cardboard eyes resting on top like a real robot. “Although I don’t think I could ever begrudge setting eyes on that.”
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Peter shook his head, and then took a sip of his water. “Flash doesn’t have the vocabulary.”
They hadn't quite been able to break it to him properly.
“She was in college,” Steve replied immediately. “I checked.”
“I found George,” Rogers replied, sinking down into his seat behind his desk. Taking that as his cue, Tony dropped down into his, too (but not before discreetly checking to make sure there weren’t any more small animals hiding nearby).
“It’s not mine,” he mumbled, pulling at the material with a gross fascination. He felt a little faint. “Pietro got shot. He’s – he’s fine -” But then he noticed a little hole in the side of his shirt, and when he pivoted to get a better look at it, he realised distantly that there was also a hole in his side. “Oh.”
“Why did I take this job?” he heard her sigh as he marched from her office.
Silence echoed around the cluttered space for a few moments, and Tony took the opportunity to really look around. Every wall was lined with book shelves, and not an inch of space hadn’t been taken up by first editions. A large, proud writing desk stood in the centre of the room, the dark wood shining dully. A tall glass cabinet sat next to it, filled with all manner of interesting, creepy things; Tony spotted what looked like a cat’s skull, as well as a jar of pickled onions.
“I know,” Steve sighed. “I just... it feels kinda wrong to get rid of them. They're Jemima's babies.”
“It means,” Tony replied, hands busy with glue and cardboard as he dropped a kiss onto the top of Peter’s head, “that little things wind you up. Make you mad.”
“Okay,” Tony nodded, because he could do that. He could probably do that. “Okay, we’ll wait a couple of weeks. So you don’t think I should go over there and talk to their owner?”
“Can I help –?“
. Now they don’t even
“I see,” Rogers nodded his head amicably. “Well, let’s see. There’s Mr. and Mrs. Barnes, though they only live here while they’re not adventuring around the world. Then there’s Sam – he’s my music man. If you happen to see him around, you should ask him about the Trouble Man soundtrack.”
“And nobody was hurt in the New York office, right?” he asked. “Because we’re gonna have to pay out enough as it is.”
There was nothing for an eternity, and then a single, sparkling stone rose from the darkness and landed neatly at Steve’s feet. He stared at it, numb, and barely noticed Carol step forwards to quickly scoop it into the bag.
“Define friend,” Pepper replied, not even watching him as she flicked through the morning papers at the kitchen island. Rhodey was sat beside her, having been rewarded a rare two weeks paid leave, eating his breakfast.
“Huh.” Steve was still struggling to process.
Looked like Obadiah had brought weapons to a fist fight.
“No,” Steve simply agreed.
Steve shut him up by leaning up on his tiptoes and kissing him quiet. Tony grinned happily into the kiss, going so far as to dip Steve dangerously close to the ground like in the dance they had just shared.
“Right,” Tony nodded, a little smile coming, unbidden, to his lips. Rogers was actually kind of sweet. “I’ll get that filed for you next time tax return season comes around.”
Peter refused to sleep anywhere other than their room, which meant he was back in their bed (which led to a sexless, very cranky Tony). He'd already picked out names for the damn things, too, from what Tony could tell, so any hope of giving them away was well and truly out of the window.
He needed a change.
Tony didn’t really know how to respond to that. He wasn’t even really sure if he agreed with the guy. Cap didn’t know what Tony had done in his past – the kind of person he had been when he was younger. He was trying to atone, sure, but it was going to take a hell of a long time before he even considered himself
“Morning, neighbour,” he’d called unashamedly, even throwing a little wave Tony’s way as he padded over to his fridge. “Have a good day!”
Only, after a couple of years… he kind of hadn’t gotten used to it. He actually found himself in a bit of a funk, if he was being honest. Having joined the army right out of high school, he wasn’t the most educated guy, and he certainly couldn’t afford college on the Sergeant’s salary he had stocked up over his years in service. He could barely afford the insurance he was paying for his prosthetic arm, for God’s sake. That left him training as he went along on the building site he had managed to get a job on, and though he enjoyed being around other people on a regular basis again, it wasn’t very fulfilling work.
at him, unblinking, like he couldn’t quite believe he was there. Without really thinking, Steve reached out and put his hand against Tony’s chest, gently guiding him back down onto his pillows. He kept his hand there as Tony settled, feeling his heart quickly start to slow, and with a jolt realised that he was soothing Tony as much as Tony’s heart was soothing him.
“You really think they’ll go for it?” Rogers asked, eyes practically sparkling with hope.
“Call me.”
But Rogers just looked at him like he was speaking another language.
“Nooo,” James giggled hysterically, barely managing to balance both himself and his sippy cup as Tony got off the bed. The clock on the bedside table read 8:45am – not bad.
“I do not,” he replied, clearing his throat. “And he’s not creepy.”
But, despite that, Tony had learned his lesson from his previous relationships; once he figured out that he had a crush on Steve, he did his very best to avoid him. Rhodey told him that wasn’t a particularly mature thing to do, but it seemed to be working so far, so Tony wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
He was immediately hit by a wall of noise, of people laughing, children yelling, glasses clinking and cutlery scraping against plates. Momentarily overwhelmed, he stood stock still, staring around. There were hundreds of photos on the wall, family looking photos, as well as other tacky shit: there were hockey sticks and sports jerseys, car number plates and old records.
“Nope,” the guy replied with a shake of his head, sending his mohawk corkscrewing back and forth. Tony was momentarily struck by how the guy could possibly keep it up while it was still so malleable. “I’m Clint – butler, marksman and all-round little shit. Who the hell are you?”
“Um…” Peter wasn’t really listening to him, too busy moving around the communal lounge excitedly to care. “What?”
“Yes, Sir.”
“Hey, listen,” Natasha murmured as they exited the stairwell and walked down the corridor towards her apartment. “I’m sorry about what I said earlier, okay? It was mean, and -”
Tony was crying with happiness before they even made it down the aisle.
Steve stilled. “Was it… timed? Scheduled?”
“Thank you, Daddy,” Peter parroted back, train of thought already shifted onto the unopened bags of candy that Tony had drawn attention to. “Can I have some candy?”
They both turned to the door, excitement radiating from them both, before Steve suddenly stopped in his tracks.
“Oh yeah,” Steve grimaced. “I don’t know why you don’t fire him.”
that might help them track down Thanos and reverse everything that had been done.
Steve grinned goofily. “It was a pretty good kiss. Not so great circumstances, but ten out of ten for the actual kiss.”
“But -”
“Truth is, they don’t really like me,” he sighed, and Peter finally raised his head to look at him. His Dad gave him a small, apologetic smile, and then lifted his shirt to reveal a smattering of deep bruises along his ribs and chest. “Kids are smart, these days. Don’t punch you where adults will see.”
“I resent that,” Tony sniffed, bounding to his feet. “Besides, that nice sandwich place down the street closes in a half hour, and you need to eat.”
HYDRA’s clubhouse was very similar to their own; they were based in what looked like an old restaurant, but now just looked run down and boarded up. Many of the buildings around them seemed to have suffered a similar fate, though those looked truly abandoned.
Bucky was one of the football guys, and one of the only exceptions to Steve’s generally low expectations for jocks. They hadn’t always been friends, though; Bucky had originally been one of many bullies who liked to make Steve’s life hell. Finally, one day, Steve had had enough, and smacked Bucky around the head with a lunch tray so hard that it had given him two black eyes. They’d been best friends since.
“Whatcha doing, squirt?” Tony asked, rubbing a hand over his own tired eyes. It was almost 11pm – even they were getting tired.
“You get some rest, Petey,” his Dad nodded, probably reading the exhaustion on his face. “Get yourself better.”
No, no, I’m sorry,” Tony replied, holding a hand up defensively. “Hang on, I’m nearly done, I promise.”
He actually managed to get the kids to agree to the concert relatively easily. He was fairly certain Lily was going just so she could gif it or dubsmash it or whatever the hell kind of app was popular at the moment; Peter seemed a little more interested, at least, even if he had asked whether Taylor Swift would be there.
“Nice to meet you, too,” Steve nodded, grasping Tony’s hand.
“You’re not?” Buck rolled his eyes. “I’m gonna kill Steve.”
, of all people. He was still dressed in the uniform, though his helmet had come off, and a light spattering of pink coloured his cheeks as he very firmly didn’t look anywhere lower than the arc reactor.
“I guess so,” Steve nodded. “I know I must have seemed creepy as hell, and I’m so sorry, I –“
Pietro and Wanda used to be HYDRA members, and Steve was pretty sure they had been members of the Russian Mafia before that (though he was also pretty sure they weren’t actually Russian). They had changed sides after realising that HYDRA were no good, that they wanted control of the city rather than to make it a better place like Steve and his gang, but they still had a tonne of contacts that were willing to help out.
“’Kay,” the little girl nodded seriously. “Fanks.”
“I think she’s excited, too,” Steve reassured. “It’s just jitters, I guess. She’ll come around.”
“No, fuck you!” Tony cut over him, pushing him again. “Fuck you for making me fight my friends, fuck you splitting us up, fuck you for leaving,
“I forgive you,” Tony sighed, leaning into his warmth. Steve pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “Doesn’t mean I have to like it.”
Looked like he hadn’t been careful enough.
“It’s not a dive bar, Tony,” Pepper rolled her eyes as she looked over the receipts that evening after closing. “Irish Rogers’ Tavern and Eatery is exactly what it says on the sign. Rhodey says that their burgers are pretty good, apparently.”
“Oh m'goodness!” he whispered, dropping down onto his knees to look more closely at the eggs. “Daddy, Papa, Jemima laid eggs!”
Life hadn’t always been like this, though. Once upon a time, Tony was supposed to take over his father’s weapons company. He had been just out of MIT, bumming around New England and trying to put off the inevitable, when he had wandered into a bar one evening and heard the most amazing sound coming from the in-house guitarist there. He’d listened to the whole set, bought one of the guy’s CDs afterwards, too, and they’d got to talking.
“Thank you,” Tony replied briskly, watching as Sam walked away. He placed his order on a window ledge behind the bar, through which Tony could see the chef hard at work. It… looked like he had a prosthetic arm.
“Sorry,” Steve started automatically, taking a step back towards the door. “I didn’t realise you were in here.”
“I don’t like it when one of them gets sick,” Tony sighed as she disappeared, watching Steve scrape what Lily hadn’t eaten onto his own plate.
Tony was in trouble. Shit,
“Steven Rogers?” he asked weakly, not even believing the words as they left his mouth.
he got in reply, and then put his phone back into his pocket.
Instead, he ducked through a doorway and found a dark kitchen. After a quick search, he came up with a couple cans of beans, which he quickly dumped into a relatively clean pan. He wrestled with the stove for a moment, never having used a gas one before, but figured it out pretty quickly and set the beans to cooking. The heavenly smell of tomato sauce soon began to cover the must that seemed to cling to every inch of the house; Peter found a crooked spoon wedged at the back of a drawer and hastily sat at the chipped table in the centre of the room to dig into his meagre meal. It was perfect after the stressful day he’d had, and he stuffed as much into his mouth as he could possibly manage, decidedly not thinking about the stacks of pizzas his Pops usually ordered after they’d gotten back from a mission.
On it, a man was waving desperately up at the camera. For a moment Steve didn’t recognise him, and then realisation slapped him in the face and he took a shocked breath.
“There has to be another way,” Carol reasoned. “I could fly down and see if it’s in the bottom –“
“See, now who’s being mean?” Tony hummed, and then grimaced as he took a bite of his mac and cheese. “Also, remind me to call the school board when we get home, because I never want this trash in your body ever again.”
“Stop it!” Peter hissed, tugging Tony back when he looked like he was going to lean over and talk to her. “What are you doing?”
Quietly, so as not to wake Steve, who was snoring against Tony’s shoulder, he turned the phone around and took a quick snap of them. He then sent it to Natasha with the caption,
He was shaking like a leaf by the time they pulled up outside Tony’s place, and staggered off his bike like a drunkard, breath coming short in his chest. Tony came running out to them, Natasha and Clint stood a little further back looking completely unharmed, and Steve all but fell into his boyfriend’s arms when Tony held them out to him.
Pepper had been his last attempt at a proper relationship. They’d been together for three years – the longest relationship Tony had ever managed – before they had finally decided that it wasn’t going to work for them full time, and that they were better off taking a step backwards and remaining friends instead.
“You know him?”
Across the coffee shop table, Natasha almost choked on her tea. “
“Of course you’d say that!” Peter screamed, slamming his fork down on the table as he surged to his feet. “You’re so smooth and charming and cool! How do you do it? You’re
“Okay,” Steve breathed a sigh of relief. “Good. So, you think you can get dressed now, maybe? And we’ll dry your eyes?”
had lost.
“What, I – who said anything about dating?” Tony scoffed, heart hammering a little in his chest. “You guys are crazy. Steve’s obviously just got no qualms about his body – and he’s got every right to be proud, because sometimes the light catches him just right and it looks like he’s made out of marble, and –“
“There’ll only be two of us in the car, dork,” Rhodey rolled his eyes fondly.
“Bucky!” Rogers called as he paced forwards towards the couple, obviously overjoyed. “Natasha! You’re back!”
“Why do you even care?” Stane rolled his eyes, shuffling backwards to prop himself up against the opposite wall. “Who do you work for? Did Raul send you -?”
“Too long for me to go without seeing you,” Steve replied, and then gestured to the violin in his hand. “Me and my band were just practising.”
“Oh, I know,” Tony replied, shaking the guy’s hand as they all sat down. “Nice to finally have a face to put to all the moaning coming out of Natasha’s bedroom recently -”
“Strange mentioned something about that,” Tony mumbled. As he spoke, his knee brushed Steve’s under the table; Steve did nothing to stop it.
Christmas Eve, Steven, and you need to get your butt into the Christmas spirit.”
“If we can harness it’s power, point us in an agreed trajectory,” Bruce began, already nodding his head, “we can go back and warn ourselves, or stop this from happening, or –“
“I don’t think so,” Rogers replied with a charming grin. “Would you like to follow me? It’s likely Frigga will escape again, and she didn’t seem to have taken a liking to you like she usually does with guests. My office is this way.”
He needed to come up with a plan, or he was going to starve to death before his family even had a chance to wail on him.
“Weed, too?” he sighed, eyeing the little bag carefully.
,” Peter sighed, dragging the syllables out as far as he could. Reluctantly, he started to shimmy out of his costume.
“I –“ Tony wasn’t really sure what to say, and instead just closed his door and turned to the man, who was now perched quite happily on his couch. “What?”
“Oh, definitely,” Tony agreed easily, because even
While they continued to bicker and wander past, Tony came to a stop by Steve’s dressing room. When they opened the door, a screaming noise immediately started up. There had to be at least twelve girls in there, a harassed looking Bucky Barnes trying to wrangle them.
. That included, as Tony had found out this year, his choice in costume. Usually Steve took Peter out for his costume and the decorations, but this year he’d been called away with Natasha on a covert mission for a few days, leaving Tony to get the squirt and the tower ready for their annual Halloween party.
,” Steve sighed, even more confused. “It’s always… explosive.”
“Pete?” came his Dad’s voice from the other side of the door. “Petey?”
“Water would be fine, thank you,” Steve replied a little stiffly, glancing around the living room with interest.
Steve was fairly certain his capacity for processing trauma had reached its peak well before he’d even been defrosted. Logically, he knew that everyone was grieving, tired,
Sat at the end of the bar, seemingly talking to herself (though Bucky knew she had to be talking to her own fairy), was his
, Clint,” Natasha scoffed. “I very much doubt she was flashing them at you.”
A man stood looming over both Tony and the lion from the stairs, white suit immaculate on his well-sculpted body. His hair was the colour of the sun on a cold winter’s day, his eyes the colour of the clearest sky. Miraculously, at the sound of the man’s voice, the lion had stopped in its tracks, dropping down onto its belly in submission. Tony felt himself instantly relaxing in the man’s presence.
,” Steve sighed, exasperated. “You were so excited to see me and Daddy get married last week when we went suit shopping. Is it – do you not like the suit? Is that it -?”
“Wha’s kw – kwor -” James tried, and then huffed out a frustrated sigh.
“If you grab the last of the bedroom stuff, I’ll take your TV in, yeah?” Rhodey was deciding as the door opposite Tony’s opened and a nearly naked man stepped out.
“He was drifting just outside the Milky Way,” Danvers murmured, staring down at Stark as well. “Couldn’t have been a few days from arriving here, but the oxygen levels were dangerously low. He would have died before getting back.”
“Okay,” he croaked, and then cleared his throat by taking a swig of water. “Yeah, okay, I guess I can stay a little while.”
“I try my best,” Tony grinned, gently nudging his nose against Steve’s. Then, clearing his throat yet again, he continued, “So, um, maybe the wrong order, but… do you wanna maybe get some dinner with me after this?”
“And you always,
Except… Steve’s door was closed.
“Oh…” Lang nodded his head. “Okay, yeah, but how’re going to –“
Steve took a deep breath, then followed him over.
“You know, you could just ask him about it,” she hummed, and then seemed to think better of it. “Actually, he’s never been the guy to talk about his feelings. You could follow him? See where he’s going.”
“No!” Peter replied, tugging it messily towards him. “My cereal.”
Really, he was doing a public service.
“It isn’t over yet,” he warned them. “Vision still has the mind stone, and Thanos is on his way to take back what he believes he’s owed.”
“Come on,” he tried, nudging Natasha gently with his shoulder. “Let’s hit a couple of bars tonight. You can talk to some guys, I can make out with some fairies -”
he didn’t.
That was a good idea to break the ice. Natasha and Tony liked to play a game called Five and One after they’d argued, where they’d tell each other five things they liked about each other, and one thing they needed to improve on. If nothing else, it’d be an opportunity for Tony to get some flirty compliments in.
“I see,” she croaked. “Was it at least –“
Peter shook his head and sniffed; his Dad kissed his head gently.
“Peter?” his Pops asked softly, drawing him out of his thoughts and back to dinner. “How was your day? You’ve barely touched your potatoes; are you feeling okay?”
Clint shook his head.
“Yeah…” Tony replied quietly, trying to ignore how his heart sank a little in his chest. “Yeah, I… I guess so.”
Tony loved to read, of example. Not e-books, either – he loved to hold a physical book in his hands. Steve found him more than once, in a quiet moment, just running his hands over the spines of his large collection, as though he was silently telling himself that now he’d have time to read them, that the stories were still there, that
“I eated my breakfast,” Peter proclaimed. “Do… can I have m'books?”
“- know that kids still go under the bleachers to make out? Didn’t kids in your day make out under the bleachers, Steve? Honestly, it’s kinda sweet in a gross, teenager way –“
“So you decided to take him in?” Tony asked, for want of a better question.
“That’s Daddy’s bad,” Tony told him while Peter shook his little head. “But, to be fair, this movie drags you in.”
“Yes,” Rogers replied. “And there’s me, of course. I live here.”
sort of cute, in a is-probably-very-slimy kind of way, and he could see why Rogers and his companions might get attached to the little guy.
kind of guy, but the melody was truly beautiful. Tony’s acoustic stuff always had been.
It wasn’t fine. His skin screamed as he brought the knife down, cutting and cauterising all in the same motion, and the pain momentarily knocked the breath out of him. He groaned, blinking tears from his eyes as he continued to dig into his palm until he could see the tiny tracker amongst muscle and veins and bone. Taking a moment to heave air into his lungs, he forced himself to stop quivering quite so much and reached in to pluck the tracker out. As soon as it was out, and before he could second guess himself (or pass out), he pressed the hot blade to his palm, sealing his ribboned skin before infection could set in.
Cap seemed a little startled by the nick-name, but recovered quickly. “We aren’t on the same side. You’re a bully – you terrorise people -”
Tony growled, low in his throat, and tipped himself forwards for yet another kiss. “If there weren’t three gremlins in the next room bound to come running at the mere hint of noise, I’d bend you right over that table and -”
“What’s up?”
“You… you…” he seemed at a loss of what to say.
“Uncle Bruce,” Peter pleaded, holding his good arm up as though that was going to protect him in any way whatsoever. “Please, no, don’t do this –“
“We have to take it,” Tony murmured. “If we put the stones in it, maybe we can use the power to destroy it from the inside out.”
“Oops?” Lang tried, already trying to cram the shards under a rug.
When he turned back to Steve and the others, Steve was giving him that stupid, goofy grin that still, even after nearly six years, made him feel warm and fluttery inside. Even in his Frankenstein make-up, he was gorgeous. Stupid, gorgeous Steve.
He already missed his stupid, crazy family.
“Please,” Tony scoffed. “Egging and teepeeing is practically expected on Halloween, Steve. Where’s your holiday spirit?”
Tony also loved to cook. In the first few days after his return, he was rarely found anywhere other than in the kitchen, cooking or baking the most delicious smelling meals. Again, Steve could see trauma peering through, almost an obsession, as Tony gorged himself on huge, hearty meals. He knew what it was like to go hungry, could see his childhood self in Tony as he stuffed pasta and bread and all sorts of things into his mouth, but he could also see it becoming a problem if it wasn’t monitored.
“What’s all that noise?” Tony asked as they got closer to the stage, and, when they were situated in the wings, Steve finally pulled the blindfold down.
“I have a story, too,” Tony replied quietly, and then quickly looked away to save himself some embarrassment. He pulled out his laptop, prepared to do a little research. “You got a plug socket for this?”
“Umm,” he replied, and quickly had to clear his throat because it came out around five octaves higher than he wanted it to. “Uh, I have to get to work.”
Afterwards, when they were both naked and satiated on the cot in the corner of the room, Steve pulled Tony into his arms and let him lay against his chest. They were silent, heavy breathing giving way to a slow, calm
“Hello,” she replied in kind, seemingly amused by him. It was a start, at least.
It was only with that revelation that he also realised that he wasn’t in a hospital bed, or even at Tony’s garage, but tucked up safely in his own bed at home.
“It’s okay!” a male voice called from nearby, though Tony couldn’t really tell from which door it originated. “It’s all under control! Just sciencing!”
“What?” Tony frowned. “I’m not gonna hide who I am, kid.”
? Listen, I love the guy, and we’re platonic life partners, but I am absolutely not sleeping with him.”
“I told you to stop putting yourself in danger, not to provoke them!” Tony yelled, running nervous hands through his already messy hair. “Don’t you dare, don’t you
“He didn’t say we were having guests,” Clint frowned, but then shrugged his shoulders. “Oh well! Come on in.”
Things had turned ugly fast. They seemed to be targeting him specifically – or Spider-Man, perhaps, but they knew it was him – and no matter what he tried, he hadn’t been able to reason with them. His only option had been to distract them and run, abandoning the mission for the moment in order to regroup his thoughts and come up with a plan. His Pops always told him there had to be a plan in place.
“Can we… he didn’t give us co-ordinates, but could we track this message?” he asked, but even as he said the words, they felt impossible.
Steve couldn’t help but smile a little at that, because Tony was right. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he tipped his head forwards to momentarily rest against Tony’s, and then he pulled back completely.
“Then I say we go find that technology, track ol’ grape face down, and crack his skull,” Rocket yelled, slamming his tiny fist down on the table in front of him.
Wanda remained stubbornly by Pietro’s side. She clutched his hand in what had to be a crushing grip, and no-one mentioned how she was crying quietly. Steve couldn’t say in all honesty that he didn’t feel like bursting into tears, either.
The sun was just beginning to shine through the cracks in their curtains when Steve woke up that morning. Tony’s warm, solid weight was pressed up against his back, his arms wrapped loosely around him as he slept, and Steve smiled, rolling on the spot to face him.
FRIDAY helpfully relayed to all of them via earpiece.
“Now we know he’s alive, he’s the best chance we have of reversing this thing,” Steve argued stubbornly. “He’s our best shot. We have to find him.”
And Tony was gone.
“It’s not…” Steve started to argue, but the words died on his tongue. “There has to be something we can do.”
It ended too soon.
“I am yet to see evidence that he’s not evil,” Hawkeye grumbled. “Just because he’s not killed us yet doesn’t mean he’s not evil.”
“I…” Peter hiccupped again, but thankfully seemed to be calming down a little bit. “I don’t want you and Daddy to get married, Papa.”
He’d found a pair of his socks on eBay once. That had been weird.
“You’re all crazy here, aren’t you?” he asked, still grinning. Hell, he could feel himself starting to go a little insane already himself.
“I’m not saying hide it,” Peter replied quickly, unsure how to get him to understand. “Just… just don’t mention it, maybe? High school kids can be really cruel about this stuff.”
He knew she was right. Even as they spoke, his ribs groaned in protest and his mind felt heavy with exhaustion. Like this, he couldn’t help anyone; he was a liability. He knew that.
With a final, bravely cheeky salute, Tony took a deep breath and threw himself backwards into the abyss. He was gone in a silent second, and Steve felt a rushing in his ears as he dropped to his knees and let out a strangled scream.
“Uh… yeah?” Tony replied, unsure. “Who the hell are you?”
, but that had been convincing. Feeling a little foolish, he took a short step towards her, watching cautiously as she flipped her dark hair out of her eyes.
, at least, and for the first time since the whole mess had started, he felt like he had his old team back. That was worth something, if nothing else.
“You know full well your father hasn’t checked his Twitter account in years,” Steve smiled. “The secret is safe. Good job, baby; God, he’s going to be so surprised.”
His Dad had been a teenager for almost two weeks at this point. The first few days had been okay – fun, even – but things had slowly gotten worse and worse for Peter since then. His Dad had somehow managed to win over all of the popular kids, including the bullies, and Peter just didn’t understand. He was just as much of a nerd as Peter; he was currently wearing a
“You’re… you’re a butler, and you speak to guests like that?” Tony asked, somehow not really surprised. Sighing, he continued, “I’m Tony Stark, Mr. Rogers’ accountant. I’m supposed to meet with him today?”
“We, um, we snuck you into SHIELD,” Cap told him. “Our Director kind of has a reward on your head, so we had to be careful, but you saved my life, and you needed help, so… we’re keeping it amongst the Avengers.”
“- it just sort of hit me,” he continued over Tony. “You’re smart. You’re tactical. You have a weaponised suit of armour - you could kill whoever you want, but you…
, and was a signal to Santa that meant he could land there with his sleigh. Peter… hadn’t been completely convinced, but hadn’t said anything else about it, so Steve had assumed he’d accepted Tony’s story.
Unable to stop himself smiling, he tugged Lily into a tight hug and kissed the top of her head.
Colonel Carol Danvers was her name. After a short introduction and run-down of her life (which included aliens and words that Steve definitely didn’t understand), she strode forward – Stark still nestled in her arms – and entered the compound as though she belonged there.
“I think we’re about done for the night, folks,” he called into the microphone, and grinned when the whole arena booed. “Now, darlings, don’t be that way.”
“That’s better!” he praised as Peter got the hang of it, grinning proudly. “Good job, Peter! You’ve got it!”
Everyone but Tony.
Steve sighed and rolled his eyes. Though Peter would probably be a sleepy nightmare tomorrow, Tony was right; it
“Okay,” she nodded, even as tears ran down her face. “So we finish what he started, huh?”
Rolling his eyes, Tony threw himself from Natasha’s shoulder and had grown to full size before he hit the floor. His wings shrunk and then disappeared, giving him the appearance of a normal human being; without even a misstep, he dusted off his business suit and continued along behind her as she stepped through the doors of SHIELD Publishing House, glancing around to make sure no-one had seen him phase.
Neither of them was going to wait at the end of the aisle while the other walked down to meet them – it seemed a little redundant, given their situation. Instead, they’d agreed that they’d let Peter walk them both down the aisle together after the wedding party.
because his Dad had insisted they stamp a tracker in the palm of his hand, which –
was perfect -
“You don’t say,” Tony agreed, folding his arms across his chest. “Is that why he’s not been in the corridor these past few days? He thought I was seeing someone else?”
“And this isn’t the first time this has happened?” Pepper asked him seriously, and Tony laughed.
“Merry Christmas,” he replied.
Tony knew she was trying to act as wingman for him, and he loved her for it, but he was one hundred percent certain that Steve wasn’t going to sleep with him, tonight or potentially any other night. But what was he supposed to do? He’d promised her he’d make an effort, and for the sake of her happiness he was going to have to stick to that promise.
“I’ll see if there’s anyone I like,” Natasha compromised quietly with a sigh. “I guess it has been kinda a long time since I fucked anyone.”
“I'd like to believe she's more sensible than that,” Tony replied, and then shrugged when Steve rolled his eyes at him. “What? She's smart. She knows the risks of being a single mother -”
“We lost him once, in Afghanistan,” he murmured, “and we got him back. Tony Stark is the toughest son-of-a-bitch I know, so don’t think for a second that –“
The fifteen year old looked down at his jammies. “Aw, nuts.”
“First, I’m kicked off the team. Second, my husband refuses to have sex with me. Third, he
Steve looked down and realised that, yes, he was covered in blood.
job.”
“I don’t mean you guys,” Tony rolled his eyes, trying not to fidget as Pepper started applying butterfly bandages. “I
“Okay,” Tony murmured, snuggling unashamedly into Rhodey’s arms. “Thanks, sugarplum.”
Danvers looked regretful for just a moment, but hid it well as she pushed through the medical bay doors and laid Tony down on the nearest bed.
Peter didn’t even realise he had flinched away from the touch until it had happened, and his Pops pulled away sharply, a look of panicked realisation on his face.
Steve cut him off with another kiss, and he rolled his eyes.
Heart aching in his chest, Steve laid in bed a moment longer, part of him considering going back to sleep, forgetting he had seen or heard anything, and letting whatever this was continue.
“Yeah,” Tony admitted quietly. Then, sighing, he added, “Whatever we do, we absolutely cannot let the kid find out -”
Not the word Steve would have used for it, but whatever.
he was. Hell, Tony almost swallowed his damn tongue when he got a look at the guy’s face.
“Night, honey,” he replied, pulling her into a one armed hug as he got to his feet. “Peter, baby, you have popcorn sticking to your shirt.”
“Hey, Parker, I was talking to you,” came Flash’s voice, closer this time, and Peter braced himself even before he turned to face him.
further down than his arc reactor, and then, without another word, left the room.
It took a couple of hours, but by the time Bruce had sewed up Pietro’s entrance and exit wounds, and then had given him an emergency transfusion of Wanda’s blood, it looked like he was going to make a full recovery. They’d had to go without anaesthetic, which hadn’t been a fun experience for anyone in the room, honestly, but Pietro was going to be fine; he was resting groggily on a makeshift nest they’d made out of sheets and spare articles of clothing with Wanda wrapped around him protectively.
The room was pretty bare. There were a few machines hooked up to him, but the gentle beeping told him they were checking his vitals, so that was fine. Other than that, however, there was a window off to one side with an unrecognisable view outside, a door on the opposite wall, and that was about it.
But Tony waved Steve away and pulled Peter into his side. After a moment, a couple of people moved, creating a path between them and the apple bobbing station, and Peter pointed to a long faced, snotty looking kid of around nine or ten years old dressed like what looked like a miniature Donald Trump.
“This is a terrible idea,” Steve warned him, though his threat didn’t really hold much weight. “You’re setting a terrible example for Peter –“
Steve, never one to disobey a direct order, immediately began fiddling with his belt.
“Peter, honey, I wasn’t going to… Jesus,” his Pops hissed, looking disgusted with himself. “I’m so, so sorry, Son, I –“
“Um, yeah,” his Dad replied, following him as Peter made his way over to his usual table. “I’m hopefully only here for a couple of weeks maximum, and he was struggling, so I thought
“I’ll have to tell Pepper,” Tony groaned, thinking of his personal manager. She was going to
And then he saw the crashed spaceship in the middle of the lawn. Tony really
“Yeah?” Steve asked softly, ducking down to pick the guitar back up. “You wanna play it for me?”
“Kill him,” Uncle Clint replied.
Tony had already told them he was Iron Man with complete faith that they would keep his secret. Hell, it had got to the point where the military were riding Iron Man’s ass so hard that he’d
“So, uh…” Tony started, pulling out the letter that Rogers had originally sent to the company. “You have some things you’d like to discuss?”
“But it’s genocide,” Tony spat. “And we’re going to get them back.”
“Okay,” he took a deep breath. “Get suited up, then. We’re doing this now.”
“You need to rest,” Natasha sighed, almost as though she had been reading his mind. “Recuperate. You took some pretty big hits, and I know you have the Serum, but you’re not invincible, Steve.”
, this was bad. Tony really, really didn’t want to have to go bare knuckles on a
“Night night, Papa,” Lily hummed as they all made their way to bed after their customary evening family movie.
“JARVIS, have Pepper get the ice packs ready back in Malibu,” he sighed, bouncing from foot to armoured foot to get himself pumped up. “I’m definitely gonna need them.”
lawsuits,” Tony agreed, kissing him again despite his words.
Steve honestly thought about it for a moment, glancing across the room to where a group of kids seemed to be laughing at something Tony had just said, but ultimately thought against it. Shaking his head, he said, “Nah. Can’t ruin his pretty face right before the show.”
Dinnertime came and went, and then it was time to get Tony to the venue.
He couldn’t keep the late mornings up, though. Being late every now and again was all well and good, but Fury, his boss, was starting to lose his patience. Tony was a talented mechanic, sure, but Fury had no time for unreliable people; Tony was going to have to come up with another way to try and avoid Steve.
Natasha hit a couple of buttons that turned sound on, and for a minute they just stood in silence, listening to what Lang was saying.
He hadn’t come up with a better plan for finding out where Tony was going by that evening, so he really had no choice but to do as Natasha had suggested and tag along to wherever he was disappearing to.
Leaving Peter’s clothes on the couch, Steve stood and crossed the room, scooping Peter clean off the ground and into his arms where he held him close against his chest.
The few hours after a concert were always just as crazy as the actual concert itself. After throwing guitar picks and drum sticks and, more often than not, their sweaty shirts out into the audience, they all bounced backstage, buzzing with adrenaline from yet another great show.
it happened,” Steve agreed. “We've always been so careful with her -”
together anymore, Papa!”
As though he had been waiting outside the door for an occasion just such as this (and, having come to know a little more about the mansion since arriving, Tony was willing to bet he probably had been), Clint burst through the door not seconds later, an inquisitive expression on his face.
something, but Rhodes… Rhodes had always been loyal to Tony rather than the team, helpful when he needed to be but ultimately there as a friend rather than a member. Now his friends were gone.
“Tony –“ Steve tried weakly, but it was already too late.
Everyone else took a step back.
“I was part of an unprecedented army incident. That’s where the money comes from,” Rogers continued quietly. “Despite our pasts, some of us made it to university – Bruce, Jane. The majority of us didn’t, not for lack of trying, but lack of funding, lack of accessibility, lack of opportunity.
“Heard Lily on the phone with her friends,” Tony cut him off, and he seemed genuinely upset. “She… I don’t know exactly what they were saying, but she was replying that it was embarrassing that we were her parents, that we’re lame Dad Rock, that -”
Moving quickly towards the back of the auditorium, Steve made for his gym bag and unzipped it, pulling a small towel out of it to dry his sweat damp hair. He was so busy reaching for the back of his head that he didn’t see Tony Stark approaching, and nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt Tony prod him in the ribs.
That, at least, startled a chuckle out of Tony. “You bet on whether I was evil?”
“Okay, this guy,” Tony mumbled around a mouthful of meat, bread and cheese. He nodded towards a guy walking in the opposite direction to them who appeared to be talking to himself. “Talking to a fairy, or just crazy?”
“James talks about his
“- gonna call a tow truck to take them to a -”
With an exaggerated sigh, as though the effort troubled him terribly, Peter dropped a bag of candy back into one of the many buckets Tony had dumped it into and wandered back over to him.
There was a loud clank from behind them, and Tony had just enough presence of mind to yank Cap down and under him before Stane tugged the discarded bazooka towards him and fired.
“We might have to accept,” she started quietly, and looked down at her feet with a sigh, “that, this time, there’s nothing we can do.”
It wasn’t like he had time to be flirting, anyway.
“Not even moved in five minutes and you’re already being propositioned,” Rhodey tutted from behind him, and he was leaning against the door frame when Tony turned to look at him. “Unbelievable.”
“You the kid Stevie keeps talking about?” a complete stranger cut him off, before promptly slipping past Tony and wandering into his apartment.
Putting both cookies onto one of Peter’s Dora the Explorer plates, figuring they could share it, Steve then grabbed the plate in one hand and Peter’s milk in the other, and headed back out into the lounge.
(which Tony was very proud to say he had written), had gone straight in at number one, and had stayed there for fifteen consecutive weeks, tying with Wet Wet Wet’s
He put the phone down before anything else could be said. Becoming President was the very last thing he wanted, especially during all of the chaos that reigned. He couldn’t help if he was President, couldn’t fight with everyone else.
Tony could and had been a little bit stupid when it came to people he had crushes on. Pepper told him he had a tendency to give all of himself to people, usually a bit too hastily, and was always left heartbroken when it became a little too much for them.
“Stop, baby; you’re going to make yourself sick,” his Pops murmured, his words rumbling against Peter’s back. “We’re so proud of you. You got yourself away long enough to recuperate.”
No, no, please no, he wanted to go home; he needed a chance to bitch to Natasha about what a fuddy-duddy he’d been lumped with, he needed -
“Well,” Tony hummed in reply, “you originally wanted to be a ghost, right? Why don’t we go back to your original choice -”
?” Tony croaked, spotting him too.
Before he had consciously decided what to do, Steve had aimed his gun and put a single, final bullet right between the Red Skull’s eyes, letting his anger steady his hand. In the chaos that followed, he revved his engine and then sped forwards towards Pietro. He wasn’t moving, but that didn’t mean he was dead, and Steve didn’t stop to find out as he used his bike to cover them for a second while he pulled Pietro up onto the saddle behind him.
“Yeah!” Peter squealed, throwing his arms up in the air excitedly. “Yes, Daddy!”
“They were taken by the Snap?” Thor guessed quietly.
“I actually just really like kissing you,” Steve replied, raising his eyebrows, “and kissing you is definitely not the only way I know how to shut you up.”
“Jimmy ruined it!” Peter sobbed, and Tony felt a protective growl rising in his throat; who the
Steve, at least, smiled at that, and finally looked away from Tony so he could shake Natasha’a hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you properly, ma’am.”
“Coming from you, that’s the best I can hope for,” Natasha grinned at him, and Tony huffed.
He forced himself to move, knowing if he didn’t he might do something stupid like hug one of them.
Before he could leave the room, Steve reached out on a whim and grabbed his arm. Rhodey looked momentarily startled, but then his face set into something more solid.
Peter just sighed and tried to refrain from smacking his head against the surface of the table in front of him.
“I was trying to keep you safe,” he replied, voice cracking. “I was trying to – I wanted to make the city safer for you to grow up in. I never meant to get caught up in HYDRA’s shit, I swear.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve nodded, and then grinned when Tony pulled them both in for a kiss.
nice, but it’s got its charm. Seems like a personal, family place.”
In any other situation, Steve would have just given up, or perhaps passed the task of dressing Peter off to Tony, but they were supposed to be getting
Wincing, Steve managed to get an awkward hand under him and pulled out a paintbrush that someone had obviously forgotten to put away. Collapsing back again, he let out a laugh of his own.
Tony was a little reckless, sure, but he tended not to anger the Elders. His father was one, for one thing, and he didn’t need him to be any more disappointed in him than he already was.
In the end, his decision was made for him when, coming to an instant, complete halt, he realised, with growing horror, that there appeared to be a
“My in house manager ate here the other day, gave it a rave review,” he explained, taking a sip of his beer in the process. It… was delicious. “He’s a traitor, of course, and I’ve since flayed him alive and served him as an entrée, but… I was curious, I guess.”
They had been keeping the Time Stone in a magical bag that Strange had given them so they didn’t have to touch them with their bare hands. Carol held open the bag and let Heimdall drop the stone inside. They glowed together for a moment before going dark, but Steve didn’t question it. He knew how much power was in that little pouch already.
“Sorry, I – I should have knocked,” he started, before immediately continuing. “I was just down in the lab, and – and there’s a message from Tony.”
“You lied to us,” Clint whispered, bottom lip trembling, and that cut Steve deeper than any bullet ever could. “All this time -”
The Avengers (what was left of them) holed up in the facility upstate. The first few days were the hardest, watching scattered television reports of all the destruction and reading comments and messages from all over the world. People were screaming out for help, for guidance, and Steve didn’t know what to do.
“Is that everyone?” he forced himself to ask, not sure that he actually wanted the answer.
, he was in so much trouble. Never had a person in the history of the world been in more trouble than he -
“I’m telling you,” his Dad replied quietly. “Because I love you, and I trust you, and I don’t want you to make the mistake I’ve made twice now.
Tony hadn’t had a romantic crush on anyone since then, had thought he’d managed to successfully repress any feelings of that particular nature, but then Steve had come along and completely ruined it all.
?” Flash outright laughed. “Carbonell, you know this nerd?”
“So what does that mean -?”
The one thing they didn’t do was speak about the Accords and Siberia. If anything, it seemed like Tony was doing his very best to avoid any conversation that would cause an argument – something that was very unlike him. Steve supposed that he was just so traumatised, so happy to be back on Earth, that he was doing his level best to keep everyone who remained as close to him as possible. Steve knew exactly what that felt like, and could absolutely respect Tony’s intentions.
. Quickly latching onto a solid idea, Tony nodded his head encouragingly and replied, “That’s great! I can make you an Iron Man suit –“
Steve didn’t care. This was a lead – this was
certainly hadn’t been amongst them.
Cap nodded, taking a deep breath, and let it out as a sigh of what Tony thought was relief. “Hawkeye owes me fifty bucks.”
Whoop, well, maybe she was a little drunker than she was letting on after all.
“Okay, you wanna mix up some grey paint?” Tony asked, still fiddling with the cardboard and glue. “Do you remember what colours make grey?”
, but he didn’t want the kid to have to cart around a costume made of wood or whatever else all night, so they’d had to make do.
“Just peachy,” Tony replied, crossing his arms behind his head. “Was I at least doing it right before we both went tumbling to the floor?”
But the truth was, there wasn’t really another option. Natasha was right – Tony was the most stubborn man Steve knew, and was only getting worse with age; if Steve asked what was wrong, he’d just get a grunted “I’m fine” in response. But Steve was stubborn, too. He couldn’t just let this go when it could potentially hurt them all so much if it were to come out any other way. Reporters still hounded them – if they got pictures of Tony with someone else, started slandering him… Steve would hate that for the kids.
Steve just planted his head on the lunch table and waited for the floor to swallow him.
“Keep it safe,” was all Heimdall advised as he passed the stone to them.
) and had gotten a thumbs up emoji in return, which… was odd. His father should not be using emojis.
“Can I get a gingerbread cookie, honey?” Tony called through to him as he was busy pouring Peter’s milk into a sippy cup.
“You… you wanna get dinner with
jealous that he wasn’t invited. So not jealous, in fact, that he took to leaving them food outside just to prove how useful and not jealous he was. If he was also hoping to catch Tony alone, maybe apologise for the Accords and everything that had happened since, well… that was just extra. That wasn’t important – not as important as proving how useful and not jealous he was.
from a few days before.
“Yeah, he’d like you to believe that, kid,” Tony chuckled, patting James’ back as he stepped out of the elevator again and across the living room to the kitchen. “Steve, your son just called you old and gross.”
It was really hard to watch.
Peter beamed back at him mid-move, but must have stopped concentrating, because he almost immediately tripped over his own feet and went toppling over. Steve sighed and slapped a hand over his face, exasperated.
“No, no, don’t call me honey,” Tony insisted with a grin, moving out of Steve’s reach when he moved towards him. “I am Tony Stark, former front man of the biggest rock band in the world, and latent sex machine.”
“We are
With the room so crowded, people just assumed a stray elbow or handbag had knocked the glasses onto the floor – it was no big deal.
Peter was a strange one. There were moments where he showed real progress, where Steve thought he had the potential to actually take dancing further if he wanted to. Other times… he looked like a newborn giraffe learning to walk. He was a weird mix of perfect grace and unending clumsiness, and Steve was still trying to figure out which was the dominant trait.
again?”
“That’s literally all I wanted to know. See how easy that was?” Tony grinned, and Peter just sighed at him, as though the kid thought he was terribly hard done to. “Do you want to help, or do you want to keep playing in your costume?”
“Hey, Parker!” Flash called from a couple people behind Peter, and he just sighed, bracing himself. “Who’s the other tray for, your boyfriend?”
Steve grinned back, feeling a little lighter. “Well, I think it’s about time we showed the kids what we actually did for a living.”
“I’m not perfect,” Cap shook his head softly, a gentle, almost pitying expression on his face. Tony hated that expression. “Nobody is perfect. You… I don’t understand your motives. I don’t understand what your endgame is, but… but you’re not evil, are you? Not really.”
“Yes,” Rogers nodded. “I want to buy a university. Harvard or MIT or somewhere like that.”
“You’re suggesting… actually going back in time?” Rhodey asked quietly when no-one else seemed capable of replying.
come from? He’d purposefully banished all thoughts of Stark from his mind; if he were alive, he would have been back by now, and Steve refused to contemplate the idea that his body might be floating around somewhere in the vastness of space. He didn’t know Stark very well, but he knew enough that dying in space had been a very resounding no-no for him.
Aunt Tasha got to him first with a flying kick right to the face. Blood spurted from Peter’s nose and he whimpered, staggering backwards up the stairs. It was no use – he hurt all over and was getting clumsy, managing to fall backwards to land right on his ass. Uncle Clint managed to snag his ankle and started to tug him down the stairs; Peter had enough energy left to grab onto the bannister and hold on for dear life, which turned out to be a terrible mistake because it left his body open to getting punched and kicked.
“They’re here,” Natasha cut his rambling off, and they both got to their feet. “Turn the magic mumbo jumbo off.”
“Oh,” Cap looked a little guilty. “It wouldn’t let us in when we tried to get you out, so I… I had to tear it apart. We hid the parts under your bed.”
“Of course,” Tony sighed, though he didn’t believe him.
Tony cleared his throat, surprised, and grinned tightly when Steve blushed a deep red and gently pushed the girl away from him. To her credit, she didn’t seem the least bit embarrassed, going so far as to pull a scrap of paper obviously containing a phone number from her bra and tuck it into the waistband of Steve’s pants.
“I’m surprised you even know his name,” Flash snorted. “Nobody else does. Looks like he got lunch for his
He was basically dressed in a TV box. Tony had cut off the flaps so Peter could wriggle his little body through it, and had then attached two strips of material to either side of the top to hold the box in place over Peter’s shoulders. Together, they’d cut two holes in the sides for Peter’s arms, and had then repurposed some toilet paper tubes to make arms and claws. It had taken a few moments to think, but Tony had then gone back to the cut off box flaps and had reshaped them into caterpillar tracks to stick onto the sides of the main box.
“James, hi,” Natasha smiled, leaning into the hug that Bucky wrapped her in. She reached up on her tiptoes to kiss him on the lips, and he came away smiling like a goof.
Despite the weirdness of the whole situation, Tony felt light and happy for the whole rest of the day thanks to Steve.
“Because I love you,” he replied eventually, forcing himself towards the door. “It’s
“Want to tell me what the hell is going on here?” he asked, taking pity on the poor guy. He looked like he was five seconds away from spontaneously combusting. “Wanna tell me where the rest of my armour is? And why I look like a patchwork quilt? And, for that matter, where the hell I am -”
Kicking his chair out of the way, Peter turned and ran from the kitchen, not stopping until he was safely in the elevator heading for the penthouse and the sanctuary of his bedroom. In the confined space of the elevator, he finally let frustrated tears fall and a sob escape his lips.
“Yes, Tony, it’s still in my phone, exactly where he left it,” Natasha rolled her eyes. “Now shut up and stop wriggling on top of my boob.”
He was in
Clint signed silently, a small, worried smile playing at the corners of his lips.
That was where Steve had come in. It had honestly been kind of a drunken mistake, but one that he had been secretly glad of ever since. Bucky had come in late one night, drunk off his ass from drinks at the bar with some work friends, and in a terrible mood. All the guys had either taken girlfriends or one night stands home with them, and Bucky had been left without. He wasn’t even sure why he was in such a bad mood about that, just that he was sick of the same old routine. He was sick of one night stands, sick of relationships that didn’t last, so… in his drunken state, he had wished for a soulmate, something constant, and Steve had appeared.
Rhodey nodded, took another swig of the whiskey in front of him. With a mechanical creak, he got to his feet, pistons whirring on his new legs as they took his weight. Steve marvelled for a moment at, once again, just how intelligent Tony Stark really was. Really had been.
“Sure,” Clint replied easily, pointing to a door off the entrance hall. “You wanna go through there, take your first left, second right, up two flights of stairs, belay the third… though i’m not sure if you still have to climb the walls up there. Oh well, Peter usually manages it when he comes over. You’ll find it, don’t worry.”
“They’re…” He had to clear his throat before he spoke. “They’re sure it’s him?”
Buck frowned. “I – he said something about a guy coming out of your apartment a couple mornings ago?”
“How are you all doing tonight?” Tony screamed into the microphone, and grinned helplessly as thousands of people screamed back at him.
“You’re a bully,” Tony grumbled, awkwardly shifting in his seat so he could hold the guitar properly. “Hmm, okay -”
“We, um…” For a second, Tony seemed to falter, obviously caught up between his new friendship and the fact Peter was his son. “We met at a summer camp last year. A, uh, math camp.”
“My baby,” his Pops whispered, and reached out to cup Peter’s face.
“But that’s just the thing,” Cap frowned, azure eyes sparkling a little in the artificial light. “You’re not like the other villains we’ve fought before. You don’t kill people, for one thing.”
But despite the confusion over Iron Man’s motives, he had a pretty good life. He was a rich, eligible bachelor who could have his pick of anyone he wanted, he owned a multi-billion dollar company that was at the forefront of clean energy, and he got to secretly atone for all the trouble he had caused, no matter what the news and the government and the whole damn world thought of Iron Man.
“I don’t…” Tony really didn’t know what to say, how to say in words what he was feeling in his chest. “He –
Cap huffed out a laugh, and then turned to the door. “You sure are something, Iron Man. I’ll get that cellphone for you.”
As he sat in his seat, Peter lifted his arms next to him and started wiggling forwards into his lap for a cuddle. Never one to deny his kids what they wanted, even though they were really big enough to sit on their own seats at meals, Tony grabbed him under his armpits and shifted him quickly onto his lap.
“He’s not?” Tony replied, glancing over people’s heads to try and get a peek at the apple bobbing station. He couldn’t really see. “What’s Jimmy doing, kiddo?”
He was their son.
“- covered in blood, honey, Jesus,” Tony was saying, stuttering, looking terrified. “Steve?”
He also found himself with the apartment to himself a few nights a week while Natasha went out with Bucky and ended up at his place. Normally he would have tagged along, but between trying to keep himself out of sight and having to watch Natasha and Bucky eye-fuck each other, he found he really wasn’t all that interested. Instead, he stayed in and caught up on some TV he’d been meaning to watch, all the while fixing up Natasha’s electronics; he liked to tinker.
She had been pretty angry regardless.
“Of course he did,” Tony hummed, pulling both himself and James into a sitting position with another groan. He certainly wasn’t a young man anymore. “You know why he sent you? Because you weigh a tonne, kid, and I’m fairly certain he wants to suffocate me -”
“Noo!” James squealed as Tony padded into the room and stopped at the stove for a kiss from Steve.
And now Tony was dead. Maybe it had been the snap, maybe he had been obliterated by Thanos himself, but if he were alive Steve knew they would have heard from him by now. Earth’s best defender, snuffed out like so many others.
“We need a slide,” Clint replied seriously. “There are too many sets of stairs in this place. We need a slide, and it needs to be yellow and twisty, and it needs to lead into a ball pit at the end.”
Tony sighed again, and shrugged. “I mean, that may be
“I didn’t do nothin’,” Peter grumbled, and Steve reached out to pat the top of his head reassuringly.
But then he heard an all too familiar voice.
“We need a distraction,” Steve decided, throwing an arm out to stop anyone stepping out into plain sight where HYDRA goons could be watching. “Natasha, you’re good at sneaking into places, right?”
FRIDAY continued,
,” Tony insisted. “I just… I’m trying to do the adult thing for once, here.”
“Sure,” he replied instead, heading over to a comfortable looking chair opposite Rogers’ own at the desk.
“The Time Stone might,” came Bruce’s voice from the door, and everyone looked up. “I’m not going to pretend to know how it works, but you all saw Thanos using it in Wakanda. There has to be a way to harness that power.”
“Sure, um, can I pull my truck inside, or – never mind, I’ll just leave it here.”
Steve nodded serenely, completely unphased by Tony’s dry wit. “And what do you think, Mr. Stark?”
“So… I can’t buy a university?” Rogers sighed. “What about if I bought a plot of land big enough to build a new university?”
“Okay,” Tony called, forcing himself to tear his eyes away from Steve’s apartment before he started snooping further than he already had. “Um… have a good day, Steve!”
The path was lined on either side with huge, hulking bushes artfully cut into the shape of animals – and eagle, hawk, spider, etc. He admired them as he passed, but didn’t slow down; the faster he got this meeting done with, the faster he could go home.
“This is a pretty nice place,” Rhodey admitted as he put the boxes down on the kitchen counter. “Are you sure you’re okay living completely by yourself?”
Bruce had prepped for surgery by throwing a clean sheet over the pool table, of all things, and was instructing Thor to lay Pietro down on it when Steve entered the building. Quickly running his hands under the facet behind the bar, Bruce ran over and started looking Pietro over whilst everyone gathered around.
He grabbed the front of Steve’s shirt, eyes crazy, and for a moment Steve thought he was going to hit him, when –
to make you forget all your troubles.”
“We still need to find some more cardboard to make your eyes,” Tony hummed, still very much in build mode. “You want them to go on top of your head like a hat, or over your eyes like a mask?”
. Shit, can you imagine -?”
infected children.”
Tony thought about lying for a moment. It really wasn’t any of Steve’s business why he was there, after all. But then again… Steve seemed like a nice guy. Maybe they could work something out?
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve grumbled. “Of course I’ll go out to dinner with you.”
“No, he’s –“ Tony paused mid-sentence as a blaring noise suddenly started outside. “What the –?“
“Don’t need another one of

and he honestly didn’t know how they managed to pull it off.
“I, uh, I think I need a little help with the choreography in Marian, The Librarian,” Tony told him, eyebrows drawn together as though he were nervous, though that, of course, was a ridiculous thought. Why would Tony be nervous about speaking to Steve?
“Who dares spoil my Sunday morning lie in?” he rumbled, refusing to open his eyes, and smiled when he heard a little giggle come from the body on top of him. “
“Frigga!” came a booming, authoritative voice from the stairs behind him. Cursing his inquisitive nature for probably getting him killed, Tony came skidding to a stop in the archway and looked back over his shoulder.
“I wash, you dry?” Steve suggested, and Tony nodded his head.
And then there he was. Appearing from the rubble on extremely unsteady feet, Tony Stark set foot on planet Earth for the first time in weeks. He looked dazed, bewildered, and had to rest a hand on the woman’s shoulder to steady himself for a moment. Another woman exited what remained of the ship after him, and Steve had to rub his eyes for a moment because… because she was entirely blue. And also looked like a robot.
Instead, a roar echoed through the house and the basement door blew off its hinges as Hulk burst through into the room.
See, that was another thing. He and Steve had kinda been married for the past six years, had been dating for four before that. They both sort of had a reputation to uphold, though, so they been keeping it a secret. The rest of the band knew, of course, and their management teams knew, and they all agreed – there was absolutely nothing rock and roll about a married man, never mind a man married to another man. They understood it – of course they did – because half of the appeal of the band was that young women could fantasize about sleeping with them. Was it particularly fair or just? No. It made sure they could pay the bills, though.
“Yeah,” he agreed. “Yes, it’s a plan – the only one we have right now.”
Yep, definitely crazy.
“Hey, I’ll have you know that I do perfectly well for myself -”
When Tony woke up, it was because there was a strange weight on his chest. Groaning aloud, he reached up and caught the little hand pressing down against his pec, sending the small body sat on top of him toppling forwards with a squeak of surprise.
With all the effort he could muster, one word fell from his lips.
Steve paused for a moment, obviously thinking about his options, but ultimately took Tony’s hand and let him transport them both back to Natasha’s apartment.
FRIDAY concluded.
“They do not,” Tony confirmed, grunting as his foot got caught in his pants leg. “I’ve just got to pack up the armour, wait until the coast is clear, and then I’m getting the hell out of dodge. I’ll be back in Malibu… well, I dunno. Can you send the plane over?”
Despite the absurdity of the situation, Tony found himself leaning in a little to get a better look at the tiny chameleon. He
Steve shut down all thoughts regarding Stark immediately. It wouldn’t help to dwell on a man who was most certainly dead – he had to focus on the here and now, and how they were going to get out of this mess.
“My brave boy,” he murmured against Peter’s forehead. “You’re safe now.”
“Not a word,” he mumbled, though he allowed Steve to wrap an arm around him as he rejoined their group.
again.
“You can keep your head down, not cause trouble, and blend in with the wallpaper until Pops and the others figure out how to turn you back,” Peter told him seriously. “I’m not messing around, Da– Tony.”
“Jeez, you met the guy once and you’re already talking forever,” Tony grimaced, shuddering at the mere thought. “No, I didn’t get a look. He’s probably one of those by the book guys; I won’t get to meet him until it’s all official.”
“Because… because you don’t do you’re fuckin’ job,” she replied, slurring her words just slightly in her passion. “I don’t even care about the soulmate – I don’t care if I never find someone, but

Peter ignored his voice, and then scrunched his eyes shut when he heard the door click open and closed again, and felt a dip in his bed as his Dad sat down.
He only knew about the SHIELD issued safe house two blocks from the Tower because he’d “accidentally” broken into his Dad’s secure server and found a couple of files. It was the first place he could think of that might actually be safe, so while the Avengers were snarling and frothing at the mouth, he slipped away, changed into his street clothes thanks to one of his many backpacks hidden around the city, and – Spider-Man costume stuffed into his hoodie pocket – headed straight there.
“Steve…” Bruce was already shaking his head.
“Can I copy your homework?” Tony asked him pleadingly. “Please?”
And for himself.
Tony looked at him, and then silently pointed to whatever was in the case. Steve took a step forwards, and felt the breath leave his body once he realised what Tony had found.
“I can’t promise that,” Tony started, grumbling when Natasha tapped him on the forehead with her icy bottle of water as she passed to get to the armchair. “But I’ll try my best, I guess.”
“Good to know,” Tony hummed, leaning up on his tip-toes to peck Steve’s lips. He grimaced. “Ew, you taste like sweat, shame, and a potentially under-age girl’s lip gloss.”

specifically she found her soulmate, but ten years had passed since then. Natasha’s friends and colleagues were starting to settle down, whether it be with soulmates or otherwise, and she had never really been one to follow the crowd, but even Tony could see that one night stands just weren’t really doing it for her anymore.
“Don’t,” Tony shook his head. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”
“Stop freaking out,” Steve murmured against his ear. “It’s not a bad thing. We’ve both just grown into it, is all, and it’s nice to sit back every once in a while and observe.”
