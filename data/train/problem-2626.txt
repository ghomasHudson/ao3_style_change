“Why aren’t you?” Dean repeated. “Single, I mean. Like, I know you’re single, but why aren’t you—why, uh—you—fuck, I ain’t good at this chick-flick shit. I mean, like, why aren’t you
, was the first thing Castiel wanted to say. It was the easiest thing to say, the most obvious. It made sense, and it required no emotional examination on his part. Saying no would be a lie, though.
Despite his mental self-assurance, it was with a sick feeling in his stomach that Dean approached his soulmate. Luckily, Michael saw him coming before he could make the awkward entrance into the circle of people.
“Good,” Castiel said, suitably appeased. “That is all. I promise I’ll stay with you more. It is no hardship, I assure you.”
There was still no comment from Cas as Dean quietly got off the bed where he’d been sitting and walked over to the one Castiel was seated on. Castiel shifted forward so his knees were a few inches from the edge, giving Dean room to lay down over his lap and settle. Castiel paused for a moment, feeling the sensation of the human draped over his legs, quiet and warm and shifting every few seconds.
“Think about it,” Balthazar said, sipping casually at Castiel’s lemonade. He finished it with a great, gulping slurp. “I don’t know all the specifics of your relationship with your friend. I don’t know whether the risk is worth it or not. But I can tell you from my side of the table that it looks pretty worth it to me. That’s for you to decide, though. Not me.”
“No,” Castiel admitted. “I did not know you could make fire with rocks and sticks.” He paused, thinking back to the woods. “The deer you were hunting, the one that I killed. How did you get it to stand still? It was… It was just standing there.”
“I said he was no son of mine!” John screamed at his friend. His eyes were wild, fixed on Dean with a manic kind of intensity. "Say you'll kill that dragon of yours, and I'll spare you. Say it."
The pain in his back was building. Dean remembered the torture techniques Bobby had taught him when he was younger. He bit his lip and focused on that pain, his mind zeroing in on the sting of his teeth in the softness of his lip instead of the tearing of the skin on his back. He tried to focus on Castiel, too, on the warmth of his scales and the smell of wind and sunshine and rain that seemed to cling to him. Dean missed his dragon. He focused on that hurt, too.
Alastair would surely be after him. It had been no secret that Castiel believed the Dragon-Slayer, the legendary Crown Prince of Lawrence, would end the war. All accusations would surely point to him. Whether or not the other dragons would choose to defend Castiel was entirely up to them.
Azazel, who had murdered Dean’s mother all those years ago, was the eldest. Asmodeus, whom Dean had killed with a single arrow and a broken longbow, was next. Alastair was the only one still alive.
Also, Castiel had saved his ass. Saved him from Alastair and given him warm clothes and weapons to hunt for himself. He might have been an asshole, but Dean still owed him a blood debt. And he wasn’t about to let these grubby-fingered shit-shovelers from some no-name village get their hands on the dragon.
He went through his nightly routine without really thinking of it. It was late and he was tired too, but his mind was mostly occupied with thoughts of Dean.
at me, you should b-be so, so mad at me. You should hit me. Why haven’t you hit me yet?” Dean finally opened his eyes, looking pleadingly through a sheen of tears at the Dom that was still petting him like he wasn’t being the most disrespectful brat ever right now.
There was something else there, something that was triggered by the memory of what Michael had said when they’d gone to dinner a while back. It scared Dean so bad that he didn’t even want to think of anything close to it. Especially not right now, with Cas warm and sweet-smelling and perfect beside him.
Other than that, welcome! Hello! This is chapter two, and it will be fun. The boys are stupid. Very, very stupid. And very stubborn. :)
“Dean, you said that and you know it. Who’s walking you home?” Sam asked. Dean winced, anticipating the excited rise to his brother’s voice before it even happened. “Who is it? Is it a guy?”
As it turned out… not much. The citizens still bickered good-naturedly in the streets. The alleys still baked under the heat of the sun. Hawks and birds still circled overhead, some perching on the roofs of nearby shops or houses to look for prey in the form of garbage of rats. The castle still loomed a mile or so ahead, sitting at the center of the city proper.
Dean was ready with the Impala car keys and a big grin on his face when Castiel emerged. “You look great,” he said. His eyes fell on Castiel’s neck, and amusement flashed across his face. “C’mere, let me fix that for you.”
Castiel, fighting against the tug in his chest, slowly backed out of the room and made to close the door behind himself. As he did so, he snuck one last glance at Dean, then stopped dead.
What had happened? Had he and Michael had an argument? That seemed like the most plausible explanation. Castiel remembered what Dean had said about maybe needing to lose weight and clenched his hands into fists, accidentally sending a spurt of toothpaste across the bathroom counter.
“I heard you!” their neighbor called angrily. She took a hobbling step toward her porch stairs, glaring at Dean, hands on her cane. She raised one of them to wave it at the rainy night sky. “The whole damned neighborhood heard you! That noise is horrendous, I tell you! Horrendous! Ugly, raucous planes flying this way and that all day, well I tell you
Dean squeezed his hand, his grip loosening as his strength faded. “Don’t… Do-Don’t… leave.” His words were slurring heavily now. Castiel’s heart clenched in his chest. He leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss on Dean’s forehead instinctively.
Castiel cursed internally. He had breaststroke today. He hated breaststroke. He glanced over to see what Dean had and was surprised to see how pale his teammate was. Dean looked like he was going to be sick, his green eyes scanning the list fervently.
“Did you know,” Cam said right at Dean’s shoulder, startling him. Castiel, who was just as close on Cam’s other side, jumped too, “that the school gives us each forty dollars to spend on whatever snacks or supplies we need?” He grinned wickedly.
“I’m ‘all good,’” Castiel assures, using air quotes just so he can see the amusement make Dean’s lips twitch upward.
“It’s really crazy,” she says as they’re leaving. “Humans are so touch-starved, it isn’t even funny. It’s probably why we’re all so grumpy and tired all the time.” Castiel frowns at that, glancing at the front door where Dean is already waiting. He looks both grumpy
He was silent the whole time. After the initial questioning in the hallway, Castiel seemed to realize that Dean wasn’t coherent enough to answer many questions. He was still freezing cold and achy all over, but now Dean felt like he was almost in a sort of shock. His head and face throbbed, but only distantly. He felt and heard everything as if it were hundreds of miles away from him.
“You have obviously been crying. You’re upset. I’m… I’m concerned for your wellbeing and your emotional health. Did something happen with Michael?” Castiel asked, tentative. “Is everything alright between you two?”
For a moment, everything seemed like a little too much. Dean’s throat closed up, his chest tightening in a familiar manner that made his brain scramble with panic. He forced himself to open his shoulders a little and breathe. He couldn’t have a panic attack while driving. Panic attacks were stupid anyway, no matter what Castiel told him. Besides, it wasn’t like Michael was asking Dean to give him his firstborn child or something. It was just a dinner. Dean needed to stop being stupid and selfish and start actually thinking of other people for once.
, on some level. Dean had never been held and allowed to cry freely before, or at least, not with anyone else. Castiel was his safe place. Castiel was his angel.
The dragon laughed, the sound rough and joyous. Castiel’s laugh was beautiful. Like water attracting water, it drew Dean’s laugh out of him too. For a moment, he could only feel pure mirth and joy at his closeness to the dragon. Soon, though, that was dampened by the pain that began to throb from Dean’s back, his injuries reminding him that they were there. He broke off with a soft curse, hand twitching toward his back as if touching it would make the pain go away.
Castiel remembered training with Lucifer and Michael, how Michael had laughed at Castiel’s uselessness in the snow.
In a matter of seconds, the dragon was in human shape. His clothes, warm and simple, had been taken from a human merchant carrying many others like it. After knocking the man out, Castiel had tried on different clothes and taken all that had fit him, disappearing into the night before the man could wake.
“Very, unfortunately,” Castiel replied, sighing at the boy coming in for another flip-turn in Dean’s lane. Dean wrote down the times, smiling a little as the next split became a 0:46. Ketch really
So he saw the warning look. He saw the answering realization on Dean’s face as he wiped blood off his cheek and gave Sam a shaky smile. He put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder as the boys were climbing into Dean’s beloved car to drive back to the motel.
for him. He would have been, if it hadn’t been for the ugly jealousy that reared up in his chest at the thought of some other jerk with their hands all over Dean. “Who?” he demanded, something hostile and cold in his own voice.
The order is soft, but an order nonetheless. Dean’s gaze snaps to Castiel’s on instinct. The angel’s hands are gentle on Dean’s shoulders as he looks at him, eyes steady and assessing. Dean swallows, shoving the confession out before he can stop himself. “I wanted to hug you.”
I have a feeling I'll have to address the way Castiel is approaching this problem soon, but that day is not today! Enjoy the story. ;)
Dean didn’t even have time to say hello to her, because the boy in her stall was turning and his familiar hazel eyes were widening with recognition.
He turned so his back was to Dean, facing the wall of the motel. He didn’t want to know if Dean had sensed that movement. He didn’t want to know what Dean was thinking. He didn’t want to know if it was his own stupid, selfish hope or if it had been real, actual longing in Dean’s green eyes when he’d seen Castiel pulling the pillows out from beneath the sheets.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbled, reaching for the glass Castiel had gotten for him. He alternated between drinking soup and drinking water, the trembling in his hands abating as the food entered his body. Though his internal thermometer seemed to have been turned up a few degrees, the blanket and the hot soup was nice.
Once again, a HUGE thank you to Phantom31615. Give them some love in the comments, their art is awesome. ;) Thank you to both Confused_SPN_Fan and Phantom31615 for the art. You guys spoil me.
“Fuck that!” Dean shouted. “Your fucking greater good is the extinction of my species! You’re forgetting, dickwad, that our species were
Alastair’s spiked tail whipped past, nearly clipping Castiel’s left side. The Dragon King's enormous corpse was becoming a very real danger. Still, despite the flailing wings and spiked tail, Castiel dared not maneuver out of the way, lest he lose the proximity and speed he had gained. He was getting unbearably close to Dean now, and even closer to the place where he wouldn’t be able to stop them from smashing into the ground.
“Don’t… Don’t go far, alright?” Jo asked, looking a little anxious. “Please? Stay in the courtyard, at least.”
“Exactly. And that’s how I know when you’re lying.” To Castiel’s shock, he could see real tears in Gabriel’s eyes, tears he didn’t think he’d ever seen in his jokester of an older brother, even when their father had been hit by a train. Gabriel... he really believed this.
Dean swallowed, wondering who the fuck had given Castiel the right to have puppy dog eyes like that. “N-No, man, it’s fine. Seriously, Cas. I’m okay.” Castiel continued looking at him with a half-pleading, half-desperately-concerned look. Dean sighed. “I’ll put some Goddamn ice on it, if that makes you feel better.”
He was shocked when the merman didn’t protest, just nodded his head ever so slightly. His green eyes still looked terrified, his injured gills still flaring desperately.
The first person to do that was a British man in a strange imitation of a suit. He was wearing dark pants and a dark jacket, but his shirt was like one of the band tees Dean wore and his pants were really dark jeans with an outrageous buckle on them. He looked a lot older than Castiel, perhaps in his forties, but Castiel really didn’t care. Instead of heading home after his shift, he agreed to sit down in the corner and eat lunch with the man.
The extra weight was beginning to become apparent. Castiel was out of shape. He was way better than he had been when he’d first rescued Dean, of course, but he was nowhere near the military-grade endurance Ishim surely had. One way or another, this chase was going to end very soon.
With a huff of breath, the dragon dove off the edge of the cliff, carrying Dean’s broken scream with him.
“Who is it?” Dean asked, even as he walked over to the sink to wash the sugar and molasses off his hands.
After what felt like an eternity, Castiel worked up the courage to shift and pull at the first pillow. The fabric of the pillowcase and the fabric of the sheets made it harder than necessary to yank it out from under the covers. After a moment, Dean helped too, grabbing a pillow for himself so that they both had two.
“Roasted roadkill. You’d look like my mama’s Sunday special,” Benny said. He gave Castiel a small smile. “Good thing we make an acceptable team.”
“Sorry, Sammy. I had things I was doing. School and shit.” He smiled at Sam’s grumbling, knowing his brother couldn’t argue when he had ‘school and shit’ of his own. “How’s it going, kiddo? Did you get past that lawyer exam?”
He’d trained hard as a young dragon, trying to make up for something he’d been born with. He’d become the best fighter of his age group, using methods that were unconventional and played to his strengths. No one could match him in the air, and his skills with his claws and teeth made him nearly unstoppable in melee combat.
Also, happy holidays! Only a few more days until Christmas, which I celebrate. Does anyone celebrate anything different? If so, please tell me about it! I love learning new things. :)
In front of the entrance of the cave, bow bent with the force of the arrow being pulled back, a green-eyed prince knelt. His eyes glowed in the light of the torches behind Castiel, anger and rage twisting his features. He bared his teeth in a snarl as he fired again.
Dean nodded at Castiel’s question, shoulders relaxing slightly. “Yeah, Cas. I’m good.” He was fine, now. He felt better here. He could see that Castiel wasn’t entirely convinced, though, so he let the corners of his mouth tick up in a confident smile and said, “I could definitely eat, though. Is that pie I smell?”
Dean was nervous, since he was immediately lumped into the ‘faster’ half of varsity. In fact, Coach Singer put him right next to Castiel, with the dark-haired captain in the sixth lane and Dean in the fifth. Dean tried not to panic as the rest of the varsity team lined up outside their individual lanes, each holding a clipboard so they could record the split times. While he was fairly fast and had good form, he was by no means a long-distance swimmer. He wasn’t built for swimming more than a thousand meters.
Castiel nodded, swallowing his uncertainty. He was just a little on edge because he was worried about the merman, he reminded himself. They were legendary, creatures of myth and fear. It was no surprise he was frightened. He just needed to keep his head. He couldn’t lose this opportunity. It was amazing. He was one of the first few doctors to ever examine a merperson, and the first ever to do so on a live one.
Dean shrugged, feeling a little awkward. “What, were you expecting something un-say-able? Your name is worse than mine.”
“I couldn’t help myself,” Castiel murmured, almost as if it was something to be ashamed of. Dean squeezed his hands gently to convey that he understood, that he didn’t care, that his Alpha was loved. They both had bad days. Sometimes Dean woke up screaming. Sometimes Castiel begged his brother for forgiveness in his sleep. Sometimes Dean needed to make a ham sandwich and sit with Castiel at three in the morning, eating silently. Sometimes, Castiel needed to strap on knife sheaths he hadn’t used in years just to feel like he and Dean were safe.
Dean rolled his eyes, an amused smile on his lips. “Sounds good, Captain O. C’mon, let’s get outta here.” He checked his phone, where the navigation robot lady was already attempting to direct them to the highway. “We’re about four hours out. Three if I push it.”
He laughed at his own stupidity, one of his tears breaking free as he blew on the bacon to cool it and try again. It was delicious, just as greasy and salty and hearty as he remembered.
He didn’t know why the suggestion hurt so much. It was natural, normal, even expected. This was Dean, Castiel’s
He didn’t hear the end of Dean’s song before the world went dark and he fell forward, into the cold embrace of the sea.
He waited, staring straight into Diego’s gleaming dark eyes. When the man finally gave a tiny nod of acquiescence, Dean released him, slipping the knife into his pocket. It wasn’t a bad blade, and he could use every weapon he could get.
“Mornin’, angel,” Dean said. His voice was raspy and deep, as if he hadn’t spoken since he’d risen from the bed that morning. “Everything okay?”
It reminded Dean that even though he was in love with Cas, Cas wasn’t in love with him. Neither of them had said a word about the Fourth of July, when they’d held hands nearly the entire time they’d been watching the fireworks. Part of Dean was convinced they wouldn’t ever talk about it. Maybe he was the one that was being overly interpretive. Cas probably just saw it as a casual thing. It was Dean that was making everything weird.
“Sure,” Sam said. “They legalized it in 2015. It’s kinda surprising how many people marry other people who aren’t their soulmates. Not a bad thing, of course.”
“Morning, Dean,” Garth greeted from behind the counter. He had flour smudged on his left cheekbone and something distinctly chocolate smeared on his apron, but he still smiled brightly as Dean came in. “How are you?”
Dean wouldn’t have forced himself upon his friend anyway. Crashing at someone’s place without asking first was kind of a douchebag move, and contrary to his actions over the past few months, Dean wasn’t a complete douchebag. At least, he thought he wasn’t.
“Uh, I’m… I’m here with Michael,” he said. At her blank face, he scrambled to tack on a last name, knowing that last names were super important to these people for some reason. “Uh, M-Michael Angeles, sorry.”
was what he was supposed to do. He’d have to remember that for next time. Jesus, he felt like an idiot.
The other thing that was bothering Castiel, something that he didn’t even want to think of the possibilities of, was the bruise on Dean’s cheek. Dean’s story made sense, Castiel supposed, but he couldn’t shake the horrible feeling that Dean was lying to him. The possible other reasons for the bruise made Castiel sick.
in the valley.” She eyed him with dark, intelligent eyes. “I didn’t want to believe them, when they said that the fire mark on Ishim’s body was only hot enough to be bluefire. I was hoping you’d just flown east and weren’t even here anymore. It seems I was wrong to hope, wasn’t I?”
things. Awful things. He'd hit Dean, hurt him. He’d called Dean a pest. He’d told him to leave. He’d seen the pain, the tears, in Dean’s eyes.
“Fascinating,” the doctor said, seeming unfazed by the curse that had been thrown at him. “You have your own language, too. It’s beautiful.” He smiled sincerely at Dean, then backed up a step with a wince. “I apologize, you’re asking me to leave. I should give you some privacy now. I assume you’re tired.”
Castiel’s knife buried itself a few inches from Luke’s crotch, the blade vibrating with how hard he’d thrown it. Michael cursed. “Fucking
For some strange reason, Castiel mourned the loss. He’d enjoyed the hours of being close to Dean, trading stories with him and listening to his beautiful laughter bounce off the walls of the bathroom. The press of Dean’s body against his in the confined space had also been a factor. A very enjoyable factor. Not that Castiel thought about it that much, of course.
It wasn’t. Dean had seen the enormous winged lizard he turned into. It was enough to give him nightmares for days. Not that Dean could tell when it was day and night here, of course. The passage of time in this cave was a mystery to him.
“No,” Castiel said, feeling an odd trickle of regret at the word. He hesitated, then added, “Not yet.”
“Look at his eyes,” Cas directed gently. Castiel did, taking in the hazy green. “Do you understand this? Do you know the enormity of the power you have been given? Dean trusts you. He’s vulnerable right now, because he trusts you to take care of him. That is a very precious trust. Please, don’t ever betray it.” There was something weighted in the other angel’s words now, a heaviness that bespoke old wounds and pain that hadn’t quite faded, even with time. “Please, Castiel. You must promise me that you’ll take care of Dean the way he deserves.”
Dean’s eyes were squeezed shut, his body flat against Castiel’s neck, legs and arms wrapped tightly around the dragon as far as they would go. He was begging, shouting into the wind, voice torn roughly from his throat. Air whistled past, quiet now, ruffling his hair and tugging lightly at every flap of clothing and slightly-extended limb.
He heard Jo following him back to the changing room. He went into the little changing pod before she could say anything, not wanting her sympathy right now, kind as she was trying to be. He just wanted to get changed, pay for the suit, and go home.
Dean paused just outside the gates of the village, realizing just how out of his depth he was about to be.
Benny followed from a respectful distance away, which Castiel could at least slightly appreciate. He still snarled threateningly at the man when they got to the infirmary though, a last warning of what was to come if Dean was harmed. Benny gave Castiel a nod, like he understood.
If Dean looked up everything there was to know about Arizona State afterward, well... no one had to know.
Before he could give his very interesting answer, someone pounded on his door. Dean and Castiel both jolted with surprise, the intimate, warm atmosphere of the room dispersing. Dean cursed inwardly. “What?” he demanded, knowing it was likely Sammy or Jo.
“Not likely,” Castiel said. Missouri’s eyebrows raised in surprise. The dragon hastened to explain. “Most of the dragon armies are spread thin fighting at different fronts in the war. If you hadn’t noticed, Human Kingdom Tran has been pressuring hard in the west. Alastair doesn’t have many willing fighters back home, and even less that he trusts deeply enough to have his back in a fight. He will likely bring four or five dragons with him, just in case anything goes sour.”
“I suppose I got scared,” Castiel said quietly. “Dragons… We’re supposed to hate your kind. We’re not supposed to want anything to do with you. We’re also not supposed to feel emotion, to want only to kill and fight.”
“When I was a child, I lived in Eden, North Carolina,” Castiel said, breaking the heavy quiet. “While it wasn’t nearly as hot as this, it was almost always humid. My parents were incredibly frugal. Though our house had heating and air conditioning, it was rarely used. Sometimes, the heat was so intolerable that my siblings and I would go to a movie theater or a grocery store and hide out in the air conditioning.” A small smile quirked at his lips. “Some of my favorite memories were made while hiding from the heat.”
Dean felt better when they’d reached the kitchen, when he had an array of food in front of him to try to figure out how to put together. Food. He could make food. He could... he could make sandwiches.
As Dean fought, ducking and parrying, slicing through skin and tendons, he felt old muscles and instincts reawakening. There was a reason he’d been the best sword fighter in his kingdom.
He was glaring at Castiel, but the dragon paused. There was something about his eyes and his face that didn’t match up. Thanks to being around Dean so much, the dragon found it easier to read human expressions. This man was afraid, but was trying to cover it up with a facade of anger and glee, like his friends. Castiel had seen that expression on Dean once or twice before.
He got up, realizing he wasn’t going to be getting any more sleep. Castiel stretched, the joints in his arms and wings popping as he extended them fully. It had been a while since he’d slept as a human. He didn’t mind it, but it made him more vulnerable.
He reached for his belt, fingering over the empty loops until he came to an arrow. As he pulled it out, Dean realized it was his last one.
Dean’s throat was tight. He still felt like crying, but he forced himself to take a deep breath and turn around. He was almost home. Then he could take a shower, change into some comfortable clothes, and hopefully get something to eat. He’d probably feel a lot better after that.
“Yeah?” came Dean’s response. He poked his head out from around the armory door, his fire-protection visor down over his eyes.
“Mmm, well that won’t be a challenge,” Castiel murmurs. He leans up to kiss Dean on the forehead, then reaches down between his own thighs to grab at his throbbing cock. “Ohh, Dean. You’re such a good boy for me.”
“Of course not,” Castiel said, frowning. “That would be exceedingly rude. I simply took it and gave it to Gabriel. I don’t know what I was supposed to do with it, anyway.”
Cas must have brought him to bed somehow. Dean frowned, wondering how he’d done that. Castiel wasn’t weak in the slightest, but Dean was heavy and there was no way his roommate had lifted him up and carried him here. At least, not that Dean thought. Castiel was constantly surprising him. The thought of Castiel lifting him up and carrying him to bed made something in his stomach tingle. He pushed the feeling away immediately.
Of all the things Dean does—cooking and cleaning and putting his safety and life on the line for Castiel—this act of submission, of
“Well, maybe I am!” Castiel shouted back, unable to believe that Dean actually cared that much about the stupid idiot who’d been sending flowers and chocolate. Fine. If Dean wanted to be an asshole, Castiel would be one too.
Dean’s moan vibrated underneath Castiel’s lips, making them tingle lightly. Castiel kept sucking even as he pulled out and thrust in again, then again, then again. Dean’s hand came up to clamp across his back, to bring Castiel’s hips into his body harder than before. Castiel growled into the bruised skin of his throat and accepted the challenge, snapping his hips forward with as much force as he could manage.
Eventually, Dean drifted off to sleep. Castiel cleaned him up and tucked him into bed, following murmured directions from Cas. He was beginning to understand how this worked. Cas promised that it would get clearer as time went on and he understood his charge more. He promised that Castiel and Dean would grow closer, as long as they were kind to each other.
Castiel turned to Dean, eyes glowing bright blue now. Dean could see light blue peeking through the gaps of his throat, a reminder of the furnace he had in his chest. Dean could feel the heat coming off his dragon as he stepped close. It was a comforting thing, especially when they got higher and the air became colder. Down here, it was just on the right side of too hot.
Castiel seemed to get some form of the message. He gave a short nod and rolled out his shoulders, wings fluttering in the darkness. “Alright. Are they planning on watching the entire thing?”
?” Michael asked mockingly as Castiel retreated into the apartment. “The loving soulmate, or the jealous roommate? Because I can tell you right now, it’s not gonna be y—”
“That’s why you can’t keep breathing, even if you’re spitting fire?” Dean asked. “I always wondered why you guys wouldn’t just keep feeding the flames.”
Stumbling a little as he exited his room, Castiel ducked out into the hallway and tossed his shirt to the ground, irritated by the feeling of the fabric on his skin. His pants went next, thrown somewhere in the hallway as Castiel staggered God-knew-where. He figured it out four seconds later when he yanked the door of the guest room open and found himself enveloped in the lingering scent of an Omega in heat. Not just any Omega, either.
Castiel reflected that he was very grateful for his sister. She alone, out of the many dragons Castiel had known in his childhood, had never judged him. Anna was one of the only dragons Castiel had ever had true respect for, save for Gabriel and Gadreel. Anna wasn’t judging him now, either. She was just patiently waiting. Castiel knew, somewhere deep inside himself, that if he suddenly
I hope you liked the chapter. Can you guys tell I hate John Winchester? Maybe just a little? Yeah, that man pisses me off like no other.
They laid there for a moment, just breathing in each other’s scents. Castiel closed his eyes, contentment filling him as Dean's scent smoothed out from sad and scared to cautiously happy. Well, almost.
“Up,” Castiel instructed gently, tilting Dean’s head back a little. He washed the parts of Dean’s neck where blood from his nose must have run, washing away the sweat and leaving soft, clean skin. Castiel rinsed out the cloth when he was done, then went back over Dean’s face one more time just to be sure. Dean kept his eyes closed the entire time.
Castiel stayed awake long into the night, though Dean didn’t know that. He was asleep a few minutes after his head hit the pillow, peaceful and soft in the ambient light of the motel sign outside. Unconscious, he was unaware of the gentle blue gaze resting between his shoulder blades, unaware of the aching pit that had opened in the doctor’s chest. Unaware of the soft longing that floated through the air like fog through sunbeams.
could do that. Any one of the people in here could. Your friend, whomever it is you’re in love with—it could happen to him too. Are you really going to waste time thinking about what could possibly go wrong?”
do have to be going,” Sam cuts in, smiling tightly at her. He turns to Cas, then, an expectant look on his face. “Cas, you coming?”
“What are we even gonna do?” Dean asked, looking up at Castiel over the flames of his still-burning fire. “How are we even gonna fight Alastair? We’re not gonna have any help from either of our kingdoms, yours especially.”
“Okay. That’s fine, Cas,” Dean said, trying not to feel too relieved. It was kind of a selfish feeling, since he knew Castiel might be in danger or something, but he couldn’t help but be glad that the Alpha was going to be staying with him. Going to get breakfast was fine, but that was probably the most Dean’s Omega could take before he started getting restless. He sat down at the dining table when the Alpha prompted him to, waiting for Castiel to sit down with his own box of food before opening it. Dean promptly groaned aloud at the stack of French toast, butter, powdered sugar, and maple syrup that greeted him. “This looks
Michael’s gaze didn’t soften. He simply looked at Dean like he was a rodent squealing for its life in the jaws of a trap. “I don’t believe you.”
Castiel breathed a soft sigh of relief as he ducked underneath the lichen that concealed his cave, his tail sweeping quickly out of sight. For a moment, he paused and stared out at the sky, searching for any signs of pursuers.
Dean ended up sleeping through the night. At some point, long after the sun had dropped below the tree line, Castiel curled up on the far side of the nest in human form and fell asleep as well.
Clyde made his rounds through the apartment, making sure everything was as clean as he liked it. He checked one last time on the two sleeping lovers, then returned to the place he liked to go during the nighttime. The apartment was clean and quiet, only the hum of machinery and the soft breaths of Dean and Castiel to break the silence. Clyde settled in on top of Dean’s bookshelf to get some much-needed rest, ethereal body full of the content feeling of a mission accomplished.
He made his way through the forest, eyes aching with the strain of trying to navigate in near-darkness. His entire body ached. It was pissing him off.
There were plenty of lights, though everyone seemed to be in their houses for the time being. There were horses outside, buckets and barrels and wooden posts.
to Dean. He was supposed to be the person who Dean could come to when his father’s disappointment and asshole behavior got too much. Instead, Castiel had acted just as bad.
“Yeah, maybe.” Dean winced. “I’ll, uh… I’ll call him. I should probably do it soon, so he doesn’t think I’m ignoring him.” Before Castiel could say anything, he’d pulled up the phone app and dialed Michael’s number.
“Huh?” Dean asked. He frowned. “Oh, I ran into the bathroom door at the restaurant. Turns out I’m stupid
A single, powerful flick of his tail had him rising through the water. He left Sam behind, eyes on the trawler and the mass of trapped creatures above him. The pressure of the water around him gradually lessened, the currents becoming more volatile as Dean rose. He shifted his grip on his blade, bringing it to an offensive position as he got close.
He finally got to see his husband tonight. Dean had been back from San Diego for a week now, but Castiel had been gone throughout that time because he’d been at a writers’ convention down in Nevada. He’d come back this afternoon, just in time to join Dean for the beginning of his two months of leave. Just the thought of that long break made Dean smile. Two whole months with his angel. He was so close. He just had to get home.
The angel wonders if cuddling counts as a hug. He’s pretty sure it does, but he decides not to include it in the hug count. Dean needs all the physical contact he can get. Castiel isn’t going to cut corners just to make himself feel better. Dean deserves eight whole hugs, plus some cuddling on the side.
,” Castiel snarled, wings flaring threateningly. He could feel his eyes heat instinctively, the urge to shift tugging at him.
He made the mistake of looking at the cake, the white frosting perfectly styled. It would have looked delicious on any other day, but right at that moment, it made Dean so nauseous he couldn’t see for a moment. Desperation overtook him, and he hurriedly moved away from the table in search of Michael.
After he’d thrown the canteen to the side, Castiel tore bread into small pieces, alternately pasting vegetable-cheese-spread and meat on the pieces. Dean hummed appreciatively, and after he was finished, he seemed much more clear-headed than before.
He worked early and late hours, trying to ignore the impending doom he felt about Michael’s party. Dean didn’t know
Panic flooded Castiel’s bloodstream as he realized there was no way out of this. Of all the dragons to spot them, it seemed it was the only one who could have managed to catch them.
There was an ungodly amount of bitterness in those words. Dean stayed silent for several seconds, struggling to unpack everything that had been loaded in those few sentences. It sounded like Castiel was angry at him, which kind of sucked. They’d been getting along pretty well over the past few months. The only arguments they’d had had been petty and had usually been resolved in a day or two. Right now, Castiel sounded
He expected Castiel to get angry, to rise to the bait like he’d done so many times in the past. Dean could sense the air of an approaching argument, and not the good kind, either. It was the kind of fight that left the walls of the cave ringing for minutes afterward. Or, Dean supposed, in this case it would be the infirmary instead of the cave.
.”), but he still sometimes got things wrong. It seemed ‘pie’ was yet another human thing he didn’t yet understand.
“You good, Cas?” Dean asked, snapping Castiel out of his thoughts. He was holding a bag of frozen peas to his face. “The pizza place givin’ you trouble or something?” There was a teasing smile on his face, but Castiel saw the concern in his eyes.
things Dean could tell. He looked down at the jacket Jo was holding up to him and hesitated before eventually opening his mouth. “I’m not sure the pattern on this one is good,” he said quietly, gesturing at the odd checkered fabric. “Maybe, uh… that one?”
” Castiel asked, profoundly confused now. All his anger from before had turned into utter confusion. “I saved your
She gave him a small shrug. “I have prayed to the gods for your good health. I figured doing it here, in the remains of your nest, was the best way to be close to you.”
Castiel shook his head, looking down at the Honey Festival tickets with a massive smile on his face. He couldn’t help it. His chest felt like it was going to burst with how much love he felt for the man beside him. He wanted to kiss Dean. For a wild, crazy second, he almost did. The only thing that stopped him was the Soul Mark peeking out from underneath Dean’s layers of shirts.
They moved on after that, heading into more serious topics, but Castiel ended up having the last laugh. When Dean woke up the next morning and looked into his fridge, he was greeted with a whole new array of food. Bacon, eggs, oranges, more bacon, and a little package of pre-made cinnamon rolls.
“We wouldn’t be taking a whole day off of classes just to go to breakfast,” Castiel said. “In fact, I don’t think you would have dared pull me out of school unless we were doing something that needs to be done today instead of on the weekend. So what is it?”
mad about how late he’d been. Dean was a believer in taking responsibility, but today truly hadn’t been his fault. He’d had no control over flight patterns or headwind or fucking rookies. He just hoped his husband wouldn’t decide to start their two-month break with an argument about Dean’s time management.
Castiel tried to laugh. He was fairly sure it came out flat and insincere. He blamed it on the fact that his head still hurt badly. Dean still wasn’t looking at him. That was fine. It gave Castiel the chance to look at him longingly, just for a moment, without fear of discovery or making things awkward.
He didn’t know why Dean didn’t want to talk about him. Maybe he was trying to convince himself Michael was a good guy. Maybe he was ashamed, or embarrassed. Maybe it was both of those at once. Castiel wouldn’t put it past Dean. For a remarkably strong, confident individual, Dean was shockingly vulnerable when it came to things like this.
Dean made a soft noise and shifted, moving sluggishly. Normally, Castiel would have ordered him to go faster, but he recognized that Dean was in that floating headspace and couldn’t process things as quickly. The human moved, bringing his legs around so he was straddling Castiel’s thighs. He settled a little, a soft noise of pain escaping his lips when his bruised backside came in contact with Castiel’s slacks.
“Think you know, Cas,” Dean said quietly. He watched the emotion play over the doctor’s face, waiting for the inevitable.
faded to a barely noticeable stain. Hopefully, Dean wouldn’t be charged heavily for that, though he doubted it. He cringed at the image of the landlord’s reaction if she ever saw the window, either.
Jo smiled. “I think you look great. Here, I got an idea,” she said. “D’you have a family member you can text? Someone you trust? I want to send them a picture of you and see what they think. Maybe your mama?”
He spun, jamming the spear into the first man’s chest as he reached forward, disarming the sword-guy with a flick of his wrist. He hacked a gash along the man’s throat without a second thought.
He remained near-silent and achingly slow for about four hundred yards. When the clearing with the dead dragon was completely out of sight, Castiel turned and hurried through the trees on foot, tail swishing with distress and smacking into trees as he went.
Like an answered prayer, the door opened. Dean turned around, half-expecting to see familiar blue eyes and a gummy smile, then felt his heart drop all the way to the fins of his tail when he was met with silvery, horrible eyes instead.
Castiel got up before he could even think to do otherwise, putting his laptop to the side on his bed. He walked over to the door to pull it open, feeling something inside him melt a little at the sight outside.
his dorsal fin used for? He didn’t know. Yes, he could control it, and he supposed he flared it to make himself look bigger or to try to impress the ladies, but he’d never really thought of it in the scientific, behavioral way that this doctor was. It made him feel simultaneously special and a little like an object. He didn’t think he liked either.
“Yeah,” Dean choked out, trying for a shaky smile. He missed by a mile. “I work for him. He’s my boss.”
is coming too?” Dean crowed, smiling at a random skyscraper as he imagined his little brother’s blushing face. “Isn’t that convenient?”
He shoved himself out of the water painfully, legs kicking pathetically to help his shaking arms heave his body up and over the side of the pool.
Castiel nodded. “We didn’t go far. Well, not far by dragon standards. I would imagine that on a horse, it would be quite the distance.”
The way Sam’s face paled was hilarious. “Fine,” he said, already moving away from the boat. “No doing anything stupid. I expect you back by sundown.”
A recap, if you need it (the chapter picks up as if no time has passed): THE BATTLE IS HERE. Dean and Castiel have just taken off and are preparing to fight Alastair. He's coming, my dear friends. And he's not going to leave until he's the last one left alive.
(Warning for a two-second insight into Dean's, uh, shower routine, featuring an even shorter guest appearance of Castiel's name.)
“Truly, Balthazar,” Castiel said, needing this man to understand how grateful he was. “Thank you for your words.”
“Blobfish really do look normal,” he explained, cupping his hands into a little circle. “They just look stupid when you guys see them because they’re down so deep the pressure makes ‘em all firm and hard. Up here, it’s really light and weight-less.”
“You do. And a vertebrae is your spine. That means sharks, usually, and your kind. I’ve only been able to study mer corpses before, unfortunately,” Castiel said. “I was amazed that you survived so long. I suppose... I suppose you’re my best bet at actually getting any real research done. You’re a living example of everything I study, and you’re also able to answer my questions.” He huffed a small laugh, wincing as he realized he’d missed the mark of sounding cheerful. “If we had more time...”
Dean made a noise that was half laugh, half sob, slinging his arms tight around the boy hugging him.
Just before Dean could wipe his eyes and begin to try to make himself look presentable, the door to the locker rooms opened. Dean froze where he stood, heart kickstarting in his chest. Footsteps sounded, and he glanced around, terrified. At last second, Dean scrambled to hide behind the last row of lockers, praying that the person would just get their stuff and leave. Maybe they needed to go to the bathroom. He hoped that was the case. They could just go and not see him, and then—
Hug Number Six happens while Dean makes dinner. Castiel can’t hug him for very long, since he’s moving around the kitchen, but he’s grateful for the four seconds that Dean allows him to ‘play koala’ before he pulls away. Feeling accomplished, Castiel prepares the dinner table.
Castiel shifted forms to go hunting, hoping he could find some food. The snow was melting on the ridge, and it didn’t seem like there would be any more of it. Winter was fading.
Castiel swallowed and left the room, feeling strangely hurt. He tried not to think about it as he headed dejectedly back to his office, tried not to think of the merman trapped in that pool.
Castiel got up and turned off the TV. He walked past the kitchen, walked past Dean still crunching on his carrot, and headed to his bedroom. He had a suit somewhere in his closet that he could wear. He had a few, actually. He didn’t really care which one he pulled out. He didn’t know the Greek restaurant Arthur was taking him to, only that it was on the nice side of town and Castiel would feel like an idiot if he didn’t wear something fancy.
And wasn’t that the truth? The ugly, unavoidable truth that had been hanging over Dean’s head since the night his mother died. The war was
Dean threw back his head as much as he was able and laughed. It echoed in the small bathroom. “Holy shit, that’s funny. I can’t imagine you doing that.”
Sure enough, a dark shape loomed overhead. The surface of the ocean was storm-tossed and violent, the skies betraying how restless the waters were. No one was happy with what was happening tonight. Dean gritted his teeth at the telltale squeak and click of terrified dolphins, the rustling of thousands of frightened fish. Sam had been right.
“You’d better not,” Castiel growled. His voice was rough and threatening, even though he was panicking internally.
Castiel reached out and opened it, eyes widening at the two bright yellow slips of paper waiting. “Oh, Dean.”
He closed his eyes and clenched his fists where he rested them on the top of the counter. He’d been waiting for the pie to bake and completing an assignment in the meantime, but like every time he’d tried to get something done these days, he’d found himself thinking of Dean. They weren’t even normal thoughts, either. Castiel wasn’t just thinking about what he’d like to eat or if Dean had finished the laundry or if they’d taken the trash out. He was thinking of the soft, fluffy mess of Dean’s hair in the morning, of the plush curve of his lips when he was tired but still managing to make a joke about something stupid, the gorgeous green of his eyes when the morning sunlight hit them just right. Castiel wondered what it would be like to close his eyes and wrap himself around Dean and wake up that way too. He wondered what it would be like to be able to hug Dean just
The damage was incredible. The man had probably died on the spot, his spinal cords severed and each little vertebrae detached from the others. The amount of raw
Dean winced at how rude Michael was being, but Jo didn’t look fazed at all. “Sure thing, Mr. Angeles. I can see about that. Dean, why don’t you come with me and we can see what we’ve got?”
Dean’s cheeks heated with shame and humiliation again. He murmured an agreement and followed Jo back to where they’d been before, wishing he could sink into the floor and disappear.
“Yes, you do,” Balthazar agreed. He sighed and nodded at Gabriel, who was still manning the counter. “I suppose I should pay, since I invited you.”
He was just thinking of going to the door of the examination room to see how close the fire was when he heard a soft noise behind him. “Okay, Cas. Let’s go.”
Castiel chuckled as he glared at the offending piece of glass. “Do you want me to squeeze in with Benny and Cam? I can give you the bench so you can lay down.”
Castiel grunted an obligatory greeting at him that was probably lost in the gurgle of the pool filters. He knew he was kind of being an asshole. He was the senior captain, he should probably be greeting the newest member of the team with warmth and excitement. Castiel didn’t
“It is,” Dean agreed, snorting at Castiel’s initial description. Of course those were the details his friend remembered from any previous summaries. Fighting, insomnia, and testicular cancer.
“I won’t tell anyone,” Dean promised. He gestured around. “Don’t have anyone to tell it to, anyway.”
He forced himself to take a deep breath, to calm the unusual fire burning in his chest. He’d promised himself something. He had to carry that out.
They walked through the enormous double doors, leaving them a little open. Dean led Castiel to the middle of the courtyard, where they’d stood the night before. The sun was dying now, the sky bleeding red in its wake. The wind seemed loud in comparison to the silence. The entire city seemed to be holding its breath, hidden underneath the ground. Castiel silently prayed to the gods for good luck. He had to remind himself that he wasn’t just fighting for Dean. He was fighting for his people, and for Dean’s people too. For the hatchlings and children, the men and women and civilians, who had all been just as affected by this war as the soldiers who had never come home.
“Okay,” Castiel said. He glanced at the clock, heart sinking as he realized he only had about forty minutes before he was supposed to get in a car and meet Arthur. “I should probably get ready.”
Dean smiled as he caught the hoodie. He pulled it over his head, shivering again as he wrapped his arms around himself. Despite his broad shoulders, the hoodie still looked a little big on him in the chest and shoulder department. The sleeves were just long enough to cover his hands. Castiel bit his lip harder.
The boat gave a shuddering roar and kicked forward, causing Dean to fall right off the bench and onto the wet floor of it, soaking his hoodie as well as his sweatpants. He didn’t give a damn about his wet clothing, though, especially as the boat hit an incoming wave and nearly threw them overboard. “Hold on!” Castiel shouted. “This will be a rough ride until we get past the shelf! Whatever you do, don’t fall out!”
Dean’s breath puffed warm and soft against his neck. His head was a comforting, heavy weight on Castiel’s left shoulder. He’d buried his nose in the folds of Castiel’s sweatshirt hood, his eyes shut peacefully. He’d relaxed against Castiel’s body, and true to his word, the dark-haired boy hadn’t let him fall over off the bench. He kept Dean nice and safe in his arms.
Castiel made a rumbling noise again, though it sounded like laughter this time. Dean gritted his teeth, humiliation flooding his veins. He was acting like such a fucking
Castiel’s hands tightened on the blocks. He barely had enough time to take a breath before the buzzer was sounding, sending his body launching forward almost on instinct.
“We’ll need to prepare,” Castiel said seriously. “This kind of heat wave can be dangerous if we aren’t careful. Do we still have those box fans you brought with you when we moved in?”
Castiel frowned, staring hard at the road ahead of them. They were walking along a long, flat dirt road. To their right, the irrigation canal flowed. To the left, Lawrence’s shopping centers and residential areas laid. It was calming here, pleasant. The sun was a little hot, but Dean didn’t mind. He was used to it. Summers in Lawrence were always blistering, anyway.
, but not about what someone might think. He was nervous because he might knock on the door and a beautiful woman—or man, for that matter—might open it. He was nervous because there could be a child that answered instead. He was scared because Cas might answer too.
“Okay,” the merman muttered. “You’re gonna fix... th-this?” He gestured with his free hand at the blood seeping from his where his other palm was pressed to his neck. Castiel read the barely-there tremble to his words.
“Aw, sunshine, you’re no fun,” Dean said. He nodded at the intersection ahead of them, fingers tapping excitedly on Baby’s wheel. “The second we’re outta here, I’m gonna open her up. You’re either in or you’re out.”
“You can choose, I don’t mind,” Castiel replied calmly, as if what they were watching wasn’t something they fought over every single time they sat down together.
He toyed with the controls slightly, eyeing the altimeter as he soared over the sleeping towns and cities below him. He was nearing the Paine Field airport, so he’d have a whole lot of jumbo jets and civilians in his airspace soon. He needed to stay low, but remain a respectful distance from the ground. The F-18 Growler squadrons stationed at Whidbey already received enough noise complaints. They didn’t need a Lightning pilot coming in to earn them even more flack because Dean had buzzed the mainland on his approach. He’d never hear the end of it from them.
“I ain’t a—” Dean choked off with a gasping scream, the collar heating and convulsing on his throat. It was fucking
Dean frowned. “Are you okay?” he asked. Castiel turned to look at him as their bags came through, frowning.
“Like a baby,” Dean yawned. He stretched, completely unconcerned, and threw back the covers so he could climb out of bed. “Alright. ‘M gonna change, and then we can go get breakfast, yeah? ‘M starvin’ right now.”
He knew how to handle anger. He knew how to handle frustration, or apathy, or disgust. Castiel had prepared himself for any one of those. What he hadn’t expected was... sadness.
“Mmm, thanks, Cas,” Dean slurred, giving the Alpha a sleepy smile. He tried to lay back and put his head on the pillow, but he missed by a mile and ended up careening sideways and into Castiel. The Alpha laughed softly at that, waiting for Dean to inevitably pull away and try again.
friends! We lived in uneasy truce before this clusterfuck; the war is just a culmination of centuries of resentment.”
Castiel knew in his heart that Dean definitely would. He’d let his own father do it to him for years. His soulmate? Of course he would. Dean would take a beating from Michael and probably think he
“English, yeah,” Dean said. He quirked a small smile at the dashboard of the car. “We can start with that.”
Anna narrowed her eyes. “Why? You are not a fool, Castiel. At least, not in the time I’ve known you.”
Castiel holds off on the hugging quota for the day, convincing himself that Dean won’t die overnight of no hugs. He’ll be okay. The self-convincing kind of works, but it doesn’t stop Castiel from laying awake all night with Dean tucked up in his arms. He doesn’t need to sleep now that he has his grace back, but sometimes he closes his eyes and rests. Not tonight, though. Tonight, he stays up and he thinks.
Dean’s legs gave out. The crack of his knees hitting the carpeted floor made him wince, even though the pain was dull and barely noticeable. The relief of this, of being smaller, of being
Dean barely had time to blink at him, surprised by the show of honest gratitude, before the window was sliding shut and the assassin was gone.
The seventy-five foot walk to the stake was agonizing. Dean barely made it. If he’d had more in his stomach, he was sure he would have vomited it again. The only thing that kept him from collapsing and giving up right then and there was the promise of death. Soon, everything would be painless and good again.
He let go of Castiel’s hand to press a sparkler into it, cheeks pinking a little as he realized that they’d been literally
, Dean’s mind reminded him, shutting down the little flickers of hope that had tried to ignite in his heart once again.
Dean hurried as much as he could without breaking too many laws, grateful that there wasn’t that much traffic. He got to the Garden on time, but when he parked and got out, he spotted Michael’s silver Porsche instantly. His heart sank.
Castiel climbed onto the blocks, his lean body coiling like a predatory cat’s as he knelt on the blocks to take his mark. Dean watched, mesmerized, as the thick muscles in his thighs flexed. The referee called the beginning, and then the buzzer sounded. Castiel practically flew off the block, arcing into the water with a perfect dive.
“What the fuck are you doing?” he snarled, causing all three humans to flinch. He eyed the horrific-looking metal tools the nurse was holding, his eyes heating unbearably. He knew they were glowing threateningly. In dragon form, smoke would have been pouring out of his mouth. “You’re
The days spent lounging on the lake with Castiel were helping, too. Dean regained color to his skin, the familiar golden tone taking the place of ugly, fish-belly white. Dean had freckles again, too. Castiel told him as much, asking with amazed eyes one night what the splattering of spots on Dean’s nose were.
The tires made a whining, squealing sound against the slick asphalt. Dean gunned down the throttle, the flaps of his wings rotating to accommodate the landing. The tightness of his jaw was adding to the ache that had been sitting in his temples since he’d started his descent, his teeth clenched together hard as he struggled to maneuver the plane to a stop on the wet runway.
Balthazar waved off his thanks and insisted on going up to the counter with him. Castiel was only half-surprised when the man flirted a little with Gabriel before he left, leaving Castiel’s cousin speechless for the first time in Castiel’s memory. As Balthazar left with an exaggerated flounce, Gabriel turned to Castiel with wide eyes. “Did that… Did he—”
Castiel thought of his own massive bank account, stuffed full of money painted crimson with people’s blood. He didn’t use his money for
- Dean didn't say 'I love you' back (Y YO A TÍ) is because he's an emotionally constipated idiot. Seriously, he's such a dumbass. He's also our dumbass. But he was probably standing there running through all the reasons he could be dreaming or the reasons he didn't deserve it. :( Our baby just does that sometimes.
Groaning, Dean sat up and rubbed at his face. His eyes still felt itchy with tiredness, but he didn’t feel like he was going to pass out anymore. When he stood, his vision only fuzzed out for a little bit.
Castiel felt the urge to retch. The wind had changed, blowing the cooked-meat scent of Ishim’s body toward him. Suddenly, Castiel couldn’t stand to look at what he’d done for a moment longer.
“Huh?” Dean asked from behind a large stack of pillows they’d bought to replace the worn-out ones in their living room. “What’d I do?”
It was tiny, barely more than a rowboat. He’d taken it out a few times over the past year, jerking his outboard motor to life and sailing out to some unknown distance away from the beach, simply to sit and stare at the water for hours. Sometimes, Castiel swore he could see the flash of colorful scales. He always chalked it up to his imagination afterward.
Dean snorted. “Yeah, sure. A dragon and a human, working together. I don’t trust you as far as I can throw you, asshole.”
Instead of stepping inside and immediately shutting the door of the cave, Alastair walked forward, coming toward Dean immediately. He left the boulder off to the side, which was weird. Alastair was normally careful, taking every precaution he could to make sure Dean didn’t escape. Strangely, there was no drag of ugly tail on stone either, and his footsteps sounded lighter. Dean tensed, listening for the telltale hissing of amusement, but heard nothing.
“I know,” Dean said gently. “I get it, Cas. Thanks for looking out for me. I promise I’ll eat when I wake up, okay? You can feed me whatever the hell you want, or I can make it. Or we can order it. Whatever. Just… please? I haven’t slept more than three hours in the past forty-eight, and I’m starting to see math equations on your face.”
. The thought made his shoulders crumple inward, his head bow, his body curve into itself. He couldn’t have stopped the quaking sob in his chest even if he’d
Clyde shared a space with Dean, since Dean had moved into his former bedroom. Clyde didn’t need to sleep, so he wasn’t in here much, but he sometimes came around to get some peace and quiet. Or shelter from the idiocy in the next room.
Castiel gave a low, gentle rumble, as if he knew what Dean was feeling. The human patted the dragon’s scales gratefully, jaw clenched against the tears that threatened.
“No,” Dean said. “It’s… uh, it’s Michael.” He swallowed and opened the text, feeling cold all of a sudden. Was it cold in the grocery store? No, he was wearing a hoodie. Castiel’s, actually. For some reason, knowing he was wearing his roommate’s hoodie made him feel dirty, like he was cheating on his soulmate.
“Okay,” the merman replied, “on one condition.” At Castiel’s raised eyebrow, he jerked his chin slightly at the buzzer in the corner. “I get to hold
In a moment, Dean would have to rearrange the suit on the hangers it had come in. In a moment, he’d have to adjust his shirt and his smile and walk out of the changing room like nothing had happened. In a moment, he’d have to go face Jo, and then he’d have to face Michael, which would be a thousand times harder. In a moment, he’d have to put his mask back on and pretend.
Castiel flew slow past the targets this time, allowing Dean to squint at the one he’d fired at. Dean laughed aloud. “Bullseye. Fuck yeah!”
Dean turned to the side, frowning at it. He didn’t look fat. He certainly didn’t look as slim as Michael, but Dean didn’t think that was a
It took Dean four hundred meters to begin following him right into the wall. Castiel found himself barely putting his feet on the wall before Dean was flipping too. At the end of their five-hundred-yard set, they were neck and neck, swimming as hard as they could to get to the wall first. Castiel touched before Dean, but he didn’t miss the fact that Dean had started twenty seconds behind him.
Castiel flinched, digging his claws into the rocky earth beneath him. They were facing each other on a wide tabletop, the ground sloping steeply away on all sides. To Castiel’s right and Ishim’s left, the Ryuu mountains rose in a towering wall of slag and snow. To Castiel’s left and Ishim’s right, the green valley spread out below.
, Cas,” Dean moaned. “Shit, that... that feels good.” He lowered himself again, then rose, muscles flexing again.
Castiel gave him a small, sad smile. There was something unreadable in his blue eyes, something that made Dean’s chest twist. “Of course, Dean.” The Alpha hesitated, then said haltingly, “If you... if you ever need anything—Help, food, a place to... a place to stay... Just call me, yes?” Castiel smiled at him, but there was something flat about it, like a soda without carbonation, or sunlight without warmth.
Castiel watched in awe as Dean arced backward off the blocks in a perfect backstroke start. His long, lean body began to ripple in a wave-like motion as he began to kick underwater, a powerful propulsion that sent him halfway across the pool in seconds.
Castiel yanked off the top layer of clothes he’d been wearing, leaving only a shirt and the undershirt Dean had loaned him that morning. The clothing he’d torn off, he used to wrap tightly around the wound on Dean’s leg, drawing a scream of pain from the human.
Castiel felt the guards’ grip on him loosening. He experienced everything as if from a distance, so entranced was he by the power of the siren in front of him. Dean tilted his head to the side, a smile gracing his lips as he continued singing, eyes flashing with something gorgeous and predatory as he slipped off the bow of the boat and into the ocean.
“Did, uh… Did I wake Sam ‘n Jess?” Dean asked into Castiel’s neck. It was his second most pressing concern.
This time, he turned to a page near the back of what looked like one of Dean’s old cooking notebooks and scrawled
Castiel drew the curtains in his room and laid on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. Every time he closed his eyes, he remembered Dean curled up in the blankets of his bed, searching for his scent. He thought of Dean curled up in his nest in the guest room, bee held tightly to his chest, hair fluffy and soft from taking a shower, cheekbones pinked with warmth, body relaxed and comfortable.
Sometimes… Sometimes Castiel wished he wasn’t himself. Wished he’d been born gray and brown like his siblings. Wished his fire was a normal color, that he had a head-bashing tail instead of a flapped tail. That his wings were normal, that
Dean wants to say that there were a lot of ghost hunts, but that’s not true. “Uh, yeah,” he manages. “The one with the dude and the jar of human teeth?”
He’d thought he could lay in bed for a while and then go downstairs with Castiel to make him breakfast, but he must have been sleepier than he’d thought. Dean lost time between Castiel changing into his underclothes and Castiel standing above him, fully dressed in his uniform. Dean barely felt the gentle kiss to his forehead and the whispered, “Sleep well, love. I’ll see you soon.”
Castiel grasped Dean’s reaching hand and brought it up to his lips to kiss it gently, the sap. “Later,” the angel insisted. “I promise, we can do more once you’ve had an adequate amount of sleep.” His chapped pink lips quirked into a small, mischievous smile. “I intend to use our time together very efficiently. Especially since we are going to have the Bunker to ourselves for the rest of the week. But for now, it’s time for you to rest.”
Before Castiel could answer, he heard a familiar noise that sent cold chills through his veins: The sound of wood creaking, a taut bowstring being pulled back.
“You’re ridiculous,” Dean sighed, rolling his eyes. He took a bite of ice cream instead of trying to counter what Castiel had said, figuring this wasn’t as bad as he was making it out to be. If the stupid blanket worked, then whatever. If not, that was fine too. He’d be happy to give it to Cas and be done.
Tucked against his body by his tail and his left knee was Dean Winchester. The prince was sleeping soundly, his soft snores reaching Castiel’s ears faintly. It was, quite frankly, adorable. Castiel felt a flutter of warm fondness flicker in his chest. Dean was sort of cute when he slept, his handsome face relaxed and his mouth parted slightly. Small, definitely. Beautiful… well, that was obvious.
Castiel glanced down and to the right, a telltale sign that he was about to lie. “I went with Sam to buy the essentials,” he said. “Sam... told me that these ingredients were essentials.”
Dean gave him a warm smile to show he didn’t mean any harm, then turned and winked at Sam. “Don’t take it personally, Sammy. He doesn’t like to share.”
“That doesn’t give him a right to hurt you,” Castiel said fiercely, voice treacherously soft. He found he was startlingly close to tears as well. They clawed at his throat, his chest, making it near-impossible to speak or breathe.
The seawater was rushing past him now, signaling that the trawl was reaching the surface. Dean would have to let go very soon, but he refused to do it yet. He was so fucking
Jo Harvelle’s eyes practically bugged out of her head. “Tell me I’m hallucinating,” she said, voice soft with awe.
“’Night,” Dean replied, before he could stop himself. He could only watch as the doctor beamed at him, then stumbled out the door. A few moments later, it was swinging inward with a low groan.
“I did fucking try!” Dean shouted. “I fucking tried and look where that got me! I’m broken, Castiel! Fucked up and wrong and I won’t ever be the same again! I can barely fucking stand by myself! I got
The dragon huffed contentedly, curled around Dean protectively. Castiel made sure that Dean was comfortable, gently adjusting his tail so he was supported. Soon after, the dragon joined the prince in sleep.
“They look kinda like angels falling from Heaven,” Dean muttered, voice soft. Castiel glanced at him, surprised at the analogy, and was struck by the beauty of his friend’s face.
Castiel and the rest of the swimmers erupted off the wall, arcing backward with well-practiced precision. Dean watched in awe as Castiel kicked toward the center of the pool and past it, coming up mere feet from the disqualification line. “Holy shit,” Cam muttered. Dean silently agreed.
Castiel’s heart stuttered, tripping over itself in his chest. “Yeah?” he replied, voice just as soft as Dean’s had been.
“Why Dean?” Jo asked, stepping forward a little so she could see Castiel around Benny. “Why him, of all humans?”
It was going to be embarrassing enough, having to go face Castiel after he’d seen Dean crying like a child in the locker room. Dean wasn’t sure what he was going to say. He was probably just going to laugh it off, act like it hadn’t happened. That was what he usually did. That was the smart thing to do. What the hell else was he supposed to say? He had no idea what to even
Castiel smiled, more to ease Dean’s obvious anxiety than to express his amusement. “Have you ever done this before?”
As March turned to April, spring began to shift to summer. The anxiety and agitation that every college student felt during finals week was beginning to creep up on everyone. Castiel coped by baking new and random things that he and Gabriel came up with and writing vigorously, sometimes into the early morning. Dean coped by cleaning nearly everything in sight and being extra snappy when he hadn’t had his coffee in the mornings.
Castiel’s shoulders tensed, his hands curling into fists. He may be at a strange place with Dean now, but he knew that whatever the human was, he was
Of course, shooting from Castiel’s back meant that Dean had to be completely comfortable taking his hands off the dragon’s scales entirely. It was quite the development in their relationsh-uh, friendship. Quite the development in their friendship. Lots of trust. Yeah.
If he was being honest with himself, he was also enjoying the excuse not to think about the real problem at hand. With Dean asleep, Castiel didn’t have to try to come up with what he was going to
He’d tried to hold off on immediate judgement when Michael and Dean had first started dating. He’d known that his love for Dean would skew his perspective on the person who was supposed to be Dean’s ‘other half.’ Castiel had tried to keep an open and positive mind when thinking about Michael, even when Dean shared things about him that were less than thrilling.
“You have time to take a little nap before we go,” Cas said, as if he’d been reading Dean’s mind. He must have seen the expression on Dean’s face, because he patted his lap and added, “You don’t have to get up and go to your room, if you don’t want to. I’ll put on a documentary.”
“It sounds stupid,” Dean rushes to say, feeling his face heat again. Before he can say any more, Castiel shakes his head, hands tightening ever so slightly on his shoulders.
“Dean, I stand by what I said before.” Castiel held up a patient hand as Dean tried to protest, cutting the human off. “I understand that you feel obligated to push through this. I also understand that you know your own limits, better than I ever will. I will agree to this, but only if you
None of the humans noticed him as he flapped quietly up to the rooftops and traveled to the center of the town that way. If any of them happened to look up, with the way his wings were tucked, he would look like a normal person who had somehow managed to get on top of a random building. Hopefully, at least. If that wasn’t the case, it didn’t look like there were a lot of armed humans. Maybe he’d be able to shift and get out fast enough to survive.
After the first date that had ended in disaster, Castiel didn’t go on any more. Dean was secretly grateful. He wasn’t sure if he could have handled too many more nights like that one, agonizing over his feelings and the fact that Castiel was now spending time with someone else. Dean knew it was a horribly selfish thing for him to think, but it was true all the same.
“We’re headed to the coast,” Castiel replied. He sighed, settling back in his seat a little. “Unfortunately, there are two places we could end up going. The Gulf of Mexico, or the West Coast. The Gulf is closer, but the Coast is... it’s where you were taken from. It’s at least a four-day drive from here, three if we push it.” Castiel switched lanes around a large, boxy car that Dean was pretty sure was called a truck.
about how good Castiel looked in his bed, or how much better he would look leaning over Dean, blue eyes glowing-
Castiel gave a small smile. He wrapped himself in blankets and tucked himself under the largest intact piece of stone available, far from the pounding rain. He pulled Dean’s shirt close to his face, the scent of the human warming something deep inside him.
Castiel focused on his sandwich, hoping his cheeks hadn’t pinked too noticeably. Dean, thankfully, was too engrossed in his pie to glance at him. “That’s good,” he said around a mouthful of crust and cherry filling. “Serves the asshole right.”
Castiel sat up, lightning flashing and lighting the cave up for a brief second. He could see Dean curled up on the other side of the nest, his back only a few feet from the edge where it began to dip down. The dragon contemplated speaking, trying to find words to apologize, then decided against it. From the relaxed look of Dean’s shoulders, it looked as if he’d managed to get to sleep after all. Good.
That was when Dean realized they were laying in his bed. Castiel was wearing loose clothes that looked quite comfortable, his hair tousled with sleep. Dean’s sea-blue sheets were twisted around the dragon’s waist, same as they were around his own.
“Dean, it’s fine,” Castiel assured, sounding almost amused. He tapped at Dean’s head, trying to get his attention. His blue eyes were serious and kind when Dean finally turned to look at him. “I mean it. I’m fine. The firework surprised me, that’s all.” He flexed his hand, showing Dean that it was okay.
Feeling slightly unsettled, Castiel took the short route to Dean’s apartment, becoming more relaxed as he got closer to the Omega’s home. The Alpha actually smiled a little as he scaled the wall, thinking of Dean’s face whenever he saw Castiel climb through the window.
Dean didn’t retaliate immediately, for once. He turned his head and looked away, jaw working. It gave Castiel time to regain a small modicum of control, time to get his rage to settle a little. Now that he wasn’t so angry, he could see how dangerously close Dean was to tears. They were swimming in his eyes, making the beautiful green glisten underneath the lights.
“No,” Castiel replied flatly. He couldn’t help but smile at Dean’s eye-roll, watching in amusement as his friend sailed into the kitchen and turned on the oven light so he could peer inside.
Gabriel was staring at them the entire time they sat in the corner. Castiel tried to ignore him and focus on his date, because it was rude to be so distracted, but his cousin was acting so odd that he couldn’t help but send him a discreet glare every now and then.
He was prepared to fake his enjoyment when he took a bite of the artificially yellow glop Dean handed to him, but it was surprisingly good. The glee on the Omega’s face when Castiel told him he enjoyed it, perhaps more than the food he ate at ‘home,’ was enough to make Castiel want to smile too. Dean’s joy was infectious, Castiel was discovering. It was impossible not to feel better in his presence.
“Come, we were just about to hear Mayor Shurley’s golfing story,” Michael said, grabbing Dean’s wrist and leading him back to the circle. Dean tried not to sway as he walked, focusing on the line of tiles underneath his feet. He felt dizzy and sick, still. He prayed the feeling would go away.
“You fast?” he asked cheerfully. “You look like you are. I’ll go second. I don’t want you to have to be tapping on my feet the entire time.” He grinned, putting his hands on his slim hips.
He flared his wings to show he wasn’t fucking around, too desperate to save Dean to try to be nice. The obvious display of dominance had many of the guards scrambling, some of them sprinting into the castle. Castiel hurried through the large double doors, wondering where he could find the items he needed to care for a wounded human.
. He left it on the pillow of his own bed and pulled on his shoes, intent on doing just what he’d said.
It was when he’d finally laid down that Dean discovered his next problem. He’d only closed his eyes for two seconds before he frowned, attempting to inhale through his stubbornly stuffed-up nose. He couldn’t get any air, and it was becoming frustrating. His nose had been fairly clear when he’d been sitting up, but the second he laid down, it became blocked again.
“Have you injured your leg?” Castiel asked. It was a stupid question, but he’d been told by his brothers that his immediate analysis of people and their problems could be uncanny. He
Gods, Dean was so close. He was right in front of Castiel’s face, mere feet from the dragon’s snout. Castiel focused all of his being on the unconscious human right in front of him, on the space that was gradually getting lesser and lesser between them.
Castiel walked over to his nest, which was a large dip in the stone floor. He’d heated the stone himself when he'd first arrived in this cave, pounding the rock into the crater-shape he’d wanted. After he’d let it cool, Castiel had lined it with wool from mountain sheep and soft things from human travelers unlucky enough to cross his path.
“You’re going to punish Dean for endangering himself, am I correct?” Cas asked without preamble. He knew that only direct bluntness would get through to this version of himself.
. Dean groaned a little as he remembered the events of the night before, rolled over, and found himself face-to-face with Castiel.
“I believe I stated that we weren’t going to be doing any strenuous physical activity,” Castiel said calmly. How he managed to sound so collected when he was stroking Dean’s dick like that was a mystery. “This is not strenuous, is it?”
And then he was off, planning dinner like he usually did. Castiel watched Dean begin to move around the kitchen, searching out appliances and ingredients as he began his quest to cook parmesan chicken. For a relatively large human being, he navigated the small space with ease and grace. Castiel imagined Dean could make dinner with his eyes closed.
“It’s perfect,” Dean breathed, pupils wide and lust-blown. Castiel leaned down to kiss him again, reveling in the plush heat of his mouth, the feeling of all that heated skin pressing against his. Dean’s body was lean and hard with muscle, his skin soft and warm in comparison. Castiel ground down on him experimentally, groaning into his mouth as pleasure shot in little bolts up his spine.
His key stuck in his lock, like always. Dean wrinkled his nose at the smell of mold that permeated his entire apartment. It seemed worse now that he’d been gone so long. He dropped his duffel by the door and moved into the living room to open a window, maybe get some clean air, then stopped dead as he realized his window was already open.
After a little while, all the mud had been worked out of Dean’s hair and he was suitably limp and floppy. Castiel finished and gently tipped Dean’s head back, cupping a hand over his forehead to protect his eyes from the soapy water like Dean was a child. It was such a gentle, thoughtful gesture. It was so
Castiel looked away, feeling sick. Alastair was to blame, of course. He’d no doubt returned the night before. And Dean... Dean had been left alone with him for the entire night while Castiel moped in his office.
No Cas, but there IS a Sam. We like seeing Sam, right? Right. I love Sam, but he's hard to write sometimes. XD
asked,” Castiel said. It was petty, he knew. He had no idea how this singular human was managing to make him such an emotion-driven idiot, but here they were.
“Simple things, yes,” Castiel admitted. “I’ve been told my rye sandwich is quite delicious. I can also cook pasta. I struggle when it comes to anything more than that, unfortunately.”
“Yeah,” Dean whispered. “Gonna do all the work. You must be tired, after winning all those races today.” He bit his lip, hands sliding down Castiel’s shoulders. “God, your butterfly is so hot.”
Dean swallowed, looking down and away, at the bathroom floor over the edge of the tub. “You think you’re gonna find them?”
water? He felt like he was going to pass out, and the lemon in the water made him feel sick again. Desperately, Dean tried looking for something else to drink, but all he found was punch and champagne. Worse, the table was loaded with little snacks and squares of cake. The sight of all that food made Dean feel even more ill. He paused for a moment to lean against the edge of the table, trying to breathe deeply to calm himself down.
“Could you not use mac and cheese?” Castiel asked, feeling slightly stupid. He didn’t know much about food, but he
Over a million results came up in less than a second. Dean quirked a mirthless smile at the speed at which the technology had performed, clicking on one recipe at random. It had been reviewed five hundred and seventeen times, and it had 4.9 stars. Dean didn’t really care what middle-aged women on Pinterest thought of how the cookies tasted and how easy they were to make. He just wanted something to do, something to pour the bubbling anxiety under his skin into. He pulled up the recipe, sent away the fourteen ads that tried to attack him on sight, and walked mechanically over to the pantry.
SOOOOOO, I figured you wouldn't like the fanart as much at the bottom because I have a feeling not a lot of you are happy with Castiel right now. It's understandable. I get it.
Castiel wanted to ask more. He wanted to ask if Dean had run into the door, or if he’d been pushed. He could see the panic in his friend’s eyes, though, and he recognized that now was not the time to have this conversation. He needed to wait. If he shoved his way through this, he might damage something irreparably. The bruise on Dean’s cheek was dark and fresh, and so was the emotional twin of the injury. He needed to treat Dean with care.
“Probably. The guards will sound the horns the second he twitches, so we’ll have a few minutes of warning,” Dean replied. He watched Castiel head up the stairs that led out of the underground armory, his expression unreadable.
“O-Okay,” Dean managed. He sighed, looking down at the water. “Cas, I... I... I came to say I was sorry, I guess.” He winced. “Well, that’s not why I
Dean smiles, and the one he gets in return gives him the courage to lean forward a little and wrap his arms around his angel. Castiel immediately hugs him back, gentle and firm and warm. “I’m glad,” Dean murmurs into Castiel’s shoulder.
The pillow had somehow been kicked off the bed, though by whom, Castiel had no idea. He’d moved somewhere near the middle of the mattress, definitely trespassing into Dean’s space, and Dean... He was curled up against Castiel’s chest, his breath puffing soft and warm on Castiel’s collarbone. His hair tickled the underside of Castiel’s jaw, his hands curled loosely into the fabric of the doctor’s shirt. Castiel swallowed, grateful that Dean was nowhere near his crotch. He hadn’t had such a bad case of morning wood since he was a teenager.
,” he said, tail flicking behind him. It wasn’t a threatening gesture, but it was defensive. Castiel wanted to convey that he didn’t
When John Winchester was riding back from the Kingdom of Campbell, his new wife Mary beside him, they’d been attacked by a dragon. As Azazel prepared to kill John Winchester, Mary had begged him to spare her new husband in exchange for the life of one of her sons. She hadn’t even thought of the deal, figuring they’d never have children anyway.
After he got Dean changed and threw the horrible suit into the corner of the room to be dealt with later, Castiel led his friend into the bathroom. He bent Dean over the sink and ran warm water, gently washing out the remnants of gel and hair product that Dean had put in before. Castiel wished Dean could just take a full shower to get rid of the last of that lavender perfume, but he supposed that until Dean was more coherent,  this would have to do.
Missouri didn’t even glance twice at him as she dumped a bunch of bloody rags into the now-empty ice bucket. “He needs water and iron. The water is in the cabinets. Benny will get the antibiotics and mineral shots.”
“What the hell’re you doing?” Dean grunted, pulling away slightly as he felt pressure across the whole expanse of the gills on his right side. “What is that?”
Dean blinked. “O-Oh.” He reached down to awkwardly unlace the Oxfords, fingers feeling too fat and clumsy all of a sudden. Dean tried to hurry, but he could hear Michael sighing impatiently. Dean winced and hurried faster.
“No,” Dean replied. His back was cold. It wasn’t unpleasant, but he noticed. He could physically feel Castiel’s absence. “I don’t know when Clyde’ll be back.”
The pool was freezing. Dean only warmed up after his first hundred meters, his shoulders aching pleasantly as his muscles woke up. State moved fast, since they had a lot of events and a lot of swimmers to get through, so he and his team weren’t even finished with their second warm-up set before they had to climb out.
Sam frowned deeply. “What do you mean? You guys are practically attached at the hip. Have you met Michael?”
Dean’s head slipped down farther, resting against Castiel’s chest, and Castiel had to resist the surprisingly powerful urge to lean down and kiss his hair.
“Well good for him,” Dean hissed. “If he’s such a great guy, why don’t you go get that stupid fucking number from Gabriel and see exactly what kind of a gentleman he can be!”
Dean left his apartment that morning entirely unaware that he had a handprint on his left shoulder, exactly in the shape of the hand of the Alpha from the night before.
Castiel was tempted to slow down once they got there, to move their kisses from fast and hard to slow and sweet, to gently lay Dean down on the bed with softness and care. That was how Castiel usually handled these situations. Dean was beautiful and worthy and deserved to be treated as such, and that was
“Dean, no,” Castiel said. A warm hand tugged lightly on Dean’s shoulder, pulling him around so he could see his friend’s face. “That wasn’t what I meant.” He looked a little frustrated. “I shouldn’t have worded it in such a way. I dislike the quiet. It feels unnatural. I write to distract myself. I much prefer it when you’re around.”
“Hey, that’s mine,” Dean complained, heart racing a mile a minute. He carefully shut the freezer door, hoping Castiel hadn’t noticed.
wouldn’t condone a saddle. But… well, the idea was one he should consider. If he could get Dean to feel safer in the air, it was a good thing. He had no idea how to do that without using something like a saddle, though.
Dean sort of hated how helpless he was, but he couldn’t deny the fact that he was stuck in this cave. He had no choice but to sit here and await his death. Either he’d freeze to death, or Castiel would return. Both were equally as deadly.
The crowd of boys whistled and oohed. Dean rolled his eyes. Bela may be very pretty, but he knew from experience that she could be a bitch if she didn’t get what she wanted. Namely, at least in his situation,
“Yeah,” Dean said. He’d have to throw together something. He was pretty sure he still had one in the back of his closet, but he wasn’t sure it would fit. “You’re picking me up at seven?”
Castiel gripped his husband’s muscled shoulders and turned, twisting them both until he could push Dean up against the wall. There was a little more space between Dean’s back and the door than Castiel had anticipated, so Dean’s breath escaped his lungs in a harsh whoosh as he hit the wood roughly. Castiel kissed him immediately after, making Dean gasp into his mouth.
Dean snorted, looking down at his blueprint. His eyes weren’t moving, indicating that he was lost in thought rather than studying it. “Well… Why, uh… Why aren’t you?”
Dean shrugged. “Doesn’t sound like those guys would have caught a serial killer and rapist and whatever other crimes that guy committed. You did.” He nodded back at the window. “’Sides, they would have given him a long trial and shit, and nobody has time for that. Far’s I can see, you’re the hero here. At least, for now.”
The bee was pressed into Dean’s arms. He squeezed it without thinking, tucking himself up close to Castiel’s warm chest gratefully. He sighed in relief as the Alpha’s warm arms came up to hold him a few minutes later, communicating to his inner Omega that they really were safe.
It was a good idea, Clyde would hand it to Dean. He typed out his first sentence, completely unashamed to share it.
that, asshole. I went to seventh grade, thank you,” Dean grumbled. He wasn’t really upset, and he conveyed it by nudging Castiel lightly as he set a plate of bacon down in front of him. “Do you want some eggs too?”
“Through that door,” Jo breathed, pointing ahead. Castiel didn’t recognize it, so he supposed this was a smaller, less grand entrance to the courtyard. That was fine. Any path would do.
Castiel was suddenly very, very scared that he’d just unintentionally accomplished what Alastair had set out to do five months ago.
“I believe I’ll take a shower as well,” Castiel said. Dean refrained from telling him that that was the best idea he’d ever had. That would sound kind of weird.
Dean felt a tear break free, running hot down his cheek. He was a lot colder than he’d realized. It wasn’t getting any better, even in this car. If anything, it seemed even more frigid than outside.
The van they took down to State was much nicer than the bus they’d taken to Districts and Regionals. The windows didn’t rattle, though now that Dean knew how comfortable Castiel’s lap was, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to return to leaning against cold glass.
Dean yanked the door open, stomped out into the hall, and came face to face with Cas. His roommate took one look at him, blinked, and softened. “Oh, Dean. Bad day?”
“My honey won a few contests, as did Gabriel’s mint pie,” Castiel said. “The bakery has gained quite a bit of popularity in this town since you were last here. We bought the building next to us and did a large renovation. There are fourteen more employees than before.”
“You are profoundly selfish,” Castiel hissed, suddenly immensely disgusted with the creature sitting in front of him. “How could you be so shallow? This is a war that goes far deeper than a simple blood feud. I… I cannot believe this.”
The other boy’s eyes were closed, his face calm and angelic in the morning light. His chapped pink lips were parted a little as he breathed softly. His arms were warm and strong around Dean’s torso, his tanned, muscular chest bare. Actually, if Dean shifted a little, he discovered that
“Yes, probably,” Castiel replied. “We’ll see what happens after State, but I’m definitely thinking about it.”
“Yes, you’re Dean,” Castiel replied, sounding a little exasperated. “Would you like to spend your heat somewhere other than this hellhole? I would be happy to provide a safer, more comfortable space.”
Those five words smacked Dean in the chest like a freight train, warm and good. It made him feel like he was simultaneously flying and falling straight to the center of the earth. Dean choked on his next breath and had to cough it out, pretending like he’d inhaled some water. One of the swimmers on the deck patted him on the back until he stopped coughing.
The drive across the island, and the ferry ride after, was going to be a bitch. Dean felt his hands tighten on the wheel at the mere thought, his head giving an exhausted throb. He was so fucking close. He just needed to muster the energy for this last stretch, and then he could see Castiel and everything would be better.
They started driving again. Castiel opened his laptop and got to work on editing part of his latest work, frowning down at the screen. He didn’t look up until it was nearing six o’clock in the evening, the sun dipping toward the western horizon.
the transition was, how quickly the human before him grew into a large, beautiful dragon. The wings that sprouted from Castiel’s back when he was human grew larger, melting into powerful dragon shoulders. It only took a few seconds.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut. His chest felt like it was caving in underneath the weight of his soulmate’s fury. Michael kicked at him again, this one considerably less violent than the other. Dean’s body crumpled in on itself anyway. “Michael, I’m sorry,” he pleaded. The words came from his mouth easily. Practiced, routine, familiar. “Please, I s-swear I didn’t m-mean to.”
There was a pause, some static, and then the response. “Hunter zero-five-bravo, request for fuel capacity, report?”
Dean considered that. He wasn’t sure what about wearing a swimsuit with his best friend in the bathtub felt different than wearing a swimsuit at the beach, but it wasn’t the
The image of Dean and Benny in the water next to each other—along with that horrible, new jealous— stayed with Castiel the entire ride home.
“I’m okay, Cas,” Dean said quietly, sending warm shivers down Castiel’s spine despite what had just transpired. He liked hearing his new nickname coming from the merman. There was something magical about hearing it said in that light, elegant accent.
He remembered what he’d told Dean before, about the weak point at the back of a dragon’s head. He remembered Dean’s strange order. He’d wanted Castiel to get him close to Alastair. His entire plan had been to drop off Castiel’s back and land on Alastair’s, in a bid to end the Dragon King once and for all. That had been what he was going to do all along.
“Oh,” Dean said, looking painfully relieved as he saw the bags. Castiel felt another twinge of guilt. “Right. Sorry.”
“For what?” he managed. He’d meant for it to be cold and withdrawn, but his voice broke and ruined any chances of hiding the emotion boiling hot underneath his skin.
In that moment, Castiel sincerely wished he had never dropped Dean. He had never regretted anything more. Nothing. It had been foolish of him, and it had seriously hurt Dean. It had seriously hurt a lot of things.
Dean was still looking at his pen, which he was now tapping against the plastic covering his blueprint. “Oh, really? What kind of meddling?”
He realized he’d blown his cover and stepped out from behind the maze of stalagmites, wings lowered in a way that offered no aggression.
“How’s writing been?” Dean asked, nodding at Castiel’s laptop. It was still in its place on the left armrest of the couch. Castiel always sat there to write, since the position felt nice for his arms, and he was able to see out the window. He’d sat there so much that over the years he’d worn a sort of hole into the cushion. It was still quite comfortable, though Dean complained it was nearly impossible to get out of once he was seated.
No major warnings in this one, though Michael is a dick and Dean's thoughts suck, as always. I believe it's already kinda obvious from the title of the chapter (indicating the POV), but Dean is not the most reliable narrator, at all. Don't take what he thinks/says at face value (I know most of you won't, I'm just covering all my bases).
He went to his own bed and laid there for hours on end, staring up at the ceiling, replaying the feeling of Dean’s skin underneath his hand. He couldn’t fall asleep, not with the memory of how perfectly his hand fit the mark on the Omega’s shoulder.
It wasn’t like it mattered. Dean wasn’t going to live to see the end of the war. He’d resigned himself to that fact the first day after Alastair had captured him. There was no coming back from that.
Castiel tried to improve his mood for the man, whose name was apparently Balthazar. They connected over the fact that both of them had been named after angels, which was nice. The man was odd and eccentric, but Castiel figured he wasn’t exactly a normal person himself, so he couldn’t judge.
“That’s a wonderful idea, Dean,” Castiel encouraged. “What do you want to cook? I’m fairly sure we have chicken in the fridge.”
Dean held his breath, watching the consideration in those electric blue eyes. After a moment, Castiel knelt and offered his neck again.
Castiel was tempted to fire the gun just to get a reaction out of him, he was so shocked, but that would be stupid. Not that he was in the habit of doing smart things, if this situation was anything to go off of.
Castiel glared at him through his glasses. “Eight one hundreds on the sixty seconds. If you don’t make the sendoff, feel free to make some of those hundreds into seventy-fives.”
He didn’t speak to anyone as they all got out of the water for the end of practice. Castiel rinsed off and changed as quickly as he could, giving Benny a nod as he ducked out of the locker room. He thanked the coaches as he left, then hurried home.
They continued driving for a long time. Castiel bought them dinner again, and that was where Dean was introduced to something that he was going to
They drove all day. Castiel was beginning to get tired of the endless road, but he felt better when the plains and deserts of the Midwest turned into tall evergreen forests as they neared the coast. Dean liked the trees too, and he practically jumped out of his seat with excitement the first time they saw a herd of deer. Castiel could only hope they didn’t see a bear or a moose. He wasn’t sure Dean’s heart would be able to handle that.
Castiel wasn’t sure how much his shouting had registered, but he was fairly sure that the door slamming had been loud. He looked up, searching and listening for any indication that Dean might have woken, but his friend still seemed to be sound asleep. That was good. The last thing Castiel wanted was to have this conversation right now.
He laughed at the shower of purple sparks that appeared. Jess yelped and hid behind Sam as some of them exploded toward them, fizzling tall and bright for a good fifteen seconds before dying down. Sam was already bending down to set up another one, the spent gunpowder smoke of the firework drifting toward them.
Castiel imagined he could feel Dean’s body heat next to him, radiating from where their legs nearly touched under the covers. He wondered, in the darkness, what would happen if he simply turned and pressed his whole body up against Dean. If he took him into his arms and tucked Dean’s head under his chin and held him like he desperately wanted to.
Dean turned and headed for the stables at the end of the courtyard. It was huge, the summer sun beating down on the stones, just like Dean remembered. He reveled in the heat, smiling softly at the familiarity. The castle loomed off to the right. When the sun went down, its shadow would stretch all the way across the city walls and touch the base of the mountains.
“Guessing you heard that, then?” Dean asked bitterly, voice smaller and shakier than he’d intended. He gripped the edges of the towel tightly. When he inhaled, he realized it smelled like something sweet and earthy. Like... Like Castiel’s hair when it got wet. The other boy had given him his towel?
“Arrows,” Dean replied, snapping on his gauntlets and wrist guards with quick, efficient pops. “Tell me where the soft spots are. Where do I aim? I have a feeling Alastair will be wary of his eyes. He knows how Asmodeus died.”
Castiel smiled, eyes slightly mistier than before. “I know. I’m so, so grateful that you understand that. You’ve never once judged me for who I am. You never questioned if I had a particular thing I didn’t want to do. You handled me and all my concerns with beauty and grace. You’re perfection, Dean, and I am not fool enough to let you get away again. Not unless you want to.” He looked at Dean with eyes that weren’t quite pleading, but close.
Castiel washed his hair gently, and Dean pressed up against him to scent at his neck as the Alpha ran a soapy washcloth over them both. Once the smell of blood and the sewers had been washed off both of them, Castiel turned the water off and helped Dean out of the shower.
A warm hand wrapped around Dean’s left wrist. Dean blinked down at where Cas was holding him, a couple tears slipping free. “You have
Castiel nodded. “Yes.” He hesitated after, suddenly unsure. He’d made up his mind so thoroughly that he’d forgotten completely to ask Dean’s opinion. Typical of him as a human, he supposed. “Uh, that’s only if you want my help. I—”
“I always imagined that my soulmate would be perfect for me. Obviously, if the universe decided that we were meant to be together, it would have to be someone I would fall in love with easily,” Michael said. He sounded almost thoughtful. When he next spoke, though, his words were filled with ice-cold venom. “I never imagined my soulmate could end up being such a lumbering, idiotic, selfish oaf such as yourself.”
“No!” Castiel shouted, attempting to move forward. He found himself yanked back by several hard pairs of hands. More guards stepped forward, the sound of all their guns clicking ringing loud in Castiel’s ears.
Dean grinned at his confidence. “That’s good.” He paused, awkwardly kicking at a nearby pebble, and then smiled at Castiel again. “Alright. I need to head home. See you soon, Cas.”
Castiel held up a small, bloody fragment of metal. It was barely larger than the fingernail of his pinkie.
Blue fire streamed across the space between him and Ishim. In the last seconds before he melted his fellow dragon, Castiel saw Ishim’s eyes widen as he recognized his mistake.
Dean came out just as Castiel got the door unlocked. They both peered into the room at the same time as the door swung open, both grimacing at the single king bed that awaited them.
the war, when humans and dragons had lived in relative peace, side-by-side. He believed that could be achieved again. But first, the last of the three Princes of Hell needed to be weeded out.
Castiel, though… Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen blue accents on scales. It was incredible. And the sheer
life was on the line. Dean didn’t screw around with shit concerning Sammy’s safety. If that meant being an asshole to get him to listen, then so be it.
“Ten minutes,” the interrupting friend in question said, impressed. “That’s a huge gap. You’re tellin’ me you finished that set in five minutes?”
How was he going to get out of this? Castiel was no fool. He knew that once Dean woke up, there was going to be a very awkward conversation to have. Castiel wanted to avoid that if at all possible.
, not a summer house on th—oh, for God’s sake,” Castiel groaned. He shook his head. Dean read the faint amusement on his face and smiled despite the drying tear tracks on his face. “I don’t have
“Then whose is it?” Dean asked tiredly. He looked up at Castiel with flat, blank green eyes. They held none of their usual fire. It looked as if someone had taken a baseball bat to a previously unmarred pane of sea glass. “‘S not yours. You don’t deserve to have to deal with this.”
Castiel swallowed. He was tempted to say yes. Yes, of course Michael was treating Dean right. They were soulmates, that was what they did.
. I was ready to tear apart the world, Dean.” The young man in question was staring at Castiel, hardly daring to breathe. Castiel’s voice was getting shakier the longer he spoke. “I’ve never felt that kind of emotion before. I have never wanted to
Dean had tried thinking of other things to distract himself than his own failure. Of course, there was only so much he could focus on in his own past before it grew to be too much. It wasn't like any of his other thoughts were better, either.
“Well, let’s start with that, then,” Dean said, flipping his tail angrily in the water. Ripples ran across the surface. “We ain’t some kind of ‘race’ of... of weird things. What do you call those? Alans?”
“I have one brother,” Dean said, after a period of silence. He sounded halting, as if he wasn’t sure if he should be speaking of such things. Castiel wondered if he realized he’d already mentioned him once before. “His name… His name is Sammy. He’s fucking awesome.”
The human sat up now, muscles trembling and weak. He wasn’t given water often and was fed even less. He’d learned his lesson the first time he’d tried refusing food, trying to starve himself to death. By the end of Alastair’s ‘correction’, Dean had been begging him for food, begging him for anything to stop the pain.
“What—no! No, that’s not—no,” Castiel stammered, flushing dark red. “Not yet. We’re changing the relay order.”
John's face purpled with rage. He sheathed his sword messily, pointing to two guards on the wall. “Chain the traitor. We’re having a public execution right now.”
Castiel, at this point, speaks up. “Is it bad for humans to not receive the amount of hugs they need a day?” he asks, concerned. Dean hasn’t fallen over dead, yet, but it could happen. If he isn’t receiving everything he needs to survive, he could shut down or become seriously ill. Besides, Hippie Lady’s explanation of humans becoming grumpy and tired sounds very accurate.
Dean didn’t bother taking a shower or even changing out of his flight suit. His goal was to get the hell outta dodge as fast as he could, and he accomplished it fairly effectively. It was nearing 22:00 by the time he dragged his exhausted body out of the front doors of the main building.
with Castiel was enough for all his worries to sort of fade away. He wasn’t sure why. He figured it was the calm steadiness that the Alpha just seemed to exude, whether he was talking or moving or just standing still.
Today is no different. They’ve just finished a rather brutal ghost hunt, and they’re both exhausted. There’s a certain electricity in the air, though, a feeling that tells Castiel that the day might not be over yet.
Dean’s cheeks were flushed in the golden light, his lips swollen from kissing even as he gave Castiel a nervous smile. “Wouldn’t have bought condoms earlier if I didn’t.” His voice, despite the obvious bravado he’d been trying to project, was nervous and hesitant.
me, Dean! Left me in a boat on the beach so the Coast Guard could find me and take me to a hospital where the press could eat me alive and make me famous, and
Dean promptly shut him up with a kiss. Clyde rolled his eyes, drifting up and off, headed for a different part of the apartment for the night.
’ that Castiel can’t help but feel satisfaction at. Typically, Dean’s admirers seem to recognize that and back off. If they don’t, the scribbled numbers on receipts go in the garbage before they even leave the diner.
“What do you have planned for the rest of the night?” he asked as he gathered up the clothes he’d be wearing underneath the suit.
Making coffee was a routine that Dean easily carried out, humming ‘Enter Sandman’ as he worked their coffeemaker and poured heated water into their mugs to keep them warm. It was easy to complete well-rehearsed actions, but it
“Come on, baby,” Castiel panted against his forehead, pressing a kiss against his hairline. “Come on. Show me. Come for me.” He reached down to grasp Dean’s leaking erection and stroke it, and it was all over.
“The blame is not on me for your failure either,” Castiel snarled. “It is not my fault for believing in someone who should have been stronger.”
He must have actually dozed off, because when he woke next, sunlight was streaming through the windows and there was a young man sitting beside the bed.
“No, Cas,” Dean lied again. “Seriously. I was just a dumbass. It happens.” He grinned, throwing as much confidence and charm as he could into it. “You don’t have to go all Momma Bear. I’m all good.”
Castiel watched Dean hastily sling on his armor. The human prince’s movements were practiced and smooth, unaffected by the obvious panic that seemed to have descended upon the entire city. Dean Winchester did not strike Castiel as someone to get hysterical in a crisis, and so far, Dean seemed to be proving his intuition right.
“Oh.” Castiel yawned, shuffling into the kitchen like a zombie. “Thank you for making breakfast, Dean.”
, not knowing if his brain was going to be fried or not. He was scared that every little noise would trigger the damn thing. So far, talking didn’t seem to be a problem. Shouting, though... Dean shuddered to think of what would happen when that gaunt, awful human got his hands on him. ‘Doctor Alastair Prince,’ as he’d said when the humans had introduced themselves, seemed like he fully intended to make Dean scream.
Dean happily dug into the food, all previous anxiety and discomfort forgotten. He talked Castiel’s ear off about culinary school and how he was only a few weeks out from getting his degree and blowing out of there. The Alpha was kind and supportive, something Dean was still getting used to. He didn’t think he’d ever heard the words ‘Good job’ and ‘I’m proud of you’ from anyone but his younger brother before.
It's basically where two dragons charge at each other and grapple. They use wings, tails (some of them are clubbed or spiked; Castiel's is not, and therefore, useless), and claws. Like I said earlier, using fire is like bringing a sword to a fistfight. It will probably damage both dragons because they're so close to each other, and it is seen as extremely dishonorable. Ishim was violating thousands of years of dragon code by skipping the grappling part and going right for the kill. He was also being dumb, because Castiel's fire is most definitely going to win in any situation.
Dean woke up pleasantly sore and well-rested. He laid where he was for a moment, content to simply have his eyes closed. The room was cool and the bed was warm and soft. The air smelled of sandalwood.
Dean stood awkwardly next to him. Castiel gave him a small smile as an invitation, something in his chest warming at the relieved look on the green-eyed boy’s face. Dean put down his plastic bag on the bench next to Castiel.
Dean’s Beans sat right at the edge of the business district in town, straddling the divide between one of the community colleges and a whole street lined with departments and firms. The morning shift was always brutal, since the flow of exhausted college students and frantic businesspeople didn’t seem to stop for a solid three hours. By the time Dean arrived at his café, however, everything had quieted down.
exhausted. He happily followed Castiel through the large room and into an even bigger one, then down a hallway. Castiel gestured to the room at the end. “That’s the master. This is the guest room. If you don’t like it, you can take the master, but I—”
There were none. The merman’s previous defiance seemed to have disappeared for the moment. He was limp on the table, his green eyes tracking Castiel’s movements carefully. Castiel finished unlocking all of his restraints and couldn’t help a small smile of triumph when the merman relaxed against the table a little more, seemingly much calmer now that he wasn’t bound. “See?” the doctor smiled. “Nothing to be afraid of. That wasn’t too—”
Castiel turned from their grumpy neighbor to find his husband coming up the stairs to him, bouquet of flowers in hand and apology already written all over his handsome face. He looked heartbreakingly remorseful, and Castiel reflected that he probably needed to be less of a hardass in the future. His husband hated when people were disappointed in him. Poor Dean.
“Apologies, ma’am.” Dean gave her his best smile. “That’s the sound of freedom.” He winked and turned away, ducking into the passenger seat of the Impala to pull out a beautiful bouquet of flowers.
He released the Alpha slowly and hurried to cover the hand on his mark when Castiel tried to pull away. Dean pressed Castiel’s hand into his own skin, looking up at the Alpha’s blue eyes. “I ain’t sorry,” he whispered, feeling the pull of his bandages when he gave Castiel a little smile. “I’m
At some point, when the mayor stopped talking and someone else started saying something, Dean took the opportunity to turn to Michael and mutter, “I’ve gotta get some water.” Instead of responding, Michael simply shot him a disapproving frown and turned back to the person telling the story. Dean took that as a dismissal.
The only difference, Cas supposed, was found in the two angels. Because where he was thrilled to see his beloved human so open and happy and trusting, his younger counterpart paid Dean no mind. He was cold and careless, just as Cas had been more than a decade ago. This Castiel hadn’t learned to treasure Dean’s smile yet. He hadn’t learned to love Dean yet.
Dean felt nausea twist his insides. He worked up a ball of phlegm in his mouth, rallied his courage, and spat it right in the gray-eyed Alpha’s face. “Fuck you.”
Castiel frowned, eyes taking on that stubborn look to them that Dean had learned to fear. Oh, there was no way he was getting out of this one. “Dean, this isn’t about what you
“Ms. Milton, what a pleasure!” A familiarly cold, smooth voice suddenly spoke up, startling Dean badly. He wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or worried when Michael magically appeared at his side. A quick glance at his soulmate’s face showed that he was definitely upset, just hiding it behind a charming smile.
Meg glared at Balthazar. “Shut the fuck up.” She turned to Castiel, eyes not getting any less hard. “Who
Castiel climbed out of bed on the other side, making sure his body was facing away from Dean. He hurried over to his bag and knelt, ignoring the way his half-hard dick rubbed against the material of his boxers. Castiel found himself biting his lip
Castiel frowned down at his phone, fiddling with it for a bit before he got the right information pulled up. “It says we’re about forty minutes away. Why do you ask?” They’d driven this route so many times, he was fairly sure Dean knew it pretty well.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel rumbled. He tilted his head to the side as the human blinked blearily at him. “Would you like water or food first?”
“Uh, like, ash gray? And rust red, and then some sort of maroon color-" Jo cut off as she ducked out of the path of two guards running past, carrying armfuls of swords. The castle was alive with preparation for what could possibly be another battle. It made a sick feeling swirl in Castiel’s stomach.
For one heartbreaking second, Dean thought Cas was there. Then he realized that the figure standing in his living room was too tall, his shoulders not broad enough, body the wrong shape, hair the wrong color.
He was cutting his hair one day a month or so after the first night on Eden’s peak, squinting at his reflection in the mirror as he struggled to shave the hairs at the side of his head evenly with his dagger, when he saw Castiel come up behind him.
to do this, though. He was sick and tired of the shoals living in terror, frightened of the greedy humans who just took and took and
. I am giving you a chance to end the war that has been tearing apart our lands for centuries. You should be ecstatic. You should be thanking me.”
“Sure, Cas,” Dean said. He took a step back toward his own apartment, bag heavy in his hand. “I’m gonna, uh, go now. I’ll see you around.”
Dean watched nervously as everyone else stepped up to the edge of the water. Castiel was still rolling out his shoulders, right up until the referee called for them to jump in.
The contrast between the chaos of outside and the surprising warmth and peace of the living room Castiel had landed in was laughable. Outside the window, police sirens roared as several squadrons’ worth of policemen screamed down the streets, their lights flashing and their tires spinning on the rain-slick streets. The scent of ozone and wet pavement was wafting through the now-open window, cutting through the distinctly lingering scent of baking apple pie.
Castiel put his face in his hands and sniffled, gritting his teeth against the ache in his chest. He was irrationally angry, angry at Dean and angry at the stupid person who was driving a wedge between them and angry at
, Dean had replied. He’d never get to tell Castiel how much he truly loved him. His dragon would never hear the words he so deserved.
Anna’s form began to shift, morphing from a small human woman to a large female dragon. Castiel watched as she dipped her head in farewell, then spread her rose-and-gold wings to catch a mountain breeze. In the space of a few heartbeats, she was gone.
After that, it was an endless string of crying and seeing people he thought he’d never see again. Bobby very nearly had a heart attack when Sam burst into his office, screaming that Dean was home. Ellen hugged Dean hard, then promptly remarked that he was way too skinny and needed to eat. Missouri, the Head Nurse, managed to get in through the fray of people welcoming Dean home. She treated his burns and cuts with gentle hands and tear-filled eyes, a small smile on her lips. When she’d finished, she promptly kissed him on the forehead.
“No, no,” Dean cut in, shaking his head vigorously. At the look Castiel gave him, he flushed red and explained, “
“You’re very warm,” Castiel remarked as they danced past another couple. “Your heat is due in a week or two, yes?”
“Well, now I’m eating, uh...” Dean trailed off, calculating for a moment. “Now I’m eating a whole two-thirds by myself, so there.”
Benny sighed. “No, but it was put up as a threat. I suppose your return and your claim that dragons were the good guys really twisted his melon. He couldn’t handle it. I’m really sorry he tried to kill you, and that he hurt you so bad.”
. After all, eloquence and subtlety weren’t exactly things Castiel and Dean were good at. And besides, Clyde had
Dean wasn’t in the nest. He was in the opposite corner, curled up around what Castiel recognized as his college hoodie. The Alpha was scenting it repeatedly between sniffles and shaky exhales. It broke Castiel’s heart.
“Oh, and taking me is... ack-sept-bull?” Dean sounded out, angry. “Not fair. None of this is fair.” He glared at the doctor, baring his teeth slightly in anger. He knew lots of bad words, but he chose the one that seemed appropriate at the moment. “Dicksucker.”
“Just tell him you’re sick,” Castiel pleaded. “You don’t have to say anything about going or not going. Just tell him you’re sick. He’ll understand.” Castiel clenched his hands into fists in his lap. “If he doesn’t, there’s something wrong with him. It’s cruel to expect you to go to a party when you’re this ill.”
Castiel sat, frozen, barely daring to move. His heart was pounding hard enough for him to see it on the edges of his vision.
“Is it?” Dean asked, turning to look at Castiel finally. The dragon found himself speechless at the raw emotion in Dean’s eyes. The fear and desperation, the broken sadness. “Is it? Cas, I just admitted to you that I killed all those dragons because I was
? How could Michael be lucky, if he was the one with the fuck-up for a soulmate? Dean wasn’t worth much, he knew that. How could Michael be lucky?
Just kidding. Hello! I am SO excited to post this chapter for you, you have NO idea. I really hope you like this chapter more than the last one. I'm in the mood for some reunion, yeah?
king. That you want me to end a war that has been feeding you and your asshole friends for centuries? Yeah, right,” Dean hissed.
Castiel helped pull Dean out of the water, unable to keep himself from pulling Dean against him. Dean’s muscles were trembling lightly. Castiel wasn’t sure if he was imagining the way the other boy leaned against him. “You did amazing,” Castiel rumbled in his ear. Dean beamed up at him, looking exhausted. “You dropped half a second.”
Castiel had told him in one of their recent talks that the Demons didn’t really have a uniform, and they wouldn’t usually wear it in public. They did, however, have a symbol that Dean might see on various clothes or even tattooed on various parts of their bodies. He’d learned to look out for the pentagram when he was observing the dining room. He saw a surprisingly large amount.
“H-Hey, Cas?” he called. Gods, was his voice trembling. “Cas, c-can we please go down? Please? P-Please, Cas, just a little.
“I could ask you the same question,” Castiel replied, voice croaky and inhumanly deep. He cleared his throat. “I slept fine, thank you. How did
too tight. It was uncomfortable, but Dean didn’t think Castiel noticed. He just kind of wished they hadn’t gotten out of there so fast. Flying on Castiel’s back was much better than being carried.
The dark-haired boy wasn’t quite sure why Dean liked him so much. He knew he was kind of a prickly asshole, and he hadn’t been very warm toward Dean especially. Despite his cold attitude, the green-eyed boy followed him like a lost puppy at meets and constantly had one-sided conversations with him during practice. The only time Dean ever shut up was when he physically couldn’t speak, too out of breath to do anything but gasp for air, cheeks pinked with exertion, water dripping off his face unimpeded.
“Yeah,” Dean replied. He sighed. “Problem is, he knows me. Knows you. Knows our strengths and weaknesses. You’re small compared to him, no offense. Small and kinda weak.”
“Fuck the relay,” Castiel hissed, the ferocity in his voice surprising Dean. “You’re more important than the relay. And you’re
“That’s okay,” Castiel soothed, stroking the back of his Alpha’s neck. “I’m so proud of you for telling me, Alpha. Thank you.” He kissed the top of Dean’s head, pride flooding through him despite how sad he was. They’d been working on Dean’s openness about being in pain. It was a hard journey, since Dean had been conditioned since he was born to swallow his pain and ‘Alpha up,’ but they’d come a long way.
Castiel threw out his wings with a sudden snap, startling a yelp out of Dean. Castiel’s wings were huge, easily larger than the drawbridge at Lawrence’s castle. The dragon gave a terrifying rumble as he stretched his limbs, getting used to the body.
“Mmm, yes. And Sam is very handsome. I’m glad you convinced him to go with the tie instead of the bow,” Castiel said. He gave a soft smile. “He looks very happy.”
“Stars look the same,” Dean remarked when he and Castiel landed. Castiel had to shift before he could answer, his dragon form shrinking as he slowly grew to a man around Dean’s size. When he was fully in his human form, he stepped up beside his king and looked up at the sky.
Dean smiled and gave him an adorable little wave, then turned and started heading for the other side of the parking lot. Castiel watched him go for as long as he could see him. It was only when Dean disappeared into the shadows and moonlight that Castiel finally turned around and went home.
Dean laughed against his lips. “You do too. Shit, that was... wow.” He looked up at Castiel with shiny green eyes, a beautiful smile on his face. “Sorry I, uh, messed up the first part.”
Dean finished the frosting and set it aside just as the timer for the oven beeped. Dean checked on the cookies, decided they needed a little longer to bake, and shut the door again. He set the timer for five minutes.
Castiel hums, unsurprised, pleased that Dean had been so forthright. While it doesn’t seem like much, coming from Dean, it’s surprisingly straightforward and to the point. Usually, there’s a lot more that Castiel has to wade through before he can get to the core of what Dean really wants.
anyone hurt Dean, it was over. Dean, his fiery, sarcastic, compassionate, beautiful prince. The prince who had risked his life dozens of times to save a little brother he loved more than the world. The prince who had never once looked at him for being less than the dragon he was inside. The young man who had accepted Castiel for who he was, strange tail and wings and all, who had actually
“Huh?” Dean managed. He blinked slowly, confused when Castiel reached forward and cupped his face gently. “What’re you—what—Cas?”
He gave her a watery smile of his own. “I cannot thank you enough, Anna. You… You have no idea how much your acceptance means to me.”
Dean responded by snoring softly, curling closer to Castiel. The Alpha couldn’t contain his pleased rumble then, gently adjusting the sleepy Omega so he’d be as comfortable as possible. Castiel made sure Dean had a tight hold on his bee, tucked the blanket around him, and settled in for the rest of the movie with a sleepy Omega plastered to his side.
now. We’re going later,” Dean said. He poured the coffee when it was ready and walked over to hand Castiel his mug, shivering a little at the brush of their fingertips over the warm ceramic. “Drink up, huggy bear.”
He slapped the wall, elbow popping painfully as he did. The Sparrows went wild. When Dean turned to look at the board, his eyes widened as he realized he’d beat the opposing team by four tenths of a second.
Dean snorted, gesturing with his chin at the kitchen. “Yeah, well I’m poor, so I don’t have any of the fancy stuff. Sorry, man.” He rubbed the back of his neck in a gesture that Castiel recognized as awkwardness. “Sandwiches are pretty fancy eating, for me.” Castiel caught the undercurrent of insecurity in his words again.
He expected Dean to be hiding in his room or in the kitchen, but he found him in the living room, setting a just-folded blanket down on the couch. When Castiel entered the room, Dean looked up with a warm smile. “Heya, Cas,” he whisper-called, voice low just in case Castiel’s migraine would be affected by it.
Castiel’s house was warm. It smelled of spice and something delicious, like baking bread. Dean felt the tension drain ever so slightly from his shoulders. He kept them up and back despite that, discipline written into every line of his body, but he felt some of his fear from before begin to dissipate.
Those icy eyes widened as Dean’s gun came to a stop pointing at him. He could feel the surprise of everyone in the room like a physical weight, could see the Angels turn and stare at their brother in shock out of the corner of his eye.
. I don’t know. I just… I can’t… I keep tryin’ to make this work because if it doesn’t… If it doesn’t…”
“Cas,” Dean said. Castiel had been mostly ignoring him, the excited look on his face doing something horrible to the dark pit in Castiel’s chest. He looked over sharply, though, at the tightness and fear that had suddenly appeared in the merman’s voice. Dean was staring out the window, eyes wide, face pale even in the dim light of evening. “Look.”
Whether or not that happens, the end is nigh! I'll see you all soon. ;) Thank you for being amazing.
He followed the dragon out of the cave, though. Castiel had given him clothes a few days ago, thankfully, so Dean was wearing some thick pants and a wool jacket. His boots were nice, nicer than some of the boots he’d had growing up. He wondered where Castiel had gotten the clothes from.
“Yes, yes, please,” Dean begged, breathless. His eyes were squeezed shut tightly, lips parted in ecstasy. “Another one, please,
Castiel staggered faster, still holding onto hope, and flinched as he heard the crack of a crossbow again. This time, thankfully, the arrow cut through the air above his head. It was a close call.
Castiel released Dean’s hands and threw his arms around his shoulders. Dean grunted, startled, as he was drawn in close to his friend’s muscular chest. Castiel immediately tucked Dean’s head under his chin, arms squeezing tight.
“I’m here,” Castiel soothed, holding out his hands to show he wasn’t holding anything and that he didn’t intend to harm. “I...” The doctor trailed off, swallowing thickly. It felt like his throat had somehow closed up completely in a matter of seconds. His next words were a whisper. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Dean glanced over at him, that brokenness from before gone, replaced with the fire that Castiel knew so well.
Dean, predictably, melted against him. His arms came up hesitantly, hands gripping loosely at the back of Castiel’s hoodie. Dean buried his face into Castiel’s shoulder, tucking his nose right up against the fold of the hood and Castiel’s neck.
It was early afternoon on a Friday. Dean nodded, trying to figure out how that went. Thankfully, before he had to ask, Cam spoke up like he’d been reading his mind. “We’ve got hotel rooms,” he explained. “Pretty sure we’re booked fifteen minutes away, right, coach?”
“What are you going to do, then?” Castiel managed, trying to seem challenging. It came out more curious than anything. “You’re in the middle of a compound of armed guards and security cameras, and you can’t possibly think you’ll get very far on dry land without legs.” He eyed the merman’s beautiful tail. “What’s your plan?”
Before Dean could argue, the angel reached for a washcloth and began to soap it up, running it over Dean’s tired muscles. If Dean had had more than six hours of sleep in the past three days, he might have put up more of a fight. As it was, he’d just cried his eyes out and then had a fucking awesome orgasm. He could barely keep his eyes open. Castiel seemed to sense this. He was gentle but quick as he finished washing all the remaining mud off of Dean’s body.
What he’d said was true, though. He wouldn’t have helped Dean with the fire. He… He didn’t have the same conventional fire as his brethren. It was part of why he had been alienated as a hatchling. It was something he would rather forget.
Peering around the crate was more dangerous than Castiel anticipated. He managed to get a few shots off, then realized he was about to get his head blown off and ducked back behind cover.
The prince blinked, then burst out laughing. Castiel frowned, wondering if he’d said something wrong again. A moment later, Dean stopped laughing and gave him a warm, affectionate smile. “Cas, you’re fucking awesome.”
Dean was simultaneously angry and touched. Touched, because it was kind of Castiel to be willing to wait. Kind of him to be so patient and understanding. Dean was angry, though, because there were people
“Well done today, Dean,” Castiel said, bringing Dean crashing out of his thoughts. “Thirty-three minutes is no time to laugh at.” Castiel nodded at the whiteboard where the boys’ times had been recorded in fading brown marker.
Dean nodded sleepily, still leaning close to the warmth of Castiel’s neck. “Yeah, that sounds good. Can I have some more water, please?”
He turned around and held out his arms, and before Dean even knew what he was doing, he leaned forward and hugged the doctor. Castiel hugged him right back, his arms warm and strong around Dean’s body, almost as good as they’d been when he’d woken up that morning. Castiel squeezed Dean tightly, then pulled away to look at him. “You can probably take off your clothes now. You can... You can go.” He looked off to the side, nodding at the wide stretch of ocean. “You’re free.”
“Get Gabriel if you can find him,” Michael called after the young Angel. As the door slid shut, the oldest Novak shook his head. “Fucking newbies.”
“Do you want a sandwich?” that same smooth voice asked, startling Castiel back into awareness. He narrowed his eyes at the Omega, who was watching him carefully from behind the kitchen counter. He nodded at Castiel’s gun. “Your hand is shaking. You want some food?”
