But he knows the it will come out just as hollow as every other lie he’s told. He just shakes his head, wearily rubbing at his eyes.
Steve cuts him off so sharply Tony doesn’t even have time to react, “I do. That’s why I wanted you to tell me.” He gives him a weak smile. “Because I’m in love with you, Tony. I have been for so,
He hopes that Steve can forgive him, someday. He hopes that he’ll find someone that makes him happy. He knows that he’ll find some way to move on without him-- they all will. It’s just a matter of letting go, himself.
“Mm, I know,” Natasha agrees easily, tilting her head slightly to look at him, “Almost as stubborn as someone else I know.”
“Banner would find that insulting and you know it,” Clint replies. “I’m in position, Captain. Stark’s all yours.”
Bruce and Steve seem more inclined to try to help than anything, pushing down the apprehension in favor of trying to find a solution. Thor comes to him with apologies, guilt-ridden that he hadn’t joined the fight sooner. Clint reacts to it as he does everything, which is with humor to break the tension. Natasha watches him with curious glances, but otherwise, they carry on as usual.
“You know I hate magic, Strange,” Tony says, rubbing at his forehead in annoyance. “More so than usual, right now. I’m not gonna drink your voodoo coffee.”
Steve doesn’t have feelings for him, and if he found out… the guilt would eat him alive. He already carries
Tony’s HUD lights up as soon as Clint’s in a freefall, trajectories and warnings flashing across his vision. Considering how many hours they’ve spent training for this-- and how often Tony’s teammates enjoy jumping off buildings-- catching Clint is probably the easiest thing he’ll do today. It’s a harder catch than he’s sure the archer would prefer, but he doesn’t really have room to bitch about it.
a self-centered prick.” Stephen rolls his eyes so hard Tony’s fairly sure they nearly roll right out of his head.
genius.” Strange fires back, not bothering to look up as he flips to the next page. “She used plant-based magic, correct? What were the
“This isn’t something I can pick apart and put back together, I-- I’m out of my fucking depth here, and I don’t have a chance in
But that doesn’t make any sense-- is it just because Tony’s in pain? He’s always been sombre when one of them is hurt, but not… not like this.
“I love you, Tony,” Steve tells him again. “...I-- don’t know if the words alone are supposed to break it, or-- how does this work?” It takes him a second to catch up and realize he means the
If the witch is gone, then Tony stands no chance of knowing what it was exactly that she did to him.
Speaking of which, Rhodey and Pepper take the news about the same as they did last time. Which is to say, they’re grateful he actual
“You know that none of this works without you, don’t you?” Natasha speaks so quietly he’s not even sure if he’s meant to hear the words. “Not because of your tech, or your money, or your tower. We
“I didn’t, at first,” Steve says evenly, not rising to the bait. But there’s a furrow to his brow that wasn’t there before, and Tony knows he’s getting to him already. “I wanted to believe that you wouldn’t lie to us. But I couldn’t… I couldn’t take that risk, Tony. If there was any chance…”
“You know,” Tony mumbles, “we’ve really gotta stop meeting like this, Cap.” Steve’s frown transforms into a weary smile in an instant, a look of fond exasperation in his eyes. Tony’s rather used to it at this point, but it still manages to draw a tired grin out of him.
“She said something about-- about greed, about killing the earth,” he frowns, rubbing a hand at his chest where it twinges in pain, “But something about me, specifically.
The first sign of trouble surfaced in the middle of listening to a distress call on the common frequency. Rushed voices spoke in a garbled tongue that neither Tony nor Nebula understood, but they picked up on the rise and fall in tones, a symphony of distress, anxiety, and along the way, the voices dropped from the channel one by one. Only a solitary, quivering voice remained, pleading before the broadcast ended without warning.
. Yes, a hundred times, yes, Steve. Please—” His voice cracks when Steve unzips his trousers with finesse and skilled, eager fingers slip inside to cup his erection.
Tony sighs, combing his fingers through his hair; it’s due for a trim soon. On his way from LA, when the proposition still sounded like a bright idea, he didn’t anticipate having to explain to Steve why the CEO of an industry titan couldn’t just send off a press release announcing his apparent bisexuality. “It's not the same. I know you get a kick out of Siri and the Roombas, but the 21st century isn't as progressive as you think it is. Anyway, it's not something I think I am ready to make public, and I am sorry I put you on the spot like that. That was wrong and I—” Tony guns for a hasty exit but Steve grabs his arm.
Nebula’s eyes, black and bug-like, flashed. The metal casing around her left eye jutted out with a pop. A small holographic projection of Thanos appeared. “I’ll show you,” she said.
“It's not—” Tony shakes his head and takes in a deep breath. “They can't help me.” He shifts closer and offers an encouraging smile. But Steve narrows his eyes as if he's beginning to doubt Tony's intentions. “There's this guy, Steve, he's a pretty charming fella. I never thought I'd swing this way, you know, but I think, I think I kinda like him. Really,
He recalled simpler times with Steve: Settling into the Tower between missions, staying up late in matching pyjamas and coffee mugs in hands while it snowed outside, changing the tire on Steve’s motorbike, the smell of grease in his nostrils and the oil stains caught on cheap, dollar-store t-shirts, dragging Steve away from a farmer’s market before his outrage at the price of onions—“How can anyone charge $5 for this, Tony? This is a daylight robbery!”—boiled over into a fistfight.
On some level, the Avengers reminded Tony of the nebulae lurking in distant corners of an endless universe: violent celestial reactions that pushed matter together to grow larger, and hotter, becoming unstable, and eventually fusing into new stars, then planets to solar systems. When the first call to assemble came, the gravity of the situation—Loki’s invasion—pulled them together, like clumped matter, and from the scorching heat of repulsors and plasma cannons, and a blazing nuclear explosion set against the impenetrable depths of deep space, the Avengers were born.
“I don’t know what’s going on back home,” he said, rubbing his eyes, sleepiness pooling around the edges of his consciousness. Tony lost track of when he last slept but knew it had been before the plan, to return home, regroup and avenge, exploded in his face. “Can’t be anything good. It’s madness out here. This ship is pretty much done for. The power core collapsed, and we have no way of finding help because I’m not sure if there’s anyone left to help. The guy who owned the ship is dead. A bloke from Missouri. He loved
“Good. Yeah, all good, really good.” That's all Tony manages until he tears his gaze away from Steve and looks at the cold, carpeted floor. With his hands jammed into his pockets, Tony's mind works in overdrive as it tries to articulate why he cancelled a day’s worth of meetings at Stark Industries, flew from Los Angeles to New York, and ended up in the gym alone with Steve Rogers.
Steve raises a brow and stifles a smirk. Clearing his throat, he says, “I'm sorry, but didn't the tabloids catch you pants down last month with an oil heiress? I had to explicitly ban Clint from ever talking about that because it was starting to interfere with our work."
The screen fluttered. No sound came from inside the helmet. Tony reached forward, turning it off, sitting in partial darkness. Thoughts bubbling just beyond his consciousness threatened to erupt, engulf him whole, and Tony wilted under the overwhelming pressure. His mind replayed the actions from the beginning that led him to a remote corner of the universe, lost, without a way of finding his way back home. It started with a blinding column of blue light that shot up into the cloudless sky.
, he thinks to himself. While Steve never hid his preferences in partners from the team, once, after plenty of prodding and poking from the Spy Twins, he had confessed he was not ready for intimacy. Adjusting to the 21st century was hard enough, a relationship would only complicate matters, Steve had said.
Tony swallowed. His throat felt parched. He last had a sip of water before recording his eighth message two days earlier. Nebula had insisted her mechanical modifications could sustain her without water a lot longer than Tony could survive, but he conserved their limited supply anyway. A subconscious part of him tried speeding up the inevitable.
Tony coughed, his eyes closed. Before his mind could wander off into the old, abandoned bunker hidden by a blanket of white in freezing temperature, a regular feature in his frantic dreams, Nebula jerked him awake. He flinched on instinct and moved a hand up along his chest, fingers trying to claw through the skin-tight suit as if reaching for an unscratched itch underneath. In the narrow space between his heart and heaving lungs, Tony felt a phantom pressure build—of indestructible metal and untempered rage. It weighed him down and kept him immobile on the ship's hard, unfeeling surface.
Since Steve came out of the ice, helped stop an alien invasion and moved into the Tower, Tony discovered the Captain’s many peculiarities that are never mentioned in the brochures they hand out at the Smithsonian's Captain America exhibit — such as his love for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Once, in a drunken haze, Tony had offered to buy the team and relocate them from Los Angeles, back to Brooklyn, but Steve, flustered, probably by the generous offer, had mumbled something like, “You don't have to do that, Tony. Things changed the way they were meant to, and my being here after 70 years shouldn't affect that.”
you. There, I said it. Words I never thought I’d hear coming out of my mouth, not so soon, anyway, but dying has a funny way of making you re-evaluate priorities.”
The ship crawled around the outer edges of mammoth gas clouds — up close they were invisible, nothing more than clumps of dust left undisturbed for billions of years, waiting for just the right conditions before matter could coalesce, and morph into blinding, radiant stars lighting up another dark spot in an endless universe.
the dirty tricks, every one of them. First, I am going to show you, get you started with a good demonstration. What do you say?”
When they break apart, Tony grabs onto Steve to steady himself. The awkwardness grows between them, hanging thick in the gym’s warm, crisp air. Steve shrugs and offers a small smile. “Well, this was fun while it lasted,” he says, wiping his mouth on his t-shirt. “I hope that was enough of a demonstration to please your guy.” He pats Tony's shoulders and drags his feet towards the exit.
It sounded familiar. Deep, baritone and laced with worry—the kind of paranoid worrying that Tony used to once make fun of. His mind swam in a sea of foggy memories, trying to remember the owner of that voice. It must’ve belonged to a friend, he thought. The voice seemed
Nebula’s voice floated across the radio. “This is the Benatar. We are stranded, we are out of food and water, and we are a man down. We need medical assistance and—”
“Your clothes smell. Here, these were Quill’s. They’ll fit you,” Nebula told him one day after a meal—Tony lost track of breakfasts, lunches and dinners. They ate every eight hours when an alarm pinged on his watch, reminders for meal times. The food left on board was freeze-dried, packaged in sealed containers, and came in various colours. Everything tasted bland, unappetizing, but the growls in his stomach forced Tony to swallow every bite, even when the insides of his mouth felt like dried husk.
She stands at the heart of the tree trunk sized vines, the bottom half of her body contorted to grow into the very plants that spread across the streets. Her skin is a sickly shade of greens and browns, cracked like the bark of a tree. If she were human before, she’s certainly not now.
“I’m serious,” he continues to bluff, “fit as a fiddle. I could probably run a marathon if I wanted. Not that I do, but I could--”
Not like you are now.” Her words hang heavy in the air for a moment, before Tony decides that he’s had
he bites out a bitter laugh, “I’m too much of a coward. But I couldn’t let this be on you, Steve-- it’s not your fault if you don’t--”
to me?” Her voice barely raises an octave, but the effect is still the same. Tony’s jaw snaps shut, though he still watches her with guarded eyes. He doesn’t like where this is going, and he’s not going to let her pull his defense apart like it’s nothing.
at him, raising her arms to conduct the nearby vines, sending them shooting after him. He spins out of the way, speeding off into the sky and staying just barely out of their reach.
“If you tell me no, then I’ll believe you.” Steve says softly, the faintest tremor to his voice. “I won’t ask again, I swear. But if it’s true, I…” If it’s true.
Steve’s answering smile is easily one of the most beautiful things he’s ever seen in his life. “Never been more sure about anything.” Then his mouth is on his, and Tony’s thoughts white out entirely.
Tony pushes aside his annoyance with Strange to rack his brain, trying to piece together what it was
“If Strange is wrong about Arna, then Steve’s going to make sure we have all of our bases covered. If there’s any chance that she’s a mutant, or if the X-Men have encountered magic like hers before, he wants to know.” She sighs quietly, running a hand through her hair. “I guess we really don’t have a lot of other options at this point.”
“We’ve done just fine without him before,” Natasha huffs out, narrowly avoiding getting slammed by a haphazard vine. “But I won't lie, the lightning would really help.”
“Everything’s just coming up daisies, isn’t it?” Tony says, a ghost of a smile on his face, “So give it to me straight, Doc; how much time do I have left?”
damage him, it would have affected him by now, right? The arc reactor was clearly still functioning, if his heart rate was normal. Or at least, it
“Take me back to the tower, we’re done here.” Tony snaps, tearing his gaze away at last and turning his back on him. Stephen sighs in resignation, but draws his hand up to spark the portal to life. The Sanctum gives way to the familiar heart of the workshop, and Tony doesn’t hesitate to step through.
“Aw, Brucie bear, don’t be like that,” he grins, “besides-- you’ve already got your own beefy blonde to hit on. You don’t have to pull poor Steve into this.”
“Well aren’t you a star spangled sight for sore eyes?” Tony says with a lazy salute, trying to appear as casual as possible. He still drinks in the sight of him, dressed down to jeans and a faded shirt, the familiar leather jacket and wind tousled hair--
a next time in the first place.” Steve carefully places a hand against his jawline, tracing along his cheekbone with his thumb. Tony feels his breath catch in his lungs, but for once, it’s not due to the vines.
DUM-E has come rolling over to investigate the commotion, whirring softly in concern as he extends his claw to Tony. “Look, now we’ve even got this bucket of bolts fretting over me. You’re all a bunch of mother hens.”
Her anger shifts as she considers him, watching him with calculating eyes. “You hide yourself away in your technology, but you are just as human as the rest of them. Your heart betrays your desire to
He’s not sure how he’s supposed to feel about it, but there’s a twist at his heart that has nothing to do with the vines that rest there. He knows that Steve cares for him in some capacity-- he’s called him his best friend more times than he can count, after all. Maybe he just doesn’t want to see Tony like this, wheezing and weak. He can’t find it in him to blame him for it, but… if he’s going to die for love, for Steve, then he at least wants to see him one last time.
He’s sitting in one of the nearby loungers, his sketchbook in his lap. He’s cleaned up from the battle, freshly showered and dressed in his civvies once more. He wonders how long he’s been out, if they managed to
to, I just-- I know you, Steve. If this is the only way to keep me alive, then I know you’re going to take the risk.”
Tony questions as he flies past the archer’s perch. Large vines have begun scaling the nearby high-rise buildings, the concrete structures groaning and cracking under the weight. The repulsor blasts rip through them well enough, but they’re growing at a faster rate than Tony can contain them.
“I’m telling you, Natasha, there isn’t. If Strange can’t help me, then neither can you.” There’s a sense of finality to his words, something so stubborn and deadset that she drops her hand from his arm. For the briefest moment he thinks that maybe she’s left him already, before she speaks again.
For an alien vessel, the Benatar was compact; it was smaller than what Tony had expected; the ship’s size resembled commercial passenger jets ferrying hundreds of passengers daily around the Earth. The flight deck had been fitted with a curved glass extending outwards from floor to ceiling. The sleeping berths lined up the back of the aircraft, next to the galley and storage units, and there was an empty docking bay at the tail end. A small elevator shaft from the galley led down to the cargo hold where, behind a narrow door, the ship’s reactor core stood. It was the heart of the ship, giving it the means to move at near light speed and cover great distances in the cosmic vastness. The reactor’s blue glow matched the one in Tony’s chest.
The rest of the day went by quickly and before Peter knew it, it was time to go home. Happy was waiting by his locker when he came out, and said hi to Ned and MJ who he had met up with at lunch. ”Hey kids, how was winter break?”  Ned and MJ gave short recaps of what they’d done. Happy had formed good relationships with Peters two best friends. He kept telling Pete it was simply in his job description to know who they were when Peter hung out with them, but the softness in Happys eyes told him otherwise.
I appreciate kudos and comments if you liked it, and I'm also available to talk on my tumblr at the username "lerums".
Peter felt his uncle’s contemplating stare at him. He would have said something to dismiss the subject, but he didn’t know what that would have been.  So Peter kept silent, trying to play the patience game despite knowing his uncle Jim was the most patient man he knew.
Steve stepped in, rubbing Peter’s back. ”Peter, I’m sorry that it wasn’t made clear to you, but meds will probably never stop you from experiencing signs of your ADHD. It only helps a certain amount. The purpose of this is so that you can get the upper hand on it, and deal with the rest of your symptoms on your own. And just like before, you’re going to have good and bad days. Also like before, we’re going to be by your side, helping you cope. You’re going to find your balance, but you will probably always experience symptoms here and there.”
”Dad, papa isn’t here! We don’t need to!” Peter exclaimed as Tony came out with the infamous thermometer. ”You know that’s a lie, Pete. If this turns into something worse, we need to be able to have some reference numbers, and I’m not about to pretend like you haven’t gotten worse since last night. Now, I know you like papa to do this but you’re stuck with just me. Sorry about that.”
The doctor wasn’t, but they agreed for him to stop by once he came back, to look at Peter and inform both parents of the updated situation.
”Yeah it’s just… I just suddenly remembered… Uhm... Yesterday. And oh god I think I’m gonna throw up. G’night!” Peter said, already on his way towards the stairs leading to the bedroom floor.
After whispering goodnight wishes, they went back outside. ”See, now he was too tired to remember being awkward with you guys, and it’ll be all better tomorrow. It’s your turn to relax about it, walking in on your parents is so usual it’s basically a milestone. Now go home and get some sleep, I’ll return the kid in one piece tomorrow. Promise.” Rhodey said to the pair, ushering them out the door. ”See you sunday!”
”Hey guys, I literally just turned the lights off. He’s probably not asleep yet.” Rhodey said, knowing the men were itching to tip-toe into him and see that all was well. ”You’re welcome to sit down for a while and wait, though, I’m not going to bed just yet.”
”Node is duffed, baba. Ca’dt breathe” Peter pouted. Steve smiled gently. ”I can hear so. Does that mean my timing is really bad as I ask you if you’d like a sandwich? Lunch isn’t for another while.” A sandwich did actually sound good, he hadn’t eaten much the past couple of days. ”I’ll try sobe. Where’s dad?”
When they were in the car, Ned texted them about the paparazzi in front of the school. It was less than 48 hours since he bad broken the news about his sexuality, so it was expected that day. Happy grumbled about the schools entrances for the millionth time. There were back and side entrances, but you’d have to walk past the front one to get to them, so there was no point in using another one for Peter to get by the vultures. This was the part he didn’t like about being famous, this uproar that happened every time something happened in their lives.
Once inside his parents’ bedroom, Peter went over to Steve’s side and crawled into the middle of the mattress. Sleepy mumbles started falling from his dad’s lips. ”You know, it hasn’t even been to days since I told you to stop taking my side. You’re a big fella, I get it. Get your own half of the bed. Oh, wait, you’ve got one already.”
Steve smirked. ”That’s not what you said last night, honey,” He said, sneaking his hands around Tony from behind, holding him in place while he was chopping vegetables and heating up the stove. ”That’s because Peter wasn’t just down the hall. Please, Steve. It hasn’t even been 48 hours since he walked in on us. Let’s have the food ready for when he gets back. He needs to be comfortable enough to talk.”
”Yeah, yeah. Just fine. We’re supposed to have morning briefing but we’re making good use of the weather and training all day. I’m looking at them now in the field, they’re all miserable.”
Peter was deadly wrong. The breakfast table in the kitchen was packed with food, a lot more extravagant than usual. Pancakes, eggs, the works. Both fathers noticed him as soon as he stood in the doorway, so there was no way he could just escape for school. ”Hi son, just in time for breakfast.”
Peter shrugged, only mumbling a ”Only when I stand” as he turned his head around, nuzzling into Tony’s hand that was resting on Peter’s shoulder. The doctor nodded, mostly to himself, getting up, sensing that Peter had declared the conversation over. Then he locked eyes with Tony and Steve. ”If you guys would give me twenty minutes to read up on his previous files, I’d appreciate that. Then it’d be nice if you could both come find me at the nurses station. I’ll fill you in on what I’m thinking. Okay?” The pair nodded in response. Tony glanced at the time to keep track, but his eyes were soon back to Peter, who was looking dead on his feet. ”I’ll see you later today, Peter”
Peter tries to convince everyone, including himself that he's better and also spends a day with a couple of uncles.
person in the world insisting on calling it a ball instead of prom. And something tells me he’s the most handsome man of all. Don’t know why, just a feeling, really,” Peter head snapped up.
Peter was sure he’d be traumatized forever. He was in his shower, needing something to do after that… That. It was weird, really. Steve and Tony had always been open about their sexuality and fact that a sexlife was a part of their relationship. There had been some kind of  sextalk part one happening a few months earlier, and that had been fine. So Peter had always thought he would handle walking in on them a bit more… Mature? Natural? Turns out he was just as much a child on the inside as Tony seemed to think at times. So now, Peter was hiding in the shower.
”We need to look presentable Pete, this is white house people we’re talking about. Charcoal three piece, you can use the armani one from this fall, white shirt, striped tie. Any colour.” Tony didn’t like giving those DC pricks anything to pick on them about, so he tried to avoid the grease stained shirts at those particular meetings.
They talked for a while about how to handle different issues after that, and the main result of the meeting was that things were a lot like before. The biggest difference was that he would be given more time on tests as he had an official diagnosis. They agreed the Peter could tell his classmates if and when he was comfortable with that.
The doors opened, and Sam shouted into the apartment to locate the small family. They could hear sounds from the kitchen. Bucky braced himself to catch the teenager welcoming him. But as they entered the kitchen, nothing happened. Peter was sat on a stool by the kitchen island, Steve standing on the opposite side. They were studying something on a tablet before looking up at the guests.
Tony had Friday open a line to wherever Steve was, which turned out to be the gym floor. ”Hey love, would you mind coming down here and help me with Pete? He’s asleep in the car here with me,” ”I’ll be there in two!” came the reply a second later, and Tony nodded to himself, tightening the arm around Peters torso a bit when he felt the boy slipping.
This concludes the first work in Steve, Tony and their heir! I basically started writing this because I needed an escape, a place to organize my daydreams. It was never my intention to share it with the world, but here I am. I hope you enjoy the first toe-dip into what is already a 60k ocean of domestic fluff!
Weekends would always be good in the Stark-Rogers residence, but they rarely had family visit before dinner time on sundays. The superhusbands (came from the media, but the avenger family had teasingly adopted the nickname many years back) used the weekends to catch up on what they couldn’t do the rest of the week, including spending quality time with their son. And when Peter wasn’t sandwiched between his fathers, he was spending time with his friends or doing school work. And while Bucky and Sam usually saw Peter a couple of times a week, they were always keen on getting in more. ”Peter, you’re coming out with us today. Contrary to popular belief in this tower, you can actually step outside while sick,” Bucky said, shooting a quick glare at an offended Steve.
”Yeah I’m starting high school in the fall. Yeah no, they declared it a snow day so I’m hanging around here today, inspecting the old man’s work. Haha, yeah you know how it is, Gary. No I haven’t seen that yet, actually. Dad, why didn’t we go to the car shop earlier?” Tony snapped out of whatever daydream he had at the sound of Peter’s name for him. ”Hm?”
All of a sudden, he felt Peter tense up out of nothing. ”Oh god oh god oh god,” He whispered, while Steve and Tony looked at eachother, trying to figure out what was wrong. ”What’s the matter, Pete?” Tony said, reaching for his hand. Peter was already on his way out of the room. ”I just… Can’t sit with you. Not right now.” Peter said, a bit rushed. ”Think I’ll go to bed… Really early. Yeah. I’m so tired.” He pretended to yawn.
”It seems like Steven Stark-Rogers has been part of a car accident on his way home from work. His vitals are all stable so as far as I can tell he is doing fine. I expect Tony Stark-Rogers to bring him to Stark tower as he has almost reached location with his iron suit.”
“I’m aware, Steve, you’re embarrassed to be with a bad man like me. You know how it is to be hard-working and a part of the majority of the world, you’re
Peter was pouting. There was no way around it at this point, but he had no regrets. This was horrible and unfair, and pout-worthy. He was being dragged around the mall by has dad, who was desperately trying to find the perfect christmas present for his husband. Peter didn’t understand why he had to join in on this, he’d wrapped his papa’s present a week earlier. It was lying in the back of his closet together with presents for the rest of his friends and family.
Tony shook his head with a little laugh, thinking Steve was too stubborn on the theme. Nonetheless he agreed. It was a more content Peter that went to bed that night, half an hour later than normal.
A few seconds passed. Peter wasn’t really expecting FRIDAY to answer his rethorical question, but it seemed like his dad had been in such a hurry getting out that he’d forgotten to tell friday what she could and couldn’t tell Peter. He wouldn’t have wanted her to answer that question.
and not having Fri in you car, I’m installing her tonight. I need her to be able to run diagnostics and give me information about you car. If I had that, I wouldn’t have panicked so much today, you know that.”
”Pete buddy, Tony, do we take the dessert to the living room?” Steve asked from the kitchen. Peter’s face lit up at this. Tony smiled at his son, getting up as the boy answered.
”Hey Peter, nice that you would like to join us.” Ms. Jane started. She had been his teacher for several years now, and they knew each other well. ”Your fathers have explained to us everything you went through during the break, so you don’t need to worry about us not knowing. We’ve just started discussing how we move forward. Now as you know, this isn’t a new thing for you or us to deal with, we’ve had our fair share of challenges over the years, haven’t we?”
”Well, Pete, it looks like you’re staying home today,” Tony said, shaking Peter a bit, who had fallen back to sleep on his father’s arm. ”Huh?”
It was Peter’s first day, he had started late and ended early so Steve had taken the day off for good measure. That’s why he was picking Peter up, and meeting Tony back home.
After Tony had literally helped Peter get into his warmer sweats in addition to his winter wear, the two were in the elevator towards the garage. Peter was leaning heavily into Tony’s side, who held his boy up by the armpits. ”Dad?”
”Wow, dad, can I try it? Like, just hold it in my hand for like, like, three seconds?” Peter pleaded, the lab worker had already started shaking her head at him until he received a glare from mr. Stark. ”Sure bud, but you’ll get first wave of testing sample either way, I don’t get how you’re so intrigued.”
Steve fell forward and rested his head on Tony’s chest. ”My god,” he spoke, voice muffled. ”Well, come on then, let’s shower quickly and do damage control before he leaves. I’m gonna call and tell them I’ll be late in the office today.” He patted Tony lightly before getting up and immediately calling someone. Oh god. Tony was definitely not in the mood anymore, but his dick hadn’t even softened entirely yet. It was that fresh. So Tony did the only thing he ever did in moments of doubt, he listened to Steve while pretending to disagree (Tony knew there wasn’t really anything to disagree on, but it was a habit).
”Okay. Yeah, I’ve got to say I think you should take him to the hospital if the fever goes over 103.8, or if it doesn’t go under 103 before.. Let’s say five. It might be just a cold virus hitting him hard, but it might be influenza. It sounds like he’ll need fluids from an IV line if he doesn’t drink on his own soon, as you know fluids and rest is really the only treatment. Maybe some antivirals.”
”So they didn’t listen to your proposal from last time? How rude of them. Oh well, I guess they give you everything they think can help you get better”
”Pete! No, Peter, not that office today. Pete? Peter, listen to me-” Peter was marching towards Steves closest office, the biggest one of the two he had. There was no way he was listening to papa at that point. Steve didn’t like that Peter always watched tv in his office, so he always wanted them to go to the smaller one. Peter thought he deserved tv that day, though.
As Peter then went to collect his coat (”and the scarf and hat and gloves too!” ”please stop papa”), the adults were left waiting. ”Are you sure you’re fine with having him while he’s under the weather?” Tony asked, looking out the door where his son had just left. ”Of course. Guys, really. We know the whole story about the immune thing, trust me, but you guys need to ease up. It’s not like we’re gonna do anything that’s making him sick, we’re barely going to be outside,” Sam said. ”Well, it’s sure gonna be a great help for us. We can finally wrap Pete’s presents without worrying. Thanks,” Steve replied,
”Glad to hear you’re okay, Stevie.” Bucky said, getting lost in the video that was still playing on the tablet, but not before giving Peter an affectionate hair ruffle. ”Hey, bud.”
”Dad, I don’t feel well… Can you stay home today?” Tony tightened his arms around Peter and kissed the top of his head.  ”I was planning on anyway, but why don’t the two of us do a real lazy day, huh? We’re gonna have to move eventually but I say that right now, we postpone breakfast until we feel like it.” After they agreed on what Tony suggested, dad did however get up. Peter let out an offended sound at the loss of his father’s warmth, he was still freezing.
There was no loud moaning, shouting of each others names or the bed banging into the wall. That was one downside of Peter, the notorious light sleeper, being right across the hallway. But Steve and Tony made do with what they could, and god how Tony had missed this. Going without sex over long times happened once in a while, they didn’t jump at it any chance they got after living together for fourteen years. It was still a healthy sexlife, though, if one were to ask Tony. Which no one did, but he still took pride in. He was starting to grow older, after all.
Peter shrugged, shirt, pants, shoes and vest on in a few minutes and went into his fathers bedroom with the jacket and tie. Once entered, Tony looked him up and down for a few seconds. ”Handsome boy. Do you need cuffliks?”
As soon as they touched down, Peter tugged himself out of Happy’s loosening grip around his shoulders and ran up to the pair. ”Pops, I thought you were dead!”
The last part stung Steve, so much so that he felt himself take a step back. With that, Tony opened the elevator still on their floor.

”That’s actually why I’m calling, I’m gonna keep him here tonight if that’s alright with you. We talked a bit earlier, and I think everything’s going to be fine, Steve. He just needs a bit of space to forget, and you guys can put it behind you. There’s not really anything to talk about when you think of it. It it alright that he stays?”
”There you go. Hold on a sec, Pete, just sit here for a minute, take a break. Steve, you getting the fuzzy socks?” As they pulled on a sock each, Peter grabbed hold of their shoulders, scooching forward to get out of bed. Steve took hold of him as Tony went to find new clothes, all of them meeting in the bathroom where Peter was sitting on the toilet. ”We’ll give you a couple of minutes, Pete. Let us know when you’re done, if you need help with anything.” Steve soothed, closing the door behind them. They were lucky to have gotten a single room. There weren’t a lot of patients in at the moment, so both the staff and the physical environment was calm and quiet.
”That’s what I’m calling you about. He’s still not back and not answering his phone either. I’m getting worried, dad.”
As expected, Tony found his husband with an armful of Peter. They weren’t talking, nor crying. The salad was finished, and the timer for the food told them two minutes was remaining. They were just standing there, finding comfort in each other. ”Hey, I want in on this too!” Tony exclaimed, and Steve smiled back. They extended their arms to wrap around eachother, so Peter was squished in the middle. He squirmed for a bit, and managed to turn around so his head now rested on Tony’s shoulder.
“Guys, I think I’m going home now. I have a lot of paperwork that has to be in by tonight, so I better get started. Pete, if you need anything, just text me. I’ll stop by the tower on my way here tomorrow.”
”You can stop pretending to be asleep now, we’re not mad at eachother.” Peter heard about two seconds before the blankets were ripped off his body. Tony was at one side, making Peter get up and help make the bed.
Rhodey had just shut the door to the guest room where Peter was already half asleep when there was a knock on his door.
”Hey bud, I thought you were supposed to be sleeping by now?” Tony said, keeping his voice to a whisper. Peter was at the verge of falling asleep before they entered. Steve sat at the edge of the bed while Tony crouched down beside the head. Peter didn’t answer, just nuzzled his head into the hand carding fingers through his hair. He visibly relaxed at this, even more so when Steve started stroking his back. ”Go to sleep kid, we were just dropping off your clothes for tomorrow. Uncle Jim will take you to school and we’ll pick you up.”
“No,” Tony said. “Unlikely. Thanos left Earth last. We—someone I knew had the mind stone. I don’t think he’s alive… I haven’t really thought about the rest. You heard the radio calls. You know what’s going on out there.”
Steve allows him only a few seconds to recuperate, long enough to take the edge off before he swallows around Tony’s cock again, taking him deeper. Tony whimpers at the way his erection grazes the back of Steve's throat; he catches Steve staring and struggles to look away, hypnotised by the way Steve’s eyes roll back as he hums around the solid length. Moments later, Steve guides Tony’s hands to the back of his head, a silent plea written across his face.
“Ah shit,” Tony said. “Power failure? It should come back online soon… there must be a backup gener—”
to the best one yet, and it’s not just because he’s getting it from Captain America. Steve uses his lips, tongue, and hands to keep Tony teetering on the edge but denies him the push he needs to topple over. Tony bites down on his already chapped lips in frustration; he’s reduced to a frenzied, panting mess from the effortless way Steve knows exactly which of his buttons to press, until he sneaks a finger under Tony and presses against his perineum. For a second, Tony fears the arc reactor in his chest is dead and he’s having a heart attack until his muscles convulse, inundated with pleasure.
The screen booted up once Tony tapped the helmet near the temple. He sat on the floor in the flight deck. Nebula had been tinkering with the dead reactor core for the past two hours without much success.
Tony shook his head. The bowl of orange liquid next to him was left untouched. “Not really. It was a long shot—I tried to send a message back to Earth, but I don’t think it worked.”
“How did we lose so badly? We were the Avengers. Once. We should’ve stopped him. We should’ve done better. We let Thanos win and, now, there’s nothing left to avenge. Tell me I’m wrong.”
Steve’s lips curl into a frown as he over his shoulders. “As much as I enjoyed our little pretence, I think you're overplaying your hand here, Tony. I gave you a blowjob because you asked for one, let's not drag this out and make it awkward.” Tony shakes his head and hurries forward, reaching for Steve’s hand on the door handle.
!” Tony shouts as pleasure shoots up his spine, setting his nerves on fire. It threatens to overwhelm him. If anyone had been passing by the gym, Tony's sure they'd have heard him, and, frankly, he's beyond caring—Steve's mouth feels like a delicious vice around his cock, and Tony wants to lose himself in there forever.
“There’s nowhere to go.” Nebula’s voice cracked. Tony gripped her shoulder, gentle, reassuring. She leaned into the touch. Beneath the mechanical stoicism lived the real Nebula, hiding from years of punishment that Thanos had meted out for her shortcomings. Tony saw her surface only a handful of times—once, while in the throes of his nightmares, he heard a whispered lullaby in his ear, sang in a tongue he didn’t understand, by a voice softer than Nebula’s. It had soothed him back to sleep and she avoided his gaze when he woke. In another moment, he had watched her examine the damaged helmet—all that was left of his suit—with a childlike curiosity.
Tony thinks. Last month's scandal with the oil heiress had been a necessary distraction from the company's bad performance, and Tony was happy to take one for the team. But this? This—
The Benatar moved in silence through an unending sea of black, following the coordinates trembling fingers had keyed in after a turbulent takeoff on Titan, carrying with it a thin fragment of hope — an unwavering faith that their destination, a small backwater planet on the western spiral arm of the galaxy, still stood in its axis.
Steve stares at him, his gaze fixed and unmoving until it borders on uncomfortable, until it forces Tony to look away and mumble, “It—oh fuck. I misread this, didn't I? I'm sorry, I—”
sounds erotic, the way Steve's voice starts off low, then crests several octaves higher, followed by a quick, slapping touch of skin on leather, and the whole thing repeats in sync. Again, and again and again. Tony pauses in his steps and swallows.
Tony enjoyed the darkness behind his eyes. The lack of oxygen quietened his mind for once, leaving it blank, and listless. It felt peaceful. He heard Nebula’s movements—she slipped into the pilot seat, trying to work out the buttons that would open a line to whoever had come for them. For a brief second, Tony considered the possibility of their would-be rescuers being hostile, bloodthirsty aliens—the kind he used to enjoy rattling off by name every time he made Steve sit down to watch his list of favourite science fiction films. The Rathtars were a particularly nasty breed…
Tony puffed his chest out, forcing the limited oxygen inside the suit down his windpipe. They were down to the last pair of suits, which would buy him another 24 hours of breathable air, then it would be the end. He’d die two years short of 50. Whatever gamble Strange took by trading the time stone for his life would’ve come to naught—half the universe would stay dead and Peter would never grow up to vote or legally buy booze. For months on board the Benatar, Tony survived knowing he needed to fix what Thanos broke; if not for anyone else, he needed to do it for Peter. He owed the kid that much. But sitting at the jaws of death, Tony felt helpless. All he had left was to trust the man with a plan to come through, for Steve Rogers to save the universe.
“It’s melted,” Nebula said, raising her voice over a new set of alarms that beeped from the machines connected to the reactor. “We’re out of power.”
Tony turned off the radio. He left the flight deck and pulled up a chair in the galley, opposite Nebula. A bowl of grey, translucent soup sat in front of him. It smelled like chowder-gone-bad, but the hunger pangs clawing at his stomach walls won out. Tony slurped and emptied the bowl in a handful of big gulps, retching at the pungent aftertaste flooding his mouth as he tasted the bile rising at the back of his throat. “I feel like you’re feeding me sewage water and calling it gourmet,” he said, wiping his tongue on his black tank top.
“Hey Tony, what's going on?” Steve says, as if oblivious to the way Tony stands rooted at the doorway, speechless and several shades crimson. “How're things on the other side?” Steve walks over until they stand only a few feet apart and Tony hears the subtle breathlessness in the Captain’s voice.
Tony sat in the middle of the room, cross-legged, setting the helmet down in front of him. He reached near the temple, pushed a button and a holographic screen flickered to life—much like the one Nebula had. Tapping the metallic forehead, he said, “Is this thing on?” Printed letters appeared, hovering mid-air. They read:
A thunderous noise shook the entire structure of the spacecraft, setting off a dozen alarms in the cockpit. Nebula rushed to the elevator, Tony hot on her heels. The cargo hold was filled with smoke, the acrid smell of burnt metal and melted plastic choking the air supply to Tony’s lungs and burning his eyes. He bunched up his tank top and pressed the fabric over his nose, covering his mouth as he followed Nebula towards the reactor core in the other room.
Nebula looked down at her hands. Tony remained wary of the slender, metallic fingers. Images of cold, unfeeling metal on pale, warm skin flashed across the periphery of his vision, leaving him reeling, and raw. He cast a quick glance at the hand in question. It was damaged from the fight—the articulated joints were banged up, he could tell, from the way Nebula struggled with her grip. The knowledge helped Tony sleep better.
need to fight back. The world needs the Avengers, and the Avengers need Cap, you. I just… I wish I was there to see you win. But maybe this is for the best. I would’ve only gotten in your way.”
By the time Tony enters the gym, Steve's stopped taking out his frustrations over the Dodgers’ defeat on the punching bag — he stands next to the bag, shirtless and sweating, wearing only a pair of grey slacks that leaves very few things to Tony’s imagination.
He pulled his knees close to his chest, resting his chin in between. The screen stood static—for a second, Tony grappled with recognising the reflected image. His hair had grown with time, and he trusted Nebula with a pair of scissors—he didn’t flinch when metal fingers gripped the base and snipped away at excess hair grazing his shoulders. It was not the best look on him, nowhere close to the fashionable trims from his personal stylist, but it sufficed; he thanked her for the effort. The small, amused smile on her lips had made the asymmetrical cut worth it. Dark circles under his eyes showed more prominently on skin white as a sheet; the corners of his lips turned purple, like the tips of his fingers and toes, and his beard had grown down the column of his neck. The dips around his clavicles appeared more pronounced under the black tank top, and Quill’s shirts hung off his frame like loose, shapeless dresses.
Nebula looked amused, her lips curling upwards. Before she could utter a word, the lights went out, leaving them seated in the dark.
The question gave Tony pause as he fought off the lethargy settling between his joints to wrap his head around it. Did he love Steve Rogers?
Tony sighed. On some levels, commandeering Quill’s ship, eating his food, wearing his clothes, felt wrong, disrespectful, even. But he had been at the end of his rope on Titan, with a high-tech band-aid slapped on a vicious stab wound, and the ashes of a seventeen-year-old kid still stuck under his fingernails. Tony had scrubbed his hands on board the ship until the skin split open, red rivulets trickling into the wash basin. Nebula had bandaged his hands without a word. The enormity of their defeat was
The clothes were three sizes too big on Tony. The red tunic slid off his shoulders, revealing collarbones. Nebula observed him with glazed curiosity, watched his every move inside the spacecraft until one day, after almost two weeks onboard, she said, “You’re not like him. You’re different.”
Tony closes his eyes, wills himself to sink through the floor in shame. All his apprehensions — thoughts and misgivings he had quelled on the way to New York — bubble to the surface; they make him feel dirty and nauseated.
“Steve, if you’re still out there, you must re-assemble the team. You can’t give up. Thanos can’t win. You
“Is that what you're gonna do Tony?” Steve drawls. Tony belatedly recognises the hard edge in his voice as jealousy. “Gonna suck his cock once I teach you how to? Don't worry—” Steve's hand slides down to Tony’s groin; skilled fingers rub along his half-hard length through his pants, pulling needy, desperate moans from the back of his throat. Steve lowers his voice into a whisper: “I'll teach you
Tony laughed, mirthless, the sounds echoing off cold, empty walls. Secondary stats displayed on the screen—from the suit’s interface—showed temperature hovered in the low 40s, turning the tips of his fingers and toes blue. Oxygen saturation dropped to 82 percent, his chest tightening as his body put up a valiant fight to pump more breathable air into his lungs.
Once he is inside the lift, Tony shuffles his weight from toe to toe, clasps and unclasps his hands into fists, and bites into the dry cracks on his lower lips, tasting the metallic tang of blood.
, the number of times I've fantasised about getting railed by Captain America? A stupidly large number—the point is, I have given this a fair amount of thought, and I want to explore this side of me, this attraction I feel for you, and maybe, I'm overstepping here but that little demonstration earlier? It makes me think you might feel something for me too. And I thought maybe it'll be nice to explore this...
Tony loses the train of thought because Steve chooses that moment to wrap his lips around Tony's cock, making him reel from the soft, wet press of Steve's tongue against the tip. Steve steadies Tony with a solid grip on his waist, and before Tony realises what’s happening, Steve takes him deeper into his mouth and swallows around the stiff length. “Steve,
Tony does his best to tamper down the sudden spike in his heart rate, the way the sharp perfume tickles at the back of his throat. He can taste the lilies in his mouth, the rust of his own blood.
What had Arna done to him, in those last few moments? The memories seem so muddled, for some reason. She’d grabbed him, wrapped her vines tight around the armor, crushing down on him--
It still feels utterly surreal in a way he can’t properly explain. He grips at Steve’s shirt beneath his hands, as though if he lets go, everything will go right back to the way it was. He doesn’t want to let go-- and by how tightly Steve is holding onto him, he imagines he isn’t the only one feeling that way.
“I understand that I am limited in my emotional capabilities, due to the... nature, of my existence. However, I would like to express that it has been a pleasure working with you all of these years, Sir. I know that you have prepared me for this loss, but I am doubtful that I will not miss you in some capacity.”
He hadn’t even realized he’d closed his eyes until they’re fluttering open, head in a daze as he takes in the scene around him. He’s curled in on himself, both hands over the arc reactor as if to guard it. His desk chair is knocked over a few feet away, the hardware he was working on strewn about the ground. He must have fallen, then-- and taken more than a few things with him.
“I should inform you as well,” the AI continues after a brief moment, “that Captain Rogers has just arrived in the elevator. He is asking permission for entry, Sir.”
Just raising his voice is enough to leave him winded, but he’s not going to back down now. He doesn’t know what Strange told Steve, so if he can keep him at arm’s length, maybe he can make it out of this.
“If we do, I’m sure Steve will find them,” Tony says, aiming for playful but falling painfully flat. “...He’s too stubborn to do anything else.”
The lift doors open with a ding and he barely dodges an arrow that sticks to the carriage's metal wall behind him. Tony scowls when Clint shuffles into view; the archer flashes an apologetic smile for almost impaling Tony with one of his trick arrows.
“I need your help,” he says and deflates, shoulders hunching until a pair of firm hands grip the bony blades and Tony's forced to look into a pair of brilliant blue eyes.
A week later, the oxygen ran out. Nebula forced Tony into one of the holographic spacesuits, holding him through a panic attack as his lungs scrambled for air and as the material sheathed itself around him—skintight and frigid. She held his head on her lap, his weakened, dehydrated body splayed on the floor, covered by three layers of blankets that did little to stop the shivering.
“I’m sorry. I am so sorry,” Tony said in a whisper when the video stopped and the holographic projection switched off, leaving them in semi-darkness.
“Steve,” Tony shouts and comes hard in the other man’s mouth, shuddering from the sheer force of his orgasm, his lungs heaving for air. Steve works Tony through the aftershocks, licking him clean until he pushes Steve away from his wet, oversensitive cock.
“Record. Message 011. It’s me again. I’m still here and that surprises me as much as it would surprise you. We’re still stranded. All of our efforts to repair the core were futile. I can’t fix the damage and there’s not a planet in sight. Food’s run out, we’re down to the last tank of water, and O2 sat level is at 61 percent. It’s getting harder to breathe, and I think the stab wound is infected. Right now, there’s a pretty exciting race going on, on what’s going to kill me: I’m betting on dehydration.”
The gesture knocks the wind out of Tony's chest. Steve presses against his back, a solid, immovable mass of muscle and grit. Tony shudders at the other man’s warm breath in his ear as he speaks in a stern, baritone voice that
It earns him an amused grin as Steve looks down. Tony follows his gaze and blushes at the dark, wet patch on Steve's slacks. “Oh,” Tony says. It's
Some days, tucked in his berth under a blanket that smelled like wet animal fur, Tony thought about the Avengers—or what was left of them. The process of elimination told him that Vision was, in all likelihood, dead. Thanos cared little about collateral damage; he wouldn’t have hesitated to rip the mind stone from where it sat on Vision’s forehead. Tony sighed; pangs of regret punching at the base of his spine. He shouldn’t have pushed Vision away, even when he couldn’t look him in the eyes and not hear the whoosh of metal in freefall, crashing back to the green, muddy Earth with a thud that made him tremble at his core. Bruce, after missing for years, showed up through a portal and said Thor was dead. The Asgardian had always been a mystery that Tony tried, over and over again, to solve. His very presence had challenged Tony, a man of science, to reconcile the scientific with the myth. He regretted Thor’s demise. Rhodey had been in therapy and Pepper on her way to a board meeting at the exact moment Tony left Earth. Steve lived in Tony’s memories—a jumble of violent, distorted moving images that left him struggling to tell apart what was real, and what was not.
, even if he wants to. Not that it's even a consideration, not when Steve's mouth feels warm, inviting and mind-numbingly good. Tony tightens his grip on the Captain’s head and pushes his hips forward, thrusts once, twice, and when Steve whines around his cock, he lets himself go. Tony fucks Steve's mouth slow and steady, pulling all the way out before slamming to the back of his throat. As he creeps closer to the edge, Tony’s momentum falters; his thrusts become more erratic until— “Steve, I can't, I'm close,” he warns as Steve caresses Tony’s thighs to encourage him along, instead of pulling away.
Tony regretted asking as soon as the first scream pierced the ship’s silence. A scene played out of Thanos taking Nebula apart, piece by piece, with a manic glint in his eyes. When Thanos pushed something that resembled industrial tongs—his mind flashed to a collection of those hanging on the walls in his workshop—into Nebula’s mouth and pulled a portion of her tongue out, Tony's tolerance peaked. Blue liquid gushed over purple hands, her screams reduced to pained whimpers. He closed his eyes, stooped lower in his seat—everything about the scene sounded familiar. Intimately, so. Images of a dark cave smelling of gunpowder and the insides of a lavatory flickered in his mind; he remembered the cold gnawing at his skin, rough and parched, covered in bruises. His water-filled lungs had felt like lead pressing down on his spine whenever he lay down while the wound, the gaping hole at the centre of his chest, raw and smelling of cheap, store-bought disinfectant, screamed in protest. He shuddered at the memory.
of them, and clasped them between his own. The metal felt warmer than he had expected, unlike the thick, cold, and unfeeling fingers recurrent in nightmares about an abandoned bunker hidden in a sea of white. “Come on, get some rest.”
There was a group of heroes, the Avengers, he said in a low, indistinct voice. They’d know what to do. When Nebula left to the galley, Tony stared at the infinite enormity of space, remembering the vision foretelling his legacy, the end of the path that started the first day he had put on the armour. For all he knew, the Avengers died, slaughtered like lambs, while fate’s cruel blade left him alive as punishment. He had meant to take the fight away from Earth, spent six years preparing for the day of reckoning, but in the end, the plan exploded into a catastrophic failure against Thanos’ unflinching resolve. The Avengers paid the price and he didn’t — just like the dire prophecy had predicted. He shuddered at the thought.
“We’ll figure something out,” Tony said, kneeling in front of her. Inhaling deeply, he reached for her hands,
They almost hadn't made it out of Titan. The planet’s off-kilter gravity had nearly grounded the spacecraft for good. Thanos had won through his sheer willpower and wiped out half of all sentient life in the universe—how does one come back in the face of such overwhelming, consuming defeat? The answer had dodged Tony and Nebula’s minds as they watched the distance grow between the decaying planet and the ship. Loss and devastation sank in their guts, the guilt felt like ankle weights, dragging them underwater, and in a fleeting moment of clarity, Tony had suggested they travel to Earth.
they are not Yinsen’s hands, they are not ripping at his sternum and digging for shrapnel, he can’t smell the dirt and gunpowder and
“We found our source, if you gentlemen would like to contribute,” Natasha speaks up alongside him, sarcasm lacing her voice. Tony’s really starting to wonder when she started taking pages out of Steve’s books, if she’s being this serious.
Bruce, but they didn’t have much of a chance to object before he and Strange were gone. Thus, armchair. Tea. A growing sense of dread in the pit of his stomach.
“Your parameters have been quite clear, Sir. I will do everything within my power to care for, protect, and guide the Avengers in your absence. Even if they do not choose to remain within the tower, they will have a home here, waiting.” Then, softer. “...I will be waiting. I will not let them, or you, down.”
Tony chokes out, his voice far weaker than he intends. He wants to be angry, absolute. All he has left is
“Iron Man, you’ve got to back him up!” Steve says, breathing raggedly. “Widow and I can defend ourselves, but we’re not going to last long. Our first priority
“Fancy meeting you here,” he wheezes softly. The pain in his chest has dulled to an ache, the vines settling into place once more. He’s fairly sure he can feel flower petals tickling at the back of his throat, but he does his best to swallow them down.
“Tony…” Steve says his name so quietly, so grief-stricken, and it’s all that Tony can do not to break down right then and there. If anything, it only serves to make him
“I hope he is worth dying for,” she murmurs, before the heat seems to pierce directly through his chest, into his heart. The pain sparks against every nerve, grating against his ribcage; as though there are
She watches him with clear eyes, studying him in a way that makes his skin itch. At this point, it doesn’t matter if Natasha sees his pain or not-- she just saw him collapse, after all. But he has a feeling that’s not why she’s looking at him like that.
She drops him. His vision goes black as he falls, the screams of his teammates nothing but whispers in his ears.
“I went to see him because I already went to everyone else, Tony,” he says, his gaze guiltily flicking down to his hands for a moment, not able to meet his gaze. “...Natasha brought some concerns to me, and I thought I should--”
“Yellow roses are meant to represent a deep bond of friendship,” Jarvis tells him, voice somber, “the dark red is interpreted to mean romantic love, but most often represent a deep grief. The nightshade…” he’s never known the AI to hesitate, but he knows he can’t be taking
“Hey, takes one to know one, I guess--” Strange presses a hand to his chest, the circular Tao Mandala sparking to life against his skin. Tony cuts himself off with a hiss of pain, feeling the object in his chest shudder and shrink back from Strange’s magic.
He can’t fly anymore. The strain that it puts on the ensnared arc reactor is too much to keep him alive
that sounds so much worse. Let’s not do that, at all, ever.” Tony grimaces at the suggestion. “...Right, okay-- I’ll save the panicking for later, I guess. Staying positive, and all that. I’ll be fine.”
“You know what? You’re right, I’m definitely not listening anymore,” he bites back, trying to stumble to his feet on his own. He grips the edge of the desk for support as he blinks back the black spots that dance across his vision. “I had no idea what the fuck I was doing then, and I sure as shit have no idea
I could adapt, sure, but I didn’t want to. Some days, I thought it would be better if they just put me right back in the ice.” It’s clear that it hurts him to say aloud, but he presses on. “But then there was you. You’re everything the future is, but
“Couldn’t agree more, buddy,” Tony replies as he flies overhead. Hulk seems to be doing well enough on his own, acting as a blockade to keep the vined creatures from spreading even further into the city. Regardless, he still drops down to obliterate a few that have skittered too far away with well aimed repulsor blasts. With a quick salute to Hulk, he takes off into the air again.
“Why do none of you believe I’m capable of staying in one place?” Tony huffs as soon as Bruce is out of the room and, thus, out of earshot.
“You’re getting worse,” Natasha comments, ignoring his weak joke entirely. She removes her hand from his shoulder, though she looks as though she’d still like to check him over for injuries. His tailbone feels particular bruised, but aside from that and the garden growing in his lungs, he seems no more worse for wear.
“If you’re there for your own safety, you’re not,” Steve says, sitting his sketchbook on the side table before looking to Tony again. There’s a fond warmth in his tilted smile, and it makes something stir in his chest. ...Not metaphorically, either-- the weight against his chest only seems to get
the one that said true love’s kiss, Stark. I can’t be held responsible for the ideas you put in my head.”
“It’s a simple yes or no question.” It’s more a statement than meant for cruelty. He waits patiently.
“What’s with all of you and asking permission?” he sighs, trying to sound annoyed but falling closer to resigned. “Let him in.”
It’s hard to tell, initially-- the flowers he’s coughing up now are spindly, awful things, ones that catch in his throat and tear at his cheeks. They taste like copper and rot, and it takes too long for Tony to realize they’re coated in his own blood.
“Then it will spread,” he replies grimly, “it’s a parasitic plant, Tony. It will feed on you, and it will kill you, in the end.
Pretty fucking ironic, isn’t it?” He collapses on the edge on the couch again, head in his hands as he tries to catch his breath. Nothing but silence follows.
“...Did you tell them, then?” Steve asks quietly from somewhere beside him, sounding just as wrecked as Tony
at her as she stands beside him, utterly silent as she moves, a gentle hand placed against his arm. He fights back every urge to shake her off.
Of course he wasn’t going to wait around. Tony shouldn’t have expected any less. “I told him Strange would figure it out. Why did he go to the old man?”
“Well, now you know,” he chokes out a miserable laugh, the movement causing ripples of pain along his sternum. He drops the petals to the floor without any regard. “Of all the shit that could’ve killed me, it’s gonna be
whenever someone mentions Thor around Bruce-- a warmth that shows so easily on his face. Tony can’t help but feel happy for him; he deserves something kinder, after everything he’s been through.
“Thank you, Sir.” It’s simple and precise, as Jarvis always is. If Tony strains hard enough, he can almost hear the bittersweet undercurrent beneath his words. He pretends it can’t be real, instead.
creations, not just plants,” he explains, turning to Tony once more as he ceases pacing. “Humanity falls under that category. Given her affinity for botany, it seems she simply... mixed the two. The object lodged in your chest is a
“I’m more of a coffee guy,” he quips, though the usual fire behind it is missing. In the blink of an eye, the teacup morphs into a cup of black coffee. The aroma is more than tempting, but he still doesn’t drink from it.
“Are you in love, Tony?” is the next question out of Strange’s mouth, to which Tony freezes entirely. He can’t help it-- he thinks of soft sunlight through blonde strands of hair, bright blue eyes and laughter that warms him to his very core. He thinks of gentle hands-- an
He glances around the room, taking in the familiar sight of the medbay. Everything is bathed in the afternoon light that streams through the windows, casting everything in a warm glow. It’s a nice comfort, considering how much he
“I resent that,” he responds, but doesn’t deny it either. “Thanks, Bruce. Cap’ll stay on sentry duty.”
Hulk, start pushing towards us, if you can. Hawkeye, keep your eyes on him, and start burning on my signal. Iron Man, you’re with Widow and I. You’re the only one who can get close enough to her at the moment.” They all voice their understanding as he exhales sharply. “God, we could really use Thor right about now.”
It’s a miracle that Tony can actually hear Natasha enter the workshop, her bare feet softly padding against the concrete. Considering her skills, she’s not heard unless she wants to be. He knows it’s more for his own benefit than anything, but he still appreciates it-- it’s a testament to the relationship they’ve built over these past few years, even if they generally refuse to acknowledge it.
“During the war, sure,” Steve replies, “didn’t have much time for sightseeing, though. Just got a glance at it. I don’t really think we have the kind of vacation time for that, though.”
You have an entire wall on your floor dedicated to fan letters and art that you’ve received, and you answer every single one by
The half-truths taste like bile in his throat, as sickly sweet as the flowers in his lungs. He can’t even
“If I ever have to see another flower in my life,” Natasha complains through gritted teeth, “it will
“Aren’t I always?” Tony flirts easily, laughing at the half-choked noise of surprise Steve makes over the line. Tony shouldn’t be distracting him during battle, but-- he’s a gifted multitasker. He’ll be fine.
Steve asks, incredulous. “Tony, for as someone as brilliant as you are, you can be incredibly idiotic sometimes.”
“Alright, thanks, I get it,” he says, gritting his teeth and the sudden wave of nausea that rolls over him, “I was an important asset to SHIELD and they needed me alive,
“What happened, after I blacked out?” he finds himself asking, his voice distant. He can’t start panicking yet. If she’d done something to
“I thought you were a self-righteous prick when we first met,” are the first words out of his mouth, which is-- not what he wanted. At all. Steve’s snort of amusement tells him that he's being very hypocritical, considering he just chided Steve for doing the same exact thing. “You just got under my skin so
Tony’s heart gives a very painful lurch in his chest, though it has nothing to do with the parasitic flowers that have taken up refuge there. “What’s got him on edge today? It’s not like we’ve learned anything new.”
“If you’re done,” Tony keeps his voice steady, but his hands tremble with the weight of it all, “I have work to do, Natasha.”
The surge is enough to nearly drop him from the sky entirely, but it hits its mark-- the beam cuts clean through the roots, sparking flames in its wake as it carves a fissure into the vines closest to Arna. Her screams pierce the air, joined in a chorus by the beasts that burn and crumble to ash. Tony can hear the others drawing closer, the familiar buzz of electricity under his skin, the roar of the Hulk louder and louder still.
“Keep your boyfriend company, I've got a few beautiful individuals that need my help!” Tony yells back, taking off once more to the heart of the battle. “Jarvis, on my mark, full power to chest repulsor. In the meantime, let’s get the grand finale started.” The remaining missiles in the suit deploy, clearing large swathes of the beasts with deafening explosions.
The first thing he hears is the quiet beep of a heart monitor, keeping in time with his pulse. It’s offset by the steady drip of the IV in his arm. He’s been in the medbay enough times to know the feeling of the slightly scratchy blanket resting over him.
Either way, he still feels exposed; his impending death is a live wire, as obvious as the glow of the arc reactor in his chest. He was an idiot, he realizes, to ever think he could hide it from the others. But he'll be damned if he doesn't take the cure to his grave.
You were reckless, and you were hurting, but you were still fighting to find something that worked. Even when Fury and I confronted you together--”
Pepper before trying to make her CEO immediately, but. He’s really trying to stay tame this time, really.
“I’m not trying to poison you, you know,” Stephen comments as he pulls floating books from the shelves with a simple wave of his hand. “You could at least
every time he’s around him. He pretends that he isn’t dying just because he had the audacity to fall in love with one of his best friends.
“If I don’t, he’ll be halfway down to the workshop before we can blink,” Steve replies, giving Tony a very pointed side eye.
“She dropped you,” Steve answers, a coldness to his voice that Tony’s only heard very, very rarely. “Thor managed to catch you before you could hit the ground. We planned to take her into custody, but the fire… it had spread pretty far already. She wouldn’t let us anywhere near her, so she, ah… she burnt up, with everything else.” He does manage to look regretful at that, regardless of how angry he’d been. Steve was never fond of unnecessarily taking lives.
Tony replies sardonically, “So what did Strange tell you, then? What was my big, bad secret, huh? What has you so
He coughs up the flower petals once they’ve returned home, sitting in the workshop alone after Steve has gone to bed. One moment he’s fine, the next, he’s doubled over on the ground with a hand against his mouth, trying not to dry heave. His mouth tastes like perfume and wax, the flower petals sticking to the palm of his hand. He stares down at the bright yellows and blues as the nausea passes, only numbly aware that those came
“Tony?” Steve’s standing and stepping to his bedside, clearly worried. He sits beside him on the edge of the bed. “Your pulse is really starting to kick up. Are you okay?”
until he started thinking about this extensively. He can hear the steady beeps of the monitor begin to pick up in speed.
Something violent curls up in his stomach at seeing either of them hurt, but Tony knows, without a doubt, that he can get both of them out of here. He drops down to rip through the creatures, snatching up the shield and flinging it back to Steve. It may not be as elegant as the Captain’s tosses are, but-- Steve still catches it, and that has to count for something.
“...You said that we had hope,” he clenches his jaw, plowing forward, “what does that mean? What can I do, if you can’t help me?”
Tony obliges to the request, if only to remember how to breathe properly as the spindly limbs squeeze at his lungs. He grits his teeth as the pain worsens, barely managing to inhale as his chest spasms.
“May I say something, Sir?” the AI asks, snapping Tony’s attention away from his work in an instant. He frowns slightly, tossing his tablet off to the side before sitting back against the cushions.
“Voodoo and magic are two different classifications,” he replies breezily. He steps out of the rows of bookshelves, flipping through the pages of the book in his hands. “Ah, I think I may have found something.”
It feels like the floor’s been dropped out from underneath him, his head in a daze as the words settle over him.
for a solution that won’t be found. He wants to tell all of them that it’s best just to accept what’s coming, and that they should make the most of the time they have left.
“It will, this time,” Stephen says to the empty room. “It will, and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself.”
let’s stop while we’re ahead here,” Tony grinds out, “No, it’s not Rhodey. I gave him advice to help get him with
“So I’ve been thinking,” he begins, fiddling with the gutted attachments, “I know you said you don’t like to be weighed down by unnecessary tech, which-- I get it, I do, every time I look at Rhodey’s suit I break out in hives, my shoulder hurts just thinking about it-- but I had a few upgrade ideas in the case that you
“Tony,” Natasha repeats his name, pulling his attention to her. She’s knelt beside him, one hand still resting on his shoulder. Her touch is comforting without being overwhelming, keeping him grounded without caging him in. She’s concerned for him-- it’s clear in the furrow of her eyebrows, the slight downturn to her mouth. Natasha doesn’t wear her emotions on her sleeve by any means, but Tony knows that look well enough by now. If he has
“Sorry. Old habits, I guess.” It’s a shitty excuse and he knows it, but he tosses it out anyway. “So what’ve you been up to?” He tries for the subtle approach, instead of outright saying
“I don’t think you get to be picky when you’re flinging yourself off buildings,” Tony retorts, eyes flitting across the skyline to find Clint another perch.
how long you have left? If you weren’t clear with-- with him, or if you didn’t tell him outright…” a grimace flickers across his features, “Unless he’s in a relationship already. Oh god, is it Rhodey--?”
“I don’t know what to do,” Tony said, sinking into his seat. “I’ve been preparing for this for years, but Thanos… he wiped us out with a snap. It was child’s play for him.”
“Tell me about Steve,” Nebula said, her grip on his bony wrists reassuring him that he was not alone, that he would not die by himself lost in space. “You recorded those messages for him. Who is he?”
Tony pushes Steve off his cock and glances down. The other man is a sinful sight — his hair's a mess, his face, hot and red, his pupils blown wide with arousal, his lips swollen and chin dripping with saliva. “What's wrong?” Steve says in a husky tone as Tony digs his nails into his palms to stop himself from coming. “Too close,” Tony whispers, resting his head against the wall with his eyes closed.
