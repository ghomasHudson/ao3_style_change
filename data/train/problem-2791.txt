School that day seemed to drag on for the trio. They were finally in advanced drama. They were supposed to be rehearsing a group project, but Dean had other plans. He remembered the lightsaber battle the three were having his first day and walked backstage. He grabbed four lightsabers and handed them out. "Boys vs girls?" Meg asked. Cas looked at Dean then back to Meg. "Oh we are gonna own you." With that, the battle was on. Dean and Cas stood side by side, lightsabers at the ready. Cas flicked his eyes to Dean, then to Meg. Dean smiled. As soon as the girls charged forward, Both Dean and Cas poked Meg with their lightsabers. Dean quickly avoided and attack from Charlie. "Well, Megs out." Cas smiled.
Dean opened the bathroom door. He half expected to find Cas naked, but he was fully clothed, and running gel through his hair. Cas turned to him, then Dean saw what he was wearing. A black leather biker jacket, a white Sex Pistols shirt, and black worn and ripped skinny jeans. "Got a hot date or something?" Dean smiled. Cas washed the gel off his hands then dried them. He closed the gap between them. "Damn right. Now get dressed. Were gonna paint this town tonight Winchester."
Dean hurt as he listened to Cas sing. He felt every ounce of pain that Cas had gone through; it came out so beautifully in the lyrics and in the music. When the song ended, the whole ballroom burst into cheers and applause. Shouts of "I love you Cas" were heard. Dean saw Cas wipe a tear as he stood up from the piano.
"Son, there are some things in life you have no control over." Dean apparently, had enough. He pushed past his father and made his way to the stairs. Cas looked at John and Mary for a moment. "Sorry." He muttered before getting up and joining Dean. He looked back at the Winchesters. "Are you gonna tell my parents?" Dean answered for them. "Of course they are. Just to ruin our lives."
Dean mentally finished the thought. The doctor opened the door and Dean stepped inside. He was right, it wasn't easy to see. Dean took a deep breath and walked to Cas' bedside. The machines were the only sound in the otherwise quiet room. There was a cast on his left arm and right leg. His right forearm and ribs were wrapped in gauze, and a tube down his throat to help him breathe. He heard the door close behind him. "Jesus Christ Cas..." He whispered, moving strands of hair off Cas' forehead, which was also wrapped in gauze. He bent down and kissed his forehead. The more he looked at Cas, the more he saw red. Wrecking his bike wasn't his fault, it was theirs. He gently put his hand on Cas' chest, feeling it rise and fall. He bent down and kissed his forehead again. "I'll fix this Cas. I swear. I'll make sure they never tough you again." He whispered. He walked out of the room and down the hall. He pushed the door so hard it slammed against the wall. Charlie jumped and looked at him. "Dean?" He ignored her and walked right past. She looked from the door back to him then followed.
Dean took a breath. “They're about a mile out, coming from the north. I'm pretty sure they can't smell us with the direction of the wind. We stand a good chance of making it unnoticed.”
Cas put his book down. “Alright, then. Let’s go.” The two got up and headed out to the barn. Cas grabbed the brushes and picks as Dean collected the gear. They began to brush Pandora and RJ.
"Nope. Just dehydrated ones. They gave us what we would ear on the battlefield." He took a huge bite of eggs. Real food. Real coffee. Man he loved being home. "Man this is good." He said with a mouthful of food. Cas looked at him. "I'm glad you like it." He sat down and took a bite of his own food. Dean finished his food in about a minute. "Did you even taste it?" Cas asked. Dean laughed. "Yeah. Eating fast becomes a habit when you only get so long to eat. Now I know why dad used to eat so fast."
Charlie met up with Meg and the four walked to the mess hall. They were met by Sam, Alec, Benny, Andrea, Bobby, and Ellen. They all got in line and grabbed their food, taking their usual seats at their usual table. Cas came to enjoy the routine.
Cas, Charlie, and Meg were on the stage having a three way light-saber fight. You wouldn't think there would be a such thing as "Advanced Drama" but there it. You just have to audition for it or in very few cases, be switched to it by the teacher. Light from the hallway poured into the dimly lit auditorium. That usually meant Mr. Fergus (He let the students call him Crowley) had entered. He was a short British man with a beard, and he always wore a black suit. Cas, Charlie, and Meg continued with their light-saber fight. "All right you three. Don't kill each other." Cas looked at him and stowed his light-saber. Charlie hit Cas in the shoulder with hers. He brought his back out. "Oh that's it Red! Prepare to meet thy doom!" Charlie ran and jumped off stage. Cas followed her. They ran around the auditorium yelling and laughing like little kids. "All right, calm down Castiel. We have a new arrival." Cas and Charlie stopped and looked at each other. Their faces lit up. It was a rare occasion when someone switched from drama four to advanced.
Cas moved his hands down to the waistline of Dean's jeans and unbuttoned them. He moved down and took the zipper between his teeth and pulled down. Then took the fabric in his hands and yanked them down to Dean's ankles before straightening. Cas undid his own zipper and pushed his jeans to the floor.
"Mmm... okay..." Cas inhaled sharply as Dean continued to push himself in. When he felt himself bottom out, he stopped and kept himself still inside of Cas, causing his partner to writhe beneath him. He leaned in a kissed Cas full on the mouth, deep and slow, letting his tongue explore the interior. Cas returned the kiss, running his own tongue along Dean's. Cas swallowed a grunt as he felt Dean begin to move inside of him. Dean moved his hips slowly, not wanting to rush. Sometimes, you just gotta stop and smell the roses. That is exactly what Dean was doing; taking the time to slow down and enjoy it. Every slow steady thrust, every breath, every bead of sweat. Every heartbeat. He relished in the small sounds coming from Cas; the quiet, wrecked sounding moans that escaped his lips. He thrust into Cas again. Cas responded by digging his nails into the bed and arching his back. Dean felt a tingling in his gut, signaling that if he wasn’t careful this would be over early. He took a deep breath to calm himself. Dean angled himself and brushed against the soft cluster of nerves. Cas squeezed his eyes shut. His mouth open, he let out a loud moan. Just listening to Castiel was going to do him in. Dean almost lost control, biting his lip again and taking another breath.
By January they still haven't found him. Everyone was about to give up. But not Cas. He refused. He would yell at them and tell them Dean would have never given up. Not ever.
When he was done he set his guitar on the stand and made his way to the sound board, putting on another pair of headphones. It was already late, almost midnight. He played the track back and played with the sound board. His head fell to the back of the chair, swiveling in it and looking at the ceiling and taking a hit from the cigarette he just lit. The music ended and he took the headphones off as he stood. "Alright, let's get the vocals and call it good for the day." He stretched, shirt coming up and showing off his hips a little.
The four boys walked out to the fifty yard line. "Call it in the air Lawrence." Dean stepped forward. The ref flipped the coin into the air. "Tails." Dean said. The crowd was silent, waiting those agonizing seconds until the coin hit the ground. Le ref looked at it. "Tails. Your call Lawrence." Dean pulled his guys back, looking over at the other team. "I've studied every team that made it here. These guys, they don't have the distance. We get it first, tire 'em out by halftime. Easy game." Dean said to the three. They agreed. Dean tuned to the ref. "We'll receive."
He thought. He would sleep through the fits of pain, only getting to sleep for about twenty minutes before the pain started up again.
Cas rolled his eyes. "Where I should have been the whole time. On the ranch. With that miserable cowboy."
They pulled into the school parking lot and headed into the building. The school was buzzing with excitement. "Okay, so we're gonna film throughout the day then Mr Surley will excuse everything fifteen minutes early so you can give the school a little concert. I'll film that too. This is gonna be so awesome!" Charlie said. Cas smiled. "Hell yeah it is!"
Cas gave Dean a peck on the cheek and gave him the mp3 player. He pulled out a book for himself. Dean put the headphones on and played the music.
He rolled out of bed and stood up. He opened his door and listened. Nobody home. He half smiled in relief. He didn't bother putting on pants or a shirt since Rob and Julie wouldn't be home for a day or so. They always vanished for a few days after a fight. Hell, they were gone by time he got back from the hospital last night. He half thought they might have come back and just left this morning. He trudged down the stairs to the kitchen and went to the freezer. He grabbed some toaster strudel and put it in the toaster. Grabbing a new pack of cigarettes out of the freezer and opened it. He pushed himself up on the counter and lit the cigarette. His food popped out of the toaster, he was just putting the frosting on it when there was a knock at the door. He slowly looked at it. “Yeah...no. Not in the mood.” The person knocked again. He sighed and went to the door. Taking a bite of his breakfast as he opened the door. He wasn't expecting to be greeted by deep green eyes, light brown hair and a smile that could make anyone go weak in the knees. “Dean?” He swallowed.
"Dammit." He punched the seat again. Castiel had no choice but to get out now because Dean had spotted him and was making his way to the car. He reluctantly opened the door and stepped out of the car.
Dean exhaled slowly, trying to keep himself from going over the edge. He leaned in and took over Cas' mouth, biting at his lip and caressing his tongue with his own. Dean plunged himself deep and slow again, making Cas groan into his mouth. Dean kissed a trail down to Cas' neck to his collarbone, lightly biting and
"Okay, show off. Get in the car." Dean climbed into the driver's seat of the Impala.  Cas slid into the passenger side.
“Exactly.” Dean pushed Cas out the door into the hallway. “Let's go, rockstar. Out.” The two men walked toward their room. Cas looked around.
The ride to the airport was quiet. The boys held hands the whole ride. Dean sighed as they pulled into the airport. "I really don't want to get on that plane." Cas squeezed Dean's hand. "I know, babe. I don't want you to either. But we'll see each other soon. Promise."
"Wait, so does that mean..." Sam began. Dean looked at him. Smiling, he rolled up his sleeve to show the glowing tattoo. "Sure does." He replied proudly. "That would explain why you got so upset when we told you what the tattoo means. We thought you just might not have understood." Mary said. John looked at Dean. "When did it start glowing?" Dean rolled his sleeve down. "When we were ten. We didn't know back then of course, so we thought we were superheros because none of the other kid's tattoos were glowing. We didn't tell anyone because well, a superhero never gives away his identity right?" They all smiled.
"Nice shirt faggot." Benny the linebacker said, shoulder checking him as he passed. Cas dropped his food as a result.
"You heard me. Now get down. Please." Cas rolled his eyes and took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. He swung his leg over RJ’s back and began to dismount.
Cas smiled and took a bite of a cheese stick. "Told them to play there own music. Naturally, he listened because, well, I'm me." He smiled.
A Jeep came out of nowhere from behind them, stopping in front of them. Four men jumped out and like Dean, fired non-fatal shots at the Betas.
Dean quietly unwrapped the present and opened the box. It was a sketch book and new pencils. The sketch book was bound in leather with gold embroidery. Also embroidered in gold, was his name in a beautiful cursive script. Dean looked up. "It's beautiful Cas."
Dean straightened his tie and smoothed out his tux. Sam stood next to him. "Are you nervous?" Dean smoothed his hair and smiled. "Why should I be? I know I want to spend the rest of my life with Cas." Sam smiled. "You two are perfect for each other." Sam clapped him on the shoulder. Dean gently rubbed the back of his head. The steel plate there and the small scars a constant reminder of his time in Germany. He still got pounding headaches, but they no longer caused him to pass out or have seizures. He and Cas were very thankful for that. He ran a finger along the long scar on the back if his head. It took almost a year for all the hair to grow back. "Ready?" Sam asked. Dean nodded.
For the next several hours, the band recorded a few more tracks, Charlie got more footage, and Meg and Dean played a lot of I Spy. Dean was having the time of his life, and watching the love of his life do what he did best was amazing.
"Yeah, well, moms do that. Their like lions or bears. Fuck with their young and the claws come out." Cas laughed. "I guess. This is the first problem like this my mom has delt with. And it happens to involve the whole city. I wouldn't be surprised if this made the news."
Dean put his head back and exhaled. He looked up. “Permission to speak?” He gave Cas a smartassed smile. Cas rolled his eyes. “Yeah?”
Cas laughed. "You're publicist is going to hate you for this. And so is mine. But what the hell. Let's go cause a problem."
There was a knock. Meg got up and answered. Josh was standing there with his phone. "I guess he was watching." He pointed the camera to Cas. Everyone was still cheering. Cas turned around. "You're fucking awesome Josh!"Dean put Cas down on the floor. Cas jogged over to Josh and hugged him. "Seriously! That is... I can't even believe this is happening."
"Okay, I'm gonna leave you two idiots alone and go get a coffee. I'll be back at some point." Charlie smiled at the two men and walked out of the room. Cas turned his eyes back to Dean.
He leaned in, grabbed the phone and yanked it off the wall, throwing it behind him. "Naomi Novak. Where is she?" The lady, now startled, pointed to the ER. Cas took off.
Okay everyone, I have been thinking about how to end this freaking thing for MONTHS now and it's been driving me absolutely insane!!! But here it is: the final chapter of Silence of a Whisper. I know it's not long. I'm sorry.
"Enchiladas and spanish rice." He called from the kitchen. He smiled. It was a running joke that Dean could cook better than Mary. Then Sam walked in. "Is Dean cooking?" Dean laughed to himself. "I don't cook better than mom!"
The porch light turned on. "Dean! Are you okay?" Concern heavy in Cas' voice. "I'm fine grab the bags!" They scrambled to get up. The front door opened and John stepped out on to the porch. "Dean? Castiel? What the hell are you two doing?" His eyes moved from the boys to the bags in their hands. He sighed. "Inside boys. Now."
He opened his eyes and looked down at himself. Shirtless and wearing sweatpants. "Yeah at some point."
"I've never seen Dean raise his fist to another student. From what I've gathered Adam Milligan was making fun of Dean's friend Castiel Novak and Dean broke Adam's nose.." Dean heard his dad sigh. "We are so sorry Mr Fergus. Dean's best friend Castiel moved away a few days ago and Dean is having a hard time with it." Dean scoffed.
Sam put on a bitch face and checked all of his pockets before finally acting relieved and handing off the rings. "Really, Sammy?" Dean asked with a wink. Sam just smiled and shrugged, returning to his spot.
He held the light-saber in the air. Everyone rose to their feet and cheered, including Dean. "Cas has a band. They play every weekend at The Underground. Since you passed his test, you should come." Dean looked at her as Cas jumped off stage. "Cas has a band?"
Alec turned to him. “No, it won't be okay. What I did is far from okay. I deserved to get my ass kicked. I...I'm sorry Dean. I was stupid and jealous and let my emotions get the better of me. But I think it's better for everyone if I just take off for awhile.”
Cas glanced back at the boy that the ass belonged to. "But, you never know. Stranger things have happened."
Cas raised his eyebrows. "Bull shit. I don't believe you." Dean shrugged and started walking to his car. Cas walked the bike behind him. Dean set Cas' guitar in the backseat.
The ride almost seemed to drag. Finally, they made it home. Dean barely had time to close the door before pushed him against it, running one hand up Dean's shirt and the other dipping down into his jeans. Dean ran his hands up Cas' back, digging into the skin with his fingertips and scratching lightly. He leaned in enough to take over the other man's mouth, thrusting his tongue into the depths and nipping at his bottom lip. Cas shuddered again, then hastily tore Dean's shirt, revealing his muscled chest and torso.
"Woops. Didn't mean to do that, but you two will have plenty of time for that because there is now a foot of snow outside."
Cas and the band walked off of the stage and back to their seats. He had panned the crowd while he was up there, but someone was missing.
"You liked it." Cas smiled at Dean as he turned forward and began to back the bike out of their garage.
Cas didn't get a chance to answer. "Alright Mr. Novak, let's get you stitched up." The doctor came in, Cas' file in hand. He looked up at the two boys before his eyes fixed on Cas' lip. "Hell of an injury. You must have quite the pain tolerance." The nurse brought in some instruments as the doctor put on those powdery white gloves. "I don't think I've ever heard of someone getting a lip ring stuck in braces before." He smiled as he grabbed the needle. "Just bad luck I guess." Cas replied, still averting Dean's eyes. Dean stood back and watched as the doctor sewed Cas' lip. Cas didn't move or flinch. Stepping out of the hospital, Dean's eyes never left Cas. Charlie was by her car waiting. Dean stopped him while they were still out of earshot. “I want to know everything.” Finally, Cas lifted his eyes; piercing into Dean's like ice. “Trust me, you don't.” He frowned. Dean let out a frustrated sigh, running his fingers through his hair. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “I just don't understand why you would continue to put yourself through this kind of shit.” “I don't have a choice Dean.” “There's always a choice. Always a way out.” “Well if you find one that doesn't involve getting my ass beat or being homeless, let me know.” He turned to walk to Charlie. “Cas...” “Go home Dean. Leave it be.” Dean woke the next morning and looked at his phone. Charlie had text him letting him know Cas was alright, then another saying Cas wouldn't be in school. He shook his head and sat up. Cas' voice rang in his head. 'Let it be.' Dean didn't know if he could just stay out of it. He got dressed and put his homework in his backpack. Making his way downstairs, Sam popped out from the bathroom. “Hey, is that Cas kid okay?” Dean almost forgot he told his mom and brother that Cas was in the hospital. He, however, didn't tell them what happened at the lake the other day. “He needed a lot of stitches, but he'll live.” He sure as hell wasn't about to tell them what happened. Sam nodded and went back to his morning routine. He made his way into the kitchen and helped himself to the eggs and sausage his mom made while she poured him a glass of orange juice. “I'm glad your friend is okay.” She set the glass down in front of him. Dean nodded as he swallowed his bite of eggs. “Yeah, I don't think he'll be back until he feels better though.” He was at his locker digging through to find the books he would need for his morning classes. “Hey there!” Charlie greeted him, leaning against the locker. He halfheartedly smiled at her.
"It's not him. Can't be him..." Castiel said to himself as he watched the farmhand. The man looked up, revealing green eyes and sandy hair.
“Go after him,” Dean thought to himself. He jumped on Pandora, throwing only her bridle on her. "Gun it, Pan!" The horse took off. Cas already had a good distance on him and RJ was definitely faster than Pandora. But Pan had distance. She could run all day if she had to, like Whiskey before her. There were only so many places Cas would go on this ranch. The cliff being one. But he was just there. And with RJ's speed and Cas with no reins, the horse wouldn't be able to stop in time and could throw Cas into the ravine. "Dammit. Faster Pan! We have to catch them!"
Cas grabbed her and spun her. "Easy there Red. No need for that." He held out his hand. "Cough it up."
Cas exhaled slowly as he felt Dean tighten around him. Two months. But it felt longer. Cas finally bottomed out and was met with a long sigh from Dean, who was laying with his head on the edge of the table, gripping it with both hands. He yelled out as Cas plunged into him, directly onto his prostate. Cas drove into Dean a few more times. Suddenly, Dean felt the table move.
Castiel stood near the edge of the cliff, looking out at the ravine and the night sky. You could see every star in the sky and it was always a beautiful sight. He wished Dean was there. If he was, Cas would lay him down on the grass and take him right there under the stars. "Stop kidding yourself, Novak," he said out loud to himself. He watched the sky for a few more minutes before mounting RJ and heading back to the barn.
"Kinda, yeah." He smiled. He leaned against the wall and looked around. "Hey, remember this place?" He asked wagging his eyebrows. Cas laughed and looked around. He pointed at a building at the end of the ally. "That building there." Dean put his hands on Cas' waist and pulled him closer. "The first time we had sex." Dean finished. Cas smiled. Dean pressed their bodies together. He put his head on Cas' shoulder. "I missed you." Cas whispered. He raised his head to look at him. Green eyes shining in the light of the afternoon sun. He looked into Cas' beautiful blue eyes that he loved and missed so much. "I missed you too. Apart from Adam, you guys kept me going both times. Especially you. Words can never describe how I feel about you, how I'll always feel. It's like half of me has been missing my whole life until the moment I saw you. I had to do something to talk to you. So I made the cigarette excuse. It bugged me at first how much I wanted you, because I've never wanted somebody that much before. That scared me. You caught me totally off guard." He paused only to place a hand on Cas' cheek. "I love you. And I hate that I have to hide my love for you. It's not fair that a man and a woman can show their love for each other and we can't. I'm tired of it. If I can't show other people how much I love you then what the hell did I just fight-" He stopped, taking Cas by the hand and leading him back to the diner. He turned and looked at him. "Dean, what are you-?" Dean cut him off by kissing him. Cas immediately melted into Dean, wrapping his arms around his neck. Dean moved his hands to Cas' hips. The kiss was slow, deep, and passionate. When he stopped, he put Cas's head on his chest. "I love you." Cas looked up at him. Dean could feel everyone within eyesight was staring at them. "Do you know what you just did?" Cas asked.
The way he whispered it sent a shiver down his spine. He pushed the cards off the bed, hearing them fall to the floor, then put a hand on Cas' hip and slowly pushed him down. Cas tugged down Dean's pajama pants, boxers going down for the ride. Dean got the clothing the rest of the way off and tossed them aside, then pulled off Cas' pajama pants. He couldn't help but smile a little when he noticed Cas was already starting to get wet.
Cas had stayed in his cabin and was still fast asleep when Dean left. He left the cabin and walked up the hill a little to Alec's cabin.
But, he hadn't used in a long time, so maybe they wouldn't send him off. Another cough. Another growl. The he realized he could probably moon the passersby. He was bored. Cas turned and started to sing Celebrity Status. More coughing. He kicked the IV cart. "I'm fucking twenty and I'm pretty much in the fucking glue factory," he said out loud to himself. He kicked the IV stand again and it fell to the ground, almost ripping the IV out of his hand. "Mother fucker!" He bent over and stood it up. The door flew open. "Cas?"
His feet felt cemented to the ground. His palms were sweaty. He didn't have his ring on and his hand felt weird. And he felt like his heart might explode. But as he rounded the corner and started down the aisle, he looked up.
Cas leaned in to Dean and whispered in his ear. “What does he mean, he got us the best?” Dean shrugged. “Guess we'll find out.”
Dean didn't answer him. “Benny, get all the Alphas together. Sammy, Cas, you two get the Omegas, Betas, and kids out of here.”
Dean looked up from the magazine he was reading. The man in the doorway smiled and motioned for him. Dean stood up and set the magazine on the table, then followed the man in the room.
"Well, duh. I came up with it."Cas smiled. "I got it! You're helping. Come to my lair. We have work to do."
They stayed there for a few minutes in silence as they recovered from the first time either of them had felt release in two months.Cas grabbed some wet wipes and handed one to Dean. Dean looked at him. "I have a habit of spilling shit when I get excited."
"Yeah, no. Barking up the wrong dick honey. Somebody get that bitch a dildo! Hold on..." Cas jumped off stage. "Who said that?" A young woman raised her hand. Cas grabbed her and took her on stage. He stood her in front of Josh. "Josh, meet fuck me lady. Fuck me lady, meet Josh. Have fun." The crowd was roaring with laughter.
A low, rough voice spoke up. "Just ignore her. She'll stop eventually." Cas still had his face in his pillow.
Dean walked to him. "They won't adopt me or they'll lose the money. They know I won't leave because I have nowhere else to go, and honestly , who wants to adopt a seventeen year old gothic gay kid."
"Bye, dear!" She was still laughing. The boys made their way to the steps. Cas almost tripped again. "You got this?"
Dean walked out of the store with a smile on his face. He zipped up his jacket and walked to the Impala. It may be the first day of spring break, but winter in Michigan did not want to leave. He slid in the driver seat and started the car. He looked at the store he was just in. His smile grew as he drove away.
"Cas...baby...you need to let me go. What you're doing, it's going to kill you. I know you won't listen to anyone else. That's why I'm here."
His days were filled with marching, weapons training, physically training, and parachute safety training. They didn't get to actually jump out of planes until the second month. Dean passed everything with flying colors. Then came the mission training. They had to jump out of a plane, find cover under fire, and provide back up to an infantry unit that had been pinned down by the enemy. They weren't firing live rounds, though the blanks hurt like a bitch. Sargent said Dean was a natural like his dad. Dean and Adam became good friends. Dean would always help Adam and thought of him as his little brother. Always making sure he rigged up properly. Dean had also become the platoon leader by unanimous decision. There was no denying he was the best. He graduated top of the class and was promoted to private first class. He couldn't wait to get home.
Okay guys...I started writing this chapter at around 3pm yesterday (8/14/15) and worked almost non-stop to finish it. (finishing around 9:50am 8/15/15) This is the longest chapter so far (with almost 5,000 words) Why did I do this? Because I love y'all. In a platonic way of course. So thank you guys! I hope you enjoy! Don't forget to comment!!
“Who in the hell…?” Charlie walked to the front door and opened it she was surprised to see Cas, who was supposed to be touring right then. He smiled at her.
Two hours passed in a blur. Finally, it was time for the last song of the night. Cas stepped up to the mic, panting from the intensity of the evening.
He walked down the steps and slid on a pat h of ice, hitting the ground with a thud. Great, just how he wanted to end his night. "Are you okay?" He heard from behind him. He sat up. "Yeah, just adding insult to injury."
Dean jumped up from his seat. “What the hell?!” He looked at Naomi. “Did you just see… holy shit! This guy is so getting banned today…” Naomi put her binoculars up to her eyes. Benny walked over to Dean.
The next morning, Dean was loading their things in the car. Mary gave Cas a hug. John and Sam shook his hand. "Take care of him." Mary told Cas. Dean rolled his eyes as he closed the trunk. "I will." Cas replied. Dean opened the door for Cas. "Ready?" Cas nodded. He got in and Dean closed the door.
"Yeah I did. What changed? I just woke up. and said enough. Worked on the Impala all night. Charlie came over that morning to check on me and I was already just about finished with it. Then I built the barn with Benny. Truth be told, I couldn't stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore. I was basically wasting away to nothing and it was literally killing me." Cas gripped Dean's knee, feeling a scar that must have been from the accident. "I'm sorry you had to go through that. I... saying that I wish I could have been here is pointless..."
"There you two are! We've been calling for an hour!" Charlie said, walking into the barn with the rest of the gang on her heels. "Where the hell were you?"
"Well, look at you, football star. Guess you're more than just a spandex-clad ass. Next clue is (drumroll) where did we first tell each other "I love you?" Dean looked up. "Yeah, that memory is permanently etched in my brain as Cas was practically bleeding to death in my arms. Off to the park!"
Dean stayed bent over, trying to calm his breath. He finally straightened as Cas turned the shower off. "Well, nothing like Christmas shower sex to get the day going." Dean laughed. "Good food, good sex, how can you beat that?" Cas stepped out, grabbed a towel, and began drying himself. "By more good food and good sex." He smiled. "Yeah, I'm gonna need to recover from this round first." Cas' smile grew. "Shut up."
"Well, you're definitely good at it." Cas said to him. He took another bite. Dean took a bite of his own. Sam was right, he outdid himself. They talked about school, and what Sam has planned for after graduation. "I want to go to law school and become a lawyer." Dean nodded. "Good choice Sammy. What about Jess?" Sam set his fork  down. "She's going to be a doctor."
The ride was almost silent, save for a few words of encouragement from Dean. As they pulled into the back lot of the venue, Cas turned pale.
Dean pulled up in front of the house a little after ten in the morning. He drove through the night to beat a storm that was about to hit. He had driven through some of it and traffic was at a near stand-still for a long time. "It looks exactly the same." Cas said. Dean turned the car off and got out. He grabbed his duffel and Cas' rolling travel bag. The front door opened and Dean looked up. "Dean!" His not so little brother walked down the path, meeting Dean halfway. "Hey Sammy." Dean smiled. Sam was now sixteen. "Let's get inside, it's freezing out here."
"Well, I guess we don't have any other option but to just stay in." Dean took another bite. "But if you keep cooking like this I'll never want to leave." Cas smiled at him. "I'm not that good. I pretty much had to learn to cook or survive on ramen noodles." Push by Marianas Trench played through the speakers as Cas cleared the table and washed the dishes. He grabbed the sprayer and sprayed Dean, laughing at the look on Dean's face. "Oh it's like that?" He grabbed Cas around the waist and picked him up. Cas laughed and struggled against him a bit. Dean walked to the bathroom and turned the shower on and put Cas under the water. "Oh I don't think so." Cas pulled Dean in with him. Dean slipped a little as Cas dragged him under the water. He braced himself on the wall, locking eyes with Cas.
Dean moved so he was facing Cas. "Where did that come from?" He was still trying to catch his breath.
Cas opened one eye and saw Charlie spinning around with Meg singing that stupid song over and over. Cas groaned. Dean through a pillow at them.
“There's an old mine up ahead. Only one way in or out so it'll be easier to protect you guys.” Meg said.
So to make up for my lack of posting, I'll put up another chapter tonight. In the meantime...what did you think? Don't be afraid to drop a comment, I don't bite!
"Hey! So I'm going to a New Year's Eve party in Kansas City.... oh you know, Cas and the gang....oh and Marianas Trench................. I know right?! Cas was amazing at the show and they loved him. They invited him, us, and the band to hang out.......I'll be by to grab some stuff....love ya. Bye." Dean hung up the phone in time to see Cas run out of the room screaming.
He dropped the envelope. Something fell out. He picked it up and looked at it. It was a picture of them. Kissing on the alter. Cas couldn't stop himself from crying. Dean must have put it in the envelope during the reception. When he said he was going to the bathroom. fifteen minutes before he was attacked. Cas cried holding the letter and the picture to his heart. "I love you too Dean Winchester. I'll always love you."
Cas put his clothes on in record time and he too ran out of the room. He looked for Meg everywhere, but when he couldn't find her, he just went to the car, grabbed his bag, and started walking.
Dean and the others jumped up and screamed, clapping and whistling as Cas was handed a banner and a trophy. “Woo!! That's my man! Yeah!” Dean hugged Naomi. “See? Aren't you glad you changed your mind?” Naomi smiled. “I am. He looks…”
"Me and Dean." Charlie sighed and looked at Cas. "He's cuckoo bananas for you, dude. Seriously. I wouldn't worry if I were you." He looked at her. "I'm sure there will be someone who's not as fucked up as I am wherever the hell he's going."
Okay, you wanted more? Here's more! I guess my one shot just became a multi chapter short fic. ENJOY!
They moved slowly at first, shooting Betas in the leg so they wouldn't follow. They cleared a path, grabbing ammunition off the wounded Betas as they passed. As soon as they were able, they made a break for the woods nearby, running for what felt like hours until slowing to a walk.
Cas' mom slowly pulled away. Cas turned around, facing the rear window. John and Mary were standing behind Dean. Both had a hand on either of his shoulders. Dean looked down at his arm. The further Cas was, the more the tattoo faded. Dean looked up, Cas was out of sight.
Cas knew she meant condoms. He sighed and got up from the bar and went to his room and grabbed a box of condoms from his dresser and put them in his travel bag. He walked back out and sat in the stool and continued eating his eggs. "Good boy." She smiled and ruffled his hair. Cas fought the urge to stick out his tongue. He finished eating just as he heard the Impala pull up and shut off. The football players still had school all day since it took around thirty minutes to get to Kansas City where the state football playoffs were taking place. The even would take all weekend with the championship game being held on Sunday night. Whoever decided it would be a good idea to let Dean, Cas, and Charlie run around Kansas City unsupervised made a huge mistake. Dean walked in. Cas turned around and looked at him. "Well, you clean up nicely Winchester." Dean was wearing khaki dress pants, black dress shoes, a white button up long sleeve shirt, and a red tie. "Thanks. I'm supposed to wear my away jersey but I'll put it on at school. Ready to go?" Cas finished his coffee and nodded. "Just gotta get my bag first. Well, school bag and travel bag." Dean followed Cas to his room. Cas grabbed his school bag, Dean grabbed his travel bag. "I take it you still can ride?" Dean asked.
Dean turned around and looked at Cas, walking backwards. He winked and smiled, then turned and kept walking. Adam punched Cas in the arm. "Welcome back." Cas laughed. "Thanks." They walked inside and everyone sat in the living room.
That's when the smell hit him, causing him to stop dead in his tracks. He was close to the exit, but he turned around, running towards the smell. He stopped when he saw someone in front of him. The silhouette raised it's head, sniffing, the turned abruptly.
"Well, you've outdone me there." Cas ran his hands down his face. "Did everyone say what a total loser I am? Can't even keep my shit together to bury my own mom. My husband had to do it because I put myself in the hospital."
Dean read it over. “I'll take a small group tonight and get everything we need. Good job Chuck.” He patted Chuck on the shoulder.
They piled in the Impala and headed toward the venue. Dean looked over and saw Cas nervously tapping his leg. Dean put his hand on Cas' knee. "Babe?"
Cas looked up at Dean, wide-eyed. “Are you fucking kidding me?! He cut me?” He looked down at his leg.
"Can I read it first? No offense but I don't like to be bullshited." The man slid him the contract. Cas read everything, including the fine print. Everything looked legit. He read what their sign on bonus would be and looked up. "You're giving us half a million each just to sign with you?"
Cas pushed his hand down on the wound, squeezing his eyes shut and grunting in pain. "It didn't hit any vitals. It did go all the way through though." Dean moved so he could see his back. "I see it. What do I do?"
The kept him alive for reasons he didn't know. They had put a steel plate in the back of his head. It was a miracle that he didn't get blown in half. There really must be a God. The last thing he remembered before waking up in a cell was Adam. Saying he'd tell Cas he went out like a hero. Cas. The Army must have told him by now that he's dead. His heart sank. Cas thinks he's dead. If he didn't get our of here he might as well be. Dean was to weak to do anything. He couldn't walk because of his legs. He was surprised he still had them. He still lost consciousness frequently, but he refused to die. He promised Cas he'd come home to him. Alive. The "back in one piece" part was a little harder since part of his skull is in the woods somewhere. His head was exploding with pain. He fought to stay conscious but still faded.
Cas sighed and ended the call, promptly putting his face back into the pile of papers in front of him.
Charlie dropped her fork. "Seriously?! Vegas?! Holy crap!" Cas pulled the tickets out of his pocket and passed them around. "First class. Being a rock star does have it's advantages." He smiled. "Well what are we waiting for?!" Charlie exclaimed. Cas laughed. "First, since we didn't pack, we'll need clothes. I figured we'd hit up the mall."
"Dean, if you don't get your ass back on that stretcher and at least go get checked out, I will put you there myself."
Sam huffed a laugh. "Yeah, kinda. I mean, yesterday you threw a fit about eating now look, you're already almost finished."
Cas nodded, sitting on the bed. It was actually pretty comfortable. “He said Dean basically invented them.”
"You have no clue how we speak to him. We can speak to him however we want. We are his parents. We know what's best for him." She shot at him. Dean turned to her. "And I don't? Is that it?" Cas took a step forward, Dean motioned for him to stay put. "No Dean. You don't. All his life Castiel has needed someone to hold his hand and baby him-"
Dean looked sadly into Cas' eyes. "Well, you're dad's not a thing anymore, Jaxon will eat dirt if he does anything ever, and the overdose was the result of a mental breakdown. Not that those things weren't awful, because they were, but there were other factors. And you're gonna be busy with the new album and with the guys." He took Cas' hand and kissed it. "I'm coming back, baby. And I'll see if I can come home again in a couple of weeks."
At sundown, Dean came in and showered like usual. But when he went to his room there was a note on his bed. He walked over and picked it up. “What the… huh. ‘See you in the barn.’ Weird. But okay…” He dressed and headed back out.
Cas stifled a groan, quickly trying to will his oncoming erection away before Dean noticed. He bit his lip.
He took another drink then noticed his tattoo was-. No, could it be? He set his beer down and rolled up his sleeve. It was glowing! His eyes darted around the room. Nobody matched.
"First things first, I need a damn shower." Cas said. He stood up and looked at Dean. "Care to join me?" He extended a hand to Dean, wagging his eyebrows. Charlie was jumping up and down squealing.  Dean ignored her and stood up, taking Cas’ hand. "Right behind ya."
“So, are you gonna get dressed?” He asked eyeing Cas up and down, smiling slyly and wagging his eyebrows. Cas looked down, forgetting he was in his boxers. Cas shook his head and let Dean in. “Just sit in the kitchen and don't touch anything.” Dean nodded, not prying the subject, he sat at the kitchen table. Cas took the stairs two at a time and went to his room. He rummaged through his closet, finding a long-sleeve dark grey thermal shirt that had Avenged Sevenfold on it. He slid it over his head, pulling his arms through the sleeves. He grabbed a pair of Tripp pants with red straps and slid them on. He grabbed some socks out of his drawer and walked back downstairs. Sitting on the bottom step and put his socks on. He stood up and looked at Dean. “So really, what are you doing here?” He asked. Dean stood up and walked over to the door and opened it, looking back at Cas smiling. “Just get in the damn car.”
"Then why are you laughing?" He ran to the front door and stopped. "Don't you dare." Dean warned. Cas wagged his eyebrows and opened the door. "Cas..." He slowly backed out the door, still smiling. Dean ran to him, he grabbed for the picture again. Cas ran out the door and jumped off the porch, running down the path. John, Mary, and Sam stood on the porch. Mary took a few pictures. "Oh thanks, take pictures...big help." Dean said and continued to chase Cas around the yard. Dean finally grabbed Cas around the waist and wrapped his arms around him. "Gotcha!"
Charlie bobbed her head. "Oh, you know. Stuff. And whatnot. Important stuff and whatnot. I'll see you idiots later." Charlie winked and flounced out of the room.
Dean leaned against the counter. "I know babe. But we knew what we signed up for when we graduated."
Cas smiled. "Too bad there's not butter on the table. Then I can say 'and I can't believe it's not butter.'” He smiled. “Anyway, I figured after dinner, we could go see a movie.”
Since he got home, he focused all of his though on his physical therapy. At first he went twice a month. Then three times, until he was going twice a week. He was doing better, but still had to use his crutches or his wheelchair on the bad days. He also started getting blinding migraines due to the plate. The pain was to much for him to keep a straight face in front of Cas.
"Cas, please answer. Please! I swear to God that's not what it looked like! Call me...please." He hung up and walked over to Jaxon. "If anything happens to him because of this, I'll fucking kill you."
"Uh, yeah," Dean said, clearing his throat. "I'm great, it's just..." he huffed a laugh. "Guess I'll just be honest. You have beautiful eyes."
The needle dropped from his hand, falling to the floor with a light thud. He looked at Cas in horror. “Why would they do that?” His voice was barley a whisper. Cas bent over and picked up the needle, putting it back in the drawer then closing it. “Are you sure you can handle the answer?” Slowly turning his head to Dean, the light leaving his eyes to be replaced by a cold blue flame. “Nobody knows about this. Not even Charlie.” He took a few steps closer. “If you tell anyone, I'm dead. That's not a joke either. They will beat me with in an inch of my life. Rob was being nice when he pulled my lip ring out. That's what happens when you threaten to go to the cops. When I'm at school, I just feel better. Like I can be myself. When I'm here-” He sniffed then wiped his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie. “Charlie and Ellen were literally my only reason to get out of bed until you.” The usually well composed kid standing before Dean was slowly breaking down. Tears slowly filling his eyes. “I can't do it anymore Dean.” He used his other sleeve for his eyes.
“Seriously man, if they wanna wait to mate, that's up to them.” Benny said. Benny and Dean had become fast friends, and Benny seemed to fit right in with the group. As did Andrea.
Cas sighed. “I'm gay, mom. I like men. I doubt grandchildren are on the table.” He was shocked at the lack of emotion in his voice.
"Dean, you need to get up here...it's Cas..." There was a lot of commotion in the background. Dean hung up and took off running, head for the elevator. He punched the floor number repeatedly until it stopped. He bolted out the door and down the hall, running into people, almost knocking a few down. When he got to the room, he tried to go in but someone grabbed him. "Sir, you can't be here."
"We wait I guess." Dean wedged himself next to Cas, who turned so that he was laying across Dean with his feet hanging over the arm of the chair. "This is way more complicated than it should have been."
Dean gently shook Cas as they turned into the driveway. Cas picked his head up and yawned. "Home already? Didn't we just leave the track?"
The students cheered and whsitled. The high fived Cas as they left the gym. "I can't wait to see it finished!" Cas turned to the band. "We fucking did it!" The guys high fived and hugged it out. "I'll have this done in no time. I'll call ya when it's ready." Charlie packed up and headed out.
Dean turned around, eyes locking on to Cas. "Cas? Holy shit!" His smile lit up the room. He pretty much tackled Cas to the floor.
"That's the best way to explain it. But right now he thinks he's back in Germany. It happened to me after I came back. The doctors call it Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He needs to go home. To be away from the noise." They all looked at Dean, trembling in the back seat. "Make it stop! Please!" He yelled. John got in the car and started it. Cas jumped in the passenger seat. John looked at him. "We don't have time for you to sit here. If you expect me to run there while Dean is like this, then you can fuck off." John nodded. He tore out on to the road, doing well over the speed limit.
He couldn't move. Every inch of his body hurt. He didn't know how long he had been lying there when another student found him. The hospital contacted John. He and Sam both rushed there. The police wanted his statement. Dean didn't say a word. He didn't even look at John or Sam when they walked in. He was to numb to care. "What about that Wyatt kid who always writes those comments?" For the first time in what felt like hours,Dean looked at his father. Going pale at the sound of his name and wide eyed in horror. Sam showed the cops the comments and they left to find him.
Dean gently ran his fingers down Cas' chest, letting his instinct take over seemed a good way to go. He walked back to the bed and spun Cas around, slowly lowering him onto the bed. He took off his flannel shirt and his t-shirt, throwing both to the floor. He then moved on top of Cas, kissing his neck. He could hear Cas' heart beating through their breathing.
She pulled away. "Okay, I want to take pictures of you and your friends." Cas, Charlie, Meg, and Dean all stood next to each other. Meg was next to Charlie. Dean was next to Cas. The moms took pictures. Charlie and Meg went to go find their parents.
"Thanks for the coffee." He put his arm around Dean and they walked out. Once outside, Cas unlocked the saddlebag and took the helmets out, handing
When he was finally finished, he practically ran to Cas' cabin. Looking through the screen door, he saw Cas sitting on the floor next to the bed.
"See? If she didn't recognize your sent, she would have growled at you." He sat down and pet the dogs head. Dean slowly sat down, keeping his eyes on the dog. Cas chuckled. "It's okay Dean. She won't mess with you. Well, she'll probably luck you to death but that's it."
Dean hung his head for a second then looked back at him. "I promised I'd come back to you, didn't I? I remember when you yelled that at the hospital."
"Come on, what's he gonna do? Write a song about it?" Dean grabbed him and pushed him against the wall. "You have no idea who he is and what he's been through. Write a song bashing me? I can live with that. But him relapsing or even wrecking the car he's in, I can't. I made a promise to him when we graduated that no matter where he was, I would still be there." Jaxon looked at him. "Come on Winchester, if he wouldn't have shown up, we both know you would have kept going." Dean didn't say anything. He stepped back and punched Jaxon in the face. "That's what you get for thinking mother fucker. Now stay away from me."
"You ready for the big time babe?" Dean looked at Cas. "Damn right." Cas pushed the door open, still holding Dean's hand.
He was sitting on the couch in the living room. Cas was making lunch in the kitchen. Dean's head started pounding. He leaned forward, digging his nails into the couch. Cas was watching closely. He never knew what to expect. Dean laid on the couch and curled onto a ball, grunting in pain. He rolled off the couch onto the floor. Cas ran to him, moving the coffee table. He started seizing. Cas grabbed his hand. "It's okay. I'm right here." He moved the couch back with his feet. The doctor told Cas if he ever seized to just move everything around him and wait til it passed. He couldn't do anything but watch Dean flail around. He moved Dean to his side so he didn't choke on his tounge. After a moment, it passed. Dean's breath was shallow and rapid. He laid there with his eyes open, not blinking. Cas knew he passed out. When he came to, he slowly looked over at Cas, who was sitting with his arms on his knees. His head tilted back on the coffee table. He looked around noticing everything was moved. He looked back at Cas. "Had a seizure, didn't I?" Cas jumped and looked at him. He moved closer. "Yeah."
Dean swiped the key card and pushed Cas through the door. They were practically tearing at each others clothes. Dean ripped Cas' jacket off and let it drop to the floor. He walked him back to the bed and pushed Cas down. He moved to Cas' travel bag and grabbed a condoms and lube, tossing them on the bed as he ran a hand up Cas' shirt, then pulled it over his head. Cas pulled off Dean's army green jacket. Dean pulled his own shirt over his head and it dropped to the floor. He leaned down and brushed his lips up Cas' stomach to his chest. He Grabbed Cas' hands and pinned them underneath him. "Rule number two: No playing with yourself." Cas' head fell back to the bed. "Well look at you go Winchester. Alright, I'll bite." He sat up and took off his shoe and took off the lace and handed it to Dean. Dean raised his eyebrows. Cas held out his arms. Dean pushed Cas back down, flipping him over and tied his hands behind his back. He rolled Cas back over. He grabbed the condom and ripped it open with his teeth. He took of his jeans and boxers, rolling the condom on. He unbuttoned and slowly unzipped Cas' jeans, pulling them down, his boxers going down with them. Only problem was, Cas' cast. Dean slowly removed it from Cas' leg and even more slowly pulled his jeans the rest of the way off. "Dean, That's not really necessary. It's just a brace and it's only there as a precaution." Dean looked at him. "See?" He moved his ankle and his toes. Dean shook his head.
“Hey Dean. Can you make the shift arrangements? You forgot to yesterday.” Benny reminded him. Dean sighed, not really wanting to stay behind, but it needed to be done. So he worked out the shifts, keeping himself on the same shift as Cas.
Dean rolled his eyes and moved in for a kiss. Again Cas pulled him closer, holding him there. If this was any other time, Dean wouldn't be opposed. "Winchester! Stop making out with your boyfriend and get your ass on the field!" Cas let go and Dean pulled away. "See you in a bit. There's something I want to show you."
Dean stirred a little, slowly waking up. "You guys talk too much." He said, still half asleep. His eyes shot open and he sat up quickly. Electric blue eyes were looking back at him. "You're really slow on the uptake, aren't you?" Cas smiled.
Two and a half hours later, Cas found himself pulling into the familiar, dusty driveway of the Winchester ranch. Nothing had changed. Same barn, same house, same shutters, same...
"Nope. Pandora and RJ are brother and sister. Pandora's older by two years. RJ is two years old."  Cas scratched his head.
What the hell was wrong with him? Anna was always a favorite of his. She bit at his neck and his head fell back as a moan escaped his lips. “Ca…” Anna stopped and looked at him. “What did you…?” Dean opened his eyes and looked at Anna. His erection was gone, like it had never happened. Shit.
Dean did the same, moving his hands around Cas' back and just under the waist of his jeans. Dean moved his hips against Cas', noticing a lump in between his thighs. Dean moved again and heard a small moan come from Cas.
Cas drove back to the studio to finish the album. He downloaded a rough cut of the album on Dean's phone so he could listen to it. He got out of the car and walked into the studio. The deadline was in twenty-four hours and they still had to finish two songs. He jumped right on the sound board and polished the unfinished tracks.
As Cas readied himself and RJ, he was shaking a little. It was nerve-wracking enough to be here, but with the added pressure of Crowley and his horse he was losing confidence fast. He took a deep breath and calmed himself. He felt a hand on his low back.
"But before that I stalked you and after that we had sex on a cliff. So technically I wasn't lying."
"You see? See what you've turned him into? He's become a shadow of your corruption! A walking sin!" Dean looked at her. "Excuse me?" He took a step closer to her. "What did you just call him?"
"So you don't regret not telling me you were going to die?" His eyes filled, threatening to spill over. And here he thought he couldn't cry anymore.
The pace horse and rider led Cas and RJ the rest of the way to the start gate, where another man guided them in. It was narrow and RJ was getting rowdy, but so were some of the other horses. Cas looked around. Crowley was four gates down. As the timer ticked down, Cas got into position.
"Here's to me coming home, to you finally talking about your feelings, and to us, because we finally stopped being assholes about how we feel for each other. I honestly couldn't be happier than I am right now. I love you."
Josh grabbed the mic. "Are you fuck... is this real life?! Dude! I don't have the words to explain how I feel right now. Let's let them do it for me." He held the mic out at the crowd again, who completely lost their minds. People were jumping and screaming for Join The Hunt. Both bands came together at the front of the stage. "One more time for Cas and Join The Hunt!" The crowd screamed some more, raising their hands up and cheering. A bra was tossed at Cas.
Hours passed. Cas still wasn't answering his phone. No rockstars had been admitted to any of the nearby hospitals. The guys from the band couldn't find him. And Dean still hadn't called Cas' agent.
He moved his hips a little faster, hitting the sweet spot just a little harder. Cas cried out a moan. "God...Dean...I'm..."
They stood there for a minute in silence. "Listen Cas, I miss your mom and I want to be a family." Cas put his hands in his pockets. "Sounds like a personal problem to me. We don't want anything to do with you." Mark took a few steps forward, Cas took a few back. "Just hear me out."
Dean slowly pushed the door open. The sounds of the machine helping Cas breathe, and the heart rate monitor were the only sounds in the room.
He almost jumped through the roof of the porch. Charlie had sneaked up on him. Damn, she was good at that.
Charlie stopped walking and put her hands on Cas’ shoulders. “Let’s get one thing straight here, mister, and it’s not you. No one here has ever hated you. Missed you, yeah of course, but we always talked about you coming back one day. And here you are. We love you, Castiel. Hell, you could’ve just rolled up to Dean’s doorstep and he would have let you in.”
Dean walked into the sound booth, paying no attention to the other band members. He stood in front of Cas, hands on both sides of Cas' face staring into those electric blue eyes. "I'm... I'm so sorry..."
Dean stepped out on to the back porch. "Breakfast will be ready soon honey." His mom said as he closed the door. He didn't feel like eating. He didn't feel like doing anything. He walked to the barn and over to his horse. "Hey Whiskey." He pet her neck. A few stalls down, an Appaloosa was snorting loudly and hitting the door of the stall. "Dammit River, stop it." The horse never stopped causing a commotion, just like his owner when he was here. River hit the door again.
He looked over at the stands. Cas and Charlie decided to stay and watch the whole game. Dean smiled. "Red eighty-five!" He yelled. His teammates moved into position. "Red eighty-five!" He looked back and forth down the line to make sure his guys were in the right place. He looked down. "Hut!" The ball was snapped. He caught it and took three wide steps back. He couldn't find Cole and he was in danger of being sacked. He tucked the ball under his arm and ran. Benny and Cain guarded him until they got taken down. Dean was faster than people thought. He was well ahead and pretty much walked it in for a touchdown. The crowd jumped to their feet and cheered. Dean took off his helmet and raised it above his head, smiling. His team gathered around him and patted him on the back, shoulders, and head. He looked at the clock. Just enough time for one more play. He ran over to the coach. The both looked at the clock, then at each other. "Think you got one more in you Winchester?" Dean looked at the bleachers to see Cas and Charlie were dancing with the band music. He laughed then looked back at the coach. "Yes sir."
"It's okay. You're doing fine." Dean pulled Cas a little closer, letting Cas rest his head on Dean's chest. "See, you can slow dance."
Dean snapped his head back, connecting with Alec's nose, hearing it break. Dean turned around. Grabbing Alec's shoulder, he swept his leg and hitting his foot, pushing him backwards. Alec's head bounced off the floor. Dean grabbed his hair and slammed Alec's head into the floor, snarling.
On Independence Day, Cas talked about talking Dean to the fireworks show. Dean smiled. "That would be nice." Dean was finally able to dress himself. They left the house around eight pm. Dean was using his crutches so his legs could get some exercise. Cas brought the wheelchair just in case. They walked the three blocks to Sam's house. The four of them went to the show together, meeting Bobby, Ellen, Jo, and John there. It was the first time Dean had been out of the house since he got home, except for going to physical therapy. About half way to the show, Dean got tired and decided to use the wheelchair. Even though he hated using it.
The music started and Cas sang into a hairbrush in nothing but a shirt and his underwear. He was wearing oversized aviators. Dean nodded as he watched; Cas did totally rock that song, even at ten years old. But it was also extremely adorable and Dean would be getting Charlie to make a copy.
Cas didn't even notice Dean was next to him until he smelled him. Dean was grabbing random things, piling stuff on his tray.
The staff gathered their things and said nonchalant good lucks to Cas. Finally they filed out of the room. His lawyer stopped in the doorway.
They walked out the back and Dean opened the passenger door to the Impala. Cas slid into the seat and closed the door. Dean got in and stared it up. "What about my bike?"
“What Dean?” He pulled away just a fraction. Dean locked his eyes onto Cas', going from jade to emerald. Cas had almost forgotten that Dean's eye color changed with his mood. Even when he had just been admiring these eyes from afar he could almost tell by the color what mood Dean was in. Forest when he was happy or excited, juniper when he was mad or upset, and jade or emerald when he was passionate. Not just the sex kind of passionate, it was the same when he was on the field sometimes. Dean said nothing he grabbed the box and walked backward to his bed, setting the box on the floor next to it as he lay on top of it. Cas flipped the shoe box open and grabbed the bottle of lube and the dildo, squirting a couple drops on it then rubbing it around. “I want to try something, but if it's to much at any time, tell me and I'll stop.” Dean nodded and closed his eyes. Cas put the tip of the dildo on Dean's hole, with his free hand he slowly stroked Dean's dick. He slowly pushed the dildo inside Dean, working it in for a good few minutes. Cas grabbed the lube and squirted a few drops on his dick and worked it around for a few seconds the put the tip on Dean's hole, pulling the dildo out a little. “This might hurt or be uncomfortable but if you can ride it out, I promise you won't regret it.” Dean kept his eyes closed. He nodded, taking a deep breath. Cas very slowly and carefully pushed the tip in. Dean squeezed his eyes shut, confirming for Cas that he's never done this before. In a way, it both scared and excited him. He didn't want to hurt Dean, well, not much, only in a sexual way that he knows will feel good. That's what excited him. Dean trusted him enough to try new thing, explore and take time to appreciate sex, not just have sex to have sex. What really surprised Cas was that Dean trusted him this much in the few days that they have been talking. His slowly pushed in a little more, squeezing his own eyes shut at the feeling of Dean contracting around him. He heard Dean suck in a breath through his teeth and his eyes shot open. “Dean?”
Dean woke up to the most amazing thing that he possibly could. Cas was sleeping next to him. His hair was in different directions and he was snoring lightly, laying on his back. The blankets were just high enough to show his hips. Dean propped himself up on his elbow and just watched Cas sleep before kissing his forehead lightly. Cas stirred and slowly opened those breathtaking electric blue eyes, smiling sleepily. "Mornin." He said, voice thick with sleep.
"Cas! Come on! This is the one thing you can't show up fashionably late for!" Charlie yelled. She looked at Dean. "I swear he'd be later to his own funeral." Dean laughed. Cas Walked out of the bathroom. "Jeez. Can't even get ready in peace." He said closing the door behind him. Charlie looked at him and whistled. "Damn Cas. Who are you trying to impress?" Cas was wearing a blue button down with his black leather jacket and a skinny white tie with ripped and worn black skinny jeans. His hair was gelled and had a messy look to it. "This could possibly be the biggest night ever for me. Damn right I'm gonna do it in style."
"I thought you didn't like surprises in your backdoor." Dean narrowed his eyes at Cas, finally winking at him and moving so he could come inside. Cas put his helmet on the side table and threw himself into the recliner. "So, now what?"
Cas was sitting out on the balcony of his small home setup, notebook on his lap. He looked up. The sun was setting. Painting the sky yellow, gold, and red. He smiled. Damn did it feel good to be making music again. He got up, opened the sliding glass door, and walked over to his guitar. He set the notebook on the
A few seconds later, he pushed himself off and was airborne. It was higher than jumping off a swing, but same basic concept. He landed on his feet but the force caused his legs to buckle and he hit the ground. "Dean! Are you okay?"
"To our secret hideout." He got up and changed his clothes, Cas did the same. "I have some money saved from my birthday and Christmas last year. That should get us plenty of food." He dumped the contents of his backpack on the floor and grabbed clothes from his dresser.
“No. Now where is Cas?” He growled.  His mind raced as he tried to remember, tried to look for Cas. He stood up, eyes looking to where he had last seen Cas.
That night, He tried to call Cas but he wasn't answering. He called Charlie. "Hey football star." She answered. She had been calling him that since the game that clinched their spot in the playoffs. He would have laughed if he wasn't worried. "Hey, have you talked to Cas at all today after school? He didn't show up to watch me practice like he usually does." There was a slight pause, already giving Dean his answer. His head fell back and he let out a silent sigh. "Actually, no. Which is weird because he always calls me after school." That's what he was afraid of. He really wished she said yes.
Cas braced for impact and forced a smile as he continued to walk toward his mother.”Yeah, it really has. Hi, mom.” She gathered Cas in a tight hug and rocked him back and forth.
He pushed his hips forward, grinding his growing erection against Dean. Dean moaned a little louder, making Cas hold back a smile.
His hand absently moved to the mark on his neck. Dean had marked him weeks ago, a few days after Alec had left. Both wanted it because neither wanted what happened to happen again.
A day on the boardwalk was just what they needed. They ate breakfast, looked at a few stores, then hit the amusement park. They played a few carnival games, Dean won a stuffed bear for Cas. Cas won a Doctor Who poster for Dean.
"Creeper that you love so, so much," Cas crooned. He kissed Dean. "I guess we should get up. It's my turn to see you off."
"You take turns answering questions about each other." Dean replied. Cas looked at him. "What? Charlie told me about it the other day."
"Don't. Don't you dare say you're sorry. Not you." He threw the bottle at the wall. It shattered, causing Dean to jump a little.
Satisfied, Dean stood up and went into the kitchen. He was about to start making breakfast when his phone rang. He quickly and quietly walked to the bedroom and answered. "Hey mom."
"Well, I was being held as a prisoner. Very few Alphas get that lucky. Honestly, I wished they would have killed me with the shit they did and made me do."
“You got it!” Cas called as he and the others walked out to their vehicles. In no time, they were loaded and rolling down the street towards Kansas City.
Dean poked at Cas' nose, to which Cas responded with a bitch face. "Probably. But now I know where you get your dramatic flare from." Cas rolled his eyes. "You have no idea." He smiled.
“That. Was. Awesome. Definitely gonna be working with her on that.” Dean and Cas hopped down from their saddles as Sammy walked up. “Hey, take the ponies back to the barn, will ya? I’ll be there in a few.” Sam sighed as he took the reins from the boys and led the horses to the barn.
Cas took the mic off the stand and walked over to the keyboard. "Okay, as you know, my name is Cas. This is my band Join The Hunt and we've been a band for a few years now." He sat down in front of the keyboard and put the mic on the stand. "So uh, there is an orchestra playing along with us for this song that I wrote about a week and a half ago. This song is called Ever After."
There was a collective "hmph" from both Novaks and they walked away. Dean fought the urge to flip them off. "Dicks" John muttered. Dean looked at him in surprise. "What? They are." Dean shook his head and smiled. John put his arm around Dean. "Come on son. Let's get you married."
Dean walked out, closing both doors behind him. The whole walk back to the cabin, he wanted nothing more than to just go back in that cabin and lay next to Cas.
“You didn't mark him bro, he's still fair game. Bet it felt good didn't it? Man I bet his little hole felt amazing. Damn I was so close to finding out too. Then I smelled you coming and jumped out a window.”
He felt Cas clinch down and his knot exploded, pumping wave after wave of come inside until it started leaking out. Dean shuttered a little as he felt the last of it fill Cas.
They had just gotten off the Ferris Wheel when Cas heard a very familiar voice and turned around, stopping dead in his tracks. "Dean..." Dean turned and followed Castiel's eyes. Adam, Cain, and Cole. Dean grabbed Cas by the hand and kept walking. How were they still running free? "They didn't see us. We're okay. We just need to get back to the car." Which was about a mile down the boardwalk sitting in the parking lot of the beach.
"Alright, I have the boys from Join The Hunt here promoting their debut album called 'Toy Soldiers' here next to me is front man Cas Novak. So Cas, how did you come up with the title 'Toy Soldiers'?"
“No, she isn't. Just us.” Dean nipped at the area between Cas’ neck and shoulder. A small moan slipped through Cas ’ lips. “No reason for either of us to hold back.” Dean rolled his hips against Cas’ as he finished his sentence, moving his hands down to the other man's ass and giving a squeeze. Cas felt his knees buckle and his eyes close.
"We just had the best set in the history of us and I have to leave? There are after parties screaming my name..."
They helped him out of the vehicle and set him in a wheelchair. "Go get the airborne Americans." A few minutes later he heard a familiar voice. "Holy shit! Winchester!" He looked up to see Adam walking towards him. He crouched to Dean's line of sight. "How the fuck are you alive?" He laughed in disbelief. Dean smiled. "Germans put a plate in my head. Go figure."
"Nope. Not telling." She pouted and resumed her business in her locker. He closed his messenger bag and looked at her. "Alright. I'll tell you one song." She perked up. "Can I guess?" He rolled his eyes and closed his locker. "Do I have a choice but to let you?" He asked. She closed her locker. Cas offered his arm and they walked arm and arm down the hall.
Cas threw a wad of cash down on the table, way more than the bill actually was, and the four headed out. They went to several stores, buying dress clothes, casual clothes, and everything in between. Dean snuck his way into an adult specialty store and picked up a few items. If the were going to Las Vegas, Dean wanted to make it an extra special time for both of them. He met the others outside of White House/Black Market. Charlie and Meg looked like they just had the best day ever and had bags overflowing with clothes and shoes.
That night they went to Dean's favorite burger joint. He was grateful to be in regular clothes after wearing a uniform for four months. He told them everything. About training, about the platoon and how they would get rowdy at times, about Adam. He heard the bell chime as someone walked in. He looked up to see a man with dark hair and gorgeous blue eyes. Dean's whole world seemed to stop. The man only ordered coffee and walked out. Dean grabbed his leather jacket and stood up. "Smoke break." He explained. Lightning his cigarette, he looked at the man who now had a map open. "Lost?" Dean asked. The man turned and Dean's breath caught. He was absolutely beautiful. "You could say that. I was just passing through and got turned around." Dean walked closer. The November air made his breath visible with a cloud. "Where ya headin?"
"Well, I think we'll hear more from Join The Hunt very, very soon. If you haven't watched the video that we made, and edited, and fucking posted today, I suggest you do that like, now. Because seriously, Cas and his posse are amazing!"
Dean looked up at Charlie. "Okay, guess we're going for a ride Ms film everything."  When they got to suicide drop, Charlie handed him another piece of paper. Dean read out loud.
Dean took another breath and very slowly pushed the tip inside Cas. He stopped, letting both of them get used to the feeling. He waited a few seconds then slowly pushed in a little more. Cas inhaled sharply through his teeth. Dean stopped. "You okay? Should we stop?" Suddenly internally panicking. "No, it's fine. It's just a bit uncomfortable. I don't want to stop."
"Okay... it seems we have covered everything that we set out to cover. Does anyone have anything else they'd like to add?"
"Adam, dude. It's not a fucking D cord you fucktard! It's a fucking G for Christ sake." He told Adam for the thousandth time.
Cas wrapped his arms around him, crying into his shoulder. "I can't. I don't want you to leave me again."
As soon as they were out, they headed right for the beach, breaking in to a dead sprint. They were tackled to the sand not even halfway.
“Right. Got it. Be right back.” He left the cavern and turned left. As soon as he was out of at least Sam's sight, he took off running. Going back the way they came. He could see that well, so he relied on his ears and his nose.
At first, it was really hard to believe that the Alphas could even be killed of considering they were mainly military, but one against many isn't really fair.
Jeff clapped his hands together. "Let's do this, fellas."The four gathered on the stairs and positioned themselves according to what the photographer asked.Dean laughed as Cas' overgrown hair kept falling in his face. Cas flipped him off. After a few hours of shooting, the photographer called it."We have so many great shots. I can't wait to show you all the finished product."
Dean moaned into Cas' mouth. "God Cas." He breathed. Cas smiled, watching as Dean's eyes slipped closed an bit his lip. He looked absolutely wrecked and Cas loved every second. He moved his hips and hand faster.
An two hours later, they touched down in LA. As they walked through the airport, a lot of people would stop Cas and asking for pictures or an autograph. Some even asked Dean for pictures. They met up with the band and walked out of the airport. Cas turned around and stopped the three. "First things first. I have a taxi taking you guys to my place because I have to jump right into shit at the studio. There's more than enough room for you guys. Well, Dean will obviously be sleeping in my bed but there's a spare room for you two."
Dean and Sam walked out of the clubhouse into the sunlight. The weather couldn't have been more perfect; blue skies, a few puffy clouds, sun shining. The ceremony began.
Charlie shook her head. “Get in here, asshat.” She pulled him into a hug, which he held a little longer than normal.
Dean shrugged. “Haven't really noticed. I was never really interested in finding a mate, especially after all this went down. I saw it as just another person I'd have to protect.”
"I don't want to be alone alright?!" The words came out in a half yell. They locked eyes. "Bad shit always happens when we're apart. Getting shot, Jaxon, overdosing..."
Half way through fifth period, Dean's phone vibrated in his pocket. He unlocked it. It was a text from Charlie.
The shuttle took them to a large building. Meg squealed. "Cas... this is the Bellagio.... how much did you spend?!"
He was walking home on the chilly spring night. He pulled the collar of his jacket up and walked down the dim lit path that he always took. Nobody really walked this way so he found the quiet calming. But tonight, someone else was walking the almost forgotten path. It wasn't completely out of the ordinary so he had no reason to believe otherwise. On this night, he was proven wrong. He heard the footsteps behind him quicken. He chalked it up as the person was in a hurry so he waited for the person to pass; They didn't. "Hey faggot." Suddenly he was pushed against the wall, brick scratching his face. He was turned around and slammed against the wall. His head hit with a sickening thud, dazing him. "So you think I'm in the closet?" He knew the voice: Wyatt. Dean had told a few friends about the comments and what he though about Wyatt. Someone must have told him. "I'll show you who's in the closet you freak." He punched Dean in the face. He fell sideways and hit the ground. Wyatt got on top of him and punched him a few more times. He felt his pants and boxers being pulled off. He heard a belt coming undone, a zipper, the metal of the belt hitting the cement. Then the near blinding pain off Wyatt's dick being shoved in his ass. He yelled out. Wyatt covered his mouth. Dean bit his hand, the taste of blood in his mouth. Wyatt put his fingers around Dean's throat and squeezed, cutting off his air. He trashed around. Moving his hands to Wyatt's fingers, trying desperately to break the hold. he laid there useless while Wyatt thrust in him again and again.  He loosened his grip on Dean's neck and he gasped for air as Wyatt finished inside him.
"Yes!" Cas ran up to Dean's room and got Charlie on the line. Then he called Adam. Dean had made his way to his room and was standing in the doorway. "All good?"
Cas looked at Dean. "You sure this is real? Because Josh Ramsay just invited us to a new year's party." Dean sat up, straddling Cas. "For serious?! Dude, yes! We're going! I've decided for you. Gonna call Charlie..." Dean lept of of Cas, nearly tripping himself on his own feet as he ran for his phone.
"Well, how was my first time? Did I take you all the way?" The crowd responded with more screaming. He heard one girl yell out. "Fuck me, Cas!"
“If you're gonna do something, do it quick because the little guy's about to go into heat.” Alec said, taking a bite of bacon.
It was around midnight when Dean took Cas home. "Oh, Cas, Charlie came by. She wanted to give you your birthday present early." With everything that had been going on, Cas forgot it was now his birthday. "I think there's something for Dean too."
He's been looking for his damn lighter for twenty minutes now. He just stole a pack from Walmart, so why can't he find a single one? He swears sometimes they just grow legs.
"With pleasure," Cas said, almost in a whisper. He repeated the motion, nailing Dean's prostate again, harder this time. Dean moaned again, almost falling off.
Cas felt the first finger go in and tensed up for a second, telling himself to relax. The last time Cas was on the receiving end without being drugged was sophomore year. Even then, he never really allowed himself to enjoy it. But tonight, with Dean, everything was just so distant. Like nothing else mattered or existed. Only Dean. For that, he was thankful.
The video went from the picture to an old home movie where Dean and Cas were one year old. "There's Dean with his new friend Castiel." Mary said. The camera zoomed in on the two. The song the way you are by Bruno Mars began to play. The video went to another picture of Dean and Cas on Dean's third birthday then to a video of Cas chasing Dean with a foam sword. Both boys laughing and yelling as they ran through the house.
After a few seconds, she put the stethoscope back around her neck. "Sounds like you have Arrhythmia."
Dean looked up. Cas was out of sight. He fought the urge to run after the car. Instead, he ran inside the house and up to his room. He landed on his bed and buried his face in the pillow. He never cried, but he couldn't stop himself this time. There was a knock. "Son?" John's voice came from the other side. "Go away!" Dean yelled.
"I'm glad you're enjoying yourself babe." A lady with a headset on poked her head in the door. "Josh, five minutes til show time."
"Maybe once or twice this morning, but that could be because I'm really good with my hands." Dean rolled his eyes.
Gabriel put a reassuring hand on Cas' shoulder before standing up and continuing his questions. After Cas answered them all, both Gabriel and the Beta left. Cas just stayed curled up in the corner, staring at the door. Would anyone from camp come rescue him? Or would they just leave him to his fate? His head fell back to the wall. He closed his eyes, willing the thoughts of his fate to go away to no avail. He was probably going to die here.
"Might as well get used to it guys. As long as we're all together, stupid shit will happen." He poured himself acup of coffee. Cas' phone buzzed in his pocket. It was a text from Dean."It's ok, I'll forgive you this time. Text me later when you can. I love you :)"
They walked in silence a lot of the day, taking small breaks to rest so they could cover as much ground as possible. It wasn't until the sun went down that they actually stopped to eat some of the food Castiel had packed. It wasn't much, just some fruit and protein bars, enough to last them.
Later that night, Dean and Cas were in Dean's cabin, sitting on the bed playing Go Fish. It did take Dean a little while to calm down, but everything was back to normal when he did.
Dean and Cas enjoyed the quite morning. Cas found Dean's camera and took a few pictures. Dean had turned the tables by taking the camera and snapping a few himself. The last two weeks had been like a dream to Dean. They laughed and told stories. Had Sam and Jess over for dinner. Even braved a venture to Dean favorite diner. Dean would read the newspaper, telling Cas that Japan just might leave the U.S. out of the war and had talks of peace with F.D.R. not knowing what was really going to happen.
"Alright everyone, I'd like you to welcome Dean Winchester." Everyone looked at him. He looked at this feet.
Cas played with his lebret piercing for a moment as Meg filtered through the sea of teenagers to get to the kitchen. It didn't take her long to return with two red Solo cups full of alcohol. He gladly took the cup, taking a few gulps before looking around.
Cas opened the can and took a drink. "I'm okay with that." He moved to the living room. "Okay, let me watch the music video." "Oh my gosh it is so good!" Charlie beamed.
Charlie and Meg opened their room and went in. "Holy shit!" Cas laughed at the girls' reaction. "That good, huh?" Dean asked. "Just wait. Ours is better." Cas took Dean's hand and lead him down the hall, almost to the end. He stopped in front of a heavy oak door. "I hope you're wearing extra underwear, because you're about to crap yourself."
When the open mic started, they sat and watched a few of them. One kid was actually pretty good, singing an acoustic version of Push by Marianas Trench. The barista stood in front of the mic.
Suddenly, Cas hugged Dean, burying his face into Dean's shoulder. "I don't want to go Dean." Dean squeezed his eyes shut. "You have to Cas." He opened his eyes and pulled away. "I'll be here when you come back. Just pretend it's a really long vacation." He knew he was trying to convince both of them. Cas' mom got in the car. Cas slowly slid himself in the back seat. "I'll miss you Dean Winchester." Dean smiled. "I'll miss you to Cas Novak." He closed the door.
"Not unless you have a time machine. When it was happening, all I could do was stand there. I didn't do a damn thing. I just...I feel like I could have done something."
Dean had his arm around Cas as they looked at their work. "We should get going. Don't want to get caught trespassing" Cas said. Dean nodded. "My dorm is nearby and it's only me in there."
"Yeah, yeah, keep your panties on. I'm coming." He gave one last glance at Cas, who had his back to him. "Fuck." Dean lightly punched the wall of the building as he walked toward the others. He didn't know he was being watched. Charlie watched Dean join the group. Her felt her face fall slightly. "He still loves Cas," she thought to herself. She grinned.
"This is nonsense. You are getting on the first plane back to Los Angeles and taking your company back."
They just laid there for awhile. Cas broke the silence. "Hey, we have a photo shoot for the album today. Wanna go?"
Cas shook his head. "Umm.. accident what do you mean accident? She's fine. Right? She's fine. Probably great. Probably just a minor thing..."
He paced the waiting room. He only went outside to smoke a cigarette. He wanted to be there when the doctor came in. and after what seemed like days, he did. Everyone had fallen asleep except for him so he woke them up. Cas held his breath. "Dean sustained quite a few horrible injuries. Quite frankly I'm amazed he didn't die instantly from the stab wound. or the hits to the plate in his head." Cas cut him off. "Just please tell us if he's alive." The doctor looked at him. "He is. Alive and stable for the moment. And surprisingly awake. He's been asking for you for two hours now." He gave him Dean's room number. Cas took off running down the hall. He found Dean's room and stopped. He held his breath as he opened the door. Dean was lying there in the dim lit room. He turned his head and smiled. Tears streaked down Cas' face. "You just gonna stand there with your mouth open? Or are you gonna get you ass over here and kiss me?" Cas ran to him and gently put his arms around him. Dean put his hands on Cas' face and kissed him. "I'm sorry." He breathed into Cas lips. Cas looked at him. "For what?"
One. Cas took over Dean's mouth and explored the interior with his tongue. Dean groaned and pulled Cas in as close as he could, rolling his hips against Cas'.Cas pulled away slightly.
Dean let out a breath. "Well, it wasn't pretty. At first it was just normal grieving ya know, lookin’ at pictures, drinking, that sort of shit. Then, I dunno, I just...snapped. Nightmares every night so I only slept for a few hours. Tearing up the house. I was only sober a few times. Got into it with Benny a few times, he's pretty much the only one that can take me anyway. I wrecked the car one night, comin’ home from the pool hall. Wrapped it around a tree about a mile away."
Dean took Cas by the hand. "Let's go back to my place so you can cool off. We'll figure something out. "
Meg hopped up from the stool she was on. "This round's' on me. Charlie, Benny, Adam... help me carry it back." The three headed off toward the busy bar, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
"Thanks Cas. I gotta go, my running back Jaxon it practically dragging me out the door to celebrate with the team."
"Thanks. It's a promise ring from Dean." Cas smiled at her. "Told you. He's over the moon for you. Now let's get a move on. You have to make that speech."
"Oh my God. At least do smooth criminal or dirty diana. At least those will shut both of them up." He lifted his head and looked at Dean. "It's not adorable. I was ten and totally fucking rocked it thank you very much." He took a bite of his bacon.
They walked into the main office. "Can I help you boys?" The secretary asked. "Yeah, I need to ask Mr Surley something. It's for a project in tv production."
He grabbed a pair of kaki cargo pants out of his dresser and moved to his closet, finally settling on a black long sleeve Nirvana shirt.
Three weeks. Three weeks with absolutely no change whatsoever. Doctor Mills told Dean that Cas was fighting very hard. Dean knew he was fighting with everything he had. That was Cas for you. They had to have Naomi's funeral without him, and Dean knew Cas would be upset about that, but there was nothing
Without thinking, he grabbed Dean's hand and they headed into the woods. A few minutes later, Cas found what he was looking for. An abandoned cabin he and Meg used to hang out in when they were kids.
Stepping out of the shower, he threw on a towel and walked back to his room, throwing himself on the bed face first. He reached for his phone on the table next to the bed. The email notification was up, and it was from Charlie, a video. He opened it and let it play. Dean smiled and felt instantly happy when he saw his husband, sitting on the bed doing what he did best; write music. Dean had always thought it was adorable how Cas would chew his pencil while he thought. As
Cas felt a pool cue poke him in the side as he lined up to shoot. "Really Dean?" Dean just flashed him a smile. "You gonna make your shot princess?" Cas let out a sigh. "Don't ever call me that again." Dean puts his hands in the air. "My bad. Won't happen again, princess." Everyone laughed. Cas just shook his head, finally making his shot and sinking a ball in the far corner pocket. Dean nodded in approval of Cas' shot. "Got my work cut out for me." Castiel smiled. "Yeah, just like when we were eighteen." He sank another shot, looked up at Dean and wagged his eyebrows, sticking his tongue out slightly.
He had already packed his bags to go home for the holiday. He was excited because he hadn't seen his family since the Christmas holiday. Tonight, he was helping Meg pack. She was going to New York with some friends. "I wish you could come. You'd love New York." Dean smiled as he folded one of her shirts and set it in her suitcase. "Yeah, well, maybe I'll meet you there. I just want to see my brother first." Meg teased if he did go, he should get laid and lose his virginity to a hot guy. Dean just shook his head and explained he was old fashioned and he wanted to wait.
Cas heard gunfire and flashes of light, then saw the silhouettes of the Betas drop to the ground, yelling in pain. All the Omegas just stood there, unsure of what to do, including Cas. His mind then kicked into action. He pushed himself to the front of the group.
"When do I ever keep it clean?" Cas asked, a crooked smile on his face.Dean sighed. "Never." He gave Cas a quick kiss on the cheek.
Dean put the beer to his lips and looked forward. Black smoke was rising not too far out. The barn. "Shit!" He dropped the bottle. "Call the fire department! The fucking barn is on fire!" He yelled through the door before running off the deck. The others were right behind him.
He stared at the sky. He hadn't felt this much pain in his life. His brain said "run, Castiel" but his heart, his gut, said stay. He looked at the ring again and smiled a little. "Dean wouldn't have bought this thing if he didn't care," he said out loud to himself. Charlie was right. Dean stayed through the drugs, near death, and more. And today he gave him a ring. Cas fell onto his back and stared.
Cas and the others followed Dean inside the house and went into the kitchen. "Hey ma." Dean said as he grabbed sodas and handed them out. "How was school y'all?" Mary asked from the stove. "Dean finally passed a physics test." Cas smiled. Dean rolled his eyes. "Please. I get B's buddy."
"But unfortunately we can't leave our guests so I guess I'll just have to try to behave." Cas smiled.
"No thanks. I’ve got my big boy pants on and I’m not going back there. I'll just stay here with Dean."
He really had no idea where he was going, he just knew they had to keep moving. He could smell many different Alphas, so he headed in that direction, praying they were the good guys.
Cas was dancing as he made his way down the hall and playing his guitar. When the words "four to go" were sang, he was pulled out of the frame by his tie.
He was upstairs all of fifteen minutes. Whatever that drink was, it hit him fast. Maybe he shouldn't have drank it so fast. It wasn't long until he and another boy stumbled into a dark room, tearing at each others' clothes. He couldn't make out a face, not that he cared since it's been weeks since he's gotten laid.
For now, he was just gonna act like nothing was wrong and basically bury himself with work until he decided what to do. Stupid? Probably. Should he just call Dean? Yes. Was he going to? Fuck no. Why? He didn't even know the answer to that. Instead, he was gonna drive to the airport, get on a plane, go back to LA, and go on tour. Ignoring his problems instead of facing them...as usual.
He sounded as nervous as Dean felt. He moved up to Cas, jaw, then his lips. He inhaled deeply, taking in Cas' sent. He smelled like soap and green apple shampoo. He lowered himself more until their bare chests were touching. The feel of Cas' smooth damp skin on his sent his mind into overdrive, forgetting how nervous he was, forgetting that anything else exsisted. He ran a hand down Cas' ribs to the towel around his waist. He didn't want to get ahead of himself. Cas' lips parted and Dean seized the opportunity. Pushing his tongue past Cas' lips and brushing it over the roof of his mouth. Their tongues danced around each other.
Dean took another sip of his coffee. "Are you two being safe?" Mary asked. Dean choked on his coffee. "Really mom?" He choked out. Sam laughed. "Shut up Sammy." He shot with a sideways glance. Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. Cas shifted in his seat. "We aren't having sex mom." His face turning red. "Can we change the subject please?"
Cas smiled and put his phone back in his pocket. He drained his coffee then it was off to the label.   "You boys have made a little noise in the last few months and I must say, the public loves it. At first we were a little hesitant because of all the other bands in the same category as you including Marianas Trench, but it seems you've let your music do the talking for you." The label owner held up their demo.
"Dean Winchester." Their classmates cheered and clapped as Dean went uo to the stage. A picture of a five year old Dean holding a football was on the screen, which changed to a picture of him walking off the field with his helmet in his hand. Smiling his famous, million dollar smile.
He made his way across the hall to the bathroom that he used to share with his older brother, Michael, before he went off to college and is now studying abroad in England. Part of him held resentment for his brother, the other part was envious that he got out.
“Well, he was the first one that came up with it that's for sure. Word spread quietly through the nation and now there's one in every state, supplied by allies on the outside.”
There were a few days left of spring break. Dean and Cas were walking around downtown looking at all the little shops. "This place hasn't changed one bit." Said Cas. Dean had his hands in his pocket, smiling at Cas. "You're quite tonight Dean. Is something wrong?" A note of concern in his voice. Dean shook his head. He took one hand from his pocket and pulled Cas closer, kissing his lips. "No babe, everything's perfect." He took Cas' hand and they continued walking, soon finding themselves at the elementary school they went to. Dean looked at Cas and smiled. "Race you."
“Good call.” Cas slowly pulled the beads out, rinsing them off before turning the shower off. He pulled the curtain open and shook the water out of his hair. Dean ran a towel through his and dried quickly, handing it to Cas he bent down and picked up the box. Cas ran the towel over himself quickly and followed Dean. As soon as Dean opened his bedroom door, Cas grabbed the box and set it on the nearest waist level place, grabbed Dean's wrists and pulled him into a kiss. “Cas” Dean breathed between kisses.
Dean barely left the house the last two weeks. Mack did as he was told and kept his mouth shut. Nobody knew. Except John. Sam figured it out and swore he wouldn't tell. He ended up telling Jess. Jo said she figured it out in middle school when Dean refused to kiss her on a dare. Ellen knew through Jo. Bobby knew because Dean told him about the college party the next day. Nobody told anyone outside of the family. Nobody told John. Dean hated the way his dad found out. John didn't talk to him after that.
A few awards and two performances later, it was time to give the award for best music video. Cas was holding his breath.
"You don't know that." Dean pulled the car over, leaning over and looking Cas in the eye. "I do know that. I know that I love you, more than anything, and that nothing is going to change how I feel. Ever. We'll make it work."
Dean broke the kiss and dropped his head. "Damn." Cas kissed Dean on the forehead. "Food first, remember?"
"Well, I woke up, head bleeding and my leg was shattered. My phone was cracked but it worked. So I called Benny and told him not to tell the others yet. The last thing I needed was Charlie and Meg getting all motherly on me."
Cas took his guitar off and set it down on it's stand. He made sure he was last out of the booth. Dean was waiting for him.
"Not yet. We're going out there like a week after graduation so they can hear the new demo. Then if they like us, we get a contract." Charlie hugged him. "I'm so proud of you, Cas. You guys deserve this." Dean walked up as Charlie and Cas were hugging. "It's a good thing I know you prefer dick or I'd be worried." Cas flipped a middle finger at Dean, followed with a huge smile.
"Yeah. Just overstimulated. He'll be alright soon as he gets used to it." Cas went back to cleaning and inspecting RJs hooves.
"Night Charlie." Dean looked down. Cas' head was on his lap and he was curled up in the seat. He smiled as he pulled up to Cas' house. He slowly moved Cas so he could get out. He went around to the other side and opened the door. He leaned in and put his arms under Cas and pulled him out of the Impala. Cas shifted in his arms a little asound to the other side and opened the door. Dean opened the front door. Mystic raised her head and growled. "Easy psycho dog."
Cas' phone buzzed on the nightstand. Charlie had text him saying he was breaking the internet. He sat up. He almost forgot about last night, thinking itwas a dream. "Cas?" Dean's sleepy voice came from behind him. He sat up. "When did you get here?" "I've been here all night. Your mom suggested I stay after I carried your ass to bed. You're heavier than you look." "Awww you're so sweet. You could have woke me up."
But him? He was stuck here. Forced to live with a father who doesn't want him and a mother who drink to stay oblivious. He doesn't know if he could stand two more years. His junior year just started and everything has gotten worse since his brother left. He begged his brother to take him along, but Michael couldn't. The look on his face told him it killed Michael to leave him behind.
“All this started happening not to long after Alec and Dean got out of boot camp. Alec went into the Marines, Dean went into Army special forces. They were eighteen when all this went down.”
"Hey yeah!"  They all stopped and started laughing. "We're totally doing a video here." From behind them came a high pitched voice. "Happy birthday, Mr President."Cas, Adam and Benny whipped around to see Jeff up on a staircase.
"Just listen. You are the sole reason I'm alive. I should have died a long time ago in Germany, but I didn't. Because of you. I could hear your voice. See your face. But now it feels like I'm back just to say goodbye."
“We’re in a barn, babe. Yes. They’re reins. I didn’t think the rope in here was going to work. Too rough. Now stop talking.” Dean leaned back again and closed his eyes, clearing his head.
Cas rolled his eyes at the ceiling. Of course he would rather be doing other things. Like tying Dean's hands to a pole in the barn and working him up until he was basically a puddle on the floor. But instead, he was stuck in a large room sitting at a table with numerous colleges and lawyers about to make bank. He started texting again.
"Just please, take me to Naomi. We can work this out. We can be a family!" Cas narrowed his eyes. "No. Shooting me won't win you any brownie points either." He took his hands out of his pockets. "I got clean! For you two!"
Cas' eyes flicked up to Dean, then back to the floor. "About two weeks after I got here, six years ago."
Dean was standing in front of his locker. He had been in this locker room for the fourth time. Some people called him the golden boy because he has yet to lose a game. He was still nervous as hell, he was always nervous before a game. He took a deep breath and put on his long sleeve black Underarmor shirt then his shoulder pads. He grabbed his maroon away jersey and pulled it over his head and pads. "Alright guys, gather 'round!" The coach called. Dean grabbed his helmet then took a knee in front of the coach. "I'm going to do something different this year." They all looked at him. "I think it's only fitting that the senior captain give the speech this year since this is the last high school playoff he'll be in. Dean?" Dean stood up and faced the team, clearing his throat. "Right, uh, for some of us, this is our last year. And I know you juniors think you have big shoes to fill next year but you really don't. As far as this weekend goes, don't pressure yourselves into thinking you have to win just because we came in undefeated. Don't get cocky either, then you'll lose. Even then, it doesn't matter. As long as you do your best, love the game, and play your heart out, you've already one. So what do you say we go out there, have some fun, and kick it in the ass!" The team yelled. "Are we gonna kick it in the ass?" He yelled over them. They all yelled in unison, getting to their feet. "All right then! Let's do this!" They all ran out into a single file line. Dean went after all the players, but before the coaches. They stood in the hall, waiting to be introduced. Some of the guys were jumping up and down, getting ready. Dean just stood there and closed his eyes, mentally preparing himself like he always did. "Praying to the football Gods golden boy?" Benny hit his pads and Dean opened his eyes. "How else do you think we've been undefeated?" He smiled. The Blue Vally Tigers were introduced first. They were had eight wins and two losses. "And now the Lawrence Lions!" The crowd cheered as the ran on to the field.
Dean smiled as he watched Cas finish playing. He was as natural as Cas gets, which was Dean's favorite. When he was done, Cas started to turn around. Dean moved so he was standing in the doorway. Cas took his guitar off and looked up. He smiled a huge smile.
Dean stepped inside. "SURPRISE!" Dean damn near jumped out of his skin. He looked around to see his family and close friends all standing in the living room. There was a banner that read "Happy Birthday Dean" hanging from the ceiling. "Christ you guys! You almost gave me a heart attack!" Everyone laughed. "My birthday isn't for a few weeks though."
Dean felt something warm and wet trail down his groin and thigh.  Cas was close. Painfully close by the look on the other man's face. He grabbed Cas' legs and pushed them down as far as they would go, allowing Dean to go deeper. He paused and looked at the sight in front of him; Cas’ dark hair was a mess, his cheeks flushed, hands above his head and gripping the headboard for dear life. Dean smiled.
Hey peoples!!! I'm sorry I haven't updated this in a few months!!! I've been really busy with going to class for my G.E.D. then I got blocked!!! So with out further ado, chapter four!!!
Everyone stood up and started saying their goodbyes. Naomi was in tears naturally. Cas hugged her and kissed her on the forehead. Charlie got a quick picture of Dean and Cas showing of their shirts. Then Dean walked Cas as close to the gate as he could. "If I get a tour date anywhere close to Huston, I'll stop by." Cas smiled. Dean smiled back. "I'm sure we'll Skype and call and text between then."
"I didn't get in my car and take off, so I like to think of it as taking a walk." Cas shrugged and looked up at the stars. Dean dismounted Pandora and walked over to Cas.
"A member of Dean's unit refused to leave him behind. After they pushed back the Germans, they went back for Dean but he was gone. You should know, when they left him, he was alive. We think he's now a prisoner of war and he's been classified as missing in action. We'll find your brother and bring him home." Nobody said anything after he left. Cas slid down the wall and sat on the floor. He couldn't move or think. Dean was missing and half dead.
"You go." Charlie said. Dean looked at her. She half smiled then nodded. The doctor was already walking down the hall. Dean followed. The doctor pushed a button and the door opened. Dean continued to follow him. "Has he ever done drugs before?" Dean looked at him. "Why is everyone asking me that?" They both stopped. Dean was almost as tall as this man standing at five foot ten. "Because the toxicology report showed heroin in his system. He was high when he wrecked." Dean's heart stopped. There it was. His suspicions were confirmed. They drugged him for their own sick purpose. Again. But Cas left. He got away. This told Dean that Cas has had enough. He wanted out, he wanted to be free from them. "You don't have to answer right now." The doctor's words snapped Dean from his thoughts. They continued walking. They rounded a corner and stopped in front of a door. There was a name on it.
He wanted to get every little detail. From Cas hair to his solid black socks. The room was silent except for Dean's pencil gliding across the paper and both of them breathing. If Dean listened close enough, he could almost hear Cas' heart beating. Every minute or so, he would flick his eyes up to Cas then back down to the paper.
Dean walked to the barn and fed the horses, brushing them briefly before grabbing his tools and getting in the old farm truck. He drove out to the broken fences on the western border of the ranch.
"You're up early." Dean said sitting next to him. Cas took a sip of his coffee. "Bad dream." He said. Dean looked at him.
Cas shook his head. "Turns out, she's been looking for me this whole time but could find me since my records from the foster home mysteriously disappeared after Rob and Julie took me." He scratched the back of his head and waled over to Dean. "Nice pass by the way. Very riveting stuff." Dean scoffed and stood up, stomping his shoe on the rest of the way. "Yeah, if only I was upright to see it." Cas flashed a smile. "Oh you won't be upright for long Winchester. We have some celebrating to do."
Dean opened his eyes and looked at his friend for a second before sitting up and getting out of bed.
He unlocked the door and stepped inside, hanging the keys on the hook. He took off his shoes and walked into the living room then collapsed on the couch. He made sure the volume on his phone was turned up all the way in case Charlie or Ellen called then put his arm over his face, falling asleep in seconds.
Dean woke up a few hours before the sun. He rolled over to see Cas sprawled out across his half of the bed, his face smushed into the pillow. His mouth was open and he was snoring lightly. Two months ago, Dean thought he would never see this sight again, that all he'd have left were memories and pictures.
"I don't really have one. I had a lot of fun with all of them. Especially the ones nobody has heard yet like Toy Soldiers, No Place like home, and While We're Young."
Then a picture of them at the age of ten sitting on the swings. Both of them were laughing at a joke Dean had told. Cas looked like he was about to fall of the swing in laughter. Then a video of them walking down the street arm in arm. Dean looked back at the camera, tapped cas' shoulder, whispered something, then both boys took off running.
"Look at me." Dean whispered harshly at Cas. He wanted nothing more than to just let himself loose on Cas, but he was going to savor it as long as he could. Cas opened his eyes again and looked at Dean, smiling when he saw that his partner was just as wrecked as he was. Dean kept his eyes on the blue ones in front of him. He reached down and took his own hard cock in his hand and swiped the fluid that had leaked from the tip, lubing himself with it and then Cas' entrance. Dean then guided himself toward Cas, stopping just when he hit the skin. He bit his lip, then pushed in slowly. Cas' eyes fluttered shut and his head dropped back to the pillow. Dean took his time pushing himself in Cas. Cas bit his lip to stifle a moan.
Dean laughed. "Definitely the sex." He poured them each a shot and raised his up. Cas picked up his and did the same. Dean winked at his partner.
It didn't take him long to eat the whole burger. Dean just watched Cas as he ate. "Slow down, it's not going anywhere."
Dean pulled back and looked at Cas, not knowing if he should be slightly worried about what might be in store for him or if he should just whisk his clothes off because this was pretty damned hot. Cas decided for him.
“... There is just no reason a handsome and successful man like you should still be single. I mean, I want grandchildren…”
Yet another shot made its way into Cas' hand. Dean looked at him. "Hey, can I see that?" Cas slowly handed handed it to Dean. Dean downed the shot and set the empty glass on the table. He looked at everyone. "Seriously guys. No more. Y'all can do whatever, but I'm taking him home." Charlie laughed. "Cas is getting some bow-chicka-wow-wow!" She giggled. Cas gave a goofy laugh and leaned on Dean, eyes half closed. "Yeah...no." Dean said.
"That would be pretty awesome." Cas put his arm around Dean. "Alright, football star. Let's head back to the house. You need to sleep so you can catch that plane in the morning."
Dean looked up again. They may not have the same class, but they were in the same hall. There was one boys bathroom in each hall. He got up and grabbed the hall pass for the bathroom and walked out. He walked towards the bathroom, mind racing. He really didn't want to fight with Cas, but he needed to know what was going on with him. He pushed open the door to see Cas leaving a stall. "Cas." Cas jumped, something fell from his hand and hit the marble floor. Dean saw what it was before Cas picked it up. "Are you fucking kidding me right now?" He locked the door and walked over to Cas and pushed him against the stall. "Are you crazy or just plain stupid? I really want to know. What the hell are you doing drugs for?! In school!" Cas looked at him. "Keep it down Winchester or you'll get us suspended." He said calmly.
Then it was time to open presents. John and Mary got Dean a book of famous artists. Sam got him a necklace that is said to be very special. Cas' other present was "History of Art" He loved all of his gifts. Sam and Dean worked together to make a collage of them through the years for John and Mary. Sam got Jess a cute sweater. Jess got Sam a watch. Dean handed Cas his present. When Cas opened it, his eyes widened. "Oh my God!" He took it out of the box. It was a framed drawing. A collage drawing of them as kids. "That took me a long time to draw. I wanted go give it to you if I ever saw you again. I started it when I was seventeen. I finished it the other day." Cas looked at him. Everyone gathered to see it. "It's beautiful Dean." Mary smiled.
"You just got out of the hospital after wrecking it and you're riding with a broken leg? Do I need to slap you silly boy?"
Killing the Alphas was just a way for the Betas to keep control. The first killings were thought to be serial killers, but then, after a while a large group of Betas stepped forward after a Beta became president when the last was assassinated in his own home.
Cas ran his tongue from base to tip, flicking again at the slit. Dean arched his back and lifted his hips as a moan escaped his lips. Dean's hips were moving in rhythm with Cas. Suddenly, Dean wrapped his legs around Cas, who removed his mouth long enough to speak. "Oh yeah...." Cas was interrupted by Dean flipping him to his back. An evil grin crossed Cas' face.
When the song ended and everyone started dancing again, Cas grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him out of the ballroom.
Dean straightened and pushed just a little more in to that cluster of nerves, moving his hips just the tiniest bit faster. Cas squeezed his eyes shut and made a noise between a gasp and a moan. This was all so new to him. Every movement, every feeling, but all of it Dean. All of it because of Dean, and it wasn't just the sex. Everything emotion Cas felt with Dean was new. And Dean didn't want to just fuck his brains out. Cas knew Dean wanted him to enjoy the receiving end for a change.
Dean tightened his grip on Cas' hand and they took off running through the sea of people. The only problem was, they needed to circle around because there was only one way out. They cut through the middle of the fairway and ran for the exit, pushing past and through the crowd. The three were close behind. If they could just make it to the beach...
He walked down the hall. "Adam's room, Benny's room, Jeff's room..." He pushed open a door. "My room. California Queen bed, giant fucking wall of glass with a sliding door that leads to my own balcony. I get my own bathroom, but check this shit out." He walked over to the bed and grabbed a remote. "Don't want the neighbors seeing you butt ass naked in the morning?" He hit a button and the windows tinted. "No fucking problem. You can see them, but they can't see you! Who needs blinds when you have magic windows?"
“Dad, I don’t know what you…” Zachariah pinned Cas’ other arm to the door, making it impossible to move.
The song changed again. Cas walked out on stage, mic in hand. He walked over to the piano and sat down.
Cas was getting quite a few looks around town now too. Parents of young kids would usher their child away from Cas like he was contagious. The whole situation was starting to get on his nerves. He was debating just scrapping the whole idea and just do something else. Cas flopped down on his bed face first and lay there.
"Aw, that's because you've never had a relationship like this before. Your first love. So cute!" Cas threw a marshmallow at her. "Shut up. You asking Meg?"  "
Cas remained still until the paramedics arrived. Dean and Charlie backed up and let them through. Charlie had her hand over her mouth, crying. Dean put his arm around her. "It's okay. He'll be okay." Not sure if he was trying to convince her or himself. Two firefighters slowly moved the bike off of Cas as one paramedic was asking Cas questions to keep him conscious. "What's your name honey?" She asked, holding his head. Cas moved his eyes to her. "Castiel Novak. Cas for short."
They ate lunch at a burger joint then headed to the theater. "What do you want to see?" Dean asked, lacing his fingers in Cas'. "How about that new comedy?" Dean pushed his lips out in thought. "Yeah, sure." He agreed.
"Trader." Dean looked at Sam who's smile grew. "At least it's not a stranger." Cas told him. Dean smiled at him. When Sam came back, he set the album on the coffee table. Mary grabbed it and took Sam's place next to Dean. "And we're off." She opened it and set it on Dean's lap. The first picture was Dean and Cas at the age of one. They were on the floor and Dean was crawling after Cas.
The next morning Dean was sitting on the couch watching the news. Cas was making breakfast. They both knew it was a matter of time before Dean was shipped off. The loud knock on the door confirmed it. Dean looked at Cas and got up. Opening the door to see a man in uniform. Cas' heart dropped. "Private First Class Winchester. Your orders. You are to report in at o500." He handed Dean a thick envelope. Dean took it. Even though Dean was out of uniform, he saluted. "Understood sir." He closed the door. Cas was frozen in his place. Dean opened the envelope and read it. He dropped the contents after reading them and looked up at Cas. "I have to be there first thing in the morning. They want me to leave tonight." Cas walked around the counter over to Dean.
"I love you too, babe. Now put your pants back on." They walked back into the ballroom. Charlie saw them and rolled her eyes. "Not even here for an hour." She shook her head and smiled. Cas shrugged. "Aren't you supposed to have sex on prom night?"
"Me too. Your family nice?" Cas just shrugged and moved his tray closer as Charlie went in for another fry.
Back in the room, he set the water and pills on the nightstand then unbuttoned Cas shirt. Cas pulled Dean close and kissed him. Dean broke the kiss. "Cas...we're not doing this right now. I'm not gonna take advantage of my drunk ex."
I know I know, it's been awhile! We've been super busy with a different story and I (Destiels_Celebrity_Status) kept forgetting to update! Sorry 'bout that!
Cas sat back and continued to watch the band set up. A few minutes later, the waitress brought out a bottle of Jack Daniels and two shot glasses. Cas looked at the bottle then to Dean. "Remember drinking this at suicide drop?"
"And apparently we're doing a boyfriend tag. I'm doing this under duress just so everyone knows." Dean rolled his eyes. "And as soon as this fucking snow goes away, I'm going to kill my best friend and claim temporary insanity." Dean looked at the camera and shook his head. "No he won't. He loves her too much." Cas rolled his eyes. "Okay, first question. How did we meet?"
Cas positioned himself over Dean and kissed him on the mouth. Dean started to deepen the kiss and was really getting into it when Cas pulled away. Dean was only disappointed for a second when he felt teeth pull at his earlobe, and then nipping at his neck. His toes tingled and he arched his back a little. Cas smiled into Dean’s neck and kept going, moving down his chest and stomach to the waist of his jeans. Dean lifted his hips, realizing only then how hard he was. Those jeans were not his friend at the moment.
"And you should be done too. You can't even talk." Meg just smiled a wasted smile at Dean. Damn, she was possible farther gone than Cas.
The band had started up again, this time with a solid bass beat. Dean pulled back and listened for a moment.
Dean walked to the stage and Charlie handed him a folded piece of paper. "Open it and read it out loud."
He walked over to the shower and turned it on. Dean looked at him through raised eyebrows. Cas rolled his eyes and almost pushed Dean in.
There wasn’t much more than a bed and a bathroom, which was more than enough for a one night stand. He cradled Anna’s face in has hands and looked at her for a moment before taking over her mouth. Anna returned his kiss, moving her hands under his shirt and working it over his head.
"Oh honey, no." Ellen wrapped him in a hug. Dean lost it. His body shook with sobs. "It's not your fault honey."
The interview went on longer than expected. When Dean walked out of the office, Sam stood up. Dean stopped in front of him. "June. I leave for training in June. I'll come back in around mid November. Then I wait for my orders. If I make it through training." Sam smiled. "You'll make it. Dad did." Their dad was a WWI veteran. He didn't talk much about the war. Hell, he didn't talk much at all after he got home.
Both boys were now laying down on the dusty floor, staring at the wooden ceiling. Dean was fully clothed, Cas left his shirt off.
Sam practically begged Dean to start eating. He did kinda miss eating. When Sam left, a little while later Castiel came in at the start of his shift. Dean was, as usual, looking out the window. This time he was standing in front of it rather than sitting on his bed. "I see you finally got out of your bed. I'll take that as a good thing." Dean heard a paper bag. "I had to sneak this in for you. It's from Sam." Dean turned around and looked at Castiel. He pulled the contents from the bag. "He said it's from your favorite place." It was a burger, fries, and a slice of pie. Dean looked at the food as Castiel set it on the table next to the bed. Dean looked up at him. "I won't tell if you won't" Castiel told him, smiling. He turned and walked out, closing the door behind him. Dean ate all of it.
Cas swung he leg over his motorcycle and pulled out his phone to check the time. Just after five in the morning. He bought new clothes hours ago just so he wasn't wearing the outfit from the VMA'S. He threw those in a dumpster behind a drug hotel. He thought about burning them but decided against it.
Dean sat next to Cas and put a hand on his knee. "Just give it some more time. You do realize your lung actually collapsed, right?"
"And made fun of you." Dean added, taking a drink of his soda."Okay, classes for the rest of the day, let's see the schedules boys." Charlie pushed the plastic tray aside. Cas pulled his schedule out of his pocket,as did Dean. They set them in front of her. "Aw, you both have tv production together. I had it this morning. Music theory, nice choice Cas. Hey! We allhave advanced English and theater together! Wait," She looked at Dean. "How did you get into advanced English?"
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean. “Honey, please. I have been locked in this house for weeks. Yes. I’m driving.”
Dean looked at his mom, mortified. Dean was not expecting the reaction he got. "I like him. Good sense of humor." The bathroom door flew open and Cas took a picture. Dean looked at him. Cas laughed. "I told you I'd get you back for all those pictures on our first date." And closed the door. Dean looked back at his mom. "That is so not what it sounds like!" Cas continued laughing. Dean heard the doorknob and got up, holding the door closed. "Really Dean? This is your plan?" He said through his laughter.
They broke into teams; Cas and Dean, Adam and Meg, Benny and Charlie. They rotated who played winner for most of the night.
