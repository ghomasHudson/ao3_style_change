Tony was about to tell him just how little he cares about what a guy who is majoring in
At the very bottom of the box, there’s a single piece of paper, slightly wrinkled from sitting underneath all the other things in the box and somehow surviving the move from Steve’s old house to college and now to their apartment (their apartment!).
Tony was at the stove, Natasha had her feet up on the breakfast table, frantically shoving forkfuls of hot waffle into her mouth as if she was afraid of someone coming to take them away from her. Clint and Sam goaded Bucky on as he neared the bottom of the coffee pot, banging their fists on their table as they chanted “chug, chug, chug,” eerily in sync with each other. Bruce had three different tablets spread out in front of him with a tiny carton of yogurt sitting idly and abandoned off to the side. Thor was at the toaster, halfway through the pile of Pop-Tarts on his plate as he waited for more to pop out.
“So, how long has it been since your wife died, Steve?” Dr. Fieldstone asks, her voice laced with an exaggerated sense of gentile that was a common quality of all therapists it seemed.
Tony knew that the Avengers were usually invited to these things, and although Tony was mostly the one elected out of the group to attend, some of the others joined him from time to time. Of course, before everything had happened, it had been him and Steve attending together. Before Steve, Tony would be flanked by a ragged group of superheroes that cleaned up surprisingly well, and before all of that, he had gone alone.
He swings his legs back and forth, idly watching his new shoes light up with the movement. Peter heaves a deep sigh, trying subtly to let his dad know just how much the boredom has caused him to start wasting away slowly, and hey, maybe some ice cream would do the trick of reviving him once more. He swings both legs faster and faster when the sighs don’t work, and the bed frame starts to squeak ominously.
“I carried a watermelon.”
“Do you think—?” Steve asked hopefully, already crouched by the complicated device, his fingers hovering over the dials but looking over his shoulder for Tony’s okay.
“Unlocked, sir.”
Tony returns to the screen, fingers poking and prodding at the rotating digital blueprint as he looks for things he can make better. When he tunes out again, he hears the soft, familiar voice of Dr. Crackpot through the speakers. He frowns and returns his attention to his AI.
“We’re trying to locate him using the satellite locating systems installed at the Mansion,” Widow informs him. Steve can hear her fingers tapping away at what is presumably a keyboard in the background of the call. “Hold on, I think we’ve got something.”
Bruce clears his throat uncomfortably, sort of wishing he’d never asked the question in the first place.
Tony opens his mouth to reply when they’re both interrupted by an awkward clearing of a throat, and Steve steps away from Tony hastily. Tony merely smirks lazily and pulls him close, looking up at Bruce hovering uncomfortably in the doorway.
“I think we’re in a time loop.”
He watches curiously as people continue to cross the street, passing in front of their car. There’s a very large group of girls wearing the same outfit, dark grey sweaters with a yellow knight embroidered on the chest, and then a really old lady follows with her hands braced against the handles of her walker as she pushes it across the street, and finally, a small family, the mom pushing a stroller that his dad tells him has a baby inside of it, the dad holding on tightly to a little kid’s hand and the long blue leash of a panting cocker spaniel wrapped around his free wrist.
At first, neither of them had noticed. They were on the ground in front of the roaring fireplace, entranced in a rousing game of bridge after discovering that it was the only card game that they both agreed on the rules - Steve having played it countless times with the other soldiers during the war and Tony having learnt it from none other than Peggy and Jarvis.
“Glad you agree, man. It was incredibly satisfying to take that fucker down,” Sam chuckled, moving his pizza slice to gently touch Bucky’s in an approximation of some kind of pizza toast.
Everyone issues a collective sigh at his remark, not even bothering to come up with a response. Thor pushes a heavily chained Loki in front of the portal, and Steve finds himself wincing to himself as he recalls their last explosive battle that had taken place as a result of Loki’s manic meddling. As such, he had been sentenced to life in exile from Asgard, although Thor had brought him back to take care of the portal, because he technically still owed them for the mess he had made earlier.
Tony nearly stopped breathing when he saw the blonde Adonis from before. At the centre of it all, holding up the leg of the redhead to his hip as he rolled his hips against hers, a wicked grin stretched across his lips. Bucky noticed him staring and grinned.
The kids doesn’t even pause before he replies. “He doesn’t have one now. That’s the problem.”
Tony breaks out into a wide grin when he finds the frame made of very colourful macaroni with a hand-drawn picture of Steve and a stick figure which Tony thinks is supposed to be Sarah with the words “I LOVE YOU MA” scribbled underneath the drawing in large, lopsided letters.
“Tony, please,” Steve practically begged, his mouth downturned and eyes open and vulnerable. He was
He listens to a popular station that’s playing the Top 40, but after hearing (and unfortunately recognizing) the opening bars to Wannabe, Tony decides he cannot subject himself to anymore Spice Girls until the sun has come up and he’s had at least three steaming cups of coffee.
, capped the dry-erase marker with a quiet
“We’re still going to try. I don’t care if it’s some sick extraterrestrial joke or if it’ll lead us somewhere worse than this, but we need to try,” Steve said, his jaw set stubbornly as he stared at the door. He looked at Tony then, that familiar steadfast determination carried in his eyes that Tony himself relied on so often.
“Dad! You have to read this one,” Peter cries out, scrambling down from the couch and hurrying over to his dad, waving the letter in the air.
Bucky shook his head. “Nah, we all grew up together, and Nat’s fuckin’ scary,” he said, his grin growing wider as Steve Rogers and the redhead—Nat, emerged from the crowd, their faces gleaming with sweat.
The Norse god lands at the giant’s feet, directing the lightning blast being channeled through his hammer into the suit’s large, protruding arc reactor. The giant immediately stops, arms and legs suspended as the electricity courses through in punctuating waves. When Thor lets go, the giant tumbles to the ground sending the Avengers scrambling it get out of its way.
“How many of those do you think we got?” He asks, taking a glance at Peter, who seems to have discarded the letter and has moved onto another one.
Bruce groans internally, rubbing a hand over his tired face. Tony must’ve triggered a full security lockdown of the Tower when he had left in his hurry, and now Bruce was stuck on the roof of the Avengers Tower in the middle of the night.
“I’m going to do whatever I can to get us out of here,” Tony assured him with a firm nod, reaching across the table to place his hand over Steve’s.
“Surprising absolutely no one: not particularly well,” Sam said with an amused huff. Fury could be a massive control freak when it came to world safety, enough that Steve often wondered if that was why Fury and Tony never got along. They were after the same thing, but using completely different means to achieve it. Fury thought it was the very people on this planet that would bring about its downfall, while Tony had set his sights beyond Earth completely.
“So are you planning on getting up?”
“Nat, maybe you forgot-”
“Our original team consisting of two espionage agents, two combat specialists, our pilot and field medic, and on-site astrophysicists were sent to a remote location a hundred miles from Thunder Bay, Ontario two weeks ago to investigate a series of what we had registered as intergalactic anomalies.” Fury intoned, another screen popping up into existence behind him, this time with a series of coordinates pinpointed to a specific location on a map depicting Northern Ontario. “The anomalies at the time had been novel in nature,” he said, throwing a glance Thor’s way. “Not like your dear brother’s when he’d brought hell to our doorstep five years ago.”
“Make that three,” he mutters, his words muffled in a yawn, his hands making grabby motions at Natasha as she stands up.
“She died two years ago.”
Steve places his hands on his hips and turns to face his son, who is perched contently on one of the bar stools at the kitchen island and sorting through a large stack of mail that the mailman had dropped off at their house earlier that morning with a curious look. Peter has a pair of scissors on the island in front of him to assist in breaking into the sealed envelopes, and he’s completely oblivious to Steve’s struggle as he sits with his socked feet kicking out every now and then.
“I have to admit, this man does seem interesting,” Steve says, handing the letter back to Peter. “But lots of people like the Dodgers, Pete. It’s not just us, you know. Your Uncle Buck loves the Dodgers, that doesn’t mean I’d fall in love with him.”
“We came as soon as we could. It took us hours to get out of the town and then—”
Tony had been a friend to Bruce at a time when even his own team was afraid of him and his ability to lose control at any given time in a space they all shared. He’d invited Bruce to make himself at home in his own workshop, and eventually, Bruce had been able to let down his guard enough that they had even started to work on individual projects together. It had been the start of a great friendship, and Bruce often found himself unable to remember the last time he let his guard down around another person.
Tony’s mind races as he tries to piece everything together. The Captain taking off abruptly after someone called about his kid, the letter, and the meeting place. The kid lets go of his father’s hand, taking a step closer to Tony when he doesn’t respond.
Bruce watches him go with faintly concealed amusement, and then sighs to himself as he casts one last look at the skies. He starts to disassemble all of their equipment another ten minutes later when the skies remain clear and unblinkin, carefully packing it all up in the cases that Tony had brought them in.
“On it,” Steve replied from the kitchen where he had gone to grate more cheese for their chilli.
“So Loki was working for Thanos, who’s the big boss, basically. Titan, really mean, purple—”
He drives off the ramp, finding himself unable to get rid of the strange feeling in his stomach about the oddly familiar voice of “Sleepless in Seattle” and his son.
“Hey there, bud,” he says, holding his coffee close to his chest so DUM-E can’t knock it over onto himself. “You don’t think I’m a monster, do you?” The robot whirs at his words, eager at recognizing sounds rather than understanding a syllable of what Tony is saying.
“Well, it’s my Dad, actually,” the kid says, his voice hesitant but oddly determined. “I think he needs a new wife.”
Steve had been a tough nut to crack, and that statement was rather an understatement, but after the multiple run-ins at ungodly hours of the night in the team common room that had eventually become actual dates during the day, they’d shared the sort of trauma that was both typical baggage that came with being alive as well as the not so usual trauma that they eventually learned to shoulder together. When they’d said to find someone with shared life experiences, the two of them had gone above and beyond that.
“Mechanical engineering. I’m gonna take over my dad’s company one day,” Tony told him, before he immediately wants to shove the words back into his mouth. Ty’s smirk gets wider at that, somehow managing to look down on Tony despite being several inches shorter than him.
That’s when the alarm goes off.
He carefully places the frame on the ground next to the box and digs deeper. Out comes the heart-shaped sunglasses that Tony had accidentally brought back home from kindergarten after goofing around playing dress-up with Steve on their second day of school.
“Always, Shellhead,” Steve replies, a grin coming across his severely cut up face when Iron Man swoops down to pick him up. Steve adjusts his stance on the armour’s back so that he is more secure and hangs on for the ride, as smooth as ever.
“What the fuck, JARVIS? Why isn’t the door opening?” Tony asked, his voice taking on a hint of desperation as the repulsors charged, again and again, blasting the door relentlessly and without any result whatsoever. Not even a splintering. Steve charged forward with his shield, bringing it down onto the knob and then standing back and flinging it with every ounce of his strength at the door.
Steve’s eyes start drooping somewhere around the beginning of The Last Jedi, his hand falling limp at his side from where it had been gently stroking Tony’s hair. With a huff, Tony reaches up to grab Steve’s hand and places it back atop his unruly hair, arching up into his hand in prompting. Steve smiles softly before resuming his petting, the image of a particularly clingy cat flitting into his tired mind. If the cat was a very warm and cuddly genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, that is.
“Hey, since you get to go through all my stuff, why can’t I go through your stuff?” Clint asks, crossing his arms over his chest.
“You had my six when you literally told the government and like, the United fuckin’ Nations to suck your dick, so you better believe I’ve got your back right now.” Bucky insisted, shooting Steve an errant grin. “We told Fury to fuck himself, by the way. One less thing you gotta worry about.”
An elevator arrives at the deck with a chirpy ding, and Tony’s heart pounds in his chest. He curls his fingers inside of the armour, waiting anxiously for the doors to slide open.
As the sun started dipping below the horizon and the bedroom turned dark, Steve would turn on the lamp on Tony’s nightstand, pause at the doorway, and then head into the kitchen where he would make dinner for two. He would come back with Tony’s plate which would be left untouched as the coffee but thankfully removed before Steve went to bed.
“No answering the door by yourself, Pete, unless we’re expecting anybody, remember?” Steve chastises as he and Peter reach the door together. He pulls it open, expecting more mail, only to reveal Bucky on the other side.
Thor places his phone back onto the table, and turns on his side, reaching down to lift up the soft fleece duvet over himself. He had just shut his eyes for perhaps five precious minutes, when he hears it.
“You got it, Cap.”
“Your only age appropriate celebrity crush,” Steve teased, squinting at the tiny rubber buttons.
He does one final loop around the city, this time heading towards the dreaded building he had been avoiding all night, telling himself that if no one is up there then he will head right back home, no waiting around, although he’s sure he’d probably end up breaking that promise to himself before the night is up.
“I know I haven’t been the most swell guy to be around lately,” Steve murmured, crouching down next to Dodger, who was far too busy giving his lunch all of his attention to bother with Steve. “I’m going to try to do better, pal, I swear.” He waited a moment for Dodger to finish before spilling more food into his bowl, because he figured he could do that even though it did little to ease his guilt.
Steve surged forward, not realizing or more likely, not caring that he’d just stepped into the puddle of pancake batter as he gathered Tony up into his arms, his shaky breath coming out in gasps as he buried his face into Tony’s neck.
“MIT,” Tony answered, watching the shift in Ty’s expression with a sort of self-satisfaction that he’d been thriving off of every time one of his parents’ friends asked him where he was going next year. Ty’s face smoothed out again, that slick smile taking familiar residence on his face as he probably figured that Tony was majoring in something like
“Look, I’m sorry but I never got any reports, I swear,” Clint insists, turning his fearful gaze helplessly towards Tony who shrugs, sporting a grin Steve knows he isn’t even trying to conceal.
The suit weaves around Rockefeller Center, and Tony waves his fingers at a group of people out on the observation deck who point up at him excitedly. He flies past Times Square, doing another loop around the city, very pointedly ignoring the Empire State Building.
“If I remember correctly, it got your ass to bed, didn’t it?” Steve replied, his twitching lips teasing a larger smile.
“You know what? Fine. I’ll go have a look at my desk. But you’re going to be swallowing your words, Barton,” she sighs, and drops the pile of candy wrappers she had been picking out of some files.
“Go on without me. I’ve got to get to the Empire State building.”
Tony should’ve found a way out by now. He’d gotten out of a cave in the middle of the Afghan desert with a box of scraps and a car battery hooked up to his heart, but somehow he couldn’t solve a fucking puzzle in order to get him and Steve out of this cabin.
“Widow? What’s your status?” Steve queried, looking up to share a worried glance with Tony when all they got in response was the sound of static.
Bucky’s face was barely visible past the three, green oblong objects he was juggling in his arms, objects which Tony soon realized were watermelons. Bucky smiled when he saw him, but his brows quickly followed as he looked behind Tony’s shoulder at a faded sign that he’d passed by on his way.
“Hey pal….yeah, hi,” Steve murmured, crouching down to get Dodger clipped onto his leash and smoothing his hand through the soft part of Dodger’s head, between his perked up ears. “I’m gonna be away for a bit, just like we talked about. Try not to shit on Jack for me,” Steve paused and frowned a little as he tried to figure out if Jack was indeed the name of the intern who had agreed (stood at parade rest the entire time Steve was talking to him and actually saluted him when he left) to take care of Dodger until Steve returned.
Thor tucks Mjolnir into the little space Bruce had helped him create in one of the empty drawers in his nightstand. He chuckles to himself as he drapes the soft fleece baby blanket over his hammer, remembering when Tony had bought it for him as a joke and Thor had immediately thanked him and brought it up for Mjolnir, much to his friend’s surprise.
“It got my ass to do things that were not sleeping in bed, yes,” Tony said, his heart pounding as he went over that sentence in his head and cursing himself when he confirmed with himself that yes, that was definitely flirting and therefore off-limits.
When he arrives, his bots wheel toward him eagerly, probably itching for attention. A smile tugs at the corner of Tony’s lips as DUM-E inches towards him with its claw reaching out. Tony lifts a hand to rub the metallic frame of the ill-formed robot.
There was a small wooden nightstand on either side of the bed, identical in shape and size. They looked to be made of the same polished wood as the other furniture they had encountered. They also each had an identical lamp sitting atop their surface. Each wall to the left and right of the bed had windows, Steve noticed belatedly. The room was so dark because the windows had been covered with thicker curtains that the ones used to cover the two smaller windows in the other room. Pushed up against the wall where the door was, a large wardrobe sat, this one made of a darker wood than the other furniture.
“Nothing like it.”
“How about some tea first,” he asked, opening up one of the cabinets with the glass window on the front and pulling out two mugs, one with a faded Union Jack and the other with an image of Mickey Mouse on its ceramic side, with a soft “yay!”
Tony watched idly (he kind of overshot to panicked instead of the idle he’d been going for) as Natasha leant in close to Steve, turning her body away from the crowd to presumably tell him something before leaving his side, making her way over to the table where Pepper was sitting with the SI donors. Shit. If they’d located Pepper it wouldn’t be long before Tony himself got made.
“If Thor doesn’t get here soon, we’re pretty much toast, Cap,” Hawkeye comments, panting into the comm link. “And I mean that literally.”
“Sorry,” he muttered, voice muffled by Tony’s shirt. Tony’s hand which had been buried in his damp hair, softly rubbing the back of his head, immediately stilled at the apology.
Thor’s frown deepened as he regarded them. “Like, the infinity stones? Thanos is after them, yada yada, big, purple guy in the chair?”
Okay, so maybe he was feeling a little left out. It didn’t matter much. At least Bucky was happy and himself again. That was more than enough for Steve.
Once they were about fifty feet from the ground, Steve almost wanted to jump out of Iron Man’s hold. He knew that he would make the fall.
A holographic screen popped up behind him, the focal point of the image briefly obstructed by Fury as he made a second pass on his attempt to pace through the carpeted floor of the conference room. When he finally moved away, Tony was able to make out six profiles; three men and three women, all of whom looked to be SHIELD agents. Tony’s speculation was confirmed by Natasha’s quiet intake of breath that suggested she knew someone up on that screen.
It was day 160 and the coffee that Steve had made him rested untouched on the nightstand near Tony’s side of the bed.
When Tony saw her partner, he really felt as if he was witnessing the Second Coming. The guy wasn’t so much leading the woman as he was playing with her, every push answered with an equal pull like a turbulent tied, as they spun circles around each other without managing to topple over somehow. His black shirt was loose and unbuttoned down to the middle of his chest, the rest of it tucked into the waistband of his tight black pants. A few blond locks had started to curl into his forehead from where his golden hair had been neatly pushed back with some pomade. His steps mirrored the erratic beat of Tony’s heart as he watched the two dancers battle it out in each other’s arms.
The only thing he didn’t regret about that fight was protecting Bucky. In the mornings, Bucky would walk into Steve’s floor, Sam usually in tow as he usually was these days. He’d take one look at Steve and know how he’d spent his night. Bucky never said anything. Steve knew that he felt an exorbitant amount of guilt because he felt responsible for the mess that Steve’s relationship with Tony had become. The therapy had certainly helped and Steve knew that Sam helped as well, even though neither of them seemed to realize it yet. Bucky was the only thing in his life he would never regret.
Peter waves goodbye to his father and follows MJ further into the house, listening to the low sounds of his dad hurriedly talking to MJ’s mom about emergency contacts and other important things. MJ flops down next to the low coffee table with a bowl of half-finished popcorn and shoves her hand inside to grab at some. There’s a movie that’s been paused on the TV, probably when MJ and her mom had gotten up to let Peter and his dad in.
Despite their careful planning involving the whole team, something that Steve didn’t recall them doing since their sceptre raids before everything with Ultron happened, he still worried. He knew that they had an advantage that the other teams hadn’t, in fact, they had multiple advantages, including an alien god who was probably more familiar with intergalactic activity than any of them, a genius in a metal suit with an entire arsenal of weaponry built into it, two supersoldiers, a Hulk, and three highly trained special op agents, one of whom also had a suit that allowed for flight.
“Uh, my brain kind of just shuts down when you do that so I don’t really have a response for your right now,” Tony mumbles a little breathily, tilting his head back to give Steve more access.
They all meet on their way to the roof, which is where the alert had originated according to a very amused JARVIS. Natasha’s still wearing her kitten pajamas, but has two pistols in each hand, and has somehow managed to strap on a holster onto her bare arm, her knives safely tucked into it. Steve looks alarmingly similar to a grumpy old guy who has just been awoken from his afternoon nap. Clint is smirking, although no one wants to know why, Thor is looking murderous, and Tony is truly feeling the dread as he aims his repulsors at the door leading up to the roof.
“Well, don’t let me keep you. There doesn’t seem to be much happening tonight, but it’s probably just less visible to us since we’re in the city.” Bruce offers, carefully adjusting the mount on the telescope so that it could pan to another section of sky.
Steve dropped the bowl containing the remnants of the pancake batter onto the floor when Tony walked in, tugging his blanket over his shoulders as he peered into the frying pan curiously.
It was almost overwhelming, to see all of that laid so bare for Tony to see. To see Steve be so vulnerable with him after months of boasting an emotional buffer between them.
He arrives on scene less than fifteen minutes later, the Helicarrier blasting away at supersonic speeds to get him there as fast as possible. It’s utter chaos when Steve arrives, fully suited up and shield grasped tightly in his hand.
They’d ended up falling asleep huddled together on the couch after watching The Empire Strikes Back and laughing about how Peter had called it “that really old movie” and that one time Tony had treated a very horrified but also pleasantly surprised Steve to the infamous golden bikini outfit adorned by Princess Leia on his second birthday that they’d spent together as a couple.
“Guess you’re right,” Stark nearly purrs. “Maybe if you’re lucky, Captain, you’ll find out just how I got away from those goons.”
Iron Man laughs, and Steve can’t help but feel at awe of the quality of the suit’s technology that makes it so his laugh sounds so real. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Steve had been curious about one of the aspects of Iron Man’s infamous armour, and probably not the last time either.
“You’re too dumb to care anyway. I appreciate that,” Tony murmurs softly as he moves to his worktable. He places his coffee down on the surface of the table, shoving his tech away just in case he accidentally knocked it over onto his work.
Although, Tony was starting to think Obadiah may have been in on it for far longer than he had suspected. Through the encrypted files himself and Pepper had investigated, Tony was starting to think Obadiah might have been the one to have him abducted the first time during his demo in Afghanistan.
Steve’s shield is a little ways off, leaning nicely up against the wall beside the TV and always in his line of sight, no matter how many times Tony shifts them from his spot snuggled up into Steve’s side. Clint has his bow slung over the back of the couch and his portable arrows safely inside of the little pouch Tony had made to go with them. There had been fanny pack jokes for weeks after Tony had first given Clint the portable explosive arrows in the small bag that strapped around his waist, but after they’d gotten ambushed by those tiny bots in Central Park and Clint was the only one who had had a weapon on him, the jokes had abruptly come to a stop.
“I am here, my friends,” Thor begins, turning swiftly before he can finish his sentence to thrust his hammer into a group of oncoming Doombots, sending them flying into the air.
“I’ve had enough of space for a lifetime. I’m going to bed” Natasha mutters, yanking at the blanket trapped under Clint’s legs. He frowns and slowly blinks up at her, whining softly as his blanket is taken away from him.
So, twenty minutes later, Peter finds himself in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, cradling MJ’s large pink piggy bank with change that he used to pay the cab driver and wearing an old Dora backpack with a bottle of water. He feels more than a little overwhelmed staring up at the tall, arching ceilings and the people walking fast to get wherever they need to go.
When they all manage to clamber up, the Hulk himself is waiting for them. Well, shit.
The remainder of breakfast went without further event. Thor finished his last Pop-Tart and debated aloud whether he should bring another box with him for the ride over, a decision which Bruce firmly vetoed. Natasha left the table after finishing her own breakfast, not bothering to bring her plate over to the dishwasher. Sam and Bucky began to bicker as they cleaned up after themselves. After sharing a tired look with Clint, Steve got up himself, deciding to head up to the Quinjet himself.
Thor perked up, his brows furrowed in an inquisitive frown that looked foreign on his face. “You think it’s another stone?”
Buster ventured too close to the fireplace the next day, and he wasn’t replaced the day after during the cabin’s daily reset.
“Not everyone listens to it. And besides, no one’s going to know it was us.”
16 years later, Tony’s ready to collapse on the air mattress that their friends had blown up for them before they’d left his and Steve’s apartment for the night.
“Yes, but he is very purple, it’s important that you know. So, Loki came here for the Tesseract, yes? In it, was the space stone, which has like, powers and things. There are other stones, but I’m not sure how many. But the reality stone, which is more of an angry sludge thing, was in Asgard briefly, and kind of—went in my girlfriend, Jane—”
“You won’t lose me.” Tony shuffled closer to him on the table, enough so that their arms were touching and their faces were inches apart. “You won’t.”
Thor bids them all a very good night and departs once again, presumably to return his brother back to wherever he’s been exiled to. The rest of them pile into the Helicarrier that awaits them, somehow managing to avoid the press, but perhaps only because it’s so late at night. They all slump on the benches inside, every one of them desperate to take off their masks, but unable to because none of their identities had been revealed yet due to SHIELD protocol.
After the fight with Obadiah and his poorly engineered suit, Tony had been harassed with the recurring nightmare of his longtime mentor forcibly removing the one thing that Tony needed in order to survive right in front of him. Of course, this wasn’t how he had actually acquired the reactor. Obadiah had merely broken into Tony’s lab and found one of the earlier versions of his reactor that he had used in his own suit with poor results.
Steve bids the team goodbye and heads towards the code-encrypted elevators that would lead him to his quarters. He was desperately in need of a shower before he could finally head back home to his son.
“Cross my heart,” Tony swore to him, trying not to drop his watermelon as they reached the large barn doors that were nearly vibrating with the force of the music behind them.
They’d watched Wall-E on day 311 because neither of them had seen it before but Steve had put it on their watchlist right before the Accords had happened. Steve cried, which was entirely unsurprising. If Tony found himself to be a little misty-eyed over the animated movie, he was blaming Pixar and their insurmountable ability to evoke emotion.
Tony found himself not able to finish his fries later that night, as they all sat around the kitchen table with various packaging that had once contained every time from the Burger King menu strewn across its surface. Steve had dragged in a giant whiteboard at some point, where he’d scribbled out a pretty effective plan of action based on the data that they’d received after their meeting with Fury earlier.
“Not,” Tony curtly replied, waiting for that scowl or for him to roll his eyes. “Are you wasting my time for a reason, Rogers?”
As soon as the words pushed their way out of his mouth like a torrential storm, Tony immediately wanted to launch himself into the lake where the crocodiles or piranhas, or whatever carnivorous animal that lived there, could devour him peacefully.
Tomorrow. He wasn’t going to have to ride the anticipation for much longer now.
Sam grinned and rolled his eyes, flipping open the lid of one of the boxes that Bucky and Steve had already begun to demolish and ripping apart his own slice of cheese pizza. “Oh, now he asks. It was just your everyday beat up the bogeyman and get back the goods, except the bogeyman was a middle-aged John Smith whose best bud had bought his law firm from him.”
“You really think so?”
Tony knew they weren’t being watched the traditional way or through any sort of tech. They hadn’t found any bugs during their initial panic-induced survey of the cabin and even afterward when they’d come to terms with the situation. They also knew that it didn’t mean they weren’t being watched some other way. Tony was painfully aware of that as he tinkered during the day with Steve at his side playing helpful sidekick, and shivered in the large bed alone at night.
The jet slowly lowered itself as they arrived at the coordinates, the door unhinging outward just as Nat and Clint had them safely landed into the snow.
Bruce sighs and slides down the door, having resigned himself to spending the night up on the roof. Hey, maybe he can actually catch sight of the meteor shower.
“Don’t worry. Pretty soon, you can too.”
Sighing, he smooths out the creases in the stained piece of paper, and lays it out in front of him, starting to read with his pointer finger following each hastily scrawled word.
“Uh, you bet I do. I’m sleeping with Captain America, Bruce. I’ve got a hot date every night,” Tony says, lifting his head to peer up at the empty night sky without the aid of his telescope.
There it was again. Moving on. Steve didn’t know why he had so much trouble with it when everyone else seemed to manage just fine. Maybe it was a good thing, that he never moved on. If he had moved on after they’d pulled him from the ice, he wouldn’t have Bucky.
“What stone are you talking about, Thor?” Bruce asked, the little dot on the screen blinking red showing that they were fast approaching the location, in between them.
“Where’s the jet?” It was someone off-camera. The voice was hard to make out through the reverberating hum of the flying Quinjet, but they sounded positively perplexed. Tony realized that this was the retrieval crew, probably doing an initial surveillance flight. They were looking for the original team’s Quinjet, which, unless they had activated the reflective panels that would enable its camouflage into the surrounding forest, should’ve been visible.
“Hey, kiddo. What’ve you been up to?” Bucky asks, following Peter into the kitchen as he starts chattering about all the mail they’ve got and how he’s been helping Steve sort them out.
“Tony very stupid.”
Looking around at his home that doesn’t feel like a home, Tony feels a sharp pang in his chest. The man he had trusted for most of his adult life after his parents’ death had been hungering for his own death all along. Tony had spent his life thinking he was making weapons for his country, when in reality he had been sentencing an innocent child to death with every dollar he was making for himself.
Steve wraps his arms around him, nudging his nose against the top of Tony’s head. “Maybe once or twice. It wouldn’t hurt if you said it again, though.”
“You never gave me any reports! All we’re gonna find in my room is you looking sheepish because you didn’t give them to me,” Clint says as he walks (or more accurately, jogs) in order to keep up with Natasha’s too-long strides.
Steve had foregone his usual early morning run for a quick workout down in the gym, falling into the familiar rhythm of his pre-mission routine. He’d spent a little while with the bags and then he had moved on to working with the weights for the remainder of the hour that he’d allocated for himself before going back up to get ready. The thought of their upcoming mission weighed heavily on Steve’s mind throughout his routine. Despite Tony having thoroughly….looked into SHIELD’s classified servers that none of them would normally have clearance to access, the intel that Fury had provided them seemed to be all that SHIELD had on the operation.
“So are you gonna tell us about last night, or are we supposed to be satisfied with Nat’s very concise, literal debrief of events?” Sam asked him, the concern evident in his voice, but the curiosity was written plainly across both their faces. Steve knew that Nat must have given them more than that, but he was grateful that they were nice enough to ask him about it anyway even if they did know the outcome of the evening before.
Tony pulls back to look at him, blinking hard. “I asked you for the time.”
“I didn’t even try,” he replied, his voice muffled as he spoke to the table rather than Tony. “I was cold.” He didn’t elaborate but Tony still understood all the things that meant. The bed was too empty, too wide. The alarm clock wasn’t right, there was no fire. Tony didn’t want to think about trying to fall asleep alone.
“Need a ride, Captain?”
Steve activated the comm that he’d shoved into his ear moments ago, muttering a quick test into it to make sure that everyone had their own devices turned on and active. After he'd received confirmation, he led the team outside at a jog, turning back to briefly marvel at the shimmering panels of the Quinjet reflecting its surroundings as it went into stealth mode.
Another screen appeared behind Fury, this one playing a short video clip that SHIELD had received shortly after the team had been deployed. The quality was very low, and Tony knew that couldn’t be because of the tech or the reception. The camera shook violently, the video cutting off frequently. Whoever was filming seemed to be moving, and fast. They had captured what would have normally looked like a picturesque wooded area, a blanket of velvety, untouched snow covering every inch of the ground and large coniferous trees. Sharp, flickering horizontal lines cut through them as the video glitched and groaned.
“You wouldn’t happen to have a bobby pin on you, Cap, would you?” Stark asks, still completely nonchalant except for the occasional wince that suggested there was quite a bit more behind the unbothered facade.
“I’m not moping,” he still insisted, albeit very weakly. He cast a glance towards Dodger, who was obediently sitting at his feet because he loved Steve and would never judge him about pining just a little bit. Definitely not because he was vying for a piece of pepperoni that might miraculously fly off the table. “I’ve just been thinking.”
“What’s the situation?” He asks no one in particular, making eye contact with the Scarlet Witch, who thrusts her hands at him and then above, red tendrils of magic propelling him up.
Tony thinks about this. “When’s 3 o’clock?” he asks, feeling like it was awful late. What did Jarvis and Ana and Mom and Dad do for all that time?
In her hands, was a file with a bright yellow Post-It stuck on top that said, “Mission reports!! Send out by tonight.”
“Cut those in halves, please,” he instructed, before turning back to his steak. Tony spent the next twenty minutes very carefully slicing the tomatoes in half, trying not to slice his own finger open in the process.
“You better not go squealin’ to Daddy about this, man,” Bucky warned him, even as he led Tony up the steep path to the house.
Steve ate in the kitchen by himself and went to sleep on the couch. Tony sometimes heard his choked sobs, the silence not heavy enough to muffle his grief.
Steve can’t manage a verbal response, but he does respond with a weak nod, hoping it relays his tired enthusiasm. Tony buries his face back into the curve of his neck and for a short second Steve thinks he may have fallen asleep, before he’s pulling away again squeezing Steve’s bicep as he pushes himself off the couch.
He then turned on his phone to thirty-two text messages and exactly seven phone calls, five from Pepper and two from Rhodey, wondering where his ass had gotten to and then another message to let him know that he’d gotten pizza delivered to the Tower for Tony’s post-bender meal.
Even when Peter’s mom had gotten really sick and she slept at the hospital for what seemed like ages in Peter’s perception of time, and they hadn’t known what was wrong with her. Even when the doctors had come and told them they’d have to go back home without her, and his dad had just held out his hand for Peter to take and they’d gone to his Uncle Bucky’s and Peter had gotten to eat ice cream for dinner.
He practically skips into the room, his mouth open and ready with a dirty quip, when he abruptly comes to a stop halfway in, his forehead creased with the beginnings of a frown.
“Yeah, I’m thinking it was the bacon,” Steve quipped, his eyes fixed on the way Tony’s hands flipped through the screens that Bruce was pointing to, his eyes deeply curious as they read the graphs and numbers projected in front of him. Tony was frowning, flicking one of the screens back and gesturing in that way he did when he’d figured something out and was explaining why he was right. Bruce was dutifully taking down what Tony was saying, even as Tony walked away  a little as his thoughts evidently gained momentum.
“However, we are calling you in now,” Fury stated, steadfastly ignoring the heated glare that Tony kept aimed his way. “Banner and Stark, we’ve forwarded the necessary data that had been compiled by both crews with the included video logs. The Quinjet will leave tomorrow morning. I suggest you get some rest.”
“Give me a couple minutes to get these set up on the shelf and we’ll go out for burgers?” Peter’s dad says, interrupting his train of thought. At the sound of the word “burgers” Peter perks up immediately, all else forgotten temporarily. He nods enthusiastically until his dad chuckles and places a large hand on top of his head to stop his head from moving so much. Peter nudges his head into his dad’s hand like a sleepy cat, even letting out a quiet meow to complete the act.
They had sat around the dining table the night before, with dozens of burgers, so many varieties of fried potatoes, and milkshakes, poring over the videos from the meeting and the recordings from Dulquer and Rachel. They’d made note of every detail, every odd sound in the background that might’ve gone unnoticed by the original agents as they had made their way through a deserted town. Nat had pointed out that when Dulquer began to hear the bells, the constant howling of the wind that had accompanied the agents’ stream of observations had suddenly been replaced with silence. After that, they weren’t able to hear any noises other than the sounds of the agents’ voices.
The diner had yielded similar results, however, there had been plates full of half-eaten food on every table. Some of the food had been fresh, with Rachel commenting on an arrangement of a singular pancake with a few pieces of bacon next to it that had somehow retained their greasy sheen, and upon closer inspection, having wispy curls of steam coming off of them. Other plates had pieces of orange slices that had begun to grow fur, or cups of coffee with a layer of film over their once-liquid brown surfaces.
Steve was not happy about having to work under SHIELD again. Half the reason behind why he’d stuck with them before they’d become aware that HYDRA had taken control was because Peggy had founded SHIELD, and Steve had believed that if she’d thought there was a cause for SHIELD’s existence, then he would continue to fight for that cause. After HYDRA’s takeover, however, Steve was even less sure of who to trust, let alone believe that the information he was receiving wasn’t only half the information that was known by officials, each with their own agenda.
Steve hurries forward, swinging his shield onto his back as his feet bring him closer to Stark. The others have dispersed, making sure the kidnappers have been thoroughly neutralized and further assessing the situation to see if there were any more lingering around. Steve realizes he doesn’t have the key to unlock the cuffs when he gets to Stark’s side.
Tony looked up from where he’d been in deep conversation with Bruce, their heads bent together as they peered at one of Bruce’s tablets. “Oh. I was hungry. Wasn’t really feeling pancakes.”
“You bet.”
“True. Also, you were after him at some point.”
Peter rolls his eyes. “I’m not trying to cheat, I’m not stupid, MJ. But I have to tell you something.”
“I think you’re gonna be famous, Steve,” Tony says, peering down at the blue sky and the green grass and the gray boxes with squares in them and the green lady in the background which Tony knows is the Statue of Liberty from his history book that Jarvis had got him for Christmas.
“Hey, baby, I’m back,” he murmurs into Steve’s neck, pressing close so Steve’s muscled back was right up against his chest.
Tony groans in frustration. “This is so unfair. Sex or science. Science or sex,” he mutters. “It’s like the age-old question of ‘sex or food’ except so much worse.”
The security guard leads him to the gate and explains to the flight attendants waiting for people to show them their tickets that Peter got lost. They coo at him and let him in, and Peter smiles wide and thanks all three of them, just like his dad taught him to do.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Yeah, we kinda got that from the whole mopey Steve situation you’ve got going on here,” he said, gesturing to the general vicinity of Steve’s apartment. “I’m gonna assume you tried to talk to him? Did he say anything?”
“I’m going to try to slip in,” the Wasp informs them, and Steve catches her shrinking down before she zips away, presumably to find a way to get inside the armour.
“Yeah, it is,” Tony mumbles, reaching out to Steve, wrapping his free arm around his neck and pulling him close. “Remember how we met?”
Tony won that round but he’s half convinced that Steve let him win.
“Yeah, always. And now, we’re home.”
Fuck it. Tony triggers the armour’s release, waiting for the metal plates to slide open before he steps out onto the ground in front of him. He takes in a breath, his gaze locked on Steve’s wide eyes as he also puts the pieces together.
“With the evidence that we had at the time, we did not think the threat was so high as to require the Avengers to be called in. The activity was not Asgardian in nature and we have the resources to handle it,” Fury said, although his argument was lacking to everyone in the room. “Our job at SHIELD is dealing with anomalies, Stark. Our agents are trained to deal with situations exactly like this one. They were doing exactly what they signed up to do.”
During the day, he heard Steve working at the puzzle in the floor next to the bed, the soft clicking as he turned the dials and the scratch of his pencil against the sheets of paper as Steve recorded each combination he tried. There must’ve been thousands of them written down already.
“Stone would kill me.”
Steve had led the team in coming up with a plan, even though there was nothing that he disliked more than following a plan. He knew that for a mission like this one, they were going to have to reel in each of their well-practiced reckless tendencies in order to make it out of this with the missing agents and residents of the town, and having found out the source of the anomalies. On top of that fairly ambitious objective, they were meant to come out of this preferably alive.
“Shut up Clint.”
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
“Hey, hey. Steve. Buddy, you’re okay. We’re in the middle of bumfuck Canada. You’re not alone. I’m here, I got you.” It was Tony. Steve felt warm, calloused hands tightly grasp his own and when all he could see were dark spots, Steve felt two strong arms wrapping around him, pulling him towards a solid chest. He felt something circular and hard push into the middle of his own chest as he slumped into the embrace.
It was built into the floor, ten rotating dials with different letters of the alphabet on their faces. Another series of dials formed a second row just underneath the first, identical except instead of letters, they had numbers from zero to nine on each face. There were five rows in total, the dials of each alternating between letters and numbers and completely hidden from view by the bulk of the nightstand.
“Nah, ‘course not. I was just thinking that since you’re on the make again--”
“What? Why are you looking at the orange juice like that?” Steve questioned a little frantically, holding the fridge door open so that it wouldn’t close on Tony.
“Hey, MJ,” he says, picking up his cards and carefully peering at them.
“No.”
The week after that was hopeful, with Tony and Steve working on the puzzle with renewed effort, Buster loyally assisting them whenever he was required. They worked in shifts, one wordlessly getting up to make them lunch or coffee. Most often it was Steve who got up first, turning on the wireless radio to the classic rock station that Tony had managed to reach, and chopping up fruit to make one smoothie or another. Usually kale, because he knew it was Tony’s favourite.
If only he knew how to go about getting a new mom, Peter could be one step closer to making his dad happy again. Maybe he’d ask his Uncle Bucky when he saw him next.
He spots the Black Widow over at the far end of the room, her hands flying over the keyboard in front of her as she gives curt instructions out of the corner of her mouth to a younger agent at her shoulder. He makes his way over, making sure his cowl is secure over his face as his presence starts drawing more attention than he would have liked.
They’d gotten in and out smoothly, secured the tech as well as the SHIELD hostages and taken in the low-level goons who hadn’t quite managed to make the grand escape that they’d clearly been planning to. The SHIELD agents had been new recruits, two young men who had looked equally starstruck and sheepish at having the Avengers come to salvage their failed mission. All in all, it had been quick and easy, definitely not a task the Avengers had been required for. Steve had seen it for what it was. A simple mission that could have easily been taken over if Steve and Tony hadn’t been able to work past their personal issues for the sake of the job.
Tony shifts restlessly in his car as he drives down the freeway after the Avengers’ brief stint in Manhattan earlier that night. Without fail, once the Helicarrier drops him off at his private hangar in Malibu, Tony gets rid of his suit and makes the drive back to his house so that no one, not even the most perceptive reporters or worse, paparazzi, could make the connection to Tony Stark and Iron Man.
“J, buddy, hit the lights for me,” he called out with a grin as he walked down into his workshop. Dum-E whirred to life at his arrival, chirping happily and rolling towards him as fast as his wheels could carry him. Tony chuckled and ran a gentle hand down the familiar strut of Dum-E’s back, smiling when the bot rolled forward to headbutt his knee.
“Hey there, pal. You missed me?” Tony asked him as he walked further into the room, machines and holo-screens coming alive as he walked past them. He unbuttoned his cuffs and pushed his sleeves down his arms, ooh-ing and mhm-ing at Dum-E’s elaborative chirps and buzzes as the bot followed closely at his heels.
“Yeah, bud. I’m Tony Stark,” he whispers, crouched down low so he’s at eye level with Peter.
“Yeah, you better hope so,” Steve murmurs, still half in shock at the possibility that quite literally the entire country could have heard his sob story. He finishes safely transporting the turkey into the freezer when the doorbell rings three times in quick succession. Before Peter can scramble off his stool to get the door, Steve is already striding towards it.
. What in God’s name had persuaded him to lift up a spatula that was not sentient?
“What if something left us a not so nice housewarming surprise from space and then left?” Steve suggested, standing up and walking towards the wardrobe.
“Watch me. Watch my eyes,” Steve said when Tony kept his eyes glued to his feet. Tony swallowed when his eyes met Steve’s blue ones, and Steve rolled his hips against Tony’s, rotating in one direction and then the next. Tony tried to follow him, letting himself go loose in Steve’s arms as Steve took one of Tony’s arms and flung it over his own shoulder. Tony linked his fingers loosely behind Steve’s neck. They bounced and rolled and jived together to the blaring music that Tony could barely hear over the constant roaring in his ears.
He looked up, startled, just in time to see Natasha slink into the room and slide into the chair across from him.
“Tony, these hands will start flying if you say another word.”
“HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY STILL BE MAKING THAT HORRID NOISE, YOU STUPID CREATURE?” Thor demands, striding forward to demolish the thing once more.
Steve nodded, his teeth clenched against the wall of ice that threatened to have his mind buried inside of it. Tony nodded as well, slowly stepping away from him and directing Steve to one of the barstools at the island. He pushed Steve down onto it and then crossed the room to pull the open window shut.
But then he thinks about how sad his dad looks all the time and he tells himself that the solution lies just one plane ride away. If he can do this, his dad could be happy again. So Peter walks up to a security guard and pokes at his elbow.
“How would the infinity stone being there explain the disappearances?” Steve wondered, idly noticing the way Tony’s gaze flitted to him once again when he spoke, before he hurriedly schooled his expression into one that was more closed off.
The room was drenched in silence as the video started up again, on mute this time. Fury stopped his pacing, apparently having exhausted his arsenal of dramatics. He turned to face them, hand clasped behind his back as another screen popped up behind him, this one playing another video clip. It offered a bird’s eye view of what seemed to be the scene from the previous video, although much more visible, probably filmed from a jet from up above.
“You don’t like the one he has now?” The doctor asks, her voice carrying a distinct tone of amusement.
The two espionage and combat specialists had been the ones to venture into the town, stating their names as Dulquer and Rachel to identify themselves at the beginning of the recording. They had dated it to almost two and a half weeks ago. They’d begun by visiting what they perceived to be the hubs of the town: a popular diner and a string of small businesses that seemed to form the town square. The streets had been barren, sidewalks empty and roads clear of any vehicles, personal or commercial. They had noticed that despite the apparent desertion, there had been cars lined up along the side of the sidewalk, but no signs of abandonment. No car doors haphazardly flung open as the people within tried to flee- whatever had caused them to disappear so abruptly. No signs of looted stores or vehicles forming the tableau of a brutal crash that would’ve suggested any struggle.
He blinked his eyes open on day 156, dully watching the window that wouldn’t open and the wall of stacked logs that wouldn’t give. He heard the sounds of Steve rattling about in the kitchen, a muffled curse as something vaguely metallic sounding clattered to the floor.
“I can’t remember what they look like,” Steve admitted to him in a hushed whisper. “I mean, I do. But it’s like—”
“Don’t ask, Cap. I’m not the kind of guy to kiss and tell,” Stark says, his eyes glinting mischievously.
“Funny how the tables turn. Remember when it used to be you who nagged us into eating three full meals a day?” Sam smirked, playfully checking Steve’s shoulder as he passed by.
Even when they’d been together, Steve had actively despised any circumstance where he couldn’t do anything to help. Tony knew that it was because of Steve’s childhood that had been largely spent watching his mother take back to back shifts at the TB ward to keep him alive and then watching helplessly as she’d succumbed to the belligerent illness herself, all while Steve had still been unable to make a living for himself.
They knew that the team would have to split up, like the first crew had done, in order to investigate the town and the area where the previous two teams had received as the original source of the anomalies that SHIELD had registered within their systems. One advantage that the Avengers had that neither of the two previous teams hadn’t, was that more than half of them were enhanced in some way. They’d decided that the non-enhanced would be partnered with an enhanced team member so that they would each have a better chance when they inevitably came into contact with whatever had caused members of both of the previous teams to virtually disappear.
Tony found himself wishing he had declined the stupid, gold-fringed invite that he had placed on his coffee table and forgotten about for a month after it had gotten buried under piles of cute works of art featuring Iron Man and his small adoring fans, before Pepper had rolled her eyes at him over lunch two days ago and asked him what he was planning on wearing. Tony had found himself replying with “obviously my new checked Tom Ford Prince of Wales” before he had paused to consider where he was going donned in his new checked Tom Ford Prince of Wales.
He smiles down at him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s middle. “I thought we were going to take this party upstairs,” Steve murmurs, nosing down Tony’s jaw.
Usually, Tony wouldn’t give a shit about being late to a meeting. When the only people whose time he would be wasting were ageing, white men with gaping bank accounts who all somehow had the misfortune of contracting male pattern baldness at the ripe ages of thirty-five and had a side of Viagra with every meal, Tony couldn’t bring himself to give a shit. Also, he was definitely not the only person who would be pulling up fifteen minutes late with Starbucks in hand.
