Warning: It was unplanned for, but there's potty talk in this chapter. It came as a surprise to everyone involved. Tags have been added.
Sherlock grunted in protest behind his pacifier, (his nippie, the ghost of Mrs. Holmes' voice chimed in,) but gradually rolled off the bed all the same, knowing Daddy was right. He studiously ignored the fact that he couldn't feel Daddy's hand when Daddy reached down to rub Sherlock's tummy to verify the state of his bladder. Instead, he blushed and arched just a bit into the nonexistent touch.
“Well, then.” John took another pull on his glass. “Gay colleagues.”
"Well. It's just--just weird. Sort of like being watched. All the time."
But ultimately, such an explanation could not be sustained. There were too many signs, too many patterns. The spiders had been everywhere, haunting the corners of every abandoned flat he had squatted in, skittering across every darkened alleyway shortcut. And everywhere, Moriarty's men had found him, as if drawn along by a silent silken thread. Sherlock had ruthlessly analyzed all of his failures to avoid detection, and while a handful of them might plausibly be attributed to some minuscule slip or a stroke of very bad luck, at least as many were absolutely airtight. It defied all logic that they should have found him every time. No other explanation would hold, under scrutiny. As reluctant as he had been to admit it, it was true.
He hadn’t played Satie in years. The slow, steady cascade of the Gymnopedie No. 1 was not challenging enough to force his thoughts into new patterns, but as he watched through the warm golden fall of light between them, he saw John sink lower in his chair, watched his breathing slow. Two minutes in John gave a loud snore, and then settled back without waking.
“Dunno.” Tap, tap, tap. “We’re all right, though, when you’re not trying to… be anybody.”
Those lovelorn notes into us bled,
"Molly, what's that on your arm?"
Though it is possible that Sherlock dropped the mug with the express purpose of drawing John's attention away from his book, this particular response is deeply annoying. There's nothing to fuss over. Of course it's not broken; even cheap pottery can stand to fall three inches onto a wooden table. There's no harm in a mug lying on its side for ten minutes.
“She resists,” he prompted. Flash-quick, John’s arms came up – faster than Mrs. Forsythe, no doubt, personal fitness regime notwithstanding, but Sherlock didn’t correct him, it wasn’t important – and grabbed Sherlock’s wrists while he mimed stomping down on the top of Sherlock’s right foot.
But he wasn’t gloating this time.
I met a lady at the gates
His hand was steady as he took hold of Sherlock’s clean, damp wrist, and the needle in his fingers did not shake. Sherlock bent over close to watch the stitchwork, fascinated as always.  His face safely above Sherlock’s sightlines, John bit his lip until he tasted blood.
“Sherlock?” John was staring at him inquiringly.
"Or what?" he asked.
John let him think during the cab ride. Sherlock pretended to put that time to good use, but there was nothing interesting about the facts he had, so he focused on controlling his face and his anticipation.
Sherlock was at his microscope and did not glance up. John was grateful, really. He dropped his coat on his chair and sighed. Sherlock did look up, then.
"Need to dry first," John says. His voice is even, if a bit curt.
“Angle’s wrong,” John said. “You need,” he swallowed, “to lean closer. Need to, ah, cut upward.” He took his own hands from the wall and moved Sherlock’s arm up against his throat. “Like this. S’only way to break windpipe in the right place.”
Sherlock's tea has gone cold. He tosses back the last half of it anyhow, then lets the empty mug drop to the side table.
It was clear from his face that he was ill at ease; John hated crowds, as he was happy to tell anyone, and also (although this was a struggle for him to say even to himself) rich people. But however he had felt, he certainly looked the part. Mycroft had ordered John a new suit for the occasion, and for once Sherlock could not find it in himself to resent the meddling. John’s old suit was off-the-rack – it had gaped at the lapels and bagged at the hips – and was not fit for public display. Sherlock had made this point before, but John had always dug in his heels. The difference, Sherlock supposed, was that this wasn’t one of John’s dates, but a high-profile gala where John was to mingle with impressive(-if-still-hateful) philanthropists and government dignitaries. Sometimes John benefitted from being pushed outside his comfort zone. This was one more piece in his (thin) file of evidence. He hoped he wasn’t theorizing before the facts.
Imperious baby is imperious. What did you expect.
"I'll be out in a few minutes," Sherlock promised, hoping his compliance was enough to deter John's focus.
In the cupboard she was bewildered to find what looked like a very oversized child's car seat. It barely fit into the cupboard in the first place and was difficult to get out.
When he came out, the hallway smelled of tea, tomatoes, and frying bacon.
Sherlock pretended it was John who rubbed the washcloth over his skin, who massaged the shampoo into his hair. It became easier as Daddy started murmuring to him about getting ready for bed and how sleepy Sherlock must have been after such a rough day. Daddy's little baby was going to be nice and dry in a few minutes, and then Daddy could help him into a diaper.
Only half joking, Mary asked, "That bad?"
Sherlock was sat on the floor, slouched beside the coffee table and mouthing at it. He gnawed on the edge of the wood single-mindedly until John rushed over and pulled him away from the table.
Also, my writing computer died last week, so updates and replies to comments are still going to be slower than a drunk snail.
I may have misused the word emulgent, but haven't found a better synonym. Meh.
This continued until even John could see Sherlock's mouth was getting dry. He set the half-eaten toast down and asked gently, "Can you take a sip of tea for me?"

John counted it a small victory that the cigarette went temporarily forgotten while Sherlock sulked the remainder of the day away in his room.
"... He's going to need a nappy."
Sherlock ran from the bags, down the hall, and into his room.
But, on the upside, it made John all the more eager to kick Mycroft out as quickly as possible and I didn't have to talk to my brother at all. Daddy told me to stay in my room and made sure Mycroft stayed well away.
Gracefully indignant, Sherlock plucked the cigarette from between his lips to gawp offendedly at his partner.
Caught completely off-guard, John and Mary shared a dumbfounded look over the mess.
Ordinarily I would use the additional awake time to get things done, but Daddy insists I have to stay in bed during the night. If I don't, Daddy says he's going to ask Mycroft for an alarm system that alerts Daddy's phone if I go further than the bathroom between the hours of eight and six.
(Though more are always nice!) ;3
Mary smirked at him, patting her belly, and chirped, "You make such a good Daddy."
John looked heavenward and silently asked,
Nearly bedtime now, so goodnight everyone. And perhaps in the interim between this and my next post, you might interest yourself in perusing my original blog with my work-related essays. It's obscene how many more views/hits this one has. Is no one the least bit curious how to detect the difference between the ash of a Havana cigar and and a corner store cigarillo? Nor whether the suspicious ash in your neighbour's rubbish bin is from a spliff or if they've been innocuously burning white sage?
It left him more or less on autopilot, his body cold and his thoughts detached from the rest of him. He stopped shivering, but his fingers and toes, unnoticed, began to turn slightly blue as his blood pressure dropped to conserve precious energy. In part, the cooling effect of the bathwater still evaporating out of his hair on an already chilly morning was also to blame.
On the upside, having Little-me to care for, John didn't get as astoundingly drunk as last year and didn't send New Year's Eve nudes to anyone's phone.
Lestrade or anyone thinking they can hack a copy of you-know-what, you're only getting a censored version. The uncensored original is backed up somewhere your best computer forensics tech would never reach it if they had all of the next century to try. You're welcome. Remember: what is seen cannot be unseen. I'm doing you a distinct favour. Can't have you weeping with envy next time John accompanies me to a crime scene, now, can we.
Sherlock took a sip of water. “Dinner.”
Of her ancestral crumbling home –
“All right?” Sherlock asked.
John nodded and began shoving at Sherlock’s torso, hard enough this time to move him backward. Sherlock leaned forward, concentrating on the balance of their two bodies. This moment was crucial.
Of course John would fixate on the simplest, stupidest definitions. “Obviously not,” he snapped. "Dates are when you buy a woman dinner and attempt to charm her into sleeping with you." This whole evening was a terrible idea. He had been stupid for trying it.
And then was gone.
•	experiencing emotions of some kind
Back at Baker Street, Sherlock went straight for the loo, where John’s patch-up jobs typically happened. John followed, pausing at the threshold.
“I’m so sorry, do excuse me,” Sherlock said, interrupting whatever worthless thing the man was on about, “my boyfriend’s fetched us some wine, and there was somebody he’d been hoping to introduce….”
Lestrade and Donovan had different theories. This was typical. Less typical was the fact that, even after three minutes inspecting the murder site, Sherlock had to acknowledge that both theories were possible.
Sherlock’s funeral was day three. Molly, dressed in black, cast an apprehensive look at him on her way out the door. When she returned three hours later, she was red-eyed and tight-lipped and did not look at him at all.
John finished his second glass of wine. “Yeah,” he said, with some venom. “Sometimes not. You’re the bloody mind reader, you figure it out.”
John’s pulse was high, and his breath was coming short. It had been a very brief sprint to the shelves, and the warehouse interior was quite cool, if not so cold as the outside, and John’s body had had several minutes to adjust. Hormones, then. A strange suspicion crackled in the back of Sherlock’s mind. But no, there were too many uncertainties.
John stood on the front stoop for nearly two minutes, doing the breathing exercises, but the door still slammed when he closed it, and he still swore at the sudden crack of it echoing in the vestibule. It was too small, too dusty, the entire building felt oppressive hulking over him. Walking felt like the only thing his body knew how to do. But he had stopped moving, and the pain had crept into his leg and wouldn’t let go. He took the steps gingerly.
Silence. He found himself repeating, idiotically:  “Yes.”
The lower shelves on either side of them were mostly full with crates of different sizes, and the empty spots seemed to stand out like missing teeth. Sherlock crept down the length of the shelf, calculating their options, when John waved him back to look at one in particular. Sherlock looked. The space to the left was wide and empty; far too exposed to be a good hiding place. But the crate itself was tall and narrow, and likely unusually heavy, since it was parked on the very lip of the shelf.
“Halligan’s men jumped you. ”
I came upon the bundled leaves
Postulate: John was, now, himself in a state of previously-undiagnosed distress.
"I am grateful," he said. "For your help... before."
But when John had forgiven him, clutched Sherlock's hand in his own and wept and spoken of all the things he had carried in his heart since that false funeral, then Sherlock had hoped. Hoped that with love and forgiveness would come understanding.
“All right.” John suddenly looked very tired. “Then what is it?”
John’s still form went electric under Sherlock’s hand: mistake. Abort. But lightning-fast, before Sherlock could move, John seized Sherlock’s wrist, held Sherlock’s hand to his shoulder as if forcing it to take root.
"It's been--weird. Here. Since."
"Wait," said Boss, through the earpiece. "Give them a moment."
"Your assistance has been--" his voice trailed off as he searched for the words.
Sherlock relaxed. They were well-hidden. Even if they were eventually found, they would retain the element of surprise over the individual who discovered them. It would be a dull wait, and John would likely want to leave as soon as they were able, so Sherlock set himself, again, to gathering what data he could. He tipped his head back and breathed in.
It didn't matter, or not enough to tell Molly. He was an idiot. These weeks had been a failure. Worse, a kaleidoscopic unravelling. Molly didn't need to know. Nobody needed to know.
saw it. But you couldn’t wait, could you?”
The fact that Sherlock had nearly died properly by an assassin's gun three days ago, half a moment after their eyes first met, seemed only to have sharpened John's simmering fury. That was somewhat confusing, as well as unjust. Of course Sherlock hadn't known that Moriarty would have stationed an assassin by John's ugly little house. But then, he ought to have suspected, hadn't he, given what he'd seen the past few weeks? Stupid.
exactly
Wordlessly, Sherlock offered John another canapé and then put the plate down on the sideboard and went over to chuck another log on the fire. They could hear Agatha coming back down as she passed Lucia on the stairs. “Is Sherlock down there?” she said loudly to Lucia. “I need one of his special G&T’s!”
“She’s a nice little cat!” added Siger. “Part Persian, from the look of her fur!”
a girlfriend. Now, do you want this massage or not? Like I said, Take it or leave it."
“Well, I would be," remarked Gabriella simply, "proud, I mean," and now to Sherlock, she said, “but that’s still simply amazing! How did you know, Mr. Holmes? And for that matter, tell me how you knew about me?”
If you haven’t seen it, you need to do so. It’s a Merchant Ivory film; if that means anything to you! These are two directors known for excellent period drama with stunning cinematography, and it’s a beautiful story, beautifully told. It stars Hugh Grant, James Wilby and Rupert Graves, all aged around 25. Watch it. You will adore it. A period gay love story with a Happy Ending. Write me a message in the comments when you’ve seen it. Write me another message when you recognise the line which I have - quite frankly - stolen straight from Rupert Graves’ mouth (he plays Alec Scudder in the film) and in both the film and the book, he says that line to his lover, Maurice Hall. I have (totally shamelessly) given him the line to say to Mycroft in my story. Sorry, not sorry, no offence taken, carry on, as you were, etc etc… ;)
"Think about it. What do I do all the time? I can’t stop myself…I know a lot about you that you don't think I know about," said Sherlock, looking straight at John. He paused for a second, then added, “I know a lot about you that you don't yet know about yourself.” He said it strangely, like it was almost a guilty confession.
A month later, they were actually out on a case together but had been separated when their two suspects had split up halfway through a chase. John had yelled an instruction to Sherlock as he shot off after one of the suspects and so Sherlock went after the other one. It was like living in a 'Carry-On' film sometimes, thought John, panting with exertion and really pushing to keep up as he tailed his suspect closely through the lower floor of an underground car park, while Sherlock chased his suspect on the floor above.
and then just
“So what were you lookin’ at, at the party, then? said Greg, suddenly, thinking of his note. He lifted his own nearly empty glass again and drank, watching Mycroft as carefully as Mycroft had watched him.
Greg thought, desire building in his stomach like heat rising. “Well?” he repeated softly, teasingly.
John's phone started ringing then and he glanced at the screen. It was Lestrade. John tapped 'answer' with his thumb and pressed the phone to his ear automatically, but he was looking at Sherlock, who continued to look back at him with an unreadable expression.
him or not. Why would he care? But John was…
whimpered John vaguely, looking down and rubbing his forehead, so much more than just slightly flustered now. His erection had begun to make itself very undeniably known. He shifted in his seat again and took a short, sharp breath. "There's something going on here with us right now and I don't quite know how to handle it," John admitted.
They were not seen by a teenager fresh out of medical school. They got through triage quickly (mid morning Wednesdays were never that popular, after all) and they were seen fairly fast by an experienced surgeon covering an A&E shift. John was gratified to see that she was very, very competent and very, very efficient. The Stanley knife had not pierced Sherlock's lung tissue, all major arteries and veins were intact and there was no nerve damage, so thankfully it was all ok. The contusion to John's head was examined and he was carefully checked and pronounced ok too, but that wasn't really what he had been worried about anyway.
Agatha dumped some tea leaves and the boiled water in the teapot and began to stir it rather vigorously.
“Oh, a cup of Yorkshire please,” said Mycroft gratefully, “it’s my favourite brand of tea. I’m almost unable to function without a good cup of Yorkshire to start with.”
As she shut the door, Mycroft was coming to the end of his mental list of all the possible letter-writers of his acquaintance and was still none the wiser, so he picked it up and sniffed it. Nothing. Nothing of note anyway, just paper, so he reached for his letter opener and opened it. A single sheet of fairly nondescript white A4 paper was inside, and in the same scruffy but rather intriguing handwriting as the envelope, read the words, “I’ve seen you looking. Why don't you find out what you’d like to know? Constantine’s tonight at 8.”
“Zac?” he asked innocently, as if just merely vaguely interested and not looking up from his menu.
Sherlock coughed discreetly in the background.
…in Gregory Lestrade’s really quite beautiful bed, in his really quite messy bedroom, and his usually really quite stoic and sedate little heart simply
stuff right now, but this’ll do.”
Greg moved in then, deliberately slowly, planting one polished, chocolate-brown Cheaney boot on either side of Mycroft’s shiny black Oxford brogues. “And I'm not joking around now, I mean it,” he continued. “What else can I do to please you, Mycroft?” His voice was a dark, seductive whisper and Mycroft could barely breathe.
yer to!” he blurted out cheerfully, making Mycroft smile again. Honesty, flirtation, swearing and now all this wild, reckless abandon. He was in
As John pulled Agatha up, Sherlock barged into the study to get Mycroft off his phone - as instructed by his mother - banging the door open rather unnecessarily loudly and without bothering to knock first. Over the noise of Sherlock bursting into the room, John heard Mycroft jump, his chair creaking sharply, before he snapped irritably,
Notes:
Sherlock went pink. And coughed a bit. Actually saying it to each other was still an extremely new and rare event. “Ah. That’s…er…quite a bit, then,” replied Sherlock with a slowly broadening grin. John could see how pleased he was about everything. “That’s good,” he said, then, studying John and the scarf,  “I knew it would really suit you. It does. It really brings out the colour of your eyes.”
going. If I'm destined to die by your side, I'll do it, gladly, but not because some idiot has smacked me over the back of the head and and caused a bleed on my brain so I die suddenly of a brain haemorrhage whilst you slowly suffocate next to me from a spontaneous pneumothorax."
“It’s no trouble, John,” said Mycroft calmly, filling the kettle at the sink. “It’s been at least an hour - some of us desperately need more tea, I can assure you.”
Gabriella was shaking her head at all of this, not in disagreement, but in amazement. Sherlock acknowledged her with a simple hand gesture and carried on, “The gallery owner remarked that you had both used the phrase
He glanced back down at the note again to take in the contents properly. “Jesus Christ! You forged a note from Greg to invite Mycroft to meet him?!
(See the end of the chapter for
Anyway, I'm feeling much better this week and Daddy has been letting me watch loads of Pingu to pass the time. It appears John has caught on that programmes which don't rely on defined aural language are more effective at putting me into Little space than are other children's shows.
Eventually, he heard John rise. Sherlock thought nothing of it until he heard the
Sorry, everyone; I was going to put up another photo-based chapter today but saw that Photobucket made a change to their hosting parameters. Since I have a free account, my images are now blocked from outside linking. I'm going to be looking into hosting alternatives soon, possibly something like Pixlr or ImageShack. If anyone has tips on which of these is better when it comes to outside linking, or has another free hosting site to recommend, your input is appreciated!
Sherlock, stunned that he hadn't had to ask for it, and subconsciously analysing what it might mean that John went this far to make him eat, gawked at it and meekly opened his mouth for John.
"Let's hope that headache is gone when the morning comes," Mary quipped and took a sip of the tea Mrs. Hudson had given her.
RPS warning for this chapter! If you don't like Real Person Slash, don't read this one.
"That's it..." John smiled as he watched Sherlock suck at it much as he would his bottle.
Exaggerated sigh. Long day.
Like he wasn't already.
"Here, can you finish your bottle for me? When you're finished we can have a cuddle," he bribed, feeling more and more self-conscious in front of Mary.
"NOOO!" Sherlock hollered. He kicked at the floor for emphasis, smacking his thigh into John's armpit and nearly dislodging him.
For a minute, Sherlock just stood rooted to the spot, eyes narrowed and looking as though he was mentally reading through an all-inclusive handbook on ways to murder John.
He took his pacifier and wiggled under the blankets. He snuggled up to Hippie, a well-worn terrycloth bunny that was as old as he was (and so named because, being a bunny, he hippy-hopped). Now that he was full grown, Hippie was only a tiny bit bigger than his hand. He held it to his chest and focussed on trying to relax. When he was ready to turn onto his stomach and sleep, he would set his nippy-nip and the fragile stuffed bunny on the nightstand.
To complicate things, Sherlock had different standards for urine and solids. He refused to do the latter in a diaper, and gave John hell when it came to doing the former in the toilet. John had even caught him weeing in the bathtub outside of actual bath-time just to avoid it.
Sherlock squinted guiltily up at Daddy when the doors were opened. He sat in the bottom of the wardrobe, his bare butt crushing some expensive-looking shoes.
Speaking of caterpillars, Mycroft told me a few days prior that they dissolve into goo in the pupa stage before they reform as moths or butterflies, and only their brains and memories carry over from their caterpillar body. Everything else goes gooshy. That was interesting to ponder while falling back asleep in the blankie cocoon.
No; on second thought, I'm very sure he won't do it again. Not after how my nappies have been lately.
cranky today, and there was nothing for it.
Sherlock's robe and underwear were quickly a wrinkled pile on the floor. Pretend-John raised a condescending eyebrow at his little one, though, which stopped Sherlock from stepping into the tub.
God knows why, but whatshisface managed to book the dinner at a musty old estate out in the middle of nowhere, which forced more than half the attendees to stay overnight in nearby hotels because the drive out there was so ridiculously long.
He shook himself out of it after John waltzed into his imaginary version of the room, beaming at him where he sat in the crib and reaching over the rail to hug him.
Love, in his generation of the Holmes family, was a word the kids heard precisely once a day at bedtime until Sherlock was given his own small bedroom in the remodelled basement. Beyond that, it went unspoken if it existed at all. Completing studies on time and playing quietly after Dad got home and finishing all of dinner to avoid Mummy's consequences were the important things. Affection ranked much lower.
The idea for this one did come to me during a smoke. :b
He knew it would hurt so much more if John failed in that, but... he wouldn't find out how this would end without a leap of faith.
"A'nuvver toad!" John heard Sherlock call, again from behind him.
"There's no reasonable way this -" Sherlock held his smoke aloft in demonstration, "- is the same size."
Mary rolled the prepared IV pole close to the cot.
Bouncing him on his knee a bit, John said, "I guess that's a yes. How about you go fold the laundry and bring it up, like you were supposed to do, and while you do that Daddy will set up your Little stuff. Yeah?"
Mary stopped in her tracks, hand on the doorknob. She said, "
The acknowledgement of how ingrained the need was, how far gone he would appear to an onlooker, and of how far out of reach that put the rest of the world was what finally spilled out his tears. The dam burst as his long fingers fumbled about in the bedside stand. He found the cheery cherry-red plastic guard by feel, his vision too wet, and popped the oversized rubber nipple between his lips.
Reminder to self: we're out of bubble bath. Need to remind John to pick some up. Should perhaps emphasise that it could help remove the last of the turmeric stains from the bathtub.
"Sherlock?"
for four days, yeah, I have to stay. I don't know how you managed him alone the last time."
Mary still keeps in touch, so John tells me. It sounds as though she's happy enough with her new life. I can't elaborate any more than that, but there it is.
"Thanks, sorry about that." John explained as Mary gingerly took the clothing from him, "I'm going to give the crack baby a bath now. It's his own fault he won't get breakfast for another twenty minutes."
It was his brand new yellow tee shirt with a big, smiling, screen-printed bee on the front, only now with much less screen-printed bee.
"I'm good to go now, if you are," Mary replied, already tucking the blanket into the position they'd need it in to move him.
Greg withdrew one of the bent - but luckily not broken - cigarettes and tucked it between his lips, closing the crumpled packet and then reaching over to place it on the bedside table on the tea tray. He ran a hand through his hair, leaving it no less tousled than it had been before, and making Mycroft smile. Mycroft knew, as a failing ex-ex-smoker himself, that right now Greg was relishing the feel and the smell and the sudden relief of having some cigarettes at his disposal again. It felt like such luxury to suddenly find one when you were desperate and thought you were all out. Mycroft looked longingly at the smooth brown skin of his back and shoulders, thought about how he must look with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and marvelled once again at his luck.
Sherlock looked at those gently curving lips and his heart leapt with an unashamed joy and desire of his own.
Sherlock said nothing, holding his hands behind his back and waiting patiently for the denouement. She put her brush down carefully again into the little furrow on the easel,  making a decision, John thought.
He followed Sherlock down the hallway to the very next door along, which stood slightly ajar, and as Sherlock pushed the door open, John followed him in. “Wow!” he said quietly, as he entered the room.
"Yeah, we're ok," replied John. "Speak to you later," and he hung up.
He heard Mycroft in the study say clearly, “Oh,
John actually laughed a little at that. “ I definitely think you got the better deal,” he said, grinning at his friend.
Greg twisted round a little then, to look full at his lover behind him. Yes, Mycroft saw, charmed, the unlit cigarette in his mouth definitely made him look more than just a bit James Dean. “Er….do you
John made a short, high pitched wavering noise in his throat, much like one a small rodent might make when trapped in a corner by an as-yet-undecided cat; a cat whose tail had just started to flick back and forth while it made up its mind. Sherlock would know instantly if John was lying. “Ummm-ah, yeah. Yeah, I did...I did. Yeah.”
On the narrow confines of the sofa, John did as he was bid. He kissed Sherlock; on his mouth, on his neck, on his chest and eventually, John slid down on to the floor on one knee to be able to reach his stomach. He kissed Sherlock, licked him, bit him, everywhere he he reach, he caressed it with his mouth. And Sherlock, the most emotionally contained person that John had ever met - except perhaps for himself - let himself be lost to John. He let John take him over, because it was so clearly what John needed to do at that moment, and who was Sherlock to stop him? 'Plenty of time to reverse the roles later,' he thought, once, briefly, when thinking was still a viable option. And then thinking went somewhere else and he could only feel John’s lips and mouth and hands on his body, and respond to him without thought. Suddenly, John stopped what he was doing, which at that moment involved tracing hot promises on Sherlock's neck with his tongue and teeth, and he drew back to look into Sherlock's eyes. The moment he did so he knew what he wanted next. “I want more than this,” he said simply, hungrily.
‘First things first,’ thought John and he filled the kettle and switched it on, chose two cups from the cupboard and set them out. "Come on then, let's have a look," he called through to Sherlock, thinking that while the kettle boiled he'd make a preliminary assessment. He went through from the kitchen to the sitting room, where Sherlock had dumped his coat on the back of John’s armchair and was standing in the middle of the room, rolling his neck awkwardly. "Stop doing that… right; shirt off, come into the light," instructed John. Sherlock immediately started to undo his shirt and folded back the collar of it to drop it down, draping it over his left shoulder and exposing the shoulder and the base of his neck.

Agatha gave a loud hoot of laughter.

'What?' thought John,
Now, John Watson had absolutely nothing against swearing - on the contrary, he really liked a good swear. Always had done. It relieved tension, for one thing. It could sometimes be amusing. Different situations clearly called for different swear-words. He also sometimes rather liked to swear his appreciation quite enthusiastically during sex, which was naturally something that people would only know about John Watson if they’d been on particularly friendly terms with him, but hearing Sherlock say all those words… It had quite effectively done something to John that it had had no business at all doing.
There was a flirtatious challenge in Gregory’s dark eyes. He was seeing how far he could go.
“It's
He squeezed Mycroft’s hand briefly and then brought their clasped hands across his lap slightly, higher up onto his mid thigh, so that they could relax their arms comfortably as they rode along. Against his exposed wrist, Mycroft could feel the heat of Greg’s thigh through the fabric of his trousers.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft like a younger sibling being dared to do something by their older sibling.

John sat up, very upright indeed, shoulders back, expression firm, and - erection or not - he fixed Sherlock with a steely dark-blue gaze. He adopted the voice that his non-army friends used to jokingly refer to as his ‘Captain Watson’ voice. “Ok, Sherlock,” he said briskly, “I think it’s high time I had some words with you, in a manner of speaking…and those words are going to be upstairs in my bedroom…” He kept his face completely straight, but allowed the humour to show in his eyes. “…Several words, in fact…quite possibly on, or even in, my bed…” He kept his eyes on Sherlock but tipped his head once to clearly indicate the direction of said bedroom. “…So get yourself up there, sharpish.
to which Siger bellowed,
Considering the near icy cold conditions last night, the sun was clearly trying really hard to make up for it this morning. Greg stood in the gap of the slightly open balcony door, in the weak but very welcome early morning sunlight, and bent his head, cupping his palms up to his mouth to light his cigarette. Once lit, he kept hold of the lighter between his first two fingers and wrapped his arms around himself, rubbing his upper arms both at once. Mycroft watched him, amused, as Greg tipped his face upwards towards the sun and closed his eyes as he took in the first really deep big drag and then, without taking Sherlock’s stolen cigarette from his mouth, held it between his teeth and exhaled the smoke around it with very obvious relish.
with him, then he would have realised it at that moment with the strong steady pulse of his heart and the sweet swelling ache in his chest.
"No, mud on the canvas, but
But he had already known what now.
Sherlock looked up from the obituary page of The Times. “What?" he snapped.
“I enjoy cooking, John,’ Siger said genuinely, when John asked him about it. “…It’s very relaxing, I find…” he added, and he took a big hearty sip of his wine as he stirred the gravy. Lucia and he were making it a few hours ahead of the evening meal, he explained to John, so they could spend less time cooking away from everyone later in the evening. They were using a huge roasting tray to make it in, with stock, flour and various vegetables that had already been roasted in the oven.
Sherlock's eyes brightened and he bounced on the balls of his bare feet. He was so relieved to see Daddy, so glad he was able to conjure him back after getting too wound up earlier.
Sherlock ignored him again.
Stopped nervously outside the bathroom door, sheepishly Sherlock muttered, "I forgot."
"Okay," John warily let go of his legs, patted his shin, "I'll be right back."
. I am a jealous baby. Thou shalt have no other babies before me.
"Sherlock?" John called through the door, "Are you up?"
John gave him the bottle next, musing to himself it was a good thing he'd already planned to give Sherlock gripe water; it would prevent gassiness later on as Sherlock's gut was reintroduced to semisolids after days of nothing but tea and peripheral nicotine.
It made sense at the time.
John tried in a tactful, paternal tone, "Let's not poke at him, Sherlock. I'm sure he doesn't think that's nice."
John found the Union Jack pillow and handed it to her so that she could cushion her head and settle back.
, which John had somewhat anticipated. This certainly wasn't the first time.
Not to mention the issue John would take if Sherlock dug out the cocaine. In addition to which there were the dregs of a few other interesting substances acquired on old cases and forays into the seedier side of his informant network.
Hopefully recent experience has also taught him for the future that scheduling me for a dentist appointment against my will automatically instigates a game of hide-and-seek that he is incapable of winning until said appointment is cancelled or missed.
When Mary came back upstairs, the diaper change was over and done with.
. Your 'in a minute' means three hours from now, and we both know it. Up."
He would try to cheer Sherlock up tonight with an especially appreciative worshipping of Sherlock's entire eight point ninety-two centimetres of bliss. Rounded up to nine, of course.
Sherlock managed to turn his head just a little toward the sound of those voices. The friction on the blanket released the scent of baby shampoo, evidently used on him earlier. Sherlock realised his hair still felt a touch damp, and an all-over clammy sensation suggested he'd been recently bathed. He shivered inside the swaddling.
John surprised him by following along to Sherlock's bedroom and flipping on the light for him.
Sighing, "I'm sorry, Sherlock, but you can't take those off," John positioned each of Sherlock's arms in turn near the sides of the cot and fastened the padded cuffs around slender wrists.
He plopped himself down on the kitchen linoleum near the entry door that led to the landing at the top of the seventeen steps and waited patiently for Daddy to bring dinner, fingering the red nippie he tucked in his dressing gown pocket for comfort. He still thought biscuits made a fine meal. But he supposed they did lack protein. He grudgingly made peace with Daddy bringing him chicken, so long as there was plenty of sauce to cover it.
He locked the door and sank down to the carpet. He found his nippie on the bookshelf, popped it in, and sucked on it thoughtfully. The best course of action seemed to be to wait until John went to bed that night, then sneak out for a bubble bath and playtime with his tub toys, and then he could settle in for the night all clean in a fresh, dry diaper and one of his legless onesies. As long as John didn't try to pester him into coming out for dinner, said plan would go off without a hitch, and if he woke up 'big' tomorrow he could face John pretending nothing happened today like it had.
John smiled fondly as Sherlock blushed.
With the already messed up state Sherlock's mind was in, the conversation he'd just absorbed despite not really listening slowly re-pieced itself just below some conscious threshold and its meaning sank in in a very emotional way, instead of the literal, analytical, more tangible way it should have.
"Right, just... let's focus on getting him through the detox first. We can discuss the immensity of his stupidity later."
Martin sighed again, a heaving, exasperated one this time.
He eased Sherlock up onto the sofa with him, beside Mary. He sat them so that Sherlock could snuggle into his side, half across his lap and half supported by the corner of the backrest and armrest.
"Ah-ah-ah! No, Sherlock," John tutted, whisking his arm out of reach. "No biting."
Sherlock linked their pinkie fingers together and swung his arm. "Mm... Okay."
- and, second to last but not least, my New Year's Resolution has been fulfilled. I will officially be in hiding until John's wrath subsides.
Daddy shut me in my room as soon as we got back so he could make multiple phone calls without me listening in.
"Do you want your dummy?" John asked, picking up the red one on the nightstand.
"Mm-hm," Sherlock agreed, still sounding depressed. He sniffled loudly right next to John's ear.
They were all quiet until, frowning in deep concern, Mary pointed to Sherlock's nearer wrist, indicating both wrists with her eyes, and asked John under her breath as if it would prevent Sherlock from understanding,
John gave him a look and shook his head. "Let's just stay out here and have a nice meal together, hm?" he implored gently.
John sounded frighteningly like Sherlock's mother when he said that. It made Sherlock stop in his tracks for a moment, legs locked and gut churning with a short-lived surge of fear as his body ached with the muscle-memory of being sent to bed so often in pain with an overfull stomach, not having been allowed to leave the dinner table until his plate was mostly clean lest Mummy impose punishment involving retraction of his few childhood freedoms.
John switched off the stove, saying again as he plated up the last of breakfast, "Go on. Go get dressed, then come back and eat."
Pretend-John leaned in the doorway and smiled adoringly, watching his boy having fun.
The main SLB fic is very image-heavy, and recently Photobucket, which I use for image hosting, cut off third-party link services for their free users. I'm hoping to find an alternative hosting site soon so I can fix the broken links in the other fic, but until I get that resolved that fic is unfortunately on hold. The corresponding chapter I was going to post today was also a photo-based chapter.
is most telling."
"Put!" Sherlock told him, as if that would clarify things.
John couldn't know the irony in his words.
Comments make me smile!  Even if I can't read/reply to them right away. Thanks for sticking with me through the long hiatuses!
They ate in silence until, about halfway through the meal, John tried tentatively, "Do you think you'll eat something tomorrow, Sherlock? Now that the case is over?"
"Here; I can take your jumper to--" Mary began to approach to help John strip the pee-stained oatmeal jumper off, but stopped short when Sherlock visibly flinched.
"Water," John elaborated, "'so you aren't dehydrated from all the walking we just did."
John's main goal was to make Sherlock comfortable enough (or wait it out until he was exhausted enough) that he'd get eight consecutive hours or more of sleep, as lack of the same was largely to blame for taking him down. It was very likely that this illness would clear up very soon once Sherlock slept.
Immediately jumping to his own defence, Sherlock blurted, "I haven't touched it. It's still..." He turned once more to glare in a way that John knew meant he was simultaneously impressed with John's sneakiness and mortified he'd walked right into it. "Oh."
Before they replaced the top on the incubator, John taped a small core temperature sensor to the skin of Sherlock's belly.
So, instead, John manoeuvred Sherlock to sit and tucked the necessary bits into the bowl for him.
John gathered up the dishes when they finished and set about rinsing them in the sink. Sherlock sat back and wrapped his dressing gown tighter, listening half to the rush of the faucet and half to the imaginary buzz of his thinking colliding with John's someplace in the empty air between them.
"Oh, very good," there was Sherlock's cheerful-mocking tone usually reserved for Lestrade's team, "you figured that one out quickly!"
Sherlock's fingers curled around John's in a weak but consistent fist. John received the same reaction from Sherlock's other hand as well.
John huffed through his nose, anger flaring. "Yeah, could we not bring that up again?"
Sherlock moaned happily around his dummy. It turned into a mew of surprise when the doctor turned Sherlock's head gently and slid the plastic-sheathed probe of a tympanic thermometer into Sherlock's ear.
Paper window shades in the already heavily tinted windows kept the car surprisingly cool, and John and Sherlock settled comfortably into the backseat.
A hint of a contented smile played across Sherlock's lips, and his eyes glazed over as if hypnotised.
The stick entering Sherlock was smaller, but didn't feel as nice as Daddy's fingers. Sherlock considered the feeling, scrunching his nose.
Because John was pretty sure Sherlock wouldn't fight him on having a kip today.
Sherlock clapped, gave an excited little jump, and ran ahead a bit. But, as usual for his Little headspace, he didn't run very far before he felt the need to check that Daddy was still behind him, and wait patiently for Daddy to catch up.
At the same time, Sherlock instinctively opened his mouth in response to Mary's touch. She quickly turned his head back toward her and tried again to help him latch on.
would
John, encouraged that Sherlock at least hasn't dumped it out in the sink already, sipped at his own and tried to coax him, "You can pick it out, that's fine."
4. If I can't walk through the kitchen without sneezing, it probably means one of my experiments moulded over.
Let's just say I think Mrs. Hudson needs to use her reading glasses more often.
I did manage to wake up before John on the second of the month and slip in a cup of coffee before he was anywhere near the kitchen. I've sort of become re-addicted to coffee in the past few weeks, which Daddy's not happy about. He complains about it quite a lot, in fact. The effects of that level of caffeine aren't predictable; some nights I'll lie awake until dawn, other nights I'll fall asleep by ten but wake up at two a.m. and remain awake.
John turned around on the heavily-wooded nature trail to look back at Sherlock. They were headed up a slight incline with a bit of a drop off to the left-hand side, and Little Sherlock lagged behind John for having constantly been peering down around his feet in order to stay safe.
Like a shot, Sherlock was up and walking at John's side. It wasn't very far now to the paved path along the road through the centre of the park. Once they reached that, it was a left turn and less than five minutes more until the picnic pavilion and the swingset.
"Da-YEEEE!" Sherlock suddenly screamed, arcing his back once more. The seat's straps, thankfully, held.
talk about this tomorrow, Sherlock, if you still want to." John promised with a pensively terse but warm smile, "I do not think
"What is it, baby?" John asked his little one.
John was left to hold his chin in his hand and drum his fingers on the table and wonder why the hell he even bothered.
John moved in to hug him again. Sherlock felt the doctor stiffen against him, and then John drew back with a frightfully concerned look that confused Sherlock.
Also to highlight the slightly absurd fact that Sherlock had technically peed in John's lap.
Sorry for not replying to comments yet. Still strapped for time! Thanks to everyone reading/reviewing!
"Per se--"
In light of Sherlock's mental state, John opted to give him an infant bath instead of the usual toddler-style one. He laid Sherlock flat in the tub, head rested on a thin foam bath pillow shaped like a turtle. Sherlock's long legs had to be bent up to fit, his heels up on the rim of the tub on either side of the taps. John gave him only one toy, and made sure it was a soft, teething-friendly one.
, and the both of you act as if it doesn't happen."
Benedict just stood pouting down at him, swaying slightly on his feet.
Once again, the harsh reality outside his head made Sherlock cry. He was able to staunch it, but not before a few fat tears rolled down each cheek and collected under his chin. He was grateful all over again that he and John couldn't see each other's faces.
They sat a moment in awkward silence. Sherlock wasn't sure what to say to someone like Molly, in this setting. With Mycroft, there was always some form of sniping called for, and with John Sherlock somehow never worried about what to say. But here was Molly, obdurately present. She looked tired and drawn.
“Yeah.” John tugged at the tails of his cardigan, eyes still on the floor. “Now we know.”
"Oh do get on with it, I'm not a child," Sherlock snapped.
John dodged a late-breaking stray elbow and slipped into the pocket of space next to Sherlock. “Christ, what a trial that was.” He held out the glass. “Was he the…?”
"Yes." Sherlock watched her face as she scrubbed, pinched brows and tight-pressed lips, and considered that maybe that was not, after all, that.
The lowering sun casts golden-pink scarves of light through the windows of Baker Street, which blend with the amber-gold of the lamps. There are more of them now, a lamp in every corner of the room. Ever since they changed out the drapes and gave a proper cleaning to the corners, the flat holds on to the light of evening a little longer than it used to. Sherlock sits in his chair, basking in the imagined warmth. John emerges from their shared bedroom, carrying the novel he’d left on his bedside table the night before.
John had suffered terribly while he was away, Sherlock knew that. It only would have been worse if he had in fact managed to elude the network of spiders, because it would have taken years to eliminate all the traces of Moriarty's human network.
But even the extraordinary John Watson had limits, Sherlock thought, watching the descending sun paint rose-gold into John's hair. Whenever Sherlock tried to explain how it had been, the fount of spiders from the dumpster in Amsterdam or the hail of tarantulas from the inn ceiling in Belgrade, something in John's eyes went dim, and he turned away.
“Good enough,” John said. He draped his coat across his chair and faced Sherlock in parade rest. “Shall I be Mrs. Forsythe or the murderer?”
It had seemed like the worst thing, before, that John should believe Sherlock was losing control of his rational faculties. What was the point of returning to London -- what was the point of anything -- if Sherlock’s star had gone dim in John’s eyes?
“Praggya’s parents will be relieved,” snapped Sherlock.
“So now I, ah, push you back to the wall.” Together they walked carefully across the floor, while John rained pretend blows on Sherlock’s chest and forearms, to give Sherlock a map of where to inspect Walters and Creighton for recent bruising. John’s touch was light. It might have been better, Sherlock thought, if he had been hitting hard enough to hurt.
“You pretend too,” Sherlock said sourly.
“Like this,” he whispered.
Though tenebrous, the vapor of
It wasn’t often that Sherlock was wrong. And if John usually gloated a bit (could you even say “usually” about something that had happened thrice in two years?) well, he reckoned that anyone who knew Sherlock would understand.
“Get your coat,” Sherlock said, and hoped it would be enough. It usually was.
“Let’s take a look at those sheds,” Sherlock said. “That’s most likely where….”
A hot, close buzzing replaced the spacious silence, and in the half-second it took Sherlock to place the sound, the lights came on.
But Molly was here, not John. Sherlock's preferences had not come into it.
"I've got a clean kill shot now," she muttered, an eye on the scope.
"I'd better stitch it up," she said. Then, wincing apologetically, "it will sting a bit, I'm sorry."
He looked at her, then.
“Still,” he said – and wasn’t it strange, they had been laughing only a moment before, but now everything was wound tight again – “now we know.”
John’s back hit the wall, and Sherlock laid his right forearm across John’s neck with careful, needle-sharp precision. John went absolutely still.
“Fine, fine!” boomed Lord Bloviator as John joined them. “I don’t mean to detain you! Parties are for the young, after all,” he added, winking broadly. Sherlock gave him an insipid smile and turned to meet John.
And made the most of stolen heat
Sherlock picked up his fork and twiddled it. “I… care.”
Of course Sherlock realized it didn't actually make sense. It was, in point of fact, a phenomenon that contradicted all of one's prior deductions and inferences. So far outside the scope of rational conjecture that he couldn't really fault John for his failure to follow the thread. There was no evidence on record (and Sherlock had looked) of spiders displaying high-level social organization or otherwise behaving in a manner that indicated sentience; still less that they might do so at the direction of a dead criminal mastermind.
John gave a tiny nod but kept standing, intensely still.
Improbable wasn't the half of it. A global association of spiders, carrying on Jim Moriarty's work after his death? Sherlock could barely tolerate the fact that he was entertaining so ludicrous an explanation, let alone that he had disclosed it to John. But his own observations rendered any other explanation impossible.
Of a love gone cold.
“So how is… your novel?”
He stared at the wall as she changed out the dressings, affecting disinterest to mask the pain. He would be deep in his Mind Palace right now if he could muster the concentration.
John does not stir.
"Weird how?" He shifted in the narrow bed.
John drew in a breath. It was noisy, the way John’s breathing always was when he was angry and trying not to show it. It always reminded Sherlock of a hoover, but that felt like new information every time, because he never knew where to store it.
The weight of it was settling into place. He would have to go back into his Mind Palace when she left, move those most horrible of memories from the past few months back out of the dark hallways and back into the room labeled "Moriarty." A room he had only just locked and sealed off--but lightly, insecurely. He had never really believed it was over.
******
“What…” John paused and searched for words, the way he often did. It was incredibly irritating. “What sort of experiment is it?”
"Tea?" he asks, quietly.
John still kisses him, most nights, before they go to sleep. It's more than Sherlock had ever dared hope for, more than he had realized, for so long, that he wanted. And somehow, Sherlock feels as if John is farther away than he has ever been.
Sherlock looked down at his lap. “Call it a failed experiment.”
He and John stared at each other, caught out in the bright fluorescent wash. The voices – seven men, mid-twenties to early forties, all native Spanish speakers but four were fully bilingual, one was a smoker,
But not if the spider theory is just a game, a joke at John's expense, another deception. The possibility, once it had occurred to John, had been impossible for John to shake off.
"Molly," said Sherlock, his voice gone hoarse.
“Planned that well, did you? Cheers.” John pulled the last stitch tight with a painful jerk and craned his neck to the side so that he could see the knot he was tying without blocking his own light. Surgical knots were delicate work, and Sherlock could hear John’s breathing slow as he focused on manipulating the tiny thread.
"There you go," Molly said, pressing the last bit of tape onto his forearm. "That's all of them, I think."
“I don’t think boyfriends have to touch each other all the time, Sherlock,” John said as they made their way across the room.
John cut the thread and began tucking his supplies back into his kit. “Well, you’ll have a nice scar. Maybe it will remind you to wait for me next time before taking a swing at a serial killer.” John stood and rolled his shoulders, and his glance slid across Sherlock’s face before dropping to the floor. “You want tea?”
John seemed on the verge of speaking when the waiter reappeared with their food. Sherlock could have stabbed the man with his fork, but instead he stabbed the octopus, which turned out to be delicious and probably deserved to be eaten with better grace than Sherlock could currently manage.
"What about John?" Sherlock snapped back. He loathed imprecision. "I'm saving his life, surely that's enough."
Sherlock opened his eyes and glanced sidelong over steepled fingertips to John, slouched in his chair like a miserable shadow. They had been on the case for thirty-two hours, and John was coming up on his limit. In the early days, when John had still cherished the notion of himself as a responsible member of the surgery, he had been perfectly happy to retreat upstairs and leave Sherlock alone in the living room, even when he didn’t have a shift the next day. But now that his blog brought in enough cases to cover rent and expenses, John had devoted himself fully to casework. Sherlock liked most things about this arrangement. But it wasn’t especially pleasant to watch John starve himself of sleep, and in recent months Sherlock had had a harder time ignoring it.
"Did you-- why-" she began, and then stopped herself. "Never mind, it doesn't matter."
Sherlock was seated on the toilet, palm upturned.  He glanced up at John and frowned. “Something wrong?”
John’s eyes were sticky. He lifted his arm to rub at—no, that wasn’t going to work, was it. There was blood on his face, gumming his eyes together. And that heat in his ribs, that was pain.
Sherlock stared down at him, blank as blank, and wordlessly John gathered him in. Feeling Sherlock lean against him, John swallowed hard, holding his own chest together with sheer bravado.
I see him pale, fraught with woe,
John’s mouth was tight, and he drew the surgical thread through Sherlock’s arm hard enough to hurt.
Sherlock had of course entertained the notion that he was going mad: that Moriarty had orchestrated some massive, elaborate ploy to drive him out of his wits, or that Sherlock had dreamed it up himself, which was plausible given the circumstances. He was under an unusual degree of stress, exhausted and worn down by unceasing movement while still recovering from his injuries at Barts, and no doubt highly suggestible. A further argument for this possibility was the sudden absence of John, a steadying presence on whom Sherlock had come to rely, even more than he had realized at the time.
Sherlock picked the lock and unwound the chain from the door, and together they slipped inside and switched on their pocket torches. Long rows of iron shelves, packed with boxes on the lower levels and hollow and hungry above; stacks of discarded shipping crates; a row of small freestanding sheds toward the back. By silent consensus, John went left and Sherlock right, each walking a slow, careful track along one wall, meeting up at the far end.
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it again. The parallels were undeniable, but that did not mean they were significant. It was not helpful to theorize on a selective assortment of facts, he told himself again. Somewhere under all of the muffling exhaustion, a weak little flare of fury sprang up, that Molly should pander (however unknowingly) to a suspicion that Sherlock had been struggling to extinguish.
He watched as John’s chin sank down toward his chest, listened to his breath going slow and even, until a moment later he shook himself awake and propped his head on his hand. Half a minute later, the drift began again, and Sherlock felt a brief twinge of hope before John’s head jerked up a second time. More likely a twentieth or thirtieth time, realistically speaking.
And, wistful, thought of chances lost  –
“Well. Maybe I do mind, sometimes.”
It was a short piece, rather dull for the musician, which is why Sherlock had never bothered to learn the later movements. Sherlock watched John’s peaceful breathing and realized that he had started again from the beginning. The simple fingerings allowed his hands to follow effortlessly in the wake of his thoughts: the slow, even rise and fall of John’s chest. As the light crept further into the flat, spreading out the golden fingers of the sinking sun, Sherlock played, and played.
“Bit to your left, or we’ll run into the table.”
“But how?” he murmured, frowning.
– were still at the far end of the warehouse, but were coming in their direction. Under the snips of conversation (a regional Mexican dialect, heavily accented, he could work it out if he had the time, but he didn’t,
It angered him, as much as anything, to find himself compelled to return again and again to the idea of that endless many-eyed web, skittering feather-light across the surface of any logical construct Sherlock tried to erect in his own defense. Accepting the reality of what he had seen felt like a compromise of his rational faculties. But even worse, it also meant giving into base fear, letting in a darkness that was never going to leave him alone. A less rigorous mind would likely be content to accept the uncertainty and move on, rather than get tangled up in trying to resolve the contradictions. Sherlock did not have that luxury.
"But John." The imploring tone in his voice was humiliating, but Sherlock found that he could not control it. Not when John was finally so close again. "John, I need you to trust me about this." The beat of his damaged heart counted off silent seconds. "Please."
The invisible, choking thread around Sherlock's heart pulls tighter.
She nodded quickly and dropped her eyes, but then suddenly leaned forward and put one tentative hand on the bed rail. "You will let me know if there's something I can do."
But the fussing has continued, though the dressings have long since come off and Sherlock is able to get about pretty well by himself. There had always been an unsettling continuity between John's daily acts of service to an admired friend and the way he insisted, from time to time, on managing Sherlock into some sort of bland palatability. From everything Sherlock had read, he had assumed that their post-reunion transition from friends to lovers would entail a shift more fully toward the former behaviour. But every day John meets him with blank, impersonal solicitousness, as if the flat -- as if all of London -- cannot be trusted not to provoke Sherlock. As if Sherlock himself cannot be trusted.
"I have biscuits." It was the truth. There was a package of teething biscuits in his box of baby things.
Pleased, John leaned back in the recliner and decided he'd earned a short nap himself. If Sherlock needed anything or cried out, he'd be right there when the little boy woke up.
He went to the kitchen to fix the bottle.
Sherlock, smelling what it was, reached up with both hands to receive the mug, excitedly demanding, "Ah'fee!"
"That's a promise, right?" John checked, holding his arms out to Sherlock.
They get really fizzy inside droplets of peroxide. >:3
"There they are!" Sherlock bounced on the balls of his feet and pointed to the swingset in the distance. The area was thankfully deserted. The few cars parked behind the mowed sports field belonged to people who were probably walking far down the other direction, along the two-mile circuit that passed by the protected marshlands.
Warning for more toilet talk/allusions in this chapter. I really didn't plan it this way, I swear. Xb
"Nothing planned except enjoying my nine centimetres of bliss," the detective rumble-purred.
Sherlock didn't take it right away, craning his neck to curiously peer at the pouch.
"Okay, Baby," John said softly, "are you ready to put your nappy on? Going to behave while Daddy washes your face and then lets you out of the booster chair?"
"Thanks," John called as he bent and picked it up. He hooked it onto the drawer knob of the nightstand so he could toss the dirty wipes and thoroughly soiled nappy directly in.
John went and hovered by Sherlock's chair, where, predictably, the detective stayed firmly planted and engrossed in the microscope.
Oh, John. Trying to get him out of the house, then. Fearing for Sherlock's sanity being so cut off from the imbecilic socialites who made the world go 'round.
Sherlock made a long, very frustrated-sounding exhale through his nose. Then, with a curt grunt, he turned and toddled down the hall.
He imagined how wrong such a conversation might go. Snippets of an outraged John Watson, making large, emphatic gestures while he laid into Sherlock for being so utterly intolerable, played through Sherlock's head. The row played through in a multitude of variations, interspersed with the occasional unlikely show of sympathy.
Benedict answered with a timid nod, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth.
He sighed, "Yes, Sherlock. You were a good boy for not killing the poor toads, but you still scared them a bit."
Or, rather, they would have gone quicker if Sherlock hadn't decided to be the fussiest wee brat he possibly could.
With a wicked glint in his eye, John shrugged and offered, "You can give it a go if you want."
John enacted a faux double-take and marvelled aloud, "Huh! A 'please' and a 'thank-you' both in one day? I must be doing
"Come on, let's get you to the potty before you wet the bed. Up you go."
John noticed right away and quickly reach down to rub Sherlock's body reassuringly.
Le sigh. Being naughty can be complicated.
"Toilet stupid," Sherlock repeated.
In the meantime, I will upload what was going to be today's corresponding chapter in this story's sister fic, "Extended Scenes from Sherlock's Little Blog" (posted as Part 2 of this series), so you all have some new Little Sherlock to read despite the technical difficulties here.
Edit:
Sherlock whined up at him pathetically. He didn't like the strange things sticking to him, nor the robotic noise the box beside the cot made.
Preventing dehydration was definitely still a priority. Sherlock's body would need plenty of fluids to flush the drugs from his system, and he'd just spat up nearly half of the water he drank.
"Yes, please." Sherlock rolled his eyes at himself after he said it. He was unnecessarily polite in his little headspace. Why bother to say 'please' when he didn't want to eat at all?
"Um..." Sherlock looked down at himself. He wrapped his arms across his naked chest and said under his breath, "Oh."
"Here, Sherlock. Look what Daddy has!"
Sherlock squirmed happily inside his blanket and continued feeding.
After wiping off his hands he turned and stared anxiously out the door, past John's elbow, until John, who hovered as though he possibly wanted to discuss what he had seen, took the hint and stepped aside to let Sherlock pass. He swept past the bewildered doctor and returned to his room, where he figured he had best hole up for the remainder of the day and hope against hope that John would forget what he saw by the time Sherlock came out.
"Buh," was all Sherlock got out before he completely broke down in tears.
He manhandled Sherlock back into the warm baby clothing, then grabbed a pillow off the bed to tuck between Sherlock's head and the hard flooring.
Though Sherlock was able to keep himself from crying too much more, he felt a wreck by the time the programme drew to a close. His eyelids were puffed some because he held back, and the familiar soreness resided in his throat. All of the physical aches of suppressed sorrow were upon him as a man onscreen spoke of how the reprieve of childhood was only an illusion, but a very welcome one all the same.
John said it's a cheap gift, (as if that's supposed to make me feel bad about it,) but if someone's going to bother with gifts it stands to reason they should be useful. Besides, Gormund was the one who specifically said he could use a VCR. He'll be getting exactly what he wants, and I'll have more space in my bookshelves with it gone.
Though, John
Sherlock closed and opened his fingers in a childish wave and disappointedly murmured, "Bye-bye, Toad."
It was three days before Daddy correctly attributed my tummy troubles to her tea - although I'd suspected a day earlier - and not stomach flu.
But that was hardly the end of it.
"Sure." Wisely, John refrained from mentioning that he would be trying to put Sherlock down for a nap first thing when they got home. If all went according to plan, Sherlock would go down easily after their hike of what must have been five miles, and he would get his story when he woke up.
Showing only minor disappointment, Sherlock took it out and set it carefully on a low shelf in his bookcase.
Already sluggish as an after effect of the rest of that week - of dealing with a solid backlog of months-worth of stress-processing hitting him all at once - Sherlock feeling his Littleness descending didn't help either. The bites he took were tiny, timid. Soon his world narrowed to this; to nibbling from John's hand like a small animal being rehabilitated, who was only beginning to trust its new caretaker.
Sherlock wriggled a bit in order to hide his face in John's neck, and whimpered pointedly.
2. Cold sausage straight from the fridge eaten right before multiple servings of fibre-rich Hobnobs makes/traps way too much gas and I get a really, really bad tummy ache for the rest of the day.
John tugged the swaddling open and unwrapped Sherlock so that his nappy was accessible. He felt around the crinkly plastic, which was warm but heavily wet. It was sodden enough that part of it looked yellow even from the outside.
"You forgot, or you purposely neglected to do it?" John prompted him.
It seemed the success of the soup last night was so encouraging that John and Missus Hudson deliberately put it on the menu again today. Only, today it was far less acceptable. It was watery, sickly-sweet mulligatawny, and Sherlock wasn't at all in the mood to force it down. Somehow, the offence made something click in Sherlock's already worn-down subconscious, and he acted out without exactly meaning to.
At least Sherlock was able to give himself a pat on the back for using his pacifier and not a cigarette. He momentarily longed for some hard alcohol and a pack of kreteks. Jaegermeister or some cheap brandy, he thought distantly. Not wine. Wine made him far too maudlin in large quantities.
John rubbed Sherlock's knee again.
- I accidentally kneed Daddy in the crotch while having a nightmare about Moriarty. Not too hard, but Daddy still made a point to complain about it after I woke up. John forewarned me that next time he catches me having a nightmare, he's going to swaddle me right away for his own safety.
Sherlock looked about the room. Daddy wasn't anywhere.
John said, "He should be alright with a cannula now."
There was no one within sight of the hall, so Sherlock crawled on hands and knees to the bathroom.
Sherlock rose and caught a glimpse of John's barely-there smile before he headed to the couch to wait for him.
He reached down and carefully peeled the sticky tabs on either side of the nappy open, and pulled the thing out from between Benedict's legs. He took a couple steps toward the bed and leaned close to the light to check if the nappy was dry.
He just wanted Daddy to come downstairs, to open the door and see how sorry his little boy was for everything, and to love him enough to accept him this way. With a bittersweet pang, Sherlock allowed himself the indulgence of imagining John coming in, sitting next to him on the bed, and gathering him into a warm hug. All would have been forgiven in that hug, and John could start fresh with Sherlock. He could show Sherlock the kind of sweet boy he wanted him to be, and Sherlock would be so obedient and careful. He wanted to be a pleasant, good little baby for Daddy, even if he knew he'd get mopey from time to time and wouldn't always give John an easy go of it.
John nodded, reluctantly coming to the same conclusion. Until Mary confirmed it, John's guilt over leaving Sherlock alone for most of the time since his return nagged at him, making him question if the injuries were more recent, something John could have prevented by being more vigilant.
Sherlock's eyes went wide for an instant in the mirror as it sank in that he had been caught bent over the bathroom counter in his underwear, slapping gleefully at a sinkful of water with all the poise of an awkward tot in an inflatable kiddie pool, like it was the greatest thing in the world.
The probabilities were too balanced. Enjoying his solitude, or mother-henning?  Even his motivation for inviting Sherlock to watch telly could have pointed either way. Either John thought it would cheer Sherlock up (despite past failures, the dear doctor still tried), or John's social nature simply had him in the mood for companionship after watching telly alone every other night.
John unplugged the bottle warmer, and tugged his sleeve back to test the bottle's temperature on his wrist. He'd prepared gripe water according to instructions Sherlock had researched in advance, using fennel and caraway seeds pinched from Mrs. Hudson's spice rack at home.
