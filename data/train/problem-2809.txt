“What?” they both asked.
The two run off in conversation and Dean looks at Cas, mouthing, crew?
A muffled noise comes from Dean’s mask and his eyes narrow.
“I want my kiss, Dean Winchester,” Cas whines, making grabby hands in the direction of his fleeing boyfriend.
“Some may even call me an expert,” Dean mumbles.
“I feel like I’ve been waiting to do that for five years,” Dean whispers.
He drops the grocery bags and in the next second Cas is there, wrapped tightly in his arms. He feels Cas’s hands behind his back, holding him just as close as they breathe each other in for the first time in too long. Cas’s scent seeps into him, like honey-sweetened tea during a rainstorm. It soaks deep into Dean’s bones and his memories, bringing up all sorts of happy moments from their past and Dean’s chest does rumble this time.
Dean fetches his lunch from the fridge and claims the chair next to Cas. “How ya been?”
*****
“Uh, I told you to meet me here.”
Callie’s comment has been echoing in his mind all weekend, haunting and unforgettable.
“Cas, seriously, you’re the least sneaky person I know.”
Dean takes a rough breath, his airways suddenly tight. “That’s not ominous at all.”
“It’s okay. I’ll just see if Meg wants to have brunch.” He tilts his head back and kisses the bolt of Dean’s jaw. “Be careful.”
“I don’t know if that’s an apology for last night or for the shitty way you broke up with me, but both leave much to be desired.”
“Sap,” Dean accuses and takes another bite.
He walks Dean to the door. Dean wraps him in a tight hug, breathing in his scent as deep as he can without being creepy. “I still can’t completely believe you’re here,” he says.
“It’s nothing.”
Cas stands in the front door greeting guests as they trickle inside. He can’t help his smile as he watches them take in the Novak house in a whole new light — quite literally as Cas has the house lit from top to bottom and there are enough snowmen and reindeer in the front yard to make one think Santa may have relocated his workshop to a suburban street in the middle of Kansas.
Dean adjusts the boxes in his hands, eyes roaming warily. “I have no idea.”
Unfortunately, Dean wasn’t able to stand so it turned into a bath. And with as much water as Sam got on himself getting Dean into the tub, it basically turned into a bath for two. When Sam was sure Dean wasn’t at risk of drowning, he left Dean to marinate while he straightened the apartment up.
“It’s okay. I fell asleep too.”
Dean nods, processing this new information and a fair amount of shame at his behavior. Clearly, he’d been more cut up about the situation than he knew but that was no excuse to upset Cas.
“Yeah, well Cas is blackout drunk, his brother is long gone and there’s no one else who can do it, so…”
“He’s talking to the donor dude.”
Dean looks down at his clothes, pulls the collar of his shirt up to his nose but doesn’t smell anything. He shrugs and follows Lisa inside.
*****
Dean’s eyes opened and for a brief moment they were crystal clear. His smile was gone. He turned his face toward the blank television. “I am home.”
Dean smirks. “Makes sense for a lust spell. And this one?”
“How is it wrong when we both want it?” Dean is reaching for him again, looking almost out of his mind and Cas’s stomach lurches.
Callie looks at him, eyes wide and sincere. “Yeah.” And it’s just one word but Dean can sense all the unspoken emotion behind it. She goes back to sipping her drink.
They spend the next few minutes just enjoying their meal, no need for conversation as they try to satisfy the rumbling in their stomachs.
It wasn’t the hard to figure out. She still remembers the first time she attended one of Deanna’s soccer games and how the crowd had stomped on the bleachers, building a roar that vibrated through her body.
Cas just gives a small shrug before reaching over to steal one of Dean’s potato chips. “I like Emerson. He’s one of my favorite 19th-century writers and it’s different for a first name.”
*****
“So, ugh, Ben is staying at my parents’ for the night if you want to come over,” Lisa offers, looking up from under her lashes.
Dean was standing out in the middle of the hall. He was barefoot, dressed in a gray T-shirt and simple black sweatpants. Cas remembered those sweatpants. He remembered giving them to Dean as a present because Dean always complained about how cold Cas kept the apartment.
A knock from the front of the restaurant draws his eyes and he frowns. Who knocks on a clearly closed restaurant’s front door at one in the morning?
He starts to walk away and all the panic sets in, propelling Cas after him.
Dean pulls a platter down from a cabinet and starts transferring the burgers out of the pan. “Uh, yeah. I got off work late and didn’t have time to prep everything there. But the burgers are almost done and things should be all set in about…
Cas pulls his eyes away from the ass swinging in front of his face and frowns up at his best friend. “Are you okay?”
The second he’s gone, Cas dissects the bags one by one but there’s still no sign of the mistletoe and his heart rate spikes to dangerous levels. Where the fuck could it be?
“Well, I was talking to Callie, trying to help Cas calm her down after Balthazar made her mad.” Dean imagines the scene in his mind, can still feel the warmth of Callie’s little hand clinging to his leg, can smell the distress and comfort Cas was putting out, clearly upset but still trying to care for his daughter. “All of a sudden Brady got mad and stormed out and I followed him outside and he said… something really weird.”
Dean laughs, head thrown back and eyes watering, and Cas watches, a voice deep in the back of his mind whispering about how he hopes he can always have Dean like this even if he’s too young to understand what that means.
“I’m coming!” he shouted as his hand finally landed on the door. “Hold on!” he shouted again as the knocking shook the door while he fumbled with the locks. “I’m unlocking it!” Cas finally got the lock and wrenched the door open. “What’s going—Dean?”
“What the hell is parkour?”
“It’s not bad news,” Cas rushes to assure him and Dean feels almost immediate relief but Cas is still fidgeting in his seat. “It just may seem… odd.”
The only thing wrong is that it’s been an hour an there’s been so sign of Deanna.
“What?”
“Mate me.”
“We broke up,” Dean confesses. “I told her I might... be interested in someone else. That there’s always been someone else.”
“Cas,” his brother groans. “I get that you’re all into the apple pie and everything nice normal little life-” Cas narrows his eyes “-but think about it like this: if you are developing a gift, you need to learn to control it. Or else you’ll be throwing shit around every time you sneeze.”
“Yes, I am.”
And he supposes it is natural. This is the way it always should have been. The two of them.
The name is like a bucket of ice water. Cas immediately starts to pull away. “Yeah, she’s probably worried-”
Both men look at Dean who shakes his head wildly but they seem to both agree that Dean’s opinion doesn’t matter in this situation.
“You lie back and I’m going to call Sam, okay?”
He’s just starting to plate everything when the bedroom door opens and Dean wanders in wearing his uniform. Cas immediately frowns.
Sam Winchester turns around with a frown but smiles when he recognizes Cas. “Hey, Cas!”
Cas rolls his eyes and whispers, “Thief,” but then smiles. “And I’m not joining the cheer squad. I would look awful in those skirts.”
Dean gives a snort but follows Cas out of the garage. Cas stomps through the snow, brain racing in an effort to come up with an explanation for what had just happened. It wasn’t the weirdest thing to ever occur at the Novak house but it certainly wasn’t typical.
“What in high hell,” Brady breathes as they move further into the apartment.
“Yes, very few. So what’s the special occasion?”
“Dean? Hey, Dean.”
“He is for now,” Sam growled. “Charlie, could you give me a ride?”
“You know how I never talk about my dad?” Cas nodded but Dean didn’t turn to see it. There’s a good reason. He’s not a good person, Cas. Ever since Mom died. He just hasn’t been right. But every once in a while he likes to come around and pretend to be a good dad again.” Dean took a breath. “He came to see me for my birthday. A week late.” A huff of bitter laughter shook from Dean. “He popped up at Bobby’s first, chatted for a bit, tried to act like everything was normal. We ended up going to Ellen’s that night, Cas, you remember? We were there with Sam and Jess. Dad was there too. He saw us together.”
Cas doesn’t look convinced. “Are you sure, because we can talk, I—”
Cas squeezed out of the door and stumbled into the crowd. With a little bumping and a few shoves, he made his way to Jess who was dancing with a friend.
Sam bent to give him two more breaths when Dean jumped to life. He coughed violently and Sam helped flip him onto his side. Dean lurched forward just in time to vomit over the edge of the bed.
“Jess,” Sam chastised.
Gabe just stares at her for a moment. “You’re kinda scary.”
“Love you,” Dean calls after him.
Cas almost scowls at the mention of work. That’s the last thing he wants to do right now — he’s just found his mate, doesn’t that warrant one day off?
Cas had always been too beautiful. He had that amazing tan skin that glowed even in the middle of winter, had that permanently disheveled dark hair that invited fingers to run through it, the perfect amount of stubble shaping his jaws. Then there were those damned pink lips. Was it natural to have lips that pink? Dean remembered thinking the same question the first time they had met. He also remembered being far too eager to touch them, just as he had been ten minutes ago.
Cas takes a step back, breaking out of Dean’s hold. He shakes his head. “No, you don’t.”
“That’s awesome, Cas!” It’s louder than intended but probably the right amount of cheer for a newly engaged friend.
In fifteen days, he should be celebrating his first year or marriage to the love of his life. Instead, he would be holed up in his little brother’s apartment, trying to find a way to occupy his time while he was cut off from work and alcohol.
He nods his head, answering her unasked question. “I’m gonna do it. Just…” He sucks in a shuddering breath, tries to muster up a smile and even he can taste the salt in it. “Just give me a little time.”
That last one is pretty common when it comes to Dean Winchester.
They hear someone clear their throat sharply and look up to find Donna eyeing them. They settle down immediately, eyes closing and continue their breathing until she walks away.
Nothing changes immediately. They take their time getting to know each other again and building the trust they need to make it work.
“How typical. And you don’t know what to do or how to feel about it since your lovely little chat last week?”
But they had happened. His denial didn’t change the past. And it didn’t help him or Cas get over it.
They get a table by the window and after a few more minutes of grumbling under his breath and stubborn stalling, Dean opens his mouth enough to place an order. They make small talk about work and family until their lunch arrives and Dean finally tries to get to the bottom of this last-minute rendezvous.
Cas may not know what to do but she’s not going to just give up. “Is this about prom?”
Cas had left with instructions for Dean to fetch the last box of his things from the hall closet. It had been there for months, but Cas never had to strength to contact either Winchester about it. So it collected dust.
Cas considered not answering. But it was Jess. She would probably just spend the next hour blowing his phone up.
Dean shrugs. “I think that’s up to the individual. He did some bad things but I don’t know if that necessarily makes him a bad person.”
Cas feels worry creep into her chest and squeeze her lungs. It’s not like Deanna to skip school. Could it have been because of their conversation yesterday?
Dean jolted from his inner thoughts and spun to face Cas, a lazy smile breaking across his face. “So howya doin’ man?”
Cas and Claire look up to find its their turn. Claire takes off immediately, Cas following much slower and cautiously. He tells himself that Dean probably won’t even recognize him. It’s been eight years and unlike Cas, Dean has surely been able to find someone new, someone to erase all memories of some college flame.
Cas rolls his eyes. “I can’t stand you.”
“Not sure yet. Depends on how long Callie can stand me.” He slides Cas a look who just laughs.
Dean looked away again. “It’s really stupid, Cas. I’m ashamed I even listened. I wasted so much precious time with you. I made you miserable. I threw away the best thing that ever happened to me and I will always have to live with that guilt and regret.”
He can hear and feel Cas chuckle against him. “I’ve missed you too.”
“Don’t think I won't. Now go. And go see Ellen so she’ll stop yappin’ at me!”
He looks over his shoulder as he unlocks the driver’s door. Anna stands just a few feet away looking righly magical with her bright red hair burning against the snowy background.
The figure reaches back into the kitchen and light spills into the hall, illuminating the man before him. He stands there in crisply pressed dress blues, looking stern and intimidating but as he removes the hat Cas is met with soft green eyes and it’s like all the soldier melts out.
Their bodies move together in sync, a harmony of limbs and beautiful sounds working toward the same precipice. When they near, Cas reaches for Dean’s hands, fingers lacing together. The way he says Dean’s name is like an enchantment, so soft and careful but full of meaning and intention. Dean answers in kind and they shake apart together, pressed chest to chest, heart to heart.
“So the other father isn’t involved at all?”
“Yes, actually.” That’s Cas’s voice. There’s a polite edge to it and Dean can just imagine the sharp twist to his lips. “We are planning to add his name to the birth certificate after the ceremony.”
“Well, are you gonna let him meet her?”
“Well hello there, young lady,” Dean greets as Claire steps up to his chair and makes herself comfortable in the man’s lap. Cas can’t even help the snort that spills from him. Leave it to his niece.
“Oh shi’. Missed work. Bobby’s gonna be pissed.”
“Is there something wrong, gentlemen?”
“I missed you,” Cas murmurs into Dean’s hair.
Meg just grins. “We all have our role to play,” Meg says. “And speaking of roles, I’m about to roll out.” She thumbs over her shoulder to the the doors.
Cas just pressed his lips together. “It’s fine, Sam. I’m just glad Dean is okay.”
“She’s still at the bar. We were both worried about you.” He pauses for a moment and Cas feels him shift on the bench. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Dean coughs and nearly chokes when he hears the deep voice. He sets the beer down and wipes at his face, trying to recover as smoothly as possible.
“Must be dreaming about her mystery suitor,” Charlie sings as she joins them.
“H-hey, Cas.”
Cas took a deep breath and looked up. He didn’t quite meet Dean’s eyes. “I was returning this to Sam,” he said, a slight tremble in his voice as he offered the jacket to Dean.
True to his word, Dean takes a quick shower and jumps in his car, hair still wet. It’s about a twenty-minute drive to Cas’s.
Somehow in all the madness Dean catches his eye and extends a hand. Cas takes it and lets himself be dragged into the dogpile, loving every little giggle and whimper and whispers of I missed you and I love you.
Deans laughs and swings his bag over his shoulder, begins locking up his office. “If I remember my childhood correctly, I didn’t stop being terrible until 30.”
Cas is due any minute now to fetch Callie. And Dean is going to tell him the truth.
“That’s a hell of an understatement, Dean. I’ve never seen you that drunk. I really thought you—”
“I understand.” He looked at his watch and flashed a grim smile. “I better get back over to the law school. I’m helping with a lecture in twenty minutes.”
Cas shows him to a quiet room on the other end of the apartment. Dean walks in with his gifts, picking up notes of anger and loneliness. He follows them back behind a chair and finds Callie sitting in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest.
“Side? Really, Dean?” Sam huffed a sarcastic bit of laughter and turned to fetch the bacon from its pan on the stove. He shuffled a few pieces onto each plate. “This isn’t about sides, Dean. This isn’t a game. This is Cas’s life. And you chose not to be part of it. So you don’t get to just come randomly stumbling back in whenever you want. Especially considering the way you chose to leave.”
“Oh my god, Cas! That’s awesome! Are you gonna do it?”
“Dean,” Cas whines and his eyes open, meeting Dean’s.
Charlie laughs and gives Cas a small shove. “Come on, I wanna see what it is.”
And then it happened.
“Messing with you?” Cas echoes. Before Dean can even turn around, there’s a hand gripping his wrist and holding him in place. Cas’s eyes have bloomed into something wild and desperate, like the look he had when Dean was feeding him at dinner. “Dean, I feel like we’re not having the same conversation here. You’ve never asked me out because that is certainly not something I would forget and there is no chance in hell I would have said no once let alone multiple times.”
Dean took a drink of his water and settled back against the couch. “Right. How you feeling?”
Callie shakes her head. “I don’t want him to be angry.”
“Oh. Thank you.” Cas reached out and took it. “So everything went… smoothly?”
Cas does as told and puts all his weight on Dean’s chest, noting happily somewhere deep in the back of his brain that the alpha doesn’t budge. It makes him feel warm all over, feeling Dean’s body heat seep into him from behind, his thighs cradling Cas’s hips, and his chest rocking Cas under the waves of steady breathes.
He doesn’t hesitate to walk over and pull Cas to him, wrapping him tightly in his arms. Cas’s hands hand on his sides, squeezing his hips and Dean bends to nuzzle his neck in comfort. He smells heartbroken and Dean can’t stand it. “It’s going to be okay, Cas.”
“Apparently he’s had the flu for a while but wasn’t properly treating it,” Benny explains. “And this is the result.”
He made a mistake, a stupid, horrible mistake and he knew the second he did it. But it was too late and now all he could do was live with it. But he’s not even sure he can anymore.
But one day when she’s older, she asks them what it means to be true mates and they just smile at each other and reach for their hands.
He hears a soft clatter and spins around to watch the vintage flower vase on the kitchen table sway and settle back into place.
“Well, I was wondering if you’d go to the sperm bank with me? To help me look through the donors and choose the best one.”
“Oh.” Dean looks down, not sure what to say, but feels something warm swelling in him. “Cool.”
It’s like watching a hurricane pause and reconsider because just as quick as the storm had started, Cas was stopping in his tracks “The hospital? You were in the hospital and didn’t tell me? Dean, what happened? Are you okay?”
“Well, I definitely wasn’t gonna be the one to button your pants,” Charlie says.
Dean’s expression was far away, something Cas couldn’t touch even if they were nose to nose. Dean quirked an eyebrow with a huff of laughter at the familiar words. “Does it really matter?” he mocked.
Things begin to calm down. People leave to pursue other parties around town and there’s suddenly a lot more breathing room. Cas ventures to the bathroom trying to zone out the people around him. Which is why he doesn’t notice the couple making out in the corner until he accidentally bumps into them.
“I didn’t ask if you were hungry. I said you need to eat something. Ah-ha!” He found a package of crackers and took them to his brother. “I doubt you’ll be able to handle more than that for right now and I don’t feel like cleaning up any more puke.”
“What’s up, man?”
Anna secures the ribbon around the mistletoe and hands it to Cas. “Okay so when you get to Dean’s just hang this up and let your magic work itself.”
“Dean.”
The door opened then. Sam’s head popped in. “Guys, dinner is ready. Come on before Jess kills you.”
Charlie huffs impatiently, eyes rolling. “Of course you don’t remember, you drank half a damn bar that night,” she grumbles under her breath. “The night that Cas was supposed to inseminate himself with Balthazar’s sperm, Meg threw an insemination party. You showed up super late and pissy and started shooting back tequila like you were trying to put a fire out in your stomach.”
“Okay…” Dean says, head a little fuzzy as Cas continues his gentle ministrations.
“Oh, uh, that’s really only for kids. He doesn’t bring presents to grownups.”
– bed didn’t stir familiar feelings in his chest.
“So, Cas,” Brady says suddenly, his voice quite low and even, “have you met anyone since you’ve moved back to town?”
“God, Dean, I’m so-” Cas looks close to tears which makes Dean start to panic. The rejection might be gone and Dean’s on some heavy duty meds but he knows his alpha can’t handle seeing an omega distressed right now.
“Okay first of all, that’s a super offensive stereotype,” Gabe whines.
“Balthazar,” she says and it’s dark and angry.
Dean groans. “It was two times.”
“Dean,” he whines, fingers fisting in the T-shirt he’d given Dean last night, “please.”
She gets up to her room and falls on her bed, staring up at the ceiling and she couldn’t shake the feeling that she had just broken something beyond repair.
“I was wondering if you could pick Callie up from school and bring her to the museum? I had a meeting come up suddenly and won’t be able to make it in time.”
This time Dean’s laughter is real. “Aye, aye, chef.”
The first time happens at a movie theater and Dean’s reaction to seeing Cas leaves Cas gutted. He sits mortified while Dean gets up and flees the theater like it’s on fire. The instinct to follow is strong but Cas knows he no longer has that right. He chose to end things. So he sits in that pain and discomfort and doesn’t process a single frame of the film.
His hands drift down to Cas’s stomach without thinking, as they often do. Cas is about four months now and just starting to show. It still bewilders Dean every day when he gets to see and feel the evidence of their lives together, just like it had whenever he saw Cas’s wedding ring on his finger after they first got married. Took him months to fully wrap his head around that. Or the mating mark on Cas’s neck and the matching one on Dean’s. It just all still felt very surreal, like a fever dream Dean was desperate to never wake up from.
That’s when the spiral really starts. Dean reaches for a bottle and keeps reaching, drinking whatever he can get his hands on as the party moves around him. He knows it’s not a good decision but he doesn’t want to be good right now. He doesn’t want to be mature. He doesn’t even want to think. He just wants to forget this whole night and the reason he’s even here.
“Truth.”
“Water is fine, Cas.”
“We have to destroy it!” Cas insists.
“Looks like they have exactly two brain cells left.”
She shakes her head immediately. “No, it’s fine. I need to-”
But he is. He’s standing just feet away in the entrance of Dean’s restaurant, wearing the tan trench coat Dean had gotten him for Christmas years ago to replace the ratty one he’d always worn around college. It was an undeniable improvement, actually fitting his shoulders and didn’t drown him in useless material.
“Oh yikes, I knew I felt a code red somewhere.”
The boy on the ladder looks down at her with a broad smile. “My bad, boss! I’ll fix it!”
“He’s moving back here?”
“I’m sorry,” he calls one last time and races out of the apartment.
An icy breeze burns against Dean’s cheek and he looks up at the gray skies. He laughs, tiredly, and pulls the car door open. “It’d have to be one hell of a sign.”
He hears the door shut and the roar of the party is muted.
Dean can’t help the soft chuckle. “Cas, it’s okay man. What’s up?”
“Now we add the runes,” Anna says, fetching a pencil from her bag and drawing each of them out. “Choose which ones you want. You have sex, love, serenity, dominance, and thrusting.”
“Because it’s spelled!”
Dean meets her eyes and gives a nod like it’s his death sentence. The air in the next moment certainly feels colder, more threatening.
“Well, I’ll be working the entire time so I doubt I’ll have many opportunities for fun or sight seeing.”
“I have come to escort you to the ball.” Gabe swept into a graceful bow. “Your carriage awaits, milady.”
“You don’t have to Dean. I can drop him off.”
“If Cas gave you a sign,” she says, eyes intense and calculating, “that he was interested, would you take it?”
“I spent a few days in a motel outside of town. Then I just packed up and started driving. Wound up in Washington by the time I had to call Sam.”
Dean’s eyes seem to soften. “I’m sure you must have meant just as much to him. And that means there’s always a chance. You just have to be brave enough to take it.”
Cas rolled his eyes at the man. “Everyone, this is Balthazar, my colleague. Balthazar, you know Sam-”
“And text me the second you’re in the city.”
“Yes,” Cas says, voice just as soft.
“Please don’t go,” she whispers into his shoulder.
Cas snorts and nods his head. “Yes, Balthazar’s family can be rather traditional. They’re turning this entire engagement into a much larger circus than it needs to be.” He sighs, “It’s exhausting.”
Cas throws his hands up and falls into one of dining room chairs. “I don’t know! I was just- we were in the garage and I was kind of thinking about him and how I-” his cheeks heat “-how I wanted to touch his chest a-and then his jacket- just started unzipping. On its own.”
“I honestly don’t know.”
Dean has the decency to at least look Cas in the eyes when he apologizes and he’s a little shocked to not find disgust or burning hatred in his best friend’s eyes. In fact, if Dean didn’t know any better he’d say Cas looks confused and maybe... nervous? Of what, Dean can’t imagine.
There’s a cry from the living room. “Uncle Dean!” Both he and Cas look across the apartment and see Callie standing over by the bookshelves. “Look at all these cowboy movies!”
He whispers, “But for you I’ll make an exception.”
It was coming from outside. Cas’s heart seized. The last time this had happened, it had been his drunk ex.
“I want to be mad at you,” Cas says, his voice still incredibly soft. Almost unintelligible. He looks up at Dean and his eyes are wide and earnest. “I want to be furious and I want to hate you. But I can’t be,” he says helplessly.
“Mmhmm, but what did you have for lunch last weekend?”
The amount of alcohol that wafted from Dean’s mouth made Cas catch his breath. “Dean, wh-what are you doing? What are you doing here?” Cas asked, trying to get a better hold around Dean’s waist.
Dean had dessert and wine waiting at home and he’d gotten that familiar thrill when Brady’s eyes darkened when Dean started lighting the candles.
Either way by Saturday he was sitting up in bed, finally feeling more in his right mind. Cas came in with his tea tray and Dean immediately recoiled.
“Got arrested.”
John laughs off Deanna’s horror-stricken face. “That’s my cue,” he says and grabs his tool box. “See you around, kids.”
She grows up in a house on the outskirts of town with a vegetable garden and a front-porch swing. Her days are spent battling tickle monsters and gong on safaris in the backyard; her nights are calm with forehead kisses and soft lullabies. The first book read to her was written by a man with her name and there’s a message inside the front cover that says
Cas had come to rely to the outings. He didn’t go out much, so lunch with Anna was the social highlight of his week and he knew that he needed it. Especially this week.
“And so you decided to come all the way back to work at one in the morning to get it?” Dean asks as they make their way back to the kitchen.
Brady stops so suddenly Dean almost rams into him. The beta turns slowly and looks up into Dean’s eyes. “I don’t know what you’re playing here but if you truly don’t know, then go back into that party and look that child in the eye. Really, really look and you will have not even an ounce of doubt who her father is.”
“Ah come on, Dean,” Dorothy whines and hits his legs. “Tell us who it was!”
Balthazar watches helpless, catching Dean’s eye and Dean can only shrug. But then he feels a little hand snaking around his leg and looks down to see Callie clinging to both him and Cas now.
Which left Dean with just two possibilities: either Cas was an oblivious idiot or not interested.
“I was going to buy it. Part graduation present, part wedding present to ourselves. I was going to give you the key the night you graduated. I was so close, Cas. I was just about to close the deal.”
Before he can enter the living room, Dean stops him, hands on his waist and spinning him around. He smiles and waits for Dean to say anything but the green-eyed man just watches him.
Callie shrugs again. “Nothing much,” she grumbles.
“You seem off. You’re sure you’re not coming down with something? It’s flu season.”
“So Sam, what are your plans?” Cas eventually got around to asking.
Dean looked down at Cas and sighed. What had he gotten himself into?
“Of course there is, but that dumbass won’t let anyone take them. Keeps saying he needs the extra money.”
Charlie still doesn’t move but her eyes seem to get more intense as she watches Dean. When she speaks her question comes across in three careful parts. “What. Do you mean. By switched the sperm?”
She nods, understanding the silent plea behind the words. She scoots closer, resting her head on his shoulder and wrapping him up in her arms. Dean lets himself fall into it and stares ahead like he can see the grains of sand filling the bottom of the hourglass.
They go inside together and Cas almost stops as though he’s smacked into a wall when the scent hits him. Pregnancy scents have always been sweet but with ten pregnant people in the room, it’s almost sickening.
Cas shrugged. “I’m entitled to a night of abandon and immaturity every now and then. I’ve certainly been through enough this year to warrant a few.”
He expects a pout or for Cas to growl as he usually does, but today he smiles. Then suddenly, he’s pulling his fingers out and sitting up. He moves toward Dean slowly but purposefully, takes Dean’s hands in his and wraps them around his waist. Dean tenses, fighting every urge to grope and lick and maybe throw Cas on the bed and fuck him into oblivion.
Deanna nods as she swallows and Cas does not at all track the movement of her throat. “Yeah. To be honest, I was considering saving it as a surprise and having you walk in Friday and just find it there. But then I thought how shitty would it be if you put all this work into a dance and died of a heart attack the night before. So I’m letting you know now.”
Apartment thirty-two. Cas stood in front of it for a few seconds, trying to absorb and call upon all the bravery and strength he could. Then he realized what an absolute idiot he was being, because this was Sam for God’s sake and the worst thing that could happen was Sam not being home and Cas would just text him about the jacket like a normal person.
“So, any questions for me?” Dr. Mills asks, removing her gloves and rewashing her hands.
“Yeah,” Cas says and takes a deep breath. “Just a little tired.”
Callie? Like
Dean nods. “Yeah. I know, Cas. Thanks.”
Bobby glowered from under the rim of his trucker cap. He eyed Dean’s beer. “How many is that today for you?”
Dean looks up suddenly, eyes guarded and pensive ans Cas doesn’t look away. Dean is thinking about something, deeply and carefully, weighing his options. Cas knows because he’s seen this look when Dean is playing soccer, trying to figure out the best next five moves. He’s always been a critical thinker, scarily so.
But Cas moves with him, keeping their bodies connected and in sync. Another delightful side effect of pregnancy, though not as much at night when it’s way too hot and Cas is stuck to him like an octopus. Dean always sucks it up though and allows his mate as much of him as he wants.
She’s here too. Cas sees her fight through the thick of the crowd until she reaches Dean and he smiles, big and bright, and throws his arms around her, lifts her into the air and she laughs.
Cas inches toward him, kissing his chin, and Dean is about to respond when Cas’s stomach grumbles again. Cas rolls his eyes. “This will have to wait. Emerson is demanding nourishment.”
Dean doesn’t respond, just kind of nods along to Cas’s words.
“I-I- I’m sorry,” Dean sputters. “I should have- shouldn’t have asked before...”
Cas snorts with laughter. “Yeah, no shit.” He tosses a grin over his shoulder. “But it’ll be worth seeing his smile tomorrow morning.”
A barely there grin curled the corners of Dean’s lips. “Yes you are. You’re slouching and you can barely keep your eyes open.” Dean leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’re completely blitzed, angel. That’s very uncharacteristic of you.”
That made him put the picture back on the shelf.
“You know I never say no to pizza.”
“Well, I think it’s time for me to stop.”
And that's all, folks! I Hope you have enjoyed. A last thank you to Hope for being a great friend and inspiration! You can find her Tumblr
Dean’s eyes popped open. A familiar painting of an angel with a broken halo wished him good morning with a grim expression. Frowning, Dean peeled his face from the pillow to look around his surroundings.
“Papa, it’s Christmas!” they hear Juniper shout.
And that’s how he felt right now. Destroyed. Because he hadn’t missed the way Cas’s face fell when Dean had opened the door or the way he had frozen up. And definitely hadn’t missed the way Cas had jerked away from Dean’s hand as if it was made of lightning.
Deanna sighs and gets back into her comfortable position, resting her head on Cas’s shoulder. “Not yet. But I have someone in mind. Someone who I want to ask. Someone special.”
“Why the fuck are you screaming?” Dean yelled back.
“You talked to Dean,” Jess repeated, but this time it was a statement instead of a question.
“Maybe that’s the way it’s meant to be.” And it hurts to hear that, the idea that Cas — perfect, wonderful, brilliant Cas — believes he’s meant to spend his life alone. Not because there’s anything wrong with being alone, but because it’s clearly not what Cas wants.
*****
The picture frame next to the figurine came into Dean’s focus next and it made his heart stop. He ignored the tremble in his hands as he picked it up.
"Wait, Dean, stop," Cas says, holding up a hand. "I'm... Sam never said anything about a bond."
And that’s about all Cas can take. He reaches up to cup Dean’s face who looks worried now. “Cas?”
Instant panic floods his body and he feels sick, his heart beating, as he gazes wildly around the swing area. He knows he had his toy. It was just here a second ago!
Dean’s chest tightens at the confession. “Cas.” He doesn’t try to restrain himself a second longer and takes the few steps between them to wrap Cas in his arms. One hand cups the back of Cas’s head, cradling him to Dean’s shoulder and Dean presses soft kisses to his temple. “You never needed a lust spell to make me want you.”
“Shh, sweetheart, I got you,” Dean whispers when Cas’s movements start to get a little erratic. “I’m finally going to take care of you to the way you deserve.”
Cas’s fingers had typed various messages to Sam in his phone, but he never pressed send. It’s not any of your business, he would tell himself. Sam could take care of Dean. It wasn’t Castiel’s concern.
Her eyes light up and she starts to giggle, and it’s soft and sweet and makes Dean laugh too.
Dean peers at the slick flat monstrosity taking up an inordinate amount of wall space. “That’s one word for it. You can go check it out. Got every channel and subscription under the sun. Just stay off the HBO, kid.”
Anna and Gabe go about dumping their supplies on one of the free tables and Anna starts searching for the items she’ll need for the spell.
Anna sighs and approaches them. “Okay, you want to claim that you’re not a witch, so prove it.”
Dean has no idea how to process this information or if he even wants to. “Oh. Well, what happened?”
Dean entered and kicked the door shut on the cold air trying to follow him inside. “Wind really picked up,” he starts to say but then Cas is flying across the room and ripping the bags from his arms. “Uh, you okay, Cas?”
“Dean, will you please stop acting like a nervous chicken?” Jess laughed, shoving his shoulder.
Dean grips Cas’s hand back and gives a squeeze. “I’ll be there.”
Dean looks surprised. “Oh, uh, okay. Are you good to go home? I can... walk you. If you want.”
Dean opens the door and steps out. “‘Night, Cas.”
Sam had no clue what that meant but he also knew Dean to enough to know that was all he was going to get on the subject. For now.
“I mean it, Cas. Anything. Like if you need help finding a place or moving your stuff, I’m here.”
Left with no choice, Dean is pulled from room to room in search of his friend. Mildred stops to introduce him to a few people here and there. It seems most of the crowd is related to Balthazar, not surprising since Cas’s family is mostly settled on the west coast. Dean shakes hands with everyone he meets, smiles and does his best to keep the small talk light. Mildred never lets go of him whether it’s his hand, his arm, and in once instance he’s pretty sure she tried to grab his ass.
Each of the Novaks had a gift, a special power beyond the ability to cast. Some had visions, some could read minds, there was a distant cousin who could levitate. There seemed to be no order or lineage linked to the gift one was born with; they each just woke up one day in their adolescence with an ability.
And that’s all Dean really needs to hear. His smile softens, genuine and heartfelt. “I’m glad, Cas. I really am.”
Cas doesn’t say anything and just looks away.
The next Saturday, Dean makes up an excuse for a celebratory dinner and tells Cas to get cleaned up.
“I read that pregnant people shouldn’t eat eggs or dairy,” Cas says defensively.
Dean fought his way through the arrivals gate in late July. His phone kept buzzing and he couldn’t help looking every time, waiting for a response from Cas, but instead it was just a Charlie and Dorothy sending pictures of their baby back and forth in a groupchat he was getting ready to remove himself from.
Cas crosses his arms and sniffs. “I thought you were a burglar.”
There he finds Castiel slumped against the door, fists clenched but face deprived of any little fight he had left.
“It means you’re suspended.”
And Dean had thrown him away.
Dean laughs as he continues running about. “Guess I finally got those extra hours of sleep I needed.”
Dean throws his head back and groans and Cas busts out laughing. He stirs the sauce a few seconds before looking over his shoulder and waving the wooden spoon threateningly. “It was a gift.”
Dean was just staring into space when Sam returned to get him out. He carried Dean back to his room and helped him dress, then placed him out on the couch.
“Afternoon?” Balthazar’s eyebrows shot to his hairline. “I knew you were feeling off today but I didn’t think you had completely checked out. It’s nearly seven.”
"Because I don't want to just be your friend anymore. I want to mate with you. I've wanted to since I first met you. I want to wake up to you every day and I want you to be the last thing I see every night. I want your scent all over me and all over our house. I want to kiss you until I can't breathe and I want to touch you every chance I get." As he says it, Cas takes Dean's hand and holds it tightly. "That is what would make me happy."
“You smile more.”
Bobby had come out and noticed all of the bottles on the bench and began bitching. Dean had tried to wave him off and get back to work by lowering the engine back into the Mustang, but instead he had almost lowered it right onto himself.
“Dean? What’s wrong?”
“Well, school is more than testing quartiles,” Cas says, his voice tight and careful and the sour smell in the room is getting thicker.
“Oh, thank you so much, Dean. Look, I gotta get going. I’ll call the school and let them know you have permission to get Callie. They’ll ask for your ID. And there will be two tickets waiting for you at the front desk. Just wander around until I get done, okay?”
Dean smiles brightly as he approaches Cas at a slight jog, his chest rising and falling with heavy breathes.
It takes Dean a moment to catch up, his body feeling heavy, but he hears the rustling of clothes as people move and when his eyes finally flutter open they almost bug out of his head.
Cas’s studies Dean as the other man lifts the ladder and deposits it safely on the wall, watches the way his shoulders roll under his coat, thinks of how thick his biceps must look flexing like that. God he just wants to take the coat off him and touch, fingers dragging over the warm flannel that no doubt lies beneath it, slide his hand underneath and feel hot skin-
Cas swats at him. “Don’t start. My parents tell me all the time.”
“Shhhh,” Dean soothes him, hands rubbing his back. “You have nothing to apologize for.”
Charlie stands and approaches him carefully. “Dean, what is it?”
“Wouldn’t that be a sight?” Gabe snickers. Matching blue eyes stare him down until he quiets and looks away.
Dean’s eyes scan the expanse of the snow-covered lawn one last time before returning to his attention to the lights. “I know what I felt.”
They’re just friends.
God, he had missed this.
Dean eyed the corner of the bar and shrugged. “Probably heard it on the history channel or something.”
Benny nods, lips frowned as if to say he understands. His hand squeezes Dean shoulder before falling back to his side. “Don’t worry, brotha, we’ll find you someone.”
Dean nods and tries to shake off the sinking feeling the word “friend” gave him.
As per usual, the panic began to set in and Dean watched every person who ascended the escalators with a rapidly beating heart.
Dean nodded his head, still looking at his shoes but Cas make see the way his brows are furrowed together. There’s something on the tip of his tongue, and Cas braces himself for it.
“You don’t have to say anything,” Deanna says gently. “I just want you to finally know. That I love you. More than anything I ever thought I could love. And I want to take you to the dance. If you’ll have me.”
“Dean,” Cas says sharply and Dean closes his mouth. Cas stretches up to his tiptoes to kiss him on the lips, comforting him. He’s a lot more affectionate like that lately. Dean not so secretly loves it and Cas loves using it to turn the alpha into a puddle.
, he’s fucked!
“Why...” Cas begins, slow and soft. “Why did you think you had to trick me into a date?”
This entire fiasco had proven that.
“You’re lying!”
“What the ever loving fuck?” Dean breathes.
Cas has to resist rolling his eyes again. Damn his overly considerate brother and his obnoxious and adorable love for his wife.
Anna lowered her arms. She squinted her eyes, studying him closely. Cas tried to ignore it by looking at the menu again. He really didn’t want a salad today. Maybe a burger or something with—
Dean hums, impressed by her critique. Definitely Cas’s kid. “Most people are.”
Cas bowed his head. “Sam.”
All of this was happening because of Dean biting his tongue all of these years and his body refused to keep the secret even a heartbeat longer.
“I need to feel you inside me, baby, please,” Cas pants. “Please, Dean, please.”
Maybe it really was a ghost messing around. It’s not completely out of question. But if it was a ghost trying to get a better look at Dean, they could at least go for the good stuff like-
“No, no, no,” Dean interrupted. “I wasn’t talking about the drinking. I meant Cas.” His shoulders draw up with a rough breath. “I fucked up with Cas.”
“I can do it,” Dean offered, about to stand.
When Cas finally did come across Ellen, the older woman did indeed slap him in the head. Cas just smiled and pulled her into a hug, which she returned. She went on to chastise him about his absence and threatened him to come back soon or else next time she ran into him she wouldn’t stop at just one hit.
“Please, Dean?” Cas asks softly, and his hands come across the table, gently circling around Dean’s wrist. “I need you.”
He woke Tuesday morning in his quiet apartment and just laid in his bed for an hour staring up at the ceiling.
Dean’s eyes narrow but Cas just looks at him with a challenge, lips twitching to fight back a grin. He sighs, and finally admits, “Taco Bell.”
Cas laughed the implication away. “In a way. It’s Sam Winchester.”
Cas has no idea how to respond, not like this, not while looking into the eyes of the most special person he’s ever known. Does Dean even know how much he meant to Cas, how much better he’d made Cas’s life back then? “I used to, Santa,” Cas finds himself whispering.
“It was nice to meet you, Callie,” Dean says as she climbs out of her seat.
“Please don’t forget to read chapter fifteen,” Dean calls over the chaos. “There will be a quiz tomorrow.”
“But Dean is the one who dumped Cas.”
“And are there?”
Cas’s donor sperm.
Cas turns back toward the kitchen which is still warm and bright from Dean’s presence, and a complete starch difference from how it’s been the last few weeks.
“Dean, there’s no one here besides you and me.”
“What?”
It was Friday, so he only had one lecture. He got through it smoothly, walking the students through their next big assignment and answering any questions. Back in his office, he finished grading the rest of the papers.
“That doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t be fun. I mean, if we have to spend extra hours in this building outside of school, isn’t it kind of nice that we won’t have to see all these ugly faces?”
“Of course I do. I have… Umm…” Cas perused the shelf and began to feel smaller and smaller as nature and religion documentaries caught his eye. Dean was laughing on the couch and Cas shot him a dirty look. “Oh, shut up. I know I have to have someth- Oh!” Cas pulled a case from the shelf and turned around with a cocky grin.
Dean had been wholly unprepared to hear those words and they had triggered a flood of emotions that crashed through him like a tidal wave. Happiness, pride, glee. Guilt. Sorrow. Shame.
They meet for breakfast somewhere on the north side of the city. It’s a small place but it has great waffles and breakfast tacos and a byob policy if you want some mimosas.
“Yeah if you want Emerson to be a future leader of the Young Republicans and go on to pass bills in the senate that end funding for orphanages and clean water in underdeveloped neighborhoods.”
The siblings don’t respond and Dean knows they’re at a dead end. “I gotta head out, guys. Have a happy Yule. Or a merry Christmas. See ya.”
Dean can only take it for about two minutes before he goes to change his clothes. Sam watches him wordlessly as he comes out to fetch his shoes and jacket and, with a brief pause, the invitation on the coffee table.
“Of course it’s not,” Dean grumbles.
“Well, no. But I feel like it’s my duty to come and make sure my godchild’s first years of life aren’t spent in a beehive.”
Dean doesn’t like lying to Cas and normally an opening like this is what he dreams of. But after the way Cas has been acting since he joked about it only feeling like a date, Dean almost can’t find the courage to take it. Almost because, even though he’s terrified, there’s still that little bit of logic left that says at least if he’s honest now and gets the answer he anticipates he’ll finally be free to move on.
Cas gives the last of his strength to smile and even he can feel how brittle it is. “No. Dean was perfect. He’s always been perfect.”
Dean tries to find the right words but doesn’t have the courage to say them.
Cas gives him a dirty look.
Cas clucks his tongue. “You’re right; Michael is a dick. I guess you would be the best option, Dean.”
“But you had to know that I would always be there for you. We used to be best friends.”
“Okay.” There was a hint of tears in Jess’s voice. “But don’t become a stranger this time, okay? You still have to come around and be our friend.”
The tears come before he’s even aware he’s going to cry and all he can do is stand there and let them fall.
” a young but authoritative voice says.
Strike two.
“Dude, I’ll take care of it. You just make sure I don’t crash into anything.”
Dean smiles. “I am. He’s a great guy. I’m lucky to have found him.” Sometimes Dean doesn’t even know how it happened. He and Brady came from such different worlds it was a miracle they were ever even in the same room. But somehow it happened and Dean’s never been happier.
Dean blows out a breath. This really isn’t his thing — hell, he can’t even remember the last time he stretched. But as he observes, he can see a noticeable change in the pregnant people in the room and Cas’s scent is just a tad softer so obviously it has some sense to it. He closes his eyes and rolls his head as instructed, sucking in steady, deep breaths.
Cas frowns at him like he’s crazy until understanding softens his features. “Junior year?”
It was Jess.
“You smell like him,” Lisa says as she walks past him.
Dean smiled at Cas’s suspicious expression. “Of course. I wasn’t going to spend our entire first anniversary not knowing what you were talking about.”
Dean exhaled. “Oh. Okay. What vacation?”
It was the perfect year because his parents were on some haunted house tour in Europe and Grandmother had passed years ago so Cas didn’t have to worry about sending her to an early grave when he put Santa and his eight reindeer on top of her house. Gabe had inherited the old Victorian but he and Cas were sharing the space and he’d pretty much given Cas free reign.
You still are.
He smiles back, not caring how dopey he probably looks, because this is Cas and he’s here and Dean had missed him.
Cas followed him with the breadsticks bag and their glasses. He washed them and put them away and Dean watched from the other side of the kitchen with a knotting stomach because he knew what needed to come next.
“Yeah, I’m dying to know who had the pleasure of being satisfied by the great Dean Winchester so thoroughly,” Charlie says with an almost purr that in any other situation would have had Dean falling over backwards laughing. But now it just makes him feel sick.
“Does Cas know?” The question comes from Gabe and his normally cheerful tone is chilly and Dean can’t help the response of irritation he feels.
Dean faintly remembered being hugged before Sam and Charlie led him out of the house. Sam took the keys to the Impala, forcing Dean into Charlie’s bright yellow contraption.
“Love you, Cas.”
“I bet it was Anna,” Dorothy whispers conspiratorially to Charlie.
Dean blushes bright red and rubs the back of his neck. “Uh, yeah, hope you don’t mind. I brought a change of clothes last night but Callie puked on them around midnight. Sorry.”
Dean takes an involuntary step into the room, body prepared to give Cas whatever he needs. But then he stops and bites his lip. “Cas, we can’t.”
A thousand ways to respond circled through Dean’s head and every one of them ended with Dean clinging to Cas and refusing to let him leave, begging him not to go. Instead he just smiled back and said, “Yeah, you too, Cas.”
Cas breathes slowly and manages to smile in turn. “Well, thank you, Deanna.”
“Um, a little help?”
“I don’t know,” Dean whispers back. “We probably need to have a conversation about what happened. Guess I should talk to Kara too.”
Cas’s eyebrows drew together. “For what?”
Dean meets him, the alpha’s hands landing possessively on Cas’s hips and pulling him close, careful of his stomach. Cas feels more slick leak out of him and he breathes more of the scent of thunderstorms like he can fill his body with Dean’s lightning.
“-with my mind.”
Charlie and Gilda show up fashionably late as per usual. Gilda looks lovely in her gold dress and Charlie is as sharp as they come in a black suit. They remove their masks and speak with Cas for a moment.
Before he can think more of it, Meg crashes into him and he can smell the liquor on her breath before she even speaks.
Cas looks at her best friend as if she’s lost her mind. “You’re going to make this?”
“Will you be safe?”
Dean is bent over lacing up his boots. When he straightens up he looks half-asleep until he blinks and suddenly there’s that over easy smile that caught Cas’s heart in the first place.
It’s a balcony like right out of a Disney movie with intricate balusters and a dark stone appearance.
“I don’t want the aunts involved. I don’t want anyone involved because there’s nothing to get involved in. This isn’t a gift; it’s a sign that Dean needs better clothing.” The last thing Cas needs right now are the elders swarming around the house. This is supposed to be his year — his Christmas. He won’t have it ruined because his siblings think he has some superpower.
Because he and Cas — they had never done anything like… that. God knows Dean had longed to, hoped and wished on every miraculous star he could spot through the city smog. But Cas had never given Dean any sign or indication that he was even the tiniest bit interested in Dean as anything more than a friend. So Dean hid the feelings behind a smile, grateful to be able to call Cas friend at all.
The hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand up. “What’s that supposed to mean?” he says, far too defensive.
Cas laughs and it warms Dean where the cool air is now starting to sting his once flushed skin. “I know, Dean.”
Two days.
He stares at the alpha now, still chatting about his students, and tilts his head. He’s spent a lot of time wondering what Dean might smell like. Maybe something piney or fresh cut grass with hints of maple. Sandalwood and bourbon. Coffee and the earth after a rainstorm or maybe-
“You know I don’t have a problem with a beer or two but you can’t be drinking twelve packs on the job. You’re gonna get yourself hurt.”
He swallows. “Five.”
Cas doesn’t respond for a long moment and Dean worries that maybe Cas is one of those people who gets really weird about their clothes. When Cas looks up though he doesn’t look mad. In fact, his pupils are dilated and there’s a flush to his cheeks. He pulls on the shirt a little harder, voice pitching deeper when he says, “They look good on you.”
Cas scowls at her. “Stop reading me,” he says and storms into the kitchen.
The museum is just a few blocks away so they decide to walk. Callie is always a few steps ahead and walks with an unsettling amount of confidence for a seven-year-old. She’s quiet and it’s awkward and Dean kind of just wants to let it stay that way. But there’s another voice telling him to be a damn adult and talk to the kid.
He feels his baby give a soft kick and he grins. Okay, the three of them.
“Whose house is this?”
“Well, your mom is also a very good person.”
The attendant reaches under his desk and pulls the tickets out, passing them to Dean with a brochure of the museum. “Enjoy.”
“You know what, Sam?” Dean interrupted. He lifted his head. “I don’t want to talk about this.”
Cas offers a half smile. “It’s fine. I know it wasn’t your fault.”
Cas empties the contents of the bags over the counter but the mistletoe is nowhere to be found. Where the hell had he put the damn thing? He could have sworn he set it on top of the-
Dean’s eyes widened, the light of the setting sun reflecting in them like pools of fire.
Cas slides his arms back around Dean’s middle and pulls him close, this time Dean settling his face in Cas’s neck. He feels his husband relax against him, any last traces of stress or worry melting away.
“Einstein was a theoretical physicist, Dean, not an herbalist,” was Cas’s grumbled response. “And, no, I don’t have a second.”
“Now whose the thief?” Dean teases.
Cas rolls his eyes, tries to look put out, but his smile is still there and he pushes back into Dean. “Thank you.”
and touch and taste and he won’t waste a single second of it.
Dean rolled his eyes—well, tried to—and lifted the glass to his lips. He was sloppy and quite a bit dripped down his chin but he got the whole glass down. Cas took the glass before Dean did something stupid with it.
Hesitantly, Cas steps closer and lowers himself into the seat as Dean pushes him in. “What a gentleman,” Dean hears him rumble, a soft tone of amusement in his voice.
“Have you discussed Balthazar’s parental rights?” An elderly woman’s voice carries to Dean from the next room over, piquing his attention. He edges his body closer to the doorway, staying hidden but near to enough to follow the conversation.
They watch from the sidelines as Callie blows out her candles and Cas and Balthazar pass out pieces of cake and scoops of ice cream. When everyone has finished eating, they progress into presents. Callie tries to maintain a smile throughout all of them but Dean can see the effort when she unwraps a few dolls and dresses. Even he frowns at a few of them. But whenever it gets tough she looks over to him and he gives her a thumbs up and she muscles on.
“It’s a nice place,” Dean says feeling a need to defend it and not understanding why.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Dean grouched.
“Today,” Donna continues, “we’ll be familiarizing ourselves with omega anatomy-getting to know and understand your bodies-”
Dean smiles sadly and reaches out with his thumb to wipe away her tears. “Wish I could, kiddo. But listen, you’re gonna go home with your daddy and spend some time together. And maybe I can come over tomorrow and hang out, how about that? Cook you whatever you want.”
By the time senior began, it felt less like a relationship and more like a friendship on the brink of exile. They were spending less and less time together. Started arguing when they did manage to squeeze in a few hours. They couldn’t go out together without someone trying to steal Dean away and eventually Cas’s jealousy and irritation turned to guilt. This was Dean’s dream after all. How could Cas claim to love him and yet resent this part of his life? And who was he to hold Dean back?
Cas looks between the two of them and frowns. “I don’t think you guys fully understand the vulnerability of my situation. Deanna, is practically the poster child of the all-American heterosexual dream girl-”
The first time Dean steals from Cas, they’re five years old and blowing off steam on the playground before nap time. Cas is playing with his action figures near the swings, lost in a world of talking puppies and grand adventures.
“What’s wrong?” Cas asked.
“Thanks again for agreeing to help me,” Cas says.
“I know but it’s the way you said it.”
But that’s not an option. The biological father didn’t want to be involved and in all honestly, Cas didn’t want him to be either. Cas didn’t want to say the night they’d spent together was a mistake because he was quite happy with the result, but he would prefer it he had fallen into bed with someone who was less of a mess. Someone kind and respectful and funny, someone affectionate and charming even when he had no right to be. Someone with a great smile and beautiful eyes, someone who smelled like-
“Me too.”
“I’m sorry,” the boy who Cas has learned is named Dean says, in a very soft and quiet voice. “I’m sorry for being a thief.”
He runs and then jogs and then stumbles as far as he can, not completely clear on his direction or intended destination. Just knows it needs to be far from where he was.
Cas has learned to live with it, though. Even if he had nothing special to offer, he could still be useful. He had a mind for science and a steady hand, so he’d inherited the apothecary from his grandmother. He spends his days tending the gardens, blending salves and ointments and herbal teas. Their business had grown quite nicely under his guidance, drawing in a bigger crowd seeking all-natural health and beauty projects. He was proud of his work and the life he’d built around it.
Cas goes taunt, his entire body locking down around Dean and his teeth sink into Dean’s flesh. Dean howls, his knot popping instantly and he bites into Cas. The euphoria that courses through him is harsh and relentless and so damn delicious. He feels himself coming inside Cas, flooding him with his seed and he goes slack-jawed, teeth easing out of Cas as he sinks back against the headboard. Cas slumps against him, head on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Wanna do a full field sobriety test on me?”
“Well, I’ll do better next time,” Dean promises her. “What things do you like? What are the kids into these days?” He says it in his best old man impression and hears Cas snort.
“Islam versus Christianity, huh?” a tired British voice mocked. “How original.”
Dean looks up from the soapy water. “What? Why?”
“Oh.” It’s all he says and Dean doesn’t know what to derive from that but starts to get the feeling that he’s in trouble. That feeling is verified a moment later when the scent of a bitter beta wafts softly from the seat next to him.
“Gross, Dad,” she says with an obvious sneer before turning her attention to the alpha. “Pops, is the food almost done?”
“Long everything,” Cas groans. “When did her fever break?”
The kiss is shaky and tastes kind of salty. But Deanna returns it with just as much care, releasing Cas’s hands to wrap around her waist and hold her close.
At that very moment, Dean would have welcomed a thousand deaths. Anything that would take him out of this. As it is, all he has are his two feet and they start backing up toward the kitchen without even being told. "I... I'm sorry, Cas. I'm just... I have to-" he turns to flee and-
“Oh my god, are you okay?” Kara asks, her eyes big and concerned.
“You know what, Cas?” Jess asked, leaning over the table toward him.
Cas leans out of the kiss, smiling as Dean chases his lips, and looks down. And his heart falls to his stomach.
The ladder wobbles and Cas reaches out with his arms burdened by the last few strands of lights to stabilize it. “Gabriel left with Anna almost two hours. Now will you please be careful and hurry up so we can go inside?”
Cas snapped at himself.
“Look, I was with you through the whole process. You never would have picked someone you thought wouldn’t be good for your child. And you have good judgement. So if you really think introducing Callie to her donor father is for the best and you say he’s a good guy, then do it.”
“What happened?” he managed to ask.
Cas feels a little drunk, his body looser than before and leaning closer, until their lips just barely brush again and he whispers with all his affection, “Thief.”
“I was terrified.” The words fall from his mouth without thought. “Because I thought you were the one too. But no one meets the love of their life at nineteen.”
She eyes her father before mustering up the ghost of a smile and Dean has a weird moment of deja vu. “I mean, we can’t wait.” Then she spins and dashes back into the apartment.
. No one could ever accuse Meg or being unthoughtful.
Dean frowns. “What?”
He was just frozen there.
Dean nods because it’s the only response he can think of. He hasn’t disclosed everything that’s been going on the past few months with his team. Not even Benny. They’ve known about the breakup for a while, but Dean never gave them the full story. They knew Dean was out of work so long because he was hospitalized, but they don’t know why and, out of politeness or maybe fear of being fired, they’ve never asked.
Deanna grins and motions Cas inside. “Hey, Cas! Step on in and see where the magic happens.”
“Oh. And there’s no one else who could do it?” Brady asks, leaning into Dean’s chest. “I was hoping we could do something on your day off.”
Neither Anna nor Gabe say anything for a moment and Cas is left to look between his younger siblings as they process his story.
Cas doesn’t say anything when Dean passes by and Dean doesn’t expect him to. The party guests split like the Red Sea as Dean approaches the front door, still not making a sound.
Dean grimaced but accepted a cracker. “Thanks.” He nibbled on an edge.
Cas pursed his lips. “Are you okay, Dean?”
“There’s nothing to talk about.”
Dean pauses on his way to take another bite. “Why do you know these things?”
He opens the door and hits a wall of cold air like it’s solid ice.
There’s some more clanging and then shuffling and a moment later, the door swing opens. Deanna stands there, skin shining with a layer of sweat, tank top clinging to her body and her trusty flannel tied around her waist. She’s got her hair pulled back and huge goggles sitting on top of her head. It’s almost silly but also somehow the hottest thing Cas has ever seen and her mouth feels dry as a desert.
“Oh.” Cas smiles back. “He does. He really does.”
Cas doesn’t respond — can’t, really. He watches Dean walk toward the front gate and promptly spins on his heel and runs into the house.
Breakfast is salvaged and they gorge themselves on crepes, making sure to leave just enough for Cas in case he shows up hungry. Callie wanders off to the guest room to play while Dean cleans up.
“Hello, Dean.”
They walk up to their apartment in silence and Dean unlocks the door with shaking fingers.
Cas was a quiet guy, but he wasn’t exactly the nervous type. There were actually very few things that got to Cas. But Dean had. Dean had seen a type of anxiety that boarded on fear in Cas’s eyes. And he had put it there.
“Dinner is good but could use more vegetables. Daddy says you should have at least two with dinner every day.”
“Where’s Cas?” Dean asks, needing to get far away from her.
Dean’s smile agrees with him. “I think you mean today.”
Just as he starts planning something from dinner, he gets a text from Dean that he’s pulling a double and for a moment he can feel his blood boil. It feels like they haven’t seen each other in over a week and Cas misses his boyfriend.
“Just what I said. I’m not going.”
Deanna doesn’t respond, still staring almost dumbfounded, and slowly deflates, arms dropping to her sides. Defeated. “Okay, Cas.”
Dean heats up. “Oh, yeah, sorry about that. I’ve um, I’ve been sick.”
Sam bowed his head. “I’m sorry, Cas.”
They began moving.
They eat in silence for a few minutes and it takes a while for Dean to notice the subtle shift of the scent in the room. Since getting pregnant, Cas hasn’t been taking his blockers or suppressants — they weren’t healthy for the baby. Dean still took his daily, but like the teenage miasma in the hallways, sometimes bits of Cas’s scent seeped through. Always soft, just a hint of what he truly smelled like, but Dean could still pick up the distinct note of nervousness mingling in the honey and clemetine scent of the omega.
“Anything for you, kiddo,” he says into her sweet-smelling hair. “What do you say we walk back out there and show them there’s a new sheriff in town?”
Cas tries to take a deep breath and calm down. “No, I know. But I’ve been so angry with you and I felt like I was going insane because I kept thinking you were… I don’t even know. I can’t believe you were going through that without me. Who- was it because of Brady?”
“Sam said your prom date may have backed out on you. Is that true?”
“Well, Cas, I’d say another job well done,” Dean says, appraising his work.
He cleaned up the fresh vomit, tossed load of laundry into the washer, collected all of the empty bottles and cans.
*****
“Didn’t go well, I take it?” Dean asks grimly.
“I don’t know, Deanna. It just… doesn’t feel special anymore.”
“When you were busy yelling at Garth about fake candles or something.”
“Kudos for even knowing a football team, Jess.”
Dean hissed, hand over his wounded pride. “You swore to secrecy.”
Cas shakes his head again, his body refusing to accept the idea. “No. I’m not a witch. I don’t- I’m just not.”
“Pick something,” he says, gesturing to the radio.
Dean’s fingers closed around the glass. He lifted it and took a deep whiff. It smelt like relief.
Luckily, the waiter returns then. Dean busies himself signing the receipt and leaving a generous tip.
Shame for not already wrapping Cas up in a hug and congratulating him.
Dean snorts. “That’s one way to describe it.”
Dean stands at his stove, juggling a few pots and pans. He’d been overwhelmed with a need to busy himself the second he’d gotten home from his date. It had gone just about as well as Dean thought it would — stunted, awkward, and a little too forced.
Dean snorts. “Now you’re just buttering me up. Go eat your breakfast.”
Cas frowns at him. “Because we weren’t talking, Dean.”
Dean faced the bartender. “Actually, make that a double Jack.”
And maybe that’s what Cas truly needs. Not some desperate idiot trying to show him a good time, but a true friend with no ulterior motives.
But just as he opens his mouth the oven timer goes off and Dean is moving out of his reach.
“What’s the crisis, ladies?” Deanna asks and the cheer in her voice makes Cas want to grind her teeth.
Cas blinks. “What?”
“Yes.”
When he returned to the room Dean was up. He learned against the headboard, one hand on Cas’s pillow. He looked up at Cas who froze in the doorway, water still dripping down the side of his head, took in Cas in his clothes, the suitcase by the door. He didn’t say anything and Cas wasn’t sure what words could suit the situation. But Dean gave a nod, as if to accept it, and Cas continued to get this things together.
“D-Dean,” Cas stutters. “Dean, more, please.”
“Sorry, sweetheart,” he apologizes and lets the omega nuzzle into him, his scent growing around them to calm his nerves.
Cas rolls his eyes and steals another kiss for good measure before accepting Dean’s offerings. “I’ll see you later. Thank you!”
“To Sam!” the rest of them chorused and tossed their drinks back.
He feels jittery the entire ride up the elevator, fingers drumming on his thighs, and he hates himself for how nervous he is to see his best friend. He never wanted things to turn out like this between he and Cas, which is why he had always kept his crush to himself in the first place. And yet, it had still found a way to bite him in the ass.
“Ohhhhhh, that sounds fun,” Charlie gushed. “I’ve never been to India. Always wanted to go explore the wonders of Bollywood.”
Sam gritted his teeth. “I swear, if you hadn’t almost died today, I would punch you right now.”
Charlie shrugs her shoulders, sending her red hair over her back. “I’m not the one in denial of my feelings.”
The time they spend kissing in the doorway is healing, like every touch erases a moment of loneliness felt in the last eight months. But it’s not long. Because whether they like it or not, they still have work to do.
“I would like a Nintendo Switch,” Claire answers proudly.
“Are him and Cas a thing?”
“Castiel, love, I believe I’ve found something you’ve been searching for.”
Cas says yes. Several times over.
“He’s a museum curator,” Dean corrects, “but yeah.”
The meetings continue as the season does and soon Dean is a casual acquaintance in Cas’s life. They see each other at least once every weekend going out with friends. They don’t talk to each other often and when they do it’s simple pleasantries. Cas eventually works up the courage to congratulate Dean on his team’s winning streak. To his surprise, Dean actually smiles and he shares a story that this time last year would have told while they were in bed, Dean’s arms around wrapped around Cas’s waist and he would kiss Cas’s bare shoulder every time he laughed. It’s the longest conversation they’ve had since the split and Cas barely hears a word of it because he can’t help thinking the setting is all wrong.
