Sure enough, Dean walks up at him with a scowl, but doesn't say anything, which is a first. Benny hands them their coffees and two cookies.
looking at Cas when he reads, he has all those emotions in his face that come and go, it’s a bit fascinating. After a few more seconds of staring, he looks down at the book in his hands and goes to sit in the armchair. It’s soft and comfortable and Dean can feel himself relax and has the absurd urge to stretch out. Instead he rolls his shoulders, opens the book and reads.
If there is one thing Dean will never admit, is enjoying the library. In the beginning he just went there because he had nowhere to go, and he needed to protect himself from the cold and rain or occasional snow. Now, he goes because he enjoys it. He always liked to read, and it is quiet in the library, people don't pay much attention to him. Everyone is there for their own purpose. It is peaceful. There is a sense of solitude, almost like the outside world can’t touch him. Sometimes he starts conversations with the people around him and it makes him feel a little like he belongs. Almost feels like he is normal.
“Dean-”
He feels particularly heavy today, like there is an extra weight on his shoulders that he can’t shake. He drinks the last of his coke and throws the can in a bin on the street. It is busy tonight, which isn’t surprising since it is Saturday, but still busier than usual. He is outside of the cinema looking around, it is pretty chilly tonight and he kind of enjoys that small sting in his skin. It makes him feel something other than dullness and resentment. He thinks about going to the bar next door for a beer, but thinks better of it, one would lead to ten. He sighs, tonight they are showing The Mummy, for the forth time. Dean knows every second of that movie, but it’s better than nothing or other movies that they had chosen to show in the past, like Mega Piranha. He shudders at that, probably the worst movie ever.
” he says the last word with such aversion, that makes Castiel think that Dean isn’t used to people caring about him and something inside him cracks.
They reach it in under five minutes, and Dean takes a sip of coffee, trying to warm himself. They walk further into the park, passing other people with their dogs, some of which seem interested at Oli and one particular Chihuahua, who seems to think of Oli as a threat and barks at him. Dean finds it amusing -even if a bit annoying-, as he did the other three mornings because Oli just walks past, only turning his head towards it and the owner, before continuing. Both of them are a bit sulky, more than the first day – though Oli was the only one sulking the first day, Dean was fine -  until Dean thinks enough is enough and gets Olivers’ attention with the ball and throws it across the open space, towards a direction where there aren’t people, not that there are a lot of people in the park at seven o’clock in mid-December.
“You are not John Entwistle-”
“It’s fine, you are free to do whatever yo-”
“Dean.” Sam says quietly, warningly.
“It’s a mutual thing.”
Dean wakes up to the feeling of warmth and he frowns, his limbs heavy and tired. He becomes aware of the weight of the duvet that doesn’t smell like his own and then, of someone watching him, making goosebumps erupt in his skin. He opens his eyes taking him a moment to adjust to the light. He turns his head to the side to look at Castiel properly and lets out something between a breath and a sigh.
He needs to stop this, it’s not like he will see Dean again, or the possibilities of that are very slim to none.
Before he knows it, he is standing, yet again, in front of him. After a few seconds, he lifts his head to look at Castiel. He has a confused look on his face, that lasts for just a moment before it is replaced with surprise and then soft annoyance.
“Would you” Castiel starts but stops himself. He seems hesitant and a bit scared.
Apart from his mind.
“What?”
Jack’s eyes well up and Dean sighs. “Here’s the thing, I’m not going to forgive myself for what happened before, but that doesn’t mean that we are not good or going to be good- better.” Dean will be damned if they aren’t.
“I know they do, it’s why most them come back. Well, mostly because I’m a pretty face” He tries for light but it comes out bitter and like he wants to add something but doesn't.
Oli does it again and again.
“You mean… genuine” he says like his tasting the words rather than speaking them.
Castiel nods and passes him the letter. Inias eyes widen and looks at him frowning.
He is almost finished when the door opens and a guy walks out, his cheeks are slightly flashed and he seems disheveled and something akin to anger ignites in Dean. Before he has time to muse on that reaction the guy smiles at him and Hannah crookedly, and she bids him goodbye, then presses a button on her office phone and after several seconds a light flashes from it.
Sam of course tries discussing it with him after he returned over dinner, but Dean curls in on himself, lowers his head and hardly eats after that. He can feel Jack’s worry rolling off him in waves and Sam’s agonizing concern. He can see their pity. It’s not in Sam’s face, he knows how to hide things, but Dean knows him better than anyone, can see it when he adverts his eyes, in the split seconds, in the way he moves around him. Jack, he tries, but he isn’t very good at lying or concealing his emotions.
“Right. Sorry” comes the response and he sounds absolutely wrecked and Dean shivers at the sound of his voice. He feels him, shift and lift himself and then there is light. Well not too much just the bedside lamp. But it’s enough.
It frustrates them and by the second day Dean is climbing up the walls.
“Yes, we were supposed to meet for lunch but,” he shrugs as a way of explanation. Castiel frowns more at him, head titling to the side.
Dean looks at him expectantly and when Cas’s expression doesn’t change for a time he continues to look at him, and Cas finally gets it.
“So you killed their husbands? Real mature. You are a real star, you know that?” he turn his head away from her staring at the bottles on the self.
“I thought we fight for what we believe in, for what it’s right. You taught me that.” Sam says.
He presses his lips in a tight line as he stares at the photographs of the victims on the pinboard. They found another body this morning, making them five. He was expecting another one considering the pause of one week, a man like that doesn't just stop. He is gripping his cup a little too tights and sets on the table before he snaps the cup.
“Oh. Right. The wedding cake.” he is getting married, to someone that probably looks like Anna. “Told you she’d be fine with it”
He frowns down at the pavement. He doesn't mind the extra walk, in fact he believes it will help him, clear his head a bit. So, he turns around and walks the other way.
Jack doesn’t come with them. He opts staying in the Bunker continuing to catalogue and sort through the archives. Plus someone needs to take care of Miracle, and Dean would be damned to take her to a doggie day care.
“You are wrong. I admire you”
“That's a fine specimen” she says openly staring at Novak, who is now getting inside his car, and Dean splutters. “I’ve seen him a few times before on campus”
“Nothing” Cas interrupts him finally looking at him and he has a look in his eyes that Dean hates. It makes him hate that sick bastard even more. He sighs, Castiel turns and looks out the window again.
“What can I get you?” He says with a bit of an accent. Dean guesses it’s Cajun.
go leaving on the streets again, so food had come third, so what? He is fine, has lost a bit of weight but it’s not a problem.
“Sam, what is it?”
Dean thinks about Bobby and his dad and says, “I love you and I’m proud of you and I want to spend time with you.” He says slowly and deliberately, partly for Jack and partly for himself for the part of him that tells him to shut up and go to his room. “That’s not going to change and right now-” he stops, swallowing, “Right now I don’t want to be around anyone, even Sam and the forcing now, it’s with him too.  Because part of it is-”
“It is like you are not even trying. I hope you liked the conversation with Aaron” His stomach turns as he says the words and feels himself lose some of his anger, defeat and bitterness taking its place.
His skin feels all wrong, clammy and buzzing and he has the urge to scratch it off, instead he gets up and goes to the bathroom. He takes his shirt and boxers off, avoiding looking in the mirror.
“Castiel” the name feels weird in Dean’s mouth, heavy and full, his lips awkward as he pronounces it, “filter’s fine. I don’t care as long as it’s drinkable”
“He is my father.” Michael says seriously and like that explains and excuses everything.
“Yes, but that’s not a poem” he says, tone perfectly neutral, he takes a breath, saying slowly, “these are from the letters to his wife Maro. Well they weren’t married yet; it was quite complicated.”
It takes him a moment and he thinks back “No”, he wispers.
It all comes to a head on a Friday three weeks after Cas came back. He has been moving carefully around Dean, never too close or too far, just somewhere in the middle where it makes Dean’s skin prickle and insane with need to touch him in any way, in all ways, yet always holding himself back.
“I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw him and I- I got up and left” he can still see Dean, laying there peacefully in his bed and his chest tightens, but not for the same reason it did that night. Now it’s regret and longing “I slept in the living room”.
“I’m a fool” He whispers. “A fool that still believes”
By the time class is over, Dean is dizzy and bombarded with information. He has to give it to Novak though, he does have a way of making it interesting or it might just be his voice. Dean shivers a bit remembering the way the professor spoke, and the way his lips shaped around the words. Ok, so maybe he wasn't just paying attention on the content of the lecture, but also the person delivering it. Sue him.
Castiel gives him a look that makes him avert his eyes to the door at the intensity.
Castiel leaves his cup on the counter and composing himself he utters a “I’m sorry”
He scowls, “I don’t want to know.”
“Goodbye” he gets up and really, he can’t leave fast enough.
He sighs, placing the glass down with the rest of them, he knows Benny is right and yet- “I know, ok. It’s just-”
Castiel exhales roughly from his nose. “A lot of trouble to kill a prostitute. I mean, if it was just because he had seen or heard something, a bullet would have done it.”
“We’ve been over this Sam. You finish your studies and then you can start working. Got it?” And work for what? To come and see Dean? A shiver runs through him and he tries to stay composed with everything he has. The thing is he
Which ok, but still it’s weird and it makes Dean feel weird and small and-
Yeah like he is ever stepping foot in there. “I’m fine”
“There was nothing you could-”
“Good choice” Dean says with a light tone and places a pan on the stove.
He breaths deeply, listening to the leaves rustling. He looks up at the sky. The moon is just a sliver, it’s peaceful and quiet and all he can see is Cas dying. He gaps softly, pressing the heels of his palms in his closed eyes, trying to think about anything else.
He remembers her ten years ago, when he would tell her so many more things. They are still friends, well as much as two divorced people can be, but they have tried for Claire and themselves. They are days where Castiel knows that as much as they try the things they’ll say to each other won’t be nice, they’ll be bitter and full of tomorrow’s regrets. He believes today will be one of those days, from his side at least.
"It's good to see you," he is saying, voice deep and laced with relief.
This is how he finds himself nursing an americano, while Cas, and he has become
“You are right.” Castiel says evenly after a beat. “I’m sorry. I’ll be going, I have things to do”
The guy, seating on the table in front of him on the opposite chair, looks up from his book and straight at him, but Dean, upon meeting dark blue, hastily turns his eyes back on the laptops’ screen. He thinks about the literature class and shifts in his seat, perhaps he should work on that. He doesn't know. He looks ahead at the wall that has “Harmony in red”.
He moves his head to look at the clock. It’s three past six. He gets up, waking Miracle in the process and heads to the bathroom to take a piss, then goes back straight to his room.
Sam sighs and Dean, knows he is losing his patience as well, but he doesn't care. He needs Sam to understand, understand that he needs to do this for him otherwise he is completely useless. The last words are said in the voice of his father and Dean tries to breath through the pressure in his chest. Then Sam says something that makes him grip the door frame and he tries really hard to stay calm.
to see Sam, just not here, not now.
“I can’t just call?”
"I-" Dean starts, swallowing, "You-"
“It’s alright. I am just finishing up, Inias left a little while ago, his report is on your desk.”
It’s a phone number. Castiels’ phone number. Dean puts in his pocket reluctantly.
Dean doesn’t really talk much. He doesn’t come out of his room much either, only to walk Miracle after Sam calls him out on it. He drinks a lot, eats when he cannot take the hunger any longer - although he has become good at ignoring it, like when he was a kid - or when Sam forces him to.
Castiel rises from the chair he is sitting on and takes a step towards him.
conversation.
“Dean?” he asks concerned, frowning.
. Makes him sick to the stomach just thinking about it.
“You can go” she tells him “Thank you for waiting”
or something equally embarrassing, but Cas leans down and kisses him softly. Dean shudders into it, his hand moving up to cradle his face and Cas pulls back just a bit to look over his eyes with an emotion Dean can’t name before kissing him again. Deeper his arms wrapping around Dean and just holding him and Dean has to pull back because he is going to-
Dean rolls his eyes and walks in the office, ignoring Hannah’s soft laugh as he closes the door.
“I know you don't want help, but it’s for emergencies. Or anything you might need” he continues looking a bit sheepish.
“Tom”
“What?” he says feigned innocence and takes a sip, sighing, feeling some of his muscles relax.
They look at each other for a moment.
He sucks in a breath and opens his eyes.
“No.” He grits out.
“What happened to Dr Milton?” a girl asks concerned.
Dean makes a small sound at the back of his throat and feels his heart about to burst out of his chest and wants so badly to lean forward and burry himself into his embrace, let that warmth, barely contained in his chest, spill and burn him.
“Listen, if it comes to it I don't know. I’m not saying I want to die. I don't.” he is a bit irritated now. “But-”
“Where is the lube?” he asks, tongue coming out to wet his lips, and watches as Castiel heavy lidded tracks the movement.
You’ll see worse, Dean doesn’t tell her.
Maybe he needs to get laid outside of work. He snorts at that and the woman, sitting on the table next to his, gives him a disapproving look and he just rolls his eyes. He glances towards the counter and sees Castiel, holding a large cup of coffee and walking towards the exit.
“Don't say it’s ok. It’s not”
“Yeah” Dean says distractively, opening the back door and throwing his bag inside, he looks up at her ready to tell her he will never get used to it or just get better, but the words die in his throat as his eyes catch on something or someone.
Sam hums glancing out the window and back at Castiel, as he drives to the university parking lot.
His hands are shaking and there is something wet in the corners of his eyes and he tries to fight them in vain. In the end he just lays there crying silently with the sound of his neighbour fucking in the background. Because he doesn't explode or deflate, he just feels something cracking further, somewhere in his chest.
They both frown at him.
“Ok, what if we tried to find what pissed her off in the first place and work from there.” Sam says and Dean finally turns to look at him.
He doesn't move to get up though, needs five more minutes, even if his stomach rumbles.
Castiel purses his lips in a tight line. “Hannah, please contact his family” he says and swallows. “He was a sex worker, which means he would hang around at the area we are going to go there tonight to ask around”
“He told me it was going to be ok. That he- that I was going to be ok” she says when he doesn’t and does take a tissue now. “He was such a lair. Nothing is ok and all I see, even in my sleep it’s-” She blows her nose softly.
“That drawer.” He sounds far too composed and it takes a moment for Dean to catch up.
“ ‘night” he says and Castiel turns around and walks towards the bar.
When Dean continues to look at him Novak adds “I don't know what else to tell you.” Dean frowns at him, and Novak looks troubled “Your points are good, and what you are trying to say is insightful, but you need to work on they way you write it.”
, as a force of habit, but stops himself. It’s dump and pointless.
“I am on call.” Then he adds with a small smile, like he is trying to reassure him. “Nothing happened”
“I’m on call. I’ll drive you” he repeats staring at Deans eyes intensely, in a way he knows the other man will not say no to him. When Dean averts his eyes to the ground, Castiel turns to Donna and gives her a small smile. “Have a good day”
“See?” Sam asks.
“It has to do with everything” Crowley says seriously. “Castiel, it is beyond time you moved on. And you know that”
“Not if they pretended he was still alive”
There is nothing but their breaths now and their eyes, and it’s so loud but Dean can’t look away. He has a strange thought then; he doesn’t want to forget him. He doesn’t want to forget the exact blue of his eyes or the way his voice sounds or his face or the way his skin feels. There is a desperation along with the thought, as if he does ever forget him, he will lose something monumental.
, he wants to say, but doesn't.
Dean sighs small, some defeat and exhaustion slipping in there, “When they call me, the schools, they expect to meet a sensible middle aged guy, who is his dad and instead, they get me. A twenty six year old mechanic, with a GED and I’m just his brother who barely-” another sigh, he hangs his head. He hates this shit. Parent teacher meetings with snobbish people, who make comments on how Sam is there on scholarship, with no real parents in a passing way, that is like a knife twisting inside Dean.
“I’m more of a coffee guy, but sure” he says shrugging, moving further into the room and placing the bag on the counter.
“I don't- What do you want me to say?” he asks Dean, maybe a little exasperated and yes Dean has that effect on people.
He glances back at the house, and want wins over logic and he gets out of the car, crosses the street, climbs the steps leading to the door and stops right there. He glances to the side where the bell is and after a second, he rings once, and waits.
Sam jolts in his seat, his head lifting fast in an abrupt ungraceful movement that it would be funny in a different setting. His eyes are wide, staring at Dean as if he has grown another head or he has finally lost it.
Dean just nods, because really that's all he can do and that seems to satisfy her. He has already heard that and more from Rowena, but it’s not like he can do anything at the moment. Besides in a while, hopefully, everything will go back to the way it was before. Or maybe he will have to expand his hours.
The office is exactly as he remembers it, with two bookshelves behind the desk filled with files, all the same pale blue colour, which he finds a little unsettling, divided by the painting, that after googling it because it is impressive, of the fall of the damned by Rubens. And like the last time he was here, his leg is tapping on the carpet and he cannot make it stop. The only difference is the smell of ginger and something else he can’t quite place, in the air.
He looks the same. Lanky, blonde but now with more grey hair, same beard, same posture. And so harmless. He is like everyone else.
“It’s not that bad. I actually enjoyed reading the many ways he thought he should end the book.”
, every time he touches a bottle. Joins them at board games with Eileen, even goes to the movies with them one night.
now, though he hasn't called him that out loud, because it feels like crossing a line, is sipping his pumpkin latte.
“I know, but you felt it. And it was not your fault” anyone hearing him would think that he is calm, but Dean can catch the anger underneath his tone. He knows it’s not directed at him.
Dean ends up leaving two hours later and when he gets home Oli whines at him rightfully so. He pets him and apologizes to him, before they leave for the evening walk. It’s pretty late, nearing midnight, and the cold has turn sharper, piercing Deans’ face and his nose feels like it will fall off. But nevertheless, he plays with Oli, who is excited to run around. At least someone is enjoying this.
He always wondered if it was Cas, if had seen him, his true self, but Cas not to traumatize Dean, had locked it away from his awareness. He shivers at the thought, rolls on his side and tries to fall asleep.
His eyes skim through the word document and he scrolls down. He is frowning making Dean sink in his seat,
“What if you stayed?” Castiel asks slowly, meaningfully. His eyes hopefully, with uncertainty clouding over. Dean wants to kiss him stupid, wants to close the gap between them and stay there forever.
“Make some noise, would you” she says with no real bite behind her words.
He leaves them next to the sink before taking a piss. He ponders if taking a quick shower is a good idea and he decides that it is. Cas did a good job at cleaning him up last night, the memory making his chest ache so he pushes it to the back of his mind, but still he needs to shower.
“Anything else?” He asks after a minute or two.
“Oh, so all these are excusable because someone pissed her off?” he knows his voice is rising and he knows he should try to keep it leveled but all he can see is Esme in her kitchen.
“Ok.” he starts, “Listen,-” he stops losing his words.
“But I should have been paying attention, instead of-” the nurse, Hael, opens the door interrupting him.
It hurts, it hurts so fucking much and sometimes Dean thinks he can’t breathe.
Dean grips the sleeve of his trench coat in his hand and the other one goes to the side of his head, fingers thread through soft locks. God, he missed this, he doesn’t know how he went so long without kissing him.
“You want something to eat or drink?” He asks looking at Castiel, who looks nervous as he looks around.
So Dean makes an effort, eats a little more, drinks less - even if he has mostly quit that on his own -  somehow sees Cas’ face and hears his words,
“Alright then. But now let’s go back to Camus”
“I know. I just…need to finish this”
“Mostly?” Dean interrupts her.
“Do you want to talk about it?” she asks in a modulated voice and he shrugs, “We can continue next week.”
He goes straight to the parking lot, finding Baby easily among the other cars. He throws his bag in the seat next to him and sighs, covering his face with his hands and breathing for minute. “You can do this, come on” he mutters to himself and starts the car.
Dean takes a step back in answer and shakes his head.
Five months later when he burns the bones of the two nuns, he goes to the payphone outside the motel he has been staying and calls Bobby.
He makes a chocked noise and straightens abruptly. He needs to leave now.
miserable” he interrupts him, his tone almost bitter.
“Yeah, but” he lifts his head to look at him, “It was good that you were there”
He remembers a blinding light, that in the first few days after he returned from Hell it was just a fleeting thing, but if he pushed his mind harder he was able to hold it longer.
“I am good” he says it carefully, frowning at the cup in front of him and Dean can tell his hands are fidgeting in his lap.
“No, I am not saying that”
“The scar-”
Dean looks at Michael for a long hard moment and then gets up and leaves.
Although sometimes, in the dark of his room, he feels a profuse guilt overtake him. The reasonable part of him understands, he knows is part of letting go and moving on, and that there is nothing to be guilty about. He knows he hasn't forgotten and that he never will but it’s that striking fear that everything will start slipping from his fingers the more time he spends with Dean or anyone really. It’s like in the beginning where he thought that if he moved on, he would erase the past. Its why it was so hard for him to move from the apartment to this house. Though he now admits that it was a good choice, there were too many memories on those walls for him to let go. But the other part of him, the one that wins sometimes, tells him he what he is doing tastes like betrayal and he tries to remember a face and when he doesn't he panics and his body goes numb from fear or remorse or both.
He hears the familiar ding of the elevator doors opening, and in his peripheral vision sees someone come off and he side steps, before getting in. He doesn’t immediately glance up, still texting Sam, who apparently tried to cook Chinese and burnt the food; Dean rolls his eyes, the kid is great, but he is even greater when he is far away from the kitchen, which meaning Dean is apparently picking up food on his way home.
“Are you waiting for Sam?” Castiel asks eyes darting around.
Cas turns on his side, in response, making himself the big spoon, but he doesn’t come closer, so they don’t touch. The warmth from his body closer to Dean’s, welcoming and Dean has to stop himself mid movement from leaning his back against him.
“Here” Castiel says and offers him a glass filled with juice. Dean looks up at his face, startled maybe even a little alarmed. “You need to drink this” he tells him and Dean reaches and takes it from his hand. Then notices his other hand, as he places a glass of water at the night stand next to him.
When they are done, he takes their bowls to the sink and starts washing them, while Dean looks at him while sipping his coffee. He watches as the light reflects on his hair through the window and has a thought that makes him feel like a sap, a foolish sap and he turns his eyes to the cup in his hands, when a thought occurs to him and looks back up at Cas.
“No, really it w-” he starts but is interrupted by Becky, calling Anna.
He moans and takes a breath, resting his forehead against Deans’, whose breath is stuck in his throat and after a moment starts to move; slow, then faster, until they are both moaning and panting and they are trying to touch every inch of each other and Dean is somewhere between taking breaths and babbling nonsense.
Despite that Jack is the one that follows him, spends more time with him in the Dean cave or in the kitchen, always at the verge of saying something, it’s Sam that comes to talk to him.
He stops outside and stares at it. For a moment he thinks about leaving, but then dismisses the idea. He doesn't know why he is here. Ok he does. But it’s not easy, alright. He was never good at those stuff.
“You going to the bar?” he asks trying to shake of what he is feeling.
He doesn’t and when he says, “You don’t know that”, his voice comes out tight, if not wobbly.
When he gets inside and sits on the chair opposite of her, the first thought is that the chair is really comfortable and that her office is not what he expected. There is desk on the other side, dark brown, a bookcase taking all of a wall behind them, filled with books. It’s spacy and tidy. He feels weird, he looks out the window on his right, and watches the tree as it is being moved by the wind. He feels light and heavy at the same time.
He reaches the garage in ten minutes and goes to change into his overalls, greeting Ash on his way. He changes as quickly as possible, takes an ibuprofen for his headache and gets ready for the day.
They move inside the room and Dean unbuttons Cas’ shirt all the way, because apparently at some point before he had started doing that and had pulled it out of his slacks as well. It becomes a bit of a problem when they are both trying to remove each other’s shirts at the same time. They have to stop and take them off themselves and then they are on each other again. Dean feels the bed behind his legs and instinctively falls back pulling Cas with him. Which was a bad idea because he wasn't expecting it and Dean ends up with a painful jab on his ribs and a muffled sorry. But it’s worth it cause when they move again, Dean feels Cas’ clothed cock rub against his own and they both swallow each other’s moans.
He also knew that Cas didn’t understand everything he knew. Not completely. In the years after they met he came to understand a lot of those things, but Dean is certain he never understood everything.
Castiel nods and continues. “And it’s the way he leaves them. In a hotel room and under the sheets. They look like they are sleeping.”
Bobby sighs heavily.
“How is she picking which one?” Sam wonders, opening his tablet. “In the beginning I thought it was the men, but now with the latest victim.” He glances at Dean sympathetically. It happens so fast that Dean almost misses it.
“It’s alright”
And to his utter horror he can feel himself blush at the words. “Yeah, well it’s nothing”, he shrugs.
“Hello, Dean” Castiel says, moving gaze back to him and Dean who is still struck, tries not to think too much about how his name sounds in Castiels tongue or what it does to him.
“Cause I want to” he says and turns around hand on the handle. He knows he is being an ass, but he doesn't care.
But between losing Jack to the powers, or Amara being the one in charge, it’s not much of a choice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’d marry you” his stupid brain says before he can stop himself and he goes to correct himself, but Castiel laughs.
He removes his trench coat slowly, hangs it carefully on the coat stand and goes to sit on his chair. His back is tensed and he feels a pressure on his forehead. He sighs and rubs it in hopes for the pressure to stop.
“Good morning, everyone” he tells them finally after a minute, opening the power point, “I hope you had a good week. I know you got your essays back yesterday, and I just wanted to say one thing, it doesn't apply to all of you, but is the general theme. You need to use citations and references in the correct way, I know it is annoying, but it is a shame to lose points just for that. There is a pdf for how to write those on the course home page, make use of it. If you have any other question concerning the essay, you can ask me at the end or better during office hours; I do apologize for last week, something happened and I had to leave.”
“Yes” Novak voices needlessly and nods at Dean who gives him a nod in return. It should be awkward, perhaps it is for everyone else in the room, but Dean just feels thrilled and nervous.
“Call me, Castiel” Novak,
you seem like someone who doesn't frequent in places where they play Isakov and serve macaroons. Which is totally inappropriate to assume. Forgive me. I am having a rough week, month. Years. I am sorry, I am rambling. Sorry”
“Hey,” she greets him with a smile and Miracle immediately runs to stand in front of her waiting for Jody to pet her before she enthusiastically licks all over her hand jumping a little, “Well hi, you must be Miracle! I’ve heard so much about you.” Then she adds pointedly, “from Sam”.
“And maybe don't bring yourself down”
When the class ends and he is in the safety of the hallway, he thinks about taking the elevator to the eleventh floor, where Novaks’ office is, but instead he heads out and to the parking lot. He gets into the impala, waiting for Charlie, since he promised to drive her home, since her car is at the garage – she really needs to replace that monstrosity - and sits with his hand in the ignition. He doesn't know what does it – perhaps is the thought of Sam at home studying through it all -, but he sighs taking his bag, getting back out. He shoots Charlie a text, that he will be late and she will have to wait for him and gets out.
“I-” he stops, his throat bobbing as he swallows, tears gather in his eyes, falling down his cheeks, goosebumps rise on his skin as they dry from the cold air.
She doesn’t immediately turn to look at them, only when Amanda says, in a tone that Dean recognizes from Sam and he cringes, that they have some questions for her. She tenses for a second and then turns to them, her lips are chapped, her nose is red, her eyes are swollen and there is an anguish and a vacancy in them. Dean swallows averting his eyes unable to look at her long.
In the beginning it was hard with Jimmy. He was so similar but so achingly not.
“He is not my boy” he shouts after her annoyed and flustered.
. He nods and Castiel finally pushes in and Dean closes his eyes in bliss. It’s a wonderfully stretch and his whole body is on fire from the pleasure and he hears himself moan, when Castiel begins to move in a moderate pace. He feels lips against his, kissing him softly and he tries to respond, but he too far lost and Castiel stops, raising his face, just enough and whispers, “Open your eyes” and Dean responds, drowning in blue.
“I have a lead” she says sitting up straight and placing both her palm on the file, her eyes gleaming. Castiel understands what it means to her, all the sleepless nights, all the dead ends and finally something, and by the looks of it something solid. He can’t help but feel a little jealous, his case is practically frozen.
A girl, who Dean has come to recognize since she participates a lot, and because her voice is quite high, thankfully not too unpleasant “Professor, do you think that a PhD is a good thing to have?”
“Is he… missing?” Dean asks narrowing his eyes slightly in question.
After four years with her, they offered him the position of detective in the homicide department and though he really liked working with her, he found that the that department suited him more.
“Are you relatives?” she asks with annoyance, crossing her arms.
. Explains the body posture.
“Isn’t he your boss?”
“Because you haven’t been eating properly. Or just eating”
“Fuck it” he mutters, ringing the bell.
He remembers dad dropping both of them off at Bobby's. He remembers he didn’t say anything for the next two days and Bobby didn’t push.
Novak turns his eyes to him, and looks at him as if Dean just said the most ridiculous thing in the world, or perhaps that he can’t believe that he is real. “It can wait” he tells him, mirth in his eyes.
At that Cas smiles and it reaches his eyes, “Great. I’m happy for you”
There are four bruises,
She matches his glare with a wolfish look and smirk that makes her unfairly alluring. “I can take it away, you know.”
Novak is seating on his desk typing on his laptop while scowling at it and doesn't look up, even when Dean shuffles closer to the desk. He only looks up when Dean drops in the seat in front of his desk.
“Yes, and he reminds me of the other man that was found about six months ago, even though their death was different, body condition is similar”
It is a heavy win. The weight that was lifted from their shoulders when they defeated Chuck comes back just a notch, still enough to make Dean roll his shoulders his back stiff. There is an electrifying thrill hitting him in waves, his heart beats a mile a minute; there is a hysteric laugh that is fighting to come out of his mouth but he swallows down, or maybe he just wants to through himself outside of the car. Could be both.
He has a few people in mind and makes a mental note to remember to do that tomorrow.
He suddenly feels the need to bolt, so Castiel won’t see him or worse talk to him. He has no idea why he feels this way, it’s not exactly shame but it is pretty close and he needs to leave. He doesn't like how he reacts when he is around Castiel, he is moving between comfort, which is ridiculous, shame and a sense like there is an abyss between them that, for whatever reason, Dean feels he can cross.
Dean picks it up, twirling it in his hands, “What about it?”
Cas smiles down at him, and a few tears escape his eyes. “I love you too. So much, sometimes I can’t breathe”
Here’s the thing, Dean doesn’t know how to love him this close like that and openly, when he is right there, within reach. So, he doesn’t. He still loves him, he still aches a good ache, in his chest, that means Cas is alive, he is with them. He still loves him in the morning when he goes to the library with a cup of coffee and Cas is right there across from him. He loves him when they go grocery shopping, and Cas picks up boxes, reading at the back with a slight squint and a head tilt and Dean nearly drops the packet of pasta he is holding. He just doesn’t love him to him.
Dean sits up and takes Cas face between his hands and kisses him hard and he is positive he has never kissed anyone so much before, hell he has never had so many kisses in his life. But it doesn't matter, cause Cas is divine and it is the only response to how the guy looks right now. Because yes Cas is hot, but Cas now, now he is the most beautiful thing Dean has ever seen.
They stop in a town before Columbus when Dean can hardly keep his eyes open. They get a room on the first motel they find and Dean removes his jacket, shoes and jeans before climbing on top of one of the beds. He acts like he doesn’t see Sam’s disapproving face, but he is exhausted. So much so that he thinks that he will fall asleep straight away, might make it through the night without a nightmare, he really doesn’t want to have that conversation with Sam.
“You said the photograph is old” He tells him, narrowing his eye slightly. Dean huffs a laugh.
Still, he can’t help but ask stupid, feeling like a kid, “Yeah?”
"I know." Bobby says and there is an arm around him and Dean chokes curling on himself, stilling. Then Bobby's other hand comes around him, cradles his head and brings him in a hug.
Dean feels himself blush, and tells the smug smirking asshole, “That's for when you speak”
He walks towards the back where the beginning of the small forest starts and half sits half leans against one of the big rocks there.
“Ok, alright” Dean says, wrapping his own arms around Sam and letting tears fill his eyes.
“Is fine” Dean says standing up, “I’m going anyway”
She moves closer until her arm touches his. She is warm. He holds himself from pulling away.
“Ok. Oh, Dean?” he turns around and looks at her raising his eyebrows in question.
“Yep” he takes the three first papers that he has been holding and hands them to her. She gives him a tight smile, that is gone in an instant and skims through the first form, she nods at the end and places it on the desk and goes through the second one. Dean feels exposed all of the sudden, as if his choices are somehow wrong and he wants to take the papers back and bolt, instead he swallows and runs his tongue across his lips nervously, folding his hands in front of his chest loosely.
“For you not the students” Benny teases her.
“Shut up” Castiel glares at him with no real heat in his voice.
“Wait that's your professor?” she says turning her eyes at him, raising her eyebrows.
“No. He, he was the one that…” he intertwines his fingers together, sitting a bit forward and sighs softly.
He rolls his shoulders, trying to rid the tension in his back and puts the bowl on the counter to dry. He goes to the bedroom and gets his clothes out from the dresser. He thinks about taking a shower but dismisses the idea, the water is going to be cold (its always is) and he will shower when he gets back.
He walks into the elevator, pressing the button to the garage. His shoulders dropping and he rests the back of his head against the elevator wall, closing his eyes. He exhales through his nose rather roughly. He pulls his already loosened tie from around his neck and holds it in his right hand tightly. Sometimes he wonders what exactly it is that he does. People still do bad things even after years of social evolution and they will continue to do so in the years to come. Still he liked to humour himself into believing that people are, in fact good or given the chance they will do good. History still refute him.
Castile presses his lips at that. There are a lot of things he can say to that, he settles on “Sometimes I keep playing our conversation in my mind and I just, I know he can’t take a good word about himself, but” he sighs
He swallows, trying to stay calm. He can feel a headache forming and knows he needs coffee first and then, then he can think about everything else.
“I know what you are thinking” he says and narrows his eyes, taking the books from Deans’ hands.
He swallows thickly and stops himself from correcting her, because there is nothing to correct, that’s what they were. Silent moments and long looks are only enough in the beginning, where the unspoken things feel precious, daring, fill up a space until one person does something. After some point though – years, a
“Anything newer?”
“He wasn’t actually your husband,” she says it as a question and Dean knows where this is going.
“She is a” he stops and looks so uncomfortable Dean almost takes pity in him, but now he really wants to know.
“Detective Castiel Novak” Now Dean does roll his eyes, and hears him clear his throat and glances at him. He is scowling down at him and there is annoyance in his eyes and worry, and Dean hunches a bit, he hates that he put it there.
“I know what happened was-”
“Hello Dean” Castiel says, taking his cup from the tray and then the other one, that he directs towards Dean. He is looking at him softly, but the edges of his expression are too hard and Dean realizes Castiel is expecting him to tell him to leave. It would be the logical thing to do. They don’t drink coffee together at coffee shops.
“Hello, Gabriel”
Castiel closes the gap between them, making Dean moan into his mouth and arch towards him.
“Amelia” Castiel says in baritone, that tumbles through the room and leaves no room for argument, even though Dean can tell she is about to retort. “This is Dean. Dean this is Amelia”
“Sorry” Dean breaks the silence after a while, cowering after the words escape his mouth.
“I can give them to you in exchange for my freedom.”
“Yes.” She says with a nostalgic sigh.
He doesn’t stop until he reaches Baby and starts the ignition and reaches his apartment, parking in his usual spot. Only then he allows himself to breath. He bangs his fists on the stirring wheel and lets a few tears fall before whipping them angrily. He gets out of the car and into the building climbing the stairs and when he is finally inside the apartment and he has taken a shower he answers one of Bobby’s calls about work.
“Hey” Dean mumbles, grabbing a change of clothes. “Found anything?” he asks going back to the bathroom to change.
“That's Anna, I’m on criminal law mainly”
Sam’s expression somewhat clears, mouth opening as if to say something and then closing. He feels dread filling he chest. He doesn’t let it reach his face.
Deans’ eyes widen and holds back a choke.
“What?” he asks glancing at her.
“What?”
Sam clears his throat loudly and Dean glances up at him as he makes his way closer to the table.
He takes a magazine from the coffee table in front of him for a lack of something else to do and flips through it mindlessly.
“I understand” Dean isn’t sure he does, then again what does he know? He nods and licks his lips. “So… we good?”
“There are three spells. That is only one.”
It’s one of those ridiculous, happy, sappy, cliché places that Cas used to love. He would probably insist going there with those silent, longing stares that thought no one saw and Dean couldn’t refuse, so he’d grumble and groan gets his coat and spend two hours in there with him pretend to hate every choice that ever led him there.
Not even Amara can. The conversation still at the forefront of his mind. He aches, a kind of ache that starts from the inside and spreads to his bones, to his muscles, to his skin, a weight on his chest that makes breathing difficult, an unrelenting pressure behind his eyes. An ache that makes his body a foreign burden.
“No” he says at last and cringes at how his voice sounds. Sam makes a sound at the other end of the line, could be a laugh Dean can’t tell, he is far too busy trying to figure out why he is acting like this. Because in fact he doesn't have anyone to ask out. Cas is just an acquaintance. Ok, a friend, but that's it. Dean can’t deal with anything else, it would complicate things.
“Yeah, yes”
“Hello, Doctor” The woman says, her smile never leaving her face. It kind of freaks Dean out, in fact everything right now freak Dean out.
He moves in front of the desk and continues “She told me you finished Steppenwolf last week and so you have submitted your essays, they will be graded, but with a small delay. As you can see, we are starting Camus. Is anyone familiar with his work?” he looks around a bit and chuckles softly, its deep and ignites something in Dean “Alright, no surprise there. He is not very attractive to younger people. We will be reading Stranger. It is a very dense and rich work, don't be fooled by Camus simple way of writing. It is a prime example of his philosophy, the absurdism, but also existentialism” he changes the slide, “I putted up four papers on those that you should read, and I also cited a few at the last slides, for those of you who want to read further, though I will encourage you all to read as much as you can for better understanding. Does anyone know about absurdism?"
He stops the thought, he whole body shuddering.
“Jerk”
Sam listens as Dean takes a shaky breath and he is suddenly reminded of Lucifer calling Dean, imitating Cas voice, how his brother run up the stairs.
After a beat or two Dean finally turns around, because in fact he doesn't know why he is staring at an auto shop, maybe because of the state Baby is in, he muses. He only makes it two steps, before he hears the man shout at him.
Dean isn’t fucking insightful.
The envelope is left on his desk and it’s the first thing he notices when he gets inside his office in the morning. His heart jumps in his chest and he tries to ignore the chill that goes up his spine, say it’s nothing serious. But Castiel isn’t a great liar or really, good at calming himself and judging by the looks Hannah and Inias gave him when he walked in, he knows it’s nothing good. Well, it could also be because he isn’t supposed to be here today, but its not like he had anything else to do. He absolutely despises the days he in on call.
"Dean."
“I can add a poem in the syllabus, if you want that” he says, seemingly unaffected, the asshole, looking back at Lisa with small smile and a soft expression, but directing it to everyone in the room. Dean scowls, as people around him give affirmations.
“Don't” and how many times has he had that argument with Sam.
“What? There is nothing wrong with prostitutes”
“You need to seal it.”
Instead, he stays silent and waits for the elevator to reach his floor. They step out and walk the small distance to his apartment. Castiels’ nose twists as he smells the lemon in the cleaning detergent his neighbour insists on using to clean the hallway, as if is not cleaned by the cleaning stuff. She is so preposterous.
Dean’s gaze falls to the book Novak is holding and reads
“Please” he breathes, because he can’t take it anymore. He is going to burst.
“Hello Dean” He says, a little too loudly for the library.
Just this and then he can go lay down.
“He used to work here” Novak provides pointedly. As if Dean hadn’t realised. There is a reason he is asking him of all people.
“Dean” Cas says his name again, this time with a breathy laugh, and can the asshole shut up for a minute. “I don't know why you thought that-”
“Morning, thanks for the coffee” Dean replies, not looking phased at all and walks to the coffee machine and puts coffee in the two mugs. He opens a cupboard and takes out a canister that says sugar and places it in front of Castiel along with the cup of coffee and turns around taking a sip from his cup and sighing contently.
“Listen, Cas, I appreciate the sentiment, but I had this argument with Sam and I get that it’s not an excuse but-”
He sits on a table this time, by the window and stirs a pack of sugar in his coffee. He starts to eat his muffin slowly (it’s really fucking good) and his eyes stray to the station. He hates himself for it and he hates his mind for thinking about blue eyes.
He gets dressed a little hastily and sits on the bed to wear his shoes, but stops mid-air, holding a shoe. He feels the need to lay down and curl in on himself. He swallows and breaths through his nose, counting to ten.
By the time he perfects it, ten days later, Sam and Jack have gathered all the ingredients and that’s how they are all sitting in the library Dean having mixed everything together, Sam holding his phone ready to call Aphrodite in case something goes amiss and Jack sitting quietly at the edge of his chair waiting.
Something doesn't seat well with him at the thought, he ignores that too.
“It’s alright, Hannah. I know him”
He even talks to her about him sometimes, hands buried in her fur. They are whispered little facts.
Dean nods, biting his lip. “Still nothing?”
“I love you”
And all Dean can do is nod. She sighs a little and leaves, closing the door behind her. And suddenly Dean is alone with the music and the magazines and condoms and he feels panicked and calm at the same time. And he is not even sure that's possible.
The seconds that follow are awkward at best and Castiel moves his weight between his feet and tries to think of something to say. Maybe he shouldn't have come down to see him, he isn’t good at interactions and what on earth was he thinking, Dean isn’t-
“Sam said you were.” Dean says over him, “Sam
He returns to the apartment a little after eight, with three bags of groceries and in a far better mood than he left. He is mentally making a list of the things he needs to do tomorrow as he walks in.
He takes a deep breath and walks to the parking lot where Baby is, trying to get a hold of himself. When he gets inside he closes his eyes, sighing and throwing his head back. He feels his heart thumbing, more steadily now, and he becomes more ware of himself. There is something curling in his stomach, desire, he knows, that makes his skin prickle and can feel all the way to his fingertips. He swallows and opens his eyes.
The morgue is on the second floor along with the other labs. It is a very quiet floor in comparison to all the others in the building, maybe apart from the last, where the Chiefs office is. When he reaches the floor, he goes straight to Billie’s office.
They are so vivid, so warm, so damn real, that when he wakes up and realizes that all they are, are figments of his imagination his heart stops for seconds, he breaks into a cold sweat, body locking up.
“Mhm”
“I know” He says and looks out the window. And Dean concludes that this guy is probably one of the weirdest people he has ever met. He turns to look at him again and Dean raises his eyebrows expectantly.
He doesn't know when they moved, but suddenly he feels himself laying on the floor, and he spreads his legs so Castiel can fit better on top of him. He feels the weight of him and he releases a moan between them, that Castiel takes in his mouth and releases it in Dean throat. They remove Dean’s flannel and then his shirt, that he places behind him because the floor is cold, and he stares up at Castiel who is looking down at him in lust, as though Dean is all he ever wanted, causing the younger man to swallow. He feels a pressure behind his eyes and he blinks; everything is heightened and Dean is burning through it all and he is not nearly satisfied enough; he wants more, so much more.
Cas’s hand moves at the back of his head, his fingers massaging his scalp and Dean gasps, leaning heavier into him.
“You feel- God, Dean” he rumbles, hands coming up to rest at Dean’s sides. He looks at him as if Dean is this big, grant thing, good enough to worship and Dean cant take it, so he starts moving, rolling his hips.
“I mean, I know you turned me down twice, but you said-” his eyes are gleaming now, and he looks so frustrated “- you said that you were stressed with the bar. I understood. But then yesterday” he pauses taking another breath and adds almost accusingly “You kissed me back, and gave no indication that you didn't want me to kiss you”
“Good night, jerk”
“Air freshener? Seriously?” she asks laughing.
“No need. Just text him you are going with me to the station and he should get the car”
Dean nods and takes his test back as well and puts the papers back in his bag, and then looks back up at Novak. They look at each other expectantly and Dean tries in vain to think of something to say. He gnaws on his lower lip self-consciously, a nervous gesture and Novak’s eyes fall in the movement for a second before raising his eyes back to Dean’s.
They don’t talk about it, even if Dean knows it’s at the tip of Sam’s tongue and the way he looks at him, but something stops him every time. There is a part of Dean that wants  Sam to boil over, the part that’s itching for a fight, someone concrete and corporeal to fight with, scream at. Let all these out and away from him. He knows it doesn’t work like that and he also knows it would be unfair, inexcusable to do to Sam. Anyone else and they would have left him to drink himself to death.
“People though” the first girl starts again “believe that having a PhD, gives you great job prospects or you are respected more”
Dean tilts his head to the side, fondness mixing with the ache in his chest. “You are my kid-”
He stops at the corner again for the fifth time and turns towards the door, he’ll just buy a coffee and sit on a table, nothing wrong with that. He walks in and doesn't look around, just goes straight to the counter. There is no one in line, thank fuck, he would probably push his way through, if there was.
It’s the middle of September and even though Castiel always found comfort in the Autumn, with the colours and the general atmosphere, now he feels like bugs are crawling under his skin. He is standing in a hotel room, not that far from the other one, where a man is lying on the bed, exactly like the first one. Like he is sleeping. This keeps being repeated in his head. It doesn't take a genius to realise, that it's the same person that killed the first guy either.
He doesn’t let on how much that unnerves him, how it makes his muscles lock up and how his whole body protests at the idea. He just listens quietly to Jack talk excitedly about it.
. Dean appreciates the sentiment he really does but-
Novak huffs again, and Dean
“Really I am fine.” Castiel insists. He tilts his head towards the ceiling and breaths. He doesn't know what to say. No, he doesn't know how to say what has been going on in his head. It’s mostly a chaos of images. His thoughts aren’t formed enough to make sense. Not that it really matters, he has learnt that even when he voices just thoughts, that don't make any sense, Crowley understands. And that's his job, he supposes.
“She lives next door with her family and I think its really sweet she decided to do something like that, with Dr MacLeod of course. Everybody should have the opportunity to go to the doctor, especially when it comes to matters of sexual health…”
He doesn't say anything for a while, he doesn't know what to say, that Dean doesn't want to, that for Dean he is just a detective that he sees sometimes and that's it? That no Dean isn’t interested in him and why would he? Dean is something so… Something Castiel fails to descried or is just too scared to put into words. In fact, Castiel is too scared to put his want into words.
Dean watches a few seconds longer, stomach in knots, face hot, before focusing on his laptop, trying to read the words on the screen in vain. He exhales through his mouth, closing his eyes and tries again. Stupid asshole, destructing him.
He is a little hungry, since he didn't have time to eat breakfast this morning, or really a granola bar, so he gets one from the package he keeps in his first drawer. Well, Hannah bought it, because he doesn't seem to be capable of eating breakfast and always ends up being hungry.
“No there isn’t.” he agrees. “But Dean is…” he sighs and shakes his head.
“Nervous?” he almost jumps when he hears the woman’s voice and he turns to look at her. She chuckles and smiles at him.
He drops on the space between the two beds and takes shaky breaths. This was a bad idea. Coming here was a bad idea.
“Castiel, I-”
next Saturday, but it would mean a lot-”
“You think it’s personal?”
“I understand” and Dean did understand, because its not about the house, and they both know it. Most of all he understands that fear of needing to leave, not that he knows where he will go, but that is not the scary part. Is this thing, that finds him sometimes unexpectedly, that tells him he doesn't belong, that he won’t be missed once he stops being useful, that eventually he will need to leave because he is simply taking too much space.
“Yeah” he says nodding, smirking at her knowingly.
He doesn’t think much about it, the future, because his head aches the more he thinks about it.
After the session Castiel decides to go to the library. Looking at books makes him feel calm and protected. It also, helps him think. He hopes he can work a bit on the case as well. They haven’t made much progress. Whoever came in with the man, had hacked the cameras. It frustrated all of them to no end.
He reaches out and touches the fabric of his sleeve. He wants to smile at the blue eyes staring down at him with such admiration, but he finds he can't do nothing but stare. Transfixed.
Castiel nods and thinks everything over. Part of the problem, he knows, is the mixed signals Dean kept sending him, there were times when Castiel was certain that he did want him, and maybe not just physically and there were others where he couldn't tell. He knows that Dean is a flirt, the kind of flirt that doesn't know he is flirting all the time he is doing it, it comes to him way to naturally. But Castiel had thought that perhaps Dean was interested in him, or maybe it was just wishful thinking. Going back to their interactions, he finds himself more and more sure of that, that some things were his imagination. Besides Dean is so interesting and bright and social, things Castiel isn’t. He just reads history and art books, his social circle consists of barely five people and his pop culture knowledge is practically non-existent. What if – and is that a scary thought – what if Dean views him like a client. Not consciously, but he felt the need to entertain him, after all Castiel sort of imposed himself in Dean’s life.  Perhaps he is overthinking it. Perhaps is his own lack of experience and grasp of social norms, he only ever had one relationship, and thinking back he can’t remember very well the beginning of it. Not that he expects Dean to be a long relationship or a relationship at all, that would be presumptuous and after all -
Her name is Jessica, she is really pretty and as Dean learns on the next ten minutes he has to wait, really friendly and chatty, and completely unphased by Deans anxiety infused, almost rude, short answers. She apologizes for the five extra minutes Dean has to wait and tells him that sometimes it happens, but he reassures her he doesn't mind. And he really doesn't, even if it raises his anxiety to the point he can’t feel anything. He gets it, people come here to resolve their problems sometimes it takes a little bit more time than fifty minutes once a week or however often they come here.
“I’m sorry Sam-” a gravelly voice interrupts him, behind Sam. The man, who is looking for something in his brown satchel and Dean can’t see his face but a mop of unruly hair and angles, moves next to Sam in the empty stool and finally sits down - “But you know how Gabriel can be”
Cas glances to the side and back at him.
“Sam, apply to fucking Harvard and leave me alone” he says, because they have been having this conversation since August and he is starting to realise that Sam just needs someone to cheer him on, and not because he is entirely doubting himself.
She is short with blonde hair and she is saying something about a school project when she stops at the sight of him. She freezes but just as quickly she shakes out of it and stares him up and down and he knows he looks like an idiot. A deer caught in headlights. Then she is turning her head to Castiel who is walking around her. She opens her mouth ready to say something and Dean’s heart is ready to jump out of his chest.
Castiels’ heart jumps and he all of a sudden feels something pressing on his chest, because Dean, he is-
“Fuck you” Dean pants and Castiel just shoots him an unimpressed look, removing his hand. He reaches, somewhere on Dean’s left side and takes something in his hand, and then he hears the familiar tear of a condom wrap and he thinks,
“You don't have to be alone. Being alone doesn't protect you from anything” he looks at Crowley for several seconds, maybe a whole minute.
Cas’ – and now theirs for the last eight months – townhouse is close to the National Mall, but not as close to their jobs as was Deans’ apartment. However, it is nicer, bigger and again closer to the park that they both (or three) liked to spent time in.
“I wanted him there” he utters, sounding almost dazed, the guilt that he tried so much to suppress, finds a path and it starts to slowly choke him. “I didn't care for once that Mick was gone and-” he stops and takes a breath “I just wanted him there. Dean.”
“Dude, she works at St. Regis”
Dean grins down at him.
“What do you know?”
“And?” Teenagers, it’s like pulling teeth getting them to say two words to you.
“You look like a hipster or worse a hipster advert,” Benny teases, helping him.
When he gets home from work, Sam is already there on the living room floor, with his laptop in the coffee table and a notebook full of notes next to it. His hair is messy and he is staring at the laptop screen, scrutinizing whatever it is there.
Eventually he turns the water on and gets underneath the spray.
“And I didn’t tell him.” Her voice breaks and she leans her head on his shoulder. She makes no movement to wipe her tears. “Dean” the way she says his name, lost, sad and small, he is reminded of how young she is.
“Shut up, Cas” Dean says cheeks heating, refusing to look at him.
And Dean has nothing but time.
, but justifiably so.
goes unsaid, but they both hear it. He chuckles humorlessly.
Dean considers him. “Ok, one, most dads compared to mine look like good dads and two, still not an excuse. I did what I did and it was wrong, it was- it was cruel and I’m sorry.”
He stills, looking at the crème ceiling of the motel room. Hears the sound the old refrigerator makes on the other side of the room and a sound like a sob wrenches out of him. Tears through his chest and throat and he is flayed open, suspended in midair. In an absurd panic with a jerky movement his hands fly on the sides to touch the matters, make sure it’s underneath him and he is still laying on top of it.
“Yes”
He didn't see the redhead today, and even though he feels a little intimidated around her, he kind of missed her usual salute, with the “not loud noises in here” she always says, to everyone passing through the door.
If he did he wouldn’t have said all those things to Dean.
Dean tilts his head and kisses him at the corner of his mouth, and down in his throat, at that spot behind his ear he discovered last time. His hand travels down his chest over his belly, until he reaches Castiel’s growing erection and he starts to move his hand, through the clothing, slowly, almost leisurely. The other man pants, dropping his head and lets out a low grunt, when Dean squeezes through his pants. He can feel the hot flesh, throbbing in his hand and stops himself through the high.
“Hey, don't be like that, you won’t be alone” Dean really wants to crack his skull open.
Now it is Deans’ turn to sigh, “Just worry about choosing five that you like” he emphases the last bit, “And I’ll worry about the rest, ok?”
“You are-” he starts and stops sighing, “I don’t think you understand what you are to me. You’ve taught me so many things.”
“You want to get in the car?” he asks him abruptly, and when Sam turns around, he nods at the black SUV.
Gabriel hands the paper bag to Cas. “It’s on the house, since it’s you and lover boy”
“There was nothing to bury.” Dean interrupts her and watches as her eyes widen and his fill with tears he blinks away, he grips the counter and goes on. “I didn’t know he” he swallows the word, “too.”
“Hey”
Because Cas deserved good things.
and knows what he wants and needs. That thought leaves him feeling deserted. He does have people around him, but there are times where he feels that they don't completely understand him. And there is Crowley, but he isn’t enough, he is just his therapist. For a second his mind drifts to green eyes and plush lips and he sits up.
“Yes, you don't need to deride it” he admonishes.
angry with this man, with the world, with himself.
“Hey” she says moving forward reaching with her hands for a hug and he takes a step back knocking into the counter before he can think about it. He looks up at the ceiling away from her, apology on the tip of his tongue, but she beats him to it.
He sees Charlie outside his door and raises his eyebrows and she smiles widely at him.
“Dude, if Chicago uni was willing to take
“Mark,” Dean starts, “he ugh, found that phone number in a victim of a djinn attack in- somewhere in Idaho I don’t know, said the voice sounded familiar.”
“What?”
“You are.” Dean huffs, plopping himself down. “And you are going to believe me one day, even if I have to tell you for the rest of forever.” Dean grumbles, scrunches his nose and turns so he is not touching Cas at all.
“Good afternoon, I am sorry for being late, I had another class upstairs that took longer than I expected” the murmur stops and everyone’s attention is on him “I’m Castiel Novak and I will be teaching this course in place of Anna, you were supposed to get the email regarding this change, as well as the lecture hall change, but we had a problem in the literature department, that well doesn't interest you. I- yes” he stops and looks at a point in the rows behind Dean.
He grips the other man’s arm and it’s the only way he can hold himself together and remember to breath, as he continues to feel Castiel pound into him. When his thumb grazes over his right nipple, he squeezes down in pleasure and Castiel does it again and again and Dean just moans, loudly this time, feeling a little self-conscious about it, but forgetting it once Castiel moves, taking him in his hand. He runs a finger across the slit, and Dean realizes he isn’t going to last long and knows it’s the same for the other man too.
“He did everything he cou-”
He presses his lips in a tight line and rips it open, feeling a weird satisfaction at the sound it makes.
“You know, Tom” Dean rolls his eyes at that, but it is more in amusement.
“Castiel” he says in the space between them, before he comes all over the man’s hand.
Novak takes a breath, taking a step back, away from him, and runs a hand through his hair, “I-” he stops, tongue darting out to wet his upper lip and when he looks back up at Dean, his eyes are desperate, “I don't do this” and then he looks back to the side.
“You can leave if you want to” he says voice deep, and soberingly cold.
“I killed Mary.”
“It wasn't so bad” he says opening his eyes and he knows it’s a lie, but he needs to reassure, who of the two of them he doesn't know. “Everything. It wasn't so bad”
“There is no need, Hannah”
“Cas?” Sam utters.
“Mhm” Then her expression turns serious “I know you loved Mick, and I know a part of you still does, but maybe you should give this a shot, it can be a great thing.” He sighs “No, listen I am not just saying this because, it’s someone that’s interesting or is interested in
Dean takes a breath to calm his raising nerves, “You are going to get the scholarships and we will work something out”
He considers her for a moment and then shakes his head, downing the rest of his whiskey.
Dean rolls his eyes and crosses his hands “Two beers?” he repeats and smiles slightly at Sam in irony, and it’s better to look at just Sam, he has decided or really at anyone other than Castiel.
“Well, thank you. But I’m not doing anything arrestable” he says trying to ease his nerves.
“Have a nice evening” Novak says and begins to walk towards the exit, and Dean just nods, a little confused.
Gabriel is staring at them amused and sizing Dean up and he tries to ignore it. He chuckles at them and then gives Cas a look, that Dean again can’t read and moves to retrieve a chocolate muffin. And though understandable, he feels a little left out with their silent conversations, but he doesn't let it get to him much.
Things are steady for a while or rather Dean falls on a routine. He goes to work and university – good thing is he only has lectures on Tuesdays, Wednesday and Fridays - he studies and goes to his Friday sessions with Billie.
“Hey” he greets and her eyes snap up narrowing at him.
He doesn't let his thoughts get any further again and starts descending the stairs, Carmen in front of him. He looks at her moving down and then towards the kitchen, he is basically following her, but he finds it soothing watching her. She is white, save from a spot on her side that is ginger and the ginger-brown tail that its high in the air, the tip moving idly as she walks. When she reaches the entrance of the kitchen she stops and stretches before continuing her walk behind the middle island, where Dean can’t see her from where he is standing at the door.
He turns and sees Hannah studying him, but he ignores her, as for the other guy, whatever his name is, he has moved further into the room and is taking a seat in one of the chairs, completely oblivious. When he is at the door Novak calls out at him, making him freeze. He turns around slowly almost steeling himself.
“Ok” she drags the word out slightly and eyes him carefully. She looks like she wants to ask him something, but Dean really can’t talk to anyone longer than a few seconds without feeling like he is going to throw up.
He glances back at Castiel who appears like he is about to ask him if he should leave, so Dean asks the first thing that comes to his mind.
“Can I help ya?” he asks frowning.
Dinner is good recipe wise. They all make an effort to keep the conversation floating, it seems to be an unspoken agreement not to let the silence stretch for too long. They all say something, even Dean, Claire is the one that doesn’t utter a single word. She throws him these looks a couple of times though, full of anger and grief, that have Jody clear her throat pointedly and Donna babble more.
Dean doesn’t know if it’s
“Don't interrupt me”
After a few minutes he asks, turning to look at Cas because he hates himself “Where are we going?”
“I’ll see you tomorrow” he tells her, followed by a small smile, that he isn’t certain if it’s directed at her or at himself.  There are times where he feels like he is smiling just to feel a little stronger.
“It’s just… You seem different, like something has change, I just can’t tell what”
He gets out of bed slowly, he doesn't want to wake Dean and tries to find his clothes with the little light that comes in through the blinds. He finally finds his boxers and wrinkles his nose. There is no way he’s going to wear them.
He feels his muscles slowly relax, until he senses eyes on him and he seats up ungracefully and looks around, he can’t figure out who it is, everyone in front of him is either staring at a book or talking to their friends. Maybe it was just him being paranoid, he doesn't like the feeling though. Then he turns his head towards the left, and sees Novak seating at a table with a brown-haired woman he doesn't recognise, and his heartbeat picks up a notch, to his dismay. This is getting ridiculous. He is ridiculous.
Only once Dean’s breathing is back to normal does Castiel move. He gets up and Dean immediately misses him, but he doesn’t make a sound or moves, he find that can’t anyways, his limbs feeling heavy and mushy. He stares at him as he goes to the adjoining bathroom, hears the water run and a minute later he appears back to Dean’s side with a wet cloth. He gets him clean and kisses his forehead, making him flush.
“I’m sorry”
“It’s about a Scottish who’s told he’ll become the king of Scotland, so he kills the king with his wife’s encouragement, becomes king and then goes mad from paranoia and guilt, killing even more people” Dean tells him in a rush and is suddenly glad for helping Sam with it last year for his project in  English. Which really all Dean did was listen to Sam complain and present the power point to him approximately a hundred times.
“Why so?” she frowns.
He doesn't realise he has been staring, so when blue eyes, that are a lot closer than before, meet his, he freezes and inhales sharply. He sees Castiel’s steps falter, but he soon composes himself, as oppose to Dean, who is standing frozen in place. They soon reach him and pass him, all but him who just stops there and looks at Dean, like he is trying to figure him out, which is not that different from the other two times he’s seen him.
“Well” Novak starts eventually “I just wanted to asks if you know this man” he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a photograph, placing it in front of Dean.
, which are both unacceptable.
She raises her eyebrows, “Well, you are full of surprises, Winchester. I would swear you’d go for mythology.”
He exhales sharply and looks away from her.
He finds Charlie leaning against the side of the car, typing in her phone.
“If the way you apply yourself to your studies, is anything to go by, then yes I know” Castiel tells him assertively.
“Is it a documentary?” He asks slowly, like he knows he is wrong.
“Good”
He doesn't know how long they are standing in the kitchen in silence and even though he is hyperaware of every little thing both of them do, he doesn't know who moves first. Maybe it’s him, but it doesn't matter cause Cas tastes like pizza and a far away dream and Dean is drunk. Too drunk to think. There are hands on him, his waist and the side of his face. And
Dean folds it in half and puts in the back pocket of his jeans. The clinic is near the library, two streets over. Maybe he will go tomorrow. He is a little wary though. Its not the first free clinic and the one he visited before, wasn't so open to people like him. In sort they refused to waste their money and effort on him and kicked him out. He doesn’t feel bad about what he does, it’s what keeps him fed. And sometimes he wishes people would see it that way as well. He sighs and walks at the direction of his apartment, there is a soft breeze in the air, September is almost a week away and he kind of breads it. He thinks about the colder days and how there is nothing but four walls protecting him from it and a pathetic excuse of a heater, that last year worked for only three weeks. He’ll make do.
Since when does Novak know his name and why the hell is he saying it like
Dean averts his gaze “I’m sorry”, and he is not just apologizing for the look he was giving him.
She sighs again heavily.
It feels good. And by the time they are laying side by side on the bed, with a mattress that’s much to soft for Dean’s liking, he feels satisfied and with a certain clarity in his head that last for all of ten minutes, because Dean closes his eyes and sees deep blue, and hears a deep rumble talking about Camus, making his heart start racing again. He sighs softly and suddenly feels heavier than before. Andy tells him he can stay till morning but Dean refuses. He needs to leave and the other seems to understand. He gets dressed and at Andy’s concerned look, Dean tells him he is fine and not to worry about it.
“Yeah” he breaths against Dean’s mouth.
“That's not what’s really bothering you with Sam” Dean bristles at that, his balls his hands in fists. Something ugly and terrible is crawling up his throat and all Dean can do is breath through his nose, trying to shove it down.
“I’d ask how you are, but I already know” he says with a tone that Dean can’t identify and places a tray of what appears to be blueberry muffins on the counter.
“You’re welcome, detective”
In the mornings he looks the worst. Sam asks him if he has nightmares, if he needs to talk about it. Tells him something about sharing that Dean’s mind doesn’t hold.
They gather as much information as they can about each couple. They make notes and maps, trying to find something that might predict the next one, but it is as if she rolls a dice.
“I’m sorry” he repeats while Dean bends down to put his shoes on and Dean huffs a laugh, that is ringing in his ears and he doesn’t want to think what it sounds like to Castiel.
Cas stops and stares at his eyes for a moment, before taking his hand, and Dean would have protest if he could think more clearly, and they climb the stairs.
, he is pathetic. Teenagers act better when they have-
He is pretty sure that no one else has felt that way about him, like Cas feels about him, but he doesn’t poke that thought much, because then his self-doubt and self-deprecating will start and he is aware enough to know that Cas’s feelings and Cas himself deserve better than that.
“You mean it’s been a while since you did something other than study and work and Sam” Dean glares at her, she is not wrong but still. She waves him off adding, “I know they are important but I hardly see you these days. Benny said you didn't want to go out last Friday or any other Friday”
“Oh, which part?” Castiel asks with excitement in his eyes, he loves that book. Albeit, it’s a bit difficult to read.
“Is it because of the story of the man that murdered a prostitute?” He asks trying to lighten the mood.
He is sitting at his usual table in the library staring at an open book. He believes it's The Stranger, but he isn’t sure, he picked it up in a daze and sat down. He has been trying to read it for the last twenty minutes, but the words are swimming and he can’t concentrate.
” And Castiel feels a lot more confused now. When Dean looks at him it’s like he thinks Castiel doesn't understand anything, and it makes him feel small. Then he sighs and says with irritation.
He rounds the corner and freezes at the threshold, staring at wide blue eyes.
“In my understanding, it was similar to your situation”
“Hey” he shouts back, still focused on the screen.
The man opens his mouth like he is about to start apologising again but Cas interrupts him, with a tone that it’s both soft and commanding and it makes Dean feel warm and blush harder. “Really everything is fine. You should call someone to take you home, and just relax. Ok?”
“Esme-”
Dean moves and lays next to him listening as his breathing evens out and feels nothing, he never does.
He gets on his feet and under the shower letting the water run through him. The little hope he had that it would elevate some of the tension, make him feel better goes down the drain and he has to hold himself against the wall so he doesn’t fall back down on his knees.
He shuffles in his feet inside the elevator and waits to reach the floor he wants, smiling politely at the people getting in. Seriously how high does the firm need to be. When he finally gets off, and what a relief that is; he can’t with tight spaces. Especially those filled with people. He walks to the reception and smiles at Becky who gives him a wide smile, while speaking on the phone.
And Dean takes his hand in his and grips it, his eyes watering and says, “I love you too.”
she doesn't say but Castiel can hear it.
“We know.” Sam tells him. “How are you?” he sounds sincere when he asks too and Dean barely holds himself from swearing.
It takes a tremendous will to make him move his hand, the effort makes his jaw clench an the muscles on his neck lock painfully. When his hand moves to cover the skin there, a sound escapes his lips that bounces off the walls, ugly and broken. It make him hunch in on himself. His legs tremble and he pulls his hand away. His stomach churning with nothing and little breaths that are more like gasps punch out of him.
He hears Anna sigh next to him and he turns to look at her.
“What do you want Sam?”
His eyes fly open and he wheezes out a breath. He consciously tries not to think about the dream, even if all he sees, regardless if his eyes are open or close, is a deep blue.
He pulls back the shower curtain and gets in, opens the shower the hottest it will go and lets it burn his skin. It’s good, his legs tingle as he regains some feelings of them.
He feels a cloth wiping his stomach and he realises he has been drifting out. He feels Cas cleaning him, so delicately, tenderly even, it makes his eyes water and he has to blink back tears. It’s almost too much, being touched like this. He dares a glance up at Cas, who gives him a small hesitant, almost shy smile and Dean cannot help but smile at him open and dazed. And he can see him relax. When he is done, he goes to the bathroom to throw the towel and he returns switching the bathroom light off and it’s dim again, with just the yellow light from beside Deans’ head.
“Why are you telling me this?”
, he knows it means now.
Dean rolls his eyes, and chews slightly on his lip. He seems like he wants to say something, but then stops himself.
"All those years" Dean says and pokes him on the shoulder, staring at his naked ass, pressing his lips as not to smile.
Well, not entirely true because the thought of Cas calms him and makes him feel good, like he matters and sometimes when he thinks about the way Cas looks at him he feels like he is adequate, though he doesn't know at what. Which is absurd, because one Dean isn’t anything worthwhile and two Cas is far too good and virtuous to be looking at Dean like this or think that he is anything other than, than
“No, I mean, it’s nothing, just homework and school”
He grins at her “You love me”
Dean just nods and bites his lower lip. All he can think about is how he should probably leave. He knows he should have himself checked, but it would save everyone the trouble from having to kick him out, if he just left.
“It’s weird?”
“Will you change expressions or say something?”
He hears an obnoxious laugh on his right and turns to see where it comes from, or more specifically who it comes from. He spots a short, brown-haired guy that talks quite loudly to a red-haired woman, who seems amused by whatever his babbling about. He is accompanied by another red-haired woman and another guy that is tall, maybe a bit taller than Dean, who has a playful smile on his face and is holding her hand. Dean’s eyes widen momentarily when he sees on the guys other side and a little behind from the group, Castiel, who looks displeased and down right murderous. He thinks that if looks could kill, short guy would be lying dead in about a hundred different ways. A smile forms in his mouth and he tries to fight it in vain. They are walking towards Dean, presumably to the bar, judging by their attire, well everyone’s apart from Castiel’s, who is wearing what he wore all the other times Dean has seen him.
“What is it?” Hannah asks voice laced with concern. He motions for Inias to go and he just nods walking away. Castiel watches him for a moment, before his eyes turn to Hannah.
He pushes the other man until he is on his back, and Castiel lets him willing and compliant, and then reaches to pull down his boxers, followed by his own because it’s getting uncomfortable. He watches as Castiel shudders and then Dean moves down, until he is exactly where he needs to be.
Cas makes a sound and then, then they are kissing. Cas cold hands coming to cup Deans’ face but he shudders for a completely different reason. Cas kisses him with certainty, his lips slightly chapped and it feels so good, so grounding and causes goosebumps to raise in Deans’ body and he wants more. Until Cas moans softly and then he remembers what he is doing, what they are doing and pulls back.
and were really impressed with his
Dean blinks dumpily because
On Saturday, he takes the day off. Tells Ellen he doesn't feel very well and she gives it to him far too easily; he must sound worse than he thought.
He moves to the abjoint bathroom and when he is past the threshold, he gets back out. He goes all the way to the living room, looks towards the door, nods to himself and then goes back to take a shower.
Dean rolls his eyes, but doesn't fight his smile “I thought you were a healthy eater and I was suppose to eat healthily too”
“This is long overdue” Dean tells him, watches as understanding comes to Cas after seconds. Because of course Cas knows. In hindsight, Dean knows that there are a lot of tells. And he
Dean makes a sound at the back of his neck and says “Is that why Donna arrested me?”
Then like a switch has flipped and with a voice boarding hysteric he shouts, “take it away from me,” but he doesn’t relax his hold.
“Five years ago, when it started and all we had was an overdose college student and another with fifty grams of cocaine under her bed” he counters, though it is tempting, he finds he has a lot on his mind lately.
He drives them back to the law firm, Castiel clutching the box in his hands along with the trench coat, his satchel in his shoulder about to fall off, and he looks at Dean intensely, with a heat behind his eyes, that could be Deans’ imagination and he says something along the lines of see you around or something equally nonsensical.
“No, I heard. I mean why did you…?”
He feels a hand in his hair and it feels good until he remembers and then he bolts up right.
“It’ll make it easier?” she asks sarcastically, almost sickened at the notion.
“You are not.” She says confidently, with a small sigh as if that turn of the  conversation tires her and motions to the bartender for another Martini. “I have spoken with the Moires.” At his lost look, she adds with a patronizing smile. “The Fates.”
“I’m a pretty face” he says as if it answers his question and shrugs. Anger flares up in Castiel, though it’s not directed at Dean and he breaths through his nose trying to stay calm.
“On the house” he winks at him and Castiel huffs a laugh, taking his coffee and the plate.
“So, how many themes do you think they are in the book?” Novak asks and looks through them, his eyes land on Dean who tries to keep his face neutral, even if his heart is thumbing.
It’s too much having him here, being aware that Cas is somewhere in the Bunker at the same time as Dean. It scares him and he waits for the moment to wake up and go in the kitchen and it’s just Sam and Jack there, acting around him as they did before, which means Cas hasn’t come back and it was all just a dream again.
After a beat she says “Alright”
and Dean thinks his heart will burst or his chest or-
He can barely make it out now, years of healing having faded it into an off red impression of a hand. He doesn’t know if it’s a good thing or not, doesn’t know if seeing it there the way it was when he first saw it would be better or worse. The more he looks at it the more clear it becomes and he suddenly remembers the jacket with the blooded handprint hanging at the back of his door and the decision is made for him.
“Don't be a baby”
“I mean it, Dean” he says seriously and fuck, he needs to stop saying his name like that. Dean takes a deep breath. There is definitely something wrong with him.
, it swallows him whole and he swims in it and nothing satisfies it but the thing he doesn’t reach for.
They eventually do get a case in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania; a werewolf by the sounds of it. Sam lets him know Tuesday noon and in couple of hours they are in Baby.
When he opens them again, he finds Castiel looking at him, half fond half sad, and full of longing and Dean can’t keep looking into his eyes so he focuses on a spot over his shoulder, and let out a shuddering a breath. He shifts in his arms and rests his forehead on Castiel’s shoulder.
The man nods, thanks him and apologises to Dean again and telling him to call if anything goes wrong, before leaving.
It takes him a minute to get a hold of himself and then he reaches for his trench coat. He puts it on hastily and opens the door, barely registering as it bangs against the wall.
“Do you want to talk about it? What’s bothering you?” He asks after a few seconds and Dean looks at him, with irritation in his eyes. At least the frown is gone.
“You went to Harvard?” Dean asks Castiel, ignoring Sam.
Cas moves his hips in circles making Dean throw his head back in pleasure. He feels him unbuttoning his jeans and opens his eyes.
“Aphrodite?” Dean picks up a coffee cup, taking a sip. It is exactly how he takes it when he lets himself have it. Two sugars, two tea spoons of milk. He relaxes his shoulders as the hot liquid runs down his throat and doesn’t acknowledge how Sam knows about it even it is something he hasn’t done around him. Well not to Sam’s knowledge but apparently he was wrong.
“Good morning Dean” he tells him, steady, in a rumble. It makes Dean’s toes curl, he closes his eyes for a moment, trying to orient himself.
A beep sounds and he startles, heart skipping a beat. He rolls his eyes at himself, he should be expecting it judging from what day it is, he searches for his phone blindly for a few seconds and takes it into his hands and unlocks it.
George Bennett, their second victim, had his heart ripped out as well. Dean thinks it’s definitely a werewolf despite Sam’s insistence that the full moon is weeks away.
He sees as her eyes widen and her lips part slightly. She blinks at him after a few seconds and closes her mouth, swallowing.
Cas goes to get up, but Dean grabs his arm and shake his head. “No, Cas no I-” he exhales “I can’t eat right now”
Dean just nods and watches him get up and leave with his coffee.
He was attractive, his features had a delicate twist in them, while having a sharpness in them, maybe from time. Castiel guesses he is being poetic because of his sleepless state. Suddenly one of the eyes closes and Castiel realizes that the man winked at him and that he had been staring at him for some time. He mentally shakes himself and turns to Jody who is looking at him expectantly, with raised eyebrows.
