Castiel pressed his lips against Dean's in a chaste kiss. When he pulled back he smiled. "I would rather have happiness with you, manipulated or not, then live in a world where I don't get to love you. You are my happily ever after Dean, whether Chuck wanted it or not. If you don't feel the same, I understand, but I'm not going to deny my feelings any longer. You are why I am still on earth, why I fight against God. Because I love you. Because you are a good man."
“Cas,” Dean groaned. God, he wanted nothing more than for his angel to continue his path, but not like this. “I think I’m healed.”
“No buts, Cas. I love you, have for a long time. I’ve just been too stupid to admit it, to you and myself.” He thrust his hips up, enjoying the friction when he felt Castiel’s hardness pressing against his own. “The first thing we’ll do is tell Sammy. But first…” He drew Castiel’s head back down to his, kissing him hard. “Let’s enjoy the solitude, just for a little bit.”
"What if it is?" Castiel stood and drew Dean up, cupping his face with his hands. Stepping until his body was flush with Dean's, he added, "So what if it's everything that God wanted? I don't care. I love you, Dean. I would walk through fire to be with you. I would go back to hell if you asked me to. I would do anything for you, even defy my father, my creator. Give us a chance, Dean."
As he closed the cuts, bit by bit, he shucked off his coat and unbuttoned his shirt, then loosened the tie pulling it over his head. Tossing his clothes to the floor, he scooted back, moving his lips down Dean’s stomach and to the flesh right above his belt.
When Castiel’s words trailed off, Dean took a chance. “Because we care about each other, too damn much.” He stumbled over his words, “Cas… I… uh…” Swiping a hand over his face, he sighed. “Fucking hell, Cas. I don’t know how to say it.”
Cas didn’t sleep, as a rule, but he closed his eyes and kept them closed, trying not to let this break him, not now, not after everything.
“Oh, Jack. What’s wrong?” Mary asked, rushing faster to him, and John knew they were going to have an interesting dinner this evening because he needed to know everything about Jack and why he, the replacement God, was coming to their house to get what appeared to be comfort from John’s wife.
“That would seem to make sense.” Castiel rubbed his eyes and sighed. This wasn’t what he’d wanted for his day. His week.
"Yeah.  Let's get the hell out of here."  Dean leads the way back to the car, helps put the supplies away and, despite being dirty as hell, gets in the car.  He looks back at Cas as he turns the ignition.  "Thanks for helping out back there.  Oh, wait-"
He just didn’t know what to do about it. The idea of confessing his feelings kept rolling through his mind, but he had a kneejerk reaction of
Later, much later, after Jack had replaced the office furniture with comfortable couches and chairs, like there’d been in the bunker (especially after Dean had decided that comfort was the name of the game) and he’d given Castiel a warm cup of tea that smelled like cinnamon and cardamom, Jack sat down, having decided that they needed to talk about it.
Castiel’s knee presses into the back of the seat, Dean forgetting that it was even there. He’s used to the hard press of bone and cartilage, that is, until Cas shifts and his knee slides south, away from Dean’s lower back.  Dean shoots a look up to the rear view mirror, checking on the guy, but Cas's face is still the same-- open and trusting.
“Oh, sure!” Jack said, pushing his glass forward. John was starting to like the kid, which was good because he was apparently the only grandkid John was going to get to know anytime soon.
Taking on Chuck’s power meant taking on his knowledge, as well, and Jack was simply astounded at how much he just hadn’t known. There was certainly an element of his previous existence that understood that, as a creature that was really only three years old, give or take, even if his body appeared to much older, he couldn’t possibly have as much knowledge as everyone seemed to expect from someone or something that looked like him.
Something in him feels like he should wait, if only for a minute, to give her a chance to make her peace with everything.
“He will be once I’m done with him,” Dean muttered to himself as opened the door to the tiny coat closet, pulling out everything inside, looking for an umbrella or a poncho or something he could use to not get as soaked as he had in the bath, just trying to get to his car. In the very back, he found a child’s sized umbrella with yellow ducks and green frogs painted on the clear plastic that made up the umbrella’s canopy. “Hah! Yes!”
“Well, I don’t think he actually knows what he needs us to do. Which makes me think he got advice from someone else and he’s following someone else’s plan. But no matter what, he’s definitely the guard with the keys and the one we have to satisfy before he’ll break us out of this ice cube, which- it was just August, you jerk!” He raised his voice and shook the hand holding the deck of cards at the ceiling. “Also,” Dean said, drawing out the word, like he wasn’t sure how to get to the next part of his sentence, “he mentioned that he knew what you’d said. Back at the bunker. And what I thought about it. What you said.”
There was so much snow, it filled the entire doorway. Dean opened the umbrella and tried pushing back on the white wall of doom, but it didn’t move. Rather, the harder he pushed, the more snow fell into the room.
"I believe that we will fight as long as we can, as hard as we can, until it is over.  Whatever that means."  Cas smells like road food and dial soap, the kind you find wrapped in paper in the cheap motels, and toothpaste.  He's close enough that Dan could kiss him.  If he wanted to.  Which he doesn't.  He doesn't think.  "You should go and help her."
“I know what you told Dean,” Jack tried again, leaning forward in a way he knew implied he was open and willing to listen. “Now that you’re here, what are you going to do about it?”
John wasn’t sure what, exactly, he was supposed to make of that, just yet. He decided that he wasn’t doing a very good job at keeping up the ruse of reading and dropped his book to the ground. He swung his feet over the edge, trying to get out of the hammock and to his feet without looking like an idiot. Which was particularly difficult when trying to exit a hammock, just in general, but even worse when trying to do so at a fast pace.
They cross the road and just as they pass through the tiny gate to enter the graveyard, the woman in white appears in front of them.  Dean jumps and he can hear Sam laughing softly behind him.
Karen. When Jack opened it up, took down the walls, I was able to find her. She’s at book club or she’d be right here with me, drinking her own beer.”
Mary Winchester always seemed to be doing something outside. She had a beautiful garden in the backyard and a lovely front display of roses and various other plants. She had window boxes with flowers and herbs, a finely maintained series of bushes and flowering baskets around and on the front porch, and she liked chopping her own wood.
“Yes,” Cas says, sharing a look with Dean that felt like old times. Old, old times. “He’s tried to get me to do a number of things to resolve my, well, it doesn’t matter. He’d tried and I haven’t exactly been receptive. I imagine this is his version of an intervention.”
“Please, Bobby, tell me what you really think.” Dean rolled his eyes and sets his empty bottle next to his chair. “I’m gonna go for a drive,” he told Bobby, pulling Baby’s keys out of his pocket and jangling them softly against his leg. “But… I think about what you said.” Admitting to even thinking about it was about the best he was capable of at the moment, a feeling of overwhelm about everything suddenly settling over his shoulders.
. But the paradise we’re building, these are the the, the, the decorations we’re slapping on it to make it ours. The stickers on our Trapper-Keeper.”
“Ah,” John said. “That Cas. Got it.” They sat there, a slightly uncomfortable silence between them. “Dean’s in love with him, then? You’re sure?”
“Well, come on in, have a seat at the table. We’ll talk it through and see what we can do. John, would you grab the lemonade and some glasses from the kitchen?”
“Good point.” Dean sipped his beer, thinking about the Vonnegut he’d never been able to get a hold of or the Heinlein that he’d started but had to return before he was done, when they’d had to leave town early for a new case or to avoid the law. The Lovecraft he’d found problematic but fascinating, the Robert E. Howard that was some of the funniest shit he’d ever read in his life that had nothing to do with Conan the Barbarian, even though that’s why he’d picked up the collection in the first place, and the summer he’d had to take summer school English and had compared Burroughs’ John Carter books to Bradbury’s
“Always,” Cas replied and stood up, pulling Dean with him, leading the way back to their warm, cozy bed.
And…. There. He found it, the entity known as the Empty. With a snap of his fingers (it was very Chuck of him, but he decided he’d think of it more like that comic book movie Dean had made him watch, with the giant purple man, instead and he’d feel less terrible about it), he’d put the Empty back to sleep (which was the only thing the creature seemed to want on any level, beyond punishing Castiel for waking it up) and pulled Castiel up to Heaven with him, with a second snap of his fingers.
“We do have a lot of time to make up for,” Cas said, running his hands up Dean’s sides, the ring warm on his left hand.
The first tendrils of caring, concern, friendship. The way those feelings morphed and changed as trust was built and broken between them, over and over again, and how all of that eventually molted and shifted and became love.
How much he loved Dean but didn’t expect Dean to love him back. In fact, was sure that Dean didn’t. And that was okay, because as long as Dean was okay, Cas would know he was out there and could be happy.
“Yes,” Cas said, raising his own hand to press against Dean’s. “I know now.” He leans forward and kisses Dean on the lips, soft and gentle, the way Dean’s first kiss always should have been. A small sound, not quite a moan, slips out between them and Dean pulls back, breathing a bit heavier than before.
The nice thing about Heaven was, he was learning, there wasn’t any traffic. No slow drivers, no accidents or construction, no stop lights or even speed limits. Just the open road and the fall leaves changing colors like on the East Coast or the Mid-West, but, like, all the time.
John Winchester just rolled his eyes and tried not to take any of it too seriously, less he get a fist to the face. He liked the smell of a fire in the wood stove with the wood she liked to chop and he loved the glow Mary got in her cheeks when she spent the day working in the yard. It was a true pleasure to spend time with her, any time, any amount, especially in a space where they wouldn’t ever have to worry about bad things happening to the other person.
“More books in the world than any one person could ever read in a million lifetimes. If you can’t work on that ‘to be read’ list in Heaven, then you ain’t in Heaven.”
“I don’t really,” Cas started, trying to talk around his mouthful of toast and eggs with a touch of ketchup, something he’d found he loved the last time he’d been human and hadn’t been able to give up the habit.
It had been a lovely day (as though there were anything but lovely days in Heaven, even when it was raining) and John was looking forward to an even more lovely evening. Mary was puttering around, messing with her tomatoes and John was trying to read a mystery novel he’d always had his eye on but had never allowed himself the time, except now he kept falling asleep in the sun, book on his face, instead of actually reading the damn thing.
It felt late and he was suddenly tired, so he pulled over and entered the cabin. The lights worked and there was a fully stocked kitchen, including cold beer and a stack of pre-made sandwiches, as well as a still warm pie. Heaven was amazing.
“Hi, Dean.” It was Jack. Not a surprise but it meant that he had been listening. Great. “How are things going?”
Dean wants to argue the point.  They're still fighting, he wants to say, and if they can manage it, Lucifer will stay trapped in his cage, at least for a little while longer.  But the further they get down the road, the less likely it seems that they can stop it.  The woman in white is still standing there, arm reaching for help from him, reaching out for someone to rescue her.
Castiel rolled over, still on top of the covers, still in the blackness of the power outage but he needed to be facing Dean, even if it was only just knowing that was what he was doing.
"What's happening?"  Sam sounds like he did when he was five, tired and cranky.  Dean is not in the mood, not with the fatalistic angel in the back seat and the woman in white blocking the road.
back there.  Totally serious."  Dean puts the car in drive and eases slowly forward, trying not to run through the woman in white, even knowing that she's dead and can't possibly feel it.  He takes the left turn slowly and stops in front of the little graveyard, pulling the Impala halfway off the road.
After the fight with his dad, he’d left in the Impala and just drove, his heart asking for a place where he could just be himself, in peace and quiet.
Cas choked on the sip of coffee he’d been trying to swallow. Once he’d gotten himself under control, he reached out to take the ring from Dean. “I literally thought you’d never ask,” he told Dean as he slipped the ring onto his own ring finger.
“Jack!” Mary called out to him, her voice making the young man smile, an odd look crossing his face as he saw her.
Dean climbed into bed, under the covers, next to Cas but not touching. It was quiet, not even the sound of electricity in the wires or water through the pipes cut through the night. They should be able to hear the fire, but this was far from a natural circumstance, so Cas didn’t worry that the crackling of wood burning hadn’t made it down the hall to their room.
“I’ll start a fire,” Cas said, not getting into any of the more important issues plaguing them at the moment.
Jack’s first thought was to pull together a rescue party with the other Winchesters (he was still a Winchester, no matter what anyone, including Chuck, tried to tell him).
There were a few things he’d wanted to ask since his first visit, especially about the portrait of Adam sitting next to his and Sam’s on the mantel, and the photos of Adam and his mother scattered throughout the house.
“Bobby called,” Dad said, wiping his mouth with his napkin, having finished his second piece of pie.
It was exactly the kind of shit Dean didn’t want to ever think about, because thinking about his parents have sex with each other was traumatic enough, let alone having sex with other people, or all of them having a… whatever… together. As a group.
“Can’t you just, I don’t know, snap your finger or work your angel mojo and get yourself back to wherever you’ve been hiding?” Dean pushed past Cas, needing something to do with his hands and working in the kitchen would be a start, at least. He headed down the short hallway to the main room of the cabin and flicked on the lights over the kitchen and dining space.
They’d worked together, Jack and Cas, building and reshaping Heaven, removing walls and breaking locks, and stripping out the things that had made it more of a holding cell for souls, rather than a place of peace and rest.
In the course of their banter, they’d ended up standing close together, not even a foot apart, their eyes locked together, Dean able to feel the heat of Castiel’s body with as little space as there was between them. The moment Dean realized it, he took a step back, then had to watch as Cas’ face fell, just a bit, as he realized what Dean had done.
“I don’t want to talk about Adam, Mom! I don’t want to talk about his mom. I don’t want to talk about all the shit we went through, growing up, that it turns out we didn’t actually need to go through. And I certainly don’t want to talk about ‘my friend’ as you call him. Especially not with you!” He pointed at his father with the butter knife, realized what he’d done and dropped it with a clatter on the table.
"Sam, not talking to you."  Dean's looking right at her and but Sarah's not looking at him.  She's looking at the row of small stones next to her own and Dean knows then that they're her children.  He doesn't know her story, but he can read the sadness on her face.  "They're waiting for you, you know.  You don't need to stay here."
And yet, here he was, drinking his shitty beer, sitting next to Bobby, the sun was shining, the temperature was perfect, just warm enough to not need a jacket but cool enough that Dean and all his layers were perfectly comfortable.
“Dean’s angel, John. The one who pulled him out of Hell. Who put him back together.” Mary’s smile faltered a bit and she looked down at the condensation ring from her glass.
So he'd done what any normal person would do, run away as far and fast as he could. It's not like Dean had known how he felt anyway, no matter how hard he tried to show him. Coffee in the morning, pie while they were researching for a hunting trip, the soft way he said his love's name. But then last night, he'd heard a prayer. A really long one from Dean. He couldn't remember everything that had been said, the tears had made it hard to concentrate, but he would remember the last line until the end of time, "What if I fell in love with a lie?"
"You Sarah?"  She slowly nods her head.  He points to the stone.  "And this is you?"  She nods again, more emphatically.  "Because if I dig up the wrong Sarah, and have to do it again, I'm gonna be pissed."  She points at the stone herself, with more force than she's shown previously, so Dean's pretty sure that this is it.  "Right.  Let's do this."
Castiel wasn’t exactly thrilled to be in their current situation. He was thrilled to be with Dean, that wasn’t a question, but being with a Dean that didn’t want to be with him wasn’t exactly what he considered a good time.
"Yes, Dean.  I'm ready."  Sam's got that snotty tone that he adopted when he was about thirteen.  He gets it every now and then, and every time he does, Dean wants to do something immature, like give him a wedgie or drop some ice down the back of his shirt.  Now, he just ignores it, wanting to get this done before they got too far off track.
“I like popcorn,” Jack had said, the idea of making popcorn and adding extra butter lifting his spirits. Sam had chuckled, but with a closed mouth, and patted his shoulder.
, which they were going to talk about on the drive back to Jack, there wasn’t any way Cas was getting out of that one.
Mary’s hand whipped out and grabbed him by his upper arm, squeezing tight. “I take it back. You’re brilliant!”
He and Sam start digging, falling into old patterns and rhythms as they break up the hard packed dirt and move it away.  It's Sam who hits the casket first but it's Dean who breaks it open.  She was buried in the same white dress that her ghost is still wearing, her hair left long and loose.  She's beautiful, Dean thinks, if you can get around the fact that she's a spirit, haunting a road, possibly killing people.
The sound of wings fluttering stopped him before he could say anything else and he saw his angel, standing there looking at the table. When Dean finally looked at the table, he saw what Castiel did. Two tall candles flickered in the center of the table, a pot of something sat covered but it smelled delicious, and a vase held a single red rose.
Fuck it, Dean was tired of pretending. Tired of lying, hiding what he felt, day in and day out, always keeping a close rein on his emotions. Closing the distance, he reached up a hand toward Castiel’s face, stopping just before his hand touched flesh. Drawing his hand back, he sighed. “Cas, I’m sorry about this morning.”
This had all happened hours ago. He had thought to be back at Baby by now, but wandering around the woods in the dark, he had lost all sense of direction. Probably had something to do with feeling woozy and light-headed from blood loss.
That one moment made Castiel realize something. If God could be angered because they were not following his plan, that meant there was free will. That meant that even through all of the pain and misery and anguish, Dean truly had fallen in love with him. And even though Castiel did not truly have a soul because he was a celestial being, he liked to think that maybe he had a bit of free will as well. And if he had free will, that meant his love for Dean was also real.
Apparently, the plan had been for Castiel to fall in love and realize that Dean would never feel the same. God wanted his wayward son to return home, not to continue lowering himself to the base needs of a short-lived human. But finding that out only confused Castiel more. If God wanted him to fall in love, but he didn't want Dean to do the same, then maybe there was free will. But what if the free will was only on the human side?
If you think that God is pushing you together, so you run away, what if that was his intention all along? But if you go back to that person after thinking that God didn't want you together, but he truly did, then you're playing right into his hand again. There didn't seem to be a right answer. But according to his brother, Castiel had been manipulated. Now, he did tell him one thing that gave him pause. Accidentally leaving part of his essence in Dean had not been a part of the plan.
Dean vaguely noticed the table set, a candle flickering, but his gaze was drawn to the blood streaks that led through the small building. They went over carpet, almost as if someone had dragged a body toward the back door. It stood wide open, and he approached it cautiously. When Dean saw the man and woman outside, lying on the ground, stomachs missing from where something had eaten their entrails, he sighed and lowered the gun. It must have been the wendigo, the claw marks on their bodies gave that much away.
“I fucking love you.” Dean grabbed the lapel of the angel’s coat, pulling him against his body, letting out a small hiss of pain. But he didn’t care, he just wrapped one arm around his waist under the coat, bringing the other up to thread in his dark hair. “God, I don’t know why I waited so long for this.” Pulling Castiel’s head toward his, he pressed a fevered kiss against his lips, groaning when their tongues met.
Last year after God had killed Jack, they found out that he'd been manipulating the Winchester brothers all along. That nothing they've ever done had been fully their choice. That God had just been trying to create the perfect story, something to entertain themselves.
He stumbled, falling to the ground. Dean’s stomach was killing him. The wendigo had slashed a long cut from his left pectoral down to his hip. He had managed to stifle the bleeding somewhat with his undershirt, ripping it into bandages and tying them tight. But still, he knelt on the ground, desperately aching to take a full breath.
And if there was even the slightest hint that free will existed, that the boys had chosen the same path over and over again not because God wanted it, but because it was the right thing to do... then that left the possibility that Dean's love was real. And if Dean's love was real, then maybe Castiel's was too.
After a while, he noticed some lights in the distance. Maybe, just maybe, if he could make it to them, he would find help. There had been a brief moment when he had thought to call Castiel, but they had argued earlier that morning. Same stupid shit they always argued about. Absolutely nothing. Sometimes that angel really ground his gears, making him see red. There were other times when they were alone, and he would look into those brilliant blue eyes, losing himself and his train of thought. But all those times served to do was make him angrier. The angel confused the hell out of him. One moment, all he wanted to do was punch him in the face. The next, he wanted to push him against the wall and…
Castiel took another step toward Dean, putting their bodies only inches apart. Lifting his hand, he cupped his cheek, running fingers through the scruff his hunter sported. “You are not an asshole, Dean. Not unless I am as well. Would you say that I’m an asshole?” When Dean shook his head, Castiel smiled. “There you go. We fight because…”
It was exactly how Castiel felt, down to the most minute details. If Chuck wrote the story... if he pushed them together, was it really love? Did Dean truly love him? The thoughts that he could were accompanied by feelings of elation, but at the same time, they terrified him. In millennia of existence, he never felt like this before, not with another human being, and not with another angel.
“If you think that’ll keep me from driving Cas back, you haven’t met me!” Dean yelled to the ceiling.
, which he didn’t even drop into the tub, and walked smack into another person, who hadn’t been there when Dean had gotten in to the tub.
“How?” Dean asked. “I mean, you even admit that your ‘people skills’” (and Cas could tell he was doing air quotes at that) “are rusty. So what makes you think you should have been able to tell?”
“Yes.” Jack sat tall, his glass in front of him, his hands on his lap, looking both as uncomfortable as anyone John had ever seen and perfectly comfortable in Mary’s presence. It was an odd dichotomy.
As Jack stood still and let the download of energy and information from Chuck settle in his brain, the idea of Castiel trapped in the Empty, being tortured by a creature that was angry and unstable and terribly, terribly old became more and more upsetting.
In the center of the intersection stands a woman in white.  Dean's breath catches and his hands reach for a shot gun that isn't there.  Her dress billows in the wind, her hair whipping around her face.  She glows, like she's lit from within, but Dean thinks it just because she's in his headlights.  She raises one hand and beckons.
Castiel stuck to the office, as it were, and spoke to Jack and that was about it. He didn’t try to branch out and make friends with any of the new angels Jack had helped create, nor did he want to spend time with any of the angels that had survived from the original batch Chuck had made.
At least it was, until he walked out of the bathroom, having taken a long bath (which he would never admit to, ever) while reading
He didn’t see Dean get up, didn’t hear him walking on his knees over to Cas’ side of the table. He could feel Dean’s hands on him, warm through all his clothing, but instead of making him calm down, it just made him cry harder.
"What the hell, Dean?"  Sam is really awake now, body tense next to him, Cas still slouching in the back seat.
Dean had said that Cas had been pulled into the Empty, that he’d sacrificed himself to save Dean, and Jack knew that it was the truth the same way he knew that chocolate was the best and that flannel sheets were superior to anything else you could put on a mattress.
All of that came back to him, as if it’d just happened, as he took his first sip and continued with each additional drink.
“I know what you told Dean,” Jack said, looking at Castiel’s face, watching the emotions flash across it. Jack knew what was going on in his head, he had all those Chuck powers, but he knew that it only went one way and he owed Castiel the respect to at least talk it through and figure out what he wanted and needed without Jack just telling him what to do, all willy nilly.
“What am I… oh, Jack. Nothing. I’m not going to do a thing. I said my piece and now I’m going to do my best to help you reform this space into what Heaven should have always been.”
“I wish you’d call them something else,” Castiel said, grimacing, then taking a sip of his perfectly brewed tea.
Neither of them were perfect, not before and certainly not then, but they’d never been this honest with each other, this open. It was both refreshing and terrifying all at the same time.
“Oh, sweetie,” she said, smiling as she patted the quilt next to her, motioning for him to join her on the ground. “Don’t ruin all your mother’s secrets.”
Jack reached the gate a bit before Mary and opened the latch, which meant that Mary only had to walk right up to him and envelope him in a huge hug the second she was close enough to do so. Jack leaned into her, pressed his face in to her hair for a moment, looking for all the world like he was holding back tears, and then he stood tall, looking directly at her face.
He had not brought up any of his questions or concerns, especially not wanting to do so in front of his mother. He didn’t want to have to explain why he’d never told her about Adam when she’d been alive and with them in the bunker. Or why he hadn’t confided in her about how everything had made him feel. About why he’d felt like there was a distance between them, a large part caused by Dean not wanting to make her return any harder than it already was and his need to protect her, which he’d suffered from since he’d been a very small kid.
“Hell, might as well go big or go home,” Dean muttered, seemingly to himself before he dropped down to the rug, pulling off his ring as he went. He ended up on one knee, holding out the ring to Cas, a slight waver in his hand the only thing signaling that he might be even the slightest bit nervous. “Cas, will you be my husband? I like the sound of that better than partner.”
"What what is going on" you whine out.. Dean quickly says "I don't, I don't know what happened.. It just happened and we're here and.. and I'm so sorry don't hate me." Cas just looks at you with apologetic eyes.
You say "it's okay! It's okay! I don't know what to say but I mean, can I least join" you manage to giggle out. Cas opens the door and reaches for your arm and you move closer to him and he pulls you in to the Impala and closes the door. Dean starts kissing you all over while cas starts pulling at your bra and panties.
“I would have known,” he said, raising his own chin, unwilling to give in but feeling completely lost.
these stories will focus on dean, sam, cas and eileen as the main characters and build on their relationships/arcs. for me, this story is closure on certain things, which may not be the closure you're looking for! i respect that :)
"I think you're a dick for making me do all that, when you knew how." Dean starts, delighted to see a knowing smile rise on the face caught between his hands. “And,” Gently he presses his lips to a freshly shaven cheek. “I think I love you anyway."
"And we haven't exactly got a lot of trump cards in our deck. So uh, forgive me for not trailing his name - for not telling a woman who's going to forget I exist, the minute we roll out."
The trucker beside him gives his arms a once over, red flannel rolled to the elbows. "Nice tats." He hears and wishes there was warding that stopped dudes chatting him up with their dicks out.
He's steady pulling Dad from his stool, steady working their way into the Impala, steady staring down the dark dusty road ahead. He wonders where the hell he's even driving to, since Dad didn't book a room. He sees Sammy sleeping in the backseat and dreads the day when he'd have to hustle tables too.
"Woah, cold hands." Shocked, the words slip out as a defense for anyone stumbling across them. They probably knew by now that a gentle touch to the forehead would woosh away worrying injuries, that the way Cas covers the wounds on his side was a tad too intimate.
He blinks the tunnel lights from his vision, watching their wandering trail catch on Sams' smile. Not for the first time, he's proud of his little brother, thankful Eileen was the one guiding him out of the dark - dotting dates and dreams like lanterns.
Sliding into the seat opposite, he waits for the storm of flirtation to abate. Waits for her advances to be brushed off, to hear something,
"Age, growth, pregnancy. Any bodily function a human has would halt upon an angelic entrance." Cas leans down to throw Miracle a stick. "How an angel viewed a vessel always differed. Raphael saw them as offices, controlling them at a desk. Hannah saw them as boats, guiding them down rivers."
Winding the frayed edges of himself together, he pats off his knees and heads back to that switch filled room.
As he screeches on the water, using the remaining soap on himself, he wonders what sort of house Scarlet lives in that nobody saw the thick letters painted on her forehead.
“No, Sam - it’s not like that. Dad’s on his way so just, go on with the show. I’ve got a buddy in the hall making sure nobody misses a thing.” The coded words clench Sams’ jaw, because Dad wouldn’t come to their school unless the monster was here.
Ah, they didn't think that far ahead and as he's spinning a lie, the front door opens. "That'll be him." Daryn explains, standing up as they turn around to greet -
With her waved promise down the hallway, fingers catching the sun struggling through the locker-lined windows, he takes her advice. Sure enough, the door by the blue bucket leads to a room - the gym showers.
"Yep, it’s starting now and everyone’s wondering where you are." Dean confirms, ushering them down the hallway, cracking jokes until they get close. The light and music pounds, but behind them builds a screech - he pushes at Gunner’s back, forcing him and Mrs Parrish inside the door.
Dean doesn't dare think of controlled centuries, his hand twitching forwards for comfort. "Are you still squatting in Jimmys' suburban then?"
So when he sees Dean in the dark parking lot, he can't help his own hope. Then he sees the slouch, the defeat in his eyes and twists away, balling his fist to his head. Now?
Behind her, Sam had dug down warding into the mud and was whispering what to do, the monster shambling forwards. Alarmed, she shakes her head, but he nods and presses the crowbar into her hands.
Distracted, he checks his circled shoulder with an enochian symbol inside, lines of blue broken by that bite. "Uh, don't remember. Cas wanted me to get it." His brother didn't need to know he'd been searching for an answer too.
the smile, fingers reaching up to tug the tie of Cas' suit ensemble. The move jostles him closer and he skims his knuckles away, before he does something stupid.
".... parched as hell because the dickbag owner cut our water." Dean speaks into the flip phone wedged between his shoulder and ear, turning the Impala into the sunny school parking lot. "Yes, sir. We'll meet you there. Understood."
His brother forces a laugh, pained and uncomfortable, red blood glinting as his throat works. He waits until John fades into the shadows before crouching down by Deans' side, using his sleeve to scrub the blood off his face.
Slowly, his brother slides his phone away as any movement would draw attention. His head turns and he jolts -  the wing mirrors had the same staring white pits of eyes. "How did it find us?"
"Oh, you're kidding." Dean grins, gleeful as hell to imagine a celestial creature stuffing itself inside a kiddy castle. "Tell me it had a slide."
"I hate him." Sam realises, the truth settling in his heart. Tugged like dogs around the world, tied up at stores or schools, never given the time of day unless they made a mess.
Gunners eyes slide to the stooped over black-haired man. "I'm sorry you do." It's worse that this guy seems genuine, like he wants to know him - like he already kind of did. They run down to the dregs, when Gunner claps his shoulder. "I play the baseball pitch on Thursdays, if you ever want to see my game."
Not missing this chance to run, he jostles Aldana and sprints through the shelves. Her headwound must be clearing up because she gets her feet under herself, struggling not to slip as they race past piles of useless garbage - he skids a little, his flashlight catching on a long beam of metal, fingers fumbling to drag it along with them. Who thought he'd be so glad to see a crowbar, he could almost kiss it. There's no time though as they bump against the steps, Dean pushing at Aldanas' arms to get her ahead and closer to the door.
"He made you do it!" Aldana insists in a burst, fearlessly stepping closer, as if she had held onto the words too long that even a monster would not dissuade her. "I know you would never hurt anyone - you have to let him go."
Close but no cigar. He can hear his brother struggling with his lighter, so a fire related monster doesn't seem likely. He sighs over the article boasting another loss.
!" As he'd been turning around, the thing had spirited through the mist again and dug it's teeth into his side. Air becomes harder to catch, every move of his pulsing lungs sending pain down to where the creature digs in. "I'm not gonna be your happy meal tonight, sucker." Dean grits through his teeth, slashing the crowbar towards the molting head.
When the curtains draw across the stage, he still doesn't know shit about the play, but he breaks out into a grin as Sammy high-fives Avery afterwards like kids are supposed to. Her hands curl into her black-red skirt nervously and Sam suggests she talk to her cousin, currently collecting flowers on the stage.
Looking like he'd been caught saying something he shouldn't, Dean hisses a match to life and drops it into the grave.
He wasn't wasting his time with waterfall factoids, from the perspective of a being who had seen the first fall of rain. He wasn't hushing his complaints about constantly scrubbing mud off their clothes and gear. He wasn't
Aldanas' weight stops him from properly fighting this thing, and his priority right now is getting her safe. If they can get to the door - the creature lunges for his neck and he manages to jam his shoulder up in time, grunting when it chomps down.
"Not this time." He waggles his brows, tapping the cheerleading picture. "I got myself a way to keep busy."
but then his gaze slides to the goth girl. Right, his cousin. He was probably more scared for her up here in the dark, than his sister shining under the lights.
Sam reaches up towards the mirror - the monsters' eyes snap to his hand, tracking where it couldn't reach outside of the thin metal frame. "There's something scratched on the back of this."
Maybe he got a little competitive throwing, trying to sink them far from shore but it'd been worth it for the relieved laughter of the sisters.
scored down the spine. It's thick with newspaper and notes, not falling apart but close, the brass clasp barely containing the contents.
He knows the feeling, checking on Dad to see him making moves on a lady at the bar. Sweetening her up to buy him a drink, despite the winnings in his pocket.
Greeting his husband with a kiss, Daryn gestures to their presence. He scrambles to slam the brakes on this sudden sensory info-dump, tries to maintain neutral as the man shakes Sams' hand first. But fuck if he can't kill his heart rate at that same easy smile, the thick tanned arms leading to a hand that easily dwarfs his in welcome.
Sam grins, coming to the same conclusion. Damn, it feels good to smile now that the case was wrapping up. He ignores the flash of tan, black and blue across his mind - still stuff to do before he could think of home.
Hustling was harder, knowing Sam was sleeping alone outside in the car. Dad goaded the guys into games, bragging taller stacks of singles each time. Dean, well, he was the sugar-sweet clutz who missed pockets and grinned mistakes into his palm, catching the eye of anyone assuming an easy win.
"Shame about the scorches it's uh, nice place you got here." Dean offers, hands clenched in his pockets. "Safe." He taps the extinguisher perched on the counter.
Stilling her hand, he raises the light level, remembering black marker droplets on a fraying dress. "Maybe being fake is what she needs."
Turns out, hunting instincts transferred well into hitting light and sound cues. Bright costumes, fantasy stories on a stage where he could correct the myths in a murmur to other intrigued students.
"With that all said, I'll leave you to experiment on your own up here." And just maybe, he'd explode. "Your
Lost in possibilities, his watch-digits flash close to midnight. A shadow falls across the dull orange light slanting from the bathroom and his gaze drifts over Cas leaning against the doorway.
Sam sleeps poorly. At some point, his brother covered him in their stolen motel blanket and wedged his hoodie under his head. But even with that,
"Did you lose your mind?" Dad starts off softly. "Someone slip you something, head not heal right?" It's thrumming with concern but Dean knows what's going to happen down this road of conversation and braces, staring past the dashboard.
Dean knows fuck all about that hunter, but he knows his dad grieves furiously and that this road leads to the bar. He bites his lip in frustration.
Every reflective surface, windows, glasses, metal pipes, the same stare. Empty of anything but hunger, frustration. It stalked their movements, waiting behind a thin barrier to attack, withheld only by sheer luck that they'd used fake identities.
No response. He looks at the journal where they'd been recording case notes and his lips pinch in irritation. "How's the research going?"
Seems like Wade Tarn agreed. "Alright, listen to this." He smacks the fuzzing computer to stop the static. "
"Her husband." Aldana croaks, heavy hands tentatively touching around her wounds. "Names… in a notepad. I thought finding one would help her." She's not making much sense, but she is speaking without coughing blood and that's good enough for him.
out there." He cracks his beer, flicking open their fake identity box as Sam takes the stable chair opposite.
Black scorch marks mar the cabinets, snaking around the skirting and various spots on the walls, like someone went haywire with a flamethrower.
"Kicked out the original owners." Gunner grins like he should know what that means. He tenses, because no matter how much he tried to forget Gunner and his life, of course it was still there, buried under a trapdoor.
"That kid…" He shares a look of commiseration with his smudged self. The door clicks closed and he snips the thread. It's silent when he clatters the scissors down on the porcelain sink.
Another voice asks, roiling his heart and sending his speech to a separate stratosphere, paralleling Baby right inside two white lines.
He picks up his shirt, fabric sticking uncomfortably to his blood-slick side. The needle bites, a numbed sensation of tugging skin with each stitch. From the car he keeps an eye on the sisters, but they're kicking this things' ass now that it was trapped.
Cas doesn't seem to share the same reservations, slipping one hand under his short sleeve and the other rumples the edge of his shirt, spanning the tender bruised skin.
Breathlessly he answers the call, the third ring just breaking. "Sir?" He clears his wrecked voice, haze fading as he listens for orders.
Dean raises his eyebrows. "That's, wow. How'd you manage it?" His persona peels back, presented with a past he was tentative to hear about.
For towns now, he'd been robbing joints so Sammy could eat, putting his ass on the line during hunts, pretending there would be praise at the end of it. He's been bugging his brother to join a club, so he wouldn't eat, work, sleep in the cold car and now Dad's going to blow their motel room money at the fucking
"Alright, note it down." He says, using the motel mirror to direct the needle, his tongue poking through teeth in concentration. He rolls his eyes seeing Sam sit straight down and pick up a pen. "Not
Guiltily he grabs Gunner and kisses with every trick in the damn book, sick knowing the stakes, but when he breaks away all he sees is a starstruck soldier.
"Smartass." He mutters, hooking a hand under Cas' arm to pull him towards the bathroom. It's not huge but there's space for his angel to curiously peer over his shoulder, as he unpacks the kit.
"I don't think it can hurt us, not without our real names." Sam sits back as the car turns another corner, the eerie stare shuddering in frustration. He points out a split in the road, leading down towards the towns' library. "If anyone hired a monster, then it's someone living here. We've got to find out who, before they find the real us."
"We've got one more surprise for you." Dean drums on the table, excited murmurings building in the bunker kitchen between family and friends.
"Vanished but no reports, that's what's been bugging me about this case." Sam stops, holding the newspaper still in recognition. "Get this - B. Tarn wrote all these articles on the disappearances."
"I did. When I went in without my gear, I knew the smoke and heat could kill me too - then it all stopped, like there never was a fire." Gunner turns his coffee cautiously. "I didn't see the woman Daryn did. Is she like that other… thing?"
Sam looks at him expectantly and, no way is he leaving. This womans' got their names typed up, ready to bundle their death away as another disappearance. His brothers' eyebrows bounce, making his jaw set. They needed to find more, and this was a chance to poke around. Fine.
"Mr Lassai?" Dean asks, flashing his reporters badge as a man opens the door, his gold and green satin wrap elegant over his cool umber skin. He holds a wine glass like it's supposed to be held, skimming them over shrewdly.
Sam pulls the jumper over his head, before spreading his case notes across the table. "What we know, is that three people of completely different ages, incomes and backgrounds vanished."
A flash of silver arcs through the air, and she catches it with a flick of her hand. She stares at the keys in awe - it was something they'd talked about in passing, the perfect place to run operations from, though she never really thought it could happen. She'd been stepping up as Sams' second in command since the incident, but being told she was great was nowhere near as profound as the proof.
"How do you think I left?" His indulgent smile grows as Dean roars in laughter, slapping his leg for his phone.
"No pulling those eyes on the other hunters." He clears the warmth from his throat, scratching the hinge of his jaw. "We don't need more strays at the bunker."
He signs, smoothing down his hair and Dean chuckles at how hastily the phone sets up on the dash. Leaning over, he gives his glimpse of her a grin. Brown hair tied back, she tugs a stifling shirt collar, outlined by an orange sun-glow flooding through the rolled down window.
Leaning over the papers now, his brother nods. "So, either they bolted without a trace, or something grabbed them before they could."
"What are you doing?" A confused voice asks over his shoulder and he flinches in surprise. Her frown crinkles the dark shades of makeup on her face, slightly sweating through her black-red clothing.
of lurking in it's pages." Smug as anything, he folds his arms. "Yeah, it used to be mine - until Sam started scrawling in it and then Cas, so it's a gift from all of us."
He hadn’t even hustled as much cash as he could have, which meant Sammy wasn’t safe, because - he suffocates that thought into silence. No way he could think about him now, not under this scrutiny.
"There is no house anymore." Cas admits, whistling for their dog to stick close. "When I returned Jimmy to his Heaven, it dilapidated - destroyed once I became human." Crawling out of the rubble, choking on plaster, confused and bombarded with the whole world without walls.
"Oh Sammy, you sly dog!" His brother laughs where he lays in the backseat, breath fogging in the cold car. He leans over, knees knocking into the wheel to shove him in embarrassment. "Breaking hearts all around town, is that it?"
"Should be - this is our first stop," Sam screws his face up in confusion. "But, it looks like the guys inside haven't moved out yet."
"No? Then tell me son," Dad leans in close before he unleashes his tidal anger, a foul wrath wrapping around him. "Why you're telling
"Yeah, left him in the sun too long." Dean smiles fondly, resisting the urge to fell him from his precarious position.
Middle of day, middle of class, he's glad to have already done this module on the road - forty times over. He lends a pen to some guy, indifferent when it splinters under his shoe, asking for another. Answers filled early, he stares out the dusty windows until it's time to go back to Dean.
"That's alright, I know the paper these guys are from." They stiffen in surprise, going with the curveball. "They need all the facts to do a good job. So, I'll tell them off the record - these fires had no accelerant and started in unusual places in the home, no electric cables or heat sources."
Exhaling, he chucks his bag onto the map-table where it crumples stretches of paper and skitters pencils to the floor. Were they doing arts and crafts in here or some shit? Whatever, he'll pick it up in a minute. After he rests his eyes.
"Something like that." Sam says, looking over his shoulder to the bleakness surrounding them on all sides.
Wisps of white mist curl off the lake, cold bursts sending shivers across the surface and down their spines. Supported by stilts near the dark body of water is the Tarn house, held over marshy ground that sinks their steps as they march forward.
"Very long." Cas rumbles, reminiscent of that waterfall and he floats on the rapids of his tone. "Fourteen days worth." Yeah, he hears that, whistling sympathetically and shifts when his gaze darts down to pursed lips. Picture-perfect, his head unhelpfully replays Eileen reaching up to greet his brother with a kiss, knuckles turning white with tension.
"Gross." He flips it open, seeing the theatre club and twisting his lip. "How long are we staying?" He asks blankly.
"Let me get you a refill." Gunner says, picking up his husbands' wine glass before pointing directly at Dean. "You mind helping carry in some coffees?"
Sam smiles as he always does, learning the town bullies and sweethearts. Didn't they know, once you left, these things didn't matter?
Outside the circle of crackling fluorescent, he can't sense anything strange about the shadows. Braver, he makes to move for the second when a crashing sound shocks him. He waits. When he hears it again, he switches off his torch and dives for the door it came from.
The case was more complex than they first thought. The other victims' houses had been much the same, repair and phone bills. The locals peering past thin curtains, glimpses of ghostly lives that didn't want to get involved.
"I'm gonna stop soon." Dean announces to a grunted agreement, pulling into the outer lane and preparing to turn off into a pit stop. Sams' phone breaks the lull of noise, sharp and soon quelled by him accepting the call.
"Sammy." Dean calls across the space and no, he doesn't want to hear it. The lights inside the hall beckons and he runs.
"What?" Dean grunts, climbing back into the car. This case was crawling like a cockroach under his collar and driving him
"We're doing the lights!" Her voice fades as he skids to a stop in the dark hallway. Three bulbs flicker above him, separated by shadows. Switching on his torch, he leaves the dim doorway and uses the bright beam to bring him under the first light.
"Well, whoever wrote the article on him disappearing, implied he ran away because of debt." Sam unfolds a slip of paper. "But get this - dude was married. His partner never mentioned in the article and never appeared in town after it was written. Both just, gone."
take Cas out on a date, he'd dream up more than a motel evening. They'd see a movie, not one they'd already watched though. No, something new, for both of them.
He can sense an awkwardness in the air, as Daryn tugs his gown closer and laughs politely. "Excuse me just a second." He motions, heading up the stairs. Sam wonders what he said out of turn, checking over to see Dean distracting Gunner as he's given free range of the room.
Metal hums on his tongue, his whole body lightly thrumming under Cas' concentration. A gentle dip of his brows, lids closed as if this was his most important task and the aches from his wounds wind up arteries and into Deans' heart. "Don't strain yourself, man. This stuff heals by itself."
Because the monster was coming, here. And as much as he hates thinking it, Gunner knew the people better than he did. He’d have more luck keeping them in the hall.
Moms' ring was their last real evidence that there'd been a life before all this, that maybe there would be after, and it never left Deans' torn knuckle.
"Are you coming too?" He asks into a dead line meaning yes, he would be following the monsters here. He exhales sharply, flipping the phone closed and pressing a knuckle into the tension between his eyes. How the hell is he supposed to round up all the kids and parents - lips press against his jaw and he jerks, roughly shoving back the offender.
"He do the same work as you?" Gunner asks cautiously, losing his air in a huff when he nods. "Christ. At least we're in good hands." He looks to the burn marks on their wall, shaking his head. "I'm just glad my sisters moved out when they did, unless the fire goes to them next."
Sam draws in his legs, climbing to wedge himself into the footspace before the backseat. The piping of the Impala digs into his sides uncomfortably and his head catches painfully on metal, as John rests along the drivers' seat.
The sliver of moonlight guiding him splinters and dies, the door swinging shut behind him, and a slow moan of pain echoes inside the pitch black basement.
"That's why," Sam searches in the box, triumphantly folding out two laminated cards. "We should go look at their house."
Sam slips silently away, ignoring the sigh. "Next town, it won't be like this." It's not a promise his brother can keep, knows that he'll try anyway and will bruise for his troubles.
"Damn right you do." Gunner shakes his head in disbelief, drowning his dregs and slapping the table once as he stands. "Alright, well, I'll see you out."
i had a bunch of fun making the lore for this creature and also the water related names - as always, i'd love for feedback if you have any below, it'll really help how i form the upcoming chapters! about the case or characterizations, anything <3
"Ha, what a gun-slinging pair we make then." He grins and it’s not a line, but it reels him in anyway. Taking in how Gunner leans with his beer, bicep pressing up against the thin varsity jacket sleeve.
"Matt says there's a mist coming in heavy on the roads. Might want to switch your headlights on early." He drawls as Dean scrubs soapy hands in the sink, wondering why this guy is warning him - until he glimpses in the grimy reflection, blue jeans and red flannel.
He swings his light down over the mirror and that's when he notices, the beam only catches on frames and smudges. None of the mirrors have reflections. Looking closer, some of these streaks were intense, peach-coloured blurs, outlines of hair and features lost in distortion. He runs a hand over scratches in the wood, matching older names of the vanished - their smudges like fingerprints, faint and flickering, a fading pulse.
He'd joined under Deans' demand, needing somewhere safe to store him until the hunt was done, and it was the only one open. Scripts and performing, he couldn't do to save his life, so they dropped him in front of a mixing deck and said
Forehead slick with cold sweat, the bite gets more aggressive, digging down to tear Dean apart. He'd survived too much to die from a stomach wound - his fingers scrabble to its' throat to rip the head off him, but they slip through mist.
Wiping her hands, she extends one tensely. "Scarlet… Dunnel." She adds her last name, like it should mean something to him. He shrugs, shaking right back.
When he wins and acts surprised, his crowd laugh in good spirits, deeply contrasting the shoves Dad endures as he silently takes their singles to the bar. He takes a table near the window with sand caught in its' scratches, keeping an eye on Sammy outside and Dad in the reflection, settled for a long night.
That was what Cas would've said before, unsure and needing guidance. Human adjacent now, all he does is run a hand over the bristles and hums. "It's a sign of aging." He muses softly, an ancient creature content with creaking human bones. "My vessels never got the chance to age."
No way fate decided to fuck him over like this. He feels Sam side-eyeing him hard, because he can tell Deans' discovered something that's going to make their life, hell. He shifts subtly, like he wasn't getting smashed in the skull, submerged in sickening memories of their past. Some fuckin' Oasis.
"Take care, Dean." Drowning in the soft warning, one he'd enforce even states away, he thumbs over Cas' cheek and excuses it as flecks of ash.
Generally, he did not like to be known. He didn't like being a book to browse through. But Cas knew him cover to cover, analysed phrases he didn't understand until it made sense, kept pages free of dust.
"Shadestalker." Dean stiffens, assessing the threatening shadows around them. “We need to draw it out." Dad gestures where light, music and laughter seep out from under the large door at the end of the hallway. "What's that?"
Moonlight through windows makes mountainous shadows out of the lockers, a thin path of light to stalk the halls in, machete drawn. A door bangs. Dean crushes against the wall as he creeps to the corridors’ corner. A slow shuffle starts and he steps lightly, jacket barely brushing brick as he moves.
The night of the play, he wears the best shirt he owns, having washed and stitched up the holes. Excitement buzzed through everyone in the club, it was finally time to show their friends and family the put together pieces of their play.
Dean strides over, watching his hesitant smile fade at the sight of blood. “You need to get back in the hall, now.” He commands, watching behind them with concern.
Sneaking into the victims house is incredibly easy in the mist, covering their movements as they jam open a window and unlock the front door. Similar to their own lodgings, it's a single storey that feels more spacious with only one bed in the room.
Cas turns back to him and they halt. After what happened, neither of them are fond of farewells anymore.
The baseball dugouts aren't all that special but they shelter him from the rain as he smokes, the added bonus of watching a free practice game. He remembers rhythmic thuds of returning a baseball at Bobbys, of frantically bashing in a monster head with a shaky cry for almost touching Sammy.
Fear, true fear of the dark, swells on Gunners’ face - dropping to where Deans' blood-dried hand wrapped around his forearm. Before he can do anything, he’s being crushed into an urgent kiss. He can’t let himself feel the concern in it, jerking away and scanning the shadows for monsters. Instead he finds a pair of disapproving eyes at the end of the hallway, staggered in blood.
"Yeah but, she came back from being a ghost, like you came back from all the shit God put you through, redeeming yourselves with that network. You're under the radar." Sam stays silent as Dean drinks his cherry coke, like he wishes it was liquor. "Cas and me." He flicks his head to the side, a host of history in that shake.
Screeching pierces through the air, and he flinches away. It reverbs off metal, padlocks pounding against lockers, a percussion jarring the upbeat songs seeping from the hall. The shadows start expanding, backing them into solitary slivers of moonlight.
Then he laughs at the fact tonight, he'd acted like his dad and like a queer, at how he'd fucked up and combined everything his family hated into one, broken, boy.
+: as i'm hesitant to post this, id really love to ask that if you enjoy any part of these stories (or have feedback!) to please comment, it's a writers gold and we treasure them <33
They shrug off their jackets, throwing both onto one bed and reprimanding Miracle for chewing the sleeves. The room fills with the hymn of fridges, lights flickering from glimmers of grace, the clink of bottles and delicate shake of dogtags.
It didn’t stop their talk though, Dean finding trickles of amusement among the usual town gossip, eyes flickering less to the bar as he enjoys the company. It’s not until Gunner drums his hands on the table to get them another drink that he realizes with a slow curl of dread - he’d just used Dads’ move. He glances to the bottle filled bar, seeing his father firmly in a stupor.
Folded suit in hands, he remained in boxers and a soft sleep shirt. With the confidence of three beers, he offers, "If you want to shave you can use my kit." Cas looks intrigued, ditching his clothes in his own canvas before unzipping Dean's. He turns the leather bag over curiously, rustling through cans and razors in the dim light. He stops drumming his fingers when Cas holds the razor upside down, knowing the damn idiot is playing him.
He'd gotten more protection sigils after everything with Chuck went down, just in case, so now his scarred arms were hilly hues of blue-green. Turns out one of Sams' network used to ink up hunters all the time and didn't mind the freebie for Dean.
The slap comes sharp and sudden, sending his head sideways with the force. Skin throbbing under the impact, blood rushing to the surface. He doesn’t dare meet the brimstone brown eyes burning shame into his skin. Blood splatters from his fathers' wound onto the floor, passing silent judgement on his failed soldier of a son.
He fumbles for the fake name he'd been introduced as in his absence. "Sam Reeds." His brother must be proud of that one.
He taps the first name noted as missing, an old lady with no remaining relatives to question her disappearance - only the newspaper boy noticed unread papers stacking up. "Most of them either lived alone, or were relatively new in town. Except this third guy."
A burst of light from the bathroom door opening jumps them apart, catching a skeletal monstrous hand wisp and disappear where it had been hovering behind Gunners’ back. Alright, he needs to stop panicking and get these people to safety.
"Your sister went missing?" Dean scans the torch over the mirrors through the mist again, but she shakes her head, hair sticking in the mud.
The crowd in the hall was starting to dissipate, though he sees Avery hesitantly hug her cousin, close to crying. He should head back to the car, if it hadn't ripped off into the night already.
“You should move in with me,” Dean said, talking through his third strip of bacon, dipped liberally in real maple syrup.
"What?  What do you want?"  Her dress flaps around her but doesn't make a sound and Dean realizes that there isn't nearly enough wind to make the fabric really move like that.  She turns, slowly, arm still outstretched but now she's pointing, up the road, to the west.  He can't see what she's pointing at, at first, but then he lets his eyes adjust and he can see the outline of a graveyard, small and crumbling.  "Got it.  I need to get some stuff.  Give me a minute."
“Great. Give me an hour to look through a few things and I’ll let you know what the plan is.” She popped up from the table and darted back to the house.
Dean always found that driving was the best way to clear his head, since he was first allowed behind the wheel.
“So, you gonna go find your boy or you just gonna sit there and mope, like an idjit?” Bobby took a drink from his own beer, raising his eyebrows as he looked at Dean.
So, he went to someone who knew Dean as well as Jack did and who might have an idea as to how to do this kind of sneaky thing without causing the whole process to blow up in his face.
“John, please. Don’t be overdramatic. I’m sure he’s fine, but something just needs… adjusting,” Mary said, smirking a bit. She winked at Jack who smiled at her, his face a bit lighter. “Am I close?”
“No idea but we’re smart to just let it ride. She’s smarted than both of us, combined, and twice as stubborn.”
He thought it’d make him uncomfortable to be there, not knowing the house and not knowing the relationship his mom and dad had built in their time reunited in Heaven without their kids.
“Exactly,” Dean breathed out, leaning in for another kiss. “Now’s the perfect time to start making up that deficit. You game?”
Jack had known that from the first moment his soul had touched Castiel’s grace, when he was still in his mother’s womb. What he hadn’t known was if Castiel was ever going to be brave enough to actually tell Dean.
He wasn’t sure what he thought about that. It was hard to give up the one constant in a person’s life, especially one that had taken up so much of his time and focus for the majority of his life.
“Away from here,” Dean answered, clinging to Baby’s keys, letting the gate shut behind him. It didn’t make a sound and the lack of a slam or even a click made it an even more frustrating way to leave the situation.
wouldn’t have held back. He’d have reached out to Dean, even if Dean would have slapped his hands away. Dean being a prickly son of a bitch had never deterred Castiel before and something in Dean was sad that it was now.
He stood up, brandishing the umbrella in one hand. “I’m gonna go out there, get the car, and drive’er over her to grab you, so you don’t get too wet, and then we’re going to have a long talk with our kid.”
“Jack. Jack did something,” Dean grumbled, getting more and more annoyed with his kid. “He and I need to have a conversation. Let’s take this back to the office or wherever you guys have been hiding out, and let’s see what the kid has to say for himself.”
“Partner, maybe?” Cas offered, seeing how Dean was not thrilled when he said ‘boyfriend’. “Less boy, less friend.” Then he smiled.
“Not your fault, Jack,” Sam had told him, his mouth smiling but his eyes infinitely sad, the weight of the world on his shoulders. “They’ll figure themselves out eventually. Until then, we just have to put up with their crap and make sure we have enough popcorn for when the shit really hits the fan.”
“That’s not what I said,” Dean snapped back. Cas held up a finger, right in Dean’s face, where even if he couldn’t see it, he should’ve been able to feel it there.
“I was mad,” Dean continued. “And then I was devastated, especially after you’d been pulled into the Empty and were just… gone.” Cas could feel Dean roll over under the covers, his face towards Cas’ back. Cas could tell he’d reached out with one hand but stopped just short of actually touching him. “how could you not tell me, not until the very end, when I felt the same way?”
Then he remembered that he was the Boss. He was in charge. There wasn’t anyone above him on the org chart (it was very odd that he suddenly knew about things like org charts when even a few days ago he couldn’t even tell you what Velcro was or who was currently President of the United States) and as such, he could do what he wanted.
The one thing Dean did know, that had been clear as the water in Crystal Lake in Michigan, where he and Sam had spent a summer when their dad had broken his leg and they’d been stuck in one place for five months. The water had been so clear, you could wade out until it was as high as your chin and still see your feet touching the bottom.
“Intervention? What, are you doing drugs? Have some kind of eating disorder? Oh, wait. You don’t eat.”
, the need to protect himself coming from years of feeling like he had to hide who he was and who he loved and why. Dean wasn’t there yet, basically.
“You go and find Karen, then?” Dean didn’t intend to be cruel about it. Well, no, he did. He just felt bad about it after he said it, knowing that it wasn’t the kind of thing he should have ever said to Bobby, of all people.
“Why not?” Dean asked, and Cas just knew he’d raised his chin, in that ‘ready to fight’ pose he’d always been so good at taking. “You don’t have exclusive rights on stupid, selfish self-hatred and lack of self-worth. Trust me, I’ve heard it all since I’ve been up here.”
He was making the rules and since he wasn’t trying to create the largest plot conflicts he could, like Chuck had been, Jack decided that he didn’t need to play by the same rules Chuck had made himself follow.
“I don’t know. I was thinking the weather?” Dean replied, then winked at him and that was all it took. Cas started giggling, then laughing, and then he was on his side on the rug, walking that line between hysterical laughter and hysterical sobbing.
"Oh, my God.  Just go back to sleep."  Dean slams the door shut, then rubs it gently, trying to apologize to his baby for treating her that way.  He debates popping the trunk and grabbing a shotgun but Cas is looking at him through the window, his finger pointing forward.  "All right.  Fine.  I'm going."
Cas didn’t know what to say to that. Dean wasn’t wrong. But it was like Dean had forgotten how angry he’d been, how explosive he’d been, about almost everything. How difficult he’d made sharing anything, especially the truth, between them. How his toxic masculinity made it such a treacherous path to walk, that Cas had decided it was safer to walk it in silence and live without what he wanted than to say something and risk bringing everything down around him.
“What about my prayer to you? The one in Purgatory? You weren’t able to tell then, and I did everything but spell it out with a skywriter.”
"I'm sure they could, Cas."  He puts the car in drive and pulls back onto the road.  It doesn't have any center lines, or any edge lines for that matter.  The pavement is new, so it's still black as ink and hard as hell to see in the darkness.  The moon shines down but doesn't do much to illuminate the way.  He feels more than sees Castiel lean forward, his breath on the back of Dean's neck.
He saw Mary sit back on her heels, out of the corner of his eye, and he focused on the back gate, where whomever it was would need to walk through in order to get back to them.
