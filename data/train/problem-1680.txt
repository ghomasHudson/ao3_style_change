“I’m fine, Captain,” Sherlock breathed softly, sensing John’s worry. Then as another man approached, he lifted his head and moaned, pushing back hard against John’s fingers. ‘What is Love’ began blaring out of the speakers above their heads, the beat vibrating through John and pulling him back into the moment. By the time the second verse was underway, John had the tip of his cock pressed against Sherlock.
“Oh god, you’re going to invite him ‘round for tea and buttered buns, aren’t you? Only I don’t mean edible buns.”
“At ease,” he said loud enough for the crowd to hear, then shielding himself by turning his back to the spectators whispered, “alright to kneel?”
“Oh, it’s about time you two got your heads out of your ar…”
The collar was made up of two strips of leather sewn on top of each other, with a single O ring in the front. The bottom layer of leather didn’t quite reach the front, forming wings, that would hug Sherlock’s throat. On the right wing, John had had the word “Locked” embossed.
Void of streetlights, or even the occasional light over a door, the alley was dark. The evening damp did little to help, grey clouds hung low casting the city in premature nightfall. Sherlock’s eyes adjusted to the dark quickly though, and soon he was able to make out shapes in the distance. He knew what to look for though, so that made spotting the man sitting on a bin child’s play.
John fell heavily, his movements hindered by clothing, but he laughed as his head hit the mattress. Kicking his legs, he sent his trousers and pants soaring through the air, then toed off his socks. Still fully clothed, Sherlock crawled over John, crowding him against the bed. Rubbing his nose along the shell of John’s ear, he spoke in a small voice.
“Yeah, she would have. She told us we could become anything we wanted. I told her I’d be a scientist and cure cancer. That always made her smile, even if it was a sad smile.”
“Hardly a point. Most clubs have professional cleaners come in, so their staff can focus on running the facility, not cleaning up vomit and urine. Any data I could have gathered would have been swept away after closing last night. I’ll need to familiarise myself with the layout before next weekend, but I dare say there’s no rush.”
find its way back to you. Correct?”
“Is that why you insisted on wearing your collar?” John hurried to catch up to Sherlock as the detective swept out of the store.
“If you two are quite finished, I already have the kettle on,” Mycroft called out, his voice tinged with amusement.
Leaning his back against the chair, he sat and idly fingered the collar around his neck. He soon became lost inside his mind palace walls and was jolted back to reality when a gentle hand touched his shoulder.
“When’s Otto coming back?” A voice shouted from the crowd, but Elvio gave him a scathing look, preventing anyone else from mentioning the man. No one who knew what had happened to Otto expected the man to return.
John thought, smiling fondly when Sherlock snuffled against his pillow, leaving a line of drool behind.
Sherlock sucked his bottom lip into his mouth then closed his eyes before saying, “I would like for you to be my Dom. While we are home, I desire to be
“Looks like you’re already someone’s pet, or do you just wear a collar to feel sexy?”
Sherlock silenced whatever John had been intending to say by wrapping his mouth around the top of John's cock. John swore under his breath. His tongue slid over parched lips. His hand flew up to the door frame, bracing himself as Sherlock began his task in earnest.
“Mm… Human trafficking fits the highest probability. But I encourage you not to let that cloud your judgment.”
“It’s always us, John. Just the two of us against the world.”
“I… yeah, I might be falling in love with you too. I think I have been, actually, for a while now.” John admitted, the words tumbling out of his mouth before he allowed himself time to be nervous.
Much to Sherlock’s surprise, she used the car quite regularly. She’d even taken a high-performance driving course. John still didn’t know who the car belonged to, though he’d commented on it more than once after taking the trash out.
Turning back to the man he loved, his heart tried to pry its way up and out of his throat. His first assumption that Sherlock’s clothing was intact proved to be only partly true. Sherlock's clothing was barely hanging on. His once fine shirt was now beyond repair. Stretch marks from where hands had grabbed at Sherlock now stretched out the fine mesh. His fishnets were torn, but much to John’s relief they were torn mostly at the knee and the parts of Sherlock’s calves that he could see. Sherlock’s skirt had been pulled up in the back, but that seemed to be as far as anyone had got. While filthy from being shoved to the floor, scraped up and bruised, his clothing was still intact. Mostly.
they take them.”
on the paper.
“Oh god, I’m not going to be able to sit during our flight, am I?”
“Sex attic, now,” John demanded, turning on his heels and heading up the stairs without waiting to see if Sherlock would follow.
“Right, sorry.” Snapping his jaw shut, John stamped down the urge to protest leaving a group of young girls vulnerable to future attacks. Sherlock’s words helped ease the worry lingering in the back of his mind.
It didn’t take long before Zed noticed him, recognition flickered across his face, and a broad smile broke out as he took in John’s black rose. With a few carefully manipulated knots, he tied off the woman’s tether and kissed her thigh before nodding towards a young man standing off to the side.
Sherlock couldn’t deny that part of him had harbored a shred of fear that John would enforce his position of power over him during a case. It was in John’s nature, after all, to see those around him healthy and taking care of themselves. However, he knew Sherlock would see sleeping while there was work to be done as a hindrance. His own worried mind reminding him that the longer it took to find them the more it lowered the chances of them being found alive. Sleep could (and would) come later when there was nothing else he could do but wait or when they were safe. If getting them to safety was an option.
“Through the office, you’ll find a door leading down.” One of them called to their group as they surveyed the mess.
“Oh God, yes,” Sherlock breathed, snuggling against John as warm fingers ran along his spine.
plan don’t you like?” Sherlock sighed, cutting straight to the chase.
"Mm." Sherlock hummed in a tone that told John he hadn’t heard a single word he'd said.
“No, our system isn’t that clear, nor do we keep footage for that long.”
“Oh, Tilly Briggs Cruise of Terror,” John said with an air of pride. “They’re going to love it.”
"Then there is something called subspace," he continued, "which is quite real despite what naysayers might say. It's a natural high, in which my whole world relies on John."
Reverently he placed the red cord around Sherlock’s neck and fastened the two loops together with the padlock, apologizing for the cold bite of metal against Sherlock’s neck. Once the collar was properly in place, John dragged both hands through Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock’s shoulders drooped as his whole body relaxed at the touch.
“No, don’t go,” Sherlock said, grabbing John’s arm as John tried to pull away. “Give me two minutes to cuddle with you.”
While John took a detour into the bathroom, Sherlock hurried excitedly towards their shared wardrobe. It was a pity that none of his clothes would fit John, but he’d seen John’s collection of clothing in its entirety now and had a good idea of what he would lay out for his Captain.
"John," Sherlock said in a whisper while coaxing John's chin up with two of his fingers, "I will only appear vulnerable. I'll have you watching me like a hawk every second."
“You never hit me, never mark me, bruise me, slap my chest. I wear your collar, yet you’re gentle with me.” Sherlock spoke as if still surprised that John wasn’t a brute in his claim for dominance. It tugged at John’s heartstrings. He often forgot just how vulnerable Sherlock was when it came to personal relationships. More than once, since they filled out their first contract, had he caught Sherlock watching porn for the sake of research.
"Okay," Rosie was five. She didn't quite understand the finality behind John's words. But she nodded solemnly, her blue eyes dancing between her father's faces. And she asked the question John had been dreading to hear.  "Papa sad?"
“About this alley, then,” making a show of looking around to see if they were alone on the street, Sherlock cupped his groin and squeezed. “I would like to cash in my reward.”
Flashing Sherlock a smile, John dropped the towel to the floor and nodded. Sherlock lingered in the chair for a moment longer, admiring John’s physique. But with a gentle nod at the kitchen from John, Sherlock was on his feet and gliding out of the room in a flurry of blue silk.
“Strip, and kneel in the Nadu position on the other side of this door. I don’t want to hear another word from you until I’m out of the shower.” With the command given, John turned his back to Sherlock, pulling the door shut behind him.
Trigger Warning:
“Oh god. Yes!” John hissed, lifting his head and pushing against Sherlock’s mouth with earnest desire, “deeper, come on, I can take it.” To prove his point, John pivoted his hips, pushing hard against Sherlock’s finger. The result was spectacular, Sherlock’s long finger seated inside him as deep as it could go. He could feel Sherlock’s other digits twitching against his arse, could hear the sharp intake of breath as Sherlock registered what had just happened.
Sherlock smirked, watching her eyes shift from John to the tea, then back to the corner of John’s mouth, where crumbs from a biscuit he’d snagged while in the kitchen still clung to his skin.
They were just heading out to put Sherlock's cockamamie plan into action when Sherlock received an update from his brother. Scanning the email sent by Anthea, his brother's PA, Sherlock couldn’t help but feel frustrated.
“Just a little one.” She giggled and began fiddling with the veil, pulling it down over her face giggling when it puffed up from her breath.
Just something tasty to make up for that angsty ending!
“You tell me. You and Daddy were watching the radar this morning. Was it a big cloud or little cloud?”
“I know, my love,” Sherlock said softly, stepping close and soothing his hands along John’s arms. “But we have people counting on us.”
The sound of the device powering on filled the room as Sherlock tried to figure out how to kneel in his position. I wanted to voice his need, but he remembered the order to stay quiet. Figuring out the answer to a problem wasn’t considered an emergency. After a moment of trying to picture where his chair was, and if he could brace his elbow on the armrest for balance, John sniffed.
"He has maybe an inch on me, two at most?" John said, doing his best to formulate an accurate description, "Maybe in his fifties, receding hairline with a close shave. I think his hair is either brown or black. With the club's lighting, his eyes looked black, so I’d say he has brown eyes, but dark blue is also a possibility. But he's got this tattoo on his right arm. It’s a big black inked Kraken. Shouldn't be hard to miss if she looks along the side of the bar during the time Sherlock and I were there."
“You got the GPS tracker in place?” Zed asked hopefully as he stared down the road after the van.
“Oh yes, Sir. It
“No hospitals,” John agreed gently, but quickly amended his promise, “as long as the tests come back on this vial, and show it wasn’t laced with anything, or you don’t start having seizures on me.”
“Mmm.” Zed hummed around a swig of pop.
“You do,” John pointed out,  “Plus, I don’t need to explain anything, nor make excuses for either of us. We are both consenting adults of sound mind and body. No one is being exploited, hurt, or taken advantage of. His level of concern over your sex life is disturbing, and frankly, I have half a mind give my sister his phone number.”
Humiliation had been enjoyable in his younger years. However, Uni had changed that for him. The never-ending chorus of
After completing his first task Sherlock positioned himself a few paces away. Spreading his feet he laced his fingers together and placed them behind his neck. He met John’s gaze and felt a shiver run down his spine at the look John gave him. His eyes had shifted from blue to cobalt, his pupils were dilated, and as he watched a wicked grin took over John’s face.
“Though… this whole lifestyle is interesting. I might have questions, when all this is over. You all are at such ease with your sexuality. I can’t help but wonder if I’ve been too sheltered my whole life.”
“Nothing, well. Not nothing. I’m beginning to remember last night, just flashes.” Sherlock said with a shake of his head, knowing John would be looking for any adverse physical reactions the drugs might have caused.
“Oh, I’m sorry… I just assumed…” Sherlock stopped, not sure what it was he’d assumed.
(I'm not actually sorry)
“I have to confess that I feel the same way. Every moment apart is abhorrently dull.” Sherlock admitted in a low sigh, sinking down for another kiss. “Dinner?” He asked softly a moment later as a timer behind them began its annoying claxon.
“Better your neck than my pillow.”
After a moment's deliberation, Sherlock settled on John’s shirt. Long elegant fingers plucked at the button just below his chin. John sighed with pleasure when Sherlock’s fingers brushed his bare skin, leaving a burning wake in the absence, begging for more.
He leaned down and pressed a trail of kisses over the raw mark.
"When you said warm, I wasn't expecting pizza oven hot," John said, voice muffled by the jumper temporarily trapped over his face. Once he pulled the garment off, he took his case back and looked around. While there was never much to see directly outside an airport, the palm trees were enough to inform him he was no longer in London. Or England, for that matter.
“I’m going to meet up with Sherlock if he’ll bloody answer me,” John grumbled, glaring at the distinct lack of messages from his partner. “I can catch a cab if you’ve got things to do.”
John didn’t dignify the question with a response. Instead, he stood up and went back to the bar, ordering himself another beer and a whisky for Sherlock. Weaving through the small crowd of people, he made it back to the booth and placed the whisky on the table across from him. Sherlock made him wait until half his beer was gone before strolling up to the table.
“I understand, and that is fair.” Sherlock nodded enthusiastically and sighed in relief. “Thank you, John.”
Sherlock stood before him, bathed in the light from the hall, and held his hands out. While very similar to the last outfit Sherlock had worn, this one took the cake. It was a honeycomb fishnet bodysuit, that was more
“So… nothing like in the pornos? No welts, or blood, or…”
“Right, so you’ve asked for me to test your obedience. As if that wasn’t enough, you want me to deny you release until I deem fit. Nod once if you still want that.”
The longer he stayed up and watched Sherlock work, the more dangerous blinking became. Eventually, his sluggish eyelids threatened to remain closed for good. Sighing, he stood and walked around the table, crossing to where Sherlock sat hunched over a powder blue laptop bedazzled with stickers of whoever the latest k-pop band was. He placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and leaned in close.
At his words, something in Mycroft’s face changed. Mycroft’s expression melted out of its usual mask of vague and threatening indifference to something of genuine surprise to all appearances. While that look only predominated his features for a fraction of a second, it had been unmistakable.
“Nice to see you, Zed,” Matt said, passing out bottles of what John at first thought was a dark ale, to his surprise, was homemade root beer. “But your text implied you’re here for a reason, not a social call.”
“Yes, Sir,” Sherlock said with a dip of his head. He felt John’s eyes on him as he turned towards the closet where the dog tags hung on a hook. After collecting the tags and his cuffs, he returned to John and lowered himself to his knees. Holding both hands out, offering up his possessions, he lowered his head in submission.
"Oh? Are you giving me the others?" John smirked while remaining completely still inside Sherlock.
“My love, what have I told you?” John prodded while tracing the line of Sherlock’s vein with a soft touch.
“You finally painted her!” John exclaimed, then let out a low whistle. “She’s no longer that horrid burgundy color.”
“Then we need to get you a proper suit so I can be similarly affected. Not that this,” Sherlock gestured at John’s outfit, “is an eyesore.”
“Sorry, Gents, but no bodily fluids in my cab, please. Just tell me where you need to be, and I’ll get you there post-haste.”
I have a few smaller ficlets coming up soon, so feel free to subscribe to my ao3 account if you're interested in that. I might take the month of June off from writing a big fanfic, because I have an original children's story that requires my attention.
“You’ve smudged your makeup.” Licking his thumb John reached over and brushed it against the underside of Sherlock’s eyes smoothing out the black eyeliner. “There, that’s better.”
“Oh?” John turned to face Sherlock while reaching for his trousers, “A case? Something for me to poke around in?”
“Save it for them,” Greg said with a nod of agreement.
more. It’s the hint of danger I seek, not the pain itself. Light choking can be enjoyable. Suspension has always intrigued me. I enjoy cold but less so hot. Restraints are fine, as long as they’re done correctly. I had the misfortune of dealing with an amateur who managed to hit every nerve on my legs.” Sherlock ran a hand down his thigh, remembering the tight bite of coarse rope as it hit his pressure points.
“No, never. Are you
With a plan in motion, and Bondage Tour made as secure as physically possible John felt they were well on their way to stopping Moriarty. Mycroft had been silent, which was expected. But Sherlock did the exact opposite from what Mycroft had warned John about.
He became a softer version of himself as if the bolts of fabrics and tailored suits somehow absorbed the rough edges in Sherlock’s personality. It also surprised him at just how many shop owners knew Sherlock by name, knew his measurements without consulting a computer and knew exactly what he liked. As for himself, John found that he was a challenge for even Sherlock’s most qualified tailor. No one seemed able to settle on a style for him.
“Can you fuck me and stroke my cock at the same time?” Sherlock asked, the corners of his lips turning up into a smile, “I like it better when you do it.”
"First," Sherlock said, taking off his coat. He tossed it over the back of one of the chairs and faced Lestrade, "John and I are dating. I believe this means you've won the interoffice pool? Secondly, John is my Dom and I his submissive," Sherlock rolled up the cuff of his right sleeve and flashed the bracelet in Greg's direction. "Say what you will to your men, but be aware that any future surprise drug busts have the potential to discover me naked and bound in various positions across the flat. We would appreciate the decency of at least a knock going forward."
“Is that drink for anyone, in particular,
“Mm, of course. I have a few tricks up my sleeve, but we’ll get there. Before that, I need to hear you say you agree that this first week will be for training.”
“Definitely.”
“And you created a mental grocery list?” Sherlock guffawed.
“It would take hours to sit here and list what I
“That can be arranged, Sherlock is bound to roll his eyes at me again in the future. It’s inevitable,” Laughing, John did up the zip on his trousers and winked at her. “On your feet Sherlock, you don’t get to suck my cock just yet.”
“Subtlety alert my dom to my discomfort,” Lydia replied quickly.
“Ah, so I’m just an alternative to you getting high,” John said, but his words were teasing and his smile genuine as he rose from his chair.
“So, this
John wondered, deciding to err on the side of caution. If this were for a case, he didn’t want to blow Sherlock’s cover. While on the other hand, if Sherlock was being genuine, he didn’t want to spook him.
“I also don’t expect you to remain locked at all times. But, again, this all comes down to communication. We’ll need to go over privacy expectations, and we’ll have to decide if we tell Mrs. Hudson or not.”
“Ha!” John half snorted. The very thought of Sherlock Holmes not going out of his way to cause trouble filled him with the sudden urge to slap his knee and laugh at the top of his lungs.
Sherlock picked his head up and scowled at the door, then glanced over at the clock.
“Busy,” is all Sherlock said as he carried two boxes out at once, “I trust him to call if it’s important.”
Having said his bit, John crossed his arms and leaned his shoulders against the window. He tried not to glare too hard at Mycroft, knowing that somewhere deep inside the three-piece suit, there was a heart that actually cared and thought he was doing what was best. But it was time for Mycroft to realize that Sherlock was not a child and capable of having control of his own life. Not only that, though far less critical, he was sick of Mycroft’s vague threats and passive-aggressive behaviour towards him.
“Term for bottoms who enjoy being tied up. I’d be your rigger. Rope slut is another term, but Zed knows better than to call other Dom’s subs sluts without permission. Ready?”
“John’s put a collar on it,” Zed quipped, which made Elvio and Matt raise their eyebrows in unison.
“Right, sorry. Yes.” John scrubbed a hand over his face and flashed Sherlock a sheepish grin. “Didn’t realize I was so obvious,” John murmured, then twisted his torso against the back of the seat, facing Sherlock as best as the buckle would allow. “Just to clarify, you weren’t at Lotus for a case. Correct?”
“We currently know they want you. While we’re certain you aren’t their only target, you are the only target we know about. Thus, we’re able to control the situation a bit more than with a random grab.”
“You already look like less of a skeleton.” John sighed, pressing a soft kiss on a soft spot of skin just above Sherlock’s collar.
“Full time, I see,” Zed said, eyeing the collar around Sherlock’s neck then looking over at John with a knowing smile. “Past training as well, judging by his collar.”
“Headache?” John asked quickly.
Sherlock spun in a small circle then, when he faced John again, smirked and lifted the front of his leather skirt.
“What happened after John and I left?” Sherlock asked, raising an eyebrow at Zed’s admission.
Sherlock thought as he settled in, intent on listening to every word that passed between his Dominant and his rude older brother.
“White, please,” John flashed her his teeth, then stroked a hand down Sherlock’s back, letting his fingers dip just below his waistline.
“No, we don’t keep that sort of information,” Paige said apologetically. Sherlock glanced over at her and fought the urge to scowl. His pacing had caused Paige to turn her gaze to John rather than track his moving form across the room.
Hopefully, I'll be back soon with another multi-month, multi-chapter fanfic. But I need a bit of time to recharge and think of an idea. I have one churning in the back of my head, but it needs a bit of planning before I let it see the light of day.
“We just went to the shops.” John groaned, scratching the back of his neck as he closed the refrigerator door for the fourth time. “Yet, everything is gone, and not because it spoiled, and I had to throw it out.” Continuing to scratch the back of his neck, John gave a slight shrug and furrowed his brows. Thanks to their agreement, Sherlock was eating more, but still, it felt as if they’d gone through an awful lot of food for just seven days.
“I’ll be here,” John assured him, bringing Sherlock’s hand up to his lips he kissed each knuckle before lowering their joined hands back to his lap.
“Flatmates. Friends.” John answered quickly, waving one hand in the air dismissively. “He’s not the sort to go in for more. I asked, our first night together, he shut me down rather quickly.”
her, though.” John’s voice cracked; picking up a stack of more recent, less yellowed papers, he wiped the corner of his eyes on his shoulder. “I wrote these to her when I got accepted to med school, then when I enlisted. I just wanted her to be proud of me.”
“Denial. Bring me to the edge, then hold me there. I need to shut my mind off completely if I have any hope of making sense of everything.” Sherlock said while creating a separate pile for John’s clothes.
“John?” Sherlock asked, his voice tight as he swallowed hard.
"I selected my outfit around that," Sherlock spoke up while bumping his hip against John's side. "I don't think that was a pepperoni stick he was smuggling in his trousers on the way here. I just can’t decide what turns him on more. My pants, or the skirt."
“Yes, Sir,” Sherlock said, gasping for air. He hadn’t expected that, hadn’t been fully prepared at the time. John gave him another second to suck in a breath then his hand was once again guiding Sherlock’s head back down on his cock.
While unpacking the groceries, John relayed the highlights of his chat with Mycroft. Sherlock stood silently in the doorway, eyebrows furrowed and fingering his collar while he listened. John shrugged when he finished, and with a sigh, added, “He does realize everything he says to me
Sherlock felt the forgotten needle slide out of his skin, then heard it clatter to the floor somewhere on the other side of the room.
They were both dressed in black. Rosie was dressed in a sharp dress with shiny black shoes. They even had a little faux heel that clicked against the floor as she walked. John had even gotten her a hat with a black veil to pull over her face. Sherlock had upgraded his usual suit to one with a slightly different cut. It was the one he wore to family gatherings or weddings. But today, instead of celebrating the life yet to come, they would be celebrating a life well-lived.
He had found out the hard way years ago when he confessed to his boyfriend of six months that he wanted to try BDSM. Victor had, at first, been willing for Sherlock’s sake. But when Sherlock found how his body responded to subspace, he had wanted more. He’d both pushed Victor beyond his comfort zone and had begun drifting from the drugs that had brought them together. The breakup was messy; it had left a void in Sherlock’s life he hadn’t expected. He dove headfirst into stronger drugs, more potent than the marijuana he and Victor had dabbled with.
personal weapons but another sidearm and three smoke bombs each. They each had been given a gas mask, which now hung loosely around their necks, and flack vests on over their clothing. The ride to the strip mall was tense, but no one attempted to make small talk. John, Greg, and the four other men in the van were the last team to go in. John was aware that Mycroft had designed it that way on purpose. Keeping John out of the first volley, while not holding him back entirely.
Sherlock glanced up at John when he finally made it back to the flat. He watched as John placed his armful of bags down on the worktop, but said nothing. If he knew John had just been talking with Mycroft, he said nothing. Mycroft had warned him that he tended to press his lips together when stressed, so John made every effort to keep his face relaxed as his partner watched him put the shopping away.
“How long ago was this?” John questioned, doing his best to keep the edge of his growing rage from showing in his voice.
“Fine, we’ll take two suits as well, and a wardrobe of casual wear for him. No rush on those. Blues and greens especially, but I trust your pallet.”
For the next two hours, John does his best to ignore Sherlock’s frantic pacing. While he shares the feeling of unrest that often comes with missing information, they can do little until Mycroft found something useful for them. Afraid that Sherlock would wear out the floor and unsure if Sherlock would be up for a trip upstairs, John thought hard to devise a way to calm Sherlock down.
“John…” Sherlock began, and John saw the doubt creeping back over his face.
“Right,” John grunted while clearing his throat uncomfortably, “so we have to be nice to each other now?”
“I could say something about you being a cock tease, but… God, you’ve just found my prostate.” John moaned through a lazy smile.
“Yeah, that’s a good one.” John agreed, writing that below the others. “It’s important we both understand that right now, these are just suggestions. If we get to the end of this first week and want to continue, we’ll go over them again, revising them as needed.”
Now that there was no risk of waking Sherlock up, he gave in to the desire to touch Sherlock. Sherlock’s cheek was soft beneath his touch, and warmth radiated through his fingers as he stroked along Sherlock’s cheekbone. Sherlock’s intense gaze went lax, and then his eyes fluttered shut, and a low rumble rose out of Sherlock’s chest.
Soon the empty space around the grave filled up. Friends and family alike gathered side by side to celebrate a wonderful woman. Even Mrs Hudson’s nephew Jaxson had flown in from Germany for the funeral. Everyone had something to say, a story or a memory. And though it took well over their allotted hour, they continued to share until John stepped forward and cleared his throat.
"Yeah, love. It's me." John murmured, as he withdrew his hand and closed the knife before he hurt himself or Sherlock with his trembling.
When Zed did one of his demonstrations, he preferred being close to his guests, so he did his performances on the floor rather than the stage. He’d once claimed it gave everything a more personal touch, rather than putting on a show for pure sport. He’d designed the club not to be a sleazy sex club, but to be an educational hotspot where people could come and learn. Sex wasn’t allowed on-premise, nor was exposing one’s body tolerated. Clothing had to cover the bits at least, and anything beyond showing off your skills was expected to be taken elsewhere. John had used the motel just down the street on more than one occasion after an evening here turned fruitful.
“What else?” Sherlock prompted. He needed to know John understood why they were doing this. When they got to Lotus, he needed John to have a clear head, not fretting over the whys and hows.
achieve subspace without an orgasm, though it is difficult to find a Dom willing to lend aid to that end.”
“Jelly Baby.”
“You swallow? Oh god,” John said in a deep growl. He grabbed a handful of Sherlock’s hair in his left hand and pulled Sherlock’s face back towards his cock. John wiped the smug smile of satisfaction off of Sherlock’s face by pressing his head against Sherlock’s lips. In a gravelly voice, he commanded, “Suck me off, and swallow every drop.”
Kidnapping
John’s eyes drifted over to the hook that held Sherlock’s scarf and coat. It would be one thing to have Sherlock wear his collar
At first, John only felt a wave of defensive energy wash over him. He wanted to shout at Mycroft, to ask him if it was so hard to consider that Sherlock would talk to him.
“Not at all. I can get in and out faster if I don’t have to stop you from causing an argument every ten seconds.” Smiling fondly at his partner John stroked his index finger down the length of Sherlock’s nose then stole a final kiss. “Right,” he muttered, resigning himself to his errand before Sherlock’s soft sigh broke his resolve.
“Alright with people touching you?” He asked quietly.
“I don’t lick my lips,” John furrowed his brow but caught himself
“You’re going to do that anyways,” Sherlock pointed out.
“Right…” John sucked in a deep breath and squared his shoulders. “Let’s get this over with.”
“You’re not going to magically conjure food by sheer force of will by opening and closing the fridge. The facts tell us that at least one of us needs to go to the shops.” Sherlock muttered, not looking up from his microscope. After their morning spent in John’s old bedroom, Sherlock had been fidgety but had wrinkled his nose when John suggested he call Greg. This is why he now sat, in ratty cotton pyjamas, hunched over his microscope, bare toes twitching against the cold kitchen floor.
John reached for the flannel, then made short work of cleaning the worst of the lube off of him. Once he was clean, he tossed the flannel to the floor and wiggled his way around the bed until his head was resting on one of the pillows.
“Sit.” He commanded. He didn’t project his voice, but the room had hushed in anticipation. Someone had turned the music down to a distant hum, a beat that pulsed with Sherlock’s heart as he sat, keeping his eyes trained on John’s face. “Palms up, hands on your thighs.”
“Right.” Greg intoned as he followed after John. Together they kick in their first door. Scared brown eyes look up at them as they step inside and a young girl with dark hair scurries into the corner of her room, dragging a blanket up over her chest to hide her near nakedness.
“When will you use it?” John asked while walking a slow circle around Sherlock. Once he stopped to nudge Sherlock’s legs apart with the crop, but otherwise, Sherlock’s form was excellent.
Sherlock thought momentarily before realizing that was exactly what he was doing to John.
“Genius, specializing in analyzing human behaviours.” Zed grinned, waving both of the attempts at an apology and glancing down at his cuticles. “I’ve been following your work, Mr. Holmes. It’s quite fascinating to see in person.”
that followed his every footstep had made a once pleasant kink turn into a dark shadow over his life. Then there was the matter of his ever-present, oppressing older brother who had court-ordered monthly drug tests.
“Easy love, I promise we’ll get there,” John said between pressing soft kisses to the tip of Sherlock’s cock. “I promise.”
“John…” Sherlock gasped as John closed in around him, one hand planted on the wall beside his left shoulder.
“What was that all about?” Sherlock asked as he curled his arms around John’s shoulders, holding tight.
Their tongues met in a wet clash of writhing muscles. John vaguely heard Sherlock pop the cover off the bottle, and when a slick finger slid across his perineum and across his hole, he shivered against Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock’s whole world is thrown upside down in an instant. The cocaine, his once sought after friend, turned against him. Instead of pleasure coursing through him, that high you get when you scratch a lottery ticket and find you’ve won, all he felt was panic. Everything he’d worked for since his release from rehab lay shattered on the floor of his prison, ground into the grit beneath his captor’s boots. Trampled over like one might squash an insect.
His good mood lasted a grand total of three hundred paces. John became aware of a black town car keeping pace with him a few buildings down from the flat. Without looking, he flashed the tinted windows a one-finger salute and muttered, “Fuck off, Mycroft,” and continued walking. Unsurprisingly the car didn’t drive away. Instead, it followed directly beside him, holding up the sparse traffic behind it. A taxi honked, and the driver stuck his head out of his car, shouting what John could only guess to be a string of profanity in his native language.
“Right, I was going to suggest we dance, but fuck that. Finish your drink, and that’s an order.” John replied, then finished the remainder of his beer in one swallow.
“With this bracelet, I thee lock.” a delighted smile lit up John’s face as maneuvered the clasp closed, and with the key provided, locked it securely in place. “We’ll get a chain for this key, and I’ll keep it on me at all times. For tonight, I’ll leave it home, so it doesn’t get lost.”
I'll post another chapter sometime next weekend :)
“Let us hope it doesn’t come to that.” Mycroft snorted, though the smile on his face told Sherlock that perhaps his brother had gone through a change of heart regarding their kink. “This,” he said while pulling a single sheet of paper from his breast pocket, “is the analytic report on that vial Doctor Watson recovered, it was laced with a psychoactive agent, so please take care.”
Sherlock stopped pacing and sat back down beside John, placing his hand on John’s thigh.
"She still runs security for you then?" John asked innocently.
John couldn’t bring himself to meet Greg’s eyes. He didn’t want to see the concern he knew would be there. Greg had seen Sherlock on drugs, and considering how close he and the detective had come, it was likely he knew just how hard it had been for Sherlock to remain clean directly out of rehab. Had there been a relapse, or two? John couldn’t bring himself to ask. First things first, find Sherlock, then deal with withdrawals and recovery.
“Are you certain you can handle me?” He asked, his voice smoldering with need and the desire to hear John cry out his name in ecstasy.  “I intend to bring you to your knees with my efforts.”
“Well, to answer that, I have to warn you, a friend of mine is meeting me here. She just got held up a few blocks over. I told her I’d come up and give you two the heads up.”
Who wants to make a bet I forget one of my original Characters? *nervous glance*
Shrugging out of his coat, suddenly too hot despite the lack of fire burning in the hearth, Sherlock pulled on his collar, the one he hadn’t had the courage to ask John to remove. He suddenly felt claustrophobic, the reminder of John's claim on him felt like an iron grip around his neck, while the leather band on his wrist felt like brimstone.
“When do you go in for snorting?” The Snake asked. He kept his face in the shadows, but Sherlock imagined he could see the greed in his eyes at earning an extra sale.
“So, tell me,” Zed said after they'd maneuvered through the throng of people, and he'd pushed a beer into his hands.
“Oh Christ,” John shook his head and pushed the thought out of his mind before he realized just how plausible that was. Turning his mind back to the task at hand, he reached an arm around Sherlock’s side. He had to bend forward a bit but managed to get his hands around Sherlock’s cock at the same time he pushed back inside. They both moaned in unison, their combined notes of pleasure wrapping around the base of Sherlock’s spine.
“I’ll make tea,” John announced once everyone is settled, Zed and Paige on the sofa while Sherlock perches on the end of one of the wooden chairs. “Then, if you’re willing, you can tell us your story, Ms. Bevan?”
using his own wits.
“So, if I misbehave this week, you could put me in chastity?” Sherlock asked, reading over the list of punishments. “What if I
“It was a motivator, yes,” Sherlock admitted, “Though it doesn’t make it any less true.”
"I owe John a round of drinks," Lestrade said with an amused shake of his head. "This is a far cry from fresh out of rehab Sherlock breaking onto my crime scenes."
“It’s mainly stuff that’s only special to me. But, I’d rather show you now instead of wondering when your curiosity will get the best of you.” He lifted the cover off, placing it on the coffee table beside the box. They both looked inside, John with a fond smile and Sherlock with wide eyes.
"As I thought, we can work with that. My driver here will do your shopping while I go over my plan. Sherlock mustn’t get wind of this conversation."
“Would Sir like to lay down for a moment?” Sherlock asked, attempting to dispel John’s temper, well earned as it was.
“Because it's new.”
Mycroft’s eyebrows rose, his forehead wrinkling in the effort. As if the thought of Sherlock divulging information about his past was so farfetched to be unthinkable.
"You didn't bring any bondage equipment," John wheezed around his fit of laughter.
After shaking off his umbrella, John slid into the back seat and found himself sitting beside Mycroft Holmes. Aside from the driver, they were alone in the car, which instantly made John clench his teeth.
“I’m sorry?”
“Put some damned socks on!” John hissed while reaching down and taking one of Sherlock’s cold feet into his warm hands.
Chinatown, as always, was a bustling hub of activity when Greg’s car came to a stop. They parked in front of a shop, the kind of touristy trap shop that sells nothing of actual use. Sherlock can tell by the way John’s body has gone tense that it reminds him of the smuggling ring they’d broken up not that long ago. He knows that John still harbors a small amount of guilt over Soo Lin’s death, and he can’t imagine it’s easy being back here so soon. Leaning back into the car, he softened his voice and called John’s name to get his attention.
“Greg, you just need to promise me one thing,” John asked in a nervous voice. He’d worked hard to blend back into civilian life after returning home. He wasn’t a killer, not by any stretch of the imagination, but nor would he allow the men who took Sherlock to walk away free. If Greg had to watch him put a bullet through a few skulls tonight, he didn’t want to lose his friend.
“Mmhmm.” Sherlock hummed. Then, as if the space between them was physically painful, he hurried across the gap and placed his head on the corner of John’s pillow. His eyes were open now and regarded him with an alertness that John could only wish he had moments after waking up. They flashed, multi-colored in the daylight, an equal mix of silver, blues, and greens.
Using both hands now, John guided Sherlock’s head up and down along his length. Sherlock held his mouth open and did his best to apply his tongue when he was able. John would hold Sherlock in place until the detective was obliged to raise a hand and tap John’s leg. They repeated this half a dozen times until John let out a low growl of warning. John’s body stiffened, and his hands pulled Sherlock’s face flush with his groin. John’s voice came out in a rough moan as hot spurts of come hit the back of Sherlock’s throat. He was ready for it, though, and swallowed around the intrusion.
Friday morning was both stressful and busy. For nearly an hour John tolerated Jesper and his assistant fussing over every last detail of his outfit. When they were done, and he was allowed to look at himself in the mirror, he had to admit that it had been worth it. The outfit fit him like a glove and the shirt clung to him in all the right places. It highlighted the few muscles he had left from his army days and somehow made his chest seem fuller, giving his appearance a bit of a boost. No longer was he a slight man in a bulky jumper, but a main coiled and ready to strike at a moments notice.
“Uh, Sherlock,” John said, fishing in his pocket for the small silver key. He held it up with an amused smile. He loved that Sherlock, countless times a day, forgot that he wore John’s collar. “Com’ere first.”
“Sherlock,” John repeated, but this time his voice cracked, and his face softened. Emotion made his eyes well up with tears, but they never fell. Sherlock smiled gently and continued.
“I’ll keep that in mind. Go shower while I scrounge up something edible. I can’t wait to run my hands through your hair when it isn’t coated in a crunchy gel.” Standing, John lifted his arms above his head and grunted while stretching out the kinks in his muscles. He was about to reach for his clothes from last night when Sherlock tapped him on the hip with one of his toes.
"Mycroft was a bit miffed we didn't go with one of the family estates for our holiday," Sherlock laughed as they pulled up to their home for the next week. "Remind me to send him pictures; he’s going to hate it."
“I understand that can’t always happen, especially if we’re out on a case. But feel free to summarize it as
John thought as he released his grip and held out a hand to help Sherlock back to his feet.
“Her name?” Sherlock asked, already sorting through the list of cases Lestrade had worked on over the past six months.
“Yes, and last week all you picked out was gingernuts and hundreds and thousands biscuits. I still don’t know what you’ll
His reflection had no answer, so with a soft sigh, he headed back into the kitchen to put the finishing touches on the meal.
Sherlock divested himself of his clothing in what seemed like mere seconds while still managing to place them neatly over the back of the chair. Sherlock procured lube and a condom from the side table without wasting much time, then returned to hovering over John on the bed.
“After what happened to you at Soo Lin’s, Sherlock,” he continued, seeing the frown on Sherlock’s face, “We take Greg. Especially as she hasn’t reached out to her friends in nearly six months. Who knows what’s waiting for us there.”
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock whispered to the cold grey stone. It was a far cry from the warm and vibrant lady she’d been. Beautifully engraved, with words declaring her a beloved sister, but a far cry from the life she’d once lived.
“That’s all?” Sherlock asked.
The words were hardly out of Sherlock’s mouth before John pulled Sherlock onto his chest and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders. He buried his nose into Sherlock’s hair and pressed a firm kiss to his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tapping the earpiece in his left ear Greg gave John a gentle smile. “Plus I’ll be your inside connection to Mycroft. If anything happens, he’ll tell me.”
“Flattery will get you everywhere.” John purred, running his hand reverently over the pocket square like it was a long-lost friend. “It’s a shame we won't be matching tonight,” he said, glancing from the splash of red to Sherlock’s collar. “But I want you in your new collar tonight. You’ve earned it.”
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock shouted from the bathroom. Despite the volume, his tone was humorous, if not a bit harried. “Leave the man alone! Or I’ll mention where you were last night.”
this pair did the exact opposite. An opening in the front allowed for Sherlock’s cock and balls to simply hang free. As Sherlock turned for a second time, John saw that there was a similar opening in the back. “It’s for fucking on the go.”
need to go to the shops. I’m going to go get dressed,” John said, glancing down at his pyjamas, “and head out before they get busy. Do you want to join me?”
"Florida isn't known for its tepid weather, John. Come on, let's get a taxi. Even I require shorts."
“You heard him. If we want to put an end to this, I need to go. Alone.” Sherlock sighed as he nuzzled his face into the crook of John’s neck.
“Fair enough,” John grinned as he neared his detective. “Now, when can I see upstairs?”
They lapsed into silence, and John contented himself with pouring every ounce of care and affection he could into his touches. John thought Sherlock had drifted back off to sleep when his voice, muffled by John’s collar bone, said, “What are the chances my Captain wants to spoil me with breakfast in bed? To show me how much he truly cares, of course.”
“Yeah, they have him. They injected him with whatever was in this.” John said gruffly as he handed over the handkerchief-wrapped syringe. “We should analyze the contents and check it for fingerprints. The guy wasn’t wearing gloves. He said something about a seven percent solution, so I think it’s cocaine.”
“Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?” John asked, getting straight to the point and hoping he wouldn’t come across as being rude.
“Oh? Comments from the peanut gallery?” John asked while Lydia lowered one of his two zippers. A corner of the fabric fell forward, revealing a patch of trimmed hair. “Speak up, Sherlock.”
“John, I don’t want this,” Sherlock gasped as he released his grip on his legs and wound them around John’s back instead. “I don’t want to be a slave to my addiction again. I don’t want to lose everything I’ve worked for. I don’t want to lose you, because I know you’ll leave me… You’re going to leave me. Oh, god, John. Please stay.”
“Yeah, I want you,” Sherlock said while turning into John’s embrace. “Oh god, yes.”
“You don’t mind if I stay?” Sherlock asked, tilting his face up, meeting John’s lips with his.
He caught sight of his reflection in the mirror on his way out and paused. He traced the length of scarlet rope around his neck with one finger. Worried that a client might show up, John had left the key to the collar on top of his laptop with the stipulation that if Sherlock required it, he was to send a text.
“Speaking of control,” John said after choking down a bubble of laughter, “We’ll have to ring up Paige and then Matt and Elvio. Tell them the news. Zed too. Unless you’ve spoken with them.”
“Attachment…” with a sigh, Sherlock forced his eyes open. John saw something profoundly sad darken his face. “Attachment, sentiment… they’ve never been an advantage for me. I’ve been used by more than one dom. I’m aware of how people see me, John, sexy and exotic. More than once have I been used for my body.”
“I know, Mycroft.” John winced and ground his teeth together. “He’s been clean for a while now, and this is going to rekindle the cravings. I’ll help him through it, I promise.”
"Jesus," John growled out protectively, the bruise had darkened in colour, bits of it turning green where the buckle from Sherlock’s collar had dug in. "I should have shot that man."
“Any orders, Sir?”
The bar was just to his left. It was a large oak affair with half a dozen stools lined up for punters.  Two college-aged girls and one guy a few years older worked in perfect harmony as they fulfilled orders. Against the left-hand wall, just beyond the bar, was a short row of plush booths. In the center of the room was a raised dance floor, while straight ahead, along the right-hand wall, was the main event.
“Hello, first time?” Her voice was like honey trickling down John’s spine. Green eyes flashed mischievously as she propped an elbow on the podium and leaned forward, pressing into John’s personal space.
“Show me,” John demanded, dropping his hand to rest against the side of his thigh.
“And they call me the genius,” Sherlock gasped out while clinging to John for support. “Take me to bed, Husband.
“Zip now, please. I think we’ve all seen enough of your penis. Then up against the wall, hands above your head.”
“It appears we need to talk, and I would prefer to do that in private. What do you say, we enjoy our drinks, you get us a cab, and we go home. We’ll place all our cards on the table, and then we see where this takes us?” John’s voice was firm, though he couldn’t help hide the way his voice shook towards the end as he thought about
Sherlock nearly opened his mouth to speak but clamped it closed again and simply nodded his head twice.
Sherlock stood quickly, nearly knocking his chair backward with this haste. He needed more information. Multiple people missing from different locations. Some missing on the same night. He needed eyes and ears on the ground, in places he couldn't be at the same time. And he had just the network full of people who could help.  Grabbing his coat from the back of his chair he pulls it on, the tails flapping in the air behind him as he moved across the room with newfound purpose.  His scarf fluttered to the ground, as he picked it up he turned to John, wrapping the blue fabric around his neck.
“No, let me finish, please?” Sherlock asked, continuing when John gave a small nod of assent. “You view your scar as a burden, a mark against your manliness. When I saw it last night, I didn’t think, ‘
“Still misquoting cheesy movies, I see, John,” Zed said around a smile, so vast John wondered if Zed was at risk of swallowing a bug.
“Friday night, there was this bloke who made a pass at Sherlock,” John explained through pursed lips. He ran his palms against his trousers then continued, “Then last night, he watched us nearly the entire time we were dancing. Only, he wasn’t watching
Sherlock walked into Scotland Yard with commanding grace. He brushed past reception, hardly acknowledging the young PC who stopped him long enough to pass over the visitor's badge that held permanent residents at the welcome desk.
are involved in the investigation. If you would be so kind to direct us to her personal effects. The things she left behind, that would
“Go be useless somewhere else,” Sherlock snapped, dismissing the man with a flick of his hand. Happy for an excuse to leave Hicks gave a single shrug then waddled off to his computer, no doubt to lose another fifty quid.
“Right, his description,” John said, pulling himself from the past and back to the present.
“Yeah, but I’m your git, and you love it.” John continued teasingly, his hand drifting lower down Sherlock’s torso until he found Sherlock’s belt. “I’ll help you remember how to remove clothing,” he suggested, working the buckle open and sliding it from around Sherlock’s waist. He let it drop to the floor with a thud, then placed his hands on his hips and pursed his lips. “Are you going to just stand there, or are you going to do something?”
“You ignored him,” Sherlock said with incredulity. “No one ignores Mycroft.
“The part where Moriarty will probably be there, watching you orgasm,” John growled out as he stuck his finger into the bottom half of the exposed pipe.
“Good,” John stepped forward and gave Sherlock’s jaw a brief caress. “Close your eyes, keep them closed until I tell you to open them.”
“That will be her,” Sherlock announced. “The sofa, then, Zed.” Gesturing towards the sofa, Sherlock stood and straightened his jacket. In a matter of seconds, he has the coffee table pulled aside, the space replaced with the two wooden chairs from the table. Moving as if running through a well-practiced dance, John and Sherlock work around each other, never once breaking pace until the frame of a small lady in her middle years graces their door.
“Oh please, continue to fight. Only gets me even harder,” the man said with a laugh as his grip tightened painfully.
“You haven't changed,” John laughed at his old friend. While ten years his senior,  Zed had taken him under his wing back during his university days. He’d taught John everything he knew, including how to be a patient and caring Dom.
“I think I’m ready, and by the looks of things, so are you,” John said, eyeing Sherlock’s glistening cock. Precome oozed from the slit, informing John of just how excited Sherlock was, to already be dripping without any form of touch.
“Taking your age and health into account, I would estimate your refractory period to be somewhere between seventeen and twenty-two minutes. Meaning, if you orgasm now, you can spend the next twenty or so minutes punishing me for my subordinate behaviour, then before you know it, you’ll be ready to go again.” Sherlock drawled, sounding bored like he was reading from a textbook, though there was a glimmer of something John couldn’t quite deduce in his eyes.
“Being submissive allows me an outlet. Instead of focusing on the useless data before me, my subconscious is focused on my surroundings. Waiting for my next command. It helps me apply order to my chaotic mind, gives me the ability to cast out the useless data and only focus on what matters.” With careful eyes, Sherlock watched John as he absorbed that bit of information. He knew from experience that it was one thing to tell a partner
John looked up just as someone knocked on the hall door. Cursing under his breath, he tossed the notepad onto the coffee table and asked, “How long has he been standing there?” wondering how much Sherlock’s brother had overheard.
John spent the entirety of his shift on Wednesday wondering what Sherlock was up to back home. When he’d kissed a still mostly sleeping Sherlock goodbye that morning, he hadn’t then realized that Sherlock hadn’t been joking about the sex attic.
“Yes, Master Zed.” the man said, bowing low to the ground before scurrying off.
While Sherlock obeyed, John again slid behind him, attaching the final spreader bar to the cuffs on Sherlock’s ankles. He said nothing for a long time, though Sherlock could hear his soft breathing just to his right. Sherlock’s ears tracked John’s movements around the room. He listened to the bathroom door open, then close, and the sound of clothing rustling.
“Yeah, well, he wouldn’t know an orgasm if one slapped him in the face.” John rolled his eyes and retrieved the small padlock from the nightstand.
“Come on, John,” He added quietly, only half-listening to Lestrade, who was ordering them both to wait by the car while he checked out the flat. “I know what you’re thinking. Don’t beat yourself up.”
Encouraged by that line of thinking, Sherlock obeyed John’s cries for more. At first, he moved hesitantly, barely more than a slow wiggle, which made John groan and twist out of frustration as he tried driving the finger in deeper. As his confidence grew, having seen no signs of discomfort on John, he began to pump his finger in and out.
“She was the best Nana our little girl could have ever had. She was a spitfire who didn’t let Frank’s
“I used…” Sherlock croaked out, unable to separate dream from memory. “I used cocaine. Powder, and stole a needle from your kit.”
then looked back up to Sherlock with a questioning glance.
"What are the chances I'll be naked in those pictures?" John asked as he unbuckled.
“I never want you to feel as if you cannot look at me. I know some Doms require no eye contact, but I don’t want that. I want to see you, but most of all, I want
Six minutes later John found himself climbing into the back of a van with Greg at his heels. Each of them were armed with not only
“Unsurprising,” Sherlock sighed, “The average mind needs to hear a name six times before it can remember it with ease. Plus, serving hundreds of people in a single night, remembering one name would be impressive. Can her ID be seen on CCTV footage?”
“He’s right,” Zed, who’d been silent up until now, spoke up. “Tell them they won't laugh.”
“One of the better bondage shops in town, specifically for men like us. Might find a few new toys, while we’re out.”
“God, you were,” John said as the evening air hit his face making him feel alive, “The collar, the trousers, your fucking endurance. I was so proud, Sherlock, still am.”
“Partners are great like that.” Greg smiles over at his friend with genuine warmth in his voice, “I’m glad you have him.”
“Left,” John called out as he took off. “Sherlock’s signal wasn’t central in the building, he was reading a bit more east than where we entered. Plus, almost everyone else went right.”
"I'm taking my jumper to the shops before you get any sudden ideas. Be careful. Might be a while, we're out of nearly everything edible."
For the next three hours, they poured over the box’s contents, only pausing long enough for Sherlock to run downstairs and collect food. Unbidden, Sherlock read some of Elizabeth’s letters to John, who closed his eyes and leaned back as the words wrapped around him like a tender embrace.
“Beautiful,” John purred, placing his empty mug on the table and resting his warm hand on Sherlock’s knee. “Now for the fun part,” he said, grinning and pulling the pen out of the coil metal spine. “Rules and punishment.”
“My apologies, John,” Sherlock said, addressing the man who was his partner. Not the man who was his dom. “I am truly sorry for frightening you.”
“Jesus, they’re going to need help.” John sighed, “Those poor people. I can’t imagine…”
“So, things seem well for you two then,” Zed said conversationally after a moment of silence. “Bit fast though, already on his second collar.”
"I have no doubt. John will do this by the book." Sherlock assured Greg, "John knows better than to face your wrath. Something I am trying to learn."
Not needing to be asked twice, having wanted this since last night, Sherlock bent forward and rubbed the side of John’s shaft against his cheek. He buried his nose against the thatch of trimmed hair around its base and inhaled. John’s skin was still dewy from the shower and residual steam. Sherlock noticed that while the predominant scent was John's body wash, there was something indescribably human hidden in the crease of his thigh. Something he'd only caught in hints and brief whiffs whenever John walked past him. Something his brain registered as unmistakably
Every brush of Sherlock’s fingers against his skin felt like the kiss of a warm flame. Closing his eyes, he imagined he could feel Sherlock’s eyes searing into his very soul as the buttons on his shirt were slowly worked open, one by one. He was already hard by the time Sherlock’s hands pressed against his sternum, coaxing his shirt over his shoulders. With a soft whisper, the shirt joined Sherlock’s belt.
“Cock,” John mumbled with no real fight in him. While having a wet neck wasn’t something he considered a requirement for sleeping, having Sherlock beside him had quickly become one.
“Alright, wearing the collar out? Or would you rather take it off until we get there?” John asked a short while later, once they were both dressed and patting themselves down, checking for wallets, keys, and other required items. (John was currently in possession  of both wallets, thanks to Sherlock’s distinct lack of pockets.)
“Our room.” John echoed. “That sounds… nice.”
"Nice?" John asked, tilting his head so he could watch Sherlock.
“Mmm, that was the point. Oh, would you take this for the evening? The designer failed to leave room in these trousers for even a single pocket.” Sherlock asked, sliding his phone across the table.
“So it’s like Vegas.” John quipped. “What happens in the club stays in the club. That sort of thing.”
Picking up the leather bracelet and holding it between them, John met Sherlock’s gaze and held it while he spoke. “Once I put this on, it will remain locked on your wrist except for when you shower or if you need a break for whatever reason. You’ll be locked full time, my submissive, for all the world to see if they use their eyes. Is that alright?”
My cock is going to be your favourite treat by the end of our holiday. Now, John,” he said as the traces of amusement left his face, “do you want this?”
working late, or he was out at the pub. Probably the latter, he'd been going to the pub nearly every night since they'd arrived home, doing his best to avoid Sherlock whenever possible. He’d work late, stay out drinking, come back to the flat to sleep and shower. They’d seen each other twice since their flight landed. Sherlock’s heart ached for things to be back to the way they had been. He knew it was his fault, he knew if he stopped seeking out drugs, things would get better again. Though, maybe not with John, that bridge was beyond repair now.
a sub? Or was your rose just to make it, so I had to wait?”
“I do better when I’m busy anyway, you know that, John.”
“Yes, Sir, I understand. I was snarky, demanding, and went above my position. It is not my place to bring you to your knees. Rather, it is my privilege to show you how well I can follow out your orders. I apologize for stepping out of line, and thank you for punishing me in a fair and just manner.” Sherlock said in a meek voice, trying not to sound as sincere as he felt. His voice cracked for misuse and thirst. He wanted to ask for a drink, but he sensed this lesson wasn’t over just yet.
**Update as of 20/5/21 - I updated the chapter count, and moved the contract (which was once chapter 6) to be the last chapter of this story. As I post the next couple of chapters you'll see this one move further back until it's at the end. It just felt cleaner to have the chapters all in the correct order, and once everything is posted it should be fairly seamless!**
“That’s hot,” Sherlock sucked his teeth while cupping himself briefly, “We’ll have to explore this cheap porno trope when we have more time. I can drop something else down the drain or flush a condom?”
“He’s everything the papers make him out to be then?” Zed’s curiosity was plain but John wasn’t in the mood to elaborate.
“Get dressed, we have seven girls to go interview. I’ll go get us a cab.”
“That’s all you need to know about,” John said with a tilt of his head. “Just… don’t push me away. We can pretend in public if it comes down to that.”
“It’s too early to say for sure,” Sherlock cautioned.
“If we didn’t have a contest to win, I’d see you go this whole night without an orgasm. As it stands, I know you cannot control yourself in subspace. On your knees. Now.” John released Sherlock’s throat and pointed to the floor then looked over at Lydia. “I know you and Zed have swapped for the night. But would you demonstrate to this submissive just how one should act when given an order?”
“Fried eggs and toast, then… minus the beans,”  he added, checking the cupboard to find it empty of everything except one of Sherlock’s mould spores. He was just cracking the eggs into a pan when Mrs. Hudson knocked on the door and let herself in.
John didn’t sleep much that night, but he remained by Sherlock’s side the whole night. He thanked their lucky stars that Sherlock was able to sleep. He’d been worried that the drugs would have caused him to be restless. But aside from a single nightmare, Sherlock slept with his head peacefully buried in the crook of John’s neck. It was nearing nine o’clock by the time Sherlock stirred. John brushed his hair out of his face, then traced the lines on Sherlock’s forehead as he pulled himself from sleep.
“Went off to help Matt and Elvio talk to other club owners. I gave him all of Lestrade’s business cards I had, with the instruction to have anyone call with information. Poor Donovan is already up to her neck in calls.”
“Yeah, ‘course I would,” John said, already pulling his mobile out of his pocket. Searching through his contacts, he pulled up Zed’s number and smiled down at Sherlock as it began to ring. “Just stay in touch, and let me know where you are.”
Sherlock heard the sterile packaging around the catheter being ripped open, then he felt something cold press against the tip of his cock. The gel made his skin tingle almost instantly, and he almost missed the cold feeling of metal as the bottom of the catheter was lined up and pushed in. It was uncomfortable, and definitely not something Sherlock would seek out for euphoric reasons. However, he couldn’t deny there was something erotic about being on the receiving end of John’s medical skills. The catheter slipped in effortlessly, only meeting resistance when it pushed against his bladder. When John had it in place he patted Sherlock’s thigh and reached for the rest of the device, while holding the ice close to Sherlock’s balls.
“Exactly, I want the best of both worlds, and I want it all with you by my side,” Sherlock confirmed, sliding over the gap between them and resting his head on John’s chest. He reached up and stroked the length of red rope around his neck, then added more quietly, “this is like an anchor for me. It holds me down in a sea of information.”
"Makeup too?" Sherlock smirked. He hadn't missed the way John's eyes smouldered every time he looked at his submissive. Not nor could he deny how that look directed at him made him feel like the most precious thing John had ever seen.
want to see how far I can push this public kink of yours. There’s a dark alley behind our flat with a spot CCTV cameras don’t reach.”
“Enjoy? John, you were singing my praises louder than you have at any crime scene. If I had known that’s all it took, I would have bent you over your chair your first night here.” John chuckled, and Sherlock felt the vibrations against his ribcage. It was wonderfully intimate, and he wondered how anyone in their right mind could wade through life without having access to that feeling. “Here I was, taking you to crime scenes to impress you. All you needed was a good solid fuck.”
“No, Captain, that would be rude. One should never roll their eyes at their Captain, especially when he’s expressing concern for his submissive’s well-being.” Lydia said while pushing into John’s hips. “I could help you with that, Sir.” She said while casting a wink over to Sherlock Just as John’s cock slotted itself between her cheeks.
Sherlock smirked as he unlocked the device and pulled up the voice recording app. Holding down the record button with his thumb he closed his eyes and rocked his body into John's touch.
“Oh, Sherlock,” the sight caused his heart to do somersaults. Butterflies settled in his stomach, making his hands shake so hard the tea threatened to slosh onto their breakfast. John put the tray down on the nightstand then quickly turned his attention to the kneeling man.
"Different climate. Here the humidity is so thick the locals claim you could cut it with a knife. It makes the heat much more oppressive than the dry desert heat you were once used to."
John reached out and took Sherlock by one hand, while Sherlock’s other hand reached up to feel the spot the collar had just rested. Once he had Sherlock standing, he reached around his neck for the silver chain, pulled it up over his neck, and withdrew the smaller key that belonged to Sherlock’s bracelet.
“Here,” John said, getting up and retrieving it from the top of their dresser. “Why? What did you remember?”
“I thought you told Mike you needed someone to split the bills with.”
“He finds targets that match his clients' needs,” Mycroft said, his voice tinged with disgust. “It is safe to say, from the attention he gave you, that you fit the
“So this is just a double whammy for you, being asked to help
“What did you name it?” Sherlock asked, nodding  towards the laptop, “The Tilly Briggs case?”
They only pulled apart when their lungs burned from lack of oxygen. John’s lips were red and swollen, and they turned up into a lopsided grin.
“Jesus, I love you,” John sighed. Sticking his head in front of the fan he let the breeze fall over him before straightening up to pull off his shirt.
Sherlock obediently gave John his wrist and watched as the bracelet was removed and placed on the nightstand beside his collar. John lifted Sherlock’s wrist to his lips and kissed the tender skin, then looked up with questioning eyes.
“That’s an order I enjoy following,” Sherlock grinned, his expression mirroring John’s as the gap between them closed and they shared personal space. John’s hands automatically went to the small of Sherlock’s back while Sherlock’s arms snaked under John’s armpits, broad hands splaying across his shoulder blades. The kiss was quick but heavy with lust and the desire to be close after temporary separation.
A squeal of laughter from their left made them both look up. Immune to the tears her parents were shedding, Rosie was chasing not one but two butterflies through the lush green grass. Sniffling, John dried his eyes on the back of his sleeve and forced a small smile.
“When at a sex club, John…” Sherlock grinned while making shooing motions at his partner.
“Hiya,” Lydia grinned, adjusting the strap of her leather top, “these things never stay in place.”
"Yeah. Anything." Nodding and meaning exactly that, John held Mycroft’s gaze. He would do
“Recent enough. After university and my relationship with Victor - who I will tell you about at another time - ended, I began to dabble in some of the seedier clubs London has to offer. I was already experimenting with drugs at that time and wasn’t fully sober when I agreed to be a slave for my first Master.” Sherlock caught the murderous look in John’s eyes and held out a hand placatingly, “Before you get on your suit of armour and jump on your white horse, I need to clarify something. It wasn’t rape, so please put that out of your head. However, during a scene, my body served one purpose only, and scenes could last hours or days.”
that were definitely
"What do normal people have then?" Sherlock asked without looking up.
“Right, you can leave the dirty talk to me,” John laughed as he motioned towards the side table, “condoms then. But, you’re still wearing clothes, hurry up and strip.”
“Robert Sisk, fifty-five years old, Slovic of birth. Immigrated to England in the early ’80s. He’s been in and out of the British judicial system for a string of crimes, ranging from petty theft to kidnapping. Most recently, however, he’s been on the most wanted list in five countries.”
Sherlock notes, then smiled, remembering the way John’s biceps had gleamed while he’d been working the rope.
“If it makes you feel more comfortable, I can have John remove my collar.”
“Foreplay?” he asked softly, nuzzling his nose against the stubble on John’s jaw.
“It’ll give us time to look for areas we need to discuss, like how to handle our friends. Greg isn’t an idiot, and he might pick up on it if we aren’t subtle. Turning back to the notepad, John scribbled down
“I don’t have to take anything from you, John. You give it to me willingly, everything I need.”
“If you want,” John shrugged. He picked up the chain and held it open, silently asking Sherlock if he’d like to wear them now. Sherlock licked his lips out of nervous excitement then bowed his head.

“Stop thinking so loudly, John,” Sherlock advised, tapping his knee against John’s to get his attention. “You’ve already said we’ll talk. Save your worries for when we get home.”
“Alright,” Sherlock nodded, though he winced the moment he focused on his knees. “Stiff and thirsty.”
“Mmm, get over here and kiss me,” John urged as he entered the room and placed a bottle of red on the corner of the table.
Sherlock thought, watching John’s spine twist as he moved.
“Find something to fuck yourself with, carefully. Show me how you’d want it if it were me, and maybe I’ll take you to bed later and let you live out that fantasy. Make sure you give me a good show, and I’ll let you come before we leave.”
"Jesus, Mary and Joseph," Zed said after letting out a slow whistle. Looking the couple over from head to toe he shook his head and grinned. "You two are out for blood tonight, aren't you?"
“It’s raining, it’s pouring,” Rosie sang from the back as the heavens opened up and fat rivulets of rain enveloped the car. “Going to rain all day?” She asked, and John couldn’t help but smile a little. Always curious and always asking about the weather, she and Sherlock had taken to watching the radar. John was convinced that she could more accurately predict the weather than any news station in the city.
Sherlock was only halfway through interviewing his network and his mobile would
“Mm, I did. What did he have to say?” Sherlock asked, placing his violin aside and rising gracefully to his feet.
“Sherlock, this is Lydia,” Zed said, in an equally hushed tone, “she’ll be your co-star tonight.”
“John, I want any version of a life with you, but especially this one, where we both share something we love so deeply.”
The sliding airport doors pull open as they approach. Sherlock glanced at John with an inward smirk and began a silent countdown.
John dove into an abridged version of his time on tour, his injury, and the basics of living with Sherlock Holmes. By the time he’d finished his tale, he’d knocked back two beers and a basket of crisps. A pleasant buzz had settled over him by the time his story was over. Zed let out a low whistle of appreciation, then waggled an eyebrow.
“And?” He prompted, releasing Sherlock’s foot to the confines of the blankets, where hopefully he’d maintain
“So they say,” John grinned back, ignoring the twinge in his shoulder, “Was a close one, for a bit. Don’t get shot.”
“He’s… a bit of a,” John began by way of apology.
“Breathe, Pet. I need you focused.” He whispered, stroking his finger along the inside of Sherlock’s arm after tying off the knot. “Breathe with me, watch me,” he urged gently.
“Just nice?”
“Good, then this is coming off,” John tugged at the leather band around Sherlock’s wrist.“Let me see it, love. I want this just to be the two of us. No dom/sub relationship, just us with what God gave us.”
Sherlock followed John’s gaze and regarded the big man respectfully. It seemed he was to thank for a large portion of his faithful companion’s personality. John’s carefully controlled rage had been honed and perfected somewhere, and now he knew where, and by whom.
“There’s nothing of use here,” He said with disgust, slamming the lid shut and passing the laptop over to the officer shadowing him. “School, work, pornography. Seriously, who downloads pornography now?”
“I got through the login,” Sherlock said with a sigh, scrubbing his hands over his eyes.
“Should have worn pants,” John said under his breath.
“But you don’t want it now?” John asked gently, noticing Sherlock’s choice of words.
Sherlock taken care of, Mycroft quickly went over the plan.
"You love it, don't bother pretending you don't. But John is right. I need to look over the room we'll be in once more, to make sure everything is in order before the club opens."
“Sherlock! I’m going to… Oh god,” John cried, his whole body tensing before he went completely still. Sherlock continued to thrust inside of him with abandon, milking John for everything he had. Roughly five seconds went by before John pulled himself out of his frozen state of pleasure. His cock twitched in the empty air, and his balls drew up tight. He began to shake, every muscle and nerve ending overly sensitized as he came hard, his come hitting the duvet below in milky white puddles.
The husbands shared a look between themselves before turning to Zed. When Zed nodded, they relaxed their shoulders and agreed. John reached into his pockets and withdrew his wallet. From that, he pulled out one of Greg’s business cards and slid it across the table.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock said a moment later when John had cleaned him off with a tissue and tossed the condom in the bin beside Sherlock’s bed. “For treating me with such care and attention. You’re the first partner to treat me like a person, not just a hole to be used.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright, fine. Charming it is.” John laughed softly, his lips ghosting over the shell of Sherlock’s ear. “Now get that bewitching arse up and come to the shops with me.” Knowing he’d pushed a button, John let out a playful yelp and stepped back as Sherlock picked up something slimy and pink from the table and brandished it like a weapon.
He told himself, making himself take a bite of his sandwich.
“Punishment?” Sherlock cocked an eyebrow and tried to hide his grin. It would be tempting to push John once in a while, but depending on John’s forms of punishments, that might not be wise.
“Zed, if I’m not mistaken.”
John stepped backward off the platform with an almost imperceivable nod and positioned himself a short distance away from the crowd’s front. Zed followed, standing beside John. Both Doms crossed their arms over their chests and widened their stances.
“John, I’m not an idiot you know,” Greg said, giving John a rueful smile. “I know about Hope. If anything, it makes you a better friend. I know I’d rather someone at my side who won't hesitate. It’s what partners do, and tonight I’m glad to have you by my side.”
“Oh love,” John turned, abandoning the groceries on the worktop in favour of taking both of Sherlock’s hands in his and pulling him into an embrace. “This isn’t the world of internet porn. I don’t have to hit you for what we do together to be considered bondage. Those videos show a different world, a world in which men are treated roughly for the sake of the camera. I despise male bondage porn. It’s nothing more than abuse, and I will not treat you like that. I’m not into slapping someone around for the sake of an erection, I wouldn’t even be able to get it up if I did that to you. Stop watching them please, they aren’t research. Well, if they are, it’s research on what not to do.”
“Trust your gut, John. It isn’t wrong often.” Zed patted him on the shoulder and pointed to a bar. “That’s The Gents, the bar I was telling you about. Elvio is waiting inside for us.”
“Heterochromia,” John said, without realizing he’d voiced it out loud. He’d stolen his fair share of covert glances at Sherlock’s unique eyes in the past, but this was the first opportunity he’d had to study them up close. “In this light, they appear silver. Gorgeous.”
“Why do you put up with me John?” Sherlock asked around a frustrated growl. Lifting his chin from his knees he rested the side of his face against John’s shoulder blade whispering, “Why?”
“Excuses, excuses,” John sang out, reaching for the rope held between Sherlock’s teeth. In a lower register, he added, “Your trousers already do very little to hide your cock. What I’m going to do will only emphasize your bulge. It might even show a bit of definition. Are you okay with this, Pet?”
When his lunch break finally rolled around, he found the staff room blessedly empty. Using the browser on his mobile phone, he spent ten minutes google searching for equipment. When he found something he liked or thought Sherlock might like, he’d send a link via text message. After several such texts, Sherlock replied with a single winking emoji.
“John,” Sherlock said adamantly, his voice rumbling against John’s chest, “I promise, as I have in the past, to tell you if I’m uncomfortable. I want this, I’ve wanted this, for a long while. Just because my previous partner didn’t treat my body with respect doesn’t mean I’m afraid you’ll do the same. These past few weeks, you’ve shown me time and time again what it feels like to be loved. Truly loved.”
A sense of familiarity washed over him when he stepped into the main room. Glancing around briefly, he noticed that not much had changed. Here and there, he spotted an update or addition. A fancy stereo system had replaced the old jukebox. Branching off of the new system were a handful of speakers that carried the music across the room.
be taking those keys, as well. I want it all laid out on your bed neatly, on which you’ll be sitting however you’re best comfortable. I want you naked, with your clothes neatly put away. I’ll join you in ten minutes.”
“Fine,” John grumped, “but only because it’s starting to rain. Drop me off at the nearest Tescos, not one halfway across town, and we can talk on the way. Not a moment longer.”
“I concur. Tell me if I get something wrong,” Sherlock hummed, pressing his mouth against John’s. John sighed and parted his lips, allowing Sherlock’s tongue to dart inside.
“Ah, good.” He said, pointing to two empty chairs, “please sit and we can begin.”
Sherlock knew that John’s showers lasted seven minutes (nine if masturbation entered the equation). He lounged on the bed for a minute more, then set about finding a spot that would be out of the way of the door when John opened it. Once he’d decided on the site between the two doors, he removed his clothing, folded them, and placed them on a shelf inside his wardrobe to be put away later. Two minutes had passed, and on the off chance that John would cut his shower short, Sherlock got down on the floor and faced the bathroom door.
“I need you to remain an open line between Zed, the other club owners, and us.” Sherlock stopped with one foot already in the corridor and turned, facing John. “I’ll need you later. I will quite possibly need to clear my head when I return.” He gave John a look of molten lava, his eyes darkening to a steel blue.
“My English Bulldog. Fat old thing he was, and she’s right, he always stank. Had the worst gas.”
Sherlock looked up and regarded his partner with an apologetic gaze. He'd been well aware that John only agreed to this plan because he'd held out hope that another option would crop up. But now, with even Mycroft at a dead end, he watched that fire of hope die in John's eyes.
my knees won't be going anywhere close to the floor while I’m restraining you.”
for him to be available.”
“Mm, no, there isn’t. That’s not what I want. I don’t want someone panting at my feet, begging for my cock day in, day out. I want a companion. And God help me if I somehow manage to get you to show a little respect,” he shrugged, smiling faintly at the man sitting beside him, “well, then I will be pleased. Respect and obedience will be your top priorities, Sherlock. Those two traits will earn you your leather collar.”
"A little bit, sweetheart," John admitted. He and Sherlock had promised each other that they would never lie to Rosie. Not even the little white lies to keep her safe. It had been difficult once she'd started walking and talking, but she was a smarter child for it. And neither of them regretted their promise. "It's really hard to say goodbye to someone you loved."
“Positive. The old joke ‘have you tried turning it off and on again’ comes to mind. I need to reboot my mind, and drugs aren’t an option.”
Smirking, John pushed himself up off the counter and walked towards Sherlock. Placing both hands on Sherlock’s biceps, he looked up into sharp silver eyes and, with a semi-straight face, whispered, “Sherlock Holmes, will you be my bae?”
“Do I want to know how much money you’re spending?”
"Yes, we all owe John a great debt of gratitude." Sherlock agreed softly, "He's out with a friend now, checking in with other club owners to see if they've noticed anything similar."
“What was that about?” Sherlock’s eyebrow was arched, and he wore a concerned look as John approached the table.
“Ta,” John held out his mobile, pulling up the picture Zed had sent him a short while ago. “This man had more than a keen interest in Sherlock the last two nights. Zed has never seen him before and he snuck past security at Zed’s club. Can you just… run a search on him?”
“It will be intense. I don’t take this lightly,” John’s hand slipped from Sherlock’s hair to stroke along the collar at the back of his neck, “when wearing this, I won't tolerate disobedience. There will be punishments set in place, should we continue.”
Sherlock, on the other hand, straightened his suit, thankful that despite the newly added perk of physical encounters with John, he hadn’t taken up the habit of parading around in nothing but his collar full time. He had, of course, thought about it, but Mrs. Hudson visited far too frequently to make it a reality. Instead, he saved that for sleepy mornings when neither of them wanted to leave the comfort of their bed, but one of them had to make breakfast. Or at the very least, tea before John got a headache from caffeine withdrawal.
. Shaking his head, Sherlock walked to the door, opening it just a crack to listen as Mrs. Hudson greeted the newcomer.
“Let’s order out, and while we wait, I’ll show you what’s in here.” John ruffled Sherlock’s hair as he walked past him, graciously not laughing when the laptop’s lid snapped shut and pushed aside as Sherlock practically leaped out of his chair.
