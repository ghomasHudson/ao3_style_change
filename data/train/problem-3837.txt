"What? No, man, I'm not the Empty. It's me. I'm here to get you out, but we don't have much time—"
"No, the drive-thru didn't sell clothes."
"Never thought I'd see an angel down on its belly like that," he hears the tall demon saying. "High and mighty as they are."

"They're broken," says Castiel. He tries to keep the edge of bitterness out of his voice.
. It smells...chemical, like ammonia, like rot. Dean watches just long enough to see the skin blackening and crisping as the body jerks in its death throes, and then he spins back to the table.
He thinks he feels a presence in the back of his mind, a crawling terrible voice that pages dispassionately through the fear in his head and says,

for that. Wonders, not for the first time, when he became someone that Sam was afraid of—which of the blows he’s swung over the years was the one that broke the camel’s back, so to speak. When he became someone who only knew how to hurt people.
Cherry's expression softens a little. "Listen, hon. That was a sweet thing you tried to do for your friend, okay? Not your fault I wasn't his type."

"I...don't know," says Cas, wonderingly. "I...I didn't think you could. I didn't think there was a way."
. Gone. Rinse, repeat. "That was his grand deathbed confession, yeah? Lay it all out and then kick the fucking bucket."
"One of the vampires. It doesn't matter. It's done already."
Dean jabs a finger at the dreary wallpaper, which he's almost sure has shifted to a different, albeit equally unmemorable, chintzy pattern since the last time he glanced at it. "And where the

"He sends me a message occasionally," says Castiel. "He's hard to contact, Dean. You know that Sam can become...focused." He neglects to mention, here, that Sam's texts and calls had gotten fewer and farther between as the months passed, the words becoming more curt and distant, less and less being exchanged beyond the terse
Cas doesn't move his hand, but he looks away.
"Come on, Cas," Sam says. He's looking intently into Cas's face, reaching with one hand for the pulse point in Cas's throat.
Castiel closes his eyes. He wills himself to lie still as Raz tugs off the rest of his clothes and runs two fingers down the outside of his leg, neutralizing the trail of gold ooze there. The Kaustos polyp has reached Castiel's ankle and is beginning slowly to reverse its course; Raz plucks it off with no more effort than it would take to pick a flower. He smears one last daub of ointment where the slug's progress had been interrupted, picks up the pot, and stands.

"Get your lighter," Sam barks, emptying a bottle of something viscous and golden—cooking oil?—over the thing. Thank god Sam is keeping his head, because Dean's incapable of doing more than following basic orders right now—he keeps staring at the eel, at its gnashing rotary of teeth, teeth that were
"Dean—"
Castiel has almost always, in general, avoided looking too deeply into Dean's soul. When he'd first met Dean, he'd shown no such courtesy, but eventually he'd come to understand that tuning into Dean's mind to such an extent wasn't something that would be considered appropriate by human standards. Despite how carelessly humans tended to broadcast their feelings and thoughts. And it had become clear that even Dean, who always wore his emotions recklessly on his sleeve, like banners flown into battle, was nevertheless uncomfortable with it on the few occasions that he realized or suspected what was happening. So Castiel had quickly learned to restrict himself to picking up only Dean's surface emotions, the strong ones that swept across his mind like waves on the sea.
Dean can't really argue with that, given the circumstances. In all the history of balls in courts, he thinks there might never have been a ball as thoroughly in a court as this one is in his.
Dean drops his chin almost to his chest. His breath hitches; his mouth moves soundlessly. "...please," he mutters finally.
And now more of them are stepping forward, pointing to invisible injuries.
"Eventually what?" says Dean.
“You’re crying,” Cas murmurs, though Dean can see plainly that Cas is crying too. Cas traces his thumb over the bones in Dean’s face, smearing tears over the skin.
God, Dean misses his mom. He misses Bobby. Misses Charlie. But he still has a family. Jack’s tears are wet and warm against the side of his jaw. Dean thinks of Cas again, probably because he can’t ever be around Jack and
Castiel ignores this feeble smokescreen of humor in favor of pulling Dean's wrist back, out of the way. He grabs Dean's knee and pushes it to the side, forcing Dean's legs to open. The coat, fortunately, continues to cover everything that human propriety would demand stay covered, but not what Dean was trying to hide: two shapes carved into the planes of his inner thighs, large and symmetrical and unmistakably sigils.

Castiel doesn't respond—he can't. He fights against the witchcraft with everything he has, and still he stands frozen, unable to even look Dean in the eye.

Cas shrugs a little. "I'm...I'm trying."
The sky overhead is cloud-grey but bright. A cool breeze strokes his cheek. In front of him, a pewter-grey lake ripples under the same breeze, and sends small waves to lap gently at the dock beneath his feet.
“You put us back in, we’ll fight our way out,” Sam says breathlessly. His eyes blaze; his fists are clenched.
There's pain deep in his ears as the epoxy is poured in, and the sounds around him fade into utter silence. Castiel, racing through the maze of vehicles, stumbles again as Dean's sensory deprivation overlaps with his own perception. Dean is blind and deaf, shaking on the trailer floor in renewed agony as the vampires start drinking from him again. Castiel is almost at the door now. He's reaching for the handle, he's with Dean on the floor, he's writhing and his arms are on fire, he can hear Dean crying out in pain even though Dean can't hear himself.

"I didn't want to make you uncomfortable," Cas repeats.

"I couldn't...find any at the store earlier," says Castiel, barely paying attention to what he's saying. He can't tear his eyes away from Dean, the planes and curves of his body glowing gold at the edges.
Sam shivers, though not from the freezing rain that he can't feel. "I can't even imagine," he says honestly.
, searingly so, burning into him like napalm. It
Sam is standing over the smoking bodies of two more leviathan, staring towards the trees. His face is pale, his mouth slack with horror. “Dean,” he gasps, “they—they took him—”
Something shutters in Cas's face. His eyes go quiet.
. It was just a knee-jerk reaction, but I just thought, this is where Cas decides I'm too unclean to live. This is where he puts me down."
Cas, wide-eyed, reaches out. It seems to be the most he can move—his feet stay planted firmly in the earth, his body ramrod-stiff like the sigil is forcing him to stand upright. The sinuous symbol on his cheek is beginning to smoke and bubble, as though it’s eating into his skin. He stretches his arm out toward Dean’s outstretched hand; Dean, lunging, feels the tips of their fingers just barely brush.
"Well," says Dean, the scarlet creeping back into his face, "say something."
He moves before he's realized what he's doing, leans forward and twists one hand into the fabric of Dean's coat—of

the map table and is now towering over everyone, the felted antlers wobbling dangerously over his head as he fixes a glower at the assorted woodland creatures.
As far as he's concerned, that explains everything, but Raz keeps going, talking almost dreamily, as if he enjoys the smooth drawl of his own voice.
The fates take pity on Castiel; he passes out before long, the pain of his wings too much when combined with the horror of Raz's hand on them. Even with his grace fettered, his wings maintain a particularly strong connection to his true form; Raz's demonic touch is corruption, agony, an attack on his essence that he is powerless to fight. After interminable minutes of Raz wrenching and yanking on feathers and ligaments, a piercing pain near the base of his right wing burns out every coherent thought in his brain and he blacks out.
They break apart again but Castiel stays bent over, forehead resting against Dean's. He breathes in the smell of Dean, runs his hands over Dean's chest.
, his expression is saying.
Cas doesn't come to him.
Dean paces the Bunker floor, fists clenched at his sides.
"I didn't think it was really you," Dean rasps. He sags against the wall, his eyes never leaving Castiel's. "I thought—I thought they—" His face twists in terror, his gaze darting suddenly around the room like a frightened bird.
at Dean, which isn't anything new for him, anyway.
A hand on his hair cuts through his agonized haze, pulling him back to reality. It's Raz, kneeling beside him, using the fistful of Castiel's hair as a grip to roll him roughly onto his back. Castiel feels a shaky whimper bubbling low in his throat, behind the gag. His torso is criss-crossed in the corrosive gold trails; he can feel the slug, which had finally crossed a hipbone a few minutes ago, inching slowly down his leg towards his ankle.

, Dean thinks with strange and breathless elation,
"Dean would not be here," Cas interrupts flatly. He tips his head away from Dean's hand. "He could not be here."
Chuck leans up against the binding circle's invisible boundary. "C'mon, Dean. Can't you feel it? The fraying? All these resets aren't good for your brain, you know. Stop trying to break out of the story. It's not going to end well for you."
it, indistinguishable from his own, deep in his heart like a stab wound—Dean's panic ramping up as he realizes he can't open his eyes.
He's failed, he realizes dimly. After everything, he's failed. He isn't enough, he's never been enough.
Sam frowns. "Chuck?"
Cas starts to cry out as they rush him up the stairs into the kitchen, his body jerking in their grip. The skin below his ribs ripples and heaves until Dean half-expects it to split open. He averts his gaze so that he can focus on not tripping. McGinnis's corpse lies in the corner where the last shotgun round had dropped him; his blood is spattered over the bars of the kitsune girl's cage. They lift Cas onto the narrow kitchen table and stand, panting, beside it.
Castiel averts his eyes, not because he needs to but because he
"It's not you," Castiel says quickly. "You're very beautiful. And very kind. I think things are just confusing for him right now. He's had..."
“You messed with our heads,” Dean growls. “Again. You played us,
"Oh." Castiel blinks down at Dean. He slowly lowers himself onto his side to lie next to Dean. Lets one arm stay draped over Dean's chest, avoiding the release cooling on Dean's skin. "I'll fix it."
Dean doesn't know what he'll tell Cas. Dean is, in fact, terrified by how utterly and completely he does
Castiel suspects it was quite a few more than a couple, but he just says, "Destroying them now would be—"
"That it's—it's—" Sam's face scrunches. "It's over." He sounds almost as though he's pleading. "It's over. Dean, it's

Dean hadn't even heard them go. Jesus, some hunter he is. John Winchester is probably turning in his metaphorical grave.
"I didn't think you would," says Dean. "Find me, I mean." He shrugs, then winces as the movement jostles his arms. "They did...they did a pretty good job of convincing me of that."
He takes Dean's shoes off, but hesitates when it comes to the rest of his clothing. Castiel has been human and he remembers sleeping being far more comfortable with fewer layers; he knows, too, that Sam and Dean prefer specific garments for sleeping when possible. But the idea of undressing Dean feels far too intimate, too fraught with peril, so Castiel quashes the impulse and moves to examine the wounds on Dean's arms. The skin around the half-healed bites—there are so
"I know you know—what I—what I did growing up."

touch them," Castiel grits out, his voice hoarse from so long without speech. He tries to quell the panic sparking in his gut. He's never physically manifested his wings before. They're shaking uncontrollably, tiny muscle spasms running along them as he struggles to keep them folded close to his body.
"Regenerate
Dean frowns. "What the hell are you talking about?" He starts tugging the bandages off his now-healed hands. "Cas, they're beautiful. When you pulled them out of nowhere, in the lot, that was..." He sucks in a breath. "Well, it was terrifying, honestly, and also they were on fire, so there was that. But they were friggin' gorgeous. They still are."
Castiel be smug? Being the most popular guy in school has its perks. Castiel could have any guy he wants—probably any girl he wants, too, not that Castiel makes any secret of
Examining the sigils with renewed vigor, he still fails to recognize them. The symbols winding through the patterns, however, are ancient Greek, easy enough to read.
“It was a fucking
Sam grimaces, his free hand curling a little tighter around his shoulder. “Trust me, that isn’t surprising to hear.”
"Dean," he growls into the hollow of Dean's throat. He kisses along the skin of Dean's ribs, moves back up to mouth at Dean's collarbone and then his jaw. Dean exhales in a harsh, needy pant, lifting his hips against Castiel's and tipping his head back to expose his throat. Dean's fingers are buried in his feathers, sending heat splintering through Castiel's body like lightning; even on this plane, his wings are as close as it comes to being an open conduit to his true form, and the sensation of it, the
“Didn't know Death could heal people,” Dean croaks, finding his voice at last.
Dean shakes his head mutely. He thinks he might have lost the ability to speak.
He'd been the one to pace a groove into the Bunker hallway, out of his mind with worry that one day when Cas didn't come back from a grocery run, and he'd been the one that Cas called, shaken and weary and newly graced-up, once he'd escaped the angel dicks who had been torturing him. He'd been the one to hold Cas in his arms at night when his angel broke down with the guilt of making the angels fall and stealing someone else's grace and—
Raz winks at Castiel, and places the slug on his bare chest. It ripples, suddenly animate, and oozes along his torso like the real thing. It leaves a trail of glittering gold ooze behind it, like a brush streak of metallic paint. Castiel feels it against his skin, cool at first, then warm, suddenly, tingling. And then

Sam nods to him. Eileen, sitting next to Sam with her head pillowed on his shoulder, pulls a gentle half-smile. Her eyes are kind. Dean can't stand it.
, he thinks.
“It makes a certain kind of sense,” Cas says. “Chuck was, after all, the original writer of the universe, the one who was scripting out our lives. With him gone, there isn’t really a pre-written destiny for anyone, anymore. Only the one we each write for ourselves.”
just for you to start losing hope right when we get our edge back. We're going to beat him, Cas. We'll be enough."
“Oh,” says Dean. He might have been embarrassed by it, once. Or tried to deflect it, frightened by the immensity of what it suggests. Now it just makes something warm unfurl in his chest. He cups his other hand against Cas’s wrist, rubs his thumb against the pulse point, traces along the lines of Cas’s palm. “I figured maybe my book said I died by wendigo or something, and you were keeping an eye out.”
"Still," Castiel echoes. He studies Dean. Feels anew the throbbing discomfort under the bandages, and has to suppress a quake of fear. "Dean, how much..."
Eventually he realizes that the sky through the window behind him is getting darker, not lighter. The air pressure shifts and there's a tingling on his skin, a faint trickle of static making the hairs on his arm stand on end. When he peers through the blinds, he sees that the sky is darkening ominously, with thunderclouds gathering in dense droves on the horizon. The trees on the other side of the parking lot sway violently in a strong wind, heralds of the impending storm.
"I think I loved you," says Dean. He watches a spasm of shock cross Cas's face, watches it crumple like a house of falling cards.
“If you want me in there,” says Cas, but he doesn’t say it uncertainly—he says it with another smile, gentle and warm against the side of Dean’s jaw. Like he already knows the answer. But Dean will say it anyway. He’ll say it again and again.
With a gasp, Dean goes limp, lolling bonelessly in Castiel's arms as the pain drains out of him. Castiel realizes, with a stab of mingled wonder and alarm, that he can

"Angelhood was
It looks like an eel. Like a monstrous eel folded up in Cas's belly, bulging out of it now that Dean's opened up the abdominal cavity, writhing and sliding over and along itself with no head or tail visible. He hears Sam retch, feels pretty close to vomiting himself. The only thing keeping the bile down is the knowledge that if he did he'd pretty much be puking directly into Cas's guts. Actually, the coils of the thing are concealing any internal organs, or
"I don't know who you are," Dean says slowly. But no, that's wrong. He knows who Cas is. He knows who Cas is like he knows his own name, like he knows Sam's.
, because the big, bad god was gone, huh?
made? Where exactly do you think I'm going, huh? News flash, I'm at the top of the food chain already, guys! Nowhere higher up to go!"
Castiel's barely aware of moving, only that between one instant and the next he's beside Sam and Dean, the three of them an awful, biblical tableau, Sam's hand coming up to clutch at Castiel's sleeve even as Dean draws in one more rattling breath from where he's hung up on a beam like a sacrificial animal—
Dean swallows hard, trying to block out the sound. He steels himself and slowly, carefully, he starts to pull. The thing in his hand wriggles as he gradually reels it out, wincing at the knowledge of what it must be doing to Cas. He has to fight the desire to haul it out hand over hand, get it out of his friend as fast as possible—god knows what the thing could be wrapped around, in there. Sam isn't looking anymore; his head is bent, his mouth by Cas's ear, lips moving, whatever he's whispering inaudible over the sounds of Cas's frantic agony.
It's the monsters from the basement, the ones McGinnis had been keeping imprisoned. He sees the kitsune girl among their ranks and guesses she must have freed them from their chains.
Sam all but kicks the passenger side door open—shoves his head and shoulders through the gap, leans out over the asphalt. Dean can hear him retching.
"But you might have a soulmate out there." The words are hard to get out. Sam is acutely aware of the way their shoulders are still bumping against each other, the way Gadreel's hand is resting against the cold rock mere inches from Sam's own.
"A bit," says Dean quietly. "Quite...quite a bit, Cas. We put gauze over it, I don't know if the...if the feathers will..."
He starts for the door.
. He can figure this out. “Alright—you two take the blossom and head back to the portal, I’ll go—”
and then he's off, the wound in his back bubbling a dark red, the rebar scarlet all the way down its vicious length.
Cas has a soulmate.
Shiv scowls, shuffling in place for another moment before she whirls and storms out of the cell. Castiel watches her retreat up the corridor until a firm hand forces his chin around.
When Castiel opens his eyes it is to featureless nothing, a dim grey stretching on forever. He immediately closes them again. So this is it, then. He's dead.
wouldn’t we ask? Sam, we just—we just up and left for a
Castiel nods, careful not to dislodge Dean's palm. He shies away from the thought of—of Dean holding Castiel's head in his lap, listening to Castiel breathe, watching him sleep—it makes something warm and fizzing unfurl in his chest, a fluttering feeling that he can't unstitch from the mortal ebb and flow of his body.
“They went to take their cups to the kitchen,” smiles Cas. “That was quite some time ago, so I expect they won’t be making a reappearance.”
Dean feels his legs give way. He buckles against the table, holding himself up, his mind going blank with overwhelming relief as Cas's fingers spasm with sudden life, as Cas's eyes flutter open and sharpen into focus.
Sam stands outside the Impala, stretching for a moment before he slides in behind the wheel. “How much longer to Washington, do you think?”
-adjacent existence.
"I'm sorry I can't heal you," he blurts again. Dean's arms are swathed in gauze; his skin is broken and bloody in so many places. His body is a map of Castiel's failure to protect him.
"—but
"Go to hell," spits Dean. Castiel can taste blood on the roof of his mouth. Dean is afraid—his terror suffuses the trailer in a dense fog, and he is fighting to keep it from showing on his face.
Dean is hunched over now, Corin's weight driving him down into the floor as the vampire crouches over him. Castiel grits his teeth against the spell that holds him in place; if he could move, he'd fling himself through the fire now, consequences be damned, and hope that his disintegrating vessel knocked Corin loose. He can feel shame and agony twisting through Dean's soul, digging their hooked claws in, dragging it down into whatever dark pit had been its prison and refuge before Castiel rescued him.
"They were gorgeous," says Dean, realizing too late that his voice has gone soft and reverent. "Missing a lot of the feathers, though. No wonder why he can't fly."
"Afraid of what?" Dean's legs have regained some semblance of life and are carrying him forward. He strides deeper into the shed, toward Cas. "Afraid of
"I don't want to hurt you," Castiel says, and there it is again, that gentle earnestness, and Dean's heart experiences a sweet pang entirely separate from the baser sensations preoccupying his dick.
"Said
“Don’t you think I know that?” Dean tightens his hand around the bottle to keep his fingers from shaking. He misses his mom. Misses her like a dull knife in his ribs. There are so many people he misses, now. His chest is full of rusting iron. “I look at you and I see—I see—”
"I'm Jo, I exist too," says the blonde girl. "This is Benny, Andrea, Charlie." The tiny redhead, the last to be named, is looking back and forth between Castiel and Dean as if watching a tennis match, her face radiant with delight.
!” someone yells from off-screen, and Donna’s forehead fills the feed for a moment. “Merry Christmas, you guys!”
Cas is human, so he can't read thoughts, or hear prayers, not anymore. But maybe he knows Dean well enough to guess, anyway.
They find the vamp nest pretty easily, catch the bloodsuckers red-handed, quite literally. The frightened girl who was about to be their next meal escapes out the shed door as Dean and Sam lay waste with a pair of machetes from the Impala’s trunk.
"Don't hurt him?" The vampire doesn't drop his hand. "He took what was mine, Dean." The ring of flame tightens, until Castiel is sure his battered wings will catch; still he can do nothing except pull them closer and grit his teeth. He won't scream, but he can't stop the grunt of pain that escapes his clenched jaw as the fire sears the skin of his vessel with its nearness.
"Stores will certainly be open by now," he says, finally spotting the keys on the floor where they must have fallen out of his coat pocket. "And the storm has passed. You need clothes. And food. Unless you want to keep eating soup."
“I don’t know,” says Dean. He looks up at the landing, where Cas is smiling fondly at Jack as the kid slowly signs out a question to Eileen. “Maybe. Maybe just—something like it. Where we’re not
"I've got you," he says. Dean clutches at him as Castiel sets him down on the bed. "It's alright, Dean, I've got you, it's alright." He keeps murmuring, the words blending together into ceaseless susurration, as he shrugs out of his coat, then his jacket. The jacket, he realizes belatedly, isn't going to fit, and is too short to do much good in any case. So he slips Dean's arms through the trenchcoat sleeves, first one and then the other, sliding a palm between Dean's shoulder blades to lift them off the bed, speaking quietly all the while.
very pink. It's fucking adorable and it makes Castiel want to lean forward and kiss him. Dean's eyes flicker up to meet Castiel's for a second and his tongue darts out to wet his lips, an unconscious gesture that sends heat rushing to pool at the base of Castiel's spine.
fingers warm against Castiel's bare skin. Dean's soul twines cobalt and indigo through the space between them; Dean's pulse hammers out from his fingertips like a symphony. Castiel feels it echoing through his vessel's bones; he is an empty church, Dean is song, Dean is a bell, Dean is incense and smoke in the golden light—
“Good.” Cas eases the scythe back into the holster, makes to rise. “You should be safe now.”
"I am

sacrifices. To carry out orders.
Jack just looks at him with those huge puppy-dog eyes—chalk down another thing he seems to have inherited from Sam.
"How would a vampire—"
, he thinks.
Castiel hadn't seen any reason to mention this to Dean, but the healing has drained him as well—he's exhausted as he pulls out of the parking lot under the still-overcast sky, his head pounding. His wings, tucked away in the etheric plane, ache sharply, even more so than usual.

Dean feels his eyebrows shoot up. “Uh. You wanna elaborate?”

"Anyway," Dean interrupts, speaking quickly. "Freaky stuff. But hey, dreams are weird." He slides out of bed and pads toward the bathroom.
“You—”
emanating from him, have human bodies always burned like this, and Castiel never noticed?
Sam grimaces. “We beat her once, but it was a close thing. And that was on Earth, not here where she’s strongest.”
Jack nods, the resolute expression on his face somehow making him look even younger. He trails after Michael and Dean watches the two of them take a couple steps away—not far, just a few yards.
"Who did that to you?"
With every day that passes since they averted the last world-shattering apocalypse—with every day since they beat Chuck, got Cas back, saved the world—Dean thinks he can feel a little more of the tension he carries around in his chest loosening. There’s a lot of years of accumulated tension to get through, granted, but this—
"Goddamn right," Dean growls. "I can't fucking believe you. Jumping through that fire—the fuck were you thinking?"
And, Dean thinks ruefully, then there's him. Dean Winchester. Edging closer to the bed in his stupid cheerleading uniform, which he didn't even have time to wash after the game today. He'd only worn it so that he'd have a better chance of getting into this dumb party, which is so jazzed on team spirit that when he, Benny and Jo all showed up in full regalia (Benny and Jo in their dorky band getups and Dean in a pleated skirt that, frankly, makes his ass look
Cas goes still. Very quietly, he says, "When I left, I thought you only felt anger toward me."
"Nice to meet you, Dean," he says.
"Cas, come on, if there's something I can tell you to make you believe me, just let me know what it is, alright? You want me to tell you the last movie I made you watch, or—?"
Dean swears and jumps about a foot in the air. Trust his sasquatch of a little brother to sneak up on him at the worst moment possible. He isn't sure whether to blame it on Sam's natural cat-footedness, or to chalk it up to angelic power. To be fair, he hasn't noticed any other superpowers manifesting in his brother; Sam is pretty much just regular Sam, albeit skinnier than ever, with deep hollows lingering under his eyes, the stubborn remnants of the Trials.
is almost overwhelming after six months of having Dean's soul barred from him. He'd thought he had the measure of how keenly he'd felt its absence. He'd been wrong. It's only now, sensing Dean's soul fully again, that he understands the chasm the
"If you say you're not worth it," says Castiel tiredly, "I will simply pass out again, right now."
Dean reaches over and takes Cas's hand. Tangles their fingers together. "I always want you to stay."
He finally looks down at the phone he's been clutching and dials Cas's number, but it goes straight to voicemail—Cas's phone is turned off.
"Hey, shh," says Dean. He wraps his arms around his brother, presses his hands against Sam's shoulder blades. He thinks about Sam left behind in the Bunker, maintaining the spell while...god, while having to hold Dean's body up, most likely. "It's okay, Sammy. We're okay."
!” Dean yells, but Cas just stares desperately at him, rooted to the spot, blocking Dean’s shot. Leviathan blood trickles darkly down his cheek. Dean staggers forward, ignoring the bolt of pain in his knee.
Dean curls his fingers down over his palm. Slowly, warily, he nods.
“As you—as you are now?” Dean sputters. The idea of him
“I’m not gonna come by myself, either,” Cas gravels into Dean’s ear, and alright, those words in
"Hmm," hums Dean, burrowing closer. "S'morning already?"
. Screwed himself over, because Dean needed someone to drag him out of the fire again.
Thunder cracks, much nearer now, and Castiel hears the sudden whispering rush of rain.
“I don’t think we’re gonna need to, Sammy,” he says. “Think the world’s coming to us.”
He could kick himself for how inadequate the words are. He stares like he can sear Cas into his brain, overwrite the memory of Cas being swallowed up by the Empty, those few scant seconds that are going to haunt him forever.
He tightens his grip on the scimitar, reassured by the fact that Cas seems able to stand on his own two feet. He wants to spare a glance around him to check on the others, but the fey are advancing toward him and there’s no time. He’ll cut through this entire room if he has to, before he lets any of them lay another hand on Cas—
“Good at what?”

“I’ll drink to that,” says Dean, and tips a french fry toward Sam.

this is. And when that happens, you'd better hope you're nowhere near us."
"Shiv, sweetheart. Have I been wrong, yet?" Raz, by contrast, looks alight with excitement, his tongue poking out from between his teeth, his eyes roving up and down Castiel's body.
“Well, more room for me,” he yawns, and stretches out nearly horizontal, pillowing his head against Cas’s besweatered shoulder. There’s something he wants to ask, he remembers. He tries to push off the fog of impending sleep.
Chuck’s mouth moves wordlessly. A bubble of scarlet blood blooms from between his lips. Light starts to unfurl just beneath his skin, a vibrating bloom of white-gold radiance.
It’s nearly his height, but a lot less bulky, and he manages to duck past the blade, grab it by the shoulder, and hip-check it into the nearest wall before spinning to parry a slice from yet another elf-thing. It’s complete and utter pandemonium in the war room; he catches glimpses of Sam and Cas wrestling with a pair of squat bearded beings in leaf armor, and in a corner Jack is clobbering a wispy sprite-creature over the head with what looks like the left gable of his gingerbread house.
"Dean?" he whispers. Fights down the wild hope that unfurls suddenly inside him.
stupid. This because I missed your last couple thousand birthdays?”
who it is that makes you happy."
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches sight of Eileen drawing her machete in an easy, fluid motion. He takes an instant to be infinitely grateful that she’d turned down the vampire hunt to come with them on what’s basically been a weird, tense, interdimensional botanical field trip.
Dean closes his eyes and exhales, a tiny gasp. His heartbeat is thunderous, filling the room with its rapid-fire drumming.  "Please fucking kiss me aga—"
, no matter how Dean tried to tell himself Cas wasn’t. Human. Couldn’t be. And certainly isn’t now.
, Dean thinks,
"You better fucking come back," Sam says, and stabs him.
It strips him, the crossing. Flays his grace like he's pulling himself through a maelstrom of blades, tears through the immense and intangible form of him like he's a tissue paper being, a creature being butchered for parts. Castiel lets it because he has to—because he can't cling to what he is, if he wants to make it out of this place designed to imprison exactly that. He grips tight to the components of himself that weren't part of the original design—memory, choice, love, everything he wasn't made for, everything he made for himself anyway—and lets the rest go.
“Did you...did you mean it?”
He sputters to a halt. Stares at Sam.
"Nothing," says Dean. "Just—can't believe he's really gone."
had called out a holiday greeting from the sidewalk as they drove past, and damn, Dean still can’t get used to people around town knowing who he is, even if it’s under a fake name.
. The events from the previous night come rushing back and Castiel catches his breath in wonder at it all. He brings his arms up, wraps them around Dean. Breathes in the warm scent of him.
Corin reaches out and puts the tips of his fingers under Dean's chin, tilts Dean's face up toward him. Dean goes with the motion, dropping his eyes so that he isn't meeting Corin's gaze even with his face upturned.
"They're okay, thanks to you, you giant sap," says Dean crossly. His hand tightens around Cas's. "And
Dean wakes up in a motel bed and Sam is crouched over him, staring down at him with eyes like dark coins.
Dean stares determinedly at the floor and holds out the coat. "Uh. Thanks for letting me wear it."
"No, stop, stop, I can't," Dean blurts, pulling away. He hunches over and presses his hands over his eyes. "Fuck."

"I'll be quick," he tells Dean, opening the door. "Try to get some sleep."

The vamp's corpse hits the ground with a lifeless thump. Silence reigns in the empty trailer park. Surrounded by dead vampires, Castiel stands, listening as hard as he can.
"Dean!" Castiel leans in, using his weight to keep Dean from jackknifing off the bed onto the floor. "It's me!"
,” says Chuck. He comes to a halt beside them and tucks his hands into his pockets. “That was the big reveal, boys. You're supposed to have it figured out now."
Dean flushes, aware that Eileen and Sam have both glanced over at him. He can’t miss, either, the way both their stances soften slightly, as though Benny has passed some kind of test just by virtue of declaring loyalty to
“Jesus,” says Dean. “We really ripped up the ending for good this time, huh?”
"I think..." he says again. He lifts Cas's hand to his mouth, presses a kiss to Cas's knuckles. Glances over at the clearing behind them, again. Picks the first thing off what he intends will be a very long list. "I think I want to build you a house, Cas."
For forty-eight hours after—after Cas, after he—

It’s too goddamn late, he realizes. Because Cas said
Castiel stutters to a halt, mid sentence.
"Nope, nuh-uh." She pulls to a halt, crosses her arms. "I don't do off-site visits, hon. That's how you get dead. Or worse."
“Glad you made it,” Dean tells her, when Sam finally sets her down.
holy fire." Castiel conjures up the memory of Corin's smug voice and grimaces. "And I surmised that if he could have killed me instantaneously he would have. Why risk the chance that I'd track him down again, however slight? So he had to have been refraining because he knew it might not kill me before I could cross the room." He shrugs. "I took a gamble that I'd last to the parking lot."
Cas parts his lips, like he’s about to speak, but instead his mouth just trembles and his hand goes still on Dean’s face, so that he’s just cupping it against Dean’s cheek. His breath ghosts over Dean’s mouth. He smells like the air right before a storm. Dean shivers, though not from cold, and thinks about how they’re all finally free, and maybe this is the first moment he can actually do something with that.
The gentle confidence in Jack's expression wavers. His mouth wobbles a little.
"You can do anything, I'll take the polyp again, I'll—" He can hear himself babbling, hear the words tumbling desperately from his lips. His breath hitches; he fights down the urge to retch again. "Just don't touch my wings,
"Dean—"

"Jody, what is going—"

I do."
"I thought," Castiel tries, but Dean strides forward, jabbing his finger at the air between them as if personally offended by it.
Cas, can't keep himself from helplessly running the tips of his fingers over the delicate bones in Cas's face with something that's half reverence and half despair.
“Please,” he says again. He takes a step forward, lifting his hands, almost in supplication. He doesn’t know if whatever harebrained plan Michael has hatched is going to work, but if he can—if Chuck can bring back Cas, at least—
"Wh—oh,
"Yeah? I'd better stick around, then." Dean straightens up and smirks, just a little, at Cas. "Doesn't seem like you're making much progress without an expert around to help."
, because Castiel recognizes him now. It's the dark-haired vampire from Dean's dream, the one who'd pinned Dean down and carved those terrible symbols into him. His hair is shorter, the close-cropped locks framing his face differently, subtly altering its shape, but his smile is just as mocking, his voice just as lilting. But that's impossible, it's

. He'll always want more than what Dean's willing to give. Dean's kindnesses are a trap he doesn't know he's setting, and if Castiel isn't careful, he'll fall again and again.
“You didn’t put your blinkers on just now,” says Sam, bitchily, “so hey, maybe it's that.”
Dean has an arm around him, a hand braced against Castiel's bare chest. Dean is speaking soothingly in his ear. "Cas, relax, Sam's keeping a lookout, we just gotta get your clothes back on and hustle out of here, c'mon."
"Jack, that's—that's great."
Sam remembers that—the stabbing pain in his temples, the awareness that something,
He's not even really speaking to Cas so much as to himself, to both of them. He feels a surge of grief so strong that it threatens to cut his knees out from under him. A thousand missed opportunities ribbon out from the life he left behind on earth, melting into the past like snow. All the ways in which he could have built a home with Cas, on earth, and never did.
, and if you—if you were worried—if that was why—that's gone now. You don't have to—"
Dean goes hot all over, then cold. The sparking lights, the crash and snarl of breaking glass. Sense memory rears its head in his brain and he hears his own breath begin to stutter like a faulty record.
"McGinnis shot me in the knee. I told the angel to save his grace, but he healed me anyway."
Dean screams, or maybe Castiel screams, a sound that's cut off by a hand over his mouth, as the dark-haired vampire hisses, "You make a shitty prisoner, sweetheart. So from now on you're just our blood bag. This is the last thing you'll ever hear, so remember it: you're spending the rest of your pathetic life in this room with us. You're never getting out. You don't have a name. You don't have a body. You're a fucking meal in a skin and we own you."

has to get back with the flower.”
“Holy shit,” says Dean, and he steps forward, catches Benny’s sleeve to yank him into a rough hug. Feels Benny’s arm like a steel band across his spine as Benny hugs him back; feels the scrape of Benny’s stubble dragging against his cheek. Benny is solid against him, all corded muscle and the clean sharp smell of the forest, and underneath it the metallic undertone of blood, the violent terroir that clings to everything in Purgatory. God, it shouldn’t feel so familiar, but it does. Dean presses his palm against Benny’s shoulder blade, holds on for an instant.
"Get me out," Dean gasps. His arms have found their way around Castiel's neck somehow; Dean's face is buried in his collarbone. "Please, Cas, get me out

Dean chokes. His heart is a wave, breaking on a shore. His heart is back in the storeroom with Cas's earnest voice confessing things that no one should ever confess to Dean. His heart is in pieces, held between Sam's giant palms.
Dean whirls, catching sight of Sam and Eileen spinning round as well. The vampire at the far edge of the clearing keeps walking toward them, unruffled by the fact that Eileen’s machete swings immediately up to aim in the direction of his throat.
But part of him, deep down, is almost
Dean doesn't move when Castiel approaches, or when Castiel drops to his knees beside him. Dean's head is lolling forward onto his chest, his breathing shallow and uneven. He's still wearing the t-shirt he'd been wearing on that hunt in Louisiana, though it's bloodstained and filthy now and the flannel overshirt is nowhere to be seen. His arms are stretched over his head, the wrists manacled individually to the rail above him.
"Don't what?"
"Dean," Chuck coos. "Just give in to it. Come on, shoot me. You'll be free."
"So, we doing this, or you gonna keep brooding?" Cherry rubs her arms, bounces up and down in place. "Getting kind of cold over here."
"Drink," he says, holding out one of the bottles of water. Dean takes it and Castiel rummages through the bags, pulling out the first aid supplies. When he looks up, Dean is still hunched over the unopened bottle, his hand shaking as he tries to break the seal on the cap, his jaw knotted tight.
"I wasn't willing to watch you die!"
“Yeah?” says Sam absently. He’s in the passenger seat skimming some kind of digital park brochure on his tablet. Eileen would normally be with them on this sort of thing, but she’s away for a few days, driving east to deliver some spell components to a shaman friend in New Orleans.
"You already healed me," says Dean, gesturing to himself with a grand, flippant sweep of his arm that dislodges Castiel's hand. "I'm fine. Are there burgers in that bag, by the way?"
Michael inclines his head slightly in their direction, and vanishes.
Dean swears softly under his breath. He rocks forward on the bed, and for a moment Castiel braces, ready to take his weight, but Dean doesn't lean into him, just bows his head and sits, quiet, his body angled towards Castiel.
“Yeah, and you didn’t have a

lay, Cas,
"What are
"SAM!" he yells over his shoulder. "Down here, under the trapdoor!"
Dean exhales. He feels dizzy, which could be blood loss or could be the weight of everything he just said, slipping off of his chest like melting snow.
He moves his fingers up to Castiel's collarbone. The absence of pain is almost dizzying; Castiel groans in spite of himself, arching his back, tilting his head back to press his throat against Raz's fingers, shaking with relief as more and more of the slug's ooze is neutralized by the salve.
Dean stares at the blade, swallows convulsively, takes it. He holds it for a moment, his expression strained. "I want—" he says, and stops.
"I'm sorry," says the angel, looking contrite. "I didn't mean to let the memories spill over like that, into you."
"Come on, Dean," says Coren again. "Bare for me, now." He glances at Castiel. "Or watch the angel burn."
He's remembering Cas's wings. The charcoal feathers, the way they'd shimmered even ragged and torn as they were, dark under the fluorescent kitchen lights.
Belatedly, Dean remembers how much of a foodie the original Death was. Shit. “You been, uh, doing a worldwide food tour, then?”
"No," says Dean vehemently. "No hospitals, I don't—I can't—" He hunches over, his pulse spiking, the sound thunderous in Castiel's ears.
Dean reaches up, and Castiel arches his back as Dean slides his palms over black and silver feathers alike, pulling away the last of the gauze.
Relief wars with a sudden, spine-snapping sense of anguish.
"Can't...m'blood. Keep it clean. He...they said." Dean seems even less lucid than he'd been earlier, his voice slurred and his head tipped lazily to one side.
"We don't have anywhere to go," says Castiel, amused. "We can stay in bed."
, and he can't do it. He's a coward and always has been but maybe Cas can be brave for both of them, one more time. "I need you to
“Fuck—DEAN!”
"Can't believe we haven't met before," says Castiel easily. "You guys never came to any of my parties?"
The Bunker's lights are warm and gold.
God, he thinks, he’d almost missed this, the feel of adrenaline blitzing through his veins, the chance to watch Cas in action, all deftness and speed and controlled ferocity. Not that he wouldn’t have preferred an uninterrupted Christmas with his family, if given the choice, but still—silver linings.
Sam stares at him with wide, uncomprehending eyes.
"He loved me too," he says, finally. It tears at his throat, the sentence. "He told me so, right before the Empty took him." It's a knife in his gut, twisting up towards his heart, flaying him from the inside out.
"Child's play with you so near, even before I'd pinpointed the exact location. Really stupid of you not to leave this place immediately. But then, I imagine you thought you were safe."
And Castiel would—
“How could I not love you?” Cas’s voice is a shaky whisper against his temple, but his palms are warm and steady and certain. Dean presses his face into the collar of Cas’s coat. “I told you, Dean. I know who you are. How could I know you and not love you?”
"Oh, there is one place," says Michael.
with it all. To have Cas look him in the eyes and just say the words, just take back what he'd said, just tell Dean that
"Don't what?" Castiel has the frustratingly familiar sense that he isn't doing what Dean wants, that he's messing up, somehow, but he has no idea what exactly the failure is. Only a few minutes ago, with the storm raging outside and his arms around Dean, it felt as though he knew exactly what to say to meet Dean's needs, and now he's floundering again, unsure what to say or do. At least he recognizes the pattern, anyway—this disjointed rhythm of alternating understanding and bewilderment that seems to govern all his interactions with Dean.
Cas doesn't move at all. Dean doesn't even think Cas is breathing. That's fine; Dean doesn't think he's breathing either. The light glitters gold in Cas's eyes, in his lashes.
"It's going to be alright, Dean," says Castiel. "I need you to trust me."
“Almost didn’t,” she laughs, pushing her hair back from her face. “Some jerk took my car while I was gone.”
Corin is whispering something to Dean, his mouth pressed up against Dean's ear, smearing the side of Dean's face with his own blood. Whatever he's saying, it's too muffled for Castiel to hear, but he can watch the way the oily black poison of it sinks into Dean's soul.
Cas begins to scream almost immediately, eyes rolling wildly beneath their lids. His body thrashes against the belts and Sam grunts as he has to lean all his weight onto Cas's shoulders to keep the angel from jack-knifing up against the restraints. Dean keeps his eyes fixed determinedly downward, and keeps going.
The thing is, Dean thinks, Cas is wrong about him.
of Dean, the blaze of his soul, is nearly overwhelming.
He wonders if Cas left the Bunker the instant he was brought back. Brushed off his coat, took one of the cars, and just...left. Or maybe Cas just asked Jack to snap him right to Jody's. Pluck him out of the Empty and deposit him somewhere,
Dean is babbling incoherently. "Cas, please, I can't—" His voice breaks. "It's—it's dark—they—I can't see,
He supposes, for all that he'd fought not to give up hope throughout the last six months, he'd lost a lot of it, just as Sam had, drained away with every false lead and dead end. Maybe it makes sense, since he'd also lost the one thing he'd put his faith in over all these years.
Dean finds himself able to speak again, though his limbs are still locked rigidly in place. “No,” he rasps, disbelieving.

“It wasn’t us that time, right?” says Sam. He shrugs. “It’s not like we had another weird weapon stashed in the back seat—”
"Dean," Cas sighs, and Dean freezes, wondering if his frantic thoughts are slipping into inadvertent prayer. "Dean, I know what you did for me."
Castiel plummets through a brief and sudden darkness, Dean falling away from him. He expects to wake with Dean on the bed in the motel room, but instead his feet impact something solid and he rocks and blinks and looks around him in surprise.
Dean hears himself make a single choked sound. The pain under his ribs spikes again and it's not as bad, not

"Guess I should be glad you picked up so much from Rowena," says Dean. He unzips his jacket. "Alright, let's get this show on the road."

"Dad didn't—" Dad didn't know. Of

"I won't forget him," Dean says again.
Castiel lays down a towel and drains the infected wounds as best as he can, dousing them with isopropyl alcohol and covering them in squares of gauze. He is grateful for the little first aid he'd learned from the Winchesters in past years, but wishes he'd paid more attention even to that. More than that, he wishes Sam were around, with his steady hands, the calm efficiency built out of years playing field doctor in motel rooms like this one. Dean hisses at the first splash of isopropyl, and grabs for Castiel's coat with his free hand, burying his fingers in the fabric.
"You should," says Sam carefully, "maybe—"
Castiel does move, then; he twists gracefully to catch Dean around the waist and roll him over, onto his back. Castiel comes down on top of him, angling his wings to balance. He braces himself on his forearms so that his face is inches above Dean's.
"Hey!" objects Cherry.
I'm broken, alright?" Dean hisses. "You healed me but you can't heal everything, Cas, okay, and—and I'm a fucking mess and I know that and I know you can barely fucking stand to be in the same

The Winchesters aren't angels, and they aren't demons. They can't snap their fingers and heal him, or undo all the damage, physical or otherwise, that he sustained during his captivity. But they did find him. They did come for him. And they do lift him carefully to his feet, and dress him when his hands shake too much to do it himself, and skim their fingers over the worst of his visible injuries in gentle, worried appraisal, and hold him steady when he stumbles, and lead him out of Hell, and take him home.
, is all he can think.
"Great plan," Dean mumbles. He starts tracing patterns onto Castiel's stomach with his fingertips. Castiel presses a kiss to the top of Dean's head and wonders if he's still in a dream, if he's going to wake up any minute and lose this, all of this.
“Ah...short elderly lady, stylish hats, carried a handbag? The Men of Letters captured her before we inherited the Bunker, we didn’t know she was stuck here until a couple months ago.”
And he doesn't want to see Dean.
"Killed you?" Dean says, his voice hollow. "And you knew that, didn't you? You were just going to—die, and leave me there?"
She stares at him, her eyes wide, looking disarmed for the first time. "What?"
"Come on, Sam," Dean says, punching Sam lightly on the shoulder. Cornfields race past, just beyond the window. "It's Seger—you can't
." Dean's voice rises in pitch, breaking at the end of the word. "Cas you said you killed them all you said you SAID—"
Dean tries to ignore the lump in his throat, but he feels the warning prickle of oncoming tears, nevertheless. Because what is he supposed to do with that?
"Damn right," says Dean, and he reaches up to catch Cas's hand in his own. He entwines their fingers. "Never again."
"Yeah, and then he

. I told you the sigils would make it impossible for you to hide."
—and then Dean is arching his back, gasping out a ragged breath that unspools from the base of his chest all the way out into the open air, because Cas has his jeans open, has his hand down Dean's boxers and curling around Dean's—
"I am not kidding."
Castiel reaches out and brushes his fingers over the dark substance. It feels smooth and slightly tacky, like a sort of polymer or epoxy. He doesn't have a chance to investigate further; the touch seems to break through some barrier inside Dean, who wrenches violently away, flinging himself off the bed onto the dingy carpet below. Castiel lunges in an attempt to catch him and is met with a sharp pain in his shin as Dean lands a kick out of what must be sheer luck.
There's a beat of silence, as they both stare into the distance, contemplating—well, Dean doesn't know what Sam's contemplating. Life, probably. Life with Eileen, now that they're free of the supreme puppet-master overlord. As for Dean, he's determinedly contemplating nothing at all, thank you very much.
, Sam!" Dean clenches his hand around the empty bottle to keep it from shaking. He can't stop seeing it in his head. Cas's face. The Empty. Cas just—dissolving. Melting into nothing, as if he'd never existed. It plays on loop in his head.
"Dean, about..." Sam says. "About what Cas said."
“Sam, watch it!” Dean yells. He fires, but his own aim is haphazard, his trigger finger too frantic—
He throws open the storage room door and looks around, panting.
"Okay, okay," Dean soothes. "Okay, lie on your stomach, hang on."
“I...” Jack says. At least he’s stopped trying to back out of the room. He moves a few steps closer and then just stops in the middle of the kitchen, his arms hanging awkwardly by his sides. “I didn’t want to bother you.”
Benny snorts. “Everything in a fifty-mile radius felt that portal open up, even if most probably didn’t recognize what it was. Now, your angel, on the other hand—
He gets cut off as Cas pulls him into another kiss. Dean revels in it, the syrup-slow lightning of their mouths, the heat that lances down his spine when Cas’s tongue slides against his. Cas tips his head and kisses the corner of Dean’s mouth, then up along the edge of his jaw, and
torn up about it, partly because everyone else is also wearing their own awful variant on the theme, but mostly because in return he’s forced Sam to don an antler headband that’s easily adding six inches to his height.
Dean’s on his feet in an instant, cursing himself for not having his gun at hand. He snatches the scimitar off its display stand and charges into the war room, only to skid to a halt at the sight of what he can only describe as a dozen honest-to-god fucking forest elves teeming around the map table with high-pitched battle cries.
a favor. Y’all can tag along.”
He does it anyway. Goes for the weakest-looking one, head-butting him hard in the face and then lashing out with a kick. The impact is solid and gets a cry of pain out of his target, but the other three are upon him in an instant. The female seizes his cuffed arms; Raz goes straight for his hair, grabbing a handful of it and wrenching Castiel's head back. The demon he'd head-butted is swearing furiously.
Castiel lifts the angel blade again, holding it out towards Dean. "Put your hand on mine."
. “But why would we—wouldn't we talk to—”
"Yeah, Cas." Dean grips Cas tighter, clenching at the fabric of Cas's coat. "God, I thought I'd...I thought I'd never..."
"So...they’re all blank now?”
The smirk grows even more, and
"So...what?" says Dean, and he registers with painful clarity that his heart is suddenly skipping a beat, that there's an abrupt swell of panic making his throat close up. "You...you didn't mean it?"
"Of course it was your name," says Cas, fondness and exasperation swelling in his voice. "You fucking idiot."
He raises himself up on his hands again, so that he can stare down at Dean. The rainbowy light that plays off his feathers is speckling Dean's face with flecks of color; it mingles with the soft gold radiance of the lamp and with the shadows cast by the wings themselves, a tangle of light and dark and color on Dean's skin. Castiel shivers, overcome by an intensity of feeling that he can't quite put words to. God help him, he is going to give Dean Winchester the world.
Cas slides his fingers through Dean's. "You're right," he says. "I had a damn shitty idea of happiness."

? Chuck’s still pulling the strings, and the world is still gone.
Now Dean is standing in the middle of the room, arms above his head,
The light from the basement only stretches halfway down the steps, so Dean fumbles his phone out and turns the flashlight on one-handed. The space he's descending into is small, an oubliette of sorts, the featureless walls melting into their own gloom, and there's a pale shape near the bottom of the stairs.
, and something snaps loose inside of Dean.
, and he’s just standing there, in those strange dark clothes, with that ring on his hand and with power rippling invisibly off him like a silent maelstrom.
"Sammy," Dean whispers. He puts his hands over his ears, moves them to his face. Presses his knuckles against his eyes. "I can't do this."
," says Sam, in the tone he reserves for when Dean is being particularly dense. "And it has to be heavy."

"I love you," Dean says, firmly, and it's like strings are being cut loose in his chest. Tension he didn't know he'd been carrying, for years maybe, easing free, sliding away like a tide going out. Cas doesn't
He grins at his brother. "Sam—"
Dean laughs wetly, pulls back a few inches so he can look Cas in the eyes. "What, you thought I was just going to leave you in there? In a fucking void-dimension? You goddamn idiot."

Dean raises his eyebrows at Cas—he thinks that might be the gift he and Sam had picked out for Jack, actually, and Cas was supposed to
Jack looks guilty, his shoulders already climbing towards his ears as he hunches in on himself. Dean thinks it might be a habit he picked up from Sam. It catches him off-guard, sometimes, how Jack is a conglomeration of all their mannerisms.
It strikes him that Cas must have known, too. The way Cas knew everything about Dean. Cas knew everything about Dean and he still—he still said those things—
"I'm so sorry," says Castiel. "I thought..." He scrubs at his face, suddenly tired. "You had to drive all this way..."
The gunshot rings out like the toll of a bell, echoing across the empty parking lot.
“Unless,” says Dean. “Unless you put the world back.”
“The world, huh?” he says. Jesus, maybe he's getting sentimental in his old age.
, with a festering, acrid heat he can almost taste on the back of his tongue. The slug continues to inch slimily across his chest. He rolls onto his stomach and contorts his body on the floor, desperate to scrape the metallic substance off somehow, but for all the good his frantic efforts do, the gold streaks might as well be tattoos.
holy fire," Castiel whispers to himself, and in a split second he makes his decision, furls his wings in close, and launches all the divine intent and mortal flesh of himself through the green flames.
“Tracked you from the portal,” says Benny. He nods at Sam. “Wound like that, you’re easy to find—not that your blood smells anything
When Sam starts shuffling from foot to foot with all the subtlety of a 6'5" abominable snowman in a china shop, Dean figures he's gearing up to have a heart-to-heart with the kid. Leave it to Sammy to wait all of five minutes before diving into the touchy-feely stuff.
Dean stares at Castiel for a moment and then exhales, the fight draining visibly out of him. His soul settles, though it still pulses with muted bronzes and reds.
Cas makes an aborted noise, low and unmoored in the back of his throat. “Please,” he rasps. His head drops low. His palms are pressed against the earth. “Please, Dean, if you only believe one thing, believe that I’ve always wanted to stay with you.”
"Wait," blurts Dean. Castiel turns, his hand on the knob. Dean still hasn't moved.

He reaches out, horrified and alarmed, but Dean jerks away from the brush of Castiel's fingers and curls in on himself.
, the sound is the loudest thing in the world.
"I searched for you for six months," says Castiel quietly. "I never believed you were dead. Sam and I never stopped looking."
"They—left?" Cas squints around the room, holding the blanket against his now-unmarked stomach with his free hand. "The other people who were trapped here? Are they..."
It occurs to him that he could

Dean stills. He resists, with a masterful exertion of willpower, the urge to throw his beer at Sam's giant head. "Don't."
"Save your breath, sweetheart," Corin laughs. He yanks open the door and shoves Dean forward.
, you shouldn't have had to give that up, I should've—I should've been able to—"
"Of course I came. Why the hell wouldn't I?"
"You're not healed yet," Dean protests.
They sit on the Impala's hood and watch the sun set across the lake, drowning everything in fuchsia and crimson. Dean clinks his beer against the one in Cas's hand. "So," he says. "There's still a lot of Heaven work to do, you said? Rebuilding stuff with Jack."
Castiel gestures aimlessly, lets his rambling explanation trail off. "...yes?"
"Cas—"
"Well, why the hell did you? Why d'you always have to be so noble?" Dean demands. "Why couldn't you be selfish for once? Why didn't you just

Cas tips his head up, surveys Dean. "I meant it," he says softly. "I meant it more than anything I've ever meant in my whole life. I just...what I mean to say now is, I didn't intend to make you uncomfortable. It wasn't my intention to invoke a...a response from you. And I wouldn't have...I wouldn't have..."
“None of it was real,” says Sam, quietly. “Was it.”

The kitsune girl steps forward. Dean stares at her, bewildered. She isn't looking at him—she's looking down at the angel on the table, her eyes unreadable. She reaches out and puts a palm on Cas's arm.
"Great. S'not keeping them from hurting, that's for fucking sure."
In the library, Eileen and Sam have about 6 gallons of popcorn overflowing out of all of Dean’s good serving bowls and they are stringing it together on yards and yards of thread, signing at each other and snickering between kernels. The floor is a mess of tiny popcorn fragments, because Dean apparently lives with friggin' animals.
"See, but you don't, though," says Dean. "Or you'd know that I'm in love with you too, you dumbass."
"If it helps," says Raz off-handedly, "you can pretend I'm Dean." He drops his hand onto the curve of Castiel's left wing, gripping a fistful of burned nerve endings and torn feathers, and twists.
"Of course," says Castiel. He holds out the bills and she nips them out of his hand, tucks them away with the phone. Her thoughts are echoing loudly in her skull and he can see, as plainly as if it's written across her face, that she's lying; she isn't texting anyone, there's no one to fight for her, no one who would miss her if she were to vanish some lonely night after work. The part about the brother is true, or mostly true—he doesn't live in the state, she hasn't spoken to him in years. Castiel can feel this girl's pride, though, thrumming through her at the memory of her baby brother who was always so good with cars, and his own heart aches a little in response.
“Sam,” he yells, over the crescendo of light and sound. “Sam, we have to remember them this time. We have to remember Cas—"
Castiel attempts to turn the meatball package sideways. "I rebuilt your body from scratch, Dean," he says distractedly. "It hasn't changed much in size since then."
"Cas," he says, "where's—"
with all of this, with Dean's stubbornness and pride and self-loathing, with his own inability to fix this situation, with Sam's enduring silence. He is tired of having to pry every scrap of information out of Dean like it's a confession, tired of having to force every gesture of aid or comfort into Dean's clenched fists as if it's a burden. He is tired of not being to help not because he can't but because Dean won't
"I prayed to you," Dean blurts. Something warm and wet touches Castiel's hand where it rests between Dean's face and the bed, and he realizes that Dean is crying silently, hot tears that go rolling sideways across his face to land on Castiel's palm. "I prayed to you so many times, Cas, and you never—and I thought that maybe you just—that you—"
"Good boy," Corin says, as his fangs slide out, and then he bends and bites deep into the side of Dean's throat. Dean cries out, his eyes snapping open. His body jerks convulsively, like a marionette on strings, but Corin holds him tightly even as blood starts to trickle down Dean's throat and chest, along the gentle curve of his belly, soaking the hem of his boxers. It's a brutal, excessive feeding, ugly in its violence—even over the crackling flame, Castiel can hear the wet sounds of Corin's lips sealing over the wound, hear the way the soft tissues of Dean's throat are shredding around Corin's fangs.
Under the bone-pale skin of Cas's abdomen, where his ribcage gives way to the curve of his sunken belly, something moves.
"I know you want me to suffer," says Cas, "making me relive these memories. But I think..." He studies Dean. "I think you don't realize that I was always reliving them, already. Over and over."
"Right," says Dean. "Because they're all alike, aren't they? Some writer. You're just rewinding the tape and hitting play."
"Hey, hey," says Dean again. He catches Sam's wrists, pulls his hands gently apart. It comes to him, then, the answer, or what might be. "Remember them. Cas. Eileen. Jack. Everyone."
like he's about to fall over, so he risks putting one hand back on Cas's cheek, using his thumb to smear away the solitary tear. "I love you, and you're an idiot."
Dean flinches violently at the first touch, but he stays where he is, head lowered and hands white-knuckled on the asphalt. He doesn't resist when Castiel lifts him in his arms again, although his breathing gets louder and faster, taking on the cadence of barely controlled panic. He doesn't speak, either—remains as silent as he'd been during the drive to the motel, his soul shifting restlessly, like a trapped bird. He feels feather-light in Castiel's arms, a sharp reminder of how inherently fragile the human body is. Castiel's superiors would have chided him about needing such a reminder, once.
"That's it?" says Dean.
"You, uh...you blew it out, dude. When you, when you came. Streetlight outside, too."
, he types into the header of a new posting.
"You'll stay?" says Dean, feeling like a goddamn middle-schooler asking his crush out to the school dance. "With...with me?"
like it was the simplest thing in the world. Dean doesn't get to
Dean goes cold all over. Because Sam can't. Sam can't know. There's no way he could know. Dean was
"Goddammit," says Dean, his eyes on Castiel's mouth. "Yes, you idiot."
"I'm here," Castiel assures him. "You're safe. I'm here."
Two of the vampires have him pinned on his back while the third straddles him, holding him in place by virtue of sheer weight, but Dean continues to wrench against his captors' grips with dogged determination. His face is streaked with dirt and blood; it looks like there might be grit embedded in his cheek.
So Castiel slips his hand up under Dean's shirt, feeling the fiery heat of Dean's skin beneath, the sparks of white and rose-pink flying off his soul, the hammering of Dean's human heart. Dean props himself up on his elbows so that he can get his arms out of the garment as Castiel pulls it over his head.
, it's so
, he thinks, to no one in particular, and sucks in a shuddering breath, hears himself whimper involuntarily as it catches on the broken rib. With his other hand, he swats feebly at his pockets, but doesn’t feel the shape of his phone—it must have fallen out. Sam. He needs to get to Sam. The wendigo—if it follows his scent back up the trail, it’ll find Sam—it’ll kill Sam—
"How do we
Dean remembers light, darkness. Grief like a sucking wound in his chest. "Yeah."
Castiel is clearing out a nest of vampires when he feels it, a faint brush against the invisible edge of an outstretched wing, feather-light like a whisper of snow: the unmistakable touch of Dean Winchester's soul.
Dean slides slowly down the wall. He must look like a child afraid of a storm, huddled in a corner with his head in his arms.
can't enter." Jack's mouth quirks in a wry smile. "The Empty is...even older than God. There are cosmic rules that govern it. Rules even I can't break." He glances over to the table, where Sam is bent over a yellowed scrap of parchment. "But I can bend them, with your help."
Dean will become the sword he was built and born to be, and not to save the world or to destroy Lucifer.
, he's telling the truth,” says the antennaed fey in front of Dean, their voice high and lilting. The tendrils around their face sway slightly towards Sam, as if reacting to the sound of his voice; the motion makes Dean think inexplicably of reeds in a river.
"You—think I don't want to be around you?" says Castiel slowly. The absurdity of it almost leaves him winded, and he has the sudden, ridiculous urge to laugh out loud.
“Dean, it’s alright. I’ve got you.”
"Dammit, Sam," he growls under his breath, because it'd been Sam who reached out over McGinnis's corpse to unlock the cage door. The girl might've hated McGinnis but at the end of the day she's still a monster with no reason to leave two hunters alive. Sam and his bleeding heart are going to get everyone killed some day.
Dean holds his breath, reaching up slowly with one hand to lay it against the most uninjured spot he can find. Cas makes the tiniest hitching sound in the back of his throat, his eyes still determinedly fixed on the ground. The feathers feel silk-soft under Dean's palm, the rain running in cold rivulets down from the wing to drip onto his shoulder.
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “You ever—think about spending more of your time coordinating? Assigning cases, checking up on people, helping out with the lore. Instead of—I dunno, being out in the field all the time.”
"I know." Gadreel smiles, a real smile this time, without a trace of the sadness that so often plagues his expressions. "But for the first time in a long time, I am less concerned with what is out of my reach than with what I currently have."
. Driving your stupid little car on a highway with no end, having the same tired conversations and letting your thoughts carve grooves into your little skulls—
Castiel has crouched humble and lowly before the Host of heaven, and he has been drained dry and cast down to Earth by the Metatron, and he has felt Lucifer's crushing grip grind him into slow oblivion, but nothing has ever made him feel as small and helpless as the way his pleas bounced off Dean's determined gaze.
Cas, who had opened his mouth after Dean’s first sentence, closes it again and furrows his brow in thought. “Not long,” he says finally. “This...becoming, it takes time.”
Castiel reaches out with his free hand and presses his palm against Dean's forehead. He waits to see the injuries fade, the torn skin knitting itself back together, but the rush of his grace is blocked by—
"You were...real," says Cas, slowly, like he's still wrapping his head around the fact. Dean can feel Cas's fingers digging into his shoulders.
Dean opens his mouth. He scrapes together whatever courage he has left and leans forward.
Castiel shakes his head in panic. "I can't leave," he whispers, panicked. Raz has touched his wings. Raz will find him. Castiel will lead him right to the Winchesters. "You have to leave me, you can't take me with you, Raz will, he'll find me, he'll—"
They've just filled up the Impala at a gas station two days from Washington, but Dean hesitates as he slides the key into the ignition. He has the absurd thought that the shadows around them look all wrong. The windows are up, but it feels like a cold breeze is stirring the hairs on the back of his neck. He resists the urge to look behind him, into the back seat. Why would he look in the back seat?
Dean chooses this moment to fling himself out of bed, rolling across the floor and coming up on one knee, pistol aimed squarely at the vampire. Where and when had Dean gotten a gun? Castiel recognizes it as the one he keeps in his duffel of supplies, but that's sitting on the floor across the room, so Dean must have taken the weapon out at some earlier point. Has probably had it under his pillow this whole time. Old habits die hard.
." Dean hears shuffling, hears a door slamming—Jody getting into or out of a car. "He just

“Chuck,” Sam whispers. “But—how—”

"No," says Michael. "It is because reapers work in Death's library. Because they are near Death, touched by Death,
Cas's face clouds over, like the sky before a storm. "Ah," he says quietly. "I understand the point she was trying to make."
, Cas, thank god you're o—" the hallucination glances at the wreckage of Castiel's vessel and has the decency to look chagrined, "—well, actually you look like crap, but—
Dean gasps, curling his fingers deep into the feathers. Castiel finds himself echoing the sound as warmth blossoms in his wing, his grace sparking blissfully under Dean's touch.
Sam sniffs again, nods jerkily into his shoulder. Dean rubs a soothing circle into Sam's back.
"Why," Dean pants, "why are you—wearing
reading before Dean came in. He looks at Dean patiently, and he waits.
, but. If he couldn't be brave enough to chase the things he wanted while he was alive, maybe his own literal death is the kick in the ass the universe figured he needed.
Somehow Dean forces down the panic crowding the base of his throat; somehow he pulls Cas to his feet, keeps one hand on his elbow to support him while he turns back to face the fray. There’s three elf-creatures arrayed in front of him now—one that he was just fighting, another who has a literal flaming sword in its weird green hands, and a tall one with waving antennae and fingertips that are starting to glow in a way that cannot possibly bode well for Dean.
“You and me, Sammy,” says Dean. He claps Sam on the back and they head for the garage.
, he thinks.
"Only if, y'know." The slightest intimation of a shrug from Castiel. "If you want."
“Oh,” says Antennae, their face clearing, “you’re speaking of She-of-the-Rainwater-Brook-under-Oak-Leaves-in-the-Summerlight-of-Noon,” and they turn around and burble something indecipherable to the other fey, all of whom relax immediately.
of them—is hot and swollen under his fingers. He curses himself for not having any first aid supplies on hand, but then, how could he have known he would need them?
"Sure. No rush, right?"
Dean manages to hold that blue gaze for all of about three seconds before his nerve fails him and he looks away.
Dean thinks he can, sort of, see another version of himself, some past iteration of his psyche, taking this differently. A world diverging from this timeline like a tributary off of a river. There's a world, a path, an option, in which the
“And I saw how you were with the other hunters, too,” Dean adds. “You’re a good leader, Sam. They trust you. And they should.”
, except he’s—he’s also in Death’s clothes, wearing Death’s ring, with eyes that are—
A body crashes onto the floor of the cell, head bouncing against the stones with a sickening crunch, face still contorted into a grimace. Castiel jerks away in shock. It's Raz; his eyes are open and sightless, his short hair matted to the side of his face. The wound in his chest is still emitting a few half-hearted red-gold sparks.
“Dean,” says Cas, for a third time. He doesn’t move his hands.
Dean steels himself. Nods. "Do it."
has been a privilege I never thought to earn."
"I know," says Dean, and his expression is suddenly so fierce and so achingly tender that Castiel has to fight the reflex to look away, to avert his gaze like he's in the presence of something too holy to perceive head-on. Dean's thumb strokes, again, over the edge of Castiel's face, like the brush of a wing. "I know you're still you. Always. I'm just saying—you had to sacrifice all that power to save my ass, and I'm not—"
Chuck laughs in their faces. “So you’re throwing in with the humans, Michael? I gotta say, even for you, this is pretty
"Yeah, they're for seeing
," says Dean.
“Alright, ENOUGH!”
A laugh punches out of Dean, a sound that's half a sob. He curls down over Castiel, a movement that brings his face closer, and Castiel
Like a malicious film recording, the image of Dean's face when he saw Castiel's wings keeps replaying in his head. The dismay and disgust there. The way Dean hadn't been able to keep from staring at the ruin of what Castiel once was.
"Lube," Castiel pants. "
Dean's learned a little more about Gadreel since then. In his more irritable moments he thinks that of
Dean surprises himself with the laugh that bubbles up from him. He thinks he's only heard himself make that exact laugh when he's around Cas. "It was a compliment. All the best people I know are idiots."
, which is, frankly ridiculous. He wants to make some kind of self-deprecating joke, here, but his throat is tight and hot, and Benny is looking at him with the kind of steady clear gaze that’s too close and too far from the way Cas used to look at him—no, from the way Cas
“Dude, what the fuck,” Sam protests.
Dean will go—into the labyrinth. He’ll run Chuck’s maze, if it spares the world. But not before—not if he has to leave Cas in that place.
“You would have figured something else out,” says Dean. He grins weakly, makes a vague gesture. “I mean, you're a literal horseman of the apocalypse, Cas. You didn’t need us.”
Cas peers up at him, squinting again. His bangs are plastered to his forehead and his mouth has a confused quirk that makes Dean want to kiss it. "You're not...you don't hate them? You don't think I'm—" His forehead creases and he drops his eyes from Dean again.
"Dean—here." Sam, thank
Dean closes the door softly behind him, swallowing hard at the gentle click of the knob. The bedroom isn't as dark as he'd expected it would be; the window blinds are up and an orange-red glow from the streetlamp beyond pours in, painting a ruddy halo around the motionless form stretched out on the narrow bed.
“Yeah.”
Dean squares his shoulders. Sam is plucking frantically at his sleeve. His brain is still stuttering out a pointless tempo of despair and fury, but thankfully his mouth can bite back on autopilot. "Yeah, well, maybe you're not as good at this puppet master shit as you thought you were, huh?"
, he thinks wryly.
He buries his face in his hands, muffling a sob.

, should
, Dean thinks. His hands are still shaking. Of course they are. He's fucking terrified.
"Yes," says Jack for the twentieth time in response, and Dean has to hand it to him, he still sounds extremely sure. "I've tried reaching Cas, but the Empty's hidden him deep within itself. It knows he's been resurrected before and it doesn't want it to happen again."
Castiel focuses on applying antibiotic cream to the wounds on Dean's arm. He wishes, again, that Sam were here. Sam would find the right words to say, the right kind of comfort to give. Castiel, clumsily daubing the ointment onto Dean's broken skin, can't even offer the healing of his grace.
"Kill you? Oh no, Dean, no no no. Let me tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to take you with me, cover your whole fucking body in warding sigils, and nobody, not your angel or God or the Devil himself, is ever going to see you again. I'm going to feed on you for forty years, Dean, I think you can last that long, don't you? It'll be slow, I promise you, it'll be so very slow. And when you're old and grey and empty I'll turn you, and you'll be a monster, just like me."
"Well, he may be a dick, but he's got nice toys," sniggers another demon, tall with thinning hair.
Dean looks up and his brain short-circuits. Cas is crouched next to him, his head cocked in that birdlike way, his hands resting on his knees.
Sam rummages through the glove compartment, pokes a tape into the stereo. The guitar starts up, sweet and lilting and a little wistful. Then Plant’s voice, picking up softly.
"Dean—"
"My choice?" Dean forces out, with numb lips. He pushes himself to his feet, stumbles backward from the table, from Sam. "My
that it felt good for you—"
“Dean—I know you cared for me, before—that you considered me family, but—the way I feel about you, it’s something I know you don’t—” Cas stumbles, his words colliding with each other as he talks faster. “The way I—the way I want you, you
"I know, I know he didn't, but he still—the things he would say—" Sam covers his eyes with one hand. When he pulls it away, there's a tear wobbling in his lashes. "I just—Dean, I'm not Dad. Okay? I just want you to know. I'm

that.
Castiel lets out a sound that's half a laugh, half a sob. He's never been so happy in all his life. "Okay."
His phone rings.
, Dean thinks, viciously.
“You want me to say it again?” Cas's voice drops impossibly lower, almost a snarl. The sunlight turns his eyes a blazing crystalline color, like they might start snapping sparks at any minute. “I love you. I love you, Dean Winchester. It
He takes one last look down at Dean, deeply asleep on the bed. The wounds stand out starkly from his skin, painted yellow-gold as it is by the lamplight. Castiel has a hand half-raised toward them before he catches himself, remembers anew that he's helpless to heal them. He tries anyway, letting his fingertips rest on Dean's forehead, seeking a way in with his grace. It doesn't work, of course. But he ends up standing there all the same, his fingers brushing the feverish heat of Dean's face, reassuring himself that Dean is really there, lying asleep in front of him.
, what they have now, Dean's friendship, their shared home, their family, is enough for Castiel. Has always been enough.
“It’s,” Dean manages. “It’s good to see you.”
Michael surveys the hallway, peers up at the flickering light fixtures with mild disinterest. He has his hands tucked in the pockets of that same dull green jacket he wore the day Sam yanked him into the Cage. "A liminal space, existing outside and around the worlds you know."
"Dean," says Castiel. It occurs to him that this is probably exactly how the sigils were carved in the first place—Dean open and vulnerable under the knifepoint, someone leaning over him, digging a blade into his skin. "We don't have to do this."
, in an equally terrifying way, know that there's something stirring, in the figurative hole that got punched through his chest in the empty storage room mere days ago. It's something immense and tender and too bright for him to look at head-on, which is why he is resolutely
Dean shrugs, his fingers curling into the fabric of the towel, still wrapped around his waist. "Cigarette."
"Right," says Sam. He looks pained. "Well. That's...that's not really a secret, Dean, is it?"
It's never more than the four original demons, for which he is grateful. Most of the time all four of them join in, although there are days they take turns hanging back to jeer at Castiel while egging each other on. He prefers when they come as a group. When Raz comes alone, the torment takes on an edge of intimacy that makes Castiel's skin crawl. He likes to crouch behind Castiel and pull him up close with a hand around his throat, so that Castiel is pressed flush against him while Raz reaches around to trace a knifepoint idly over his chest and stomach.
"Power runs like water," Michael says. “It’s channeling into the next two most powerful beings in creation.”
There’s a crackle of power, too fast and full of whiplike intent to dodge. Dean cries out as pain surges through him like an electric current, dropping him rigidly to his knees. It passes after a moment, but he’s still paralyzed, frozen in place with his eyes fixed helplessly forward and the words trapped in the back of his throat. At the edge of his vision he can see Sam doubled over, straining against the same invisible hold.
"I'm texting my brother," she informs him. "He's a mechanic, he beats up people
. G-E-T. Y-O-U. O-U-T. Dean is utterly motionless beneath him, his head lifted as if he's trying to listen for the sound of the letters.
He still has no idea what the exchange might have been, what Gadreel might have said to Sam and vice versa. But at the climax of their tense car ride back from the hospital, when Dean couldn't take Sam's stony expression and simmering anger any longer, he'd thrown up his hands and snapped, "Okay, Sam, tell him to leave! I can turn this car around and you can kick the bucket back in the coma ward!"
—around Dean, whose gentle pulses of
"And how the fuck are we supposed to do that?"
"Alright, pal," says Dean. "Let's go."

"I want you to do it."
Dean blanches. "What, he just...he just
The dagger blazes gold, under his palm. Dean sighs and lifts his hand to at last scrub it across his face. His knuckles come away damp.
He yanks the wing back, away from Dean, ignoring the pain, ignoring Dean's sudden exhale. He grits his teeth against the cry of loss that goes up somewhere inside him when the electric music of the contact vanishes.
"Oh. Good. Think he'll pick up what you're putting out there?"
"I won't be long," he blurts, and all but runs from the room, grabbing his coat as he passes the bed, Dean's startled protests and the yellow-white recoil of his soul trailing Castiel out the door.
"I'll be alright. I've driven in rain."
"I don't think you need to put anything on them," says Dean around a mouthful of noodles. "They aren't infected, I don't think." He shovels more soup into his mouth.
With it destroyed, there is nothing now veiling the desire that surges under Dean's gaze.
"Yeah, absolutely not."
much right, apparently.
He doesn’t know how long it lasts, the two of them kissing on the warm earth, surrounded by the gold light and the scent of cedar. They break apart finally, just enough for air to wisp between their mouths.

of Dean and Dean's easy smile and the pain that roils underneath it and Castiel's thrumming desire to soothe that pain, to hold Dean close and make him forget anyone else who's ever touched him—

and Dean wants to scream that there is nothing to know, nothing to tease out and unearth here, because how Cas—how Cas feels or felt about him changes nothing, it doesn't mean—it doesn't mean that
"I don't...I couldn't keep track," says Dean. "Of time. Two...or three. Months. I think. I don't..." He hesitates. "Cas, how long...how long was I..."
Cas nods, almost to himself. He looks back at Dean. "I thought it would be easier, for both of us, to treat it as a chapter that was closed. I thought maybe—if I could devote myself to rebuilding Heaven, doing something good, then maybe eventually..."
"Ugh," says Chuck. He grimaces. "Fucking spanner. You know, I never had any problems getting you and Sam to play ball in all the other universes where he just did what he was fucking told."
Castiel jumps out the other side, angry with himself for not moving more quickly. He isn't used to seeing Dean like this, can't remember ever seeing Dean this weak—although that's no excuse for his own carelessness, of course. He drops the keys in his pocket and hurries around to the pickup's other side, where Dean is slumped on his hands and knees.
voice send a little spark of heat all the way down to Dean’s groin, but pie is important enough that he masters himself and swats Cas’s questing hand away.
"Dunno," says Dean. "Apparently Jack brought him back and he asked to be dropped there." He walks past Sam into the kitchen, rummaging through the fridge. It's looking pitifully empty and he jots a mental note to make a grocery run soon. Apocalypse averted and all, but they still gotta eat.
Chuck looks down at the dripping, blue-black hole in his chest. His eyes widen. It's almost comical. "Sh—"
"And hey," he says, taking refuge in humor like a damn coward, which is what he is. "The way you feel—I get it, trust me. I got called a damn beach read by a
. You walk out a door again, we'll find you and we'll cut all the skin off your arms and lick your blood straight off the muscle."
Dean's gaze roves past Castiel's shoulder, over the sparsely furnished room, the mattress that just yesterday had belonged to a dead person. "You know you don't—have to sleep in here."
"I—" Castiel chokes. "I—he—" Out of the corner of his eye, he can see comprehension dawning on Dean's face, and the elder Winchester tightens his arm around him. Castiel forces himself to raise his head and look Sam in the eye, afraid of what he might find there. He can guess at some of the things Raz might have said to Sam, and none of them are good. But Sam meets his gaze evenly, his expression neutral except for a faint crease of worry on his brow, and he directs his next words to Castiel, "Thought you'd like to see his corpse."

Aloud, he repeats, "What the
"I'm so sorry it took this long. But please believe me, Dean, I never would have stopped looking, either. I would have searched for you for as long as it took." Careful not to jostle Dean's many injuries, he shifts his grip so that he can cup the back of Dean's head with one hand. He rests the other hand on Dean's shoulder, where his mark once lay. It's strange to feel the fabric of his own coat beneath his hands, stranger still to know that the warmth underneath the garment is Dean. He realizes that Dean is whispering softly, and strains to catch the faint words.
"What

And a ring.
"Alright, let's be off," says Corin, suddenly brisk. He wipes his mouth on the back of his hand and grabs Dean's shoulder, yanking him to his feet. Dean goes without protest. He sways on his feet, his skin still deathly pale, and Castiel realizes that the feeding wasn't
"I hate this," Dean says through gritted teeth. "I hate that you're seeing me like this. God, you must think I'm—"
Remembering Gadreel's words, Dean grins suddenly and takes a step towards Cas, whose back is to the room as he softly curses the coffee filter in Enochian.
“Yes, Dean.”
for a minute."
"Ask me," says Dean. He drags in a shuddering breath. God, he's afraid. "Ask me, Cas.
Dean looks toward the house and his heart constricts painfully. He'd spent the drive up making small talk with Sam, chatting and laughing and singing along to the radio to keep his mind off their destination. Now that they're actually
"I'll say. He's our kid, alright." Too late, Dean realizes what he's said—he flushes a little, averts his eyes from the unreadable expression suddenly crossing Cas's face.
yes," Corin sighs at last, detaching himself with a smack. He turns to grin at Castiel, the entire lower half of his face dark with blood, and licks his lips suggestively. Castiel barely spares him a thought, focusing instead on the wound in Dean's throat. It looks deep, but the blood pulses only sluggishly; he has to trust the vampire knows how to feed without killing, given the horrific plan for Dean's future he outlined just minutes ago. Nevertheless Dean looks bone-pale, swaying slowly on his knees. His eyes are blank, utterly empty of emotion.
"We're okay," says Dean again, and he's talking to Sam, and to Cas, and to himself, and to the new god in their midst, and—really, to the world at large.
Something brushes against his leg and he realizes that Dean's other hand, resting on the bed, is pressed against Castiel's knee where his leg is folded on the mattress. Dean wets his lower lip, almost unconsciously, and the surge of desire that wells up from his soul is unmistakable.
Cas is still—
to humanity, without trying to control them—” He hesitates. “It’s important,” he says, finally. He touches his own chest, a gesture that looks almost unconscious, and glances at Jack. “And we are more than a little human, ourselves.”
He's being a dick and he knows it, but there's a frenetic buzzing in his head that started the moment Jack showed up and explained this harebrained plan, and it's growing louder with every second. Cas is so close. Cas is

"Cas, hang on," says Sam urgently. Dean can't speak. His hand is—god help him, his hand is

for very long. Dean can't say exactly when he realized how he felt about Cas; he just knows that for what feels like years, it's been thrumming inside his chest, bursting to get out, and when he saw Cas tied to that chair, perfectly still, blood soaking his bare chest—Dean had felt like
"The sigils are to keep me alive. They're keeping me alive. So that I can't—so that I couldn't—"
"Go...to Hell," he manages wearily.
The air still hurts to breathe, feels like sandpaper against his skin, but Castiel finally stumbles to his feet, spurred by a nameless, frantic urgency. He turns his head and sees a dilapidated barn mere yards away, the doors shut. Dread wells up in the hollow spaces of his chest, a fear that he can't name—something terrible has happened here.
"I was a little preoccupied, Dean."
"I mean it, though," Dean insists. "They're freaking amazing. I still can't believe you just...have them coming out of your back like that. They're incredible."
"Dean?"
Cas turns his eyes back to Dean. His other hand is still cradling Dean’s head, holding it off the ground. Dean can feel the light pressure of Cas’s thumb against his temple, and he has to fight the urge to turn his face into it, lean into the pressure.
He catches Cas's eye, over Sam's shoulder. Cas is standing next to Jack, and his eyes are on Dean, and his mouth is still curved into that wondering smile. Dean feels something split in his heart—not painfully, but sweetly, newly. Something soft and growing.
Dean rolls his eyes.“C’mere, handsome.” He hooks his fingers into Cas’s belt to tug him closer. Cas crowds him against the kitchen table, plants insistent kisses against Dean’s chin and the corner of his mouth, and then—Dean stifles a yelp of surprise as Cas tucks broad hands behind his thighs and

you, Dean. I know you the way you know me. I know you the way Cas knows you. I know you the way—the way you won't let yourself know yourself."
Dean stamps over to the center of the room and pulls back an oilcloth rug that is, indeed, covering a small trapdoor. He hauls it open and sees wooden steps, leading down into darkness.
"No, don't you see?" says Castiel, impatient. "It's working both ways. It won't let your body pass into a healed state, either. None of your injuries are fully healed, even the ones that should be by now. And it must be blocking my grace."
"Dean, I've known you your whole life," says Sam, moving closer, his eyes enormous in the warm lamplight. His voice is suddenly achingly, unbearably gentle. "I've watched you with Cas for years. I've watched the way you

He turns around and there Cas is, lying at his feet.
Dean wraps his hands around the steamy cardboard sleeve and sighs happily. Shitty gas station coffee, best way to start a morning on the road. “Nah, didn’t dream at all.”
"You heard me," Dean says, and his voice rises. "Were you ever going to come back? Or were you just going to hide out here playing fixer-upper, forever?"
goes wrong, then you'll be—"
Something hitches in Cas's breath. "I...Dean." His voice is hesitant, still. Doubtful.
"I mean, maybe you should get some sleep," Dean slurs at him. "Take a break. You don't look so good." It's true. Chuck looks—haggard, almost. There are dark hollows under his eyes. Dean wonders if it's just from the ritual Sam cast, if it's all just the spell sapping Chuck's strength. "You gonna...stay dead, this time?"
"Thank you," says Castiel. This generosity is characteristic of Dean, who is always so conscious of all the small and vital details of survival, always wanting to provide for the people in his home however he can. Castiel runs a hand absent-mindedly along the edge of his desk. There's no dust on it, not even a slight layer, and Castiel has the sudden mental image of Dean cleaning the empty room, week after week with no hope of the occupant ever returning.
"I said, do you
Cas drops his eyes. “I’m—” he says, and hesitates.
, they’re all free, they
Dean nods. He swipes his hand ineffectually over his eyes. "Yeah."
"You could," says Castiel. "I felt your soul. I felt what you were feeling."
The penny takes a moment longer to drop for Sam, and then Dean sees remorse flit across his brother's face as the realization hits him. But Sam says nothing else, just backs up to the end of the table where Cas is turning his head agitatedly from side to side. He splays his huge hands over Cas's shoulders and nods once, grim.
And then one of the fey spears Cas through the side and suddenly it’s not so fun anymore.
"I don't understand all the things you are referencing," says Gadreel politely. "But yes, a soulmate. A soulmate is the entity an angel is destined to be with. Often it's another angel, though not always. I knew an angel whose soulmate was a whale. They made wonderful music together."
"Oh god," Dean grits out, "god,
Raz raises an eyebrow. "That'd be something of a redundancy, don't you think?" he says. "Given where we are."
He pulls Jack back into his arms. "It won't, Jack."
"Cas," Dean breathes. His face, which is still wet with tears, slackens in abrupt relief.
"I—" Dean's voice cracks. Absurdly, he feels tears prickle at the corners of his eyes. "I—everything. I want—I want—" Cas eases his thigh between Dean's legs and Dean barely recognizes the breathy, punched-out noise that leaves his own mouth. "Everything, with you, Cas."
