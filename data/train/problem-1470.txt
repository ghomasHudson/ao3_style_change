The dinging of the lift bell tore him away from his thoughts. He announced himself to the blond secretary, and she led him - with a resolutely friendly smile - directly to the mayor's office. She rapped smartly on the door, opened it, and held it for Lestrade.
"And yet he thought I was going to use you to blackmail him," John mused. "But... if he doesn't even like you then..." John shook his head. "Sorry - I don't get it."
A soft chuckle came from Sherlock's direction. He gave up his post at the door and ambled over to where John was sitting.
"Gregory... if we call the police now, there's sure to be a bloodbath down there in the reservoir. Is that what you want?" Mycroft waited a moment before adding, "Not that I wouldn't be happy to rid myself of my brother in such a manner..."
"Yeah, about Mycroft..." John stood beside Sherlock. "Are you going to have... contact with him more often now?"
"Ah-ah... not so fast." John held out his arm to keep Sherlock at a distance. He had to laugh at Sherlock's disappointed expression. "No reason to cry," he teased. "You're still going to get your...
John's heart was hammering against his chest. With a low growl, he pulled Sherlock down onto his lap, his legs spread, and covered the incredibly long, seductive neck with greedy kisses. His hands grabbed Sherlock's firm arse and he rubbed his own crotch against the hard, hot length behind the wet spot in Sherlock's pyjamas. Sherlock slung one arm around John's shoulders and clung to him.
"Did you really think I'd let you rub off on my trousers and ruin them with your spunk?" John asked, although not in an unfriendly manner.
John sat in his armchair and stared at his smart phone, frowning, while the television droned in the background. John looked up from time to time to watch the programme for a few moments, only to return his full attention to his phone again.
Sherlock swallowed hard, but his penis seemed to be quite interested in the idea of having its right to free expression curtailed.
, the more important it had become to control himself. He succeeded this time as well. He even managed to maintain a cool outward appearance, although his every instinct was screaming to wring this impertinent whore's neck.
Greg shrugged his shoulders, rolled a condom down over Mycroft's erection, and crouched over it. Mycroft's breath stuttered as Greg slowly lowered himself, taking in his stiff penis with hardly any effort.
"Sherlock!" Indignation paired with gentle reproach - a combination that was guaranteed to make Sherlock see red.
Sherlock still couldn't believe it. He had to make sure he hadn't suddenly begun imagining things or hallucinating. His other senses had to confirm what his eyes and ears were signalling to him. He had to feel, to touch, to taste.
"If you're going to shoot, then do it," Sherlock said with a composure that even he found to be surreal. "We'll see each other again in hell either way. What should I be afraid of?"
"Not right away, at any rate," Mycroft replied easily, before continuing with somewhat more hesitation: "He... doesn't want any special favours."
John's thoughts ran along a similar track, even though he didn't know why Sherlock had chosen that particular shade of blue. He had also been struck by memories of that day when he'd viewed those walls. But he wasn't thinking of the sky - of the strong impression it had left on Sherlock, which he knew nothing about. Rather, the design which Billy was so expertly daubing onto the wall reminded him of Bach's '
"Sherlock?" John sounded honestly worried, and Sherlock felt the vibrator being removed from his body a bit too fast. He flinched. "Sherlock, look at me," John ordered him sternly, placing both hands on Sherlock's cheeks and forcing him to turn his face toward John. "Look at me," he said again, but this time his voice was more gentle. Sherlock opened his eyes reluctantly.
Moriarty's pistol, left without a target, now pointed at empty space. John whipped around and shot at Moriarty, who gaped at him with a look of horror. A small red spot bloomed on the white shirt that was visible under Moriarty's coat. John heard the woman scream something inarticulate, the sound ringing in his ears. He ducked instinctively. A bullet sizzled past just over his head. He rounded on her and fired two more shots from where he was crouched.
"A St. Andrew's cross?" John repeated in a strangled voice. "What do you think this is going to be? Some kind of S and M club?"
"… be forced into some mental institution in the back of beyond by your heavies," Sherlock cut in rudely. "So you found out what John likes... good. You'll be pleased to know that his particular inclinations satisfy my own needs in a most harmonious manner."
,” Sherlock explained in a careless tone, virtually throwing himself into the chair designated for visitors.
Sherlock complied silently and with sensual grace. He seemed to want to communicate solely through his eyes ... they spoke of heat, arousal, and willingness, and the sight of such fiery passion nearly took John's breath away.
Right in the middle of that unpleasant thought, Sherlock heard the sound of the door opening. Still standing with his back to the entrance, he said in his most arrogant tone of voice, "You're late." Only then did he deign to turn slowly around to take a look at the delinquent client who'd made him wait so long.
They'd been happy before he'd fallen in love with John too, hadn't they? He would simply return to that point in their relationship. Nothing could be easier. At least that's what he told himself.
Holmes bit his lip briefly. It was an unconscious reaction that he apparently hadn't been fast enough to suppress - Greg was certain of that.
John took a deep, noisy breath. “I don't believe I asked whether there was a way or not,” he retorted sharply. “I gave you an order and I expect you to carry it out.”
But then Moriarty pulled Sherlock out from behind one of the pillars, holding a pistol to his temple. John flinched back in shock. He hastily lessened the pressure of his finger against the trigger of his gun. However, he still kept the weapon trained on Moriarty, whose footsteps rang through the high, dismal gallery as he walked along the top of the low wall, dragging Sherlock with him.
"It could have been worse. Today, I think... motherhood just wasn't her calling. But she was always... dutiful. She attended every school do... sat in the audience at every performance either Mycroft or I took part in... she never scolded us if one of us broke something..." Sherlock fell silent and his eyes focused on something far away... on a past, a memory that only he could see, because only he had lived through it.
A dark, disturbing, unbridled lust ran through him at the thought. A hot-and-cold shiver crept down his back, and his hard flesh throbbed for the first time. What would that throbbing feel like with a sound inside?
"Why wait until tonight?" Sherlock whispered roughly against John's lips between two kisses, pressing against him in an unambiguous manner.
John's anger flared up instantly at Albright's disapproval. He thrust his chin forward. "My behaviour..." he echoed, his voice tight.
She was sure they'd been up to no good. A malevolent grin danced across her bright pink lips. This was going to be the payback for those wankers stiffing her on the tip. She was going to blow the whistle on them. Who was she supposed to contact? Ah... someone named Jason. She noted the number from the text message and entered it into her phone.
Why? Why did everything look the same as before? Why did everything smell the same as before? Feel the same as before? When nothing was the same at all?
"No." Mike rejected the idea flat out. He had a suspicion what this was leading up to and he didn't want to hear it.
“God, yes!” Sherlock shuddered, sniffling. “It's perfect…I’m just…the emotions…you’re not…you’re not hurting me. I’m fine. There’s just…” He shook his head, the explanation he needed entirely failing to formulate. “It’s…good.”
Nothing happened for a few seconds. The only sound was the quiet ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece. John and Moran kept their eyes firmly fixed on each other. Every flinch, every blink on the part of their opponent was immediately taken note of and assessed. The two men circled each other mentally like two sharks in a small tank. They were both ruthless killers when it came down to it, prepared to take advantage of even the smallest weakness on the part of their victim... but also capable, if necessary, of exercising patience and playing the game of cat-and-mouse.
"Everything's lining up like ducks in a row," he said before launching into a detailed explanation of the various points. He concluded by saying, "I reckon we've thought of everything."
The statement and the conviction with which it was presented threw the situation into a whole new light. John could all but smell the uncertainty as it spread amongst his men. Questioning looks were being exchanged.
The shadow of a patronising smile returned to Mycroft's face. "Then I can only presume he didn't tell you everything."
"I didn't know anything about the thing with customs... but it's obvious someone's trying to make it look like the bomb at the ball was my payback. I'd say it was a good thing that my... important business, and the fact that my phone was off, put a spanner in those plans. That pretty much mucked up this person's timing."
Sherlock did so, explaining how he'd sniffed out Kitty, how coincidence had led him to a bit of help in the form of Dave and Naresh, and finally how he'd received Kitty's confirmation just a few minutes ago.
Sherlock hoped he would be able to avoid asking his brother for help, but he strongly suspected it would end up coming to that, as any surveillance footage that might show the mysterious blond man entering or leaving the location would give them an immense advantage. But maybe there was another way... Sherlock just couldn’t think of it at the moment. And he had the very strong feeling that his time was running out.
"You mean you don't have a cache of lubricant here?" Sherlock asked in a vain attempt to sound arrogant. "Rather neglectful... but a little spit will be sufficient," he murmured in John's ear. "And if it hurts a bit... even better..."
John's broad, satisfied grin told him that he, Sherlock Holmes – the greatest detective of all time – had fallen for a cheap trick. John had never meant to maltreat the cigar. He'd just wanted to torture Sherlock. Sherlock's heart rate accelerated at the thought. Was that what John had planned for him? If so, it was extraordinarily cruel, creative, and worthy of veneration.
Sherlock really was still lying in bed, but John was a bit disconcerted by his appearance. Sweat shimmered on his forehead, his eyes looked feverish, and his cheeks were flushed. Was Sherlock sick? Flu symptoms did have a tendency to pop up from one second to the next.
Their eyes met, and both men knew that John owed Moran his life. The shot had gone right past his head. John had felt it. He held out his hand, and Moran took it immediately.
After forty blows, Sherlock began to moan softly and arch into the hits. But he still flinched away after every one. It almost came across like a dance to John... approaching and retreating in an even rhythm.
"Mycroft - I don't give a flying fuck at the moment who you're punching doughnuts with. I just want to know one thing: can that bloody copper be trusted?"
“And here we go,” Mike said, sighing heavily. “He's not even here yet and you're already spending money on him. What's it going to be like when...”
Sherlock shook his head firmly. He couldn't take the risk. If John shot the next bureau head after Albright - one he'd hand-picked himself and who had (apparently) saved his life... then John's days in the mob were numbered, and Sherlock didn't particularly want to have to lay a wreath of red roses on John's final resting place.
Mycroft's thin lips formed a smirk. "I wouldn't have chosen those particular words, but... yes. Precisely because you are
Sherlock felt a little bit at sea. "Thank you," he said softly. The word was surprisingly easy to articulate, even if it still felt unfamiliar in his mouth.
"Tout est superbe, Jacques," Sherlock congratulated him, his eyes shining and with a light-hearted tone to his voice. "Comme toujours d'ailleurs. Vous pouvez commencer le service. Mais, il y a juste une chose..."
John had almost destroyed the best thing that had ever happened to him with his temper. That terrible night and the morning after had been a hard lesson for him. He never wanted to let something like that happen again. And if that meant he had to tell this psycho-bird all about his childhood then that’s what he’d do. He just hoped no one found out about it... not his mob buddies, not Mike, and most of all, not Sherlock. And if it did come out some day... well... then he wouldn’t try to deny it. Just like he’d never denied his homosexuality. Other people’s opinions had never really mattered to him... with the exception of Mike... and Sherlock.
"Poor dear," Irene cooed, fluttering her eyes coquettishly. "You misunderstand me. I don't want to be your
Either his expression betrayed his thoughts, or - he wasn't going to dismiss the possibility entirely - he might have let out a little sigh, as Mycroft Holmes suddenly declared that he certainly hadn't intended to spend his Sunday like this.
With the aid of John's hands on his buttocks, Sherlock shuffled a bit closer. His knuckles brushed over John's stiff penis, and he sighed softly. Then Sherlock let go of his own cock and his fingers wrapped effortlessly around both of them in a loose hold. Both men were breathing heavily now. The warm, humid scent of arousal and sweat made its way into John's nose and mouth... surrounded him... swathed him in a cocoon of sensuality. His hips jerked forward automatically, and he heard Sherlock gasp for air. But his grip was still loose, nowhere near the firm friction John had hoped for. Could it be that...
"Wise decision," John praised him. "But now we should really take care of getting you out of those clothes." He'd barely completed the sentence before he reached for Sherlock's jacket, pulled it down off his shoulders, and let it fall carelessly to the floor.
"Looks like someone's eager..." John said with a lascivious grin, and tied Sherlock's legs to the table as well. Now all that was left were the two extra-long leather belts, which John passed through underneath the table. He laid the first one across Sherlock's abdomen, pulling it as tight as he could without impeding Sherlock's breathing, and closed the buckle. He waited through several of Sherlock's quick breaths before asking, "Is it good like that? Are you getting enough air?" Sherlock nodded, and John wrapped the second belt around Sherlock's thighs. When he was done, he stepped back and admired his handiwork.
Sherlock turned his head in the specified direction. John's thrusts had become more gentle and slower due to the change in position, but Sherlock could feel John's hard cock even more intensely inside him. Still, the urge to explode immediately and dissolve into thousands of little pieces had receded somewhat. The mirror wasn't in the best position - in other words, John hadn't planned this, instead following a sudden impulse - but when he turned his head just a bit further he could see their reflections quite well in the smooth surface.
Lestrade had spoken softly, yet his voice was suffused with bitterness. "Am I correct in the assumption that that bozo Dimmock was responsible for the lion's share of it?"
Sherlock sobbed, swallowed hard, and whispered hoarsely, "Yes..." before adding, "Please?" in a questioning tone that sounded so helpless that it sent fresh waves of lust coursing through John's body.
"Look at me," John commanded with such calm and control that an icy cold shiver ran down Sherlock's back.
"Hire Jacques back," Sherlock demanded without mincing words. "Immediately," he added to underscore how serious he was.
John looked at his friend as if he'd lost his mind. "You cannot be serious! You aren't seriously going to tell me to..."
He stood there, breathing hard - overwhelmed by the events and insights of the day. He laid his instrument carefully back on the table before going over and opening the large floor-to-ceiling windows. He ran out across the tiled terrace and let himself collapse onto the meticulously manicured lawn.
"Too bad," John said in a low voice, gazing at him intently. "By the way, I don't appear to be your only admirer."
Sherlock didn't have to wait very long before John returned, carrying the small, insulated ice bucket from the bar.
But today he was standing on a plastic sheet amidst bare, freshly plastered walls - completely exposed - between ladders, paint buckets, and other tools of the trade, feeling utterly filthy, almost like a cheap construction site whore. There was something disturbingly erotic about the image. He moaned wantonly and the first drop fell from his erect penis onto the floor.
Sherlock stopped walking. The corners of his mouth twitched. He was still glaring at John, but the next moment he burst out in unwilling laughter.
"It is a bit... shall we say, complicated," Mycroft conceded, reaching for the articles of his clothing which were strewn across the floor. The procedure of putting them on gave him enough time to come up with a strategy for the upcoming cross-examination which he was no doubt about to have to endure.
"Your brother's the one who deserves the laurels. It was Sherlock's idea," John corrected him. "There wasn't anything interesting in your flat anyway."
Sherlock was surprised to discover apprehension and arousal prickling through his body in equal measures, leaving an unpleasant, expectant feeling in his stomach. Did John really want to...? It would hurt, that much was certain. Although he was only experiencing moderate pain at the moment, Sherlock was fully aware that a second round would be unbearable. Still, his heart was beating wildly and the emotional contradiction made him feel light-headed. He swallowed over a dry throat. Was he going to let John do it? Everything in him screamed to submit, to surrender to John – yet he remained rooted to the spot and didn't move an inch.
The prize question that posed itself to him now, though, was: did he want to pursue this interest or was it better for all concerned if … if their fingers never again happened - purely by chance - to touch while passing a cup of tea or a glass of water?
Gingerly, he bent his finger slightly inside the narrow passage surrounding him, and Sherlock sighed again.
"My goodness!" Irene exclaimed with false theatricality. "Whatever did I do to deserve a punishment like this? A randy rent boy and no solution in sight! Oh... wait... I just remembered I run a brothel and you work for me! Swing your sweet little arse down to the lounge and earn me some money!"
No idea if they were as popular in the English-speaking world as they were in Germany... but here are a few examples anyway:
Charlie laughed in despair. It sounded like the laugh of a madman and gave John goosebumps. The men's questioning looks turned sceptical.
As soon as Mike hurriedly left the office on the heels of that very clear order, Sherlock remarked lightly, "Why don't you just tell him Mycroft's my half brother?"
Instead, John laid his hands over Sherlock's, which were still resting on his hips... John grasped them, seeking a steady hold … twitching …
"Fantastic. You've found my weak spot," he grumbled and took a deep breath. "Okay. Fine. I won't initiate any investigations. And I'll keep my ear to the ground with my colleagues. But if
What Sherlock wasn't so indifferent to, however, was the fact that his mysterious client was running late. He glanced in annoyance at the clock on the mantel. He'd been waiting over twenty minutes. This kind of behaviour was inacceptable. They could have taken care of all the formalities by now and...
"Have you discussed everything with him yet?" Of course Ella would pose the one question that was most uncomfortable for John. She always started with the worst possible question.
"No one's throwing you out here! Least of all John!" Mike said with half a grin. "How did you ever come up with such an insane notion?"
If he told John everything, John would kick him out of the house for sure. Sherlock was one hundred percent certain of that. What crime lord would suffer someone at his side who was under the thumb of his opponent?
"That's impossible!" Mike exclaimed, taking the sheet. He inspected it, took off his glasses, cleaned them, put them back on, and held the paper right up to his nose. "This has been altered!"
"I don't think the doctors would object if I translated some letters for you," Sherlock said, attempting to remain focussed on business. "I can do that from bed. Just bring everything along the next time you visit. They won't even let me have a laptop here."
"Much too fast... much too easily..." John murmured back just as softly, caught Sherlock's finger and ghosted a kiss onto it. "You really are completely incapable of taking care of yourself... you simply don't know what's good for you. That '
It was only three hours since Irene, in a disgustingly good mood, had tossed him an enema kit in the hallway along with a room number and a time.
"It's a good thing I don't sleep at night anyway," Irene responded, giving Sherlock a wry look. "But you probably don't either... Does your Doc keep you up often?"
The auction didn't begin for another half hour, so John used the time to find out as much as he could about the new kid, someone he'd never heard of. But other than his name (Sherlock) and the general statement that he was rather headstrong – albeit incredibly brilliant and gifted for this business – he couldn't get anything else out of the other guests. He had the distinct feeling that they were keeping something from him in order to discourage him from bidding.
"What?" John let slip, gawking at Sherlock incredulously. "I..." he started to protest, but he was no match for the pleading look in those pale eyes. He cleared his throat and shifted his weight from one foot to the other, not sure what he was supposed to say. "Erm. Hello... Mrs Sigerson..." he began, only to promptly be interrupted by Sherlock.
"I..." Mycroft started to say, but then his voice failed and Sherlock couldn't hear anything more than the typical dry clicking sound that accompanied a mouth being opened and closed so quickly that the teeth clacked together. "My schedule is too full to pay attention to normal business hours," he rebuked Sherlock snidely.
"Yeah... no... not really," Greg answered in a conflicting way. "I thought I was... but... when it didn't work with Evelyn... I never thought of another woman... it was always just other men."
John shoved the last piece of toast into his mouth and rinsed it down with the rest of his tea. "I'd better be making a move." He stood up, went over to Sherlock and kissed him on the mouth. His kiss was returned with passionate interest, and the lusty pull in his groin reported back. "See you later," John murmured, kissing Sherlock once more before straightening up and going to the door. Halfway there, a thought came to him. He stopped and turned.
John had been mentally prepared to hear quite a lot of things, but he hadn't anticipated an attack like that.
between your legs? I bet you can’t. I guess it will be more like squirting. You know… like some women do. Will you squirt for me, Sherlock? With your man-clit? Just a few drops, hm? Can you do that? Come on. I want to see it. I guess it won’t be much more than a few drops… One can’t shoot large ammunition with a small gun like yours.”
Mike Stamford was sitting diagonally across from him in a cream-coloured leather armchair, part of a suite of furniture where John liked to hold conversations on a
And John thought how gorgeous Sherlock looked and how happy and content he felt in this exact moment and somehow it dawned on him how tired he was of fighting this (not so strange anymore) admiration he felt for his friend. And he thought:
“Good boy.” John reached down and held Sherlock’s throbbing erection loosely between his right middle and index fingers, thumb caressing just beneath the head of Sherlock’s cock. “Your little dicklet is even wet like a real clit.” John teased. His own cock was achingly hard and pulsing in sympathy with every tiny, greedy thrust of Sherlock’s hips as he clearly tried to get more pressure on his glans than the featherlight, nowhere near enough touches John was granting him.
“Sherlock, you can't expect me to believe that you think this brothel – no disrespect to Miss Adler, but – that this brothel can keep you safe at all?”
"Thirty-four," he said around his food. "Peas. On my plate," he explained with a patronising look, which didn't quite fit on his chubby, childish face, and made Doris want to laugh every time. She knew better, though, and refrained, else she provoke one of the spectacular tantrums he always worked himself into when he didn't feel that he was being taken seriously.
he missed him? Sherlock hesitated. He wanted to tell him. Right now. Right away. Before he lost his nerve. But... he wanted to look John in the eye when he did it. Wanted to look at him and tell him what he felt for him. Wanted to breathlessly await his reaction. Wanted...
Mycroft Holmes took the stage to the sounds of applause, accepted the microphone from the patroness of the Metropolitan Police Charity Ball, and began his opening remarks - which would probably take several minutes. Greg looked longingly at the buffet near to where he'd taken up his position. He probably wasn't going to get a cold beer tonight, but he'd settle for some of the champagne that the waiters were busy pouring into glasses, which were already condensing in a promising way. Whatever - the stuff looked cold. That was a light at the end of the tunnel in any case.
Sherlock followed that order silently as well, climbing onto the bed and lying back with his long limbs stretched out across the sheets. Once he was ready, he lay there quietly, watching John with a look of anticipation. But the uncertainty had returned to his gaze, and John decided not to rush his inspection of this now completely nude body. It might be that he was the first client Sherlock had ever presented himself to completely naked. He wanted to give him some time to regain his composure, gather himself, and become accustomed to it. That might have sounded oddly sentimental, but if he wanted to stick to his plan and succeed in getting Sherlock to
“Then explain it to me!” Sherlock snarled. “I want you to humiliate me because of the size of my cock. I am asking for it! I’ve explained to you that it’s a kink of mine. What is the problem?”
"Good God," Mike groaned, irritated. "Then order something else - look, the waiter's zipping over this way again." He signalled, and the waiter adjusted his course toward them.
"Then I'll make sure you regret it," John growled at him, unaffected by the taunt. "Have I made myself clear?"
Without letting his relief be heard, John responded dryly, "I told you. But the best part is yet to come."
Sherlock glared at him. "Where are they all anyway? I mean, not that I expected a receiving line to greet me..."
"I still need to punish you for disobeying me last time," John began, causing Sherlock to widen his eyes in outrage.
Lestrade's non-reaction was irksome, which was why Sherlock barked at John with slightly more vehemence than intended: "And all that simply because I know my way around tobacco ash. Two hundred and fifty-two types!" The corners of his mouth twitched sardonically. "You might mention that in your next blog entry." There was no need to mime the air quotes around the word 'blog'. His tone of voice was more than sufficient, if one went by the look on John's face, which was especially expressive today. And usually, one could (go by John's face, that is). The assortment of expressions John employed had long since been archived, deciphered, verified, catalogued, and preserved for ease of access in Sherlock's mind palace.
John went into the entry hall and closed the door behind him, letting the lock catch with an audible snap. In just a moment, Sherlock would storm out from somewhere like a force of nature, virtually suffocating him in his embrace, and then...
In just that moment Sherlock stepped out of the room, completely unfazed if a bit sulky. Alone. John breathed out. That was a good sign. It meant they could continue their journey. His brain picked up the unfinished thought: A piercing in his… John’s eyes automatically dropped to Sherlock’s crotch. Immediately, he pulled his head back up and, feeling guilty, turned his back on his friend. He felt heat rise to his face. Christ! He was a doctor, a soldier. He would not blush like a teenager right now. So Sherlock had a piercing in his… yes, where, exactly? Penis, scrotum, glans or… WHATEVER. It didn’t matter at all where the damn thing was. It was of no consequence which intimate body part had been touched by a stranger to…
John finally opened another door, pushed it wide, and indicated with a wave of his hand that Sherlock should enter first.
“Mr Stamford made it clear to me that you lobbied for my re-instatement personally,” Jacques said guardedly and lowered his eyes. Sherlock tuned out most of the verbose statements that followed, only catching a word or two here and there
"Well..." Billy started cautiously, scratching the back of his head with his free hand. "I wouldn't exactly call it shite..."
"I don't want to leave," the reply came back quickly, yet so softly that John had to prick his ears to hear it. "But … if you want me to leave, then..." Sherlock went on despondently.
"I can't always think of everything," Sherlock whispered back unrepentantly, pressing one last defiant kiss onto his lips. His desire for John flared up again, but his body didn't keep pace for once, and John's genitals also lay soft and indifferent against Sherlock's thigh. It was disappointing, yet Sherlock didn't take it as a huge catastrophe. Their kisses had also satisfied him and stilled a hunger that he couldn't quite parse, now that it had been fed and retreated.
"I don't want to disappoint you," he murmured in a small voice, sounding so disheartened that John's anger dissipated as quickly as it had flared up. "You spent rather a lot of money on me, after all."
"I wouldn't have noticed it on my own. Not really," Sherlock went on. Another pause. "Is that bad?" He sounded a little disheartened.
To John, each one of Sherlock's kisses felt – as unlikely as it sounded - as if they were the first ones for this incredible man he was holding in his arms - which had at some point wrapped themselves around the body kneeling before him without him even thinking about it. As Sherlock sucked on his tongue, John kicked himself mentally for being such an idiot.
"Tonight..." He licked lightly over the tantalising earlobe and heard Sherlock's faint gasp. "Your mouth..." He ghosted a kiss onto the spot behind Sherlock's ear. "My dick..." He felt Sherlock emit a small sound. "As long as you want - as often as you want - any way you want," John growled into his ear. "And you can swallow as much as you want." He released Sherlock, who tottered a bit as he moved away. "I've withheld it from you for long enough."
"I'm going to shower and go to bed as well," John answered, caressing Sherlock's cheek with one finger. "I need to be out of the house early tomorrow. If you'd like to have breakfast with me … tea will be ready at eight in here."
John's mouth tenderly nestled into Sherlock's... the tip of John's tongue crowded into his mouth... he parted his lips a little more, hungry... and then... John's smoke-saturated breath in his mouth... thick, creamy, spicy... indescribable. Sherlock surged toward his beloved as far as he could... as far as his bonds allowed... pressed his own tongue between John's lips... into his mouth... licking, sucking, inhaling the last bit of tobacco from John's tongue, from his mouth, from his skin. The hand on his neck wandered up into his hair and tugged his head back with a single, quick jerk.
"Mhm." John made a sound as if his suspicion had just become certainty. "So you knew exactly what you were doing?"
It was a safe bet that John would assume Sherlock was spying for Mycroft. Mycroft certainly had enough means at his disposal to apply pressure on Sherlock. John couldn't know that Sherlock would rather cut off his own hand - or even let himself be locked up in a more or less disreputable sanatorium again - before he did anything that might harm John.
"You've never gone without anything," Victor retorted with a look that made it clear he didn't believe a word John was saying.
"John - here you are! Next time pick up your damn mobile! Got it?! Otherwise you can find some other patsy to spend half the night with customs and then hanging out at the station getting our boys..." It wasn't until now that he noticed John wasn't alone. He stopped short and fell silent. It took another second for him to recognise that the guest was the mayor.
He quickly skimmed their contents, stopping abruptly before he'd reached the end of the first third of the document. His eyes slowly wandered back to the beginning, and this time he read the text attentively and with great care, word for word. He didn't notice the orderly leaving. The pencil slid out of his fingers and fell to the floor, likewise unnoticed. Sherlock read through the papers again, and then a third time.
Sherlock absorbed those forceful words like a sponge, secretly surprised at himself. He didn't expect how much he longed to be treated like that – with unyielding resolution tempered by kindness.
John shook his head, both reproving and indulgent. "But why didn't you prepare yourself at all? I really would have thought that Miss Adler-"
"Are you trying to suggest I was neglecting my business because I was drooling after some cheap cocksucker?" John hissed in an icy, threatening tone.
Then John took a deep breath, leant over, laid one hand on Sherlock's back, pulled back with the other, and bore down hard on the proffered flesh.
John ran his tongue across his upper lip. "I don't know if I should be shocked or pleased by your depravity."
“Don't just stand there!” John snapped at him. “Get over here, open your mouth wide, and say 'Aaaaaa'...”
"Yes. I'm very glad for that," Sherlock stated. He enjoyed John's touch and relaxed further, no longer feeling that the darkness was so oppressive; rather, it was like a protective cloak spread over the two of them. "Do you honestly think I became the world's best cocksucker just like that overnight?" he joked. "No, sir. That took years of practise." He fell silent for a moment, wondering whether he should really speak the next words that lay on his tongue. He decided in favour of it. It might not be the most romantic thing to say - perhaps it was even the most preposterous thing he could say at the moment - but he wanted John to know what he thought about it and how he felt. Even though it always stung a little when he thought of John's former acquaintances, the whole thing did have a very definite advantage.
"A bit too well, it seems," John countered and took a look around. Beside him stood a waist-high cabinet with various cables and chargers lying on top. John swept everything onto the floor with a single motion, setting his bag in its place.
Sherlock tried desperately to find a way out. "Wouldn't it be better if you used the riding crop... or if you must, the whip..."
"No... yes... I don't know... it's ... too much ... I ... need ... I need you," Sherlock stammered incoherently.
Sherlock had occupied the chair behind John's desk with an unparalleled chutzpah - never mind asking for permission or even waiting for a simple nod of the head.
who lived at the brothel. Irene lived there herself since she'd had the attic converted into a generous duplex. But that wasn't surprising; after all, she owned the house and had worked hard for it.
John's fingers danced playfully over the smooth testes, which had already tightened a bit and pulled in closer to Sherlock's body, broadcasting a clear signal of his arousal. But John didn't stop there, instead letting his fingers slide lower – over the scrotum to the soft skin of the perineum, which was slightly damp with perspiration.
There was a kernel of truth in there, but it came with the territory for John. He trusted Mike and Sherlock, and nobody else, and that was good. An overtrusting mob boss would quickly become a dead mob boss.
“How much, Miss Adler?” he reiterated with an exaggerated sigh. “Name your price. I can't promise I won't try to bargain with you, but I think you'll find I'm feeling generous today. I'm also well aware that Sherlock's debt with you will probably drive the price up.”
"Just like this..." John moaned. His own arousal had increased at a rampant pace in the short time, and his trousers were quickly becoming too tight. "Zip... open my zip..."
"You're not going to cancel," Sherlock declared firmly. "You announced it a week ago, and my decision is final."
"Yes," John insisted gently yet firmly. "I hoped you'd trust me enough some day to tell me everything... but you can't force something like that."
"Whoever it was," John said, interrupting Moran's intense thought process, "it doesn't matter any longer. I know all about your schemes."
John bit his lower lip. It was really quite irksome that such a talented marksman was working against him rather than for him.
But maybe fate would smile on him tonight, and John's efforts would be rewarded. He'd never been as aroused as he was now – at least with regards to this particular kind of play. Never before had his entire body worked toward an orgasm so concertedly. Wave after wave of sexual ecstasy surged through him and carried him along, only to collapse without breaking on the sought after cliffs, and then to build again...
"I don't want to pressure him. He shouldn't say it just because he feels like he has to... he should only say it if it's really... true," Sherlock explained haltingly, his gaze lowered. He only looked up when he caught a whiff of her perfume.
There was an odd tension in the air when John and Sherlock sat down to dinner together that evening. They sat across from each other at the dining table in John's living room, neither saying a word.
That was no longer true for him. And yet, even following an accidental overdose and a horrendous hospital stay, he'd never summoned the courage to end his life by his own hand.
John clicked his tongue. "I'm afraid my good manners forbid me from answering that," he answered cheerfully and sat down in the same spot he'd taken the last time. He saw Mycroft glance toward the door and then check out the window. It was obvious that he expected John to have company with him... someone other than his chauffeur.
Maybe he'd ended up swallowing down a couple of tears once he was in his own bed … maybe he'd even cried himself to sleep one time - but now?
"Shit, no!" John cried. "You didn't think anything... You didn't think for one bloody second! Is that your idea of fun? Playing Russian roulette? With your life?"
Nicotine wasn't really the last addiction he had. But the fulfilment of his other addiction - John's semen in his mouth - was being withheld. What other choice did he have than to fall back on a substitute in the form of a cigarette?
, but that was generally an extremely unreliable proposition as well. It was much better when one had the proper means at one's disposal to guarantee a certain consistency in others.
"Fine," Sherlock said, abruptly swinging his legs off the couch and setting them onto the floor with a certain decisiveness. "Then I'd best pack my things... there's not much. It won't take long. Would Bridges be able to drive me? No, probably not. I... could take a taxi... which I can't pay for... I wonder if John...? No... I can walk just as well... I..."
The last, pleading look from Sherlock did nothing to shake his resolve; it did, however, cause a thrilling throbbing in his dick. Sherlock took a shaky breath and then rubbed his fingers over his wet, gleaming glans. His body convulsed inward, accompanied by a hoarse moan.
"If only I knew..." Greg spoke his thoughts out loud, then let out a low cry. "That's him! That's the other guy!"
. What was I thinking? I should have done things differently. Better. You deserved better... a better first time."
"Not really," Sherlock countered evasively. "My body has never been especially important to me. Not until..." Sherlock cut himself off and gnawed on his lip again. Should he? Should he go so far out on a limb and tell John that everything had changed since
"That might be nice for a start," Greg said, his voice hard, and looked Mycroft directly in the eye. "Yeah."
In that, at least, John's clairvoyant abilities had failed. However, Sherlock's fingers - which he had pressed together under his chin - twitched nervously against each other at the sound of each individual tone that rang out through the air, bearing silent testimony to his inner turmoil, which John had predicted quite accurately.
"From the mayor. Mr Holmes is waiting downstairs in the small parlour. He wants to see you. Now," Thomas repeated the order, giving John an apologetic look. "His words. Not mine."
'. It wasn't until he repeated the first passage and was playing the smooth, yearning tones for the second time that he realised what he was doing... he'd let his heart speak for him. Loud and clear. He didn't dare look at John. How had he betrayed himself so thoughtlessly? There must be some truth in the saying
"Two things, before..." John began, and - sadist that he was - let his tongue flick across Sherlock's lips for a fraction of a second in a parody of a kiss. "First: no smoking. There are nicotine patches in the drawer of your nightstand. I've never been particularly interested in kissing someone who tastes like an ashtray, and I don't plan on starting now." His tongue danced once again tantalisingly over Sherlock's lips, even as Sherlock opened them with a soft moan. "Second: if you let this room deteriorate into a pigsty the way you did your rooms at Miss Adler's, then..."
Only two people sat at Violet's bedside, both of them with the full knowledge that it was only a matter of hours before their dearly beloved closed her eyes forever.
"Why did you lie to me?" John rasped. "Why didn't you say anything? We could have talked about it... we could have gone our separate ways in peace... How long did you let me dangle like that, hm? How long were you planning on running away? How long did you let the farce drag on?"
"The boss didn't want us to, Franco," the third man interjected. He was wearing a short coat with a fake fur collar. "You heard him."
"Sherlock is gone?!" John blurted out, disconcerted. He was about to say something else but just then his mobile phone rang. Without even looking at the screen, he accepted the call and bellowed, "NOT NOW!" into the device.
But Sherlock had turned his entire focus on Dave, hanging on his every word, and Dave warmed to the attention. “I didn’t imagine it. I know what I saw! Albright was looking at Moran.”
"No reason to pout," John commented on seeing Sherlock's expression. "We'll continue in just a moment." He also released the bindings on Sherlock's ankles, turned him around, and pushed him gently down onto the edge of the mattress. "Sit down a sec." He wiped Sherlock's sweaty forehead with the back of his hand and pressed the tips of his fingers carefully against Sherlock's throat to feel his pulse.
Disappointment spread through Sherlock, dulled and diluted his gaze, and left a bitter aftertaste of what-might-have-been on his tongue. Ashamed, he lowered his eyes, hiding his true feelings and keeping the secret of his love to himself.
"No," John hissed angrily. "I'm still pissed off at you! You put me in an impossible situation! Exactly how stupid do you think I looked when he told me you're his brother? His brother! Bloody hell! Some sort of clue would have been really nice! That... that sodding politician thought I knew!" When Sherlock continued to watch him with that same focused concentration and attentiveness rather than reacting in any way, one of John's fuses blew. "HE THOUGHT - I - KNEW!"
Wild, dark curls surrounded Sherlock's flushed face. Beads of perspiration decorated his forehead, and a few strands of hair were plastered to his temples. His gentle, blissful face bore an expression of utter devotion. The full lips, swollen and red from their incessant activity, were barely parted. The fascinating, clear eyes were still fixed on John's wilted penis with a greedy gleam.
"I'm not a big eater," Sherlock stated without any further explanation before laying his fork aside for good with a barely audible sigh.
But none of them had taken advantage of the refuge for more than a couple of weeks. Most of them moved out again after a few days.
"Well?" Sherlock finally asked with deliberate nonchalance, even as his brain was working feverishly. "Anything interesting?" He indicated the folder but didn't touch it, despite the fact that his fingers were itching to.
They parted - not exactly as friends, but with a certain mutual understanding in place between them. John wondered, though, how long this rather unstable détente would last. They still needed each other... they were virtually allies in the fight against a common enemy... but how would things go when that enemy had been routed and defeated? Donovan would still be there, making John's life hell, and Mycroft wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Looked at from that angle, Mycroft hadn't been fulfilling his part of the deal - protecting John from the police - for quite some time already. John didn't feel he was necessarily bound to his concessions in that case either.
moment that you might ask MY OPINION about the whole thing?!” He held John's gaze, unfazed. “That might have spared you some measure of humiliation. Don't you think?” Sherlock took a deep breath, and his lower lip began to tremble. His cool superiority floundered a bit, and judging by the way he was biting his lip, he knew it too. “You'll probably want to cancel all of the arrangements and agreements you've made with me. Don't bother. Just say whatever you need to and get your money back from Irene. I won't stop you.”
Up to now, John's intelligence on Moran hadn't yielded any hints as to who might be backing him, but John had been aware from the start that this was going to be a long-haul game. The whole thing with Albright's nephew and Charlie had been too clever.
Greg ground his teeth. "That's why he never showed up in any reports under the name of Holmes. I get it." He rubbed the back of his neck and his throat with one hand. "Shit," he cursed under his breath and stuck another cigarette between his lips.
"I've surprised you..." Mycroft noted thoughtfully. He also appeared startled, as if the idea gave him something to think about, and once again something about the look gave John a sense of déjà-vu.
to try and pay off his debt to Miss Adler. And John would also move on and keep an eye out for another way to pass his time. After all, Sherlock wasn't anything more than a prostitute ... they were a dime a dozen on every street corner. What had Mike said so fittingly?
The warmth of Sherlock's mouth, the agility of his tongue, and not least the fire in his eyes all contributed to John's recovery from the shock of the cold, and the gentle yet persistent sucking and licking around his now stiff shaft not only elicited a gratified sigh, but prompted his hips to plunge deeper and deeper into Sherlock's throat in a quest for
"I would have been smart enough to shoot him in the leg when he tried to run, not shot him in the back and right through his heart."
Now it was Mycroft's turn to shrug. "She's not a man, she's not white... she fills two quotas with one hire... the general state of euphoria knows no bounds," he described the situation dryly. "Her name is Donovan. Sally Donovan."
"Just remember..." John finally continued, unimpressed by Sherlock's death glare. His voice sank to a stern yet seductive whisper that was used to giving orders. "I bought you. You belong to
John penetrated him a second time, fucking him in a hard, staccato rhythm, and when John stroked roughly over his erection, Sherlock ejaculated without either wanting to or enjoying it. It was simply due to mechanical stimulation, habit, and exhaustion.
The more relaxed mood disappeared as quickly and as suddenly as it had come. Sherlock twisted John's handkerchief between his fingers again.
Greg growled in a low voice and yanked Mycroft's shirt out of his trousers, shoving his hands beneath it to get his hands on bare skin. Mycroft shivered, and Greg sighed happily.
, John. There are three of them," Mike tried to calm him. Then he looked at Sherlock with a bewildered frown. "I looked at the invoices myself and didn't see anything. How..."
"Yeah, I... It was serious. At least it was for John," Mike explained, as if he found the subject embarrassing. "More than that... I can't really say. If John hasn't told you anything then I shouldn't either."
This time, Sherlock's scream was a combination of pain and arousal, and another stream of the milky fluid flowed out of the glistening tip of his penis.
Sherlock felt bereft, suddenly deprived of the loss of contact against his groin, and groaned softly. He pressed his forehead against the back of the couch.
When the column of ash had reached an impressive length (Sherlock gauged it at over two inches – a further proof of the high quality of the cigar), John directed his gaze back to Sherlock for the first time in forever (or at least it felt like that to Sherlock).
Right then, at that moment, the universe finally smiled on John Watson. Before he was forced to focus on that question more thoroughly and stir up his psyche any further, something vibrated in his trouser pocket.
'. (Which he, admittedly, rarely used. There was simply no need. He had the real thing, the genuine article, in his life.)
from Sherlock? Of course, he'd get what he wanted - what he needed - and yet he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd be taking advantage of Sherlock's constant, boundless, willing attitude. Wasn't it more than enough already that he'd been so accommodating after the mayoral election? That he'd surrendered himself to John so completely and given him everything he'd needed so badly at that moment?
"Good night, Sherlock," John said, and Sherlock retired to the upper floor of the house. He bore a certain resemblance to a wet poodle, despite his stiff posture.
"No, John," came the impassive reply. "I said that's not important. But you can fuck my throat quite deep in this position. It's the best way."
"All right..." John said, drawing the words out. "Let's get started. On your knees," he ordered. Sherlock obeyed without hesitation. In a single, flowing movement, he fell to his knees, bringing his mouth to the same height as John's crotch. John grabbed a handful of the dark curls with one hand and pulled the now docile young man's face closer to his body – closer to where he wanted him.
All of a sudden, Sherlock's focus snapped to a spot behind John's shoulder. His eyes narrowed and he let out a short cry. "There it is!"
"Doc... er... Mr Watson!" Miss Adler's doorman stammered in greeting as soon as he opened the door in answer to John's knock. "But... it's Friday..."
Hadn't he promised himself he was going to take control of his own life and not just stand around waiting for life to be something that
Their tongues met and John could practically hear the erotic crackling in the air as he forgot everything else around him.
"I'm not as unscrupulous as you when it comes to calling in favours," John countered with a smile. "So, genius - what did I buy?"
Two other waiters were lifting up a large ice sculpture next to the platters with the attractively arranged hors-d'oeuvres. Greg frowned. Everything was supposed to be set up before the opening speeches began.
Mrs Turner nattered on about everything and nothing, Thomas grinned while he cleaned some shoes, and Eleanor sewed buttons onto his and John's shirts, blushing faintly when she noticed Sherlock watching her. Sherlock's cheeks turned pink as well when he recalled how and in the course of which activity those shirts had lost their buttons in the first place. He quickly hid his face in his cup and drank the hot cocoa that Mrs Turner had prepared especially for him. It tasted of childhood and happiness and comfort.
Finally, Mycroft gave in with a quiet sigh. "Some sort of non-aggression pact then?" he asked with a tortured smile. "Peaceful co-existence?"
Sherlock tilted his head to one side and opened his mouth as if he were about to speak, only to snap it shut again. His eyes narrowed, and he observed John silently for several moments. John could practically see the cogs turning in Sherlock's brain, but they were moving slowly – unusually slowly.
As soon as John had halfway returned to his senses, he put the phone up against his ear again. "Sherlock?"
"Yes," John confirmed, his voice firm. "Watch. Maybe that will finally cure you. But first... first we need to make sure you stay right where you are and don't do anything stupid." He walked around Sherlock, crouched down behind him and linked together the carabiners on the cuffs around his wrists. Then Sherlock heard John – his cruel, perfect John – doing something with the ropes which lay at the ready. And then all of a sudden John's lips were on his shoulder, soft and warm and moist … on that one particular spot behind his ear... and then very faintly: "Use your safeword, okay? No false pride."
Later that same night, Greg lay stretched out on the floor of the office, his head resting on Mycroft's lap. In contrast to Mycroft - who was only naked from the waist down, his upper body almost entirely clothed in shirt and tie - Greg was in a completely textile-free state.
"Your suit is ruined," Sherlock noted. It didn't sound as if he particularly regretted it. "And the crossbar on this chair is broken..."
Don't laugh... that's really the name of the church that Mycroft and John visit. And that's exactly why I chose it... and because it also happens to have a side chapel for Mary Magdalene... you know... before good old MM met Jesus, she was in the same line of work as Sherlock.
And now neither John nor Sherlock was answering their phones, which was why Mike was stopping by on his way home to make sure everything was all right.
"Yeah?" he answered it, his voice gravelly, but the ringing didn't stop. He stared at the phone in confusion.
before? But that you perhaps... have wanted to tell him for quite a long time?" Call-Me-Ella pressed.
“Do you remember that meeting two weeks ago? When I was late and didn't want to tell you why? And you automatically assumed it was something filthy?” John asked in a challenging manner.
That was the reason it was not only dusty but also hot in the old, abandoned construction site. The windows had been put in, but not much else, and pale grey concrete dust already coated John's shoes and worked its way into the men's lungs with every breath of the stale air.
"There's a rotten apple in John's organisation," Sherlock declared with an odd sort of satisfaction. "I think I know where to start digging now."
Mycroft watched him for a long time. Eventually, he turned around and left as well. He needed to find out more about this Donovan. Slowly but surely, she was getting too dangerous for all of them.
. I told her she should add your debts to the price. Which she did. I don't know how much it was – or what you actually owed her – and I don't care... but if there's anything else, then tell me. If she still has anything on you … tell me and I promise I'll make it go away.”
A sly grin appeared on Greg's face. "That you're going to think about what we did here every time you sit down to work? I certainly hope so."
John had to suppress a grin. He'd seen through Sherlock by now, even as the other man threw his hands in the air and cried, "What does a person have to do around here to get a good fucking?"
"He never told you about Victor?" Mike asked, only to promptly answer his own question: "No, of course he didn't." He sighed heavily. "Victor and John... Victor used to be John's boyfriend."
John chewed sceptically on the inside of his cheek before tossing his arms up. “All right, fine! If that's the way you want it … then...” He took a deep breath. “Agreed.”
"Oh really? It doesn't concern me?" Irene asserted insistently. "Fine, then I won't show you the text message Jason received last night, the one he was so excited about."
A single dark eyebrow went up. "Oh, really?" Mycroft remarked with so much condescending arrogance that John's fingers twitched. But he overcame the almost overwhelming desire to wipe that fake, smart-alecky smile off the mayor's face with his fists.
"No one's ever come back to me," Sherlock murmured, both relieved and astounded. Only now did John reach out a hand to tentatively run it through Sherlock's dark curls.
Agitated, he left the living room, went down the stairs and out into the garden. But not even a turn in the fresh air did any good. On top of everything else, the early spring had given way to a rather odious April. The sun was shining, to be sure, but the air was damp and the rising wind was cold, driving Sherlock back into the house.
might offer you." Sherlock opened his eyes to find John's dark gaze resting on him. "Come here..." John demanded. Sherlock went.
"You noticed that quick enough," Sherlock laughed, wiping his eyes. The laughter and the movement of his abdominal muscles pushed John abruptly out of the warm, narrow orifice, and he gasped for air.
"So you're still not going to leave the house," John stated with a sigh that was more an expression of relief that there wasn't going to be any sweet talk required of him than it was over his annoyance at Sherlock's refusal to go outside. At the same time, that relief made him uncomfortable, as if it were unjust of him to feel that way. He quickly shoved those unpleasant feelings into a corner of his brain and tried not to think about it any longer.
"I wish you an extremely exciting evening, Doctor," Miss Adler said, and walked away, humming a little tune to herself.
"Yes... please, John... help me... so that I don't... become disobedient..." Sherlock whispered in a voice that had slid down an entire octave and did unspeakable things to John's libido.
"You do realise we run the danger..." Mycroft started to point out before Greg's kisses interrupted him again. "… that a reporter will follow me at some point, and then..."
In those five days, however, Sherlock was uncharacteristically obedient, actually managing to avoid touching himself in a sensual or erotic manner. He should have been proud of himself for his compliance, as he would certainly earn John's approval for his self-control, but as it turned out, quite the opposite was the case. Sherlock was dissatisfied, bad-tempered, and irritable... even more so than was usual for him.
"What are you talking about, John?" Mike returned at the same volume. "You know how much I love to get yelled at by you, but not unprovoked! Not without a reason! I only meant well after you stood there and acted like a … like a … plantation owner."
“And then maybe I should keep going? Until you're completely empty and it even hurts a little to be touched? And you're twitching helplessly in my hand, not able to get hard again because you just came and sprayed your come all over my dick? Hmm? Like the sound of that?”
. Although it seemed that he was better at choosing his wardrobe than his repertoire when it came to him and his instrument. He shifted into Handel's '
John continued to look grumpy. "And no sooner would she have noticed her mistake than she'd up and quit," he pointed out gruffly. "And then we'd be right back where we started. Perfect," he remarked, the word thick with sarcasm. "There's no way that bird's coming into this house," he stated categorically.
Mycroft once again ignored the mild provocation resonating in John's tone and carried on: "Thank you. Additionally, I must request that you prevent Sherlock from getting into any trouble."
And now this – a perfect act of the most wonderful humiliation! Arousal cursed thick and heavy through Sherlock’s whole body and he was sure he looked like he felt: a complete and utter mess. But that wasn't important. It was only important to hear more of those degrading, filthy, and absolutely erotic words from John's usually kind lips. The humiliation and the embarrassment were sweeter than Sherlock had ever imagined. Not even his wildest, darkest dreams came close to this. His cheeks were aflame, but so was his cock. He couldn’t remember ever being this hard, this desperate and aroused. Words failed to describe how much he enjoyed this treatment from his lover. He knew how uncomfortable John had been with his suggestion and it was such a gift that John now – after all – overcame his initial discomfort.
"His doctors. He has virtually no memory of the evening... All that he believes to recall is that one of the men was blond and the other dark-haired," Holmes informed him readily.
"Should we give that cream another go?" Sherlock whispered in his deep, velvety soft baritone, and turned his upper body until he could reach the pitcher on the table. Rather than waiting for an answer, he drank a small sip of cream right from the pot. Then he turned back to John and very slowly raised one eyebrow.
"Exactly," Sherlock confirmed. "You always lock your office, so your files are fairly safe." John gave him a look that was both sardonic and challenging, and Sherlock responded with an unapologetic grin, "As long as no one forces their way in, which can't be ruled out entirely, but that would also never go unnoticed. Aside from that, those three are the only ones who can come and go without anyone remarking on it. They all have a key to your office and go in when you're not there..."
He started down the stairs, remaining alert. The passageway became wider and wider, finally ending in a spacious landing where yet another lamp stood, its warm light struggling valiantly against the darkness.
"You've been making inquiries about me," Sherlock said. His mouth felt as dry as a bone, and it was incredibly difficult for him to speak.
It was roughly a week later when John and Sherlock were celebrating the solution of a minor case ("It was the gardener! I should have seen this 3 hours ago!") with a nice blowjob in bed. John was lying between Sherlock's legs, licking with a broad tongue over Sherlock’s interested - but so far only half hard - cock... from root to glans and back again. Sherlock was moaning every now and then and without thinking John said: "You like it, when I lick your little prick, don't you?"
Sherlock thought, sneering to himself, all the while observing with fascination and envy the way John carefully balanced the cigar between thumb and forefinger in his left hand, holding it up to his ear.
"How come you're still a virgin then? I would have thought Miss Adler would offer up someone like you much sooner," John said, voicing his mild astonishment.
"You said... you promised you wouldn't hurt me intentionally," Sherlock called after him. John stopped and turned back. "You lied," Sherlock said with an odd look in his eyes that didn't match the coldness of his voice.
"Good boy," John praised him, his hungry gaze falling on Sherlock's stretched opening, gleaming with lubricant, as his fingers pumped in and out in a hypnotic rhythm.
The awareness of just how wrong he'd been hit him with full force, driving tears into his eyes. The hands he'd held behind his back let go now, flying to the legs of John's trousers, where they scrabbled desperately for a hold. Although John was the one who had dealt the blows, it was he from whom he sought comfort … and perhaps forgiveness. Just as he was about to bury his face - blinded by tears - in John's lap, careful, gentle hands on his cheeks held him back.
"You don't want me to submit. You don't want me to play a role. You don't want me to act something out. You want..." Sherlock's eyes narrowed, and he appeared to be somewhat at a loss.
"Why I do I have the feeling that wouldn't really be a punishment for you?" John asked sternly, but with a good-natured twinkle in his eye.
Doris sighed. She knew Violet was right. It was hard enough for her to struggle through alone with her daughter. Her ex-husband had disappeared somewhere abroad, and the welfare support she received was nowhere near enough.
"Mycroft?" Mike asked hesitantly before turning to John. "He did that before too. Why doesn't he call the mayor Mr Holmes? Why does he always call him Mycroft?"
"I haven't done anything, Doc," Charlie rasped hoarsely and coughed. A bloody string of saliva hung from his lip. "Nothing!" he then said, louder and clearer.
It was a relief – if a subconscious one – for John that Sherlock wasn't disgusted by his scar. Most of the men he spent time with tended to flinch instinctively away from the disfigurement, only to then pretend it wasn't there... which never worked, of course, and only served to annoy John. Reactions like that had led ever more frequently to John not removing all of his clothing for certain
"You..." John had to swallow hard. He'd been prepared for just about any reaction... but this surpassed them all. "You aren't... disgusted?"
variety. Negative on all fronts. He noted the way John's arms hung down beside his body, how his hands formed into fists even as he continued standing in the doorway.
"Don't..." Sherlock begged breathlessly, squeezing all his muscles in order to feel John's wonderful hard length for just a moment longer. "Not yet..."
Through the half-open curtains, blue moonlight filtered into the room, which was otherwise illuminated only by the lamp on the nightstand, painting a circle of yellow light on the wall and floor. And in the middle of that circle stood John in shirtsleeves and trousers, pouring amber liquid out of a clear bottle into a glass. He looked up when the door opened. His eyes empty, he set the bottle down on the nightstand, drained the glass in a single swallow, and put it next to the bottle. Then he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and approached Sherlock.
No sooner had he set foot over the threshold than he was hit by the typical smell of garlic, basil, and strong, hot espresso. It was a scent from his younger days, and like every time when he was virtually enveloped in the aroma, he was overcome by a certain sentimentality. How often had he and Mike drunk a cappuccino here when they were still running around as bag men... they'd always sat at the little round table in the corner...
And there was something else that was different and unfamiliar for Sherlock. It wasn't unusual for them to have sex together every night; but it was new for John to turn off the lights every time and dispense with all the ingredients that had characterised and shaped their sexual activity up to now.
Sherlock's forehead creased. “You always come here alone, without...” His gaze wandered to the door as if he expected to see a heavily armed guard standing behind it. He blushed faintly and turned back to John.
John nodded. "Saved my life." Sherlock's arms tightened even more around his body at those words, and John squeezed a little harder with the arm that was wrapped around Sherlock's shoulders as well.
His hands trembled as he lifted the case out of the box - a reaction that filled him with disgust. A thick folder was revealed underneath it. Sherlock recognised it at once and frowned. Why had Mycroft sent him all their sheet music? And a music stand too? He set the case down carefully on the table. Then he took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and flipped open the clasps. He stared down at the dark case for a long time, unable to stand the sight of his shaking hands as he raised the lid. His lips were dry. He tried to moisten them with his tongue, but in vain. Why had he been so eager to wake sleeping dogs once more? What had he wanted to prove to himself? Wouldn't it be better to pack everything up again and throw it away than to face his fears? Why didn't he simply stick his head in the sand and wait until his internal demons left him in peace and...
"John! JOHN! Oh yes! Yes! YES! God... I... I... John..." Sherlock lost the ability to form words at that point, and all that could be heard was blissful sobbing.
Maybe he would find out tonight. And maybe he should give Mike a bonus ... a new car, or a holiday for him and Susan at an exclusive spa... after all, he was the one who had suggested that John honour Miss Adler's establishment with his presence that evening. And even though it hadn't seemed like it at the time, it was by far the best idea Mike had had in a long while.
“For heaven's sake,” Irene cried, tossing her hands up. “The man has other things to do than shag you. You see him every other day as it is!”
"I simply don't understand," Sherlock admitted grudgingly, making it clear that John's retreat wasn't just a heavy blow to his libido, but also to his intellect. "What was all of that about?" With a broad gesture, he indicated himself and the bed he was still lying on.
"Joooohhnnn," he pleaded. "Please... I'm about to come... let me... ejaculate... pleeease... I want to..."
The dark-haired man undulating in pleasure there in the mirror beneath John's kisses and thrusts was not only beautiful... he was breathtaking.
Sherlock decided not to mention that John could also make his own omelette or sandwich, if that were the case.
When he was seated in the tub behind Sherlock, Sherlock let his head fall back against John's shoulder.
"A stupid idea," Sherlock admitted, his cheeks tinged pink, and rubbed a hand over his face to wake up a bit more.
"Yeah," John agreed with quiet, grim determination. "Now I'm also scared witless on top of being angry and I don't even know
"Thank you," Sherlock whispered. "You know... it wasn't always like this. I always had a reputation for ... swallowing anything, but I didn't really start doing it until I... was living on the streets."
"You've never surrendered yourself to anyone else the way you have to me," John said quietly yet urgently, almost feverishly.
"You don't know what love is," Victor hurled at him, devastatingly, and John felt an icy chill creeping into his hands, his feet, his head.
"What do you have in mind?" Lestrade repeated his question, but this time it was coloured by genuine interest, and the shadow of a smile passed over the mayor's face.
to say it. I bloody well love saying it!” The smirk disappeared from her face, however, when she looked up and saw Sherlock's sober expression, which really did worry her.
Sherlock watched wide-eyed as John sat down on one of the chairs with his trousers open, took out his half-hard penis, and reached for the small pitcher.
"Honest to the end," John remarked in a peculiar tone of voice. "Fine," he said after a moment. "Let's move on to your punishment. Straighten up. Hands behind your back."
Exhausted and strangely empty, yet filled with a peculiar calm, Sherlock lowered the bow and looked out through the open windows... out at the green grass and the clear blue sky, and everything in him sang:
A narrow smile graced Sherlock’s full lips. “I’m not made of glass, Mike. And I’m not some damsel in distress.”
At any rate, he knew who he could rely on. Inspector Lestrade's honesty and integrity had made an unusually strong impression on Mycroft. He would trust the man in a second. The Inspector, however - once he'd resumed work following his hospital stay - had remained deliberately professional, businesslike, and extremely close-lipped.
He snapped his mouth shut and looked around, almost anxiously, to see whether anyone or anything was there that might take that belief in himself away again. But no matter how much he looked and sensed and marvelled - there was nothing. Nothing and no one. The words became more firmly embedded in his mind and in his soul. Implanted themselves, multiplied, underwent a change and propagated, and suddenly there were four:
"All the problems in Bayswater Road... and Soho... the fake invoices," John went on as a cold rage welled up in him. Rage at Moran, at Moriarty, and at himself. "Was Max Graves one of your people?"
When Sherlock's phone rang that evening, announcing John's call, he felt more in control and not quite as pitiful as he had earlier.
with a rival who had been too cowardly to shoot at John from the front. It hadn't ended up helping him anyway. At least his headstone – paid for by John; he knew how these things were done – was the nicest in the whole cemetery.
"Obvious?" Mike repeated in a mocking tone of voice. "You barely glanced at him out of the corner of your eye. How could you tell?!"
Once again, John had to focus on breathing slowly in and out in order to rein in the urge to throw the tosser to the floor and fuck him hard and fast. What was it about the man that drove John to the point he lost control of himself every time within just a few minutes? Nothing like this had ever happened to him before with any other man.
"Mr Watson? I'll bring the bags upstairs then," the young man said, speaking in muted tones. John simply nodded.
He performed on Sherlock's body with the riding crop with a virtuosity equal to that which Sherlock achieved with his bow on his violin. John caressed and chastised, incited and dampened, awakened and destroyed... Sherlock's body stretched and extended, and his arse - which was already burning like fire from the previous blows - arched hungrily toward the crop. His maltreated skin welcomed the painful kisses... he felt the rasp of the leather licking his skin like the hot tongue of a lover, felt the pain blazing right under the surface of his skin until the heat and flame moved into his crotch and his cock stiffened.
Irene had kept mum on the identity of his client, but Sherlock suspected - and his suspicions were generally spot on – that it must be a politician or other celebrity who valued discretion. Sherlock really couldn't have cared less. He didn't read tabloids and he didn't give a toss which actor had just got married or which singer had just received a Grammy. If his client really was a well-known public figure, the chances were good that Sherlock wouldn't recognise him. Given that, Irene's decision to send this particular guest his way made quite a lot of sense.
But, as the weeks wore on, there started to be something…wrong. John couldn’t put his finger on it. Couldn’t define exactly what was off, but he knew there was something missing. Not for him, thanks. He was with the man he’d been pining over for months, was having sex on a regular basis, and was arse over tits in love. He was satisfied. More than satisfied.
“R-rub my... my man... my man-clit, please,” Sherlock mumbled obediently, bucking his hips helplessly. The blush on his pale skin had spread to his chest and his nipples were deliciously small, hard pebbles.
Sherlock seemed to recognise that his choice of songs wasn't entirely appropriate, and almost imperceptibly eased into
Mycroft Holmes bit down on his lip. "I'm afraid you weren't listening carefully," he accused John. "I said I
. The words were on the tip of John's tongue before he knew where they came from. He was just able to catch himself in time and swallow the rest of the sentence, even going so far as to banish it from his memory. He cleared his throat. "It's enough to have you
He fed Sherlock a sandwich, gave him something to drink, stroked his hair and gave him all the time he needed.
"Oh God... John... I … I can't," Sherlock begged. The pressure and the delicious pull in his genitals was getting stronger with every stroke... with every second...
However, he fell abruptly silent at that point in his little prepared speech, as there were more men in suits pushing their way into the hall behind John.
Then, when John finally left them alone in the office three days after that nighttime phone call, Mike was less interested in Charlie White than in the conversation between Sherlock and his wife Susan.
A pained expression flashed across Sherlock's face. "Why do you keep saying that?" he blurted out in distress. "I know it's not true. There is absolutely no reason to humiliate me. At least not like that..."
In hindsight, the plan to speak to her in a darkened parking garage hadn't been very well thought out, given that Anthea wasn't especially skittish, and had additionally been equipped with pepper spray. He'd noticed during that incident how energetic she was, and that she was possessed of qualities and talents that were going completely unused in her job at the time - but which were (as he later became aware) wonderful prerequisites for filling the position as his secretary. He didn't have any qualms that she might double-cross him the way she had Doc Watson. He paid her too well for that, and she obviously enjoyed the power and prestige that went with her new job. Plus, it had enabled him to pull one more over on Doc Watson.
"Not exactly." John stood up, dipped his fingers in the mashed potatoes on his plate, scooped up a small amount, and walked around the table to Sherlock. "I was thinking more of hand-feeding."
John sucked on his upper lip so hard Sherlock could hear it. "Those aren't my eyes," he remarked without so much as a trace of humour or amusement.
Greg stared down at it for a moment, somewhat bewildered, then gave Mycroft an understanding - if disappointed - look, moistened his lips with his tongue and then took the proffered hand.
"Then stop exposing it to magnets. That will make even the best compass go wonky and stop working, in case you didn't know.”
), giving him no other choice than to accede to the request with a nervous twitch of his right eye. Irene accepted the cup with elegance and as if she'd never expected anything else.
' did you not understand?” Sherlock asked with icy politeness. “Anyway, you didn't call. You didn't wait for me to ask you in. You simply showed up here, thinking you could buy and sell me according to your whims, ordering me about however you please? Did you ever consider for
"Yes..." Mycroft Holmes nodded pensively. "I'd say so as well." He didn't seem to be entirely satisfied, however.
His entrance was even more dramatic than he'd hoped. The two men - sitting opposite each other in two dark armchairs - fell silent immediately. Two pairs of eyes were trained on him. One was steely blue, disapproving, cool, controlled, yet just a bit surprised - the other dark blue, disbelieving, a little bit amused, a little curious and a little annoyed.
The sight that greeted him, however, was one he couldn't have anticipated in his wildest dreams. Sherlock sat on
The full, still slightly open mouth suddenly lay on top of John's, kissing him with passion and desire.
"FRIDAY!" John completed her exclamation, gritting his teeth grimly. "I KNOW!" He then continued on his way. His two bodyguards followed him at his signal, their expressions stoic.
," he added in a dark mutter. But his logical objection didn't seem to have any effect on John, who continued to stare at him as if he'd taken leave of his senses.
"I just have to... lube or Vaseline..." John whispered, his voice rough, and felt Sherlock's smile against his cheek.
"I know," Sherlock cut her off in his typical forward manner. "But I don't want you to think I'm ... an
But Mycroft surprised him yet again. He skipped the topic of love entirely, concentrating instead on a completely different aspect.
Sherlock shook his head firmly. "Buy the concierge," he declared decisively. "The concierge has a key to the flat, he knows when Mycroft comes and goes..."
Gasping for air, he collapsed against Sherlock, who only now removed his fingers from John's throat and held him by the shoulders. John could feel the beginnings of Sherlock's erection against his stomach and glanced at the clock on the mantel. Dammit! Mike was almost certainly waiting downstairs for him. He brushed his knuckles apologetically over the hard swelling in Sherlock's pyjama trousers, heard his breath stutter and said, "Sorry, but I really don't have time." He stepped back from Sherlock, who watched him with an inscrutable expression.
Sherlock was quivering with tension and impatience. But he needed to endure, needed to wait for whatever John was going to do. When John placed his hand on the nape of Sherlock's neck, every fibre in his being yearned for his lover, and he offered his lips for a kiss with a sob of relief.
Greg's shoulders telegraphed the moment of his capitulation loud and clear. "Yeah, all right. I'll go check."
Naturally, he was now expected to lower his gun. Well, they could wait until they were blue in the face. He kept his aim on Moriarty, not to be distracted.
"Bullshit," Greg cursed softly. "You're not going to all this trouble for Doc Watson. Your brother means something to you... no matter what you say. You worry about him."
The lips released Sherlock's rigid flesh for a moment, but before he had time to fall into a pit of despair, John whispered against his stomach: “It's okay,” and then he was surrounded again with warmth, friction, and wetness. All of his dammed-up lust broke through, discharged in a scream and a cramp-like tremor that seemed to go on forever. The ropes escaped from between his teeth, and tears ran down his cheeks as he climaxed in John's mouth.
