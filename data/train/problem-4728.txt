“Shh,” the father said, “I’ve got you now, little Thumper, no one is taking you from me.” He was relieved to feel her relax a little at that – shooting a quick thanks upwards that he had said the right thing. She maneuvered herself a little until she was curled up in bed facing him, no hint of leaving the man or the bed. He smiled as he laid back down, pulling her close to his chest and wrapping his arm around her.
Several pictures of her in what looked like her partaking in drunken shenanigans with her fellow classmates.
Safe, thoroughly exhausted and feeling more love than she probably deserved, her eyes quickly shut as sleep consumed her.
has been approved to join the team,” Steve said with a stern tone, even though she could tell sitting in his lap it didn’t bother her father too much.
The warm feeling came back, so Steve stopped the two to pull his love in for a kiss before answering him.
“Fine, Jesus when you said you were moving back I was actually excited…” Bucky said in fake disappointment, laughing when Steve just shoved him playfully. “Just let me text Sam, he’ll probably want to mooch a ride too.”
"Do you see anything? Anything new?" she asked as he looked another moment before he gently lowered her shirt back down.
“What’s a code Jolly Green Giant?” Daci asked as the doors to the elevator opened, a loud roar answering her question. The rest of the Avengers were splayed out across the mats, seemingly exhausted and still in uniform while Hulk - who she hadn’t met yet - was rumbling around.
Tony walked over to kiss them both on the cheek, loving the blush that only a Rogers could really do justice. He walked alongside the pair, making sure to snap a picture or two when they weren’t looking.
He hesitated, wondering if Steve was the better man for this job, double guessing if she’d even want comfort right now. Tony never even met the guy, so how could he help her remember the man to calm her down?
“Baby boy we talked about this,” Tony said before whispering the rest of the conversation with his son. Her father had gently grabbed her wrist, turning her attention towards him.
“Lot lonelier than it sounds,” Tony mumbled and Steve instantly whirled around to face the other teen.
“Yeah, me too,” Steve said with a shrug, trying to be nonchalant. The laugh he got from the Omega told him he wasn’t successful.
"Did those words really come out of your mouth? Are you feeling okay, baby?" he said before smiling at the man.
He held his hand up to his ear, seriously contemplating taking it out to have an excuse when he heard a familiar voice.
“–Why would you tell me that?” she asked incredulously. “What…what did you think would happen after you dropped that bombshell on me? That I’d go running into your arms? As if realizing…that my
He literally shakes his head to concentrate, and remind himself to behave (even though, for the record, Tony had been the one to approve of that particular hall pass…so long as it was filmed. By Tony. Before he joined them. The bastard said this over lunch at their favorite restaurant, which earned a quick kick under the table from the blonde. He had to go to work immediately after – )
Wade waited another moment before finally saying, “okay. But you’re paying for dinner and providing transportation. My car had an…unfortunate accident. Pick me up at 7 on Saturday.” He turned to leave and Peter felt like he might cry or explode or just dissolve into existence right then. Did he just say yes?
They were silent as they made their way to his car, her Dad speaking up when they started making their way back home.
“The baby can hear me?” Harley asked, trying to hide a smile as he leaned closer. “Hi baby, I’m your brother. We have the same Daddy, but know he was mine first.” Tony chuckled and hugged his son again, planting a kiss on his pup’s head.
"So Tati, does this mean you two are...together?" his daughter asked, hope in her eyes and voice as she looked back and forth between him and Clint. The archer had downed the entire coffee before putting his empty cup on the bedside table, freeing up his hand. Which Bucky took with his metal one before turning to his kid and nodding. "Yay!" Daci cheered in excitement, getting a laugh out of the adults as Bucky felt the grip on his hand tighten.
“I’ll take it back!” she threatened. Steve gave her a quick swat for that, stopping in his tracks when she retaliated in kind.
“Yeah well, they’d tease whether I took your name or not, I just didn’t…” she trailed off, deciding she should finally tell him the truth. “I already told you when I was drugged up that it wasn’t cause of my Dad. It was…it was once again about Steve,” she said with a smile. He laughed fondly at that, sitting closer to her to listen.
On the Saturday about a month before their vacation, Emerson finally decided on a haircut and asked the blonde to take her. Tony was gone for the weekend at a Stark convention in LA, which she asked if they could surprise him by not telling him until he saw it in person. Steve almost disagreed but decided it would be too great not to. They'd text Peter pictures, but they knew he always loved keeping a secret from their Dad. That morning, when Emerson refused to show her idea to her father, Miles had joined them and asked if he could also get his hair cut.
Her head hurt. The pain registered along with feeling of ropes around her hands, tied down to something. Her back was against a solid surface, her feet barely touching the ground. She felt her eyes blink open but still saw darkness, she shifted her face a little, realizing fabric was around her head and thus inhibiting her from seeing. Kidnapped, tied to a fucking chair and blindfolded, she concluded to herself, trying to remember what the hell happened.
“The nurse is bringing him, Tony. Just hang on a second he isn’t far. I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you woke up my love. I was telling Peter how amazing you are.”
Also the photo they chose for the cover is a shout out to my favorite Presidential couple - Barack and Michelle Obama. It's a very sweet picture; the photographer caught them in a very cute moment, where Michelle later said she remembered during the photo-shoot break that she was telling her husband to 'get it together' since he was pouting about having to take pictures XD
“Makes more sense than Joey doing something that stupid again. She knows what happened last time…” he teased to lighten the tension, glad to see Steve’s smile at that.
“Hey!” her father barked out again, gripping her arm and yanking her to the side, away from the small crowd that had gathered. “What the hell just happened? Did you use your powers in public?” She nodded, unable to lie to him and starting to feel a little afraid at how angry he was.
It didn’t take too long after that when they touched down back at the Tower. Bruce and Natasha helped Clint to medical while Tony and Steve went back to their floor, along with Thor who returned to his. Bucky wanted to go to bed but Daci insisted they go watch Clint and make sure he was okay.
“Yeah, well it’ll help you feel less like shit tomorrow morning,” the blonde reiterated after failing to attempt to hold back a laugh.
his Pop muttered with teasing smile, getting him a glare and scoot from his husband. The blonde laughed aloud at the brunette's movement and reached out to pull him back onto his lap. Peter briefly saw his Dad cross his arms and pout before the teenager just closed his eyes, not wanting to watch the pair.
“And you’re letting Pop attend that?” she asked with a quirked brow. He chuckled at his daughter before responding.
“The worst of them,” Steve confirmed aloud, smiling when she gave a small smile in return. “Just, promise me Joey. Especially right now, you’ll lie under the radar and you know…behave?” he added with a wink to soften it. It seemed to work, as the teen rolled her eyes fondly at the man.
“Well for the record,” she heard her Dad say. “Captain America and Iron Man wouldn’t go down so easily against a pathetic, D grade, wannabe gangster, child-raping, fuck-face, shit-bag – okay?” She couldn’t stop the laughs rumbling from deep in her belly, nor the few more to follow when she heard Steve hitting Tony, eliciting an “ow!” from the genius billionaire.
He’d even reach out to Tony, who apologized but had some mandatory meetings to attend and was having Ruth watch Peter for the day.
Tony, the same man who had a wisecrack response to every statement, looked at Steve without so much as opening his mouth.
A moment later the door opened, the two turning to watch as the nurse wheeled in a glass box...with...with a sleeping pup inside.
“I dreamt…” she began before turning to rest her head on his shoulders to be heard more clearly, “I dreamt that Stone guy killed you. He blew up your car. And…it was just like in Dad’s dream when…I couldn’t do anything to stop it.”
“Stop being paranoid, Sam. We are not ganging up on you,” her Uncle Bruce said giving him another plus four after Em had reversed it. The three laughed out loud as Sam actually growled in frustration. Emerson curled over herself as she laughed harder when he went off on a tangent.
“That’s true but so are you. You were my first pup. Baby bear to my Papa Bear,” Steve said as he pulled the pup into his lap, kissing his blonde head. “I love you Harley. Just as much as I love your Daddy and Peter.”
"You feeling better Thumper?" the brunette asked her, noticing how she curled up further into Steve's embrace.
The gun never went off, however, just shot out of his hand from a loud pulse as he now grabbed that too in pain, toppling over himself. A familiar red and yellow mechanical suit stood in the door way, one arm raised in the air. The Iron Man took a step forward before her Dad materializing out of the suit.
“Seriously? You two?” Tony asked again with a frown. He sighed dramatically before continuing, counting off the reasons on his fingers.
It got more cheers from his mate’s loved ones and a tired smile from the pup, who nodded shyly in response. Harley lifted his arms as Steve quickly brought him up to his chest before turning back to the doctor.
“Jerk.” With that, Bucky quickly made his way back to his floor as the guilt started to resurface. Jesus had he really said those things to his own kid? That she was the reason he wasn’t happy?
James, being the cheating motherfucking that he is, went straight to Clint’s tickle spot instead of being an adult and reached around to pinch his ass.
“This morning. Your mother is out shopping with Anna for baby stuff. She wanted to let you sleep in so she grabbed him and didn’t put him down until I suggested a shopping trip. She tried taking him with her but I said as a new Omega mother you’d freak out if Harley wasn’t home when you woke up,” his father explained with a serious expression before it melted and he spoke softly, “It was the only way I could get to hold my grandson.”
And out of the shadows, like a knight in shiny black armor, came Clint with a gun extended from his right hand. Clint eyed Bucky while he walked over to them, Rumlow’s friends quickly abandoning him on the floor, scrambling to run away.
She watched with a quirked brow as Steve drew lines along the paper, some solid and some dotted, before carefully writing a word she assumed was her name.
Emerson had chosen "I'm Too Sexy," which earned a snort from Steve before he was able to regain his composure. He stood near the couch as Miles brought his first outfit out, rocking the hell out of a tiny and adorable Tom Ford.
“Alright! We get it Thor. Thanks for stopping by,” Steve said, pushing the god in the direction of the exit, if only half- heartedly. After he left he turned back to the two teenagers, still smiling from Thor’s teasing.
“Yeah, well…your Pop and I want to take a beach trip together before, you know…I’m…limited?” he tried, unsure how to phrase it.
“You pinky promise, Papa?” the boy asked adorably, head still buried in his Daddy’s neck but sticking his pinky out to the blonde.
“Emerson, we don’t find any joy making you think or talk about what has happened. Steve and I don’t secretly giggle to ourselves at our own
“There’s uh...there’s another one,” Steve said quietly, turning his gaze to the ceiling as he handed another sheet of paper to the genius. The first drawing was gently put to the side as he used the second one to cover his now growing erection.
Tony squeaked a little before laughing at his new position looking down at Steve, arms still wrapped around his shoulders as Steve moved his arms to better support him.
“Not if I can help it!” Steve snapped back with a raised voice, startling himself and his love. Tony’s face scrunched up in a panic-confusion combo as he stared back at him. The super soldier sighed heavily before deciding now was the time to admit a secret of his.
"Fine, did uh...did you sleep okay Pop?" she said looking questioningly at his unshaven face. He rubbed his cheek absently, a little self conscious of it.
“Yes, I knew we smelled differently. Yes, your father knows. Yes, I’m fine and yes, Harley, Pepper, Rhodey, Natasha and now Howard have all given me shovel talks. You have an amazing family that loves you. And I can’t wait for you to meet mine,” the Alpha purred in his ear as he wrapped an arm around the smaller man’s waist. Tony looked at him for a moment before leaning up to kiss him, fuzzy feelings in his chest when the Alpha pulled him closer and completed the hug.
“Peter?” Tony asked with a small smile, body slowly relaxing as he felt the tears come down for a different reason.
Familiar arms wrapped him from behind, blaming the loud coffee machine for not being able to hear his husband join him.
“His name’s Lucky,” James said quietly, shifting from foot to foot. “He’s yours. Well, ours but he’ll stay with you.” Clint just stared back at him in awe before turning back to the cutie in his arms...before turning back to the cutie still shifting around anxiously. “I thought...you know dogs are good support animals. And you could talk to him or not talk to him and just play with him. I’d help with costs and training and stuff-”
"He had some last minute stuff come up, so I'm terribly sorry you won't have the opportunity to do it, my princess," Peter said before yelping - Emerson could imagine Shuri had hit him for that comment. The eighteen year old quickened her steps to catch up with her parents, not wanting to seem like a creep. She laughed as she stood next to her Pop, listening as T'Challa answered the ten million questions Miles had about the suit.
Tony remained quiet, not answering Steve’s additional questions as he quickly pulled into a familiar driveway.
They were quiet the ride to the Tower, the ride up the elevator and the walk to the art studio. It wasn’t until Steve came a little while later that any words were spoken.
“This one is small and cheap, I promise,” her Dad said, handing her the small rectangular box with Wonder Woman wrapping paper; excellent choice.
"Uh oh, that tone can't be good Thumper," he said with a pointed look to his daughter, whose face was red in embarrassment.
“No I -” she got out before being electrocuted once more. She cried out in pain, earning her another slap on her face. Tears fell down her cheeks, the gut-wrenching desire for her father suddenly crushing her soul.
She woke up on the morning of her eighteenth birthday, wondering if she could fall back asleep and wake up in the afternoon. She didn't even feel particularly bad, she just never really cared about birthdays and wanted to sleep most of the day away.
It was a picture of a rabbit with a graduation cap, adorable and heart warming as she turned back to the Dean; shaking his hand and accepting the diploma before turning back to her family and thrust her diploma in the air.
He tightened his arms around her before whispering back, “anytime, baby girl.” Her eyelids grew heavy as she fell into a peaceful sleep.
“What are you talking about? She was here this morning, right when I woke up.” Peter stayed hidden, not responding to him.
“We should bring Steve some food at his station.” Tony turned to her with a confused expression as they drove out of the school parking lot.
“Tiberius,” Tony said flatly back, or at least he hoped so…he’d had a few drinks, before leaning into Steve’s side. The man blessedly wrapped an arm around his waist, which he also noticed Ty’s face form a frown from that.
“Look, Mr. Rogers, we appreciate you looking after our Tony, but we have a very serious matter to discuss,” Obadiah intervened, stepping in between the men, ever the diplomat.
. It sounds like Steve was justified with freaking out, especially if she’s only sixteen,” Rhodey said as they two drank afternoon coffee out on Tony’s balcony.
She unwrapped it, feeling the two pairs of eyes on hers and was suddenly speechless at the gift in front of her. It was a simple and small black frame, a picture of the four of them inside from when they had taken her to try a local ice cream shop for the first time – a few weeks after she started staying with them. Pepper was with them that day and must have snuck the picture while the four hadn’t noticed. She traced her finger over the glass, still not sure what to say. She looked up with tears in her eyes at her Dads. Her parents; two men who loved her unconditionally, both of whom were sporting matching watery eyes with the teen.
“Yes well, that could be part of the reason why you are overthinking this.” She could only gape back at him at that, offended at the accusation. But then again, she did ask T’Challa, the man you can always count on to tell the blunt truth. “Perhaps if I could read the letter, I could help you find your answer.”
“Thank you. You are of course invited, Wade. And well, your Dad wants to invite half the planet for a big blow out.”
Steve definitely should’ve called in to work the next day. He was beyond exhausted. He even tried going for an additional run this morning. But now he was mentally, emotionally
“My name is James Rhodes, but everyone calls me Rhodey or Jim. Except for this unfunny child,” Rhodey said, shooting a smirk Tony’s way that he maturely returned with an outstretched tongue. “It’s nice to meet you Daci. I take it your father’s a new Avenger Anthony just so happened to forget to mention?” She nodded silently before giving Tony a confused look.
“I’m sorry you didn’t get to see the rest of the animals, Daci. And that, you know, your Dad’s kind of a dick.” That put a smile on her face, curling up next to the blonde when he sat by her. Without any prompting, she climbed into his lap and made herself comfortable in the arms of the archer she trusted whole-heartedly. “Plus for the record, I think you did the right thing. It’s not like you used your brain-squashing ability…” She could only grunt in disapproval at his suggestion, burrowing further into his embrace when he chuckled and tightened his arms around her. “You know what I mean, I just...don’t beat yourself up too much over it, okay?”
She stepped out of the elevator and walked into the three guys sitting casually in the living room. Peter’s hair was wet and he was in pajamas, sitting in between Tony and Steve laughing together and covered in blankets. They stopped talking as she stopped in the entranceway, unsure what to do.
They probably weren’t even going to come, remembering her Pop’s promise about letting her rot in jail before beating her ass.
"That's alright little man, you didn't know," Wade continued reassuring him before he shot a glance over at a smiling Emerson.
"You must be the newest Stark," the British man growled at the girl as he folded his arms across his chest. "Your daddy and I go way back."
Bucky would call Steve multiple times a week when Joey was a baby, begging his little brother for help in taking care of the tornado that was that sweet girl. Their mom – who they lost when Joey was only 4 – worked as a nurse. She helped when she could…but ultimately Steve was the go-to Joey wrangler. When she was a toddler, ‘terrible twos’ did not do her justice. ‘Tyrannical twos’ was more like it. And god help the poor soul who tried taking a toy from the child when she really wanted to play with it. She was a monster. An incredibly adorable and mostly sweet monster, but still a monster. Or tiny terrorist, as Steve used to refer to her – only ever getting a glare from Buck.
“I’m sure he would be. Well, I’ll see you guys tomorrow morning. Bye kids,” Happy said as he opened the door after parking in front of the Tower. They raced again to the elevator and this time Daci let Peter win. Even though he was gloated about it on the way up.
“You wanna see the monkeys next, Harley?” Steve asked his toddler with a smile. Without looking at her father, she once again grabbed Clint’s hand and followed the Starks further into the magical place. As the three children started chanting ‘monkeys,’ Daci realized there was a crowd and she couldn’t see. Steve was able to maneuver the stroller to the side to see while Daci and Clint hung back.
“Looking good kiddo! I brought you some spare clothes and Wolf,” her blonde father said as he joined them, putting the items on the bathroom counter. “So, how’s your first bubble bath?”
“We’ll talk about it bambino. But Steve’s right, we should get going,” Tony said, unable to help the sneer he threw his ex’s way.
“Ah...she ever get you between your legs?” the blonde asked with a smirk as the brunette returned the smile.
“I mean…” the brunette interrupted quietly, “by definition it kinda is…” Steve opened his eyes, swallowing some of his anger at seeing his husband.
…there may have been an incident where she and Steve were out…and he didn’t want to fight her anymore so he let her just wear a diaper to the farmers market. And she took it off. And ran away from Steve. And it was surprisingly difficult to convince a police officer that the naked toddler screaming bloody murder about wanting to stay naked – was in fact the teenager’s niece – and also he wasn’t some pervert.
“– Tony I swear!” Steve had taken a pillow and smacked it at his husband’s head, who simply laughed at him before giving him a quick peck on the cheek and settled into the couch to watch the movie.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean we’re replacing you. We’re just adding to our super cool team, okay? And you’ll get to have so much fun as a big brother!”
Steve had come back from a run to the store, alarmed to see an unfamiliar car parked in front of his house. His in-law’s car was parked next to Tony’s, since the two had come for lunch but he didn’t recognize the ugly sports car out front.
when she comes over for breakfast tomorrow, then. Tell her why there’s a new couch? Why the teenagers are so…distressed? I’m just not sure she’d like to hear that, you know, considering
“You haven’t had dinner yet,” Pop said with a grin, leaning back and wrapping her arm around her Omega.
Wonder and warmth flowed through him, feeling so much love for his pup that he momentarily forgot about his mate. Steve looked around, freezing when he saw why Tony isn’t next to them.
“Can I walk you to class? What’s next for you?” he said as he grabbed her arm and began dragging her down the hall.
“The FUCK is your problem, archer?” Clint blinked back at him, as if he didn’t know why he was angry. The nerve of this guy.
“That’s okay,” Steve said in reassurance, patting her knee before leaning back against the couch. “We’ll go pick them up after we leave here.”
“I see that, beloved. But I am trying to take your pants off. Which of the two can we put off until later?” the genius whispered as he again closed the gap, hand reaching out to palm his husband’s pants tent. He smiled wickedly when Steve threw his head back in pleasure and his hips involuntarily pushed into the genius’ touch. He leaned up to kiss those plump lips after hearing them whisper his name, but was shocked when Steve not only kissed first, but lifted the shorter man up and around to sit him on the table. Tony’s legs opened up, further inviting the super soldier in, as the two made out and grinded against each other.
"He said he didn't think he'd ever have kids...cause of the serum. And how...we'll eventually outlive our loved ones..." he trailed off sadly, arms moving to hold their daughter closer in his embrace.
Emerson made her way to her room, changing into a one piece before making her way to the indoor pool. She didn’t use it often for exercise, but she could be alone the longest there. The other option is going for a run around the property and though it was beautiful - she still hated running. And walking wasn’t rigorous enough.
“Oh, my young padawan. The sass is strong in you,” the genius admitted, finishing with a hand over his heart. They heard another splash and all turned to see Wade pull Lillian out of the water, arguing with Peter about how her floaties had
“Cause you’re madly in love with me. And my cock-sucking game is on point,” Wade argued in his defense. Peter couldn’t help chuckling at that, rolling his eyes as his husband continued distracting him from the upcoming event.
When they got inside, Buck grabbed a coke and followed Steve, leaving Sam to his own devices. The music was loud, but that was expected at any party. Although, if Bucky had to guess...it seemed Stark went more all-out than he normally does.
“Sure why don’t you go with that? See where that gets you? Cause this hundred year old man can still outrun you, Thumper,” he said with a smirk as he resumed stretching before demonstrating yoga poses.
Her Dad had ended up telling Xavier what happened, and the other teen felt immediately guilty, asking if he could treat her to lunch before they stop by SI to drop off some forms.
After a moment, he noticed her eyes widen in shock, frantically feeling around before looking terrified at the blonde.
“I just…I don’t like that no one told me about her. Even if she is a bad person.” She saw him look away, presumably at Steve, neither speaking for a moment.
“Xavy, your sister was giving birth to your first nephew. And she needed you to drive her. I’m not mad at you ya goober.”
“Hey, don’t make eye contact, she might come over here.” She rolled her eyes at her friend and did her best not to look at the beautiful woman.
“Just your hair and eye color…” Tony said angrily, looking over at his son who was thankfully distracted by Steve. “And you signed away your rights, remember? He’s
“Yay Papa!” he shouted as he hugged Steve’s legs. The blonde leaned down to pick up his son, pulling him into his embrace as he stole a glance at his husband.
“Be good!” her father called out before they left, putting a smile on Daci’s face. It dropped when she noticed how stressed Tony looked now that the others were gone. Harley was still wrapped tightly around him and Morgan was starting to move from her spot next to Peter towards Tony - she decided she would do her best to help him.
“I wanted your help with something, if you’re not busy…” she said as he stopped cleaning the bowls to look at her.
The Avengers alarm sounded three days after her father passed his evaluation. Everyone was on their respective floors but quickly moved to Steve and Tony’s after the genius asked his AI to shut off the alarm. Daci and her Tati were already in their living room, having brought the Stark family breakfast after they’d cooked so often for them.
“People look at me one of two ways; either with pity or lust. I didn’t find that from either Mr. Stark or Mr. Rogers.”
“I thought they died in a car accident?” Buck asked gently, reaching a hand out to grab Clint’s and intertwining their fingers together.
“Just that you received some upsetting news,” T’Challa said as he put his empty cup back on the coffee table.
" she said to their fathers with her eyebrows raised. It finally clicked with both of them as Tony moved to grab Miles from Wade's shoulders. The boy settled on his Dad's hip as he looked quizzically at the adults.
“Bullshit,” his Dad muttered, though loud enough for the other two to hear as they sharply turned in shock to the man. “Petey, you can handle anything.”
“Sure, you’re also welcome to explore while I shower,” Tony said with a weird smile that Steve just nodded and shrugged back at.
With that new information, she quickly undressed but hesitated when her foot hovered above the water. Taking another breath, she put one foot down until it touched the bottom of the tub, feeling confident with the amazing way the water felt against her leg. With one more deep breath, she gently, but quickly, she climbed in and sat down in the tub before she could lose her confidence. She smiled when her father let out a laugh, seeing him watching her with a proud face and holding several rubber duckies.
She literally shudders at the thought, what would’ve happened if she’d lost both? She would’ve ended up in foster care. No one would want to adopt an epileptic twelve year old. And she’s heard enough stories from an old classmate of hers in foster care that was only in her school for about a month. The horrors some of those kids go through…
Tony smiled another moment before he felt his husband tug his arm in the direction of the hallway. He took a breath before following.
“I love you too, little one,” he returned while brushing some of her hair behind her ear. He leaned forward to kiss her forehead, pausing a moment to breathe in the smell of her shampoo. They two snuggled a little more comfortably under the blankets.
"Why are you under house arrest?" Both Tony and Steve coughed out a laugh, which turned into a real laugh when they saw the other one do so. They were able to collect themselves quickly, wondering if that was necessarily an appropriate question a five year old should ask.
“Hm, your Daddy and I haven’t agreed on a name yet. Any ideas?” Steve asked the pup in his arms, who looked like he was deep in thought.
“Pete, why don’t you and I take a walk while your Dad entertains the masses? Em think you can make sure he doesn’t over work himself?” Steve asked with a smile.
“I don’t want to lose him,” he admitted quietly. “Once he realizes how crazy I am…” A soft hand with a firm grip on his wrist made him look up into her green eyes.
“You think I’m worried about me?” she asked interrupting his train of thought, hopping down before taking her cup over to sit on a stool. “I’ve survived up until this point; I’m not worried about my housing. I’m worried about you.” He looked at her surprised and at a loss for words.
“See now this is cause for celebration!” Sam said, slapping Steve’s thighs and standing up before heading into the kitchen.
He came back with some cough syrup and other medications, Gatorade bottles, a thermometer, a trash bag and more tissues. He knew how difficult it was to make someone drink nasty cough syrup and also knew his family well enough to deal with the most difficult one first.
“Hey! Knock it off you two!” Mrs. Sanders shouted from around the corner, glaring at them until they broke apart.
In fact, Joey has, on more than one occasion, tried to convince Steve his ‘impeccable character development’ would help her understand her required school readings better. Though the blonde blushed each time, he didn’t give in to her clever schemes. He’d been reading to her since she was born, he was familiar with her cute attempts to have him read to her. Especially when it came to her trying to get out of school work.
“So what’s got you so upset?” Jo looked in awe of this woman, sounding like she genuinely wanted to know if she was okay. There was also something about this woman that made it nearly impossible for Joey to lie to her.
His first red flag when he entered the restaurant, Obie was sitting at a table set for four. As Tony walked closer to the table, confusion written across his face, he noticed a pink jacket sitting in the chair to his godfather’s right.
“Captain!” the Asgardian bellowed. “I was just telling your new daughter about our first encounter, where I had easily taken down the mighty Iron Man and Captain America.”
“Come on! It was six against one, that deserves a swift kick in the crotch!” she said, sticking out a foot in emphasis.
He was small, a squirmy thing even though his eyes were closed. He sported a tuft of brown hair and the tiniest fingers Steve had ever seen.
“Thor, there is still a child obviously in this room. Plus Daci is still here,” Natasha said with a smirk, pointing to Clint with a smile. Everyone but Clint laughed, who just pouted with a mouthful of pizza.
Now everyone was saying hi to him, trying to befriend him in some way. The same kind of people who shoved him into lockers and made fun of him at his other schools.
That’s what he kept telling himself as he found a parking spot, spending a few extra minutes in his car. He had told Steve the address and time in case he needed back up, but had ultimately reassured his boyfriend and claimed he could do this.
"Congrats crazy pants," Wade said as Peter offered his "congrats baby sis!" She heard the King behind them, turning to accept her future brother-in-law's hug as he smiled at her and offered his own congratulations.
“Well, actually Dr. Strange told me to go home and get a good night’s rest. He said Tony will be totally fine, but he would still be knocked out from the anesthesia and to just come back first thing tomorrow. So we have a few hours before either him or Peter will wake up,” he said, double checking his watch to see the time.
“Holy shit, Jo! That was incredible,” the genius said in excitement, picturing the event and wondering if someone recorded that as they slid into the back seat.
“So,” Wade began as he walked the two over to the others. “Guys, this is Leo. Leo, the one being eaten alive is Peter’s little brother Miles. That's his sister Emerson. And those are Pete’s dads, Tony and Steve. The twins call them Granddaddy and Poppy but you can call them whatever you feel comfortable with, okay?”
"I give up, pee on Poppy for all I care," she said as plopped down and leaned against Steve's shoulder. He smiled before kissing the top of her head in sympathy.
“Perhaps I shall take you, young Emerson, so you shall see for yourself,” the god of thunder offered. Steve rolled his eyes, knowing exactly where this was going.
“Holy shit, Tony, that was so fucking hot,” Steve said before kissing him again, getting Tony to chuckle against his perfect lips.
That quickly earned laughs from the four and Tony spoke up before his husband could prod any further.
"Like...a week?" she said as he closed his eyes anger. She started to look away again when she heard him take a breath and use one finger to gently guide her back to look at him.
“Let’s see what he’s doing first. J, what’s Barton up to?” Tony asked his AI, since the archer was most likely asleep. It was after noon after all.
“I’m so sorry you went through that, Jo. Those people…don’t listen to anything those shitheads said, okay?” he asked, smiling when she did.
“Father?” Tony asked Ty, hearing his son show Steve his other bags of toys while the blonde Alpha shrugged smugly.
She yelped from the snug clothing while he simply finagled her to sit up and on his lap, wrapping his arms around her in comfort.
"Greetings friends! I was showing my newest nephew how best to swing his axe to get the right momentum." Steve walked around to carefully take the weapon from his son, who looked a little sheepish - glad at least one of them had the audacity to look guilty.
Her feet were tied to the chair too, she noted after another moment, brain still fuzzy. It was only then that she noticed something warm and wet dripping down the side of her face. Blood. Would explain why her head hurt. Not like they were trying to be gentle or anything. The realization of everything was slowly starting to hit her, she could feel her adrenaline surge as her body began to panic. She tried to lower her breathing like Jarvis had taught her, tried to remain calm and prepare herself for what was going to happen.
Bucky simply tightened his hold and shushed him gently, rocking the two back and forth until Lucky interrupted their moment and barked at them. The blonde didn’t feel as bad about the tears in his eyes when he pulled away, able to see the brunette wipe a few of his own.
“...okay so turn invisible,” he said with a deeper glare, staring at his still very visible still very stupid little brother. Miles glared at him before closing his eyes. Peter stared at him another moment before sighing heavily. “Miles…”
"I'm sorry you had to hear that, Miles," Peter said somberly as he rubbed the boys back, walking alongside his love who luckily had been the one to remain calm. They ignored the insulting yells from the couple, walking back to the car to head back to the Tower. He walked around Wade to look at Mile's face, laughing when he realized the boy had been asleep for quite some time.
A member came up and asked for some towels, so Steve went back to the front desk, counting on his Pappy to cheer the pup up. As he helped other members sign in and hydrate, he stole a glance at his kid.
“We should get going, actually,” Cara said, obviously uncomfortable with the cold shoulder Xavier was blatantly throwing her way.
“This your new pimp, whore?” Peter barely blinked, not seeing Wade’s fist connect with his face – just the guy dropping like a sack of potatoes. Peter saw one of the restaurant workers come outside.
Well, that and his life was about to get even more busy than the grand opening of the new Stark Expo four years ago. He had slept a total of three hours that week.
There...that made Tony feel better. He took two deep breaths before heading back into the living room to try and help his son get through this.
“Don’t!” his uncle shouted, stopping Peter when his mouth opened to try to reason with him with a finger point. “I’m calling your dads and then giving you two a ride back to the tower – where they can adequately punish you. Cause if you were
“Uncle Steve! You gotta move!” he ignored the tiny person currently trying to shove him off the couch. “Jose is coming over and you gotta get up!”
“Fuck,” he heard again before finally seeing the cause of the profanity. A very beautiful young woman stood in the kitchen, keeled over and holding onto her bloody foot. She was wearing Steve’s pajamas, brown hair thrown up in a bun and sporting thick rimmed glasses. Steve somehow had a broom appear in his hands, cleaning up the mess around the girl until he could safely get to her.
"What! That's not fair! She's been training with you and is freakishly strong for such a tiny thing!"
“I snapped at Daci for getting her fired, told her she didn't make me happy...and Clint...I accused him and called him a...holy fuck,” Bucky choked out as he held his head in his hands and a swarm of emotions churned inside of him. He felt nauseous and more scrambled than the last time he’d gotten out of HYDRA’s hold. A hand he instantly recognized as Steve’s gripped his shoulder.
When Clint was safely in a bed, Bruce made his way back while Nat stayed behind, sitting by Clint’s bedside. Bucky and Daci sat outside his room, able to see his sleeping form through the glass wall. It was about another hour until Clint’s eyes opened, and in that time father and daughter sat quietly.
Emerson tried to stage-whisper back but kept breaking with giggles, shaking her head, “WHY would I want to know that?”
He grabbed his spare key to unlock the door after knocking and waiting a few moments. When they heard screaming from behind the door, they decided to rush in.
“Obadiah Stane, his niece Sunset Bane, and love of my life Steve Rogers,” Tony said quickly, pointing to each person in turn, before facing forward to address the ringleader of this little circus. “Now, Obie. Why did you want this meeting?”
He didn’t get a verbal one, but felt his boyfriend’s hands immediately begin running through his long hair in answer.
The day of Bucky’s graduation, Clint was basically avoiding him. Neither of them had acknowledged the next step in all of this, though they both knew what had to happen.
Joey tightened her arms around him, so fucking thankful he understood. When she really fucking needed him to, he was with her and on her side. Saw the truth and just how terrified she was.
Wave after wave of sadness washed over her as she laid there crying, unaware that the punishment had even stopped. Steve had been rubbing her back and whispering words of encouragement, but she didn’t notice anything until he reached down to pull her underwear back up – her pajama bottoms long since kicked off.
“Richard was a great man,” Tony said remembering. “When we heard Peter was going into foster care after his aunt and uncle died, I immediately signed the paperwork to be a foster parent and well…we couldn’t shake him and ended up keeping the punk.”
Steve was concerned that she didn't want a party because she didn't have many friends at school. But the brunette reminded them that Peter didn't either and turned out fine - even if he was in love with sergeant smart-ass. Who apparently was also being a dumb-ass and ignoring Peter the last few weeks? Months? He couldn't remember from their conversation - Peter had called just as Steve came out of the shower and he couldn't exactly remember.
The room was gorgeous, just like everything else in this country. She ran to the curtains, opening them up as she gawked at the view; partially she could see the city, but mostly the beautiful landscape surrounding it. She smiled to herself as she figured out how to not completely block the view while also making it dark enough to catch some z's in. The bed was of course like sleeping in a damn cloud, smiling as she slowly drifted off -
"What are you doing? Isn't Pop making lunch?" she asked as both he and Miles started setting up to watch something.
“I got it Steeb!” Peter exclaimed as he ran back in with a small, wet, blue towel. He handed it to Stevw as the boy gingerly sat next to them, looking sadly at the unconscious teen. Peter watched as Steve gently wiped her face and neck. The blonde looked over to the boy, handing the towel back to him with a small smile.
“The world needs Spiderman, have you not seen the graffiti in the streets? And...and you were...always my favorite,” looking every bit of the child that he was. It made Peter feel even worse. He let another moment pass between them before sighing heavily.
Wade stopped with his hand on the door knob, looking at him seriously. “As a heart attack. Make sure my boutonniere matches my eyes.” He looked at Peter another moment, gave him that smile that was literally weakening his knees, adding a “remember, 7:00. I’ll be waiting for you, Romeo,” winking before he finally exited.
“Alright Jo, I think you’ve embarrassed the poor guy enough,” Steve offered as he pulled out the home-made pizzas he created out of the oven.
“I know, bear, it’s gross but it’ll make you feel better,” Steve said sympathetically, taking the cup back when he finished.
"Oh yeah! He's my favorite!" Miles responded. The teen's brows furrowed over exaggeratedly as he looked shocked at the news.
“Hey guys, how’s it going?” the man they were talking about asked as he poked his head in the bathroom.
“Tones,” Steve spoke quietly to get his attention. It worked, the genius turning to his husband for clarification.
“Should we head back inside?” Steve asked after licking his lips, making it hard for Tony to function enough to reply.
he wondered as he made his way to the office his dad works in. What he saw instead made him stop in his tracks.
“Do you wanna try and catch me? I’m pretty fast,” she offered, feeling more confident around him. She had been lazing with the others watching movies all day - she could probably use this too.
“That doesn’t answer my question. And you keep talking like that and I’ll break my silent promise not to blow you in public,” Tony purred out as they both got in his car, the genius guessing right that Steve had taken a taxi or gotten a ride to the restaurant.
actually a good thing. And so was living part time with Wade. And doing Spiderman full time. Totally not ‘yell worthy,' right?
“Have you lost your goddamn mind?! I’m not training you and I sure as hell won’t keep this secret from our parents!”
“Mine was good. I made a hundred on our spelling test. Plus I really like my painting from art time! It’s drying so I can’t bring it home yet. I think Uncle Steve would be proud.”
He thought of all of this as he continued watching the group, doing his very best to stamp down his inner Alpha that wanted to go over there and ring that woman’s neck. Before he could push through the bond to get Tony’s attention, Stone noticed him.
“Woah, baby, getting handsy in front of your brother? I thought you said I had to stop doing that?” his husband teased as Peter firmly shut the door.
“Would you like to hang out in a mansion, order in for food and meet a 3 year old?” he asked and looked over at Steve, whose face seemed to light up at the realization.
“Tony Stark are you having fun? At a school function?” Pepper asked with her hands on her hips as he approached his friend group.
"Come on, handsome," his love said as he pinched the shorter man's ass as he passed him, pausing at the open door for Tony to follow him. The brunette grabbed his husband's hand to hold as they ran into T'Challa and Shuri in the hallway.
“Can we, just? Cool it with the crude words?” the blonde said with a sigh. Tony threw a glare his way before turning his attention back to their kid.
“Do you still love him?” the father asked cutting to the chase. Peter looked at him wide eyed; either at the question or his answer…or both.
The thought brought Steve’s soldier to attention, picturing what that gorgeous ass would look like in sexy ladies underwear. Cheeks flushed, he looked back at his husband whose expression had turned dark with lust.
"It's one thing for your people to get married in the eyes of our Lord, it's another thing entirely to have them raise a child," the wife added.
And because of that, he loved her with all of his heart. Nothing else mattered. The anger returned as he stood in front of Barton’s door, bringing his fist down hard against the wood and almost breaking it. It was another few seconds before Barton opened the door, and in those few seconds Bucky just got angrier.
“Yeah but apparently I’m still dropping the ball! I forgot…” he watched the brunette pause, like he wasn’t sure how to say what he needed to say next. Bucky closed his eyes before continuing. “I
“Tony! Good to see you. You remember my niece, Sunset?” Obie asked as Tony’s ex-girlfriend sauntered over to her seat - beautiful as ever. Long, strawberry-blonde hair swayed in the wind as she sat down, a predatory smile on her face.
“Wait…no…” she began to say, because it almost seemed like he had planned to see her just as she was walking to a certain teacher’s classroom…
Speaking of the devil, the blonde was opening the door to the bedroom as Tony reached for the handle. Steve was dressed in a t-shirt just a little too small for his broad chest and sweatpants. And if it wasn’t for the murderous look on his face, he would’ve been turned on by the sight.
“Well it’s a good thing you never did, or the world wouldn’t be blessed with this,” Clint said as he made his dramatic entrance from the bathroom, stopping to pose in front of them.
“Hey, Pepper thas-not cool. His robots aren’t stupid,” the equally drunk but very calm patient said.
Steve found himself too exhausted to try and reprimand him, simply humming in response as he fell into a peaceful slumber wrapped around the love of his life.
She couldn’t help but laugh at that, nodding tiredly as she wiped her eyes with the back of her hands.
“So...you wanna go out? Like on a real date?” Steve suddenly asked, interrupting his train of thought as Tony’s eyes shot back up. The blonde looked sincere, face flushed in slight embarrassment but with that damn earnest smile of his.
“You know, I didn’t learn how to swim until I was seventeen. Tony was actually the one that taught me,” she said as she pointed to the ridiculous man, currently clinging like a koala bear on his husband’s back.
Steve walked to his side of the bed before climbing in with his love. He had to maneuver some of the blankets and pillows in order to see him, but was finally able to see his face and began lightly petting the beautiful man in front of him.
“I had lunch with a woman I have every right to see, and you decided to wait to tell me I could lose another dad.” The words tasted like acid coming out of her mouth, her fear of everything that’s happened finally getting to her. But she still couldn’t stop herself.
“So I kept those flowers, and looked at them over the years whenever I felt sad. Cause it would remind me that true love and kindness existed out there in the world.”
“Bruce, tell me they’re alive and well so I can kick their asses,” his husband blurted, startling the three.
“Yes you absolutely did say that!” her Pop retaliated, standing by the giant pot of marinara sauce he had on the stove.
“Aw, I do feel sorry for you,” Steve said as he easily carried the man. “But I don’t pity you, which is why you’ll be making this up to me later.” They had to duck under a low tree branch, the shorter man groaning in annoyance when more nature touched him.
“What?” Steve asked quietly, clearing hearing this for the first time. “Wait, what? What are you talking about Joey?” Tony shifted closer on the couch to her, and also to his slightly frantic husband who looked thoroughly confused.
“You...hate being with Peter and Wade?” He looked up at that in shock, quickly shaking his head no before explaining.
Steve finally looked up, knowing Peter had had enough as he moved to shoot his web to the ceiling. He shot upwards before settling upside down a few feet above an amazed Miles. Peter looked smugly at the five year old, who was too excited to notice as he quickly stood up on the couch and extended his arms towards the superhero. He smiled as his husband used his phone to take pictures and Emerson moved to spot them. Peter carefully pulled the boy up with him and swung hum around a little with his webs.
“What does that mean, J? They’re safe right? What’s Petey doing here anyhow?” Tony asked as panic began to set in. Before the AI could respond, the elevator doors open on their floor and they were greeted by a sight that nearly made the billionaire fall dead then and there.
“Calm down, Bambi. I was showing Leo here my white sixty four impala,” his Dad said nonchalantly as he walked towards the man and reached for the towels.
"You're right...only good things to look forward to," Steve said with confidence as they got into Tony's car once more. The brunette reached over and grabbed Steve's face in his hands, pulling him in to kiss his lips before pulling back abruptly.
They could barely keep their hands off each other on the way back, starting to undress in Tony’s living room and finishing in his bedroom. There were three rounds total, each one as mind blowing as the last. Tony lay there panting after the third, sighing when the knot deflated enough for Steve to pull out.
“I wasn’t with her…” he said quietly, lost in thought. He didn’t notice the way her face revealed she had realized what that meant.
Tony’s eyes widened as he watched Steve nervously walk over to the teen and hand over the treasure trove.
Speaking of, he had to leap forward to catch her when her legs gave out and she suddenly collapsed to the ground.
“You’re Steve? Like Tony’s boyfriend Steve?!” she asked as she shoved Rhodey to the side. “Come in! Mama look who’s here!” the girl called out as Steve allowed her to drag him inside, ignoring Rhodey’s glare.
The fear and utter disgust that also came off his scent in waves had the Omega recoil back as if he’d been slapped. The words that came from the lips he had once loved kissing, insinuating that this was somehow Tony’s fault had crushed his soul.
“She could change her mind, Steve,” looking into the big blue eyes that shined up at him. He shrugged before continuing. “It’s her life, my love. We can protect her, but if she wants to speak to her, she has that right.”
And he was kind and forgiving and didn’t run away when he saw Tony had a six year old with him. Or when he apparently understood French and heard Rhodey making fun of Tony for talking about the Alpha’s cock size.
“Oh Daci,” Vivienne said, squatting down in front of her and placing a gentle hand on the girl’s shoulder. “You should always trust your first instinct.” Before Daci could react to that, she felt a pinch in her neck, looking up as Vivienne pulled an empty syringe away from her.
“Whole mansion to yourself, sounds fun,” Steve said absently, looking at more technology in one room then he’s seen in his entire life.
“So it...de-ages people by twenty something years?” Miles asked, doing the math in his head. “Would I like...cease to exist?” he turned to ask his Uncle Bruce.
This unfortunately did not help her panic attack and she cried loudly – scared and not in control of her own body.
They stayed like that a moment longer until Lucky started whining in his sleep. The two teens pulled away from each other, smiling and looking over at their pup still passed out.
“We forgive you for things in your past, kiddo. And I’m sure your sister would’ve forgiven you as well. We all forgive you, Thumper, even when it involves keeping a secret about Mr. Grounded-for-three-months  McTraitor-pants,” the brunette said.
“I have a lot of work to do. Thanks for the donuts,” Tony clipped back as he purposefully moved the plate on the other side of the table and returned to his work. Steve looked with confusion back at his husband, opening his mouth to ask what was wrong when the AI interrupted.
He gently closed the book, holding it close to his chest as he watched Tony shift over to sit directly in front of the taller teen.
"It'll be great. You won him over a long time ago with a frantic phone call, big guy. Nothing for you to worry about."
His focus shifted back to Jo when she moved to rest her head back on top of the couch and stared up at the ceiling. Tony took a gulp before responding to her remark.
“Yes you do, doll. Will you please say it out loud though? For me?” James asked so sweetly, Clint decided to oblige him...but still snuggled up so his voice was muffled.
“Text me, maybe we can hang out later,” Cara said with a wink as she turned and walked away with the kid.
“You know, it’s funny. When I found out you were dating Steve, I felt like you were intruding on us. Until I realized I was the intruder,” she finished sadly and quietly, staring at her lap.
"I love this! Whatever you did I'm sure it's not as bad as all this," his Dad said as he started eating the chocolate covered blueberries.
And on one particularly weekday, not long after Bucky had moved in, Steve brought him up to his room and said he wanted to show him something.
"Kinda scary how much she's like me, isn't it?" his love asked, reading his mind as he leaned up to kiss Steve. The blonde easily returned the affection, handing the mini Iron Man over to Tony so Steve could keep cooking. The brunette laughed at his youngest while he rested him on his hip, enjoying his pajamas a
“How will I know? Or how will Clint know? What should I do?” he asked before he flopped back on his bed, crossing his arms over his eyes. He heard Cheryl chuckle at him but choose to ignore it.
“Huh, and how exactly do you know Tony?” Helen asked, putting a protective arm around Tony’s shoulder.
“I wanted to…” Wade fumbled again. He handed Peter the flowers in lieu of continuing. Peter took them happily, glad Wade had remembered his favorite flowers.
“Yeah that works out, I need to talk to your husband anyway. No, he’s not in trouble – this time at least,” she paused to laugh with Steve, “no it’s about Peter actually, he’s doing a family tree for school and I forgot Tony’s grandparents names. Oh? Wait hang on let me get a pen and paper…should’ve known better then to ask that quote unquote genius anyway…” she trailed off as she searched her drawers for something to write with and on.
The adrenaline had worn off as panic and pain set in. And then he heard a groan coming from his left.
“Maybe…” Steve said with another shrug, smiling like a dope at the shorter man’s chuckle. The beautiful Omega in front of him gave him the courage to do something he never imagined he’d do. “So...wanna come back to my place?”
“Yeah, me,” Steve said with a warm smile, reaching over to brush some of the blonde hair out of the pup’s eyes.
He didn’t look back as he left Clint’s apartment and walked home. Anger, shame and confusion burned in his chest as he replayed their conversation in his head.
He took a break from studying to provide applause for the toddler’s performance, encouraging him to take a bow in hopes that there wouldn’t be an encore.
“I’m done listening Joey,” he said in exhaustion as he rolled his eyes and started walking to her changing table to grab a diaper. “And you are putting on this diaper, young lady.” She frowned but didn’t move to try and out run him
“…about which part?” he heard Tony ask skeptically. Steve finally made eye contact again, taking another deep breath before continuing.
"Really? You wouldn't want to wait until you're older and more...I don't know...stable?" Buck simply laughed before bringing the baby to his face to kiss.
– which he should be focusing on! Considering the two men had turned to him and were currently trying to get his attention.
He reminded himself he still needed to shower and hoped skipping the run was a good idea before dealing with an undoubtedly stressful situation his kids had gotten into.
“Looks okay, I can change the bandages in a bit if you’d like,” he offered gently giving her hand back. She simply made herself more comfortable, not wanting to move from the spot. He started petting her head again as she noticed Tony wasn’t with them. Then she realized this should’ve been a school day, also realizing Steve must’ve called in to stay with her.
"But...you're not a man?" Miles asked innocently, getting more laughter from not only the parents, but the sister as well.
“Can I help?” the brunette asked, the question adorable enough to bring Steve up and returning his husband’s embrace.
"Mhmm," he heard Jo say, causing the man to steal a look at his girl...who was falling asleep against him.
“Right, but someone else could have, if you found it. Right?” Bucky asked with a knowing smile, that had Clint wondering if Bucky knew he pickpocketed him.
The bed jostled by the force of Tony shoving his way back in a panic, eyes wide and leaking tears as he exclaimed “God…no! Jesus fucking Christ Emerson I would never!” He stumbled a little at the last two words as she once again, gently took his arms in her hands.
“Why don’t I get the warm welcome?” T’Challa asked in a teasing tone, knowing damn well why and chuckling when she simply glared at him. “I am here for a UN meeting and decided to drop by and see how my little sister is doing.”
He would rather Bucky and Clint tease him rather than pity him, so he chalked it up to a one night stand and snuck out for a run. Sure enough, the two teased him relentlessly when he got back, which he took all in stride. It was just a one night stand, he’d held up his end of the bargain so neither could whine at him about going out again.
“Well congrats on getting the training wheels off, I’ve been following him for months. Now, if you’ll excuse me, little boy,” Daredevil said before climbing up a building, leaving the teen glaring from the streets below.
“Seriously? No one wants to see two grandpas kissing each other.” Steve’s head shot up at that, smiling mischievously at his youngest. Her eyes widened, realizing her mistake, before she shrieked and ran down the beach away from the super soldier. She made it about ten feet before he easily caught up to her, scooping her up and swinging her legs into the air before digging his fingers into her side, laughing along with his daughter. He kept it up until he heard her squeeze out “PAPA PLEASE!” between laughs. He slung her over his shoulder as he walked back to the little family, enjoying the way she laughed all the way back. Enjoyed the smiles upon his son and husband’s faces; really, truly grateful for his small family.
But as he turned around to face him, the gun dropped to the floor and sounds of grunts filled the air. Now towering over the fallen man was a dark red figure with...horns on his head?
“Nightmare,” Bucky said quietly with a sad voice, gently maneuvering the boy’s face to turn towards the men. “Pete, wake up. Look who’s here.” Steve watched as their son blinked himself awake, his eyes bulging comically when he realized who he saw.
“She didn’t tell you?” she asked sincerely. “Doesn’t sound like the greatest father-daughter relationship…” He stared back at her for a moment, wondering why the fuck he hadn’t asked Sam to send her packing.
“-What if we see if the Starks wanna join us? I bet it’d be fun watching Steve and Tony wrangle those three in public.” And that was at least more enjoyable of an idea, so she nodded yes.
Steve wisely kept his mouth shut but couldn’t help a smile crack from his lips, which only further infuriated his husband.
Though she loathed clothing, it was still cold in their Brooklyn apartment. Luckily she was unconscious, so it was fairly easy to put her pajamas on. Afterwards, he laid her on the futon while he worked on the pillow-wall. She slept through it, and through being moved again when he finished. He stood for a moment looking at her, wondering how he should spend the next few hours before he would fall asleep…
“Daci, ready to go see some wolves?” Steve asked, walking over with his kids and giving her father a weird and angry look before smiling at her.
"Who are those for?" the shorter father asked as he rocked on his heels. His Pop rolled his eyes as he handed his husband the bouquet while the giant collectively whined.
Tony sat in between the two, chatting it up with Clint about how Bucky’s ass looked in his baseball pants while Steve focused on cheering his best friend on.
“Uh huh. You didn’t follow me out here to get me alone?” the brunette purred, which had the Alpha melting a little next to him.
He brought his hand to stroke the boy’s cheek, glad to see his little shoulder’s lax a little at his father’s words. Peter looked up at him and gave him a small smile.
A week after his surgery and her Dad was back at work. Not even in his lab, but back at his office at SI. She was thankful she and Peter had worked things out – and that her Pop was being more trusting with her after their long talk.
“Yo, Picasney? A little help here?” his brother asked exasperatedly. The blonde rolled his eyes from the nickname, responding by bringing his feet up on the couch and away from the child currently rolling on the floor in protest.
“I said, THAT’S ENOUGH!” Fury roared, able to finally separate the two with Sam being held back by Steve.
And it was. Her jaw started to ache with how much she tried to shove in her mouth at once. They laughed and passed snacks around until they heard a familiar truck pull up.
Since she was basically a limp noodle at this point, it was easy for the man to handcuff her and escort her out to his car. She saw teachers and other students shaking their heads at her as officers also arrested a few other seniors for presumably drinking as well.
“They’re both safe and alive – Peter more so than your Dad. He’s already healed but is bedridden to not raise too many suspicions. And because I’m mad at him,” he said with a smile as he pulled back to look at his girl. “Your Dad though – he is hurt; he saved a lot of people doing what he did. But um…well, the doctors are hopeful but…it was really bad. He was unconscious without oxygen for a while and he…” he trailed off to square his jaw.
"Fine, twenty minutes and you don't tell you Pop. Deal?" Miles answered by excitedly jumping out of the bed and sprinting to the door.
“They’ll get her back, Peter,” he heard his family friend say. He nodded, mostly to be polite, as he looked back the direction the van had left. That was the only lead they had. The white van had been too far away for him to read the plates when he had made it to the street. Frantically looking around for any witnesses, anything that could help him find her. The street was empty except for a couple that was two blocks away. He saw one start making his way towards him, the other already on the phone – no doubt calling the police. He felt Wade stand behind him while his eyes made contact with a familiar smart phone on the pavement, bending down to pick it up.
“I’m sorry,” Tony choked out, feeling humiliation and shame wash over him. His father’s company had just started to take off, and he knew what would happen if something like this leaked to the press. Which is why the next words leaped out of his mouth. “Dad if you can help me find a doctor we can have it... ‘taken care of.’”
“Fine,” he muttered after a moment, standing up with a frown as the Stark kids cheered. “Daci you’re in charge of Clint and Morgan while I’m gone,” he added as Daci couldn’t help but smile at the statement.
“You’re welcome,” she whispered, still in a daze. Until her Pop pinched her arm, slightly annoyed at his two loves.
"Yes," Shuri responded with a small smile and shrug. "I couldn't say anything at your party because of our age difference," continuing when Emerson raised a brow in question. "When we met, you were fifteen and I was eighteen. It is not appropriate in either of our cultures for an "adult" to date a "child"," air quoting the words to emphasize the technicalities.
"So Barnes, JARVIS told me you had a lady friend on your floor earlier," Tony said, causing Daci to stiffen. She noticed Clint's brows furrows while the blonde took another shot.
“There’s not going to be a fight, cause we already kicked their ass at beer pong fair and square,” Clint explained to the god as he saw Rumlow lunge for him out of the corner of his eye. But before he - or James for that matter - could react Thor had a hold of Brock and brought him to the ground in one swift move.
Steve looked at Tony, a silent plea to check on her as the policewoman explained the situation. The brunette nodded with a small smile, walking past him to check on the teen inside. There was broken glass in the entrance-way, signs of a scuffle as he made his way to the voices in the living room.
“I went ahead and called Ms. Carter for you! You guys will be hearing from her soon, since you're in violations of her terms and all!” she called out, hand covering the mic part of the phone before bringing it back to her ear.
“Don’t believe anything that traitorous Charlie says,” he quipped back at his husband. Dr. Charlotte Chase had been a friend of the billionaire’s for over ten years, doing a good brunt of the non-profit part of one of his non-profits. “She can’t be trusted,” he joked. “Clearly there is some kind of conspiracy,” smiling at his family’s chuckle.
“Oh Bambi, my grandbabies are with their grandpas on Halloween. He can promise no such thing,” his husband sassed.
“I think he was in for vandalizing…” she cut off quickly when she noticed Peter staring intently at her. “I mean, he was being awarded for uh…epic heroism for…saving a bunch of nuns stuck in a tree.”
(it wasn’t stupid, Tony founded the damn thing and they had scheduled this months ago…but once again the universe hated him as the timing couldn’t be worse)
Clint, of all people, was the one to tell on Peter immediately after discovering the truth. Granted, he was also the only Avenger close by, but Steve was grateful the man child had called the pair. The parents were also
“I drank last night,” he admitted shamefully, rubbing his eyes with the heal of his palms, “Emerson saw me.”
“Oh crap, it’s the office. Hang on you two I’ll be right back,” Tony said, kissing Steve’s cheek before leaving the kitchen to take his call.
“Stevie! Seriously, come on man. I can’t go out and have fun knowing you’re sitting here with Lucky watching FRIENDS reruns,” the Alpha whined,
“Yes I do!” James shouted back, catching Clint off guard as he took a step back. The brunette was still sitting on the ground, but brought his hands up to his face in exhaustion. They were both silent, with only the sounds of far off children playing in the background. Clint wiped his face as he heard James begin to clear his throat. “You have a point, though.”
“Are you kidding me?” Bucky asked with his hands up in the air, just as their mom came back in and ducked under his frantic waving.
“This is it,” Steve said when they pulled up to the familiar grey house, the first words he’d spoken in a while.
When they landed, he kept in his anger long enough to follow Steve’s lead. It was a familiar facility to the one he found Daci in, except that one he personally had blown up following their escape. Stark and Thor flew ahead to survey the area while Banner hung back until Hulk was needed, leaving the other four to infiltrate.
"Unca Petey!" Jamie exclaimed as he tackled the teen while Joey joined them on the couch to finagle the coat off the toddler.
He couldn’t remember the last time he drank... okay... that was a lie. It had been about one year and three weeks since he had last tasted that sweet nectar of the gods. But Tony had promised Steve long before they said “I do” that he would cut down on the drinking. He can hear his husband’s voice.
“Tony,” Steve said in a more confident voice, pulling back and looking deep into Tony’s eyes, hands still gently cupping his face. “You are the one thing in my almost one hundred years of making decisions that I have never second guessed. You...baby you gave me a home. You were one of the first faces I saw in this century...and you helped me acclimate after being in the ice. I…” the blonde chuckled, which Tony thought offhandedly was one of his favorite sounds. “I have not done a good job of reminding you. And I’m sorry for that.”
She continued singing quietly, not protesting even when he washed her face. After he rinsed her off, he sat back a little to just let her play some more. She put more of the bubbles on her face before turning to the blonde.
she said hesitantly. Steve felt his chest burn with anger and betrayal as he realized it wasn’t just bad luck. It was
"Pop you'd be okay with that?" he asked, knowing his Dad would let him further improve his suit. The blonde thought carefully for a moment, looking a little ridiculous using his other father as a literal headrest.
“Frozen yogurt sounds good…” she began before being interrupted by some stupid freshman whose name she would never bother to learn.
They sat huddled on the couch for…well Tony lost track of time. They held her as she cried and cried and cried. His husband was the first to speak.
She hadn’t realized she had started shaking, no longer a fan of pot when this anxiety alone was punishment enough. Hot tears began spilling down her cheeks as she drummed her fingers against her thigh in anticipation.
“She told me when we first got together, I was an intruder. But later she realized “she was the intruder,” thinking she’d done more harm than good to you.”
“Emerson, honey,” he reached his hand to rest on her shoulder in comfort, “I’m the one who should be apologizing. Yes, you said something mean out of anger but I should have been more sensitive –”
“I didn’t say he was. But it’s nice to imagine he’s kind of like one. My mom’s allergic so I’ve never had a dog. I want to adopt one when I move out, that’s at the top of my list,” Steve said as he was pictured what it would be like.
"We're meeting a dean in a goddamn warehouse?...are you finally going to kill me to get my part of the inheritance?" he asked, stopping when she did in front of the door.
Now…he wonders if he’d be proud of the two of them. Of the amazing young woman his daughter is becoming.
Clint...was the reason he had broken out of HYDRA the last time. The reason he was able to escape and eventually find his kid.
His thoughts are interrupted by the sounds of his parents joining him in the kitchen. The blonde walked over to the stove before turning back to the arachnid.
“Look at you, my lad! You have grown since we last met! Soon you will even tower over the Captain here. How are you, young one? Your fathers have failed to keep me updated on your latest adventures.”
, he thought as he chugged the water he had also purchased and made his way to the fast food chain next door to use their bathroom.
“Oh! Wait, is it dangerous?” Clint asked in equal excitement and curiosity, sitting up a little more in his seat while keeping his injured foot on the table.
isn't good enough for you, Harley. You’re the best most amazing pup I know. Tiberius...that man is a fool if he doesn’t want you in his life. And honestly...he is an idiot and a horrible judge of character.”
“Y-yeah, I would be happy to make you son,” Tony said with a hoarse voice, which Daci quickly realized was because the man was as tearful as she was. She smiled back brighter at him, remembering what her Tati had said about taking advantage of happy moments.
“Monkeys Papa! Monkeys!” Harley cried out from the stroller, pointing further into the zoo with his tiny hand.
“You know I do, cub,” Tati said with a frown, pulling his hair up into a bun as she watched him get ready in his bedroom. “I’ll only be a few hours and then when I come back we’ll head to the gym, okay?”
Pupils so dilated they were no longer green and unable to focus on any one spot. Hands clenched and in a fighting position. The ground was slightly concave in front of her where she must’ve stomped her foot to send Hulk flying.
Bucky had called to tell him he’d meet them at the store to help them with the groceries, since he had a truck.
The three were in the Tony’s room when she and Steve got there, Peter sprawled on top of the unconscious genius while the two adults stood off to the side talking quietly. She quickly set down the breakfast items on the nearest counter before walking over to the brunettes.
She watched her father open his mouth to respond before being interrupted by Peter calling from the kitchen.
“You’re not so bad yourself, hot stuff,” the genius replied, lazily watching his husband. The blonde had thrown the towel haphazardly and was currently raking the brunette’s body with his eyes. “Um, not sure I have any energy to go for round three…”
. They suddenly heard screams from the living room, but figured Rhodey would call out of them if he couldn’t handle it.
Frustrated and sad, Steve decided to ask Tony’s best friend - who was subsequently also Steve’s least favorite fan. He texted Bucky for the address and showed up at Rhodey’s door that afternoon.
“Hey Miles, how was your outing?” Peter asked, but with something sinister happening in his smile. Wade turned around with a matching cheesy smile on his face, crossing his arms over his chest and waiting for Miles to answer.
As gently as possible, he brought the toddler up into his arms while laying his brother down on the couch. The man was exhausted and kept sleeping as Joey quietly sat in Steve’s arms, the teen moving some books out of the way so his brother could lie more comfortably.
“Wait! No fair! Pops said I can’t go to Asgard until I’m eighteen, why does she get to go?” Peter asked, looking at his father.
Steve made hot chocolate as the teen showered in one of the guest bedrooms, Tony not helping but providing company.
“Hey Barney, so you’ll be taking Clint’s bed, yeah?” Barney stopped walking, looking skeptically back and forth between the two teens.
“Emerson, if you ever want to talk about Samantha or…take flowers to her grave or anything…” he trailed off when he saw her drop her towel. He reached down to hand it back to her, noting the tears in her eyes at the mention of her little sister.
Bucky didn’t hear a comeback, but his attention turned to the way his boyfriend’s ass looked in those dress pants. The two walked down the driveway, waiting for the limo to show up that Tony had gotten for their group. Sure enough, not two seconds later the black stretch limo turned down their street with Tony waving from the sunroof.
The Hulk, however, she hasn’t seen in weeks! Daci rushes off to the elevator, sprinting into the gym with her aunt and friend waiting for her.
“Come on, you can’t tell me you came all the way down here just to be polite? You’re clearly not after my money, unless this is some elaborate scheme…which I admit is working.”
“Steve, babe, her wheelchair will go into their bedroom just fine,” Tony said, walking around Sarah to stop him.
“I’m proud of you cub. And doing a code green in twelve minutes? I think that’s your new record. Although, I gotta say...you are a little stinky. Also, there’s blue paint on your neck. Did you paint at school today?” he asked as her uncles suddenly joined them, their kids attached to them like koalas.
“Great,” Steve said under his breath as they heard the ding of the elevator followed by the two agents arguing over one another.
“Like she’s better company than all of you,” Bucky said bitterly, though he did suddenly notice his overwhelming urge to be with Vivienne suddenly...weakened.
"Hey, so...I kind of need your help with something," she said as she grabbed a handful of his popcorn to eat.
destroy their careers as well as their souls," Peter spoke up, still hugging their little brother. Pop groaned before moving his hand to cover his son's mouth as well in exasperation.
“Please tell me you haven’t been hitting on the nice paramedics,” Pepper said as she stared at the ceiling.
“Yeah, yeah I did. But...in the end it brought me here. And I wouldn’t trade that for anything.” She smiled warmly at the boy who was staring at his feet, giving him the time to respond.
Tony wasn't lying, he had spotted the hair several months ago. It was actually the second grey hair he had found on his love, but he never suspected Steve had worried about something like that so he'd never brought it up.
“So, one, I was upset about that for all of point two seconds. She was throwing a lie in my face about you to get me to like her. And two, I didn’t even have to know it was a lie to not care about it, because…” she let out another laugh before looking at him with tears in her eyes.
"I want Iron Man pj's," Miles said with a small smile, earning another cheek kiss from the father. Tony gently put his son down to look through the drawers, smiling as Miles got undressed without being asked and used Tony's help to put on a fresh pair. The genius then stood up and went to strip his bed, throwing the soiled blankets in the hamper. Then he moved to the bathroom to grab a few towels before haphazardly throwing them on the boy's bed. He knew he didn't have the heart or the energy to put the boy back in his own bed, opting to pick the boy back up and lead them to his own bedroom.
“How did you already eat your ice cream?” Tony asked in disbelief as he put his hands on his hips at the sight of the dirty pup.
“Oh man, are you still grounded? I’d love to take you out for a girl’s day.” Joey squinted her eyes at that, still smiling.
“I have to say, I’m kind of surprised you came. Thought maybe you’d chicken out,” Tony said as he leaned back against his chair.
“Toys of course! But leave the stuffed octopus, that’s for Morgan. Oh, who’s this?” Rhodey asked as he made his way over to sit on one of the couches. Daci looked skeptically back and forth between Tony and Rhodey, so the genius went back to sit in his original position.
But he was a man of his word, contrary to popular belief, and prepared to tell Steve that evening after Peter was asleep.
“Oh poor baby,” she sympathized as she smiled at her frustrated oldest. “Do you want me to spank him?” Now Steve didn’t try to hold back his laughter, seeing his brother throw his arms up again dramatically as his niece nodded furiously in agreement.
“You’re doing great, Petey. You remember how skittish Em was when we first met her? She didn’t trust us either, jumped whenever we got close to her. He just needs time, you know? Keep showing him you are an adult he can trust, he’ll come around.”
"You must be Miles," T'Challa said as he squatted down to Miles' level, smiling as the kid nodded in response. "Welcome to Wakanda, youngest Stark." Miles stuck his hand out in greeting, the adults laughing as T'Challa returned the gesture of greeting. The King stood back up and faced Peter and Emerson, smiling and nodding to the two he had met previously.
“You should do Grace next, cub.” The statement got Daci unwinding from his hug to sit back on his lap and look at him.
The memory of the car crash slowly returning to his mind. And with it, the pain and fear and anguish he felt from it. As Tony looked around he noticed something that broke his heart.
One such particular day, he was pulling James along behind him as they climbed the steps to his apartment after school. He was a little alarmed when he heard Lucky barking inside, followed by the sounds of someone talking to him.
Clint was rocking a sleek black suit, hair spiked up with a purple bowtie and matching cufflinks and purple hearing aid.
“I have a favor to ask,” Buck said bluntly, continuing when she raised a brow. “Can you help me keep an eye on my boy?” he asked, nodding in the direction of the blonde taking his first shot. “You know, make sure no one - including Stark - molests him?” She laughed a little before responding.
“I’ll tell your daddies,” he said maturely as they finished their transaction and walked out of the store.
. He never worked for any of that, pup. And it’s not about being a powerful Alpha, it’s about being a good one. And Sarah Rogers - your Poppy who loves you - is one. Just like Steve, who is also a decorated war hero. Regardless of his reasons for joining, he signed up to protect this country which is something your cowardly father would never do.” Tony had finished his speech with a snap, partly because his ex makes him so mad and partly because his son knew better than this.
ACDC was playing loudly as he descended the steps, asking JARVIS to lower the volume before typing in his code. The ‘harumph’ he heard from his husband only made him smile.
