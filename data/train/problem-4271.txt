“Anything for my Pakhan,” She winks before turning back to the elevator and carting out a large machine and a bag. “Can’t have your new mate having any issues, now can we?” She pulls the machine over to Dean in the living room and starts setting up. “How’re you feeling? Any unusual cramps or other issues?”
Castiel rolls his eyes, not saying anything. He’s not in the mood to deal with his brother right now. In fact, he would much rather curl up in Dean’s arms in bed and fall asleep. He seems to have lost the last of his energy for today. Perhaps Balthazar would be okay with getting a cab home. Or he can call Gabriel. Or Luke if he’s willing to get his ear chewed off. Or Michael if he wants the other ear chewed off.
Just as a warning for anyone who doesn’t like this kind of stuff, there is an explicit scene in the middle of this chapter, and before you get excited, no, it’s not Dean with Cas. It’s just Dean. Also, sorry if this chapter feels a little off, i don't know what it is, but I struggled getting it out, but I hope it's okay enough.
Gabriel slaps the table as if he’s just had an epiphany. “Cassie, you need to invite Dean-o here over to family dinner this Sunday.” He claps a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and jostles him a little. “That way he could meet everyone. Mikey, Lucy, and Balty are all dying to meet the mystery man.” Gabriel chuckles and leans back in the booth, a smug smile playing on his lips. “They’re gonna be so jealous when I tell them I know you.”
Dean’s eyes widen, he actually hadn’t heard about any convention. But now he is feeling oddly nervous because now Castiel knows he is a fan of his show. He doesn’t know why that makes him nervous, but for some reason he feels Cas is going to look at him differently now. Although the convention would be a great present for Sam for his birthday. He would be able to meet Jess again. At that thought he freezes, that’s perfect.
When the man, a beta by scent, sees Cas and Dean, his face lights up and he comes to them quickly. "Pakhan, it's great to see you!"
his brother's back with a nervous laugh. Sure Cas may already know what a huge fan he is, but Sam could easily exploit so many other secrets about him that Cas doesn't know. And he would do it just to embarrass him.
His kit, but he isn’t going to let that happen. If it wasn’t for his damn past, he wouldn’t be so fucking weak right now. Who knew trauma could do that amount of damage. Dean never took it into consideration before.
Cas squints at him like he’s contemplating something. “Nobody is here but us, there is nothing to be embarrassed about.” He regards Dean. “In Russia, alphas often feed their omegas like this. I am aware it is uncommon in America, but I would like to if it is okay with you.”
“Thank you, it was my parent's house, but they gave it to me a few years ago. I have to admit though I would be much more comfortable in a smaller home.”
Cas' frown doesn't leave his face, in fact, it deepens. "I never accused you of being such a thing. I think it's nice that you have something you're so passionate about, be it a tv show or anything else. Everyone has something they love to do in their spare time, or else life would be boring." Cas tilts his head a little, eyes squinting slightly. "You shouldn't be embarrassed about liking something, Dean. And as for people thinking of you as pathetic, nobody would do that. Especially not here."
Cas’ phone starts to sing in his back pocket so he pulls it out and sees who it is. Sees Gabriel's name and tells the brothers he'll be right back before going into the hall and answering the call.
“Dean,” Cas says, squeezing his arm, “look at me, please.” Cas cups Dean’s face and gently turns his head. “You have to know, deep down, you must know you’ve been fighting against something that you didn’t want to win against. Not truly.”
“That was one time, Dean, let it go.” Dean can hear the eyeroll in his words. “I got you cake instead, okay. It’s practically the same thing.”
After that, the women get to work on Cas' hair and makeup. The blonde occasionally flirting with Dean saying he can come by anytime to get his hair and makeup done, and, of course, Dean flirts right back.
Trying to think of something to get his mind off Cas looking devastatingly handsome before Dean gets himself into an awkward situation, he says the first thing that comes to his mind. "Those girls seemed nice."
"Cas, relax." Dean laughs walking towards him a little so he can clap a hand on his shoulder. "It's a joke." Dean locks eyes with the dark haired man and he can't help himself, he wants to see his reaction. "If I didn't know any better I would say you're trying to keep me all to yourself." Dean winks and a light blush dusts across Cas' face causing Dean's heart rate to pick up slightly. He was not expecting this to backfire on him like this. Cas is cute when he blushes. Dean laughs patting Cas' shoulder. "Sorry, sorry, that joke went too far. I'll stop now."
Castiel takes a deep breath and goes back to the kitchen when the Impala drives out of sight. His siblings are eerily silent as they clean up the meal. Not wanting to know why they’re all quiet, he begins helping.
The rest of the day goes by quickly. Dean and Sam are near the back again during the panel, but today is Jess' panel, so Sam was up and running around with his fancy camera trying to get pictures of her, all while trying not to be in anyone's way. But he's 6'4 and running around like an energetic overgrown puppy, so he's bound to get in some people's way, though not for long. Before long it's the end of the second day.
It’s once his tears stopped, does he really think about all of this. He tries to see this from his brothers’ angle, but he can’t. Perhaps it’s because he has rose-colored goggles on and only sees good in Dean. Perhaps Michael and Luke are just being overprotective like usual. Gabriel and Balthazar didn’t have an issue with Dean, so that seems to be the most likely possibility.
Castiel groans and rubs his hands over his face, feeling the weight of this bearing down on his shoulders is too much anxiety right now. He hadn’t slept well last night, his thoughts too busy like right now.
He knows he shouldn’t have gotten so worked up, but he hasn’t had to deal with a mole yet. He was angry.
Dean perks up and his eyes dart to the buffet of delicious looking foods of all kinds. The aroma is almost too much and it has Dean's mouth watering.
There’s a quiet, “Excuse me?” from the other room and Castiel has to bite his lips together to hide his smile.
He just met Castiel Novak. He just choked on his coffee and Castiel asked him if he was okay. Castiel’s eyes were on
Dean walks into the trailer and he has to marvel at it for a second before he can continue. It's so much bigger on the inside than Dean ever would have imagined. Not to mention how well decorated it is. The door to the trailer closes and Cas comes up to stand beside Dean. Dean's eyes finally land on the food sitting on the table and he smiles. Damn, that looks good.
He tries not to look at what floor he's on, and instead, becomes hyper-focused on the doors. Thankfully, it stops moving soon after that and the doors open. Standing right in front of the doors is Castiel. He looks … rather relaxed. He's in his suit, but he's only wearing his white button-up with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. It's a good look on him, and by the twinkle in his eye when he catches Dean eyeing him up, he knows it.
“I should have stayed with you. I could have spoken to Meg later, or sent someone else to get the information of what happened.” Cas sighs, leaning back against the wall. “I thought I would be able to finish quickly, get a headstart, but while I was too focused on my job, I neglected to make sure you were safe.”
“Inias, unusual name.” Dean chuckles looking at Castiel. “Kinda like Castiel.” He leans in and claims Castiel’s lips in a slow, passionate kiss. He guides his tongue into his mouth and Castiel lets him, uncaring about consequences right now. He knows, logically, it’s rude since Dean is in a conversation with Inias and the man can’t leave without looking rude himself. Dean pulls back a minute later and grins devilishly at him before turning his attention back to the blushing bartender. “Inias.” Dean’s eyes seem to shift a little, turning a little colder. “I’ll remember that.”
So ... I'm alive! Sorry about the long wait for this new chapter, but college life is hectic. I'm gonna be honest cause I don't want you guys to get your hopes up, but you should expect a chapter only once a month until summer comes back around. Just know I'm not abandoning this work! I will return. That being said, I hope you enjoy this chapter and thank you all for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting, it means the world!
This look is one Castiel could get very used to seeing on this man. The fact that he’s the cause of it makes it even better and he has to bite his lip to stop from diving back in.
The next morning Sam woke up earlier than Dean, he was nervous all night and he wasn't able to sleep well at all. Today is the day he gets to meet Jessica again after all. Today will make or break him. If he screws this up, he will never forgive himself.
There's a buzzing sound that starts coming from Castiel. Both men frown and Castiel looks down, pulling his phone from his pocket. His brows furrow when he opens the message, and he only looks more displeased as he reads it. Something must have happened. That would be his que to leave, right? He needs to get his things from his place to move in here.
Cas smiles widely at how Dean looks like a kid in a candy store. He’d give anything to see Dean look like this. “Of course, I’ve always wanted to try and play a sport.”
Self-consciously, Dean tries flattening his hair, which only makes Cas smile more, and Dean flattens his ears to his head. “Uh, fine right now.”
Dean smiles nodding understandingly, handing it over. “I get it. I’d go a little crazy if Sam did the same thing.”
In the lobby of Castiel's — and now his, but he isn't thinking about that right now — condo, a man, alpha most likely, is standing at the omega secretary's desk. The two of them are talking peacefully, which is a sight to behold when it’s between an alpha and omega. He's a burly alpha with a beard and a hat on. He's turned to the side so Dean can see a pair of sunglasses hooked on the collar of his shirt, pulling it down into a V and showing off his chest hair.
Charlie laughs, albeit a bit nervously. “It was a long time ago. Long story short though, the bartender confiscated my laptop for … reasons and Dean tried getting it back. Some things happened and some words were exchanged resulting in Dean getting literally thrown out. He talked to me through an earpiece and told me what to say and I got my laptop back.” Charlie thins her lips a little nervous. “Alright, back to Dean.”
Green eyes flash over his memory and his crying halts. Dean. Dean will help, won’t he? He did once when Castiel was at his place watching the movie. Maybe…
When he pulls into Cas’ driveway he’s completely calm, only getting butterflies when he sees Cas come out the door. He can’t stop the smile from spreading across his face when he meets Cas’ eyes through the glass, Cas smiling back just as wide.
When he doesn’t answer right away, Castiel snarls, grabbing his hair and yanking it back again. “If you do not answer me now, I will bring your mate here and rip her throat out in front of you.”
“Just, tell him you're into guys too. Give him a sales pitch, something like why only go after women when you can have both? The more the merrier, right?”
His words sink in his stomach like a stone, and he tries to swallow. “What do you want to talk about?”
He turns quickly and makes his way into the back. They both follow and Garth leads Dean to stand in the middle of the room. Dean is uncomfortable with the whole experience, but the beta’s aura is surprisingly calming. The way he continuously chatters gives Dean something to focus on and isn’t nearly as annoying as Dean imagined it would be. Before Garth touches him anywhere, he tells Dean where he’s gonna touch which is really reassuring. When it comes to the pressure point on the back of his neck, he’s extra careful.
Dean blows a hard gust of air out of his nose in annoyance. Reaching into his pocket, he pulls his pack of cigarettes out. He can
Sam nods his thanks to Cas as he hands him a cup of coffee. “Yeah, Dean, running. I just started not too long ago. I want to get into a habit.” Sam pauses and sees Dean turning up his nose at him. “It’s good for you, Dean, you should come with me sometime.”
Michael's fork stops halfway to his mouth before he lowers it again. There's a look akin to shock on his face as he stares at Castiel. "You met someone … that you're interested in romantically?" Michael's words are slow and measured, as if trying not to spook him.
Dean waves a hand at Sam to tell him it’s fine. “It’s just a sneeze, Samm-” He interrupts himself with another sneeze and whispers to himself, “Fuck,”
That just leads to the question of where Sam is. Dean will have to use his time with Cas to find where his brother is. He’ll look at Stanford first since that’s where Dean knew where he was last. Stanford was Sam’s dream. He wanted to be a lawyer. It’s been six years since he left, so he’ll be in the graduate program. Even if Sam isn’t there, Dean should be able to find out where he went from there.
"Not gay, if that's what you're going to ask." He turns his eyes to Dean with a soft smile, and a light blush creeps across Dean's face.
"Will you at least tell me his name?" Gabriel's petulance is seeping into his tone as he cashes Castiel out and althea Batista begins his order. "It isn't fair that Mikey is the only one who knows it."
Ты выходишь за рамки дозволенного, Габриэль. Ты сделаешь это еще раз, и я приму меры, чтобы остановить это. - You are stepping out of line, Gabriel. You do this one more time and I will take actions to stop it.
Castiel Novak, lead actor on the hit show Mishapocalypse, is no stranger to this list, he has been frequenting it ever since he made his debut as an established actor. His sudden rise in fame shocked many people, but what shocked people more is that he has been single for most of his life, and he mentions he has no intention of rushing into any kind of relationship. This not only makes him one of the most popular and respectable, but one of the most difficult bachelors to get with, so if anyone was planning on trying to get him, you better have a good plan to make him fall head over heels. Here is what was said:
Dean can’t help but crack a smile at her. “You know, it isn’t setting a good example for the students when you swear like that.”
“My dad, he was a police officer. He was good, really good, like you say you are, but even he had cases that drove him up a wall.”
Castiel frowns a little, not liking this at all. If Dean finds out that he is doing this behind his back, it could hurt their friendship pretty bad, and they just met. All he can do now is explain to Dean when he finds out because yes, Dean will most likely find out sooner or later. Castiel would tell Dean what they are doing, but from what Sam said, Dean is delicate about things like this and it could push him back.
Dean’s hands run up Castiel’s thighs and grip his hips tightly. He nips at Castiel’s lips and his words come out in a purr, “Anything for you, baby.”
Dean glances around, trying to get a feel for the place. That’s when the worker comes out from the back. He, as well, is nothing like Dean expected. He's shorter than Dean and he looks rather gangly and awkward. He's wearing a suit, but it looks like it looks like it needs to shrink a little to be a good fit. If he was the one who made that suit, Dean fears for what his collar is going to turn out to look like.
"Alright, I'm coming around and I'll check your answers. If you're out, please make your way off the stage and to your respective seats. I will go over the answers out loud after I finish this." Gabriel makes his way around the contestants and checks their answers. These questions were so easy, Dean was sure that not many people were going to be told to leave the stage. Dean wasn't expecting half of the contestants to be out in stage one that's for sure. When Gabriel gets to Dean, the last contestant, there are only about 11 people left, including him.
“Yes, it’s about my sister, Anna. She’s getting married soon, and she sent us an invitation. She’s been dying to meet you. She was going to fly in when we had dinner with the rest of my family, but she wasn’t able to.”
Dean’s heart jumps and he can’t tear his eyes from the screen. This is real, that’s his kit. He flattens his ears to his head, trying not to get emotional. He never thought he’d make it this far. He clears his throat. Dean puts his hand on the side of his stomach, happy he's doing good. Meg prints a sonogram and hands it to Dean. A smile forces its way on his face and Meg gets a towel, wiping him off. Dean stares at the photo of his son and his breath catches in his throat. He sits up, fixing his shirt. This is more than Dean ever imagined he’d have.
Dean groans as well. “No. Remind me to never have them write a paper again. I regret even thinking about it.”
Yes, that is true, but this rumor isn’t something we have heard about you before in such a serious tone. Is it true that you are actually in a relationship now?
Dean gives a deep, throaty chuckle, his breathing just as rigid as Castiel's. He starts pumping them slow, which Castiel is grateful for or else this would end much too quickly. He leans forward and rests his forehead against Dean’s, eyes closed and breathing heavily, simply focusing on the feel of Dean’s hand stroking them together.
Ты не можешь и дальше укрывать его. Это только оттолкнет его. - You can't keep sheltering him. It will only push him away.
Gabriel smirks. "I know, I just wanted to hear you admit it." Gabriel takes in some more food, swallowing before he speaks. "So you're here alone?"
Cas looks at him and stares for a moment. He looks kind of annoyed. That doesn’t bode well for Dean.
Dean scoffs. "No, it's for my brother." Dean grins and folds his arms proudly over his chest. "I'm an all meat kind of guy."
Dean sets the last of his papers aside and he and Sam divvy out the food. “You get your paper finished?” Dean asks leaning back into the couch with his container of delicious chinese food, ready for Mishapocalypse to start anytime now.
Castiel smiles and takes the proffered hand. “I’m Castiel, it’s a pleasure to meet you, Sam. I wanted to thank you for looking me over the other day."
“Yeah, yeah, but you love me. Hey, don't go making any bets with Dean about who can eat more, I'm still coming in just gonna be late.”
"Accidents happen to anyone, Dean." Cas' eyes remain squinted as he tries to figure out what's eating away at Dean, but it appears Dean wants Cas to back off, so he will begrudgingly let it go. Even though he was to get through to Dean, but something tells Cas that now isn't the time. They barely even know each other.
The kids that didn’t their papers groan but the bell rings indicating the end of the day. The class stands, and those who got their papers returned walk over to Dean’s desk and set their papers on it before scrambling out the door. Dean sighs when all the students leave and he follows suit after he gets his things. When he is sitting in his car driving home, he is trying to think of where he could have possibly left the papers, and that’s when he realizes he could have very possibly left them at Gabe’s Cafe. He wasn’t exactly thinking straight at the time and could have very easily overlooked a few papers.
"That's the one." Dean grins and strides up to the man. The guard gives him a once over with a sharp glare. "Hey," Dean says with a nod of his head. "I'm Dean, this is my little brother Sam Winchester. We're here for Cas."
"Oh my gosh, Sam?" Dean smiles widely at his brother as he plays the part of Jess. "It's been so long! It's so good to see you again. Oh, here, let me sign that for you." Dean smiles at him and takes Sam's napkin, pretending it's the thing Sam wants her to sign. Dean pulls out a sharpie from the bag at his feet and writes on the napkin, sliding it back to Sam when he's done.
He brings his other hand to his cock and continues to pump himself a little sloppily. Thankfully he doesn't have to keep at it for too long before he's coming into his hand and on his stomach.
"I can give you pointers. I'm trying to help so you don't flub this up." Dean's face is completely serious, he wants Sam to be able to look back on his day and smile, not cringe and want to hide under his bed. "Now pull up your big boy panties and lock it in. I'm Jess, look at me with my beautiful flowing blonde hair and dazzling eyes." Dean pretends to throw a strand of hair over his shoulder and bats his eyes at his brother.
When Dean doesn’t respond again, Castiel looks up and meets his eyes. Dean kisses him once more before smiling. “Alright.”
After they finish up their dinner, the four of them decide to watch a movie. They all make their way into the living room and they scan the, rather sparse, selection. Gabriel is the first to pull out a movie.
Dean's soft chuckle fills the car and Castiel feels him put his hand on his knee, his thumb rubs soothingly over his pants. They’re so close that their thighs are pressed together. Castiel feels warm and safe, it’s making him more tired.
Charlie smirks at the memory. “It’s your own fault. You should have just told me you were watching Mishapocalypse. I wouldn’t have had to snoop through your search history on google and find all the pictures of Castiel you were looking up.”
The thought crosses Dean’s mind making him question whether this is the right thing to be doing. There are much more important things he could do with that money than to be buying tickets for a convention and, what, maybe five minute celebrity interaction time?
“Course, I gotta take care of you since you don’t seem to be doing it. Running out in the cold dressed like you were.” His voice is a little huskier than before and his eyes flick to Castiel’s lips. He licks his lips at the attention and Dean does the same.
Cas’ phone starts to ring in his pocket and he backs out of the car looking at the screen. Cas sighs and Sam straightens out as well looking at him. Cas meets his eyes. “I’m sorry, I really should take this.”
"So, Sam, what's with the top-secret mission vibe you're giving off right now?" She smiles and leans in whispering, "Do we need to hide a body?"
"No," Dean says at the same time as Cas. They look to each other for a second and Dean is the first to look at Gabriel. "It's fine, Gabriel. I get to see him later anyway." Dean says with a smile. "I'm sure Sam is wondering if you kidnapped me, so I should probably get back to him now anyway."
“Wait!” The alpha shouts again. Castiel snarls, snapping a glare at him, but waits anyway. “You said you’d kill me, just do it.”
Later that day Cas sends Dean a text with another emoji that reminded Cas of Dean, and this has happened a few times now, and every time Dean held himself back, but he risks it this time. It will be less suspicious now that Dean knows what Cas’ name actually means. So he decides, why not send it?
Когда дело касается моей пары, ты советуешься со мной. Вы меня поняли? - When it comes to my mate, you consult me. Am I understood?
Cas smiles, taking a bite of his food, his posture relaxed, and the skin by his eyes are crinkled. “Only maybe.”
Dean quirks an amused brow pushing through the front doors heading to Baby. “How did you know I was calling about food?”
Cas’ face lights up like it all makes sense. “I understand. It isn’t anything you need to be worried about. I just have some things for you, and then we need to discuss the mating bite.”
I’m sorry for such a long delay, school was kicking my ass! But I’m back now until January and I appreciate you all being so patient with me! Also, I’m sad about the series finale, but it's the reason I have this up now, so I’m going to be immersing myself in writing to try and fill this void...
A light chuckle escapes past her lips as she signs her name. "I used to have a good friend named Sam." She looks up into his eyes.
Sam finishes his first cup and pours another before answering Dean’s question, deeming it too tasking to even try and hold a conversation until he has had at least one full cup of coffee. “I have to go in early today for a mock trial. I’m one of the lead lawyers in the case, so I want to make sure I have everything ready before I go.”
Dean isn’t sure what Cas is trying to play at. Maybe he wants Dean to speak first. So he does, finally having enough of Cas' feathers puffing up and smoothing out. "Something you wanna say?"
"I do." Castiel reassures even though he's pretty sure it was a rhetorical question. Dean puts a hand on his lower back and leads him into the kitchen behind Sam.
Castiel looks through his lashes. Dean is staring at him, pupils wide, mouth slightly open in a pant, eyes half-lidded watching him like he’s mesmerized. He’s the picture of bliss. His hand cards through Castiel’s hair, his touch is grounding and the way he twirls a lock of his hair is like he’s asking if he needs to back out.
Dean arches his brow in thought. Gabriel stressed the word official. That means … Dean's eyes widen and he quickly jots his answer down.
And Castiel knows it's a crappy excuse to say he has to do it now because he could easily say no, but he doesn't want to see Dean upset or hurting in any way. So as much as Castiel doesn't like it, he's going to join in, but only as much as he has to.
Out where Dean is waiting for Sam, he finally sees his brother emerge from the crowd and Dean excitedly stands from his seat and claps his hands together approaching Sam. "How'd it go? You kill it in there? Of course you did, you didn't come out crying. Way to go, Sammy!" Dean wraps an arm around Sam's neck and pulls him down to mess up his hair.
Castiel nods. "I am, but I'm going to stop somewhere to get something to eat first. I haven't been able to eat for a while."
The older man chuckles. “You said his name when you thought I was him.” Castiel mouths ‘oh’ and blushes a little. Dean grins wider, reaching across the table and placing his hand over Castiel’s, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “You’re damn adorable, you know that?”
He walks inside and reaches out, touching a plant that is reaching out towards the light streaming through one of the many large windows. He wanders around the spacious area to get acquainted while Cas isn’t around. Dean loves the plants. They’re obviously well taken care of. He wonders if Cas is the one who takes care of them or if he has someone else do it for him. Does he have that kind of spare time?
The days pass and finally the time Dean and Sam, along with many other people, have been eagerly awaiting for comes along. As soon as Dean got home from work Thursday, he sprinted up the steps to his room and is now throwing his clothes into a duffle bag haphazardly in an effort to be done more quickly so they can leave pronto. Although he should know Sam is taking his sweet old time and is going to have to wait for him to finish packing before they can leave anyway, but that doesn’t matter, he is too excited.
Sam lets out a soft chuckle changing the channel to the one Mishapocalypse is going to play on in five minutes. “You’re an English teacher, Dean. They’re bound to write at least one paper.”
“Exactly.” Sam sighs knowing that even with these two it's going to be difficult. “My brother, he’s had a rough life, and I just want him to be comfortable with who he is. He was fine with himself for the most part when we were younger, but one day when he was 16 he randomly changed. I remember it like it was yesterday. The complete 360 of his personality.” Images of that night flash in his mind and it gives him a little chill. “It was like he wasn't Dean anymore. Back then he was still figuring out who he was, like all of us, and looking back I see the same things happening again. I have a feeling if I don’t help him with this then he’s going to get frustrated with himself and never accept his feelings because they ‘aren’t normal’, and the same thing is going to happen like when he was 16.”
So long story short, Gabriel doesn’t assume anyone’s sexuality anymore. He needs to hear it from their lips for it to be concrete. Also meaning Dean seems straight, but he could be bi, pan, or anything under the rainbow. Another possibility is that Dean doesn’t know what he likes and only goes after women because that’s the normal, and all he could need is a little nudge in the right direction, preferably with his brother so Castiel will stop making those puppy eyes at all the couples he passes and making Gabriel, the overprotective older brother he is, worried as fuck and just wants him to be happy.
In one of the parking spaces is a small black car with windows that are tinted a shade too dark to be legal. He has a fleeting thought wondering if they ever get pulled over for it. Most likely not. When they get to the car, Balthazar doesn't open his door for him, not that Dean wants him to, but he waits for Dean to get in before he gets in the driver's seat.
Before he can speak, Dean is pulling him from the ground and into his lap, kissing him hotly. Cas grunts into the kiss but kisses back when he gets his bearings. Dean swipes his tongue over his lip and Castiel opens his mouth for him, his tongue delving in and exploring, tasting himself on him. Castiel moans, hips jerking.
A knock on the door stops Sam momentarily from commanding his brother upstairs again, but as he gets up he looks at him and says, “Go to bed, Dean. I'll bring something to help you sleep.” and then he opens the door. His eyes widen seeing Cas standing there with a white pot of, what looks like, chicken noodle soup.
Her mouth opens to protest, but when nothing comes out she closes it again. The expression on her face resembling that of a wounded puppy. Her voice is quiet when she says, “I didn’t… I just really admire him. I didn’t…”
Gabriel looks between them and smiles. "Aww, look at you two already flirting, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to save it for dinner."
"My brother would like to join the trivia game, please. I know we're a little late, but please." Sam practically begs sliding his own silver ticket to the man. The man looks down at the ticket and sighs for a second before scribbling 'CONTESTANT' on it in big letters.
And doesn’t that feel oddly domestic, like Castiel isn’t a high-end crime boss? Then again, who says crime bosses have to act a certain way? That’s just a pre-conceived notion everyone has of people like Castiel. Who knows, maybe they just want to be nice sometimes as well.
Neither Castiel or Dean know what to say about that. Dean tries to think of something, but he only succeeds in making himself resemble a fish, but luckily neither of them have to say anything before Gabriel speaks up again.
"You should come." Castiel pipes in, smiling at Dean in what he hopes is a reassuring smile. He looks back to Castiel and holds his eyes for a long moment before he replies.
Castiel sighs louder this time and gets up. “It’s alright. I figure that doing this is the easiest way for all of us. If I didn’t do this then I would never hear the end of it. And if I came to you to tell you about this I would still never hear the end of it.”
Even if he does slip up and his nerves get the best of him, Castiel won't be able to scent his lie. Dean made sure to use his scent neutralizer because he didn’t want to risk anyone being able to scent that he’s pregnant. It’s a little early for the scent to be strong enough for anyone other than the parents to be able to smell it, but he doesn’t want to take any chances right now.
I’m pretty excited about posting the next chapter. It’s gonna be a little different than the previous chapters since it’s gonna be in Cas’ POV. I don't usually do multiple POVs in stories, but part of me really wants to write from Cas' perspective so that's what I’m doing. I hope you’ll all like it, and I'll be here bright and early next week!
They all continue to play their game of soccer, the ground slowly becoming a muddy mess. Mud sloshes up onto the hem of their pants and up their legs, the rain plastering their hair to their heads. Dean keeps running a hand through his hair to push it out of his eyes. He runs up beside Cas since he has the ball and he goes to try and take it, but he fails and instead, he starts to fall. Cas notices and tries to catch him, but it only results in both of them falling into a puddle of mud, along with most of the other men around them. Dean’s shoulders start to shake and Cas looks him over worriedly.
"So, I didn't know this was the hotel the actors are staying at." Dean looks around with some confusion. "I mean, it isn't terrible, but,"
“Yes,” Castiel rolls his eyes. It isn’t like he’s never had a drink before. Besides, he isn’t planning on drinking much. He’ll be perfectly fine to drive them home by the time they leave. “I’m going to need a little something if I want to get through tonight.”
“Alright,” Balthazar scans the crowd before looking back at him. “Just, don’t go disappearing on me this time. I don’t want another heart attack.” He winks and leaves before Castiel can say anything.
Awful Russian Translations (A.R.T.s) are in the end notes!! But they are also in hover text (click if on mobile)!
This makes the alpha jerk and look up with widened eyes. Or, as wide as he can get them since they’re swollen. Castiel doesn’t bother looking at him, eyes still scanning the pages.
After some time, something in Cas' pocket beeps at him. He retrieves it and glances at the screen before looking up to meet Dean's curious stare. "Would you like to see the hair and makeup trailer?"
“Sure thing! I heard about you getting a mate, congratulations to you both. I know when I mated my Beth it was the best day of my life.” Garth beams at them before looking at Dean. He claps his hands together. “Why don’t you come with me.”
Dean continues watching him from the corner of his eye, it's something else to focus on aside from the numbers. What comes to mind, is that Cas isn't anything like he pictured someone like a mob boss to be.
Cas pulls him in and places a gentle kiss on his lips. “I can look for your father if you’re worried.”
Surprise chapter! Since I took awhile last time to update, I decided to give you guys an early update to make up for it.I was able to write a large chunk of this chapter while I was getting my hair done. I was genuinely surprised by how productive I had been xD Hope you enjoy!
Cas hangs up on him, not trusting himself to keep calm if he were to answer Michael. He will deal with him later, but right now he’s with Sam and he doesn’t want to cause a scene. Cas takes a deep breath and goes to pocket his phone, but it starts to ring again, so Cas turns it on airplane mode before cramming it back in his pocket. He makes his way back to Sam and begins to clean again.
“Oh, no I believe you. You’re stalker worthy material all right.” The boy chides with a shit eating grin.
Then all of a sudden Gabriel waltzes over, grabbing one of the empty chairs at their table and sits down with a wide smile, his head resting in his hands. “Do, what's the top-secret mission you're discussing? Whatever it is, I want in.”
“It’s very rewarding when we catch the bad guy.” Michael stabs a piece of chicken. “And I’m very good at my job, so I get rewarded a lot.”
too. You three have fun. I value my life so I'm gonna go.” As Gabriel makes his leave, someone shouts to him from across the set and he yells back to them to un-wad their panties.
He can hear Balthazar now. ‘I can’t believe you tattled on me to Michael, Cassie. I thought you trusted me more than that. Blah, blah, blah.’
Dean doesn't need to be prompted any further before he's at the table with a paper plate in hand. Sam huffs a laugh at how eager Dean is about his food. That man is like an endless pit. While Dean is occupied with the thought of food, Sam uses this time to talk to Gabriel about Team E.L.
Sam huffs a laugh. “Whatever you say, but when I’m 80 and running laps around you you’re going to wish you were me.”
He leans back in, but this time he bypasses Castiel’s lips and goes for his neck. The hand that’s still in his hair grips and pulls his head to the side. Castiel bites back a moan and goes willingly, trusting this man. Dean trails soft kisses up his neck and nips at the sensitive skin right below his ear. The moan he’s been suppressing breaks through and his arms tighten around Dean. His warm breath ghosts over his ear and it sends goosebumps over his skin.
“Do you have any preferences in the material of your collar?” Garth asks when he finishes up all his measurements. Is he asking him? Why isn’t he asking the alpha in the room, that's the common procedure, especially if the alpha is the omega’s mate. When Dean doesn’t answer immediately, Garth looks at him, with what Dean is starting to think is a non-extinguishable smile, and says, “I have samples if you aren’t sure.”
His eyes are locked on the tv trying to watch it, but his mind is swimming with regret, like it always is. One the tv there is a woman walking fast paced down a hallway in a business suit and briefcase in hand, but the camera is panned down so the viewers cannot see her face. Dean doesn’t know her, but the way she holds herself high and confident is enough to catch his attention a little more. The screen flicks to a scene in a courtroom and shows a judge in the podium.
Cas hums and watches him. “This collar doesn’t mean I own you, Dean. It is simply to protect you, nothing else.”
“Whatever just happened, wherever you went?” Dean’s thumb brushes over his cheekbone softly. “You don’t have to tell me, but I need you to know that I’m not gonna run away if you decide to tell me.”
When Dean pulls into their driveway, he is still awestruck with the happenings a few minutes ago. He gets out of the car and wanders into the house in a slight fog, going through the actions purely on reflex. Trying to get himself together he rubs a hand down his face kicking off his shoes, shrugging off his jacket, and hanging up his bag. Dean glances at the clock on the microwave and glaring back at him with bright green numbers it reads nine o’clock. He rubs the back of his neck and makes his way over to the stairs and looks at Sam’s door. The light to his room is still on, but Dean knows he shouldn’t bother him, he’s still writing the paper most likely. Not to mention he’s also most likely still a bit angry at Dean, so instead Dean heads up the stairs and into his room across the hall.
Castiel narrows his eyes and turns back to Dean. Dean is watching Inias for a second longer before looking at him again. When he sees him staring at him, he puts on an innocent face. “What?”
A shiver runs up his spine. He closes the rest of the space between them, connecting their lips. Dean lets him take the lead. Breaking away from Dean’s plush lips, he begins trailing kisses over his jaw and down his neck. Reaching his collarbone, Castiel begins sliding off his lap and onto the carpeted floor. When his knees connect with the floor, he pushes Dean’s legs to the sides, Dean letting them fall away easily, and he slots himself between them.
“Yeah, I know, it’s about the kit. But I’m fine. The nurse and doctor lied about me having issues. I’m fine.”
“That would be amazing.” Dean smiles and Cas leads them up the stairs to his room. When they enter the room, Dean looks around at his surroundings as Cas immediately goes to his closet. His room looks nice. Simple, but nice.
I finished this chapter up just a few minutes ago, so I haven't looked it over for errors yet. That means there will more than likely be some. Other than that, here it is! Enjoy!
Dean turns his attention to Sam just in time to see something flip in his brother like a switch. He pulls Dean behind him swiftly and draws out a pistol, aiming it at Benny, who also has a gun pointed at him.
“I’m taking Balthazar to the new club that’s opened beside Togi’s.” Castiel says into the silence, not looking at Michael. He isn’t sure how he’s gonna react since the last time he went to a club it ended up with him going missing. “He said it’s called Angeles.”
When he’s nearly done with grading the papers the doorbell rings, and there can only be one reason for it. Chinese is here. Had he really been grading for that long? Going to get up he stops when he hears the door opening and Sam’s voice following. Pivoting himself, throwing an arm over the back of the couch he watches the exchange. Sam closes the door and turns to Dean holding up the food with a smile walking over and plopping next to his brother.
Sam still standing in the open doorway watching his brother leave whispering a petulant, “It’s Sam.” to himself.
“Oh, no, I’m good relaxing here with my bacon and having a lovely morning with my buddy Cas here, thank you very much.”
Castiel rolls his eyes fondly and turns his attention back to Dean. The man is watching him, and he smiles when they make eye contact.
Dean looks at him, letting the scent from the plants soothe his nerves. “I don’t have a good experience with collars.”
"Yeah, man," Dean laughs shaking his head. "I don't know how you do it. I have a whole new respect for you and everyone else."
"I never would have thought buying my brother tickets to meet Jess would ever lead to me having dinner in your trailer. Sorry, I…" Dean chuckles a little more. "It's just hard to believe." He looks up meeting Cas' eyes and sees the confusion in them. "What?"
Dean growls, not taking his eyes off his angel, wanting to be ready if the asshole comes back. "No, I just don't want people being grabby with him when he doesn't want it. He doesn't deserve to be molested by that creep."
Gabriel smirks standing up grabbing his plate. "Indeed she does, but I'm afraid I have to go. I'm being summoned. I'll be seeing you two later."
“You've got a nice house.” Dean says as he starts to strip, the conversation keeping Cas in the room, so he turns his back on them.
Once he’s in the room, the scent of stale blood, vomit, and urine permeate the air of the small concrete box. It isn’t a pleasant smell, and Castiel will need a shower before he sees Dean again, but he’s used to unpleasant scents. The alpha’s head is hanging low, shoulders slumped, and his breathing is shallow. The only reason Castiel knows he’s conscious is because the alpha stiffens when he enters the room.
"Uh," Dean thinks it over, taking in what he really feels at the moment. Surprisingly, he feels good. It most likely has something to do with the fact that he is laying in his alpha's bed and surrounded by his scent. "I'm good."
Sam rolls his eyes and lugs his bag out of his room bringing it down to the Impala where his brother currently threw his bag in. “I don’t know why you’re so excited, it isn’t like the convention is today. All we’re doing is going to the hotel.”
Gabriel's eyes widen and he looks at Sam, and Sam nods. "It was back in middle school. We were best friends, but we lost touch because her parents moved and I didn't have a phone back then to get her number."
Seeing this has gone on long enough, and that the boy now crushed her for admiring her idol, Dean takes that moment to step in to stop his students. “Okay, that’s enough, Carlos. Don’t throw that word out there like that. It is perfectly fine to want to know as much as you can about those you respect. It isn’t stalking if she knows everything he has talked about openly to the world. That just makes her dedicated. A stalker is someone who harasses the person in an often illegal or threatening way.”
Michael is silent and that only spells bad. Luke speaks up. “I think that what Michael is trying to say is that you might get along better with someone around your own age. Ten years is a big difference and might cause you issues down the line.”
He brings over a book of samples and shows it to Dean. He glances through the materials, and since money doesn’t seem to be an issue, and Dean is going to have to wear this all the time, he goes for the softest leather and goes for a dark brown. Garth then has him pick out the materials for his suits. After he picks, what feels like the hundredth fabric swatch, Garth closes the book.
A small warm smile escapes her, and when it dies down she gives him a fond look. “I have to know, I heard some kids teasing Carlos about getting his ass chewed on by you. What happened?”
But as for updates, I'm probably gonna be slow for a little while again. I'm in the process of moving on top of still having school and work, so I apologize for any long wait!
Sam wouldn't put it past Dean to be in denial to himself. "But if that's the case, then how to do we help him admit he's bisexual to himself? If we accuse him of it then he'll close off and knowing Dean he'll probably never admit it."
Dean knows that he would be fine driving home, but the thought of staying longer with Cas is far too tempting. Not to mention he’s wearing Cas’ clothes so he should wait until his clothes are dry to leave. Plus, if they don’t
Dean stares into his eyes for a moment before the whole situation begins to become too raw and emotional for him, and he has to look away from his piercing blue eyes. "Well to society, adults aren't supposed to be," he motions to all of him. "like this. They're supposed to be responsible and have socially acceptable interests or hobbies."
When Dean pulls back, Castiel tries to follow him, making a discontented noise. A small chuckle sounds from the man beneath him and Castiel’s eyes flutter open to see Dean leaning in, planting a quick kiss again before leaning back to meet his eyes. Castiel is breathing a little heavier than before and he feels he should be embarrassed about how easily he’s getting worked up, but with the look Dean’s giving him he can’t find it in himself to care. His pupils are blown wide, only little slivers of green are showing. His breathing is heavier, matching Castiel’s, and his lips are pink and kiss swollen.
His attention is taken away from them when he hears the door opening. He can hear Michael greeting Dean. Balthazar and Gabriel distract him though.
And just like that, his nerves are right back. His hands are still shaking a little and he stares at them so he won’t have to look at Cas. “How did you know?” To be fair, he should have guessed Cas knew.
Like he knew Dean was awake, Cas comes through the door with a tray of food. When he meets Dean’s eyes and sees him sitting up in the bed, he looks relieved.
“Yeah,” Dean says in a clipped tone, pulling his door closed. He sees Benny nod and walk around to the driver’s side, getting in.
Dean smirks internally, gleefully taking another pull as he basks in his brother’s annoyance. “You’re always in the car.”
He is not supposed to think of Cas that way when the man let him stay in his house out of The kindness of his heart, and Dean just jacked off to the thought of him. What the hell is wrong with him?!
When they pull up to Inias’ townhouse, it looks peaceful. It looks normal. But normal doesn’t always mean good. He walks up the stairs and looks in the window closest to the stairs.
“Yes,” Cas says, reaching over and swiping some ketchup off Dean’s mouth with a napkin. “It will be in a little under a month.”
“So you like it?” Dean asks as if he doesn’t already know the answer. Because he really doesn’t know, Dean was so nervous that Sam would be upset at him for spending that kind of money and hate the gift.
Deciding it would be much more comfortable to grade the rest of these papers in the comfort of his own home rather than at a hard desk, he gathers the papers and stuffs them into his bag and slings it over his shoulder. He was supposed to finish grading these dang things before the end of the day, but it turns out old habits die hard, daydreaming is one impossible habit to break.
"That's good." Cas sits up. "The bond is sure to change over time, but it seems your body has taken it well."
Charlie worries at her nails as she listens to Gabriel talk, something not sitting right with her. “Is it okay for you to be telling us this? It seems Castiel doesn’t want people to know.”
When they pull into the parking garage, Dean is anxious. He’s bouncing his leg and looking around the garage.
“Ah, it’s not a big deal.” Dean spreads his legs so his knee is brushing up against Castiel’s. It’s very distracting. “What’s your name? I’m Dean.”
“Well, I don’t know about you guys, but I think I have the best job here.” Gabriel jumps in and Castiel could kiss his brother for trying to change the topic. “I get to deal with pastries all day and I come home smelling like coffee and sweets. What more could anyone want?”
“Sounds good to me.” Dean gathers all his wrappers and throws them in the garbage. “I’m gonna head over to Sam’s in a minute. I wanna see what he and Gabriel have on Alistair.”
The three of them all start getting the ingredients and pans out, and even though Sam and Cas both had good intentions of helping with the cooking, Dean was the one who shoved them to cutting things up because frankly, they aren’t the best cooks.
“Wha- n-no, that’s not, I…” Castiel thins his lips and collects himself, feeling his cheeks burning. “I wasn’t expecting you to be here.”
Sam’s eyes go wide staring at Dean who is blinking away his watering eyes from the sneeze. “Oh no,” Sam mutters.
“Yeah, sure.” He scoffs pulling his phone back up and pulling up Sam’s number. “You’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing, Charlie.”
Dean scoffs leaning back in his chair, "If I had to do a panel, and my panel was late at night, I would bring food on stage and eat it while answering their questions. If I'm hungry I'm gonna eat, screw being socially acceptable."
Sam looks up from over the top of his mug with bleary eyes, indicating to Dean he hasn’t been up long either, and a small “Morning.” coming from tired lips.
Dean startles both men when he claps his hands loudly together. Castiel looks back to see Dean standing behind him. "Alright, how about some dinner? That smells amazing."
“Damn, Sammy, if I knew this is all it takes to shut you up I would have done it years ago.” Sam only licks his lips and nods, still lost in his own little world. “Did I break you?” Dean waves a hand in front of Sam’s face arching an inquisitive brow at him.
Also, the dialogue in italics is when they’re speaking in Russian. And just as a warning, this chapter is gonna have some torture, just as a warning.
Dean feels bile rise and his stomach feels full of rocks. This was not how he thought this conversation was going to go. He didn’t think it would go well, but Sam is digging up some things that Dean never wants to talk about.
When he sees Benny watching him from where he’s leaning against the car, Dean keeps walking, not wanting to cause issues if the beta tries something like he sometimes does. He walks down the stairs, and when he gets to the car Benny opens the back door for him before he gets to him. It irks him, but he doesn’t pick a fight about it. He’s gotta be the perfect omega, right?
Dean places a hand on Castiel’s knee where it lays under the blankets of, is this Dean’s bed? “Hey, it’s okay. I was just as shocked as you were. I’m just glad you’re okay.”
As a side note, we are catching up to the chapters I have pre-written, but I'm gonna try keeping the updates on Fridays the best I can.
Meg laughs at that. “Oh, yes, Pakhan is far from traditional, but don’t let that be the only thing you think of when you see him. Know he got to the position he is now because he earned it.”
The door swings open a few seconds later to reveal Cas. Cas’ smile falters when he sees the state they're in. “You're soaked.”
“Back when he got kicked out of the bar a few years back. He was trying to get me my laptop back from the bartender, remember?”
“Well in that case,” Dean leans back in, unlike he did with his brother. “Did you want to come over and watch a movie?”
Dean arches a brow at what he called Sam but ignores it for now. “Okay, both of you put your weapons away. Jesus Christ the testosterone in here is suffocating me. Sam, put it the fuck down! You’re not supposed to be causing problems, for fuck’s sake, what is this about?!” Dean forces Sam’s arm down and takes the gun, emptying the clip and throwing it on the ground. “Where the hell did you even get that?!”
"Cas, what d-" But Dean doesn't get to finish what he was about to say before Gabriel comes back and interrupting Dean.
Digging his phone out of his pocket, he realizes there’s blood under his nails and on his palms. He frowns hard, but he ignores it for now. He pulls up Dean’s number and types out a message, pleading that he has his phone on him.
By the time lunch finally strolls around, he makes his way into the teacher’s lounge, ready for a little R&R. He grabs his lunch from the fridge and plops on the couch, ready to eat. That’s when a familiar red-headed girl walks through the doors in her typical energized manner.
The water pressure and hot water is nice. It’s a really nice change from his shitty apartment. He doesn't rush his shower, soaking up the comfort it's bringing him. He actually starts to feel better after a little while. When he finally gets out, he dries off and looks at his profile in the mirror. The baby bump is almost invisible. If anything, it just makes him look like he's had one too many burgers. He's not naive enough to think he'll remain this flat forever, but he could start wearing baggy clothing.
Cas’ eyes drop to it before taking it. He stares at it for a while before speaking again. “Who’s the father?” Dean shakes his head, rubbing his face. “A full shifter or a half-breed?”
Dean runs a hand down his face, holding his breath. It’s gonna be alright. He grabs his duffle, not wanting to make Benny wait longer than he needs to and slings it over his shoulder. He gives the apartment one more look over before leaving. Right outside, one of his annoying neighbors, a beta, is smoking on the walkway. He’s leaning on the wrought-iron railing with his elbows. Dean tries walking past him and hopes he’ll just ignore him this time, but he has no such luck.
Dean's alarm barely gets out half a scream before he is slamming a hand on it and sliding his finger across his phone's screen to silence it. As soon as he does this, he kicks his legs free from the blankets wrapped snuggly around them and springs from the bed. Typically Dean is not a morning person, but today it's like he's a completely new person, he feels so rejuvenated and excited. Today is the day. Today is the first day of the Mishapocalypse convention.
Cas casts a glance over his shoulder as if assessing where to go. "They're filming over there, so we can head to set two." He looks back to the brothers. "It's Misha's living room."
Bartholomew hangs his head, like a man heading to the gallows. In this instance, he is. “The omega was a distraction.” Castiel only narrows his eyes, waiting for him to continue. “He wanted to go after one of your more trusted alphas. Had to wait until the right time, when everything aligned. Said you took something that didn’t belong to you so he took something in return. Said he’ll keep it up until he gets what’s his back.”
Dean's eyes widen and his mouth parts slightly as if he was going to say something but stops. Cas realizes what he said about being friends might now be something Dean would want and he tries to cover it up. "I-I … if you would like to be my friend that is. I'll understand if you would like to no because you want to protect your brother and you ar-"
Sam looks between him and his brother and slowly nods. "Okay," It's quiet at first, but then he repeats it louder, a smile tugging at his lips. "Okay, thank you." And he turns, leaving them alone.
As Dean walks backstage he sees a bunch of people walking around cleaning things up and getting ready to leave. They're all probably excited or relieved that this was the last con this year for Mishapocalypse. Dean can only imagine how much work it takes to conduct and keep these things in working order, making sure there is no mass chaos.
When Dean realizes what he's thinking, he quickly adds 'to be friends' to the end of his previous thought. A scowl then etches into his face because he can't fool himself like that, but he can sure as hell try. Thinking of a man like that … it isn't normal, so sue him for trying to correct himself. He isn't a lost cause yet, he can still turn himself around. His eyes turn to the dark haired man making his heart skip a beat and the scowl softens.
Dean glances back at Cas who is sitting on a plush bench against the wall. He doesn’t seem perturbed at all about Garth addressing Dean with the questions, which is even more interesting.
He leans his head back, resting it on the glass as well. He just needs to find a way to make money around here. Cas will more than likely buy him what he needs, but if he wants to leave before his kit is born, he needs to start saving now. A problem with that is his new shadow, Benny. Benny certainly won’t let him whore himself out for cash since he thinks Dean is mated to his boss.
Dean lets out a sigh running a hand through his hair as he leans back on the couch. "I know, I'm sorry."
Gabriel makes his way around, and so far nobody got the last one correct all the way, but he hasn't told them to leave the stage just in case nobody gets it right and they have to do a different question. But when Gabriel gets to Dean, he looks over his answers and his eyes widen slightly looking rather impressed. Gabriel holds the mic behind his back so it won't catch his voice as he hands Dean back his paper.
All of a sudden someone walks out on stage holding a microphone, and Dean has to do a double take when he sees it's Gabriel. Gabriel makes eye contact with Dean and raises his brows suggestively, but only Dean saw it. Dean arches a brow and looks around to see if that really was meant for him, and if it was, then what did it mean?
Cas is thankful for Dean letting it go, even if he didn't believe what Cas said to be true. He doesn't know what he would have said if Dean persisted. Perhaps Dean stopped because he himself isn't fond of when people push into his business when he'd rather drop it. That thought is enough to comfort Cas for all of a minute before he remembers he did exactly that. Not intentionally, but he did still get information about Dean when Dean didn't want it shared.
Dean opens his mouth to say something, but Castiel arches a brow. Dean closes his mouth and then chuckles, rubbing the back of his neck. “What can I say? I wanted him to know you were taken.”
Castiel gives him a warm smile, saying, “Thank you, that was very kind. I will have to thank Sam.” while he starts getting up. Dean is by his side in an instant, helping him to his feet. Castiel notices then that he’s in his boxers and looks up at Dean with a quirked brow.
He kicks his shoes off and throws his bag on the couch in front of the television, then he strips his belt off and heads back to his room getting into some more comfortable pants. Now in more fitting attire for the evening, Dean makes his way back into the living room to plop down on the couch alongside his bag and throws his feet up on the coffee table. He pulls out the papers and his favorite red pen, clicking the end and starts marking up the papers.
Dean smirks, only pushing the bar closer. Cas opens, taking the last bit of the kit kat, chewing slowly. His brows raise, and a small smile rises on his face. “That is not horrible.”
He seems like an okay enough guy, but Dean doesn't know his personality enough to feel comfortable telling him about his kit and risking its and his safety.
Castiel’s nails dig into his palms. He was so sure his brothers would like Dean. Why wouldn’t they? He’s kind and treats him right, but they don’t like him simply because he’s ‘too old’ for him? Do they just not care about how he feels? Do they not want him to be happy?
Sam’s eyes stare at the white envelope for a few seconds, probably trying to guess just what could be in it, before bringing his eyes back to meet Dean’s green ones. “Dean,”
"I'm gonna get the bacon cheeseburger too, but the question is, what do I get for Sam and his rabbit food?" He sees Cas' lips twitch into a smile at the mention of rabbit food, and Dean feels his confidence get a little boost. See, it's funny. Sam just doesn't appreciate his humor, but Cas does, and that is honestly one of the best feelings he's had in a while.
Dinner at the Winchester household went much better than Castiel expected it to. There were no awkward silences, much to Castiel’s immense surprise. He and Sam had gotten along great. They even teamed up once on Dean who claimed mutiny and only made Sam and Castiel burst into laughter. The twinkle in Dean’s eyes told Castiel that he hadn’t minded at all.
Sorry about the late update, I was on vacation all last week and didn't have my laptop so I couldn't write this chapter. I’ve also had a lot happening in my life recently, but I finally sat down and churned it out and here it is! Just know, if this feels rushed, it’s because it is … I had absolutely nothing planned for this chapter and I kinda just winged it. (I hate writing dinner scenes like this so I don’t know why I keep adding them in all of my stories xD). Anyway, thanks for sticking with me! Enjoy!
The bed is so soft, Dean feels like he’s in heaven. He lays on his back and closes his eyes, taking in a deep breath. The room smells nice. It smells like Cas, which makes perfect sense seeing how Dean is in his house. That’s when Dean feels a familiar twitch in his stomach. He knows he shouldn’t, he really, really shouldn’t, but thinking that doesn’t stop the heat from pooling to his groin.
Dean gets the hint and divests himself of his shirt without much finesse. The sight that greets Castiel like a work of art. Miles of tan skin, covered in beautifully done tattoos and some finer scars. Some of the worst scars looks to be covered by tattoos, only the hint of raised skin indicates its it's there. Castiel runs his hands up the tattooed abs and chest to wrap around his neck and pull himself back in for another kiss. Dean lets him take the lead this time while his hands glide down his sides and hook into the waistband of his jeans. Castiel's heart jumps in anticipation, pushing into Dean more, silently telling him to hurry. Dean bites Castiel's bottom lip roughly in response and deftly pops open both his and Cas’ jeans, getting both of their straining cocks out of their confines.
Dean mulls it over, tilting his head to the side and humming. “No,” He puts his hand on Castiel’s knee again. “I think I’ll have some whiskey.” Inias nods, grabbing the glass and bottle of whiskey. He places it on the counter and starts pouring it. “You know,” Dean hums looking at the bartender with, what even Castiel can tell in his drunken state is, false politeness. “You look awfully familiar.”
. Michael looks up, meeting Castiel's eyes, and apparently, the look on his face is humorous because he breaks out into an outright laugh.
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe it’s the fact that,” He shrugs nonchalantly. “You practically bolted from here as soon as you found out about the convention and you were so distracted that you left your papers here.” Gabriel smirks, slinging his bag on his shoulder. “But who knows, maybe it’s just me and you bolted for another entirely unrelated reason.”
When they are finally inside, Dean slaps his brother on the back with a wide grin. "Knock 'em dead cowboy. I'll be waiting here when you're done."
Honestly, this convention couldn’t have fallen on a better date, and the fact it’s only a thirty minute drive from where they live is awesome.
Dean sighs and rubs his face. “I’m just … confused.” Dean licks his lips, shifting on his feet. The city is bustling with people down below them. Sam is out there. “He was in California the last time I knew. He was in school. Stanford.” Dean stares down at his hands. “Wanted to be some hotshot lawyer.”
When he walked inside, he must have had a dazed look in his eyes because Michael was relentless in his teasing.
He runs his hands up Dean’s legs and thighs and rucks up Dean’s shirt so it’s out of the way. Blood is rushing in his ears and adrenaline is pumping through his veins as he shakily undoes the button and zipper of Dean’s jeans. The cotton boxers are tented where his hardening cock lays. His own pants begin to feel too tight and he has to shift to release some pressure.
But then again, this would mean the world to his brother, finally being able to talk to Jess again. Hell, he would be happy with just being able to see her in person again, even if he didn’t get to talk to her. The smile that would light up Sam’s eyes would all be worth it, and with that thought, Dean decides he is buying the ticket for his brother. Even if it means Dean will have to cut back on eating for a little while, it’s worth it to see Sam that happy.
“Good morning,” Castiel greets without looking up from a paper he’s reading. There’s a box right next to him, and Dean wonders what’s in it.
bad, and he thinks he’s actually starting to break through if the look he gave him at the diner was anything to go by.
Sam goes to say something about it but is cut off by his phone starting to sing to them. He digs it out of his pocket and sees Gabriel calling so he answers it, leaving the kitchen so he can hear Gabriel over Dean’s coughing. “Hello?”
Dean can feel it in his gut that Sam is lying, but for once he’s not going to push. “Alright, then if it’s not too much trouble, we’ll stay.” Better safe than sorry, right?
"Yeah," Dean takes a bite of food. "Sam and Jess went to school together back in middle school and he's always had this major crush on her ever since."
Gabriel grins wickedly at those on stage, eyes falling on Dean. When he sees his hesitation he arches a brow, but he doesn’t have time to ponder what's going on in Dean's noggin right now. He looks back to the other contestants smirking. "Remember, you're not here to make friends, you're here to win. Show no mercy." Gabriel pauses for a second thinking that over. "But no physical violence, please. Be gentle." The crowd laughs at that.
"And finally, I'm not going to lie, this one is a tough one. There are two parts, and I will repeat this if anyone needs me to. Part one, finish the sentence.
But that isn’t getting him anywhere. This isn't the direction he needs to be going. Don't insult the man you want to keep on your side.
“Yes, thank you for letting me use your shower,” Castiel says and makes his way over to him, but he doesn’t sit beside him. Instead, he places a knee beside Dean’s thigh and straddles him. His hands cup the sides of Dean’s neck, his fingers threading through the hair at the base of his head.
"What?" Dean looks up and simply hands him his phone so Sam can read Cas' message. When he's done he looks at Dean with wide eyes. "Dude you better say yes or I'm going to do it for you."
Dean groans and rubs his face. “Well, he was one of the regular Johns that would ask for me. I didn’t care since he paid well and was nice to me. I obviously didn’t know who he was, but then he started getting kinda possessive. It was unsettling, so I’ve been avoiding him for months now. Ever since he told me he wanted to more or less buy me. He was talking about how he hasn’t liked any omega like me since his mate died.”
I finally get to meet him at the convention in a week and a half! I am so happy I finally get to meet my idol T^T
Sam looks as if he was just handed a rather difficult calculus equation and told to solve it without a calculator, his brows knit together, eyes narrowed, lips pressed close together. Dean wants to say something but he doesn’t want to interrupt his thought process. Is he thinking about Mishapocalypse?
Dean watches his brother have a mental crisis, and he has to admit it is pretty entertaining, but the he sees that Sam has stopped breathing and the funny moment leaves. Dean reaches forward now concerned. “Whoa, whoa there kiddo, breathe for me. In and out.” When Sam takes a sharp inhale Dean nods patting his shoulder. “There ya go, don’t go dying on me just yet. Why don’t you sit down?”
With his towel wrapped around his hips, he peeks his head out. Making sure the coast is clear, he runs to his room and gets dressed. When he finally heads downstairs, the smell of coffee greets him. He scans the area and sees Cas sitting at the dining table with some coffee. The alpha is already dressed in a nice suit.
"Oh, sure." Sam takes his hand off it and Jess slides it towards herself writing something on it before sliding it back to Sam with a smile.
His eyes still locked on Dean, he asks, "Did you talk to Cas?" Sam says this a little quieter than probably necessary, but it's better safe than sorry.
Cas sees his smile and part of him is relieved. "I wasn't sure what you would like to eat, but I remembered you told me you liked meat, so I thought steak would be a safe route."
Dean’s mouth closes and he furrows his brows, and from the corner of his eye he sees Castiel turn his eyes to him. “What convention?”
Dean nods and waves his goodbye. When he leaves the stage he makes his way towards the back, and it doesn't take long for him to find his brother. Sometimes Dean likes Sam's height, it makes it hard to lose him in a crowd. Sam instantly stands up and makes his way over to his brother since there were no seats around him for Dean, and the both of them make their way towards the back.
“That’s alright; we can head to bed now too. Follow me. I have some new toothbrushes you can have.” Cas leads them back the hall to the bathroom and gets them both a toothbrush.
Dean has another slow smile spread across  his face and he starts to chuckle. He closes his eyes and drops his head, looking back up when he says, “You just Ryan Gosling’ed me.”
“Who are you?” Dean asks anyway, not wanting to give the stranger the easy answer by giving out the name he’s looking for.
Inside the elevator, there’s stereotypical elevator music droning on in the background. Dean watches the numbers above the door keep getting larger, and larger … and larger. Belatedly, Dean realizes that Castiel more than likely lives in the penthouse.
When she's back in place, he looks at Meg and arches a brow. “‘S that look like a footstool to you?”
Dean gives Gabriel a confused look. Gabriel is only three years older than Dean, what's with the nickname? Besides, Gabriel knows his name. Unless he's embarrassed to know Dean and is acting like he doesn't. If that's the case he doesn't want to make a scene, so he just answers. "Dean."
There are footsteps coming towards the living room and a moment later a tall man with shoulder-length hair comes into view. He’s holding two large bags of something that smells a lot like Chinese take-out and it makes Castiel’s stomach grumble quietly. Sam’s eyes widen upon seeing Castiel standing in the middle of his living room.
But Charlie, of course, ignores him, and instead is the one to cut him off. “Cas got laid.” He groans and looks at the ceiling, wishing it would cave in at the moment. This is exactly why he didn't want to tell them when he had any kind of sex. They would blow it out of proportion. Exactly like they're doing now.
Misha stops his spinning, flashing the smile that makes Dean heart skip a beat. “Matt,” Misha stands up with a stretch, arms locked rising above Misha’s head making it so some of his skin shows. “About time you came to your senses and gave me another job.”
Dean shrugs looking away. "It's not that I don't think I would be good, I'm great at acting when it comes to lying about things." He almost sheepishly meets focused blue eyes. "I probably shouldn't say that like it's something to be proud of, but it's true. The reason why I don't want to try acting though, I don't want to expose Sam." Cas' features soften in complete understanding. "If I tried it, and I got famous, people would try and learn everything about me, and there are some things I'd rather not have dug up about me. Although I couldn't care less about me and my privacy; my main concern is them finding Sam and taking away his privacy."
Balthazar’s whole demeanor changes in an instant. “Well shit.” He murmurs inelegantly, which is strange for his brother. He takes Dean’s hand laughing. “Cassie, you didn’t tell me you scored yourself a male model. You’ve been holding out on me.”
Cas’ eyes fly wide open. “It wasn’t like that, and you know it!” Gabriel barks a laugh and then all of a sudden there are horns honking on Gabriel’s side of the line and a loud crack of thunder. Cas frowns thinning his lips. “Are you okay? I’m hearing a lot of horns on your end.”
“Yes, but I need to ask you not to drive it without someone following you. I've given Benny and Gadreel a motorcycle as well so you will be able to ride when you want."
Little bro, you got your boyfriend sick yesterday and now he's giving Sam grey hairs, go save the moose from greying early.
The smell of the chicken wafts under his nose and makes his mouth water. It feels like it’s been a long time since he had a full meal and he’s starving. Dean digs in, humming as the flavors burst through his mouth.
Instead of allowing himself to dwell on what could be, he stops thinking and just focuses on cooking. It's what his therapist told him to do when he started to feel overwhelmed. He may not be feeling overwhelmed right now, but he wants to avoid any attacks today.
they are so much prettier in person. “It was really great meeting you, like,” A wide smile spreads across his face and he is unable to stop it as he says, “Awesome, but I have some tickets to buy. See you later.”
Just as it looks like Dean is about to devour him, an arm is slung over his shoulders and he’s pulled into someone’s side. Castiel knows immediately that it’s Balthazar.
Dean throws his head back and startles Cas with a boisterous laugh, but once Cas is reassured that Dean is, in fact, not hurt, he starts to laugh along with him and the other men. Dean’s laughter slows and he looks over at Cas to see him still laughing, his eyes closed. They’re a lot closer than Dean had thought, their legs tangled together in the pile of bodies. Dean’s heart soars hearing Cas’ laugh so close he can almost feel it in his own chest.
But that was years ago now and Dean has admit to loving the show on multiple occasions, but of course Sam already knew this, and Dean was yet again thankful to his brother for playing innocent.
Castiel chuckles at his thoughts. It starts as giggling and slowly devolves into full-blown laughter. He doesn’t even know why he’s laughing, but it feels really good to be so happy. He doesn’t notice the pair staring at him with twin looks of confusion until his laughter dies a minute or two later.
Cas’ eyes widen quickly and he looks up to meet Dean’s concerned and slightly annoyed eyes. “No! Not … nothing like that. That just isn’t how I want to come out to them.” Castiel takes a sip of his coffee. “It’s just nerve-wracking to think about telling them because I don’t know how they’ll react. Gabriel is always trying to get me to get together with women. He says I need to ‘loosen up’ and ‘let loose.’ It’s incredibly awkward since he thinks I’m just shy.”
"I wanted to get my stab wound checked out, or did you forget I was stabbed?" Dean growls, a little peeved that Cas is trying to command him. It doesn’t matter if this is how Cas is used to getting information. Dean doesn’t respond well to commands from alphas he barely knows.
“I’m not getting rid of him,” Dean growls, showing his fangs a bit. Mob boss or not, Dean will fight him if he has to.
He’s right, there’s nothing he needs to be embarrassed about with just them here. He should love the attention his alpha is willing to give him. And he does, really does. But he’s just admitted to falling for Cas today. He’s going to need time to get used to allowing himself to be pampered like this. This is the kind of attention omegas only dream of. But, it’s Cas’ culture, so he should do it, right?
"God, Cas, we were so worried about you." Michael mumbles into his hair and Castiel hugs him back, feeling guilty.
Sam shakes his head. “Not exactly. We’re still talking about Dean.” Sam gives Charlie a little look telling her not to give Dean's feelings away and she gives him an apologetic stare. Sam sighs rubbing the back of his neck. He feels as though he's exposing his brother's deepest darkest secrets that he most likely doesn't even know he has by doing this, but maybe Charlie is right. Gabriel might be able to help. Sam grumbles to himself for what he's about to do and he meets Gabriel's stare. “Anything you're about to hear from us is strictly meant to stay between us. If you agree to this then I'll let you help.”
When the elevator dings, Dean looks back at Castiel, his brows drawing in a look of concern. “Cas? What happened?”
“I could ask the same thing,” Castiel says, arching a brow. “What does Alistair believe harming one omega is going to do?” Castiel doesn’t appreciate the fact that they hurt one of his omegas, but he can’t afford to seem overly attached to too many people. It’s a liability to him and those who he’s close to.
“Full. A panther.” Dean takes a deep breath. No secrets. “I ran into him today.” He feels Cas go stiff and dread starts to creep deep into his bones. “What?”
Dean continues to stare out at the city below them. He hates being up this high, but he’ll admit it is really a sight to behold. His heart is hammering against his ribcage and he’s going to start working up a sweat if this goes on for long. He’ll wear off his scent neutralizers and it’ll be over. Castiel will scent all his emotions and know he’s hiding something.
“Trust me, I haven’t forgotten.” Dean glares over at her, but she knows the look doesn’t have malicious intent. “Have you forgotten you hacked my laptop a few months ago because I wouldn’t tell you the new show I was watching.”
Dean turns around to see Cas smiling at him, meeting his stare. “Hey, Cas.” Dean looks around before meeting his unwavering stare again. “So, where are we going on this little adventure?"
While walking to the little restaurant — if you can call it that; it's more of a healthier fast food restaurant — Dean and Cas talked casually with one another about mundane things, work, laundry, cooking, everyday life things. In this conversation, Dean learns something that he doesn't know why he never thought of as plausible before. Actors are just like everyone else, and if Dean were being honest it makes him like Cas even more because of it. It makes him think that maybe, just maybe Cas isn't outside Dean's reach.
I honestly have no idea how this fic turned into what it did. It started off as an idea of gentle, plant-loving Cas and sad, lonely Dean. Then Cas turned Russian, then he turned into an alpha, then he became the leader of the mafia without consulting me, then he sprouted wings when I wasn’t paying attention. Then Dean thought it looked fun and grew ears and a tail. Now I’m here.
Gabriel nods laughing, hand clapping onto Dean’s shoulder leading him to the door. “That’s what I thought.” Once they get outside and Gabriel locks the shop up, he turns to Dean and points two finger guns at him. “See you at the convention.”
Monday. God, Dean hates Monday. Especially the Monday after such an amazing weekend. Forced back into his reality, back to his everyday, boring, stressful life. Dean just wishes he could go back and relive it, to feel a little worry-free again. Talking with Cas like that, Dean felt so at ease during that dinner. Almost as if he had known Cas his whole life. And for that moment, he wasn't focused on his life and what he has to do to keep afloat. It felt good.
Gabriel sets his fork down on his empty plate and leans back in his chair. "Oh yeah, whenever she talks about her childhood she mentions you."
Dean wonders if it’s a pain to get shirts on over his wings or if he dresses just as elegantly as he does everything else.
to get soaked again, then he isn’t going to leave. Then it connects with him that he isn’t just making the decision for himself, Sam might have something he has to do. He glances over to his brother. “You have anything you really need back at the house?”
“Wouldn’t it have made more sense to feed his victims to the pigs?” Castiel frowns, staring at the credits as he sits as close to Dean as possible, entirely of their thighs touching. “I mean, he lived on a farm, afterall, and pigs eat everything. The FBI never would have found out.” He can feel Dean’s on the side of his face but he doesn’t look. “He was simply getting greedy at the end. Messier than he needed to be.” Castiel shrugs and looks over.
Actor Castiel Novak announced in an interview today that he has in fact found somebody and is currently pursuing a relationship with them, but the thing nobody was expecting was for him to come out as gay. Here is the clip from the interview where he admits it:
Dean, on the other hand, is thinking the same thing. He wants Cas to want him, but at the same time, he knows it isn't right. He can't be giving Cas sexy eyes because that will make Cas uncomfortable and the fact that Cas probably gets that on a daily occurrence with all his fans makes Dean abruptly stop his eyes from trailing to Cas' lips and stops Dean from licking his lips. It would be nothing new to Cas, to have a fan desire him, but Dean doesn't want to be one of those fans. Cas is here to be his friend. He doesn't need Dean projecting his closeted emotional baggage on him. Cas deserves better than that.
“Trust me, I don’t know if I could ever forget the power he has. The way the Bratva act when he’s around, it shows he’s earned their respect and trust. I still don’t know everything that goes on, but I know some. I know Alistair killed Inias as a way to get under Cas’ skin, and I know it was because of me, even if Cas isn’t saying it.”
“Look, I’m sorry. I’m just frustrated right now. I can’t find a damn thing on the ring leader, Alistair is a slippery fucker, and now I’m learning I let you get tortured for years.”
“Benny will take you, he will be one of your guards.” Castiel stands, wings tucking close to his back as he straightens his clothes.
Sam gives him a bitch face, not buying into his little act. "You're practically beaming, Dean. Either something great happened, or you're scheming something awful." Sam pauses for a moment. "And if that's the case then I want to know what it is so I can get the hell out of dodge."
The screen changes to a different scene indicating the end of that one. The new scene is a familiar one, the FBI office. Sitting there at his desk is the familiar black haired, blue eyed man, he is leaning back twirling in his desk chair.
Dean thanks the guard and not a minute later the door swings open and Gabriel is standing there with a wide grin. "Dean-o, Samerella, glad you could make it. Cassie is in a shoot right now, come with me." He turns to the guard giving him a thumbs up. "Keep up the good work, Berry." Opening the door wider for the brothers, he motions for them to come in. "Follow me."
Castiel already knows he's going to blush long before he feels it heat his cheeks. "What movie did you have in mind?"
“In fact, I know that’s exactly what you were planning.” He drums his fingers on the file. “It’s all in here. Would you like to see?” Castiel pulls out some photos of a heavily pregnant blonde woman packing some duffles. There are more of her with a bag of cash. “Tell me why Alistair had you do what you did, and I will make sure she gets out of the country safe.”
Also, as for the convention itself I kind of skip a lot of it because reasons. I hope you enjoy this chapter and I apologize for the late update. I would blame college, but that would be a lie … I just kept procrastinating, but it’s done now!
"Kind of craving some milk right now." Dean rests his hip on the counter. Sam shoots a smirk over his shoulder at him, pulling out the gallon. Dean points at him. “Wipe that smile off your face, Sammy.”
He hears a long-suffering sigh on the other end and he bites his bottom lip, waiting for Michael to tell him he’s upset but it never comes.
Dean can see how upset Cas is by this unexpected schedule change, and he hates seeing Cas like that. "Cas, it's okay, really. Sam and I, we both had a great time today. You're a busy man, we don't expect you to form your schedule around us just because we're here. If you gotta get things done then, by all means, man, go. We can meet up again another time."
Dean smiles and the butterflies in his stomach stir. “Cooking is the one thing I’m really good at. Someone had to keep this sasquatch fed.”
Misha makes his way towards Matt and pushes into this office. Matt sighs closing the door behind them. “After what you did on the last mission I had the mind to fire you, Misha, so don’t go acting all high and mighty.”
Cas stops and looks at him. "No, it's nothing like that. I would gladly help you if you wish to learn, but I wanted you to know that you don't have to."
Dean looks up when he sees someone else walk into the kitchen. “Convenient timing, we just finished up.”
"Normal admissions. Like I said, as much as I would kill to have a better ticket, this day is for Sam. I'm fine with sticking back so he can have more fun."
Dean frowns, the feeling of dread coming back. “How do you know who he is? Who is he?” He knew Cain knew Cas, but if Cas knows him on a first-name basis, what does that say about Cain? Why is Dean’s life never simple?
When their destination comes into view and Dean parks the car, he has to take a moment to look the house over. Dean knew Cas’ house is big, Cas even said it himself, although less directly, but
Dean groans in annoyance, trying to ignore it, but it’s no use, it’s all he can think about, and he’s not going to get to sleep without taking care of it. So he reaches a hand down and palms himself through his boxers as he breathes in Cas’ scent.
As if Dean can read his thoughts, he murmurs, “It’s alright, sweetheart, I’ll teach you. Just go slow.”
Once everyone finishes writing the answer Gabriel rolls his eyes. "What part of 'think long and hard' did you not understand? That took all of five seconds." He throws his hands in the air and walks over to the little podium, leaning on it and reading the next question. "Fine, since you are all just so smart, write down for question two, who was killed in the pilot episode? I want a name."
It’s the moment the tickets are in his hands that Dean realizes Sam could possibly have something going on next Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and he pauses. What if he bought these for nothing? He thins his lips and shakes his head folding up his normal admissions ticket so he can’t see what it is and magnets it on the side of fridge for safekeeping — also putting it in a spot that Sam won’t second guess why there's a paper and gets too nosey for his own good, sneaking a peek at what’s inside. As for Sam’s ticket, he folds it into threes and slides it into an envelope, sticking it under the same magnet as his ticket. He will give it to Sam tomorrow even though his birthday is in three days.
“I was about to do no such thing.” He glares at Charlie. “It isn’t important. It was a one-time thing.” Even though he’s pretty sure it wasn’t since Dean called him babe. Does that word mean they’re dating now? Does that word hold that much power? He tries to imagine someone calling their one night stands babe in the way Dean had but just doesn't feel right. Also not to mention he really wants to see him again. Maybe Dean doesn't want it to be a fling either and that was him hinting at something.
The alpha’s eyes widen. “Wha- wait! Okay, listen! Listen!” Castiel doesn’t. He grabs the man’s jaw and opens his mouth. It’s hard since the man is screaming and trying to get away, but Castiel finally gets a firm grip on a molar and rips it out with a bit of struggle. The first tooth is always the hardest. The man wails as blood pours from his mouth.
"Is there no privacy anymore?" Dean grumbles, wishing he would have been able to be the one to tell Cas. He needs to tell him, but he just wishes he could have done it on his terms.
" When he sees them all finish writing he says, "Do any of you need that repeated?" One of the women nod and Gabriel repeats the first part slowly.
Charlie has a sly smirk spread across her lips as if she can see through him like glass. “Is that so?”
Why is Gabriel trying so hard to get Castiel to go out with Dean? Why Dean? Sure he seems nice and all, but why? Castiel loves his brother, but sometimes he wishes that he would leave his romantic life alone. No, scratch that. He always wishes he would leave his romantic life alone.
“Okay, I’ll-” Sam hangs up on Dean making Dean blink a few times before lowering the phone. “See you in a bit.” Sam has always been like that when he’s focused on his work, he doesn’t mean to be rude, but damn if he doesn’t come across as an asshole sometimes.
“I don’t go over-” Sam cuts him off with his famous bitch face and Dean shrugs a bit. “So maybe I go overboard a little, but you're my brother so it’s allowed. Besides, I’ve been saving up for this for a while now, so don’t be a buzzkill.” Yes, that is a lie, but what Sam doesn’t know won’t hurt him. Plus, they have enough money to get by until next paycheck even with spending that money on the tickets.
Charlie’s eyes snap to him with a smile that quickly drops and she gasps covering her mouth. “Oh my God, Dean, what happened?”
The living room is only lit by a lamp in the corner of the room when he walks out. Dean is sitting on the couch and scrolling through his phone. The moment Castiel enters the room, he looks up and his eyes roam over him. He smiles and puts his phone down.
I have no excuse to why I haven't updated in a month, so I'm sorry if anyone was wondering if I abandoned this work. I've finally finished this chapter though! Even if it is a little short and I kinda cringe posting it, but I don't know how else to make it better, but that all aside I hope you enjoy!
I feel like I need to explain the Demis in this world just a little. There are Demis of all animals, like birds, bears, wolves, panthers, snakes, etc. Dean is a Demi cat and Cas is a Demi Hawk. I wanted to make this world a little different than other ABO worlds, but Demis are similar to Weres if you’ve read other stories where they are called so.
Cas opens his mouth but quickly closes it, placing a smile in place and nods. He only glares at Gabriel when his brother snickers.
Dean nods looking at his plate and grabbing the burger taking a bite. Everyone else following his lead and Cas barely holds back a moan as the flavor washes over his tongue. He savors it before swallowing to speak again.
The brothers burst through the door and run up the table where the man was taking contestants for the trivia game, only to see he's closing up. Sam huffs a breath trying to calm down from the absolutely hectic morning. Sam will be damned if he can't get Dean into that trivia game. It's the least he can do for his brother for everything Dean has done for him so far. If it weren't for Dean, Sam never would have gotten Jess' number, or at least not this soon. Also, Sam did not just drag his brother's ass out of bed in record time to take no for an answer.
"Castiel?" Michael's voice rings through the air and Castiel can hear him kicking off his shoes, not even bothering to straighten them before walking towards the kitchen.
"Can I come to your place?" Castiel asks so quietly that he can barely hear himself over the rumble of the Impala. Dean doesn’t say anything immediately like Castiel was hoping and his stomach twists nervously. He pulls away a little to look at him. He’s looking at Castiel with a contemplative expression on his features. Castiel puts his hand on Dean’s chest and licks his lips in a nervous gesture. “Please.”
Sam doesn't say anything immediately and Castiel is momentarily worried he said something wrong. Sam's eyes flick to Dean for a fraction of a second before turning back to Castiel with a smile. "It wasn't a problem. Are you feeling better now, nothing out of the ordinary?"
Oh, he’s the one that Dean asked to look him over when he brought him here. Castiel smiles and slides off Dean’s lap, much to the man’s chagrin if the pout is anything to go by.
Castiel is nervous, his heart is thumping wildly at all the possibilities of how tonight will go. Thinking about how all his siblings will react to Dean, Castiel finds himself wishing Anna was here. She would have loved Dean. He cuts a piece of chicken a little harder than necessary.
