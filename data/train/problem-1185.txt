Ah… Here we are, the first actual case in John’s blog! Here he mentions he blacked out some names and places for legal matters, but, because we watched the episode, we can see that he changed the narrative a bit to save his own ass (which is totally understandable, considering the events).
"Do you ever shut up?" Sherlock countered, stepping forward despite his better judgment.
His mind screamed at him
“What was that all about, anyway?” John’s voice snapped him out of his daydream. “That purple blanket back there,” he added when Sherlock continued to look blankly at him.
Beside him, Jim raised his hands to hide his delighted smile. “Oh, this is going to be amazing! We should follow them!”
The man’s smile grew and his shoulders relaxed with genuine relief. “Well, we’re seeing each other, now...” he replied, trailing off.
“Well, how was I to know?” he argued, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “If you’d just tell me what was going on, I’d-”

Sherlock crossed his arms. “I would be doing us all a favour. One less assuming idiot roaming the Earth,” he grumbled.
“Do you want to
Harry tilted her head in concentration. John chuckled and repeated his impersonation of the reindeer’s voice.
“Look, over there! Do you know them?” Sherlock whispered as he pointed at the men below.
The princes are growing up and adjusting to their life in the Palace.
Another thing he should have remembered is that horse-riding, although outwardly impressive, is extremely uncomfortable. The beast had been steadily climbing up the snow covered hill for what felt like a century, each heavy step jostling Sherlock in his saddle and wreaking havoc on his lower back.
“So come on, let’s find somewhere to eat.” He put his empty bag under the bed and patted Sherlock’s shoulder on the way out.
He stood up and limped towards the bags to put his lute away. He turned the gas lamp to a minimum while Harry turned around herself, trying to find a comfortable position to sleep.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft called out to the garden, trying to spot his brother below.
Suddenly aware he was standing in the middle of the room, he hastily occupied his side of the bed and turned off his bedside lamp. John put his phone away, cutting off the only source of light in the room.
Let me just start by saying that I realized that she is John’s younger sister. Considering that John (like Martin) was born in 1971, he was 39 in 2010, when he and Sherlock met. Harry is apparently 36 at that time.
“Having fun, do you know what that is?” Sherlock teased. He dangled his feet from the roof, but that only seemed to make Mycroft more nervous.
“We are Palace Guards, sir, we defend the Palace, not the common folk’s pocket.”
Mycroft, always of a more practical mind, was going around the ballroom, making sure that every door was closed. He scoffed at his brother’s dazed expression. Being impressed by moonlight was not something he considered befitting of a royal prince.
Falling forwards will be a willing suicide of the character and the story.
"Was that when they closed the gates?” Jim asked gently.
“Sherlock!” Mycroft shook his brother by the shoulders but he did not respond. The older prince felt cold tears run down his face. “Sherlock, I’m sorry! Please, wake up!” Around them, the snow waves were hardening into menacing spikes and sharp icicles were growing from the ceiling and walls.
“Mycroft? What’s wrong? What happened?” he asked, barely controlling his anxiety. Instead of giving him an answer, his brother directed his attention to the strange man with a tilt of his head. The man kept his eyes fixed on the floor as he clutched his woolen hat nervously between his thick hands.
The younger prince tied his robe over his pijamas, poked two eyes and a smile into his crewmate face and pointed a hand forward. “To
His heart gave a painful twinge at the memory of a much smaller foot stomping to freeze a marble floor. That was the last time he had willfully used his powers.
was below a Royal Prince or some other rot. And the Captain would sooner fall on his sword than go against Mycroft’s orders. No, the only way to convince Mycroft was to solve a crime, quickly and brilliantly, for all of Londondalle to see. Then his brother would have no choice but to employ Sherlock as High Detective, or Supreme Crime Solver (he was still working on his future title).
The smaller prince was heavier than Sherlock had anticipated and they fell to the ground in a heap of flailing limbs. With no injury but to his pride, Sherlock felt his cheeks heat at the miscalculation. He soon forgot about it when Jim’s disheveled head popped up from somewhere beside his right elbow and flashed him with a delighted grin.
“Now!” Jim’s voice cut sharply through the tense silence.
“Yes, we will,” Sherlock confirmed. “We will take the evening train to Exeter and we shall meet you and Lady Violet at the castle first thing in the morning.”
In and out. In and out. In and out...
The powder assaulted his taste buds with an acidic burst and he pulled a face at the flavour. His mouth filled with excess saliva that he had to swallow before he could resolutely pour the rest of the powder into his mouth.
I've decided to divide this chapter into two smaller ones for readability. Next chapter should be out soon, with a new song!
The man put down his mug and broke the silence. “So, feeling better?” he asked amiably.
After a second of panic his brain informed him that it was Billy, standing on his window washer’s pulley, fist raised to knock on the window again.
To his surprise, Mycroft stepped next to one of the guards and whispered, “Ask Mrs Thompson to find him a room and call the physician. Let no one else in.”
. Again, Harry is the first to contribute to her brother’s posts. From her text, I assume she is trying to stop drinking again.
“What do you say?” the Queen nudged him.
go play!”
“Sherlock! You’ve got him?” Jim yelled as he ran from behind his cover, his face alight with excitement.
“I’m not a child anymore, Mummy.”
His mind presented the memory of the early morning of August 15th that year, when Sherlock had just returned home after a long night working in St. Bart’s laboratory. He had just climbed the first flight of stairs when he was greeted by the sight of John’s latest conquest quietly making her way down from the upstairs bedroom. Clasping her handbag and high heels, her hair was dishevelled and her make-up ruined.
“But Mycroft-”
This has been haunting my dreams for months. Back in early 2017, we were still reeling from the fuckiness of S4. One of the most noticeable changes to the Sherlock universe in S4 was the skull painting hanging in the 221b sitting room.
John takes Sarah to the Chinese circus, hijinks follow.
Sherlock gave the bottle a final wary look before hiding it in his coat pocket.  “How do I know this won’t just kill me?” he called out to Billy, already lowering himself on his pulley.
His eight-year-old brain didn’t stop to consider what would happen when the ice harvesting season ended and winter came.
The guard took a step back and eyed the prince with disbelief. He swallowed visibly before grumbling through his clenched jaw.  “I’ll pass on the information...” he said, and turned back towards his post.
Sherlock grunted and threw himself on his parents’ bed, covering his eyes with his arms. “It’s official,” he declared to the room, “I’ll have absolutely no one to talk to… I’ll be all alone!”
As the prince was rolling his eyes at his companion he suddenly saw a speck of colour, hidden between the snow-white branches of an approaching tree.
“Maybe he was looking for Agnes’ frozen heart!” Danny suggested. John felt his cheeks heat at the laughter that ensued.
Sherlock thought with a sigh,
He turned away from the closed door and made for the garden. Maybe he could find some new insects to add to his collection…
Look at the time John takes to reply to that first comment. It’s probably because he is busy typing that next entry
“You’re not helping me find him, you’re just the transport.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened as the pieces fell into place in his head. “I imagine that it would be terribly convenient for some if the Ambassador would suddenly…”
“Careful, Johnny! You don’t want to end up like old Paul over there!” Danny pointed to the man across from him. He looked old to John’s young eyes, but he wasn’t a day over forty-two. His face, burned from years of working in harsh conditions, was etched with deep lines around his eyes and mouth, and whenever he took off his hat, you could see he was missing the top of his left ear and much of his right one.
“I said I was sorry!” There was a hint of desperation in the King’s voice. “I made one mistake, one single mistake. But I sent him away…” His voice had lowered into an angry whisper and Sherlock had to strain to hear him. “I apologized and I’ve been apologizing every day since then. But your heart froze... and I don’t think there is anything I can do to melt it.”
First thing’s first. Both
Next, he addressed Mrs Turner, who was standing a few feet away from the crowd.
He took a few deep, steadying breaths, gathering his surroundings.  He had entered a cozy little shop, filled with an impressive array of products - from vegetables to medicine to climbing gear, all displayed in neat shelves and cabinets across the room. There were no signs of life beyond a large fire crackling in the hearth on the far wall, and that was all that Sherlock needed, really. He closed his eyes and let the warm, smoke-scented air fill his nostrils and warm his lungs, relaxing his aching shoulders and back.
In the first posts (pre 29th of January), she is repeatedly trying to reach out to John. Just like Sherlock later deduces
Emboldened by his brother’s unusual amiability, Sherlock decided to take a chance, “Listen, Mycroft, I was thinking-”
The younger man hoisted a length of rope over the roof and tied it in a complicated knot. Only when he was happy with his handiwork did he pushed on his hands to climb onto the roof.
“After much consideration, I’ve decided that my talents would be best put to use in the field of active criminal investigation, instead of rotting away behind the palace’s walls,” he began. “I brought this subject to my brother’s attention it the most effective way possible - by successfully uncovering a secret assassination attempt at his own coronation - Jim helped, of course.”
John and Sherlock meet for the first time.
, let me say that I truly believe Redbeard was Sherlock’s beloved childhood dog. He was referenced several times before S4. It makes
“It’s decided, Sherlock.” The Queen’s scowl left no room for argument.
Another is the gruesome reference to
There was the sound of uneven steps on the wooden floor and then he heard the stranger’s voice near his head.
“Hm…” John mumbled, still asleep. Sherlock could feel his friend's voice resonate under his cheek.
Protected in the walls of his new palace, the king took the ultimate weight off of his head. After fixing it with a scowl, Mycroft threw his crown away as far as he could. The golden circlet crashed against one of the forming ice pillars and became incrusted in it, barely visible under the frosty surface.
“Hey!”
With practiced ease, he climbed down the roof and jumped through his bedroom window onto the floor. A few long strides had him walking down the hallway towards his parents’ bedroom. He maneuvered gracefully around the few footmen that carried several items of luggage down the corridor. Out of habit, his steps slowed by Mycroft’s door, but did not stop.
Billy looked thoughtful for a moment as he scratched his chin. Sherlock realized Billy scratched himself a lot.
Annoyingly, John clicked his tongue and Sherlock felt the sledge slowly coming to a halt. Both men sat in stubborn silence while Harry huffed and looked back, curious as to why they had stopped.
“Aren’t you supposed to be a detective?”
Sherlock let himself be held for a few more seconds before stepping back. “I didn’t think you meant it,” he said, sulkily.
He ignored the window washer and ran back to the Ballroom, now completely empty apart from the musicians. The maids had finished setting the tables with an impressive array of cakes, puddings and other sweet treats. Sherlock scoffed at the display. Leave it to Mycroft to have a room filled with deserts.
- “This is me”
“No! Stay back!” he warned, holding his hands in front of him, “I don’t want to hurt you!”
The next morning, John found the world’s only consulting detective sitting fully clothed inside the small bathtub, typing away on the laptop perched precariously on his knees.
ilable team!”
- My fictional nation of Gaulia is based on the name Gaul (Gallia in Latin), a large area of Western Europe during the Iron Age that includes the modern French territory, between others. Since Lestrade is a french surname, I thought that it was a perfect excuse to include Greg in the story.
“Do what you must.” The Grand Stamford bowed deeply, and so did the other trolls.
“How did you know?”
). And isn’t she happy she is reading them now.
Billy coughed awkwardly. “I’m sorry to wake you up, your princeness. But what are you doing up here? You are the prince, right? The younger one?” he asked again.
Defeated, Sherlock returned to their song. “
“I’m sorry, dear,” Mrs Hudson said, shaking her head. “Last time I saw your brother we were all playing in the Ballroom, remember? What fun we had!” Sherlock nodded encouragingly, although he had no idea what she was on about.
To his surprise, Jim sat back and smiled. “Yes!” he breathed. “There’s been some conflict between the northern countries about the prices of wool. The Ambassador has been terribly effective in keeping Suomi at the front of the race.”
(See the end of the chapter for
) and is not some cold blooded machine. But I think there is still a measure of caution in John’s words. He says that Sherlock does care, despite himself. He values their friendship, but he still lashes out and calls him a freak.
“Your Majesty, you honour us!” an elderly woman bowed deeply, blocking his path.
“How could I?” he replied absently, still looking at the people below.
e’s Mrs… Hudson!
“The Kingdom thanks you.” Mycroft bowed his head and turned to leave.
The foreman had employed his father this harvesting season, eight-year-old son in tow and all. But the problem that had driven Hamish Watson from their

The tilting effect is not new on
Mollified, the prince decided to tell Lestrade what he knew. It would be best if Jim had another person he could rely on while Sherlock was away...
Sherlock nodded “Yeah, and mine’
who introduces himself as an “expert on sherlock holmes” and is all around creepy. He thinks he would do a better job than John and is disdainful of “society”. This could be Mycroft, but I’m not sure if Mr MI6/CIA/British government has the time to troll John’s blog.
The snoring stopped.
Before John could expound any further, Angelo came clomping into the room, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction.
Nausea rolled in Mycroft’s stomach and he tried to swallow it down. He thought of his father once again, trying to summon his calming presence. Feeling hundreds of eyes staring at him, Mycroft slowly took off his gloves, placing them carefully besides the Royal Orb and Scepter. His shaking hands hovered over the objects for a second before he grabbed them and turned around quickly to face the assembly.
“You’re not! I think I know what you mean,” Sherlock was quick to reassure him. “My brother and I aren’t close, either. Well, we used to be, when we were little. But, one day, he just
Before he knew it, John was pushing a bag onto his hand and throwing him over the dash and onto Harry’s back - an impressive feat for a man his size. It was all Sherlock could do to hold on to the reindeer’s mane and look offendedly back at John.
“Well, look at it this way,” he told the guard, “if you catch that dastardly criminal all by yourself, maybe you’ll get a medal. I’m sure that would be enough for your wife to stop sleeping with your neighbor.”
Finally making up his mind, Anderson picked up a pastry and leaned back against the table with fabricated ease. Something about his self-satisfied air made Sherlock’s skin crawl.
, in S4 some of the stories adapted have had some drastic tonal changes. One example is
As a meta person, I've been leaving a few easter eggs around the fic, but as I was commenting the chapters with my beta @CarmillaCarmine, I realized that some of them are really obscure. I just wanted to clarify:
I think this is the most interesting part about this post, because tells you what happen to John between the time he leaves 221B to go to Sarah’s and the time he walks out before Sherlock at the pool, wrapped in explosives.
“Being enucleated?”
een you do that before!” he took a few tentative steps on the icy surface.
“Looking for criminals,” Sherlock answered simply.
He laid out the relevant facts in his mind for inspection. Back in Baker Street, while Sherlock always kept his bedroom door open, John made sure to always keep his own closed (and sometimes locked - silly John). Sherlock briefly considered the sound conductivity of the different building materials in Baker Street. Yes, a closed door might have hindered some sounds traveling from the upstairs bedroom to the lower floor if one considered...
John’s eyes flashed with surprise before he scoffed derisively, “Oh my, and you got all of that from spending a day with him? Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?” he mocked, turning his attention back to the path ahead.
“I’ll stop taking it, obviously,” Sherlock sniffed defensively.
Sherlock turned around with a start in time to witness a sentient snowman waddle from behind a bush and into view - a snow woman, more precisely. She was a particularly small specimen, no taller than a small child, with a snowy hair bun, two twigs for arms and a delicate skirt made of frosted ice. Her face was composed of two round black pebbles for eyes and another smaller one for a nose, while her mouth was a simple indentation on her snowy face. Despite her crude features, her eyes had the unmistakable spark of life about them as they gazed contemplatively at the frozen trees.
They formed groups to score the lake and begin splitting the ice. Some drove the horses as they pulled menacing ice plows, others worked with ice picks, chisels and saws. John ran after them with his own ice chisel, Harry hot on his heels.
” she squealed.
There was a mutter of assent from the crowd before Sherlock felt a soft bundle being pressed against his leg. Looking down he saw Jim holding up a woolen cloak for him to take.
He was the Crown Prince, soon to be King of Londondalle. His duty was more important than his fears. He would stand tall and fulfill his destiny.
John-" He interrupts, indignant, and they start talking over each other, John trying to get him to "listen, I'm trying to tell you that I-" and Sherlock cutting him off, raving something along the lines of "Enough. I've heard enough lies. Don't insult my intelligence by expecting me to believe them. I don't know why you even bother-" "I am not lying to you, you idiot-" "Oh, just give it up, will you?"
"Precious," she says, referring to John's telling expression, "do you see the look on his face?" She asks Sherlock, who doesn't move to look at him. Shes not satisfied just torturing John clearly, she has to be cruel about it as well, as if injury alone without the insult weren't enough. John is unable to stand by and contain the all-consuming, blinding madness that seems to have come out of no where and completely taken him over.
“Sorry, you’ll have to excuse me,” Sherlock stands, trousers now refastened.
"Losing him already?" she enquires, though it's more of a taunt, overflowing with non-concern.
“I don’t know what’s real anymore,” though reluctant to admit exactly how far gone he is, the truth is he has no idea what’s fiction and what’s not, or where the line between the two is. If he’s breaking rules it’s not because he’s been looking for any walls, “They put me on so many kinds of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants I’ve lost track. I could be talking into a banana right now and I wouldn’t know the difference.” It’s not actually funny.
" Oh please. This isn't the most tenacious delusion he's had, but it certainly is the most melodramatic.
!" John says fiercely, overriding him, "I adore you more than anything-" "
His gaze narrows on her skeptically. They’re in the lounge billiard room. She has the option of choosing any game to her liking- she couldn’t have picked something she had more of a chance of winning, say, pool, darts, or cards? It cannot escape her that her choice in game has given him a clear advantage.
"It's not a 'casual visit'. It's work-" John has to halt him in his tracks then and there, holding out a hand to his chest. Again they come back to his initial reaction to the whole thing. No. No way.
“Don’t you want to John?”
John realizes that the moment he got shot the second time, that was the last time he saw him and the last time he would ever see him. He would never see the color of his eyes trained on him again. He would never see what was in those eyes, all the emotions that he thought were false, but had actually been real.
"John, maybe you should stay back, you know, considering your condition?" he says uncertainly as he's collecting his coat.
"On a date," Sherlock repeats smoothly, like it's nothing out of the ordinary, "With the woman. I'll be back late." He dips past John into the living room to collect his blazer from the coat stand, draping it over his arm.
Mary turns around to see Sherlock, the only solitary figure visible for miles against backdrop of the dancing couples. He wears his customary know-it-all smile, eyes a warm light teal, silver necktie and vest agleam with overhead light. While his dark mop of curls displays a photogenic array of tonality, his frock coat is submerged in black cast shadows in the high-contrast. His arm bent and attached to his waist, his weight is shifted to a side. Sherlock stands there, in matching attire, looking so insufferably full of himself, that Mary skips straight past relief and goes straight to damage mitigation.
"He was your father," he says aloud. Then it occurs to him she was the missing link he'd been looking for, the smoking gun he knew existed but could never find. "You. When he found out years after the fact that he had a daughter with one of his victims- your mother- he'd wanted to get rid of the evidence of his crime- to get rid of you. When your mother hid you from him he-" he stops, kicking himself, "Why didn't I see it? It was because of you. You're the reason he killed her."
Dry-clean or machine-wash? ” he lifts one hand, then the other, then drops both, “Is he invisible, because as you may (or may not) have noticed I was in the flat the whole week taking care of you with the only other bloke I’ve said so much as three words to being the self-service machine at Tesco!”
Sherlock rolls his eyes at his nonsensical and irrelevant line of questioning. Why was he being annoying. Could he not reschedule his emotions to some other, more convenient date?
"John, let me go!" he demands, appalled.
, the voice says, but John snuffs it out and behaves. He takes the infernal thing from Sherlock and tugs him by the lapel so that he's only a step above him on the stairs.
“Yeah. Silly me.” John rolls his eyes. It should be obvious that there’s no need to apologize for implausibly offending the feelings of an
"Leave him, John," he says softly. John stands back, feeling very uncomfortable watching the mounting panic in the man's eyes as the door closes on him, serial killer or not.
Is he seeing things? He’s seeing things.
Glancing into the rooms as he passes by, he gets a weird area 51 feeling- there are racks and racks of corpses. What the hell is Sherlock doing in a giant mortuary like this?
"Dad that was you getting married to Sherlock,” she explains.
Mary looks at him in confusion as the doors close between them.
Then he wakes up again, coming to with sunlight is peaking through his eyelids. His eyes blink open and he shields his eyes with his arm, pupils contracting in the blaze of high noon. He sits up and sees that he still has two legs, though his left pant leg is torn into rows of welts, consistent with a shark bite. A very gentle shark bite. Either it was being considerate or it got interrupted.
“My reasoning is... common sense.”
John looks at the mug, then looks at Sherlock. It’s really not much of a decision. He wants his tea. “Yes.”
"Sherlock? What are you..." At first John is surprised to see Sherlock there at all, under the impression he was still at the flat, unawares John had even left. He's entirely not sure how Sherlock had ended up at the Diogenes, a place which he normally avoids with a six mile radius. He starts to consider that perhaps the detective had been following him, but then he sees who he's with and her hands all over him.
"Something happened during the case. I wasn't there. I--” John bites down hard, he veils his eyes with a hand and tries to breathe. I
“Explain yourself!” Sherlock demands, John looks at him like he’s speaking Cantonese. Explain why he overused the Listerine? Sherlock’s the one monitoring how many millilitres of Listerine he uses. Is
Sherlock looks ominously down at the silver, sharpied USB drive clenched in his hand.
“There. See?” John remarks, glaring at the ceiling in a perfectly-implausibly-straight, outstretched position, “Good we got that out of the way.”
“No, no, wait, Sherlock-“ John scrambles, grabbing onto him like a cat with claws, dragging him off balance rather than stabling himself, and they topple chaotically onto the oriental carpet, a heap of limbs alternating slacks and denim. Sherlock is an unruly bushel of curls sprawled on top of John, trying very hard to contain himself, and failing.
And then nothing.
How is it possible?
“I don’t need to tell him anything. Everything he needs to know, he already knows,” Sherlock states nondescriptly, taking a backstep in concordance with the give and take of the waltz.
"Did you find something?" John asks when Sherlock draws out a scalpel he swiped from the ME office and kneels down to make an incision, exchanging his leather gloves with latex.
“Why does she even matter, Dad? She’s dead—“ Sherlock system-resumes to full alertness and quickly covers Mary’s mouth.
This is the solitary occasion on which brunet has had the chance of examining such a pristinely preserved human body, he’s not liable to just let the daft creature eat it. Keeping his human clutched to his chest, his dim, sun-lit irises skim over the horizon and locate a nearby patch of land emanating from the island. He delves down into the wake, his tail bottoming up with a curtain of trailing water and flopping down into the distorted, crystal blue water. He reemerges shortly after in the shallow region of the tide, his torso and the upper part of his tail exposed to the open air. He leers at the foreign terrain, squinting his glowing eyes, one arm rung around the prone, outstretched body, the other locked and supporting his weight.
That leaves Sherlock perched precariously beside his latest temptation, lying defenseless on the sofa, in a situation much like the one he found himself in with the cab driver, with a burning curiosity that has largely proven itself to be a self-detriment. An idea, just a simple idea so easily testable, clinging with increasing tenacity to the edges of his mind, until it’s completely consumed him.
After a brief pause that feels like it should be filled with elevator music, “
“What’s gotten into you?” John ventures to ask, because Sherlock doesn’t normally make breakfast, or lunch, or dinner, or anything classified as
"No."
How strange. Even to him, it seems borderline irrational to go risking your life for a pet. He never would've thought Sherlock of all people could love something that much.
Sherlock feels it too, though he doesn’t say anything, gone inconspicuously quiet again. He brushes against the top of John’s ear, and John flinches at the unexpected tickle of it, which makes Sherlock stall hesitantly with an apologetic air of sorts, not sure what to do. In seeking to free his road-blocked friend, John stops preoccupying himself with trying to spare him a noseful of ash blonde hair, instead leaning his head against his jaw a little so as to say he’s not allergic to him— or his particular strain of cooties.
You were there!” John flails wildly.
John thinks he hears crickets. “At waltz,” John fills in for him in the span of emptiness.
At the tail end of his shift, he and practically the whole rest of the ward gets an earful from a woman screaming at her financially incompetent husband about how she's not going to take care of him if he gets another heart attack. The senile inpatient in the bunk next to them tells her that in the grand scheme of things she ought to be kinder to her husband, even if he is a useless, and inane and all the things aforementioned. John finds himself staring dumbfounded at the elderly man who voiced this opinion for no apparent reason, then introspectively pondering over it the whole drive home.
John salvages the wood and turns back. Every time he pauses or takes a break on his journey back to the stock pile, his eyes drift curiously back to lion lounging on its pedestal. It calmly watches him back, green penetrating the darkness of its fringe, stark against its porcelain skin. What he finds so addicting to watch is something he can’t really isolate, it might be the concatenation of its eerie exotic features, fixated on him. It’s beautiful, horribly beautiful.
Sherlock frowns, looks confused, and in the end he just guesses, placing his hands on John’s hips, clasping around his back so that his arms ring around John, like John’s ring around him.
Sherlock blinks at him, seeing that John’s staring at him so intently. John steels himself and reaches for him, carefully this time, like Sherlock is wrapped in caution tape that says fragile. He breathes a sigh of relief he didn’t know he was holding back when Sherlock doesn’t recoil from him like before- when he finally manages to pull Sherlock's slender body completely into his arms. Blinking back the glassiness in his eyes, he turns toward Sherlock’s ear and presses a kiss against his dark hair.
"What is this?" John asks off-handedly, looking down at their feet, Sherlock’s black oxfords shadowing his Loakes— light brown.
"I appreciate your skepticism, but, she has... done this sort of thing before. She has certain nack for neural circuits, from what little I understand."
he thinks.
John stiffens, puzzled by the comment.
She stares at him for a moment, apparently quite floored. She looks so genuinely baffled in a way that very nearly makes Sherlock second guess himself.
“Taking me outside in broad daylight. Pretty bold,” he remarks at the spurts of water, cascading from tier to tier until they pool at the base.
“And my hands are where?” Sherlock eventually returns, analyzing the new arrangement like it’s a Tetris puzzle and.. possibly having an Asperger’s moment.
"Unfortunate
“What body, Sherlock?”
They would discuss this.
A startled yell, the sound of his own voice, fills his ears at the sudden moment of its darting forward. His scream is cut short by a shortage of breath, what feels like a choke hold or a knot in his chest. He braces himself, waiting for the moment of impact, but it never comes.
" Sherlock hammers into him, exasperated they have to go over this again, "I'm the only one who can stop her. She has everyone else under her power-" ....and they topple onto the floor, along with the lamp precariously perched by the arm of the sofa.
Of course Sherlock is serious. Why wouldn’t he be serious?
"Eurus?" John asks, "yes, she... she brought me here." John says, looking back at Sherlock. "She took off at the entrance. Haven't seen her since."
. The last time John and Sherlock had a
John shakes his head in discontentment, knowing what goes up, must go down, or in the case of Sherlock’s new-found hopes, crash and burn into one of his sinister black moods. Mary exhales a exasperated, amused sigh at the kitchen’s infallible egomania, veering toward the cluttered mantle above the fireplace with Sherlock’s dusty bat and beetle vivarium.
“No ring,” Mary says as the thought occurs to her.

“Dr. Watson get your hand off of me or I’ll have your disbarred for assaulting an employee.”
“But he is my father.”
“I did actually, Dad.” She might be referring to her father, but it seems increasingly apparent she’s referring to Sherlock because they’re staring at each other with blinking-contest incessancy. They have a moment, naturally, because Mary has never called Sherlock

Sherlock Holmes is indeed stumped by the question, tongue-tied and inevitably thwarted in every alternative explanation that occurs to him. Her argument is admittedly convincing- the simplest explanation is, in fact, that Mary is the result of Sherlock having magical pixy horses with John.
“Right,” John nods in stoic concurrence. Sherlock stands there, wiping his fingers. The fabric, tossing from hand to hand, weaves in and out between his digits with deliberate efficiency. The silence draws attention to his brisk, mechanistic movements, and makes John restless. The whole atmosphere feels oppressive.
“Alright, alright,” John concedes with a hand wave, backing off.
Mary: And you still can't figure it out?
," he says with such adamance he imagines it must faze him- that Sherlock can't not feel an unexpected thrum of pleasure seeing John kneeling like that in front of him and telling him he's God. "That is exactly
At some point in the midst of their conversation they find themselves at gun point. Perhaps they should have thought twice about arguing in the cavernous, echoing sewer system that was the underbelly of Greater London, announcing their position to anyone within a 30 foot radius.
"Now we both know that's not true," she murmurs reverently into the nape of his neck. The obscure comment an serves as a reminder of what happened that night before last. It's unsettling but he suppresses the feeling. He lets her press into his hair, though the sensation is unusual to him, feeling foreign. "You know, no one likes a tease."
“Fifty,” John returns.
He covers the foliage with the heavier material to avoid it blowing away in the ocean breeze. Then, with a quick once-over on the ocean again, he sees the surface has adopted a translucent turquoise sheen under the daytime and vanishing cloud cover, and notes a few gulls flying high in troposphere, disinterested in his minuscule island of death.
The staring, which John had thought was harmless at first, begins to feel almost like flirting- the gall with which they stare at each other at such close range without breaking the static silence. He begins to think about the creature even when he’s not looking at it, and starts having difficulty tearing his eyes away. Before he knows it, its constant watch is making it difficult to perform his facile task, or even think. He thoughts are tangled by the creature, beautiful, horribly beautiful, all-consuming, breath-stopping, frustratingly inescapable beautiful.
“You would know exactly what to say to make me stop,” his voice is haunting, downright possessed. He's not well, that much is frightening obvious.
Sherlock smirks like he has all the aces, that and a whole separate deck up his sleeve because he’s a cheat.
Then it cleverly occurs to him, “Well, there is one thing I could show you—” he muses, his voice mysteriously deviously DL as he steps forward and bridges the gap John’s left— a line personal space between them made by leaning back, now crushed to a sliver between the planes of their chests. Sherlock’s arms close against his ribs and fasten around his frame, hands sweeping against the cable-knit of his jumper, bringing John forward so that his elbows narrow around Sherlock’s neck. It’s gradual, and natural, and John doesn’t even notice, having gotten himself casually lost in the depths of Sherlock’s mind palace.
"Sherlock-"
Sherlock: No.
He's willing to play along if it gets him what he wants.
“If he actually paid rent, that'd be one thing- I mean, having a roommate makes sense as long as they help pay the bills and don’t try to sabotage you when you do. But Sherlock doesn’t do either of those things.”
. John clenches his fist, turns his neck away from his hand with reserved tension. “You can’t give me.”
"How may I be of service?" Mycroft asks with his usual, insufferable drawl. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
Sherlock isn’t good at noticing when people are making fun of him, but he does know that when Mary uses John’s first name like he does, she’s psychoanalyzing him.
"Sherlock, that is not what this is!"
close enough to count the threads of his shirt.
Sherlock leans in. “But you already knew that,” he whispers cleverly. Mary looks at him lamely, with an unimpressed glare that’s not quite so good as John’s, but still a good effort.
“Or you’re just,” John continues, finding it difficult to speak, possibly because he’s looking at the beckoning pavement below, remembering how his heart broke apart and bled out on that swept-clean sidewalk. “trying to stop me from following you,” His knees are about to buckle any second.
That seems to be the right answer, because John chuckles irrepressibly and looks up with a smile, eyes alight with green-grey mirth. Sherlock stares humourlessly at that ephemeral warmth, chronically dampened with pain. Then John’s smile falls away into a line of open mouth.
“Mycroft,” John breathed in surprise.
Mary wanders off without further explanation, shedding her coat.
? Shouldn't it be the other way around?
"It was his," Sherlock says frantically, pointing at the cadaver who cannot speak to defend himself, then pulls John to the side. "John what are you doing?" he whispers.
She points to the passage on their right. "Sherlock is down that way. You'll find him at the end of the hall. The code is 12422476034." And she's gone before John can tell her not to. John huffs in annoyance. Just a half hour with her and he could go down for breaking and entering, accessory to murder, and pissing off the British government.
“Do be scientific. If a person is unconscious they’re unconscious. You can’t wake them up with a kiss anymore than you can with a pin prick. And John’s basically comatose,” he declares with a dismissive turn of hand, then rests his chin on it again and spins through the rest of Mycroft’s daily fabrications.
"Comparing him to Hitler is a bit much."
"Killing all those people in the same fashion he did and leaving them for him to find was a means of psychological torture," the words sit heavily in the room, eliciting sheer incomprehension and disbelief.
? Really?” John asks, bemusedly irritated, “When did you decide on that? In the four hours I went to work?” He asks with lofty, casual pleasantness.
Then her hand starts to migrate upward.

that she can design Mary’s assassination, without Sherlock finding out.

So you all have no idea what's happening, but please take a moment to comment or leave kudos for your writer and we will get back to this cliffhanger soon.
The smile is no longer present on her face and he recognizes hers as the look of the woman who would kill all those people. "Yes, I'm well aware," she says boredly, "I was there."
“Oh, don’t be like that John. We brought take out, Sherlock,” Mary appears in the doorframe, next to John, and lifts up Chinese for him.
Sherlock’s gaze is directed ahead at the drawn curtains over John’s shoulder that dim the flat, and John is face to face with the necktie Sherlock isn’t wearing. He feels his eyes meander upward toward Sherlock’s, by gravity and not by design, he argues antagonistically to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
"John," he chokes, voice paralleling the grief of his friend, fingers in traction against the back of his shirt. Sherlock presses his forehead against him, nudges, nuzzles, cuddles him, tries anything he can to curb the pain with tenderness and urgency of contact. John clutches his pounding head, the heel of his palm pressing into his eye socket, and sobs uncontrollably, mouth clenched closed, the depths chest reverberating with each choke of pain.
Sherlock's phone chimes and he looks down at the screen, relaying a text from Lestrade with details of the latest body to drop. Sherlock gets up to retrieve his coat from the hanger, tossing it over his shoulders.
"No, what did she do to
"Why are you doing this?"
. If she has any sense she'll kill him right now. And it's not as though she doesn't know how.
"Rest assured, Mr. Holmes, I will, or at least, you'll want me to, once I'm done with you. As you've already been made aware, I don't kill anyone without first giving them what's due. And I have something else in mind for you," she says.That wasn't good enough. Anderson would probably write it off as roleplay or something equally stupid. Feeling ill at the words, he retracts, the floor slanting on its axis. What does she intend to do exactly? She can't be keeping him alive just to have sex with him... can she?
“Uh…” Nigel remains seated for a moment, looking dumbfounded and little ragged around the edges, before he scrambles to his feet and follows John toward the examination rooms.
“John.”
I'm ransoming the next chap (which is the beginning) for 10 kudos. Or a comment- 2 comments and it's yours. It's more case-ficy but at least explains why Irene goes around killing and raping ppl and how he catches her (or how she catches him?). Also since people were curious, I might be able to fit in the night of the incident, but that might need to be it's own chapter. will see...
He watches as the piece falls over, the imagery of forfeit happening right before his eyes.
"Well I'm certainly not easy-" he starts to say, defiant. But he checks himself and remembers that he's actually
“Yeah. I… gathered,” she says then blinks up at him, “But why is he here? Like what’s his point?”
“If it were I wouldn’t be here.”
Rather than fend off her slights, he turns the conversation on its head and takes to resuming the interrogation he didn’t get the chance to finish the other night (which admittedly, hadn’t gone according to plan.)
The second time seeing him like this isn't any easier. He'd been dreading it the whole week, putting it off, avoiding it, distracting himself with work. But the pain and horror and shame spring up fresh the moment he lays eyes on him, like it's happening all over again.
"Indeed, how?" she asks, mock-pondering the question, "I imagine it must blast a large, gaping hole in your theory. After all, how could a woman possibly impose her will on a man?"
"You are not hers to tamper with-" John starts to argue with the disapproval that may as well be written in paragraph format on Sherlock's face.
Yes, it's come to this. He's betting on whether Sherlock dies or lives on this episode of Sherlock's flair for the dramatic. He wasn't always like this. He was a nice man, once. "Seventy."
” the voice wants to strangle him. John wants to strangle
“I see that there is some major confusion about this that we will have to address later,” he says standing and pushing in his chair, “But right now I have to get to work, okay?” he says tersely, giving her a kiss on the head. He then grabs his keys and bag, making his exit out the door shortly after.
That was how he ended up in the Diogenes billiard room, glaring holes into the decorative, mauve curtain shielding him from view as he watched the two men converse in the lounge across the hall.
It’s a beautiful day.
He tries in vain to compartmentalize the sickening sensation when her ministrations move to his lips. "How do you think John would react to what I did to you?"
“I bet you would know exactly what I would say,” John entertains the thought, in fond memory his friend, “For my note.”
Mary looks flatly at him, unamused. Apparently he’s resorted to sarcasm, the classic form of deflection.
He remembers when he used to argue when people said things like that to him. Now it just seems stupid.
He hears the rumble in its throat break out into a growl and feels the thin ice beneath him begin to crumble. His eyelids flutter closed and in the darkness he can hear his pulse hammering against his eardrums. A little voice in the back of his head starts canting prayers, what little sanity he has left exercising its brittle grip over the mounting panic threatening to break loose.
he has a new boyfriend.”
“What do you imagine that’s like? Hearing the person you love most is dead over the phone? Pleasant you think?”
“Is this your girlfriend?” she asks, putting a hand on the shoulder of the brunette standing across from him and pointing to her.
She’s grooming him, destroying John from the inside out with slow, gentle touches, leaving him hollow and squeezed for breath. He doesn't understand what exactly it's doing to him, why he can't move, as if in shock. Then he realizes, she's caught him by the most vulnerable part possible. She’s literally crushing him by the Achilles’ heel, the tender-most spot where it hurts the absolute worst, as he stands by ignored and forced to watch. It’s so far below the belt he wouldn’t have thought such a low blow possible. She's turned torture into a bloody art form.
The quarter horse rears on its hind legs and whinnies as he approaches. Undaunted, the man pulls the two ton pound animal back down by the bridle and, with some German goading, walks it back toward the wounded soldier.
Hello, in this chapter and ensuing ones, the camera switches back and forth between two perspectives (John walking and Sherlock dancing), while also incorporating a
“Six weeks—?!” the youth stammers in shock.
“That was
"No. No way," Lestrade immediately rejects the idea, gesturing to the state of the body, "I mean just look at this, John! There's no way a woman could have done this- not without a gun or an accomplice or drugs, am I right?" he doesn't wait for John to confirm but John is somewhat inclined to agree. John's eyes travel over the mangled heap of remains, seeing multiple contusions, fractures, lacerations from a monstrous use of force, and body parts that, even with his expertise, are simply mangled beyond recognition. Between a man, a woman, and a saber-tooth tiger, he's betting it's the tiger, and probably one with a vendetta against humans.
He wiped at his wet eyes. For the first time in his life, Sherlock was sorry to have indulged in his curiosity. He swallowed around the knot in his throat and backed off from the roof’s edge, towards the safety of his bedroom.
John might not be a genius, but he is a very intelligent, savvy man. He wasn’t just making small talk at dinner, he knew very well what he was doing - he was testing his hypothesis.
Mycroft called out in despair “Mummy! Daddy! Someone, help!”
Unharmed but much colder, Sherlock resurfaced in a flurry of snow and limbs just in time to catch a glimpse of his mare galloping back down the hill and disappearing into the night.
Desperate, Mycroft turned on his heel and ran down a set of narrow steps that led to a small pebble beach below the Palace’s walls.
“Don’t run away from us, Blackbeard!”
“I’m glad no one saw that,” John mumbled, his eyes stubbornly fixed ahead even when the breathless, snow-drenched prince finally caught up with him.
Out and in. Out and in.
Sherlock smiled as the window opened further and his brother’s white blond head peeked out.
When no such instructions were heard - or anything else for that matter - Sherlock pried one eye open. Gentle morning light filled the nursery, bringing to life the warm burgundy of the tapestries on the walls and the bright greens of their canopy beds. The floor was littered with the usual assortment of wooden toys and books, as well as some plant and rock specimens Sherlock had been collecting lately. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary in the organized chaos of their room.
he reminded himself of the ultimate goal.
“A priceless necklace is missing, we must retrieve it!” he explained, making a beeline to his laptop.
John couldn't believe his eyes. An
The man ignored her and called out again. "Please, my son…!"
John yawned for a few chords before continuing in his normal tone.
“Good,” he murmured.
“-Yellowbeard set off to sea in search of the evil sea-lion,” the older prince continued. He turned gradually on his heel, describing a circle with his outstretched arms. The wave took Sherlock’s boat around the ballroom.
Sherlock screamed in frustration. Damn this Palace and damn these walls! If only he was a little higher up, he could see over the tower...
John’s displeased grumble sent the prince into a fit of giggles, which he quickly reigned in under his companion’s reproachful stare.
Sherlock ignored the sudden uproar from the crowd and hurried along the bridge to finally reach the town square.
“I want to figure out what happened to Mr Powers as a gesture of good will, as it were,” Mycroft continued, “If we solve this case, the current Gaulian Prime Minister may be persuaded to attend the coronation. We’ll be able to discuss a new trade deal during the celebrations.”
Sherlock stood up and gasped. “Our enemy! Take out your
The window washer gave the prince a shrewd smile and disappeared under the roof’s edge. “What do you 'ave to lose?” he asked, already out of view.
Please enjoy.
All the better, Sherlock thought with a sigh. He really didn’t feel like getting up today. His head felt funny - a bit empty, like his brain was sloshing around in his head. Maybe he was sick? He raised his hand to his forehead, like he’d seen Mrs Turner and his mother do when he had a fever, but recoiled with a yelp when he touched a painful bump above his right eyebrow. He prodded the tender bruise with his fingers, trying to remember when and where he had bumped his head. When nothing came to mind he went through the previous day's events, like Mycroft had taught him to do whenever he lost something. He had woken up, had breakfast, had his lessons like usual... Then, after dinner, he had played outside with Mycroft - no, inside… Or had they played before dinner? They had played pirates, no, detectives…
“Next thing I know, I was all alone in the mountain, next to a wonderful ice castle. Oh, you should see it, Sherlock. The most wonderful piece of real estate ever built! Such a magnificent frontage, south-facing, lots of light. I tried to take a peek inside, but all the doors and windows were closed. Pity… I was willing to make an offer for it,” she lamented. “So, I walked down the mountain to see if I could find any other buildings for sale…”

Let’s go back to the boys on

The growing sound of marching boots took Sherlock’s attention from the mirror to his window. Looking down he could see the Palace Guards slowly pouring into the courtyard in preparation to open the Palace’s gates. Even though he couldn’t see beyond the walls, Sherlock could make out the faint noise of the crowd gathering outside, laughing and singing, ready to step through the long closed gates and cheer for their future king.
Sherlock held the object against the sunlight. Inside the clear glass he could see a small portion of a crystalline powder, white like fresh fallen snow.
Mycroft grumbled and turned away from his sibling’s voice. He hid his face in his down pillow and sighed deeply. Everything was warm and comfortable. Perfect.
and links to it.
You can sense John’s excitement as he describes the case. He is settling in into his role as a blogger and he is a bit proud of his work.
“It’s about him
, like everyone is treating it, like Sherlock is treating it, like John himself is treating it. Spending the decades taking care of you, then taking care of your child, is not something a
“That was all you needed to say,” Sherlock says, turning around once finished. He leans against the counter, wiping his hands with a checkered kitchen towel.
“You’re liable to get yourself killed without me,” John mutters under his breath, glowering his thinly-disguised envy out the window.
"Absolutely not," he says in clipped tones, having unilaterally decided the topic warrants no further discussion, and stalks off toward the foyer.
“I want you to take me in for all that, like you tried to do before- remember? I’ll give you whatever you need, please just take me in,” the elder pleads.
“So, shall we go look around for murder?” Sherlock proposes, naturally.
"Shut up!" he yells at him. Under the overhead lights he cuts a dark and indignant silhouette with shoulders quaking in rage, commanding a don't-push-me-or-I-swear-I'll-smack-you voice that rings from the walls. He's not liking having Sherlock throwing a searchlight on the guilt he's been trying so hard to ignore. But when Sherlock's jaw wires shut at the ultimatum and all he can do is glare his dissent, John realizes the silent accusations are so much worse than the verbal ones.
“Perhaps Wiggins could tell us,” Sherlock says brilliantly.
John is standing in the archway a few paces away, leaning languidly against his good shoulder with a champagne glass in the opposite hand. His head is tilted into the doorframe in contemplation, one hand sheathed in a pocket, one leg crossed over the other comfortably. He’s watching them idly, distantly, like a father might watch from a distance as his children unwrap their gifts on Christmas eve. He looks picturesque, dignified, and just a touch devious with the violent burgundy of his vest contrasting against flaxen blonde hair.
Donning his blazer, John plods down the staircase and strides into the living room with a child in tow, skipping at his heels. John takes notice of Sherlock, lounging supine on the settee with his fingers steepled under his chin and staring at his latest object of fascination, the ceiling.
liar. At this rate, he might as well be getting some.
He stands by the tableside, the satin outline of his shoulders like a drawn archer’s bow, head thrown backward at the sky and imploring that it come crashing in an open display of the immense, unknowable suffering it is to be a drama queen.
by your offspring’s behavior, I’m just pointing out a major transgression on its part.”
It really is a beautiful day.
“Damn it, why? Why are you so obsessed with her?" John says in a temper, unable to understand why Sherlock keeps insisting on solving this case with a blanket disregard for the damage he's doing. In fact he seems to be intent on causing as much damage as is possible, which John thinks is beginning to constitute a pathological pattern, with all the self-destructive tendencies from the drugs to the not eating to the actively searching out of homicidal maniacs.
Suddenly human jerks to sitting and brunet jolts up startled. As it hacks away, coughing up fluid, the brunet’s expression reverts from a state of shock to that of annoyance. He looks back at the sea, his tail flapping impatiently, considering re-drowning the human.
“Here,” he settles for instead, shoving a mug of tea in his hand before it grows cold again in an obvious effort to save face and distract from his embarrassing display of incoherence. He still can’t stop thinking about it though as he sips his own tea, ill at ease with the fact that she's at that very moment walking around scot-free, maybe even looking for her next victim. That is, if she's even done with Sherlock, which for reasons he can't explain, feels a lot like wishful thinking.
"And here I was under the impression you didn't like dead bodies," he can't help but taunting. It comes to his attention what space there is between them is quickly disappearing. She's leaned forward so much so they are only a breath apart, though Sherlock makes no motion forward or away.
Mary realizes Sherlock isn't actually bad at dramatization. It’s because the whole recitation is dripping with so much satire that it sounds faux and awful.
He retracts without another word and soundlessly turns on his heel. "I can't imagine what you need me for, then," he says simply with a sweep of coat as he makes to the door. He's all grace and smoothness in spite of John's accusations, but John can see the invisible injuries he's made leeching out of him.
Mary: That would be good. You could do that.
“Oh, I’ve got it,” John says, walking over and taking a seat on the roller stool for a lower vantage point. John can readily see the boy's shoulders are misaligned and has already formulated a diagnosis, but he lifts his shirt for him so he can take a look anyway.
” he exclaims exasperatedly, shaking his head. He pushes the buzzer, now sure of himself. The entrance unlocks.
“I think…” Sherlock trails as John’s eyes make their way in small, shy increments, up to his. “…you’re mistaken.” He says, his voice is too silver and the smile on his lips too sinful, there’s practically a warning label typeset on his face, but John unfortunately is too much a sucker for handsome sociopaths not to eat it up, complacently pliant under those intoxicating, snake-charmer eyes.
SHERLOCK: I'M NOT SHALLOW. I SIMPLY DO NOT INDULGE IN THE DELUSIONAL IMPORTANCE OTHERS ATTRIBUTE TO THEIR EMOTIONS.
As he treads water, his eyelids sagging with oxygen depletion, something brushes his foot. He doesn’t know whether he hopes it’s the monster or a shark. Preferably a small fish, but he can tell that’s not likely the case from the amount of water it displaced.
wouldn't show. With the recent developments in the case, she had to know he'd be looking for her, thus making his motives suspect. She had a propensity for reading through him that was unmatched- yet somehow she didn't see past his odd timing for suddenly taking her up on her offer for dinner? Not that he was going to complain.
But the air stands still once he realizes exactly whom he’s addressing.
“Come to bed,” Sherlock’s voice mutters into the nape of his neck.
“Does Sherlock Holmes live here?” he rasps, unable to catch his breath, “Please, I need to speak to him-“
At any rate, this was only part one of the epilogue to The Way I Danced with You. It's one scene but so longggg. Why it has to be, I wish I knew. DXX Below is John's Listerine/mint usage. Take a gander.
“Kids make mistakes, Sherlock. Breathe.”
“It’s better if she doesn’t know,” Sherlock states tonelessly.
daughter?
Mary’s voice is bubbly as though she’s resisting the urge to laugh at his ridiculousness.
Sherlock senses he’s pushed John a little too far and stops talking. John remains painstakingly quiet. Eventually Sherlock feels the need to console him.
The calm before the storm.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” Molly interrupts, just as Sherlock is about to completely lose his temper and start dumping bodies in the furnace.
“I’m sorry,” John says softly, “I didn’t know. I didn’t hear anything.”
"What is that supposed to mean?"
4. YOU’VE JUST HURT SOMEONE’S FEELINGS.
“Your dad isn’t coming?” he asks.
“You’ll have to forgive me,” he digresses, rising from his chair, “if the popularized excuse for acting stupid called love is not a notion I subscribe to. There is, after all, a reason why he calls me a
"Did you put down Sherlock's dog?" John asks Mycroft, breaking the silence.
“Why? Why are you doing this? Would you at least talk to me? What have I done to piss you off this much?”
of it never having occurred to him as even possible. Sherlock just went from being ridiculous to absurd in 5 seconds flat.
He scales down the steps toward the light beaconing from the bottom floor, his footsteps echoing against the steel stairs. He finds Eurus in her cell, trher Stradivarius until she suddenly stops mid-score.
"Mycroft had me design it as a child. In exchange he gave me a violin,” she offers, as some kind of explanation.
JOHN: YES, HIS.. WHEREABOUTS.
“Good.”
"Photos of the men Oscar Sorace supposedly raped and murdered," he interrupts when the intense eye contact starts to deter from the point of the meeting. He twists the file back to her and turns to a particular image where the killer's signature is visible, though she's pointedly looking not at the file but at him, "He sews his name into their necks, a detail that was never released to the press, so it had to be him as opposed to a copy cat, so the Yard reasons," he's saying, his voice growing quieter as she grows closer.
“Well, she has a point,” Sherlock confesses, “I seem to be fulfilling the job description without having been granted the title.”
Now she's literally just saying things to get a rise out of him. He glares at the thinly-veiled sarcasm, irritation festering inside him at how that is exactly what's happening. No one believes him. Bureaucratic pressures have culminated in rendering her untouchable. She smiles with satisfaction when his hands tighten almost imperceptibly at his sides at her behest, having struck a nerve. He clenches his jaw, not sharing in her amusement.
“That’s exactly what it means.”
An inexplicable, irrational feeling of dread takes root in John's chest. Then his eyes migrate down Sherlock to his gloved hands, which confirm his worst fears.
“I didn’t want you to see me like this," John says.
“-About that,” he corrects her. He is now in stark contrast to the self-pitying Shakespearean character he was playing earlier, donning the identity of his natural self, detached and perhaps a bit ruthless in his general lack of feeling.
The sickening realization occurs to him how the tables have turned, how she has him exactly where she wants him, how in one fell swoop the odds have been evened. She'd never intended to walk into Scotland Yard and divulge the details of her crimes.
After flipping through series of gory case files, one after another, Sherlock abandons the stack of paper on the desk and recedes introspectively into himself. The rain has receded into a misty drizzle and traffic is in a midsummer morning lull. He notices a familiar license plate that's trucking back to Greater London at its usual time of day, followed by an industrial district worker going to take the tube to their noisy flat that affords them no sleep, followed by a motorcyclist who's not looking forward to having a conversation with his boyfriend about how he might have run over their cat.
“What is it the lot of us fools say?” he remarks boredly at the window pane, still running with rain, “Ignorance is bliss.” He almost looks depressed. “Or at least better than tearing your mind to pieces.”
But instead of becoming roadkill, John swoops down and wraps his arms around him, throwing him over his shoulder. Both of them fall deathly silent, taking a moment to process what has occurred. The surprise of being able to lift Sherlock clean off the ground snaps John out of the blind, unthinking rage that had originally prompted him to resort to such drastic measures. His intention had been to prove to Sherlock that he is well past underweight and borderline emaciated. He hadn’t necessarily expected it to work- or be this easy.
Is it possible that his mind is really so brittle, literally at the mercy of one fatal pressure point? To imagine that he could be so shaken by something so innocuous as a brushing of fingers or a touch on the leg.
“Sherlock, shut up,” he chirps with a carefully delineated margin of tolerance, but the damage is done. Mary is looking at John in abject horror.
John sighs and pockets his mobile, chiding himself for getting worked up over his flatmate's whereabouts. He stares at the carpet as if it were culpable for all the inhumanity and wrongdoing in the world, pondering over the detective and what may have him otherwise occupied. When he realizes that he’s actually sulking, he shakes his head, grabs his blazer and heads out of the conference room. A few public school truants blink and giggle at how underdressed he is given the posh standards of the club and wonder if perhaps he and his knock off rain coat are lost, but he pays no heed.
John’s eyes snap open and he bolts up, finding himself on a boulder jutting out of the water. His shoulder burns with tenderness and his hand reflexively grips the source of the pain. He grimaces, leaning his head back against the rock with a deep, disgruntled sigh.
Mycroft casts him a knowing glance. “It would seem my brother has gotten himself entangled in a case a little over his head," he says in a soothing voice. John is too aggravated not to accept his consolation or contest it, as he normally would.
“You’re another person,” it chimes in faux, exaggerated relief, and John’s throat tightens in recognition of his own words, “Oh thank God!”
“Exactly. I’m ten years old. You have a ten-year-old child with him.”
would be the body. He watches it contemplating it— deliberating his fate— entertaining the idea of tearing him into unrecognizable bits and pieces, which it has all the power to do. He watches it wrestling with itself, unable to resist the temptation, growing more impatient as time ticks and the odds stack against him.
3. DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE A LOT WHEN YOU WERE A KID?
There’s that settled, serene calm again, hard in his veins, the stilling of his heartbeat he does instinctively when he’s about to pull the trigger. And he turns around. Looking over his shoulder, the entrance to the pathological department is gaping wide open, waiting for him. He smiles with a cold familiarity at the building front, it’s never-changing, preserved stone face.
“Oh come on, you don’t have to be shy John Hamish Watson,” she says, pulling him to his feet. She read his clipboard. She knows exactly what buttons to press. “It’s two tube stops over on the Central line. No one will miss us.”
John hears that and immediately looks peeved. He breathes an exhale, pinching the bridge of his nose and taking a moment.
“It's overcast. I’m inclined to say we picked a rather bad day." Sherlock looks vaguey intrigued, like he's detected a blip on some sort of imaginary radar he's got going. He ventures a sidelong look at John,  face blank and eyebrows risen in mild curiosity.
“I couldn’t. The lady said she wanted to see my ID. So now he’s sulky.”
"Don't be melodramatic-" he says dismissively, but instead of letting Sherlock push him out of the way, John pushes back, pushes him so hard he falls backward against the hardwood.
He makes his way to the kitchen and sees that not only has the tea been over-steeped, but has now long grown cold. John starts the stove and sets the kettle on, counting the steps the detective takes in the room adjacent. He can't stand the idea of living with this and not doing anything about it. But then he thinks of the scathing look of betrayal Sherlock had on his face all from the mere mention of Mycroft. It was horrible, unlike anything he'd ever seen or ever wanted to see directed at him.. not from Sherlock. He sighs and cards a hand through his hair, watching the tea brew. Eventually John gives in and pours a second cup of mighty leaf, making his way from the kitchen down the corridor to his room.
Rose follows in thoughtful silence, then says, "Maybe he was so egomaniacal he thought he couldn't get killed."
“I don’t know what you mean,” he replies tersely, buttoning his collar so that he’s his prim and proper self again. He’s cold in the extreme, icy even, pointedly composed so as to betray no weakness.
“Please don’t,” John demands, failing to see whats so funny. Is he irrational? Is he paranoid? Or is the joke on him? Is there another fourth or fifth or sixteenth wall?
Sherlock relocates to the windowsill, crossing his arms and gazing down onto Baker Street, the breeze shifting in the curtains.
“No I meant the cadaver,” she replies in what might be sarcasm, but Sherlock has never really had an ear for these things. It’s unlikely she’s asking the cadaver. It’s sliced in parts and freeze dried in the freezer. Also, John doesn’t really have a thing for cadavers. Sherlock on the other hand—
“Uhuh.”
He seats himself back down beside Sherlock, so he doesn’t have to endure Sherlock’s sex stares a moment longer. Mary is on his right at the head of the table. Sherlock is playing with his food. John is rubbing his temple, staring at Sherlock play with his food. Sherlock smirks at the irate look on John’s face as he spirals his fork into noodles. John sourly regrets switching, because this side of the table is so much worse.
“Yeah, come on, you’re alright,” he assures him, still repressing laughter as he pulls the sleuth up by the upper arm, “We’re going now.” He retrieves the little monster off the sofa, which kisses him on the nose, “You were good, weren’t you?”
Mary: Yeah.
He gets the clearance as Mycroft promised. They want his fingerprints and retinal scans and other strange biometrics he doesn't question. After a few days he manages to work up the courage to set foot into that locked-down fortress where people rarely walk in and even less frequently walk out.
“And you,” he turns at Sherlock, “You just stood there and let it happen
After a few days, John starts aching to see him again, even if he's still and motionless in death. Going to Ministry of Defense Cryogenics Laboratory is, as always, painful reminder of what happened, yet he finds he can't stop himself from going, as painful as it is. When he returns to that frost-laden room, he stays by Sherlock's side for a stretch of time, when eventually Mycroft joins him.
She releases an exasperated laugh. "That mind of yours never stops working does it?"
. John, somehow, inexplicably, has managed to get under his skin in a way she cannot, in a way he's never seen anyone or anything manage to do. Why he is an exception in harder to suss out.
He glances over at John, pensive. “Magical pixy horses,” he decides is a good answer.
Somehow, at the man's behest, the soldier manages to hook his foot into the stirrup and mount the horse, which then obediently follows after the keeper of its reins.
He stops himself before he gets too worked up. He turns away and runs a hand through his hair, trying to recollect himself.
This one gets me everytime.
“Like you’re made of glass.”
John stops in his tracks. He turns back partway, then haults, paused in the middle of the room. Then he turns his head, and leaves, through the front door and down the staircase.
Posting this so you have an update while I work on the climax- which is still in progress but getting there!
"What exactly makes you think
He give up halfway through the pile and tosses it all under the hearth, generating a cathartic explosion of flame (some of them might have been cheques).
“He’s incapacitated Mrs. Hudson what is it?” Sherlock asks in an almost patient voice.
Martin gives him a irked expression as the director signals them to come over. "Look I just fought with my wife for 6 hours on this," he sighs tiredly, "Don't make me regret it."
"Maybe you just drive women crazy," he thinks aloud, realizing he just interrupted as an after thought. The melody stops.
John's fingers trace up Sherlock's palm, to his wrist. He stalls there, not prying under the cuff of his shirt to see the bandages he wrapped around his raw wrists earlier that morning. He lingers over the wound, hesitating. He is loathe to ruin the moment, having come to treasure these rare occasions when Sherlock isn't working a case or getting high, when he's not slipping through his fingers, when he's really there and even seems
“Exactly. So.. how else could I have been born?”
Suddenly what she did doesn't seem so far of a stretch or unbelievable. When at the tender age of six one witnesses their father kill their mother, it's bound to change a person into something... else. That and the sheer feeling of powerlessness-
While John was sleeping soundly last night, assuming Sherlock was being “normal” and getting laid, had he actually been— John forces that train of thought to a stop. He feels like he’s about to lose it. Was this something he could have stopped, had he been less stupid?
Sherlock’s voice replies dogmatically.
” Sherlock thunders from the kitchen, and John sighs, lifting his listless eyes from the page. Sherlock storms into their humble commonspace like a whirlwind, looking indignant with his shirt collar button strained and eyes vibrant, violent green. “Where in God’s name—“
Lestrade looks like Sherlock is trying to convince him the elves did it. "And she did all that, instead of switching his meds or killing him herself- why?"
“You sold the show? To
," he says passive aggressively, crossing his arms.
JOHN: NO. WELL, I MEAN, I HAVE BEFORE, BUT IT’S NOT A HABIT. I‘VE LIED SOMETHING LIKE FOUR TIMES? BUT I SAVED A FEW LIVES IN THE PROCESS.
Only a few strokes from the oasis of dry land, a hand wraps around his foot and his eyes light up with confusion. He’s drawn underwater a few feet again, muscle-memory of the recent sensation of drowning inducing a feeling of dread.
“How’s school going? Mary told me you’re into football,” John turns back at him with an affable smile, “That’s not what put you’re here is it?”
It’s obvious from his reaction that no one has ever done that to him before. He blushes like a virgin would, or rather, like the virgin he obviously is, John is forced to admit. It's unmistakable. The realization burns like acid in John's veins, making everything she's doing that much worse.
Lestrade sighs, threads his fingers together and puts on a diplomatic face. "Let's say the DNA checks out and they're related. The way I see it there are two possibilities. One, some woman's father, a known murderer, does what he does best and kills a lot of people or, two, said woman takes her father's MO and goes on a killing spree in order to terrorize him into an early grave and then frames him for it. Do you think you might, possibly, be reading too much into this? He has a known track record and she..." he types her name into the criminal record database, which, as expected, comes up blank, "we don't have her for anything."
“—Juvenile school-dance,” Sherlock stops and then starts, “Romantic?” he blinks, that look on his face that says he’s processing a thousand and nine hundred ninety nine split-brain thoughts per second, then tips over to two-thousand, and gets frozen. But John doesn’t have time to piece together he actually said that out loud because he’s too puzzled by what Sherlock said.
Skipping over the respective data files on Ajay Farhad, Gabriel Lange, and Rose Morstan, he finds the file for Alexander Ivanov, head of operations. He scans over the material under his name, which appears to be a rap sheet meant for collateral, when he comes across his picture. He stills, eyes glued to the screen, searching his face.
"Because they're
“So dad.”
He had been there for an all-together different, more sinister reason— His object had been to put a bullet in the deceased's brain from the get-go. He should have left Sherlock for dead, had he not mentioned Mary’s name. That alone was compelling enough to make him pull him out the water.
"That was an order, detective?" he says impatiently. Donovan nods and leaves.
Like the beautiful, beautiful day that it is.
"Sherlock-" John chides him, capturing his arm, his silk dressing gown smooth and slippery beneath his fingers. His interception immediately has the brunet whirling around in a temper.
"You're blaming me?"
After the flood of terror has subsided, he can feel himself still breathing.
“If I were in love with him, might I not say something like O brawling love, O loving hate, O any thing, of nothing first create,” he starts reciting Shakespeare. Mary considers throwing in the towel.
Sherlock bristles, irked. His mind is moving at a much faster pace than the situation will allow- already out the door and down the steps. He's not liking having his plans delayed by John being unusually stubborn, with the arms crossed, and the haughty look he takes to mean the soldier is not going to budge. "She killed all those men, Sherlock, singled handed-"
His temper flares as she stands casually in front of him, direct evidence to the contrary and yet feigning ignorance, as if what she did to him had never happened.
“PG, parental guidance PG?”
"On to better and brighter things," the screenwriter smiles.
"Why do you have to be so difficult?" John demands, his voice strained, cracking with the desire to reach out and hold him, grab him, ground him. John hates it when Sherlock reflexively pushes him away like this, keeping him at arm's length. His hands are tied, barred from helping him, which is its own kind of torture, making him feel unduly frustrated and helpless and sometimes like he very nearly wants to tear him to pieces.
that-" John does a sharp intake, not entirely prepared for shock brought on by his own words. "
"No I don't. Feel free to explain it to me John, why you saw fit to sabotage everything-" The sleuth zigzags in front of him in a temperamental fume, whirling about tempestuously. John hates how he does that. He hates everything about him. He hates how in spite of the baleful wind he can still feel him giving off warmth, heat rolling off his body in soft, molten waves. He hates how he has to watch him dart in front of him like he's taunting him, and how hair-pullingly insufferable it is that he still manages to stir John's deepest, darkest wants when he's being this obnoxious.
John’s gaze slides over to meet Sherlock’s again and he smiles tightly in a way that says
,” it says haughtily.
He’s begun to feel the effects of delirium after being submerged underwater past the two-minute mark. There’s the recurring feeling he’s losing his grip of reality, that his mind is slipping away. His vision is eclipsed at the corners, zeroing in on the distortions of light dancing across the surface. Everything is losing its vividness. His memory starts to loop, trying to remember what it was he was reaching for. In the moments he does remember, it always seems to evade his grasp, falling just out of reach because of some move his assailant makes to overpower him. As he gasps for air, he finds himself coking on water instead, his fingers trying to pry away the strangle hold around his neck.
John suddenly grabs him by the shirt and backs him against the wall so that his head clunks against it just hard enough to smart unpleasantly. "Is this just transport too?" John demands. He is looking at him fiercely, expecting an answer.
She tries dangling the carrot closer to his nose. "All you have to say is yes." He opens his mouth but no words come out. His expression is really quite priceless, every inch of him struggling, and despite it all, he's still trying to pretend he isn't.
“Sure. Quit being Sherlock. Watch the world implode.” Benedict cringes at that.
“Yeah, man. I already wrote the script. We even have a new premise and everything, check it out.”
He leads the horse back toward the destroyed remains of Loos, now in shambles and uninhabited with the exclusion of perhaps few vagrant ghosts. The trek is barren and soundless and he feels himself starting to flag, the corners of his vision going dark. The last thing he remembers is the cape on the man's shoulders billowing in the breeze and the soft touch of the chestnut's mane against his cheek.
John is currently employing a scare tactic that Sherlock likes to call
5 years later…
The stark lighting somehow manages to enhance his impossibly gaunt frame and hollow out his cheekbones even more, his satin dressing gown giving off an unnatural, cold lustre against his pale skin. John could've easily mistaken the whole set-up for a scene out of
Mary looks surprised with him when he finally gets to the end of the sentence.
"Well.." Mycroft sighs, exhaling a cloud of smoke, "Not entirely. That was originally the reason we brought him here. We thought we could convince Eurus to bring him back-- But she was very much against it and instead tried to incinerate the body."
Then painstakingy, he admits, "In a way, she's... got me too." John looks aghast.
“Good morning John,” Sherlock beams, suddenly sunny in disposition. Mary blinks at John from over Sherlock’s shoulder miraculously.
Sherlock's gaze inches back to Mary, blip confirmed. Mary rubs her temple tiredly at the transparently immature and antagonistic subtext.
“Do you deal weed?” Nigel hazards a guess.
John swallows and checks whatever ridiculous expression he must be wearing on his face. He knows. Of course he knows. He'd always suspected Sherlock dressed himself with the intention of one-uping everyone in the room, but now he's not so sure. Compared to the sight of him now, its almost as if he hadn't really been trying.
John grins. So he wants to play it that way. Perfect. He practically
in front of you,” he reels vehemently. It is one of those rare occasions where Sherlock seems to be at a loss for a witty response, or, in fact, any response at all.
, Sherlock turns back and carries on with the tune.
4. ARE YOU A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR?
John is speechless, mouth open but no words coming to his defense, those eyes, the very same ones that would so often look at him like he's the only person on the planet, now looking at him like he wouldn't think twice about handing him a verdict for capital punishment.
The guard cleared his throat, trying to regain his composure. “Begging your pardon, your Highness," he said, “even if that’s true, I don’t see how a pickpocket should concern you... or me.”
are posted on the same day. Looking at what John wrote and the timestamps on the comments, I would say that John posted both entries on the afternoon of the 23rd of March, after they found the body of Eddie Van Coon.
Sherlock thought as he crouched behind the vase.
” Jim sang with some effort as he strained over the balcony to hold Sherlock’s weight.
“Oh, for God’s sake!”
“Admit it, this is your doing,” the King continued despite his wife’s sounds of protest. “He was born like this, ice cold. Contaminated by a frozen heart, that’s the only possible explanation-”
Billy pointed his finger tentatively at the space between Sherlock and the chimney and the prince tilted his head in assent.
Sherlock finally reached the cape and pulled it free, dislodging another flurry of snow. He smiled triumphantly at his prize before slinging it over one shoulder and making his way back down.
,” Sherlock added with a bright smile, and opened his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
, Sherlock conceded,
Sherlock's heart constricted in his chest at the sight the birds. He sang a bit more quietly to avoid disturbing the animals.
Sherlock put his hands on his hips and declared, “Do not worry, Mrs Hudson, I will bring that evil
“I don’t know.”
“Wait!” Sherlock called out.
Angelo’s happy expression faltered for a moment before returning with another offering, “Then, please, choose whatever you want from the store. It’s yours, free of charge!” he motioned towards the packed shelves.
Sherlock ducked his head to hide his smile at the obvious ploy. “Ugh, you’ve convinced me,” he conceded. “In fact, I could use your help.”
Sherlock gave silent praise to John’s ability to adapt to his flatmate’s idiosyncrasies. The doctor's only response to the scene was to halt by the door and raise a questioning eyebrow.
Jim held his higher notes in a clear tenor while Sherlock found different notes with his rich baritone, playing with the harmony of the duet.
As always, lots of love to my beta, @carmillacarmine! Thank you so much<3
To his horror, Mycroft felt the tingling of magic in his palms before another blast of energy shot from his hands and hit the staircase, covering the marble in frost. The force of the impact knocked the Ambassador and the guards on their backs, making the townspeople cry out in shock. Mycroft remained transfixed as the people around him screamed and ran, amassing by the gates, desperate to flee. He felt his life crumbling around him, its destruction telegraphed on the panicked footsteps of his people and on the bodies laying on the staircase.
Bill stood up from the table with a smile. “So are you. Now finish your porridge and go set the tables. I’ll go wake up the men.”
They let themselves still for a few moments, watching as their breaths condensed into white puffs and disappeared into the air.
The man’s features were suddenly clouded by a look of deep embarrassment. “Where are my manners?” he cried out, before bowing deeply in formal introduction. “Prince James, of the Éiren Isles.”
After washing and shaving, Sherlock dressed himself with the utmost care. Adjusting his cravat and straightening his cuffs, the prince took a deep breath and stepped in front of the mirror.
“No, it’s alright,” Sherlock assured him, still feeling a bit dazed, “I didn’t see you either.”
Mycroft let out a weary sigh at the display, motioning to the guards who had gathered around them. “Oh for God’s sake… Take him away,” he pointed at the prisoner.
This is one of the entries that have been changed (again, does anyone know if there is a saved version of the deleted posts?).
“Never… But not for lack of trying.” he said, resting his elbows on his bent knees. “The guards are always expecting me whenever I try to get out. It’s like they know what I'm going to do…” Sherlock would not admit it to his new-found acquaintance, but he had the nagging suspicion Mycroft was watching him, somehow, and that he kept tipping off the guards whenever he devised an escape plan.
he ordered.
Mycroft scowled at the memory. No, he had failed and now he must pay his dues. If he was still a king, this was his kingdom now, the only one he was fit to rule over. Endless expanses of snow and stone, with only the howling wind for company. He would rule over it until the ice claimed him at last.
Mycroft pushed his sleeves back down with a smug smile. “If you liked that, wait until you see this!”
As the wonderful
This one is just precious. This post marks the beginning of a side story about Mrs Hudson and new technologies that will carry on in the next posts.
“Wait! I’m setting the stage.” Mycroft scolded.
Sherlock faced the ice harvester with his own indignant glare. “Jim is not just
Sherlock pushed his back against the door, closing it with a slam. He heaved a great sigh and rested his head against the wood, unable to slide down into a sitting position for the stiffness of his legs.
Sherlock smiled to himself as John rattled on.
Sherlock was rushing to stand back up when he heard a terrible crash behind him. His blood drained from his face at the sound.
“Me and my partner, Prince James of the Éiren Isles.”
"Perfect!" Ella gave a little wiggle of delight. "I can’t wait to introduce you to everyone."
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he pushed through the shrubbery to reach the side of a small, frozen lake. The snow was thinner on the ground around the lake, sheltered as it was by a thick barrier of weeping willows, their drooping branches glistening in the sun like delicate crystal chandeliers. The bleak winter landscape was alive with multicoloured lights, flickering softly as the chilly breeze gently pushed against the willow's branches.
The sun was halfway through its short arch when the men put down their tools to eat and rest. The ice blocks still needed to be cut to size, loaded into the cart and stored, so the men took this moment to regain their strength before continuing their arduous task.
Mycroft adjusted the heavy burgundy cloak over his shoulders, securing it with a sapphire pin.
Sherlock had made sure the suit was made to his exact specifications, and now, as he looked at himself in the bright sunshine, he was glad he had invested so much time in pestering the Royal Tailor with all of his demands. The suit was made of the finest cotton, navy blue and accented with delicately embroidered green and burgundy leaves, the colours of the Londondallian flag. Everything was trimmed with a fine gold thread that complemented the shiny brass buttons. Under the jacket, Sherlock wore a pristine white dress shirt, a white cravat with a gold pin and a dove gray vest. The look was finished with a pair of white gloves, a ceremonial sword and glossy black knee high boots that had been discreetly placed by his door while he was in the bathroom.
“Do you want to solve a murder?” Mycroft asked simply, a figure of perfect serenity if not for his tired eyes.
Mycroft, sitting at his desk, calmly lifted his eyes from the report he had been reading before it was buried under Sherlock’s paperwork.
“Of course, Mr Peterson. We’ll be glad to help,” Sherlock assured the anxious butler with a smile.
He was at the door before the papers had settled back down. Outside he found the Royal Tailor, flanked by two nervous looking footmen, who held several leather cases and a carefully folded suit. When suddenly faced with the disheveled prince, the tailor took a step back but quickly masked his surprise with a look of professional indifference.
“And you’ve also deduced the best thing to do was to go into the forest, at night, in the middle of a blizzard, by yourself.”
o… I’m waking you up!” He turned and grabbed the edge of Mycroft’s covers to pull them down “Let’
Sherlock held the man’s gaze searchingly for another moment before nodding.
The name Powers rang a bell deep within Sherlock’s ransacked Mind Palace. He sat still and closed his eyes, trying to chase the ringing back into his memory. He searched for a few moments amid the chaos until he retrieved the desired information.
Mycroft allowed himself to smile back, feeling as if a tremendous weight had come off of his shoulders. He had made it!
“Listen…” the man interrupted, raising his head. He fixed his dark blue eyes on Sherlock’s lighter ones before explaining in a softer, almost confidential tone. “We need to get you out of these wet clothes and warmed up again. Right now. Alright?”
“Why?”
His friend fixed him with a skeptical look, as serious as one could with puffy eyes and hair sticking out on the right side of his head. Sherlock looked back as innocently as he knew how.
“What happened?” Sherlock asked, leaning forward. “Why did they close the gates?”
Without preamble, Mycroft grabbed him by the arm and dragged him to the end of the Ballroom, towards a secluded area at the foot of the stage. Music filled the air once again, as the orchestra did their best to dispel the awkwardness of Sherlock’s interruption.
“Yes, it’s no problem.” he reassured her and entered the room, leaving Sherlock looking flabbergasted in the middle of the corridor.
“A present… Some chemical help, if you will,” the window washer explained when Sherlock took the offered vial. “I’m a bit of a chemist myself.” He puffed out his chest with pride.
An awkward silence filled the room when Sherlock didn’t take his leave. Mycroft raised an eyebrow in silent questioning and Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest again.
There was only one thing to do, Sherlock realized. He sat down on the driver’s seat and clutched the reins in both hands, heart lodged in his throat. “Get ready to jump, Harry!” he cried.
It’s not like duality is a theme with John, or anything.
But therein lay the rub. Despite his reputation, private clients outside the greater London area were few and far between. At least those with cases interesting enough for Sherlock to take on without raising John’s suspicions. Lestrade was also reluctant to give him the contacts of his colleagues in rural areas so he could harass them for cases. The detective was forced to wait for the right opportunity in order to continue his investigation.
The petite snow woman hurried back to the centre of the lake for a tap-dancing interlude.
“No, he’s lovely.” Sherlock mumbled, still not feeling like himself.
The woman looked around the empty space and then turned to the man. John could hear her whisper angrily at him.
He approached his trembling son with care and showed him the small box he had been holding. When Mycroft didn’t move to take the offering, the King opened it to reveal a pair of pristine white leather gloves.
A fan asked Arwel Wyn Jones about this, and the
If you are reading the blog in order, this is the first post Sherlock leaves a comment on. But if you pay attention to the time stamp, you see this is not the first time he comments. He’s probably not reading the posts in chronological order. In fact, he comments a month an a half after the case was posted.
he turned as he extended a hand towards his shorter friend.
Soon, the ice was cut and blocks began to make their way through the newly made water channels and towards the ice cart. Cutting and pulling, the harvesters worked in perfect coordination.
The hurt look on Jim's eyes was like water to the flame of his impotent rage, and the prince felt his cheeks warm with embarrassment. Too unsettled to do anything about it, Sherlock turned away from his friend and bounded up the stone steps back to the courtyard, his laboured breath escaping his lips in white puffs of air.
The guilt quietly chipping away at his sanity, John eventually gives up entirely and binds him in a hug, even as he keeps thrashing, trying to escape. He keeps pleading with him to stop, which Sherlock mindlessly ignores, fingers practically prying the floorboards from the living room floor. John buries his face in his shirt, wishing he could explain why he has to do this without having it fall on deaf ears.
The notes unravel effortlessly from Sherlock's fingertips into a canon that grows more complex as the melodies coalesce. And it becomes painfully obvious, laid out bare for him to witness, as beautiful cadences simply erupt from the keyboard with humbling and masterful dexterity-- His infraction had been much more severe than simply taking the wrong case.
“Hello,” the groom’s mother replies. She is impeccably dressed in a grey satin attire that resonates with her silver hair, sporting a high collar, sharp shoulder pads, and a knee-length skirt. “So glad you decided to show, Mary,” she smiles warmly, the forced emotion in her voice piercing to the ear, “We were worried you wouldn’t make it.”
"Where exactly do you think you're going?" he asks, with just an edge of dark humor, as if the idea of him walking anywhere of his own volition were a laughable one. The forbidding tenor of the captain's voice intimidates him, but he writes it off all the same.
