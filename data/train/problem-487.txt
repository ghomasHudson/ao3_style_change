“You can hardly blame him, John. You are one of the best. And of course you are still welcome. But for God’s sake, I don’t keep you around for your atrocious blog. You are my partner. You are as much as a consulting detective as I am. Even if my methods are superior.” Sherlock flopped himself down on the couch. “Tea, John.”
Sherlock paced around 221B furiously. How could he have been so stupid to think that John would have just been waiting for him? Why would he? Sherlock wasn’t able to contact him to even give him an indication he was alive until the last of Moriarty’s men were taken care of. He couldn’t risk anything happening to John, Mrs Husdon, or Lestrade. He had endured torture enough for a lifetime on this mission and he wasn’t going to make a mistake in the 11th hour before he was finally able to return home to John with Moriarty no long being a threat to them. John had no idea for all of this time his life was in danger and that it was down to Sherlock to keep him safe. John had no  idea about a lot of things.
Sherlock practically leapt from the cab when it finally arrived back at 221B. He tossed the driver several notes and was at the door before John could get out of the cab. John chuckled, Sherlock was acting like a kid on Christmas Day. He was hopeful about how things were going to go but one could never be sure with Sherlock, they may not actually be on the same page.  He knew that Sherlock didn't really know much about relationships. What if John messed it up by trying to push for too much.
John took a deep breath and then surprised Sherlock with a small smile. “Sherlock.” John paused after saying his name for a moment, as if not entirely sure what was about to come out of his mouth. He shocked them both when he took a few steps forward and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders in a warm embrace. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for having a terrible reaction last night. Yes it was shocking and the last thing I expected at that moment. I waited for years for some word, some action, anything that said you were still alive and it finally happened and I-I just couldn’t control myself. Sherlock, I need to understand why. I know you and this isn’t something that you would’ve undertaken lightly. I know your intention was never to cause me this much pain, but I need to understand, please.”
John put his hand up to stop Sherlock. “Not here, Sherlock.” He didn’t need to say anything else, Sherlock nodded his understanding.
John leaned forward and passionately kissed Sherlock. Trying to communicate to him that he wanted Sherlock in every capacity he was willing to give John. Sherlock matched his passion in the kiss. They stood up without ever taking their lips off of each other and somehow managed to maneuver themselves to the couch with minimal knocking things over and Sherlock having hit his shin off the coffee table.
John took a deep breath. “Of course,” he said softly. He was running through his head trying to figure out what he had done that would have upset Sherlock so much. ‘Oh God, has he figured out I’m in love with him?’ John’s stomach dropped but he waited for Sherlock to speak.
“Of course!” Sherlock exclaimed in frustration. Than realizing how what he had said could be taken, he quickly corrected himself. “No, Molly, we aren’t having sex, we are quite literally sleeping in the same bed. We both have nightmares and find comfort having each other close by.”
“Uhhh… Mrs. Hudson?” John looked concerned. No one knew about his mission except Mycroft and MI6. He was immediately worried he had somehow been compromised.
"That you had gone rogue, attacked and killed several suspects when working with the yard. And that you intervened in a crime in progress and used excessive force before Lestrade arrived. They offered you a position in MI6 in lieu of imprisonment. John, I'm sorry. I never dreamed any of this would happen."
“Given our predisposition to nightmares and our mutual desire for camaraderie in bed to stave them off, I propose we share a bed. I understand of course, you will have dates and it will not always be, uhem, logical but for the most part it would seem to resolve our problems.”
“I’m not really sure how to start so I’m just going to get to it. You see, it’s about John. I’m trying to determine his feelings for me. He hasn’t gone on a date in 6 weeks since our arrangements have changed a bit. I’ve gone over the past few weeks in my mind and I feel as though I have noticed him being more affectionate, though it’s been so subtle I can’t really be sure.”
Sherlock was not able to speak but nodded. He didn’t trust his voice not to break. He never meant for John to get hurt again. He was trying his best to make sure that John was safe. He knew that the army captain was right, a few more scars and they are finally as safe as they can be in the life they lead. The guilt weighed heavily on him regardless. He leaned back in his chair, took a large gulp of wine, and switched his focus to the fire. He just couldn’t look at his best friend right now. He was overcome with the emotions rolling over him and he didn’t know where to begin. The detective retreated into his mind palace to try to organize all the information that he had just taken in.
Sherlock shook his head. "No, he just said you were undercover abroad. Dispite badgering him, he wouldn't tell me anything more. Classified apparently."
John dropped his head in his hands. This will ruin everything. Sherlock had made it clear that he was not interested in relationships when they had first met. John had long dismissed the fact he was in love and very much attracted to Sherlock. He knew it was more than a bit not good to be in love with his best friend. If Sherlock found out that John was having feelings for him, he would ask him to leave Baker Street and that would be the end for John. He found the life he wanted with Sherlock and he wouldn’t be able to have that anymore. What would be the point going on with life if not with Sherlock? He had to find a way to bury these feelings. He was crap at hiding things from Sherlock. John was confident that he had been able to hid his feelings before because he himself wasn’t sure what the feelings were. Once he sorted that, he did his best to talk himself out of it. But now? Surely one look at his face and Sherlock will deduce the change in his feelings toward him.
“John, I still have a secret from you. One that I never thought would see the light of day but I promised I would tell you everything. Depending on your response, you may not want to return to live here.”
They both stretched a little and then sat up. The couch was definitely not the most comfortable place for a cuddle and John's shoulder was screaming at him. They exchanged goofy smiles. John stood up.
As Angelo walked back to the table carrying two delicious looking plates of food, John was saying, “To this day, I’m skeptical when you make the tea or coffee that there might be some hallucinogenic drug in there.” “It was just the once, John.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Once was enough!”
Sometime later, when Sherlock finally refocused on the room, he saw that John had fallen asleep in his chair, a book had fallen to the floor by his feet. Sherlock’s heart warmed looking at the doctor who had no doubt tried to keep himself awake. Sherlock stood, collected some pajamas from John’s bedroom before waking him.
Sherlock found himself in unfamiliar territory. He expected more of a reaction, positive or negative, from his flatmate when he learned Sherlock was alive. He didn't know how to respond to the seeming lack of response. Maybe he wasn't as affected as Sherlock believed him to be. He tried to read John but his face remained a blank slate. The men stood staring at each other, wondering if the other would start this conversation. Finally, it was Sherlock who couldn't handle the silence any longer.
When he came back, pints in hand he took a deep breath before speaking.  “To tell you the truth, I’ve been going back and forth about whether I should tell you John. I really don’t want to hurt your feelings in anyway.” John’s face obviously displayed his confusion because Greg pressed on. “His name is Mycroft and he’s… well he’s Sherlock Holmes’ manager.”
“Well statistically for your height and stature your feet should be much smaller. I would say you’re a, what? A size 9 and a half, maybe your left is slightly nearer to a 10. For someone not quite 5 foot 7 that’s considerably out of proportion.” He paused for a second, mischievous grin on his face. “Do you know what they say about men with big feet?” He put his own size 11s up on the coffee table next to John’s, wiggling his bare toes. “Big feet, large… shoes.”
He gave John a small nod, turned on his heel and walked out of the shop before John had even thought to put his arm back down.
manager? Why would you get involved with anybody associated with that man. His brother? For fuck’s sake Greg” John spat.
“I’m surprised you haven’t already picked him up and tried to bribe him into silence.” The silence on the end of the line caught Sherlock by surprise. “Ooh. You already did do that, didn’t you?” He thought about it for a moment. “What happened?”
“What do you mean actually?” John tried to sound offended, but his smile gave him away. Sherlock chuckled.
John was having a hard time stringing a sentence together, but he managed to stammer out “and how do they look on me?”
They both giggled. John stretched his arms out behind him, for a moment he considered snaking one round Sherlock’s shoulders, but instead he forced a yawn and stood up.
“Cold shower might be beneficial” Sherlock said, his voice rich with insinuation and John actually shivered. Sherlock shrugged his ruined shirt off his shoulders, picked up the jumper from beside him on the sofa and headed down the hallway. His hips almost had a wiggle when he walked. The man was a like a scientist in seduction.
“Alright Sherlock, I think we’re just about done here, you’ve got ten minutes and then we need you back for a short interview with the magazine.”
“Recently” he explained, mumbling against John’s stomach “I was given red pants to wear in a photoshoot.  I distinctly remember thinking they looked stupid and unattractive.” His words were punctuated with little kisses as he moved his mouth further down, easing John’s worries slightly. “I severely miscalculated…” Sherlock admitted, parting John’s thighs and scooting forward between them. His lips were now mouthing John’s cock through the cotton. “I hypothesised without all the facts… stupid mistake really. I didn’t take into account how red pants would look on you.” He was practically purring now, his words vibrating deliciously against John.
Her red lips broke into a devious smile as she said “Can’t a girl just turn up at her boyfriend’s hotel room unannounced anymore?”
It was getting close to five o’clock, he had already sent his only employee home as it seemed pointless to have more staff in the shop than they had had customers, and he was thinking about shutting up for the day when the bell tinkled and the door flung open. A tall man in a well-tailored crisp white shirt and black jeans walked in, texting on his mobile. His eyes were obscured by a pair of aviator Raybans but his high cheekbones and plump lips made the man instantly recognisable, even to John who had never been much into films. John cleared his throat.
Sherlock smiled to himself, it wasn’t a question he was used to. His face was always on a billboard, a gossip column or on the television. He wasn’t used to people not knowing who he was – it was oddly refreshing.
He backed into the room, still wrapped around Sherlock when he felt his legs hit the side of his bed. He made to turn around so that he could throw Sherlock onto the bed, but Sherlock was quicker. Before John had even had a chance to move, Sherlock had pushed him so that he was sitting on the edge of the bed, his bare feet still on the floor. John saw Sherlock sink to his knees in front of him. Sherlock suddenly leaned back, his eyes on John’s lap and his face looking alarmed. John felt immediately self-conscious.
“Erm… This is Sherlock. I hope you don’t mind me bringing someone Molly” John said, leaning forward to press his cheek to Molly’s, when he pulled away Sherlock saw his tongue darting out to lick his dry bottom lip nervously.
Sherlock raised his eyebrow at this and couldn’t stop a small grin reaching his face “at school? Should I be worried about that?”
“Yes these look perfect, just what I was looking for. I’ll take both of them please.” He took out his wallet and fished out a fifty pound note, placing it on the counter even though the books in combination only came to less than twenty.
“I had a really rough shift at work the next day, murder - one of the worst I’ve seen, and I didn’t feel like being alone that night. I texted Mycroft. He refused initially and I was disappointed. But then there was a knock at my door and he was just there…. He presents this front to the world like he’s cold-hearted and emotionless. I seem to be able to make him relax a bit. I have to admit I found it intriguing. Since then, well, it’s just progressed.”
“How’s Toby?” He asked sharply. The last John had heard she was seeing another nurse from the GP surgery where she worked.
To his relief, Clara was not home, John could tell the second he opened the door into his flat that she wasn’t. The flat held that unmistakably quiet and still feeling of being deserted. John glanced around the flat, thankful that he had done his breakfast washing up this morning, a stupid thing to be thankful for because he always kept the flat military neat, never left a bowl or mug unwashed and sitting on the side. Even the cardboard boxes that took up the majority of the floor room, stuffed with second hand books that had overflowed from his shop, were all labelled and neatly stacked. Clara, however, had left a scattering of magazines, her mp3 player and a bottle of nail polish on the coffee table – the only signs that this flat was lived in and was not a storage room masquerading as a living room.
Molly showed them through to the dining room, before running off to the kitchen to check on dinner. Three people were sitting around the table, glasses of wine in hand. One of the women could only be John’s sister. She had the same pleasing roundness to her face, the long dead straight hair that she flicked over her shoulder as she laughed was the same shade of dark ash blonde. She was chatting animatedly to a woman across the table, both of them unconsciously leaning towards each other. Sherlock noticed the freshly painted red nails on the dark haired woman across from John’s sister and inferred that this was clearly John’s flatmate, Clara.  Sherlock noticed the way the only other person around the table, a silver haired man, frowned slightly when he thought no one was looking at him. Just started divorce proceedings , obvious. The vivid tan line on his ring finger and the empty wine glass in front of him (the girls still had full glasses) made it a dead giveaway.
John felt flabbergasted- how on earth did he have those books in his possession? Those boxes had been sat there for ages, gathering dust whilst his bookshop was gradually dropping into more and more debt. This could buy him at least a few months’ rent on the shop… it could, he couldn’t bear to dream it, actually pay off all the loans he had taken out.
Sherlock snorted, and then added “He refused your money… that’s interesting.  He’s broke, as I’m sure you know.”
“I get nightmares sometimes” Sherlock admitted, standing up and taking a miniscule step closer to John. “Might help if I have a bit of company.”
After putting a now very drunk Greg into a cab and kissing Molly, Harry and Clara goodbye, Sherlock found himself walking with John in companionable silence. It was a nice change to be with someone who let him have time with his thoughts. Occasionally their hands brushed past each other as they walked.
“Your sister and Clara… Why aren’t they together?” Sherlock said suddenly. The thought had been bothering him all evening, he was certain he must have missed something.
He smelled her as soon as he walked through the door to the suite. Her perfume permeated the rooms, rose and jasmine with a hint of spice. She had been there no more than an hour. He pushed John sharply away from him as he heard her walk from the bedroom into the living space of the huge suite, her stilettos clattering on the shiny wooden floor.
Breaking the kiss apart, he yanked Sherlock down the corridor towards his bedroom. His fingers were scrambling to undo Sherlock’s shirt buttons, only moving away so that Sherlock could lift his jumper over his head. They both kicked off their trousers so that they were in just pants. Just as they managed to get to his bedroom, John couldn’t help himself and he pressed Sherlock against the door frame, kissing all along his jaw, standing on tip toes to nibble at his ear lobe. He was so incredibly responsive to even the lightest of touches and John had never been more aroused in his life.
“Call him, invite him over to the hotel today after your photoshoot and ask him in your own persuasive way not to speak a word of what happened yesterday” Mycroft replied.
Sherlock sat down while John went into the kitchen. He came back out holding two mugs in his hand, handing one over to Sherlock, their fingers brushed briefly as the cup was passed.
The four of them came back into the room rosy cheeked with mischievous smiles and carrying plates of food. Even if he hadn’t overheard, their eyes all glancing over at Sherlock made it obvious they had been talking about him.
“May I?” he asked kneeling on the floor in front of the sofa where Sherlock was perched. Sherlock looked down into his face and nodded, putting his hand down from his chest to rest against his thigh. John lightly ran his fingers over the mark, ignoring the warmth that was gathering in his belly at the feeling of Sherlock’s smooth chest under his feather light touch and looked more closely at the scald.
“John,” Greg whispered urgently so that the people on the next table couldn’t hear their conversation. “I really didn’t mean to hurt you like this. You are my friend, and if it hurts you that much I can cut things off with Mycroft. You had knew him for two days. I didn’t realise you had felt so strongly about him… I never meant to bring this all up again…”
The headsetted woman looked pointedly down at her watch and waved at Sherlock to follow her as she walked out the room.
His phone rang again. Picking it up he saw that it was Mycroft calling. Well, at least that solved his problem. A phone call from his brother was an immediate anaphrodisiac, the equivalent to taking a freezing cold shower.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him and said “I have a photo shoot tomorrow. I was hoping not to have third degree burns on my chest, doesn’t make for the most attractive image, but since you were a doctor when you were in… Iraq? Afghanistan? Still not sure.  Perhaps you could take a look and we might be able to avoid any permanent damage.”
“When I was at university, I spent a lot of time alone. I didn't know what it was, but I somehow didn't fit in. Then there was this boy... Jim, I met him on my drama course. He was charming and handsome and talented. I was intrigued by him. I was rehearsing a duologue with him that we were going to be performing and he had me captivated like no other actor had ever done so previously, or since. I thought I was in love with him and when he propositioned me one night I gave myself to him freely. I was a virgin, I didn't know what I was doing and it hurt like hell. I tensed up, feeling so ashamed of myself that I was letting him down. He told me I needed to relax and produced his stash of heroin, said it would calm me down. I was so desperate to please him I just went with it, let him prepare it for me to inject. I knew about heroin, I knew Jim was a user... I have to admit I'd been intrigued before, thought it would quiet my mind and here was the perfect opportunity. It became a pattern, every time we had sex, I'd shoot up first. It wasn't long before I had become addicted, both to Jim and the drug. Jim wanted sex, I couldn't have sex with him unless I was relaxed, I needed the drugs to relax. Ironically, once the heroin had taken effect it made me so uninterested in sex but would make me compliant and passive and Jim got off on that. He didn't really seem to mind that I never got much out of it, or if I was half asleep. Sometimes I was so out of it, the only proof I had that we had had sex would be the soreness I felt the next day, Jim was not exactly gentle and loving." He laughed humourlessly. "I had no money- I ended up offering myself up for the drugs... sexual favours here and there to get my hands on it. I'm not proud of it. Jim eventually realised this was an opportunity he could take advantage of. Offer me up to exchange for drugs, sell the drugs on. Perfect business deal. It went on for months... Mycroft eventually found me, passed out naked in an alley one evening and enough was enough. He took me to an std clinic - safe sex wasn't always my priority- then when my results came back clean, he checked me into a rehab facility and I managed to get off the drugs. I'd be lying if I said I'd never been tempted since, sometimes I feel so alone, my mind buzzing, racing and I crave the quietness that comes with a hit. But I have never followed through with it. I moved to New York pretty soon after I came out of the facility and didn't see Jim for years."
Either way, he had to be sure that his instinct was right. Had to be sure that he wasn’t too inherently selfish, that he was capable of thinking about someone else.
“They are using one of the smaller conference rooms next door as my dressing room. Perhaps we should talk in there.”
"Come up here, let's take this slowly. I certainly need a moment to calm down after that." John helped Sherlock up onto the bed and they lay next to each other, leg entwined and kissing tenderly.
“I offered him a very persuasive sum of money in the hope that he might keep quiet about your… indiscretions.”
John groaned but he was smiling, his cheeks rosy from good wine and good friends. “Sixth form, not school let’s be clear about that. For god’s sake Harry why did you have to bring this up?”  Harry was now shaking with laughter, pleased at how she had managed to embarrass her brother. “This makes me sound like some sort of lothario. Pathetic as it sounds, I have only slept with three people in my whole life and they just happened to be from three different continents. One of them was a girl in my class, her family were originally from Japan but she was born in Essex so I’m not entirely sure that counts as another continent. There was an American I met in a club I had gotten into with fake id, she was much older than me, I was drunk and she took me back to her flat. I was so pissed I didn’t know what I was doing. She ate me alive, it was terrifying.” He laughed a bit at the memory. “And then there was… “ he trailed off.
“Pleasure to meet you Molly” Sherlock smiled at Molly, the kind of shy smile he knew endeared him to a certain type woman. “Thinking woman’s crumpet” was a label that often got thrown around in the press when referring to him, stupid expression that made no sense, but he could tell from the way that Molly had reacted to him on her doorstep that she was one of those women. She couldn’t take her eyes off him, it was a bit disconcerting. To break the ice, he passed her the bottle of wine that John had thrust into his hands before they rang the doorbell. He wasn’t accustomed to all these social niceties, thought them pointless worth of effort, but he found that John was willing to help him, and surprisingly for John he was willing to try.
"They can be washed" John chuckled as he wrapped Sherlock up in a cuddle and they lay there together. Sherlock eventually got up and went to the bathroom, and John took the opportunity to pull back the covers and climb under the duvet. He thought he might have been too presumptuous to assume they would be sleeping in the same bed together after what had just happened because Sherlock just stood next to the bed for a while before eventually climbing in next to him. John kissed him lightly on the lips and was just drifting off to sleep when he heard Sherlock whisper into the darkness.
It was a ridiculous notion anyway. There was no way the man that had graced the pages of Vogue with the body of a Greek God, the man that had appeared on red carpets with an array of beautiful women hanging off his arm and his every word would ever be interested in John, broken rounded short plain-featured greying John. He laughed out loud at the thought and pulled himself onto his feet to set about making a cup of tea. Shaking himself into doing something that resembled normality. A nice cup of tea had always done a good job of soothing him.  The bathroom door opened as John was taking the first few sips of tea and out stepped Sherlock, John’s thin knit black jumper fitting like a second skin on his lean body.
Thinking he must be mistaken, that no way did an Oscar winning, millionaire, Hollywood superstar just walk into his tatty bookshop, John opened a new tab on his internet browser and searched “Sherlock Holmes”. He tapped his fingers nervously on the counter as hundreds of internet articles loaded in front of his eyes. Clicking on the first link, which happened to be People Magazine 100 Sexiest Men Alive, he scrolled down until he found what he was seeking. Right down at Number 4 there was a brief description and, underneath, a photo that depicted a man laying down on a bed, his arms folded behind his head, inky black curls fanned out on the pillow, a cupid’s bow that looked like it had been sculpted by God himself. John gulped; he was indistinguishable from the man who had just walked into his shop.
If he could have picked a moment to bump into his ex-wife, it wouldn’t be drinking alone in the pub looking worse for wear and like he hadn’t slept for a month, which he hadn’t. She herself had had a bit too much to drink, she was leaning her head towards him and her eyes were glinting.
Sherlock opened his mouth, looking like he was going to object when John said quickly “I’ve tried but beauty sleep unfortunately doesn’t have much effect on me… I look this tired and grumpy wherever I sleep, the bed’s wasted on me. You take it.”
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock spat through his gritted teeth. His body, which had been quivering with arousal, was now shaking with anger and panic.
“You are overreacting Mycroft, I don’t know what story you think he has to sell. I pecked the man on the lips. It’s not like I had a drug fuelled gay orgy with him at his flat” Sherlock said stubbornly.
“This is Sherlock, Sherlock this is Harry, my sister, that’s Clara and Greg” John said pointing everyone out. Sherlock saw Harry exchange a significant look with Clara. Clara immediately jumped up from the table, beaming.
“My hotel has been surrounded by press, they are all camped outside the door. The hotel asked if there was someplace else I could go, the other guests of the hotel had been complaining about it.”
Sherlock took a seat at the table with Greg who he nodded awkwardly and used the line that most Brits resorted to when they had nothing to say “So what do you do Sherlock?”
“Sorry” John said feeling embarrassed. Had he misread the situation? No that was ridiculous, he’d felt how hard Sherlock had been. But what if this was another example of Sherlock’s confusing mixed signals. “You don’t have to… you know” he nodded down to his crotch.
It was a bright afternoon in May and, as usual, the old second hand bookshop on the corner of Baker Street wasn’t seeing a lot of foot traffic. John Watson sighed as he looked down at his ancient laptop, frowning at the red numbers that appeared on his accounts from last month’s sales figures. Something drastic would have to happen for the shop to remain open. He was barely hanging on, it was losing him money daily and the rent on his flat was becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with. There was only so long his endlessly patient and frankly doting landlady would put up with his promises of “I should have the money next week” and “can I pay you in instalments?” The bookshop had been there so long it practically faded into the background of the street, a mere blur to tourists as they bustled past on their way to Madam Tussaud’s. The peeling paint on the front of the shop left something to be desired next to the glossy fronted boutiques and modern looking wine bars that had sprang up over the years next door.
“John, I’m so sorry to intrude… I just didn’t know where else to go.” His voice sounded soft and sad, none of the edge or bite that it usually had.
John suddenly felt ashamed at himself. From what he had heard from Clara, Greg had literally just signed the papers on his messy divorce and had finally found something that made him happy and he had said that he would sacrifice that to stop causing any further hurt to John. He felt selfish and pathetic. Greg was right, he had only known Sherlock for two days. It was just something about him that had drawn him in, made him feel things he hadn't since he had been a newlywed. He knew he should try and be a good friend to Greg.  He just couldn’t get past the fact that everyone was happy except for him. He supposed he’d always have Molly to fall back on when he needed a friend. She, like him, seemed to be eternally single. Maybe they'd end up being live-in friends who never had sex and had a bunch of cats. Most marriages turn out like that eventually anyway right? He wasn't missing out on anything. Greg’s phone beeped, he looked down at it and John noticed the small smile that Greg couldn’t hide in time. He straightened his face quickly when he looked up at John.
"John, I should warn you, I haven't done this for a very long time. I'm afraid I'm rather out of practice."
“I was hoping you may be able to recommend something to me, I am interested in doing a bit of background reading on the Cold War. Do you have anything that would be suitable?”
"I try and maintain a safe distance from humanity. I draw away, never letting anyone in or close to me. I couldn't risk it. I developed a way to observe human behaviour and replicate it in my acting. I haven't ever really felt like the character I'm playing- I've never empathised, I can't bring myself to feel things too keenly. I’ve become really good at mimicking it. I can tell so much about a person from the smallest movements, my observations have got so accurate. You, for example, I could read military in the way you stood and held yourself. Your leg injury, clearly psychosomatic, you stood at the bookshelf for ages pondering books without even thinking about your leg. Psychosomatic implies you were injured under traumatic circumstances. Military man. There obviously must have been a real injury, because you are too young to retire so I assumed you had been invalidated out. The only thing I couldn't tell was whether you had been invalidated from Afghanistan or Iraq. The front I present to the public - it keeps me distant. I've proved already that when I fall in love I do it without any consideration for my self-preservation. It’s dangerous for me. But sex was always a means to an end and a way to show Jim that I loved him. I never enjoyed it, it's something I've avoided since then, I didn't see the point...I don't know why you are different. Sharing a bed, you saying that you wanted it not to be one-sided. You have to understand that is alien to me, I've never been in a scenario where the person I was with wanted me to enjoy it, cared just as much or more about that than their own pleasure. I knew Jim would be biding his time, waiting to make an impact with his story. He's the jealous type, he wants to be the only person to ever impact me that way. He gets a sense of ownership when it comes to me. I saw him recently, accidentally bumped into him at a party- he's still in the industry though hasn't quite broken through yet - I could tell that he knew I was pining over someone. He wanted to send a message to me that he still holds all the power over me. That he can make and break me in a matter of hours, if I don't want him then I can't have anyone. I know it was him that sold the stories to the papers. Only he has the photographic evidence that they published…. John, I understand if after everything I've told you if you never want to see me again. I'm repulsed by myself, so I can't expect you to feel any differently."
“Do you have any idea what some of these books are worth?” He looked incredulous at the casualness of John’s tone and yanked his phone out of his pocket to start typing away on it. “John, look – this is a first edition Hobbit! Worth at least £2,000 for that one book alone. And those ones there, are signed Ian Fleming’s. I’ve only been through three of these boxes… who knows what’s in the others.”
“Happy birthday Clara” Sherlock said remembering John had said it was her birthday and giving her a small smile.
Sherlock, still clasping John’s hand pulled him closer to him. His mouth brushed against John’s ear and he felt John shiver as he whispered into it. “You know… I’ve always found industry parties extremely tedious. I could be persuaded to reconsider my plans.”
"After everything that happened, I was calling round to see if you were in need of a pint but seems like you are handling everything just fine.” He gestured to John and Sherlock who were still in each other’s arms.
Sherlock began kissing him again, first on his lips and then trailed light kisses down his jaw and onto his neck. John let out a small moan as Sherlock continued to kiss near the nape of his neck. It had always been a sensitive spot for John. Sherlock returned to John’s lips and they kissed for several moments. Sherlock’s hand trailed down John’s side and caught the edge of his jumper. He tested running a few fingers underneath. He knew he needed to see more of John.
Two years after faking his death to save those who mattered most to him, Sherlock Holmes stood in his brother’s office completely in denial of what was being said to him.
The emotion in the room threatened to overwhelm them. They never spoke about how important each was to the other. Each in his own way convinced the other could never feel the same. Their eyes met for just a moment. Each felt as though they had found the calm in the storm that had been raging for the past two years. Regardless of the other thing that hung unspoken between them, no fact was more true than John Watson was nothing without Sherlock Holmes and that Sherlock Holmes could not live without John Watson.
It was as if time had stopped for John Watson. He was in a fancy French restaurant, moments away from proposing to his girlfriend, when Sherlock Bloody Holmes revealed himself after 3 long years. 3 long years that he was supposed to have been dead. John had held on as much hope as he could that his best friend had not killed himself. He defended Sherlock’s name long after the press had stopped bothering with the detective. He had moved on finally a few months ago after finally accepting what everyone else seemed to know, that Sherlock Holmes was dead and was not coming back. And once again Sherlock was turning his world upside down.
Sherlock was the first to break the silence. “John, I have to apologize for so much. I’m sorry first and foremost for putting you through all of that.  If I had any other choice that would have saved you and caused you less pain, believe me, I would have taken it. I’m so sorry for all the years your had to endure, defending a ghost. And I’m sorry for how I chose to tell you I was alive. In hindsight, it was extremely insensitive of me. I thought to try to make it a humorous surprise but I see that upon delivery, it was poorly thought out. I know it will take a lot of time, but I endeavor to make it all up to you. I hope someday you are able to forgive me.”
"Sherlock, Mycroft told me what happened on that rooftop. I know why you had to jump. And I know you well enough to know why you thought you couldn't risk telling me what was happening. Thank you, Sherlock. I know you did all of this to save me, Greg, and Mrs. Hudson. I would be lying if at first I wasn't angry and heartbroken, but I've had a long time to think about all of it."
“Thank you, Molly Hooper. As always, I knew I could count on you.” Sherlock leaned down and placed a kiss on her cheek.
I am still alive. Despite all of my best intentions, my schedule is rarely consistent. I live in the consistently inconsistent. I thank you for your patience as I do my best to keep up.
Sherlock watched John go upstairs and then went around the flat turning off the lights before heading to his own room. There was so much more that needed to be said between the two, but it could wait. They were both back at 221B, safe, and alive. They couldn’t ask for much more that this moment.
John entered the flat into the sitting room. Everything was just as he left it when he moved out a few months ago. He didn’t expect it to have changed  and yet it still felt different. He stopped near the door.
John was rummaging through his closet. Sherlock had told him to dress nice and he knew that he had to look smart at Clos Maggiore. Not just because the restaurant was extremely classy itself, but because if Sherlock was playing at something, he was going to make sure he wasn’t looking a slouch. He had no idea what Sherlock was playing at. Was this a date or not? Sherlock had given no indication. Had anyone else suggested dinner at the fancy French eatery, John wouldn’t have questioned it was a date. But Sherlock? He didn’t think like that, did he? John was finding himself less sure that Sherlock was incapable of romantic feelings as of late. He thought back to this morning when he helped Sherlock up and a feeling, a look lingered between them. John swore for a moment it looked as though Sherlock was maybe, possibly thinking about something more between them. John couldn’t trust himself. It was probably wishful thinking on his end. The good doctor would do what he always did when he didn’t know how to handle a situation, keep calm and let it play out. He was used to letting Sherlock take the lead and that’s what his plan was for tonight. John smiled wickedly when he had a brief flash in his mind at times he would definitely have no problem controlling the detective but that was a far way from where he stood now.
After embracing for a few more moments, Sherlock was the first to pull away. He smiled and wiped his eyes. “Ok, John. That's about as much sentiment as I can handle right now. Would you like a cuppa? Or something stronger?”
John stopped at the bottom of the stairs, his hand on the railing, and looked back. “I’m really glad you are back, Sherlock. I have missed you.”
John excused himself to go get changed into his pajamas and get ready for bed. Sherlock did the same and did a quick sweep of his room for any possibly offending experiments that might bother John.
The kiss started slow, barely a pressing of their lips together, then it almost immediately deepened as the two finally let go of their years of denying how they felt for each other. They kissed as if their lives depended on it. They broke apart only when they needed to breath. Sherlock pulled John close to him and John rested his head on Sherlock’s chest as they both tried to catch their breath.
Still building the scene a bit here. Some fluffy stuff too. I promise it's going to pick up soon. Thanks for bearing with me!
“Oh boys!! I’m so happy to have you both back home where you belong. I knew you’d bring him home, John.”
“I think not. I was going to take you to Clos Maggiore so dress nicely.” Sherlock turned on his heel and walked out of the room.
Sherlock looked at John as if he were some alien being. How, after everything he had put this man through, could John forgive him? Even though he understood the words his blogger was saying, he still couldn't seem to believe him. He didn't realize how much time had passed of him just staring at John when he heard his friend chuckle and say, "Alright, getting a bit creepy now, Sherlock. I'm going to make some tea."
“I want to see and touch you. I need to know every inch of you. I promise, I will tell you if it gets too much. I know you are trying to protect me, but John, I want you.” Sherlock looked pleadingly at John.
"Oh, yes. It was his secretary. She was sleeping with him to get her boyfriend a promotion but he got passed over again. She drugged his coffee and brought him out here to kill him. You'll find the murder weapon in the back of the victim's car." Sherlock spoke quickly, clearly directed at the DI but eyes locked on John the whole time.
It was a typical morning at 221B, John woke first, stumbled to the kitchen to turn on the kettle for tea. He decided to take a quick shower while the kettle was boiling to help wake him up and get ready for the day. They didn't have a case on but he knew there could be a call from Lestrade at any moment. He was very efficient in the shower, soaping up and washing his hair in just a few moments. As he was toweling himself off, he heard the kettle start to whistle. Even though Sherlock usually could sleep through an atomic bomb being dropped, John was trying to be considerate as it had been a long night. John had the dream about Sherlock's fall again. Even though waking up and seeing Sherlock helped immensely, his mind wouldn't stop racing. He turned to grab his robe off the door and realized he had forgotten it. It was a silly thing but he had started to feel a bit self-conscious about his appearance as he got older. While he was still really fit, he had not been kind to his body. He was more covered in scars than he really cared to see himself, let alone inflict on anyone else. Several from his time in the military but many more from his work with Sherlock and his time abroad keeping his detective safe. Even all the women he had been with before the fall never really seemed to notice or comment if they had about his scars; the lights usually off in those instances. John shrugged, figuring Sherlock was still asleep and he could turn off the pot and pour the tea too steep while he got dressed, he wrapped a towel around his waist and headed to the kitchen.
Sherlock was stomping around a crime scene. Even though he had made his spectacular return to life and was back at the work, he was not the same Sherlock. He barely said a word to anyone except to cut them down. He was more harsh than before. When people asked about John, he become downright vile. It had been 3 weeks since he had been home and despite multiple requests for information, Mycroft wouldn't tell him of the status of bringing John back from wherever he was. He was examining the body of a renowned barrister when he heard a commotion near the police tape.
The two men looked at each other and started laughing. The air around them had been so heavy, this felt right. Their normal bantering. They had both missed it immensely. Once they were able to stop laughing, they finished making tea and sat at the kitchen table. Ignoring the elephant in the room for now, they started talking: John catching Sherlock up on what had been happening with their group of friends over the past few years. Sherlock telling about the interesting people he met abroad during his mission and the insufferable things Mycroft had done while he was gone. As they passed the evening chatting away and getting their favorite take away, they decided to watch a few episodes of Dr. Who. It was the one show that kept Sherlock entertained enough to follow and not completely tear apart as they watched. He had missed quite a lot while he was away. It wasn’t until several episodes later, when Sherlock and John were dosing off on the couch, that Mary finally crossed John’s mind. As he felt Sherlock cover him with the throw from the couch, he decided he could call Mary tomorrow.
John sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. How had his life come to this again? He seemed to be standing on the cusp of something and it was time once again to decide where he would go. Would he stay with Mary and forget all about his life of adventure with Sherlock? Or would he be once more pulled by the thrill of the chase and leave the life in suburbia before he even got there? He thought of Mary. Sweet, funny, kind Mary. She had brightened up his life  when he was caught in the depression of wishing Sherlock was alive but coming to terms with the fact he did actually die on the concrete in front of Bart’s. With Mary, he was starting to think of settling down, starting a family,maybe start up his own practice. To do the things that proper men do when they reach his age.It’s the life that Mary dreamed of and deserved.  Certainly chasing serial killers and thieves through the streets of London was not what a respectable retired army Doctor did.
John thought for a moment about his next question, “But after you stopped the snipers, why didn’t you come back then? Where have you been for 3 years?”
Sherlock’s voice screaming his name in what sounded like utter terror. John was on his feet with his Sig in his hand before he realized it. He moved as quietly as he was able to his door to listen. It sounded like Sherlock was in his bedroom but there was no way of knowing if there were intruders throughout the flat or just in Sherlock’s room.
John’s brow furrowed as he took in this new information, his heart pounding so hard he thought for sure it would break through his ribs. “Sherlock, you are going to need to be really clear right now. Are you saying what I think you are saying?”
“Agreed. Wouldn’t want your feet to dangle off the bed every night.” John chuckled as he began putting his coat on. “Off to the shops. We need milk. Anything else?”
“It’s been over a week. I’ve been trying very hard to be patient. Can you please tell me what happened with Moran?”
I'm sorry for the short chapter and I promise I am working on chapter 6. I do really still love this fic and plan on continuing it. I hope to be updating more regularly now that our new normal is starting to sort itself out.
He stood as the warm water washed over him and he smiled thinking back over the past few weeks. What started as a moment of vulnerability for Sherlock, which John knew much have killed Sherlock to show, had turned into a more permanent arrangement. John was content with how things were going, feeling more complete than he had in a long time. A part of him wished that he could confess to Sherlock that he was in love with him and give himself to him completely but he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t return the feelings and he would ruin everything by trying to explain his feelings to Sherlock. While Sherlock had changed rather dramatically during their years together, John knew this better than anyone else, feelings and sentiment were extremely difficult for the detective and he preferred not to deal with them. John would never force his hand. In whatever way he had Sherlock, he would be happy. John sighed and turned off the water. He needed to get to work. He quickly dried off, dressed, and had a cup of coffee. He was gone long before Sherlock finally woke up.
Now how to handle talking to John when he was still reeling from learning that Sherlock had to lie to him about dying? Sherlock was out of his depth. This was most definitely a 3 patch problem. It would be a 7% solution problem but he wouldn’t turn to drugs. As John would tell him, it’s not okay. More than a bit not good.
John chuckled. “What does Mycroft want now?” Sherlock looked up at him. “How did you know it was Mycroft?”
The next chapter will feature some fluff with a heavy dash of smut. I'll mark accordingly where the smut will begin and end if that's not your bag and you don't want to read it.
John wandered into the living room. He wasn't sure what he was looking for but felt like he should be doing something. He looked at the photographs on the credenza. Something caught his eye. A picture of what was likely the whole family. He picked up the frame and walked back into the dining room. There were 6 people in the photo, but only 5 bodies.
John’s thoughts turned to Sherlock. He was so angry and at the same time so relived and happy that Sherlock came back. He was angry that Sherlock left and didn’t tell him. He would’ve followed Sherlock to the end’s of the Earth hunting down Moriarty's  men. He was relieved  both to have his friend back and that Sherlock survived such an ordeal to make it back to him. This also caused bigger problems for John. He knew long before Sherlock fell that his feelings for the detective were no longer platonic. He had fallen deeply in love. He always hid this fact as best he could for so many reasons, but mostly because Sherlock would never feel the same way. Sherlock didn’t do relationships. John was fortunate enough to be counted amongst the very very few friends that Sherlock Holmes had in his life and he would be arsed if he was going to ruin that by overwhelming Sherlock with emotion. He wasn’t entirely sure that Sherlock was able to comprehend what being in love truly was and it seemed unlikely that it would be something that Sherlock would be a willing participant too. After all, didn’t he say that sentiment was a chemical defect found in the losing side?
"Thank you, Sherlock. I'm sure you would've solved it quicker if you had walked into the living room before I did. I found the picture but didn't know that the missing man was the killer. We solved it together." John winked at Sherlock.
“It’s ok, John. I realize this may be awkward. We can just forget it.” Sherlock looked away and down.
John looked carefully at the older Holmes brother. “There is no next mission, Mycroft. Sherlock is home. Moran is dead. Mission over. Did something else happen?”
“I’m fine, John. Just very full. I haven’t eaten this much food in ages. Ah, Angelo,” Sherlock smiled at the restaurateur, “the meal was splendid. Thank you.” Angelo smiled back already knowing the answer to his question, “Any room for tiramisu?” John rubbed his stomach and said, “You would have to roll me home in that case. Ta, but not for me.” Angelo cleared the plates away.
Sherlock and John just chuckled. They finally separated. “Well don’t just stand in the doorway you two, come in and we'll get a pot going.” John ushered them both in.
Season 4 is breaking my heart. I don't know about anyone else. My God! I won't say anything else in case some haven't caught up yet. The Final Problem on Sunday night.
After a blissfully uneventful day at Baker Street, John and Sherlock got take away for dinner and watched a film. John got up and stated that he was going to go to bed. Sherlock stiffened up a bit and cleared his throat.
When they pulled up to the crime scene, Sherlock had to admit, it was a fascinating case. The whole family, sitting in what he presumed would be their usual seats, an elaborate meal in front of them. As Sherlock flitted around the table, John spoke with Lestrade. "Do we know the cause of death?"
“Sherlock, let’s go for a walk. It’ll be good after such a big meal. Get some air.” John stood up and began to gather his coat as if nothing was amiss but keeping a close eye on Sherlock’s face. Sherlock nodded. John gave their thanks to Angelo, promising they will be back soon, and ushered Sherlock outside.
To the dismay of both, neither was brave enough to take that next step. Over the course of the couple of weeks, clearly a shift was made. They crowded each other's personal space with no issues, they were definitely more than friends but not quite a couple. While touching was happening more often, it was still awkward, almost as if they weren't allowed even if no objections were made on either side. They worked cases together as always, Sherlock being more considerate to John in asking his opinions and observations before he went off on his own tangents. That meant a lot to the doctor, making him feel more like a partner than just someone who was filling in for Billy the Skull. John continued to compliment Sherlock and make sure he felt appreciated for more than just being a genius. For all the work he had done for the Yard and his clients, everyone was harsh in dealing with the detective. Which he returned in kind as he felt no one respected him for anything beyond his deductions. The genius never said as much to John, but he didn't need to. John didn't know everything about Sherlock, but it was obvious he hadn't been given kind words often and that just wasn't acceptable to the soldier.
“I don’t know what happened… I was walking down the road after work and a car pulled up beside me and told me it would be in my interest to get in. John, I’m a police officer I can’t resist opportunities like that.” John knew the feeling, the scent of danger had always attracted him too, had been the thing that had drawn him to the army. “I was dropped off outside a bar and when I went in it was empty except for this man… Mycroft. He wanted to know how you were getting on, wanted to know if I would accept a payment to keep an eye on you for him.”
“John! John! You’ve got a visitor” John’s landlady, Mrs Hudson, was shouting from outside his flat. He thought for a mad second that it would be Mary. She had text him again this afternoon, but he hadn’t replied.
Something about this struck a chord with Sherlock. The only thing that mattered to him for so long was the work, it had helped him overcome the dangerous entanglements he had got involved in in his youth. The work was his salvation, the only thing that didn’t bore him. He couldn’t lose it, couldn’t afford to let his mind be distracted by the traps of romance and attraction.
“Mr Holmes, the journalist is here. We’ve booked off a section of the bar for you to speak to him and we’re all ready to go.” She glared around impatiently.
"You're overreacting. Come on Sherlock I didn't call them. What does it matter if they've seen you? Just calm down, can’t we just have a laugh about all this?" John said as Sherlock sat down on the sofa to put his shoes on. He looked up and glared at John.
“Okay… Captain Watson.” There was the sudden edge of arrogant humour in Sherlock’s voice again, his eyes regaining a bit of their sparkle.
He didn’t mean to yell it. He didn’t mean for the people sitting nearby to stop their conversations and turn to look at them, stunned.
“The man who kidnapped you this morning is my manager, and less importantly my brother, Mycroft. He is extremely, ah, sensitive where I am concerned. I had a rough time when I was in my early twenties and he hasn’t exactly got past that. He was worried that you might be tempted to drag my name into the mud with the press, rehash old rumours about me.” Sherlock explained.
Sherlock dropped his bag on the floor and stood awkwardly in the middle of the living room, he seemed so unlike the man who had once stripped his shirt off in this very room and had kissed John in the hallway.
“John Lewis Gaddis provides a good introduction into the Cold War if you are new to this period of history, or Odd Arne Westard also gives a more global perspective if you want a bit of the wider picture” He walked back over to the counter carrying the books against his chest so as not to drop them. It had become a bit tricky to carry things when he had concentrate on holding a walking stick at the same time.
Sherlock yanked John’s hand and almost ran to the lift in the hotel lobby, pretty sure they had knocked several people flying in their haste. The lift up to the twelfth floor was unbearable, other people had got in with them on the ground floor and the lift was stopping at every floor. They stood there next to each other in the enclosed space, the tension radiating off them so strongly Sherlock was surprised you couldn’t see it in the air around them. It was excruciating, Sherlock felt as if he had a literal itch that he couldn’t wait to scratch.
“People do little else. But fine, point made. I’ll invite him over after the photoshoot and try to dissuade him from speaking about my
“Come on John, this is getting ridiculous now. It’s been over a month now and apart from going to work, you haven’t left the flat or seen anyone. You need to stop thinking about that lanky twat and get yourself out there.”
“Oh, Sherlock. You didn’t” He didn’t have to tell Mycroft. Mycroft always knew. “We are going to have to do some damage control here, Sherlock. We have worked so hard to build up your public persona. Worked so hard to repair the mess you created last time you got involved with someone. You know how lucky you are that your career even managed to take off after what happened.”
“Come on now John, we haven’t got time for your inane questions. Your frankly awful taste in coffee has offended me enough, who drinks an espresso at this time of day?” Sherlock replied, brushing John aside “I guess I should be grateful it was only a small cup”.
The bookshop had been opened by Joseph Watson nearly thirty years ago and in the days where televisions were rare and books were only available on paper, business had been doing well. Now with kids and adults alike glued to smart phones and the easy convenience of e-readers it had become a different story. After Joseph’s death three years ago, the shop had been passed down to his children. Harriet (“eurgh, don’t you dare call me Harriet”), although the eldest of twins by eight minutes was a feisty spirit and shrugged off all responsibility by saying she preferred to watch films instead of read books anyway. Ownership and management had therefore fallen to John. John had always loved books. Reading had been his one solace in the army, reading whatever it was he could get his hands on: old medical papers, yellowing letters from his comrades’ loved ones pinned to the walls of their dugouts, he had even read the bible several times from cover to cover despite not being the slightest bit religious. Those rare times he had stumbled across a proper book and had time in between emergency surgeries and dodging bullets, he savoured the time he spent reading- it allowed him to escape the screams and explosions that made up the orchestra of his daily life. He had jumped (not literally, his leg would not have allowed him to do so even if he had wanted to) at the chance to run the family bookshop when he had returned from war.
The sound of John’s laugh filled Sherlock’s heart with warmth. His smile made his eyes crinkle at the side. Sherlock, for the second time in over ten years, was seized with the uncontrollable urge to feel lips move against his, John’s lips. To let John kiss back this time and break down every restraint that Sherlock had put in place for so long. He leaned forward and gently ran his hand up John’s neck and then stroked along his jaw line. John took a miniscule step towards him and then Sherlock couldn’t help himself, not even caring if anyone saw them despite his brother’s warning this morning that every pocket now housed a camera. He grabbed John by the lapels of his jacket and yanked him towards him. Pressing his lips roughly against John’s, a surge of heat rushed through his veins as he heard John moan into his mouth. It was exhilarating; he knew he was awakening the beast that had hibernated within him.
John looked sideways at him, smiling sadly. “Harry is absolutely besotted with her and so obvious about it. Always has been from the day Clara moved in with me…. But Clara, she’s straight and she’s never seemed interested in Harry that way. She always acts really… platonic with her”
"Oh god" John sighed above him, his hands still loosely in Sherlock's hair. The feeling of the warm wet heat of Sherlock's mouth, of his tongue licking at his frenulum, His big hand wrapped around the base moving up and down in time with his mouth was driving John mad. Sherlock was humming around him, and when he felt himself hit the back of Sherlock's throat he couldn't stop himself from swearing out loud. It had been so long since he had been touched with anything other than his own hand, he had forgotten how good it felt. John opened his eyes to find Sherlock looking up at him through his eyelashes, pupils blown wide open. Looking past his face John could see that Sherlock's hand that wasn't wrapped around John had bought his own cock out of his pants and was moving furiously on himself. In his marriage, John always suspected that whenever his wife had done this to him it had been more of a chore, she’d do it to get him off but never because she actually enjoyed it. Yet here Sherlock was so aroused by having John's dick in his mouth that he was stroking himself off at the same time. The sight was suddenly too much. He didn't want to be embarrassed by how quickly this would end and before he had even had a chance to touch Sherlock.
“I’m sorry for that surreal but nice comment” John croaked when Sherlock pulled away, his voice sounded hoarse.
Sherlock stuck out his hand for John to shake. John took it. His hand felt warm and soft in his, Sherlock’s fingers completely enveloped John’s smaller hand. This simple action sparked flames in Sherlock’s stomach remembering the feeling of those gentle hands on his chest.
John coughed lightly as he walked in to make his presence known and put the jumper down on the sofa next to Sherlock.
“What did he say?” Sherlock asked, expecting the answer. After all Mycroft wouldn’t be asking him to speak to John if he had been successful in his endeavour.
To give Greg credit, he did pretend to protest for a little bit before he headed out the pub after giving John a brief one –armed hug. John couldn’t really blame him, if he had a Holmes at home he wouldn’t be able to bring himself to leave the bed for at least a month.  Don’t think about that. He drained his beer in a few gulps which probably wasn’t advisable because he hadn’t really eaten that much today. He thought briefly about getting another one, he was feeling quite pleasantly buzzed.
Greg perked up a bit, his conversation flowing a bit easier at the revelation. “Oh, good for you. I did a bit of acting in my school days before I joined the force”. Police officer then, senior most likely. Long hours would allow wife opportunity to carry on with an affair without much difficulty. “Have you been in anything I might of heard of? Soap operas, is it? Or are you a west-end type?”
“Greg!” John actually started laughing, he hadn’t laughed for so long. It made his cheeks hurt. “Who is she?”
The sound of his mobile ringing woke Sherlock up. He rolled over, his eyes adjusting to the morning light streaming in through the curtains he forgot to draw last night. He reached out for it but his mobile rang off. He looked down at his bare chest, the angry looking red mark from yesterday had faded but was still visible. This would mean longer in the make-up chair this morning before his photoshoot trying to disguise it.
John looked guiltily down at Sherlock’s sodden and stained shirt and fumbled in his pocket for his keys to open the front door directly next to Speedy’s. He pushed it open with his good shoulder and heard Sherlock follow and close the door behind them. John climbed the stairs up to his flat, praying that his flatmate wasn’t in. He could see her now in his head, tilting her head back and roaring with laughter at his bad luck, how only he could manage to scald an A-list celebratory and ruin a shirt that probably cost more than he earnt in a month.
They avoided talking about Sherlock, John could tell Greg was trying to cover every topic except for that one, asking him about the bookshop, whether he had seen the Arsenal game that afternoon and how his leg was doing.
“Can I help at all?” John asked, trying to sound casual although inside his chest his heart was thumping rapidly.
“Roommate” Sherlock had heard the accusation in Mycroft’s voice and rebutted with defiance. He was so confused about why he had jumped to his defence. What did it matter if John had a girlfriend? Nothing to do with him, he didn’t care.
John woke up feeling relatively fresh the next morning. He had thought a lot of Mary, how much he had cried over her, how much she had hurt him. His heart skipped a bit when he remembered she had asked him to dinner last night and for a moment he had all but forgotten about Sherlock for the first time in a month. The way she had spoken to him made him feel like there was still something between them. Maybe he didn't have to end up alone. He reached over to his phone and saw he had a text from her.
John rolled over and wrapped his arms around Sherlock and placing Sherlock's head on his chest. From this angle, he could place soft kisses into Sherlock's curls.
“Thanks for the jumper and the shower” Sherlock said, opening the front door and stepping out onto the street. He had walked about three steps down the road when he turned to look at John over his shoulder. “It’s a good job you saw me out, you’ll be needing to pick up your walking stick. You left it on the floor of the coffee shop.”
“Greg, you knew what he did to me, he wormed his way into my life and he had a girlfriend. A fucking girlfriend. It’s public knowledge that he has a girlfriend but I’m such an idiot I didn’t even realise. I think about how at Clara’s birthday the rest of you must have been looking at me like a fucking fool. Wondering how I couldn’t know that he was involved with someone else. He made me look like an absolute idiot in front of the only people I care about. He ripped me to pieces in just two days and I am doing my utmost to forget it and you are dragging all this back up again by getting involved with his fucking brother.”
They made Sherlock stand against a cold wall in a blue t-shirt and jeans, apparently to make him look more approachable. He never wore t-shirts except to go to bed in, which he did only when there was no one around to see him, when he could lounge around his New York apartment and be himself without anyone else to comment. He felt a bit uncomfortable with the flashes going off in his face; one of his hands was practically pulling down his trousers, leaving a small section of his belly and the top of the ridiculous red pants they had laid out for him visible over the top of his jeans. He felt like a complete idiot – what adult man wore red underpants anyway? Did people actually find this sexy? No doubt they would airbrush him completely out of recognition as well. The photoshoot was easy though, he could do this nonsense in his sleep, knew how to focus his eyes so that they made the viewer feel like his was directly staring into theirs, knew how to position his arm behind his head to make his lean arms look more muscular to make himself appeal to society’s ridiculous notions of beauty and manliness.
He gave John a small wink and carried on down the road leaving John to curse the cruel God who had imprinted in his memory the feeling of a smooth and muscular chest under his fingertips only to make him stand there and watch the man walk away from him and out of his life.
me and then I get kidnapped this morning and treated as I’m some sort of crazy stalker hell bent on my five minutes of fame. YOU invite me to your bloody photoshoot where I have to stand there and watch you make “come fuck me eyes” into the camera. YOU look at me across the room like I’m the only thing you see and then you come up to me and act as if you hate me.” He said all this in one long rant, barely taking a breath.
John said nothing. This morning in Speedy’s when he had seen the papers scattered across the coffee table, he toyed with the idea of reading all the stories but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He didn’t want to ask Sherlock about it, but it was obvious that it had affected him. To be honest, John didn’t want to know, didn’t want to believe that the headlines had been true.
Or if his gut reaction was right, and it was rarely wrong these days, it would turn his world upside down. He would be so deeply drawn in, so consumed and charmed by John and his dysfunctional, ordinary life that he wouldn’t be able to tear himself away.
He walked into the room to find Sherlock sitting cross legged on the floor, hair freshly washed, dressed in his usual suit looking substantially better, with three of the cardboard boxes opened and books scattered around him. He looked up, peering at John with such a quizzical and innocent look on his face that it made John’s heart rate pick up a little bit. He looked utterly adorable.
Feels like it's been ages since I've posted... Work has been crazy busy and I've had hardly any writing time. Due some holiday soon so will try and make some progress!
"You don't understand do you? I worked so hard to build up a reputation. A day after stories of me sleeping around with men, of me selling myself, come out and then I'm photographed in a man's house naked in a sheet? Does your idiotic brain not understand what that looks like? Every time someone googles me this story will come up. On the internet those stories last forever. I will regret this forever."
But it wasn’t just that, he was having a hard time believing this was real, he couldn’t bare his flatmate to be there and ruin the fantasy and bring him back down to earth by telling him this was all a dream. Didn’t want her reminding him that film stars didn’t go back to the houses of penniless nobodies like John.
Greg slammed a pint down on the table in front of John, and then sat down opposite him at the table.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks, completely astounded. “John, how could you not see..? If I am sure of one thing it is that Clara is definitely a lesbian. It’s so blatantly, to use your word, obvious that she is extremely attracted to your sister. Her pupils dilate when she looks at her, she leans forward to speak to her as if she’s the only one in the room and frankly she looks down far too often at your sister’s lips for someone with no interest in kissing her. I am deeply concerned if you think that is in anyway platonic...”
John didn’t just let people into his life that easily, that was now painstakingly clear to him. Sherlock had known him two days and Sherlock had messed him around already in that time and John had given him a chance and invited him into his circle. This realisation that John had broken down his guarded barriers, invited Sherlock into his closest circle and they had accepted him without question. Thrilled for John that he had finally, finally found someone he might be willing to trust again. Sherlock had never felt so humbled and so fond of anyone in his life.  The feeling was consuming and he found that he was beginning to crave it.
John snorted humourlessly. “So are you telling me not only are you shagging his brother, you are also spying on me?”
“No John, please listen to me. Irene may be my girlfriend, but that is by name only. I was having a bit of a lull after my Oscar win in terms of press, lack of job offers, no personal life to speak of and Irene just got into a relationship that she needed to hide from the press. Our publicists hooked up and it was a mutually beneficial arrangement to put it out there that we were in a relationship. Get my name back in the papers and hide the fact that Irene was in a relationship with another woman. Woman, John. I am as much her type as she is mine. I thought it was obvious, particularly to you, that I am very much a gay man.”
Greg reached out to put his hand on John’s arm. “No, no, John, no. I refused his offer of money and that was it, it really was. Well, he ended up asking me about my job, prying obviously and then before I knew it we had had a few drinks and really got on.”
“Films? Blimey good for you. The pay though, some of my old friends from school been in the business longer than you, they are scraping by on next to nothing. How’s the pay in films? Your last film for example, what did you get paid?’
Despite himself, Sherlock couldn’t help but have a good time. They were all laughing good naturedly at Greg’s misfortunates, Greg had taken it surprisingly well. Sherlock suspected it had a lot to do with the fact that Greg was about a bottle of wine down and had got progressively more giggly as the evening went on, the sadness on his face diminishing with every sip. Harry happily filled Sherlock in stories from John’s youth – much to John’s embarrassment. “His nickname at school was Three-Continents Watson!”
Sherlock pushed past him, bag slung over his shoulder and slammed the door behind him. John was still by the window and he saw as Sherlock made his way onto the street, pushing through all the press and into the waiting back Sudan across the street.
“Oh god, I am so sorry” he said, looking up at the unfortunate soul who had just been scalded by his coffee. John gaped. Sherlock Holmes was stood in front of him, his once crisp white shirt now stained with dark brown liquid and his face scowling. John swore under his breath, just his bloody luck.
Couldn't resist doing a little homage to Benedict's Vanity Fair cover shoot in which he looks, as usual, absolutely flawless. Can't get enough of those red pants!! Red pants most likely will make another cameo in later chapters......
Then, out the corner of his eye, he saw him standing by the door. His hands were clasped behind his back and he was rocking back on his heels, no sign of his walking stick. John. He looked so out of place that Sherlock couldn’t help but feel a rush of affection for this man, a feeling quite alien to him.
John felt his heart plummet. He wanted to be sick. How could his perfect day yesterday turn so terribly wrong?
"John I just opened the curtains in your living room in nothing but a sheet. There are over 100 paparazzi outside your front door. I doubt they are there to take photos of your landlady. How did they know I was here? Your sister and roommate aren't here, they couldn't have told anyone. Your landlady clearly didn't know who I was when she let me in yesterday. The only logical conclusion is that you let the press know where I was." Sherlock snarled.
