The prosecutor set her jaw grimly. “Thank you, Professor Asimov.”
“Shit. I didn’t know everything the dude was into.”
Jody indicated Gabriel to the side. Zach joined them. “Agent Novak, I don’t have to remind you of the importance of this.”
As he sent it, he noticed the unending sound of liquid wasn’t stopping. He peered into the rear view mirror but couldn’t see anything. Cas undid his seat belt quickly and hopped out of the car, eyes darting all around in the oppressive darkness. He saw the open flask on the car roof spilling liquid onto the ground. Cas’ breathing quickened as he looked about wildly for his charge.
"Charlie, who the hell is this? Male? Female? Are you sure it's a real name?"
Dean broke into a deep laugh as he headbutted the guy square on the nose.
His friends didn’t disappoint. Dean received frequent photos, staring at them constantly throughout the day. His particular favourites were one of Cas and Gabe, where Gabriel had an arm around Cas, pulling him in to pose, almost pulling him off balance, as Cas was about to burst out laughing. His blue eyes popped marvellously in that photograph. Cas looked happier in himself now that he had his brother back.
"What the hell-?"
They heard a noise behind Cas as a guy climbed over the railing on the next walkway over, cocking a gun at them. They both shot him through the chest.
“C’mon Sammy!”
Zach came up to Gabriel. “There’s no sign. They vanished in Amsterdam. Dukhovich is nearly free.”
"I trust you Dean."
Cas blinked slowly and Dean was gone, the bathroom door shutting softly behind him. Cas tried to process what he had just heard, but figured fuck-it, he’d try tomorrow after sleep. He lamented not being able to write anything down as he painstakingly went through the travel plan again in his head.
“I thought I lost you that day, Cas. For a moment, I really really did. It-it broke me. I thought you— All because you— took a bullet for…for me—” Dean looked away. Cas frowned at the disgusted tone. A single tear fell from Dean’s eyes, more threatening to spill over. Cas hugged him tighter, just making out the whisper. “I would never have forgiven myself.”
Dean looked around the side of the car again as Cas spoke.
As they appeared to be favouring Dean’s UK place to stay in, Cas had clearly helped himself to Dean’s clothes stash. It did things to his chest to see Cas in his various band t-shirts in the summer sunshine. Most were too big for him, making him look extra adorable. Fuck, such a shame they’d had so little time before he got thrown back in jail. He hoped Cas knew just how deeply Dean loved him.
A hastily pulled bicycle did the trick, with the first goon quickly falling over it, unable to avoid it in his haste. He smacked the ground in frustration. Cas exited the train, immediately colliding with the third guy, bringing them both down. Cas rose quickly, speeding along the platform, cocking an eyebrow over his shoulder at the hilt of his pen knife sticking out of the middle of the Belarusians chest. He hadn’t gotten up. Cas was almost at the end of the platform.
Dean pushed the door open, holding it wide for Cas. The place was deserted, but there was loud music even in here, along with the same dim light. Dean pulled Cas into the end stall, pressing him up against the door as he leaned over to lock it after them. This movement brought their faces very close together. He stared heatedly at Cas, eyes roving over his features. Cas couldn’t take it anymore, grabbing Dean’s face and pressing their lips together at last. Dean was completely onboard with this, groaning into Cas’ mouth. Dean pressed himself fully against Cas, elbows on the door on either side of his head as he began rutting against him. Cas moved one hand to grab into Dean’s hair, deepening the kiss. Dean wrapped one arm around Cas’ waist, pulling him ever closer in to him with a moan. Dean could feel Cas’ hard length as he hefted Cas’ leg up around his hips, pushing their erections together.
Night had fallen fully by the time the car rumbled out of the garage.
“What did he ever do to you that was so bad anyways? Try to kill you?”
“And how did you get into your line of work?”
“Um, there’s no way out but through, man.”
Chuck hauled himself to his feet. “Your Honours. I could save us all some time. May I address the court?”
Dean watched his mouth closely. Good fuck, Cas had such beautiful lips. And if Dean was imagining them wrapped around something else, that was his own damn business.
“Picture?”
“Thank you, sir.”
Dean had brushed off of Cas’ crotch with an exploring hand. Dean chuckled, deliberately avoiding the area for now, instead moving his lips to the side of Cas’ neck, trying to learn all the ways he could pull more of those delicious gasps and moans from his love. Dean’s hands were everywhere, running through Cas’ hair, feeling along his broad shoulders, clutching at his hips, getting up under Cas’ shirt, running down his firm torso. Cas had wound his arms around Dean’s shoulders, trying to hold on, gasping as Dean’s lips found a sensitive spot below his ear.
Zach watched Gabriel leave as he placed a phone call.
The helicopter circled the building, still looking for Chuck. Dukhovich made his way to the biggest space where the chopper could land. Not seeing Dean anywhere he went for it, running out into the open area, yelling and waving madly to the helicopter as he stood by the ledge. The Belarusians on board saw him, smiled, dropped their weapons, and got ready to land. Chuck’s heart soared, triumphant that he was getting away from this shit show at last.
“Awh damn, I liked him. Quite the trickster once he opened up.”
“Cheer up, Bucko! What else were you gonna do tonight? Get dirty with another book, maybe get freaky with your hand? Eh? Eh?”
“Oh for fuck sake.” Cas pulled over with a thunderous expression. The car cut out. They were in the ass crack of nowhere, not having passed another car on the little back road for miles. Dean heaved himself out of the vehicle with a groan, testing his bad leg and hobbling around to the back. The sound of splashing liquid quickly followed. Cas sighed, pulled out his phone, glanced at a few things and sent Gabriel a quick text message: “No problems so far.”
Cas watched Dean go as Gabriel sidled up beside him. Gabe whistled low as he took in the state of his baby brother. There were cuts all over his face and hairline, blood matted in his hair, the electrocution burns were still prominent, the blood from the nail wound had been leaking down behind one ear, staining all along his shirt collar, and had leaked into his eyes leaving blood trails down his face, his elbows were ripped open, one suit sleeve was almost completely ripped off, as was the back of one pant leg, which also contained the bleeding shovel injury. Cas limped as he stepped back, fixing his tie. He gave a small smile at his brother. “Hi, Gabriel.”
Dean looked to him with a confused expression. “You got a place in Amsterdam?”
Garth was shaken out of his reverie by a low voice. “Professor Asimov. Can you please tell the court what happened next?”
When Charlie was finally satisfied with all of the portraits, she announced they could leave. Dean appeared at Cas’ side as he was smiling fondly at all of the pictures in his chat, setting them to save directly to his camera roll. Even the prom ones had come out well, he had somehow managed to look all right.
Cas looked to the ground and huffed out a big sigh. “He is. And I told him today that I forgave him.”
Cas glanced at him briefly, then turned back to the road, chewing.
“Oh, semantics.” Dean waved it off, trying to hide his grin.
Dean slid into the door, snorting loudly. Cas smiled again, returning his full focus to the road, reaching for his bag. After a few miles, they went over a speed bump.
The doorbell woke Dean in the bedroom, who stayed where he was on the bed. His lower leg was exposed with the bandaged wound elevated on the bed. Gabriel opened the door slightly, keeping it on the latch, cocked gun held high. Cas stared back at him with an unamused expression. “Go ahead. You might as well finish the job.”
“No, no, no Dean. It was my fault. I did it all to myself. When it happened, I acted like a child. And it cost me my only family for two long years. It’s been very lonely, he was all I had. But I did that, not you. Gabriel, we were closer than brothers. Closer than anyone. I should have just listened to Gabe, but I didn’t. Couldn’t. And… I ruined it all.”
Dean smiled at him and looked back to the sea. They rode the rest of the way to Amsterdam in silence.
“Where the hell’s that coming from?” Dean demanded as he hunkered down.
Dean stepped over two bodies, carrying on up the staircase. The medical helicopter drew near to the building.
“Semantics?” Cas stared at him with disbelief.
“Well, good for them. Family makes a man whole.” Chuck smirked. Garth squinted in confusion.
After a short while, Cas pulled off the main road into a service station with a diner attached. Cas swept his eyes around the area, taking note of cameras, angles, exits. Satisfied, he parked as far away from the building as possible, and angled the car to hide the broken window. Cas then leaned over and took off Dean’s handcuffs. “Don’t run.” He looked Dean dead in the face, making sure he had his full attention. “I will catch you.”
There was a massive explosion from the basement of the building. Cas looked over with a disinterested expression. He held open the back car door for Crowley.
Dean hopped in and looked at Cas expectantly. “She’s beautiful, Dean.”
Cas made to undo his seatbelt. “Have you ever said please or—?”
Dean gasped painfully as he retrieved the bullet, throwing it and the pliers into the sink.
“No, not at all. I meant just, tell us about you. Jess, Charlie and I are all in university here in town. Dean moved out here a few years ago when I did, to help with rent and such. He’s a mechanic and fireman. How about you?”
"Don't worry Garth, Dean doesn't care."
Unluckily, Cas stared a bit too long this time, quickly darting his eyes away when the guy looked directly at him. With a red face, almost knocking his beer, Cas pulled out his phone as a distraction, not even unlocking it, just looking down. When he risked a quick glance up, he was treated to a smile so dazzling, he was unable to look away. Cas watched breathlessly as the hot guy ran his fingers slowly down and back up his chest, lingering on his nipples, cocking an eyebrow in invitation.
“Ma’am, this place is like a war zone. We’ve got bodies everywhere. Our unit’s compromised, everyone’s down.” He turned to another agent, pointing behind them. “Have those guys ID’d.” The man ran off.
Cas nodded, shaking himself from his stretch. “Yes. Boring. Safe.”
The waiting staff member had told Charlie there would be a picture, so they could all try to get in it together.
Cas went through the door as Crowley started to complain.
“CAS! You’re alive!” Dean hugged him tightly, sniffing and wiping his eyes with a shaking hand.
“The gun.”
The police officer turned, slashing with a practiced arm, neatly cutting the throat of the soldier. The other managed to say a few words into his radio, alerting the other guards to Chuck’s escape. He was cut off with a gurgle as the officer plunged the large knife into the centre of his chest. Chuck watched calmly as he slid down the wall, coughing blood weakly. Two more heavies appeared, taking the handcuffs off of the very pleased former dictator.
Dean hobbled down the ladder as a man rushed him. He just about got his gun out, but there wasn’t any need. Cas had already come from the side, punching the attacker savagely into the jaw, knocking him against the wall. He slid slowly down to slump into a heap on the floor.
Suddenly, Dean felt a tap on his shoulder. He kissed Cas’ hand sweetly again before leaving it go very reluctantly. He stood, held out his hands, eyes on Cas the whole time while Gabriel clapped the handcuffs on him. Dean reached out both hands, gently caressed Cas’ cheek. “Feel better. I’ll see you soon.” Dean smirked as he was led away by several Interpol officers.
“Phhfffttt. Easy. Especially for you. Death doesn’t seem to want to touch you. But yes, testifying is definitely the right call. For Benny.”
“How do you know I protected him? I didn’t meet you on that job.”
Zach had been hunched over in pain, turning to look up at Gabriel. “Give up.”
“No fucking way.” Dean slammed the boot shut, finally finished with his task. “I gotta help you get back that Triple A shit I fucked up. The guilt’s killing me.”
The six staff laid out behind him, and everyone in Cas’ ear chorused, “Boring is always best.”
"What's a Moana?" Garth asked puzzled. Dean laughed and shrugged as they made their way towards a booth.
Cas blushed, but enjoyed the hug while he could, as Dean pulled back all too soon.
“Fuck!” Dean ducked from another hail of bullets. A soldier on a motorbike drove along the top of the embankment wall, shooting down on him. The other car kept trying to press him into the wall. Dean’s car shuddered as the back bumper was ripped off. The bike jumped from the wall, gliding over Dean, landing on his far side.
Cas looked at the bag before meeting his eyes. His smile was wide, so wide his eyes got those little crinkles at the side that Dean loved so much. Damn he could get lost in those eyes, still so so blue despite his new found humanity. How could they be so blue? If they looked this good now with his beautiful smile, how would they look in the throngs of ecstasy.... Huh? Cas had said something and Dean had actually jumped as he came back to reality. Cas was still looking at him like he was the only person in the world.
Dean squared his shoulders, meeting Cas’ eyes. “Well, you know how I said I had my reasons. I’ve people like Rowena, family, dotted about the place that I would kill for. But my bestest best friend, who I grew up with, bled with, fought with, was Benny. I loved Benny like another brother. And Dukhovich killed him. I had to be physically restrained from going to Belarus myself and torching the fucker when I found out. But the very next day after he killed Benny, Chuck found himself arrested and taken to the Hague to await trial. It’s been months, but with so much security and attention on this, I had to find another way to him. Besides, it was also pointed out to me, once I’d calmed down, that taking away his precious dictatorship and leaving him to rot in jail for years with nothing is far preferable to a quick death for that prick. And aside from all that, Sammy has to go free.”
He whispered back to Dean, still watching the soldiers. “Four hostiles, probably more.”
Dean sat back, one arm along the back of his bench seat, surveying the diner. He looked back to Cas, who was wiping his face with his hands, and then slumped them back onto the table, hunched over.
“Oh no no no, I thought that— that—“
He turned to Dean. “See, boring is better.” Dean lifted the gun and fired down the corridor. Cas watched in dismay as his point flew out the window. A third soldier dropped immediately.
Dean laid him back down gently so the guard could tend to Cas’ wound. The guard’s radio crackled into life. “Dukhovich has escaped, apprehend with extreme prejudice.”
Cas quietly opened the door, peeking outside. “My job is to keep you out of harm’s way.”
Dean startled, glancing back up to Cas’ eyes. He flushed guiltily, having been caught blatantly checking him out. Dean cleared his throat.
Dean’s eyes had widened temporarily at Gabriel’s name, but he recovered his smirk quickly. “You know, Dukhovich’s men have killed every single witness that’s been brought against him. And my security detail’s a dozen off duty cops?” He looked around, not impressed.
“Really?”
Dean cocked an eyebrow over his shoulder, turning slightly to look at Cas. The slight movement pulled a deep groan from Cas, who pressed into Dean as far as possible, one hand moving from Dean’s hip to firmly hold his flat stomach, to pull him back even more. Dean moaned appreciatively, shoving himself back onto Cas insistently, hoping he’d take the hint.
Chuck’s lawyer stood next, with misplaced levity in his voice. “Your Honour, I request that this entire testimony be disregarded. Without any evidence, this is merely, hearsay.”
“Agent Gabe! Hang on, let me put you on speaker.” Dean did and dropped the phone into his lap.
Chuck just spoke louder.
He headed out to meet them, stopped at the top of the stairs to cast one more critical eye over the Bunker before he closed the door after himself, put his hands into his hoodie pocket and assumed a sickly air and expression to keep up his charade for another little bit. Dean and Cas were just getting out of the car as he arrived, laughing together at something Dean had said. Damn they looked so happy, this had better work! Cas reached in to get the bags, not noticing that Dean continued to look at him longingly. Sam loudly cleared his throat near Dean, causing him to leap out of his skin.
“B-Baby?”
“Jesus, it’s like a Goddamn milkshake in here!”
Cas moved quickly, man handling Dean until he was the one lying on the bed, a startled expression on his perfect features. Cas straddled his hips, leaning down to his ear, licking up along it. “Then allow me. And just remember, you haven’t seen me on a bike completely clad in black leather. Hhhhmmm, maybe for your birthday.”
"Oh! Thank you Dean! I so rarely get presents, I was very excited for this. I didn't know you had me, but then I guess that is the point. I'm sorry, I'm babbling, I'll open it now."
Cas tilted Dean’s face back to look at him, wiping his eye. “I’m right here, Dean. We’re safe. You saved me too, remember?”
A spotlight turned on to reveal a killer clown in a creepy costume and a realistic IT mask rushing at them with a roar, brandishing a knife. A lot happened all at once. The two girls clung to each other, shrieking. A screaming Sam leapt back into Dean’s arms, full Scooby Doo style. In Dean’s rush to catch the flailing Sam, he had to let go of Cas, who shrunk behind Dean, burying his face between his shoulder blades, bringing his arms around to Dean’s front, clinging to him. And at one point, there was a bright flash to signal that their photo had been taken.
“Stop it.” Dean wrapped an arm around Cas’ shoulders, starting them walking after the others. “Now now, the night's not over yet, Cas. I want to get to know you a little better. That OK?” Cas nodded, hugging his gift bag to his chest.
Cas weaved in around the vehicles, heading for Alastair’s in front. Dean was driving practically on his knees, trying to stay away from the automatic fire. The shooter was wholly focused on his target, paying no attention to his surroundings. Cas came up behind and shot him through the arm several times. The shooter dropped the gun, flopping back into the seat with a roar of pain.
Dean shared in their little trips, movie nights, all their news and delights. The pictures expanded to show sun dappled walks in the countryside, picnics, lazy nights at Dean’s, meal times and cooking. Cas needed to take lots more walks as his recovery progressed, and he was never alone on his rambles. Dean wiped his eyes when he saw a video of Cas throwing away the crutches and walking unaided for the first time. Even Gabriel holding out his arms and making out Cas was doing a baby’s first steps couldn’t dampen Dean’s full heart, laughing at Cas’ grumpy face as he swatted at his brother.
“Because of you. You used me to climb the Interpol ladder, and here we are again. Oooh.” Cas had made it to the bathroom, where Dean’s blood splatters still shone on the white tile floor. “Are you up for promotion, Gabe?”
“I don’t think you know what I’m dealing with here.”
Gabriel stared back unflinchingly.
“No!”
“We’ll get to rest soon. Don’t worry.”
Cas was halfway down the steps, watching Chuck closely. Chuck’s restrainers had almost succeeded in dragging him from the courtroom as he shouted wildly. “I will now take my leave! With my dignity intact!”
Gabriel and Dean gradually came to, with an agent screaming at them through the damaged windshield. He was suddenly blown away by a grenade. Dean spied his handcuff keys on the ground by his head. He groggily picked them up and got to work.
Another was the latest one he received, of Cas with a cake heaving with birthday candles lit in front of him. The party hat was lopsided, his chaotic hair was the longest Dean had ever seen, the facial scruff perfect. Cas was staring at the candles in awe, his expression so soft. The birthday card Gabriel got for Dean to sign was clearly visible on the table.
Cas blushed furiously. “Um, how much do I owe?”
Cas sighed. “Two things, Dean. You’re sitting right across from me. And secondly, what in the fuck do you think my job is? I have to watch you.”
The towel was pulled over his face again, and Cas began to scream once more as Rasputin put his face right up close to watch.
Dean stalked right through the next doorway.
Dean leaned in to Cas’ ear again, breathing gently down his skin, causing Cas to break out in a happy shudder. “Fuck, you’re magnificent, Cas.” Dean nuzzled into the side of Cas’ neck. Cas made such a wanton noise that he was glad the loud music covered it. Fuck, when was the last time he’d gotten laid anyway? He could feel Dean chuckling, whispering, “Oh you like that?” Cas nodded briskly, breathing hard, feeling the chuckle vibrations once more.
“You have to blame me for every little bump in your road, don’t you?”
"In here with Cas, Dean."
The vendor peered up at him. “Oh, okay.”
“I come from nothing. I work all my life, serving the people. And then they come into my country, and took it all away!” He shouted the last bit right into Zach’s startled face. “And now they lock me up like a rat, feed me poison. Is this fear? When Dean Winchester is dead, you’ll be paid in full.” He flicked the bloody pen in his face, turning away in disgust.
“Just shut up.”
“I never asked about your leg, Cas. How fucking dumb of me.” Dean moved quickly, switching them so Cas flopped onto the mattress before he knew he was moving. Dean held up Cas’ leg to have a look, rubbing gently over the angry red skin. “The infection’s all cleared up now though? This angle better for it?”
The first guy led with his gun. Cas grabbed his wrist, yanked him in further and off balance. Cas whacked the rolling pin off his face, then off his wrist until he dropped his gun. Cas wrapped the rolling pin around his throat, gripping him in a firm headlock. The Belarusian flailed wildly, shoving against Cas, pushing him back into the kitchen door which slammed into the second guy’s face, and also trapped his outstretched hand, dropping his gun. This loosened Cas’ grip, so while keeping the door shoved closed with his back, he kicked the first guy solidly into the chest. He luckily tripped and fell face first onto the grill, screaming. Cas stared at him with a confused head tilt wondering what the hell had happened.
Cas got into position, pausing a minute to wipe off some early drool. He hated these damn teeth.
"I will hold off on my sigh of exasperation. Really Dean?? He works in your department after all. A very talented photographer if I may say. How have you not met him yet?"
High above, a suited Crowley crouched under a boardroom table, ripping up and shredding paper while popping pills and muttering loudly. Papers and scrapped remains were strewn about the chaotic room. The phone on the table sat beeping off the hook. He was suddenly startled out of his reverie by the loud sound of a clearing throat. “Holy shit.”
your voice?? I would have come a whole lot sooner if I’d had that talking dirty into my ear.”
“Got it.”
Dean looked out the window again, wondering if he’d been clear enough. His walls had been put back up in concrete, completely covered over in steel, with a few coats of paint for good measure. He wasn’t sure if he could ever talk about it again, after having been shot down so hard. He wasn’t even certain what kind of response he’d been hoping for, but something would have been better than nothing. They continued in silence for many miles.
Cas smiled and arranged the four of them on the table. The first was a dramatic sunset with a beautiful silhouette of a rhino. The next showed wildebeest jumping into the water with a snapping crocodile below. Another contained a troop of monkeys leaping through the trees. The last, a mud strewn elephant spraying water on itself with a playing youngster in the foreground. They were exquisite.
The first agent on the Coventry scene rang Jody as he walked through it. Jody and Zach had the phone on speaker on the table between them, both hunched over it.
Alastair ran up the stairs of the underground behind them, giving close chase, gun in hand, smacking startled onlookers out of his way.
The screen erupted with dozens of images of Chuck and his army, shooting innocent villagers, throwing the bodies into vast pits. There were loud gasps all round, several people put their hands to their faces in shock. Chuck glowered more. The tech rotated through the images, pulling several up larger, many showed Chuck doing the shooting himself. Gabriel looked like the cat who had got the cream. Dean watched the images, nodding knowingly.
Cas shook his head to come back to himself, putting in the ridiculous teeth. “Wif deez?”
Cas shook his head, looking down and swallowing. “This is the most fun I’ve had in years. Except for the scares, obviously. And I don’t want it to end yet.”
Sam sidled up to Cas as they paused in the next room. Dean was speaking with Pamela who had evidently decided to not scare them from her place under a long table. “So, Cas. What’s your schtick?”
Judge Singer banged his gavel. “Mr Dukhovich, sit down.”
“You had a call from your lawyer today?”
Garth’s eyes darted back to Metatron, unable to believe his ears.
Cas’ face hardened. “Something funny?”
He drove up to the nearest canal, slowing down right on time, turning the bike down a pedestrian bridge before the police could catch up. He saw Dean zoom past on his boat, with the Interpol and enemy vehicles on the bank he had just left. His police car followed them instead. Cas followed Dean on the other bank.
Jody stared at her until she flushed and looked away guiltily.
“And if I may add, Cas, you’re sexy as fuck on a motorbike. Wouldn’t mind seeing you in leather some day. And you totally looked like a sexy James Bond in that tailored suit earlier, fuck!” Cas blushed, looking down to his cup as Dean carried on. “And I hope you don’t mind some random dude sleeping next to you again? Although, I must say, you’re quite the cuddler.”
popped Kurasawa.” Dean’s mirth quickly left him when he saw Cas’ face. He decided to explain quickly.
“Uncuff me, give me some car keys and some guns. I’ll meet you guys there.” Dean was deadly serious.
“Hello Gabriel!”
They landed heavily, Cas rolling off Dean, groaning while Dean laughed. “Now that’s what I call a triple A service!”
Dean was appalled. He had most definitely overstepped. Oh God! What would happen now?
“Professor Asimov?”
A few floors below that, Dean hobbled down the holding cell corridor, gun in front, frowning at the bodies of the two soldiers. Dean set his jaw, and carried on after Chuck’s bloody footprints, ascending the stairs as quickly as he could manage.
“Cas!” Gabriel gripped Zach’s hair tightly, kneeing him savagely into the face. Zach keeled over, and stayed down this time.
He slowly made his way through the first room, lights spluttering on and off periodically so he could just about make his way. It was clogged with fake spider webs that revealed only one exit on the far side. He swallowed harshly, figuring there wouldn’t be anything scary in the first room that could be heard by the queue outside the curtain. There were low sounds of a howling wind, sometimes footsteps, sometimes a witches cackle.
The helicopter swept past Buckingham Palace. “Clear roads all the way, Chief. Just like you predicted.”
Cas asked in a small voice. “Why should I trust you?”
Cas suddenly pointed to Gabe with a start. “28! Fuck it. Prague!” He turned back to Dean and savagely flicked a card at him, getting him right on the nose.
Cas drew his ringing phone out of his inside pocket. “Just help me to understand-“ He broke off as soon as he spotted the name “Pure Evil” flashing up on the screen. Cas’ eyebrows rose in disbelief, and he gave a sarcastic smile. He thought to himself, “Oh this should be good.” He held up a finger to the clerk. “Just give me a second here.”
Dean sauntered down the footpath, limping badly. He kept his head down, cap covering his face. Cas kept pace with him on foot on the other side of the road, watching closely. The street was busy and broke out into a small park, with people milling about, sitting on benches, laughing, enjoying the sunny weather.
Dean sighed, pulling on his sunglasses. “I’ll be back.”
Suddenly, Dean pulled back, eyes downcast. Cas looked down to see his shirt pulled up. Dean gently rubbed over the scar in Cas’ side that no longer hurt. He looked back to Cas, resting their foreheads together, heavy tears shining in his sad eyes. Cas cupped his face with concern.
“Counsel, approach the bench.” Both the prosecution and the defence approached the bench of three judges.
“Cas, come on, you need some shut-eye more than me.” Dean scolded.
“..the time to hear your insane shit…”
With today being Halloween, all of the shops were decorated accordingly. It had been enormous fun to wander with Cas, enjoy the decorations, poke around the little fall market in the town where the pumpkin pie had been delicious. Children had already begun to trick-or-treat in fancy costumes as they were about to leave town. Yikes, a black plastic bag or cut up bed sheet were his only costumes back in the day. Times had indeed changed. Cas hadn't recognized some of the characters. As many Iron Men and Elsas as witches and ghosts, he had to hurry with catching Cas up on the classic movies. Maybe they could watch some classic horror tonight, for the day that was in it. Freddy maybe, see how it went.
Cas scowled at him for a moment, before nodding. He got out of the car, stretching, moaning as his back popped, keeping an eye on Dean as he rounded the car to him. “Those security cameras are ancient, I don’t think they’re even working.”
“Sure am, if I can get there alive.” Dean splashed whiskey along the pliers, taking a swig himself.
Cas took a few steps to stop at the top of the low stairs leading down into the courtroom.
“….clean up will be like. At a certain point you just sell the car…”
He got to the other side, happy to have lost the cop car. He drove up a slight slope and jumped over a bench landing right in front of the cop car on the road on the opposite side. “Well shit.” Cas turned the bike and took off, the cop car right behind him again.
Gabriel huffed out a laugh. “Seriously, Cas?”
A loud gunshot rang out, and suddenly Gabriel could breathe.
“No I did not. And if guys like you-. No. If sociopaths like you weren’t running around trying to kill my clients, then no one would get hurt.”
“Question for a higher power. Who is more wicked? He who kills evil motherfuckers? Or he who protects them?”
“Sam’s gonna really like that.”
“…what?”
Cas hummed, giving Dean a squeeze as his fingers trailed down Dean’s back. Dean made a noise, head twitching as Cas’ fingers moved up and down gently. Dean tried to stop, but he couldn’t stop fidgeting his body in little jerky movements. He relished every tiny touch, giving small moans periodically.
“Thank you, Dean.”
The next room contained a long staircase leading upwards, banisters along each side, continuing into the gloom above.
Cas slided into his room and warily eyed the costume that was carefully laid out across his bed. He picked it up and thought it looked like the clothes Dean had worn when Cas had sent him back after the Phoenix. He was not looking forward to wearing a blanket for the evening, but Sam had said that Dean would like it, and Sam looked so much better than he had in weeks that he was willing to do anything to keep him so happy. He hurriedly began to dress.
“Oooh yeah. Really. If a contract comes up, and your name is attached as protector of the mark, many think twice or three times before taking it. You’re more trouble than you’re worth, with all your rules, planning and preparation. You’ve earned quite the reputation. It certainly helped your case when hitmen who came after you were popped mysteriously.” Dean coughed discreetly, looking back to the road. “You’re welcome. But yes, this reputation has helped protect you from some truly nasty people. Even if you’ve been mostly AWOL these last few years, you always pop up somewhere. That element of surprise is unnerving to a hitman.”
A crowd gathered around the car, several Belarusians checking for themselves to make sure it was really Chuck and that he was really dead. Sounds of celebration broke out across the square.
Cas rolled his eyes and obliged, walking in first. A string of curses erupted from Dean as he walked through and straight into Cas' back.
“Control Tower, Air Med One requests priority clearance to restricted zone Bravo for medical extraction.” The pilot of the medical helicopter on top of the hospital didn’t see the two black clad men exit the doors, pulling weapons from their bags, heading right for him.
When Cas broke off to speak, Dean kept kissing along his jaw, unwilling to remove his lips from him. “Will you fuck me, Dean? Please? Just you?”
“Such a chore with this face, I’ll bet.” Dean teased.
Charlie and Jess took deep breaths, held hands, and jumped through the door with a scream. Cas was wide-eyed at their bravery until Dean said to Sam with a laugh, “They’re very brave when they know there’s no scares, aren’t they?”
Cas looked at him with his usual dead panned expression. “That’s really inspirational. Thank you.”
Jody spoke first. “Mr. Winchester, this is Agent Novak. He’ll be leading the security detail that will escort you to the International Criminal Court.”
"Excellent, thanks."
He marvelled that Charlie and Kevin had already set up a new company with everyone as joint directors, Dean included. It was an executive protection company, of course. Once Dean knew they didn’t have any clients or jobs yet, meaning Cas wasn’t out in the field, he was all for it, aching to be back with them all.
"Oh Dean, there is nothing to apologize for. I know how hard you work. Your reputation has preceded you." There was that smile like the sun. Dean just stared at him.
Cas was barely paying attention to him, putting his ear buds in, as he fiddled with his phone. “Well, boring is always best.” He said absently.
Cas looked around and saw two frightened store employees gaping at him from the far corner. He hadn’t even seen them huddled there until now. Alastair’s discarded gun lay on the ground near them.
Dean’s hands drifted down, grasping Cas’ ass to hold him firmly. They could each feel the swell of their arousals through the layers of clothing. Cas moaned into Dean’s mouth when Dean began to thrust up against him. The kisses turned needy, full of want, as Dean pressed as much of himself into Cas as he could. He’d been parted from his love for much too long. Dean pulled back, smiling as Cas chased his lips, keeping his eyes closed, savouring the moment.
Cas tensed, causing Dean a moment of uncertainty. Cas tipped Dean’s chin up to look at him properly. “Of course I want you, Dean. You’re mine. Don’t you ever doubt that.”
“This is why you cannot plan everything down to the last detail, Cas. Life happens. And hey, aren’t you gonna take this gun?”
Cole piped up. “This route’s been wiped clean for us. Nothing to worry about.”
“Well, what else is there? I mean, take away the guns, the money, the travel, that perfect shot through someone’s ear hole from 300 metres…. None of that means dick if I can’t tell Sammy and my family about it.”
Dean helped Sam to his feet, who immediately turned to check on the girls. Only then could Dean feel the shaking. He gently patted Cas’ hands on his chest. He could feel Cas shake his head. Dean smiled, lifting both arms high up to turn on the spot. He manoeuvred around to face Cas, who instantly buried his face in Dean’s shoulder. Dean wrapped his arms around him, running fingers through his trembling hair.
“Obviously your Honour, this has devolved into a complete waste of my client’s time. The prosecution has no witness to present.”
"Can someone get this damn door?"
“See, Cas, I told you that photo would be useful for blackmailing Sammy.” The whole group laughed. “Well, it was a magnificent moment.” Sam gushed.
Alastair grabbed Gavin by the throat, pulling him to his feet, and then held him aloft in mid-air quite easily. He watched Gavin intently as he spluttered for air.
For those of you very familiar with the film, you might have noticed that I have changed the time frames somewhat, but I've kept it pretty close besides, just adding my own bits here and there. Thanks for joining me so far!
Dean looked through a tourist stall by a canal, choosing a baseball cap, charming his way with the girl as he purchased it. He was already carrying a small shopping bag, neatly dressed in the suit Cas had picked out for him. Cas was just across the canal, seated on a motorbike, full black helmet covering his face. He pulled it off, squinting at Dean in the sunlight. “What the hell is he doing?”
Dean looked at him hard for a moment before breaking down with laughter.
Many thanks to my beta Jenn, YOU ROCK!!!
Cas smiled at him. “Can’t hold you?”
When Cas sent him an audio file of his voice saying “Good night Dean. Sweet dreams.”, no one had to know that Dean wept himself to sleep.
Dean gaped at him.
Cole sidled off back to his hiding place. Dean watched him with angry eyes, staring back at Cas once he was out of sight. Now Cas had squinted eyes as he looked at Dean with his adorable head tilt.
“Yes, I’ve extracted my client from 27 Saint George Street. Clean up is required. The 7th floor north stairwell, I’ve left a French national employed by the Terée crime syndicate.” Cas remembered shoving the guy against the wall, holding him in a choke hold from behind until he passed out. He had dismantled the gun, tossed it down the stairs, and cable tied his hands together.
The team stared at the hunk of metal in disbelief. The second leaned in to his boss. “Is this what we’ve been waiting for?” The rest of the team surrounded the car.
Kurasawa walked up the carpet with Cas following closely behind, one hand between his shoulders protectively, eyes darting about them. The wives followed with several bags. As they came near the plane, Cas stopped, and removed his glasses. When Kurasawa turned, Cas bowed to him and expressed his thanks in Japanese.
“Can we go?” Cas ignored how the car smoked, and all the gunshot holes peppering both sides. And the missing bonnet. And bumper.
“Order!” Singer shouted at the court. Garth stared at the images, then glared at Chuck, finally vindicated.
Cas looked to his phone in surprise as it dinged with multiple notifications. “I’ve just added you on every social media platform I could find you on. And you’ve been added to our group chat as well. Too late for you! You’re hooked now, Boo!” Charlie cackled evilly.
“Thank you, ma’am.” Jody walked away, leaving Gabriel to smile to himself for a moment, until Kevin and Charlie locked arms with him on each side, forming a little three person circle, and began speaking with him quietly and rapidly.
Dean shot another guy who appeared behind the car, hopped into the front seat, and reversed back up the road. He knocked down another guy as he went. Dean stopped the car, went forwards to drive over the guy again, then continued reversing along the road, rolling over him a third time. They turned the corner and were gone.
“I’ll go up first now, OK Cas?”
Dean spoke over his shoulder. “Oh! Sorry. The password is Dukhovich is a dick, all caps, except dick is lowercase.” There were sniggers throughout the court. Zach and Metatron locked eyes briefly.
Dean nervously rubbed the back of his neck, "I thought the blue would bring out your eyes..."
Once they were safely out on the English Channel, Dean sat on some bars by the railing at the back of the boat, looking over the ocean, knees up, head in his hand. Cas looked pensive, leaning back on the bars next to Dean, his back to the sea. Something had been bothering him, and now was as good a time as any to ask.
As the Impala rumbled out of the garage, Sam clapped his hands together with glee. Let the games begin!
Garth looked at Dean with worry. Dean merely shrugged. Once on the snowy street, she linked arms with both of them, Dorothy style, and had them giggling at her little jokes and tales all the way to the bar.
“How about we never speak of this again?”
“Hello?”
"I'm sorry…what?" He stammered.
“Can I show you how much I really missed you, Sunshine? You want to?”
“Stay with him till he’s airborne.”
Dean lubed up his dick generously as Cas hovered over him, eager to be filled. Dean grabbed Cas’ hips so tight there would most definitely be bruises there later. Dean’s hard dick caught on Cas’ giving entrance, causing them both to gasp loudly in anticipation. Cas trembled as Dean pulled him down onto him ever so slowly. Dean’s back arched when he was fully seated in Cas at last, balls deep.
“Bravo One down!”
“Oh, sorry, fiancé? Husband? You boys are so unbelievably cute together, feeding each other, holding hands. I love love. I could just watch you all day.” She looked to Dean, Cas followed her eyes. Dean’s cheeks were stuffed full like a chipmunk. He happily waved over to them with his spoon.
Returning to their hotel in Havana after a walk around the city, they passed a news report on TV showing that Dean had escaped from his English prison. A global red notice was in effect and people were warned to consider him armed and dangerous. They sat around a table for dinner, laughing, as they knew how much of a sweetheart their Dean really was.
Far ahead, on the next bridge, another enemy car pulled up, and one lone man emerged. Dean spotted him, and watched him curiously for a moment until he saw something get hoisted onto the guys shoulder. Dean’s face fell. Holy fucking shit, a bazooka! Dean was still going much too fast, and trying to turn would have made him a sitting duck anyways. Dean glared at the guy as he pushed the throttle forward to full speed.
“Yes, please. Thank you Dean.”
“And nighty night.” Cas dropped his hands, not giving one fuck about Dean, tossing the now empty magazine over his shoulder, using a nearby towel to wipe his face. “Dean motherfucking Winchester. What the fuck, Gabriel!?”
“A rough patch??” Cas laughed hysterically. “A three hundred pound investment banker’s ass exploded four bags of heroin all over the back seat of my car last week. Those aren’t leather seats by the way, they’re cloth.”
“Lucky I brought extra.”
“Yeah the rock shifted right as I took the shot. Thankfully, you’re a lucky motherfucker. Fucking Prague.”
Garth looked to Chuck sharply, swallowing hard. He gave a little watery smile. “They’re on holiday.” Chuck had a faint smile on his lips.
Dean dove back in with gusto, while Cas got up to pay. Diane met him at the register, all smiles.
“Well, I had an armful of bodyguard that I couldn’t get around, so guess I was stuck there. His grip was pretty tight.”
Cas simply smiled down at the chat he was now a part of, smile widening as he saw the chat name was “Idiot Squad”. Their photo was already uploaded.
Cas was fully hard again, matching Dean, and both were dripping with pre-come, allowing them to slide together deliciously.
But Dean was genuinely curious now, putting on his seatbelt and wiping his eyes.
Alastair was in a car further along on their route, he got into position.
Dean smiled as he undid Cas’ restraints on that side, casually kicking Rasputin into the face as he went around the chair. He pulled Cas upright, pulling Cas’ arm over his shoulder while Dean bore the majority of his weight. Cas did his best to stay conscious as he clutched Dean.
The judge was keeping a close eye on the clock as it came to a few seconds before 5pm. He addressed the court. “As we seem to be reaching our deadline, I have no choice but to declare….”
"Ok, sleep well Sammy. Come on Cas."
He opened his eyes and smiled wide at what he could see in the dim light. Dean was now flat on his back, with Cas stretched out on top of him. Cas had his face buried in the centre of Dean’s chest, cheek to skin, right over his heart. He had managed to worm his right hand under Dean’s neck, the other clutching the back of Dean’s right shoulder, curling up from underneath, while hugging him soundly. How the hell was he holding Dean so tightly when he was sound asleep? Their legs were tangled together, with nothing pressing into Dean’s wound, thankfully. Cas’ breath ghosted along Dean’s bare chest in a delicious way. Dean’s left hand held Cas’ lower shoulder. Dean snorted softly when he noticed Cas was wearing a t-shirt and pyjama pants, the dork. And how the hell was his hair already so messy?
Dean sat wide-eyed like a crazed rabbit momentarily, adjusting himself before opening his water bottle. “I’d give it a damn good try though, Jesus Christ!” He splashed half the bottle into his face.
Cole tightened his hold on his gun nevertheless. Dean laughed away to himself as they pulled into a narrow street. There were parked cars close to each side. Gabriel rubbed his palms down his legs again. He had an awful feeling that something was coming. The agents nervously looked out the windows. The whole van was tense.
“I remember shooting at you in a Jaguar.”
Dean watched him with amusement. “Really? You think that’s necessary?”
By this time, Cas was back on his motorbike with his helmet, zipping through the streets.
“You do know, Cas, that you have made a very formidable name for yourself in hitman circles?”
After convincing himself that Cas really wasn't all that pretty (who was he kidding???), he was thankful his busy schedule kept him away from everyone in his office for most of the week. He needed to forget that disaster quickly. Charlie hadn't been any help at all, not interested in putting his mind at ease. And he had no idea what to get Cas for Secret Santa, but she wouldn't help him here either, insisting he talk to Cas himself first. It was increasingly invading his thoughts, making him even more anxious, this was the last thing he needed.
Garth was held firmly in place, crushed against the table. “There must be some… other lesson I could teach…” Chuck held out his hand, and a gun was placed into his grasp. On seeing this, Garth fought harder to stand. “NO!”
Dean watched Cas’ recovery through the photos and videos. The crutches gradually disappeared, his walk became less shuffling. Cas began to slowly look better after his multiple surgeries. His leg wound had been badly infected from the dirty shovel so healing was very slow, not that he could walk much with the bullet wound anyway. Dean was glad their whole makeshift family was looking after Cas so well. Rowena even popped up in the photos on a few visits, understanding that they all wanted to be near Dean even if they couldn’t all go to see him.
Cas’ frown had dissolved into an expression of disbelief. “But….” His voice faded away.
Cas glanced at Dean sourly. Dean giggled and sauntered off into the terminal as their ferry was announced.
When he guiltily rubbed the back of his neck, she got up, took his coat and held it out ready for his arms. "Come on. And I do mean right now."
Dean panted softly. “I hope you’re prepared, Cas. A relationship with me involves an obscene amount of sex. And I do mean obscene. In all sorts of ways. I hope you’re extra flexible. We might even break a few beds. The current record is 4. Think you can keep up?” Cas could barely speak, grasping at Dean as he completely rocked his world, managing to stammer out, “B-b-bring it.” Dean smiled when he saw the force of his hips was pushing Cas further up the bed on each thrust. Cas held a hand up above him to brace himself off the headboard, which was thumping loudly against the wall.
They exited into the basement car park, where a gleaming Rolls Royce sat nearby. Crowley brightened up immediately. “That’s my car.”
Cas nodded and hurried after Dean. Charlie shared a look with Jess and Sam. “They could be very very cute together. Right?? Shall we?” Conspiratorial grins were shared as they continued through the house.
Cas shook his head. “No, I got stood up. Again. I’m not good at relationships, or people, probably due to my past.”
Cas could feel a hand on his face as he jolted awake with a start. That really was not the best thing to do as his head was immediately swimming. He held his hands up to each temple to try and stop the spinning, but hissed with pain as he hit off the burns. He tried to open his eyes but it was too bright, so he pulled off the cloth from his forehead to put over them instead, batting away the hand tugging on it.
“Ah shit. This fucking hurts.”
Dean had gotten a long way down the street causing Alastair and Interpol to run back for their vehicles instead.
Cas looked through the spy hole and opened the door quietly, wordlessly taking the proffered basket and bag. He nodded to the owner and shook his hand in thanks, checked his watch and held up one finger. He then closed the door. Cas came back into the room, putting everything on the table, briefly checking behind the curtain, noticing the setting sun. He hadn’t gotten this much sleep in a long time, he felt almost normal.
What the hell Winchester?? Dean snapped out of it. "Sorry, yes, hello!" He furiously shook his hand. He just knew that Castiel already thought he was a freak.
Cas nodded, smiling sadly.
“You shot early, we said on three.”
Cas was still in place, rubbing his forehead with bloodshot eyes. He rummaged in the bag that was now at his feet. Dean dropped the clothes by the locker and flopped onto the bed, landing spreadeagled in the centre. He gave a big happy sigh, turning to look at Cas. His eyes were so droopy now.
“Hey, you’re the one that fed and watered me, gave me medical supplies and let me sleep for hours and hours. I blame this good mood on you.” Dean bopped him on the nose for the last word.
“No problem, brother. In you go.” The staff member pulled back the curtain, allowing Cas to step into the darkness beyond.
Despite his naps, Dean was massively tired all of a sudden. Definitely time for bed. He was a bit nervous of how Cas would take his confession, but didn’t think they’d be able to talk about it tonight anyway, with the guy being so wiped. Dean was just glad he’d had the courage to do it in the first place. He gathered up the clothes piles, and hobbled out of the bathroom.
Dean cocked an eyebrow over his shoulder, wondering what had happened. He quickly hunkered down as shots were fired at him again by Alastair. Dean’s crazed eyes landed on the flare gun discarded on the ground. He picked it up, checked it, and righted himself as soon as there was a shooting lull. He took quick aim and fired it directly through Alastair’s open windows. The car filled with smoke and curses as they tried to deal with it. Dean giggled to himself, making sure his boat was staying the right course. Alastair’s car spun wildly, stopping at the next junction with a bridge. They fled the car, coughing.
Cas drove out onto the road. Dean finally stopped laughing long enough to breathe. “You definitely said
"All right, geez! You're not the queen here you know." He put on his coat and followed her out.
He scooted back, aiming at Dean’s head, “Don’t run!” Dean eyed him stoically.
Cas heaved a shaky sigh, angling slightly so one eye could look up at Dean. “I don’t know.”
“Apologies, I had to make some preparations, Mr Crowley. Mr Crowley!” Cas grabbed him just as he got to the glass door. He held on firmly, stopping Crowley in his tracks. “It’s best if I go through doors first. Okay?”
“Check that, make it the fire department.”
Cas looked at it distrustfully for a moment. “Now or never, Cas. I swear to God, if that drops and that piece of pie is wasted….”
“Give me a gun!”
Cas suddenly gasped awake loudly against Dean, legs bucking, grabbing at him weakly. “AAAHHH!! FUCK!”
The vendor was startled by the gunfire, crouching down. Everyone in the seats, and along the street, ducked for cover. Cas didn’t even flinch, his back to the action, throwing his hands and eyes up in the air. “
“Okay.” Cas did as he was told and settled back. He looked around slightly, making out a dim bedroom. Dean had merely turned the light away so it wasn’t completely dark. Cas’ eyebrow twitched slightly of its own accord. Fucking electricity. He looked back to Dean, who had returned the cold cloth to Cas’ brow, resuming his stroking of Cas’ cheek softly, smiling at him. Dean was sitting in a chair by the bed, where Cas was propped up with several pillows. Cas stared back at him in wonder, a soft smile of his own on his lips.
Dean smiled wide, pressing a soft kiss to Cas’ cheek while he eyed up Cas’ forehead scars, rubbing them gently with his thumb. “I couldn’t stay away from you, Cas. Told you I’d see you soon, Sunshine.” Dean’s eyes snapped back to his, and Cas gave the gummy wide smile Dean loved so much. Dean looked deeply into his eyes, moving slowly, catching Cas’ lips once more. Dean pressed himself more fully into Cas, his hands beginning to rove. With Cas’ noises, Dean knew he was completely on board with this.
Dean took two suit bags carefully from her, zipping down each slightly to look inside. Absolutely perfect. Dean winked at Rowena, fist bumping her. “Add it to my tab? Let the team know my progress?”
Dean pulled him through the front of the building, helping him to step over the multiple dead bodies as they went. An alarm was blaring from somewhere inside. As they passed through the shattered front door, people were screaming and running around the street. Three smashed cars littered with bullet holes smoked just outside. Several dead bodies were draped across them.
“Oh! It’s a secret! That makes me feel
“How about your career? Your precious career? Do this job for me, and I’ll get you back to elite status.”
His eyes met the sight of an intensely attractive man, dancing seductively to the beat, not caring he was alone. He was wearing a tight t-shirt and jeans. Cas was stopped shock still for a moment, luckily snapping out of it and looking away before the man could see him acting like an idiot.
“Who was holding a knife to my clients throat.”
He pointed down the hall, apologetically saying, “It was all we had left.”
"My dear Garth, I'm afraid that he doesn't have a choice in this matter. He has already been entered and his name may have already been allotted. It would be terrible luck for him to mess with the sanctity of the beloved holiday tradition of Secret Santa."
“And the guys who started tracking you a few blocks ago.”
Cas was taken aback, his face fell. “Um….what?”
Cas holstered his gun again, ignoring the sound of a body hitting the floor far below. “You were saying?” They carried on through the walkways.
The slide one was beautiful chaos. Mercifully, they were all in frame, at different levels, but all looked elated and happy, mid-water sprinkle. As Sam, Jess, Charlie and Cas were laughing at their facial expressions on screen, Dean had a quiet word with the sales person. He leaned back on the counter, watching his friends happily. He was glad to see that Cas had come out of his misery bubble. He was very very handsome, especially when he smiled. How anyone could stand him up for a date was beyond Dean. The dude was drop dead gorgeous. He could overhear them talking about the university, figuring Cas must go there too. He looked about their age. Dean could only marvel in awe at what Cas had overcome in his life.
Dean picked up a semi automatic, checking the magazine before turning to Gabriel, “Lay down some cover fire.”
Cas rounded on Dean, getting right into his face. “Hey! Just because I want to get my business back, that doesn’t make me a shitty person. And Gabriel has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with this.”
“Punching people again, Dean?” Sam asked with raised questioning eyebrows.
“No no, not the cuffs, I’m talking about these lame ass clothes I’m wearing.” Dean moved his arms, ignoring the falling playing cards, and trying very hard to ignore the gravel in that voice.
“We need to see your cameras.” Alastair used a very low voice. He wasn’t asking.
Cas had been standing, mouth opening and closing like a fish. He tried to speak but couldn’t. Dean waved his hand in front of his eyes. Cas instantly snapped out of it and punched Dean in the face, who reeled back, grabbing his mouth.
“Awh man, you are such a little brother, it’s crazy. Going to all this trouble for your big brother’s approval.” Dean landed beside him, grinning from ear to ear.
Sweat pooled at the small of Cas’ back as he rode Dean ferociously, fucking him like his life depended on it. This was just what he needed. He felt along Dean’s chest, grabbing at him in passion. Dean was so turned on, he could barely move, just gaping with the pleasure Cas had coursing through him. He did manage to prop himself up on one elbow, hands moving to Cas’ ass while he caught his lips once more. Cas moaned appreciatively, gripping Dean’s arms.
The Russian moved like a coiled snake, punching Cas sharply into the side of his head. Cas immediately recoiled his shoulder up in pain, unable to do anything else. “Argh! Right in the fucking ear!”
Cas looked at Dean thoughtfully, not even trying to hide the slight smirk on his lips. “Been talking about me for years, eh?”
“Ccaaaasssss, I gotta do something! Can we play a game?”
"You can count on that Dean. Thanks, have a safe trip." Had Cas sounded a little bit flirty there? Perhaps had his eyes lingering on Dean's lips? Dean was so focused on being able to speak coherently around Cas that he couldn't be sure. He was such a twit that he figured he must be imaging things. Because of this Secret Santa thing he was pretty much thinking about Cas all the time. Of course he was imagining things.
Cas and Dean walked through the metal detectors in the courthouse lobby, the sounds of protestors loud outside.
Dean held up his flask and stared at it hard for a second. He frowned and turned to Cas before breaking into a laugh. “Um,
Cas watched him as he flopped back onto the bed, landing spreadeagled.
At the top, they headed down the corridor. Dean’s face grimaced in pain as he hobbled along. Cas snarked, “Now we have a new problem. I usually like to keep things a little more subtle.” Dean waved him off.
“Cas, you cannot be prepared for-“
“Hello?”
Mick nodded knowingly. “Ah, the clown? Right. I’ll give him the heads up.”
Cas nodded. “There’s a 24 hour diner not too far away.”
“So what happened to Captain Interpol?”
“Well then, Cas. Now we all know each other, see? So let’s get to it. Whaddya say?”
Gabriel fired his gun. Dean was momentarily startled until he heard a body drop behind him. He looked over his shoulder with one eyebrow raised, taking in the sight of a rogue attacker with a hole in his forehead.
A knock on the door brought Dean's eyes up. Cas gave a little wave through the glass. Dean smiled and waved him in. "Hey Cas! Great, I'm keen to see these."
dick might fit in here, but mine…….?” Dean shrugged. “Plus, I need every drop of this to tolerate your rules. Just pull the fucking car over.”
“Are you in the middle of something?”
“I’m just saying, now might be a perfect time to write that final goodbye text.”
“Yeah, I shot before they did.”
Dean couldn’t help but tease. “What’s your next trick? Gonna show me how to escape without escaping?”
Dean looked back to Cas with frantic eyes. Cas stared back at him with a small pained smile. His eyes were glazed, not in focus. Dean could see his face growing noticeably paler. “Cas? Focus on me!” Dean pushed harder. Cas grimaced in pain, grabbing one of Dean’s wrists. “Gladly.”
“What? How can he if we don’t break him out? Or how long is his sentence?”
Oh no. Oh no no no no. What the hell had he been thinking? Damn his lonely addled brain.
“People really like you, Dean. Is that how you’re so good at what you do?”
He pressed a condom and small tube of lube into Cas’ hand. Dean then turned so he faced the door instead, presenting his bare ass in all its glory. He leaned back and guided Cas’ free hand, feeling him go shock still when he found the plug buried in Dean’s ass.
“I can appreciate your concern, but I assure you, you are perfectly safe. All you need to do is exactly what I tell you.”
Cas wasn’t the biggest fan of the dark, or spiders, or clowns, fears all caused by his major past experience…… Why the hell had he come in alone???
Gabriel attempted some drunken faffing about, trying but failing to stick to the beat. Cas eyed him, keeping out of the range of his flailing limbs. He had lost sight of the hot guy while he was watching his brother. In an effort to remedy that, Cas got on his tip toes, turning about, looking everywhere but he couldn’t find the hot guy. When he turned back, Gabriel had wandered off somewhere again.
“…I never betrayed you. I never used you…”
"Cas." Dean breathed. "I can't…" He trailed off.
“And so, let us now end the charade.” Chuck held both arms out. “The charges against me are entirely correct.” Several people stood in both loud anger and protest. Cas dropped his arms, standing straighter, ready for anything. He didn’t like what his instincts were telling him.
“Thanks to you.”
They were close to Coventry before Dean spoke again. “So, got any family, Gabey? Any loved ones or… siblings perhaps?”
"So, what are we getting our Secret Santa people? Garth? I know you have Becky from accounting, don't even try and deny it."
Cas was hurting so much that he closed off his own face as Gabriel spoke. Cas swallowed before speaking. “Good.”
He pulled the bike into a wheelie to slow it down enough to disarm and kick over one goon running after Dean, who was still scrambling to stay on the tram. Cas slung the gun strap over his shoulder and sped up. Dean stayed clung to the window, looking for plan B, pausing to smile at the small child calmly surveying him through the glass. The tram passed over a bridge that was blocked for other vehicles and pedestrians, and slowed down enough on the slope for Dean to hop down and run along the side of a canal.
Dean’s heart ached at the toothy smile Cas threw him. Fuck, he was so beautiful. He hoped he’d put many more such smiles on his face. Dean turned to his food and tea, while Cas sampled his own.
Dean laughed, leaning back against the railing and crossing his arms with mirth. “Really? And how’d that go?”
"Could you have a look at these for the safari feature? I dusted off some of my old prints, I thought one of them might be useful?….If you want. I don't mind."
“A secluded B&B, grab some proper sleep, then we head to the ferry on the back roads once it gets dark again. We wouldn’t make it tonight.”
“Yeah. They do that. They’re dicks.” Dean smiled down at him, rubbing down his back. “Shall we continue on? The sooner we get out, the sooner I can get you a drink to calm your nerves.”
“What for?”
Cas headed back to his hotel room, still so sad that he had to wait to see Dean. It had already been such a damn long six months. He thought he may as well get to sleep, to make their reunion come all the sooner.
Dean cracked open one eye, blearily fumbling to turn off that fucking alarm. He blindly punched the screen until it stopped, settling down again with a happy huff. It was only then that he noticed Cas was stretched out on top of him again, face tucked into his chest like before, with the blanket almost completely over his head. His hands fidgeted around Dean, head twitching. Dean squeezed Cas slightly. “Go back to sleep, Cas. I’m here.” He got no response, but felt Cas’ breathing even out again. Dean stroked through Cas’ soft locks gently, wondering again how he had ever gotten so lucky.
Cas gasped loudly, pulled out almost all the way and snapped himself back in with force. Fuck, it was so tight. Dean cried out with pleasure, hanging his head and settling in to enjoy the ride.
much better.”
Cas looked into the rearview mirror, locking eyes with his client. “Thank you for agreeing to an earlier departure time, Mr. Kurasawa. I’m honoured that you and your wives have entrusted a Triple A Protection Service today.”
Meanwhile, Dean had banked down the road, turning into a gap in a hedge. The cars followed close behind, shooting at him constantly. Dean whooped loudly and found himself driving along a wide avenue in a park, the path ahead filled with strolling people and cyclists. He beeped loudly, trying to get them to move, but the sound of gunshots did more than he ever could. People ran wildly about trying to get out of their way in time.
“What the hell is all of this?”
“It’s in my pocket. I’ll put it on later before court. I don’t like wearing them much, too constricting, too much ease of access. Let’s call it… professional paranoia.” He flicked up his shirt collars, absently scratching along his collar bone. He watched Cas finish his own blue tie knot, completely unaware of what his open shirt was doing to the bodyguard. “Ready to go, Cas?”
He shook his head in terror. Cas nodded back at him insistently, face crazed, the whites of his eyes wide. “Yes!” Cas pulled harder on the chain.
“Have you ever met Dukhovich?”
Dean outright laughed. “Shit, Cas, I
“Your lawyer said he didn’t have any contact with you today. If you know where your brother is, you need to tell us, for his own safety.”
“Not much left really. Cole is in one of the next two rooms. He moves about. Then it’s just the big slide out and you’re done. They spray water on you. So no big scares left, you’re mostly finished.”
The brief moments they lingered have caused Cas' face to whiten further in the cold. His eyes were electric. Once the scarf was snuggly wrapped around him, Dean could only stare. He had indeed chosen the right shade of blue. Cas looked amazing. Dean was getting all hot and bothered. Surely a scarf couldn't be the entire cause for that. Cas always looked amazing. He could admit that much to himself, he did have eyes after all. Cas practically purred as he pulled on his gloves.
Dean singsonged with him, following him into the hallway. “-no adjacent rooftops. You’re not the only observant son of a bitch here.”
Sam continued, “So, you’re single?” He eyed up Cas’ Pride pin, as Cas nodded again.
“Lots and lots of black coffee please. And the full English. Thanks.”
"SECRET SANTA!!!!!"
The sound of sirens drew near as they drove off in the opposite direction.
“Triple A. Yeah, it sounds like you ought to be selling life insurance or fixing my transmission with that shit.”
Cas stopped and turned back to Dean, arms out in irritation. “What now?”
“Sammy? Well balls.” Dean splashed more whiskey on his leg, and started to stitch.
“Are you serious? Have you any idea how stupid you sound? You’ve lost my brother and need my help to find him? Um…. No. Definitely not. Get fucked.”
“I don’t suppose I can have a gun?”
“To the ferry.”
Jody remembered the phone in her hand. “Sorry. Gotta go.”
“No no no no, no odds on that jump. We can’t make that.” The neighbouring building was a bit too far away, covered in scaffolding.
“Mmm hhmmm, now that’s a good looking Jag.” Cas crossed his arms, eyeing it longingly.
“Well, how was everything for you?”
Gabriel became firm friends with Kevin and Charlie immediately, once he knew they were Dean’s background team, and had looked after Cas so much over the years. They stuck around the Hague for a spell while Cas was in hospital to keep him company, only leaving to take a road trip to Amsterdam. They greeted Sam warmly when they collected him from prison, bringing him back to the Hague to meet Cas, after a visit to Rowena of course.
“Mr Dukhovich, I order you to stop!”
Cas ignored him and immediately went to the opposite side of the room, and another keypad set in the wall.
As the night passed by, Cas was both excited and sad, happy he got to see Dean so soon, but also melancholy that it was still going to be a few days. He got quieter and quieter, fidgeting more and more. Even Charlie and Kevin gushing about them all soon going to the Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City couldn’t lift Cas’ spirits. When Gabriel, Sam, Charlie and Kevin excitedly clinked another round of glasses together in triumph, Cas excused himself. Gabriel nodded with sympathy, bidding him a good night.
“I need you to be quiet, Mr. Winchester.”
“Yeah.” Dean turned to the waiting tech. “Go to FTP site Colt11283.”
“The trial of former Belarusian President Chuck Dukhovich took an uncertain turn this week. Having recently survived a dioxin poisoning attempt, authorities are keeping close…..”
Sam was reading in his cell, when they wheeled in a phone unit. “Mr Winchester, your attorney.”
"Charlie! Both of our names were supposed to be completely secret!" Garth looked aghast.
At the main city hospital, a group of doctors in a foyer watched the chaos of the bomb on the news. One doctor peeled away from the group, picking up an intercom. “Emergency, it’s a local critical one situation. We need immediate air response.”
One guy impatiently pulled out a knife and cut the strap by Cas’ throat. The other roughly yanked it off his head. “Or there’s that short cut.”
“Shut up. I get lonely. You’re just as bad, hugging a pillow. How can you sleep while holding someone that tightly?”
“Sustained.” announced the Judge. Chuck nodded knowingly.
The office was pretty much deserted as they made their way to the lifts. Garth met them there, giving his usual little wave of greeting as they stepped on.
Dean moved his free hand down, watching Cas’ face closely, leaving no doubt where his exploring fingers were headed. Dean trailed along Cas’ bare abdomen agonisingly slowly, making Cas whimper. Dean palmed at Cas’ crotch, capturing his lips to swallow the needy groans Cas let out at finally having some blessed friction to properly rut against. Cas squirmed as Dean slowly unzipped him, pulling his pants down just enough, freeing his trapped cock. Cas yelled in pleasure when Dean got his hand on him fully for the first time, gripping him firmly. “S-sorry, it’s just been so-so long.”
“The judge is not giving us any wiggle room, you don’t have a lot of time now.”
Dean waved his gun for emphasis. “Cas, I would threaten to bust a cap in your ass if you don’t give up that wheel, but we both know I couldn’t and wouldn’t do that to you. Come on, we’re running out of time.”
Zach made one last play, launching himself at Gabriel, smashing him into the far wall.
“I got it just as the teeth fell. Your face!” She turned the phone to show him, as he put the teeth back in his pocket. “Ok, ok. Another one. Hhhmm, vampire. Because of the teeth, wanna pull your cape across the lower part of your face and make evil eyes? A bit Phantom of the Opera? The other hand can be in a claw shape again maybe?”
“Okay, three shooters, in a row, all lit up. So what do you want to do?” A rogue bullet hit near the puddle of fuel, with enough spark for the fuel to catch fire, unknown to Dean and Cas.
Cas moaned slightly, face still covered with the towel. Dean ran to him with concern, gently pulling it off of him. He cupped Cas’ face until Cas was able to focus his eyes on him.
“Humour me.”
Dean opened the door at the top of the tower, right next to the large clock. He removed his hat, rubbing through his hair to admire the view for a moment, eyes searching the windows on the opposite building. He wedged his feet and leaned out over the ledge with some paint and a brush.
“Well good, I’ll be safer on my own. As will you.” Strong anger bubbled up in Dean. They were now shouting across the attic space at each other.
“I don’t have the time for this, Cas. I have a job I need you to do.”
One car pulled forward, nudging up beside Dean’s right. It slammed into him, but Dean easily kept control with a few wheel turns. Dean cocked his head, looked back to the road while holding up a gun to the car and shooting out his passenger window. The driver gasped, leaning back. Dean’s bullet caught the passenger in the side of the head. The driver smashed through a small prefab, but was still very much in the game.
“That’s what I thought. You’re lucky there are cameras here, and that the mask took most of the blow. Now get out of my sight.”
Cas shook his head with disappointment. Just then, several rounds were shot at them from the car a little ways down the road behind them that neither had noticed approaching.
“I was working a few long jobs in a row right before Gabriel called me. Haven’t been able to stop in a good long while. I’ll be fine. Go. Look after yourself. One of those bags has medical supplies to change your dressing. Need any help with that?” Cas looked up at the last part.
“Thanks so very much, Cas.
No one brought up the option of phone calls, since video calls were out of the question. Dean thought talking with his family and not being able to see them or be with them would kill him. He was just about surviving on what they had. Gabriel understood, and made sure everyone else did too, so they wouldn’t pester Dean about it.
Cas looked up at him from the couch for a moment in surprise before getting back to his task of flicking playing cards at Dean’s unconscious face. He leaned forward to get a better angle.
“It’s nearly time to get moving, dearie. Is he still asleep?”
Dean stood with a smile, palming his own crotch for some relief. He grabbed Cas by the hips again, exchanging their places so that Dean was now in front of the door. He dropped his pants just enough, licking his palm, stroking himself as Cas watched with a hilariously dropped jaw.
“West is the wrong direction.”
“You said you wouldn’t run. You think I’m a fucking idiot?”
As the agents ran past Cas, he heard screaming in his ear.
Dean punched the goon savagely in the face with the helmet, and threw the entire bucket of water at Rasputin. While he was spluttering, Dean stepped in real close, grabbed his wrists and turned the still active jump cables to his own bare chest. Rasputin screamed as he couldn’t shake Dean’s strength. He sank to his knees, squealing as he was electrocuted.
Cas discreetly looked behind himself on both sides, making sure the guy was indeed looking at him. When he glanced back, the man was laughing slightly, nodding at him, giving him one finger gun and a wink. Cas gave a shy smile in disbelief. The guy made an ‘oooh’ face, licking his lips. Cas rubbed the back of his neck nervously, briefly looking about again to truly make sure this was actually happening.
“Yeah, and you. Welcome to fugitive life.”
“Yeah, I’m fine, peachy even. Not concussed at all. Well, there’s your guy.” He pointed to Dean. Gabriel breathed out a relieved breath. “Thank you, Cas.” Gabriel pulled him down for a tight hug. Cas righted himself afterwards, wincing. He had to tell his brother something, face to face, here and now.
“All right, is it not enough cocaine or too much?” Cas snarked as the lift doors opened.
When ready, Dean gave himself a quick once over in the mirror, tipping his hat to himself and making a pose with the whip. Damn, he should watch those movies again, Indy was smoking. He came out of his room to find Cas' door closed and headed for the library instead, cracking his whip for fun as he went.
Outside, Cole led the charge, taking out many of the enemy. He managed to get one of the nearby vehicles going and wedged bricks onto the pedals, leaving it run free. As it sped up the street towards a cluster of their attackers, he shot at it until it exploded in their faces, taking out one of their vehicles too. Cole pumped his fist in triumph, not noticing the guy behind him. He was shot through the head, dead before he hit the ground.
“Dude, I said I was sorry that they found us and your new car got made. Who knows, maybe your intricately detailed plan would have worked. So what about your other plan?”
Gabriel got up and ran off, leaving Cas staring off into the distance in partial disbelief.
“Yeah, you don’t have that power.”
“Dude, I freaking
This flat image that Cas had constructed in his head of Dean over the years had been broken down steadily over the last few days.
Occasionally Cas would stop texting abruptly, but this was always followed with a photograph from someone else showing Cas passed out, in various poses, but always with the phone clutched to his face. His recovery exercises and drugs were doing a number on him, and with Sam being the only one who had the strength to carry him into bed, he was inevitably in some of the photos too. Dean had so many sleeping images of Cas, he didn’t know which one he favoured the most. His heart warmed when he saw he was still a cuddler.
Charlie laughed, “Yes!!”
Dean silenced three more alarms before he heard a soft knock on the door. Hating to do it, Dean slid out from under Cas, giggling while he evaded the grasping hands, kissing Cas’ messy bed head as he grunted grumpily. Dean unlocked and opened the door, holding his finger up to his lips as he stepped out to meet Rowena in the hall, closing the door softly behind him.
“I have never once tried to kill you, Cas. I swear. It’s quite the opposite. I really really like-like you, and I truly admire you. What you do. Saving people, protecting clients, it must be nice to have a cause. We should join forces, we’d be like the A-Team. But we’d be two short in the field, as my team are strictly behind the scenes. Ok, I’ll stop babbling now.”
Dean wrestled his way into the group between Sam and Charlie so he was directly in front of Cas. “Here you go, come on, have a look.”
Crowley pushed past him, grabbing his jacket, heading for the door.
Like speaking to a child. “I
Cas was momentarily taken aback, but began to chew. It did taste wonderful. He hummed approvingly. Dean nodded excitedly. “Right?” Cas put his nearly empty cup down, and turned to his eggs and toast.
Dean chuckled with a watery smile, taking Cas’ face in both of his shaking hands, cradling him gently. He stared deep into Cas’ pained eyes. “Don’t you even think about going anywhere on me. Again. You hear me?”
“It’s been years, I missed the closeness. I always cuddle a pillow. Shaddup.”
“Were you prepared for that assault, motherfucker?”
Chuck landed on top of a parked car below, the building high enough to make the fall instantly fatal. Several injured people were slowly making their way down the steps of the courthouse next to the car, startled by the noise of Chuck’s landing. Garth was helping a man with a wounded leg, looking over in stunned silence as he recognised the body. “Dukhovich! That’s Dukhovich!”
“I just cut you out!” Gabriel shouted, stopping Cas in his tracks. Gabriel’s voice then changed, becoming low and close to tears. “Because you couldn’t forgive me for something I didn’t even do.”
Rasputin darted in and pressed both cables to Cas’ temples, electrocuting him. Cas screamed in pain as the wet towel smoked and sizzled. The electrical sounds dissipated when the goon whipped off the towel. Cas was sprawled back in the chair, gripping his knees. He gagged and coughed painfully, glaring up at Rasputin. “I really don’t fucking like you.” He spat at him.
Several armed Interpol agents led a shuffling still-chained Dean through the secure underground structure to the waiting armed escort team. Dean now had a bullet proof vest and light Interpol jacket with a beanie over his prison jumpsuit. Director Mills and Zach, the Assistant Director, stood by.
Dean shook his head with a little smile as he opened the paper. The hell kind of name was that? "Cas-teee-el?"
“His— what??” Sam almost managed to keep a straight face. Almost. But his breakdown was spectacular. The grumpy faced officials banged the cell door behind them as Sam rolled around on the ground, absolutely howling with unrestrained laughter.
Cas did as he was bid. Charlie adjusted her settings just right to catch a stunning portrait of Cas, his blue eyes popping wonderfully. Charlie giggled, looking at the end result. “Oh Cas, you don’t have a bad bone in your body, do you? They look more crazy eyes than evil, but still, you looking fine, if I do say so my own damn self. Oooh, Jess, come on, let’s do awkward prom. I’ll be the guy.” They posed expectantly. “Come on boys, who’s gonna join?”
“Give me an awkward smile, Cas. And put your hands on Dean’s arms.” Sam asked gently. Cas bared some teeth helplessly. He knew he was blushing but couldn’t control it. He tried to steady his breathing. Sam took a few more shots from different angles before he relented. Charlie then wanted the same pose with just Sam and Jess.
“There’s nothing to forgive!”
“It’s a Dutch prison, Dean. What are they gonna do, beat me with a clog? Besides, I’m in solitary anyways. Catching up on my reading.”
Dean somehow pulled Cas deeper down into him, speeding up his hips with his hands. Cas snapped and was spilling down Dean’s throat in seconds, back arched to the wall, head heavenward as he yelled through his climax. Dean swallowed every drop tightly, popping off of Cas’ softening cock with a lewd slurp when he got oversensitive. Dean stood, wiping his mouth with a satisfied smirk as he eyed his lover.
He brought the phone to his ear, speaking in a cheery voice.
A little while later, Gabriel was watching the events play out on the television news as he stared down at the ringing phone in his hand. Dean was in the bathroom, cutting up along his pants, trying to attend to his gunshot wound. He could see Gabriel through the partly open door, and shouted to him.
“And you said,
Without breaking the kiss, Dean slid his fingers under Cas’ shirt, teasing the sensitive skin as he curled around and began undoing every button up along it incredibly slowly. When he undid the last, his fingers tickled along Cas’ nipples, along his pecs, skirted his collar bones before resting back at his nipples again. Cas broke off with a low moan, gasping at the touch. Dean grinned, leaning in to Cas’ ear, groaning before he could speak as Cas ran his fingers through his hair while rutting against him unashamedly. At last, Dean pulled his lips away from Cas’ neck to whisper, “Hope you don’t mind topping, Angel.” Cas nodded furiously.
“No.”
Yikes, that was pretty bad. But he had been busy preparing for that meeting, and that conference call, and that report….. He was definitely too busy. He vaguely became aware of Charlie snapping her fingers repeatedly in his face.
Back in the van, another agent shouted at Gabriel. “Agent Novak! God dammit, there’s too many!” He was dropped by a shot to the head that came through the open door above them. Gabriel spun, aimed, and took out the sniper through the opening. He shot again, dinging the door which banged closed. Gabriel flopped back, only then noticing that Dean was removing the chains from his legs, almost completely free.
“No, no, Cas. Nothing that extravagant. Just a good quality suit in an old reused bag. It’s on me. A gift.” He stepped into Cas’ space, silently pulled an Armani tag from his neck, tossing it in the bin. Dean swallowed, seeing how close he was to Cas now, and quickly stepped back, rubbing the back of his neck nervously.
“Christ will you ever shut up! Huh? Why’s everything always about family with you?”
“Gabriel. What I’m trying to say is—” Dean rolled his eyes at the big long unnecessary pause.
“Cas.”
“The fucking audacity.” Dean fought with the wheel, nudging forward enough to get back on the flat.
Dean hadn’t been paying the best attention to the road with his eavesdropping. He accidentally crashed head first into a low road sign with a concrete base. The car stopped dead. Cas smashed right through the windshield, leaving a massive hole in the passenger side. He smoothly went with the fall, landing and rolling over on his shoulder to stand upright, briefly flailing his arms to catch his balance. He was perfectly fine, save for a few glass cuts along his forehead. He held his arms out and looked down at himself in disbelief, patting everywhere to make sure. He looked up to Dean, yelling loudly, “JESUS CHRIST! REALLY?” His eyes looked a little crazed.
“So, Cas. What’ll we talk about?”
It was only a few moments until he was done. He righted himself again as the bells started to ring. Sam was slumped in his cell, absently looking across to the Rijksmuseum when he heard the bells. He thought he saw something, and went to the window to make sure he was right. Yes, there, in big white letters, BITCH. He could see Dean flipping him off too. Sam chuckled to himself. Jerk. Sam waved and motioned for him to go. Dean bowed and closed the wooden shutter.
Dean rounded the car and barely got his own damaged door closed. Once Dean was buckled in, he grinned at Cas. “To answer your question, I’m me.”
“Tell that to Gabriel.”
Dean let them all stare at each other for several seconds before tutting Cas, gently shoving him slightly so Dean had room to step in. Cas willed the ground to open up, staring at the ceiling.
