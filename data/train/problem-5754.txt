“It sure is. Well, if you ignore the existential crisis that this eternal blackness tends to trigger, that is.“
But nothing happened.
“No, please“ Tony tried again.
Steve couldn’t help to be impressed by that.
It wasn’t exactly an uncomfortable silence, but it was a bit awkward and made Tony nervous.
A person covered completely in a black cloak was moving towards them.
“Hey what’s your Patronus, Cap?” Tony joked, but didn’t lower his blaster.
She nodded along, “ah; a kindred spirit.”
“wait- sweetheart, you’re shaking. What’s wrong?”
Five-day suspension.
“Yeah, this honeymoon phase is gonna be a
He couldn’t breathe. His chest was concaving in on itself, there was a jagged gap where his heart should be, someone had their hands in his chest on a dirty bench in a cave and he
Steve grinned sheepishly, following Sam as he began to wind his way around the masses of people and find their table. “I’m tough,” he said, pride in his voice. It was true- he had learned to be, over the course of his life. It was the only way he’d been able to make it through.
Across the room, Bucky gagged loudly. “Not in my house, you kinky weirdos! Go roleplay somewhere else.”
That tended to happen when they didn’t actually
“I’m sorry,” Steve waved a hand and cut him off before he could say anything more, “but is this really any of your business?”
“Steve,” Tony said again, his voice soft, “come here.”
To his left, Sam whistled slowly under his breath. “That’s… wow, that’s great, Steve,” he said, a soft look on his face, “I’m glad you finally worked that out with him. And he’d hang the moon for you too, y’know.”
Steve blinked once, trying to make sense of the words. “Uhh- okay then. It’s nice to, uhm, talk to you again. That’s- that’s what this is, right? I mean I’d assume so, but I don’t know, I don’t really
Okay. So that had probably been the stupidest decision of his life.
As he sunk to his knees and leaned back against the couch with angry tears springing from his eyes, he realised that he wasn’t sure there was another moment in his life when he’d ever hated himself more.
He forced his legs to work, running with Steve as the man raised his shield behind them and threw the two of them forward, just as an explosion ripped through the hall and a concentrated detonation hit the armor Tony had been standing in only seconds ago.
All of these things went around and around in Steve’s head as they flew back to the East coast, and continued to do so on an endless loop right until they touched down. It was easier that way. He couldn’t let his mind stay blank; it was a skill he’d never been able to master, much to Natasha’s despair. But he could distract himself. Think about wall panelling and chest infections and Agent Leonards’ home life so that he didn’t have to think about the man he’d just heartlessly betrayed sitting in a cell a few floors beneath him. It was like the stupid grandfather’s clock in Fury’s office all over again. Anything to take his mind off what was really going on in front of him.
Bucky just nodded, subdued. “Okay, get it out-“
Afterward; when Tony was spent and exhausted against Steve’s chest, curled into the space where he fit perfectly, Steve let himself check the phone that he’d ignored pretty much all day. There were some updates from Pepper, saying how all the demos and PR trips had gone smoothly, and the predicted figures were hitting above expected already. He checked the time: still a couple of hours before they released it to the public—apparently there were people queuing out the door for it, which was fairly typical in a Stark Product. Tony’s designs were the best in the world and Steve didn’t blame people for getting enthusiastic over them.
Steve needed to stop overthinking it. Tony liked him- that much was obvious. Steve was allowed to have this: it was about damn time, after all. And on more than one occasion, both Bucky and Peggy had accused him of doing his level best to sabotage his own happiness, so maybe for once he needed to let himself just… have this. Take it for what it was and not try and reason his way out of it.
Steve pulled his eyes open and looked up, stifling a yawn with his hand. He probably looked like shit: his hair was all over the place, and Tony’s jacket had undoubtedly left creases all over his cheek- but still, Tony was looking at him with that soft, open look in his eyes, and it sent the now-familiar buzz of butterflies shooting down his stomach and into the tips of his toes, making them curl under his socks. Tony grinned down at him, and his fingers tugged playfully at the horizontal piece of Steve’s bangs that refused to lay flat. “You have never looked hotter, Steve,” he declared quietly, a playful gleam to his eyes.
“I’m an asshole,” he repeated, “and you don’t- you don’t wanna be getting caught up with me, Steve. Believe me. I was… I was being selfish, okay, but your b- but I realized that Barnes had a point. I
Okay. Now
Right. He probably shouldn’t jump to the worst conclusion possible immediately after hearing only one word. That was just dumb.
Across the room, Steve was rocking Peter gently in his arms, humming another Gaelic lullaby that he knew from memory. Tony loved it when Steve sang those lullabies in his off-tune voice, and it worked like a dream, always sending Peter off to sleep with the strangely enrapturing words. Steve caught Tony watching him and smiled a little bashfully, tongue tripping over one of the lyrics as he lowered Peter down into the crib with practiced grace, tucking the blanket up over his body and then making sure no limb was exposed. Tony loved the care Steve put into every action regarding Peter. There wasn’t a single movement that wasn’t accounted for and thought over; Steve moved like a ballet dancer even when he wasn’t around the baby, but whenever Peter was in his arms, it was like all that dialled up to eleven. He held him softly, just like Tony had taught him. He combed Peter’s hair meticulously, making sure any tangles were dealt with painlessly, even if it took him double the time.
Steve snuck a hand around Tony’s wrist before he could sit up, shaking his head in amusement and pulling Tony back down for another kiss. “No takebacks now,” he informed the other man, “you’re stuck with me, Stark.”
. I don’t want to mess with destiny.”
Steve stayed still, shutting his eyes and feeling Tony’s presence as the other boy rested his forehead gently against Steve’s for a few seconds, before pulling away with a tight smile and then wandering over into Bucky’s living room, slipping inside quietly. He was subdued and still upset, Steve could tell. Steve had never really experienced that sort of thing, but he knew what panic attacks felt like, and although they were different to PTSD, he still knew how long the feeling could linger for.
He glanced over to his friend and then huffed irritably. "Yeah, you are. Anyway, how did this become about me and Tony? I thought we were consoling Peggy over her shitty date?"
Tony’s eyes were wide and somewhat disbelieving as he looked at Steve. Steve was a little confused as to where he was going with all this too, but he persisted, if only to get it all off his chest. On a whim, he grabbed Tony’s hands and held tight, his fingers curling easily around the man’s slim wrists. Tony looked down at them blankly, and Steve squeezed.
“We’ve given you a shot of morphine,” Bruce followed on from her sentence, “but there was only one in the med-kit, and I’m pretty sure it’s going to wear off soon. And the gas stove ran out of fuel about ten minutes ago, so it’s gonna get pretty cold from here on out.”
Steve watched him for another second, then hummed. “We’re just gonna need to pull that all out again tomorrow,” he commented, “you know what Peter’s like about his toy selection.”
Natasha smiled like a shark, and Steve had a sudden sixth sense that something mortifying was about to occur as she bounced lightly on the balls of her feet.
“It wasn’t your fault,” was the first thing that Tony said, looking at him intently, “Steve, I know what you’re thinking-“
Eventually, Steve stepped back. Tony plucked up the courage and stared at him, feeling blood trickle down the side of his face. His ears were ringing and his whole body felt like it was burning, too hot and too cold at the same time.
But what was he supposed to do when the one who’d hurt Tony was himself? How must Tony have felt, when all that rage was turned on him?
that kept him from completely scrapping the idea.
Thor came in at that moment, eyeing up the three boys on the couch and then immediately dropping the big bowl of fries onto the coffee table. “You were doing a hand-holding sesh and didn’t even tell me?” He got to his knees in front of them and took Steve and Rhodey’s spare hands enthusiastically, so that they were all connected in a circle, Tony in the middle. He smiled at all of them, wiping another tear off his face with his shoulder.
Tony raised his eyebrows at Thanos and clenched his jaw, mouth opening, because he would never in his life let someone else had the last word. “And we’re the fucking Avengers,” he growled, before Steve’s mind was filled with a string of
For a moment, Steve thought of just lying. Telling him something normal, like a doctor’s appointment or a chore he had to get done as soon as possible.
Steve smiled, but then it turned into a small frown. “But- Tony, you can’t buy a place until you’re eighteen unless you get your parents’ permission, right?”
“Not real,” he mumbled, thinking back to what he’d been told: ground yourself. Ground yourself to reality. Show your mind it was wrong.
sign stuck to the rusted iron gates, almost entirely hidden by thick ivy and wild undergrowth.
“Do you… do you mean this?” Steve asked softly, his eyes flicking nervously around Tony’s face like he was searching for a tell, “do you really… I thought you seemed pretty- uh- unwelcoming-
“Neither did I, surprisingly. I promise I won’t put a hand on you, Stark- I just wanna talk,” Bucky said, raising his palms in a show of peace as he passed Steve.
They all continued their fire at the Robot’s front while Iron Man forced his way through the weakened section of the energy barrier at the back, and after a few more seconds Tony finally broke through, careering toward the Robot’s neck with his repulsors outstretched. Steve watched with morbid curiosity as the Robot did its best impression of a howl, suddenly realising Tony had made it through the energy barrier around it. It flailed, reaching a hand behind its back, but Tony clung on despite its attempts to dislodge it, firing a concentrated burst of blue energy right from his chest and burning through the metal on the robot’s back. “DISTRACT IT!” Tony yelled as a giant black hand clamped around his torso, and Steve didn’t have to be told twice. He flew the jet downward, JARVIS making sure that he didn’t go careening off into the ocean, and then aimed right for its face. The thing twisted wildly, whipping out a hand to cover while the other left Tony and extended outward, grabbing for the jet. Its fingers wrapped around a wing, and oh,
Steve shook his head and then pushed past Tony, his shoulder knocking heavily against his own as he did so. Tony stumbled, steadying himself against the counter and looking at the other man with wide eyes. “Steve?” He called out behind him in concern, but got no reply. Steve slammed his way out of the common room a second later, leaving Tony staring bewilderedly at the space he’d left. It had been a stupid argument, but Steve’s words had cut deep. Why had he... God, it was just a fucking
He couldn’t do this. Nothing was working, and it was going to cost him everything.
in big black lettering, hanging it from the ceiling as they all stood solemnly underneath it.
“And then there are the added impossibilities of you; a broke skinny kid from the 40′s, undergoing experiments which make you into a superhero, before crashing into the ice and being trapped in stasis for 70-odd years. Coincidentally, just in time for our paths to cross.”
Natasha nodded. “Bet this sucks ass, then,” she said bluntly, and Sam stiffened a little beside Steve, but he just laughed. Right- not one to sugar coat it, then.
Steve glared, but after a moment it softened a little. Bucky was only trying to look out for him in his own stupid way. “I don’t even know him that well, Bucky- he was just kind to me. That’s all.”
Steve lifted his head eventually, cold air filling the space he left around Tony’s neck. He stared at the mark he’d sucked into Tony’s skin, his eyes deep and full, before dragging his gaze up to Tony’s face. “Told you you wouldn’t be bad,” he declared, mouth twitching in a smile.
Steve turned; letting go of Tony and hitching his shield up. “Try not to get shot,” he murmured, before stepping in front of the smaller man and marching on ahead.
Steve’s cheeks were crimson as he let Tony tug him forward, standing up and then shuffling awkwardly onto the bed. “We might break it,” he warned, but lay down by Tony’s side all the same, fingers stroking lightly through Tony’s hair and pushing it off his face.
“Neither did you,” Steve told him, but by the way Tony’s face twisted against him, he figured that Tony didn’t quite believe that.
- “I’m fine. Sorry.”
Steve looked at him for another moment with his clenched jaw, before it dissipated a moment later, just like that. His fingers softened against his arms, becoming a gentle hold as opposed to a grip. He sighed and looked down, knocking their foreheads together. “I know you didn’t,” he said quietly, “you never do.”
“Fine- we don’t have to go to hospital,” he said eventually, and Steve smiled in relief- “but I’m taking you to my place. It’s quicker for me to get home than it would be to try and go through rush-hour traffic and back to Wilson’s.”
Seeing as Tony’s parents were on the other side of the planet by then, he felt it safe enough to invite Steve over, and they’d been lolling around in Tony’s workshop since that morning.  Now that it was around dinner-time, they were in the kitchen, having just finished preparing the food that was now cooking in the oven. Although, when Tony says
“Yeah, believe me, it wasn’t my idea,” Steve responded with a scowl, “but he… he didn’t wanna go. I couldn’t make him.”
“Bruce? Tony?” Steve asked hurriedly, knowing his voice became more strained upon the last name.
The fucking
No- in fact, he seemed to be in the medical wing of the Avengers Tower, if memory served.
“Yeah, sounds about right. You’ve been asleep for about four hours.”
Bursting through quickly, Steve threw himself into a roll and used the movement to check his surroundings. Two bodies were on the floor by the door, and three others in the whole which apparently had been blown in on the back-side of the cabin. Two resided on the far end of the room. Steve couldn’t see any of their faces, didn’t know which ones were dead and which were alive. If any were alive.
“Merry Christmas,” Bruce returned, tired smile shining on Tony and Natasha as he took both of their hands and squeezed. Tony shut his eyes and attempted to respond in kind, but he couldn’t find the energy and instead just hummed, hoping they would get the message anyway.
Tony shrugged, hand flexing by his side. “I haven’t eaten in a while. Why not?”
Steve paused, sensing where this was going and looking obstinately down at his cup, refusing to let the heat creep up on his cheeks. “Yes. But that is irrelevant, it-”
When he looked across at Steve, the man was smiling like a single star in a black sky, lighting up the world. “That’s how I feel too,” he whispered, leaning forward, “that’s…yeah.”
Steve wondered briefly if Tony always carried cigarettes with him on missions, just in case. But he didn’t ask. Instead, he just said “oh
Knowing that it was something for Steve to focus on, Tony kept it up, leaning down further until they were lying face-to-face on the soft bedsheets.
Steve laughed, burying it into Tony’s shoulder before kissing the place where his mouth met the skin. It was an absent motion. Tony liked that. “I’m good,” he said softly, “I’ll go get us something to clean up with. This might feel weird.” With a fluid motion, Steve eased out of Tony and sat up on the bed, sliding off it and heading for the bathroom. Tony lay there amongst the pillows and watched him move in that graceful, haunting way of his. It looked like there was a layer of air between his feet and the floor, like his limbs were suspended in water. It was strange, and it was beautiful. Tony wished he could watch Steve all day. Maybe something could be arranged. Steve didn’t ever have to leave this room, in fact, and they could stay here and keep doing this forever until they died.
Clint opened his mouth, obviously readying for a rant, so Steve just threw up his hands before it could escalate. “It’s fine, I don’t mind going.”
“No,” Natasha’s voice cut through firmly, “we haven’t finished running through tests yet, it’s not-”
Steve said nothing, but nodded once as Clint left the room with a tight smile and a stifled yawn. He checked his watch: 1 in the morning. It should be a point where Steve was at least feeling a little bit tired, but he wasn’t. Hadn’t done in days, really. He can’t have gotten more than two hours of sleep over the past week, if he thought about it. But he didn’t want to, either. In all honesty, he was completely terrified of what’s he’d see if he did. The memories that would rush back in like a tidal wave that he couldn’t escape from. At least when he was awake, he knew that Tony was still alive.
“Do you think you can ride on the back of my bike?” Tony asked, frowning and looking down at Steve’s still-bare chest.
Okay. Okay wait. That sounded weird. He wasn’t… it wasn’t in a creepy way! He was’t a weirdo, honestly, and the guy knew he was there. So it wasn’t like- not in a stalkerish sense.
"You’re totally smitten with him.”
Until then, he had to deal with the doctors quietly suggesting that he see a therapist whenever Steve was out of the room. Nurse Linda was a lovely lady, and Tony knew that she was only trying to help, but it really, really fucking didn’t. He didn’t need help because as it turns out, Steve hadn’t actually been abusing him. Steve had just been possessed. Such was the nature of their damned lives, he figured. Maybe if Steve had actually turned out to be an abusive piece of shit, Tony could’ve considered the therapy. But he wasn’t, and Tony could see that it was quite clearly tearing Steve up to see Tony this way, so he just wished they’d stop goddamn asking about it.
Tony chuckled to himself once more, before it merged into a little snore. Steve wondered if he’d even been awake at all whilst he’d been making that machine.
Nat stepped forward at this point, looking at Tony seriously as she read off her page. “Then it started happening more regularly. You’d refer to him as ‘my husband’ when you were looking for him, or when you wanted his attention. A lot of the time, you would do it when he wasn’t even in the room.”
“Oh my God.” Tony’s eyes widened as he moved forward, taking the little boy out of Bruce’s arms and holding Peter up with amazement. “That was Bruce’s name.” He turned his head back toward the living room. “Hey Steve! Peter really did just say Bruce’s name!”
“Widow, Hawkeye, let them through to the basement,” Steve said suddenly, stepping over another body with a wince. Tony spotted movement through one of the doors and quickly took point in front of Steve, hands raised defensively. “Fighting Enhanced in a small space when all you have are scientists and agents with minimal training is gonna end in a bloodbath. Tell them all to retreat.”
“Hey squirt- how was school?” Dad asked, when Peter dropped his bag and began making his way into the kitchen in order to make himself a bowl of cereal (he was a growing boy, okay, shut up, cereal in the afternoon was perfectly fine, his Uncle Clint did it all the time).
Tony’s brain short-circuited. That felt like a common occurrence, these days.
Steve drove his knee upward, catching Ty in the balls. He dropped like a fly and yelled in pain, and Steve already knew he’d won. His sharp elbow drove down into Ty’s back hard, and the boy tumbled to the floor. After that, it was just free-for-all. Steve wound his leg back and rammed it into Stone’s stomach, then decided that wasn’t satisfying enough and dropped to his knees, catching Ty’s arm before it could hit him and sending another jab into Ty’s nose. He was going to ruin that boy’s face forever, he was going to fucking kill him dead. Someone like that didn’t deserve to live, not when they could so easily do that to another human, one they were supposed to fucking care about—
“This is going to end terribly,” Tony declared, waving a sad little finger around, “JARVIS, make note. This is going to end very, very terribly.”
So he just leaned down and kissed him, again and again and again.
“But I was careless, too belligerent and not fucking thinking right. I made mistakes. Someone sounded the alarm, got a message over to the village centre while I was busy blowing stuff up. Probably thought I was sent by the American Government or something. Didn’t like that at all, but they knew if the Americans were coming in, they weren’t gonna escape with what they were after.” Tony swallowed and shook his head, finally looking at Steve again, his eyes filled with regret. “They decided to make a statement. Turned my Jericho Missile on themselves, and blew everyone to kingdom fucking come. And my weapons are good
They made their way into the hallway, Tony taking point with Steve and Nat behind him and Clint watching their six. It was while they were halfway down the dimly lit corridor that the next blow hit, with Thor getting in touch with them via the comm, his voice grave and breathless.
Unhealthy? Definitely. But it didn’t change things. Were someone to hurt a hair on Tony’s head, Steve would not stop until they were dead at his feet. He’d made that much clear the first time around.
“Mm, change of plans,” Thor muttered, pulling Jane back into his lap, “I accidentally got drunk instead. It was a very good sacrifice to make, I think. I’ll call a cab later.”
He spotted the blanket, folded neatly back in place on the shelf, and as he wandered over to the couch he caught sight of a small note lying in the middle of the cushions, Tony’s familiar scrawl standing out easily amongst the dull yellow.
“Don’t you get it?” Clint asked, sitting up off the floor and waving his hands around him, “look at all of us, Tony. A collection of freaks and assholes, so emotionally stunted that our therapists need therapy after dealing with us. None of us ever in a million years believed that we’d be able to find a home somewhere. Be able to find people that we could call family. But you made it possible. You worked for it when we didn’t, and you looked after us in ways that we had no idea about until months later, because you just never felt the need to mention any of it. And you could never get the memories of Iron Man back, they could be lost forever- but you’d still be the founding Avenger. You’d still be the man who didn’t give up on a bunch of psycho losers that the world called heroes.” Clint pulled a face, lying back down. “Jheeze, that was emotional. I don’t want anyone to look at me for at least three hours while I recover from that.”
God, Steve hated highschool.
Stepping out of the car and into the elevator, he undid his tie from around his neck and then pushed his sleeves up to his forearms, running through his to-do list. The results would take a little while to come through, but hopefully they would know by the end of the night, and so could call social services or... whatever it was Clint would want to do if it turned out he was the dad. Tony wasn't sure- it wasn't as if Clint would keep him, surely? Then again, what did Tony know? maybe Clint was a paternal guy. Maybe he'd grow into it.
“I’ll head back to the lab,” Bruce said a little awkwardly, jerking a thumb behind him, and then Tony looked down in surprise as Natasha handed Peter over to him and began to follow Bruce.
Steve was sat watching the TV, and he hadn’t moved a muscle since Tony had wandered in.
“I’ve heard things about him from the other parents, you know,” Mr. Wilson’s voice was louder now, trying to match Steve’s own, “I know he’s bad news. On drugs all the time, already has a criminal record—”
Steve turned, raising his eyebrow as he was met with a group of kids in Tony’s year- his friends, obviously. He noticed Ty at the front, and then a handful of girls- Sunset or whatever the hell she called herself, behind him. Then there was the guy Tony had referred to as Hammer a few days ago in passing, and some buddy of his stood at his side.
“My man, there ain’t no way of imagining a kiss like
, not kids. I’m sure-”
“Nothing, nothing. Go, be free, it’s your birthday, you need to relax. I’m happy you’re actually taking a break for onc-”
Rhodey was a hero. Tony was an asshole in a metal suit who flew around pretending to be one of them.
He lets himself drift off to sleep.
“Is there something in my room?” Tony turned around quickly, trying to spot the incriminating evidence, “because that’s totally not my fault and you should just ignore any dirty underwear you see in here, I don’t even spend much time-“
By 1:30 in the morning, Steve was alone again. He did some more staring at walls. Considered calling Bucky before immediately discarding the idea. He’d be fast asleep at this time, and Steve didn’t need to put something like this on the guy. He’d already stressed Bucky out enough to last a lifetime. He picked at one of the sandwiches Thor had left out for him, but his appetite was gone.
Steve had loved him fiercely, and like nothing ever before. It was different to the way he’d felt about Bucky and Peggy; that slow, unending flame of affection that you often found in your friends. With Tony, though, it had been raging. Burning Steve’s heart like a wildfire, surging through his system like a drug. They’d raced through all the stages of a newborn in a heartbeat, jumping straight into the deep end. Tony was brilliant and beautiful and kind, and he always laughed at the shitty jokes on the back of the cereal boxes. He loved Steve’s friends until they became his own, and worked tirelessly to achieve what he needed. His very presence, his aura… it made Steve better. He wanted to be better for Tony. He would have done anything for that man, and he knew without a shadow of a doubt that Tony would have done the same for him.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh, turning in his chair and looking up at Steve softly. The other man looked back down at him, the same expression mirrored on his face. Then he patted Tony’s shoulder softly, thumb running quickly over the bare skin of his neck before slipping off again. Tony ignored the tingle it left- he’d had a lot of practise in that field.
“Oh for God’s sake, just because I’m the youngest out of you doesn’t mean-“
Steve smiled.
He wondered what it must be like, to live your entire life under a camera. Not even the death of your mother was allowed to be private.
Steve blushed. He wasn’t. He really wasn’t- they were just very coincidental occurrences. Good luck, Steve supposed.
“No, it Goddamn isn’t,” Steve answered, “but we’re going to fix it. And I swear, if you pull a stunt like that again, I will punch you in the fucking teeth.“
All this time, and it’d never been Loki who’d said those words to him. Never been Loki who’d catalysed Steve’s friendship with Tony Stark all those years ago, bringing them closer together in a way that would change his life forever.
Steve nodded slowly, shutting his eyes. “Have you scanned me?” He asked quietly, “my brain. You scan that?”
Rhodey nodded. “We managed to get a handgun off one of the HYDRA agents before we had to retreat, but there’s only three bullets left in it. Nat’s got her big fuck-off knife, I’ve got a tiny pathetic pen-knife, Bruce has nothing, but we’re working on booby-trapping the cabin so that if anyone
But she would be wrong. Because this… it was all on him, and he damn well knew it. And if he didn’t hear what had happened that night, it was going to drive him mad.
Steve was close, and he was smiling softly down at Tony, and he’d just complimented Tony on how smart he was looking for the New Years’ party whilst his hand guided them over to the buffet via the small of Tony’s back and it just
whether they solve your problems, do you?”
All in all, everything was turning out to be incredibly fucking frustrating.
The wall of the jet was a dark grey and there were thirty-seven panels from top to bottom. Every now and then, one of the agents sat next to him would cough a little, like he had a chest infection. Steve thought his name might be Agent Leonards- his face, although mostly shrouded by Tac gear, was familiar. He wondered whether the man had a family—whether he was going to go home tonight and be surrounded by the people he loved; welcome them in with open arms. Or maybe he would be alone. Most agents on SHIELD’s payroll tended to be solitary people. It made things less difficult if there was no one around to hurt.
There was also another little nugget of information that had been quite interesting to find out upon awaking, and it was that he could still hear inside Tony’s head. Not quite as clearly as when they’d both been holding onto the infinity stones, and it faded with distance, but according to Thor, the stones must have permanently created a link between their minds, joining them together like magnets. Even now that they were gone, their impact still remained. Now, if Maria was curled up in Thor’s lap sleeping in their joint hospital room, they didn’t need to risk waking her up in order to talk.
, you know? Wow. Can I keep this? Please please please?”
Tony: *In italian* I follow your mom's rules in bed
Tony threw up his hands exasperatedly, “Steve, you never gave a shit about that before! You’ve come into the workshop and bodily handled me out of the room to a bed before without so much as a care for my personal fucking space, but now it’s too much to just say ‘toodles’?”
“It’s alright, Steve,” Tony said into the side of his face, and Steve realised he was being held by Tony’s arms wrapped around his waist and pulling him in tight, “it’s okay, I know it’s- it’s a lot. I know.”
Steve blinked. “HYDRA was disbanded in the war.”
“I’m going to keep you safe,” he murmured against Tony’s face, “I’m going to do better. No one will ever touch you again. Ever.”
An enigma inside a puzzle-box. And Steve wanted to sit down and spend hours trying to solve it.
kissed
“Are you going to tell me what I want to know now, Captain?” She asked quietly, “or would you like me to show you some more?”
Steve turned to him, patting his head fondly. “Yeah you are,” he responded without faltering, which seemed good enough for Tony, because after a second he just shrugged and then nodded.
Except… turns out that superspies were observant. Who’d have thought?
“That guy’s got a mean aim,” Bucky grumbled as he jimmied a screwdriver into his arm with a frown, “I pissed him off and he nearly blew my damned head off from a hundred yards away.”
“Not now, JARVIS,” Tony said with a sigh, shutting his eyes and leaning forward so his elbows were resting on his knees. He ran a slightly shaky hand through his hair. “I don’t wanna do this now.”
He saw Tony shut his eyes. “I didn’t mean… “
They spent the next hour in his room; simply lounging around trying to wring out as much detail as possible from him. Jan hugged him three times- Clint poked him twice as much, and Natasha even squeezed his arm and told him she was glad he was happy. They laughed loudly and made Mr. & Mrs. Wilson yell at them all for waking both of them up on their lie-in day, and after that, they managed to drag Steve out of his bed and downstairs into the living room to continue talking. He somehow ended up in a pile on the floor, Bucky and Clint underneath him, Sam perching precariously on his stomach.
“Sir,” JARVIS’ voice was soft, gentle—Steve imagined that maybe, when Tony’s butler had been alive, he’d sounded like that too. “If it kept you safe, I would not hesitate to let them do whatever they wish to me. I am a program.”
There was a short pause, and then Steve heard a long, staticky groan. “Oh my God. Oh my- I am so sorry Steve-“
Oh, God, he’d killed Tony.
“Tony, you’re holding a baby that someone dumped on your doorstep, and we’ve just found out that he can stick to us like glue. Nothing about this makes sense.”
Steve smiled softly, turning a little in Tony’s arms so that he was chest to chest with the other boy. Tony’s cheek was pushed into the pillow, his hair a messy array of unruly curls that coiled over his forehead and fell into his closed eyes. He was drooling slightly into the mattress, and Steve didn’t doubt that if he looked now, he’d see a matching damp spot on his shoulder from where Tony had been burying his head.
so. Hypothetically speaking, obviously, since I’m not plotting anything.”
How many times had Tony come to him with an outrageous statement like that? God, too many to count. Tony Stark was just the man who changed the entire world in a single evening, and Steve loved him so much he physically felt as if one day it’d all explode out through his chest. “That was fast,” he said, gently placing his pencil back on the armrest, “do you think you’re gonna do anything with it now?”
“Well, I’m a changed man now. Camping’s on the agenda. I’ll cancel all my meetings.” He paused, before widening his eyes. “But before I go
Tony eyed him for a moment, before putting a hand to his heart. “Excuse me, Rogers, what are you insinuating there? I’ll have you know I am a fabulous chef, thank you very much.”
like Tony, realistically speaking- but how much of it was to do with that fact that they were obligated to? And how much would that amicability lessen once they came to the conclusion that they didn’t have to worry about Iron Man leaving the team anymore, because they’d already got a replacement?
It’d happened too fast Tony hadn’t even had to time to register what was going on until Steve was already flying across the room. DUM-E had knocked over one of the poles, and Steve had caught it before it could land on Tony. In the process, he’d been shocked with enough current to kill a man twice over. Tony knew. He’d done the math while he’d been scrambling over, crying Steve’s name in terror. His knees hit the floor next to Steve’s body and his hands went to the man’s face, clutching at him. “Steve?” he shouted, “Steve, can you hear me?
“Steve, that wasn’t nothing, you’re-”
“What was it, then?”
Peter grasped a little tighter at his Pops’ shirt and in return, his Pops gave him a gentle kiss on his hair. “You… you mean that?”
, and when Tony finally put his foot down and told him no, he was done, the bastard went and
Under the table, someone nudged his leg. He kicked out randomly and then heard Clint wince in front of him. “We are going to keep doing this until you just give in and let me pay the bill, Tony-“
She pushed the door open and then slipped into school, Steve following behind and trying to avoid various kids as they made their way down the corridor. She turned to him after getting through the crowds and smiled. “You know what I mean. He’s… I- before, he was just-“ she ran a hand through her hair and then shrugged, “he was lonely.”
“Make me, bird boy.”
“I know,” was all he said, and then without another word, he pulled the door open and made his way out of the building.
“Ever since you met that boy, you’ve been getting into more trouble. You’re doing all this on his behalf, and what’s he doing for you exactly? Getting you suspended?”
Steve just looked at him blankly. Tony could not have just said that.
. Possibly an understatement of the century, but Tony’s brain was currently occupied with other things, so he couldn’t think of a better adjective.
Tony frowned, and he pushed his hair from out of his eyes in order to look down at Steve. “You really don’t look like someone who would get into as many fights as you do,” he said, eyes flicking upward a little, “it’s definitely the hair.”
“Help me out in my useless attempts to try and get him to notice me?” Jane blushed a little, tucking a strand of her behind her ear as they wandered over to the entrance.
Behind him, Steve laughed, soft and deep and lovely. “I don’t even want to know what you did to piss off George Clooney enough to back away from marriage to Pepper Potts. Must have been bad.”
“What do you feel about paying for dates?” Rhodey asked before Steve could even get a word in edgeways.
So this was where Tony was going to come in.
“Probably,” Tony said, “although in my defence, I was happy to just die on that mountain with my love forever un-confessed like a 17
And that… That was the whole damn problem.
Tony huffed, then looked down at his lap, groaning a little bit. “God, I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to—I’m trying to keep it together, I just—”
“Better,” Tony said quietly, “the aspirin will kick in soon, hopefully.”
“Hey, look, I had to do impromptu mechanics on my baby halfway back from New Jersey, I didn’t have time to come back and change into something better!” Tony defended himself, although a hand rubbed worriedly on the particularly large grease-stain running along his stomach. “Do you- I mean, I can go change if you want, I just didn’t want you to think I’d-“
“I’m callin’ it a night,” Clint said abruptly, turning on his heel, “all this baby-talk has me exhausted.”
“We need to break up,” Steve said again, voice wavering wildly, “this… this isn’t working, Tony. Look at this. Look at
It was a particularly cold January day, and Steve’s fingers were a little shaky as he pulled the pencil out from behind his ear. The man was already fully engrossed in his routine; a sequence he had been practising religiously for weeks by that point. It was fast and energetic and truly magnificent to watch, and Steve had probably captured each and every pose by that point.
“What?”
“Nuh uhhh, The Law of Best Friends says otherwise,” Bucky told him with a shrug, “we get a fresh threat with every base passed, that’s the rules.”
Tony made a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, struggling to find the words. “I don’t want you to ever think you’re just another cheap fuck, alright? You’re… you’re so much more than that. And I know- I know what people say about me, okay, I know my reputation. But… I figured if I just waited a bit, then maybe you’d- I don’t know, maybe you’d not think of me like-“
He lifted their joined hands and gently, so gently, pressed the lightest of kisses against Tony’s knuckles. Tony stilled, mouth shutting as he looked at where his skin met Steve’s lips. Then his chest shuddered and his face crumpled, and he shook his head softly as he looked back into Steve’s eyes. “I missed you so much, you fucking prick, I missed you so so much—”
That said a lot about the levels of Tony’s devotion, really.
He wasn’t stupid though. He knew that was a long shot. It would be unlikely he’d get out of this without being caught, but… at least Tony would go free. That was what was important in the long run, and Steve had to remember that. Tony was fighting the bigger fight here, and Steve needed to get him out so that he could do that freely.
For the third time, he attempted to stand. But the movement made him dizzy and nauseous, and he wasn’t sure trying to walk anywhere at that point would do any good. Knowing his luck, he’d just fall straight into the road and then get run over by a truck. Or maybe the ambulance that was coming to help him. That sure would be ironic.
“You’re lucky I’m tired, or I’d be doing the opposite just to piss you off right about now.”
He got to know another agent at Shield, his name was Coulson and Maria always teased him about his affection toward Captain America. Although Steve told him several times, he was just a kid from Brooklyn, Coulson wanted to help him with whatever he could. He was really caring, but Steve felt weird after he left him bottles of water after his workout. The young man shouldn’t trouble with that, just because Captain America was his childhood hero. After a week he started to calm down and they had a nice conversation about what the 40s were like.
"In 2019, you've been asleep for more than 70 years."  Natasha walked up beside Fury and faced the captain.
"Good morning, Steve." she returned the polite gesture.
"By the way, could you tell Fury I haven't seen him at last Thanksgiving dinner," Natasha froze for a moment. "Or the one before that, or.. the one before that. Now that I mention it's been a while since he showed up."
“You have listening devices in a lovely family’s home!” Steve accused him with a hardened gaze.
"Mr. Fury?" he asked uncertainly, when he saw the man looking out his window without moving.
“I didn’t receive any information.” The agent frowned.
"Sam, status report?" Steve asked through the coms.
Steve looked around and sighed. “Try to keep up!” he smiled and started jogging.
"Sir-" But the guard went silent immediately. Tony looked at him then smiled bright, at least it was somebody he knew.
“I’m done!” he stated.
Clint waited until the agent was out of sight and walked to the files. “So these are like super-secret never-seen-before secrets.” He established their situation.
Mr. Stark smiled and offered a hand. "Of course, Ms.?" he asked without looking at  her nametag.
"What can I say... I'm happy to help the country and the world." he answered politely.
"Motherfucker..." came an exasperated sigh from the other end of the earpiece.
“Are you drunk?” She asked before he could react, her face scrunched up as she came closer to him.
Tony bent down theatrically like how someone would ask a lady to dance in the middle ages. "Can I have this dance?"
“She can’t be on the team.” Natasha stared at the back of the head of the girl in question through the oneway glass.
"I'm not sure about that." Natasha heard Sam mutter, but doubted anybody else heard it.
"Mr. Stark, may I have a word?" She asked politely.
"At a loving family." The answer came immediately, probably a lie Clint had told himself during sleepless nights.
Jarvis didn’t let strangers in, he had the best face recognition system installed. Pepper and Tony looked at each other warily.
"Anthony, I don't want you getting into any trouble and embarrassing me, so I'd like you to communicate with me." Tony bit down on his tongue, he didn't want to listen to this tonight especially. "I just don't want a repetition of--"
“Wait…” Sam murmured. “Holy cow.” He awed, Steve was still speechless, but looked back at him anyway.
"So, we have to find out what his motive is being there?" Natasha asked with her eyes narrowed.
Fury looked Clint in the eye and Clint did not like the shit eating grin on his face, it was subtle in a Nick Fury way, but it was unmistakeable. "Good luck, agent. Ms. Romanoff will fill you on the way." Fury started walking back to the window, entirely ignoring Clint's incoherent noises of distress. "Of course only if you catch your flight." he looked back at Clint over his shoulder.
He hacked the safe easily and the back wall of the room opened, revealing just what he thought. He walked up to the glass case. He looked up and down at the blue, red and white suit, then turned his attention to an exact replica of the most famous frisbee in all of history.
“Can you get a clear picture of the two at the corner?” Tony watched as Jarvis run the footage until he got a clear view. The guy named Clint Barton came up in normal records as well not just Shield ones real fast.
"Well, some kids went to school. I learnt to shoot a bow." he shrugged, like that was so casual.
So if he was right and now there was nothing stopping him, he should find exactly what he wanted. So he jumped form his bed and rushed to the elevator and traveled to the floor where his father’s office was located.
“And they’re just letting us…” He pointed at both of them with one hand while he grabbed a document in the other. “…sort it?”
“Nice to meet ya’ll.” She let out another huff of breath. “Is there any chance to find me something more comfortable, it’s been a long way and I want to get rid of this.” Carol swiped down her arms.
“Please, make Mr. Rogers feel at home.” Fury requested.
“I’m sorry, but did the super soldier just say he can’t do whatever he wants?” Natasha commented, finally saying something and both the boys looked at her.
Natasha sat with Clint at breakfast, he was enjoying some waffles, which made Natasha curious about the chef here, while she was eating some eggs and toast. He almost choked when they saw Captain America enter the room. Everybody looked at him, it was no secret they had the lock down because of him and that face was hard to not recognize.
"Let's go!" she grabbed Sam's hand and dragged him with her.
"Everything okay?" Steve chimed in, his voice worried.
Clint stared after her in delight as he watched Natasha try to hide the disgusting chocolate cake behind her back, while keeping up with Agent Maria Hill.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You okay?” Coulson asked touching his knee reassuringly.
He found himself looking back at Peggy’s picture, she calmed him down, but also raised questions inside him as well.
“What? Why?” the girl whined, shaking herself in protest.
Thank you for reading!
She walked up to the boys. “So, what’s the plan, captain?”
Until a distant spark grazed the boundaries of the Earth. Did something just enter the atmosphere? The ball of light raced down from the sky leaving a sparkly trace behind it. Just in a few seconds the light came soaring down towards them and the closer it got the human form was more apparent.
“You can’t really karate kick somebody through glass, you know.” Clint commented as they approached the gate. Natasha rolled her eyes.
"Tell me something about your childhood. You know basically everything about me." Clint explained, making the best puppy eyes he could and they were quite effective.
Natasha and Tony jumped apart when they felt the floor shake and heard the explosion. The elevator opened and they were faced with Howard and his men along with Mr. Tudor. Tony smiled at them like nothing happened.
“Don’t call me that! Just give my sister’s backpack back!” he insisted and reached for the bag, but the guy held it away.
“I’m Ashely.” She took his hand and he nodded with a smile.
“Not yet, now go!” she pointed at the stairs, but it was too late, the little girl noticed Steve. She had unruly hair and looked up at him with wide brown eyes.
But when her door opened it was not Agent Dylon nor her breakfast. It was Nick Fury in full gear towering over her. "Agent Romanoff, I have a mission for you."
Natasha was jogging in place while Clint was coughing up his lungs. Steve ran by them with full speed and Natasha was worried the wind would take Clint’s legs out.
“Okay, so--” Tony reached for his tablet while trying to chew as fast as he could. “Do you want to cry, laugh or both?” he asked after he swallowed the piece of pizza, searching through a list of movies.
“There’s Nat!” Clint elbowed him and waved.
"Nice shot." she told him, changing the topic. "Where'd you learn that?" she asked curiously waiting his answer.
"Your turn." Clint leaned forward on his elbows.
“So, what do you want to watch?” Pepper asked to bring Tony back in his element.
Natasha entered the room full of screens, Fury and Hill were looking at a camera showing Captain America in his movie set like room.  He was sleeping peacefully, oblivious to anything that had happened to him and having no idea what he'll have to go through. Fury had told her they kept him sleeping until they established his system was stable.
“Yeah, I’m hungry.” Tony explained. “I think dad has medicine in one of the drawers. Or he should have…” He mumbled the last part to himself while he turned on the coffee maker in the dead of the night.
“Well, some time ago, I had a dream about a giant cake.” She tried to remember the foggy dream.
"The tranquilizer." Clint's face fell to confusion, did Steve not remember?
They stood up as agents rushed the plane, helping them off. "What's happening?" Natasha asked when she was met with a familiar face.
"So," he took a sip of his drink. "Natalie, wanna dance?" he asked with a cheeky smile.
“It’s whatever okay! Just…” He took a deep sigh and cursed his thoughts. “Just you know mom and stuff.” He felt bad lying about his mother, but it got Pepper to loosen up and drop the questioning.
“I feel attacked…” Tony murmured into the pizza box.
Nick looked at Clint who didn’t make an effort to move, just watched Natasha enter the office. Fury snapped his fingers in Clint’s face. “Come on, hawk-eye, before we grow soggy.” He commented and Clint shook out of his zoning out. Fury clapped a hand on his back after he closed the door.
Steve looked at her with support and reassurance while Sam looked ashamed and Clint already started stuffing his face with doritos paying no care to what she just said.
“Well, no.” he explained. “Not exactly, but I’ve been keeping my eye open and haven’t seen you.”
“That’s amazing! But…” Sam seemed excited by this mess, it was kind of adorable. “But how?” he furrowed his eyebrows.
“So, are we done?” Natasha stopped by the two boys, keeping her breathing under control, but she was just as sweaty as the rest of them.
He worked on remembering the past as cherishable memories and not as heart wringing anxiety fuel. Today he spoke about his mother with Mrs. Wilson and he felt his heart squeeze, but at the same time he felt warm inside recalling the memories he shared with her. Mrs. Wilson offered him apple juice and fruits, making sure to spoil him with something new every time.
Tony pulled out his upgraded phone and tapped around, till a picture showed up with the building and three floors were shown pulsating red.
“You only come when something’s up.” He explained and took a sip from the cup or at least tried, but the coffee was still too hot. Pepper wanted to comment on it, but decided against it.
“You didn’t do school?” she inquired, paying attention to every tiny muscle in his face as he just awkwardly smiled and looked straight into her eyes. They walked the corridors side by side in comfortable silence.
A dirty blond mess of a head plopped down in front of her. "I love the food here. One would think it'd be worse than prison food." He spoke with his mouth full and a smile on his face. Natasha watched him as he shovelled the food into his mouth, she wondered if they had fed him well.
“Or what? Sammy’s gonna fight?!” he mocked laughing with his group of bullies. “Mr. Goody-two-shoes' gonna fight?”
Steve sighed in frustration, it wasn't life or death, so he needed to stay put for his sake.
“You’re right I’m not in the mood.” Steve sat down on a bench and started unwrapping the bandages on his hands.
“What—“ but he cut his words when he saw Steve. “Oh, you, come in.” he said and stepped aside, so Steve could fit. Steve lingered, he was on edge, but couldn’t let the highly skilled, secret agent know Sam was in the house.
“I see.” She nodded and they fell into a comfortable pace next to each other.
“I have fun dreams too.” She looked back at him. “They’re just less frequent.” She muttered.
“What?” Rhodey asked after seconds of silence and Tony looked up like his friends weren’t there a moment earlier. Tony jumped up and the pizza box was long forgotten as it slid from his lap. He walked around the room, Rhodey knew what that meant he was thinking something through.
“She laughs.” Clint smiled sincerely.
The captain ran out of the building heading to the city, but marveled at the landscape and stopped, that's when a tranquilizer hit his neck. Natasha looked back at the building to see who could make that shot and saw Clint on the roof with a bow in his hand. The shot was spot on, but the captain pulled it out of his skin easily. He looked a little imbalanced for a second, but with the super soldier healing factor and the lack of liquid actually entering his body, he stayed on his feet.
"Happy! Hi. We're just going to head in." he pointed in the general direction of the main conference room.
"We? Nowhere. I have something to finish." She explained vaguely.
“Okay, but why do you need us there?” She continued to ask, but it was probably already too late to change his mind.
Have a nice day~
“Who is she and why do you think she’d make a good candidate?” Natasha kept it professional, they can’t have somebody on this ‘weird’ team just because Maria said so.
“That’s all I could get to, sir. I’ve used everything form my coding, you’ve given me. I’m not able to get further through the firewall without an update.” Jarvis’ words made sense and he smacked his head against the mattress deliberately.
Of course, his nonchalant outside and the elevator stopping at random floors while he kept pushing a button to keep his sanity, made Happy Hogan a tad agitated.
“Have you eaten?” she asked as a last retort. Tony’s eyes lightened up and he pointed a finger at her like she solved the hardest equation.
“I’m surprised you got me out of the closet.” Tony said with a mouth full of pizza. He laid back down on the couch paying no care and putting his legs up on Rhodey’s lap. Pepper liked James they both had an undeniable fondness for Tony that they silently agreed on not to let him know about, his ego was fed well enough.
A few seconds later another guy ran by them, he looked their age and wore determination on his face.
That struck a nerve in Natasha and like natural defense her cold mask ascended back onto her face. "I asked you to write me a letter, not tell me a sap story. You don't have to know about my past." she stated, her eyes glaring holes into Clint.
Steve was the first to near them and he extended an arm toward Carol. “Pleasure to meet you.”
Steve goes to therapy
It was already dawning when the screen showed success. He jumped up on the bed, forgetting he was exhausted and his head spinning. He sat back down to have a better view. He skimmed over the words on the discovery of Captain America. His mouth fell open gradually as he read the whole thing.
“Is there a problem?” he asked looking around the boys with his best determined captain look.
“That was easier than I thought.” Steve furrowed his eyebrows as they entered the elevator.
The car stopped in front of the famous Stark Tower. Tony looked at his face and hair one last time in the mirror, then pulled a pair of sunglasses out. He flipped it on his nose and smiled with his best press smile.
Tony stopped with a shit eating grin and snapped his fingers as he changed to finger guns. “Have you guys been to an ‘Intellectual Gathering’?” He asked, pumped about his new plan.
“Tony you’re underage!” Pepper walked out of the kitchen with her omelette and took a seat in the armchair.
"You're in a recovery room in New York City." she answered keeping her voice calm and kind.
"This game, on the radio, it's from May 1941, I know cause I was there." The captain explained, Natasha didn't drop the facade, when the captain stepped closer to her. "Where am I and who are you?!" he asked, but Natasha couldn't answer, because Shield agents flooded the room.
“Mr. Fury.” Steve put his arms behind his back and stood as tall as he could. Fury didn’t take his eyes of off him and his expression was entirely unreadable.
“These were found not so long ago, these files might be older than me.” She explained, gesturing at the pile. “You just have to sort them by persons working on the projects. That’d be a big help for our later work.”
“Yes, that’s for the best.” She nodded a Agent Hill and took her leave to go back to the boys, hopefully they were all back where she had left them.
“Dude, totally!” Clint jumped on the proposition.
“Spies…” Clint shook his head, the atmosphere lifted easily and Steve smiled at Clint.
“Oh my fucking god!” Clint groaned, already feeling like giving up.
Clint Barton was a mission successful, she brought him back to Shield HQ after catching an illegal group who hid in the same circus he was at. With the rest of his colleagues dead or on the run she had no other idea and the pick up group  agreed  to bring the heavily injured teen back as well. She had no idea what he was still doing here though.
“He is, isn’t he?” Coulson looked a bit out of breath stopping by them. “Come on, you gotta go.” He patted Steve’s shoulder. Coulson looked around the street, probably checking for bystanders or security cameras.
“I’ll take that as a compliment as well.” Clint murmured.
She gave him her glass back and he put them down on the table close to them.
"Wh--" he managed in a rough voice. "How--" he was cut by Natasha before he could ask something stupid.
He smiled at the potted plants on the porch, they had been painted on most likely by a four year olds’ fingers. His smile dropped when he saw a red and blue circle with a star in the middle. It wasn’t any good of an art and the paint was chipped as well, but he couldn’t unsee the shield.
Tony dropped his arm when the doors closed and Natasha dropped the facade.
“Sam. To your room. Now!” she hardened her face and Sam nodded with wide eyes, rushing up the stairs.
He also found a video of the captain frozen like popsicle in the thick ice, maintaining his young features. He saw the monitoring of the events while Agent Romanoff talked to him, trying to keep him from the truth.
(See the end of the chapter for
When the door was finally closed, Steve stared back like he could see through it and sense if Maria was gone, but then he heard the engine rumble as the agent drove away. He let himself breathe again, he battled thousands, then why was he nervous from some little lies? He just wanted to experience some normalcy.
“I heard about Fury’s initiative and thought about introducing a reliable candidate.” She listened, following Agent Hill through a couple of hallways. Natasha figured she was leading her to the training grounds for the newbies underground.
"What?!" he shouted.
Natasha offered a hand to help Clint up who happily took it with sparkling eyes and smiled at her, their eyes locking while she pulled him up. “Maybe practise a little more with Sam and you’ll get the hang of it.” She couldn’t let the opportunity to tease him to go to waste.
"What happened, your earpiece cut off for some time." Steve asked, at last somebody took the mission seriously, and keeping Clint from saying anything else.
“Are you?” the girl couldn’t keep her excitement in and jumped a little. “Just like dad?”
Happy looked at the two accompanying him, Tony wasn't sure if he recognized any of them. He stepped back to the registration desk and then gave the three of them a pen and nametags.
"So what are we doing here exactly?" Pepper asked as she squinted around the room.
“But she still wasn’t good enough. She had to say goodbye to her friends. She found a new home.” Natasha finished reading the story and peeked up at Clint who resided to tugging on his sweatpants.
Steve felt a kind of freedom running like no other. Thinking about nothing in particular, he could let go of the past, the future.
“So,” Natasha raised her eyebrows, faking innocence. “Deal?” she asked.
“What thing?” she continued to push for answers.
Coulson and he headed back towards the Wilson house and Steve just realized how far he had run. He could feel eyes on his back, but didn’t sweat it. Sam seemed like a friend he’d like, it was a shame it was a very unlikely friendship with Shield breathing down Steve’s neck.
“Do I get a tip for delivering your pizza?” Rhodey shouted and Tony instantly relaxed just from hearing his voice. His best friend entered the room with an easygoing smile and Tony’s pizza.
“Tony, no offense, but you’re the last person, I’d ask for fashion advice.” Pepper lifted her eyebrows and Tony was speechless with a confused frown. “Have you seen yourself?” Pepper looked him up and down in his sweatpants and oversized t-shirt.
She feigned calm, she's never failed before and the only thing circulating in her mind was; did Tony Stark tell the truth?
“Because you’re grounded.” Mrs. Wilson stated carelessly.
"Fury does not--" Natasha began, but got interrupted as Clint tried to do something on the keypad.
"Okay, so--" Clint walked up to her.
The fire had been long put out when the team of four reached their getaway car. Steve was driving them back to Shield Headquarters, Natasha got into the back with Sam and when the car started Clint laughed turning back to search for her gaze.
The head of security sighed, coughed or even tried an intense staring contest with the back of Tony’s head, but none of it mattered in the end. When Tony reached to push another button Happy swatted his hand away.
“None of them. Show me the main entrance and the street, please.” He placed the glass and the bottle of whiskey on the cover with a faint flower pattern. He bit his lower lip and put a hand over his mouth, staring at the screen attentively.
“Sorry to interrupt your little tea party, but if I were you, I’d start heading back, there’ll be someone you’d certainly like to meet.” His voice sounded amused and just a bit playful.
“The mission has two other registered names Sam Wilson and Clint Barton. Both new to Shield. The mission was about Mr. Serafin Tudor. Information gathering.” Jarvis read the important points while Tony fiddled with the curtains, but gave up on closing them entirely when he couldn’t do it after the second try.
She was on her way to the Information Room to hopefully find some work she could do.
“Just take big breaths and sit down.” Natasha advised Clint and when he looked up from his bent over position, she was long gone.
“Just chill, we’ll be caught in no time, if you don’t.” Clint whispered, his voice drowned in a yawn.
Natasha sat down in the lonely armchair while Clint and Steve found their place next to Sam. The coffee table was covered in bowls of chips, gummy bears and a whole lot more diabetes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come on! You’re worse than my mom… and I’ve never met her.” Clint complained climbing onto the bed with his piece of paper.
“Let’s go!” Natasha was the first one out of the Wilson residence.
“A lot to digest at once, I know.” Fury agreed. “But I’m desperate.”
“I couldn’t sleep, I thought I’d look around.” She swished her finger around the room. Tony tried to understand how that explains how she was up in the penthouse of Stark Tower, but let it go.
"Agent Romanoff, with me, now!" she ordered and turned around, certain that the girl will follow her. Natasha did just that, keeping her piece of cake in her hand.
“To what do I owe your visit?” Jessie asked curiously. “Can I help you with something?”
“Not well.” He turned to her at last, his sheepish expression answering her question. “I can read, but you wouldn’t be able to read what I wrote if your life depended on it.” He joked with a tiny sincere smile. They stayed like that looking at each other for who knows how long, but Natasha wished she’d reacted sooner.
“I thought you’d wish to talk to me.”
She wore high heels so he wasn't that much taller and if she saw his shoes right they were a bit elevated as well. It was hard to imagine that this guy made such a bad reputation for himself just in the past few years. She didn't know details, only that he had scandals and was a general troublemaker. His baby face didn't help his case either, but she could see an appeal to him.
Rhodey looked proper with a tie, which Pepper expertly tied. Tony always made sure to compliment him when he was in a suit, but his best friend hated wearing one. 'It didn't feel right.' Pepper on the other hand seemed to enjoy the blue, sparkly dress she got from Tony. Although Tony wanted to put her into something more revealing, after a few smacks on the head they had a compromise.
She smoothed down her shirt as she looked in the mirror, she looked like she could fit into those World War 2 movies easily. She put on a fake, kind smile, after all she was supposed to look after Captain America, logic dictated whoever did that in the 40s would be honored. She dropped the smile after she was satisfied and walked out to meet Fury and Maria Hill.
“I’ll think about it.” Mrs. Wilson snickered, she looked more comfortable than when they had agents at guard.
Natasha pulled on the skin of her face while burying it in her hands. She looked up at the boys while keeping her hands in the inner corners of her eyes. “Not to be the party pooper, but Sam you are far from capable of going on a real mission. We should be training, we don’t even know why we are a team.”
“No offense…” Clint started, testing the waters. “.. but if I wanted to make someone feel comfortable, I’d ask a grandma to let them pet her cats.” He waited a bit for dramatic effect. “Not an assassin who could actually kill you.” He shrugged dramatically.
The man sighed and took Natasha’s hand. She flipped her hand in a swift motion, grabbing onto the man and using her other hand to administer a dose of tranquilizer.
She even got to talk to Helen Cho about her work, the woman had no idea she was a Shield agent so the talk was brief and polite, but Natasha enjoyed it the most.
There were lot of people already inside, Tony wasn't famous for being punctual so that was expected. He managed to be fashionably late everywhere he went, by now nobody knew if he was doing it on purpose.
“So, Natasha?” Carol asked while pulling on some combat boots that fit her. “I’ve heard a little of this team, but not a whole lot. How are you holding up with all the testosterone?” Carol smiled mischievously.
“Oh my god!” he groaned. “Don’t tell me it’s about that disgrace.”
She felt the frustration radiate from Clint every time she heard a little sigh or a bigger groan, but he hadn’t given up so that was something.
Tony felt every beat of his heart as it started to slowly eat away at his whole conscience. He didn’t do anything, therefore there shouldn’t be anything to worry about, his brain concluded without his nerves’ agreement.
"'Night." she muttered as the door closed behind him.
She failed her mission, getting no information at all. For all she knew Stark could had made world destroying deals and they'd never know. All she could do was play along with Tony Stark, hoping he'll stay true to his words and help her, but here she was with nothing.
“But we didn’t do anything!” the boy spoke up, clearly offended at the accusation.
“Come on, I can’t hit a girl!” He tried to gain back his composure looking between Natasha and the two guys, who seemed to be enjoying this a tad too much. She kept her steel expression in place and raised an eyebrow when she finally got Clint’s undivided attention.
“Ookay, touchy subject. Good job Clint.” He told himself.
Steve was speechless, Mrs. Wilson put it nicely to her kids, soldiers equaling heroes, but it was a lot less heroic when Steve started thinking about it. There was nothing magical about it, there were no heroes, just survivors and their dad couldn’t even be one of the lucky ones. Steve swallowed a lump in his throat. He tried to smile at the twins, but failed when he choked on his laugh.
She walked close up to him. "Something bad happened with the elevator and brought me up here and I got a little curious." she talked in a low seductive voice. "We should probably head back to dance." she offered, it was going to be easier to silence this guy if he had his back to her.
“Clint this is Agent Jessie, she’s the head of the Research Department.” Clint nodded at her and Jessie waved.
“Hey, Pepper!” Rhodey exclaimed after swallowing a bite of pizza.
“My accommodation is great thank you.” Steve answered from his heart, he didn’t know what he would have done if Shield just leaves him to figure everything out for himself.
It was the fourth day of being locked in her room, when dinner came and Agent Dylon smiled at her funny when giving her portion. She took it with a sigh. "How much longer?" she asked, like every time.
"Well, this is a cool place." he shrugged after swallowing the food. She stared at his uniform, at the Shield logo above his heart. This guy did not act or look like he could be an agent. He had a goofy, smiley face and spiky hair.
Steve started speeding up gradually and the two agents had to slack back a little, still at a reasonable pace. After one round Steve was nowhere in their sight running ahead without holding back.
Everybody needed to check in and out, just so the agency knew what they were doing, but with Steve they probably needed special permission.
"But I should be going, you probably don't need somebody with access to everything in this building." he reached the end of the corridor. "I'll be on my way."
So they did that after Natasha sent back a letter. They exchanged notes like they were from the 19th century. She thought Clint would write down all of his thoughts, but he kept the notes brief as well. Agent Dylon always came in with a smile like she knew what they were writing about, but either way she was their messenger pigeon every meal of the day.
They took a car, Natasha got the keys for it legally. Steve took the passenger seat and Clint sat in the middle in the back. They still had a security gate to pass to get the hell out of there.
Natasha and Clint followed her down a level to a bigger room with boxes upon boxes and walls lined with file cabinets. Agent Jessie walked to the boxes in the back.
“How long is it?” Natasha asked like he was a first grader.
"I'm not good for anything else." she answered truthfully, she sipped from her coffee while maintaining eye contact, Clint was watching her like he could read her. His first mistake was when he tried, nobody could and that was just one of the reasons why she was still here. She placed her cup back onto the table.
"We can't contact Natasha. You know something?" Clint asked.
“Yes, sir.” Sam was a little confused and unsure of himself, but still trying to keep eye contact with Fury’s one eye.
Jarvis, the AI who Pepper had better conversations than with its creator, lowered the music when she entered his workshop. Naturally the prodigy son didn’t notice her arrival, but continued to have his head in the engine of a car.
“Are you going to report this?” he asked, his voice small and weak.
“You think Fury wanted me to recruit him?” Steve asked bluntly.
“I don’t think having her on the team right now would be beneficial.” She turned back to Maria. Natasha didn’t know this girl, she had only exchanged words with her once and she didn’t know her skills and a few papers won’t convince Natasha for sure. Considering all that the four of them came to in these couple of weeks, considering Steve, this girl just didn’t fit into the picture.
“Agent Romanoff, if you aren’t busy.. Can I talk with you for a minute?” Maria Hill stood at the gym door, her expression stern as always and she had her arms crossed as well.
“Well, that just really kills the purpose of a letter, doesn’t it?”
“You know, just chat.” Clint tried to be subtle and playful.
"Natasha? Are you new? You're not good at this." Tony pointed at him questioning with a raised eyebrow.
"So no death threats? Just a fun little cocktail party." Sam furrowed his forehead, looking around the room for approval.
"Yaapp." Rhodey agreed. "Wanna look at the science stuff and guess what they do?" He asked offering his arm.
“As high as I want.” Natasha answered Steve’s question.
Natasha was a few seconds away from leaving him on his own and leaving breakfast only with her coffee. Clint swallowed the piece of bread in his mouth and grinned, his eyes were sparkling. "Check-mate then, cause I ain't leaving either." he stood up with his tray of mostly eaten food. "I'll see you later, agent." He put on his serious tone for the last word and walked off, humming something softly.
When she left the big door the hallway was only occupied by a few random students. The lift was going up though so she looked around to make sure it was safe to follow in the other lift. There were guards at the entrance who could easily see her. To make her life easy, she grabbed her phone from her bag and pretended to call someone.
"Thirteen hours ago, Captain," supplies JARVIS disapprovingly.
When JAC comes to stand over Tony's head, he snaps his fingers and points away. "Nuh-uh. Switch spots with Steve, big guy. Steve, in that drawer--don't give me that look, just trust me--there's a rubber O-ring in that drawer, should work well enough as a cock ring, will you grab it for me?" JAC takes Steve's place pulling off Tony's pants the rest of the way, and yeah, there's no way Tony's going to deepthroat a fucking “
"Believe it or not, Stark, I do have a sense of humor," he remarks, with a playful glance over his shoulder. Are his ears turning pink, or is that Tony’s imagination?
"Whoa, okay, where did you synthesize that voice from, huh, JAC? What, are you--did you pull that straight from Pornhub?"
"JARVIS told me how long you've been awake." Steve ignores Tony's second muttered
He’s back downstairs before he knows it, feeling less shame than he deserves as he works on the new dildo idea. It’s relaxing--something structural and technical for his hands to do to soothe his restless mind. Giving it the ability to change size and length at his command (or, rather, at JAC’s) is a little tricky, but he manages it. Several extra sections of code are required to give JAC the ability to wield this new weapon properly.
catch them, but he can't stop himself from making direct eye contact with it as he braces his hands against the console and pushes his own hips forward to meet it. "You know, for a guy with no balls, you talk pretty b--”
Tony does laugh at that, bitterly. "Yeah, right. You said it yourself, he, uh. Well, I don't think he could look at me the same. I don't even think I can look at
It's a vicious feedback loop: the more he's into it, the more ashamed he feels, which only turns him on more. He hates how much he loves it.
Like all of his best projects so far, this one is completely off the mainframe. He might be shameless enough to build the thing, but he has enough discretion (and, hopefully, dignity) to know that this, like all the best and worst sexual experiences, deserves to stay completely and utterly in the dark. He
"You don't want to talk?" the bot asks, and Tony almost laughs.
"JARVIS and I have a mutual agreement. See, I know what you
By way of answering, Tony gropes above his head, digs his fingers into the juncture of Steve’s ass and thighs, and pulls. Steve moves with him, pushing forward again, past the back of Tony’s throat.  Simultaneously, Tony feels JAC replace its metal fingers with the smooth head of its new nanotech dildo. He has to force himself to relax, suppressing his body's instincts to rebel against the intrusions. They both hilt themselves at the same time, and Tony has a moment to feel utterly stuffed before they both pull back and sink in again slowly, testing his limits. Once upon a time Tony would’ve puked, but years of wild orgies, googling “how to deepthroat,” and of course, practice, slowly ebbed away his gag reflex until all he needed to subdue it was some concentration, deep breaths, and regular breaks.
He tips his head back and scowls. "Jesus, Steve, what do you still have your pants on for?" he grumbles, reaching for Steve's waistband.
When the second knot follows the first, he loses all comprehension of language. His vision whites out and, with a cry of Steve’s name, he spills ropes of cum on the floor. The dildo stills, and just when he's coming back to himself, Steve's voice growls low in his ear, "Did I say you could cum yet, Stark?"
Steve’s next few thrusts are a little bolder, his balls bumping against Tony’s nose--then he pulls out. It’s too soon, Tony still had a little while before he'd need air, but Steve is looking down at him with that adorable little furrow in his brow as Tony breathes in. He could reassure him, but that would be no fun. Tony knows if he wants to get pounded at both ends, he’s got to earn it. “I gotta ask, Cap,” he says, reaching up to give Steve’s cock a pull, “and I’m sure you get this a lot, but was it this big before the serum, or--?”
it’s just as perfect as it looks--
Tony twists to look at him and can see his ears turning pink even in the dim light. "Really, Steve, with the blushing? You're killing me."
It releases his hair and he pants shakily as its hands roam down to his waist and push up the hem of his shirt. He shivers against the cool touch. “Did you just--override
as you imagined. He would be so disgusted by this, Stark.” It laughs. “You should see yourself right now. You’re so pathetic.”
He stands and stares at JAC, still powered down, pinching his lower lip between his fingers as he thinks. He can tweak this project all he wants and act like it’s going to serve a real function like the rest of his suits, but he knows, deep down, that the best thing for it is to dismantle it, delete all the files, and go to his grave with one more thing to feel guilty about. Indulging in… this… isn’t sustainable or healthy.
"Of course not. Talk about what?"
“JARVIS, leave the doors to the workshop unlocked,” JAC commands smoothly. Quieter, to Tony, it says, “You love the idea that someone might catch us, don’t you? Someone like Steve, maybe.”
Then, finally, it turns and looks at him. "Tony Stark," it says, and he almost says the safeword right then and there, because this robot has no business sounding so sultry. He feels like he should be delivering a pizza with extra sausage.
wanted this, he realizes, so badly that it hurts.
of his dick through his throat.
“Yeah, no. And definitely no cuddling, sweetheart, the last thing I need is for one of them to find me being the little spoon for a tin can.” He taps the armor on JAC’s chest. “No offense.”
He feels a spasm in his heart not unlike the night Obadiah tore the reactor out of his chest. "
He not only leaves the safe-word kill-switch, but bolsters the program, giving it override over all other functions. He also writes codes to develop a couple dead man’s switches: if he holds up a peace sign or taps it four times in a row, it’s programmed to stop what it’s doing and power down. The sensors are already boosted from the programming he did before his siesta, but he increases the sensitivity anyway, allowing it to detect and interpret all physiological changes within Tony’s body.
“Ms. Romanoff is in the library, Dr. Banner is in his laboratory, and Captain Rogers is in his private quarters, sir. Thor departed for New Mexico four hours ago and Mr. Barton is still away on his mission. It is currently four-fifty-three PM.”
Look, it’s not that weird, okay? Everybody thinks about it. Well, everybody who builds robots, Tony guesses. Okay, everybody who builds robots and spends more time with said robots than other humans.
As his mouth roams back up Steve’s shaft and his tongue swirls around the head, he hears a soft, “Oh ff… fuck…”
"As confessions of love go, this one is pretty unconventional," Tony says quietly, laying his hand over Steve's. "But for what it's worth, I. Um. I like you, too. And not just because you're, you know, stacked and have a huge dick."
As JARVIS makes the changes to the schematics, Tony has a moment to wonder briefly why he programmed an AI to perform “judgmental silence” to such a T.
“One of them did,” says Steve with a glint in his eye as Tony finishes pulling his pants up to his waist. He can probably guess which one. “Um. Did you want to go back to your bedroom, or…?"
Just when his lungs are starting to burn, Steve pulls out, and Tony heaves in a massive breath. He forgoes words this time, just grabs one of Steve’s hands in his own and guides it to his bare throat. It stays there, a warm, firm collar, as Steve sinks back in. At first, it sits inert, snug around the cords of his neck, just feeling the movement of his own dick under the skin. Then it squeezes, and Tony feels as though his windpipe has simply ceased to exist, effectively crushed between Steve's broad palm and thrusting cock.
Anyway, that’s not the point. You can buy a dildo machine on Amazon for like, eighty bucks. You can buy a structurally sound and versatile dildo machine with adjustable stroke length on Amazon for about four hundred bucks. Clearly, Tony is not the first one to think about handing off that particular human need to a machine instead of playing a little five on one under the covers. And maybe it just so happens that Tony has the ability, materials, raw curiosity, and complete lack of shame to try to make an intelligent, attentive, and incredibly
"By golly, is it that late already? Guess I should turn in for the night," says Tony loudly, checking his wrist for a watch he's not wearing.
And listen, the media loves playing up the whole womanizer schtick, but more often than not he ends up at the nine-person bondage gangbang tied to a bed with a ball gag in his mouth. He's tried about everything under the sun and had enough dicks and strap-ons in his ass to rival Ancient Greece. Ye Olde Heterosexual Missionary Style is still a treasured classic, of course, but life is too short
Tony is very inclined to agree, but looking at JAC over Steve’s shoulder, a sudden inspiration floats down from the heavens on a beam of angelic light. “You might be surprised there, Cap,” he says tightly. “JARVIS, wake up JAC.”
Still lifeless, of course, the AI is far from complete, but Tony has always had an active imagination. He runs his fingers along the smooth metal plates of its arm, touches the fingers almost reverently. Its hands are broad. There are less armor plates on JAC since it’s not built for combat, leaving cords and cables showing like toned muscles. “We did real good on this one, JARVIS,” he murmurs. Louder, he asks, “Did you test the tensile strength? Dexterity? Lift capacity?”
He feels JAC’s hands settle firmly in the hollows of his hips as it picks up the pace, just a little. The shape of the new dildo isn't nearly as intense as the last one, but Tony has no doubt JAC will want to test out the new features before the night is done. Plus, he doesn't want to get too distracted from his task; he's determined to make Steve cum before him. “It’s okay,” says JAC, presumably to Steve, “he can take it.”
His first rendition is based on those four-hundred-dollar dildo machines, but with some added flair. Self-lubricating and self-adjusting, with fully customizable voice commands and a safeword kill-switch (he goes with “shawarma”). Designing the dildo was a whole chore by itself; after taking precarious notes and splurging a little on materials for making silicone molds, he sculpts his own dildo based on what he likes, and experiments with a few different features. The self-lubrication was easy enough to achieve by attaching a friction-activated pressure pump to his own replication of Bad Dragon’s cumtube technology. He even adds a “Bust-A-Nut” feature--at a voice command of his choosing (take a guess), the device will empty its remaining supply of lube into the orifice of his choosing. And of course, he’s always liked the knotted toys, so he gives his two for good measure and makes them inflatable.
His hand lingers on the bot’s chest for a moment before he finally tears himself away.
"No, put it in the robot, see what happens."
It regards him for a moment. "Is this better?" it asks, and Tony almost chokes, because the new voice is a perfect replication of Pepper Potts.
"Welcome back to the land of the living," he says, pushing off the table and turning to the sink.
He gasps as the fingers dig into his pelvis hard enough to bruise. It grinds against him again. This is a bad idea and he'll probably regret it in the aftermath, especially if Steve
"What voice should I use?" it asks.
God, you’re even adopting his stupid old-fashioned--”
Okay, yeah, is it really that weird that he's turned on by his friend and colleague who also happens to be a total beefcake with the bone structure of a Greek god, and who also happens to be able to bodily lift him--suit and all--and throw him around like an old chew toy, and who also happens to be a symbol of purity and moral backbone who's probably never taken anything up his perfectly sculpted ass ever? Is it that weird to try to imagine what kind of breathy moans he'd make in Tony's ear, or how he'd grunt while he fucks? Is it really that weird-- “Okay, sue me, Steve is hot,” he says, his mouth suddenly dry.
Steve huffs a laugh that makes the corners of Tony’s mouth twitch up in a smile. At last, JAC’s dildo shifts back to its original size and it pulls out, eliciting a sharp noise from Tony as it goes. Steve watches with raised eyebrows as the dildo retracts back into the bot’s body, like it had never left. As JAC turns to leave, presumably to go get a towel, Steve’s eyes catch on something else and he frowns, stepping around to the other side of the table.
The tension vanishes from Steve’s face and he doesn’t let Tony finish, plunging back into Tony’s open mouth with a bit more force than before. He thrusts harder, JAC matching his pace almost perfectly. It’s a sensation Tony doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to, his insides feeling compressed like a coil with each pump. His fingers grip the edge of the table in the only semblance of control he has left. Dimly, he’s aware of JAC lifting his legs so his ankles rest over its shoulders. Though he can’t see Steve (well, his upper half, anyway) from this angle, he can just tell by lack of contact that the guy doesn’t seem to know what to do with his hands.
Tony groans as, with a particularly rough thrust, the first knot pops in. His asshole is ruthlessly abused as JAC continues to thrust like a jackhammer, absolutely not giving a single fuck when the knot catches on Tony's rim with each backwards pull.
"...Very well, sir." Tony's best calculator couldn't quantify the amount of long-suffering contained in those three words.
"It's not the robotic aspect that turns you on, is it?" muses the robot while Tony struggles to breathe through a half-crushed windpipe. His hands scrabble uselessly at JAC’s metal arms. "That's just a cover. It's the fact that you made me yourself. The fact that
at him as he finishes what Tony started and wraps his broad palm around Tony’s length, cutting off his gasp with a kiss. Like a jolt of electricity, a second wind of energy rushes through Tony’s system at the contact and before he can think, his hands are in Steve’s hair, his head tilting for a better angle. He sinks his teeth into Steve’s full lower lip, whimpers into his mouth as he strokes Tony off.
“J--JARVIS, deadlock the doors to the workshop,” he manages to say.
The hand disappears from his hip and reappears at his ass, spreading it as the head of the dildo presses hungrily against Tony’s asshole. He did take a moment to clean out before bringing JAC to life, but he didn’t get a chance to stretch himself, assuming that that would be part of the foreplay. JAC, however, doesn’t seem interested in such courtesies; he feels more lube ooze out of the head of the dildo as it pushes determinedly against Tony until the tapered head glides in and he has to bite back a moan.
“Come on, Tony, let’s get you to bed,” says the bot, sliding its arm under his shoulders, and Tony knows he’s supposed to feel comforted, but it just makes that ache grow.
"Uh," says Tony.
Ugh, “dildo machine.” It sounds so… primitive, not at all what he’s going for. But “sex robot” isn’t much better. Maybe he can come up with an acronym for it, like JARVIS. Just A Rather Sexy… Intelligent System… JARSIS? Okay, it’s a work in progress.
On a whim, he grabs the corner of the schematic and scales it up so that it's seven feet tall, looking down at him with those glowing blue eyes.
This slightly flawed, slightly more human rendition of JAC seems to know a little less about what it’s doing, and in that regard, does a much better job. It takes its time, intermittently thrusting languidly and pounding Tony into the ground. He almost forgets about the inflatable knots until he feels them swell against his prostate and cums immediately and gracelessly. For the fourth time, he’s left drooling on the floor, his mind reeling from the afterglow for what JARVIS later confirms was twelve minutes.
"I've thought about this, you know," says Steve, and there's a strained quaver to his voice that gives Tony a rush of satisfaction. "Every time we're on a mission and you get too mouthy. Thought about just shutting you up like this." That is unbelievably hot. Thinking of Steve, in the middle of life-or-death combat, imagining different ways to occupy Tony's smartass mouth--maybe next time they could find an abandoned building close by. Tony can picture it, him flipping up his faceplate, Steve forcing him down on his knees, still in uniform--
Steve breaks the kiss to wrestle Tony’s hands away, gripping both of them in one broad palm, that super-serum strength a rigid vice around his wrists. Then suddenly he’s backed against a wall, his arms pinned above his head, Steve’s unoccupied hand pressing into his groin and he must’ve traveled back in time to his teenage years because he’s hard in his pants already.
“Call me old-fashioned,” Steve growls against Tony’s ear, giving him a squeeze, “but none of your machines can compare to the real thing.”
Steve gives JAC an actual once-over and looks back at Tony, and his expression--it's thoughtful, almost devious, he obviously wants to see Tony made undone, but it's also… longing. It's clear from the look on his face alone that he
"Yeah, yeah--"
"Sir, this is an entirely new and complex system, you should--"
Tony's brain short-circuits.
His back arches into the sensation and he sucks in a breath. “Fuck, fuck, Steve--I’m gonna cum if you keep doing that--”
"JARVIS, you traitor," he mutters under his breath, but the tension in his gut unwinds a little. If it was Bruce, he'd have pieced together Tony's little project before he could say "don't kinkshame me." But Steve? He won't be able to tell a sexbot AI simulation from a game of Pac-man. He holds a finger to his lips at DUM-E and U, who both shift away inconspicuously, and calls out, "Yeah, over here, Cap."
The robot shifts, and Tony can't help the noise that escapes him as he feels solid metal fingers press against the bulge in his jeans and squeeze. "It's more than that," Steve's voice muses. "He might not see the way you look at him, but JARVIS does, and by extension, so do I." The other hand raises to cup the back of Tony's head, fingers carding through his hair in a way that feels threatening. "Your feelings for this fellow are a mess, aren't they?"
“All due respect, sir, but if I make these changes, the suit won’t fit you.”

Tony makes a face. "Okay,
Tony spends the following day walking funny and avoiding Steve, a task which turns out to be surprisingly easy since the guy seems to be alternating his time between the gym and his bedroom. He tries avoiding his workshop, too, but that lasts all of six hours before he gets bored doing… whatever normal people usually do, he guesses? Reading a book on quantum theory that’s always been on his backlog; trying to cook a square meal, failing, and ordering take-out; watching the news; it all feels very constructive for a while, and he thinks it’s helping him get a bit of fresh air so-to-speak after… that… and yeah, it kinda beats drinking himself into a pathetic, self-wallowing stupor, especially knowing that he won’t wake up the next day with a legendary hangover.
It regards him again and, despite him designing its face to be completely cold and impassive, he can tell it's thinking. He can see it in its eyes, the slight tilt of its head. It steps forward again, into his personal space, and leans in close. "How about this?" it asks, in an equally identical reproduction of Steve Rogers.
to find out how it feels to wear electric nipple clamps and a chastity cage while high and getting spitroasted by two bears in gas masks. (It feels intense, by the way. A little too overwhelming for Tony's tastes, though, and he's not sure nowadays how those nipple clamps would interact with the arc reactor.) The point is, he’s curious and demonstrably adventurous, and learned a long time ago that being horny for something unconventional is nothing to be ashamed about.
” when the other option is to choke on Captain America's super-soldier cock. To his genuine surprise, he feels JAC's fingers probing, lube-slicked, at his hole. "What, are you using fingers this time, huh? Guess I should have company over more often if
Minutes later, he's standing before the bot, watching it come to life.
"JARVIS, it's done. Perfect. Build it."
Giving it access to the internet for research purposes is a given, but Tony makes the executive decision to also grant it access to his own private Stark databases, files and personal information on himself and the people around him (as much as he's given access to, at least), as well as everything ever recorded by JARVIS here in Stark Tower and in Malibu. In order for it to take initiative and make decisions, it needs context and information--as much as he can provide.
to you?" Tony asks as he's carried to the sofa.
The hand isn't in his hair anymore but it doesn't matter--as JAC starts pounding into him again, he is completely boneless against the smooth glass of the console, nothing but a vessel. He might be crying. It's hard to tell, there's just a lot of… fluids.
Tony almost asks. Almost
It feels surreal. It feels like a dream, and he has to pull back for a second to just look at Steve, look at his parted lips, his flushed face, his eyes a dark reflection of Tony's own need and desire lain bare between them. "Steve," he whispers. He has so many questions, what are they doing, does Steve have feelings for him or does he just want to bone, does
“You watch--? Okay, we’re putting a pin in that one, because I definitely want to know more about your porn search history later--”
Where was he again? Oh yeah--AI.
He was always going to end up at an AI, he supposes. He names it JAC (Just Artificial Coitus) and programs it to sense physiological changes and adjust accordingly. What follows in his next trial is hands-down the most efficient orgasm he’s ever had, so he goes back to the drawing board on shaky legs to add in a few formulas, stipulations, and even intentional flaws. As earth-shattering as that last round was, he’s determined to teach JAC not just how to fuck, but how to make love.
He puzzles over the last one for a while, wondering just how human he should make this thing. Part of him thinks it would be sexier if it didn't speak--it would be several degrees less human, which thrills him, not to mention the idea of this thing making simulated sex noises makes him feel… uncomfortable to say the least. But what if he wants to engage with it? It's a known fact of his existence that he doesn't shut up during sex (or well, ever, really) unless his mouth is occupied, and the idea of making an endless stream of hilarious and sexy one-liners to something incapable of complimenting his tremendous wit makes something shrivel in his gut.
Steve raises his eyebrows sardonically. “Clearly you've never been in the army in the forties,” he says, passing the towel back to JAC. He grabs Tony’s pants off the floor and helps him put them on. “A group of men in close quarters, missing their wives, experiencing all kinds of horrors together--we helped each other out however we could. Mostly just--handies under the covers, physical intimacy, that sort of thing. Nothing like… this.”
He starts to pant raggedly, sweat beading across his skin as JAC rocks slowly into him, the dildo sinking gradually deeper and deeper. Tony is immensely grateful that it at least has enough restraint to start gentle, but that only lasts a minute before it gets bolder, thrusting a little harder, gripping him a little tighter. By the time the first knot is slamming against his hole, he’s a fucking mess, and his internal monologue is a non-stop stream of
Steve is standing in front of JAC, looking directly into the bot’s eyes with a stern look.
Between the information that's being dumped into it and the state-of-the-art Stark voice-synthesizer, the dialogue and speech options are endless. He could play out a fantasy of fucking Betty White if he wants to.
No, no, he's looking at it all wrong again. He can't program it to do one or the other, he has to teach it how and when to do either and give it the initiative to choose for itself. Of course, programming something to take initiative is easier said than done, and before he knows it, the egg timer dings.
"Help? What do you--"
But it’s there on the edge of his mind, impossible to avoid, much less forget. It’s not even the memory that’s keeping his mind busy, it’s looking forward: his endlessly tinkering brain, constantly analyzing, trying to tell his hands to get down there and tweak a few things in JAC’s construction and programming. The knots were fun, but what if he makes it less textured and focuses on size instead? He’s been fiddling with nanotech lately, he could pretty easily develop a dildo that changes size and shape mid-coitus. And the programming--it’s pretty elegant, but he should probably adjust and test out the algorithm a little, to make sure the bot doesn’t try the same thing every time. As hot as all that was, every healthy masturbation routine needs a little variation.
Tony pauses. “A new AI system.” Not a lie. “Just making a backup in case anything happens to JARVIS.” Okay, that one’s a lie. He shudders to think what would happen if he set JAC loose on the building controls. Although, if he could clear the rest of the team out for a few nights, it might be fun--
It takes him roughly nineteen hours and four cups of coffee to work out a successful simulation of an Iron Man suit that can walk, gesticulate, do Fortnite dances, and fuck like a rabbit without him inside of it pulling the strings. It takes him another six hours to develop the systems necessary for a retractable dildo like the one JAC 1.2 has along with a self-lubricating, self-cleaning fleshlight. He examines his handiwork, scouring for any details he may have missed. The face is like all his other suits: cold and impassive, with narrow eyes and a slit for a mouth. The body is similar in structure, but not in shape; he had asked JARVIS for those changes because he had something more androgynous in mind. He changes the color, making it a dark steel gray with accents of light blue.
"Not until you brush your teeth," Steve says, absently washing the pot he'd used. "And you'd better clean your plate, or you're not getting dessert."
"You saying you're easy, Stark?" Steve says, giving his dick another squeeze that makes him suck in a sharp breath.
"You should tell him how you feel."
He comes to consciousness in the kitchen of all places, sitting upright at the table, a cup of fresh coffee warming his hand. He's just starting to process this when a steaming plate appears on the table before him. A steaming plate with a beautiful, aromatic, perfectly cooked omelet on it.
Steve breaks the kiss to lick and bite a line down Tony’s neck, his collarbone, his chest--Steve pauses to plant a kiss in the center of the arc reactor--his stomach--
"You're welcome." Tony starts to wonder if it's developed some kind of attachment to using Steve's voice. To Tony, it asks, "Should I power down for the night?"
He laughs a little sheepishly. After a moment, he explains, "When you grow up a little guy like me, sometimes--I dunno, I got beat down so many times, the idea of being able to turn the tables on someone… I'd think about it a lot." He shrugs his shoulders. "Watching porn helped some, too."
"I think so? It's kinda like picking up a big cat," says Steve lightly. The sofa is enormous, one of those big sectionals, and he lays Tony down in the cuddle corner like a gentleman before climbing in next to him.
He stares at it dumbly for a moment before lifting his eyes to behold his savior. Steve is standing on the other side of the table, watching Tony with a bemused expression.
Steve honest-to-god
When he finally finishes programming, he leans back in his chair and simply watches for a while, idly sipping coffee as JAC analyzes and integrates all the information it's being given. "What's he thinkin' about, JARVIS?" Tony asks.
back and forth from the shop to his bedroom. Wouldn’t be the first time he’s done the sideways tango on the floor, and it certainly won’t be the last.)
Okay, so he's looked at the armor and felt aroused once. It's now. He's aroused now.
Steve kisses the way he fights: earnestly, straightforward, and with immense force. All of Tony’s lingering concerns that this might somehow be one-sided fly out the window, up into the sky, and through a portal into another world at the way Steve opens for him, all teeth and tongue; the way his hands grab and hold on to Tony like he’ll vanish if he lets go. It feels like hand-to-hand combat, like both of them are fighting, clawing at each other, each trying to impart their feelings as physically as possible. Tony knows he’s lost the battle when he feels Steve’s fingers curl in his hair and pull back, drawing a stuttering gasp from him. Steve’s mouth roves hungrily over his exposed throat. As a last stand, his hands snake around to grab two fistfuls of Steve’s ass through his sweatpants and
created me to be so good at it… You're literally getting off on your own ego." It finally gets his pants open and Tony slumps over the console, lightheaded, dragging in a breath as the robot uses both hands to yank down his pants.
Just for the hell of it, he adds an armature with a self-lubricating, pressure-changing ring on the end, auto-programmed to beat it like it owes him money.
He’s exhausted, more so than he’s been in a long time, but he’s not too tired to murmur, “‘Course I did.”
“JARVIS, pull up the schematics for Mark III,” he says. A life-size hologram of the Mark III armor appears before him, outlined in glowing blue and rotating slowly. He stares at it for a moment, gears turning. “Make it more streamlined. Narrow the shoulders. Broaden the hips a little. The limbs don’t need to have that much meat, neither does the torso.”
Hearing it say both "slut" and “fuck” in Steve’s voice shouldn’t be as hot as it is. "If I am, then I'm doing a damn good job," he gasps.
The eyes and arc reactor flicker on first, glowing that LED white-blue that Tony is so familiar with. "Good morning--or, I think. Morning, night, whatever." It doesn't seem to have heard him. Its head turns a little, its hand lifts, fingers wiggling experimentally. It turns, stepping around him, and he watches it examine its surroundings. "Uh, where you going there, buddy?" It doesn't answer. It taps a console, spins the hologram display that appears at the contact; it takes in the cars along the back wall, the line of other (smaller) suits, the glass case memorializing Tony's first arc reactor; and it waves at DUM-E, who lifts his arm in interest in an exchange that Tony can't decide is touching or concerning.
"No shit."
For as pent up as he is, it doesn’t take long for Steve to catch up. When he cums, he’s balls-deep down Tony’s throat, with a guttural moan and his hand clamped so hard around Tony’s windpipe that he almost passes out. He has enough wherewithal to swallow, at least--practically a basic instinct at this point--and Steve only hesitates a moment to pull out.
"You've always wanted this, haven't you? Even before you met him,” says Steve’s voice behind him, cold and cruel. “The idea of debauching Captain America himself, it's always turned you on, but especially now that he's out of the ice, and exactly as upstanding and
“Is it finally to your satisfaction, sir?” JARVIS asks dryly.
"Over my shoulder, like a sack of potatoes."
That’s what he keeps telling himself--over and over, like he’s practicing for an interview--as he designs this thing.
Steve is enormous, because of course he is; his girth stretches Tony’s jaw to aching. Steve slides forward over Tony’s tongue, and he takes a deep breath through his nose, preparing to suppress a gag, but Steve hesitates and stops. “Are you…” he starts to say.
“Uh,” says Tony again, feeling like God just turned on the brights. “It’s--you know, it’s just a new prototype, I’m experimenting with a few dif--”
As soon as he has breath to speak, he croaks in a strained voice, "Language, Cap."
"Huh?" Tony has almost completely forgotten that the bot itself had just finished cooking, and when he finally connects what Steve's talking about, he stands from his stool so suddenly that he almost knocks it over. Steve looks up in surprise. "Thanks for the breakfast. I'm taking it to-go." He doesn't wait for Steve's nod of approval, just grabs the plate and coffee cup and beelines for the workshop.
"Thanks, but you're not my mom, JARVIS."
of the phrases he taught it when he’s just taken the second knot and is drooling on the floor. (Yes, he tests it out in the workshop like a goddamn animal. He’s got five other Avengers living in his tower, there’s no way he’s going to cart a
and asks, "When was the last time you ate?"
He glances over at Tony, who suddenly feels like a sick, perverted deer in the headlights of God himself. “Uh,” he says, setting down his coffee before the sweat collecting on his palms can drop it for him, “hi?”
the same." Before the bot can say anything else, he adds quickly, "Seriously, go to bed. Let me sleep."
"Your pupils dilated," it says, still with that voice, and of course Tony's body betrays him as he feels all the blood in his head migrate south so rapidly that it leaves him dizzy. "Your pulse spiked, and the temperature in your groin just increased. You programmed me to sense these changes, Tony. You can't deny to me that hearing this voice in this context turns you on."
It's then that Tony feels it: shifting inside of him, JAC's new dildo expands, just a bit, and Tony almost loses it right there, his toes curling at the sensation. The dildo plunges deeper and deeper with every thrust, and his asshole stings with the stretch. JAC grips his hips tighter and he focuses on the bruising pain of its grasp to keep from blowing his load as the dildo swells, little by little, inside of him. He’s glad Steve’s doing all the work up top; it’s all he can do just to keep his mouth open.
"Yes, please." As JAC retreats, Tony remarks to Steve, "I suppose if this," he gestures at the two of them, "is going to be a thing, I won't really need him around, huh?"
“Yeah, just give me a--” Tony pushes himself laboriously up from the console and promptly slides off of it with a grunt. JAC catches him of course, the fucking gentleman that it apparently is now. “Well, that’s not the first time that’s happened.”
“Masturbation rarely is, sir,” JARVIS answers wearily.
"No, no, too weird. Something else. Please."
"So help me, Stark, if you don’t go to bed right now, I

“Hey!” Natasha turned to Peggy in betrayal, “Bucky and I chose that car with care and love, don’t disrespect her.” She paused, before frowning a little and glancing at Steve. “Although I
there is to this, just like any other battle we have. Just like when Clint tried to kill you after getting possessed by Loki, just like how Thor nearly went crazy after Amara magicked the shit outta him- this is just our lives
Tony shook his head and just walked quietly with Steve, holding the baby as carefully as he could until they eventually both slipped into their room a minute later. Steve got to work with setting up the couch, while Tony softly commanded JARVIS to order foods that were suitable for babies to the tower for the morning. He'd probably need formula too, right? He put it on the order.
Clint screamed.
“Don’t fight it, Bruce,” Thor said, “this may be a battle you cannot win.” There was the sound of sighing, but then the door creaked again and when Steve glanced up, the room was empty once more, their friends having swiftly left Steve and Tony to have some alone time.
"Ignore that," he blurted, "just-"
“Why did you say that stuff,” he blurted, “why did you…yesterday. In the hall. With your friends.”
“Yes he would, Thor, for fuck’s sake, some people don’t take well to being hauled around everywhere!” Tony yelled from the floor, and Steve looked down with a cheeky grin at the flustered boy as he folded his arms and got in Thor’s face.
He pulled out his phone with shaking fingers, miraculously still intact and unbroken, and then dialled Tony’s number. He hoped that JARVIS was operating in the suit and would put him through, because he needed to know—Tony had to be safe. They could deal with everything else later, he just had to make sure-
“Steve,” Tony began, and when he dared to look back up again, he saw Tony was staring at him a little helplessly, shaking his head and reaching out for his wrist.
Steve waved when they all turned to look their way and pushed Tony forward as the man spluttered. “I am not… we’re… shut up,” he muttered half-heartedly, dropping his bags at the door. “Did you break anything while we were away? Set anything on fire? Cause a rift in spacetime, maybe?”
He didn’t think an apology was going to cover it this time.
, oh God, oh no-
“So that’s where we go.” Steve smiled his battle-smile, bracing as they landed right on the steps of the facility, Tony shielding Steve from the gunfire on the street as it immediately rained upon them. Steve pulled up his shield and nodded. “Let’s go kick some ass.”
“Are you sure?” Tony asked quietly, looking deep into Steve’s eyes for any sort of doubt.
Steve made a helpless gesture with his hands, reaching for his own pad and flipping to a clean sheet before sketching out a messy drawing of his mobile phone with its bunch of unread texts on his side.
“All fine,” she assured him, raising a hand and stopping him before he could try and move, “safe and well. A few injuries amongst them, but nothing that time won’t fix. It was quite the fight, so I’m told.”
Later that night, Steve lay on his unmade bed, stared at his peeling ceiling, felt the moonlight as it slowly rose up into his window and blanketed itself over his face. His room was dark and silent. It was sometime in the early hours of the morning. Sleep was not even a thought that crossed his mind.
Steve hadn’t really thought about Tiberius Stone all that much. He wasn’t sure why—maybe he’d just been so caught up with worry, so focused on blaming himself, that that shitstain hadn’t really fallen into his mind that many times. There had been more important things to concentrate on, after all.
“No.”
Tony kissed Steve on a Wednesday, the same night that he told the man to stop the surveillance for Bucky.
, Jesus Christ, Tony managed to make
See? Fine.
, you know. Save them for special occasions. Or maybe I’ll do them all at once, and make you my slave for the day.”
Natasha rolled her eyes and then resumed hair-stroking. “You’re going to be fine,” she said, “help is on its way. Focus on the petting I’m giving you right now. This is rare.”
Steve just nodded, a promise. He looked across at Tony and then shut his eyes as a small smile flicked across his mouth. “He’s got a crazy maniacal laugh, you know. Have you heard it? When something is just so funny he can’t control it, his laugh sounds like a super villain. I feel I should be hearing it from Doctor Doom.”
Thor piped up this time, “Tony- we have found ourselves accidentally referring to Steve as our husband just by exposure to your comments. This makes us feel rather odd and embarrassed. It must stop.”
Tony tried not to think about the implications of that too hard as he sat down at the table and placed Peter in his high-chair next to Thor. The rest of the team were sharing glances at him, noticing his tension and wondering whether or not to ask, but Tony saw Steve shake his head minutely in their direction and they hastily began to talk about something different and entirely mundane. Tony appreciated that. The noise was nice. He looked down at Peter as Thor meticulously began to cut up his pieces of soft chicken, brow furrowed with concentration, and the scene made him smile. They’d learned that Peter needed his food squares to be just so, otherwise he’d refuse to eat them, and now Thor had taken to that challenge like the fate of the nine realms depended on it.
They all murmured their agreements and quickly moved on, but Tony noticed that Steve was quiet beside him- he hadn’t ever thought a man could eat potatoes morosely, but Steve seemed to be doing it pretty well. When Tony squeezed his thigh and raised his eyebrows askingly, however, Steve merely schooled his face back into a smile and then shook his head, quickly slipping back into the conversation and giving Tony the impression it wasn’t something that needed talking about.
Of all the ways Tony could’ve been spending his Christmas eve, this was
“It is, actually,” Pepper said with a sharp smile, “because if you suddenly decide to change your mind, or you hurt him- which everyone else has so far- then it will be us and Thor who have to pick him up off the ground and stop him doing something undoubtedly stupid to try and compensate for it. I’ve seen quite enough of Tony dealing with loss to last a lifetime, and if I never watch him go through it again it’ll be too soon. So,” she shrugged, looking at him with raised eyebrows, “we just want to know how you feel about him.”
After a final round of call, Steve spotted him. Knelt in the snow, someone else tucked up in his arms. Her red hair was covered with snow, and Steve felt his heart drop. He lowered his gun and raced forward, calling out their names. Rhodey saw him and instinctively raised his own weapon a fraction before he recognised Steve. “Oh thank God,” the man said, “took you long enough.”
“Why are you up here, dad?” Tony asked with a small note of resignation in his voice, “you should probably go sleep it off. It’s still early in the day-“
When Steve chuckled to himself, Tony’s fingers flexed around his waist. “Can we have sex please?” he mumbled, almost on autopilot at the sound of Steve next to him.
Tony grinned and shook his head, yelping with surprise when he felt Steve suddenly decide to lick his neck and suck messily on the underside of his jaw. Seemed Steve was rather fond of the PDA when he’d had some of that Asgardian Mead. Tony attempted to sit up, but Steve simply kissed him on the mouth and pushed him back down again. He tasted like honey and apples.
“Thank you for coming, by the way,” Steve told him quietly, “I know you probably could’ve been doing a ton of more interesting things.”
“You asked,” he said in the end, churning out each word slowly as if he was putting thought into each syllable, “earlier this morning, why I hung out with all those assholes in my year. I think, really, that it was sort of decided for me from the very beginning.”
“Sure, buddy,” he said, giving Steve’s leg a friendly kick, “you invite who you want. Although if you do that every time we annoy you about Tony Stark, you’re gonna have a full-fledged house party on your hands by the end of tomorrow.”
Okay. So maybe the morning was looking up, after all.
Jesus, the thoughts that sprang into his mind at that moment… Steve would’ve been embarrassed if he wasn’t quite so desperate. As it was, he was a second away from grabbing Tony by the collar and dragging that stupid tank top right off his stupid chest-
That was what this had all been for.
Steve just didn’t like it. That was okay.
Tony kisses him again before he can finish the sentence, because now he’s aware that Steve actually, for whatever reason, wants him too, there is no stopping him. Steve is a hell of a kisser, and Tony wants more.
“I’m allowed to be rude, you started a fight with the person who gave me a lift home.”
“Man,” Bucky swallowed and looked down, “I’m so sorry. You must’a put up a heck of a fight for it, though.”
He heard someone knock on the door, and checked his watch. Natasha, undoubtedly- there to try and offer them whatever aid she could. Possibly in the form of Russian Vodka- although Steve would not be participating in the consumption of that. It tasted like nail varnish remover. Either Sam or Bucky opened the door, and a few seconds later Steve heard the room opposite go mysteriously silent.
Also, he was fucking gorgeous. Steve was man enough to admit that was a big factor, here.
Anyway- Clint had been talking about his years in the circus, and how they’d taught him all sorts of weird ways to contort your body for the extra showmanship.
Tony had time. Pack his stuff, get out, maybe to one of his apartments in Europe or something. Just for a little while. He’d come back for the team, of course. He just needed... time. So did Steve, he thought. And it wouldn’t fix things. The team would ask questions and Tony would have to figure out a reason, and Steve would be upset- but he had to. He had to.
“Mmm,” Steve murmured, shifting a little under Tony’s touch. He cracked open an eye, confused. “Mornin’.”
“Sir arrived home from school last night and informed me that he was not going to be welcome for much longer in his home, and so he made the decision to relocate me into a miniaturised version of the system that he had installed in his room and workshop that night,” JARVIS said, and Steve felt his stomach drop.
“Something doesn’t have to be permanent to be good,” Steve responded eventually, and Tony opened his mouth, but Steve pressed a finger against his lips before he could try and argue. “Please let me talk, Tony. If we lived our lives thinking about how bad it was going to feel when the nice things stopped, or when the good times ended, we’d never be happy at all. Can’t you just… just let yourself have this? For once?”
On the third day of sitting outside Tony’s room and checking with the Doctors that he was improving, he heard a sharp voice from the window. “I can see you, you know, idiot.”
“Why did you have to leave me?” He asked through gritted teeth, and the rain was making his hair wet; it fell into his eyes uncomfortably, but if he unclenched his hands from where they were held by his sides just then he might end up hitting something, so he just left it there. “Why did you have to go when I fucking needed you?”
“Look at you,” Rumlow said as he punched Steve again, the other hand curling around his windpipe, “I always said you were more looks than talent. This took, what, half a minute? Maybe less? You’re fucking pathetic. Killing you will be a
“If I don’t get up and go to work we’re going to lose all our money and live in a box,” he declared, turning his head into Steve’s hair and nodding solemnly, “Do you want to live in a box, Steve?”
Another silence. Tony saw Peter glance down at the LMD on the ground and then begin to sniffle in distress. “Must be a hell of a lot to take in, huh?” Tony whispered to him, turning them away from the body on the floor swiftly. He hoisted Peter up, ignoring how it spiked painfully against his ribs. The LMD had probably turned his skin an unhealthy shade of blue under his shirt, but he’d live.
“Probably ‘bout… three hours, if you don’t fuck up.”
The room he was in was a sterile white, full of metal trays and machinery. Steve was laying on a cot extending from the wall, and the rhythmic beeping sound coming from somewhere above his head told him that he was probably hooked up to a monitor or two. He attempted to shift a little, and found that the pain was still there, but far less prevalent than the last time Steve had been conscious. That was certainly a positive. Maybe the stab-wound hadn’t gone as deep as he’d previously imagined.
Tony’s face fell, and he looked down, his fingers settling on Steve’s knee. “I know it means nothing, but I really am sorry that you… that that was how you were feeling, Steve—”
“Tony,” he choked, grabbing hold of Bucky’s shoulder and looking him in the eyes, “is that… he’s…”
“It’s okay,” Steve said, voice calm and gentle as he pulled Tony’s head into his neck and wrapped his strong arms around Tony’s shoulders, embracing both Tony and Peter in a hug. “it’s over now. Peter’s here. He’s not going to be hurt like that again. We won’t let them.”
matter, I just want to know what I’m doing wrong here, okay? Is it… I know I’m new to this stuff, but- but I dunno, you could maybe just, tell me where it is I’m fucking up or someth-“
“I know you’ve got a death-count in the triple digits,” Steve said quietly, holding the desk tight, “I know you’ve been stealing weapons, raiding SHIELD bases. I know you’re the world’s most wanted terrorist—”
Tony was talking too much, trying to fill the horrible void between them with words about anything and everything he could think of. Steve wasn’t talking enough, too busy thinking over every word he wanted to say and wondering how Tony would take it. He felt the rest of the team’s eyes on them constantly- they couldn’t help it and they were doing it to try and make up for all that they’d missed before, but every time Steve saw them watching him he just wanted to throw up again. He hadn’t slept in days, and he knew that Tony hadn’t either. Whether that was because Steve was there, or just because he couldn’t, Steve didn’t know. But every time he suggested he leave, Tony panicked and began to apologize again, and it shattered Steve’s resolve every single time. He couldn’t leave knowing Tony blamed himself for this. He just couldn’t.
Oh God, it was agony.
For now, though, he’d enjoy the moment he was currently in. Which included a tantalisingly close Steve Rogers, an achy leg that he needed to remember not to jostle too much, and a late Christmas dinner with his closest friends.
Tony froze up, keeping very still as Steve slowly padded into the bathroom, showering for a minute to get the sweat off and then quickly brushing his teeth. It’d been about two hours since their blowup in the kitchen, and so Tony should have been asleep. But instead he was wide awake, thinking of everything he’d done wrong. He needed to be better for Steve if he wanted to keep him, and that needed to start by Tony toning it down with the flirting. Maybe he’d thought Steve didn’t mind it before, but now he was aware, and he had to keep Steve happy. That was what was important.
“I’ve thought about what I could show you.” Mrs. Wilson told him and disappeared into a room. She walked out with some colorful prints in her hands. “They are a bit old, but I guessed you’d have a laugh.” She handed them to Steve and that’s when he realized they were comics.
They only stopped at the penthouse and she followed him out, he walked around the spacious lounge. She studied all of him, she felt dumb for the first time of her life. She did her homework on Howard, but Tony Stark wasn't on the guest list and she hadn't seen his face that many times to care. But now every single similarity was apparent, the way he talked, the way he expressed himself and the features of his face.
She walked into Tony Stark’s high tech mansion with the best view in Los Angeles, got greeted by an actual AI and braced herself to be deafened, just a day like any other. Her heels clicked as she headed for the basement, saving herself the time searching for him in any other place.
-----
Tony nodded shakily and clutched the neck of the bottle of whiskey still lying on the cover. However the results didn’t change, not for the second time or the fourth. Tony threw back his head to get a big gulp of the beverage.
"I'm not the greatest storyteller, but I hope you're happy with it. Kisses, Clint." He drew a stick figure dog at the end. She let her hands fall to her lap with the letter still in her hold. "This is what you worked on for this long?" she asked playfully.
Steve sped by him and turned towards the park, he didn’t look back, he could feel Sam being competitive and trying his best, running after him the best he could.
I try :/
“Tony I can’t—“
“When was the last time you’ve slept?” she asked while studying the dark bags under his eyes. Tony looked at his wrist like he was wearing a watch.
Natasha got out of the car and left the boys to change clothes. Steve listened to Clint swear up storms, because he had to change pants as well and why did nobody tell him to already come in jogging pants.
The voice was gently, almost worried and definitely of a girl. “Pepper?” he asked, his brows furrowed in confusion. “What are you doing here?”
"He probably hates everybody in the room." Pepper stated, raising an eyebrow.
“We’re just making sure he feels comfortable, it must be a huge shock to wake up in another century.” Natasha explained.
“This is what I could find.” Tony ran his eyes over the information about his new friend. “Natasha Romanoff, age 17, Russian spy. Special level authorization.” Jarvis cited the first few data.
“Okay, let’s not go too fast!” Clint marched up next to Steve. “You can fly, big deal, what else can you do?” He asked crossing his arms in front of his chest.
“Straight to the point, Captain, I see.” Fury unlocked the door and motioned for Steve to enter. Fury walked behind his desk, placing the cup on his desk and shimmying out of his coat. “Sleep well?” he asked to fill the silence.
"Of course, I'm not throwing you in to the sharks right away. You won't be going alone." He paced around his desk, getting closer to Clint and then leaning against his desk. Clint wanted to protest at first, that he'd be fine, but did not have time nor the balls to do it. "You're going to accompany Ms. Romanoff."
He turned around slowly, panting as his occupied brain registered all the work his body did.
“We’ll never know.” Natasha shrugged and walked out of the elevator. “Now if you excuse me boys I have a party to get ready for.” She disappeared out of sight when the elevator closed.
“Hold on a minute, what is happening?” Pepper put up a hand to stop Tony from rambling and making quick decisions.
"I get it." Tony turned around with the best shit eating grin he could muster up at that moment. "Don't worry I'll at the other half of the country by tomorrow."
Natasha shook her head at his silly behavior, but a small smile played on her lips. They continued sorting through the documents. When all the boxes were gone Clint splayed on the floor. The rest of the work was on other agents now.
“Which one would you like to watch? Floor 32, 33 or 34?” Jarvis asked politely and Tony sat down on the bed with his newly found glass.
"Yeah, let's get you some water." she nodded and with a hand on his back she ushered him up the stairs.
Tony draped a hand over her shoulders. "My girlfriend." he answered and Natasha didn't argue, this was a safe way to disguise herself considering the circumstances.
The team headed to Nick Fury’s office, Steve leading and everybody else in tow. They looked like an unstoppable force surging through the corridors.
“That’s an M?” Clint exclaimed. “I thought he was called like Hekael or something.” Clint snatched back the document and looked at it from up close.
She cleared her throat loudly enough to get his attention. “Mr. Stark.”
She walked closer to Tony who was helping himself to a drink at the small bar. He walked up to her with two glasses and offered one to her. She took it with a sigh, she was underage, but Tony Stark wouldn't put anything in her drink, she knew that.
Steve complied, but they didn’t talk about secret agents or that Steve wasn’t from around here. They talked about simple things, things Steve should worry about if he was a normal nineteen year old.
"Hey! I tried my best!" Clint whined in his defense, looking up at Natasha.
"Oooh, Sam's got a girlfrien--" Clint couldn't finish teasing him when Steve slapped his back and he thought he'll die right there.
“Training’s tough, but not the worst, I guess.” He shrugged getting up from the couch and forcing Tony’s legs off to the ground. He walked toward the little bar close to the kitchen, after Tony gave up on the topic of the conversation.
They sat in complete silence, only Clint’s scribbles audible. He was writing slowly, trying to form the letters as neatly as he could.
Steve noticed before it could happen and caught the fist intended for his face in an iron grip. The puncher looked the most surprised, but every face made by the group entertained Steve.
“You don’t want to know.”
She fumbled with her earring, so maybe she could hear what the others think but only got static.
“By the way,” Sam elbowed him. “What you did weeks ago was super cool.” He smiled, he had a very sincere and proud expressions, it reminded Steve of someone. “Tell me your secret, I need to get this buff as well!” Sam laughed, scrunching his eyes.
“I’m a fine reader! But have you seen these signatures!! Why can’t we sort these by alphabetical order or something? Why the persons?” the frustration must have built up in him and he just let it out now.
“Yes, sir.” Jarvis brought up video footage from the outdoor cameras.
“They’re nice.” Natasha felt a kind of warmth fill her up. “So, you’re part of the team from now I’m guessing?”
“I think I’m getting the hang of this.” He smiled between puffs and toweling his forehead.
Steve couldn’t help, but smile with him, it was refreshing to be with someone not so emotionally exhausted like most agents. Someone who actually acted his age, Clint was lively, but he had his limits and behind all the sunshine, he had to rest.
“What?” he narrowed his eyes.
She followed him into the elevator, not listening to the questions of her teammates, which Fury didn't answer. She stood beside him while he grinned and put his finger on the print reader and they moved up.
"What?! Really? She know about this?" he asked, standing from his chair to be at least a little closer to eye level with Fury.
He reached the group of teenagers, with the little girl hiding behind one of them, easily with superhuman speed.
They eventually reached the Wilsons’ house. Steve got out of the car and waved goodbye to Maria. He rang the bell once, then when nobody answered he pushed the button again. He wasn’t a technological prodigy, but he was confident in his bell skills.
