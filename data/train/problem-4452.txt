Sam had declared that the entire room was ‘a mood’, whatever that meant. Dean had rolled his eyes and flicked his brother’s ear in response. He found the room aesthetically pleasing, so screw what anyone else thought.
She slid the paper over to Angel, but he made no attempt to pick up the pen. Instead, he shrunk back into the seat, as if he was afraid. Strangely, his reaction this time was even stronger than when Dean had asked him to write his name. Maybe it was because Eileen had asked him, rather than Dean, or maybe it was because she’d asked him for more than just his name. Whatever the reason, it was painful to see him in such distress.
Now they were closer to the floor pattern, Dean could see that they were tiles, and each one bore an Enochian letter. He was certain that they would be in danger if they got this wrong, and he just knew that whoever created this had to have gotten their inspiration from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. “Wait a minute. We gotta go across this thing?”
Dean didn’t really want them to kill Ash, even though he was irritating as fuck. “Wait a minute! We're not going anywhere without a Hand of God,” he insisted, holding up his hands to get them to stop. “We need a plan. Bobby, I need a diversion to clear the area of those things. Then, Crowley and Sam and I will go get the Hand of God. Jo, get up on that ridge. If you see them come back, give me a signal, all right?”
“'Cause I died in that episode,” Ash shouted hysterically.
"That's great," Dean smiled back. He meant that, too; he knew that playing video games wasn't going to magically fix the guy's problems, but it sure was nice to see him having fun.
Dean began to wonder if giving Angel a beer had been a good idea. He’d taken one sip, but hadn’t touched it since. He got up and went to the kitchen, coming back with the bottle of orange juice and a glass. “Help yourself,” he urged, as he sat back down.
As Dean dried himself off, he was hit with a wave of guilt. His jerk-off session had felt so good, but how was he supposed to look Angel in the eye now, knowing what he’d just done. It had been all kinds of wrong, but Dean was just going to have to get over it, or Angel would know that something was up.
“Go for the eyes, like in season one, episode twenty two!” Bobby added, helpfully.
“Jo is?” Dean questioned. “She knows how to do the spell correctly, right?”
Angel’s eyes lit up at the sight of the shirt, with its image of the main dragon from Dagon’s Dragons, and he smiled happily. Dean went back to the bathroom, picked up the scissors, and cut two slits into the back, just as he’d done with the other shirt, then he brought it to Angel and helped him put it on. He didn’t flinch as much when Dean touched his wings, but he did make a noise in his throat that Dean couldn’t quite identify.
Angel did as Dean suggested - Dean did his best not to stare - then when the shampoo was all rinsed away, Dean passed Angel the body wash.
“You need my help, or can you make it on your own?” Dean gestured towards the bathroom door on the other side of the living room.
“They're dying,” Balthazar observed, sadly.
“Well, I can see that,” Dean replied, with an eye roll. “Just let me explain? Please?”
Dean started to regain his composure as Castiel let go of his cock and removed his hand, and Dean belatedly wondered how uncomfortable it was going to be walking around with the evidence of his orgasm coating the inside of his underwear.
Sam and Dean, meanwhile, were doing everything they could to get Crowley to come back inside. Sam was conflicted, because a part of him just wanted to tell Dean to go screw himself and leave too, but he was a professional - unlike his brother - and didn’t want to let the fans down.
Dean patted him on the head and scratched behind his ears, while Angel watched on with interest.
“Me, too.” Gabriel joined him by the door, with a defiant look on his face.
The smile on Angel's face disappeared, as he wiped the tear away with his thumb and regarded Dean with concern.
lieve so,” Dean said with a chuckle, as a look of understanding crossed Cas’s face.
Dean was astonished at how realistic the whole scenario was, and how everyone played their part. He pointed at Loki’s image, and said to Samandriel, “It’s good,” hoping he was conveying to the man how impressed he was.
“Fuck... oh, fuck,
“You got it. And thanks, Eileen, for being so understanding,” Dean said, hugging her goodbye. He saw her out, then returned to the living room to find Angel practising the signs.
“Come on, we’re...” Sam started, giving Jo his best puppy dog eyes. “We’re counting on you to save him.”
“Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?” Dean attempted to throw a punch, and Crowley put his hands around Dean’s throat. As they started trading blows, he hoped Crowley could remember the fight choreography.
When Angel didn’t react, Dean picked up his right hand and placed it on the shirt, making him twist his body awkwardly. He briefly held the hand in place and pressed down; he was trying not to hurt the guy, but he could see in his eyes that this action caused him pain.
After Jo had explained her plan to Ash and Hannah, they had run out of their hiding place and lured Loki’s men to the room they were in earlier, where Jo had opened the rifts. With a flash and a few wisps of smoke, she had reopened the rift to the world containing the werepire, and they were caught unaware when Ash and Hannah shoved them through it.
Dean had poured Angel a glass of water and added some ice cubes, and he drank it as greedily as he did every other drink. It was hard not to stare, as a stray drop of water escaped and ran down his chin. Not staring became even harder when Angel licked his lips seductively. At least that's how it felt to Dean anyway.
Dean wondered, as he took his computer out of his pocket and said ‘door cam’ into it to see who was there.
“You don’t think he…?” Benny peered at him now, curiosity definitely piqued.
Speaking of hard… Dean was so turned on, and not just because of what Angel was doing with his mouth. The way he was taking charge was all kinds of hot, and Dean had to admit that this was something he always enjoyed. Being taken care of wasn’t something Dean experienced very often, but the bedroom was the one place he felt comfortable letting that happen.
Sam thrust a bowl under his face just in time, as his stomach emptied its contents. He hadn’t eaten or drunk anything since breakfast, and he could see undigested bits of the meal Cas and Claire had made him. It was disgusting, and fucking painful, but there were many questions swirling around his mind, that helped to distract him.
Dean didn't say a word; he didn't need to. It was blindingly obvious that Angel was terrified of Chuck, and it didn't take a genius to work out that he was behind Angel's trauma.
Angel nodded and seated himself in the middle of the sofa, flanked on either side by Dean and Eileen. She reached over and patted his hand, as Sam pulled the chair closer, then sat down as well.
“Hundreds of angels to disappear, and us to die, just because of you!” Crowley was starting to get into his stride now, just a little bit too realistically.
This was pretty much how things continued over the next two weeks, with very little change occurring, other than Dean instituting an exercise routine for them every morning to counteract the effects of them not going out. The almost daily lessons with Eileen helped them exponentially increase their ASL knowledge, and every day Angel showed signs of a growing independence. Plus, Angel received his specially adapted shirts from Benny.
“I could stay. I mean… Claire might need me,” he said in a rush, his face colouring adorably.
“Tech Value Electronics Superstore!” Jo said, with fake enthusiasm.
Angel put his chin on Dean’s shoulder, and his entire body was plastered against him in a warm, comforting embrace. Dean hummed the tune he’d been composing as he worked, and after a few moments, Angel joined in. It might have been a horrible, traumatic few hours since the events of yesterday evening, but Dean was glad to be able to provide Angel with his favourite food, music, and closeness. He wasn’t naïve enough to think that this would be a cure for his trauma, but it could give him comfort, and that was something that was sorely needed right now.
Cas managed a smile at that, and nodded his head as they shook hands.
Angel’s teeth were now chattering, and the air had become uncomfortable with the way the dampness was mixing with the relative warmth of the enclosed space. The windows were fogged up and Dean swore he could see the steam rising from Angel, who hadn’t moved an inch, he noticed.
“You can do it, Jo! It's up to you!” Dean called out.
Dean was still smarting from the ‘old man’ comment, but he didn’t react to it. “He’s got wings,” he blurted out, stopping Claire in her tracks.
Angel looked at him in surprise, and a shy smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.
He was about to stand up, when Angel turned onto his back and stared up at him, gently taking hold of his wrist. Dean froze. His heart was pounding, and his breaths became shallow, and caught in his chest. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Angel’s, but he knew that the other man was similarly affected, from the way his chest had begun to rise and fall rapidly.
Resisting the urge to touch his hand, Dean instead asked, "How's it feeling now?"
? After pressing the button, he looked once again at the face of the guy he realised he was now subconsciously referring to as Angel, to find him staring up at him again. Despite the apparent lifelessness in his dull grey eyes, Dean found them almost hypnotising, and he had trouble focusing on anything else for a moment.
Dean was sure he was babbling, but Angel was staring at him again, and this time he didn’t look too pleased. He finger spelled ‘no’, before Dean put out his hand to stop him.
Dean realised that this was the perfect opportunity to call up Benny with his request, so he went back to the bedroom and left Angel to it, shutting the door behind him before sitting on the bed. He thought that it might alarm Angel if he knew Dean was discussing him with someone else.
Angel’s smile reappeared, and he blushed adorably. Dean found that pretty funny, considering what they’d gotten up to last night. “You going all bashful on me, Angel?”
am I glad you made a move.”
“If you got any more problems with the guy, just, you know, give me a call,” Dean said, really hoping he would hear from Blue Eyes before the day was out.
Obviously he was outside.
Cas grinned, and that made him look even more attractive, if that was possible. “So it would seem.”
The wait for the elevator seemed interminable, and at one point he considered taking the stairs instead. When it finally arrived he pressed the button frantically, as if that action would get him to the store faster.
“I am,” Cas replied, going over to Dean and taking hold of his hand.
In fact, by the time Dean and the other hunters went off to the other world to retrieve the replacement Hand of God, Castiel had had enough of staring at Dean’s mouth, and he planned to find a secluded spot upon Dean’s return, to show him the strength of his desire. He wanted more than anything to experience sexual intimacy with the most attractive human in existence... to entwine his grace with the brightest soul he had ever encountered.
“I’m sure I can think of something,” Cas murmured, before pressing forward and proving that he could indeed think of something.
Dean thought.
“Before we travel to Heaven, please let me know if you have any requirements. Weapons, documents, personnel,” Inias continued eagerly.
“It wouldn’t fit him anyway.” Benny laughed, and clapped Dean on the shoulder. “Did you even look at it?”
The cut looked clean and pretty neat, and if Dean didn't know any better he would have thought that it was at least a week since he'd put the stitches in. Now that he looked closer, Dean noticed that the graze on Angel's face was much more faded than it should have been.
Dean went back to the Dean cave to pick up as many of the games he had stashed there as he could carry, and dumped them on the library table.
The sound of laughter came floating down the hallway, growing increasingly louder until Castiel and a whole host of angels burst into the room, clearly finding something hilarious.
The guy with the book then spoke into his angel radio in some kind of strange language. It was probably some made up language,
Claire pouted, and threw herself onto the sofa with a huff. Thankfully, Eileen sat down next to her, saying, “I wanted to come with you. I want to kill Chuck as much as anyone here, but I think it’s best if I stay here with Claire.”
Con, and Dean Winchester and the rest of the cast are no-shows here at the big event, much to the disappointment of all these fans,” the news reporter announced, solemnly. Ed, of course, knew exactly why they were no-shows.
“Angel, it’s good to meet you… finally.” Sam extended his hand to Angel in greeting. “Good luck with this one… you’ll need it.”
“Yes!” Sam shouted.
Thankfully, Sam jumped in before Dean completely lost it with the guy. He always did seem to know the right thing to say.
Dean and Castiel jumped forward, and the spikes they’d just passed sprung out behind them.
The lights in Heaven were flickering as the power fluctuated, and Dean wasn’t sure if this was because the Hand of God had been destroyed, or because so many angels had disappeared… or a combination of the two. What he did know was that the situation was critical, and if he was going to save them, he needed to act before it was too late. He especially had to get back to rescue Castiel.
. Was this really happening? Was Cas really offering whatever Dean wanted? They were sitting on opposite sides of the table, so he couldn’t quite do what he wanted, which was to grab Cas by the tie and yank him forward into a kiss. One of them was going to have to move, and Dean wasn’t sure he was physically able to right now. There was something else he wanted, though.
Obviously Balthazar had missed out on Loki, and all of his diabolical scheming.
Sam sighed, and pulled out of Dean's embrace. "Please don't hide shit from me again, 'k?"
“Did it ever occur to you, had you been more supportive, that we might have been able...” Dean started, about to point out that they could have had a thing if she’d been so inclined. He didn’t finish that thought, however, because he was interested in someone else now, plus they had stopped in front of a temple-like structure. It was huge and imposing, and although its appearance suggested it was long-abandoned, Dean couldn’t help marvelling at it.
This happiness was short-lived, however, when Crowley stormed off, without another word, the others following behind him. “You're going? Crowley, this is not... I'm not kidding here. This isn't some kind of prank! I'm not kidding. Guys, guys, listen. Come on.”
“I don’t get it,” Gabriel said, eventually. “I like a good joke, but that just wasn’t funny.”
Dean was perfectly happy to spend the rest of the evening doing this, and that was more or less exactly what happened; they changed games a few times, and stopped to eat, but the controllers never left their hands, and they hardly moved from the sofa.
Dean tripped over his foot and hit the wall. “Ow, shit. That hurt. Uh no, don’t call Cas.”
“Missed me already?”
“How did you do that?” he asked.
“And who, or what, is rebuilding your faith?” Bec asked.
“Oh cool.”
Castiel pushed his plate towards Dean, who took it happily.
Rowena sighed. “So stubborn, aren’t you? What do you really have to hide?”
Castiel knew it was for the best.
“What’d she say?” Dean asked.
He would return to heaven, tell Zachariah he had failed, and then he would send someone else to kill Dean Winchester.
Dean lifted the covers up from his face. “Alcohol. Apparently.”
“Bobby?”
Dean has always really liked kissing, but when Cas kissed him it was different. His kiss was soft. Also a little shy, but soft nonetheless. It was much different than all those hungry desperate women he kissed before.
“We could call Cas,” Sam suggested.
“You’ll think about what I said?” Bobby asked.
Dean grabbed a set of keys out of his pocket and tossed them at Sam. They fell a few feet away from his brother.
“Hold on, I’ll get you some medicine,” Sam said, hurrying out of Dean’s room.
“Yeah right, okay, and I’m a unicorn,” Dean said.
“Damn. Guess we’re going to Church,” Dean said.
“I do not understand. Why is killing an insignificant human in our best interests?” Castiel asked. It wasn’t his job to ask questions. It was not Zachariah’s job to give answers.
“When you wanted to talk to me,” Dean continued. “Is this what you wanted, Cas?”
Uriel did nothing as Castiel stormed out of the guest room. He searched the living room, the kitchen, and the other bedrooms. There was no sight of Dean. Or Sam, or even Bobby.
Sam was always patient with him. He genuinely cared about Dean. Of course Sam would love Dean no matter what. Why couldn’t he just hold on to that? Why did this have to be so difficult?
He hurriedly tried to change the subject by saying, “We’ll hunt that witch down, and it’ll be over with. No need to worry.”
“I’m like, a few feet away from you,” Dean said.
“Hey, Sam,” Jo threw a wink in Sam’s direction. “Bobby.”
“Yes, Dean. If we leave now, it’ll look weird.” Sam said.
“Of course, she’s our witch, Sammy. Who else could it be?”
Dean shrugged his shoulders. “We’ll come up with something. Did you come across any spells, rituals, or dead birds?”
The next day, Dean woke up totally wrecked.
“I like to believe so,” Bec said.
“Lore on angels?” Dean asked.
Bobby shrugged. “Surely you’re interested in him.”
Sam grinned, “oh yeah, makes sense. Don’t you have two contacts on that thing?”
Castiel turned and found Uriel standing behind him. He stared at him smugly, as if he knew the doubt the angel was feeling.
he thinks.
Bobby sighed. “Of course, one of you boys would come home with an angel following you. I don’t know why the hell he’s here, but figure it out.”
staying with us?”
“Well, I hate to ruin the fun but we’ve got some business to take care of,” Dean said. He dragged Sam and Castiel into the hotel room, then he closed the door.
“Vampires are real. Angels are not. I’ve never seen an angel.”
“Well, go sit with the others.”
Dean said, “as I already stated, it’s a little creepy. But it’s fine.”
Of course he was.
The next time he saw Dean, he seemed thrilled to see him.
When they arrived at Bec’s house, it was just as tidy and lovely as Dean had imagined. The grass was perfectly green, and the house was surrounded by neatly manicured rose bushes. It’s unmistakably a witch’s work.
“Dean?”
“O-okay-
“What?” Dean asked.
“I am not human,” Castiel said.
Dean was the one who lit his dead ass on fire. He watched that damn ghost burn, along with his bones. He was certain there was nothing left haunting that Church. But better safe than sorry.
Dean, this isn’t what I was,
“You do?”
“Of course that’s why,” Zachariah snapped. “After I got that filthy witch drunk enough, she started rambling on and on about random things she knew about the future. She spilled a thing or two about the two of you. I knew there was only one solution. That being Dean Winchester six feet under.”
Dean knew it was Cas when he said, “Uh.”
Why was Castiel feeling such things, then?
Castiel frowned. “Do what?”
“Uh, hey.”
Bec glanced the two over. “You were never curious about faith.”
“Oh man,” Sam pushed past his brother. He said to Jo, “do you see what I’ve been dealing with for weeks now?”
“Shut up,” Castiel said, before he leaned forward and kissed him.
“Not to some,” Castiel said.
“I didn’t know you guys went here,” Bec said.
“Really?” Sam said. “Hm, odd. So you finally spoke your truth then?”
Castiel went up to the table the Winchesters sat at.
“I could call Cas, and he can get some pie,” Sam said.
It was well past midnight when the two returned to the bunker.
to that,” Dean corrected.
Castiel’s stomach turned. “That’s really why you sent me to kill him?”
Dean hiccupped. “That’s for sure.”
“Feeling better?” Sam asked.
“Was not!”
Cas reached over and switched the light on.
After the Church service was over, Dean and Sam sought out Bec. They caught up with her outside the Church.
There was a reason Dean Winchester was chosen to die.
“Uh, yeah actually,” Sam said.
Sam got up and left the table.
He had a point. “Okay, yeah, just hurry up.”
Dean shrugged. “Eh, it’s been a wild day, huh? Lost dad, next thing I know, I got myself a pretty boy angel,” he laughed. “Just my luck.”
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked defensively.
To suggest an angel grew such an attachment, or felt anything at all, was absurd. Castiel wasn’t in love with Dean Winchester. He
Dean added, “He’s nowhere to be found.”
Sam snorted. “Wait, you’re scared you’ll say something to him?”
Dean pulled back, grinning at him. “You happy to see me, Cas?”
When anyone brought up heaven, the first word that came to mind was tiring. Yet to humans it must not be as tiring as it is to angels. Castiel had been stuck in heaven with his brothers and sisters for centuries. There was nothing but endless white walls, and angels bickering left and right.
“What are you so afraid of, Dean?”
“God, please tell me I didn’t read this wrong,” Dean’s voice was rough.
“Dean?-”
“Dean?” Cas pressed.
So, that’s when Castiel crawled in the back of Dean’s car, joining the hunt.
Sam coughed. “He’s more into this faith stuff than I am.”
“Hell no. You should drive.”
“An angel?” Sam asked. “There are angels?”
pulled Dean out of his thoughts. Sure was a random ass thing to say. As if he could even be interested in a hookup right now.
Castiel had assumed telling them Heaven ordered him to kill Dean would not be appreciated. So, he stuck with, “I’m a friend.”
Sam visibly relaxed. “That’s okay.”
“You look worse than you sound,” Sam said, laughter in his tone. “Wow. Uh, I made you some bacon?”
Sam’s face flushed red. “They’re uh, in the middle of something.”
It was the sensible thing to do. The right thing to do. The thing any loyal, respectable angel would have done a long time ago.
“Why not?”
Sam sighed. “How bad?”
Dean could not lie to him. Literally. “Man, it still feels like shit.”
same problem.
“You need some serious help,” Bec said. “Get out of my house. Right now. And don’t ever come back.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Yeah, I think it’s okay.”
“Nah,” Dean said.
“It’s nothing, really,” Bec said.
“Be what way, Dean?”
“More than enough.”
Dean was right, it had been easy. Castiel didn’t understand how the brothers could just walk into the hotel acting like they own the place and immediately get a second key to room 33.
Cas felt the same way about him.
“sounds great. Man, my head is killing me.”
“The hell are you following us for, huh?” He grabbed Castiel’s shoulder.
“You sure?” Dean teased.
“Three drinks, tops.” Dean rubbed his forehead. “I already felt weird after the first one.”
“I’ll be fine, Cas,” Dean reassured.
“What’s heaven like?”
“Will do, and thank you again.” Sam said.
“Heaven sent me for Dean,” he corrected Sam.
“Sam’s shampoo is actually pretty nice, and I tried it a couple of times,” Dean said. It was the truth.
And it was simple, and it was complex. And it was so warm, and Cas was grabbing onto his jacket now, and Dean reached out. He wasn’t sure what he was reaching out to; he just needed
Castiel shook his head. He was sure this nagging prick at his skin is what humans would call frustration. “I do not understand what gives off the impression that I am homeless.”
“I don’t see how I could fit in your pocket, Dean,” Castiel pointed out.
“Whatever.”
“Yeah?”
“Buffer,” Dean added. “Also kind of ugly, from battles and shit I don’t know or to scare away humans, but you just look really pretty.”
“I worry you would be afraid of me if I told you. Made me leave.”
Castiel didn’t give much thought about whether Dean would end up in Hell or Heaven. It would be awkward if he did go to Heaven after Castiel killed him.
Cas said simply, “the same man.”
Dean lied in bed that night, staring at the ceiling as he pondered his truth.
“Great.”
The hunt had been one hell of a close call.
Sam’s suspicions didn’t lessen from there. He was always trying to get information out of Castiel, asking him who sent him to earth, asking him about the other angels, asking him about Dean.
Dean handed him a wet plate. It almost slipped out of Castiel’s hands. “What am I supposed to do with this, Dean?”
“Okay,” Sam said. “That’s okay.”
“Ha,” Dean laughed. “Try twenty-seven, Jo.”
“Dean,” Castiel helped him up to his feet. “I’m sorry about that.”
“I do not have any feelings for Dean Winchester.” Castiel stood up. “Nor his brother. Same with Bobby Singer, I feel nothing for them.”
“You’re right,” Cas said.
“Want to repeat that, Sammy?” Dean asked.
Sam gave him a pitying look. “What, rejection? From who?”
“Uh, why don’t you want to kill Dean?”
“Witches?” Bec’s voice shook. “Who the hell are you!?”
Dean blushed. “You really don’t have to.”
“What did she just say?” Sam said, “don’t start your childish crap, Dean.”
“Oh shit.” for a brief moment, Dean looked horrified. “Uh, I hope angel nicknames aren’t offensive.”
“You know he’s right there, right? You could just ask him,” Dean said.
That must not have been what Uriel was expecting. “What do you mean?”
“I was always religious,” Cas said. “But, I fell from that.”
“Do you really think a witch’s best defense is a nail filer?” Cas asked.
Castiel couldn’t stop himself. He asked, “will any harm come to Dean Winchester?”
Cas kissed him again. Then he kissed him a few times after that. Dean never got used to the way it made his lips tingle after Cas pulled away, or the way his stomach answered each kiss by doing somersaults.
“What?” Dean snapped his gaze towards Cas.
That didn’t help Cas feel any better, as Dean had hoped. “I’m sorry this is happening, Dean; if there was any way I could stop it, I would.”
he tried to say, but instead he blurted out what had been on his mind, “I’m sure you know a lot about faith in your less youthful days.”
“Like what?”
“Perhaps,” Cas agreed.
Dean knew he would end up answering that honestly, so he kept his mouth shut.
Castiel could sense the brothers. Their energy was a lot stronger than other humans Castiel had sensed. He followed that energy, which led him into the midst of overgrown woods, where the shorter brother swung a machete at a feeble man. Blood splattered on Winchester’s face as the man’s body fell to the ground, headless.
“Dude, are you nuts?” Sam asked. “You think this guy has any experience with this kind of stuff?”
He had a few options. He could walk up to them, ask who Dean Winchester was, and then kill him there. But other families surrounded the brothers and they might take notice. He could wait until they were finished eating and then follow them home.
Castiel’s stomach leaped again.
Dean’s face flushed, and he looked down at the table. “Uh, he’s not a stranger. He’s Cas.”
It was the truth.
Jo smiled. “Relax man, I was kidding. But maybe your boxers are all twisted up for a different reason.”
Castiel expected questions about heaven at some point. He just didn’t know how to answer. Heaven was not what most humans had expected or hoped for. What was he supposed to tell him?
Dean grabbed a small stack of paper, quickly scanning through it. “Nah man, this is just shit like tax returns.”
“Uh, can I help you?” the shorter one asked with his mouth full.
“What did he learn?”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “I will not be insulted by an old man who lives in a junkyard.”
The two left the bunker and headed for the Church. Once they got there, Sam insisted Dean stayed in the car.
“Dude, I see that look on your face, and if you’re about to tell me you think my brother is hot, I’m going to dig a grave and bury myself alive,” Sam whined.
Castiel did not allow himself to take notice in Dean’s shampoo. Or his hair, that looked recently combed. He didn’t think about it. He did not.
These are those moments when Dean lets himself ponder on the thought. Maybe
“Backs fine,” he said.
This was not going to be as easy as Castiel first presumed. He did the next best thing. He left without another word, leaving the brothers alone in that restaurant, completely dumbfounded.
The bar wasn’t as full as it was the previous night. Which made Dean’s job easier. He asked around. Everyone told him they haven’t seen her. Sam asked around and got more successful answers thanks to his puppy eyes.
Castiel didn’t know what to do with that.
Cas’s attention was drawn to Dean. He was taken aback.
Dean leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to his neck. “Cas, you’ve been driving me crazy for weeks.”
Dean was happy every morning when he woke up and Castiel was still there.
Sam sighed, “nothing.”
Cas offered, “We could go back to Bec’s.”
“Uh, wow, this is harder to talk about than I thought.”
“I know you’d prefer to pretend you’re fine, but I know you better than that.”
Jo nodded sympathetically. “Been there.”
“Nah man, not interested,” Dean said. It was the truth. Shit. Well, too late now. “Like I said before, not really in the mood.”
Sam unlocked the hotel room door, swung it open, then immediately closed it again.
“Holy shit, is that your
The brothers walked out of the bar and back to the Impala.
Bobby came back with two beer bottles and handed one to Dean, and then he plopped down beside him, stretching his legs out. “I almost fell in the kitchen.”
“I love it when our job is easy,” Dean said.
“It won’t be difficult,” Cas said.
Castiel didn’t know if he was being complimented or insulted, so he kept himself from responding. Dean’s face was flushed now, and he drank the last of his beer. “Man, I’mma need another.”
“Wonderful, wonderful.”
“Right, that’s cool. Uh, I should probably change then. This isn’t Church worthy shit, is it?” he looked down at his stained T-shirt.
“What are you supposed to do when you learn something that you refused to believe in your whole life is real?”
The bartender shrugged. “Most people here are regulars. So maybe come by tonight. You might find her again.”
“What was that?” Dean asked.
The ride to the roadhouse was far from quiet. Bobby kept fussing about Sam’s poor driving skills, and Dean was begging Sam to put on Led Zeppelin.
“Uh, my phone?”
“Dude, are you going to pretend that girl isn’t checking you out?” Sam asked.
“I don’t care what he is,” Dean said. “Let’s just kill him.”
“Well, that’s a load of crap.”
“Best not,” Dean said.
Dean tried to regain his courage. He came here to talk to Sam. Honestly. He made it this far. No use talking himself out of it now.
“We don’t,” Dean said, because shit, he’s still under her truth spell.
“Whatever you think is best,” Cas said.
“Wait!” Cas blurted.
“So Dean. How’s your head?” he asked casually.
“Son of a bitch.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “You dry it, dumbass.”
“Sam informed me that Dean finds me arousing,” Castiel replied stiffly. His stomach swooped again as he said the words out loud.
Angels did not give out suggestions. Everyone knew this. When an angel tells you something, it is an order. A demand. Not a suggestion. It’s not something you could look at and go
“Would have paid to see that,” Dean said.
“Not so cool. You mean you guys keep us in magic rooms?”
He wouldn’t lie. She was pretty. Blonde, short, tight tank top. Definitely Dean’s type. And yeah, she was definitely looking at him. It’d be easy to woo her with a drink and his classic, charming smile. He just wasn’t in the mood today.
It was as simple as that, the world didn’t end, Dean didn’t cry, John didn’t crawl out of his grave to take a swing at him with an ax.
Jo then turned to Castiel and stared at him like she was studying him. “And who are you?”
Cas stretched out and placed his hand on his forehead. Even after Cas pulled his hand away, Dean’s skin tingled.
“We broke in.”
“Anyway uh, his mom told dad about it, because she was a bitch. Told dad he had to be careful because I was getting close to her son, and she thought he’d give me his disease or some bullshit like that.”
“Do you think so?” Sam asked.
“He made me realize the others were wrong.”
Dean swiftly unlocked the door and carefully stepped inside. The house was so dark he almost ran into a wall.
am I right?”
“You’re supposed to close your eyes,” Sam whispered.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said.
Jo looked between the two and grinned. “Wow, he’s cute. I’m guessing he has
Sam rolled his eyes. “Trust me, I won’t.”
“Man, that’s so gross.”
“But first, you know I love you too right?” Cas asked, his voice painfully gentle and painfully sincer, and holyshit-
switched the light on. The room was messier than the rest of the house. Unorganized stacks of papers on the desk, on top of a coffee table, and shoved in the corner of the room.
“Uh, thanks man.”
“How’d he get that information?”
“Yes,” Dean said sourly.
kill Dean Winchester. But he had no experience with human conversation. He’d fail his first mission, and then Zachariah won’t give him another one.
As soon as they walked into the roadhouse, Jo leaped off her stool and ran towards Dean, pulling him down in a hug.
“Alright. We’ll check the bar tonight. Do you think we should call Rowena?”
The woman’s smile didn’t falter. “It’s okay dear, he’s right. I am getting pretty old but it is no bother because I know I am closer to Heaven,” she said.
This Winchester was short, unhealthy, and had a rude attitude. Castiel hoped this one was Sam.
Cas looked down at his shoes.
Bobby flushed red. That’s when Castiel noticed the Impala’s back door was wide open, and sitting in the back seat was Ellen.
“Hey, Sammy, do we still have some pie left?” Dean asked, his words slurring. “Could use some pie.”
“Give me your phone,” she said.
Castiel frowned. Lying was wrong, he knew that. It’s one of the many things that heaven taught him. He must not lie to other angels, nor withhold any information. Except, wasn’t that what he was doing right now? He hadn’t told Heaven he was staying with Dean, helping him with hunts instead of killing him.
“I’m Dean Winchester, and I hunt plenty sons of bitches like you,'' he said. “Now, I’ve got a couple of witch-killing bullets in my car and I got an angel on my side. So you can drop the innocent faithful girl crap, okay?”
“What girl?” Dean looked behind him.
They returned to Bec’s.
“Uh, something like that,” Dean mumbled. When Cas came to mind, his skin tingled.
“That’s a relief. Uh, does heaven know?”
Bobby shrugged. “Well, I guess we’re keeping him, then. Guess you always had an angel on your Christmas list, huh?”
The brothers stared at him blankly. They were struggling to understand. Perhaps Castiel should explain better. Though he couldn’t comprehend what was so confusing about his statement.
That didn’t make the situation any better.
“Uriel.” Castiel refused to let his guard down.
Cas took a step closer to him. Dean could smell his strange, but nice, grassy signature scent because he was so close.
“Okay, great,” Sam said, nodding. “Now you should definitely go.”
“Thank you,” Sam said.
“Hey, it’s okay.”
“I didn’t know,” Sam protested, his face somehow turning redder.
Cas ran into the living room. “Dean, Dean!”
“You have now,” Castiel said.
Cas frowned. “Do you not want me to kiss you?”
“Why?”
“Are you okay?”
Sam explained, “He has a headache.”
“I think uh, well, don’t tell any of this to Dean, okay. He’d be livid. Just, keep this to yourself. I mean it.”
Zachariah fell limp to the side.
It took Dean a long time for him to accept that he had feelings for Cas. Just the thought of admitting them out loud to anyone, especially to Cas, made his stomach turn painfully.
“Yes I did.”
“That’s awful,” Sam said. “I’m so sorry.”
Jo smirked. “Oh man Dean-o,” she grabbed Dean’s arms. “I want you to tell me
“Dean?”
“Well, they’re sometimes the replica of someone’s happiest memory. Or, it’s what that someone has always dreamed of.”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said roughly.
So, he kissed Cas back, and it felt even better. Cas took this as a sign of encouragement, and he pressed harder, and Dean was probably going to pass out any minute.
“Are we going to break into her house?” Cas asked.
Ellen came out from around the counter, her hands on her hips. “What the hell have you done now, boys?” she asked with a head tilt in Castiel’s direction.
“Okay,” Sam said. “Well, that’s some deep shit, but okay.”
“I’m gonna need to get ear plugs,” Bobby said.
Bec smiled softly. “He seems dear to you.”
The girl screamed.
“I am going to complete my mission.”
“Wow. You’re old. Alright. Spill. What’s wrong?”
Dean grinned. “Well, now I’m tempted.”
“We’ve got an idea who she might be,” Sam said.
“I can’t lie, Sam.”
“But why are you here?”
“What does heaven want with us?”
Sam frowned. “I’m not sure if she’s a witch, Dean. Many people like her.”
“I’m a brother to you?” Cas asked calmly.
Sam gave her his phone, and she added her number. “If you have any questions, I’m just a text away. Or a call, if you prefer.”
Uriel took a few steps towards him, his smirk wider now. “Well. I’m assuming you’re failing, because you were always meant to fail this mission.”
“I know,” Castiel said.
“Let’s hurry up,” Bobby grumbled. He opened the car door and got inside, muttering insults under his breath.
Uriel had told him humans were difficult. They were given answers, then they didn’t know what to do with them. Castiel had thought he was exaggerating, because of course humans could simply understand the concept of angels. But it turns out Uriel was right. Humans were more difficult than Heaven let on.
“You’re really going through all this trouble, instead of just admitting the truth?” Sam asked.
Okay, Cas wasn’t homophobic, which was a relief. But he also just spoke out against homophobia in front of a Christian. Dean worried it might not go well.
Dean kept his eyes shut and pulled the covers over his head. He only had three drinks last night, yet somehow he ended up with a hangover from hell.
“Uh, what?”
Castiel shook his head.
“Sam?”
Dean barged into Sam’s room, only to realize a little too late what had happened the previous time he went into his brother’s room unannounced.
Dean’s voice thickened. “I stopped hanging out with Matt, closed myself off man. I tried so hard, so hard dude, but. I just. I couldn’t hide from myself as easily as I could from dad.”
Rowena looked at Dean and smiled playfully. “Aren’t you grateful, too, Dean?”
“I understand you don’t wish to say,” Bec said. “Did you feel wronged, because the others judged you for loving another man?”
“Of course I have doubts!” Dean yelled impatiently. Wait shit, no. Dean hated this damn truth spell.
Cas shook his head. “Nothing.”
“You’re lying.”
“Hmm.” Jo nodded. “Sounds like you are having more issues believing in something.”
“Oh no, she’s definitely looking at you,” Sam said. “So do I need to get a separate room or?”
Castiel found Sam outside. He was sitting on top of a rusting car, as he looked up at the sky with a wistful expression. When he noticed him standing there, he jumped.
Then he was gone.
“Hey, if you two are going to have a lovers quarrel, could you please have the angry sex out the car?” Sam said.
“But to us, they are just doors.”
Dean’s face grew hot. He said nothing, avoiding answering the question.
“Hello Dean.”
Dean’s heart clenched.
“Dean, maybe he is an angel.” Sam said.
Zachariah ignored him. “Castiel, it has been weeks.”
Dean didn’t answer. He opened the car door and slid inside. Sam eventually gave up and got in the car as well, starting the engine and pulling out of the driveway.
Sam laughed awkwardly. “Wow, okay, don’t ever say that to me ever again. Shit.”
“I guess I just always felt bad for my brother,” Sam said. “I always hoped there was more for him, and I realized I was hoping for me, too.”
“Oh, well, a witch tends to know when one breaks her own spell, now doesn’t she?”
“Wow, you suck,” Dean said.
Sam, however, was growing more skeptical the longer he stayed.
Cas then exited Dean’s room, which Dean appreciated. He still didn’t like Cas sitting there all night, watching him sleep.
Castiel frowned.
Now he knew exactly who his target was. He would wait until Dean was alone. Then he’d kill him.
Dean closed the door and
“Okay. Good. Great actually, really glad about that.” Sam said genuinely. “Can I ask why?”
“The hell would that be?”
“No way me too! A couple of weeks ago this girl came in that I thought was pretty cute, and Dean went up to her and said, ‘my friend thinks you’re cute.’ I wanted to shove my dagger down his throat,” Jo said. “Well, I mean I didn’t cry about it-”
Castiel fought back a smile. “Perhaps.”
“Dean!” Castiel shouted.
“Damn vamps,” he grumbled.
“D-Dean, please,” Castiel didn’t know what he wanted, he just wanted it
“Don’t want to talk to him.” Dean struggled to push himself off the wall. “While I’m like this.”
Uriel appeared on top of the twin bed and grinned. “Hello, Castiel.”
Dean, of course, was well aware of his own truth. He just didn’t think that was anything he could ever admit.
He knew he could charm this woman out of her pants if he wanted to. But when he imagined being in bed with her, the fantasy fell flat.
Perhaps telling Dean he was sent to kill him would be a bad idea. Dean is clearly an excellent hunter, and so is his brother. They might have never encountered an angel until recently, but they will eventually stumble across some accurate information on angel sigils.
Cas said nothing. Dean took that as a sign to continue.
Castiel had a choice. Dean Winchester and his friends, or Zachariah and the angels. It was hardly a choice at all. He pulled out his angel blade.
Sam’s face flushed red. “Shut up.”
Castiel shouldn’t be spying. But now he was curious. He hadn’t realized there were other people in Dean’s life besides his brother. Now he wanted to know more about Jo and who she was to Dean.
Rowena shook her head. “There isn’t exactly a cure. The spell does what it is intended to do. Make you tell your truth.”
Sam and Dean went on a few more hunts, and one of those hunts, Dean suggested taking Castil with them.
“Then who?” he asked. “Who?”
“Dean?”
“I won’t be able to. I’ll go with you.”
Bobby got up. He wobbled a little. “Right then, I’ll go get us another drink.”
“How did he do that?”
“To Bec’s,” he said.
“Mm, can’t be that bad right, it’s paradise.”
“Well, I guess that worked out well for you.” Dean said.
He woke up an hour later and he still felt like his head was being ripped open. Fuck. That bar must use some pretty strong stuff.
“How are you feeling?”
“Weather does not affect me as it does you,” he said.
“What are you talking about?” Sam asked. “Cursed?”
Cas was waiting for them by the car. “So, what are we thinking, witch? not a witch?”
“Could we not start this again?” Bobby asked. “At least wait until I finished my dessert.”
“So you are not the second cousins of this vampire couple?”
“Okay.”
Cas expressed his concern for Dean, saying, “I always worry about you.” Dean’s stomach leaped hearing Cas speak so sincerely.
“Kiss it better,” Bobby said.
“Really, I’m fine,” Sam insisted.
Dean snickered, “nah man, we’re breaking in.” He grabbed his wallet, pulling out his credit card.
They reached Bec’s place and got out of the car.
“Damn, that’s a load of shit,” Dean said.
“Well, she was definitely Sam’s type. He’s the one who noticed her.” Dean said. “Hey by the way, Sammy, who was that redhead you were talking with, by the way?”
“That’s not fair, I’m not even riding shotgun.” Dean said with a pout. To Castiel, he added, “back me up, Cas.”
“Oh sure, the day I found out vampires hopped out of Twilight, I was pretty shook. Same with witches, and magic in general. But this?”
Bobby smiled grimly. “Alright then, we’ll drink to that I guess.”
Dean pushed himself backwards a little too hard and he stumbled, landing on the floor awkwardly. “Sam, I think my legs stopped working.”
As charming as it was to watch the three of them bickering, and it was charming, Castiel had a mission to complete, and he wasn’t completing it like this.
Dean needed a few moments to catch his breath. “Uh, right. Still feels like shit.”
Dean hoped Cas could mojo away any fingerprints.
“Yes?”
Dean stood up. “It might get heat damage.”
“Don’t tell Sam.”
“Well, it looks weird.” The shorter brother took a large bite out of his burger. “You ain’t going to be picking up chicks looking like that.”
Dean snickered, “ah man, you freaky bastard.”
Cas’ shoulders had sagged. “Oh.”
“You look even cuter from behind.”
“Alright, so you’ve got some questions,” Bec explained. “I am here to answer.”
“I love Taylor Swift.”
“So get this, her name is Bec Rodrigo and she actually hosts a lot of charity events and attends the Church,” Sam said.
“Do not be afraid,” Uriel said. “I understand.”
Bobby snapped, “take the angel, leave the angel. I don’t give a damn. Just please stop fighting in my kitchen.”
“Thanks. Hopefully they work.”
“Uh, maybe? Should I call him?”
Dean actually woke up early the next morning, and the three sat down together as they drank their coffee.
Sam walked into the room. “Dean! Bobby says he’s found some lore on- oh.” he stopped. “There is an angel in the living room. Right. Okay.”
“He is.”
He needed to get Dean away from Jo and Sam.
sorry.”
“How do I tell Zachariah I failed?”
Uriel shook his head. “I would not spoil it for you, brother. But I think you know.”
“But it’s fake.”
“You’re sure you didn’t find anything?” Dean asked.
Why did Cas have to say shit like that?
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Dean said.
“What? Oh, no no! I wasn’t laughing about that,” Sam said, noticing Castiel’s crestfallen look. “Sorry, I wasn’t laughing at you.”
“You okay now?” Cas asked.
“I didn’t get to check this room,” Cas said.
Dean hurried out the roadhouse, and Castiel followed him. He only noticed both Bobby and Ellen weren’t anywhere to be seen as they headed out.
“Oh, I think you know,” Dean took a step closer.
Dean winced, and pulled back from Castiel, his face red. “I wasn’t-!”
It was getting harder to lie.
Did he have to keep asking him that? Dean tried to tell him he was fine. Instead what he said was, “no.”
“Dean,” Cas said warningly.
“Oh, okay.”
The two exited the living room and proceeded down the hall, where they found Cas standing uncomfortably near a shattered window, shards of glass strewn across the floor.
“But why?”
“What is it about this person who made you fall?”
“You lost me.”
“Taller,” Bobby said.
“It’s called lying, man,” Dean said.
Castiel wondered what gave her that impression. He wasn’t here to eat; he was here for the Winchesters. He hadn’t said before that he was going to order.
“I don’t know, maybe. She hasn’t been much help lately, though.”
“No Dean, he’s right,” Sam said. “Why is he here?”
like that?”
“What?” Dean stammered. It appears he still could not muster up a coherent thought. “Heaven? What-”
“How did you get into my house?”
“Morning dude,” Sam said. “Or, afternoon. You got to stop sleeping in, man.”
Dean blushed. “Shut up.”
The short brother rolled his eyes. “Do you hear that? He’s weatherproof.”
Dean looked at Castiel. He understood. He closed his eyes, focusing. Soon, the woman’s screams abruptly stopped.
Dean elbowed Sam and muttered, “Imagine there’s a bunch of dead birds inside. Is that the kind of freaky stuff you like?”
She asked, “What was that?”
When Dean and Sam entered, Dean wondered what the word “mess” meant to this woman. Everything was pristine, including the floors, walls, and ceilings.
Of course, Dean still wouldn’t believe he was an angel. He shook his head. “Nah, man, you can’t fly. That’s the most childish thing I’ve ever heard.”
They just simply couldn’t.
“Would you take this seriously for one moment?” Dean said. “Who knows what crazy ass side effects this curse has!”
“Oh my god.”
She nodded at Sam. “And his brother.”
“Yeah, I can drive, no problem,” Sam said.
“Then I’m guessing not a witch,” Sam said. “But. we could bring Rowena next time.”
Cas didn’t seem bothered by this question. “God does not view homosexuality as a sin. That is simply something humans believe, because they refuse to accept those who differ from them.”
“She’s over there.” Sam pointed at a group of women. “She hasn’t stopped looking over since we got here.”
Castiel saw no reason to return to heaven. So, he stayed with the Winchesters.
Cas nodded and jumped out of the broken window. An unusual choice, but who was Dean to judge?
“How the hell can you do that?”
“Hello Dean.”
“She could be faking it,” Dean said. “Like everyone else.”
Then the preacher told them to pray, and Sam nudged Dean.
The ride to Bec’s house was mostly peaceful. Cas kept asking questions. Such as whether they had any other leads or whether Dean’s curse had any other negative effects.
Castiel has never shown a human his wings before. It was an act of vulnerability. Trust. But he had no other choice. Dean wouldn’t believe him any other way. Not that Castiel needs him to. It just might help Dean understand that there’s a greater good, and he is a part of it.
Cas. Right, Cas. Dean couldn’t lie for shit and Sam wanted to call Cas. Everything about this was a bad idea.
Sam, on the other hand, was prepared for this. “What made you come to faith?”
“Okay. Uh, yeah.”
“Oh! It’s you from the bar.”
Sam repressed a scoff. “Really? That’s nice. And the curse?”
“I’m sorry I never told you man, and I’m sorry it took a stupid curse to get it out of me. But that’s it. That’s my big truth or whatever. I love you. There. Oh man, my head’s feeling better already.”
“Why did you curse me, Bec?”
“Great, Truth Spell, so, how do we cure it?” Dean asked.
Sam and Bobby had informed him Dean was interested in him sexually. That’s something he could use.
Right, questions. Their whole cover. Dean attempted to come up with a suitable question to ask her, but he couldn’t think of anything.
“Jesus Christ,” Sam sighed.
Uriel said, “don’t really know, I heard he had an old fling with a witch, that probably has something to do with it, don’t really care either.”
“God speaks through us in many ways,” Bec said. “We are his story,” and isn’t that a little too close to the truth? “Sometimes he sends us signs, and somewhere deep inside us we know. We just have to listen.”
“You’ll feel better in a bit,” Sam said. “try to get some sleep.”
He couldn’t take it anymore. He pulled the car over.
There was nothing stopping him.
Sam came back with medicine and water. Dean took the medicine and chugged down the water.
Dean smiled, “oops, guess you can’t.”
Dean said, “hey, Cas?”
“Still, when I was eleven, I was the one making boys cry.”
Luckily, Sam saved their asses. “We’re just curious. Growing up, we weren’t really introduced to religion.”
“Gee Cas, I know,” Dean said. Unfortunately for Dean, even his private thoughts were true, and he was forced to think about Cas’ charming head tilt against his will.
“Is it the truth?”
“Zachariah heard it whispered in the sky and figured he had to prevent it.”
Dean’s energy had led him in a cluttered room with old books, a tattered couch, and the reek of alcohol.
“Why would I say-”
Uriel glared into Castiel’s eyes, like he was searching for something hidden. “You cannot kill Dean, correct?”
Bobby snorted on his sundae.
Rowena continued, “tell the new couple that I am happy for them. I must go now. There is a pretty, very naked lady waiting for me in my bedroom. Good day to you.” With that, she hung up.
“If you want to walk around with a stick up your ass, that’s fine. But am I really the only one who thinks all of this is weird?”
“I was not,” Dean said.
He wished he had the courage to tell him. Every time Cas would stare at him as if he were the only person in the world or every time Cas would sacrifice his life for him, thinking he wasn’t needed, those words threatened to pour out. He thought of John Winchester every time. His father silenced his truth. His father always made him feel as if his feelings weren’t valid. That they shouldn’t affect him.
Dean grabbed him, shoving him against the Impala, effectively jolting Castiel out of his thoughts.
The shorter one said, “oh where do I even begin?”
Castiel ended up staying with the Winchesters for the rest of the evening. Dean forced him to help him with the dishes while he talked about Bobby.
Dean’s stomach jumped, and he had to remind himself that Cas didn’t mean it like that. Cas loves Dean, he knew that, just not in the way that Dean loved him.
Castiel considered reporting back to heaven and requesting Uriel’s insistence. Then he remembered what Zachariah had said and figured this would be a failure. He’d have to kill the man without the help of another angel.
“Really?”
One woman greeted them with a big smile. “It’s so nice to see such young people ready to turn to Christ,” she said to Sam. To Dean, she said, “you can find your faith at any age.”
“Please, Castiel. You were always heaven’s tool, but I didn’t think it was this bad.” Uriel pinched his forehead. A human gesture of frustration. “Look, it is not heaven’s way. It is simply Zachariah’s way. He learned of the upcoming future.”
“You could say that.”
Bec nodded sympathetically. “I was like that too, there’s nothing wrong with that of course, not being religious. But I always wondered if there was more to life than just living, paying your taxes, and then dying.”
Fortunately, Cas didn’t ask Dean what he was to him. “Thank you very much, Dean.”
Bec nodded, looking dazed. “Right. Okay, come again anytime you like. Uh, just text me.”
“Man,” Dean laughed dryly. “I hate witches.”
anyone, but he was here
Shit. Why did everyone feel the need to ask him if he’s okay?
“Where were you?”
“Dude!” Dean immediately switched it back off.
Sam scoffed. “You should probably wash your mouth out with soap too, while you’re at it.”
Dean said, “Nah, we’re going to hold hands and chat about God.”
A woman was standing beside him. “Are you going to order anything?”
Dean flipped him off.
Castiel should have killed Dean by now. He should have killed him days ago. Every time he considered it, or came close, he felt an uncomfortable tug in his gut that made him stop every time.
Dean kicked off the covers and sat up.
Dean paused for a moment, then continued. “He told me Matt’s mother told him, and that I should stay away from him. I messed up, I asked him why, and he looked me in the eye and he said-” his voice trailed off.
“Well I hope you find your path, faith or no faith,” Bec said before she found a place to sit.
Castiel’s throat dried up. “Dean.”
Why God made such pathetic creatures, Castiel would never understand.
“Wow, he sure as hell was one idjit.”
“Uriel,” Castiel said.
“Just having a midlife crisis.”
Dean scoffed, “wow, thanks mom.”
“When someone questions their faith, there is always a reason. What hole in your heart, Dean, do you believe needs to be filled?” Bec asked, turning to Dean.
Dean explained Cas was a friend who was also interested in faith. Cas wasn’t happy about it, but Bec wasn’t bothered and invited the three boys inside.
Dean lied back down and said, “Oh, don’t eat all the bacon.”
Castiel’s gut did that tug thing again.
Castiel found the Winchester brothers in a cheap restaurant. One of the brothers was extremely tall, and the other was short. The short one was also devouring a mountain of fries and a double cheeseburger. If this was Dean Winchester, he’d be dead before Castiel had the chance to kill him.
“Drink
Dean said, “don’t give me that look. It’s funny.”
Rowena winked at him. “I’ll try to pull a few strings.”
“Is this necessary?” he asked.
It was just another devastated soul he’d have to worry about after Dean’s death, is all.
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know. Just learned something recently. Don’t know what to feel about it, I guess.”
“Might have some, er, missed calls?” Dean’s voice squeaked.
Dean was not better in a bit.
Rowena hummed, “perhaps. But, how do you suppose you’ll find her?”
“Others?” Bec asked.
“Sorry,” Castiel apologized, not sure what he was apologizing for. He then processed this information, that Dean found him attractive, and a suitable partner (at least for sex, anyway), and something tugged at his gut again.
“Well, of course. A happy memory is just a memory. Dreams fade when we wake up.”
Perhaps he already was.
“It’s not a problem in the least. Is there anything I can bring you, like water or tea? We have coffee.”
Sam didn’t get a chance to say anything because the sound of shattered glass resonated throughout the home, startling Bec.
“Rowena,” Sam answered the phone. “Hello?”
“Well, if you wanted to kill him, you would have by now,” Sam said. Then, he frowned. “Uh, right?”
he tried to say. “He means you could be practicing magic elsewhere, which would explain the lack of evidence we’re finding here.”
Sam said, “okay, then what are you?”
Sam answered much more politely, “We’re fine. Thanks, I appreciate it.”
Rowena said, “I kind of like him like this. Do we really need to fix him?”
“Don’t shoot him,” Dean said quickly. “This is Cas. he sort of stalks me.”
“We can test this, fair and square.”
“Let’s think this through,” Zachariah said. “You fall in love, one way or another it’s not going to end well. So, might as well just kill the source of your problems and move on.”
“I’m just tired. Hunt wore me out.” Dean said. He drank the last of his beer and then slammed the glass down on the table. “I’m going to get another drink.”
“I love you,” Dean said.
Dean was smiling now. It was an awkward kind of smile. “Uh, that’s gone too.”
Castiel didn’t know how to respond to that, because Dean’s hand was pulling at the hem of his shirt, and everything else felt so distant.
“Oh, that’s not enough, I’m afraid. All magic has a goal. No one curses someone just to watch them spill out truths left and right. It works through all your smaller truths until it gets to your
Castiel looked away. He didn’t see when the brothers jumped on the bed and killed the two vampires. He didn’t hear their screams, either.
age.”
He didn’t get used to the way Dean pushed him against any surface to kiss him. Sam said that was gross, too.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t curse you. Honest.”
“This guy is creepy as hell. And you want to buy him dinner?”
The shorter one stared at Castiel defensively. “Okay, creeper, why are you asking?”
“Well that went well,” Dean grumbled.
Then the other brother’s gaze found Castiel’s.
Castiel had asked himself the same question on many occasions. When he thought he found the right answer, it felt almost like an excuse a few moments later. He didn’t know why he felt so fondly of him. Or what exactly that fondness meant. He just knew he didn’t want to kill him.
“All right, we’ve got larger problems,” Sam said, interrupting them. “Bec thinks someone broke her house into or something, so you need to go right now.”
The door swung open. Of course it had to be Cas.
“Dean, I don’t think so.”
“I sort of remember. What about him?”
Sam came in a few minutes later. “Doing any better?”
Sam called Rowena the next day. “Got anything on the curse? Oh, Okay. Right. Well, let me know if that changes. Okay.” Sam hung up.
“She fits the role,” Sam said.
“Anything,” he replied.
“We’re sorry,” Cas said.
Sam bit his lip. Castiel recognized it as a nervous gesture. “Yeah, okay. Uh, you won’t kill him, right?”
“Heaven has sent me,” Castiel repeated slowly. “To you.”
“You lack faith,” Castiel said. “I do not see what you find so hard to believe. You just kill a vampire.”
“I’m going to get a drink,” Dean said, pushing past his brother and heading towards the counter. He pretended he didn’t hear his brother’s laughter behind him.
Castiel nodded tightly. “You have my word,” he told Sam sincerely.
. The big truth, you could say.”
“Oh uh, my brother does well talking in person,” Sam said, catching on. “Is there anywhere we can meet up?”
Dean took a deep breath. “God, I’m so tired of this.”
He could leave right then. No one would have to know he left, or if he would be coming back. Eventually a new angel would come and finish his job for him.
“What’s this, exactly?”
“We actually have to stay, don’t we?” Dean asked.
“I’ve faced much nastier witches than you.”
“Good. I ain’t ever seen no one else that boy has been head over heels for.” Bobby slapped Castiel’s back. “Good luck.” he pushed Castiel forward.
“Good.”
“Holy crap, if you say this is some sort of great destiny thing, you can take your little prophecy and shove it up your ass,” Dean said.
Crowley could see the bastard who’d delivered the fatal blow running away, and he became infused with a determination to kill him. He picked up Balthazar’s angel blade and set off in hot pursuit, a righteous anger boiling up inside him. Rounding a corner, he spotted the fucker up ahead, and he sped up and launched himself at his quarry, yelling furiously.
Setting off again, Dean continued searching through the seemingly endless hallways, with the ‘angels’ accompanying him on his quest.
They stared at each other for a few moments as they realised what they’d done, before they both dissolved into fits of laughter.
“I asked him if he’d be okay with me showing him how to sign, and he indicated that he would,” she explained. “If it’s okay with you?” she then added.
Dean scrolled through to find his message, then handed it to Cas, who read that and Gabriel’s message multiple times before turning back to Dean. His eyes were watering, and so were Dean’s, if he was being honest.
Angel smiled shyly and pointed to himself, then signed ‘two’.
Angel was still there - thank god - and looked to be taking in his surroundings. The ergonomically designed swivel chair in front of the large curved edged window, the glass coffee table next to the sofa, the low dining table surrounded by floor cushions, a chrome lamp and a collection of chrome sculptures. Plus there was Colonel ‘sleeping’ on his bed in one corner, and his guitar in the other. It was all neat and tidy, and the red of the sofa stood out against the almost completely bare white walls - except for his screen and a picture - and white tiled floor.
As he carried Angel through the doors and over to the elevator, Dean hoped to god they didn’t encounter any of his neighbours. How the hell would he explain
"Shit, I'm sorry man." Dean raised his hands in a gesture of apology, and backed away a little. "I wouldn't ever hurt you; I hope you know that. But why would you trust me? You don't even know me."
“Fuck me!” he exclaimed, shaking his arms and trying to get some feeling back into them. “Buddy, am I glad you don’t weigh anymore.”
Thankfully the elevator had reached the ground floor, and Dean no longer had to think of any excuses for his late night trip to the store. With a “Goodbye. See you around,” he rushed to the car and set off with a squeal of tires.
When Jo and Hannah came into the room a moment later, holding hands, Dean pulled out of the embrace and took hold of Cas’s hand too.
"Nice one," Dean said with a smile. “Okay, first you need to shave that scruff.”
“I’m not going anywhere near its eyes, Bobby. Have you seen those fangs?” Dean huffed.
When the burgers and fried potatoes were ready, Dean shared them between two plates, added some salad leaves and half a tomato each, and brought them through to the living room.
If Dean didn’t already like the guy - he was funny, interesting, a great dad, as well as super hot - Cas’s positive reaction at seeing Dean’s beloved Chevy Impala ‘67 would have cemented it. Dean felt a sense of pride, plus a tiny bit of jealousy when Cas ran his hand lightly over the hood.
Angel turned back to him and smiled shyly, then his face lit up with delight as he spotted the PB and J that was waiting for him in the kitchen.
He just hoped they would all return in one piece.
Glaring at Dean, he said, “We know you have Castiel. We will not allow his rebellion to go unpunished; now he will atone. Through you."
Placing a hand on Dean’s arm, he asked, “Dean, some of the angels have requested to be present at this historic event.”
Angel nodded his head and returned his attention to his coffee, but he didn’t take any more sugar. As he took his first sip of the drink, Dean found himself mesmerised by his reaction. He closed his eyes and his lips turned up into a satisfied smile, as if it was the greatest thing he’d ever tasted.
Cas nodded appreciatively. “Sam told me you worked on her yourself. You must be very good with your hands.”
Finally, he spoke. "This is very troubling. I don't know what to think."
Mystery Man tried shrinking away from him, but judging from the way he winced with even the slightest movement, his injuries were obviously pretty bad.
Wearing a dopey expression, Jo declared, “I did it.”
“Oh, man, that’s a long fucking story, and I don’t think I should try telling it over the phone. Can you come here? He’d love to see you in person.” Dean looked at Cas for confirmation, and Cas nodded enthusiastically.
The female angel carried on, despite Dean’s interruptions. “And wishes to negotiate a surrender. We humbly implore you to come and negotiate the terms.”
“Dean Smith, Dean Winchester!” The MC practically screamed, as the noise from the crowd reached fever-pitch.
to have this conservatory built so it overlooked the Pacific Ocean, but today he felt too bitter to appreciate it.
Angel looked just as surprised by Eileen’s words as Dean was, and he looked between Dean and Eileen, obviously waiting to see what Dean’s reaction would be.
Finally, they passed the last set of spikes, one of them barely missing Dean’s side. “Whoever wrote this episode should die!” Dean grumbled, realizing too late that Castiel had definitely heard that.
they were supposed to be able to see a demon’s true face. Surely Crowley having a normal human face would be a dead giveaway.
Sam’s eyes widened, but he didn’t say anything; he took a bite out of the sandwich Eileen had prepared for him, and hummed appreciatively.
Dean had no idea if this was deliberate or not, but he found he kind of liked the delicious torture of being so close, and yet so far.
“Seriously?” he exclaimed, and Cas looked a little upset by Dean’s sudden outburst.
Angel looked at the shirts in wonder, as Benny explained the adaptations he’d made. Angel was able to slip them on, slot his wings into the holes on each side, then fasten the shirts below each wing with press studs. It was simple but effective, and Dean couldn’t thank Benny enough for the independence this gave Angel.
, Sam thought as he felt the slightest pang of jealousy. Dean got this reaction every single time, and Sam wondered what he would have to do to get the crowd to love him like that.
After an excruciating few seconds, Dean offered Eileen a coffee, saying, “Coffee? That’s an important word. You should teach us that.” He nodded emphatically, before darting off to the kitchen to pour coffee, and wonder what the fuck had been done to Angel that something as simple as writing could trigger him.
“I’ll protect you.” Cas wrapped Dean in his wings, and manoeuvred them to the roof’s edge.
“On what?” Dean asked.
“Eileen’s gonna be here in about fifteen minutes. We’re gonna have to eat quickly.” Dean sat down at the table, and Angel crossed the room to join him.
Dean leaned forward and whispered into Cas’s ear. “I might
"You can leave them on if you want," Dean suggested, “if you’d feel more comfortable.”
Angel wolfed the food down like he couldn’t remember the last time he ate, and Dean had to stop himself from leaving his own meal and just watching him, instead of sneaking occasional glances. He was also concerned that Angel would make himself sick if, as Dean suspected, he wasn’t used to eating regularly.
“I don’t want to put him in a position where he has to lie. It could make things awkward for his job.”
“Chuck kept him captive for nearly two years, until Cas found a way to escape, and that’s when I found him. He was hurt and scared, but I’ve been looking after him.” Dean glanced at Cas then, and as they gazed at each other, a charged moment passed between them. Cas didn’t speak a word, but his eyes conveyed everything he wanted to say… gratitude, fondness, and something that Dean interpreted as Cas having some seriously inappropriate thoughts, considering they had visitors. It was probably just as well that Gabriel spoke up, breaking them out of their staring match.
"I could take the stitches out now, if you want," Dean offered, getting a nod in reply.
The stunned silence that had fallen was suddenly broken by an ear-splitting scream from Ash.
Dean swallowed his mouthful and laughed, as Angel devoured his sandwich like he was a starving dog. “Good, huh?”
Dean also wanted to enquire about what the authorities would do to a person with extreme body modifications if they were apprehended. Would they surgically remove or alter them? The thought of this was enough to make him tread very carefully; forcibly removing those beautiful wings would be awful, quite apart from it meaning Angel would go through yet more trauma.
That actually summed up Sam’s feelings on the day’s proceedings pretty nicely.
“Dean… thank god.” He squeezed Dean’s hand, and attempted a smile.
Angel signed ‘yes’, and followed Dean into the kitchen. Dean washed his hands, then took the ground beef out of the fridge while Angel followed suit and washed his hands also.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean noticed Angel's attention drift to him, and his music. Dean liked the idea that Angel enjoyed listening to him play, and he smiled to himself.
Dean was not going to leave Crowley to go last; he was their leader, dammit, and he had to make sure everyone was safe before he left. “There's no time. Get in! Get in!”
Dean couldn’t believe this. He didn’t understand why they weren’t embracing this experience as much as he was. True, none of them had the same feelings as he did towards Castiel, but still… “Come on, guys,” he pleaded.
They finished eating, and Dean patted his belly in satisfaction. He then watched in astonishment when Angel jumped up and grabbed the dishes before Dean had the chance to.
He had just finished measuring out the flour, baking powder, superfine sugar, and salt, and was about to add the eggs when Eileen reappeared.
Placing the bowl between them, Dean put his hands into the mixture once more, and took enough to make one patty. “This is how you do it,” he said, flattening and shaping it, until it was perfect.
“The main garrison,” Castiel explained, as Dean wondered how many more of them would fall for one of the angels. Just as long as none of them set their sights on Castiel…
? Sam wondered, staring at the man as he echoed his own words.
“Be careful, Cas,” he said, as Castiel headed for the door. “And may the force be with you.”
Angel looked away to concentrate on his own food, and Dean breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn’t sure how much more of this he would be able to resist though, and being in such close proximity to each other all the time wasn’t helping matters.
As they wound their arms around each other, and their hands tangled in each other’s hair, Dean had a feeling that he had finally won something, and it was pretty significant.
Angel took his hand and climbed off the bed, allowing Dean to get a good look at him for the first time. He’d seen Angel’s chest and legs before - and those seriously impressive biceps - but this was the first time he’d gotten to see the full package. The sight was mouth-watering; Angel had filled out to a nice healthy size in the last few weeks, and he had muscles and curves in all the right places. He also had an alluring pair of hip bones, and speaking of size… last night that cock had filled Dean in the most satisfying way, but now he could see it in all its glory.
Dean was going to kill Chuck, first chance he got.
“There will be a puff of blue smoke,” Ed warned too late, as Dean and Castiel were engulfed in a cloud so thick, Dean couldn’t see a thing for a few seconds.
“Go, go, go!” Dean ordered, as one by one they stepped through; back to safety.
Eileen’s eyes widened in surprise, but she smiled and nodded at his request. “I would be happy to teach you too, Dean.”
They jumped on their hurt comrade, and the scene that unfolded was straight out of one of their gorier episodes, which was fucking disturbing, as the poor hurt creature was ripped apart and devoured in front of their eyes. As he watched the childlike beings transform into horrific killers, Dean realized what it reminded him of; they closely resembled the changelings that had been so creepily portrayed in an episode of
“Sure, they're cute now, but in a second, they're gonna get mean. They're gonna get ugly somehow, then there's gonna be a million more of them,” Ash said, cringing.
Saturday had arrived. Dean and Cas had been texting back and forth since Jack’s party; flirting outrageously, as well as sharing bee facts like ‘a queen bee can produce two thousand eggs a day’, or ‘after mating, male bees lose their reproductive organs, then die’.
For his part, Samandriel didn’t comment at all on what was unfolding, but his expression was growing ever more petrified.
chester, after all.
It proved to be a lot of fun anyway, and surely this time Dean would beat Sam. Except, wouldn’t you know it, Cas won… again.
“You hungry?” he asked as he placed the plates on the dining table, and Angel turned around, eyes widening at the sight of the food.
If Dean thought Cas was cold, that was nothing compared to Naomi’s frostiness. There had always been something about her demeanour that made him feel slightly uneasy, but the way she was glaring at him now sent chills down his spine. Maybe she was the violent criminal; Dean wouldn’t be surprised if that turned out to be the case.
Normally, Dean’s first instinct in a situation like this would be to call Sam and ask for help, but this situation was anything but normal. In fact, despite how close Dean and his brother were, ultimately, Sam’s job was to enforce the law. If he found out about the existence of Dean’s angelic guest, he might feel compelled to report them both. Nope, Dean would have to deal with this on his own.
“But, sir! If we go back to Heaven, we will be trapped.”
“The incantation and remaining ingredients are correct,” Samandriel started. “However, our attempts at executing spells when we don’t have everything required have not always achieved the desired outcome. But now that Beth is here, she can perform it. Her knowledge of spells is far superior to ours.”
“She came back,” Dean said, hoping that explanation would suffice. After all, people died and came back to life on the show all the time.
Dean thought with a chuckle, as he brought the sandwiches through to the living room, and they sat down to eat. As always, Angel ate hungrily, although Dean noticed that he did seem to be trying hard to slow down somewhat with his eating, and he smiled to himself as he started on his own food.
Now though... now he’d had enough of ignoring his feelings. Being in such close proximity to Dean while they went through the obstacle course had set his attraction to Dean aflame, and the sense of euphoria when the samulet had recharged the Hand of God had caused an immense stirring inside him. He gazed deeply into Dean’s eyes and moved into his personal space, and as the air around them became charged, Castiel knew what he had to do.
