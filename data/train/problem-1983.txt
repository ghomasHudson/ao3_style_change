Sherlock did not want to clean up anymore messes in his room,so he herded them towards the downstairs shower where he almost made it.
"So,with all of this mess and magic,this is just a suicide?" Greg asked.
"That is not your business to know about,or stick your nose in. Now the envelope said we have this room until noon. Go to your own room, or go to your own office if you are done with your work. Stay out of ours. We can have breakfast and drinks brought here so there is no chance of running into any gossipers of yours conveniently wandering about. Goodbye" Sherlock said with a wave before setting a cup under the coffee maker and pressed a button brew another.
"I'll be here until morning. Decide what you want,and I will respect it. You're welcome in here too, but no need to rush if that's really what you want. I don't want to be another bad decision made in a hurry"
John carried Sherlock until they were close to one of the small lights.
" We have made enough enemies with the last few cases at least" Sherlock said calmly with a wave. " The ones who did crimes were caught and are behind bars, but no criminal works as an island. Crimes do not stop just because some slip up and get caught .I just finished with THAT text when you woke up"
"We do?" John asked quietly. When they walked away, Sherlock bowed down and whispered to John.
Sherlock smiled, and put two sugars in the left bowl before John used the rest of the hot water to cover the oatmeal and leave the plates on top of the bowls.
"Yes,but often you are, and not quite this tired or slowed down when you do. I have a bus to catch to get to an early shift in a few hours,and you'll be busy with Rosie and whatever case might be brought to us today until I get back home." John said, cutting bacon and ham bits before moving his free hand along Sherlock's flank under the blanket.
Many guests had also been in the room it was currently placed in,but aside from children or the occasional criminal,not many payed the skull any mind.
'Invites and call ins only,walk in only customers will not be served unless orders and dine in times have already been called in and set'
Been trying to keep in mind syllable count, structure and all,but I'm sure I don't have it perfect,kept some bit of the prompt
He bent his knees and leaned his head over to kiss John
John put his bags by his dresser and changed as quickly as he could.
Sherlock walked ahead with his arms up while John walked beside the guard in a casual stance past several doors.
"Hmmm hmmm closer"
John said  before diving in with another kiss,still holding Sherlock in place with his hand and bent arm.
John set his cup on the table and sighed, waiting before marching over to Sherlock and leaning down.
He walked behind John as he was headed in the kitchen, trying not to think about how and why Sherlock knew some parts of the coffee maker pot were thinner than others,or how often he had ever made coffee directly over flames.br />
Mycroft left to ride to his office. John was amused that the other Holmes brother likely knew the extra time in the new,high class hotel was paid for with the card he had originally given to Sherlock.
Sherlock stopped the push ups,sat back on his heels and looked at Mycroft.
"I would like to get home now,get out of these clothes, and get to the bottom of another mystery, let's go ahead and step out.I've already paid for these". He nodded towards the cups,and smiled back at the bartender that had given him the to go cups and had topped them off herself.
Still didn't have much time at all to plan anything out, but yes, I can try working more of the last chapter,so let's see how this goes, and see what else I can add to finish this properly
"Duane was still saved by you. It took stopping a flight at an airport,but he is still alive and will grow with his mother and sisters because of your thinking!" John had raised his voice to point out.
The tea kettle went off and John walked towards the kitchen, looking back. "I'm making the tea the way we like it. I'll be there soon and we can start by seeing if you can obey orders"
Sherlock sat in his chair with a cup of tea,while John sat with his already on the side table after putting Rosie in her playpen.
" This almost looks like an abstract piece, like the gallery I took my wife to last week." Anderson said, through a clogged nose.
John closed his eyes and felt a calm type of sobriety go through him before getting out himself. He was reminded that Sherlock wasn't worried about losing anything and certainly not letting anything slip by with a kiss like that in front of a suspect's house on west main Street!
From there, he played with his tounge slowly moving upwards while keeping a palm over John's chest. He could keep track of his breathing, while keeping John's view limited.
John gave him his coffee, and he walked to the refrigerator and shook a few sugar cubes out of what was a reporposed cereal box before stirring them in and walking to John.
John scooted over towards Sherlock, then climbed over him and settled down. Nose buried in Sherlock's chest, mostly stretched out and his feet still did not touch the ground.
"Oh!" Amber said with a smile " I play and test different levels and styles of different games to catch any faults or hang ups. Then I turn in reports to different admins, and sometimes find ways to make money with the games".
She walked to the kitchen sink and threw them down the drain, turning the water on so they would go away.
"Thanks for that" John whispered,but then stared into the flames, letting them and the mundane of making coffee calm him. "Are we safe here if,as you said, someone is trying to drive us out?"
They got off the cab in front of the building where Mycroft's office was inside. Sherlock reached over where John was getting money out of his wallet, and slid a finger inside an inner fold, pulling out Mycroft's card he had given John.
After seeing her take two bites, Sherlock started in on his.
The cuffs and chains were taken off of him, but fortunately, the man in scrubs was able to take on more and more of Sherlock's weight until he carried him. Arm over his shoulder, he kept testing Sherlock until he was able to half carry, half guide a staggering
Oh yes,more people come into play and things are very much up. Only to be expected with our boys 😊
John went to the bathroom and cleaned his chest and everything off with a wet washcloth before bringing one for Sherlock to use.
This kept both Sherlock and John busy, with doctor work and endless investigations into many crimes. Sherlock was taking time relaxing in a quiet place in his mind palace before the MET called again.
"He might just think he's safe because he looks older, but there was the guy dressed as a wizard at the Lord of the Rings convention here a few months ago. Whoever she is, doesn't seem picky" said another guy with a dangling costume,a bulbous headpiece...odd
"Ohhh! Mmmmm" John seemed to hit a good spot on his right shoulder, but he knew giving an area too much attention can be just as bad as ignoring it. He moved to work on the lower back,which had oddly enough,started to tighten.
Her family, someone who used to be her captain....
After talking to Lestrade and signing reports,they got to go home the day after they had arrived at the hospital with John set up to keep monitoring Sherlock from home.
"Yes, let's make things go faster so the freak and his blogger can just go home. Maybe get married already and leave us to do our work" she grumbled.
John did not like what he saw,but he stayed silent and oiled up his hands.
Several of John's regiment had met Sherlock before on thier past cases,and a few that hadn't were checking him out.
"You have a ride waiting on you,right to 221B. I'll let you ugly yourself to the eyes closest to you, and maybe me as well pretty".
Nothing was found with a quick look but 3 old floppy drives. These were secured in one of John's bags before they came to a door. The door opened up.
" That's not the only thing,but more stable we will both be afterwards." He grabbed,took off the lid of the oil, and scooped a small,clearish white mass on his first and middle finger and looked at John with a grin.
Amused, he thought Sherlock's spine would be a petrified forest in Lesbos. Loosened, but he could still see every bump along his backbone.
"Like with some blood pressure medication?" John added, looking from Sherlock to the parade.
John followed quick as he could. It felt safer to be away from all of the wind on a tiny high rise this far up, but it was mostly dark.
Weather like this would very likely mean less cases, but for once, Sherlock wasn't very upset at the idea. This spell couldn't and likely won't very long, and he was locked with company he didn't mind near as much as most.
I had a long, drawn out storyline to type out, but I've been wanting to show value in saying less,so these came out
Sherlock twisted his wrist out of Mycroft's hand and looked at him directly.
Originally, he had traveled far to look into where Rosie's great grandchildren ended up,and Harry and Clara did have a son later in life after Harry kept sober permenantly, enough for a final reconciliation.
like water for me, coaxing
The way to the front room was blocked off with a mostly clear,amber colored sliding door and a neon poster was lit up and hanging to the side of it.
"Have you heard anything about a case yet today?" John asked, setting his work bag down and smiling.
Amber glared at him, angry.
"You never like relying on your brother! Are you going to use him to bypass questioning that YOU suggested the M.E.T, not to mention this side of England, start?" John asked, starting to jog to keep up with an excited Sherlock.
While John didn't keep up with overseas music, a laid back environment that served childish breakfast dishes along with coffee had an appeal. There didn't seem to be as much hiding or anyone on the date to worry about looking higher class or mannerly when... varieties of cereal and coffee were the surrounding focus that was set!
"That is no way to be now, lay down and curl up" Sherlock said as he stretched out and motioned for John to lay down on the inside of the couch.
You often seem to talk over me
" Yes you git, I've had this set up for days,but then we've been locked inside after the last storm. I was sure you were dying for a case or a reason to get outside before the next storm hits in a few days."
"What are you doing here Mr. Holmes?" John asked, without looking away from Sherlock.
Well, especially after the last chapter, I figured it was time to focus more on cases and work....but you know how the boys can write themselves. I can't get them to entirely quit, and even in the BBC show,it was the small things that said the most.
Molly was waiting on them when they got home,and soon left with Rosie.
John blushed and looked back at the parade. He should have figured it was long planned. His knees, wrists, and many places were still sore, but apparently he liked being pinned the way Sherlock had done it, even if the ambition was the last thing he was expecting.(though he can't say it was unwanted by any means). You don't need to stab something through to keep it wanting to stay in place.
"Hmmm?" John said, leaning against a shelf, sipping his own cup of coffee mixed the way he liked.
"What is Zoladex? It's one of the few drugs I've never heard of on the streets. What is it for John?" Sherlock asked.
There were many that walked through this area, and took stairs and elevators to live and shop on foot.
"I DON'T FORGET! If I could save just save-" Sherlock sighed and put his head in his hands and sat on the steps.
"So let me get this straight" John said,pacing in front of the fireplace.
Apparently in London there was a cereal killer cafe' thought up be an American rap artist with silly sounding specials.
The tall man (the brother of the man who originally hired Jeremy? The blonde one couldn't be the brother) took a bite and waved at Lianne with the spoon still in his mouth.
He jumped as he heard angry waves on the side of the yacht,and thumps and muffling very far above.
After being on such alert for much of the morning, and nothing changing within the same,well walked walls,John took a seat on the couch.
In combat,you could never be certain what is will be around to use. Swordfighting could help guide someone in different ways of fighting and moving.  Even in the event of a surprise attack,there may only be tools or trashed parts to pick up and fight with.
Art by chained-to-the-mirror !
Sherlock texted notes into his cell concerning the case they were on. He'll send it to Lestrade when he gets around a phone signal again,which apparently wasn't anywhere in 221B after the latest snow in had him and John trapped.
"I'm not suggesting you are, but you have been going after criminals that lead to too many close calls" Sherlock was about to protest when John held up a finger. "I know better than to try and get you to stop. I can only make sure do not get out of practice of going about fighting the right way." John looked down at his practice piece,but kept talking. "I was there to tackle and keep that child killer restrained until Donavon put cuffs on him and he was taken to the back of the police car. Before that,he was sitting on you with his hands around your neck!" By then,John had nearly hissed the last piece and looked up at Sherlock with a bit of sadness before he got under control.
"Don't get caught" Sherlock smiled before moving to a dumpster in an alley,three roads down from the taped scene.
When John was fully changed and had all of the bags packed, Sherlock soon jogged up the stairs with a full folder.
"So you can forget about tonight? Do you want to?"Sherlock whispered.
The husband came from a very wealthy family that thought it wrong that Katy was 10 years older, had no recognized family,and did something as unladylike as work her way up in the army. She had been sleeping her way up ranks before she was transferred under John,who did not trust her. The one time John and a small group were sent away while the group Katy was in was told to stay back and guard the base, he should have had someone on hand he trained to watch his back. According to the gossip afterwards for anyone with ears at the bar/grill called Selene's.
Sherlock scrolled through the Wikipedia pages. Even skipping through the religious mythology that easily gets to wars, a lot that was found on a holiday very popular worldwide made little sense.
"We're not investigating anything done by him, unless you know otherwise" John said, walking out towards the pool and giving him a side eyed look.
Neither had cared to get properly dressed. They had only walked around in a towel or a blue dressing gown because the curtains were drawn away from the window, and yesterday was John's last day of work before his next small stretch of time off.
He walked downstairs and found a wooden stool in the kitchen that had a leather seat. This one was tucked to the side and kept for guests,but not many guests stopped by and stayed in thier kitchen long.(even without the blizzards)
"What do you mean others? Other what?"
Sounded like a hard nightshift, but Sherlock quickly ran up to and kissed him.
Eventually,they could hear Moriarty laughing as a car drove up,and sped away after he slammed the door getting in.
He grabbed John's shoulder and turned his head to plant a long kiss that was soon turned heavy before backing away and was getting out of the car.
John woke to strange calls and silence. The storm was over.
Sherlock messed up on the stroke with the bow of his violin. After the high pitched shrill noise that shrieked from the bow,he stopped to get his thoughts together for a moment.
As the day went on, there were still no signs of anyone near the residence. Hearing of another storm on the way, Mrs. Hudson had long left to stay with a cousin that lived in a warmer area,far from the blizzards that since,had been hitting London.
"Yes it is, what's it about at this hour?"
John almost stumbled opening the door, because it looked straight down a cliff to the rocks below.
He carried the teas on a tray to the living room, and set the tray on a table. Turning to look at Sherlock's chair, he saw the coat had been hung up and shoes untied, but still on his feet as he sat in his chair, looking at John with his hands on each armwrest.
"Ma'am,who is this Brian on your husband's phone?" he calmly asked.
"Whaaa?" John stammered,then followed close behind,both towels in his arms.
He leaned his head closer to a wide eyed John.
Sherlock walked over, peeking his head out of the tangle his shirt had him and his bandaged arms stuck in trying to get it off.
=========≠=============≠===============
He had already looked closely at both ears and it was clear. Both of his eardrums were popped among other concussive damage.
Peeking over at the windows being dark,it was obvious to John that it was night again. Peeking around the floor,the messes and many things that needed to be put up correctly and cleaned before morning came back,he had work to get to,Molly would drop off Rosie before her work...
John felt beyond arguing with someone not conscious. He was tired and sore himself, and if direct body heat transfer kept Sherlock calm?
"The paperwork will be a mess, but it tends to be more often than not" Lestrade continued." I know it's very late to be this far from Baker Street,but the new hotel that first noticed inconsistencies in it's accounts and started this whole case said it found a room for you two for the night"
When the quiet spell ended, there were a good number of enemy soldiers driving tanks through, and shooting through whoever they got near in the trenches.
Out of nowhere,a cab appeared and Sherlock was able to stop it.
He filled two cups with the right amounts of milk and sugar before topping both cups off with the tea when it was finished.
John had been awake for some time now, and was back to thoughts of coffee. There was a heavy weight laying on top of his right arm that for once, was an entirely relaxed deadweight.
"You would think at a Star Trek convention,the guys here would have no problem talking to us respectfully. It's always been good at these to talk to guys without getting hit on constantly or told to take it off,but now they seem almost scared of us" one of the older women dressed in red said, frustratingly.
Sherlock fed the ropes while John kept them untangled as he used rods sticking out the side of the crank to turn it like a steering wheel.
It was on a large yacht, on an unknown course between the English Channel and the Celtic sea.
John chewed, swallowed, and gave Sherlock a confused glare.
John noticed it was driven by a different driver, but smiled and shook his head. Only Sherlock was able to get rides from cabs that appeared seemingly out of nowhere at night.
Sherlock was sitting on the couch before John had lowered himself to look, sitting right by him. It was easy to see that he was still busy in his mind palace,but he soon looked over.
As Lestrade drove away,John came downstairs, got what was finished cooking in the pan,cut it in half and made plates for both of them.
Sherlock listened closely, but when it got to the husband talking, John noticed the husband was watching every bit of Sherlock's seeming body language as the consultant was getting back into not keeping entirely still again.
"Are you Mr. Holmes?" the man said, soon after sitting.
No use beating a dead horse when it was obvious to John that Sherlock would have no such interest in something that,well, he only showed amorous sides when it served him to. John was no case,so he should let it be.
What kind of woman would even know to look for him? So many were fans of the blog, and especially the one with the fascinating mind that often gets blogged about, but no one looked to track down the blogger?
Yes,John would never dream of overstepping the line with his best friend he also works with....and fell asleep cuddling....and can't stop thinking of...this is this fanbase!
"Can't sleep now? I'm often the first one up" Sherlock mumbled. He was no expert on people, but he could tell when something seemed off with John.
"There on the shelf by your head over there," John pointed. "I'm getting us some oatmeal started, and yes, you can put sugars on yours before I leave them to steep."
Ok I threw this back to pretty early on,right after the move back to Baker Street. We all know Sherlock,he has feelings, even if he often comes off as almost rude or harsh expressing them.
Sherlock was at the corner of a desk, and gave a slow, large grin before stepping out towards the doorway and pulling John's arm. They walked past Mycroft as he stepped out of the way and locked the door to his office again before stepping back in the hallway.
He washed his hair, (Mycroft also had shampoo that smelled like more than he would spend money on himself, but it was nothing like Sherlock's) before rinsing completely off.
This will go from one pov to another,then I will go back and work on past chapter re edits
"As you wish. " John kept talking,so Sherlock would have something to focus on other than his thigh being cut and adjusted as the implant was nudged to one side and moved out. " It would have the same effect as fixing a dog. You would get lazy, your metabolism would slow down, libido would not be a thought...well!" He said, keeping one side nudged and wiggling, seeing the other end of the implant surfaced,where it was pinched and easily taken out.*Now that it is gone,you should be back to normal by next week and" John mentioned, putting a band aid over the cut on his thigh " I would be back to no help getting decent weight on you for long".
“He’s my friend!! He’s my friend please!! Get out of my way!” He couldn’t keep the slight desperation out of his voice.
But Sherlock gently cupped his face in his hands and lifted the doctor’s head slowly, their foreheads nearly touching and their eyes locked tightly.
“I’m sure your own brilliant mind will figure it out. Two hours Sherlock and I’ll be back I promise.”
Sherlock froze on the spot, a cold dread sweeping through his body as he could already read what the teen was thinking of. “Charlie..” Sherlock spoke softly and very slowly reached out for the boy, as if he just concentrated hard enough, he could hold him back with telepathy.
!” He answered exasperated and shoved his phone back into his pocket to protect it from further trauma in this moron’s presents.
“Oh you are Mr Davis. I’ve arranged a nice little post for you as a traffic officer in Noida, India. It’s in a tough and terribly crime infested neighbourhood I’m afraid, but you seem to have very high thoughts of yourself so it shouldn’t be anything you can’t handle. Your plane will be leaving in 8 hours so I suggest you start packing.” Mycroft said, a satisfied but terrifying smile adorning his face.
Sherlock snorted.
(Gollum watches from behind Frodo with a sly smile on his face)
“I don’t care Sherlock!! Now you tell me, what the hell have you done to John this time?!” The DI scowled dangerously, his eyes flashing with anger and worry and hands tightening their grip on Sherlock’s coat, keeping him pressed hard against the wall.
Afterwards Sherlock and Molly proceeded to pack up their stuff and exited the hospital out into the cold October night. They said their goodbyes and Sherlock even offered up a quick one-armed hug, something Molly had never seen him offer anyone before. They headed off in each their direction.
John lifted his head to see Sherlock smiling down at him and then returned the smile.
“It’s alright, I’m here now. It’s okay, I’ll make it all okay again John.” Sherlock whispered reassuringly and increased the pressure slightly on John’s shoulder.
“John, are you alright? How long have you been standing there?” Sherlock exclaimed and quickly made his way to his side.
“I’m not a child John.” Sherlock scowled, not at all pleased as he was left alone with the optometrist woman beside him.
Back in Bakerstreet Sherlock had lit up the fireplace, the flames and a small lamp by the couch the only things lightning up the room, bathing it in a soft glow.
“Next time John?.. Next time?!!!” Sherlock shouted angrily before continuing.
John could almost imagine how Sherlock felt when deducing as his eyes scanned his lover’s face and came up with conclusions along the way.
Those words had hung in the air. Lestrade felt his chest grow with pride hearing them and neither felt the need to elaborate further on the matter. Just as well, cause in that moment John came back with his coffee and the three sat together for a while. It wasn’t long however till Lestrade felt himself being pulled under my tiredness so John and Sherlock took this as their cue to leave, with the promise to come visit again tomorrow.
hear any of you talk to him like that again or you’ll have to deal with me. Understood?”
“E-Excuse me.” The woman stammered, obviously feeling very uncomfortable.
“OI!! LET GO OF HIM!!!” Before he sprinted the rest of the way down the alley. He jumped with all his might, thankful for his many years playing rugby, as he tackled the giant bastard to the ground. John quickly gained the upper hand in their scuffle, having the advantage as the man had been surprised by his attack. He managed to plant one knee firmly on the man’s sternum as he landed punch after punch on his face as hard and fast as he could.
A few more minutes passed and Sherlock’s lightheadedness only seemed to grow worse and worse. He took himself to the head with one hand and tried to take some deep breaths through his nose and out of his mouth.
"Y-Yes please, that would be n-nice."
At least she had the decency to look up from her phone for a minute to spare him a glance of total indifference. “He’s in there.” She said and nodded her head in the right direction, indicating the nearest building that towered right next to the harbour edge. “He just said it was high time the two of you had a chat. I’m sure it won’t take long.” She finished, clearly feeling like she’d explained enough and returned her full attention to the screen of her phone.
At this Sherlock immediately stood and, without a single word, crossed the room in three long strides so he stood in front of John to pull the man into a comforting embrace.
John had just placed two fresh steaming cuppas on the table as he felt two long, lanky arms dressed in a blue gown enveloping him from behind and a soft pair of warm lips kissing his neck gently.
“Because, Sherlock, Jones had slowed down and turned around with a bloody gun in his hands!! He was going to shoot you!!”
you only brought me here with his best interests in heart, because of your concern and love for him. But I promise you, that I'll
Sherlock was leaning back against the bar, his arms crossed on top on the counter, his whiskey waiting untouched in front of him. He still eyed the man with controlled contempt, but tried his best to act civil now that he at least seemed genuine apologetic for his actions.
John is grateful for the strong arms of his boyfriend that makes him feel safe and loved when he needs it the most.
“Wise man.” He replied. Suddenly John’s eyes lit up as if he’d been struck with a moment of genius. “Listen mate! Why don’t you join me in the gym? They have this huge space with padded floors no one hardly uses. I could teach you some techniques, help you build up some core and upper body strength. You’ll be taking down bad guys left and right when I’m done with you I promise.” John said enthusiastically, his grin growing bigger and bigger.
Finally looking up Sherlock’s thoughts were proven right, but he still couldn’t keep the surprise of his face when seeing the man standing in front of him, now rubbing the slightly sore point of contact right above his right pectoral.
The men shared a quick look and a smile before one of them replied, the name on his desk said his name was Robertson. “Ah sorry mate, you just missed her. Don’t think she’ll be back for a while.” He smirked.
Sherlock stepped up and wrapped his arms back around his doctor and planted a soft kiss right on his lips.
John sighed and grasped Anderson’s shoulder to make the man look him back into his eyes. “Listen mate. First - do I think cheating on your wife was wrong? Yes - I do, but I get it. You fell in love with Sally and you tried to do the right thing and get a divorce so you could be with her, it just didn’t end out in your favour and that sucks. Besides, it takes two to cheat. Sally was as much a cheater as you. Second - Do I like the way you’ve been treating Sherlock? No I don’t, but then again, I understand he hasn’t always been civil with you either and we’re going to work on that. But when all I said and done, I don’t think you’re a bad guy Anderson and you’re a good forensic, even Sherlock knows that, he just doesn’t want to admit it. You don’t deserve this and nobody thinks you do or hates you in any way, believe me.”
Not many words were exchanged between the two. They found no need for words and let their actions speak for themselves, much like the actions their friends had taken today when that despicable man had insulted John in the worst way.
“There’s two ambulances on standby, let’s go and get you checked over just in case mate. You sure as hell gave us a scare, but bloody well done!” Greg praised, beyond relieved John seemed more or less unharmed.
In that moment she couldn’t help but be amazed at how vulnerable and soft Sherlock looked, his usually stoic façade falling away, revealing how worried he really must have been for her. Of course she’d always known Sherlock wasn’t as cold and apathetic as he always appeared to be. She’d known he was a good man the moment he’d went above and beyond to make sure her awful husband would never get to lay another hand on her again and he’d proven it many times since then. Like the time he’d thrown that man out that window just for striking her.
He should’ve been there. He should’ve prevented this all together, why hadn’t he noticed Sherlock missing from his side immediately? Could he ever forgive himself for letting this happen? All these thoughts raced through the doctor’s mind as he quickly stripped off his own jacket and draped it across Sherlock’s thin frame to shield him from the cold and once again hiding his alabaster skin from the view of the filth laying behind them. “Oh God, Sherlock what did he do to you?” John whispered sadly as he pulled his detective closer to him.
Charlie simply nodded and sprinted off in the direction he’d come from, John right on his heels. Only one thing playing in the doctor’s mind.
Sally listened with a rising panic as the two pairs of footsteps started to move away from the door. “No! No wait!! Let me out! You can’t bloody leave me here!! LET ME OUT!!” She all but screamed at the end but it was no use, both men had left already.
Sherlock chuckled at his mobile screen. Honestly, he’d never understand the fascination of a game consisting of a bunch of sweaty men, running around like fools, trying to kick a ball into a net. He’d choose boring biopsies and paperwork over football any day.
“Yeah I know I’m all sweaty, sorry. Let me just take a quick shower in the changing room and we can be on our way.” John said, about to turn around to head for the shower, but before he could go Sherlock grabbed his wrist.
John jumped out of hiding and quickly aimed towards the proximate area of which he knew the sniper were located, based on the shots fired earlier. He shot his gun 1.. 2.. 3 times. In the corner of his eye he could just make out Mycroft racing towards the exit, reaching the door, ripping it open and charging into the night outside. Once he knew Mycroft was safe he threw himself into cover once again. Up above he heard the raging cry of the Russian as he realized his prime target had just escaped him.
“Thanks love.” He muttered and closed his eyes once again, trying to get the pain back under control as much as possible.
In a sudden moment of fuelling anger Sherlock leapt from his chair and picked up the nearest object in arms reach, which turned out to be the mantelpiece skull and tossed it hard against the wall opposite to him. A loud crack followed as it hit and acquired a rather impressive fracture. Sherlock stared at it for a while before all his energy left him once again and he crumpled to the floor, now leaning against the bottom of the chair. Briefly wishing that the skull was his own. God knows it was what he deserved after everything he had done to John tonight…
John laughed before gently taking his detective by the arm, forcing him to stand and started to make his way towards the front door.
Sherlock swallowed. “Oh, I.. May have miscalculated a bit then.” He said.
“3 years…” Was all he said and John’s brow furrowed in confusion.
"Acceptable I g-guess." Sherlock answered nonchalantly, not really wanting to admit how much those ideas pleased him.
Dimmock smiled gratefully. “Will do, thanks Dr. Watson.” Before leading his son onwards to his own office.
“Who the fuck are you and what the hell are you doing in my home?” He yelled.
Reluctantly the paramedic nodded and Sherlock climbed along into the back of the ambulance, his hand still firmly holding on to Lestrade’s all the way to the hospital.
“GET DOWN!” John shouted and put action into his words as he tackled Mycroft to the ground to take cover behind a large machine station. A sharp bang rang out in that exact moment and the phone in Mycroft’s hand shattered as the bullet ripped the device apart, once again leaving them both in complete darkness.
Sherlock sighed loudly but raised his glass non the less just to be polite. They clinked their glasses softly once and Sherlock took a large sip from his drink, feeling the need of blissful alcohol to soothe his patience after having to deal with this moron for the past 10 minutes. The amber liquid warmed him all the way down this throat and he let out a sigh, this time of delight, loving the smooth taste and slight burn the drink had to offer making him feel more at ease immediately.
Sherlock worked John’s shoulder for another 10 minutes before rising and walking towards the kitchen, returning a couple of minutes later with a cup of steaming hot tea and some aspirin in his hands to help the headache.
John’s heart wrenched at the sight. Without a word, he walked over and sat on the armrest at Sherlock’s side and gently placed his arms around the slight framed man in a comforting way and pulled him close to his chest, kissing the top of the dark curls. Sherlock didn’t offer him as much as a glance.
"You saved so many lives tonight John.. You're amazing - so many lives and so many families that are still whole and able to be with their loved ones because of you love."
Also I couldn’t help myself but adding a tiny, tiny bit of subtext Mystrade, but it is very minor and not a big part of the story since I wanted it to focus on the relationship between Sherlock and Lestrade.
Mrs. Hudson however seemed to accept defeat on the matter and immediately cheered back up again. “Why don’t I just pop downstairs and bring us up some cherry scones? They’re almost freshly baked.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
Sherlock’s heart broke just a bit more hearing such a speech coming from such a young boy. Maybe even more so because, not that long ago, he could have uttered almost the exact same statements and believed them to be true. Also he did not like the reminder this situation brought when he’d been the one standing on the edge of a rooftop and he knew from personal experience how much hurt and anguish it brought to the people around you to make a decision like this. No matter how unloved or un needed Charlie believed himself to be, he’d leave a hole behind for many people around him. The boy just hasn’t realized that yet, so Sherlock felt the most important duty in his life this moment, is to make Charlie believe it.
Okay, so maybe it wasn’t such a great mystery why Sherlock was so thrilled about tonight. John himself really just looked forward to spending the night with his lover, listening to some beautiful music and to savour Sherlock’s happiness. But first ting first…
?!!” He exclaimed loudly in slight outrage in the way she had just explained lying unconscious on the floor as if she’d just overslept in the morning.
John Watson stood in front of the mirror, hanging above the fireplace in 221B. He let out a few muttered curses as he undid his sloppy tie knot and started over once again. It had been ages since he had found a need to wear a tie and he was clearly out of practice, but tonight he wanted to look his absolute best. Sherlock had bought tickets to a grand concert at the Royal opera house and the doctor was looking forward to a hopefully great date night with his favourite detective. John knew how much Sherlock himself had been looking forward to this night, ever since he’d purchased the tickets and presented them to John as a surprise. Apparently the conductor of the night was a big star in the music world and had finally made his way back to London after many years abroad.
“I don’t care that you are bored Sherlock!! Boredom is not an excuse to start shooting the wall or keeping organs in the fridge!! I’m sick and tired of coming home after a long day of work to deal with these kinds of things I.. Arrg!!”  John threw his hands up in frustration only to slump down into his own chair and buried his face in his hands. The heart now left on the coffee table.
If anything positive was to come of this, it was that Singer obliviously committed crimes of passion with very little thought involved. He would simply drive around in London’s less busy streets and whenever he stumbled upon a potential victim, he’d ram them down with his car at full speed and then flee the scene. This messy and coarse method had made it almost embarrassingly easy for Sherlock and the yard to track him and collect a massive mountain of evidence against him, to make sure he’d spend the rest of life in prison. In truth, Lestrade and his team would no doubt have been able to crack this case on their own, but since Singer seemed to be in a hurry, Sherlock and John had joined the case in the hopes it would speed things up before the psycho decided to kill yet again.
John looked to her at the table. “Is that true Mrs. Hudson? Have you been ill?” He asked, immediately slipping into doctor mode.
“If I ever hear you talk about John or Sherlock that disrespectfully again I can assure you there’s a lot more where that came from.” The DI growled dangerously.
Together as a team Molly and Sherlock worked effortlessly. They were in sync, focused and effective as they made their way through the large stack of biopsies to work through. Afterwards they made their way to the morgue, where Molly did the autopsies and Sherlock weighted the organs, noted findings and assisted with the various tasks required. Afterwards they headed back to the lab to write up the different paperwork that needed to be completed, sent and filed. The clock on the wall read 2:55 as the final journal was filed.
Molly Chuckled. “No, well yes it
John couldn’t help but enjoy how Donovan's and Anderson's faces grew even redder with embarrassment and left both of them speechless for a couple of moments.
“Excuse me.” John said, glad to get the chance to leave the company of Ethan Davis and went to join Sherlock.
Sherlock had given them a fair chance to come clean and confess. They had not done so and had now even indirectly admitted that they’d planned to leave Sally down there for a good while yet. The detective took a deep breath before he leaned slightly forward in his chair, before fitting both men with one of his terrifying fake smiles and continued in the politest manner. “If any of you ever lay a hand on Sally Donovan again or pull any stunt like the one you did today I’ll make personally sure that your wife..” Sherlock pointed to Jackson before continuing; “Will know that you’re having an affair with her twin brother.” Jackson’s eyes went comically large and his entire face got paler than a ghost. “And prove that you..” Sherlock then pointed to Robertson. “have been stealing large fortunes of money from all the charities you so often ‘generously’ helps organizing.” Robertson looked positively sick at that moment. Sherlock’s hands went to their prayerlike position and his fake smile grew ever the slightest larger. “Now, have I made myself clear?” Both men nodded madly, but both were deathly silent. Sherlock clasped both his hands on his thighs and stood. “Good now that’s settled I’ll take my leave, but just remember what I said, I won’t forget.” He said with a teasing wiggling indexfinger before making his was to Lestrade/ Sally’s office to retrieve her things.
John squeezed both of Mycroft’s shoulders a little tighter and offered him the most reassuring smile he could muster at the moment. “Yes you can and you will Mycroft.” John chewed his bottom lip for a few seconds as he thought of the next words to escape his mouth. “I know how much you care for Sherlock and I
“What?! You find that amusing do you?!” John demanded his eyes and voice clearly warning Sherlock not to anger him further.
John barely heard the sentence to and end before he sat down his coffee, nearly spilling it all over a deputy’s desk and ran as fast as he could towards Dimmock’s office, with Sherlock close behind. John rushed through the open door and indeed, in the middle of the floor sat the young Daniel, wheezing loudly and fast, tears running down his cheeks. Dimmock were kneeled in front of his boy, trying to help him, but looking panicked and scared out of his mind. When John entered, he looked up, fear in his eyes.
"It's starting again..."
, Victor thought to himself and waved back. He went into the coffee shop, ordered a tea at the counter, and went over to the lecturer.
Sherlock startled when the door opened and another nurse wheeled in a bassinet padded with several soft cloths. A small bundle lay in the midst, its tiny red face peeking out with its eyes pinched shut. Miniature fingers peeped out of the rolled-up sleeves of a much too large onesie. The nurse pushed the bassinet over to the other side of the bed and carefully picked the baby up before settling it in Anthea's arms, smiling broadly.
"Hello?" a female voice inquired.
"Good morning," John said and poured a second cup of tea, which he slid across the counter to Sherlock before returning his attention to his phone.
Sherlock didn't even look up from his microscope, but let out a neutral-sounding grunt, fixed a new slide under the clips on the stand, and adjusted the eyepiece.
"Sorry you needed to change your suit on my account, Mycroft. Blood's the dickens to get out, unfortunately," Moriarty declared with a slight slur to his voice. He'd probably been given some medication to numb the pain. Bloody saliva dribbled out of the corner of his mouth, and he made a big show out of catching the moisture with his tongue.
He whimpered softly and twisted his fists harder in the sheets as more omega essence trickled out of his body, dribbling across his skin in beads. Something firm and hot caught some of the drops, smearing them around. Sherlock's first thought was of the plump head of his alpha's cock, but that was impossible. John was still holding onto him tightly, his mouth mere centimetres away from Sherlock's – oh...
Anthea lay on the bed, holding her stomach. Her face was bathed in sweat and loose strands of hair clung to her forehead and cheek. Her panicked eyes latched onto Sherlock.
"Anyway, I'd be ever so pleased if you said yes," Abigail said, tearing Victor out of his thoughts.
"You shouldn't have attended to me, you should have gone to help Sherlock..." Victor paused when he noticed John's hands clenching into fists. The tension in his shoulders was unmistakable. The alcohol and anger circulating in John's blood were a dangerous combination. But Victor couldn't manage to keep his words to himself. The idea had nagged at him for too long and he was too frustrated at losing Sherlock. "You should have saved him, not me."
"Sherlock... it's so good to see you," she said in her typical monotone, which Sherlock had greatly missed hearing. He smiled at her, only to redirect his gaze downward when a tiny fist tapped his shoulder, and his attention was demanded by a series of babbles.
John took a few breaths,looked up at Sherlock and quietly huffed. "You should know better than to corner me. What is the meaning for this? This is-"
"That will be more efficient, but let me see the messages."Sherlock read through the phone."This is too easy, I'll just text him back where they should be looking,and it won't interrupt anything for you,Molly,or Rosie."
Puffins were out and surrounding a tall man with bright pyjamas and a cup of coffee.
He listened to the traffic on the road, several yards to his right. He heard a dog barking,then the owner laughing and playing with it. He kept walking forward, hearing the snow crunch under his feet.
"Maybe I'll show you later how I was able to make the connections. For now, food is not enough. I'm sorry"
Sherlock woke with his hands and feet manacled against a brick wall. He had an IV attached to his left arm, and apparently he had a catheter in as well, leading to a large, almost empty bag hung on a stand near his leg. His mouth was covered with a cloth wrapping.
"If you want to forget this ever happened, I'll respect it. If you want to go on another boring date and wish? Your choice. I won't be in your way. I will be here when you want to cry again, What I mean is" he grabbed John's shoulder and the front of his shirt and pulled him close,giving him a soft,but very exploratory kiss.
"What will you do about it John?! I keep saving the day,saved you, and finally arranged to give you what I've deduced may have been one of the best sexual experiences you have had in a long time, despite your dating and past marriage. I think I need something more,but I can't put my finger on it. Too much messy sentiment" Sherlock started out by shouting,but ended in a mumble and his head in his hands.
Ever steady gaze but slowly narrowing focus
Anderson crept back, clumsy but as quiet as he could before he could sprint to his car.
"We'll do whatever statements or anything left to do at Lestrade's office later or tomorrow. You can get back to your job, I just need to sleep, and that's something I don't think you would disagree with me on. I don't want to talk to most right now, and you have the exciting things for your blog. Nothing to see right now."
John felt stuffed when he finished his bowl and his tea. Sherlock had finished his bowl, his tea and still went through a few more scones. Once again, as usual, it was hard to get him to eat anything trying to narrow down and properly catch the right suspects in this case.
Coming downstairs, Sherlock grumbled and walked up a few steps, adjusting the button up part of John's top and adjusting the cuffs correctly as well.
Sherlock just stood where he was at while John tried talking to a circle of women. He kept looking around him for anything that seemed off with the surroundings.
Looking down, he saw that Sherlock had the boots on as well.
John was relieved that while he had bruises starting up from wrestling the husband into being tied to the staircase with ropes,there was no harm beyond fighting to restrain the husband. As Sherlock had mentioned, the wife had been knocked out and cuffed. He wasn't physically assaulted,but his mind?
Rosie liked that Poplock did not talk to her like she was a baby and smiled, even as her car seat was being lifted and buckled into a car that was the replacement for the car that had been hit on one of the 'cases' they like to go on about.
_________________________________________
"We have a printer here and you can pack the bags while I get together and show you what I have planned out in my head. We should hurry and be out before Mycroft stumbles by," Sherlock said, darting towards the laptop and getting the printer out and plugged in.
" You think you're the only clever one?"Anderson said,"I'm only doing my job, and" he smiled as Lestrade turned around" I think the evidence points out...that she was still alive when she came here and died, and not dropped off like some" he nodded towards Sherlock "want to think"
The fox then jumped on a chair,then a table,then out of the open window.
"She didn't run you down too much did she?" John asked, getting a cup for Sherlock at walking the coffee.
The muscle could be followed all along the side of John's arm,to his softer flank, only to continue noticeably along his hip and leg. His rear was covered lightly by the towel that Sherlock felt was only begging to be removed, but John would not react well to that! He kept choosing to date and even marry women who did not have the nerve or sense to do half of what Sherlock has done for him!
If proven true,it would show a dangerous incompetence and ruin the reputations of ones over English rule. Many would lose trust from the populace, and many enemies could easily have a field day showing off how easily access to apparent secrets was gained.
As he unzipped the jacket,he could feel the rest being pulled off of his shoulders.
Lestrade had been hesitant to check through this area,since it was an old, condemned arsenal building the army had left long ago. Could be dangerous from what old was left behind, possibly missed being stolen, could be dangerous because it was falling apart,and someone not familiar with it could easily get badly injured, and have the right to sue.
I had believed that
The waiter showed up with thier orders on a tray, and gave Amber a bowl of mixed cereal John could not recognize in chocolate milk.
"John?! John! I should be affected, but I am not. Are you unaffected as well?" Sherlock said.
The violin could be heard at any time, reflecting the mood of the one playing it. Sometimes it made a calm, soothing melody. At least there were times of such when this started, almost a month ago.(far too long ago it seemed to the one who could not slip while stitching up anyone)
Even though it was more of a matter of signing papers for the marriage, her and her red headed, noticably younger husband still walked down the hallway while music played on a cell phone. John was not only invited, but walked with her down the hallway to 'give her away'.
“Please help! I need to call the police!! Do you have a phone I can borrow? It’s an emergency!!” The boy panted, out of breath from running so hard.
Sherlock returns home cold and soaked to the bone and John thinks of a nice gesture to make his boyfriend feel better
“I know you’ve been trying to hide it Sherlock, but believe it or not I’m perfectly capable of observing when it regards the health and well-being of my own boyfriend. You’ve been rubbing your eyes more and more frequently in the last week, you only spend half the time at the microscope as you usually do, you’ve started squinting whenever you’re sitting at the computer, read through a casefile or your forensic science magazine and lately you’ve been popping far more painkillers for your headaches than is medically recommended. I therefor deduce.. You are definitely not fine.” John finished these observations, waiting for a response, expecting a rant of protests coming his way shortly.
“That’s enough.” The command finally came from behind the camera and the masked brute immediately stepped back.
Sherlock turned to one of the paramedics. “I’m riding along with him.” He said determined.
Both John and Lestrade huffed in disagreement. “Not at all..” John said. “Hardly..” Lestrade followed up, but didn’t engage further. Both with murder back in their eyes at the mentioning of the man.
John blinked a few times and huffed out. “Our.. Our companionship? You mean how long since we found out our love for each other went beyond friendship and started dating?” He tried to clarify.
Then, early this morning in the middle of morning tea, Sherlock had received a call from Lestrade. A murder of an elderly wealthy woman named Regina Chester. It wasn’t just a regular murder though. This was a locked room mystery murder! Sherlock’s eyes had immediately lit up like Christmas lights in a way that made John chuckle with fondness. The two men had hurried to finish their breakfast before heading out. On the way however, Sherlock mentally cursed himself as he had momentarily forgotten John’s predicament completely as he watched his lover flinch every time the cab hit a bump in the road.
Just then Mrs. Hudson exited the kitchen, wearing a pink apron adorned with a vivid flower print and wiping her hands off in a tea towel, as she saw John her smile widened.
The detective observed as Charlies’ breathing speed up slightly and his face flamed up at the question. Anger, sadness and a heartbreaking mixture of emotions once again taking over the boy’s features.
John’s eyes widened with the realisation. He hadn’t even noticed the onions until now. He looked down at the countertop with the book Sherlock and been engrossed in when he first entered. It was a cooking book.
John was right. During the last week or so he found it harder and harder to focus on his work. His eyes felt terrible stained in no time whenever he tried to read his casefiles, articles and writing notes during experiments, while words would simply start to blur after just 15 minutes of reading.
“We have to get to the emergency exit located in the other end of the room, staying here will make us sitting ducks.” John explained in a low voice.
“Are you alright?” John panted slightly.
In a last foible attempt Lestrade’s strangled voice called out; “Don’t list…” but the video was cut off, leaving only white static back on the screen.
“Ready to go love?” John asked as a way to pull himself out of his thoughts. They had a whole night ahead of them and John intended to enjoy it to the fullest.
The doctor had spent the last three weeks sheltered in 221B with little to no contact with the outside. Sherlock hadn’t even allowed him to do the shopping and Sherlock hated to do that. John had always been an active person and he felt like being held up for so long had slowly started to make him insane. So when Lestrade had called John earlier that day to hear how he was doing and inviting both John and Sherlock to join the division for drinks at a local bar a few block away from Bakerstreet, John had happily accepted, thrilled at the prospect of getting out and actually being able to socialise a bit.
“What makes you think I was coming on to you? I just wanted to ask you the time.” The man said smugly as he took a large sip from his Guinness, his eyes never leaving Sherlock though.
This. Chapter. Is. So. Late… I’m soooorry! Still hope it’s enjoyable
something to really whine and cry about.” He finished darkly.
You guys I’m so, so, sooooooo sorry! This chapter is so, fucking late! I had the most infuriating writer blog writing this chapter, but I really hope you like it!! I PROMISE the last chapter will be up soon!
As his head started to clear a bit John noticed he was lacking the warmth of his beautiful detective besides him. He however quickly located the man as a distressed voice filled the room; “No, no, no.. This is WRONG!” John was immediately alert then. He quickly did a quick scan of the room to find Sherlock and the source of the man’s distress. Sherlock had moved to sit on the coffee table, closer to the TV, his focus completely pinpointed at the screen. His hands were in his hair as if he was frustrated. John then realized it wasn’t an outer source that was plaguing him, it was obvious the current scene playing on screen.
Sally fitted the boy with a steady gaze. She could tell by now he wasn’t acting and if some creep was out there kidnapping or God forbid molesting children, she was going to do something about it!
“I-I don’t know what’s happening! He complained his throat felt weird a few minutes ago and now he can hardly breath!!”
Sherlock, however couldn’t help his eyes form widening, his mouth drying out and his heartrate elevate slightly at the sight before him. He’d spotted John, who was currently lying down, apparently in the middle of a set of bench-pressing what looked to be a fairly impressive amount of weight. John was wearing a deep green tank top he’d kept from his military days. The fabric was clinging tightly to the blonde’s torso, the front a bit damp from sweat and showing off an array of hard sculpted muscles underneath. John’s face was one of deep concentration as he lowered the heavy bar down just to the point where it made contact with his broad chest, before raising it again with a controlled exhale of air. Even from a distance Sherlock’s eyes could make out a small drop of sweat sliding down the doctor’s temple, onwards down the tan neck and rest in the hollow at the collarbone. Sherlock swallowed, not able to tear his eyes away from the display. He hadn’t even noticed how much John’s physic had changed in just the few months he’d kept to his strict training regime. John’s soft, wholly jumpers and the loose, oversized T-shirts he wears to bed had hidden the man’s sculpted body from Sherlock’s view and since they hadn’t been intimate or very close for such a long time Sherlock simply hadn’t noticed. The detective had been too caught up in his own world and mood swings to pay John’s looks much attention. Something he regretted a great deal right now..
“Afraid not ma’am.” Lestrade answered, actually sounding disappointed himself.
Jackson threw his hands up in mock surrender. “Just saying is all.”
“Yes well.. You were so taken with that onion soup when we visited that French restaurant last month so I figured since you’d been working so hard the last week I would try and replicate it for you.. For us I guess. As a surprise.”
John and Sherlock, together with the entire Scotland Yard, had worked almost nonstop since their involvement in the case to return Lestrade safely. Sherlock had even gone as far as to ask for Mycroft’s assistance in the matter. The government official had offered a whole unit of special trained special ops to assist in the extraction together with a huge access to top of the line government facilities and resources. While happy for the help, that had proved essential to the mission, both Sherlock and John were surprised at Mycroft’s sudden generosity. Usually he would never offer such favours without demanding several others in return, but Mycroft hadn’t as much as mentioned a single ‘you owe me for this’.
