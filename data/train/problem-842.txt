sherlock pushed himself off the sofa, deciding sweatpants, a tee shirt a fuzzy socks isn't proper attire to reunite with his best friend. sherlock rolled his eyes at how gay that sounded in his head as he went upstairs. he went into his room, deciding it was time to unpack his suitcase and do laundry, so that's what he did to pass time.
sherlock sat on his knees between john's legs, looking down at the rugby captain who was giving him an assuring look. sherlock took his cock in hand, pushing into john slowly, groaning at the tight heat that was engulfing his cock.
john set his phone down. "stuff?" he looked up at sherlock. "the biggest dork in all of england has 'stuff' to do on a friday night?"
rudy patted sherlock's shoulder. "it's not healthy to be upset. confront your problems. get it off your chest."
sherlock relaxed in his seat as his flight got delayed for two hours. he took his phone out of his pocket and decided to call his mom, telling he'd be in later than planned.
he pulled out onto the road and heading in town. he buckled up once he was at the stoplight, calming himself some. he got on the highway, heading west to get out of town for a little bit. just until he was calm enough to return because he was at his breaking point. he knew that he shouldn't have went over to john's. he was just asking for his feelings to get hurt.
"fuck you're so open." sherlock gasped as his cock slipped into the wet heat. "how long were you at it, hmmm?" he adjusted himself, thrusting up into the doctor with a force that almost made john topple over.
john pushed back into the hands, rubbing against the crotch of the man underneath him, earning a soft whine and a jerk of the hips. the rugby captain pulled away from the kiss, pushing sherlock's chin back with his thumb and kissing the pale neck. he nipped at the skin, earning a soft whine.
john's smile fell as he looked at his hands. "he's mad about it and he's being crazy about it, but i still have a whole semester at uva." he gained eye contact with sherlock again. "it's my decision, but he's acting like it's ours and that it'll effect our relationship. and he gave me shit about meeting you for lunch. yelled at me over the phone."
“He had just started walking,” Harold started, “he was always running around, chasing Myc and the cats. When he fell down, he had the tendency to pull himself up on things and when he fell in the corridor, he grabbed the table runner on the table in there and everything came crashing down on him.” Harold chuckled at the memory. “Last time he ever pulled on something to get up.”
sherlock hummed, pushing all the way in. “greedy little thing. just took me right it.” he said as he pulled out, thrusting right back in as he watched john squeeze his eyes shut and his mouth fall open.
“How about you go to hell!” John spat, forgetting his place in a moment in favour of his temper. Sherlock blinked, his mouth falling open. John didn’t give him a chance to say anything else, stepping forward so that he was in Sherlock’s space. He was shorter, but it was clear Sherlock hadn’t been challenged in a long time. The Spirit lurched back as if he was scared of being burned. “Now you listen here! Every time I think you’re about to become someone actually
“You know you're welcome here any time, ” Grandma murmured quietly, too quiet for John to really take notice. He did not see how Merina's fingers tightened about her arms as she crossed them over her chest. Her gaze flicked for a moment towards her husband. The salted breeze pulled at tendrils of her hair, making her seem like a wisp about to be tugged away to the wind. Mr Watson's grunts of strain as he tugged the luggage one by one out from the boot of the car were muffled by the ocean, but his cursing could not be. Eva looked at her daughter carefully, noting the lines of stress about her mouth, far too deep for someone so young. When John's mum looked back to them, the expression was gone, replaced with false cheer.
The rain beat out a steady rhythm against the windowpane, drowning out the bustle of noise outside of Gregory Lestrade’s office. The drumming was soothing, leaving the man feeling sleepy despite it being early afternoon. He twiddled with the end of his pen, staring once again at the reports given to him with feigned concentration.
The night burned purple as the sun set, darkness encircling the forest ahead and turning trees into fingers reaching for the sky with bony limbs. John sat atop his perch on the wall, a huddled ball of furs against the autumn chill that turned his breath to smoke and his nose pink and running. The cold tried to seep into everything, from his hands wrapped about his bow to the tips of his ears. Years of training was all that kept him awake against that cold that seemed to so badly wish to tuck him in, making his muscles weary and aching and his eyes red-rimmed and watering.
Sherlock's voice was steady, a rock amidst a floating sea. His voice was low as in the shadow of the mess hall he ducked his head, rumbling apologies that made John's chest tighten.
To that, the only reply was her steadying presence, even as collectively the Alters reached out, knocking on Sherlock Holmes' bedroom door.
“You were protecting her. It was not a mistake. I don't care what you or any one else says. It. Wasn't. A. Mistake. I do not regret being injured. I do not blame you.”
Sadly, he was not disappointed that first night lying next to John. The Water Spirit woke to a thick fog, the mist and shade of his own inner-workings, a full moon overhead alighting his mother in all of her radiance before him. He could already tell as he saw her that she was unhappy. There was a tightness about her lips, and her hands were clasped tightly before her. Her eyes were milk-white, the colour of one using magic to project themselves. Of course, she could not really be there.
Like he was a Hatchling again still unable to control himself, his tail starting wagging in childlike excitement.
Instead they danced about each other, closer than they had been for weeks with their joint determination to beat Sherlock’s eating disorder, and yet further away than they had ever been before in the bedroom. It was absolutely
He barely heard her response, but it carried into his dreams. Wrapped him up safely in comfort, because the Dragon couldn't help but trust the old woman, and coasted silently into the waves of his mind.
He did not notice how Sherlock scratched at the inside of his arms almost longingly, or how later on the detective stood to look at his reflection, grimacing at some fault unseen. John did not see the little bottle, labelled
in the morning.” His pale eyes flicked pointedly to Victor's feet, his smirk widening as he saw the clashing red and green cuffs peeking over his dormate's shoes. Victor chuckled, the sound low, but it cut off when he saw the material of Sherlock's shirt. Black silk. Fancy. His frown was small, strangely unsettling on his normally sunny face, and he looked up at Sherlock uncertainly.
John found his reply was somewhat cool, despite the fact he didn't dislike his commanding officer. Something about her just rubbed him the wrong way.
Sherlock, murmured the translation aloud, his rumbling voice glossing over the words as if they were slicked with blood.
“You need to eat, and I need answers. I figured killing two birds with one stone would cost me nothing. Now,
in our language means kin, but it's an extremely vague term. Intimate, but vague. It might be an egg-brother, or just a very close friend. We don't know who he is talking about, and his Mistress doesn't know either. She has said that until now she's never heard the term pass her Dragon's lips."
John found himself alone in his flat with a seething Sherlock and a pounding headache. Worse, he realised that not only did he somehow pass the final test to going to war, but he was now an honorary soldier. He groaned, cupping his chin and moving to rub at his face and eyes.
and haltingly, John explained the row he'd had, the cold silence after, and the worrying absence of his flatmate even when he was only a room away. He spoke of the concern he felt worming away in his gut, and his anger at both Sherlock and himself. He explained until his mouth felt dry and he went to drink from his pint, only to discover that he'd managed to drain it over the course of the conversation. During it all Greg remained quiet, eyes glinting in understanding and growing distress the more John opened up. When the army doctor finished, the DI all but groaned, rubbing at his face as he struggled to find a solution to the tangled mess the helpless man before him seemed to have gotten himself into.
“I…did not realise you felt that way. It appears I have… overstepped my authority.” The words sat awkwardly between them, sincere but wrong coming from Sherlock’s lips. John refused to feel sorry. He refused to feel anything. Sherlock seemed to be looking right through him, lost in some memory. He made as if to move, ignoring John’s offended cry as he pushed past him abruptly.
Things are beginning to reach the climactic part of this section of my story. We are coming to a close on John's war years. I hope you enjoy.
“You’re positively selfless, you are.” John retorted dryly, rolling his eyes and sighing. Of course it had been too good to be true, to expect Sherlock to do something out of the pure goodness of his heart. If the legends were true, he technically didn’t even
with curiosity, he'd back off if John asked him to. Because he had been alone for a very long time, and had secrets of his own, and the truth was he didn't want to lose the strange and wonderful relationship he had with the man. John didn't judge.
Daniel cussed again, obviously stressed. For a moment Conrad thought that the all-powerful leader had finally realized that there
There was a great deal of old magic within Sherlock's family, the likes of which he was to someday inherit when he came into his princely duties. However, the youngest Holmes had always been an exceptionally gifted, if not slightly unpredictable student. He listened and observed more than many fully grown adults of his kind did, and not just to the living. No. The pup could hear the waves, he knew its sweet lyrics and how it longed to meet the shore and yet could never quite grasp it. He spoke to dolphins and learned their chittering cries, and taught himself their language so he could learn how to swim amongst their ranks. Sherlock knew to listen to every stone and every shell he met, cupping them to his ear and running his hands along their smooth and jagged surfaces. He knew to read their stories, as clear as an old woman's salt-brined voice if one only knew what they were hearing, and he knew that there was power within himself.
at him, dressed as he was. Poor clothes, dilapidated hand-me downs. Patched up. The seventeen year-old allowed himself a small grimace, gazing at his reflection bitterly as he sighed through his teeth. He knew it wasn't anyone's fault, the harvest the past couple of years had been depressing at best. It wasn't anyone's
The second time John noticed was when he found the needles. Of course, needles weren't exactly uncommon in Baker street, John being an army doctor and Sherlock being, well, Sherlock. However John was always wary of finding syringes in hidden places, because if the detective was going out of his way to hide them chances were they were going to have at one point at least held illegal chemicals. When John found them, under the bathroom sink in a
was, they were someone very close and important to them. However his thoughts of the matter were cut off as the nurse let out a tiny shriek, flinching as the Dragon abruptly stood on his feet and made as if to bolt from the tent (presumably to hunt for his kin). John barely thought before he reached out a mental link, standing in the Dragon's way to keep him from departure even as he wrestled to soothe the creature's unease.
He could afford to indulge, to play a little bit. Just a taste after all. Mycroft would overlook it if he hunted on the pod's territory, provided he didn't actually
His deductions cut off as his new room-mate rose to his feet, form tall but solid as he reached out a strong hand in greeting. His smile had a charming sort of quality, as did the liquid brown of his eyes and the soft waves of his dark brown hair. A smattering of freckles scrunched across his nose with his grin. He held out his hand easily, exuding a mellow sort of confidence that shone like sunlight as in accented English he introduced himself.
The egg lay between them, shattered much like how they felt, neither one of them willing to move from the living-room floor.
The Water-Spirit placed his hand over John’s lips before he could say something else that would damn him further, fingers smoothing over the young man’s cheek and wiping away the tears that were born from exhaustion and a loss of hope.
, and that when he comes back there'll be no way of knowing exactly where he is. Then the blackness overtakes him, and John Watson is no longer John Watson.
It was two days before they were expected to be posted that Sherlock's wings finally looked healthy enough to fly. John woke that morning to hear the great, sweeping noises of Sherlock stretching the leathery appendages in and out experimentally, the thin membrane between each outline of the structure glowing a blazing blue in the morning sun. He stood in the living room, gazing pensively outside. There was a restless energy within the Dragon, a contained and restrained hyperactivity. Both John and Sherlock had been skirting about this day, knowing it would happen soon. The oil had done a good job of healing the Dragon's wing, the only visible remnant the pale silver scar. His powerful wing muscles were still weak, yet hadn't atrophied during the creature's forced grounding. This was in part because Sherlock remained fairly active whilst in captivity, and partly due to the fact (as Sherlock explained in a bored tone of voice) that during the summer Northern Dragons “
Either way, it was supremely gratifying, and Sherlock’s body ached a bit in response. The detective nipped then at John’s lips one last time before ducking lower, finding the man’s neck and making him squirm.
Sherlock absorbed all of this within a heartbeat, hardly daring to blink or move. His eye itched, but he dared not close it. Not when there was a potential threat before him. Slowly, he bared his teeth.
“You have your mother’s flame, but I’m pleased to say admittedly, my sister’s kindness, lurking in you. Something of her nature.” His hands reached out then, tipping Sherlock’s chin upwards so the light caught in the teen’s eyes, held it. Arthur smiled. “Don’t let your mother kill that kindness, no matter who you turn out to want to be in the future. Your mother forgets often now- what it’s like to feel
She smiled, and though it was a bit watery, John found himself returning it. With one last pat to his arm, Mrs Hudson turned to go. Her parting words were not unkind.
Now no more than a footstep away the man spat, spittle hitting Claude's knee as she whimpered and sobbed. She was begging them, feeling her control slipping. Like a rabid dog
“Sounds cool!” he said. Mycroft silently huffed a sigh of relief. He didn’t expect the arm that wrapped around his shoulder, but wasn’t exactly arguing as Greg waved for him to lead the way.
For the more the army doctor found out, the more he found it a miracle at all that Sherlock decided to try and trust again.
Molly had married a sweet man named Paul a few years back, and Xavier was four, an age that seemed worlds more mature in Elena's eyes than her own. As a result, she was at first hesitant to play with the slightly older boy, feet shuffling in uncharacteristic shyness as she hid behind Aunt Molly's leg, more used to her presence (due to visits in the morgue) than that of her child's. Xavier, for his part, seemed much like Molly herself- uncertain, timid, and prone to crying jags.
air leave the doctor's lungs and leave him gasping. Still Sherlock did not let go, clinging to the man until their wildly fluctuating hearts synced together as one.
That was when Sherlock's mind jolted forward, and his breath caught in his throat for a second in panic.
“Listen to me, and listen good Sherlock.” John said firmly, his gaze like starlight, bright and open and guiding.
test as well, with flying colours I might add.” Dodge smoothly interrupted John's rant before he could gain momentum for a full storm. “I organise different tests for each of my assigned teams, based on what I believe they needed most when originally paired to their Dragons.” She fixed John with a piercing stare and pointed at Sherlock, her voice authoritative and fierce.
He felt rather than saw Greg at his side, the Dragon’s heat a boiler compared to the weather around them. It was snowing, a light flurry that left white flakes in Mycroft’s hair and eyelashes. He didn’t want to look at Greg, worried what he might see. Instead he settled for staring out from on top of the mountain, gazing into the dark beyond that at night seemed to stretch endlessly. Though Mycroft couldn’t seem to find the right words, Greg didn’t seem to mind. His brown eyes were wide as he took in the view, his breathing picking up a notch as together they approached the edge of the cliff, peering down into the yawning abyss.
Daniel growled in his ear, the blonde man twitching and snarling in response as he curled his knees up to his chest. The bed was soft, but it made his skin itch. He shouldn't be here, he was a bomb ready to go off in a cottage tea party. He was used to deserts and battles and fists flying through the air. Alcohol bottles and knives were common place for him, not this soft expanse of tangled quilt and cotton.
John.” Sherlock looked supremely uncomfortable with the outburst of emotion, but there was also a vulnerability in his posture. He was still listening to what John had to say, not just placating him. “Technically, it is
Throwing his head back, the Selkie let out a pained whine, fever running through him, pink hives spreading out across his exposed skin like open sores.
It took the young man a second to realise that he didn't own wind-chimes, and that even if he had, they wouldn't be hanging beside gossamer curtains, tugging gently in the breeze on golden curtain rods. It took John a hair's breadth to realise that he was not home.
Sherlock slammed his hands down on the table, the noise startlingly loud in the silence of night. For a moment neither he nor John moved as they both froze, listening for hint that they had woken up their son on the floor above them. However, when no evidence came, the detective hissed through his teeth and made as if to hit the table again.  His eyes were hard with rage. John stopped him just in time, stepping forward and saving the table from further abuse with a firm grab towards his husband's bicep.
As he rolled down the window, he could already taste it. The salty brine of sea air that signalled their approach to Lispole, Ireland. In the distance, lush green hills rolled on for miles, the grass dotted with wild flowers in the height of their bloom. John inhaled their scent deeply, eyes fluttering closed as the heady perfume mingled with the coarse smell of the sea. If he strained, he could hear just under the beaten tape playing from the radio the faint crash of waves striking rock, the rhythmic pounding pulsing like a heartbeat and mingling with the last strains of
And John, unsure of what was dream and what was real, found himself nodding. Even as a pang of sadness ripped through his chest, what was he to do?
behind them, wanting to make sure just in case that if anything happened to him, the Monster couldn't get out and do anyone harm. Then he swiped his thumb against the inside of his wrist, noticing blankly his racing pulse and the way his blood was singing in his veins. He was sure the beast could probably hear it, and probably smell his fear.
Now that the creature seemed to have settled, John could see it for what it was without fear lacing his vision. And he gaped, because he knew in that moment that he had not been expecting to care for something like this
John blinked as Sherlock coiled over the cake like he was guarding a precious treasure, scales flashing a protective gold like the colour of sun-blasted sand. The rumbling edges of a low growl of approval bubbled from the creature's chest, sounding like the revving of a pickup truck with the close proximity between them. The soldier had to clamp down on the familiar beginnings of fear prickling along his spine, telling himself firmly that Sherlock was not actively being a threat. He was just defending what he perceived as his, nothing more. There was nothing to be scared of so long as he didn't try and take his cake from him. Like a crooked spinning tea cup, he struggled to keep his thoughts from whirling out into the realm of dead panic when Sherlock's lips peeled back to bare inhumanely pointed teeth.
The silence in the flat was something oppressive and heavy. Like a lead blanket draped over the very furniture of
“But you know, I don't put out without someone buying me a drink first. So treat this as pay-as-you-go.”
John caught a flicker, just the barest glimpse of blue. He felt his heart drop into his stomach. Gems could generally hold their more humanistic form. Yet...
“He can wait a mo’ I think. Probably gets no action out of you anyway, Stamford’s too much of a wuss to demand something. No. Bet you’re good in bed too, read your file. Used to be part of the pleasure clubs? Learned a thing or two I bet…” His left hand touched her face then, and with Molly’s flinch Sherlock found himself moving. It was with lightning-quick movement that the Dragon lunged, grabbing Wilkes’ wrist and twisting it savagely behind his back. The man yelped, the sound turning into a shriek of pain as the Dragon leaned into the hold, forcing Wilkes to drop his remote. Sherlock looked at Molly even as he did so, his voice harsh and snarling in Dragon-Tongue, eyes blazing wildly.
Another was a White Card, but John crouched in front of his cage curiously anyway. A Chinese from the look of the Dark hair and the fact that he bore no wings but webbed hands as he looked at John with suspicion and fear. His scales were a jade green, and had delicate whorl-like patters that crawled up his cheeks and lined his eyes with silver. His irises were a beautiful, sinking gold. However John could see the delicateness in them and moved away from him too, unable and unwilling to bring something so fragile into a War-Zone.
Especially when John was interested as well, and he found to his amusement that picturing the dark-haired detective naked and wanting sent a deep shudder through almost all of the Alter's bodies. It was an indescribable shiver, and in that moment Daniel forcefully made Claude tune out.
felt as if it was curling from the rushing in his head, and he swayed in place for a moment as a litany of
He tried not to dwell on it, while he was in the hospital. Instead, John turned his attention instead to their host. He was curious as to what their anonymous benefactor wanted from them, and when he would come to collect.
The Selkie to be fair had mostly recognised John because of the bondbite on his wrist. Like a song it had called to him, forced his instincts into a frenzy, led him to nearly drowning the Human in his desperation to ensure that no one separate him from his long-lost Mate. This man shivering before him, strange clothes sopping wet and hanging heavily on his thin form was not the boy that Sherlock had bitten so many moons ago, and it showed in the depths of the shadows under his eyes, in the way his left hand trembled and his leg limped. The man before him eyed Sherlock as if he were some kind of demon, and he kept repeating a string of words, the likes of which the Selkie could now translate, having hunted enough Humans to recognise the sound of distress.
Another crack of thunder, and this one was filled with a terrible finality. The Water-Spirit spun on his heel, stalking towards the door. His entire posture screamed an end to the conversation, bellowing for Molly to escort his ‘ignorant clod of a brother’ and his betrothed, respectively either out of his temple or to his rooms. The small, mouse-haired servant squeaked past the Spirit while he stalked angrily out, her brown eyes wide with despair as she looked at the pair, now sitting at a meal that had gone mostly cold.
Sorry about that.... It took a while longer than I would have liked to get back on my feet... expect an update next for Free Falling and  Fade to Black as they are long overdue :)
Thoughts of a nice quiet morning dissipated like soap bubbles as he saw that the moon hung outside, silvery and heavy in the night sky. Its light painted its way across his face, past the door where a shadow stood quietly, likely the source of John’s awakening. Sherlock was dressed in the hand-me-downs that John had managed to scavenge for him; a blue jumper that was too short at the sleeves but too wide in the middle and light blue jeans. Those pale eyes seemed to glow nocturnally in the dark, and a rumbling voice echoed lightly, singing a lilting verse that ended in question.
That seemed to seal the deal. Carefully making sure to not look quite so terrifying, Sherlock fixed his gaze on the shivering creature before him, hesitantly considering his options. Well... it worked with seduction… perhaps…
“I'd trust him with my life. He's the sort of creature that's very much all or nothing in nature, and it seems he's decided I'm lucky enough to be considered an ally. He'd protect me, and I'd protect him.”
In fact, the Dragon was quiet for most of the evening, speaking only in John's thoughts when the man's hands trembled minutely on his soup spoon, and he couldn't seem to keep his eyes open a second more. John found Sherlock's voice strangely gentle as he murmured
“Who-Who are you?” Irene spat. Though she’d never had much faith in Gods or spirits, her childhood stories were coming back to her now. Had she not been terrified half out of her mind, she might find her jump to faith ironic.
“What happened between you two? You don’t agree with Sherlock’s choice obviously. All of this. You don’t… see him as your brother-”
The Northern Dragon's scales were red with fury, brilliant scarlet even as he spat ice venomously at the enemy beneath him. The tone of them almost matched the strange Dragon's scales, a dark mahogany likening to almost dried blood. Sherlock barely noticed how the heat from the other Dragon was causing his soft underbelly to burn, his fury numbing the pain so that he could overpower her, pin her in place. Keep her from hurting John. His growl came shivering out of him like trembling thunder, and even if his Master couldn't understand Dragon-Tongue, John didn't mistake the thought that rippled through the chaotic bells overlapping his telepathic bond.
his power, all of it, I’m going to be brutally honest with you- he’d have it by now.” Greg leaned forward, pouring himself another cup of tea. “What I’m saying is, maybe your relationship with Sherlock is healthier as it is now, then as it would be if he were a God.”
to stand up for him, hadn't been able to afford such thinking ever since he'd wheedled money for hormones out of the Holmes family name and gallivanted off. Yet even so, Victor was a real and solid presence, and the like of it was like looking directly into a blazing inferno. Completely unprepared, Sherlock felt rather blinded.
She said the last bit with earnesty, hands reaching out to clasp John’s in her own. The soldier could feel Morstan’s warmth, read the honesty in her body language.
They were both on the floor. Hadn't moved. John's throat felt raw. Terrible as if he had been screaming.
Sherlock; for his part, felt his orgasm rush to meet him like a freight train. He was rising to the edge, and then he was suddenly plummeting into a wall of pleasure. He arched, back bowing, and he must have made some kind of noise because John
Mrs Hudson nodded sagely, as if she suspected as much. Her weathered hands gathered together to clasp towards her chest, and her voice was decidedly lower as she murmured
So, thank you for all the lovely comments and kudos this piece has received :3 I hope I can continue to impress! Many thanks as always to my fantastic beta
As it was, Claude seemed to take no issue in heartily greeting the detective, moving from the chair to throw her arms around Sherlock like an
Except his dreams had never let the feeling of water filling his mouth feel so real, nor had the pressure of hands wrapped around his chest been so forceful and unyielding. In the dark of night, a set of eyes glowed like blue fire, and John found himself tucked against a marble-white chest even as a voice that rumbled like a hurricane snarled its claim over him.
The detective was startled out of his reverie, looking at John in apparent confusion as he asked slowly “Why would you ask that?”
Something about that sentence sounded passive aggressive to John, but he didn’t have much time to reflect upon it. Lestrade merely winced, allowing the comment to hit its mark without retaliation. He continued with his proposal, his gaze earnest.
He wondered what John was dreaming of, and hoped that it was not a nightmare in which he played the main villain.
“I’m… I’m told that you lot can be… rough. In all of this, I mean. That, is, brutal. You take what you want, and that’s
When Sherlock had been little, Mycroft had largely been the one to care for him. In Selkie culture, one’s parents were not necessarily one’s sole caretaker, and often the duty of caring for the children were left to the older youths, while adults were off during migrations hunting for food or a safe beach to rest on. As a result, the Selkie found that he knew the hands that touched him instinctively, the softness of the pads revealing a lifestyle different from his own but so very familiar.
caused something to jump in the creature's heart, and without being aware of it, Sherlock found himself leaning closer.
kids, verbally anyway. I didn't stay long there. Too many things happened. I was destructive to both myself and others, and turned into a bit of a loaded bomb. Jumped at the smallest noise, started crying for no reason. Waking up from night terrors only to find myself standing in rooms that were not my bed. I became difficult to place because of my track record.”
John frowned, wondering about the inordinate reaction. Cautiously, he attempted to glean the reason for Sherlock’s distress.
The Water-Spirit seemed for a moment taken-aback at the Human’s outburst, but his features rapidly reassembled themselves into indignation.
“Someone loves you.” Irene cooed down at the Sherlock, and John closed his eyes for a moment in pain because in a moment, his cards had been read. Luckily, the detective seemed far too thrown off by the entire situation to much notice. His blue eyes darted from Irene’s face and away, and he looked strangely young and uncertain even as the Woman pulled the white card from around his neck, placing it between her teeth with a snarl.
A hand came to rest on John's shoulder, the boy flinching away with a startled cry only to find Harry's sweaty palm clamped over his mouth. Her eyes were bright in the shadow of the dark, filled with a kind of grim sadness as she leaned down and tried to bodily tug her little brother away from the foot of the stairs. Her voice was breathy and softer than he had ever heard it before, right by his ear.
Not when the very weather threatened to break the walls of the cabin, its ancient wood creaking and screaming in protest. Not when his mother was trembling like a leaf, and his father wore an expression like he had just been punched in the stomach.
And then, because Sherlock was still studying him intensely, John tentatively brought his arm that wasn't captured in front of the creature's face. He snapped wetly, the sound of his thumb and finger clicking causing the Selkie to jump, unintentionally grinding down against the man's hips. John ignored the flash of warmth that hummed through his spine as he murmured in half amazement, half terror, “God… you're actually real…”
John found himself hard in his uniform, a steadily crawling blush making its way along the back of his neck, even as he struggled to dislodge Sherlock from his current position. A voice in the back of the soldier’s mind screamed the wrongness of this act, given John’s position of power over Sherlock in most situations, as well as the fleeting dirtiness of it. There was something illicit in being so aroused even while completely clothed, Sherlock’s burning blue eyes only meeting John’s in the pause of breath before the Dragon shifted to the other side of John’s neck, scenting him and rubbing against him like a great cat in heat. Except this was not the amorous affections of lovemaking, no. Sherlock was all but rutting against John, claiming him in an act of dominance that was both out of character and somewhat unsettling.
Though Mike's Mother had long passed (sickness, there had been a coughing disease one winter that took many people) her legacy it appeared had lived on. When Mike had attended her funeral, he had discovered that his Mum had kept more money than he knew tucked away for him.
"i got in." john said with a smile. "it's the nursing program, but i'll have to do four years there because i haven't started my nursing classes yet."
"so this is just pay back?" sherlock scoffed, shaking his head as he got up. "i never thought you could be this low." sherlock walked to the front door, pulling his shoes on as anger started boiling inside him. he was viewed as some tool to john apparently. showed how much he cared.
"come on, baby," sherlock hummed. "start riding it then you can have my cock." he let his cock go, letting it hang there, a few centimeters away from the doctor's lips.
Sherlock stood in the doorway, watching his father walk around the garden with his son. The pit feeling went away and he finally calmed his nerves, knowing there was nothing else to worry about. His parents love Ben. His parents love him and John.
“Sherlock Holmes, the heartless consulting detective,” John said as he snaked an arm around his husband’s waist, “Is an absolute softie when it comes to his son.”
john giggled and smirked, pulling a long, slow tug, admiring the way sherlock's face looked and the way he moaned his name. "you're cock is so perfect," john hummed, "nice and long. not too thick, but just enough for me. i want you to stuff this perfect cock up my ass. i want you to fuck me, sherlock." his thumb pressed to the tip of his cock and sherlock thrusted into his hand some. "can you do that for me? can you fuck me?"
Sylvia turned to the couple, tears streaming down her cheeks and a smile resting on her face. “He’s really our grandson?”
that's your problem for choosing the same school your boyfriend goes to. sherlock even told him not to, but john insisted that he really wanted to and not because it's where james went. "did you get in?" sherlock asked. "that's a private university."
when sherlock was checking out, he got odd stares from the woman behind the register. it was a small town and everyone knew everyone. god knows some one would tell his mother that he was seen buying condoms and lube new year's eve. he was handed his bag and sherlock fled out, not wasting anytime to get to his father's truck. the snow had picked up and there was a thin layer on the road, but he just drove slower. thank god his father let him use his truck because there was no way his car would've been able to make it.
sherlock smiled, leaning down and kissing john as he pulled out slowly, pushing back in slowly. john moaned into his mouth, his hand finding their way into the curls, gripping them as sherlock kept up with his rhythm, slowly starting to pick up the pace.
sherlock sat on the bed so the backs of his knees were touching the bed. "sit in my lap. now." he growled softly.
it was christmas eve. sherlock helped his mother set up the dining room table, carrying out plates and baskets of yeast rolls. he kept himself confined in the kitchen and dining room, staying away from john. it was always a tradition to eat together. they were like one big family and every year they switched what house they would eat at and this year it was the holmeses.
john chugged his water before taking a second to catch his breath. "thanks." he panted. he turned his head, setting his bottle to the side and his attention going to sherlock that was staring down at his body with flushed cheeks. john smirked and sat up, scooting closer to sherlock as he snakes his legs around his waist.
john grabbed the base of the toy and sat down on it slowly, letting out a low moan. he sat completely on it, looking up at sherlock with his lips parted and eyes droopy.
sherlock stepped out of the shower, grabbing his towel off the hook then wrapping it around his hips. he took a minute to collect himself, getting the thoughts of his friend out of his head. "stupid, stupid, stupid," sherlock muttered as he picked up his clothes off the floor, putting them in the laundry basket before going back to his room.
john placed his hands on sherlock's knees, lifting himself up then going back down, starting a slow pace, soft noises escaping his lips. he kept eye contact with the detective, watching his eyes become darker as his hands slid down his thighs. "can i have it?" john asked, licking his lips.
john nodded, fixing his grip on the handle before starting. he watched sherlock's eyes in the mirror flick from his posture down to his ass and he smirked, deciding to give sherlock a small show.
Sherlock walked to the rocking chair that sat in the corner, taking a seat as he rocked back and forth softly, watching his son’s eyes flutter close, falling asleep shortly after. Sherlock stayed in the position, knowing if he put his son back in his crib he would just wake up again. As he rocked, he thought about how his parents would react on Friday when they meet their grandson Sherlock never told them about.
sherlock pulled back, thrusting back into john, creating a slow, teasing rhythm which had john on the edge, but he knew sherlock was nervous.
then those soft lips were against his again. and sherlock couldn't resist. he kissed back, lifting a hand to cup the side of his friend's face, finally getting to know what the warm skin felt like against his hand. how his cheek fit perfectly into the palm of his hand. he should pull away. he really should. but john made the first move. but sherlock should've pulled away the first time.
the cold stung sherlock's face as he walked out of the restaurant, walking around the building to where he parked his car, getting in. he put the styrofoam box in the passenger seat then started the car, turning the heat up. he looked out the passenger side window and saw john sitting in his mother's suv, so frustrated he was almost in tears. a part of sherlock wanted to get out and go and comfort his friend, but the other part just wanted to let him deal with it and drive away.
john pulled his knees to his chest, holding himself as he put his knees between his head. "james cheated on me."
"almost two hours!" john whined out. he looked for something to grab, but there was nothing so he leaned forward, letting himself get fucked as he clenched the bedsheets. "yes! yes!" he shouted as sherlock's cock hit his prostate.
sherlock groaned, praying that he could last, but he couldn't. "john!" he moaned, giving one last thrust before filling the rugby captain.
once the dinner plates were cleared, mrs. holmes and mrs. watson brought out the numerous deserts they had made. there was pie, peanut butter balls, peanut butter fudge, assortment of cookies. anything you craved was on the table.
“Oh, we’re doing well. Just got back from the shops. They finally got the farmers market back open, I was so excited. Got so many great things.”
sherlock felt his ears get hot. he looked down at his glass of water only having enough sense to say, "sorry."
"can i get the turkey club then a later order for a double cheeseburger with onions and mayo?" sherlock asked.
sherlock kneeled onto the bed, getting in between john's thighs, leaning over and kissing him. he let his hips relax, his clothed cock rubbing against john's, causing a soft noise escape the blond's throat. sherlock needed to hear it again, louder, so he grinded against the boy underneath him, earning a louder moan and he pulled away from the kiss, pressing his thumb to the bottom of john's chin and pushing his head up, kissing his neck. john's legs locked around his hips as he did that, pulling him flush against him again.
They made their way downstairs and into the kitchen, John instantly went for the display of sweets on the table, shoving a lemon bar into his mouth.
"you don't need to study, so i'm going to go home." sherlock zipped his bag shut and stood, slinging it over his shoulder. "i'm not going to waste my friday night, john."
sherlock stopped and looked at his plate, seeing that he completely mushed his meatloaf and decided he wasn't hungry anymore. he pushed the plate away slightly, feeling like the meatloaf was his heart and the fork was every time he saw or revived a text from john.
"i'm not gonna tell your parents because they're under enough stress about about brother not coming home. i'm letting you off with a warning. but, you have to go back home and calm down." he handed sherlock his car registration and license back.
sherlock frowned, rubbing his face at the memories. "god, i remember working my ass off all summer to pay for some of the remodeling." he looked at his friend who was smiling at him. "but, that doesn't beat when you fell through the bass drum at one of the football games."
"your parents don't drink vodka." sherlock looked over at the blond who sat on the floor in front of a cupboard.
he didn't realize that he was speeding until the blue lights appeared behind him. he pulled to the side of the road, putting his car in park as he reached over to his glove department, taking out the registration for his car. he looked into his side mirror to see the officer walking to his car and it wasn't just a regular officer, it was his uncle. he sighed and rolled down his window, smiling.
sherlock moved john's hand away from the toy and pulled it out, pushing it back into the doctor. "of course you did. you're a fucking cock slut."
sherlock jerked roughly, grabbing the bed sheets and arching his back as he let out a moan, not being able to control his release and letting his load out in john's mouth.
sherlock nodded. "how do think everyone would feel if i came out during dessert?" he asked, careful his father didn't hear.
over the past few weeks, john just wanted sex and not that sherlock was complaining about it, but he was starting to get sore. even when sherlock let him sit in his lap. that boy was fucking machine and sherlock was starting to feel like he couldn't get hard any more because john completely milked him out. they at least had sex three times a day, but sherlock hadn't heard anything from john at all one day and started to get worried.
John walked in first, giving a reassuring smile before standing next to Sherlock as his parents walked in, his mother freezing at the sight of her son holding a baby.
sherlock grinned and thought for a second, rolling his hips down onto the boy as he felt himself grow hard. "i want you to stuff yourself from both ends." sherlock said into john's ear. "i want you fucking your self on this dildo as you suck my cock." he said as he trailed his fingers down the boy's body, running over his cock then slipping right into him. "just swallowed them right up." he said with a smirk, thinking about how quick john could swallow his cock. how wet and open he'd feel. sherlock let out a soft moan and rutted his hips against john a last time before getting off the bed.
sherlock gasped at the cool liquid against his cock, but pushed into it, thrusting into the fist of the rugby captain.
"it's alright." sherlock said. the fight was about john going out to lunch with sherlock. he knew it just by the way john checked his phone once he sat down, clearing the text he had received then set his phone on his coat. "i didn't know if you wanted sweet tea or coffee, so i didn't order a drink for you." sherlock said.
"it's your decision. not mine." rudy said, patting shelrock's forearm. he turned and took the dish of green beans that was being passed down.
sherlock panted as he looked down at the doctor, watching him rest his head on his thigh as a bead of come slowly ran down his chin. he reached his hand down to john's chin, swiping the come off his chin, taken by surprise when john took sherlock's thumb in his mouth, swirling his tongue around the digit, making sure he got every bit of sherlock in him.
"listen here, idiot," john said strongly, "james was a liar and a cheater. i'd never go near him again. ever. okay?" he asked, watching sherlock nod. "you are the one for me, sherlock holmes. it's taken me years to realize it, but it's true. i promise that, okay? i love you, ya goon."
"sorry doesn't work, sherlock!" john sighed, calming himself before reaching across the table and choking out his friend. "it was a real dick of a move. especially ignoring me every time i brought it up."
john attempted to say something, but all that came out was a moan. he squeezed his eyes shut and held back his orgasm. "yes! i feel used like the dirty cock slut i am!" he bit down on his lip, hard. "can i come?" he begged.
john came hard, his hips thrusting into the detective's and as it milked him out. he brought himself back up, panting heavily as he put a stop to sherlock's motions. he got out of sherlock's lap and onto his knees, watching the detective's eyes roll into the back of his head as he took his cock into his mouth, instantly swallowing it down. he felt sherlock tense up under him, shouting as his hips jerked into john's mouth, causing him to gag.
“Yea.” John turned back to the boy. “You’re daddy is starving,” he said as he walked into the kitchen. “Are you hungry?” he asked playfully. “Is Ben a hungry boy?”
john nodded. "he went to a bar last night. but he didn't tell me." he shook his head. "it's whatever, but he's really been pissing me off."
sherlock went over to the love seat, standing in front of john. he grabbed his wrists and pulled him up, wrapping his arms around his friend and hugging him. "let it out." he rubbed john's back. "it's okay."
john was sitting on the bed, watching sherlock with a smile. "hey, you," he stood up, "why that face?"
sherlock threw his book bag off to the side and took a seat on john's bed, watching the rugby captain take a seat next to him.
"it's good," sherlock nodded, "cold as hell, but it's good." he cleared his throat, wanting this small talk awkwardness to vanish. "and how's uva?"
"i like the sound of that." sherlock smirked and leaned in for another kiss, knowing exactly what he was doing now.
sherlock turned to the door, placing a hand on the knob, but he couldn't push himself to open it. he couldn't leave john alone. he was his friend and lately he's been a shitty on. "i need to know what that kiss was." he turned around again. "was it because you like me or to get back at sholto?"
john sat up and grabbed his toy, standing up then dropping onto his knees in front of the bed. his eyes flicked down to sherlock's groin, seeing the imprint of his hard on then watched sherlock's hand run over it.
"you're a major cunt sometimes, ya know that?" john asked. he took a second to take a swig of his coffee. "but you're my best friend and i haven't seen you in months so i'll drop the topic."
sherlock sat up, hitting the chat bubble and typing in an excuse that he was about to get in the shower. a shower actually sounded nice right now. he was all sticky and gross from the flight and normally a shower relaxed him when he was stressed.
"fuck," sherlock moaned, tilting his head back as john's tongue run up the underside of his cock then around the tip. he sucked in a sharp breath and bit the back of his hand as the warm heat of john's mouth engulfed him. shelrock's head flicked over to the mirror and he watched their reflections. watched his cock disappear in the boy's mouth. he wanted to fuck john and watch himself do it in the mirror right beside him.
"no it's fine, i like it." john pressed his foot against sherlock's hip. "i like seeing you drool over the way my ass looks. i can see your boner even if you desperately try to hide it."
Sherlock and John went to the backdoor, looking out it and seeing Harold holding his grandson, showing him the various flowers and plants that grew in the garden. He picked a pink flower and handed it to Ben, smiling at his grandson who put the flower in his face. Harold turned towards the house and smiled at the couple watching him, taking Ben’s hand and making him wave.
sherlock shrugged then set the bag down on his desk. "it's nothing." the soft hand pressed against his cheek and his eyes met with the blue ones of his boyfriend.
“almost...” sherlock groaned, giving a few more powerful thrusts before coming deep inside the boy. he gave a few more pleasure thrusts, hearing the boy sigh and giggle softly before he pulled out.
john nodded. he walked over to the weight rack and pulled off the ten pound kettlebell. "are you going to train me or not?" he asked over his shoulder.
john pulled off, replacing his mouth with his hand. his other hand fell to his crotch, taking ahold of his neglected cock and pumping it, matching the rhythm of how he was doing it to sherlock. he quickened the pace of his bouncing, feeling the toy brush against his prostate and he moaned. "take a picture. take as many as you want."
"sherlock, get the pie from the oven, will you?" mrs. holmes asked her son as she carried the ham out to the dining room.
"perhaps." sherlock said then pecked john's lips. "it's coming down out there. might get snowed in."
john nodded, slowly pulling off the toy before scrambling to get in sherlock's lap. he leaned down and kissed the detective roughly as he reached under him, grabbing the cock of man, lining it up before sinking down, the member slipping right into him.
“And that’s alright. Your parents will be understanding of that, they’re used to you not telling them things. Just like us dating, or our engagement.”
john bit his lip, watching the brunet above him as he closed his eyes and moved his hips. he knew what he was thinking about and he couldn't wait to fulfill the fantasy.
sherlock smiled, taking john's hand and kissing the palm before kissing him lovingly on the lips. "i love you."
john was throbbing in his shorts, curling his toes as he felt sherlock's hot breath against him and the hands on his thighs were just driving him insane. "please, sherlock!" he whined, bucking his hips up.
"i say we go for another around. ruffle his feather a bit more." john suggest, running a hand through the tangled curls.
john laughed and took the bottle back, screwing the cap back onto it before putting it all the way in the back of the cupboard where it belonged. "some whiskey?" he asked his friend, looking at the labels of the bottles.
sherlock shrugged. "not sure." he stood up with his plate, going to dump his mashed meatloaf in the trash.
it's been about ten months for john and sholto. ever since john went to tour the university of virginia campus and got hit on by a guy in the library. john came home and went to sherlock, going on and on about the guy in the library and all sherlock could do was sit there and listen. no matter how bad he wanted to tell his best friend he was in love with him. then the rest of their senior year, john was always on his phone texting sholto or asking sherlock on weekends if he could meet sholto halfway so they could go out to dinner while sherlock sat in his car and tried not to cry. during the summer, sherlock spent time away from john, drowning himself in work to ignore his friend. it worked too. sherlock was able to leave for school without saying a long goodbye to john and he hated that, but it was for the best. sherlock didn't want to see him. every time he saw him his heart broke a little more.
sherlock sighed as he rolled his window up. that was a start. and of course his uncle was open about it, he was also gay. he tucked his license back into his wallet and put his registration away before driving again. he turned around at the next intersection, heading east this time. he was feeling a bit better. getting what was causing him the most pressure off his chest gave him some relief. but now he had to come out to his parents. and the rest of his family.
Sherlock took him, lifting him up in the air playfully before pressing a kiss to his cheek and holding him. Ben giggled, jabbering nonsense.
sherlock laughed, the rest of the room laughing with him. his father stood and gave him a hug, patting him on the back. he pulled away, a smile still plastered on his face. "proud of ya. takes a lot of guts to come out. some i may never have."
sherlock smiled to himself as he felt john's breathing slow down and his body relax against his. this is all he's ever wanted and hopefully it will last because this is great. he was in love with the man he's always wanted.
sherlock walked back to his bed, getting in beside the blond, pulling the sheets over them and getting settled before he answered. "that we stay together. yours?"
"stuff that includes your not twin bed anymore?" john wrapped his arms around sherlock's neck, inching closer to his face.
john unscrewed the cap and took a riff, gagging. "oh my god." he coughed, holding it out. "smell it."
"we need to get down there." sherlock gently traced john's cheek bone with his thumb, admiring the way the tanned skin looked against his pale tone.
sherlock became a red as a tomato. he pushed up his glasses and cleared his throat. "that's very irrelevant at the moment."
sherlock sat in the desk chair that belonged to the rugby captain, looking over his notes as he spun left and right in the chair.
sherlock watched the boy's face as he wrapped his hand around his cock, giving himself a long, slow pull. he bit his lip and moaned. "i'm going to watch you fuck yourself on that dildo as you suck my cock. then as you're doing that, i'm going to come on your face when we're done. i'm going to watch you lick it up like the dirty cock slut you are." sherlock said and pressed his thumb to the tip, letting out another moan. he bent over and took the toy from the boy, placing it between his legs. "get on."
"you've been hiding a treasure, sherlock." john lowered himself down the body until his chin bumped the head of the leaking cock, leaving a spot on his chin that john didn't care about. all he cared about was getting sherlock to shove his prick up his arse if he was even ready for it.
john nodded. "c'mere." he pulled sherlock on top of him. "i know you sherlock. i know how you watch me. when i come home from practice i can feel your eyes on me as i change and i can tell when the color in your cheeks change, even if you think i can't." he reached over to his night stand, grabbing a small bottle.
"do you want my cock in your mouth?" sherlock asked as he undid his trouser. "slipping down your throat," he said as he cock popped out of his boxers, "as you choke on it."
“No, we don’t eat our hands silly.” John took Ben’s fist out of his mouth, placing him in his high chair. “What do we have for him tonight?” John asked as he went to the kitchen drawer where they kept the bibs.
"why do care?" john sniffled. "you left me. james left me." he looked up at sherlock. "my mother couldn't listen to me rant because she was too busy. too busy to listen to her own fucking son." he looked into his lap again. "i don't even know why i try anymore. james is ignoring me and you're out here, happy and carefree. and i thought people were my friends, but once i went to them with my problems, they ignored me." he started crying.
"god, you're such an idiot." sherlock laughed at himself. he had the nerve to just drive back to school. he had his phone and his wallet. he'd be fine.
“fucking cock slut.” sherlock muttered, thrusting back into the boy, watching his cock slip in and out of him. “eating me right up.” he quickened his pace.
it wasn't until quarter after noon when john showed up. he saw sherlock sitting at the booth and went to him, removing his coat then sitting in the booth, looking at his friend with a smile. "sorry. james and i got into a fight."
sherlock grabbed the plate and a mug. "come on then." he hurried out to the living room, careful not to spill his drink. he set both items on the coffee table, plopping down onto the sofa.
sherlock grabbed an oven mitt, putting it on as he turned the timer on the stove off. he opened the stove, pulling out the apple pie out and setting it on the counter. he shut the oven door, taking the mitt. "do you want it out there, ma?" he shouted slightly.
john undid his belt, pulling his jeans down and kicking them off. the brunet came over and set the condom and bottle of lube on the bed, dropping his own jeans and john could see the outline of his cock. god, he's been thinking of this moment since christmas and now it was finally here and john was over the top happy.
sherlock kneeled behind john, pulling his shorts down. he leaned over the boy, ripping open the packet of lube and applying it to both of them. “now, i’m going to fuck you, john. i’m going to fuck you into the floor and watch in the mirror as i do so.” he said as he looked at them in the mirror, pushing the head of his cock into the boy.
sherlock got up and went to his suitcase, taking out his phone charger before going back to he bed and moving his nightstand out of the way, plugging his block into the wall then plugging the charger into his phone. he walked out of his bedroom, going to the linen closet and taking out a towel before going to the bathroom. his father had walked passed the bathroom, his heavy steps receding down the hall and to his bedroom.
"you never said bye to me when you left for school." john said, pulling the buried hatchet out of the ground.
"because this is too good to be true," sherlock huffed out a laugh. "i've always wanted this and now that i have it, it won't last long. like redbeard."
it was normal for friends to sit like this. right? sherlock wasn't sure. him and john never sat together like this before. ever. then those fingertips ran over his knee and hesitantly the palm rested on his knee. this was not normal. all the warnings and sirens were going off in sherlock's mind, but sherlock was frozen. he was remembering how it felt to be touched like that because it would most likely never happen again. his head turned and he looked at his friend who was looking at him.
Sherlock set his phone down on the arm of the chair, sighing deeply as he tilted his head back, closing his eyes as he tried to relax. The sound of the faint cries from the baby monitor caused Sherlock to get up, heading upstairs to John’s old bedroom that was now a nursery for their son. He opened the door softly, walking over to the crib and looking down at his son who was whining.
sherlock could see it in john's eyes. he's been crying. there were bags under his eyes and there was stubble growing. him and sholto definitely broke up. john wasn't even caring about his appearance. his button up under his sweater wasn't tucked in, his cuffs weren't buttoned in the second hole and he was picking at his nails again.
"just take your time." john said softly, watching sherlock's facial expression, his eyes closed as he was focusing on what to do next.
“My goodness,” John said as he crouched down, picking up his son. “You have gotten so big.” he held him, smiling at the toothless grin his son was giving him. “My big boy, Ben.”
sherlock pushed the toy into john in one easy motion, pulling it out quick. "you're so open." he said in amazement, looking down as he thrusted the toy into the boy again, pulling it right back out.
john moved in first, giving sherlock a chaste kiss. he pulled away and giggled softly, a smile glued onto his face.
he positioned himself between john's legs, pushing in slowly, moaning at the tight heat that swallowed him right up. he leaned over john once he was in balls deep, staying like that for a second so they both could get comfortable.
john scooted closer to sherlock, resting his head on his chest, drawing light patterns on the pale chest. "that i finally found the one." he looked up at sherlock. sherlock smiled, kissing john's forehead.
john pulled sherlock to him, kissing him deeply. "shut up. shut the fuck up." he muttered. he cupped sherlock's face, wiping his tears. "it is true and you better get used to it because i'm here for the long run and i swear to god, sherlock, if one more thing comes out of your mouth about us not being together i will hit you. and i'm not joking."
"god, mr. runyan was pissed. never seen him so hot headed before." sherlock laughed. "ms. wyciffle was horrified. oh my god i still remember her face."
Sherlock kissed each of his fists, hearing the back door close and his parents speaking. He walked backwards into the sitting area, out of the view of his parents, feeling his chest start to tighten.
sherlock smiled to himself as he watched john turn around and head up the stairs. his smile faded once john was out of view and he bent over, picking up the bag. his mind kept telling him this was a mistake. that after this would hurt him more than if he would've just stayed away. god he was stupid. sherlock toed off his shoes before heading up the steps and to his room.
John walked into the kitchen from the landing, setting the bag of takeaway on the table, shedding his coat as he walked into the living room, hanging it on the rack. He smiled at his husband who sat on the floor with their son, watching him on his back as he looked at the shapes above him that hung on his play gym, trying to reach for them.
Harold took the boy, giving him a bright smile. “Hello there, Ben. You remind me of your father at this age, are you just like him?”
after sherlock had dropped the lunch he had got his father off with him, he made his way to john's house after, receiving the text asking if he could come over. his stomach was turning as he drove to his friends house, not ready to spend time alone with him again, but he was a friend. so sherlock was entitled to it. he pulled into the drive way, sitting in his car for a few minutes before forcing himself to get out and go into what was pretty much his second childhood home. the house was about as big as his own, big and white, but the watson's didn't have a wrap around porch like his home did. he walked up the steps then to the front door, letting himself in.
john's smirk grew wider as he cupped the back of the trainer's neck, pulling him in for a kiss. sherlock kissed back for a few seconds before john pulled way, leaning back on his elbow. "i've been watching the way you look at me." he said with a smirk, watching sherlock turn red.
"is that why you didn't want me to come visit? because it was just lunch?" sholto asked over the phone.
he cleared the text from his notifications then set his phone on his chest, sinking further into his chair as he stared up at the ceiling. he was currently studying at harvard, coming home for christmas break to his small farm town in the middle of no where virginia. he didn't mind go home, but he just wanted to get away. he wanted to leave the small town and make something good out of himself that didn't have to deal with farming or his income depending on the crop season. his phone vibrated and he took it off his chest, looking down at the screen.
sherlock looked over to the other side of the table, seeing mr. and mrs. watson smiling at him. he smiled back then sat down, looking at john who got up quietly from his seat, telling his mother something before walking out of the dining room. part of sherlock told him to go after him, but the other part told him to stay seated and eat his ginger snaps. he stayed in his seat, asking for the peanut butter balls.
“Little troubled maker, huh?” Sylvia asked as she set a cup of tea in front of her son who just sat down.
a low growl came out of sherlock as he snapped his hips forward, angling his hips with each forceful thrust, watching his face for when he hit his sweet spot. and when he did, sherlock thought it was the most beautiful thing he ever witnessed.
sherlock shook himself out of his thoughts and nodded, walking over to john. "spread your legs out more and straighten out your back." he said to john, placing a hand on the small of his back as he watched john do as he says. "alright, we'll start with fifteen, but hold for a few seconds before you come up."
as sherlock pulled into his driveway, he already spotted john's truck and pulled in next to it. he grabbed the bag and headed in quickly, the snow getting heavier and the wind picking up. the front door was unlocked and when he walked in, he saw john sitting in the steps.
"just relax." john lowered himself onto his knees, his carpet digging into his soft skin, but it didn't matter. "i'm going to take care of you." john pulled down the trousers of his friend completely off, along with the pants and tossing them to the side.
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple. “No need to thank me, this is what I signed up for. Marrying a mad man.”
later the two sat soaking in the warmth of the tub. john rested against sherlock's chest, almost falling asleep because of how worn out he was.
this was all too good to be true. sherlock didn't think this was going to last long. it was probably going to end after they both went back to school when john realizes how much he misses james. that was the worst part of john. he could never really let go. he always went back to the same thing that made him unhappy, trying to find happiness with it again. it hurt sherlock just to think about it, but it was most likely going to happen. all sherlock could do now is enjoy the moment. enjoy the thing he's always wanted, but knew he couldn't have.
"yes, yes. god yes." sherlock leaned down and kissed john hard and opened mouthed, grabbing the lube. he squeezed some lube onto his fingers then pushed a single one into the blond underneath him, causing him to pull away from the kiss and moan.
sherlock put his hand on the hook where his coat was. "what?" he turned and saw john standing there, tears streaming down his face. sherlock felt his heart break.
"sherlock, that was your first blow job. i didn't expect you to last long." john climbed onto the bed, laying behind where sherlock sat.
john smirked, his hand sliding down the body of his friend until feeling the hard cock trapped in his trousers. he unbuttoned the trousers, pulling them down along with the his pants to reveal the hard cock of the brunet. it took john by surprise, seeing the long, throbbing cock that john never expected to be attached to sherlock.
"i love you." his mother said. she pulled away. "and we still love you the same. nothing will change, but we will be expecting a nice boy to come home with you next christmas."
after the squats they did body builders with the kettlebells until john got tired of them and needed a breather. once he finished, they started core. sherlock kneeled beside john and watched him do elbow to knee crunches, calling out the numbers and telling him to go faster. then sherlock made him do an excessive amount of different crunches, agreeing to letting john do a minute plank for another break.
"i think you should ignore him for a bit." sherlock stood up. "and come downstairs and we'll make hot chocolate, spike it some, then watch elf on a continuous loop until we get sick of it."
"no. i've got bigger plans with my life then working on the farm." shelrock's mind flipped back to thinking about his crush on his friend across from him. "how 'bout you?"
“sherlock!” john squeaked, coming all over shelrock’s fist. he bit his hand as sherlock continued to thrust into him, looking at them in the mirror again.
sherlock scoffed, turning back to the desk and started to collect his things, putting his notes and text book back into his bag.
"bourbon would be better." sherlock went to the fridge. he opened it, taking out the small plate of fudge that had a piece of paper with his name on it. mrs. watson had set some aside for him. he took it out, setting it on the table as he took the saran wrap off the plate, taking a square of the peanut butter fudge and popping it into his mouth, forgetting how good it was.
"so perfect." sherlock hummed, cupping john's cheek. "i just want to take a picture. can i do it, john?" he tilted his head back, letting out a loud moan as john swallowed him down. "fuck, baby."
John’s lips curled. “I haven’t heard this story.” he looked across the table at his husband who was now pouting.
sherlock chuckled. "you naughty, naughty boy." he grinned and climbed over john, letting his clothed cock press against the doctor's groin. "after this little stunt, you'll have to make it up to me." he said as he rubbed the toy at john's entrance.
the two laughed, sherlock pressing his forehead to john's chest, pressing a soft kiss to the sweat layered skin.
john stood with a bottle of bourbon, pouring a bit in the two coffee mugs that sat on the table. "save some for me." john pointed to the fudge as he put the bottle away.
john’s mouth fell open, scratching at the floor as he watched sherlock over top of him, watching his cock slip right into him. “fuck, fuck, fuck,” he panted.
sherlock nipped the skin on john's neck, receiving a small yelp. "i've dreamed of this moment." sherlock left open mouthed kisses on his skin. "all the different sounds you'd make, how you'd taste and what would make you tick." he kissed down to the sensitive pink bud on john's chest, licking a stripe over it.
"james is apologizing for the way he's been acting, but i'm still pissed about last night." john said as he started to type again. "and today for him overreacting and making me feel like a piece of shit." he sent the text then set his phone down, looking at his friend.
they ate, laughing and telling jokes as time passed. sherlock still felt his heart rate pick up a bit every time john smiled at him or his foot gently ran over his own on accident. it was difficult to sit there and act like nothing was bothering him. he was being eaten alive by his heart but his head told him to ignore it. that this was all just a phase and it'll fade once he's back at school because it was gone until he had gotten home.
"oh my god, you're nineteen and still a virgin!" john exclaimed, watching the brunet turn and reach for the door of his room. "wait, sherlock." he grabbed the other strap of his book bag, pulling him back.
“No.” Sherlock rested his head on John’s shoulder, feeling the hand comb through his hair. “Thank you, for everything.”
john's mouth watered as he looked over the above average length cock, watching the tiny bead of pre come drop down in. he wanted to sit on it badly. let sherlock fuck him until he couldn't walk.
sherlock huffed out a laugh. "just give me a second." he adjusted himself before picking up the pace, watching the blond underneath him let out a soft moan and tilt his head back.
Sherlock went to the stairs where John set their bags, taking theirs and leaving Ben’s before heading upstairs. He walked into his old bedroom, setting the bags down on the neatly made bed, taking a seat on the edge.
"you're all i have." he sniffled, wiping his face with the sleeves of his sweater. he brought his hands down from his face and gave sherlock that look. the look that john gave him the first time him james got into a huge fight. his expression was soft, but his eyes were wide and asking for help. that was one thing john never did. he hated admitting he needed help. he thought it made him weak and venerable.
sherlock opened the text and stared at the grey bubbles from his friend, seeing the three dots appear.
“Papers went through last month,” John said. “He’s your grandson.” he looked up at Sherlock and smiled, “And our son.”
john nodded, whimpering slightly. once sherlock got up john watched him walk away in the mirror then saw him reappear with a small packet in his hand.
"yes, just like that, baby boy." sherlock rested back on one arm, the other holding up his phone as he took quite a few pictures of the doctor. his eyes wide in filled with lust as sherlock's cock was in his mouth and he was bouncing on a dildo. sherlock tossed his phone to the side, keeping his eyes on john. he wanted to feel how open he was, how wet.
“Out in the garden messing with his plants. I’ll go fetch him,” she said then hurried off into the kitchen.
they went down to the kitchen and started making their hot chocolate. as sherlock mixed the milk with the powder, john went through his parents 'adult' cabinet. "vodka good?" he asked his friend.
Sherlock exhaled deeply, looking out the window as he held onto his husband’s hand, thinking of the positive outcomes of today.
sherlock looked down, pulling his chair out and sitting down. he felt and elbow nudge him and he looked over at his uncle.
“He turned six months last week.” He watched his mother smile at her grandson, listening to her speaking to him softly.
"afraid so." sherlock kissed the top of john's head. "but, we can sit under a blanket and i'll hold your hand and you can lay on my shoulder."
sherlock sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "this." he looked at john again. "you're in a relationship!"
Sherlock paced in the living room as the phone rang, the pit feeling in his stomach getting worse. He stopped in his steps when the welcoming voice of his mother filled his ear.
of course he was running late. he always was. especially when it was something to do with sherlock. he was probably bringing james with him. god if he was sherlock would get up and walk out because he did not agree to that and john never mentioned it. sherlock set his phone on his folded jacket next to him, placing his hands in his lap as he watched the window, tapping his fingers on the table top.
john scoffed. "you couldn't see me before you left? we've been friends forever and you couldn't see me before you left for a semester in boston?"
"you two haven't seen each other since summer. the least you could do is stop by and saw hello to dorothy and henry."
john stood up, stepping down the few steps and into sherlock's arms. "what's in that bag?" he asked.
John didn’t question it, getting into the driver side, looking at his husband as he buckled up. “Alright?”
after everyone was finished with dessert, they broke out the eggnog and migrated to the living room for their traditional watching of miracle on 34th street and home alone. during the first movie, sherlock got up from his seat, weaving his way through family and to the stair case. he walked up the steps silently, seeing john sitting in the small lounge area by the steps.
sherlock looked up, locking eyes with john. the blond gave him a smile and a thumbs up before backing out of his spot then driving out of the parking lot. sherlock set his phone into the cup holder and sighed. he may have just made a mistake.
“That sounds great, I’ll make the roast John loves so much for dinner. What else do you two want? Any sweets? Who am I kidding, I’m surprised your teeth haven’t fallen out from all the sweets you eat.”
sherlock leaned forward, watching john lean back. he got pulled down by the lapel of his jacket, getting kissed hard by the boy underneath him. he adjusted himself as he kissed back, pressing his groin against the blond's, getting a small noise from him.
"i know you want to fuck me." john opened the bottle, squeezing some lube into his hand before reaching down and grabbing a hold of sherlock's half hard cock. "and i want you to."
the family thing wasn't true because his parents still loved john like their third son and nothing changed when he came out. but the thoughts about john were probably true. sherlock played it through his head. him confessing his feelings to his best friend, him rejecting him and calling him things then never speaking to him again. it played in sherlock's head like a movie. a movie that left him heartbroken and that pit like feeling in his gut. he needed to get over it, but he just didn't know how.
the hands moved from his thighs and to his hips, pushing them into the floor. in a flash second sherlock was all the way back up john's body, his breath hot in his ear. "greedy little boys don't get what they want," he growled. "they get what they deserve."
sherlock moaned softly, pushing his cock into the touch. "fuck yes." he breathed then sat back, watching the boy sit up and get on his knees. he pulled his shorts and boxers down, watching his cock spring free then a hand wrap around it.
Sherlock returned the smile. He stepped closer to his mother, looking at Ben who was holding onto the necklace his mother wore. The boy looked up at his father, smiling and reaching out for him.
"look at you, eating it up." sherlock said darkly as he pushed the toy into the doctor slowly, watching it go into him as far as it could. "obviously is not as good as the real thing." he said and pulled the toy completely out out of john.
john chuckled softly, looking up at the detective. "i know, love." he cupped the brunet's cheek, "but i am a cock slut, so i'll let that one slide."
sherlock looked at the goods on the table, snatching a few ginger snaps and putting them on his plate.
john pulled away first, needing a breath of air. he smiled up at his friend, wanting to stay like this forever.
sherlock grabbed john's chin and tilted his head up. "such a greedy little thing." he said as he sat on the bed. "do you want my cock?" he asked.
“Just like his dad,” John said. He let Ben stand in his lap, holding him up. He pushed his mug and plate out of reach of Ben.
it's been six days since sherlock spoke to john and as far as sherlock knows, john at sholto we're still together. sherlock constantly checked john's profiles, seeing that all of his bios still had sholto's name in them. so either they worked it out or they broke up, but john cant let go. either way, sherlock should just stop thinking about john in general because their friendship was over.
“I can’t… fuck… John, please…” Sherlock is yanking hard on his wrist cuffs, which hold tight. John casts his eyes to the timer; only twenty seconds have passed.
He disappeared into the bedroom, and John heard some rummaging, and soon he emerged, divested of his Christmas waistcoat, wearing his dressing gown, and carrying an old-fashioned photo album, thick with inserts. He collapsed dramatically onto the sofa next to John and dropped his legs one over the other on the coffee table, the album on his lap. He let his head fall back and stared at the ceiling for a long moment.
“That’s understandable,” Irene says. “Sherlock told me he tried to explain to you how it helps him.”
“You look fucking amazing, all spread out like that. I got hard for you in about two seconds,” John says into Sherlock’s eyes. “I can’t tell you how much I wish I could undo your ankles, put your knees over my shoulders, and fuck you into the middle of next week.”
He pushes back down, allowing his teeth to barely skim the surface. “Oh, God,” Sherlock yells, and when John glances up he sees Sherlock’s body so rigid it is almost shaking, his chin pointed at the ceiling, and his breath coming in short bursts, like he is trying to hold it and failing.
Then their eyes meet one more time, and without even thinking about it, they close the space between them and seek one more kiss from each other, gentle and affirming, before they move quietly to their bedroom and collapse into sleep.
And then, if he was being honest, he would probably have to pass out and sleep for another few hours, or possibly days.
Every attempt is futile. John hates when he does this, loves when he does this. He raises his head, his mouth angling for Sherlock’s, but no. Sherlock shifts and John’s nose glances off a sharp cheekbone. He hovers his open mouth just out of reach, a breath is shared, and then he pulls up, smirking.
“Fuck,” John gasps. “We’re definitely doing your ankles, too. And don’t you fucking kick at me, or this ends right now. I mean it.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes closed. “Okay, just relax. Move it around under your chin until it feels right.”
John steps out of his jeans and pants and noisily kicks them toward his shirt. Then he leans forward, his hands gripping the grid wall, careful to not let any part of his body touch Sherlock’s, except his mouth, back against his ear.
Sherlock doesn’t answer. John opens the fridge once more to retrieve a bottle of white wine from the bottom shelf. “Look, I don’t know why you’re shooting daggers at me with your eyes, but please get past it quickly. Greg’s coming for dinner and I won’t have you giving me the silent treatment while he’s here.”
So he freezes in front of the weird new staircase, closes his eyes in the dream, and wills himself through the hypnagogic fog until he finally awakens and sits up, in the home he knows is his own.
“That you might, in fact, find what happens to him to be incredibly arousing.” She smiles at him. “It’s not an unusual reaction, Doctor Watson. I’m encouraging you to stay open to the possibility and embrace it if it happens. You should also feel free to deal with it in any way you like. It certainly won’t shock me.”
“Fine. We’ll attract all the feral cats in the neighborhood, shall we? Stand up straight,” Sherlock says exasperatedly, pushing John’s shoulders back a little. He moves around behind John’s right shoulder and holds the bow out in front of him. “Thumb here, four fingers on the other side.” John takes it from him and tries to mimic the position. “Here… just…” Sherlock mutters, repositioning a couple of fingers, and sighing in despair.
“It’s okay,” John says truthfully. “I never mind listening to you play. That one was a bit sad, yeah?”
“Well, I’ll leave you to forage for your supper,” Mrs. Hudson sighs, pushing herself to her feet using the knees she finds on either side of her. “I’ll be back in the morning to clear all of this away.”
“Maybe… maybe we could find a use for it,” John finishes, looking at Sherlock’s hand, covering his hand, covering Sherlock’s heart.
At some point, in the middle of the night, John drifts awake to discover Sherlock mouthing lightly at his chest.
There is, in fact, soundproofing, among other construction, and some wiring, and a new coat of paint, all of which take about a month.
“If your heart ever stops, mine will too. That’s how this works, now. I know it isn’t fair, that’s not a fair thing to ask of anyone, but John…” Sherlock’s voice had started to quaver.
“Oh, Christ,” John moans in anticipation. He lets his head fall back to the pillow and closes his eyes, focusing on every point of contact his skin has with the tumble of limbs currently crawling down his body.
John came back because he realized that Sherlock was all he wanted in the world, and he was willing to sit in their living room a thousand nights in a row to prove it.
To start with, there’s a giant red bow on the door that absolutely was not there when they left the flat this morning.
Irene walks slowly to Sherlock’s back, coating the bulb with the lube in her hand. “Sherlock,” she says, in a calm but authoritative voice, “I need you to relax now. Please close your eyes and focus.”
Sherlock placed the vial in a tray on the table. “Thank you,” he said, more or less into the microscope.
“No,” John says, stretching out and rolling to his stomach, back into the same position Sherlock always finds him. “I’m fine here.”
Sherlock sits back on his heels again. His eyes are on fire with satisfaction, his lips red and wet as he gasps for breath, and his own erection is straining the cloth of his pyjamas. He locks his gaze with John and slowly drags the back of a hand across his mouth, a filthy, defiant gesture.
their anniversary, Sherlock” - and Sherlock petulantly refuses to spend two hours with him in the back of a car on Friday night but agrees to take the first train Saturday morning.
the door shakes; he grabs a beer, and slams the door closed again. He opens the drawer containing the churchkey with equal force, pops the top off the bottle, drops the opener back in and slams the drawer home too.
“You married someone, after I came back. I was back, John, and you married her, and she died and you blamed me and I tried, I did try, I asked Mrs. Hudson if I could see you, and she said…”
“Only my face, Sherlock. You cannot look down at my cock. You’re going to watch my face as I come. And you have to maintain eye contact with me, watch my face the whole time, right up until I tell you otherwise, or you’ll be punished the moment I’m finished. Do you understand?”
John doesn’t get out of the clinic until after 1am. It’s the Friday night after the last day of exams at the local university, so he agreed to a later shift to help with the kids who got a little too drunk (or a lot too drunk) and missed a step somewhere, resulting in a cut or scrape or occasional sprain. He dresses their wounds and doles out paracetamol like candy, then helps them back outside to a hopefully slightly more sober friend and sends them on their way. No lectures; he was a uni student once, too.
to figure out, Sherlock! Do you see them growing gills?” Mycroft snapped crisply throwing his hands up in the air in frustration. “Honestly, you're the only God I know of that doesn't bother to do the
“I’m… I’m.” He stuttered, and then those blue eyes widened as they looked at Sherlock in recognition.
Mycroft looked hard at his brother, icy eyes disapproving. His mouth was set in a moue of distaste, even as his hands gripped his cup. Always seeking warmth, and yet his breath was made of cold as he asked in exasperation “Please don’t tell me this is going to be a repeat of your past. You
He resists it, at first, trying to tell himself that it’s not real, it’s a figment, it is bullshit. He closes his eyes and wills it away, but it doesn’t comply. It is, instead, stronger than ever.
“Oh, fuck.” John sat up and steadied himself, then shoved the car door open. He shifted gingerly to the pavement and looked back at Lestrade, shading his eyes with his hand. “Thanks,” he said, and meant it. “I’m… so sorry.” He meant that too.
When she bends down to pick it up, her phone drops from the crook of her neck and clatters on the ground. She can still hear her mother prattling on about who’s bringing what to Christmas dinner.
“I’ll pay it.” John says it unconsciously, hears the words in the air, takes a moment to process them, as if he wasn’t quite aware that they came from his own mouth. “We’re keeping the flat. I’ll pay the rent.” He knows he sounds ridiculous, and is grateful Mrs. Hudson doesn’t press him on exactly what he means by
“I take it I’ve hit the spot, then,” John says, almost calmly. He pushes the button again, letting it go for a fractionally longer time. A whine escapes Sherlock’s throat. His cock bobs up to his hip, and starts to leak.
His release pours out of him with a shuddering, almost pained silence, his eyes screwed shut, his face buried against John’s neck. He falls to his elbows and forgets to breathe for a long time, until his lungs begin to burn.
Sherlock moves to a particular spot under the center front part of the cage ceiling, and turns to face the room.
Sherlock strokes him through it, then plants his hand back on the bed and begins to pound into John in earnest. John drifts for a long moment, overwhelmed by sensation, then becomes dimly aware that Sherlock’s movements are starting to feel somewhat desperate. He reaches up and grips Sherlock’s neck.
He collapsed back into the pillow, right on his face, and thought about the state of his affairs. He was as thirsty as he could ever remember being. He was both starving and simultaneously sickened by the idea of eating anything. His head felt like someone had cleaved an ax into his skull.
John almost (almost) lets himself get lost in it. It’s so tempting. But then the day’s events slam back into the forefront of his mind.
“Ah,” the bloke replies, an awkward pause, a nervous laugh. “Not one to waste time, then. I’m Daniel.” He offers his hand.
So. The first time that John didn’t notice was in a lazy moment, as they were drifting through some refractory downtime. Passing the minutes in sleepy idleness, affection with no real purpose, the sensation of touch for its own sake, still a bit of disbelief that they finally reached this point. Sherlock, his eyes blinking heavily, had reached his arms up to catch hold of the headboard, just because the stretch felt good. John lifted his head from where it had been resting on Sherlock’s ribcage and started to mouth over the expanse of skin. He smoothed his hands along Sherlock’s waist and glanced up, Sherlock’s hair a mess, his face blissfully relaxed, his stretched-out chest rising and falling with even, satisfied breaths, his arms taut and lengthened, and John muttered, “Fucking hell, you’re gorgeous.”
John just… didn’t do things like this. He didn’t get stupid drunk and pass out on someone’s floor, and he certainly didn’t do it without checking in with Sherlock. He still had no idea how last night got away from him to such a calamitous extent.
John relaxes into the kiss despite his frustration, because they are still at the stage where he finds Sherlock’s inappropriately timed affection to be more amusing than anything else. He thinks Sherlock honestly believes this is what he is supposed to do at this point, like he heard the phrase “make-up sex” somewhere and decided that this is how it must start, by kissing your partner the very moment he gets mad at you.
He can very nearly hear the synapses firing in Sherlock’s brain, playing a thousand chess matches through to the end, testing every scenario, making absolutely sure they will come through it intact.
John’s anger dissipates in an instantaneous rush as the plain truth of Sherlock’s statement sucks the air out of his lungs.
So he will not act on his anger. Not here, in this room, in this moment, in their metaphorical darkness. He’ll never do that. Here, now, he will play the part he agreed to play for this man he loves beyond measure.
It’s the first weekend in August, and London is having the worst heatwave that anyone currently alive can remember. The air is stagnant, wet and heavy, and any breeze that picks up feels like it is emanating from some kind of giant invisible blow dryer. Everyone in the city with any money, time, and good sense has decamped to whatever bit of seaside could still accommodate them, which makes for a somewhat less hectic Saturday morning shift than usual at the clinic.
She leads him over to the bench. Irene lays her riding crop down alongside the other objects from the armoire, and looks up at Sherlock.
When John is finished, he crawls up one more time to rub at Sherlock’s strained shoulders. “The lights are on, by the way.”
There’s none of the brash, in-your-face confidence of the younger ones who had approached him before. This one is a bit reticent, almost shy.
“This one's hers,” Sherlock says, and as soon as he finishes speaking, he pulls John’s mouth to his. They kiss for a few slow moments, but there is, in fact, a nervousness on both sides as they separate. John leaves his eyes closed as they drift apart, and feels Sherlock’s hand reach up to his cheek.
A few minutes later, when he hears Sherlock come back into the room, John pulls his eyes open with a groan - he swears even his eyelids are sweaty. Sherlock is holding two glasses of ice water. Like any good British subject, John usually prefers his drinking water room temperature, but the glass Sherlock is holding out to him is already gathering condensation and it shines like an irresistible beacon. He sits up and takes it, drinking a long swig, then lays back down. He presses the bottom of the glass to his forehead, then the center of his chest. Sherlock drinks until there’s nothing but ice left in his own glass, then flops back down on his stomach.
a hand pulled at sherlock's hair and he growled softly as he continued to lick over the small bud, rubbing the other between his fingers. the grip of the hand grew tighter as john's moans became louder.
“It’s hard not to be.” Sherlock smiled softly at his son. He looked over at his father who stood with a smile glued on his face, eyes fixed on his grandson. “Do you want to hold him, dad?”
When they arrived at the Holmes house, Sherlock felt the pit feeling in his stomach again, staying in the car as John got out. His door opened and John was looking down at him with a comforting smile. “I’ll take the bags in and you handle Ben, yea?”
"i'm here for you, sherlock. if you need anything, give me a call." sherlock nodded, feeling a bit better.
"says it's annoying." john added as he grabbed the remote. he closed the curtains, blocking out the sun reflecting onto the tv before sitting down next to his friend.
john stood, taking a seat in the brunet's lap, gaining eye contact with him. "would you like to kiss me, sherlock?"
"things change." sherlock set his plate out to dry. "we've grown apart. it happens. night, dad." sherlock said then walked out of the kitchen, walking through the hall then going upstairs and locking himself in his room.
sherlock smirked and chuckled, pushing john's chin up with his thumb and kissing his neck, biting the skin teasingly. "you don't deserve me. not after all that teasing." he said then gently bit the skin underneath john's ear, making him yelp softly.
He slept when he felt like sleeping, ate when he felt like eating, and otherwise stared, and wept, and grieved.
“No, you won’t,” John says, grabbing an arm and hoisting him up and maneuvering him around the table toward the bedroom. “You’ll be much more comfortable in bed.”
not, hesitate or question. His purpose in that moment would be to release Sherlock from any restraints as quickly and safely as possible, immediately check for any physical injury, and assuming there was none, ground Sherlock in whatever way made sense until Sherlock recovered. John’s actions had to be instantaneous, automatic, and controlled.
“Oh, nothing. Do what you like with it. I’ve never been able to let it anyway. Only put in some soundproofing, would you?”
“I know,” John replies, cupping Sherlock’s cheek for a moment. “I’ll tell them.” He lets his hand drift down to take Sherlock’s, and stands up. “This sweater
“All right?” John asks, and Sherlock nods slowly. “Okay.” John takes a minute to admire the sight before him, sliding a hand along Sherlock’s back, down over his arse and back up, smoothing over the skin bunched between his shoulder blades, then along the back of his neck and into his hair. He smiles as he feels Sherlock brace himself for another yank, but John just pets him, drifting his fingertips along his neck before standing up.
from ecstasy to agony and back again. John certainly finds his own pleasure during their scenes, just as often as Sherlock does, but it is still usually in service of Sherlock’s submission. John never just takes what
He waits for Sherlock to look up at him, and holds his gaze for one second, then another, then a third. Sherlock’s eyes are unusually dark, and offer no clues.
He isn’t there twenty minutes before he is propositioned by some young thing in skinny jeans and Doc Martens. He apologizes politely, says he’s waiting for someone. The boy mutters “Shame,” looks him up and down suggestively, and slides away.
Sherlock brought the cooler over to the kitchen table, next to where John was standing, and put it down in front of them. “Why do I want a heart? You’re a doctor, John. It’s the most fascinating muscle in the human body. Who wouldn’t want one?”
When he got to seven, he drew blood. Just a slight tear in the skin, nothing that would scar, and it healed over almost as soon as it appeared, but it was enough, or too much. He called for the lights to go on.
She continues tracing the crop around his body, landing blows intermittently, without warning, and everywhere from his ankles to the back of his neck. He makes a noise deep in his throat with each one, and he has started to breathe more audibly through his nose, but otherwise doesn’t struggle.
sherlock smirked and gripped the boy’s hips, letting his forehead rest between his shoulder blades as he pounded into him, wrapping a hand around the neglected cock.
sherlock knew it wasn't right. they were both a bit tipsy and john was in a relationship. a committed one too.
"you were going seventy. speed limit is fifty five. license and registration." he stood at the window, watching his nephew take his lisence out of his wallet.
John set the bib on the table by Sherlock before going to the counter and grabbing the avocado that sat in a bowl of various fruits and veggies.
"still angry?" sherlock asked. john jumped some, letting out a small yelp. "oh my god, sherlock! i didn't even hear you come in."
"that's fine." john said. he looked over his friend, seeing the only thing that had changed was that he had gotten thinner and john never thought that'd be possible. his phone went off next to him and he sighed, grabbing his phone and putting it on do not disturb, not even looking at the text from his boyfriend. "so, how's harvard?" he asked.
sherlock sighed, taking john's hand off his cheek and holding it, looking down at their hands. "what will happen when we both go back to school?" he looked up at john. "you'll see james again and realize how much he meant to you and fall for him again."
John took the small hand gently, kissing it multiple times, causing the boy to giggle, causing the smile on John’s face to grow bigger.
sherlock gave him a sympathetic look and nodded once. john wiped his face and nodded. he looked down at his phone as it went off, seeing that sherlock had sent a text.
"yes! i was traumatized! all i could think about was his wrinkly old, hairy balls for the rest of my childhood."
"we don't always have to study when you come over, sherlock." the blond responded, not looking up from his phone. "besides, the class is easy. the final won't be hard at all."
sherlock laughed softly, nodding. he kissed john again, pushing him back until the backs of his knees his the mattress and he was falling down. they separated and sherlock smiled down at him. "i love you, too."
"if you'd love me, you'd get this sweater off and that stuff off your desk." john lifted up shelrock's sweater.
"sherlock!" john whined as he looked at the detective, his mouth falling open as his back arched, coming all over his chest.
sherlock hummed, rubbing his fingertips over the fabric of the boy's shirt. "and these? oh god these just are sinful. absolutely sinful." he lowered himself, rubbing the underside of the boy's thighs.
the scent of mrs. watson's homemade cinnamon wax melts filled his nose and he felt at home. he toed his shoes off, putting them on the mat next to john's boots. he hung up his coat and scarf, looking around the house before walking upstairs silently. he turned right and went to the second door on his left, standing in the doorway of john's room, seeing him sitting on his bed, typing furiously on his phone.
sherlock laughed, tossing the cloth, aiming it at his laundry hamper. "great way to start a new year, if you ask me." sherlock got up to turn his bedroom light off.
sherlock walked over to him, taking the bottle. he brought it to his nose and pulled it away, instantly smelling it. "no, no." he gave it to john. "put it back. we're not drinking that."
“That’s okay.” He adjusted the mirror so he could see Ben in the backseat who was already asleep. He put the car in drive, placing a hand on Sherlock’s thigh as he drove away.
"we're supposed to be studying," sherlock stopped spinning to look at the blond that sat on the bed, glued to his phone.
john pulled off and got taken by surprise when sherlock pushed him back and flipped him over, holding onto his hips.
john lowered himself, inhaling the scent of musk and salt as he licked around the base of sherlock's cock, looking up at him through his lashes.
"ah, fuck, sherlock." john moaned, adjusting himself as he slipped his hand down his body, grabbing ahold of his neglected cock.
john leaned in and kissed sherlock again, this time sherlock kissed back after a few seconds, only knowing how to mimic john's moves.
“So glad you’re here. Where’s my son? Pouting in the car?” She let go of John, looking over his shoulder at their car.
“Hudders brought some fruits and vegetables up. I was thinking a bit of avocado since he hasn’t tried it yet,” Sherlock said as he set the table for him and John.
sherlock grinned, standing up and pulling his sweater off, tossing it before going to the bag. john sat up, taking his own tee shirt off as he watched sherlock open a box of condoms. he lay down, watching his pale boyfriend smirk at him saying, "best get those jeans off before i do it for you." he shot him a wink before turning back to the desk and opening a bottle of lube.
"are you going to speak?" john asked, slightly pissed. henry set a mug down in front of john, saying their food wouldn't be too long.
john laughed with him. he nuzzled his partner's neck, kissing the skin gently. sherlock wrapped an arm around john, holding him close. "i love you." he whispered into the sand colored hair.
it took a while before sherlock finally learned how to kiss back after taking in all that john has done. he became more relaxed and comfortable, his hands finding their way to the bottom of the rugby captain, cupping the plush arse.
sherlock chuckled and looked down at his father who was smiling up at him. "one damn christmas present if you ask me." he said.
it felt right. they were both pieces of a puzzle. a five hundred pieced puzzle and it only took them nineteen years to find the last two missing pieces. each other.
sherlock knew john's boyfriend's name. never left his head. he was jealous of him. jealous that he got what sherlock has always wanted. what he's been in love with since sophomore year of high school. sherlock called himself pathetic and set his phone back down, tilting his head back and closing his eyes, ignoring the vibrations from his phone.
"shit," sherlock groaned as he used all his force to stay angled in that one spot, going as hard and quick as his body would let him. "touch yourself."
"what?" john asked, looking down at his outfit. a green leotard with his shorts. there was nothing wrong with that. "it's fine." he said, tossing his bag down then bending over it, smirking as he saw sherlock starting at him in the mirror.
john chuckled softly. "let me do the work." he pushed sherlock back, hovering over him as he removed his glasses, placing them to the side before kissing sherlock again.
"if you knew why you'd understand." sherlock looked at his hands, feeling that empty gut feeling like last nights.
by the time sherlock got home, it was past dinner time, but his mom made a plate for him and left it in the microwave, allowing him to eat once he said his hellos.
sherlock got back from the yard and set the takeaway he picked up on the kitchen table, hearing the noises from the bedroom. "john?" he frowned as he walked to the bedroom. he pushed open the bedroom door and saw john laying on the bed with his legs spread and a flesh colored dildo thrusting in and out of him at a quick pace.
john threw his head back, his hand tightening in the curls as his mouth fell wide open. "right there! oh fuck, fuck, again, do it again!" his other hand fell to sherlock's shoulder blade, digging into the soft flesh as sherlock kept that angle.
sherlock rolled his eyes. he wish john would just shut up about james. he was a dick that didn't deserve john. but john loved him and his heart is too big to realize that his boyfriend is a douche. so sherlock is forced to put up with it.
he pulled his face out of his pillow, starring at the darkness of his room, regretting coming home this early. he should've taken the chem lab shifts, but his mother insisted that he should come down to spend more time with family and she bought his plane tickets, so he couldn't say no. he really wanted to. he knew that john would be all up in his business, trying to get him to talk, but if sherlock saw john in person his heart would probably snap in two and then his entire body. it was unhealthy the way he felt towards his best friend. it was unhealthy to be in love with another boy. from what sherlock learned in sunday school, he'd be hated if he was gay. he'd be thrown out of his house and disowned. his best friend would disown him too. call him a freak and perverted for ever having a crush on him.
sherlock laughed, pulling his shorts back on before sitting next to the boy. “next week, same time?”
john relaxed into sherlock, sobbing. he calmed down after a few minutes, keeping his arms wrapped around sherlock's waist, not wanting the moment to end.
john stopped his hand, holding the base of sherlock's cock as he put it in his mouth again, bobbing his head, gagging every time the member hit the back of his throat.
Friday afternoon, Sherlock packed up the car, said goodbye to Mrs. Hudson and got Ben into the car without a fuss. He drove to the clinic, nervousness filling his body as he thought about what would happen in a few hours. When he arrived at the clinic, he pulled to the curb where John was standing and put the car in park, getting out.
"then let's get our asses down there." he grabbed john's wrists, pulling him off the bed. when he leaned over to get his phone, sherlock pulled him away. "leave it." he said then pushed the laughing john out of his bedroom.
once a family with a screaming infant sat next to him, he took out his ear buds and turned his music on, seeing the text:
“stay right here. nice and pretty for me then i’ll fuck you, yeah?” he asked in the blond’s ear, giving his ass a slight squeeze.
john pressed his face into the crook of the taller man's neck. "do we really?" he inhaled the scent of his body was and coffee beans.
john laughed softly. he looked over at the car a few spots over and smiled before looking down at his phone.
"do you have to wear that?" sherlock asked as he watched john walk in wearing taunting shorts that were just enough to cover his butt.
there was a second of just starring before sherlock made the first move, letting go of john's hand. he put his finger under the chin of the blond, tilting his head up more then catching him into a kiss. john stepped closer, his hands resting on the boney hips, gripping the fabric of sherlock's shirt.
henry nodded. "does your dad want fries or coleslaw?" he asked as he wrote it down on the order pad.
“What a cutie,” Harold said as he placed an arm around his wife, smiling at his grandson. “I’m your gramps. I’m gonna give you sweets when you’re not supposed to have them.”
as they watched the movie, sherlock could've sworn john scooted a centimeter closer every few minutes until their thighs were touching. it wasn't like they sat this close before, but they were both a bit tipsy after drinking all their spiked hot chocolate. and the fact that all sherlock could think about was his best friend. being pinned down. moaning his name. sherlock subtlety moved a pillow into his lap, hugging it tightly. he lost focus in the movie and thought of many different things to get the topic of his mind change, but it refused. then john lay his head on shelrock's shoulder and he almost came right then and there in his pants.
"c'mon. don't be shy." john wrapped his arms around sherlock's neck. "your prick is already in me, i think we know each other enough."
sherlock chuckled. "good thing i'm not a killer." he went over to john's desk and pulled out the chair, sitting in it, putting quite some distance between them.
“Just like him, yes you are.” Harold took the small hand off his nose, then the small hand wrapped around his finger.
Sherlock chuckled. “Make whatever you want, I’m sure we’ll eat it all and take home what we don’t finish.”
sherlock slumped into his seat, letting out a huff. he looked at the ceiling, thinking if he should make up an excuse or actually out in the effort to see john. they could go out for lunch. sherlock remembered his mom was going shopping with mrs. watson and his father was out working on god knows what. he's always doing something.
"relax, sherlock." john said softly, cupping the brunet's cheeks as he leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to the virgins lips. he pulled away and looked at sherlock who was completely frozen. his eyes were shut and john could tell that his beautiful mind was racing about what was going on.
john pulled away from the kiss, his mouth falling open and a moan escaping as sherlock thrusted into him quicker. "harder," john breathed.
sherlock looked at john again. he was wearing a light blue sweater with a partial turtle neck and it looked absolutely sublime on him. sholto must've bought it for him. john was a jobless college student. he definitely couldn't buy new clothes.
sherlock handed john his mug. "oh i know. i've known that since you two started dating." he took a swig of his hot chocolate, humming. "damn that's strong."
sherlock gave a small nod, his hands settling on  john's bare thighs that the tiny shorts the rugby captain wore never covered.
john looked out his window and saw sherlock sitting in his car, looking at him. "i'm not doing this." he sniffled, looking at his steering wheel. "you went out to a bar and didn't tell me. i found out because of the shit chris posted. so i don't want to hear it. i went out to lunch with my best friend. get your head out of your ass, james." john said then hung up, looking over at sherlock again.
The anxiety and tension, the worry and the frustration, John feels all of it drain out of him as Sherlock starts moving, slowly at first, then gradually increasing the pace. There’s room for nothing but sheer need, his desire for this man above him suffusing every cell in his body. He pushes down to meet each of Sherlock’s thrusts and lets himself get lost in it, just for now. His hand reaches for his cock but Sherlock slaps it away and begins to move his own hand up and down in rough uneven jerks but John doesn’t care, it’s enough, it’s enough, it’s too much and he fists the sheets and throws his head back and comes over his stomach with a long, low groan.
The fall to their backs, not touching, each of them sweating, breathing heavily, and extremely satisfied with their efforts.
“A suit.” Sherlock crossed the room in three long strides and pulled his coat from the arm of the sofa.
The first time was early, still, just six days after they had finally stopped being idiots, although they were even idiotic in the way they went about it, during the umpteenth argument about Sherlock being an idiot and needlessly risking his life during a criminal investigation. John had harangued him the entire taxi ride home and through the front door and up the stairs until Sherlock whirled around, grabbed the back of John’s neck with both hands, and slammed their mouths together.
When John comes downstairs in the middle of the night for a glass of water, Sherlock is curled awkwardly on his chair, his unfocused eyes staring straight ahead.
John’s mouth curled at Sherlock’s exaggerated agony as he took it. He set it carefully on the table and gingerly opened the cover to the very first photo.
John smears the rest of the lube over the condom and shoves in, falling over Daniel’s back as he goes balls-deep, and of course,
” He thrashes against John’s grip and occasionally manages to lift one fist or the other off the sheets for a split second, but the angle is terrible and John is
“Sherlock, I promise, you have been witness to every orgasm I’ve had since I moved back in, except for a couple in the shower while you were in Dorset.”
Irene stands, and John does too, a chivalrous instinct that seems ridiculous now he’s done it. She looks at him expectantly. “Do you have any other questions before we begin?”
“You heard me,” John says calmly. He looks over at Sherlock, but his face is expressionless, betraying no hint of his intentions.
He lurched up and reached for the bottle to find that Sherlock had even pried the lid loose for him. He shook two pills, maybe three, he couldn’t really see that well, into his hand, threw them in his mouth, and downed the contents of the glass in one long pull.
John slaps him on the back as he coughs through it, then sits down at the table. “So, what was your hypothesis?” he asks, just to see if he can get Sherlock to attempt the word.
As he exhales, he opens his eyes again and looks at Sherlock, who has not moved a muscle during their entire conversation.
of pain... inflicted on people, all this” - he waves a hand to indicate the All This which now exists tangibly in this room - “...it isn’t something that’s easy for me to get my head around.”
When John reached four, Sherlock grunted in a way that suggested more pain than pleasure, and John swallowed down a catch in his throat.
Eventually Sherlock seems to become aware that he can’t solve all his problems at once, and decides to make balance his priority. His sobs are temporarily replaced with grunts of determination as he works to grip the floor with his toes and figure out how to adjust the gravity of his body in a way that will give him some control over the twist of the socket, but his efforts are undermined at irregular intervals by reflexive thrusts of his hips in the final throes of his orgasm. He fights to steady his breathing, the only thing he can truly control at the moment.
She stays at his side, alternating between touching his back and his front, sometimes one side twice in a row just to throw him off, always waiting just until he finds his balance to charge him again.
“Can you tell me why you’re here?” she asks, and John has to bite back a pained laugh at the unexpected reminder of Ella in this particular moment.
Sherlock smiles back and knocks twice without breaking eye contact with John. Several moments later, they hear a bolt lock move out of place, and the door slides open, and they turn to look.
“Mrs. Hudson just stopped me in the hall, and I’ve gotten texts from Mycroft, Greg, and Molly. They’re all asking if I’m their Secret Santa.”
Sherlock blew out a breath and returned his gaze to the ceiling. “It’s not a big deal. I’m just… I’m not used to… some of the things you say.”
He falls forward, his orgasm ripping through his body, bundled with the adrenaline and fear and anger that had coursed through him for the better part of the day. The hand that was on Sherlock’s head now wraps around his torso, the hand from his hip moves to cover Sherlock’s on the headboard. John gives in to two or three more deep thrusts as he spills himself into Sherlock, shuddering and mouthing at his shoulder, moaning into Sherlock’s sweat-soaked skin.
Sherlock stares at him but just for a second because he really is worried about finding a cab and if he misses the train Mycroft will seethe the entire weekend. He slips out.
John’s eyes are filled with concern. “Sherlock? The lights are on. I want to do this. Let me... take care of you.”
John is on his stomach, a sheet covering his lower half. His hands are balled into fists under the pillow, his elbows tucked in at his sides, which pushes his shoulder blades up just a bit. The too-smooth, too-white scar tissue catches the only bit of light in the room.
“You usually don’t wake up when I use the mute.” Sherlock leans over and brushes John’s mouth with a soft kiss of apology. “I’m sorry,” he whispers, kissing him again before dropping back into his own chair, resting the violin and bow across his lap, and stretching his legs forward.
,” Sherlock yells, trying to pull his hands free. John’s grip is tight and unyielding. “Fucking get off me. I don’t want this.”
“I’m sorry,” comes the whispered voice behind him. “About today. I know I’m… I’m a nightmare sometimes. I love you.”
