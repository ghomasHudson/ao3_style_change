pregnant with his pup, so it was really no wonder that he could sit here and scent this omega all night long.
So, while Dean’s knot was still lodged in his ass, Dean made sure to stroke gently along his hips and up his sides while he continued licking at the bite mark he had left on him.
Maybe Jimmy had used an omega service and was too embarrassed to admit it? He should ask him about the omega again when he wasn’t sleep deprived and just coming off his rut.
After a while, Dean’s fingers inadvertently brushed against his oil glands at the base of his wings once, twice, making him shudder. The third time it happened, Castiel began to suspect that it might not be completely accidental after all, especially when Dean took one gland between his thumb and index finger and rubbed it gently, curiously between his fingers.
That… Well, that almost sounded like a plan. Get Cas away from the scent gland on his neck, get him to scent innocent parts like his wrist? Yeah. Might work.
Cas had to feel the effect of the bond, too. Surely, Dean wasn’t the only one who was already craving the other alpha’s presence again. Maybe Cas had tried to reach him on his cell, but of course, Dean didn’t have it with him. Who would bring his burner phone to a night out with his friends?
“No, hey, I understand.” He was already quite infatuated with his pup and had some pretty strong protective instincts going on himself.
There was another awkward moment when they were sitting there, again staring at each other in a way that made his insides tingle in anticipation.
He looked so happy, just about as happy as Cas was feeling, and then they were kissing, tongues stroking over one another leisurely. There was so much love and affection in the kiss that Cas thought maybe… Maybe.
on him! He assumed that most alphas claimed their omegas in the middle of sex, but this had actually been nice. A deliberate claiming while holding each other lovingly rather than biology dictating it.
fallen out of bed? Jimmy hadn’t been opposed to the good morning kiss. And Dean’s dick had already been hard and in need of attention. Would it really have been so bad if Jimmy had helped him out and Dean would have used his ass to find release? Maybe they could have done a bit more kissing while Dean would have slipped his dick into the alpha’s ass.
“Well.” Zachariah obviously wasn’t pleased, but there was really nothing he could do apart from warning him to follow the rules. “It turns out the text message was a false alarm,” he informed Cas. “It was just some beta texting his date. He apparently got fake numbered. No need for a protective detail. We’ll be on our way.”
“All I’m saying is you fuck their ass a bit, fondle their balls, and they’re coming all over themselves in two minutes flat.” Unperturbed, Dean took a sip from his beer and returned his eyes to the TV, even though the movie was still muted. On the screen, the alpha and the omega were now in the post-coital snuggling phase.
say was yes, he minded, because he didn’t need his alpha senses to tell him how dangerous sleeping with Cas (platonically) would be.
But he had learned his lesson and wasn’t as trusting as he used to be. Plus, his sigils were supposed to keep people with ill intentions out.
“It’s not like they have a book for taking care of omegas you knocked up at a fertility ranch,” Dean said, who had suddenly appeared next to him. “That would be quite the title, huh?”
This was exactly why you didn’t date co-workers! Inias didn’t even work in the same department as him, but Cas would still have to see his ex in the interdepartmental meeting tomorrow, which he had only found out about today.
Actually, that suited him fine. If Dean thought they were just scenting for a bit, Castiel could continue his attempt to trigger a vision without tipping the hunter off.
And—most importantly—why did Castiel even care? He was using Dean so that he wouldn’t get fired. He had gotten what he wanted: He’d gotten promoted over Michael. Now all he needed to do was keep a low profile until he could fake un-mate Dean, and they could go their separate ways.
“That is very generous of you, but I can’t accept that,” Cas, stubborn omega that he was, said. “Maybe I can take the couch…”
Dean’s hand was still holding the back of his head, but it started travelling down to the nape of his neck where he began to stroke the little hairs.
Cas muttered something under his breath that sounded like “Gabriel!” Then he took another step back (now he was a bit too far away for Dean’s liking, but he wasn’t about to correct him again), and said, “You prayed to me. Did you change your mind about needing my help?”
Dean was in the middle of making good on his bet when Cas went ahead and exposed his neck for him even more. If he were an omega, that would be a clear sign—an obvious invitation for Dean to take things further. Every time an omega had shown him respect in that way, they had ended up with Dean’s cock in their asses sooner or later (mostly sooner).
“They see a non-human creature and immediately kill it because they think it’s evil,” Castiel insisted.
Cas pressed himself against Dean, nuzzling into him, hoping that the alpha might be able to instinctively know what to do.
The vision had been all jumbled up, but one thing Castiel knew was that he hadn’t been in bed when it happened, so technically, he should be safe in his own bed. If he declined, it would only serve to make Dean suspicious, so he did as Dean had suggested and crawled back under the covers.
They spent the next hour or so talking and then, inevitably, things got quieter as exhaustion took over, and the mumbled conversation turned to whispered conversation turned to nonverbal conversation that mostly consisted of leaning against each other. Dean’s eyes started drooping soon after and he slowly blinked them open one more time to look into Cas’.
There was no way Dean would be able to go to bed while they were in a fight, so a short while later, he found himself leaning against the doorframe of Jimmy’s front door, waiting for the alpha to answer.
There came a time when they just blew each other and Dean came down Cas’ throat. No one mentioned the fact that they had just wasted some of Dean’s sperm.
“I don’t think it’s far into the future,” he replied since Dean was still looking at him expectantly. “You looked the same, I’d say. You were even wearing the same shirt, which probably doesn’t say a lot since you also had it on the last time we met, so I’m assuming it’s one of your favorites?”
“I booked an appointment for you tonight with Dean-o!” he said. “It’s already paid for, six p.m., no need to thank me.”
Oh, Dean wanted to finish all right. He just wasn’t sure if Cas knew what he was asking, where this was going. No way an alpha and an omega in heat could play around with each other—touching, scenting,
Somehow, that only seemed to calm Cas down even more. The omega sagged against him more heavily and they were quietly scenting each other for a while.
with happiness and love. He wasn’t supposed to be giddy (what kind of a feeling was that for an alpha anyway?), but he slowly started to realize that maybe he deserved this. Maybe he deserved Jimmy.
“What the hell are you doing?!” Gabe asked, taking in Castiel’s submissive display with narrowed eyes.
There was no point denying it—Castiel was already more turned on than he had ever been in the presence of other alphas.
Fingering his hole was supposed to be nothing but a necessity. Something that had to be done so that he could fuck that hole. But somehow, watching Cas’ face contort and hearing his low grunts as he squirmed around on his fingers made this process
Maybe laughing about some dumb reality show together would make him sleepy. Decision made, he went over to ring the bell. He soon realized that he should have brought a flashlight since he couldn’t even find the damn bell. Motion sensors! That’s what Jimmy needed! Dean would just have to install them himself next chance he got…
? (To be fair, there probably weren’t many ‘scenting buddies’ outside of mates. Cas was pretty sure that Dean had made that term up.)
He had known exactly what to say and do to worm his way into Castiel’s life (and maybe even a small part of his heart).
When Dean held still for a moment in order to get a grip on his alpha, Cas fucked back himself, pushing his ass against him repeatedly, sliding up and down Dean’s cock.
Dean automatically put his arm around Castiel when he joined them and didn’t falter in his story about how Castiel had fallen asleep on the couch right at the most exciting part of the movie, which meant that Dean had had to recap it, making both of them miss the plot twist and leave them utterly confused by the ending.
“You came to the right angel,” Gabriel told him, his wings arching proudly. “First thing you should know: humans stand really close to each other. Like,
Unfortunately, that was the slick he needed to coat his dick, no other slick would do. He growled at the beta to show his dissatisfaction, baring his teeth. Yeah, he probably shouldn’t have left the house like this, but his rut suppressants usually worked a lot better.
Chances were, Cas felt something for him too, right? Dean knew for a fact that the omega loved his scent, that couldn’t just be the pup. The way Cas always attacked his scent gland every chance he got… Yes, he was definitely into his scent.
So much adrenaline was coursing through his veins that he was almost disappointed when there was no need for him to get into an alpha fight when he arrived in front of Jimmy’s house with screeching tires.
He loved that he was weird, and nerdy, and that he had no regard for personal space or for what was appropriate.
All in all, they were pretty much playing house here. They cooked and ate together, and Dean did his best to make a good impression of a worthy alpha.
Dean hadn’t kissed and scented and cuddled (and more) another omega tonight, after all. After spending hours worrying about that, it was like a weight had been lifted off Castiel’s chest.
“So… wanna go cuddle-steady?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows in a move he usually reserved for flirting with a cute omega.
He might have tried a séance after Balthazar’s death. It hadn’t worked, but if Balthazar wanted to talk to him now, he should be ready.
He couldn’t stand the idea of Jimmy being mad at him, and so he replayed how things had escalated so quickly in his mind on a loop.
Did you like it? A lot happened this chapter, but now they're finally really together again (not just inside a dream).
It took Castiel a moment to realize that Dean wasn’t talking anymore, and another moment to figure out why.
Holding back was hard since the alpha’s tight hole just felt so fucking amazing! Alphas’ channels were always so much tighter than an omega’s slick-covered one. But he’d fuck him open yet.
But Cas wanted to wean their pup off his scent. The message that the omega didn’t want him around long-term was pretty damn clear.
Cas closed the door, but he didn’t feel up to looking Dean in the eyes, so he stared at his own feet instead, trying to think of something to say.
Castiel wasn’t capable of feeling those emotions. Or of having someone feel them for him. Thinking about that made him want to curl up in a corner and die—if only he were capable of
Dean, unaware of his protective display, let his hand travel lower to rest on Cas’ stomach, sending a tingling feeling through his body. This was way too nice for him to question how they had ended up in bed together in the first place.
“Becky?” He hadn’t even thought of the possibility that Dean might need the potion for someone else. But now that he thought about it, it made sense. Of course, Castiel wasn’t the only one who was in love with Dean. There were probably
Week five after starting scent therapy (no progress as of yet), Castiel had learned to pay attention to his other senses in order to compensate for his loss of smell.
So, Dean was done playing fair. The next time, he made sure he was hyped up on caffeine so that he wouldn’t be the one falling asleep first for once and prepared the couch with so many fluffy blankets that it actually looked more like a nest.
“After I asked for the claiming,” Cas, stubborn omega that he was, countered. “I think the real question here is: what has an
Emboldened by the fact that Cas started moving his lips minutely, Dean captured Cas’ upper lip between his own, massaging it lightly and eliciting a soft sigh from the omega.
Dean was king at winging things. So naturally, he hadn’t planned what he was going to say—the right words would come to him. Or so he had thought.
Jimmy, meanwhile, wasn’t just lying there anymore, but had buried his face in Dean’s neck in return and was scenting him as if his life depended on it. That only spurred Dean on more. Getting scented never failed to get his alpha instincts going.
“Guess that means you’re stuck with me, huh?” Dean said when Castiel had finished. Even though he had a lopsided smile on his face, his voice sounded a bit strained.
That’s how Dean got that pretty mouth on his cock after all. Sucking down Cas’ dick at the same time had the added bonus that he got another taste of the omega.
Once or twice, Dean tried to get him to pay more attention to the movie, but Cas would just look towards the screen for a few seconds and then bury his head in Dean’s neck again.
At the same time, his hand kept fondling Jimmy’s belly, occasionally dipping underneath his boxers to show the omega where things were going.
uncomfortable, and Gabe said ‘scenting buddies’ is just a fancy way of saying ‘fuck buddies’ and I just—I don’t…”
Who had ever heard of an omega falling in love with an alpha without even knowing his scent? Yet, if the flip of his stomach in Dean’s presence was any indication, that might be what was happening to him right now.
After all, if Cas were an omega, they would have been having sex for years now. There had been plenty of times when Dean would have made a move. For instance, the Night They Didn’t Talk About. Dean would definitely have fucked Cas then. They had been drunk and it would most likely have been a mistake, but they’d have slept together for sure.
The claim as a promise for more made him think of Dean’s suggestion. One that Cas had told him they’d discuss tomorrow. Only ‘tomorrow’ had come and everything he had tried to put out of his mind with it.
Cas’ erection was trapped between them once more and Dean felt it leave pre-cum all over his stomach.
Really? How on earth could he have not been sure about Dean’s love? He had been so obvious! “What’s an alpha got to do around here? I’ve been courting you, claiming you…”
That was the first time since Castiel had settled down here some 20 years ago that an unhappy customer returned to complain.
Oops, all the touching and scenting might not have been as subtle as he had hoped. Dean was looking up at him. It seemed like Castiel had woken the sleeping bear. Who knew what might happen next…
Gabe was there yet again and his nose did a funny twitch when Dean stepped up to the counter. He had to be reeking of rut if even a beta picked up on it. Nothing to be done about it now, though.
Jimmy kept talking about how it had been part of the witness protection program and stuff, but Dean was barely listening. Changing his sexuality at his age? Hadn’t exactly been a walk in the park. And apparently, while Dean had been busy falling in love with an
Down, boy. Cas wasn’t even in heat yet. This was supposed to be the ‘sniffing each other out’ part. Which they had done quite literally, and Dean couldn’t
Just like last time, they had a couple of days before his heat would hit. Since they didn’t need that time to get to know each other, they could spend it on fun activities like cooking together, and laughing about stupid things from a ridiculous movie they were watching to Dean’s attempt at chasing a spider away.
Cas’ omega was very sad about that. It might just be the pregnancy hormones, but he had to hear Dean’s voice!
Castiel really hoped that one day, he’d be able to put a scent to the face, the voice, the… everything else that was Dean Winchester.
“Everything looks just fine here,” the doctor, a beta in his late 50s, said after poking and prodding him for a while. “Just have your mate lick and soothe it. A mating bite should be treated gently and with love, especially during the first few months.”
He almost sounded concerned, but Castiel didn’t have time for humans and their squeamish attitudes concerning apparitions right now. So, he quickly said his goodbyes.
mating gland in return. Which wasn’t what this was about. Dean didn’t need to prove anything to an ex of his, after all.
Taking mercy on the omega, Dean pulled out partway, leaving only the head inside to keep his anus stretched, and then shoved in again with a grunt. On the next thrust, he managed to shove his shaft even deeper inside.
Instead of getting easier with each passing day, it actually got harder and harder for him as time went on. Cas was carrying
They used the time to prepare the nest, get the fire in the fireplace going so they could spend some time in the love seat talking (and scenting according to their plan to get as much scenting time in before Cas’ heat as possible), and generally preparing themselves as best they could for when Cas’ heat would start.
So when he finally got up the nerve to call the alpha, he stumbled his way through a lie, telling him that his therapist had said he was all healed and didn’t need the scentings anymore. He had the panic attacks under control.
He had just fucked sweet, innocent Cas. While the omega had been in heat. Talk about taking advantage!
Castiel couldn’t believe it! It seemed like his brother had tried to steal his charge out from underneath his nose!
He could see his well-defined muscles from across the street, rippling when the alpha stretched to reach a tough spot, which was somehow hypnotizing. Cas hadn’t even noticed that he’d been staring at the alpha when he suddenly looked over and waved at him.
Dean was the first person to admit that he sucked at apologizing, but his stomach was in knots at the thought that Cas was mad at him for turning a pure angelic ritual into something that it wasn’t meant to be. So, he tried his best as he prayed to Cas and apologized for taking it too far.
Any preference on which fic I should update next? (Well, I’ll probably update Scent-Bonded next because I already have the next chapter finished, so let’s rephrase that: Which fic should I work on? I have some free time and I can’t quite decide.)
“Tell you what. You can have the jacket—if you stop selling his slick to other alphas. Any slick he produces is offered to me first.”
All too soon, Cas pulled away. For the first time in a few weeks, there was at least some color back in his cheeks, so Dean counted that as a win, even though his cuddle dates with Balthazar had lasted about an hour and a simple hug probably couldn’t make up for a one-hour cuddle session.
That sounded like a challenge. One that Castiel would be happy to accept if only it were that easy. “I’m trying to.” What did Dean think he was doing here? Counting the freckles behind his ear with his tongue?
Raphael ignored his answer in favor of scolding him, “Must I remind you that Heaven does not tolerate the existence of nephilims?”
By the time Cas took his third load, he looked completely debauched. Of course, his former virgin asshole had gotten a good workout, but his lips were red and puffy too and there were bite marks all around his mating gland. He hadn’t even mojoed away his own spunk. Some of it was on his abdomen, and Dean had no idea how, but there was even some in his wings too. There went all of his grooming work. The wings looked disheveled just like Cas’ bedhead.
Finally some progress in the form of self-awareness, more or less. So... what do you think, what's about to happen and what would you like to see?
It was all fun and games until Cas was fast asleep on a chair in the war room, no Sam in sight, which meant that it was prank time.
Cas was just walking home from the supermarket, carrying a bag of groceries when he saw a pack of alphas approach. No, not a pack, just three, probably friends who were also out shopping, nothing to be scared of.
Still, Dean was on a mission. They were back in bed for a cuddle session, and was taking his time to seduce Cas once more—but not for sex.
Biting his lips, Cas looked down at his phone, his fingers unsure of what to text back. He shouldn’t. He really, really shouldn’t. But he knew he’d be in for a rough night after what had happened at the gym, and if nothing else, Dean kept the nightmares away…
“Or not. Not is good, too. I mean, you have probably things to do, places to be. I understand completely. Forget I even mentioned it.”
Cas had to smile despite himself. They had started joking around because Dean had used so many blankets one night that it had looked like a nest. Ever since then it had become kind of an in-joke between them. Or maybe it was some sort of alpha-competition: who could make the best nest. Dean was a very competitive alpha and Cas wouldn’t put it past him that he just wanted to win.
Cas just got up and left the room in a huff. Well, he’d see tomorrow morning that there had been no reason to get his panties in a bunch.
He really didn’t want anyone to suffer because of him. There was a smirk on Gabe’s face that told him his brother already knew that Castiel was about to give in. Since he couldn’t let him and his evil ways win, he said, “I’ll do it, but only if you sell it for the usual price.”
“So here’s an idea,” Sam talked right over him. “You—” He pointed at Dean. “—need a roommate. And you—” The finger moved on to point at Castiel. “—need to be fake-mated to someone for a while until those new laws take effect. I say you move in together and we solve two problems at once.”
“Got a new cell phone,” Dean said and took another swig of his whiskey, straight from the bottle because who cared anymore anyway?
Scents down on Earth were so much more… intense. He had noticed it for the first time when he had fallen for Gabriel’s prank and had stood really close to Dean. Humans smelled
Prayer?! As usual, Cas didn’t know what he was talking about. “I didn’t pray, dude,” he set him straight, arms crossed.
“Are you even comfortable with that kind of… cuddle?” he asked, using cuddlibus lingo just to be on the safe side.
While this should be answer enough, Cas couldn’t help but want some verbal reassurance too. “So you… want me too?”
“You said it’s sending the wrong signals,” Dean reminded him. “With the… with the biting and the…” His brain wasn’t really great at forming words, so he just made a motion with his hand that was supposed to fill in the blanks. “But what if it’s sending the right signals?”
) Cas’ asshole slick. Plus, the alpha scent wasn’t really strong enough to block out the heat scent.
“I think that’s enough practice for today,” Dean said, trying to move past the awkwardness of the situation.
A lot, he had to admit when he found out the hard way why, after not having spent a single rut alone in twenty years, you shouldn’t just go cold turkey. Rut sickness was a bitch! His alpha was going a bit insane with the need to fuck an omega, and jerking off didn’t do him any good, no matter how often he wrung an orgasm out of his dick.
This was an alpha who hadn’t been able to come inside of an omega’s ass in long enough that he just wanted to
. That’s what his character is all about.” Seriously, if thinking Doctor Sexy was hot made you alphasexual, then everyone in the world would be alphasexual.
“Oh. Uhm… Yes, of course. Absolutely. Let me just…” He motioned to the bedroom and then quickly got up and vanished through the bedroom door.
the one who’s being ridiculous. Sorry, but this is the weirdest non-relationship you’ve ever been in. I mean, you’re pining for him so bad you’re coming to me for advice…”
“I can’t find a comfortable position.” Mostly because every time he found himself drifting closer to Dean, he had to roll back over and away from him. He knew of a comfortable position, but he doubted Dean would be thrilled if he suddenly had a handful of omega snuggled up against him.
“Hey, this might be the break we’ve been waiting for. Just let me take a look first, see what it’s all about.”
“Look, if you’re not hungry, you don’t need to—” Dean started, but was interrupted by the familiar feeling of tingling sensations running through his entire body as Cas burrowed against him.
As far as this fic is concerned, it could stay a oneshot. Or I also have some ideas to turn it into more if there's interest.
He was still in the middle of his own orgasm that felt so good it was almost too much when Dean grunted and stilled, his prick buried deep in Cas’ channel. A moment later, Cas felt Dean’s big cock twitch within him and then he got a hot load of alpha spunk shot deep into his belly, leaving his insides all tingly because he just got marked by an alpha. By
Seeking out his scent gland, he quickly realized that the scared scent was still there, stronger than ever, not because Jimmy was more scared (he was actually starting to calm down), but because Dean got to
Dean finally had his omega where he wanted him. In his bed, ass in the air, Dean’s cock lodged inside it. Yeah, Dean was totally gonna wreck this hole.
“No, nothing weird. Just fuck him and knot him. Can’t get more vanilla than that. He didn’t even tick the box for ‘rim job,’ or ‘blowjob’ or ‘tying up’ or…”
Mom used to sing it to him, which was why it only occurred to him halfway through the first verse that it wasn’t really your typical lullaby. Somehow, it felt more like he was serenading Cas. Maybe show him what a great alpha he would make for their pup.
Ignoring his instincts was more difficult than anticipated, though. It had been a long time since he had felt this comfortable with someone, much less with an alpha. No wonder his omega wanted to invite Dean’s alpha to scent him back. But that wasn’t what alpha scent therapy was about.
Dean, who was just ambling over to the couch, ran into the coffee table and swore. “I… What… That’s not… Shut up.”
“What?” Castiel repeated and got elbowed in the ribs by Sam for that. Right, his shocked reaction had been reserved for when the doctor stated that he
He had just enough presence of mind to pull his dick out of Cas’ mouth but he didn’t have time to angle it away before he was coming all over Cas’ face, marking his omega with his scent in the most primitive way possible.
And—oh! They hadn’t even used a condom! They hadn’t planned on this going any further, and then things had just… happened naturally. At that point, Dean had been too busy trying to let Cas set the pace, trying to keep from coming prematurely, and all in all, he’d been too aroused to even think of the fact that he was about to fuck an omega in heat without a rubber.
Pulling Jimmy against his side and thus interrupting him in the middle of a sentence, he scented him almost aggressively.
Some of the alphas he fought were also coming here expecting to win the fight, overly confident and cocky, taunting him about how they’d make him their bitch. They were in for a surprise when Dean ended up being the one to fuck
After all the gentle nudging, it almost came as a surprise when Dean pushed the full length of his cock into Cas’ hole in one powerful thrust, fucking a surprised gasp out of him.
“But I was asleep, too,” Cas hastened to explain. “I didn’t mean to fall asleep, but when I woke up, we were all cuddled up with each other…” Yeah, Dean so wasn’t gonna comment on that part. “And I… I might have fed on you subconsciously…”
“Anyway, been tracking her ever since,” he went on. “But how do you even kill a witch ghost? Burning her bones didn’t do me any good, and oh yeah—witch-killing bullets go right through her. She isn’t tethered to any
It had been sort of a joke, and he had half expected Cas to start laughing (which he would have considered a win, too), but instead the smell of Cas’ slick hit his nose, and aroused him even further.
Before Castiel could bring up the fact that he had won the bet (something he hoped would get Dean to demand a rematch), Dean said, “But let’s prepare a nest for the next round. Much more comfortable.”
Just then, Hannah’s head shot up and she got a faraway look as if she could see through the ceiling.
As a matter of fact, Impala taking such good care of him had triggered Castiel’s pre-heat a bit early, which was very inconvenient. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise—if an omega was interested in an alpha as a potential mate and they were intimate with each other, it often sent the omega into heat. Only, he hadn’t even
Interestingly enough, Jimmy’s cheeks turned a nice shade of pink and he didn’t really say anything to that, apart from mumbling a few words none of them caught. He did glance at Dean, though, before looking down at his plate, cheeks still aflame. Something told Dean that it wasn’t because he had lost the alpha fight.
“What? I… you…” This was exactly why Castiel didn’t socialize. He was getting all flustered when someone didn’t react the way he had anticipated. But then he remembered that Dean was human and thus didn’t know what he was asking for. Regaining his composure, he decided to explain to the alpha that he had committed a faux pas, “Asking to see an angel’s wings is considered extremely rude.”
He was way too old to suddenly find out that he wasn’t exclusively into omegas. But here he was. In love with an alpha.
But he didn’t seem quite ready to give up on what he had believed in for the last three decades of his life, and so he nudged Dean and said, “Now your secret.”
It took him longer than he would like to admit to find Dean Winchester’s perfect match, but finally, months of hard work paid off: Lisa Braeden.
Something weird was going on with him and Dean, and since Cas couldn’t think straight when the alpha was around, he would have to figure this out away from Dean’s intoxicating scent.
Jimmy seemed just as happy to ignore what had transpired the night before as him, which was why it didn’t take them long to get back into their easy camaraderie. They had always just felt… comfortable in each other’s presence, so halfway through the meal, they were back to joking and laughing together like they had before Dean had put his foot in his mouth.
Finding the perfect spot to place a claiming bite was half the fun, especially since alternating between licking and blowing on his neck was making Cas squirm around in the cutest way. Giving Cas goosebumps of pleasure was quickly becoming his new favorite thing.
There was a beat of silence in which Dean just stared at him, and Castiel tried to figure out why his attempt at cheering the alpha up might not have worked as intended.
Dean was just about to pick any book at random when his eyes landed on one half-hidden behind a huge volume of some encyclopedia.
Instead of replying, Dean leaned over, cupped the back of Castiel’s neck and pulled him into a kiss, all soft and sweet. Castiel’s magic was most likely absorbing another wave of lunar energy because that fluttery feeling inside of him was back.
Plus, Cas had quickly realized that he couldn’t just cut Dean out of his life. A couple of days of no contact had been awful. He hadn’t been able to think of anything but Dean’s stiff shoulders and straight back as he had walked away from him, saying his last goodbye.
Bringing out all the tricks, he tickled it with the tip of his tongue and blew on it before licking with broader strokes and more intent, taking delight in feeling it swell under his ministrations.
What harm could it do to add some soft kisses to their scenting sessions? His omega’s heart would get broken anyway once Dean would leave. He might as well get what he wanted in the meantime.
Too exhausted for words, he licked Dean’s neck to tell him what an amazing job he had done. Dean licked him right back.
Not that Castiel would have been able to tell for sure that he was an alpha. He looked like one, but secondary gender was one more thing that you couldn’t know just from looking at someone. There were small alphas and big omegas… it was really all in the scent.
Good thing, probably. Alphas—at least omegasexual ones like himself—didn’t go around baring their necks. If they wanted to get a scenting session started, they reached out and touched the omega’s cheek, trying to direct him and seeing if they could get him to tilt his head, effectively baring
Over the next few days, Dean jerked off more than when he was in rut (well, not quite, but it came close). There was one fantasy that got him going effortlessly. He’d walk over to Jimmy’s and the other alpha would open the door, all disheveled from ‘taking care of his rut,’ and then he’d pull Dean inside and present for him. (Never mind that alphas didn’t present, but it was a fantasy, so he wasn’t looking for realism here.)
“It’s Gabe, jackass. How many omegas are you screwing anyway?” was apparently Gabe’s idea of an appropriate greeting.
Since he didn’t shut it in his face, but left it open, Dean took that as an invitation (or at least permission) to follow him inside.
If Jimmy had to deal with nightmares like these regularly on his own, Dean could understand why he had problems sleeping through the night.
sleeping together, of course, but really just sleeping. No funny business. Just to get in enough scenting time and stay healthy.
“So… uhm… Do you think…” Cas cleared his throat, still adorably flustered. “Is it too soon to ask if you want to go through with this?”
that he finally got to do what he had been dreaming about for what felt like ages—but he got a shy smile for his attempt at explaining himself anyway.
He quickly turned off the lights. Of course, that didn’t do any good—they had to have already seen that he was home.
Hoping Dean would assume his face was red because of the physical exertion, he went on the offensive, “Why are you surprised?
It did make him feel better, but only slightly since the thought of Dean cuddling with Inias was still making his skin crawl.
Luckily, Dean never felt offended by anything he said. He just huffed a laugh and retorted, “Look who’s talking.”
“I’m proud of you,” Dean said out of nowhere and Cas scooted away a couple of inches so that he could frown at him. “For yesterday,” Dean explained. “When you just… asked for what your omega needed.”
Cas had promised him he wouldn’t be meddling in his love life anymore. Not that Dean had meant for this to turn into anything more than a one-night stand. But that was the whole point. While Dean himself only wanted some fun, Cas, probably sitting up there in heaven somewhere, had decided to send a possible future mate his way, after Dean had made it perfectly clear that he didn’t appreciate having decisions made for him.
Keeping his eyes closed coincidentally also kept Dean from seeing how the moonlight was affecting him. His eyes tended to glow a bright blue when they were absorbing a supermoon’s power, and despite what Dean had said, he wasn’t sure if the hunter would appreciate seeing him like this.
Dean was sitting on his side of the bed because he had just put his cell phone on the nightstand to charge it, and Cas was standing a few feet away, but was now taking a tentative step forward.
But Dean was persistent and just opened the door even without an answer, and even though Castiel could have still pretended, he turned on the bedside lamp instead and sat up in bed. If he couldn’t fall asleep, he might as well confront the reason for his sleepless night.
“We should make sure there’s nothing for him to find. I mean, yes, it might be a bit inconvenient, but if we can get rid of him…”
was the big brother here—if anyone had the right to chew anyone out, it was supposed to work the other way around).
“I… I didn’t think it would affect you this much,” Cas said once Dean had managed to get his laughter under control. “You can touch if you want.”
Dean would start talking about his day before they got to the set of scenting-related questions. Then there was a half-hour break, during which Castiel had to scent something from a vial to ‘neutralize the scent.’ During that time, it was Castiel’s turn to talk about what was going on in his life.
He clicked on Bees again to see what his options were and was happy to find that he could touch the omega’s cock and bring him to orgasm too. He wasn’t sure if he just imagined it, but he thought he heard Bees’ breathing get a bit labored too.
Of course, he didn’t have an alpha number. But Cas had never used an Alpha Service before. So, how would he know how these things worked?
“Not touch, no. Scent. Only if you want me to find out what kind of curse she used on you, of course.”
I'm out of control. After weeks of not writing, I started again and now I'm back to posting too much. Sorry for the quick update again, but I'm really not good at sitting on finished chapters.
Dean ducked down to kiss Cas just as his knot caught and that was it. Cas came all over himself, his asshole fluttering uncontrollably around Dean’s cock, which began spurting his thick jism into him almost immediately.
It wasn’t like he suddenly didn’t like omegas anymore. He liked them just fine. That bartender wasn’t bad looking and Dean was definitely attracted to him—and he was one hundred percent omega. Maybe it had just been too long since he had gotten laid.
There were never any problems that Castiel could see when they were sleeping together, but without fail, Dean would turn up at his cabin again with the same complaint: The curse was still going strong.
He got up and for a moment, Castiel was afraid he might just walk away. But instead, he leaned closer and… helped him up a bit so that he could fluff his pillow. Castiel only now realized that his neck and back had started to cramp up.
According to Gabe, he had wanted to check out that new alpha in Cas’ life in person, which was what prompted his unplanned visit.
“How about you let me be your wingman for once?” the alpha asked the next night when Castiel stopped by.
“Yep. But not just any watch. Check this out. This baby monitors my heart rate and blood pressure, and even has a heart rate alarm that’ll wake you right up if something’s wrong. So, no need for calling emergency services anymore, you can just check the watch.”
The first time they held hands outside of their home, Sam looked at them curiously, but he kept his mouth shut when Dean glared at him hard enough. No reason to make Cas feel weird about his species’ customs. If that meant Dean had to hold his hand or snake his arm around his waist or scent mark him… then that was a sacrifice Dean was willing to make.
Since the last time Dean had tried to do something about it hadn’t ended well, they got into the habit of texting first.
Mortified because Dean had to turn him down, he contemplated changing doctors (and moving to a different state while he was at it). Only never seeing Dean again was not an option. He would much rather face a little bit of embarrassment if it meant he got to keep Dean in his life. If Dean still
There was some poking and prodding and pinching of his mating gland while the doctor was ‘hm’-ing and ‘ah’-ing before he took some blood.
A deep yearning had started spreading out from his heart, and Castiel could not make sense of it for one bit. Yes, he wished Dean would touch him, would groom his wings again and… do more. But that wasn’t all. He also wished that Dean could… that he could
From then on, they developed some kind of strange human-angel bond where they hung out regularly to talk about… pretty much anything and everything. He even got Cas to have the occasional beer with him, even though, apparently, angels didn’t drink.
It seemed like he would see Dean again some day. After all, visions tended to come true more often than not.
When he didn’t say anything else, Castiel was forced to guess, following his line of sight, “Your stomach?”
an alpha after giving him a hard fuck. You just sent them on their way with a sore, well-used hole filled with spunk.
Dean tried to doze for a while, but eventually, he kicked the blanket off and went to get a glass of water. Or maybe some warm milk to trick his body into calming down and forgetting all about kissable and scentable omegas.
“Sure, I can take you from behind. I can take you any way you want, babe.” Dean’s voice had gotten all low and Cas felt his heat flare. It was time.
Then he raised his eyebrows and said, “So, I hear you haven’t been able to scent anything. Let’s see how much of your sense of smell is gone.”
Even though Cas knew that Dean was just goofing around, probably thinking nothing of a platonic lingering kiss on the cheek between friends, he raised his hand as if in trance to touch his cheek.
thirty minutes, which was to be expected since he had been very motivated to make it there as fast as possible.
“Oh, that’s easy, especially if you’re in the presenting position. You just have to slap his hand away and pretend that you’re doing it yourself.”
Meanwhile, his wards seemed to be working fine. But maybe the hunter had simply moved on, since no other witch had turned up dead. Of course, every witch in the vicinity had reinforced their wards, so chances were the hunter was simply out of luck.
Dean gave up on getting the burger stain out of his shirt in favor of gaping at Sam, who rolled his eyes at him. “Gross. Get your mind out of the gutter. I’m talking about the insides of your wrists, the crook of your elbow, that kind of thing.”
Whatever he had been about to say couldn’t be too bad, though, since he was still scenting rather insistently.
That was his cue to send some submissive signals Dean’s way in an attempt to get him to give chase. He leaned backward until his back was against the arm of the couch, and tilted his neck a bit, just a little tease.
Right. Dean didn’t know about that yet. It seemed like it was Castiel’s turn to clue Dean in to some things…
Cas stared back at him for a moment, looking debauched and disheveled and so perfect. “Let’s pretend we’re real mates,” he suggested, his voice all fucked out and hoarse. “Just for tonight.”
Finally, he felt his balls pull up once more and this time, as he pumped another load into the omega, he didn’t deny his instincts to knot him good.
? He was a big, bad alpha, thank you very much. But his very own snugglebun was lying enclosed in his arms and was, according to himself, trying to show affection, so Dean felt his heart swell anyway. He leaned over and placed a kiss to Cas’ neck.
Further research revealed that omegas who had scent-bonded with an alpha would daydream about his scent (check), miss the alpha when he wasn’t around (check), and experience the urge to scent-mark the alpha as well as enjoy getting scent-marked by them (check and check).
Eventually, they made a deal. Castiel would keep providing slick—but only for the alpha who had been in before. The one who was in rut right now and needed it badly. (The one whose scent was driving Castiel wild—but he didn’t mention that part.)
His explanation did nothing to get rid of the confused frown on Cas’ face. “I don’t understand how that relates to you judging me for considering an alpha service.”
“You know what?” Dean suddenly remembered. “We never really got to finish with your back. We should check if the lotion did any good and reapply.”
. Yep, it was as adorable as it sounded and the best part was that Dean got to tease Cas for it mercilessly.
Cas didn’t seem to be tracking right, his eyes unfocused and glazed over, and he just let Dean do whatever he wanted.
“Are you still nervous?” Cas asked after a moment of comfortable silence. “Your heartbeat isn’t slowing down.”
Castiel took a few steps closer to join the circle, and Anael spoke up, “You can’t tell us about a witch gone rogue and then vanish and not react to any attempts at establishing telepathic communication.”
The omega was even more beautiful in person if that was at all possible. Then again, it might just seem like it because when Castiel opened the door, the sweet scent of omega in heat reached Dean’s nostrils.
That’s why Dean’s resolve not to flirt with Cas too much wasn’t going so well. But since Cas was completely oblivious, he figured that was okay. After all, Cas wouldn’t pick up on the fact that someone was flirting with him if that someone performed a naked mating dance for him.
That didn’t seem to be the most polite way to welcome someone back from certain death. It did seem like the
“Yes, of course.” Cas took a step back and looked at him as if he wanted to say something else. But instead, he just said, “Goodbye, Dean.” Those were the last words Cas spoke to him before he got into his car and drove off.
Castiel on the other hand was just the omega he was fake mated to, not someone Dean would consider being intimate with. He probably liked omegas who got all of his references and enjoyed talking about cars.
It paid off when Dean’s fingers tentatively closed around his, finally taking his hand and intertwining their fingers.
The couch was a bit small for three people, but Castiel couldn’t very well crowd Sam, so he only scooted over a tiny bit, staying within scenting range of Dean.
“I seem to have fallen asleep last night,” he said. “I’m sorry for occupying your bed. You should have woken me.”
He didn’t care much about what movie Dean had decided to watch to keep himself entertained for the hour, but at least the alpha kept commenting on things. His deep, familiar voice made Cas feel safe. Safe enough to close his eyes as he kept taking in the scent of comfort, and security, and home…
“Yeah,” Dean agreed before he could even finish that thought, already getting rid of clothes because Cas didn’t need to sell him on that idea.
Taking a deep breath, he plowed on, “Look, I’ll try, but… it’s not like I can just turn it off, okay?”
“What do you want?” At least, talking to Gabe finally made his feathers lie back down in an orderly fashion.
“That doesn’t even make any sense,” Castiel told him before stealing another kiss. He had no idea how long that would still be allowed and fall under the category of ‘strange post-coital hormones are making them do it.’
But they weren’t just scent-bond partners anymore. Did that mean that he could ask Dean to stay with him during his approaching heat? And was he ready for that? He wasn’t scared of Dean’s alpha even a little bit and he trusted Dean with his life.
“I’m sure you’ll get cured eventually,” Castiel tried to reassure him. Of course, he knew that for a fact, but he couldn’t very well tell Dean that he’d seen himself perform oral sex on him and that the alpha’s penis had worked just fine then. Or rather was
What was it with this omega?! Dean had never told anyone such an honest answer to that question in his life (himself included). Normally, he would say thing like he was bad with kids or he liked his independent lifestyle. Of course, the fact that he had never met an omega he could see himself settling down with played a role, but it wasn’t the only reason he had never let himself think about pups.
“You smell like home, that’s just the kind of calming scent I need. I noticed you don’t have a mating mark, but none of the applicants are mated, and my brother made me aware that mated alphas probably aren’t interested in letting omegas who aren’t their mate scent them. As long as we are clear on the fact that this is just a transaction, nothing more than a scenting, it’s okay with me that you are not mated. Plus, I’ve been at it for over an hour and am tired of having to interview alphas. So, if you don’t have any questions…”
“I’m comfortable,” Dean quickly said. “Apparently, they’re using this form of scent therapy in Europe all the time, so… you know, no biggie.”
“Yes, I’m sure,” Dean replied, maybe a bit too harshly, but this sex shop guy was starting to get on his nerves. He didn’t want his masturbation habits to be examined by some stranger, who, as a beta, had no idea of what it was like to go through rut without a mate if he didn’t want to go looking for a one-rut stand.
“Guess we’ll have to have lots more sex to get that option back,” Impala said, all casual and teasing.
Jimmy seemed to hesitate, so Dean continued, “Why not leave it off just for the night? We could engage in a little bit of scent play.” He softly stroked across Jimmy’s scent gland as he said that, delighted at the way Jimmy closed his eyes and seemed to just melt against him.
“Wish I could say the same.” Damn but if that rasp didn’t make things way too obvious. At least Cas wasn’t able to smell Dean’s… interest in the proceedings.
“I’m sorry, I assumed…” The doctor glanced at Dean before turning back to Cas. “Going through pregnancy heat alone can be tough, but there are ways to make it easier. If possible, you should have something with the biological alpha’s scent nearby. There are some toys that have been manufactured with pregnant omegas in mind. And of course there’s always the option of calling an alpha service. The alphas are trained to take care of a pregnant omega in heat, too.”
Taking in the sleeping alpha as he tightened his hold on him in his sleep, Cas felt a rush of affection wash through him. ‘For life’ sounded nice. He wanted to have this for himself so much, he physically ached for it.
All Castiel had to do was bare his throat in a vulnerable display and push his ass back against Dean until his knot caught on the rim, and Dean went wild. He even forgot to change positions. This was the moment he usually turned Castiel onto his belly to finish off inside of him, but this time, his eyes flitted back and forth between Castiel’s neck and his spent dick while he fucked him until his knot caught and he came inside of him.
More than that, the alpha blanketed him with his own body and started gently stroking his hips and sides—a stark contrast to the hard fuck from before. Castiel was being… cuddled. There was no other word for it. The alpha cuddled and comforted him with soft strokes along his sides and slow licks across the bite mark he had left on his mating gland, and Castiel felt so much better than he ever had after sex, even though his asshole was sore and his whole world had just shifted.
It shouldn’t have come as a surprise. After all, he was regularly getting naked (for the community shower) with an alpha who was—let’s face it—a great provider who was sweet and funny, yet strong and manly, who was a good listener and took good care of him. Basically, Dean was the whole package.
He had to chase those thoughts away when it was time to go to Zachariah’s office. He practiced his shocked gasp for when the doctor pronounced that he wasn’t mated, and then they were on their way.
Even though last time, he had just gone ahead and fucked the omega without so much as chatting him up, this was somehow more nerve wrecking. For one, it was way more deliberate than double clicking on him to teach him a lesson during their usual back-and-forth banter.
He realized the full extent of how much being robbed of his magic sucked when he had regained enough energy to get out of bed, but couldn’t use magic to do simple tasks like brewing coffee or heating the water for a shower. Checking his magic levels, he tried conjuring up a ball of light in his palm, but all he got was a slight flicker.
Now that the moment was here, he suddenly wasn’t feeling as confident, though. Still, he asked, “May I use your bathroom?”
Castiel was tempted to just say ‘no’ and be done with it. He was pretty sure that it wouldn’t have made a difference anyway, but he hesitated a second too long, and when Sam’s inquisitive eyes returned to his, he went with the truth instead, “I haven’t scented an alpha.”
One of these days, Dean was going to chase him down and just fuck that haughty attitude out of him! Teasing little shit!
“No, I didn’t.” He had assumed an alpha would know how to mount an omega who was presenting for him. But if Dean needed some visual aids… “But I can make a quick sketch.”
“Seriously, what the hell?” Dean repeated since Castiel still hadn’t answered him. “This some kind of weird witch thing?”
Looking back over at Dean, he realized with a sinking feeling that their journey together had come to an end. Of course, he was glad that the evil witch had been taken care of and couldn’t hurt anyone else. But with their mission completed—no curse to lift, no witch to find and neutralize—there was really nothing keeping a hunter and a witch working together anymore.
Inias didn’t start feeding immediately. Instead, he began scenting a bit, and Dean supposed it was only polite to scent back. But even though Inias was an omega, Dean’s alpha didn’t like what he smelled, so he lied, “I’m not really into scenting,” which got Inias to stop getting too cozy with his scent gland.
If Cas’ scenting should make his dick misbehave, and Cas picked up on the scent of alpha arousal, Dean could simply blame the book.
Holding his hands above Hannah’s wound, he desperately tried to conjure up some healing magic, but his magic was too weak and the wound didn’t close.
Bingo. There was just the slightest bit of hesitation before Cas’ head tilted to the side. Yeah, his reflexes were definitely working perfectly, especially for an omega without his sense of smell.
But for now, he had to try and focus. He had promised Impala he would do this quest with him and he wouldn’t let his heat get in the way.
Finally, Dean couldn’t hold back anymore and he breached Cas. No matter how loose Cas had seemed, Dean’s huge prick was gripped tight by his channel nevertheless and Dean had to work his way inside.
“Yes. Right. So, I thought, y’know, let’s just move past the embarrassing moment because neither of us could really be held responsible and—” He interrupted himself and then said, “There
Dean had not heard from Cas since he had gone into heat. The rest of their pre-heat scent date had been awkward to say the least. At the end, when they had said their goodbyes, Cas had said that he would call him after his heat.
On his last supply run to the sex shop before his next rut, he made sure to stock up on everything he might need. The most important thing was the slick, of course. But he also bought four boxes of condoms, just in case his plan to pick up a beta as a stand-in for his omega worked out, as well as two fleshlights (in case he broke another one) and some toys just because. He was long since done feeling embarrassed about what he bought here.
Damn, he was starting to feel like he was talking to Cas here. How explicit did he have to get for Sam to understand what he was talking about?
They stayed like that for a while. The feeling of connectedness really was overwhelming. Maybe Dean had some distant cuddlibus genes in him as well because—yeah, this felt great. He could cuddle Cas all day long.
His ‘don’t anger the hunter’ approach had gone out the window the moment an innocent person was at risk. Maybe this was what made the dominoes start falling. The final straw that would lead Dean to eventually go after him, too.
This time, he did drop his keys. The spell broken, he quickly picked them up, fumbled with the lock and hurried inside.
, Jimmy’s arms around him and his calm scent made his alpha quiet down some. Come to think of it, he really wouldn’t have the first clue where to even start looking for those monsters. Plus, his omega needed him here.
Zachariah’s eyes landed on his neck, and Cas quickly fiddled with the collar of his shirt, trying to hide the very obvious proof of what he and Dean had done while the agents had guarded the house.
“Who’s there again?” Castiel asked, distracted by coming up with possible excuses for why they needed to keep doing what they had been doing the last few days, even though no one was in rut or heat.
With Cas, he had almost been disappointed whenever he stopped feeding. With Inias, he was relieved. Now they could finally go to sleep and in the morning, Dean would have his proof that cuddling through the night was harmless.
Dean’s eyes were trained on him and there was suddenly something in them… Something that Castiel had seen before a few times. It was hard to look away from Dean when that happened, and it usually led to them staring deep into each other’s eyes for an amount of time normal people might consider inappropriate.
“Yeah, well, Castiel hasn’t talked about you a lot, either,” Dean retorted. “Isn’t this the first time he’s ever been to your house?”
Once or twice, Castiel even managed to tell his mood just by looking at him. He had to observe Dean more closely for that, but without his scent to rely on, Castiel was definitely getting better at reading facial expressions.
Even if they never found him, just knowing that he stood a chance against them would make him feel so much safer. Plus, Dean usually taught omegas, so if other omegas could profit from Dean’s lessons, so could he.
on me! That’s just… That’s not cool, man,” he said, one hand still on his face while the other was patting his shoulder for some reason, and then he just left his hand there, a comfortable weight anchoring him.
Sore loser or not, Dean did keep his word. He sauntered over to the couch and sat his naked butt down, waiting for Castiel to join him.
At first, Castiel had been puzzled and maybe a little bit fascinated when he had flown in on Dean watching a naked alpha making love to an equally naked omega while Dean himself was stroking his own erect penis.
But he caught himself in time, remembering Dean’s ridiculous cover for how they knew each other, and just said, “Maybe.”
It still didn’t make complete sense. Why would Dean tell them he was in a sexual relationship with him when he knew he couldn’t reveal that Cas was an omega?
I’ve had this lying around for a while and since I haven’t written anything all week, I thought I’d post this, see if there’s interest.
Soon, the prank signs of affection didn’t seem enough anymore, and Dean found himself telling Cas ridiculous things like, “You’re kind of cute when you’re asleep, you know?” or “Okay, not only when you’re asleep.”
The trademark tilt of the head told Dean that Cas was trying to figure out the reason for his accusing tone of voice.
Castiel was not in the mood to hide in someone else’s bathroom, even if that someone was his mate. Especially since there was no reason for it. It wasn’t like he planned on telling Dean’s brother that they were mated and enjoyed the occasional romp in the sheets.
When Dean excused himself to the bathroom, he took a little detour to put a small bottle of the scar cream into Jimmy’s trench coat pocket. He had attached a note that told Jimmy he could come over for a massage any time—which, sure, wasn’t any different to what they usually did, but he hoped that after everything, this should make his intentions clear.
smell Cas’ excitement—but that also meant that he had to tighten the reins on his alpha urges. After all, his alpha didn’t just want to fuck his own fist.
So, when Cas offered to let Dean return the favor, he was instantly all for that plan. Cas’ shirt joined Dean’s on the floor and then there was no annoying fabric between them anymore. Getting to hug Cas half-naked, skin-on-skin contact and all, felt amazing. As did scenting his way to Cas’ nipples and then letting his tongue dart out for a quick taste.
Of course, the doctor was present in Zachariah’s office, but so was Michael, which was just typical.
Castiel’s insides ran cold. He had been sure Dean had been oblivious to his feelings. Then again, he had been floating a few inches above the ground in Dean’s presence a lot. As far as obvious ‘witch in love’ signals went, that one was a neon sign that might have clued Dean in. He shouldn’t have relied too heavily on Dean’s ignorance concerning a witch’s magic.
. Just, you’re not an omega, so…” When he saw the smirk on Jimmy’s face, he stopped his babbling and rolled his eyes. “You’re an ass.”
By the third week, they had gotten into a routine. At the beginning of the session, Castiel would let Dean pull him into the correct scenting position, and it even got easier to find his scent gland without scenting for it. After all, he’d done it a few times and knew Dean’s neck well enough by now.
In a sort of quid pro quo arrangement, they both ended up shirtless, and Castiel could finally scent along Dean’s torso without any annoying barriers. Feeling Dean’s skin against his own made his nose tingle with a renewed determination to find the source of the scent.
All was well, he had his crush well and truly under control, when his brother came by one day just when Dean arrived.
Oh, right. Dean wasn’t here to just keep staring into his eyes. (Too bad.) He had put a piece of paper on the counter, and Castiel took it and skimmed the list of ingredients.
“No, I… Come in. I just had one of those days,” he explained with a wave of his hand and stepped aside to let Dean in before he closed the door.
They were quite the pair—plenty of abandonment issues to go around between the two of them. But together, they’d work through it. They just had to show each other that they’d stick around.
Since the comparison to an omega had already been established in his mind, his instincts told him to cuddle and soothe this alpha. After all, he had just been fucked within an inch of his life, maybe even for the first time, and he had done so well, letting Dean take the lead, even though his alpha instincts had to have told him to try and be the one on top.
Just to make sure his post-rut scent didn’t trigger a panic attack for Cas, Dean decided to stay away a couple of days longer, and instead called Sam to whine about the fact that he missed Cas’ scent.
He had been so focused on not falling in love with Dean (an endeavor he had failed in spectacularly) that he hadn’t even realized that he had put down roots here—found a place where he belonged, people he trusted.
While still rocking into him, Dean embraced him and kissed him on the neck, on his mating gland, maybe a bit of a possessive display, but he was allowed. His cock was buried in the omega who was carrying his pup after all. If this wasn’t the time for possessive displays, he didn’t know what was.
That was the beauty of his plan. It would show Cas once and for all that he didn’t pose a danger to him. Dean and Inias would cuddle through the entire night and then the next day, Cas would see that nothing bad had happened, that he’d been worrying for nothing, and then Dean could go back to cuddling with
And just like that they went back to scenting each other tenderly. Since contact apparently helped, Dean made sure to touch Cas, one hand on the small of his back, gently stroking the omega, the other tangled in his hair solely for an easier scenting position.
Dean fucked him for a long time after that, alternating between doing him slow and deep, and speeding up to a hard and fast rhythm, only holding off when they were close to orgasm.
Cas still wasn’t in heat. Dean had really been looking forward to getting frisky with this omega today. Being around Cas all day had made him horny and he had hoped to be able to relieve the pent-up sexual energy tonight.
“Dean, I... I can’t,” he said, his mind still clouded by the pleasure Dean had given him, his mating gland still tingling from the memory of the alpha’s mouth on it.
Of course it helped. An omega in heat would always seek out an alpha’s touch. The only question was for how long a simple hug in a dream would be enough.
When they came together for the second time that night, it was with a mixture of possessive urges and a sense of belonging. Dean knotted him this time and continued kissing him long after he had climaxed inside of him.
He would definitely prefer staying in bed with Cas all day, but obviously, that only made him reckless. He should really rein in his flirting energy and stop coming on to his best friend, who was only trying to help him out.
That had been good enough for him back then, but now some more research was in order if he wanted to show Cas that they could cuddle as much as they wanted without repercussions. And Dean definitely wanted to cuddle that omega some more.
Dean was already in bed and Cas was just padding in from the bathroom, barefoot and in nothing but the oversized shirt.
The next time he fucked Cas, they did it face-to-face, which meant Dean got to see the expression of bliss on Cas’ face, even though the angel bit his lower lip, probably in an attempt to keep from begging Dean to fuck him harder.
“May I?” he asked, barely above a whisper, and Castiel didn’t even know what he was asking, but he nodded nevertheless.
Instead, here they were, snuggling together in their nest, and when Dean had been aroused to the point where he had no doubt wanted to plunge his cock into Cas’ hole, he’d had to masturbate instead.
They were silent for a moment. Cas had no idea how to explain that having Dean so close, doing those intimate things with him was sending his omega all the wrong signals. That it just made Cas’ instincts go haywire with the need to kiss him back, to lick him all over, to encourage him to bite harder…
“I want to mate you. It’s just… Getting mated was something I was scared of for a long time. You know, alphas mating omegas in heat against their will is a thing. And yesterday, I was very aware of the fact that what we were doing was supposed to end in a mating bond, and… my omega got a little spooked, that’s all. So, maybe we should do it during my next heat, after all.”
He was still carrying the alpha’s shirt. Maybe that’s what had clued him in. Only, the alpha wasn’t looking at the shirt at all, but was still eye-fucking him across the room.
Cas perked up at that. That was fantastic news! It meant that Dean had enjoyed what they had just done as much as he had! And that they could do it again as often as they wanted!
Maybe it was because it was Jimmy. They were friends. Of course, holding him and comforting him didn’t feel weird. But some part of him knew that if this were Benny, it would most definitely be weird.
to have sex with. Someone who would treat him right. Someone who would take care of him and make it unforgettable for him. And if it took him another millennium or two to find that someone, then who was Dean to meddle in his affairs? After all, Cas had promised to back off playing matchmaker for the time being, so Dean should treat him with the same respect.
“Yes,” Cas agreed. “Good call. With the practicing.” With those words, the omega got up and went to his room.
the moment of true submission: when they gave in to their omega instincts, their eyes turned golden. No way to fake that. Of course, there were some videos that had been edited to make it look like the color of their eyes changed, but you could spot the fake ones easily enough.
Instead of reacting taken aback by that proclamation, Dean smiled at him. “Great! I don’t really enjoy it either. So, how about we skip the small talk and see what we can do about lunch?”
When Gabe hung up with a huff, Dean quickly texted Cas that he had pissed off his brother before Gabe could badmouth him.
“Hannah can’t do that. She said you could keep working there if you got help. You’re getting help. Plus, it’s been months since you had an attack that severe. It was just bad luck.”
The smell of the omega slick was a bit distracting, so Dean leaned forward and stopped his thrusts, cock buried deep inside of Cas, to nibble along the back of his neck until he reached his scent gland.
“I… didn’t find an amenable alpha.” Truth was, he didn’t know any alphas he could ask. It wasn’t like you could walk up to a stranger on the street and ask permission to scent.
Not that he had really doubted it after his encounter with Castiel. Any hunter worth his salt could scent out a lying son of a bitch, and Dean was especially proud of his scenting abilities. What he had gotten from Cas had been nothing but sincerity. Well, and bewilderment, but that was most likely due to the fact that he didn’t interact with humans a lot, it seemed.
Castiel had never felt as weak in the knees as he did when Dean and he shared that ‘practice kiss.’ He hadn’t known that being kissed by someone could feel that amazing!
He quickly pushed down his pants and boxers and closed his eyes when he began palming himself, just barely suppressing a groan. The pre-heat scent was
Cas was feeling more than comfortable being touched that way by Dean, his hands kneading the back of his neck, working his way to his shoulders, firm yet gentle touches that made Cas all pliant and drowsy.
peaceful species), and when they had the choice between fight and flight, they would always opt for flight.
Dean, meanwhile, could hardly move. He’d picked up on Cas’ scent before—how could he not? He was in the dude’s home often enough. And what he’d smelled had been… intriguing to say the least. Smelling someone because you were in their personal space and really
Sam mumbled something that sounded like “I bet” and then promptly tripped over Dean’s foot while getting up.
“Please stop talking,” said Jimmy, who seemed almost as uncomfortable by what Dean was saying as he was himself.
Plus, Dean had not liked the way the alpha had looked at Cas one bit. Like he was the best kind of snack. Dean might have gotten a bit territorial there for a second, but he should get credit for holding his alpha back from getting into an alpha fight. (Okay, if the alpha hadn’t walked away just then, that might have happened anyway, but still.)
Rather well, as it turned out, since Dean didn’t let him get too far in his head worrying about the life he’d left behind.
Castiel had gotten as much use out of scenting the plaid shirt as he could and now that he had washed it, he should bring it back to Gabe’s shop and pick up a new one. Or, well, old one. One that had been worn by the alpha and was carrying his scent.
(not alphas, no matter how cute). There was plenty of evidence for how un-attracted Dean was to Jimmy.
With Jimmy securely in his arms, his alpha settled down enough for Dean to think clearly. Well, ‘clearly’ might be an exaggeration since his thoughts were still pretty much a whirlwind of messy confusion. As were his emotions. Naturally, there was no way he could fall asleep right now with his thoughts running in circles like they were training for a marathon.
From the sound of it, their charade seemed to be working. Raphael had probably picked up on Castiel’s ever-growing infatuation with Dean.
While they were waiting for his knot to go down once again, they were kissing some more because it was lots of fun and omegas in heat enjoyed the more intimate parts of a fuck session.
He felt like he had been punched in the gut. How could he go from having Cas, getting to sleep next to him and scent him as much as he wanted, no
Castiel still didn’t quite understand what had prompted all the yelling, but it could probably be traced back to when Amelia had found an internet site on his laptop—which, in hindsight, he should have deleted from his history.
“He’s waiting for a treat,” Castiel informed him because as much fun as it was watching Dean try to fend off Justin, he had to help the hunter out. He had probably never used a crow to deliver a message before, and thus didn’t know the customs.
Going from being careful to never accidentally touch Cas to touching him with intent all the time was strange, but awesome.
Although, he had embarrassed himself in front of them even before that little stunt. Now that he had some distance to Dean’s alluring scent, he couldn’t believe that he had almost invited the alpha to
—had taken him, it had been against his will, and when he had tried to fight them off, they had been very rough. He hadn’t even slicked, so of course it had hurt a lot.
Dean had offered to stay for an hour, which gave Cas plenty of time to soak up his scent. Of course, his pup was his top priority. That was the whole reason they were here together in the first place.
Dean was kissing him in the most intimate of places, slowly dragging his tongue around his asshole before dipping it into it.
Cas didn’t seem inclined to provide him with a list of alphas he’d sleep with, though. Instead, he said, giving him the squint eye, “Do you want to tell me what my sexuality is?”
Unfortunately, they took the anonymity of their customers very seriously and weren’t helpful in the slightest.
Unfortunately, wondering and daydreaming was all he could do since angels simply weren’t wired that way. They could analyze human emotions, yes, but they were unable to feel them.
He stopped snuggling against Dean in order to look at him, something hesitant in his eyes as if Dean might actually say that he was mistaken.
“That’s what was missing. I tried to imagine your scent earlier. There’s this one component I was missing. Like the cover of an old, leather-bound book.”
After another few minutes had ticked by, Dean had to admit to himself that he had not thought this all the way through when he had agreed to this.
Only—during the next couple days, he could think of nothing but that delicious-smelling slick. It got to the point where he’d daydream about it at work and he’d be horny basically nonstop.
“Yes, let’s go to bed,” he said and got up to follow Dean to his bedroom, which was slowly starting to become ‘their’ bedroom.
“Hello,” the stranger greeted him with a deep voice—all alpha, which was an instant turn on. He was eyeing Dean’s naked body with an appreciative glance at his dick, which was already half-hard just thinking about what he was going to do to him.
So, Castiel sprinted out the door and as soon as he was free from that room, flew down to Dean’s bedroom.
Something else Dean had learned about Cas: He was very cuddly. As soon as Dean had initiated the new round of scenting, Cas huddled closer and nestled up against him.
For the second round, they relocated to Dean’s bed, got rid of the rest of their clothes, and it was much more tender now that the edge had been taken off. Castiel was on his back and they kept looking deep into each other’s eyes as Dean was penetrating him in long, deep strokes, his hands sliding all over Castiel’s naked skin, almost reverently.
“I’m Dean, by the way,” the alpha said, as he made himself comfortable on the couch, leaning back with his arms spread out against the back of it.
“Stop thinking too much,” Sam said. “You have to let your alpha and omega out a bit more to make this work. Follow their instincts.”
“Sleep well?” he asked once Cas had released his arm, apparently satisfied with what the watch had told him.
There were also quite a few things Dean could tell Cas that a background check hadn’t been able to reveal. They talked about favorite books and TV shows and before long, the hour was almost up.
As he was bleeding out, a beam of light made him peek to see colorful magic shoot through the air. All the magic the witch had stolen set free upon her death. Castiel breathed in his own magic like a drowning man gasping for air. It was too late now, but he would rather die as himself, magic and all.
Why was Dean wearing a shirt in their nest anyway? That didn’t make a lot of sense, so Cas helped him get rid of it.
This time, he knew what to do and immediately sought out those oil glands to massage them gently, tease out that delicious-smelling oil again. When they were dripping wet, he leaned down to sneak a taste, letting his tongue lap at one of the glands, which made Cas shudder and moan. Such a responsive omega!
None of those things did anything to calm Cas down in any way. His omega was more terrified than he had ever been when he had still been used by alphas. Now that he’d had a taste of freedom, he couldn’t imagine ever going back there.
What was Cas doing? It seemed like he was using Dean’s trick to ‘accidentally on purpose’ scent-mark him. But he had no reason to scent-mark Dean. Plus, Cas wasn’t that subtle, surely.
When he wasn’t busy getting Dean to kiss him and… do stuff to him, they were spending a lot of time in the library. There were so many books to explore that Castiel could stay there perusing them for hours.
It had started with a video of two alphas and an omega, but the more taboo videos of just two alphas with no omega in sight had soon piqued his interest. Even just seeing the alphas kiss each other while getting naked was more exciting than watching an alpha push into some omega over and over again.
“I’m just sayin’, you show up there with some painted-on claim on your neck, people will figure it out,” Dean explained. “I think the best plan here is the simplest: you show up with a
But Dean completely ignored his attempt at communicating with him and instead said, “Hold this!” as he threw something at him.
Their first kiss as a mated couple. Well, that wasn’t quite true. Their first kiss as a mated couple while neither of them was under the illusion that it was just fake.
The alpha put his penis into him many more times until the aching inside his asshole finally stayed away for good, and Dean explained that he was ‘out of heat.’
Something else they hadn’t done since the cabin was spend the night together. Cas had wanted to ask Dean a few times to stay over, but every time Dean said “I better get going,” or “Whoops, gettin’ late,” he lost his nerve.
That’s why he’d never used an omega service before. He’d usually just hook up with an omega for his rut. Rut flings got him all through his twenties and thirties and there was nothing wrong with it, it just got… a bit repetitive as time wore on.
Of course, he couldn’t say any of those things without freaking Dean out big time, so he stayed silent.
There seemed to be a direct link between Cas’ mating gland and his ass because the tickling sensation shot right through his body and made his hole convulse around Dean’s cock, eliciting another moan from the alpha. The tingling in his belly intensified and moved deep down into his ass and between his thighs to his dick. His heat demanded for the alpha whose cock was thrusting into him to ejaculate inside of him.
They had breakfast together as always, but with the knowledge that they might be watched through the window, they put on their fake mate act.
It didn’t even matter that all Dean would be able to scent was a fake scent that wasn’t even his. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t supposed to go around scenting alphas in the first place. At this point, his omega instincts had taken over and all they wanted was scent and be scented.
Jimmy, who had gotten up from the couch, paused for a moment, looking stunned. Oh right, Dean was probably not supposed to even know about those nightmares to begin with.
“Sorry about that,” the alpha said, voice rough with rut-induced arousal. “I’ve come like five times in the last hour and nothing felt right. This is the first time it actually helped.”
So, he watched Cas leave with the others, even though he’d have preferred if he had stayed for a while longer.
Luckily, Cas didn’t seem to have noticed his slip. As usual when he showed him a new cuddle technique, he maneuvered Dean into the right position and just started cuddling him.
One evening, only a couple of days later when Dean was just working the lotion into Jimmy’s back—his scars actually did start to look better, Dean was happy to note—he crossed the fine line between teasing a friend and freaking said friend out by coming on too strong.
“Find something you like?” Dean asked, an amused tone to his voice. He had one arm behind his head and the other hand was on Castiel’s head, playing with his hair.
Not that he had wanted to initiate a scenting or anything. He was just trying to figure out what was up with the fact that Jimmy’s scent had been less strong than usual, that was all.
And just like that, Dean’s scent lost its nervous edge and returned to normal, which meant that they could go back to doing what they were here for.
Having Dean’s hands on him, stroking reassuringly across his back, helped keep him grounded. The fact that Dean smelled like ‘alpha who had claimed him’ made him want to crawl into him or at least get as close as possible.
Satiated, Dean placed a last kiss between Cas’ wings before he rolled them over so that he was spooning Cas from behind. He just wanted to relax from the strenuous activities when he felt something weird in Cas’ hole. Was it getting dry?
For his part, Dean didn’t have any problems reaching over to softly graze his thumb over Castiel’s mating gland, checking out what he had to work with.
“This feels so much better than being rooted to the same spot for centuries,” she said, interrupting Dean in the middle of his protest that Sam had not invented the ‘Glad you’re alive’ speech.
As always during rut, his knot was forming way too quickly and Dean’s instincts to fill and knot the hole he was fucking took over.
Now that Cas wasn’t afraid to cuddle him and let himself be cuddled in return, he actually took initiative and showed Dean some other cuddle positions. Apparently, there was a lot Dean could learn from Cas about how best to cuddle. It was mindboggling how many positions there were, but trust a cuddlibus to know them all.
Then there were the scars, of course, but Dean knew some of his cover story about his abusive ex, so Cas could always explain it away with his ex having gotten a bit rough. That might be a bit of an understatement, of course.
Dean suspected he knew why Cas hadn’t called. He had obviously figured out that Dean had beaten off to his scent and was disgusted by it.
He got along with his new colleagues, Gabe wasn’t as annoying to live with as he had feared, and then there were Dean and his friends.
Cas should really clarify that he wasn’t trying to lead the alpha on. Lying securely in Dean’s arms didn’t seem like the best moment for it, though. Snuggling against the strong arms holding him close, Cas closed his eyes instead.
Castiel couldn’t get enough of Dean’s cuddles. This was the most tender scenting session yet. They had opted for Castiel’s bed so that they would be more comfortable, and scenting interspersed with kissing was
It wasn’t like Cas was all that invested in sex, anyway. Dean had been the one to introduce him to porn when they had been in their
By Monday evening at six, Castiel was starting to get nervous. Granted, he’d been nervous all day, but the closer his gaming date with Impala got, the more his nerves were starting to act up.
To make matters worse, there was no way he would get Dean to scent him back now, with Dean as stiff as a board.
When there was a knock on his door a couple of days later, his mood picked up immediately and he rushed to the door…
Supernatural beings had to stick together. He wouldn’t just stand by and watch Dean kill her because of her species.
Cas was tidying up when he found it—Dean had gotten into the habit of leaving more and more things at his place. That was okay; Cas had some things lying around at Dean’s place, too.
Sam was trying to give feedback, but trying to follow his direction just led to bumping noses and mumbled ‘sorry’s.
As a paramedic, Dean knew all about physiological responses and reflexes. There had been a whole seminar he’d had to take about neck baring as part of his training.
“Seriously, how are you messing this up? With those looks and that scent, all you have to do is sit there and let them pick you up. Hang on, that alpha over there has been eying you all night. Just look at him and nod for him to come over.”
“See you in a few days?” Cas asked timidly, biting at his bottom lip. Maybe he was afraid Dean was about to come on to him.
I'm always so sad that people who read the fic weeks, months or years after I posted it, don't tend to comment on it. I love getting comments on 'older' fics (although I wouldn't consider this one old. An 'old' fic would be one that was posted 10 years ago). Even if it's just a short comment, it will be greatly appreciated! So if you made it this far, please consider taking the additional 20 seconds to leave a comment.
Dean had hidden his penis from view, which was a shame because something about seeing Dean’s hand wrapped around it had left Castiel’s wings all aflutter.
But of course, Cas wouldn’t challenge him for any omega since he was alphasexual. There was no omega to fight over anyway.
Usually, he didn’t like being touched, which was why he rarely let other people close enough to offer physical comfort. With Dean, though, he didn’t mind. Well, that was a lie. He actually
scent. His awesome-smelling omega! Dulled by the fake scent, of course, but unmistakably there. The scent he had half fallen in love with that first time he had thought Jimmy’d had someone over for his rut. But of course, he hadn’t been in rut. He’d been in
All of that shot through Cas’ mind in the blink of an eye and made it perfectly clear what he had to do here.
His scent must have turned surprised because Cas elaborated, “What, you thought I would let an alpha into my home without doing research first? I googled you.” After a beat of silence, he added, “And let my brother run a background check on you.”
Cas had never shown interest in anyone and had never slept with any alpha (or anyone else) as far as Dean knew, so he had assumed… But after recent events, he wasn’t so sure anymore.
Finally, he gave his own stiff cock a few long strokes, lubing it up before he hoisted Cas’ legs up onto his shoulders. Then he lined his cock up with Cas’ well-greased hole, and pushed into him with one quick stroke.
Instead, while he was surfing the internet, visiting his favorite porn site, a popup window with an ad for a fertility ranch caught his eye. Maybe tricking his alpha wasn’t the right way to go about it, after all. He skimmed the information given and then clicked on the ad, which took him to the site of the fertility ranch.
“You overslept!” Cas said in an accusing tone of voice. “I thought…” He trailed off, shook his head, and tried again, “You never sleep this long!”
This was usually his favorite part about his job. The moment they smelled each other for the first time, looking deep into each other’s eyes as the hormones in their brains made them fall in love. He had always found it utterly fascinating.

He didn’t sleep with people, period. But apparently, Dean had been worried for nothing, and even if Balthazar

He had expected Jimmy to turn around and leave, but the other alpha was still standing there, eyes glued to Dean, and then—he fumbled with his pajama pants and started touching himself, never breaking eye contact.
“There’s something weird about you today,” Gabe commented, still with that narrow-eyed look. But then he added, “Bring it by the shop when you’re finished,” and finally left, unfortunately taking some of that awesome scent with him.
