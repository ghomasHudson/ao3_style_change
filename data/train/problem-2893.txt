Dean is actually pretty ready to fall asleep now, but it’s Cas who breaks the silence again. “So,” he says. “You like it when I give you positive feedback.”
“Oh Lester,” she shakes her head at him. Okay, this is getting fun again. “Why do I do anything? I’m a demon, remember,” he looks a little more scared of her, which she appreciates. “Maybe I just didn’t like your face. Or your fuckin’ ugly moustache…which-seriously dude? It’s not the 70s. Get a razor and go to town.”
…” he lets his voice trail off, his face growing warmer as comprehension flashes across Castiel’s face.
His stupid moustache quivers. “Men aren’t built for monogamy,” he asserts. “Because of evolution. We’re – we’re – we’re programmed, you know, to – to spread our seed.”
this is actually the most explicit thing I'd written which is maybe why I got all squirrely about writing it and left it unfinished. it's not even that explicit yet!
Dean shrugs. “It doesn’t take a genius to figure it out,” he leans into Castiel’s side. “I mean, you’re
Another one was resigned, smiled at him all tired and sad. “You can hurt me but don’t hurt anyone else, okay?” He stopped running. Stood there. Waited.
Tears are silently rolling down Dean’s cheeks and he feels the stiffness of his skin where they’re already drying. “I couldn’t go without saying it. I didn’t think-I’ve never thought that you’d-” his voice breaks and he clears his throat in embarrassment. “You’ve never wanted to
There’s a road in the crescendo and he can feel it stretch out through the stars. It’s ending somewhere. Something is reaching out to him.
He sits up straighter in his seat and stutters again, trying to sound professional. Trying to sound cool. “Well,” he begins, throat working. “My
In her jacket, she can feel the perfectly balanced weight of the First Blade. “Well hey,” she winks. “Keep your chin up. I’ve got a good feeling things will work out soon,” with her enhanced hearing, she can hear now the sound of a car turning the corner, the first one to intrude on this quiet suburban street all night. The blade feels so heavy in her pocket. “And not for nothing, but my instincts tend to be pretty much on the mark.”
His hand trembles as he holds it out to the birds. “They tortured me,” he says. “Have you ever been trapped alone like that?”
There was the one who grabbed him by the tie and kissed him like violence, like a punch to the teeth, before personally pointing his sword and guiding his hand.
Cas is tired of wrapping his legs in Dean’s bedsheets and getting fingerprints on his photo frames. So today, he opens the dresser.
Looking to Dean wordlessly for affirmation that this is okay, he gets a nod in return and allows himself to settle comfortably with his legs crossed. “Dean,” it’s half a greeting, half a statement.
Dean grabs the neck of his beer and takes not so much a sip as an outright chug. When he puts it back down, his blood freezes. Cas looks like he’s in tears. In a rush, Dean realizes that he has never, not once, seen Castiel cry before. He doesn’t know what to do, but he’s terrified.
Max moves his head hesitantly as he turns to face him, with several slight jolts as if he’s a gear whose crank is being slowly turned into a new place. “Sent him away? With the car?” he looks surprised, and yeah sure, Dean’s made it clear how protective of his car he is. “How will you get back?”
Carefully, giving Dean the chance to move away or stop him, Castiel turns to fully face him, moving in so their foreheads are touching and his big hands are covering his knees. “Because I have never felt like your brother,” his breath tickles Dean’s nose.
His brother has built a cross with his own two hands, using the wood from the fallen tree. When Dean had risen from the dirt and began pulling at the burnt lightning-struck wood with purpose, Sam had asked if he wanted help burying Cas. He swears to God, Dean looked about ready to rip his throat out with his hands.
“I am your friend,” Castiel continues, his tone turned quiet and soft, making the phrase sound like an incantation or prayer. Something with power.
He couldn’t take it in very far, hadn’t been able to the first time he’d done this, but he made up for it by wrapping his hand around the rest of it like he’d seen in porn he’d furtively watched on mute while John had been away and Sammy had been asleep. The rhythm of his mouth and hand were uneven, but it didn’t matter. Soon, Connor/Colin twitched involuntarily and came without warning, getting some on Dean’s tongue before he spluttered and pulled off, splashing the rest in a messy trail down his chin.
Oh God. Well. Conversation cancelled. Dean presses the button on the side of his phone that makes the screen go dark and starts cleaning up the huge mess he made. He’s about ready to go take a long shower to contemplate everything that makes him a fundamentally unlovable person and probably have an unsatisfying self-loathing fueled jerk off session when his phone starts ringing.
When he manages to get enough of a fucking grip to stand, he splashes his face in the sink and fills himself a glass of water. Downs it. Fills another. He’s still trembling when he reaches for his phone, flicking through messages for something to do, when his eyes fall on his last conversation with Castiel, ages ago now.
Castiel has not known the path forward for almost a decade. That time has felt as long and as hard as the millennia he existed before any beautiful boy begged him to overwrite fate.
Alastair sucks the spit down his throat. It makes a disgusting sound. “Oh I know,” he sounds delighted, the way he’d sound if he was watching a baby bird about to be pulverized with stones. “You came for your blade.”
She sits back on her heels and looks at him with her jaw clenched. He must have seen that same expression reflected back at him in the mirror over a hundred times. “Who
"Oh," this was a joke right. Cas was trying to make a joke. A fucking weird, fucked up joke. "But Naomi is dead."
, but his voice cuts off in a hitch of breath when Dean reaches over and brushes their hands together for just a second, just gently.
-could accept your senseless death has been incorrect every single time you have tried it. And you can’t tell me…” Castiel chokes. “That you
Sam stares at him, doing his best to keep the shock off his face. “This is Castiel, the angel. You-uh, you call him Cas.”
“I know you have always seen yourself as inherently less worthy of life than the others around you, but the persistent
“I need you,” Dean obeys, gasping as Cas moves against him. “I need you. I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you,
Cas doesn’t respond, doesn’t take his eyes off whatever spot in the uncompromising blackness he’s fixed on. “Damn it, Cas, look at me,” Dean pleads. “Look at me, come on, help me.”
His life had changed a lot over the past few years and he’d changed his attitude along with it. Wanting men to fuck you wasn’t the end of the world. He’d
Dean laughs, short and humourless. "Ha, uh..." he pauses, scratching the back of his neck. "You know for a second there I thought I heard you say you talked with
“I kind of, uh,” he can feel heat spreading down his face and knows his neck and chest will be flushed now. “Wasn’t really asking if you wanted a
Afterwards, they pile back into the car in silence. As Mary starts up the engine, in the backseat Castiel stares at Dean with accusation in his eyes. He swallows the lump in his throat and angles himself away from Cas, ashamed.
Castiel gazes at him fondly before putting the car in drive. “Oh Dean,” he says. “You’ll be the death of me, I swear.”
Castiel couldn’t say he liked it. He was notoriously averse to change and prone to paranoia and distrust. His sister, Death, though she liked to be called Anna, believed that it was a part of his nature. From some angles, it was a flaw, but they were not mortal creatures and could not be judged as good or bad in behaviour. It was an aspect of Dream, an aspect of dreaming. Dreams are disjointed, non-linear and confusing, but above all they seek to decode lived experience. Dreams struggle through complexity and mania because above all they long for stability, a way to make sense of all that comes to pass.
A few minutes pass with no message and Dean starts to psych himself out. Normally Castiel is a fast-draw on the texts, sending grammatically perfect messages interspersed with a truly criminal amount of emojis. It’s actually kind of adorable, not that Dean’d ever admit to thinking it anything other than obnoxious. Did he go too far with that last text? Did it make him seem clingy, like some kind of desperate bunker housewife? He almost jumps as he gets a notif.
Dean doesn’t have to mess with him. But she will. Because it’s fun, and because she can. She finds that her whole world has shrunk down to that small, selfish little space of animal motivation. So sue her. She’s dead now, after all. Not like anyone gives a fuck what she does.
When he gently breaks away, he laughs at Dean’s little noise of complaint. “I believe that Mary will come back to you,” he presses his forehead to Dean’s and laces their fingers together where they’re laying now face to face. “Her alienation in this new world will fade and when that time comes she will want to be with her sons. With
She’s kneeling in the dirt next to John’s body. Next to her father’s body. He’s suddenly struck by the simple truth that the poisoned legacy of their family line comes down to these two men, who just couldn’t resist teaching children how to kill monsters.
He could see a man-shaped figure approaching across the distant fields of Hell. Even from a long way off, he could tell it was a demon. You could always recognize a demon, almost especially one that was man-shaped. There was something off in every movement, infinitesimally and indescribably inhuman. On Earth, women sometimes recognized this, though they didn’t have the words to describe what it is they saw. They would just feel it, like a prickling tingle on the backs of their necks, and they would put as much distance as possible between themselves and the smiling stranger in the corner of the room.
So that’s how he ends up on his ass on the floor of the bunker kitchen, clutching old photographs, others spread out across his lap, a bottle discarded next to him, having a panic attack against the counter. Good Lord, it hasn’t been this bad since he first got back from purgatory, and he can’t say he’s missed the way he can hyperventilate so much that it feels like he’s gonna pass out, can’t say he missed the roaring ocean sound in his ears, the overwhelming sickening heat travelling up and down his body, the nausea spitting in his stomach, the uncontrollable sobs that choke out his breathing, or the mind-numbing fear.
this is part 2 of my excerpts from my abandoned 2017 dcbb sandman comics au: a scene where anna reunites with her brother dream, and a scene where cas and dean face off against azazel in the dream realm.
by Cas, who just stands there holding him under the water. “You’re so beautiful,” Cas rumbles in his ear, sounding unbearably sincere, as always, kissing the space on his neck just below. “Thank you for wanting me.”
At least Sam is smarter than him, less willfully ignorant of cracks in a tenuous dynamic. Sam had seen this coming, for sure, and tried to warn him, tried to talk about it. Smart, brave Sam, once his sole reason for living, who had been clever enough to get out of this life all those years back and make his way to Stanford and to Jess. Dean had ruined that for him, too.
Dean’s eyes go wide in horror as he realizes that a fatal wrench has been thrown in yet another one of his carefully laid out plan to sacrifice his life for others. He and his brother beg their mother to stop, but she breathes deep and stands solid like an unstoppable object rooted to the earth. Her face is almost calm as she raises the gun to her head, full of the absolute courage of her conviction. The expression is so heartbreakingly familiar.
Yes. Don’t get out of bed. “It’s so important,” he’s shaking. “I know it sounds-it sounds really stupid. But it’s the most important thing to remember. You can’t forget. Promise me-please, Mary, please promise me,” tears are rolling down his face and he sniffs self-consciously, frantically wiping at his cheek with the heel of his hand. “November 2nd 1983-just-”
Dean’s wandered away and is examining the mechanical bull, clearly impressed beyond reason at his forgotten prowess riding Larry. Sam looks at him and sighs.
She looks at the fountain with him, still standing next to him as he sits hunched over on the bench. “I assume you punished them,” she watches the water pool in the basin and thinks about cycles and lives and Endlessness.
“I-yeah, Cas, of course I meant it,” he touches Castiel’s arm again. Just once. Just lightly. “We’re family.”
“These are pictures from Benjamin’s collection,” Cas turned back to appraise the frames. There’s several portraits, and a group shot, everyone staring severely at the camera. “This is us, as we were at the turn of the century.”
Mary smiles quietly. Sam just breathes in deep through his nose and keeps his eyes fixed determinedly at the passing scenery.
He stares at her with wide eyes. “Hey!” he protests as she sinks comfortable against the seat. “Hey!” he repeats when she doesn’t give him an immediate reaction.
. So she doesn’t. She’ll be packing and heading out in the morning going to God knows where, but he’ll make sure she has what she needs and wants wherever she ends up heading to. Maybe they can call Jody up and ask her how she feels about Mary staying with her, Alex and Claire. Bitterly, he wonders if his mom would prefer the company of teenage girls over her adult sons; if it would make her feel more like a mother.
Dean actually smiles a bit, a tiny closed mouth twitch of the lips, but still. “Mo-om,” he draws the word into two whiny syllables, but the tension is still in his voice.
“I’m sorry mom,” his voice is so soft, small, she can’t help but remember all the times he feared punishment as a child. It’s hard to make herself understand that he’s not a little boy anymore when in so many ways, in those few moments he’s been vulnerable in front of her, she feels like they’re still all together in Lawrence. He still desperately wants to be
In his heart he knows she’s already doomed. There’s nothing he can do to stop her from being brave, from wanting to protect her family.
Castiel’s solid hands rub slow circles on his back. “Would you like to make coffee together and watch the sunrise?”
Cas quickly presses on. “I don’t intend to imply that it’s desirable or acceptable for you to be unhappy. I do not enjoy it when you are. I merely want to ensure that you know that pretending to be okay is not something you have to do for me, for my sake.”
Today, now, here, Castiel cries on the floor of Sam’s dead brother’s bedroom. There it is, the walls seem to say. Love and silence and nothing else.
“I didn’t tell you this for your sympathy Dean, and I do think there’s much I have kept from you that I should tell you about, some other time. The point of this is that I am still incredibly grateful to have known Hannah, despite the pain it caused me. Just like I am blessed to know you. I would rather live a life where I experience pain, but also great love, than a life following orders. You gave me that, Dean.”
Each kill was different in a new and horrifying way. Initially they all begged, asked for mercy. Some of them grabbed onto his coat like they were holding onto the part of him that used to be a creature they could trust. Like they could hold it in and keep it inside him, make him good, keep him from cracking the surface of everything he brushes.
Castiel’s arms were most likely created to personally victimize Dean. Sure, he’d had more than his fair share of way more than PG-13 thoughts about them, God forbid taking his hands into account, but what was almost worse was how much he just craved being held by them. His entire body, his countenance and his presence had occupied such a large role in Dean’s life for almost a decade now that the mere sight of Cas made him long for something he couldn’t find words in himself to properly describe. Castiel was more solid than the earth, he was older than life and time. It was terrifying how much Dean knew he could depend on Cas to always save him. He didn’t know how to say
“Wh-No!” he sputtered. “I mean not that she isn’t, you know, attractive, but I’m not like-I don’t-that’s not what I think when I look at her.”
“She looks like you,” Dean said, before realizing the somewhat ridiculous nature of the statement. “I mean, she is you-I mean not
“I’d say very little,” he replies bluntly. “This is very advanced magic. If we don’t break it soon, he will forget the ability to eat, to sleep, to breathe. Dean will die.”
“No,” she responds so fast. “No. I could never regret you or your brother. Never. I chose you. You’re the one thing in my life that I chose.”
Cas leans down and kisses him on the mouth, then on the nose, his chin, his cheeks, both eyelids, moves to his neck and presses kisses up to his ear. When he gently pulls at Dean’s earlobe with his teeth and licks it, Dean whines
Dean laughs briefly. “Damn, all that crap gave me a headache,” he stretches and Castiel wraps his free arm protectively around him.
Castiel reacts like he’s been slapped. He whips his head around to meet eyes with Dean, urgently. “Dean,” he says. “This is very important. You have to know what you can-” his voice cuts off in a sickening slow rattle of breath. Azazel is suddenly right in front of him, with a hand buried in his chest, slid in as easily as if he had slid his hand into a basin of water.
Hop into the getaway car and floor it. Put the pedal right down to the floor and make the horizon eat your dust. Dean Winchester is in love with you. God help you now.
Dean suffers on Earth; Dean goes to Hell. Castiel saves Dean from Hell; Dean suffers on Earth. Dean dies on Earth; Dean goes back to Hell. Cas saved him, and then he could no longer save him, and the cycle is over, and the cycle is ended, and the doors have rusted shut on their hinges, and the windows are sealed shut with paint, and the sun rises, and the moon rises also, and no one left alive still cares that anyone ever tried to live in that house, ever tried to make a go of it, the two of us together.
Cas just looks at him, the way he did when there was something Dean just wasn't getting. His eyes were so tired these days, and if he was human Dean would've been telling him to get some sleep. Sometimes he almost did, anyway. He would look at Cas and open his mouth to go
He sees his garrison, his brothers and sisters. He sees the gardens in Heaven. His favourite pocket dimensions. The eternal Tuesday afternoon.
“Yes,” he says, plainly, still scowling. He pulls at the air again, reaches out a hand and one brave bird tentatively hops forward to receive the new seed.
“You know God and Jesus are the same person, Castiel,” They almost sound...amused. They still speak in human tongues. “You gave yourself to Earth. You sacrificed yourself for the world.”
The first thing he thinks is that the clothes still smell like Dean. So he starts pulling them out and bringing items intermittently to his face in a pastiche of kissing. He wonders what Dean is wearing now that he’s dead. He wonders what he smells like.
When they finally set off for the meeting, both had adopted forced cheerful moods. However, the situation quickly began to disintegrate as they drove. Cas provided the directions and location easily enough, but was unsurprisingly unforthcoming on the details of the many other questions Dean had.
is almost a comical under exaggeration. In all that time though, I never met another being who affects me the way you affect me. I’ve always been a bit of a thorn in the side of Heaven, never quite the perfect angel I wanted to be, but then I met you and I didn’t
There’s nothing to say though, he can’t remember anything except that he desperately wants Castiel. His voice trails off in a whisper.
Sam started blinking normally again. “Sorry, didn’t mean to interrogate you. It’s your business, I just want to make sure I respect your business, you know.”
“I wasn’t trying to step on your toes, Castiel,” his voice moves like a stream choked with mud, slow and gritty. “I came across it in my travels and I thought you might be happy that I had my prince keep it nice and sharp for you. No thanks required.”
An angel is part of everything that has been, everything that is and everything that will be. An angel dying is a cosmic fucking event, a natural disaster on a macro-universal scale. A piece of the sky is being torn out. A line of creation is being scribbled off the page. When an angel dies, distant planets no human will ever see get knocked out of orbit. Comets fall from the sky. When an angel dies, the whole world feels it, whether they know it or not.
As they progressed, he wondered if the new versions remembered what he had done to the old, discarded models, somewhere inside their artificial hearts. He wonders now if they slowly started to recognize him as their predator, in the way that rabbits know to hide from shadows circling in the sky above them. It’s more likely that Naomi simply set them in a pattern; impersonal, purely mathematical, logical, orderly, to play out a sequence of reactions, a sequence of potential realities.
figured something out and he’s probably gonna be smug about it for the rest of linear time. “What’s embarrassing about me telling you that you were so good for me,” he says. Dean whimpers
In one moment Dean is stabbing his vessel in a warehouse covered with sigils. He is throwing his head back and laughing,
Max whirls around and hits him on the arm, probably with more force than necessary. He looks frantically around them. “Shut up!” he hisses. “What if someone hears you say that?”
Could Cas hear Dean’s real words in his mind like the world’s most desperate message written on his painfully unsubtle needy neon sign excuse for a human soul? There have been times before where Dean has thought so, that Cas could sweep away the curtain of that fucking
Cas looks bored, which on Cas generally means he’s annoyed or tired. In this case, Sam thinks it’s both. “I know that you heard me the first time, Dean,” he says with exaggerated calmess, using slow and careful delivery to reflect his deep impatience. “I have been contacted by a former member of my angel garrison. We have set a meeting time and place for tonight.”
“Hey Dean, you alive in there?” It wasn’t Cas. “We were gonna go into town to get some lunch, you wanna come with?”
He frowns, far away in thought. “I’ve never loved anyone the same,” the lines beneath his eyes look like valleys that are gateways to deep icy oceans. “I’m not sure it’s right to use the same word for what I feel for others compared to what I feel for your son.”
“You didn’t have to do this,” he says, turning his face away to gaze intently at the bottle of tequila on the second to last shelf.
He likes to skirt around the subject with a few pointedly aimed innuendos, a few vaguely nauseating grins. Sam fills in the blanks most of the time, because the blanks are being flung at his head and he doesn’t want to linger on the subject of his brother getting naked for too long. He’s familiar with Dean’s particular brand of overcompensatory masculinity, but he never really considered the idea that Dean maybe outright lies sometimes.
“Have some faith, Dean,” Cas says with Dean’s own mouth, and boy if that isn’t one of the weirdest things he’s ever heard in his life. “I’m an excellent and conscientious driver.”
There’s an almost imperceptible intake of breath from Castiel at the contact, and Dean blushes. Another beat of silence and Cas hums in his throat, turning his body towards him.
He holds the crystal aloft. “I’m going to kill Dream,” he says, triumphantly, and shatters it in his hand.
Cas stands abruptly, pushing Dean off her lap. She lands on her ass on the motel room carpet with a small
There’s a beat of silence. Dean looks terrified now and Jane wants to find out how to convince her everything will be okay. Doesn’t she see everything can be okay now?
“You’re welcome,” he replies awkwardly. God, he’s not really used to just saying shit like that. He should tell Sam about this. He’d be so proud.
He hasn’t thought at all since he arrived in this space. Thinking is very much a human thing to do. Angels act. Angels know the path forward.
They back walked to a chair and curled up together. “So,” Castiel pressed a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “Does this mean we won’t fight anymore?”
“Never thought of it that way,” he simpers. “I’m all about instant gratification. You just couldn’t gratify anymore.”
“No-that’s not-” Cas chokes on the lump in his throat. “You don’t know what you’re doing. You aren’t
“Thank you Azazel,” he says. “It’s been so long, I had forgotten how much of myself I placed in that object, how much I relied on it. Now all my soul is free.”
Dean practically leans on Castiel like a crutch the entire way to his bedroom. Whatever, he’s always been a bit touch-starved, and he’s been trapped in solitary confinement for almost two months, so sue him. When he opens the door he’s surprised to see that the room looks lived in. “I had taken to sleeping here,” Cas admits. “While you were away. It made me feel closer to you, like I could feel your presence, your signs of life.”
A Dean that cradled his face in his hands as they stood there in a grotesque parody of a romantic embrace. Castiel holding the back of his head, dipping him backwards with the blade slid smooth and easy into his stomach like a hot knife through butter. He bled out and whispered pathetic, meaningless platitudes as the light of his life flickered dimmer.
I suppose, from an objective standpoint. But I had to cooperate with Crowley. So my day has left something to be desired.
Cas almost looks angry. “You’d never say that if you weren’t cursed. Do you know how it feels? That you don’t want me unless you’re cursed?”
He touches Dean’s possessions, moves them around the room. He reads his books, finding all the places where Dean left notes in the margins, all the creases left behind from past dog ears marking past places. Cas leaves some dog ears of his own, and he can’t stop tracing his fingers over the passages Dean has underlined, words he has circled.
I thought I'd lighten up the mood a little here. this is pretty much just what it says in the title. there is some descriptions of sexual content, and dean describes the memory of his first time giving a blow job when he was underage, with a boy who was his age at the time (both 17). he is reliving/remixing this in his dream in the present.
“Since when have you avoided risk in the line of duty?” Castiel demands, his eyes involuntarily flicking down to Dean’s waist. Dean blushes to his freckles, before scowling and running a hand through still sleep mussed hair. “I’m not walking into a war with heaven Dean, I’m going to talk to an old friend, someone I’ve known for
This other man-shaped demon inspires even more visceral creeping horror than even Alastair’s grotesque parody of human faced creature does. Azazel is not uniquely terrifying as a result of his creation, though his strange yellow eyes, marbled with veins of cracked black emptiness do nothing to put others at ease. Though he is an ancient demon, and a powerful one, he was not placed on the throne to hell through divine providence or any other incommunicable force at work in the stitching pulling at the fabric of the universe. He ascended to the throne because he is a particularly fucking nasty piece of work and even for a denizen of hell, cares especially little about avoiding sacrilege.
Castiel is leaning back against the car, looking up at the sky. He doesn’t acknowledge her approach until she is standing right in front of him. “Hello Mary,” he looks at her and tilts his head. “Is Dean all right?”
Yep. They’re making out. Angry, aggressive passionate making out. Against the side of the Impala. With Sam
it's demon dean but she's a lesbian! cas is also a lesbian. most of this is a scene rewrite where I pull a lot of canon dialogue. it felt like pulling teeth when I was doing it. remind me never to try doing that again. it's like editing. a very small bit at the end is cas being anguished while dean tries to seduce her.
In the way of dreams, he was watching himself give a blowjob for the first time, but he was also giving it. He was both versions of himself and neither of them, able to see and feel from both outside and in.
They lapse into silence for a minute, shifting against each other quietly, absorbing the other shock-this is real now. Dean and Castiel, the will they-won’t they of universe altering and fate shattering proportions.
Did he do a good enough job? Did he make Cas feel good? Did he make Cas happy? God, what if this was just selfish of him, what if this wasn’t what Cas really wanted and he was just kidding himself that this could ever work out and-
“It shouldn’t be that hard to kill the witches now that I know who and where they are. They’re human too, after all. They just have magic,” Sam insists. “And I know it probably sounds dumb, but I need to be the one to do this. He’s my brother, you know?”
Dean whirls around and strikes at him again, this time landing a slash across Azazel’s arm. He almost looks impressed, but Dean doesn’t waste any time and aims directly for his heart. This time, Azazel easily dodges it, flashing out of existence entirely for a moment before reappearing directly behind him. “Hello, Dean,” he breathes in his ear and Dean jumps and tries to run, choking when Azazel uses his arm to grab him around the throat.
They’re leaned up against the Impala, Dean’s back to the door. He has Dean’s face cradled reverently in his hands, and Dean is crying. Dean has his arms wrapped around Castiel’s shoulders, underneath his arms, as if he’s trying to pull him in as close as possible. He’s rubbing his thumbs distractedly against Castiel’s neck, while Castiel runs his hands all over his face, occasionally wiping away tears that trail down his cheeks. They pull apart and breathe in and she sees, rather than hears, Dean sigh soul-achingly deep. Castiel strokes his thumbs gently underneath Dean’s eyes where tear stains have gathered. Dean laughs, the sound watery, and they press their foreheads together. He turns his face inward, his eyelashes brushing Castiel’s cheek. His arms cling tighter and Castiel rubs the tip of his nose gently against the side of Dean’s.
He can feel Cas smile against his neck. “It’s always been one of the fundamental laws of the universe that I love you, Dean.”
“They were after you,” he says. He flings a handful of seed almost petulantly and the pigeons leap away from the spray in alarm. “They only wanted more power.”
When he finally gets a hand around him, Dean chokes back a sob. “I love these,” Castiel breathes, pressing little kisses to the freckles at the base of Dean’s neck. “Have you ever heard the story that all freckles are kisses from angels?” he’s moved on to the ones on his shoulder, and Dean can’t stop shaking. “It’s not true, obviously, but if it were,” he pauses to suck a kiss on his collarbone. “I would make sure you had freckles everywhere.”
his arm bending at an unnatural angle as he recoiled back from the pain. He couldn’t scramble away. “No, Cas,” he begged as Castiel raised his sword. “Don’t. Please,” it was over. “
“Yeah,” Max interrupts. “Yeah, I know,” he feels harsh. “I’m sorry, Dean. That’s really awful, I’m sorry,” there is more silence.
There were the ones who screamed at him, called him horrible names. The ones who screamed for help, for Sam, for their mother.
Cas sighs, rolling his eyes and sitting down uncomfortably, stiffening even more when Dean shuffles closer to him.
Max watches Dean order a whiskey, still nursing his own drink. Dean turns to him and raises his glass. “Here. Cheers,” he says and Max obediently clinks his glass against Dean’s. The sound seems overly loud in the suddenly quiet bar.
“Is this okay?” Cas checks in again, chest plastered to Dean’s back. Dean just swears loudly by way of reply and grabs frantically at his hands, lacing their fingers together again.
“Talk about what in front of who?” Castiel settled himself casually in the seat right next to Dean, shifting the legs of the chair to move even closer. He did it so nonchalantly, like it meant nothing at all to sit within kissing distance to your closest friend, who’s been having secret high-definition quality vivid sex dreams about you.
He appraises her. “I didn’t think you would. But I’m not always the best judge of human character,” he pauses, and his mouth twitches in humour. “Sam, as far as I can discern, seems to be heterosexual. So you don’t need to worry about that.”
He always caught the words on the tip of his tongue, realizing at the last second and feeling stupid. He just forgot sometimes. Self-centred, selfish, dumb to forget.
“Not really,” she amends quickly, still feeling like her skin is crawling. She doesn’t know why she thought that would be funny. She doesn’t understand herself much anymore. “Lester, right?
Azazel laughs. “Oh you just keep going! I love it! You were made to keep going. Daddy’s good tin soldier, the warrior prince. Just wind him up and watch him go!”
“See now, this,” Azazel adopts a tone like he’s critiquing a film, or offering commentary at an art gallery. “
Dean can’t stop smiling. “You’re an insufferable smug son of a bitch, did you know that?” he quips, pushing at Castiel’s shoulder and Cas just hums and reels him in until they’re kissing in the middle of the bunker kitchen.
He tries to stand but feels the overwhelming pressure and all-encompassing presence of the power of Hell that Azazel wields pressing him back down. He felt that for millennia, in his own personal prison. Why did he never try to fight it before? Why can’t he fight it now?
“Everyone’s a critic,” Castiel deadpans and Dean can’t help but kiss him again in the doorway of his bedroom.
“I think he-we’re gonna be okay,” she says and he hums. “I-Castiel, I need you to know that I would never want my son to feel ashamed. Dean or-or Sam.”
He lets himself drift for a minute before he trips on another dumb thought and opens his mouth again. “Can I ask-” Dean says. “Never mind, no, it’s stupid.”
The Creator speaks in a chorus of a thousand voices.“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”
He’s staring at her and her bones ache with sympathetic tension from the way he’s holding himself wound tight in anticipation. It’s a stance ready to absorb a blow, she imagines he’s always prepared for any kind.
Maybe he’s just giving Cas a taste of his own medicine, for all those times he’s left prayers unanswered. Dean was always the one calling and now that he’s dead, he’s the one who won’t answer.
He remembers it, every single time he killed Dean. Dean doesn't talk about this, doesn't ask. Cas doesn't tell him. Neither whispered a word about it from the moment that Castiel laid a hand on his face to heal, keenly aware of the way Dean flinched away from him in anticipation of more pain. Dean has no idea. If Castiel has his way, he never will.
Cas huffs a final amused breath next to Dean’s ear, before turning serious. “But Dean, I really did mean to ask you what’s upsetting you.”
Dean emerges from the bathroom with red-rimmed eyes like he’s been crying, but an expression that looks like for the life of him he can’t remember ever having anything to cry about. He immediately reinstalls himself on the bed in front of the tv. Castiel is standing, turning in place to marvel at the sticky notes decorating the objects in the motel room.
Dean stares at him. “Well. Then I’ll make it end a different way,” he says, as if through willpower and love alone, it really can be that simple.
“Whoa, that sounds cool,” Dean says. “Imagine an angel driving my car? That’d be kinda sexy actually.”
The prickly hot wave of panic that spread up from his toes at that thought made him push his seat away from the table and go looking for him.
When Mary looks back at him, her face is a mask of anguish. Her expression is so difficult to look at he has to force himself not to gaze down at the dirt so he doesn’t have to see her haunted eyes staring back at him. He can be a witness to her pain. Maybe he fucked all the rest of it up but at the very least, Dean can do this for her. He can see her, when no one else does.
Dean forced himself to be a man because he perceived there to be a shortage, but he should’ve been able to be a boy. She thinks she can see those parts of him sometimes still, the child he locked away so long ago and never really got to be.
we ever met be absolutely psycho, Cas!” he gestures widely and frantically with his arms, making the belt of the Dead Guy robe come a bit loose. He quickly readjusts it and pulls on the ends to tighten it. “God forbid I want you to stay safe.”
Dean hums wounded in his throat. “Well, she has been through a lot. Sammy’s gone from a baby to a sasquatch. And I-” he swallows, his eyes burning. “I’m definitely not her sweet little boy.”
He’s looking at the stars again. “In many ways I had accepted the reality of that ache. I was unwilling to let him know what I could feel or push him to explain himself, his desires, to me. It seemed possible that we could do this forever, and I couldn’t risk him closing off from me, or pulling away. It’s always been most important that I can be in his life at all, in any capacity, as close as he will let me be. I was trying to learn to be satisfied with accepting that bruise. Tonight-changed that for me. I thought I could live this way-” he looks at her and sighs.
Dean gratefully accepted the mug and took a sip. “Yeah, well, nothing like a demon dry spell to get yourself some rest, I suppose.”
“Enough!” Sam raises his voice. Dean and Castiel look almost surprised. “Yeah, I’m still here. You know, I think I’d actually rather go back to Hell than be in this car right now?”
For a moment, he forgets everything. That moment becomes an age. He stretches out the oil slick shiny span of his eight wings to dip into the passing timbres like a paddle dips into water. He drags them through the song and colour. His eyes flicker in every direction, the thousand of them trying to take in visually every element that he can’t yet feel.
This vacation should be a dream come true, God knows he wanted to settle down someday. So why was he so damn tense?
“That’s a more difficult question,” Castiel bunches his hands in the material of his coat. “I think the true, honest answer is always, from the moment I touched him. But that isn’t when I knew. I-for a while I did not know how to understand. Angels govern themselves by forces ulterior to emotion.”
He tries to raise himself up by pushing his back against his mother’s grave, pulling himself up inch by inch. He feels the stone protest, groaning and bending backward, not built to withstand this much pressure. Azazel seems to be letting him try. Playing with him like some animals like to bloody their prey before letting them go, catching them, and bloodying them up a little bit more. Like the animals that know they don’t need to worry about being able to kill the smaller, weaker animals once the game has lost its fun.
Scouring the local headlines for any possible hints to their Type of Thing, even a passing chance that might get them out of the bunker to investigate, he was forced to conclude that there truly was nothing new.
Dean took a huge swig of black coffee, for courage. There was a pause, while Sam looked at him expectantly and he searched for the balls to say what he needs to say.
Later in the motel room, Sam wonders what the fuck to do. He’s definitely in over his head and who knows what’s gonna happen to Dean if no one helps him. He can’t even remember his own name anymore, what else will he forget?
Sam doesn’t tell Dean that he already knows this. He doesn’t ask Dean what he means. He knows what he’s trying to say.
i'm gaydean on tumblr as per Usual. i'm very tired now. man, the tonal shift between this and my last one huh?
,” insists Cas, authority rolling out off his tongue with intent. Dean gets a flashback of when Castiel was the new God and damn, that really shouldn’t turn him on. “You give so much of yourself to others, yet you see it as your simple duty. Only a truly good man would behave as you do.”
Dean hovered in the doorway. He ran a self-conscious hand through his hair and sighed softly, kicking his toe against the ground. “You know, I was almost worried you left,” he said in a small choked voice. He cleared his throat loudly and forced a laugh.
him,” he hisses, almost baring his teeth with anger. He looks like a wounded, cornered creature. Sam raises his hands in surrender.
doesn’t feel like receiving revelation. He hasn’t woken up to find new holes weeping blood from his hands. It’s more like this knowledge has always been there, etched into his bones. It’s as much a part of him as his skin and his blood and his teeth. A sense of inevitability. The certainty of destruction. In a sense it feels like the animal instinct to brace for unalterable cataclysm was a genetic trait, inherited by him in just the same way as he got his eyes from his mother, his hair from his mother, his smile from his mother. He got her broken heart too.
“Hannah was murdered,” Cas says. “A while ago now, very shortly after the Darkness was released. I miss them every day. I didn’t kill them, and rationally I know it was not my fault, but I can’t make myself stop thinking about how if it weren’t for me, they would be alive. So many others too, would be alive.”
Azazel laughs. “I am not your brother,” he says. “I am not some ancient has-been, out of place and out of time. I have no need for your pathetic imaginary structures, your tragically outdated customs,” they move around each other, negotiating the field of battle. “I’m the future. I’m what’s coming to pass, right here and right now.”
Cas twists the hand that’s holding Dean and pushes at his shoulder with the other one, pushing him against the car. Dean whimpers and crushes the coat’s collar in his hands.
The demon had grey hair and an equally grey and dirty looking beard. His teeth were blunt and human looking but when he smiled, which he did now and often, they seemed as if they were very sharp indeed and very capable of tearing through skin and bone with ease. “Hello, Dream,” he spoke through the bars of the gate, his voice nasally and blood sucking like a mosquito buzzing in your ear on a hot and restless summer night. When he blinked his eyelids open and closed, he did not have eyes at all. Instead, he had teeth where his eyes should be. He grinned at him with his whole face, and Castiel felt his skin crawl.
,” Castiel stutters when Dean breathes out his full name, and a high pitched noise like the one that shattered the windows when Dean first crawled out of his grave starts up low and begins to build. It seems to be coming from everywhere, surrounding and filling the room and ripping through him. It peaks as Castiel grips his right shoulder tight with his hand and yells into Dean’s shoulder as his entire body glows and hums with light and the breathtaking thrum of his Grace.
Guilt instantly curls in his gut. “Of course you can, I, uh, of course you can,” Dean bangs his hip on the counter as he makes his way out of the kitchen. He bites back his hiss of pain and coughs. “What do you want to talk about?”
this is a coda I wrote for episode 20 of season 12. that episode involved max banes doing something uh, Not Natural, to save the life of his younger sister, alicia banes. naturally this drove me insane.
Six lines of teeth are bared at him. “He’s in the palace,” Alastair says. “Only place for a prince, after all. That’s where our Lord keeps all his favourite possessions,” his expressions somehow lose nothing in their execution even without eyes, and even gain a new frightening layer of visceral significance. Castiel reflects on his past experiments in terror and wonders, not for the first time, if this one may have been one of his biggest mistakes.
The other day, Cas accidentally dropped one of the records on the ground and scratched the vinyl. Ever since then, he’s fantasized about Sam’s dead brother coming home and being pissed as fuck about it. He closes his eyes and imagines Sam’s dead brother pouting and demanding to know, rhetorically of course, if Cas knows just how hard it was to
Dean snorted. “Uh, touché,” he picked up Castiel’s solo portrait. Even in 1901, Cas looked like he was doing an x-ray of Dean’s thoughts. “But no. I won’t.”
He’s been staying in Dean’s room, sleeping in his bed, haunting the space. He twists up the sheets and leaves a new shape in the mattress like a poltergeist making itself comfortable.
She extricates herself from his arms and meets his eyes, so much like her own. “W-what, you mean the…when you told me not to get out of bed?”
“I wouldn’t-” she cuts herself off. That isn’t what she came to talk about. “Castiel, can I ask you a question?”
Cas just looks at him. "Well, Dean, I guess when you only talk about it once a decade it's bound to come up again."
!” Sam yells, spluttering from where he’s now gripping the sides of his seat like he’s holding on for dear life.
“Sorry, I guess it must’ve really seemed like it! But no. We just had a few drinks. He actually said that normally he’d be all over me, but he wasn’t really feeling ‘on form’ lately. It was kinda weird, I wondered if maybe there was another girl? But yeah, he ended up leaving through the back door.” She looks over at his brother and smirks. Sam regards him thoughtfully.
“Oh Dean,” Azazel says, in the smuggest tone he has ever heard from him, even when it was just the two of them, Dean on the racks, him with a collection of his favourite knives. “You didn’t even want to be saved. I know you. I know you better than anyone.”
She’s not really sure the Bible talks about any angels who look like women with short windswept hair and battered leather jackets. Maybe they should.
Dean presses his face back into his chest. “Didyoulikeit,” the words come out in a rush and he feels the tips of his ears turning red.
, hands scrabbling at Castiel’s back, and Castiel laughs right in his ear. He blushes and moves to cover his mouth with a hand, breathing heavily through his nose, but Cas just gently pulls away his fingers and laces them with his own, reaching behind his back to do the same with his other hand, before pressing them down on either side of his head and leaning in to kiss his mouth again.
Sam finishes sending Cas the information and looks up at his brother. “Castiel,” he replies bluntly, before noting the confusion in Dean’s face. “Our-your angel best friend.”
. “You have me. You don’t need him-you don’t have to-you don’t have to marry him, to have a family. You don’t have to be alone. I know who you are.”
The palace grows closer over the horizon as they continue to walk, the background sounds of abject and total human misery their aural substitute for conversation.
Dean stares him down. “Well, if you ask me,” he says. “That expression is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how roads work.”
I have absolutely no memory of writing this one! dean and cas have to share a body for some reason. it's titled casefic in my drive so obviously some kind of monster is involved. i have car banter and then a ghoul attack. that's all i have to offer you.
Castiel’s eyes widen in unseeing shock, the pupils and irises bleeding into one solid mass of constantly changing colour. Azazel grins and brutally tightens his fist in his chest, groping and gripping for something, pushing past the trappings of a human body that Castiel currently imitates. He latches onto something that most certainly is not part of a mortal being, in the place where a person would have a heart. He twists and Castiel gasps, the air coming out of him like he’s been slashed across the throat and is asphyxiating on his own blood. He might as well be. Whatever it is that sustains him has been stopped by Azazel’s punishing grasping hand, which tugs and pulls and wrenches inside him until it emerges, holding a shining crystal.
Half an hour later, he and Cas are sitting outside clutching mugs of black coffee and watching the sky light up with colour. Dean listens to Castiel’s story about the first time he saw the sun rise, his blue eyes lighting up with happiness at the memory.
” her gaze is frantic and wild, begging him for understanding. “because I just can’t-I can’t be alone,” she says. “I can’t be alone, Dean I can’t-I can’t-” her shoulders are shaking so hard and she sobs and sobs, burying her head in her hands. “I can’t do it-I’m not brave enough I’m not…. I can’t,” she breaks off and continues to cry, trembling all over.
“Is everything all right, Sam?” Cas continues and for a moment Sam feels a flash of irritation at the idea that there must be something wrong for him to call. Of course, there is something wrong and his irritation is hypocritical. Not for the first time, Sam reflects on the contrast between the dynamic Castiel has with him vs his brother.
Dean feels a muscle jump in her jaw and bares her clenched teeth at him. “I could care less what you think of me,” she lets him absorb that for a moment. “But we’re getting off topic. You cheating hypocrite.”
Many happy expressions flickered through Sam’s face at once and his mouth settled into a soft, loving smile. “Thank you.”
) when he looked down at Sam and she saw his entire world change. The evidence that he was now an older brother was in his hands. He would be shaped by this for the rest of his life.
He looks at her in horror. “That’s-” he sounds revolted. “That’s disgusting…Is-is that why you went to Hell?” Well. She wasn’t really expecting him to say something like that.
Thunder rumbles in the sky above the Dreaming. “Get out,” Castiel says. “You have no right to be here. You know the laws,” his eyes are as black as the demon’s and they bleed wispy blue energy.
Castiel sighs and strides into the room. Dean’s eyes go comically wide and flick between Sam and the new arrival. He drops the slice of pizza he’s holding and it lands with a wet
When they get back into the bunker, Mary starts shaking. Sam goes easily to her side, holding his arms open, and she effortlessly pulls him close. He dwarfs her in size but he still tries to tuck himself in underneath her arms, making himself as small as possible.
that record, how long he’s had it for. He wants Sam’s dead brother to clench his jaw and scowl over a skip in an old song. He wants a fucking record scratch to be all that he’s responsible for, all that he has to live with.
“Are-are you messing with me?” Cas stared unflinchingly into Dean’s wide nervous eyes. “I-no, not really-I mean-”
Their mouths are inches away from each other and Dean is trembling. Cas rubs his hands gently on his waist and makes a comforting sound in his throat. “Is this okay-” he begins, breaking off with a reverent sigh when Dean closes the space between them and presses their lips together.
but she doesn’t know how he’ll react, if she’ll make him close off. “There’s nothing to be sorry for.”
“I’ve made so many mistakes. I know I’ll make many more. But Hannah was not my mistake. My friendship with them was something good, and the way other angels exploited and twisted that was not my responsibility,” he squeezes Dean’s hand. “I’ve been coming to terms with that.”
“Wait-” Dean blurts and he turns back. “He-” he’s shaking. “I mean-” he wipes furiously at his eyes. “He loved us.”
He feels tears threaten to spill over again as he takes in the dishevelled room. “Couldn’t you have made the bed?” are the first words out of his mouth. He’s going to get better at emotions, he swears.
Dean is huddled on the couch with a beer. He smiles at them when they walk in. “Sam’s gone to bed,” he says. “I should be asleep too, it’s so damn late.”
“I’ll take the car, Dean. Also, my wings may not be fully prepared for long distance flight at the moment, but there are other ways I can speed up my journey using my Grace.”
this is just the beginning of a preseries au that exists because I was depressed and reflecting on how often I went without speaking and I projected onto Dean once again. it was going to be a deancas fic (yes the man in the trenchcoat is who you think it is) but it never got further than this.
Anna is unimpressed. “I haven’t heard from you in one hundred years and that’s your opening? I was worried sick about you, you know,” she smooths the lapel of her leather jacket in neurotic irritation, her red hair whipping around like a flame in the summer breeze.
Dean nods almost imperceptibly, making firm eye contact with the edge of the table. “Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.”
Technically, it’s silent in the car, but Sam has had to listen to some eardrum bursting classic rock that has been less obtrusive than this ongoing tension. He’s angling his body towards the two of them and he has a perfect view of Castiel looking like he’s trying to burn a hole through the back of Dean’s skull with his mind while Dean looks like he’s about to pull the steering wheel right out of the dash the way he’s twisting his hands around it so forcefully.
“You are the One I’ve always been angry with,” he’s never felt so aware. So awake. “You abandoned Creation from the start. You abandoned Everything. You never cared. You’re selfish. You’re selfish.”
She shouldn’t be seeing this, it’s their private moment. Though she’s only known him for a short time, she can’t imagine her son letting anyone else but Castiel see him this vulnerable. Mary feels like she’s trespassing, committing some sort of crime.
He was watching his teenage self suck off that boy from his senior woodshop class. Christ, what had been his name? Connor or Colin or something like that.
Cas doesn’t answer. “We know what Azazel did to your brother. What we don’t know is why – what his endgame is. He went to great lengths to cover that up.”
Castiel's expression contains an absolute zero sum of pity. "Well. I guess you're just gonna have to learn how to."
Of course, the final nail in Lucifer’s coffin had been that deal, the exact details of which were still largely unknown by those who had not been directly involved. Even The Endless, save for Destiny herself, of course, didn’t know exactly what had transpired. Death had not accompanied the soul to Hell, because it was not hers to care for anymore. All that they knew was that after Azazel had left Earth with his due, he had faced Lucifer on the field of battle and struck him down forever. There was no chance for a coalition, no opportunity for surrender. Azazel ruled with brutality and he occupied his throne alone.
on another night, when he hadn’t been certain for more than one horrible moment that Castiel was going to die and Dean wasn’t going to be able to die for him.
Dean stiffens involuntarily, and Cas tightens his arms around him in reassurance, pressing little kisses to his shoulderblades.
Castiel’s eyes stay fixed on his back as he goes. He waits until the lights of the Impala turn on and he can hear the gravel under the tires as it drives away. Then there is the fluttering sound of many wings. Then nothing.
Dean reacted instantly. “Fine,” he snapped, before turning on his heel and pouring himself some coffee. In a true show of passive aggression, he didn’t offer to get Cas any.
Castiel will not punish Dean. He will not strike him down. Everyone knows that. All of them know, in every place between the sky and earth and everything below. It’s impossible to be a commander with such a glaring weakness. His love is like a target painted neon and corrosive on his heart saying
Well now, this was a nasty surprise. “The Corinthian,” Castiel spoke back, endeavouring not to betray shock or anger. “Tell me, how many of my other creations did Hell steal from me while I was away from my throne?”
“Send me back again,” he demands, unhinged. “Let me do it again. Let me try again,” he swallows. “Please,” he adds, in a small, hurt voice.
He doesn’t know how long they stay pressed together, Cas kissing him slowly and deeply, rubbing his thumbs on the back of Dean’s hands where he has him pinned down. Eventually, reluctantly, Dean extricates himself with a gasp. “Hey,” he blushes, meeting Castiel’s blue blue blue eyes, which are practically fucking
“You’re not even a real boy, Dean,” Azazel sneers, snarling mean and close in his face with a hand fisted in the neck of his shirt. “Just the shattered hopes and dreams of a pathetic, useless old man.”
, but it’s more than that. It’s you. Like I know you look like Jimmy, but I met the guy and you two could not have come across more different. But here it’s the same, you know? You have the same eyes.”
Seconds later, Dean stormed back in and smacked a butter knife down next to Castiel’s plate. The metal clattered softly on the wood table. “Do you know what this is?” he demanded, before turning on his heel and leaving again.
"He's not even really my father," Cas says. "I mean, I suppose he could be considered the human equivalent in a specific scenario where you wake up and there is no trace of a father ever having been there, beyond a list of instructions left pinned to the fridge. But in a cosmic sense."
“Mom-” Dean starts to speak, his eyes wide, but she presses on. She needs to press on. She’s never talked about this before.
Dean lets himself sag into Castiel, feeling how solid he is, how capable Cas is of holding him tight and keeping both of them upright and still. “I meant it,” he mumbles somewhere into his shoulder and Castiel’s lips brush his temple almost imperceptibly.
“Dean,” Cas says very seriously. “I hate him. I have always hated him. And he has long outlived the argument that he has potential unique usefulness, unless there is some key detail I am missing.”
Dean’s stomach heaves again, but it’s empty now and he just retches, reaching an arm behind him to cling to the stone, elbow on top of the grave now. His knees shake violently but he straightens them and draws his sword.
Castiel sits next to him, their legs pressed together. He reaches for Dean’s hand and holds it with his own, scrutinizing his expression for his reaction. Dean moves their hands onto his knee and Castiel smiles, lacing their fingers together.
He starts hysterically beating back at him, elbows him viciously, kicks and flails with everything he has. Azazel just calmly tightens his grip, watching as he gets more desperate, flailing faster like a fish that’s flopping on the deck, trying to get back to safety in its last moments. A fish is no match for anyone. A fish is always gutted quickly.
,” the last word is a wail. “Forever-he said that I’d-” her breath comes out short quick and panicked and she presses her face to his shirt and wails into it. Screams into it. “D-desperate and
Dean won’t go inside. Sam has given up trying to convince him otherwise, and watches him from the window, sick with worry.
At the door, Mindy kisses her on the cheek. “I had a nice time,” she says quietly, her lips still close enough to Dean’s face for her to feel Mindy’s breath on her skin. She leans into it for half a second despite herself, closing her eyes.
Cas is actually smiling. "A lot of your swear words seem to be religion based, I'm not really sure how you expect me to avoid that."
anything from you I…I just want to help you,” he stands up slowly with his hands raised in a placating pose in front of him. I’m not a threat. I’m not a threat.
Cas sighs again, so heavily Sam’s surprised a new singularity isn’t created in the car from the weight of it. “What do you wanna know?” he asks.
“No,” They are endless. Faceless. A rolling mass of painful light and crushing darkness. There are so many wings. So many. There are two pitches, but only one voice.
Mary clutches the lapels of his coat, double breathing, stuttering and choking on nothing, on air. It’s like she can’t even survive in the world anymore. Like she’s a rare creature taken from its biome by careless hands, now doomed to suffer and die in an alien land that was not built for her survival.
“I’m fine,” Sam says and cringes at himself. “I mean-I’m fine, but Dean’s not fine.” He can practically hear Cas sitting up straight over the line.
“It’s okay,” Sam interrupts, lump rising in his throat. “It’s okay. Just. Dean. We can’t stay here. He can’t stay here.”
He hums. “Before time, if you can parse the paradox of qualifying timeless space as having a ‘before’ or ‘after’. But the stars existed, then.”
“I know you’re trying to make fun, but I’ve actually been sleeping so great the past couple weeks,” Sam replied, and wordlessly poured Dean some coffee. “Getting my eight hours and everything. More, even.”
“I really loved you, Cas,” Dean grimaces like she’s retelling someone else’s embarrassing story. “Wanted you to like…stay with me. Wake up next to you. Hold my hand and shit.”
things like that,” Castiel bristles all over and Dean’s fingers twitch with the urge to reach out to him but he refrains. He feels like he might get shocked if he did, like touching a bolt of lightning. There was something about Castiel tonight that made him feel young again, like when they first met in a barn covered with useless sigils. His hair is even a little dishevelled from the action of the night, reminiscent of the slightly younger version of himself, who always looked like he’d just landed from flight. There are moments like this, where Dean feels suddenly hyperaware that Castiel is an
“I won’t do anything you’re not comfortable with,” Cas says seriously. “But you can ask for what you want.”
“I’m a God,” he says and Dean shivers. He wonders if it would have been better not to be taken from Hell. He thinks it would have been. He wouldn’t have had to try so hard. Wouldn’t have had so much hope. Hell will be so much worse now, he knows. Going back will be even worse than when he first was dragged down when he made his Deal centuries ago.
They continue to argue outside, gesturing wildly with their arms and getting in each other’s faces. Sam buries his face in his hands.
Lightning strikes the tree by the lake in half. It splits like it’s been snapped in two. He does not react. The light flashes on the water, an answering crack of energy echoes back from the mountains across the bay. Thunder rolls through the bones of the ground. He does not move.
She lays a hand gently on his shoulder, creasing the fabric of his long black coat. No one has touched him gently in, well, longer than one hundred years. It’s a strange feeling.
Cas kisses his cheek. “I want to try too.” It’s sort of embarrassing how much that chaste gesture of affection affects Dean, but also he’s starting to think maybe he needs to banish the word
Mindy rolls her eyes at the bravado and posturing in Dean’s tone, but she still looks fond. “I’m not gonna ever see you again, am I?” it’s barely a question. She knows what this is. Dean knows she knows what this is. She knows Dean knows she knows. Long story short, everyone just knows everything around here. Everyone is knowing as hell.
Just as Dean starts to believe he’s going to die here, like this, not even able to look his killer in the eye in his final moments, Azazel grabs him harshly by the collar and stands, before harshly spinning them around and slamming Dean back against the grave. Spots pop in Dean’s vision and his ears ring like an alarm.
“I want you though,” Dean says. “I know I can’t remember stuff but I feel...safe, around you. And not safe, but in an exciting way like you can show me things I want to be shown. Sam says you’re my best friend. I’m attracted to you. So I think I have to want you for real.”
Cas ends up finally letting go of his hands in order to reach his hands down to hike up Dean’s thighs around his waist. “Is this okay?” he asks again, and Dean just nods comically fast like a bobble head, gets the breath knocked out of him when Castiel just finishes picking him up like he weighs nothing, wraps his hands around his neck and lets Cas carry him.
Cas turns his head slowly, his sullen expression meeting Dean’s frantic, angry one. He stalks silently and evenly back to the car, pointedly opens the door and slides himself back into the seat.
“But Temptation means nothing to Us. we may choose what we wish to choose. We will always choose you, Castiel. Champion of Earth.”
“No,” Lester lies quickly. “Oh, no. I-I wasn’t…” he caves when Dean tilts her head at him and smirks. “Uh-how do you know?”
, Dean thinks, immediately feeling hysterical over the accidental blasphemy. Fuck, this entire thing is blasphemy. He’s making out with an angel. He has a boner for an angel. An angel. A warrior of heaven, who is his family, but not his
Mindy steps back in, hand on the doorknob. “Well, I hope you’re right,” she says. “At this point I feel like I need a fucking angel to come down from the clouds and give me a miracle.”
Castiel slinks back to the bunker late that night. In his typical way, he makes no fanfare of his arrival. Dean is leaning against the counter having a drink. Maybe he’s had a few already. When he hears
“Still, Dean,” Max looks concerned and Dean wants to figure out how to make him stop feeling pity. “Still. Jesus.”
He wants to tell him that he remembers telling him he wants him, that he remembers Castiel telling him
“Hey, Sammy?” Dean reached across the table and poured himself some more coffee. “You listening? I got something to tell you.”
Dean feels a wave of relief wash over him. He could take a fucking bath in all this relief, catch it in a bucket and make a camp shower. “I mean. Yeah, mostly,” he replies. “‘specially if you live the lifestyle I do. Zero out of ten doctors recommend it.”
I have four separate parts of this fic  with no connective tissue. i'll put two parts in this chapter: the lofty and dramatic exposition, obviously, and also castiel's journey down to hell after his imprisonment to retrieve his sword.
If Dean didn’t know better, he’d say Cas actually looks sorry. “She already has,” he replies. Statement of fact. Cold hard truth.
“If you were like,” he feels likes his whole face must be bright red at this point. “If you were to…describe it. Uh. What would you say.”
He steps closer to Dean, who swallows. “I am tired of you assuming I cannot take care of myself,” he says, his voice low like a storm on the edge of the horizon.
he talks to Dean so much these days. Or if you’d rather, more accurately, he talks to himself all the time lately. He thinks to himself.
Suddenly, Dean has a fucking crazy idea. “Can you come back to the bunker?” he blurts out, before he has the chance to back down. “Don’t force yourself if you don’t want to be here, or if you’re not done your business yet. But. I want you to know. I really want you here. I love it when you’re here. This is where you belong, man. Because you’re my friend too.”
Sam looks up just in time to see Dean and Castiel furious and red-faced, their faces inches apart. Cas has a fist firmly clutching the front of Dean’s shirt and Dean reaches up and grabs the lapels of Castiel’s coat. They both suddenly seem to sober, wide-eyed and panting, as they take in the way they’re groping at each other. The tips of Dean’s ears turn red.
Sam says his name again, whispery and cracked with emotion, and then clears his throat softly. “Do you want me to call up Jody and ask if it’s cool if mom crashes with them? I don’t know if she’ll want to, but at least Jody’ll have a heads up that she could get a visitor, and mom can meet other Hunters?”
“You already apologized,” Castiel said, tilting his head and appraising the photographs he was arranging on the shelf.
The Lord of Hell curls his long white hands around the yellowing bone gate of his palace. “Hail the Lord of the Dreaming,” he rasps through the bars, simpering in a nauseating and unsettling fashion. “What have we done to deserve such an honour?”
Dean shrugs. “I didn’t come here to make you feel bad for me,” he says. “I don’t need anyone to feel bad for me, s’useless,” he flags down the bartender again. “I just wanted you to know that there’s somebody else who gets it, you know? There’s someone else out there who’s been there.”
He hears the feedback from air being blown into the receiver and realizes Castiel has sighed into the phone. “Thank you, Dean.”
,” she echoes mockingly. “What the hell are you doing here, man?” she says quickly, flashing her best
Castiel knocks on the door when Dean is halfway through messily devouring a large pizza by himself. Sam gets up to let him in.
Sam runs his hand through his hair in agitation and sighs, making the noise almost just for the sake of reminding them he’s still there. “All right, who wants music?” he asks, trying to stay casual and keep the vaguely desperate tone out of his voice.
Dean suffers on Earth; Dean goes to Hell. Castiel saves Dean from Hell; Dean suffers on Earth. Dean dies on Earth; Dean goes back to Hell. Cas saved him, and then he could no longer save him, and the cycle is over, and the cycle is ended, and the doors have rusted shut on their hinges, and the windows are sealed shut with paint, and the sun rises, and the moon rises also, and no one left alive still cares that anyone ever tried to live in that house, ever tried to make a go of it, the two of us together.
Castiel won’t have that. He reaches, peels Dean’s trembling fingers away from where they’re clutching his leg and laces their fingers together again with a grip that’s almost violent, like he’s holding onto a fraying rope that’s the only thing keeping him from falling from a cliff into a stormy ocean. He only lets it go when the car stops.
Cas turns back to look at him with a closed off expression. “I assure you it has made perfect sense time and time again.”
Sometimes Dean thinks about the moment at the end when Cas reached for his face and he believed, for a moment, that Cas really was going to kill him after all. He pleaded even then, before suddenly it was all over.
Dean furiously rolls down his window. “Cas, the hell are you doing?” he yells. Castiel keeps walking along the side of the road, eyes fixed firmly forward. “Cas, get in the damn car!”
“…So I’ll probably be back home sometime before sunrise,” Cas speaks carefully, like he’s concerned he’s misinterpreted something, gotten the wires crossed.
He doubles over and throws up on the ground. “I should make you eat that,” Azazel threatens, but he still sounds like he’s having fun standing and watching, doesn’t look ready to move in for the kill just yet.
Cas squeezes his hands once and half sits up, which makes him basically end up straddling Dean with those thighs that make him want to convert to the religion of Castiel’s choosing. “I don’t need a shower,” Cas does that bird head tilt at him again, and Dean scans his face to see if he’s messing with him.
look,” she says. “Plus I was just in there,” she points at the dark windows of the house. “Wanted to get all the facts, you know.”
“Where am I?” Castiel’s wings are sharp. They shine like the long dead stars whose light reaches the world across time and space. He does not avert his gaze.
Cas doesn’t need to breathe like Dean does, so he instantly gains a burst of energy. He snaps his arms up and pushes the monster away with the full force of his current, rather substantial if Dean does say so himself, heavenly grace. The thing topples off the bed and shrieks, nightmare worthy, from the floor where she’s landed. Fight or flight move now. Cas, to his credit as a military battle strategist, chooses flight, which is probably the wisest call given that they’re currently shirtless, half-asleep and without weapons or any poorly pronounced latin incantations.
Dying isn’t the same, when you’re an angel. Humans die and they go to the dust, to the ashes, and so forth. They become the Earth. Their souls move on. A human soul passes through others, on its way to the next plane, the final bus stop. It touches people. It moves through them. When someone dies, their soul rips through the centre of the people closest to them. It’s tangible and it’s violent. Castiel has seen it bring people to their knees. Seen it control heartbeats.
“For telling me, you doofus,” Sam grinned at him. “Duh. Thanks for trusting me. I’m happy for you, man, I’m really happy for you. I’m proud of you.”
In all honesty, it would have been an infinitely more pleasant way to spend my time. I miss the bunker already. I wish to return to it as soon as possible.
“Where’s Castiel?” she asks, endeavouring to keep her voice cheerful. She wants to cry, but she knows he would think that it was about him, that him loving and being in love is something that makes her sad. She’s hurt because he’s hurt, she’s scarred by everything that scarred him. Mary can’t show her son how much she aches for him, it would only add to his pain. His pain is not about her, especially because he lost her so long ago, but that almost makes it worse. She wasn’t there. She wasn’t there.
Cas, who considers himself Sam’s friend, has the decency to look mollified. Dean however, who considers himself Sam’s family, still carries out his card-carrying right to be obnoxious. “Well, if Cas would stop being Mr. Mysterious over here and just answer the damn questions!”
Dean grins. "Oh my god, nothing, just...like it's still so weird hearing you swear. And I can't think of that many expletives that would just be.... more on the nose."
“We’re not-I mean, I don’t know, maybe we are, now, I-” he’s talking fast and cuts himself off self-consciously, trailing off and cracking his knuckles.
Dean moved closer to get a better look. He saw Benjamin’s vessel, and Ishim’s, but he can’t seem to see any other- “Hey, are you in these?” he asked.
Suddenly, the dream tilted sideways and Dean was fully himself, in his own room, on his knees staring up at Castiel. The angel smiled down at him and carded his fingers gently through his hair, before swiping his thumb through the mess just underneath Dean’s lip. “You’re so good, Dean,” he said affectionately, reverently. “So good.”
Dean shrugs on his jacket and stalks out. He stops in the doorway and turns back to face Castiel. “I’m gonna save him, okay?” he says. “I’m gonna save my little brother. I’m gonna save my damn family.”
If they never talk about it then they never have to deal with any of the lingering questions that are about as light and fluffy as a brick through a window.
They turn off the light to sleep and Dean rolls onto his side, pulling on Castiel’s arm to urge him to slot in behind him. Cas gets the hint and throws an arm over Dean’s stomach, pulling him tight into his chest and pressing his nose and lips to the nape of Dean’s neck.
“You were only killed because you allowed yourself to be killed,” Every eye is fixed on him. “You turned your back because you believed you owed a debt to the Universe. You were playing heads or tails with your own life, Russian Roulette with your own soul. So in the end, you were Testing Us. You were Tempting Us,” The wings flutter, as if to scold. To say
“Oh Dream,” she says, notes of sadness playing in her voice. He looks up again at the use of his name, the only one that has survived eternity, across language and thought and idea and
Lester Morris is staring nervous and excited through his window shield at the dark house, his dark moustache practically twitching with voyeuristic anticipation. Dean approached the passenger side and swung in without fanfare. Idiot should keep his damn doors locked.
"So this is where you went,” there’s no emotion to his song. It’s deadpan. Matter of fact. Resigned.
She moves so fast. He chokes out his last breaths with the blade buried deep in his chest. When the sputtering and struggling stops, she yanks it out and wipes it on his jacket.
He drags him backwards, Dean’s legs kicking and digging at the ground as he tries to escape. It doesn’t appear to hinder him at all. He sits down against the grave of Dean’s father, tightening his grip as he forces Dean to either lie down or be choked to death. “Shh,” he gently strokes Dean’s hair in a mockery of a soothing gesture.
It’s hours later when Dean is fitfully dreaming in his room in the bunker (and how crazy is that still? His own bedroom!) that the door creaks open. The sound wakes him instantly; years of a Hunter lifestyle has made him the lightest sleeper on Earth. Even the quiet flutter of angel wings would probably rouse him.
The worst part though, was after she had carefully helped him arrange his little brother in his arms, (
“He killed John,” a tear rolls down her cheek. Then another. And another. “H-he-he k-killed my parents. He killed-he killed
Castiel arches his eyebrows and smirks at him. “If there’s a more effective way to convey your interest to a man than rebelling against heaven for him, by all means let me know.”
He rushes to her side and throws himself down in the dirt next to her, wrapping her up in his arms. She chokes and crumples into him, the side of her face pressed into his chest almost painfully. “Shh,” he says, rocking her, stroking her hair. “It’s okay, it’s okay.” He’s never felt so helpless in his entire life, not even in Hell. He knows it’s not okay. Jesus Christ, he’s never known it more. He just can’t think of anything else to fucking say.
They sit there in each other’s company in comfortable silence for a moment, before Castiel looks at Dean and frowns, his expression visible in the semi-dark thanks to the dim lamp Dean left on to help chase the nightmares away. He tilts his head. “Would you or Sam be angry if I ripped Crowley’s heart out of his chest?”
“Uh-” For a moment Sam thought about explaining the war in Heaven to his brain-damaged brother, but then decided against it. “No. He’s gonna drive.”
I wrote this as a coda for season 13 episode 19 "funeralia", the episode where we find out naomi is alive. (extra huge congrats to her for surviving the series, I'm pretty sure tptb literally forgot she existed)
“I’m glad,” Cas says. There’s nothing particularly effusive or outwardly emotional about his tone, but it’s Cas and yeah he does sound like he is
“Dean, I can’t ask you to-” she says, confused. “We just met-” At that, Dean can’t help but let out a hysterical, wounded laugh. Mary studies his face in silent shock.
“You don’t have anyone, Dean,” a glorious epiphany passes over his face like a sunrise. “You don’t have anyone to hide behind anymore,” he kicks him in the stomach.
He was given the best chance, the best fucking chance anyone has ever gotten in the world, to save his family. And he failed. He just
He’s breathing heavily, she can hear how fast his heart is pounding. “Yeah?” he retorts harshly. “Well, you’re a worthless demon dyke! And you work for me now. So get in there and do your job, you freak!”
“Christ, Cas!” Dean finally cracked all the way through his fake pleasant tone. “Why ask us to come with you if you don’t want us to know shit?”
She smiles suggestively at him. “No need to freak out,” she blinks slow, emphasizing her long eyelashes. “Just thought you looked lonely,” she winks at him and feels a sudden surge of red black dark deep hatred rise like bile in her throat when his eyes widen even further. He looks at her like he actually might touch her. A wave of revulsion makes her shudder minutely. Never mind. She doesn’t want to play around any more.
“Oh I know,” he says. “I know. But life did not stop. The Dreaming still exists without me. It’s better if I’m there. But it still goes on without me.”
i'd be amazed i passed up the chance to describe dean getting murdered by metatron if i didnt know that tragically cas did not witness that. and i did commit to his pov.
Castiel was at the gate to Hell. It had been many years since he has visited. In the past, when he and the angels spoke, he would travel with them as they went to visit Lucifer, their brother in Creation, the creator and former ruler of this domain.
Dean bites his lip. “Hey Cas,” he looks at him from under his eyelashes and sucks suggestively on a finger that’s messy with pizza sauce. Sam feels like he’s fallen into a parallel universe.
“Thank you Cas,” Sam pulls him into a hug. Castiel’s arms stay at his sides for a moment before he overcomes his surprise and returns the embrace before Sam makes his exit.
Castiel stands next to the foot of the bed, like a marble angel guarding his grave. Guarding his family’s graves.
He’s bleeding when he turns to look at her, eyes wild with anger. She almost hopes he tries to take a swing back. Just see what happens, pal. Just you try it and find out.
Dean wishes he could disappear into the floor. "Oh fuck that was such a horrible thing to say, I'm so sorry," his voice is small and ashamed and he's just praying he doesn't actually cry right now because that would be so fucking pathetic and he doesn't want Cas to feel sorry for him. This is why they never talk about shit. Because he can't have an adult conversation, man to man, without acting like a goddamn child.
Sometimes, she gets hit with waves of sadness that make her dizzy and give her goosebumps. She’ll never not be ultimately glad that she’s alive, but there’s grief embedded inside her stomach like a knotted root when she thinks of the decades she missed. When Dean was young, he was always growing, growing so fast. She remembers being so terrified of missing things, missing milestones and first moments, that sometimes at night she would lie awake, her heart beating in her throat, too full of love and fear to move or speak. She would think about him growing up and find herself sobbing, inconsolable.
“Can’t I just want to talk?” Castiel sounds a touch amused, a touch fond, but the fond part is probably just all in Dean’s head. Wishful fucking thinking.
Space and Time are one and the same, and he travels through them now. It is not linear, but then again time is only linear by illusion. For simplicity’s sake, we all get one narrative to follow. One life to live.
says a voice. It’s coming from everywhere, sounds like it’s coming from the sky up above them, filling in this absence of space.
Dean was blushing red to the tips of his ears. “Thanks, uh,” his voice cracked and he felt tears pushing at the back of his eyes. What the fuck. “Thanks, Sammy.”
He stumbled into the library to see Sam already up and working. “You get enough sleep, nerd?” he teased. “Or have you been translating shit all night?”
that he’s replayed over and over in his dreams and see the ugly unvarnished truth hidden underneath. Warts and all. Jesus, no wonder he got out of there as fast as he damn well could.
Dean blushed and hid his face in Castiel’s coat. “S’embarrassing,” he mumbled from somewhere in his shoulder.
, cracking his mind open, flaying his memories. Naomi might have her own vendetta here, might resent him for being so incredibly, chronically inept at bending to the will of Heaven but he couldn't deny the practicality of her plan. Dean was notoriously hard to kill. Dean had not followed orders, had knocked the whole game off the table and what was worse is he'd pulled Cas down with him. As if he would let any other angel kill him. As if anyone else could get so close. Sometimes, Cas allows himself to believe that Dean must love him.
He moves to sit up and turn the lamp off and Cas mumbles in protest. “Oh relax,” he says. “I’m just turning off the light,” he flips the switch and quickly finds his way back to his
“Well geez Mary, you sure don’t meet any nice people around here do you?” Dean jokes, but there’s no humour in his wobbling tone.
He thinks he can see the ruins of old civilizations reflected in Castiel’s unbearably deep and sad eyes. “Because I know you won’t remember.”
Castiel smiles like he wants to cry. “You know, I’ve been around a long time. So long, that calling it a
By the end it was just a matter of prey drive. He stalked Dean in the warehouse like an animal. He stalked him like they were both animals and the only thing in their lives that propelled them to step forward was the knowledge that one was to kill, and the other was to be killed. There was no possible chance of Dean overpowering him. Castiel’s only reaction to his feeble attempts to run, to hide, to defend himself was an overwhelming sense of disgust, accompanied by a surge of annihilating pity, like the sense of looking at a pathetic suffering thing and wanting to destroy it. To put it out of its misery.
She has the presence of mind to heave his body out of the driver’s seat and onto the floor of the back.
He feels vulnerable, pinned down by the weight of Castiel’s suddenly intense stare. “What kind of family are we, Dean?” he squints and furrows his eyebrows, tilting his head. Dean feels himself involuntarily tilt his head in empathetic response, as if he’s attached to him by a fucking invisible string.
“Yes,” everything becomes empty. So dark. Nothing. “And No,” light returns. Colours ebb and flow through space. “We are Both. We must be Both. The universe cannot be balanced otherwise.”
she thinks. “Super!” she declares, bright and sarcastic. “Listen, you sold your soul for this crap, so -”
“I’m good,” Dean shoots back instantly, not turning his head. The muscles in his jaw continue to clench and unclench and he keeps twisting his hands slowly on the wheel. Cas frowns and shifts in the backseat, continuing to glare at the back of Dean’s head like it’s gravely offended him.
They end up sitting at the tiny motel table, talking quietly while Dean sits happily watching crappy television.
On Earth, the sun rises. The colours shine on the lake, which is so still, like glass ready to be shattered. It is a beautiful day.
Dean’s jaw works a few times and Sam steps in. “Good morning guys!” he says, forcing a smile and going for the coffee. “Hey Cas, what’s that you were saying about an angel friend?”
He breathed in deep through his nose. “No, I know,” he stepped properly into the room. “But I just...listen-you know I’m not the greatest at communication right?” Cas snorted softly and Dean pushed lightly at his shoulder. “Hey man, I’m trying here,” he joked. His hand was still on Castiel’s shoulder. He let it slide slowly off, rubbing his thumb on the shoulder seam of his coat.
) but he knows that if she had crowded into his space and looked at him with those soul-bruised eyes, let alone made physical contact, he would’ve burst into tears like that crybaby four-year-old kid she wishes he still was.
“You know, Mary,” he looks at her. “Dean wants to trust people. Honesty is very important to him,” he frowns. “He’s been hurt before by those, me included, who were doing what they thought was right, was for the greater good, but ultimately chose to conceal it from him. There’s some element of hypocrisy there, occasionally, because he has not always shared the truth himself, and has made reckless decisions without thought of how his loved ones would feel if he put himself in harm’s way,” he says. “But he puts family above everything. He needs you to trust him back.”
He watched as the boy across from him and above him made a small aborted hip thrust and felt himself choke. Teen Dean pulled himself off of Woodshop What’s-His-Face and he felt the dick slide out of his mouth. “Don’t move,” He heard himself say, before feeling himself take a deep breath and gamely try again.
Dean feels a lot like he'd been punched. In the face, maybe. Or one of those places that makes you piss your pants. He'd heard once that could happen.
“What?” he pulled himself back from his post-Coming Out To My Baby Brother reverie. “Oh-uh, not yet, no. Just you.”
“It’s okay, um,” he resisted the urge to run from the bunker and never ever come back ever. “It doesn’t always have to be a secret from people we know… you know? We can talk about it in front of him sometime. Thanks,” he finished lamely, and then promptly jumped out of his skin when Castiel walked into the room carrying a plate of toast and a bottle of honey shaped like a bear.
my plan was to write an au heavily inspired by the universe of the sandman comics. cas was dream, anna was death, and naomi was destiny. dean was a prince imprisoned in hell for centuries by azazel, who had usurped lucifer. he had been taught to torture by the corinthian, a wayward nightmare who called itself alastair. dean himself is a pseudo-tulpa born out of his father's desire for the perfect heir.
Mary seems to know that there’s nothing she can say or do in this moment that will make it okay, short of
“I won’t control people,” Castiel says. “I won’t lead them. I will take your power. I will help them. And I will love them.”
He just laughs, not even wiping it, just letting it slide disgusting and slippery down his cheek. “You know what he was thinking when I killed him? He was thinking about what a fucking pathetic excuse for a miracle you were. A pale imitation of a good soldier.”
“No seriously man,” Dean says. “If you were giving someone directions would you just go-” he clicks his tongue. “‘Well, just take any road, it doesn’t matter what choices you make.’ Because that’s just fucking ridiculous. I say it does, okay? I say it does. I say that people’s choices? People’s lives? Fucking matter,” he sets his jaw and tries to ignore the tears springing to his eyes anew. “So why’d you send me back?” he demands.
anyway,” he says, bitterness tinging his voice. “Oh they would have tried, but as soon as they saw the devastation caused by chaining up Death, they would be too afraid to do anything but release You and beg for Your mercy.”
…Yeah, he, uh-he told me that, uh, this was happening, so I just wanted to come down and make sure it gets done right,” he puts emphasis on
“You’re good too, Cas,” Dean brings the palm of Castiel’s hand up to his mouth and brushes his lips against it gently. “Couldn’t do this without you. Belong with me.”
fucking job killing witches if he does say so himself. I mean, Cas does tell him to wait in the car and does kill two out of three, but he got that one in the stairs. He can’t lie, it feels good to know that even after he got glitter bombed with the Dory curse, he’s still got it.
makes him feel like one of those corpses they’re always fraudulently taking a peek at post-autopsy, all flayed open, possibly with his liver torn out by werewolves.
Dean, who had been struck still with horror and fear during this inhuman assault, runs forward swinging the sword up high. Almost with an air of boredom, Azazel flicks his hand and Dean goes flying, the sound of air and wind ending with a dull sickening thud as he smacks unceremoniously into his parent’s graves.
Dean raised his arm and his gun was struck down. Castiel struck him down. “No, Cas,” back to begging again. Interesting. “No!” he raised his hand weakly as if he could somehow hold Castiel back.
“Yeah, hey Cas,” Sam says, scratching his ear and angling away from Dean, who’s sitting on the bed kicking his feet looking like he’s never had a care in the world. Or, more accurately, like he can’t remember the weight of the world ever being put in his shoulders.
A gay witch walks into the bar and that sounds like an opening, a warm-up patter. The start of some greasy crude joke told by a man in a camo baseball cap to some other men clutching beer bottles around the neck with dry, chapped hands in a Hunter’s pub somewhere.
Another beat of silence, and Dean can’t stand to be in this staring contest of misery anymore. He flicks his eyes back down to the floor. Sam, mercifully, doesn’t try to push him. “I’ll go make the call,” he says, swallowing, his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat. “And then I’ll go talk to mom and see what she thinks, maybe talk about her plans.”
, and she was never more aware of the complexity and fragility of humanity than when she was watching her eldest son. She remembers with excruciating clarity the first time Dean held Sam in his soft little boy arms. The moment when he looked up at her face, wide-eyed baby tooth smile and eyes full of wonder, and asked if he could hold the baby, she felt like her heart was being squeezed in a fist. She whispered,
“I love you,” Cas said it like someone would state the overwhelmingly obvious, like a person trapped in the rain might say
Dean ended up spending some quality time with the punching bag. He stopped when his hands started to burn and retreated to his room with the door closed. What the hell was he supposed to get up to now? He was glad that America seemed to be so fucking safe right now, but he was crawling out of his skin with frustration without shit to do.
and let himself forget the whole rulebook that went along with Platonic Hugs Between Straight Buddies. He could remind himself again of all the reasons why Dean and Cas could never be
The reunion lasts for a pathetic amount of time before Billie explains the deal. Mary and Castiel look at him in horror while Dean, ever the martyr, sets his jaw and makes it clear who he intends to be the Winchester that dies tonight. Mary rushes forward with no hesitation, and Castiel feels a wave of deep love and deep sadness wash over him. How will he ever get these brave, stupid, beautiful people to stop lining up to throw themselves on the sword?
Jane looks at her. Gazing into her eyes makes her feel like she’s making eye contact with a frightened deer. The thought comparison feels strange to her. She’s never even seen a deer up close.
Dean’s eyes fill with tears again. “Yeah,” his voice is rough. “Yeah. I-” he breathes out. “I remember.”
She wishes she could somehow make it so he could remember that day more vividly than the image of her burning on the ceiling of his little brother’s nursery.
“Your brother Sam needs our help,” Castiel says, feeling for the angel blade in his sleeve. “And I can’t leave you alone in your current state. Get in the car, I’ll drive.”
anyway, I used that Reveal as a way to kick off the idea of dean and cas actually talking about What Happened That Night.
that overly familiar name, as if he had the right. As if they had any claim to each other. That was the only thing that every single one of them had done.
“He seems to be...losing his memory?” Sam’s voice lowers to a stage whisper and he turns his back entirely on Dean, who’s now perked up on the edge of the bed and is unsubtly trying to eavesdrop. “I’m in over my head Cas, I could really use some help here.”
Dean abruptly stood up and stormed out of the room. Sam and Castiel watched him go, Sam with a mixed expression of concern and amusement, Castiel with his head tilted, looking bewildered.
He feels himself blushing in embarrassment and schools his features to frown at Cas. “Geez!” he can feel the tips of his ears turning red. “Wear a bell or something!”
” Mindy groans. “Don’t remind me,” she chews her lip. “He’s making everything so fucking impossible. I can’t imagine why he gives a shit, it’s not like he gives a shit about
melting away into sadness and shame. He clutches the damaged pictures and weeps like a child, lets a whine slip out of his throat and build until his shoulders are shaking with it.
Cas might as well have covered himself in ice. "Why would we? It has nothing to do with you," and oh fuck that maybe hurts Dean's feelings just a little bit.
They said so many pretty things before he punched them to the dirt and they stopped saying anything at all, pretty or otherwise. They begged him, swore on past oaths, on friendship. He slashed their throats and watched human blood, not inhuman shiny grace, pool from the wound as they collapsed to the ground, green eyes dead and unseeing.
“Oh,” Dean raises his eyebrows. “Thanks for telling me then. Now I don’t have to worry at all about the potential consequences of you bringing your little sister back to life. It’s all fixed.”
Dean breathes in deep through his nose. “I did that,” he says. “What you did. Worse though, because I had to outsource and it, you know, cost me my soul.” Max goes hm. He’s not so much surprised that Dean has done this than he is surprised that he chose to share. He doesn’t get the impression Dean really opens up a hell of a lot, especially to strange men he’s barely met.
Dean choked on his coffee. “Uh, I don’t know? I haven’t really thought much about it, uh, I-maybe I guess?”
Tongues lick each set of his teeth. “I won’t leave with you, of course,” Alastair says. “I’m not a fucking idiot. I didn’t come this far and rise this high just to be unmade in one burst of your will and forgotten like so many fever dreams.”
On top of all this, he went out for groceries in the evening and when he came back he was 90% sure they’d had angry sex on the War Room table.
Castiel is there. He is impossibly large, a giant holding them in the palm of his hand. The lines in his palm are a valley, the slope of his wrist is a mountain.
His voice is watery, small like a child. “I know,” he almost whispers. “But I-” tears spill over his eyelashes and his mouth trembles. “I can’t,” he digs at his hands, the cuts and scratches he’s got from pulling at the tree. “I just. Not yet. Not yet.”
“He’s-” Sam doesn’t really know how to answer that question. “He’s happy I think? But he’s forgetting everything. He can’t even remember his own
He feels tears slip silently down his cheeks. “I missed you so much Castiel,” he almost whispers, his voice is suddenly so hoarse with emotion. “I just wanted to see you one last time.”
Cas laughs. That sound in itself is so startling, so rare and so out of place in this trainwreck of a conversation that for a moment Dean has to imagine that his feet are weighed down by concrete in order to prevent himself from just bolting out of the room.
They aren’t the same people that they were, and they never will be. Dean never had a fucking chance at a normal family, or a normal life, ever since the yellow-eyed demon marked out his baby brother to be the Chosen One or whatever. He can fight, beg, and pray, but there’s no hope on God’s green Earth of reversing their given fate. His chance at happiness went up in smoke when he was barely old enough to read, and he can never escape what he was raised to be.
