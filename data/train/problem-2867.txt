Another fight, more pain, both pale in comparison to what's at stake. You will get him back or die trying, you've never been so sure of anything. You're a soldier once more but willingly this time, this time it's for a cause you believe in.
"Who released what? Jack? Come on!" But it was no use. "Why would I be mad? Jack, what did you do?" He whispered.
You found a home in a place meant for war, a routine in a job that had none, love in a being that wasn't supposed to care, and trust in a brother you should have given up on according to your father. Everything in your life is a contradiction and it took so long, almost more strength than you had, but now you have it all.
"No, Dad, that's not what this is at all. Cas is a guy and also an actual Angel of the Lord. He's a close friend of ours, what Benny meant earlier is simply that-"
And there was something in the way Sam genuinely cared that broke Dean's resolve, after all those years, he couldn't do it anymore. Before he knew it he was gasping for air like a drowning man, fighting down the emotion.
To his surprise, Dean found that they were in good enough spirits to each grab a beer and relax for a few minutes before they departed for some well-deserved rest. He marveled at the fact that the two of them had come out of this alive and yet it wasn't enough. 'Cas,' he began to pray, 'if you can hear me...,'
"He'll be here any second. Just sit." Sam insisted tiredly. So of course John stayed exactly where he was, proud as ever.
Bobby stared right back with that look he always got when he was in deep concentration. "But the thing is, these types of deals always go wrong Dean. Always. You know that," he said earnestly. Dean sighed.
As if it wasn't bad enough that Bobby knew something, his Mom had guessed it too and she had barely been around Cas. How obvious had he been acting? Dean felt completely dumbfounded, he had been so sure that nobody would ever know. But as it turned out the only person who didn't know was the one who deserved to know the most. His throat was closing up on him again.
"I don't care if it says it's an Angel, if it's not human you kill it. I never expected you to be this weak Dean. I don't recognize the son I raised. Sam was lost from the beginning but you-"
And that's the problem. The most awe-inspiring presence in your life, your source of hope, your reason to go on, is a man. An Angel, yes, but also a man. He doesn't belong here and he belongs nowhere more than here.
He couldn't get a single word in, Sam rushed out his explanation right away and entirely unasked. "I'm sorry, I know I'm late, before you say anything I swear it wasn't my fault," he gestured appeasingly, "My boss called minutes before I wanted to leave. I swear I would've been on time otherwise, Cas was there, he's my witness. I hope it's okay that I brought him. I think you'll get along and he seemed like he could use a drink." No wonder the kid was such a good lawyer, he well and truly lived his job.
His voice echoed unpleasantly in Dean's mind. His brother only knew half of how true it was that they'd have lost without Cas, how he alone had been the one thing that drove Chuck's plan awry and made them become self-aware.
________________________________
Obviously, he had had his suspicions, way before Dean had told him anything, at least about Dean's side of the situation. He had given up hope for them a while ago knowing that Dean would jump out of a driving car before he would tell him anything. As fragile as he was now with Cas gone, knowing he'd been right didn't do him any good because Dean was suffering and still refused to talk.
Despite the painful memory and how unlikely it seemed, Bobby's words did wake the tiniest flicker of hope in him. It was probably foolish to allow himself even that much but he couldn't help it. Ever since they lost Cas every part of him was in pain caused by regret and unbearable longing. He wanted to hope so bad even if it would only crush him again later.
"Really I shouldn't even be surprised," mumbled Sam.
He hoped by taking up a shift watching over Jack and seeing if Bobby knew anything about magically induced comas he could reduce some of the weight resting on his brother's shoulders. Even if it was Dean himself who was putting the weight there.
"We're brothers," Dean added as an explanation, just in case, and kicked Sam under the table for good measure.
"Hold up," said Bobby, "Chuck?"
Either way, so far their conversation hadn't generated any new information. Even if Bobby had some ideas about Jack's current state, that didn't mean they had any ideas on how to wake him. Him being God only further complicated the situation.
That made Dean even uneasier than he already had been. Ever since they defeated Chuck a plan had been beginning to form in the back of his mind but he hadn't allowed himself to fully formulate or voice it. Thinking about it alone made him feel guilty. But now, should it truly be up to luck, he'd go for it.
So you chase the prayers out of your mind because you know the consequences, know what your father would say, know that your Angel would never listen to one of your prayers again if he knew. Yet he is always there when you ask for him and the knowledge alone is driving you insane. You wonder how much he knows but he is unreadable.
Sam snorted, "that's your problem here? Really?"
"That's not a reason," Bobby argued.
"You don't know the last thing about right or wrong. Dean saved us all the way." Black eye.
That did get a genuine if startled laugh from Dean while Sam buried his face in his hands for a second having forgotten about his own throw-away comment from earlier. He quickly got over it though and turned to tell Bobby all about how wonderful Eileen was. So wonderful in fact that Dean soon had enough of it but it was good to see his little brother happy for once.
Later that same day Sam found himself in Jack's room with Mary and Bobby to either side of him, staring down at the unconscious kid. He had only seen Dean in passing who continuously paced between Jack's room and the library. Always reading something that might help get Cas back, always checking on Jack. Sam knew he'd break sooner or later and he hated it but Dean didn't even want to be in the same room as him at the moment.
When his thoughts caught up to him he broke out into a run. The circumstances surrounding the plea were kind of fuzzy in his head, it happened so long ago, he had done so much to suppress the memory. Thinking of it now felt just as shocking as hearing it for the first time.
At first, Mary had wearily kept her distance but within minutes she got over her shock and was now sitting on the edge of Jack's bed.
Sam scratched his neck and tried to find an answer that didn't sound entirely insane. Mary offered him a small knowing smile.
Dean flinched away from the topic, getting more uncomfortable by the second. "Since when do we talk about stuff like this?" He complained.
They drove home in silence. Jack and Chuck had vanished in a flare of light and left them in the middle of nowhere. Their physical injuries were gone but the exhaustion and raw nerves remained. They couldn't be sure of their victory just yet. Mile after mile of scenery passed them and the silence stretched on, turned into fear of failure. Until finally, people started to reappear.
Steeling himself for a reaction he tried to look anywhere but at Bobby. "I'm doing it anyway. Whether you help me or not," he mumbled.
Sending them away left him with a sinking feeling in his stomach but it was for the better.
Maybe Bobby would drop it and accept that as usual, his Dean wasn't making any sense. Then he'd still feel like a liar but he also wouldn't have to confront the truth. Wouldn't have to confront whether the guy he practically thought of as a father would think differently of him or not.
The truth was if he told them, nothing would stop him from mourning openly. Even worse, they'd ask questions and force him to deal with it and there were no words in the world that described how much he couldn't do that. He'd rather hold onto the pain because the bigger part of himself was convinced he deserved it.
He shook out of it quickly. Things did change, they were living proof for that. Allowing himself a moment to consider how grown up his little brother looked, he could note with satisfaction that there was no way that John had had more of an impact on Sam than he had. Sam was a better man on his worst days than John on his best and Dean wasn't about to take credit for that but he liked to think that he helped.
But brilliant and nonhuman as he is, he won't have it. So in the single most painful moment, he takes the choice away from you. He looks at you like he had expected you to say something first, hurt through years of silence. Your heart damn near fails because you can already feel the soul-deep sorrow settling over you. And he says to you everything you ever wanted to hear and never dared to hope for. And he says it to you as he dies.
"He said 'they're all back,' that's what we wanted, right? Maybe he was just telling us he succeeded?" Sam said hopefully but Dean didn't buy it.
______________________________
John snapped to attention at the familiar name. "Singer?" He asked in disbelief and grimaced. The others ignored him.
Complying for the moment they ushered him to the kitchen. Dean didn't ask why they had fought before he came in, but he knew he wouldn't leave his little brother alone in the same room with that man again if he could avoid it.
Dean and Cas exchanged a short glance of mutual agreement, the kind they had to practice to get sneaky ideas past the DM. It almost made him smirk how quickly they managed to get on the same page. No way in hell were they telling Sam they knew each other through DnD. That was something only other true RPG players would get to hear, the patronizing smiles and nerd jokes got old too quickly to mention it to others. They made their way toward the table in silent agreement.
"If all is well, then whose power do we have to match?" He deadpanned. "Should have known something was going to go wrong," he stated coldly.
"Nothing is too much to get Cas back," he replied in an instant and saw his mistake in the very next second. He felt his ears redden as Sam just tilted his head in his direction as if he were waiting for further admissions.
Memories you didn't know you had come back to you. Late nights with your Angel's head rested on your shoulder in a rare tranquility, hugs that lasted longer than you thought they had, last words that were tempered with, and goodbyes changed ever so slightly that their meaning would never be the same. You treasure it all even as it hurts enough to burn away your very essence.
"Hello Dean," Cas said and even though his tone betrayed no emotion there did seem to be a glint of surprise in his eyes. They both glanced at Sam for an explanation who unhelpfully looked back and forth between them, seemingly just as taken aback that Cas knew Deans' name as they were about meeting in a bar, on a Tuesday night.
_________________________________
Dean downed his drink. Sam had guessed that he wasn't straight. The kid had guessed it. He reached for his glass again, wishing it weren't empty already. Cas looked at him like a deer caught in the headlights before he also downed his drink. His vision was tilting. Sam had guessed it, just like that. With his head in his hands, he took a deep breath and tried to figure out how that made him feel.
"Here we go again," grumbled Bobby. "I'm not bailing your ass out of Hell when you inevitably butch it up son. I like the guy too but there is a line. Do you even remember when you still believed that what is dead should stay dead?"
Sam took the liberty of splashing them both with holy water. Then himself and Dean. They went through the whole ordeal with all the book asked for before finally allowing them further into the hallway.
Three seconds. He and Sam got up at the same time that John did, each holding one of his arms in place as he attempted to storm toward Benny. They stopped his momentum a bare step away from their friend who seized them and their struggling father up with a calm expression.
Glancing at Sam he found that unwavering loyalty that he had so unfairly hoped for and to his relief Sam understood.
Internally Dean felt more beat down than he had in days. The entire time he was itching to get back to his research, none of this brought him any closer to Cas. At the same time, he had to at least try and spare his mother the pain of seeing the man John had turned into after she died.
They changed the subject pretty quickly after that and found themselves engrossed in a deep discussion of Cas' work and the upcoming fundraiser, and to Dean's surprise it turned out to be pretty pleasant. In the end, they were all just making fun of their bosses and had completely lost track of what they were trying to discuss. Sam had long since forgotten that he still didn't know how they met. Or so they thought.
Cas seized him up, apparently trying to guess how far he could go before he reasoned, "Also, if you don't help me I can make it look like our 'break up' was your fault in front of Sam." Dean's smile died on his lips.
"Don't lecture me. You came up with the comparison first," Cas complained.
Somehow you now finally trust your brother, you see what he saw, you can finally tell that it was your father who was wrong, that his orders were cruel, that you can be good without being what he wanted you to be. He didn't know of Angels, he would have tried to kill them if he did. But there is one Angel in your life who is better than all the others, you know you'll never kill him come what may. Take what your father would have wanted you to do with you to the grave.
From a distance, he studied his father for another second to gather his courage. The man hadn't aged a day, the same unforgiving brooding anger resided behind his eyes and Sam instantly felt like a College student without a place to call home again. Some wounds didn't heal with time.
(I know this chapter is comparatively short but I thought a short chapter is better than none at all, I might stick to this length from now on tbh)
Bobby nodded, "didn't remember him as the socially gifted kind but I guess he knew what he was doing with a half angelic child," he shrugged his approval. "Who will look after him when he wakes up? You know, in case Cas won't be-" he let the sentence hang in the air and a brief look of guilt crossed his face for bringing it up. Sam stifled a smile, Bobby had never been good at hiding his big heart.
No way around it, he figured, the others would find out sooner or later anyway and he was way too exhausted for lies or secret scheming. "I'll get him back," he swallowed heavily, his tone leaving no room for debate. The others snapped to attention and stared at him, safe for Sam who was already on his side. "I don't care what it takes. It's not a victory until I have him back and I'm done accepting losses. Not this time. Not him."
Before he could stop himself from falling into old patterns Sam began to stutter explanations under his Dad's indifferent stare. He hated it but he couldn't stay silent either.
He is always there and yet there is nothing that can keep him for long, the only moments he allows himself to linger are when he's talking to you, and it's starting to go to your head. It's irritating at first but the irritation quickly turns into fondness as the moments in which he stays grow ever longer.
It almost brought a smile to his lips when he now thought about how Chuck had been forced to bring Cas back to keep control over Dean. Really that was when Chuck had lost, when Cas had become more important than him to his story. Now he met his brother's eyes, looking for just a hint of understanding.
After everything that had happened, he decided then and there that he'd never be his father's soldier again. He'd gladly welcome him back, but Cas' words still echoed way too clearly in his head for anything beyond that '-You are not your daddy's blunt little tool-' he heard it, over and over again.
Hesitating for a moment Sam considered how well they knew each other but he ended up also hugging Benny. The guy had helped them get Bobby back after all. The quick but firm hug earned him some startled laughter from Dean but Benny simply clapped him on the back and smiled. The whole scene made Dean strangely happy.
The phone line in Dean's head went dead and left him with white noise while he tried to compute. 'Why on earth would he want me for that? Isn't he trying to make a good impression?'
Sam sighed deeply as if he were the one under investigation. "You guys could have just told me that you used to date. It's not a big deal."
At least John remained silent though his bloodied face clearly read 'way to make me believe you're not just a monster'. Dean contently ignored it, he knew now how he could get the man to listen.
That action alone was enough to send the better part of his confidence to hell. There was hardly anything he hated more than feeling scrutinized and judged. Ironically it was the opposite for Sam, who'd rather be judged than ignored like he was at the moment. Their father knew this. He was playing them both but unlike so many other times before, Dean would not cave.
"So Gabriel is the one on your side?" Dean asked. The picture that was beginning to form between Cas's job essentially debunking Christian ideology, his older brother actively making said job difficult, the weird religious names, and his DnD angel character looked less than pleasant. He was really beginning to wonder what was going on in Cas's head, they intuitively got along and worked well together, and yet the guy remained unreadable. Cas merely nodded in response.
"What's so funny?" Cas asked, frowning with mild alarm.
Missing Cas had by now turned into a physical ache. He was vaguely aware of the comfort that having his family in the house provided and for once allowed himself to be okay with it. Even if Jack was still knocked out. Maybe Cas would just come home like the others. Maybe.
Something was seriously wrong with Dean and he didn't think it had anything to do with seeing his father get the crap punched out of him. He felt Sam look at him but couldn't meet his eye, chest constricting more with every second.
"I know you'll have to monster check me first but I found the kid creeping around your front door," he nodded towards Kevin who rolled his eyes. "Swears he knows you two. Since when do you have this place anyway?" Bobby said in lieu of a greeting.
That finally made him pause. Sam carefully let go of him, breathing heavily. He gestured for John to wait and grabbed a box with hunting utensils from the table that they kept there just in case. His father understood and had at least the patience to stick to custom.
Naturally, that is when it gets snatched away from you again. After you thought you had lost and regained, through hardship, everything that matters to you. Your story ends as it began, an absent father figure screwing you over in ways you only comprehend years down the road. After being thrown around time and time again you decided, no, not this time.
After a few minutes of wistful silence, Bobby fixed Dean with a questioning stare that didn't quite betray his intention, "The whole deal with God being the final evil must have really knocked Cas out of the game. Where is he anyway?"
It takes a long time but in the end, your brother and your son are with you as you retrieve your Angel. It nearly killed all of you,b but you are not the only one who owes the Angel, all of you soldier on with purpose, no matter what happens. You are restless and hardly dare to hope but he is so worth it all.
Once they got back to the bunker they had practically crashed with exhaustion. After sleeping through the better part of two days and frantically checking if anybody else had come back yet to no avail he had begun his research. An hour in Sam had decided to join him, if only for the distraction.
"Dean, are you okay?" Cas inquired carefully. He barely registered the hand on his forearm, his brain had given over the control to autopilot.
Before he could fall back into justifying himself or let his swirling mind catch up, the library door burst open. Dean stormed in. He stopped mere steps away, unsure of what to do or say.
"What's with all the fuss? Just give the guy a beer," he scoffed.
Sam instantly fell for the distraction, "We are more likely to win the case if the funding for the remaining research is secure," he continued in his no-nonsense voice, original question completely forgotten. "Otherwise I think the conservative old guy who happens to be the judge might side against us cause arguing on behalf of a project that might not happen isn't worth it."
They stay on your mind. You think your father wanted you to know that your crime too, was to exist. Should you be like them, you needed to burn, like them. Your Angel tells you that Heaven isn't concerned with who people love and somehow that makes it better. You don't care for heaven, but you care for him, so as long as he believes what he told you, you allow yourself some doubt.
That night when they got back to the bunker, tired and full of relief, Eileen had been waiting for them. She practically threw herself at Sam and that was the last Dean had seen of the two for the night. Sam deserved it, he figured.
The upside was that she had forgiven Jack almost instantly after hearing how Lucifer had influenced him and how he had saved the world in the end. Not to mention that it was him who brought her back on top of that.
"She would never-"
For a brief moment, all animosity died down as they each took a sip of their beer. Dean watched his Dad closely, and sure enough, John put down the bottle and frowned.
You remember that case again, how their bones burned, and a part of you with them. You were 17 and it was the only time you questioned one of your father's rules. You never figured out how he knew, but you were filled with dread and shame just the same. It's the same feeling that comes over you now, every time you long to ask this strange Angel to stay but you are far from admitting that to yourself.
Before you know it he is more constant than absent, no longer a mystery. You think you know him, even if not as well as he knows you, which never fails to send a shiver through you. You long for him to stay and it shocks you that you're even capable of feeling that way. You can't tell him to stay so you try to show him but it always goes wrong. You know what your father would say, you can see the disappointment in his eyes just as clear as the worry in your brothers'.
Dying would be an easy out, and your life was never easy. A while ago you decided that you wanted to live, peace be damned, and your Angel deserves to live more than anyone. If he stays dead then you lost after all, and failure isn't an option.
"Easier for you," Cas said with emphasis on the 'you'. "I am lying to a colleague, and friend, for no good reason." He regarded Dean calculatingly, arms crossed and deep in thought.
For just a second he felt better even as he was already pushing Sam away. Chick flick moments never had helped anyone. Now Sam was wiping at his eyes too and that certainly didn't make things easier on Dean. What a mess they were.
"Anyways, you wouldn't happen to have something to drink for me?"
"Deal." Cas agreed with a small smile.
The first brief glimpse of true victory they got came in the form of Eileen who was waiting for them in the kitchen. Dean only greeted her briefly before allowing her and Sam some space for their teary-eyed rom-com worthy reunion. Any other time he'd have cracked a joke about it but right then he was just glad to see Sam finally happy.
Deep down Dean had always thought that Cas didn't wear the trench coat for anything except their campaigns as kind of a subtle cosplay which would match his usual level of weird. Turns out he was wrong but the jury was still out on whether that was more or less weird. Either way, seeing Cas instantly lifted his mood, probably cause he associated the guy with game night on a subconscious level. Yeah, that had to be it.
You win the fight, you had to, there was never another option, the memories are what carries you through it. Before you know better you are by the side of a foreign road and dread settles over you as the adrenalin wears off. It's over, you no longer have a cause, you have nothing to fight for, you won the ultimate fight and you're free and more miserable than you've been since hell. You're so broken that it's almost enough to convince you he will show up.
Sam completely ignored their little exchange, he just grabbed his beer and continued talking, "I'll never understand religious fanatism. These people are seriously arguing that research should be stopped because they don't like what it is coming up with." He grimaced to underline how unbelievable that line of thought was.
"Can't die there," he continued unfazed, "I figured there was only one thing that could have happened. With how hell-bent you were on the two of you leaving together last time we were all stranded there, I wasn't even surprised." There was something like fond exasperation in his smirk when he added, "if anybody could make that happen it would be you. I just hope it didn't cost you too much brother."
Chapter 1
"Why does this feel like a goodbye?"
"Hello," after a moment of hesitation he added, "Dad." John stared blankly back at him as if his words hadn't registered. Examining his youngest son more closely, recognition finally flashed in his eyes.
"Right, none of my business, I'm just sorry I made you sit through the entire evening, except that you clearly still get along so maybe you should talk." Their dumbfounded expressions lead him to add, "I'll go get more drinks." And just like that, Sam was gone.
"What is this shit? Don't you boys drink real beer anymore?"
It struck him that he didn't even know whether John had a gun on him or not, for all he knew his father would shoot the second he saw him. Stopping dead in his tracks he turned back to Eileen.
'We need a game plan,' Dean thought before promptly stopping himself. They had to be careful too. This wasn't actually a game, he could really screw things up if he wasn't careful, he reminded himself. But putting their current situation in perspective he couldn't help but snort.
A portal had opened out of thin air, like a regular door in the middle of the room, it spat out John Winchester looking the way he had the day he died and closed again behind him. As if it meant to say 'I've had enough, you deal with him now,' which if you had met John Winchester wasn't even an unlikely version of the events leading up to this. At least it was exactly what Sam felt had happened.
If Chuck found one last way to get one over on them they were screwed. Left with no plan, back to square one, but with no resources and no support left. Dean feared they might have reached their breaking point. Worst of all, Cas's sacrifice would have been for nothing. Old anger began to flare up in him, combating his hopelessness.
Sam gave up, "Technically he is only, like, three," he conceded. The withering look that earned him from Bobby could have easily restarted the Apocalypse.
"I'm sorry what?" Winding himself out of his mother's grasp his emotions quickly subsided under a well-worn blanket of denial. Hiding was the only reaction to this that he knew, so that's what he did.
With a deep breath, Cas tilted his head away and after a beat of silence, he said, "Fine. But you'll owe me."
Your head is ringing with how wrong you were as you lean against that wall, sobbing. You're inconsolable and pathetic and you know it. You long for death almost as much as you long for him to come back or even just a chance to make it right, but you don't die. You have to pick yourself up in the end, you have to tell a child his father died, and you have to seek revenge. But you are not your father, this is your revenge, not the kids.
"Only that ever since the reverse thing people who were dead way before the apocalypse have started to come back too. From what we're able to tell it's only people who died within the last 25 years or so who were close to Dean and I. We checked, none of the other resurrected that don't know us died sooner than the day of the Apocalypse. I swear. It's mostly hunters too. The only guess we have right now is that we're supposed to build an army of some sort and-"
Deans' brain took a while to reroute and supply him with a logical answer for what he was seeing. His giant of a brother was rushing towards him with an apologetic grin in place and one step behind him followed no other than Cas. Cas, who he played DnD with once a week, whom he had never seen outside a DnD or Larp setting in the five years they had known each other (which felt kind of ridiculous now that he thought about it).
Looking up at him with wide eyes from where he was seated behind a mount of books, Sam waited for an explanation, his own irritation having seemingly subsided at his brother's outburst. Dean fought with himself over what to say until finally exhaustion won out and the anger in him was replaced with the same bone-deep sadness and sorrow he had been wearing like a blanket for the past few days.
Occasionally you find yourself praying and you have stopped wondering why. Sometimes you catch yourself thinking you're praying when really there is just a single name on your lips. You know why, but you pretend like you don't. So long as he wants to stay with you, you are happy to let him.
"You'll see her after you listened to our story. Maybe. If she wants to. Because you should know that she's with us. She met Castiel, she knows about Benny, she will accept your bullshit as little as we do." He knew she'd want to see him again as much as that stung, but it couldn't hurt to keep him in suspense.
Along the way you let more people in your heart than you ever thought possible and most of them pay the price. You hate yourself more with each death and the deaths keep coming.
_________________________________
"That's hardly the same,"  Sam said carefully as if he were still deliberating the meaning behind Dean's words. His gaze searching his face for anything that Dean wasn't willing to say out loud. He could practically hear the gears turning in his brother's head, the seconds ticking away until he understood. He had to fight the panic in him, this was Sam, not John. Sam won't care, he told himself.
Dean and Sam both tensed and Benny threw them an odd look. When he had first called a few days ago, they agreed to inform all the hunters in the house of who, or rather what, Benny was. The idea was to prevent misunderstandings and since most of them already knew Garth it hadn't been too hard to convince them that a vamp could change sides too. Or at least they trusted that messing with anybody under the Winchester brother's protection was stupid if you wanted to live.
Meanwhile, John was screaming bloody murder over their heads in an attempt to get to Benny.
"Sure you are," came the prompt if sarcastic reply. "If you ever get over yourself you know where to find me. Or Sam." Bobby offered him a way out of the conversation and Dean took it.
"Thanks for getting this, I really do appreciate it," he said hungrily. Then he turned to John with an uncaring grin, "I don't drink beer."
He was vaguely aware of Sam who had choked on nothing at Marys' words and was now violently coughing. Dean's face burned with shame. As if this wasn't bad enough already, of course, Sam had to hear it too.
"You have no right to speak to Dean like that. You almost ruined him when you last were around but he is stronger than that." Every word was laced with conviction and the trust in his voice ended the weird out of body experience Dean was caught in. He snapped back into reality.
"What the hell?" Mumbled Sam while Dean fruitlessly attempted to wake Jack up again. It was no use, his breathing had steadied but there was no reaction to be pried from him.
He is family now, inexplicably tied to you, probably from the moment he pulled you out of hell. Only that now you can see it, how real he is, how good, and how he matters so much more than the image of a dead man. You can't tell him though, you've learned if you name a good thing it'll leave you.
One of the earliest, most deeply anchored rules within you, 'if you are like that, feel like that, you should burn'. And you can't even uphold that. So you bury it within you like you always do.
Ten seconds, Dean thought. He knew his brother knew it too.
Taking another swig of beer he was starting to hope Sam hadn't forgotten about him or his day might end even sadder than it started. He had to get himself together, he decided, moping in silence wasn't going to do him any good, he just had to make it until next Friday when the next campaign was scheduled, that had to get his spirits up.
"Sam used to play too, but I stopped mentioning DnD and, god forbid; Larp, after he stopped cause he kept going on about how I shouldn't go overboard with the escapism. Just going along with this would probably be easier." Wishing he knew how to apply his brother's puppy eyes, he watched Cas for a reaction. He was so glad that he was buzzed, at least that presented him with an out for any stupid ideas he might regret in the morning.
After a while, he intervened, "are you not going to try and stop me?" Because if this was going to come up again he'd prefer now over later.
Years pass and you know you're living in a dead man's image, always seeking revenge or making amends or fixing unfixable mistakes, always living in the past. But in the end, there is always your brother, the car, a gun, and some monster to kill. So you endure it. As long as you're suppressing all your emotions it's not even half bad. He would have wanted this for you and maybe you don't deserve better. After all, his diary is very insistent on your failures, almost as insistent as he was.
Next came holy water and Clorox and if John was surprised about the latter one he didn't show it.
He wanted to feel satisfied, or angry or sad or anything but instead, numbness had overtaken him. Remaining impassive he stood as a silent witness as Sam kept on beating their father and the sounds of violence filled the room. Each punch came with a statement but he didn't register those either.
Especially those moments when you're hardly in the picture, listening to your brother and your Angel while they think you're asleep on a particularly long drive. Your two favorite people in existence get along just fine under normal circumstances and there is nothing that can quite match that happiness.
John did give in eventually, even though he played it off well. "Apocalypse, huh?" He asked. "And somehow you still found the time to catch yourself a girlfriend," he scoffed.
"You know, when I was alive the first time around, I never found the right time to tell you that your father could be a real ass sometimes," he began the conversation.
Bobby didn't seem at all satisfied with his own reaction and yet that answer meant a whole lot to Dean. "Just try not to get yourself killed son," he added bitterly. Dean nodded.
Before you know it you're 42, and you are happier than you've ever been and you think about your father's diary and all the things you weren't supposed to have but you can finally no longer hear his voice.
So this is the life. One day you're reading your father's journal for the first time. You are 24 years old and he is gone. There is a passage where he talks about how he had already been happily married when he was your age, how he knew you would never be because his mission comes before your life.
"If this was an in any way reasonable mission your brother would be here."
"We didn't expect you back or he would be here."
In a way, it felt overdue for them to sit down and rewind everything that had happened in their crazy lifes but for that to be prompted by their long-dead father of all people was just uncalled for. Not to mention that he had caused a fair share of their problems too.
He recognized the old, slightly annoyed voice in an instant. But that was impossible. He swallowed his surprise, "Bobby?" He answered, well aware of the shock in his own voice. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sam's eyes go wide.
I hope you enjoyed reading! Please please please leave a comment if you did!
"Are you going to stare at me all day or what?" John barked at them. The man really found the nerve to try and give orders as if he weren't bound to a chair, in the cellar of a secret organization's bunker, currently inhabited exclusively by people who had died before.
"If there is anything true about what that vamp said, you are no better than the things we hunt. You're worse because it would have been so easy for you not to get corrupted. It was Sam, wasn't it? You always were too soft with him, even when you found out what kind of a freak he was. You should have killed him, Dean. If you had just listened to my order none of this would have happened and I wouldn't be here, hearing rumors about my son bending over for a -"
Feeling his heart sink in his chest, Sam was forced to remember how his father had died. What his last will had been. Of course, he'd find a way to blame Sam for everything that had gone wrong since his death. Hesitantly he met the eyes of the man who wanted him dead. He hadn't been there back then when John had asked Dean to kill him. He almost hoped to hear it now so he could be done with the guy once and for all.
People were supposed to be coming back and he was obviously happier than ever to hear Bobby. The only problem was that the coming back part wasn't supposed to apply to people who had died before Chuck pulled his ultimate move. Yet he was talking to Bobby. Who was supposed to have been in heaven for several years now. Dean took a deep breath, suspecting that it was going to be a long day.
The thing was, there was no way for Sam and Cas to know each other, Dean kept his real life and DnD carefully separate ever since Sam stopped playing regularly. The image of them next to each other didn't sit right with him. For a second he thought he was hallucinating and seeing Cas cause that's how badly he needed a round of DnD, then he thought it was a glitch in reality, until he remembered that reality generally didn't glitch. He blinked and looked over again, but nope, Cas was still there. With Sam.
He had to say something, but how do you summarize half a life of living, fighting, and dying for and with each other in a sentence? And that was only what he'd have to explain ignoring his real feelings. "Castiel is an Angel. And a friend," he ended up saying. All other words got stuck in his throat as it finally clicked into place that the way John looked at them was the way he looked at monsters he was hunting.
Sam was still talking to him but Dean was content to ignore him as he had done for most of the time they spent researching. Roughly every hour Sam would attempt to start a conversation. Probe at him to talk about how he was feeling in thinly veiled questions.
Your Angel is leaning against your chest and you wonder how the purest happiness can be hidden so plainly in normalcy and all you need is the freedom to take it. You are happier than your father ever would have been had he lived. Your life and his life looked drastically different at 24, but you're here now where he was then in a way, but he isn't here and it's finally okay to just be.
"Okay, first of all not my angel," Dean corrected. Jody behind him scoffed and Sam raised an eyebrow at him but neither said anything.
One step ahead of Sam, Dean flung the door open and let it crash against the wall behind him. He tore open the drawer with his collection of abandoned phones. Nobody alive had the number to any of these as far as he knew but that didn't mean anything in his life he supposed. He picked it up. "Hello?"
He hung up but before he could even turn to Sam, his regular phone began ringing, Sam's phone followed a second later.
"God." Sam corrected unhappily. Explanations derailed several times after that. When they were finally all on the same page, everyone at the table was suffering from a headache to some degree and Bobby hadn't stopped cursing for a solid fifteen minutes.
At least now you have an excuse, a reason to be broken. Not that that fixes anything, the world is doomed because of you and you can't help but think that you should have known you'd be the cause of it. Nothing good comes of what you do, you the soldier who needs orders as much as he despises them.
Eyebrows knit together in confusion, John glared back, "What kind of hunter doesn't drink beer?" The mockery in his voice died when Jody sat down the glass in front of Benny.
"Don't lie to me, Sam"
First, he cut himself with the silver knife, then he reached for his father's arm and cut him too. Only a little deeper than necessary. John glared at him but he didn't flinch. Thinking of the years' worth of issues he had left them with, first and foremost the brainwashing he had put Dean through, Sam couldn't bring himself to feel sorry.
The instant he was gone Mary turned to Sam for an explanation who shut the book he was reading with a loud thump in order to face her. "Mom, it's complicated," he said and pushed his hair back, internally cringing at his word choice.
Catching him with ease Dean hurriedly pushed him back onto the couch.
You can't help but wonder when your life became so complicated, and how it failed to feel complicated just so long as your Angel was there.
About fifteen minutes and a lot of colorful language from John's side later, the four of them had managed to drag him into the dungeon. They weren't happy about it but they agreed that they would have to force him to listen. It went unspoken that it would be best if they got him caught up and acting like a semi-reasonable human before Mom and Bobby got back from their mission.
A lightbulb went on over Dean's head. "You know each other through work?" He asked, just to make sure, and took a tentative sip of his third beer.
Only that, ironically, the thing that made you find faith again, maybe for the first time, was the Angel who lost his. He tells you he is beginning to doubt and in the most wonderful contradiction, that is what makes you believe in miracles for the first time in your life. The joy doesn't last because now he is looking to you for direction even though all your choices keep leading to misery.
Laughing heartily Bobby clapped Sam on the shoulder, "you know Kevin has a point. Your brother and Cas were always their own category." He continued to laugh with a slight knowing twinkle in his eyes that Dean chose to ignore.
Mary frowned at him, "So Dean never talked? Not even to you?" Sam shook his head and she looked utterly defeated. "I was dead sure they were already together, how could I misread the situation that badly?" She asked, sounding miserable. "I probably sent him in a full-on panic."
Knowing Bobby was right didn't make it any easier to talk about. Still, the silent support was highly appreciated even if it felt weird that Bobby should have guessed something so personal. Ignoring the whole ordeal as he always did seemed to be his best solution for the time being.
You think to yourself, 'so this is the life' and one day, you're reading your father's journal for the last time. You are 42 years old and he is finally truly gone, no traces of him linger in your mind. Now you know, a soldier without order will always remain a soldier, but he will also be free.
Sitting up straighter, he instantly went for damage control, "Fine, fine, I'm in, but we stick with the story that the break-up was nobody's fault. Right person wrong time or something like that. Okay?" The bastard knew that Sam liked him and wasn't afraid to use it. Clever but kind of unnerving, just like in DnD. "What are we going to tell Sam though?" he added as an afterthought. If they broke up it didn't exactly make sense to show up at a party together and tell people they were dating.
"I can see that it's complicated',"  mimicked Mary. "But why? It's so obvious!" She added.
"Yeah, but I didn't say it," he replied swiftly and grinned.
_________________________________
For a second upon hearing what had happened Dean had allowed himself to be happy. His father was back. He had to be proud of him now. His mother was back too, they could be a family again. Even with all the people who had come back already he had never considered this option.
"We've met." Cas agreed and when it became clear that he wasn't going to elaborate and the silence stretched on, Sam coughed awkwardly. Dean distractedly noted that he had been holding eye contact with Cas since they sat down across from each other. He looked away.
Almost one week passed at the bunker in which old friends reached out to them at all odd hours of the day. They had long since moved Jack to his old room but he appeared to be in some sort of magical coma that nothing could rouse.
"Balls," Bobby said with deep conviction and downed the rest of his drink. "If it's going to be one of those days I need something stronger than that," he added with a glance at the empty bottle in front of him.
Benny caught on nonetheless. "No Angels in Purgatory since I last returned there," he offered half a shrug, and Dean understood. There weren't exactly any football games to watch in Purgatory, of course, he would have wondered where the hell Cas had gone to.
"Sound familiar?" Dean joked, before he added, "It's called a bar you dork. But yeah that's basically it."
To his surprise, Cas appeared to be sincere. His calm demeanor at least matched up to that but the idea was so insane, and kind of unnecessary, that Dean didn't want to get his hopes up.
"I remember how you two acted in purgatory. I'm not blind Dean. I figured you'd have gotten together by now. Or back together, or whatever you guy's deal was." He spoke casually, but Dean knew him well enough to detect the genuine interest in his voice.
After taking a minute to steel himself he cautiously made his way to the library. His thoughts drifted to Sam, who was alone with their father. Their father, who was alive again. Whose last will it had been that he should kill Sam.
The word 'friend' etched itself into his conscience like acid, that's how blatant that underestimation was. The pain must have been evident in his voice because his father's expression turned impossibly colder. Sam put a steadying hand on his shoulder, normally Dean would flinch away but this time he allowed himself to appreciate it.
"Come with me to the fundraiser," his voice was pleading but his posture seemed more like he was stating his terms, "and pretend to be my date when someone asks."
"I don't know Mom, sorry. I probably shouldn't even say as much, really only Dean and Cas can know. But it's true that up until now they never were anything but friends."
"What would you do if Eileen hadn't come back?" His voice sounded hoarse even to his own ears and he tore his gaze away from Sam, unable to hold eye contact. Sam quietly got up and walked over to face him, forcing him to look up again.
You kiss him and it's the truest thing you've ever done. You're alive and praying like never before that he wants it to. A second later he kisses you back and you have no intention of ever letting him go. All the grief and pain fall off of you and all that matters are his lips against yours. Finally, finally, finally.
But your brother doesn't need you to be a soldier, so slowly you start to be yourself again instead, after almost forgetting what that even means. Apparently, it means burdens and pain and a never-ending job but it also means open roads, good music you can play as loudly as you like, and easy quips between you and your brother. You can taste freedom but it's never quite yours. You stay busy, ensuring strangers have what can never be yours and it's your type of normal.
Then John attacked him. It happened so suddenly that had it not been for years of training he would have been on the ground in a second.
Before you know it, your mission mingles with the taste of freedom that shouldn't be yours. Somehow it's easier to take orders from an Angel than from your father. It's less personal at first, and then so much, much, more personal.
Eileen next to him threw him a questioning glance and his mood fell even further. He really could have lived without Eileen knowing what an ass his dead beat father was. And he could only imagine how Dean would react when he saw that John was back but Castiel still wasn't. He just hoped Dean wouldn't revert to his old self that lived to be his father's soldier. His brother had come so far that Sam couldn't help but think that would be the ultimate punishment.
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" He barked out. "Where is your brother?" Barely back among the living and the command in his voice was already back in place.
"-Also his research is actually fascinating. And the fundraiser requires a lot of nerves, so I figured we might as well get a drink together. We've been working on this for weeks, tried to settle the case outside of court first, ya know?" Sam shook his head, "I just wished the rest of your family wasn't so involved in all of this, that's just bound to blow up."
With a chuckle, he answered, "just, all of this man, think about it for a second."
Never before did you feel the urge to pray, you had no reason to believe in a world that had given you nothing and demanded everything. Your father didn't believe either but then again, you are starting to think that he wasn't right about everything, that there were things he didn't know. Now praying comes to you more naturally than it should after a lifetime of doubt but there is only one Angel you pray to.
He felt a little steadier now that he knew that Cas wouldn't sell him out, maybe the evening wasn't bound to go wrong after all. It could hardly get any weirder than this anyways, he told himself. Sam, however, seemed to be entirely out of his depth in Dean's stead.
The bar provided a perfect backdrop for his sullen brooding and since Sam was late he conveniently had time to indulge. It was busy for a Tuesday night, and Dean was already nursing his second beer, that's how late Sam was.
"Before we continue this merry little storytime, you two knuckleheads need to swear to me that you didn't intentionally raise anybody from the grave. Again." He pointed one finger at Dean, his tone much sharper than before, "Me included, this wasn't you, right?" He didn't have to threaten them outright for them to get the idea.
With all the newly arising family problems he had almost forgotten that they weren't alone in the bunker and had to play off how startled he was to find Jody in the kitchen.
The relieved chuckle that got him from Cas somehow made this entire bizarre evening feel so much more real. There was a certain lightheadedness in that freedom and he didn't quite know how to deal with it.
Cas hid a smile behind a dramatic frown, "Gabriel can be brutal," he insisted and took a long sip of his drink.
Kevin broke whatever weird almost- father- son- moment they had going on with a quiet huff. "I haven't met Eileen yet but if she means as much to Sam as Castiel does to Dean, she must be one hell of a girl," he concluded with a slight tilt to his head.
That finally broke his resolve. "Fine," he sighed, "Have it your way then. You've come too far for you to kill yourself now, so if it comes to that I will stop you. But until then trying doesn't hurt I guess." He uncrossed his arms in exasperation. "Reckless idiot," he added under his breath.
And yeah, there was Cas, unnerving blue eyes and trench coat as always. Looking as unreal as if he had stepped right out of one of their campaigns.
Dean knew the last comment was for his benefit and he could breathe a little easier. It felt weird not to have stepped in, to see his brother's hands bleed when he himself was fine. He'd never done that before.
"It'll be like DnD in real life," Cas went on, clearly also not below going for dirty tactics to convince him.
"I know you never officially told me about your relationship. I know you probably didn't have it easy since hunters tend to be a little old fashioned but I love you Dean and I was happy to accept him in this family on your behalf and I'm sorry that I didn't say something sooner but I didn't want to pressure you. I could tell how much you two loved each other right away." She kept on talking but after that Dean could only hear the blood rushing in his ears. He froze.
His brother took a deep breath, "look, Bobby, we know you just want us to do what's right. The thing is, there are things we simply cannot accept, and when we are faced with something like that we change it. It's what we've always done. It's why we are still alive. I'm with Dean on this because I know if it was Eileen who was still gone he'd help me too. After everything, I think we are entitled to a real victory, and this isn't one until Cas is back too."
Her eyes went wide for a split second but always one with the right priorities she didn't ask any questions and promptly took off with a hasty nod. She didn't need to know that Sam had also hoped to get her away from a potential threat by sending her off.
When they all just looked at him he shrugged and continued, "Heaven knows the Winchesters have a hard time staying dead and he's basically one of you."
Sam was being serious and he knew they could tell. He didn't joke when it came to his brother's well-being. He felt their eyes on him as he began pacing the room. "We have to get Castiel back. That's the only thing that will help him. Otherwise, I don't know how much longer he can cope until he does something seriously stupid."
It didn't help that Bobby had driven out to collect a few people and check on some old hunter meeting points. He was one of the few people who were well respected by the older generation of hunters and it would have been helpful to have him around. At least he was set to return by the end of the week.
"Can we circle back to the bit where these two idiots lost their minds once and for all and decided to fight God?" His voice grew louder with every word. Sam and Dean stuttered their explanations hastily like two children being chastised by their father rather than two grown men who repeatedly stopped the world from ending.
He is an Angel and you are the broken shell of a human but your pieces have begun to mend thanks to him. At your most destroyed, you found faith and the will to go on, thanks to him. He saved you when he pulled you out of hell, but he also saved you when he gave you a reason to keep going and an inclination
Stubbornly Sam added, "He's family." That was when John lost it and in retrospect, Dean should have seen it coming. Still, he was glad that Sam was the one to make that call and confirm that Cas was family. Not only because it was true and John needed to hear it. Or because Dean was already on thin ice in terms of showing affection. But because the confirmation that Sam wanted him back too, that he wasn't acting entirely selfish and irrational, was a welcome remedy to all of his guilt.
There is an Angel by your side as you watch tv and he is so much more real than the pages of some old diary. The world didn't want to make space for you, so you cut your place into it by force and it was well and truly worth the struggle.
Entertaining the idea that it could have been different filled him with dread. Even as he was aware of the happiness he had denied himself, he couldn't shake the feeling that it was better for Cas not to have known. Because love be damned, they couldn't be together like that. It wasn't right. He wasn't right. Castiel deserved better, how he could want Dean even for a second was beyond him.
You are still broken but now there is an Angel with you. An Angel who is losing his faith in his father, God, in a way that is jarringly familiar for you. There is something about that kind of betrayal and terror that only fathers can inspire. The guilt that it filled you with, the emptiness that replaced it.
Bobby sighed, "I'm trying to tell you that just because he wouldn't approve of something that doesn't mean it's wrong. He had a tendency to see the world in black and white, dangerously so. But you are not him and thank god for that." He grimaced, "or thank the universe. Or whoever isn't against you yet." He shook his head thoughtfully,
The first person they passed up close and didn't just see in the distance caused Dean to punch Babys' steering wheel so hard that a long honk erupted out of the car's horn and the poor guy almost fell off his bike. Sam laughed heartily and they allowed themselves to feel free for a second. Granted, the people were fewer than they had expected but they had no way of knowing how long it would take Jack to bring them all back. What mattered was that they'd done it. Who cares if it would take a few days for things to go back to normal.
Choosing to ignore them, he cast a wary glance at his father. Still, he couldn't help but force a reply for the simple reason that with how long Benny had been dead he shouldn't even know that Cas was out of Purgatory. "How do you even know...?" He trailed off as he caught himself and considered how much of this John should hear.
Late in the evening, a firm knock on the front gate distracted them from their preparations for the inevitable giant hunter-gathering. But it wasn't Bobby on the other side like they had expected, or at least not Bobby alone. At an arms-length, he pushed a supremely out of it looking young prophet before him.
Dean considers it for a moment, but really Cas got him with 'real-life DnD' as his argument and he could already feel the buzz of a good game spread through him. "Deal?" He asked
They would all check on their neighborhoods and a few places on the way and assemble at the bunker over the following weeks. It was starting to nag on Sam's mind that he didn't know what they'd tell all of the other hunters, all they had were more questions.
After quickly informing them that he seemed to be fine and confirming that he had no clue how he was alive again, Bobby agreed to meet them at the Bunker as soon as he could get there. Offering to come to pick him up only earned Dean a string of insults that got the first real smile out of him since their victory, though it faltered quickly as he remembered the still unconscious kid in the living room.
In every reunion there is hope and your bond grows stronger, it's no longer this invisible thing that you can hide. Because after all, your Angel fell for you. He brought down heaven, for you. Everyone who knows you knows him too, knows you can't be separated, and they talk. You hear the whispers but you've stopped caring. Your father will never be the wiser as long as you just don't give in.
With a genuine smile, Sam echoed the greeting and after a second hesitation also hugged Kevin much to the latters' surprise. He heard Dean chuckle, "easy there. The guy is probably still traumatized from hell, no need to traumatize him even more Sammy."
"For fucks sake," he cursed so loudly Sam half expected Jack to wake up. "Does Dean not trust me anymore or does he really think I'm that stupid?" Now it was Sam and Mary's turn to look as startled and confused as Bobby had for the last few days as he caught up on the last few world endings.
The ghosts of those two nuns would never find peace, in life, their only crime had been existing. Yet your father made it clear that that's what it was, a crime. They seemed innocent to you but you weren't supposed to think. You knew what it meant then and you know it now. You don't get why that case keeps popping in your head whenever you look at him though.
"No, it wasn't," Dean interrupted before he knew what he was doing. Taking another deep breath he finally felt the adrenalin kick in. Sam didn't care. He never even had to tell him. This wasn't so bad. With a racing heart full of hope and strange exhilaration, he offered Cas a small smile. "At least I no longer have to worry about telling him," he shrugged.
"I didn't."
The truth was it was getting harder to carry on with each passing day but he wasn't about to admit that. He had long since come to the conclusion that Cas loved him as a friend and nothing more. So he'd be a good friend and get him back so things could go back to normal. He wouldn't bother Cas with his feelings, he couldn't do that to either of them. "We'll bring him back," he promised haughtily and promptly stalked out of the room.
It was then that it occurred to Dean how confusing the following days were bound to be. It would be hard enough to remember what Bobby knew and what they had only talked about with his Apocalypse-world twin.
Dean interrupted, "we think you are back for a reason. We can't be sure what we'll be dealing with but Chuck was pissed so we should expect something big. Jack resurrected you so we have a chance against whatever Chuck let loose before be died," he explained with a frown. "At least that's our theory. Kid passed out before he could explain properly."
Waiting for him to add anything else that would make this situation a little more reasonable, Bobby frowned, clearly deep in thought. Or shock. It was kind of hard to tell at this point and Sam had to admit the whole thing didn't sound too promising, especially the bit where he and Dean might end up raising God. A shudder ran down his spine as the silence stretched on. Mary patted him on the shoulder reassuringly but before she could say anything Bobby spoke up.
"So in summary, we are expecting a whole lot of dead people and a child god is sleeping on your sofa next door," Bobby concluded, "why ever I thought living again would be a good thing." Kevin next to him nodded solemnly.
Dean rolled his eyes at him, Cas bought snacks for their entire party regularly and Dean was sure as hell not going to make him pay for a single drink. Not after mistakenly offering him beer for almost a year when they first met until Cas finally admitted that he didn't even like beer. They were currently fighting an absolute bastard of a demon together that Crowley had come up with and Dean could damn well pay for the drink. Why he got so worked up about it was something he didn't want to examine though, so he simply shook his head 'no'.
"Oh I'm so sorry Dean," she whispered and pulled him into her arms. "I know you and I hardly had the chance to form a normal mother- son relationship but if you need me I'll be there for you," she promised and went on to smother him with motherly affection.
The brothers exchanged a look and followed him swiftly. Sam hoped his brother saw the 'thank you,' he signed his way.
At least he is still there, and you are content. After years of pain, content feels dangerously close to bliss. It's more than you should have but you can't let go. More often than not, you know that he doesn't really want you and it makes it easier to bear, it hurts less than thinking you might have a chance. You get comfortable with what you can't have.
There is still a job to be done and it's grating on you, you know that you can never be free and the anger helps you fight. Worse than that, life is cruel to your Angel and he is still your reason to keep fighting but sometimes he is also your reason to stop when your anger is getting the best of you.
Yet somehow you're alive when you shouldn't be. You got another chance to see your brother, your car, your gun, live your life right this time. Do better. Be better. It's still a shitty life but it's yours and you're still a soldier only now you have a calling again. An Angel has put his trust in you and you know you don't deserve it but you want it anyways.
"If you ask me," replied Sam, "it means that our work isn't done yet. Clearly Jack needs our help," he decided with a shrug and a helpless glance in the sleeping boy's direction.
So you're 28 and you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. You went to hell and came back, literally. You're more broken than ever before and somehow just the same. Because again all you can think is that you failed your duties as a soldier and the guilt is your constant companion but you know how to hide it. Technically you're older than 28 but that hardly matters, you never lived a life right for your age anyways.
Taking a moment to reconsider he realized that he probably wouldn't have spoken to his father like that twenty years ago. He didn't care. Ever since Cas was gone he found it hard to care about anything at all other than getting him back and this was costing him time he'd rather use to research.
Work had been a real pain and the whole working all week and living for the weekend thing was getting to him lately. Maybe it was just a typical late-twenties thing to wonder where he was going with his life, to want something more than secret DnD rounds to live for. He was 28 and his career was going nowhere, he was deeply closeted, single, and the most constant thing in his life was bloody Dungeons and Dragons, which he couldn't even admit to. Most days, Dean was fine with all of that, save maybe the being closeted bit, but today wasn't most days.
Sam was frozen in place, trying to catch up with the information that had just been dumped on him. His jaw tensed for a second in a strange misplaced second of anger, then he pulled Dean into a hug. "I'm so sorry. We'll find him, okay, I promise Dean. I'll do anything," he swore and Dean understood that if anything his brother was mad that he hadn't understood sooner, that they still couldn't both be happy, but not at Dean.
"Witness? Calm down dude, your lawyer is showing, you're not that late anyway," he replied smoothly, all the while thinking anything other than calmly; 'they are on nickname basis???? How the hell did that happen?' The entire situation was beyond him already. "Hey, Cas," he greeted and hoped his silent questions on 'how? Why? When?' would be answered.
The casual question might as well have been a punch in the face for Dean. It was still too painful to think about. Having intentionally glossed over how they lost Cas he cursed himself for thinking he'd get away with it and for wanting to get away with it alike. Cas deserved better.
The adventure always starts in a tavern
Within seconds of turning his back on them, he felt better. Then he realized that he now had no idea what they might be talking about and regret crept up in him just as quickly. He ordered and paid for two beers and a vodka soda in record time and was back at their table in less than five minutes. He was met with startled expressions and muttered something about the bar being pretty empty at the moment.
"Dean, what happened between you two? Why won't you tell me? We both know he wouldn't want you to suffer after he sacrificed himself for you," Sam reasoned and gripped Dean's shoulder as if he were trying to shake him awake.
"I wasn't talking to you, Sam. Dean, speak for yourself." Something about his demeanor had changed between hearing that Cas was an Angel and the mention of Benny. The calculation in his attitude was familiar to Dean and yet it felt off.
Something told him that this time his father had not actually meant to irritate him, but the comment still stuck. The confusion must have shown on his face, or maybe on Sam's since he had always had the worse pokerface. Either way, John studied them carefully before he elaborated.
Oh god, they were going to have to tell people they were dating. People he had never met before would know he was queer before they knew anything else about him. The feeling that he might have gotten the short end of the stick with their deal was beginning to fester in the back of his mind but he'd stick to his word. Maybe Cas would call this all off tomorrow when they were sober again. Surely he would.
"You knew his drink order?" He looked at Dean, slightly dumbfounded. "Seriously, how do you know each other?"
They pulled the two chairs by and took a seat across from John, the same way they would if they were fake FBI questioning a suspect. Sam flexed his hand and wiped the blood off on his jeans.
A small voice in his head began to question whether it would be so wrong for them to know. But as somebody who dealt with demonic possession on the regular, Dean wasn't a fan of voices in his head.
"What does Cas have to do with any of this? I'm fine," he declared as if they didn't both know that that was a blatant lie.
Taking a deep breath, Sam took over, "well technically it wasn't us. It was Jack. And just this once there might not be any repercussions for bringing people back from the dead. The downside is we don't know how many people will be back or when to expect them."
Trying to shake the embarrassment he tried to come up with something else to say but when he heard Sam snicker he suddenly couldn't find it in himself to be annoyed. Whatever, as long as no one was going to stop him he could deal with the jokes. He hardly could argue their point after just having declared that he was going to bring Cas back from the dead no matter the cost. Which was what all of this panned down to in the end, he realized.
In the end, what did it matter? He'd hope for whatever would get him their help and if he didn't get their help he'd go on alone. There was no other way.
Logically thinking Sam was right, but Dean didn't have the patience for logic right now. If he stopped working, he had to start thinking. Thinking about Cas and all the things he never got to tell him and he just couldn't bear it. His choice was between mind-numbing work and confronting his feelings which wasn't much of a choice at all.
Even worse, it meant the resurrections might be coming to an end. The first flood of hunters had been a random mix including Bobby and Kevin who had been dead for a while. It seemed like a random outburst of whatever magic was bringing them back before it knew how to control itself.
"Would you mind telling Dean and that our father is back? He will want to know," he whispered to her and squeezed her hand for reassurance. "I'll handle this," he promised, more to himself than to her.
With a bitter chuckle, Bobby answered, "well if you haven't learned your lesson by now, which apparently you haven't, then I don't think there is anything I can do to stop you. You know the risks better than anybody, it's up to your judgment," he explained carefully.
You tell yourself it's alright, at least you have a reason to see your little brother again, you have a car and a mission and what else do you need? Your father wasn't really there even when he was, but now he's gone and you're free. But your brother is miserable and you feel so guilty for your freedom. What is a soldier without someone's orders to follow?
Sam paused, chest heaving with heavy breaths. He got closer and leaned over the table. Grabbing John by the collar he forced him to meet his eye.
He knew Bobby meant well but Sam shook him off with a sad smile. "That'll make it worse. Let him cling to whatever hope he still has for as long as he can. Then we think of something else."
"I freaking know Sam, you don't need to tell me any of that," he shot back, entirely unaware of what he had just pretended to know about.
The sorrow on their faces only wavered and when Dean figured nobody else was going to say anything he cleared his throat trying to regain control over his emotions. "It's different with him. He's not in Heaven or Hell or even Purgatory. He's in the Empty. The Empty hates him and it hates us and Jack. I don't know if there is any coming back from that," he finished quietly.
He hadn't been about to bring it up for his brother's sake but there was no point in denying the truth. He cleared his throat, "Cas wasn't raising him alone. It was him and Dean mostly," he admitted reluctantly. "Dean won't give up on the kid, and I stepped up before when Cas wasn't around," he added with a little more confidence. "We'll manage."
Sometimes you wonder, he has rebuilt you entirely, how is it possible that he can stand you? He's seen the inside of your head and yet he is still here. That makes you feel better than it should. Your own father could hardly stand you and yet this Angel who knows you far better than he ever did has decided to stay, he has no obligation toward you, and yet he stays. It's intoxicating, dizzying, addicting. It's too much.
Eventually, he exchanged firm handshakes with Jody and John who had fixed him with his analytical hunter stare ever since he entered the room. Eventually, Benny gave in, dropped his duffel, and pulled by a chair on which he promptly collapsed. Rubbing one hand over his face he said, "you won't believe the shit I've seen on my way here."
Evading all eye contact he got up again, "I'll get us something to drink," he announced and made his hasty exit.
The day had started so good, with Eileen next to him and a bunker full of reunited friends and family. But nothing good in his life came without a price, a problem, some kind of hook. So here it was. Out of all the people they were still missing, it was John Winchester who had to return.
Jack had promised to try, Dean reminded himself. Until then, there was nothing he could do other than submerge himself in book after book, hoping for the slightest of clues as he was doing now. He sighed, there was a reason this was usually Sams part. The words swam before his eyes, his thoughts drifted off, frustration took over and he hardly could read two pages at a time. This was torture
John sat with his back to the fridge so he hadn't seen it yet. As Jody went to fill the contents of the first bag in a large glass John looked Benny up and down once more.
Dean retorted just as coldly, "You said it was the last way out. I didn't let it come to that. Never would have. And by the way? Telling me to kill my own brother was a dickmove."
Wonderfully unaware of the shock he had caused, Sam turned towards Cas, "It's not gonna change anything at work, I swear. And then toward Dean "and seriously Dean, I'm not going to get all up in your business demanding every single detail about your love life. I'm not mom. Even though Cas is an upgrade from all your previous dates and he needs a plus one for the fundraiser..." he trailed off carefully and grimaced when Dean kicked him under the table yet again the second he unfroze. The world slowly started turning again.
The question stopped his thought process, Dean could tell by how hesitantly he had asked that Benny must be thirsty, he seemed about to add something to the request when Jody stopped him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam sighed, "yeah, we just have to hope for the best."
"You're not a soldier and I mean that as a compliment, alright?"
Nodding his agreement Sam hastily added, "and tell Eileen it'll be a while till we come back up."  The 'I don't want her to worry' was clear in his voice even if he refused to say it.
The following morning, nothing woke them. They slept through the entire day and half of the night after that. In the early morning hours of the second day after, they met in the kitchen. Sam informed him that Eileen had left to check on some people and would be back in the evening.
"What on earth did all of that mean?" Dean complained while Sam just shook his head as old exhaustion and familiar panic came over both of them.
This time Charlie's startled voice sounded through to him and he caught Jody's name in Sam's conversation. The next half an hour went on like that with sporadic calls from people who had been dead just a day prior. They soon got used to the weirdness of it all and cheerfully directed one person after the next to the bunker. For a while, it was easy to pretend like everything would be alright.
"I can't imagine how hard this must be for you. You two should have had more time together," her voice was wearing thin and Deans' thoughts swam together. He agreed with her internally but he also couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about her word choice.
Looking torn, Sam shook his head. "I don't know Bobby," he said carefully and raised his hands in surrender. "Hear me out, I'm not saying we should jump headfirst toward any shady deal we find but it's Cas. We have to do something," he said helplessly. "Deans right, he should be here and we are way past caring about the dangers of resurrection. Done it too often for that," he reasoned.
You haven't made a decision he would have approved off in a long time, but he isn't here. You pretend you don't know that he wouldn't approve. He doesn't know what you have faced and would have recoiled in horror if he did. Somehow you miss the simplicity he had forced on you while resenting him for it all the same. You wish you could follow one last order without questioning it and at the same time you wish you had questioned all of his orders.
After getting over the first shock he quickly regained control and maneuvered his Dad in an unforgiving headlock. John cursed as he struggled on, "Why on earth would you bring me back?"
"You didn't seem surprised to see me, Sam. What is going on here?"
Dean never really answered with more than a word at a time and Sam was losing his patience. So was Dean. Sam wanted to celebrate their freedom, fine, but he had to leave Dean out of it for now. Their victory didn't even feel real to him, it hardly felt like victory at all without Cas back. The only sliver of hope he had was that Chuck was no longer controlling his fate, which maybe improved their chances a little.
of what faith could feel like.
Getting over her surprise within the second Jody huffed good-naturedly, "you Winchesters really can't stay dead," she extended her hand for John to shake. He took it. The two adults seized each other up for a moment and despite her kind attitude, Jody had obviously picked up on the ice in the atmosphere. The warmth in her smile didn't quite reach her eyes. They both let go quickly.
In the armchair next to him, Sam looked up from whatever ancient scripture he had busied himself with and gave Dean a calculating look. "You should take a break," he said matter of factly. Dean scoffed. There were no breaks for him, not until Cas was back with them where he belonged.
"Sure," Benny agreed and it seemed as if he were about to turn away when he paused. "By the way, where is your Angel?"
"We are well past that," Dean half-shouted. "That idea went out the window, I don't remember, when was that? When I came back for the third time? When we found out God is a dick and nothing really matters? When our mom came back after being dead for 30 years? How does any of it matter? Why should all of that be okay but I still lose Cas?" By the time he finished, he was as breathless as he was hopeless. "
"Yeah, it's me. I'd ask how the hell you're alive but I suppose we might know more about that than you do. Though I gotta warn you we don't know much either," he rushed out, "Are you okay? Where are you?"
He settled on answering the easier question first after getting a confirming nod from Mary. "Castiel was raising him," he said.
"-Cas saved our lifes. So did Benny" Punch to the nose, blood streaming down his face.
You're back on the road, with your brother and your car, and your gun, and even though you are free it's no longer enough. It will never be enough again.
Quietly taking another sip of his beer Kevin mustered them, eventually, he shrugged, "in their defense, Gods a dick."
"And you knew he'd survive the ordeal because he's Satans kid. Right," Bobby echoed. "How old is he again?"
Bobby still had pure disbelief in his eyes and kept glancing between Sam and Jack. "I know you said he defeated Chuck for you but he looks so young, are you sure that he can be considered a God?" He asked for what must be the dozens time.
'What the hell', he thought and downed the rest of his beer before getting up to meet them in one smooth motion.
"I just wish he would have told us what exactly he needs us to do," Dean grumbled but the worry in his eyes was barely concealed. "He was supposed to be God and right now he's not looking very godly if you ask me. Something must have gone wrong. Again." Dean tore his gaze away with a slight shake of his head. This couldn't be happening.
"You can let go of him Bobby, he's one of the good guys. Best prophet you'll ever know," Dean joked.
The defiant stare he offered his father would have scared anybody else who knew him into silence. But not him.
"Dean, seriously," Sam tried again, "we've been searching for hours. I want to get him back too but this," he gestured at the endless amount of papers in front of them, "won't do him any good if we're too tired to actually notice anything helpful."
So now they found themselves in the Dungeon, standing across from their father who was tied to a chair in the middle of a devil's trap. The same old metal table and set of chairs facing John that had seen nearly every interrogation in the bunker since the Winchesters moved in. Benny and Jody stood to the side, unsure of whether they should leave or not.
"I'll say this only once," he forced out. Mary's startled expression didn't deter him. "There was nothing between me and Castiel. He was my best friend. Nothing more," he swore intently as if he could convince himself.
"Angel?" John questioned helpfully, though his tone betrayed the usual amount of mockery and disapproval. Dean hardly registered his face turning bright red with all the other panicked thoughts crowding the forefront of his mind. So much about his pokerface.
"No. No, he's not," said Mary calmly and pressed her lips together as if she were unhappy with her admission.
"Mum is back to," he said with cold satisfaction as he saw sinister eyes widen with a spark of life they hadn't possessed in years. Sam behind him shifted uneasily and Dean couldn't blame him, he would have preferred to keep her out of this too but they had to bait him somehow.
Whatever Sam had seen caused him to add, "You know Dad, times have changed. I'll gladly repeat this little spiel if you have something else to say about gay people, just a heads up."
His patience was wearing thin as it mangled with the panic that was beginning to overtake his mind yet again. That was precisely why he tried not to think about Cas' absence, because it killed him when he did. But there was no reasonable way to explain that.
"I have to agree," Cas mused and he too visibly relaxed. "I don't think he'll be easily convinced of the truth at this point anyways. But it's still your brother we would be... deceiving."
Arms crossed over his chest, Sam decidedly placed himself right next to Dean as if he were trying to silently back him up.
"He's not with us anymore," Dean forced out, through hundreds of layers of pain and denial and grief he refused to acknowledge. Bobby patted him on the shoulder helplessly as Dean grasped his beer bottle like a lifeline.
Sam ignored the snide comment in favor of running a hand through his hair in exasperation. Every time he thought about the circumstances leading up to their situation he felt like admitting himself to a mental hospital and this instance was no different.
"You can't go around calling some random fucking creature 'family,' or making friends with fucking vamps-" His voice rose with every word and Dean felt his mind dwindling as he lost his grip on reality, encompassed by his fathers hate.
Bobby was the first to break the silence, "stop the long faces boys. You all know damn well he wouldn't want that." He shook Dean's shoulder a little and put on a firm face even though he clearly felt sorry for them too. "Besides, if everyone is suddenly coming alive again, it's just a matter of time, right?"
The kid is gone too but your brother is with you, somehow he isn't surprised about the grief you can no longer hide. No matter how bad things get, he understands you, but it's only a mild comfort. Your last responsibility is to keep it together for him but he hardly needs you anymore.
"It seems we know her better than you do," Sam said calmly.
Before he even knew what he was doing Dean was out of his seat and glowering down on his little brother with hardly controlled fury. "I will not stop looking," he said with a little too much force to his words.
"He is better than you," Sam practically spat, his voice now ringing clearly in Dean's head, more tangible than anything John had said. "And if you have another thing to say about him, or Castiel, I will kill you." He was about to punch him again but this time Dean held him back, tugging at Sam's arm, signaling it was enough. The anger in his eyes evaporated and he finally released their father. Taking a few tentative steps back, he examined the damage he had caused.
Sam offered Eileen a reassuring smile and signed that he'd explain later, though she had clearly seen his worried expression. He got up from their cozy spot surrounded by books and slowly approached his father, heart almost beating out of his chest.
"You know, maybe we should just let him believe what he wants to believe. This certainly sounds better than secret DnD," Dean joked, now that he could talk again.
You don't even hear the startled but obviously delighted chuckle from your brother several steps behind you, nor do you see the blinding smile on your son's face, but right there, in that moment, you know you've won.
"Because it is."
Glancing at your little brother, you know there is only one choice for you, letting him down had never been an option and you're not sure if you're thinking about your Angel or the brother who would otherwise lose you again. It doesn't matter, you have made your choice.
"That may be my fault," Cas started, obviously attempting to save Dean from his self-doubt.
"Sam?" His voice was so full of disbelieve, one could think Sam was the one who was back from the dead and not the other way around. The man looked so completely and utterly lost that he almost felt bad for him.
Sam turned his confused face away from him again slowly, Dean had obviously interrupted him mid-sentence. "-So, anyways, the fundraiser may be a bitch to live through but I really believe we have a good chance of winning this case if we can just get the actual funding for your work. It'll be one evening in unpleasant company and then we can finally get started on the real work."
"They're all back" Jack gasped, his eyes opening wide in panic. Sitting straight up as if he had been electrocuted, Jack blindly grabbed for Dean, fingers digging into his shoulder with iron strength.
Merely raising an eyebrow at them, Bobby crossed his arms over his chest and waited for further explanations. He had always been immune to Sam's puppy dog eyes which was so not fair. Anybody else would have given up by now.
He quickly changed the topic and silently vowed to confront his brother once again. Not that it had done much good in the past other than getting him punched but he had to keep trying, for Dean's sake.
Cas considered him with his trademark frown then he seemed to get it, "We're in a tavern, we just got a mission and hatched a plan." He said, and managed to sound equal parts bewildered and resigned.
"That doesn't mean we're endlessly patient," Dean cut him off, and if that bothered Sam he kept quiet about it. "We just dealt with the latest Apocalypse, excuse us for not being too eager to deal with whatever this is," his voice was laced with equal amounts of sarcasm and venom.
You allow yourself to hold him pressed against you and he is holding onto you for dear life, mumbling your name in the crook of your neck and you still don't know what to say or what you did to deserve him but you think he gets it anyways. He sounds as disbelieving as you feel and it's perfect.
