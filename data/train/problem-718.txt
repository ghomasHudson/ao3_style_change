As the students filled out of the train carriage, led by John and the two other teachers, Sherlock decided to go find Molly – he didn't want to look like he was following John around like lost puppy. When he caught up with Molly she was more than happy to see him and welcomed him over to her small group. Out of the entire student body, Molly and her friendship group were the only pupils Sherlock could get on with, or even tolerate for that matter. After joining the small group Sherlock stuck with them as they got onto another tube and headed towards the nearest station to the museum, the South Kensington station. Much to his surprise, Sherlock found that he fitted in pretty well with Molly and her friends (Toby, Martha, Tom and Rebecca) and occasionally joined in with their conversations. Even so, when they reached the Science Museum, Sherlock slipped away from the group in favour of walking around the museum in solitude.
"No, any idiot could tell Mr. Dior was on something. What Sally was referring to was the way I can deduce things about people that others don't see."
Remembering where they were, John regained composure and rolled his eyes at his friends teasing. “Come on Sherlock” he called, checking the time on his watch, “we’ve got just enough time to catch the next tube back to the museum”.
"Considering it's what…" Sherlock paused to look at the clock, "thirty-seven second to go, I would say it's rather pointless now, wouldn't you?"
"Well don't you think-" Sherlock was about to make some rather nasty, but nonetheless accurate, deductions about Miss Jones until he was cut off by John's hand on his shoulder.
“John, not that I’m not grateful, because truly I am, like wow, thank you.” He was rambling, pull it together Sherlock. “I just mean; I don’t really see the deduction”.
"Probably the drugs again" Sherlock murmured, but to his horror, the entire class, including Mr. Watson, turned to look at him. Crap, he had meant to say that quieter.
John sighed, he did not want to be feeling sorry for himself anymore, he’d spent too long regretting past choices. However, today was a good day, not only was he about to announce an exciting trip for his year thirteen class, but that class had Sherlock in it and the younger male never failed to put a smile on John’s face. John watched as thirty-something students filed into the biology lab. He had been looking forward to his last lesson all day; the school board had finally approved his plans to take his sixth form class to the Natural Science Museum in London. John's granddad, an army doctor himself and John's childhood hero had taken him to the Museum for his sixth birthday and proceeded to do so for every birthday until John turned twelve. Grandpa Watson had died a mere month before John's twelfth birthday, this trip would be the first time John had been to the Museum without his granddad.
John returned to his desk and pulled up the register as his tutorial class filed in. He hadn't meant to be so pathetic around Sherlock whilst they were talking about London, but John couldn't help it. Ever since he had been discharged from the army he desperately missed the excitement and adventure that came with being a soldier. Well, until he met Sherlock, that boy had lit a flicker of wonder inside John, what with his incredible intellect and the sense of mystery that followed him. 'Huh', the constant thrill-seeking part John thought, maybe he should go with Sherlock after all. John had to stop himself in his thoughts. It was not appropriate for a teacher to be thinking about one of his students like that. But Sherlock wasn’t just his student, John felt as if the pair had become good friends as they bonded over the last couple of weeks. John had thought that his lunchtime appointments with Sherlock would’ve raised a few eyebrows among the faculty, but the other teachers actually seemed grateful – apparently Sherlock was known to ruffle a few feathers around the school. John supposed that his colleagues were just pleased that he was able to mentor the younger Holmes and help keep him focused in classes. As long as no one questioned his budding friendship with Sherlock, John did not mind. He had grown very fond of the boy.
“I know we normally say no gifts but you just seemed so down over the last few days that I-” Mycroft began.
“You can’t pay for everything.” Sherlock moaned, he was already so grateful for the train tickets and for dinner.
“So John, I was thinking,” Sherlock began, “seeing as we’re about to break up for the Christmas holiday and we’re going to be apart – I mean away – for a few weeks, maybe we could erm… meet up sometime during that time?”
Fortunately for Sherlock the drive to the train station wasn’t long and they were soon pulling into the drop off zone. Sherlock slung his rucksack across his back, gave a quick “thank you” to Mycroft and shot off towards the station entrance.
Sherlock grinned at John. "Are you serious? I would love to. But can we? I mean are we actually allowed to leave?"
Sherlock had spent all the previous night researching which exhibitions he wanted to visit, he had decided on going to the Computing, Medical History and Psychology exhibitions first and then see what else was around. He'd even made sure he got an early night, which meant postponing his latest experiment analyzing fingerprints, so that he would be up on time the following day. Although Sherlock realised that it wouldn't have mattered much anyway, he had managed to get up and ready in less than five minutes; leaving him with a half hour wait before Mycroft was set to drive him to the train station to meet up with the rest of his class. Sherlock spent that time wondering what John was doing in that moment. Was he just waking up? Or, like Sherlock, had he woken early in anticipation? Maybe he was still fast asleep? Or was he awake, thinking of Sherlock as he was thinking of him?
Mycroft rolled his eyes at his brother’s keenness and made a mental note to find out more this ‘John’.
"Oh guys, your enthusiasm is sooo encouraging" he added as he loaded the power point for the following lesson.
“I know Christmas isn’t your favourite time of the year, believe me I share your distain, but you seem to be more glum than usual, is anything the matter?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock’s mother was not the only one to be intrigued by his planned day trip to the capital. Ever since the start of his last term, Mycroft has noticed a change in his younger brother. At first it was the newfound eagerness for lessons – or rather he had stopped the constant complaining. Then, there was the increase in social activity, both with class trips and at the family dinner table. Mycroft couldn’t help but feel as if the shift in Sherlock was something more than teenage hormones. The older Holmes suspected although hesitated to deduce so prematurely, that his brother was experiencing his first crush. Mycroft was delighted, as at least once, one Holmes boy could exhibit traits of normal adolescence (not to mention the potential for teasing). That’s not to say that he himself had not experienced infatuations. On the contrary, Mycroft was used to such attractions, especially when both sexes took his fancy (it was displays of power that tempted Mycroft the most). However, from rather a young age, he had decided that he would stop at nothing in his own pursuit of power and so decided to focus solely on his work.  Mycroft made a mental note to observe Sherlock a little closer and see if his suspicions were correct.
Dimmock didn't get a chance to reply, or, if he did, Sherlock chose to ignore it as the bell had just rang and it was finally lunchtime. Sherlock couldn't get to the Biology lab quick enough and consequently ended up crashing into nearly every student he passed in the corridors. As soon as he reached the door of the lab he suddenly very nervous. What if, after getting to know Sherlock more, John decided that he didn't like him after all? 'Come on Sherlock, man up!' he thought to himself and took a deep breath, pushing against the door and entering the lab.
John smiled up as he saw Sherlock return. “Nothing to worry about. Although, as much as I hate to say it, I think it’s time I got you home.”
Sherlock decided to let all the other students filter onto the train before hopping on himself. Luckily, Sherlock had seen that John had taken a seat at the far back of the carriage and so he started to head in that direction, hoping John would call him over. However, as Sherlock neared, he realised that not only was John looking hungover but his jumper was on back-to-front. At the disheveled sight of his teacher Sherlock suppressed his nerves and sat beside John without being prompted.
John let Sherlock pick the Tower of London as their last destination and was almost proud to realise he could remember the way. It was roughly a half-hour walk from the courtroom, but neither of them minded. In fact, they were happy just walking side-by side, taking in all of London. Even John, who had lived here whilst training, found that he was enthralled by the city sights. Sherlock didn’t think it was possible for a human being to feel such levels of happiness. That was until a group of kids jostled passed them and caused John to grab hold of Sherlock’s hand to avoid being separated. The kids quickly moved past them, but John and Sherlock’s hands stayed intertwined. Despite an initial rush of adrenaline, it felt natural for the pair to connect together.
“So because some substitute teacher had an opinion, you decide you don’t want to be friends” Sherlock couldn’t help but sound bitter. “Oh but then, when she leaves and you don’t have to be ashamed anymore, it’s fine for you to be seen with me”.
“Hmm, if you say so Sherlock.” Mycroft clearly did not believe his younger brother; however, he wasn’t about to launch into a heart-to-heart in the middle of a Starbucks.
They were able to get two rooms at a good price as the bed and breakfast had received last minute cancellations. John hoped that Sherlock felt a little less guilty for letting John pay, not that he minded of course. They decided to get an early night, knowing that they now had the rest of the day to explore London. The receptionist handed them their keys and explained that the two rooms available were on opposite ends of the building. John walked Sherlock to his room, wanting to make sure he got in okay. They were pleased to find that the rooms were stocked with toiletries as neither had packed thinking they would stay overnight. John stayed briefly to have a cup of tea with Sherlock before leaving to go to his own room. As he reached the door Sherlock called out to him, making a quip about not getting a goodnight kiss. John rolled his eyes and planted the sweetest, light kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
"You're the only one who thinks so, well, unless you count my parents. And I certainly don't." Sherlock said, uncharacteristically bashful.
“Was not.” John argued petulantly. “She was just very forward that’s all. Anyway, less of that, have you decided what you want to do today?”
Even as a child Sherlock was not an early riser on Christmas Day, it was rarer if he roused before eleven o’clock, and this was usually only if Mycroft came to wake him. It wasn’t that Mycroft was any fonder of the day, he just always woke up in the early hours – usually to fit in as much work as he could before his mother insisted he ‘put away that damn computer for once’. This year was no different and as usual Mycroft appeared in his doorway at precisely ten thirty. Sherlock had fiercely tried negotiated with mother for a later start to the day, by Violet had insisted that he must get up then as his aunt and uncle were set to come round at midday. Sherlock grumbled and forced himself to sit up in bed, Mycroft had already turn on his lights so he had no hope of returning back to sleep.
Sherlock took a minute to digest what John was saying. He had been so wrapped up in concealing his feelings for John that he had failed to realise that others might have started to question the pairs daily meetings. Shit. Did that mean they could also have noticed how Sherlock felt for his teacher? Did that mean John had noticed? He shook his head, if John truly knew then he was certain that he wouldn’t want anything to do with him. He can’t know.
“In case of emergencies? Is that the best line you could think of?” Sherlock teased, copying into his phone the number John has given him.
John chuckled and proceeded to lead Sherlock towards the nearest staircase; if his memory sufficed the science labs were located in the west wing of the second floor. It had been a lifetime since John had walked these corridors, before Afghanistan and his injury, but John didn’t feel as if he had been away for any longer than a day. Much to their amusement, the first laboratory they tried was inhabited by a class of medical students but after darting out, all the while suppressing the urge to giggle, the quickly found an uninhabited lab.
The following day Sherlock was even more distant in class than he usually was as he was sat anticipating his lunch with Mr. Watson. He'd been kept awake all night by thoughts of his Biology teacher, Sherlock knew nothing could become of it but he chalked it up to his first teenage crush. Mycroft would be appalled. And, it seemed, he wasn't the only one to be taken by John Watson, practically every female student appeared to share Sherlock's crush for the teacher, despite him only being there for two days now. Increasingly, Mr. Watson's offer of lunch made Sherlock feel all the more special. As far as he knew, and Sherlock prided himself on being 'plugged in' to all the school gossip, he was the only student to be ask by Mr. Watson to join him out of class.
Mycroft never bothered to reply. Instead he just silently drove them home. Sherlock presumed he was thinking about work. He was wrong. It had taken Mycroft all of 26 seconds to deduce that his brother was in love and he was determined to figure out who it was.
Once on the train they settled into a quiet carriage and were thankful to be the only occupants. Sherlock sent off a quick text to Mycroft to ask for a lift home from the train station.
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow, "Forget a small crush, she's fairly infatuated with you, as is the rest of the female cohort at Baker Street Comp."
Sherlock checked the times on his phone again. “Yes, but I can’t ask you to bring us back. You’ve already done so much.”
As if by some clichéd miracle the school-bell rang out, signalling the end of the lunch break. Sherlock quickly packed up his experiment, not wanting to make things any less uncomfortable and said a hurried goodbye as he darted off to his next class.
John regained composure and internally cursed Sherlock for the effect he had on him. They both gathered up what little belongings they had and headed for the train station. It hadn’t occurred to them to stop holding hands, not that either of them minded.
“Sherlock, do you really not get it?” John marvelled, “I’m not ashamed to be seen with you, I just don’t want to lose my job to idle gossip”.
It was the first day back since the class trip to London that previous Friday and Sherlock was feeling more than a little apprehension. It was as if they pair had shared a moment of intimacy with one another, but now had to go back to pretending that they were no more than teacher and student. Sherlock was eager not to overstep a line with John, he was his student after all and Sherlock did not want to let a schoolboy crush affect the career of someone he care about. As usual he waited for the lunch bell to ring out before heading over to John’s room, he had always thought it would be best to give it a little time so that all of John’s students had filed out of the classroom before he entered himself. Today was no different to the many other times he had spent his lunches with John, however Sherlock could tell instantly that something was not quite wrong with John. In the days before their trip to London Sherlock had noticed that John would brighten up the minute Sherlock stepped through the door and more often than not would put aside whatever he was doing to engage in conversation with him. However, when Sherlock entered the biology classroom this time he watched as John called out a quick ‘hello’ without taking his eyes away from his pile of books to be marked. Sherlock observed that this was more than likely a forced effort not to look directly at Sherlock as it was an obvious change in John’s usual behaviour. Why he did not want to be seen to look directly at Sherlock he did not know, and he didn’t like not knowing. He decided to hope that he was just overlooking John’s reaction and make causal conversation.
After setting up the experiment, Sherlock sat back and waited for the chemical reaction he needed to take place. He decided to use the natural pause in his work to bring up to John the idea of meeting over the Christmas break.
It had been John, for god's sake! It should be different with John. Why couldn't he just relax, enjoy, relish the attention?
He stores his fresh supplies in his usual hiding place, then showers. He allows himself five minutes in John's bedroom, looking down at the solid frame of the sleeping man – the sight still novel and therefore a bit daunting - before retreating to the living room and sitting in his chair in the dark. He's waiting for the sun to slowly rise over London, that great cesspool, the belly of the beast, the place he hates but can't live without, longing to feel the quiver of its beating heart.
"I'd like to brand you," Sherlock said. He was running his hand over John's shoulder as he spoke, and he spoke so soothingly and deeply that it was a moment before it sank in.
The next morning, John found a mug of tea waiting for him on the kitchen table, and toast, with jam, on a plate. They were both stone cold - John hadn't been able to go to sleep for hours, and had slept far past his usual time to wake - but it was a nice thought.
John picked up a book, and tried to read it. He didn't get very far. He didn't hear anything more from downstairs, until - half an hour later - the violin music switched off.
He ran through the mundanities, put the phone down, flipped the card out of sight - Mycroft would cancel it tomorrow - and said to John, "Do you remember your safe word?"
"Don't waste my time, John. Come." He pushed upwards, gently, and John's cock rubbed against Sherlock's trouser-leg, his balls rubbing against Sherlock's shoe. "Come
A few minutes later, John was out of the chains. The handcuffs went back in Sherlock's pocket, the shackles were kicked back under the chair. By the time John had recovered enough from the stickiness of the afterglow, the dildos were out of sight (he later found the one Sherlock had used on him soaking in a bucket of bleach in the bathroom) and Sherlock had dropped a blanket from the couch over him.
The fantasy of being used by Sherlock was still clear in his mind (even if, after three wanks, he wasn't getting hard over it any more) but it would stay a fantasy. Even if Sherlock actually made it happen, it would still be a fantasy.
John's hands were sliding behind his back, wanting the kiss of cuffs around them. "No," he said stupidly. "I wouldn't."
Except that now John knew, he was learning to spot the signs of Sherlock in a hair-trigger mood, both before and after. He didn't suppose he could be sure of every time - but Sherlock laid was fractionally, just noticeably, different from Sherlock in any other mood.
John made the kind of "oh" face, that said he was relegating Sherlock's situation with Mycroft as something like  his own situation with his alcoholic sister, and that infuriated Sherlock, abruptly, silently. He took the phone away from John. "Did you finish placing the order?" he asked him.
"I told you I don't do relationships," Sherlock said crisply. "I don't have a relationship with that man. Nor with any of them. They're just... useful."
He waited, and Sherlock didn't ask him. John wasn't even sure any more if he knew when Sherlock was going out to use other men.
"I can make you a cup of tea if you like," Sherlock said. "But it would help if you could stay there for half an hour."
John looked down at his laptop. He squirmed, involuntarily. He thought of being naked on the floor with the cuffs and shackles on, a dildo stuffing his ass, Sherlock's cock in his mouth. He was hard as a rock, and he saw Sherlock's eyes fixed on him, taking that in.
"How many men do you...?" John paused, and as Sherlock went on looking at him with raised eyebrows, finally asked " - do you have that kind of... 'not-relationship'?"
He sat down on his bed, dropped the shopping on the floor, and put his face in his hands. When the naked man jerked his head back Sherlock had been standing there fully-clothed except for his dick, which was long, thick, red, dripping wet from being sucked down the man's throat, and very, very erect.
"John," Sherlock said, nearer. He'd been at the foot of the stairs, he'd evidently gone up a few steps. "Are you all right? Answer me."
John's mouth was open. There was no pain, only an inexorable stretching feeling, but suddenly a flash of pure pleasure. He had made a noise.
He enjoyed kneeling at Sherlock's feet and nuzzling at his hands and begging for food, he loved squirming naked with a stretching dildo inside him begging Sherlock for treats, for a drink, to be allowed to swallow Sherlock's cock - but of course that wouldn't happen in front of anyone else. Sherlock enjoyed paddling John for breaking the rules, but as he had warned John, he wasn't a very dedicated sadist: John would have enjoyed being paddled more often, but Sherlock could always think of an infraction of the rules to beat him for when Sherlock felt like causing pain.
"Good," said Sherlock, and spoke down the phone to the take-out woman. "Just double all the portions, will you?"  He was not at all hungry. He hoped John was. "Oh, and add another portion of egg-fried rice."
Besides, John would be expecting that the evening would end with a blowjob. John liked having his face fucked. Sooner or later, it was going to occur to John that he was in this stand for use, not pleasure - Sherlock was too tall to use John's mouth with any degree of comfort, and John wasn't stretched enough for Sherlock to fuck him there. But it certainly wouldn't occur to John any time soon, from the dazed expression on his face.
"John," Sherlock said to him once in the middle of the evening, weeks and weeks later, "Do you remember your safeword?"
And John could go directly from discovering he had this turn-on to getting to experience it for real, no strings attached.
"Okay, I'm used to it. Would have been more convenient with the Battersea Trunk murder," John added. He remembered that. "I was right there when you walked out, and I got your text when I was on my way to bed. Joined you half an hour later. You could have got yourself off and me off in the time you spent going to the hotel."
"What? No," John said. He could not imagine anything less exciting than messing around with an object he probably wouldn't be able to get into his ass anyway.
" but a man who - however accidentally - walks in on his flatmate and interrupts a very nice blow job, does not have the moral high ground.
"Excellent. If you safeword," Sherlock sounded quite smug, "I can get these chains open in less than half a minute, I have tested this. Is this your first time in bondage, John?"
At some point, he realised he couldn't hold his piss in any longer, and realised why Sherlock had spread newspaper under him, and let go, emptying his bladder.
When the door opened, he realised Sherlock was back early. Sherlock didn't greet him. He came over to the table beside the stand, and there was another click. The alarm was off. Sherlock released the clips that held him to the stand, and helped John up, with impersonal hands. Sherlock looked relaxed and satisfied.
"Yes," Sherlock said, feeling for the latest credit card freshly purloined from Mycroft. "Big brother will pay." Mycroft had bought him dinner, Mycroft should buy John dinner, that was only fair.
Sherlock got up again. Where he had touched, John's skin felt bereft. When he came back, it was with an armful of dildos, some lube, and two keys embedded in a lump of blu-tac. He crouched down beside John, and showed him the keys, then stuck them to the top of the coffee-table. "The red key is for the handcuffs: do you need to confirm you can reach that and use it with your mouth, if necessary?"
He went to stay the weekend with Clara and Harry. Harry wasn't drinking any more. John scrupulously returned on the day and train he had specified. He had no idea if Sherlock had used one of his men in Baker Street while he was away, and he knew he shouldn't ask. He kept wondering.
"If he gets off on being verbally humiliated I'm quite willing to indulge him, though he needs to be very clear about his trigger words." Sherlock paused. He was staring at John very intently. His voice got darker, rougher. "Some men get off on being told they're greedy cocksluts. Or that they're squirming pigs just begging to be filled. Or they like being told they're whores."
John had planned to stay overnight with Clara after visiting Harry in rehab. He liked Clara. Clara liked him.
"Why would I want to do that?" Sherlock sounded surprised. "I made you tea," he added. "We're out of milk."
Sherlock stared at him, for a long moment. His phone beeped again, twice, but Sherlock didn't move to respond. At last he said, "You know my methods, John. Apply them."
John stared off out of the window. It was a rainy night. He really ought to say "no," and then "thanks for the tea" and then "good night, Sherlock, see you in the morning".
John sat still. He had realised last night - without Sherlock laying a hand on him - that he was turned on by the idea of being dominated, sexually, by a man. By a
"I had already made an arrangement to meet the individual I intended to use tonight. It wouldn't have been good practice to cancel unless it was an emergency. Generally I lose them," Sherlock added a little grumpily, "because they get irked when I have to cancel because it
"I'm going to put you in this regularly," he told John. "Every time you go in it, I'm going to put a bigger dildo up your ass, and fasten it in. I'm going to stretch that tight little hole of yours wide enough until I can fuck you any time I want to."
This was a lost story. I started writing it about the same time as I was writing the Cages series, and I got to this chapter, and then I ran out of juice - same life events that stopped me finishing Cages - and then the file just slid to the bottom of the folder and I actually completely forgot about it. Happened to open it during the lockdown, and realized I could still see how to finish it. Hope you're enjoying it!
He'd meant to keep John in the breeding stand for an hour, the first time. He realised, as he was slowly feeding John the last morsels of rice, that it had been twice that. He had better get the dildo out. He had to be very careful about that, the thing had been in so long, but he eased the glass weight out of John's hole with exceeding care and no damage.
But Sherlock never did. He and John were kept very busy for a few weeks on a succession of cases, and when Sherlock jumped off St. Bart's and left John alone, John's hide was still unmarked.
Sherlock had never yet fucked John, though John thought he must have stretched John's hole wide enough to get his erect prick inside. His hands removing the dildo, unbuckling the harness, were brisk and almost impersonal. John knew his place was to bend and move and open as Sherlock's hands and voice instructed. Sherlock didn't speak to him at all, and when he did - when John was locked in the folding contraption, bent and spread so that he was completely available and completely helpless - his voice was light and brisk.
What if Sherlock did a scene with him once and he was "performance unsatisfactory" and Sherlock never wanted to have him again? (Then they'd just never do it again.)
Except that those six scenes with Sherlock - bondage, dildos, Sherlock fucking his mouth til he came, and then seeing to it that John came too - were clear and burning in his memory. They were wank fodder - of course: but when John realised he was fantasising about being on the floor of 221b Baker Street with Sherlock standing over him in order to be able to come when he was having sex with a perfectly nice nurse, he felt - weird.
It was not worth verbally consulting John beforehand. John might well agree in theory, like a brave little soldier willing to try anything once, but Sherlock would only know if John was genuinely excited by observing his reactions.
"Of course you are," Sherlock said. "I like the idea of knowing there is a mark on you that no one will ever remove, that shows you're mine."
Sherlock's gaze fixed on John's face and travelled down his body speculatively. "Interesting," he breathed.
"You take what I give you," he told John, and began with the first dish of roast pork with black bean sauce. He'd thought of chopsticks, or spoons, but fingers were safest - John's head was the only part of him he
“Relax if you want to.” Sherlock purrs, kneeling between John's spread legs. There's pressure against John's rectum and then he shudders as he feels Sherlock's finger breach his rim.
“Take your shower.” Sherlock whispers and there's a dark promise resonating in his tone that makes John's knees buckle. “Then come to bed with me.”
The first time John catches Sherlock fiddling with an epidermic, they have a violent row, which ends with Sherlock sobbing at John's feet, begging him to stay while at the same time refusing to give up his habit. It's a fight in which John still isn't sure which side to take.
Until his head is jerked away, his sensitive follicles screaming at the hard drag of John's fingers. John's cock slides from his mouth with a wet pop, and Sherlock is panting, his breathe ragged. A thick thread of spit clings to John's glans as Sherlock raises his gaze to meet John's; a debauched creature, a Byronic temptation with a lascivious grin plastered on his face. He's breathtaking. John shoves him down again, stuffing his mouth until his eyes water while he fights for air.
Next, Sherlock licks tentatively at the base of John's cock, which is rapidly stiffening. He's just using the tip of his tongue and John realises that Sherlock is tasting him. John sighs and flexes his hands, still unsure if he's allowed to touch but when Sherlock rubs his nose against his shaft, he's past caring, knitting his fingers into Sherlock's silky curls, pressing him close.
Soon Sherlock's fingers are glistening wet while his strokes make slick noises as he speeds up. The tendons on his neck strain; the hand on the headboard clenches to hold tight. Sherlock's eyes are still fixed on John's face. As Sherlock brushes his thumb over the slit of his cock he can't hold back a gasp.
“Don't you dare ever leave me again, Sherlock.” John hisses against Sherlock's nape. “Don't you dare.”
Nothing happened. Not to him. A broken body on hard cold soil in a dirty back alley... IT CAN'T. Full stop.
As he eats his supper, John has the best intentions to follow an episode of Midsummer Murder but as the story unfolds, he catches himself imagining Sherlock's pejorative comments on the thin plot and after half an hour even John knows who's done it. He doesn't make it to the second pod but falls asleep on the couch, the open can resting precariously between his thighs.
“I don't want to talk about it, not right now.” Sherlock sighs against John's skin. But then he stirs, frees himself, gets up and walks over to his desk, taking a sip of wine this time as he rummages through a drawer. John is struck once again by Sherlock's ethereal beauty. He's skinny, true, with protruding ribs and visible vertebrae, the joints of his bony shoulders and knees much too prominent, but his lithe body glows in the dimmed light, almost otherworldly. His movements are still elegant, even if there's a slight limp to his gait.
They just gaze at each other for over thirty seconds until John asks, his voice shaking: “May I come in?”
“Hangover?” John asks gleefully, before he reads the label. It’s tramadol. “Seriously, Sherlock, don’t you think that’s a bit over the top?” John sounds equally concerned and angry.
“We wasted so much time, Sherlock. It took us so long to finally get there and then... we lost everything.” John's shoulders sag and his puffy eyes are filled with regret.
John blushes. But of course, Sherlock is right. Images flood his brain - of Sherlock with other men -  and he feels heat pool low in his gut despite violent jealousy roaring through his veins. He can hear his pulse hammer in his ears. John bites the inside of his cheek to calm down a fraction.
“For a while.” John says darkly. “And this John seems to have been practising as a doctor. Will, this is getting a little bit spooky, you have to admit.”
Sherlock had long since made his peace with the fact that he himself had a rigid and very small array of things other people would let him do to them that would get him off, especially as he had a dick that, when erect, made most people decide they didn't want to get fucked by him after all, especially not up the ass. Other people wanted variety in sex. Sherlock did not.
"I bought some," John said. Sherlock making tea was right up there with odd like Sherlock tying a man up and getting a blow-job in the middle of their sitting room.
"Yes, grunt for me, John, let me know you're enjoying this, you like being filled, don't you, toy soldier, little man, you like it when you're filled, you're stretching, you can take this, your ass was meant to be plugged, John, you're just a little toy who needed to be used - "
He put the milk in the fridge, deciding not to raise the issue of the severed hand in the salad crisper - that was a fight they could have tomorrow - and discovered that Sherlock had, indeed, made him tea. In his RAMC mug, which Sherlock had been categorically forbidden from using for experiments. John added milk. He took the tea over to his armchair, and sat down in it, and drank the tea. There was a pile of rope and a pair of scissors piled on the coffee table.
"No," John said, and manfully, he placed himself on the stand, and was silent while Sherlock triced him up.  The stand held the subject's legs wide apart, exposing his anus, feet off the floor, knees and thighs supported comfortably, arms fastemed down in three places, mouth at an angle only convenient for face-fucking for a much shorter man than Sherlock. Held in the stand, the subject's groin and belly and tits were completely exposed to a groping hand, and his ass was at the right level for being fucked.
"John," Sherlock said, in his darkest, richest voice. "You're here for my pleasure. You're spread open, held, ready to be used. Feel your ass opening up to me. I want to see you well mounted on it, filling your hole, spitting you and making you grunt. Can you feel that? Very good, John, you're taking this very well, you were made for this, you were made to be used, weren't you? A little virgin, just a toy who hasn't been played with, something for me to pick up and use. You were made to be used, John, your asshole wants filling, you're squirming now as you feel me pushing into you, deep into you, stretching your hole, making you ready. Oh, you liked that, didn't you?"
John went quietly up the stairs, skipping the one that creaked, quietly opened the door, and quietly stopped in the doorway, mouth gaping.
Sherlock was pacing up and down, muttering to himself, when John sat up, still hot with afterglow, feeling both drained and relaxed. Sherlock was still fully dressed, still wearing his coat, and there was a splatter of cum-stain on one trouser leg.
"Yes," John agreed, again. "I'm yours to use." He breathed, deeply, feeling that complicated, deep twist inside him, smelling Sherlock's arousal. "Do you want me to beg?"
He walked home to 221b Baker Street: at least it would be a year before Mycroft felt they had to go through that again.
Mrs Hudson was in, TV on, watching something loud and American. The door to 221b was shut, but violin music was leaking under it, so Sherlock was probably in his room, thinking aloud, and John could avoid a string of deductions about Harry, Clara, and John's relationship with them both - if he was quiet.
There were five dildos on the table. They were glass, shining, and they all looked huge. John swallowed. He didn't want to pick the smallest one - though even that looked too big to go up his ass - but he was outright scared of the largest two. Even the middle one -  "The red one," he said finally. Second-smallest.
The stream of dark rich words went on, and John hardly knew what Sherlock was saying, except that every word added to his excitement, the thing is his ass pushing grunts of pleasure out of him. He could not move, he wanted to move, he didn't want Sherlock to stop.
Sherlock withdrew from his mouth and John saw him neatly knot the condom. "Oh, you wanted my spunk?" Sherlock said. He sounded amused. "Greedy toy. Now I suppose you want to come?" Sherlock studied John a moment. He put his foot under John's cock and balls. touching the delicate, stretched skin between balls and asshole with the toe of his shoe.
Sherlock sat down on the couch, used his laptop for about quarter of an hour - he didn't speak, and John was quite comfortable. Sherlock got up, put his coat on - John could hear that - and spread some newspapers underneath John, without speaking to him. He pinched John on one of his buttocks, almost fondly. "Have a good evening, pig," he said, and leaned over. "Remember - me, Mrs Hudson, Mycroft." There was a click. "The alarm is now on," Sherlock said, and left the room.
"Oh, very good," Sherlock said. He sounded genuinely pleased. He bent John over with a push. The spreader bar at his ankles was forcing his buttocks apart. Sherlock crouched down behind him, and John felt the cold wet brush of lubricant at his anus. John gritted his teeth. He had no intention of safewording out this time, but he felt awkward, cold, unaroused, and anticipated discomfort.
The phone beeped again. Sherlock looked down at the screen. "Yes, you idiot, I did mean you should arrest the gardener." He typed into his phone again, finishing with a caustic "
John closed down his laptop, and picked it and his dignity up. "No, Sherlock," he said. "Can't say I do."
. I want to know you can use me, however you want." He swallowed. "You said once you fuck your toys, if they're stretched enough on your dildos. I want you to stretch me like that. I want to be your toy."
John simply forbids his brain to imagine anything happening between Sherlock and Gibson. He's... cold and arrogant and predatory and over-confident and ruthless, so what could Sherlock possibly see in him?
Sherlock strongly wants to abscond, to delete this unwelcome experience, distancing himself from this new found insight into John's libidinous pursuits but somehow his fingers seem to be glued to the doorknob.
“Don't you think you should contact her and tell her, warn her?” John asks after a moment, sounding uneasy.
“You don’t even know what I wanted to say, John.” Sherlock protests, obviously miffed for being talked over.
Sherlock turns towards John, blushing a little as he rolls his eyes. “You seemed to be genuinely enjoying yourself.”
Called out like that, John realises that the intention to confide in someone might have been at least part of his invitation to Greg. Lestrade's one of the few people John has met who knew Sherlock back then – at least that's what John assumes.
A few minutes later, a police sergeant unlocks John's handcuffs and hands him a pencil and a piece of paper.
They decide to go to one of the sleazy little hotels lining the dark side street. John pays $ 20 for the whole night and signs in as Mr Smith. The janitor doesn't so much as look away from the TV he's watching when handing him his key to room number 6.
Gently, John turns Sherlock's face towards himself. He knows he has to do something right now, or this will end in disaster before it had even properly begun.
“How's the wife?” he asks instead, which is an obvious diversion but he doesn't want to lie to Lestrade and can't be honest with him either – it's too fresh and raw, whatever IT is, and John doesn't even know if Sherlock wants to go public with it (a few weeks ago John would have thought Sherlock didn't care but now he's not so sure. No, that's not true – a few weeks ago John would have dropped dead if anyone had suggested he might share Sherlock's bed and be allowed to kiss him until he's cross-eyed, so he’d never reached the stage where he could contemplate confessing being in love with the git).
“No!” John wails, despite his muscles slowly relaxing. After a few seconds he has to grudgingly concede. “Yes.”
Greg turns to face him; the DI, too, is visibly shaken. The hand he rakes through his silver hair trembles. Eventually he says: “I tried to keep an eye on him. But it’s impossible to keep track of Sherlock Holmes if he doesn’t want you to.”
“Because I think I am entitled to! What I mean is I have to know what happened to you so I can... protect you.”
“Oh god yes, please, Sherlock, let me watch you touch yourself.” John skids up the bed until he can rest his back against the headboard to give Sherlock some space.
There's some change in it (two pounds fifty) and a handwritten note on equally high quality cardboard:
"No, I didn't. As far as I’m concerned, it's live and let live round here. Good day, young man!" And with that, she slams the door in Sherlock's furious face.
Ok... this has been… unexpected. Not bad, just … extraordinary, in every aspect. And a little bit unsettling.
Just when he's quite sure that he will not get an answer from Greg, the DI enquires in a cautious tone: “Sherlock talked to you about his past?” Greg furrows his brow in consternation.
Sherlock doesn't like this tone. He looks really hard at John. Pub, three pints, talk. A revelation. Shock. Afterwards John took the tube home. He has cried.
Suddenly, the man drops his lazy demeanour and sits up. He even puts his cigarette away in a saucer on a nearby low table.
John whistles. “Bit full of yourself, aren't you. You know what I could get for a grand round here?”
William entangles himself reluctantly. “Just one more piece, addressed to Sherlock.” There’s a dove-grey envelope, made of heavy quality paper at the bottom of the box. It's in John's handwriting. William carefully unfolds the containing letter and reads aloud:
Again marvelously beta'd by Lockedinjohnlock, who, even as she was snowed under, found time to work her magic on this ridiculously long chapter that I threw at her feet. She recorded some exceptionally  great podfic recently, to which you can listen here: http://archiveofourown.org/users/Lockedinjohnlock
“What is it now?” Sherlock sighs, exasperated, before turning around to face John with a huff. He blows a thick wisp of black curl out of his sore eye and settles his chin on his crooked elbow.
The man below him has stayed silent so far, but suddenly, he moans, low and guttural. The sound shoots directly to John's balls.
That night, Sherlock tells John what happened in Serbia – well, not everything, just as much as he can manage without breaking down again. It somehow seems easier in the dark, though of course Sherlock knows that this is ridiculous. He tells John about the flogging, the whipping, the shackles. He tells John about the cold and the thirst and the hunger and the fear; the exhaustion that nearly broke him. That he'd felt so filthy, lying almost naked in his own blood, piss and vomit on a soiled concrete floor after yet another tormentor had had a go at him, literally kicking the shit out of him. John goes very quiet before wrapping one arm around Sherlock's shoulders, pulling him in.
“What... Sherlock, could you... What are you doing?” John's erection is flagging rapidly. Being manhandled this way reminds him of Sherlock making use of corpses at Bart's morgue.
John doesn’t go slow. In fact, he pushes in in one languid slide, all the way to the hilt. Sherlock’s hole spasm around the intruding cock as his eyes roll back in his head. The stretch is nearly too much; it burns, and Sherlock makes a small noise, squirms, tries to accommodate the huge cock breaching him – and then, as he thinks that he will finally drop out of his role and tell Hamish – John – to stop, the fireworks go off again.
“What is it?” John enquires tiredly. He expects some silly demand or odd question (like “Where did you put my blow-torch?” or “Why's there no turpentine left?” that is, things Sherlock would typically request at eleven thirty at night). That's probably why he's taken aback when Sherlock asks in a rather endearing (because obviously forced) casual way: “May I bunk in here with you tonight? Mrs Hudson and her friends seriously shatter my nerves.”
“You really don't get it, do you?” John looks up at Sherlock, frowning. As he is met with a somewhat aloof smirk, he redirects his attention to a pair of B-list celebrities trying to waltz around a flashy stage, fake smiles cemented on their heavily made-up faces, the woman wearing a flimsy piece of polyester fabric, barely covering her private parts. It's ridiculous and a little bit repelling. “As you don't seem to have any scruples, you might actually enjoy yourself.” John addresses the screen instead of Sherlock.
“There was a WhatsApp message on Mario's phone, confirming a meeting with Mr Dunbar for the night he died?”
At least we are alive and well. As I hope you are, too. I'll see you in about a month back in dear old blighty.
“Don't give me that bullshit, Sherlock.” As John finally turns around to face Sherlock, he's very pale, with a greenish touch to his features; sweat is beading at his hairline, darkening his fringe. He looks as if he has aged ten years in the last ten minutes.
“Mr Gibson, I presume.” Sherlock states by way of an introduction. “You are on schedule.” It sounds very much like a compliment to John's ears.
“Breathe, John.” Sherlock is still standing with his back against the bookshelf but he seems to relax a fraction as John stumbles further back until he hits the desk with his backside. His head feels dizzy and he has to clutch at the desk so as not to keel over.
Sherlock obliges. John starts to feel slightly dizzy and fears he might keel over out of pure pleasure, melting into a quivering puddle of jelly onto the not too clean carpet. Sherlock steadies him with his left arm slung around his ribcage, a large hand pressing firmly against the middle of John's chest.
We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell. Who said that? It's on the tip of Sherlock's tongue, but then John invades his mouth again, claims him, moaning while still rutting against Sherlock's sartoris.
But was he really prepared to go through with this? So far, they had barely even consciously touched one another. Did John want to? Maybe he was offended by Sherlock's undeniable maleness? And would Sherlock be able to… cope with John’s attentions?
It had been a leap of faith, a plunge in the dark. To say Sherlock had been terrified would be the understatement of a lifetime. But - rather miraculously - everything had turned out fine, for John had somehow understood.
Wednesday: Much better. The room I'm in is stuffy, no window, but it's warm and dry and safe. I can hardly move. I miss you. I think about you constantly. I might even have asked for you in my agony, for the doctor wanted to know who John is. I couldn't tell him, could I?
Wilhelm Moerz was an alleged German spy in England during WW2 (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4775130.stm). Richard Christmann worked for the Nazi German Abwehr both in occupied and free France and later for the secret services of the Federal Republic of Germany, thus exemplifying the right-wing traditions in the West-German security agencies.
“Many have said so, and yet here I am,” Sherlock is still smiling, his voice full of contempt. “Good-morning, Mr. Gibson.”
The silence stretches and it's becoming awkward. John looks down at his bare feet, then up again at his flatmate. It's too dark to be sure but John's quite certain that Sherlock is observing his movements from the corner of his eyes.
John shakes his head; it's a small but livid movement. Then he takes a deep breath. Sherlock steels himself for what is to come.
Sherlock is clawing at the desk with his left hand, while his right impatiently tries to shove a fountain pen up his arse. The angle is awkward, and Sherlock's face contorts in pain.
In the end it's easy. He'd said it so many times; when he'd been lying bleeding and sore in a cellar in Serbia, or lonely in a posh hotel room in Paris, or freezing while hiding in a cave in Algeria, or dozing off on a bus in Turkey, or too sober in a cab on the ride back to Baker Street after John's wedding. It had become kind of a mantra to him, a promise that kept him alive over all those years: “No more hiding. No more lies. I love you, John.”
“God! You really thought …? Now, who's pathetic, Sherlock?” John’s voice is low and cruel as he seems to work himself up into a giggling fit and Sherlock is mortified, literally too afraid to open his eyes, but he forces himself to do so, only to see John striding towards the door.
John doesn't come home in the evening, much to Sherlock's relief. He still feels embarrassed and ridiculed but has decided to completely ignore their fight. He hopes that John – being an average, conventional British male – will treat the issue likewise.
“As I said. In another time, who knows what might have been...,” John sighs. “I want to visit him when we are back home. I hope you don't mind?”
I finally broke down a few weeks back. My comrades had to leave me behind on a farm. The people took me in and cared for me, for which I'll be eternally grateful. I'm masking as a labourer. Thank god my Polish is almost fluent by now. But I keep myself to myself now that I'm better. I have no idea when I might join my unit again. No means of communication.
“What exactly are you talking about, Sherlock?” John sighs. He's lost; for all he knows, Sherlock could be talking about that lung he had a go at earlier.
Sherlock can't suppress the laughter bubbling up in his throat, half nervousness, half genuine amusement.
?” All other noise is drowned out. There's only him and Lestrade confined in a bubble filled with dread.
Truth be told, if Sherlock hadn't been so utterly, frighteningly still and subdued, John would have pinned him to the mattress and shagged him blind.
John had the nerve to let him wait! Due to the heroin, Sherlock wasn't exceptionally hungry. On the contrary, the intense smells of roasted garlic, grilled fish and Mediterranean herbs nearly turned his empty stomach, still burning from his earlier retching. All the people around made him uneasy; he felt watched and confined. Paranoia could be a side-effect of freebasing but Sherlock had never suffered it to this extent before.
“Sorry again.” He sighs, pressing his lips against Sherlock's temple where he can see his pulse hammer out a fast staccato.
Of course, Sherlock is proven right. Two hours later, a much calmer Neil Gibson sits again in their living room – this time properly in the client's chair – and tells his story:
It’s a nice voice. Neither too posh nor too vulgar. London accent. Man, early forties, professional, educated, military background…
John leans back against the door as he imagines Sherlock on his knees in front of him, hard cock in hand, the fully exposed glans glistening wet, begging John to be allowed to touch himself more thoroughly. But John would just shake his head and in response, Sherlock would positively growl with frustration, deep, impatient and raw. The thought of tantalisingly drawing it out, denying Sherlock his immediate satisfaction and of Sherlock obeying him until he’s about to beg for John’s cock in his mouth and his hands between his legs sends a new gush of hot blood to John’s groin. He has to push a hand down the front of his denims to take himself in hand eagerly. Despite his pants growing much too tight, he just hastily undoes three buttons. There's neither time to undress properly nor to get some lube. John’s rock hard and leaking as he finally starts to avidly stroke himself to completion. Last night he’d been too anxious and affronted to take care of the intoxicating arousal holding a vulnerable and half naked Sherlock in the bathroom had provided but now, there's no other option but to deal with this, fast, hard and desperate.
John has, by now, finished putting away the shopping and wanders over into the sitting room, only to find it empty. There's a mug on the coffee table though, indicating that Sherlock has been up. But the tea is cold.
Sherlock is absent-mindedly stirring even more sugar in his tea while his eyes rest thoughtfully on John, who is by now used to being scrutinised by this sharp, otherworldly gaze; but today it's suddenly all a bit too much.
“That would be lovely...” John mutters, but his host has already left the room and made for what seems to be the kitchen. John follows and catches Sherlock grinding real coffee beans in a coffee mill. The smell alone makes his mouth water and his eyes burn.
It'll be good to be back in Europe. Africa was exciting, but it's all rather alien to me. So very different from home.
OK, John thinks, it's finally happening. This is the real thing. God help me, I'm about to get fucked by Sherlock Holmes.
He lies on his back, staring up at the ceiling lit just by the street lamps outside and watches the shadows move as streaks of light stream in from passing cars and buses. He floats, detached, aloof – and then he feels nothing at all.
We had to cut off the poor boys leg. He's been crying ever since. Back home, he was a footballer, played for Arsenal and even was to be capped for England.
This had all been a huge mistake. How could he ever have allowed himself to indulge in such a trivial if nonetheless dangerously addictive pastime as amorous encounters? He was skating on very thin ice here. He had nothing to offer that could possibly attract John. Instead, he'd probably already ruined their friendship beyond repair. How could John look him in the eye and call him his friend after what had happened between them?
“This isn't a dream, is it?” Sherlock gasps after a while, sitting up and reaching for a glass of water, wincing a little when stretching his sore muscles.
John hesitantly answers: “Fairly grim stuff actually. It seemed to me it was the first time Sherlock talked about some of this to anyone.” John shakes his head; it still hurts remembering. “During that conversation your acquaintance came up briefly.”
“You don't like it.” Sherlock touches the base of his cock to prevent the condom from rolling off as he starts to pull out. But John grabs his forearm to stop him.
I love you, Sherlock. I always loved you and I always will. I’m sure we’ll meet again, my beautiful boy.
“Get away from me!” he spits. His face must be contorted in fury and disgust, for Greg takes a step back and raises both his hands.
“Well, don't you know?” John mumbles in a low voice, transfixed as he stares down at his hands on Sherlock's body.
ENSA was The Entertainments National Service Association, an organisation set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during WW2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainments_National_Service_Association).
this work!” He snarls, sounding rather preposterous for a naked man who just tried – and failed – to put an unsuitable object up his arse.
Please, don't judge me too hard. I'm trying to hold myself to a higher standard. But I'm not a saint. Sometimes, I just want to grab a gun and shoot some German soldiers. But I guess they are just frightened boys, too, homesick, too young to know better...
“Please, let me help you. Whatever it is you need... I'll try my best to give it to you.” John is actually blushing. He's not used to giving such emotional reassurances; and Sherlock is not used to receiving them.
His stash is carefully hidden behind the old sepia reproduction of a photograph of Edgar Allen Poe. Sherlock removes the back of the frame and his pulse quickens as he spots the small plastic bag that's still to two thirds filled with a brownish powder. His syringe is wrapped in one of his old pants, stuffed to the back of a drawer. He has good, visible veins but as he doesn't engage in using IV as much of late, he feels in need of a tourniquet, so decides on a worn soft brown leather belt. The ritualistic aspect of this process is at least as important as the actual consumption. One of the numerous used tea mugs strewn around the room supplies him with a spoon, and the water needed to brew a shootable solution he drains from the glass of water prudently provided by John. Finally, he gets out a wrap of antiseptic wipes and a jar of 100% pure vitamin c powder (John had been very pleased when Sherlock asked him to get it at Boots, hoping his flatmate had for once realised the importance of spicing up his unbalanced diet with some healthy supplements).
John's eyes flick over the residue of Sherlock's last night venture on the bedside table, the sad paraphernalia of injecting class A drugs. The used glass syringe is a rather beautiful vintage type, elegant, slender, the silver plunger gleaming; the tube shows residue of blood and light brown flocculation. The sight makes John nauseous. He decides to deal with it later.
John swiftly turns around and hurries to put the clothes onto their designated hook. Even in his inebriated state, Sherlock might be able to spot a hard-on if it pokes him in the thigh.
I met a lovely young nurse. Her name is Mary. Sometimes, we talk between shifts. She's from Tottenham. A very funny lass.
His body is experiencing the odd sensation of remembering how good it felt to be touched, kissed. John just stands there, lost in memories. He suddenly so badly wants to experience those sensations again that he can barely breathe.
“But they were so few. So few. Do you know how many die there every day?” Sherlock sounds equally shaken.
“You know,” John mumbles against Williams lips, “Sherlock is actually a pretty good name, don't you think? Quite distinguished. Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective. Has a ring to it, you have to admit.”
Sherlock's voice is a low rumble when he continues. “In fact, I took some liberties. I could have returned to England after about a year. But I decided against it. Perhaps that's why Mycroft kept you away as well? Even If you'd returned to England, you wouldn't have returned to me.”
He’d actually be glad if he’d meet the killer, and not a typical client awaiting an escort: middle-aged, slightly overweight, thinning hair, cheap aftershave. The killer just wants to dismember him, but real clients are after sexual encounters. Sherlock might even be forced to participate until he would be able to determine if he's dealing with the serial murderer or just some sad closeted sod from the suburbs.
“It's rather painful and humiliating, speaking of the whole sad business. I met Mario about ten years ago when I was investing in a start-up in Brazil. Mario Pinto was the son of a government official in Manaos. He was exotic, beautiful, a bit dangerous and a little unbalanced.” The millionaire gives Sherlock a pointed look but continues as there is no reaction forthcoming from the detective. “I fell head over heels for him. To cut a long story short, I was besotted with him and I married him. We entered into a civil union in 2004. But soon afterwards, as the first passion had died down, I realized that we had nothing, absolutely nothing in common. My love faded. If his had faded too it might have been easier. But whatever I did, nothing could turn Mario from me. He adored me; he insisted on coming to England with me. Well, he knew quite a bit about my dealings with the Brazilians, which hadn't always been entirely above board, as these things seldom are.” Gibson pauses to look at Sherlock again, who doesn't show any sign of disapproval. Instead, his pale eyes stare into nothing as he listens in utmost concentration. Gibson swallows, then continues. “Over here I met Sean Dunbar. He became my PA. Now, I make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours; I had to have him. I told him so, making him a very generous offer. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?”
John and Sherlock share a bed as often as possible with their odd schedules. John has to work longer and longer shifts – both day and night – and Sherlock's comings and goings are even more unpredictable. Yet whenever they meet under one roof, it doesn't take long for them to get rid of their clothes and tumble into each other's arms.
“Oh, come off it, will you.” William sounds almost offended. “I’m sure there’s a perfectly probable explanation for it all.”
Not only are their fingerprints taken, but they are also submitted to a humiliating examination, undertaken by a police surgeon. They have to undress and bend over so the doctor can feel them up, part their cheeks, pet their testicles. He even tries to insert one finger into John's anus, upon which John nearly punches his colleague and has to be detained by another officer, who doesn't have to be told twice to use his truncheon on that crazy faggot.
Now that Sherlock has experienced how much he craves to bond with another human being, he feels all the more humiliated and gutted at how ridiculous and futile his endeavours must appear. A leopard can't change its spots. He is but a repressed, immature aberration of a man, grotesque in body and mind, abnormal and repulsive, unable to connect; a sociopath if there ever was one.
“Well, I guess.” John answers. Then it dawns on him. Sherlock needs data. “Do you want to take a peek?”
But Lestrade doesn't seem to hear him and just ploughs on: “What he did to make a living… I think, to him, it was just services rendered. A simple exchange. But sometimes it seemed like he was… fading away. Jesus, if you'd seen him back then! He looked like death warmed up. Hit it pretty hard. Lived rough. Willow thin, you'd thought he might snuff it any minute. But of course he couldn't resist pissing everybody off who might offer him help.” Greg cringes at the dark unwanted memories. To calm himself he downs the rest of his pint.
Nevertheless, they simply can't keep their hands and mouths off each other. They can't help it. Especially John has hidden away his desires for so long that now, when allowed to let them roam freely, it's almost too much, nearly overwhelming him with their intensity. Luckily, Sherlock is equally eager – and even more experienced than John initially thought. He doesn't dare to ask about Sherlock's past – not after the painful reveals after their first time together – but he's sure that Sherlock has had his fair share of sexual encounters, despite being five years younger than John.
Sherlock shook his head. "John," he said, and unexpectedly, it was in that deep-as-sex purring voice he used when he had John tied up. "Think this through. I enjoy using you. You enjoy being used by me. But as you must already have noticed, I have a very precise set of requirements to get me off. I don't need anything else. You'd get bored, John, and I'd lose a very convenient mouth."
John took his clothes off. Sherlock watched. Naked, John glanced down at the shackles. Sherlock came over to him. He was still fully dressed, and his coat still felt cold from the outside air. Sherlock wrapped him in his arms: not a hug. Sherlock had him immobilised. John squirmed, just to feel Sherlock's arms close more firmly about him.
Since he became Sherlock's toy, one of the things that had changed was foodtime. Sherlock had made a rule that John could only eat if Sherlock pushed the food into his mouth. Like all their rules, this was one John cheerfully broke all of the time when he was anywhere but 221b Baker Street.
Mycroft wanted to tell Sherlock about his Trust, of which Mycroft was the active trustee. Sherlock listened to him for a measured twenty minutes, which was how long it took for one of the club servants to bring the after-dinner coffee, then pointed out that Mycroft could have told him all that in an email, drank the coffee black - it was a dark, richly-addictive brew, and Mycroft always added cream - and left.
Sherlock was pacing up and down 221b Baker Street muttering angrily to himself. He hadn't taken his coat off. He hadn't stopped pacing and muttering since they came back from the house in Stoke Newington where three people lay dead: two stabbed and one with a broken neck. They had died twelve hours apart but all lay in the same room. It looked as if the one with the broken neck had stabbed one of the victims, but it also looked as if the one with the broken neck had been the first to die.
John lifted his chin, consciously taking a deep breath. That wasn't going to happen. He'd committed to doing this at least once, he wasn't going to wriggle out of it just because it wasn't quite like he'd thought. "Mycroft," he said.
"He was startled," Sherlock said. "He's not an exhibitionist. I had assured him you were out of London til tomorrow. He was angry with me and terminated the scene. I sent him home in a taxi." Sherlock's phone beeped. He pulled it out of his pocket and looked at the screen. "He's home."
John nodded. Sherlock said this frequently. Much more frequently, John noticed, than he actually disappeared to use other people. As John had thought, the sheer convenience of having John to use meant Sherlock used John.
Over the next few months, Sherlock asked John what his safeword was five times.  Once, when John was planning to go out on a date with Penelope, he said no, and the other four times he said yes.
John had assumed Sherlock was some variety of asexual. Or celibate. He didn't do relationships. John had got the impression he didn't do sex. John rubbed his face, trying to cure the blush and the tendency to gape. Well, he'd been wrong about that.
Sherlock moved round to stand in front of him. John could see the mouthwatering bulge in Sherlock's trousers, and if he squinted up, Sherlock's face from below, like being a dog.
Sherlock used his own credit card. He had nearly always one stolen from Mycroft in his wallet, but he didn't feel like discussing this purchase with Mycroft.
the hotel last month, had to text him to let him know I'd be late, and then he sent me a very peevish email informing me he'd waited all night and he was blocking me everywhere."
“Oh Sherlock,” she started, passing him an envelope she had neatly tucked away in her cardigan pocket, “this came through the post for you today. Does someone have an admirer?”.
John realised the moment Sherlock left his class without a word of goodbye that he had upset the boy, more than that John knew he must have really hurt him. John cursed himself, he should never have let Helen’s comments unnerve him, he should’ve made an effort to apologise to Sherlock before the class had ended. Of course John had not wanted to cross a line with Sherlock, but he most definitely did not want to lose him. John realised that he’d have to do an awful lot to make it up to Sherlock, but he’d be damned if he let that boy slip away from him.
And whilst Sherlock may not yet have noticed John’s growing attraction, someone else had. Although John was oblivious to the fact that his colleague, Helen Jones, was starting to grow suspicious of his relationship with Sherlock.
Sherlock nibbled a chip, “Honestly John, it’s beautiful. I was always attracted to the prospect of moving to a big city but I didn’t think I would be this taken in. I can see why you liked it so much.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to blush. Not because he was ashamed (‘a Holmes is many things, but ashamed is never one of them’ his brother frequently told him), but because John had been able to deduce something that Sherlock had not seen in John himself.
After giving a small tip to the café owner, the pair set off in the direction of the Mansion House Station, which would take them back to the science museum. They had a little time to spare when they stepped off at the South Kensington Station and, in taking the scenic route back, John decided he would use this time to ask Sherlock a little more about himself.
Sherlock bit his lip and tensed up slightly. Maybe it was best to leave the subject alone; he had once written a report into what topics of conversation people reacted the worst to and had concluded that ex partners were at the top of the list.
"I am honored, thank you John." Sherlock replied, hesitating when he realized he had used his teacher first name.
"Although," Sherlock began again "I will admit my overlooking of your break up was quite shameful, all the signs were there. There was shaving foam behind your left ear. Nobody had pointed it out to you, traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own; there was no-one to tell you. Also, you're new to teaching. Most first-timers tend to teach at a local school to where they previously studied, there is only one university near here and you did not attend it. If you had you would have known exactly who Charlie Magnussen is – as he likes to remind everyone, his dad is the Superintendent at the Baker Street Police Department, and governor of the school. So, new to the area, resulting from a conscious move, and currently living alone, it's not a big leap."
John shot Sherlock a look that said Sherlock-you-are-brilliant-but-please-be-aware-that-we-are-in-a-live-court-trial-and-you-cannot-shout-out. This was followed by one of the court bailiffs giving Sherlock a much shorter shut-the-hell-up look. The pair decided to leave as the courtroom adjourned for lunch. Both keen to see just a little more of London before they departed home.
John was thankful for Helen’s discretion but really did not want to be having this conversation. “I see where you’re coming from Helen and I appreciate your concern, but honestly I think I have the situation under control. Really though, I don’t think it is anything more than silly infatuation.”
“Okay, I know a few places I think you’d be interested in.” said John. “Oh and I think it might be a good idea for you to take my phone number, in case of emergencies.”
Sherlock zoned out, there was something about the new teacher that intrigued him. Mr. Watson was the sort of teacher that could hold the attention of a class effortlessly. One who could flash a smile that melted the hearts of any, and every, female student and yet he seemed oblivious to his charm. He carried himself with a modest dignity; something Sherlock saw rarely walking the halls of Baker Street Comprehensive. However, what struck Sherlock the most was that his new teacher actually acknowledged him. During his time at BSC, the vast majority of teachers tended to ignore, or even actively avoid, him. Especially after the time that he deduced, quite correctly, that his English teacher, Mr. Lestrade, was being cheated on by his wife with another teacher at the school. This was not atypical of Sherlock’s schooling experience. It wasn't that anyone one said anything to his face, well apart from Magnussen and his gang, it was just that if they passed him in the corridor students, and teacher alike, tended to give him a wide berth. And of course, being the younger brother of Mycroft Holmes meant that his name already carried a reputation. He was lucky he even had Molly.
After an hour or so of playing around with the equipment in the room, John decided that he’d take Sherlock for a quick bite to eat before they had to head back to the science museum to catch the train home. Luckily enough there was a small café right around the corner, just a short distance from the station they needed to head towards to catch the tube back to the museum. The pair chose a table by the window so that they could watch the passers-by. After a quick check of his watch John noted that he and Sherlock had just under an hour before they needed to set off, he concluded that this was just enough time to grab some food and quiz Sherlock a little. John ordered a bacon sandwich and a tea whilst Sherlock stuck to a black coffee, however at John’s instance added a small bowl of chips. Seeing as they were the only two in the café, not counting a little old lady tucked away in the back corner, their order came out quickly.
Sherlock stands in the middle of the room, still fully dressed. His shirt sleeves are rolled up, leaving his forearms exposed. John briefly thinks he's made the totally wrong assumption, until Sherlock steps up to him, bows his head, brings his hands up to either side of John's face and slowly brushes his lips against John's.
"You're going to take that severed hand in the fridge back to Barts before I do any more shopping for food."
The shopping bag on the floor had a couple of pints of milk that ought to go in the fridge, and a loaf of bread. And besides, he really couldn't stay in his room for the rest of his life.
Sherlock was in his bedroom before John could manage to get to his feet. He staggered a bit as he went to the staircase to his room. He was hugely, almost scarily, turned on.
"I've never made an exclusive arrangement," Sherlock said. "Obviously we use condoms for anal sex and I have no interest in anything riskier. I'm regularly tested. I require the men to get regularly tested, too. I don't insist on condoms for oral sex if the man prefers otherwise, but I don't regard that as a major risk to myself, and I wouldn't have penetrative sex unless I was clean. I do enjoy filling a man's mouth with spunk and watching him struggle to swallow. What do you feel about that, John?"
Both teachers knew that the conversation was about more than a few girls crushing on John, but luckily for John, Helen was taking a very professional approach to the matter.
The train finally pulled into the station and, as planned, Sherlock and John exited from different carriages. John headed straight for the taxi rank, having left his car at home. Sherlock walked the opposite way toward the drop off zone. Mycroft was parked, waiting.
“Sherlock we’re here for your birthday, let me pay.” John argued as the waitress went to get the card machine.
"Of course," John insisted. "Come by tomorrow if you like, and seeing as I've taken up your entire lunch, you're welcome to bring food."
John could tell that Sherlock was hurt by his dismissive reply, it actually pained him a little to see the boy so disheartened. He did not like having to give Sherlock the cold shoulder, but he had promised himself that he would not compromise his position as a teacher – not until Sherlock was not long a pupil of his at least. He just wished he knew how to tell Sherlock that his withdrawal was not a genuine attempt to distance each other.
"So, all excitement out of the way, time to learn about the nervous system." John said as he gave out the last slip, chuckling as a unanimous groan sounded through the class.
"Good." John said, moving his hand to pat Sherlock on the back. "Now, I'll let you get off and have the last few minutes of lunch to yourself, and I will see you tomorrow, last period."
Sherlock soften, he knew that John was lying but his friend had gone to the effort of trying to reassure him and so he felt compelled to play his part equally.
“John. Not that I am not thoroughly enjoying holding hands, but you’ve been staring at me for the last two minutes in silence. Oh, and I do believe we have a train to catch.” Sherlock smirked as he watched John snap out of his thoughts.
This was easier said than done however, as Sherlock’s mother had what could only be described as a profound passion for Christmas festivities. To both Sherlock and Mycroft’s misfortune this meant that over the holidays, the pair were asked, or rather politely forced, to join their mother in an array of Christmas activities. But that day had run a little differently, as with only a two days left till Christmas day, Violet Holmes thought it a good idea to give her sons the morning off to head into town to do their own Christmas shopping. Although not overjoyed by the idea of going shopping, Sherlock usually left it up to Mycroft to purchase their parents gifts, it did feel good to get some air and clear his head a little. Never one to drag out a task, Mycroft had efficiently managed to complete both Holmes brothers’ shopping in under an hour, leaving them an hour or so to spare before their mother wanted them home. Sherlock and Mycroft’s aunt and uncle were coming over for dinner on Christmas day and so they were expected to help prepare the house. The brothers decided to just go somewhere they could grab a coffee and sit down for a while before they were required to socialise. In a rather rare moment of brotherly affection Mycroft questioned Sherlock on his recent unhappy behaviour.
