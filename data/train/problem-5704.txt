Tony fired both repulsors at him. He got knocked into a wall, groaning in pain on impact. Tony was ready to end his pathetic life in a heartbeat. This was the man that ruined his entire marriage, his life and caused him so much pain by forcing the man he loved to hurt him. “Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t kill you right now for ruining my life.” He gritted his teeth, pressing a foot firmly onto his ribs.
One week later & here is Chapter 5..
“Why him?” Peter couldn’t understand where Amelia’s father came into this equation.
“I do. I was wrong and completely out of line for doing that.” He countered, taking a step towards him and Bucky put out his left arm to keep Sam at arms-length. “I’ll do whatever it takes for you to forgive me.” Sam provided.
“We are getting too old for that.”
Tony met his eyes. “Because I want to be with you. Because you make me happy. Because I do love you, Stephen.” He swore, he did but he loved Steve more.
“Are you alone?” Stephen questioned because he was getting just as aroused as Tony was and he wouldn’t mind doing it right here before they left for their date. But the sound of Maria and Peter’s voice informed Stephen and reminded Tony that they most certainly were not alone. And then Stephen wanted to at least greet his mother, but Tony stopped him.
floor of Stark Mansion. They were roughly about the same height. “Let’s chat outside.” Wade looked back at Peter and gave him a thumbs up.
Harley narrowed his eyes. “But he’s still my little brother.” Less he forgot that part. “So, don’t think for a second that I’m okay with this. And I’m sure once my parents get down from their
Silence followed as Bucky considered letting Sam come home. “Just don’t –”
- Tony and Stephen broke up; Tony and Steve kissed and are getting back together
“Yeah. But not for another two and a half weeks.” Tony provided. At that, Steve got up and found his phone, walking past Tony as he got a glimpse of his nakedness under the robe and easily distracting him. “What are you doing, babe?” He asked, refraining from touching himself, by biting his lower lip but Steve noticed.
Tony’s heart dropped. His hands were still shaking. What happened to Morgan in the few hours he’d last seen her? And her baby? Was her baby okay?
Also I'm wishing a Happy New Year to everyone since it's my first upload for the year! 🎉🎉🎉 Wishing nothing but good for everyone 😘
he sighed.
“After hearing both sides and going over all the evidence and footage and testimonies, I here by grant full custody of Nicholas James Rogers to...”
“We’re pregnant,” Nathan finally said. And the mind-numbing silence prolonged even more. Nathan and Morgan watched them, awaiting their reaction or response or something because it was way too calm. Where was the screaming and shouting about how stupid she was and how could they be so careless and every other stereotypical thing parents of pregnant teenagers said?
“I know that mom. That’s not what I’m trying to do. And I’m sorry if I made you and Calvin feel that way.” She had been busy and distracted with working with her father and very much enjoyed it. She couldn’t tell her mother that though. “But Jacob and I did grow apart. We had for a while and I was the one brave enough to finally end things.”
“How long have you known?” Peter asked in disbelief because now he was laughing.
“Does that mean you want to try?” He whispered. “Or if you need time, you know I’ll wait for you Tones.” For as long as it would take. There was no way he was giving up now.

Harley and Morgan were left gawking at Peter and then at each other. They would have never guessed that. Apparently, they’d been very careful and extremely good at hiding the relationship. Harley ended up speaking first. “Wow. Okay.” He was still having a hard time hearing that. There was, after all, an enormous age gap between those two. “So, she knows something because of Remy.”
“It’s James' idea.” Carol began. “I just don’t understand why we need to share our problems with a complete stranger.”
“You know I love laying with you Nertha but I made plans with Jacob already.” He took her hand from his other cheek and kissed it, flashing a smile. “Maybe later.”
She explained the vastness of her powers.
Steve watched Wade with Peter again and Loki’s words kept ringing in his ears.
Sif squeezed her daughters’ hands and Torunn smiled at her. “How are you feeling, my sweet?”
“Thor. You really can’t keep doing this.” He gestured to the floor, making a mental note to get someone to fix that in the next few days.
She didn’t respond to him. Instead she directed her words to Tony. “Tony…” she paused. Tony looked at her expectantly. Steve pleaded with his eyes, begging her not to say anything. His efforts were futile. “I’m so sorry…we kind of...” she trailed off and Tony was getting a little concerned.
“I suppose I can’t make anyone truly love me.”
Steve tried to apologize. Tony glanced at Nat who had gone quiet on them. “So what is it? Are you two in love?” Because Tony couldn’t conjure up any other reason as to why they would do that to him. “How long has this been going on?”
“Stephen?” Tony whispered, his eyes widen, and he let out a silent gasp. “What-what–” he struggled with his words. “What are you doing here?”
Tony had arranged a day for his female friends to hang out while Gamora offered to host it. It was a good way for her friends to see the new place she shared with Quill. Nebula had stopped by earlier before heading back into space with the rest of the guardians while Pepper, Carol, Hope, Wanda and Nat managed to make an appearance and stayed for the duration of the “girls’ day”.
“Well, she asked me about SHIELD the day before Hammer died. That can’t be a coincidence.” Morgan explained, looking over at her brothers for support.
“I won’t tell if you don’t.” Wade sang, getting into the driver’s seat. Peter took his seat as well. They could leave it at that. No one had to know.
all the time.” Peter started. Wade probably knew everything, really. “You know my name, my family, and my friends. You know what I look like”. He got a nod with each statement he made and even though he couldn’t see his face, Peter knew he was pretty damn pleased with himself. “I think it’s only fair you tell me about you or at least take off your mask.”
“I know. I’ve been too busy but I’ll definitely come see you more now that you’re living at the mansion.” She was happy to hear that and only noticed in that moment that there was someone next to Steve.
sex wasn’t going to hurt the baby.
TAGS, WARNINGS and RELATIONSHIP TAGS may be refering to the Past, Present or Both! They might be only mentioned, done in real time OR both. I'll also be adding more tags as I go along...
“You sound crazy.” Anna fired back. It was by far the most ridiculous allegations she’d ever heard, and she couldn’t understand where these thoughts of hers where coming from.
Steve spoke up once they were alone. “Tony?” He couldn’t understand why Tony would suddenly have a change of heart. He thought they were on the same page.
“It wasn’t easy guys.” Steve confessed. “I’m still figuring some things out.” Vision was surprised to hear that. “But if you two feel you’re ready. Who am I to stop you?”
“Well...we haven’t decided.” Nathan supplied, because Morgan was still too choked up to talk. The room grew quiet again. “We just found out last night. We don’t know…” He trailed off. Their parents were all collectively sharing a look.
“He does deserve to know though.” Tony was still staring at Steve, as he finally pulled him into an embrace. They shared a concerned look as both caressed Tony’s bump.
“I’d love to. I used to do it a lot back at the school.”
“I’m fine.” He assured them, jerking back and away from Steve. “Please just leave me alone.” He whispered.
Tony gasped. “I’m gonna cum Steve.” He wouldn’t be able to hold off for too long after coming once already in the last few minutes.
“Mom hosts a Christmas party every year for family and friends.” Peter informed her. They stood on the side lines as workers were busy moving things around and hanging decorations; Tony and Pepper amid all the madness. “Aunt Pepper is an essential part of course.”
“Someone’s happy,” Steve commented. He was pleased to know Tony was fully satisfied. Tony was about to respond when his eyes flew open and Steve heard him gasp.

“Poor Dad.” Harley sympathized. He was never getting rid of Wade now.
“How long?” Sam was asking, how long would it take for Bucky to forgive him? How long would he have to stay away from their home?
Steve chuckled, letting his laughter flow through him. Tony had his arms extended. He needed another hug. They both needed another hug. Steve took him up on the offer as he drew himself closer again, allowing Tony to envelope him in the hug.
“You mean a double date plus Peter.”
“So you’re stuck with us,” Sam explained and Steve couldn’t agree more.
But, “You pulled out,” she shot back, pointing a finger at him.
“Yeah. I got my mom’s name. She had me before she even met Misha and my real father had already passed.” Jaime explained, as if that was common knowledge. Morgan listened intently. She hadn’t even known Misha Kozlov wasn’t Jaime’s biological father. Did Nathan know this? She glanced at her boyfriend, who had Binx in his arms at that moment and distractingly petting her fur. At least she was aware, Jaime was short for James, but everyone called him Jaime similar to how no one called her mother Anthony. It was always simply, Tony.
Since the night of the incident, Nathan hadn’t left Stark Mansion. He was there as Morgan went through her grief. Right now, Maria was staying with Morgan. Nathan had left her side unwillingly to take care of his basic needs per Maria’s requests. Peter and Torunn were in school and Steve and Tony were somewhere else in the building, no doubt close by.
“I know.” He responded smugly and Steve dove his tongue deeper into the tightness of his wet hole, breaking Tony’s smug expression. Licking his walls and feeling the muscles clench around him, Steve was rewarded with a moan from Tony. Steve then removed his tongue, kissing the hole once more before, moving on to the base of Tony's cock next and then the C-section scar under his belly's pudge. The trail of kisses then advanced to the faint stretch marks on his belly – proof of the four children Tony had given him.
“I can’t make it to the project launch tomorrow. I’m sorry.” Their long-awaited project was finally being put in effective tomorrow.
“Okay.” Wade grunted out, feeling the squeeze of Peter’s walls around him. He could deal with that because he never wanted to stop either.
Maria Stark let out a little cough. Morgan and Anna turned to their grandmother and snickers travelled across the table. “What am I? Chopped liver?”
“And after that?” Morgan wondered. What were they going to do? Did they want a baby right now? “Do we want a baby?” she asked aloud.
“Only for you.” Steve promised. He settled between his thighs, shoving two fingers into Tony’s mouth for him to get wet before he put them in his hole, curling them as he did. Tony moaned, his eyes rolling back in his head. He reached a hand out to grab Steve and stroke his length. Steve whimpered at the contact. If Tony kept this up, he was going to cum too soon. In a matter of seconds, Steve replaced his fingers with his cock and sunk painfully slow and deep into the warm, wet clenching hole. Tony’s eyes opened to meet his. It was so intoxicating and sweet and tight, that every time he got a taste, every time he was inside him, he wanted nothing more than to let it all go. But Tony gripped his cock and Steve couldn’t move. He wasn’t certain if he was doing it unknowingly or intentionally.
"How old were you?"
“Do tell, Doctor.”
Wade stopped his food prep and glanced up at Peter. “Doesn’t it take a while for it to actually work?”
“My guess: He’s involved with Hammer’s murder.” Morgan finished.
At school, Morgan met up with her friends, Torunn and Amelia. Torunn was the crowned princess and heir of Asgard. She was as beautiful as her mother and as blonde as her father. Thor, against Sif’s wishes, allowed her to attend school in New York so she could experience all the things and long-lasting friendships he forged. He believed it was essential for the future Queen’s betterment. Tony welcomed her with open arms as she stayed at the Stark Mansion with the Stark-Rogers family.
He decided to call Pepper, being her best friend, she might know where she was. That was a dead end but as long a she had her on the phone he shared the events of the previous night with her. When Pepper was all caught up she let Rhodey know what she thought.
"Your father calls you Harls. I figured -"
“I know that now. I just wish I’d known before.” They hugged again and Steve could faintly make out Tony’s next words, uttered under his breath. “I love you too.” He had said. He had never stopped.
“This is news to me.” Amelia said, turning to Michelle. Then Amelia was kissing her on the lips, slipping her tongue in. The other girls stared in confusion for a minute. “So does that do something for you?” Amelia questioned when she pulled away.
“In the lab?” Harley would never had guess that. “Are you sure?”
He did find Maria in the kitchen but was surprised to see Wade Wilson seated on one of the barstools. He instinctively did a double take, wondering if he was just seeing things after being surrounded by continuous magic for the past two months. But no, Wade was actually there, eating his grandmother’s cooking with not a single care in the world.
“Not the second time,” he countered. Okay, so maybe they hadn’t used a condom the second time.
“Baby. I’m serious.” He spoke, wholeheartedly, sitting up as well. He didn’t know if his little bit about Steve was true or not. He was irritated and annoyed at the fact that Steve was always mentioned whenever they had a conversation. He couldn’t get rid of him apparently.
“Do what?” he asked, clearly confused.
She helped Harley up and led him out of her room to find their mother. “Come on. I’m sure Mom would love to take a crack at this.” Her kitten ran after them.
.” Steve sighed, trying to lower his anger. His eyes watered because even in this moment of life or death where Tony’s life was on the line, Stephen Strange hadn’t failed to remind him that Tony was his in every sense of the word. Tony was only his to worry about. Apparently.
“T’challa’s pretty friendly with Bucky, isn’t he?” Sam started, folding his arms over his chest. His eyes stayed on T’challa and Bucky in a gathering of people on the other side of the room. Nakia, Okoye and an array of mutant teachers from Xavier’s School were a part of that gathering.
“You look so happy.” Pepper noted, handing him a salad. Tony took it happily, while they sat on her sofa. “You might even be glowing.”
“Sure, you didn’t.” Maria spoke to Anna next. “I’m happy to have my other granddaughter back.” Anna expressed her appreciation. “Maybe you could help me garden sometime, Anna?”
Gamora and Sif followed with laughter. “Do you and Scott intend to have more of your own one day?” Sif wondered.
Wade then, pulled out a bit and slammed back into him. Peter became a frenzy of moans and whimpers and a few sobs, but it was clear how much he was enjoying it all. So much that minutes later, he used his super strength to flip themselves over, putting Peter on top, still impaled by Wade’s member. He started grinding, trying to find a rhythm that worked for them both and once they’d found it, Wade moved his hips to move in sync with Peter.
“Yeah.” Steve answered, kissing Tony’s cheek. “We’re moving forward.” In every sense of the word and Steve could not tear his eyes away from the man he loved now and always, the mother of his children.
and the expected,
“Why does it feel like we just put down newborns and this is our only moment of peace?” Steve had went on. The notion made Tony chuckle.
Steve had joined the Super Soldier program – funded and created by Stark Industries and he easily became the subject of the lab experiment after passing all the test. Howard Stark, who was CEO at the time oversaw the whole thing along with Margret “Peggy” Carter before he died, the year before in 1991. Peggy led the program there after. At 16, Steve had been injected with the Super Soldier Serum and to say it worked, was an understatement. They wanted a hero and that’s exactly what they got. They deemed him Captain America but that was almost 8 years ago.
“I don’t know Sam.” Bucky said, irritation laced in his voice. “For as long as my heart stops hurting for not being trusted.”
Michelle tried to hide her smile, replacing it with her usual blank stare. She waved Amelia off. “No. I’m not attracted to my friends.”
Also, I would love to hear your thoughts about the Hammer investigation.
Stephen could think of a couple reasons, so he began listing them off in his drugged state. “We’ve been together for months,” Stephen whispered. “And you still haven’t told me you love me…”
“I went to see my lawyer. I’m trying to get a day with Ellie. I want to be in her life.” He confessed. Peter knew the unfortunate situation Wade was in with his daughter, Eleanor. Her mother made it hard for him to be in Ellie’s life. She said Wade was too dangerous, too destructive. It was bad for Ellie; which Peter could understand but had to go against. Wade was harmless when it came to him. He had no doubt he would be just the same or even more protective when it came to his daughter. Carmelita Camacho had no trust or faith in Wade and so as of right now, she had full custody of Ellie.
“So, like are you in need of a daddy?” he wiggled his eyebrows, suggestively. Peter shook that thought away, laughing at his suggestion.
Anna then, grasped one of her hands with her bare one and Morgan screamed out in pain from the contact. Anna retreated seconds later, and Morgan stared at her completely mortified. “Anna? What the actual fuck?”
It didn’t take long for Tony to find what it was and once he identified it as a tiny piece of tech, he took it down to his lab for Friday to exam.  Tony and Rhodey watched and listened intently as Friday’s voice poured out of the speakers above them. “It seems to be a micro-camera and it’s live streaming sir.”
After Steve healed everything went back to normal. Steve moved in fully with Sam and Bucky. Steve went to his pregnant mothers group meetings. Steve went to his doctor’s appointments. SJ was doing great and most importantly he wasn't seeing Tony in his dreams anymore.
“Definitely better than Strange.” Morgan agreed. Steve grinned at her. “I’m always on your side Dad.” That he was always sure of. He hugged his little girl tighter.
.” He countered. What place did he have sleeping with a Princess? She should be saving herself for her future husband.
“I wouldn’t put it pass her. Let’s not forget she’s a little off…” Pepper reminded him. She was right. Sharon Carter had always been a little on the crazier side. But she was also sleeping with Steve so her being pregnant wasn’t far-fetched. “I say if you haven’t heard it from Steve, don’t believe anything.”
“Does Dad know?”
“What’s wrong?” he wondered. Peter’s hands were cupping his face and Wade played with the ‘W’ charm on the necklace around his neck. Peter never took it off.
He had forgotten.
Nat was with Clint ordering drinks at the bar. Sam had already drunk a few glasses when he found them, but he was far from intoxicated.
“I can’t believe she’d do that.”
“Asgard will have a prince!” he exclaimed, toasting with Bruce but never forgetting how his brother renounced his title and only used it when it benefited him. That was Loki for you. He was not Odin’s son but Frigga loved him like she birthed him herself and he was Thor’s brother. And Thor wondered where he was in this moment. Was he on Sakaar again? Did he even intend to show up to party?
Morgan let out an audible gasp. “Oh no, we have to get you on social media right now. At least one.” She proposed, getting up to sit closer to Jaime and pluck his phone from out his hands. Jaime looked over at his cousin in surprise. Nathan nodded as if saying,
Steve took his seat by him again, looking him in the eyes. “What do
“He is,” Sif responded simply. She liked to keep conversation short with Carol because things always tended to blow up between them.
He stops fighting. His arms are falling from Tony’s hands and going limp at his sides. It’s happening. Everything is getting fuzzy. He’s seeing dark spots. He’s letting go.
“And you weren't?” Stephen rebutted, glaring daggers at him.
Thank you again so much for all who read, comment, left kudos and supported my work. Just thank you.
“Stopping by?” Morgan repeated, suspiciously. “Right.” She narrowed her eyes and smirked at her father.
Nights at Wade’s place was something Peter knew his parents weren’t aware of. He feared his father would catch on sooner than his mother would, and he knew no good would come from that. And even if Tony did find out first, he could only extend his favour of trust in his son to so much and no more; the same trust he was already going back on, slowly but surely.
Torunn woke and couldn’t find Harley. He came home a few days ago. His finals were over, and he was on summer break. Harley was still trying to figure out school for himself after he and Torunn get married. If he was going to be living on Asgard how could he possibly attend school?
“Except Torunn. She reeks of goodness.” She teased, turning her nose up at the sight of her cousin and walking towards the windows.
“And Remy helped.” Morgan insisted, which only solidified Harley’s thoughts.
“Only for a time.” Thor clarified, taking Sif’s hand, stormbreaker still in the other and led them towards the Mansion.
he told himself.
Tony instructed Stephen to mingle, promising to introduce him to his mother and his closest friends later on for he still had to entertain guests as the host. Stephen decided to linger by the bar afterwards, watching Tony go from guest to guest. He sipped his drink before he heard a voice speak his name. He put his drink down and gave the slightest smirk when he found the source of the voice. Steve Rogers was glaring at him.
“I’m not. I just.” Carl paused. Jacob awaited her response. “It’s hard to explain. But I love your dad. We love each other and we’re working it out, so I’ve been at your Aunt Pepper’s for a while but we’re okay.” She said the last part with so much sincerity, Jacob wondered who she was really trying to convince; him or herself?
Stephen was on a screen projected from Tony’s phone, before him. “You want me to come over?”
“I should hope not. I’ll find her and speak with her afterwards.” Thor concluded, motioning for everyone to continue with their meals.
Tony scoffed and watched him leave. “20 minutes.” He repeated.
“Then he’s fine.” Tony concluded, walking away from Peter.
Jacob countered, in all seriousness. “I was hoping I could take you out first.” Her smirk disappeared and was replaced with an expression of pure confusion. “Like a date.” He explained further.
Steve sighed. "You're threatening me?" He asked, though Harley didn't receive it as a question.
“You mortals are quite peculiar.” Torunn remarked. More confusion spread across the room. “And what of you Morgan?” she went back to the topic at hand. “Things are still good with Nathan?”
“What else could you have thought in that situation?” Steve inched closer to him. “You had every right to.” He’d cheated though it wasn’t by his own will, he’d still done it.
Pepper understood. They talked about you-know-who a lot. “As much as I wish they weren’t, they are.” She sympathized with Carol. She tried to omit the name from the list every year but Tony wasn’t having it. “Tony wouldn’t be happy if they weren’t invited.”
“I could ask Amelia if she knows anything. She’s close with her father.” Morgan just didn’t think Aunt Nat would cheat willingly. It must have been something else.
Tony spoke next. “I love you honey.” He kissed Harley’s cheek, and glanced over at Torunn. “Both of you.” He stated, reaching out to hold each of their hands. He looked away for a moment, trying to blink away tears. That was another child he was losing. He sniffled a bit and Steve rubbed his arm soothingly.
Remy remembered those conversations but he'd never seen Natasha before. He was always very appreciative of the information Amelia provided him with about her extended family; all voluntarily. There was no need for the use of his powers.
Dr McIntosh found the baby just as easily as last time, and Steve and Tony watched in awe at the sight of the baby. Tony was supposed to be 11 weeks along today.
“Steeb. Don’t you get tired of sketching me?” He quipped, advancing towards their bed. It caused Steve to discard his sketching tools and let Tony tackle him.
“Oh.” Sam whispered, he poured himself a glass of wine as well. He kissed Bucky’s cheek, whispering something in his ear that made him blush before he sat across from Steve. “But hey. Isn’t it your baby shower today?”
Peter held his head in his hand. All this new information was giving him a headache. How could his parents hide these things from him? If he hadn’t asked would they had said anything? And how would he know what to ask anyways? It made him wonder, what else were they hiding?
“Thank you, Tony – Mom –” She didn’t know what to say. Both were foreign to her.
“I wish you’d have called first.” Tony lectured. Steve gave him an apologetic smile. As if he hadn’t gone out of his way to buy food and make his way over there on account of Harley’s text earlier, in hopes of…what, exactly? Stopping Tony from going on his date?
Steve did feel as if he owed Sharon some sort of apology. He hadn’t been fair to Sharon even though she did trick and use him. He was starting to think he deserved it; his karma in the end. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. He needed to focus on Tony right now.
Pepper was too. Amelia’s powers were dormant for 18 years and Calvin had none to display as far as she knew. She glanced over at Nat, noticing her silence. It wasn’t fair for them to discuss something she couldn’t weigh in on, so she was appreciative of Gamora when the subject was changed.
Tony realized that he knew more than he was claiming to, but he wasn’t ready to have this conversation yet. “Stephen, I want to be alone right now.” Tony said firmly. Stephen then marvelled at how well he deflected and never answered the question.
The laughter ceased however when Pietro Maximoff walked into the room with Cassie on his arm. Scott wasn’t the happiest about this relationship given the age difference, but Pietro had a good heart and Cassie was a sensible girl – young woman, now 18. Both legal adults, they knew what they were doing. Scott just didn’t like losing his little peanut.
Friday took a minute to figure it out. The screens projected around him flashed many computer codes before it settled on a company logo. “It’s Hammer Tech Sir.”
“Really? Are you okay?” Steve had to ask. He was supposedly happy just a few days ago. He didn’t know things would change so quickly for them. Steve was actually surprised Stephen gave him up, when he would stake his claim on Tony so often.
“I’m sorry. Why would you think I cheated?” Jacob heard Carol’s voice raise a bit.
She’d slept over plenty of times before. Nat and Bruce didn’t think anything of it and neither did her parents. They knew they could trust them. They were smart kids and Morgan especially, knew better.
Steve is pretty loud and Tony has to silence him because Pepper and Morgan are only a thin wooden wall away. His loving wife and gorgeous little girl are a wall away. His family is a wall away. So he’s going to need Steve to calm down.
Finally! 😊
Today was her new baby brother’s presentation day. As the name suggested, the little Prince was to be presented to the people of Asgard. The people were overzealous to get even the slightest glimpse of their Prince. The members of the royal family gathered in the inner room that led to the palace’s grand balcony. Torunn, Loki, Hela and Nertha were awaiting Thor and Sif’s arrival with the baby. Torunn was briefing her family on the scandalous revelation that had surfaced at Tony’s Mother’s Day Brunch, the month prior. Loki sat with Torunn on a sofa, Hela stood by the window looking out at the screaming people and Nertha sat on the armrest of the sofa.
She was covering her mouth, trying to hide a smile when Amelia looked her way again. “Ew.” Amelia finished, making to change the topic immediately.
“And don’t worry about my family. It may take some time for them to warm up to you. They’re just not use to me being with someone that’s not Steve.”
“Last week.” He answered way too quickly. “I took the kids to go see my mom. We all helped her out with her garden and –” Tony rambled on until, she interrupted.
“How could you tell?” Harley worried, wondering if it was that obvious. Jacob gestured to his hands still adjusting his bow tie. Harley sighed, dropping his hands to his side and he heard Jacob chuckle before rising from his seat and joining him at the full-length mirror. He rested a hand on his shoulder.
Carol had to agree. “Jacob almost destroyed our home when he first discovered his powers.” It was a difficult task up until this point in his life for her son to stabilize his powers. She longed for the day he would.
- Has a few house visits and a coronation
“Don’t get angry at me.” Anna responded in a serious voice and her eyes glistened with amusement.
She pulled her drink away from her lips and spoke up. “Sam, if Winter was T’challa’s daughter why would Bucky agree to a future engagement for her with T’challa’s son?”
“Tony and I are getting a divorce.”
“We’re not dating, Morgan” he explained sadly, “So please stop going all ‘mom’ on me. I’ll tell you when I’m ready. Can you respect my privacy until then?”
“I don’t mind. He’d eat all the food before anyone else got a share.” Peter confessed.
Wanda looked around at all the women who had pregnant at least once before. “Really?” They all seemed to agree except for Nat – who as expected – stayed silent on the matter.
"What does your father really do?" He asked, squeezing Peter's hand.
He had a towel around his naked form and another drying his shoulder-length hair as he stood before the full-length mirror. Sam saw him and advanced behind him. Bucky stood up straight, not knowing what Sam was planning to do. Then he unravelled the towel around his body and let it fall at their feet.
Tony looked and sounded grouchy as his eyes focused on Steve. He sat up, rubbing the left side of his belly. “Baby. What happened?” There was worry and concern laced in his voice. He’d called and texted Steve so many times last night. He promised he’d be back earlier, and Morgan was waiting for him.
Morgan shrugged. “I don’t see why not.” She was making sure Binx had enough water in her bowl.
“None of that.” T’challa pleaded before he focused his attention on Winter, who was partially hiding behind Bucky’s leg.
“So that means we turn our backs on our little girl?” Steve wanted to know, narrowing his eyes at Tony. “She already feels so bad about it. She needs our support.”
Steve looked almost flabbergasted, eyes widened and he grabbed Tony’s arm. “Tony. Keep your voice down. Your mother and Peggy are in the next room.”
“Mhm.” Remy answered and they kissed, before he spoke again. “Move in with me, ‘chere.” He asked of her. If she lived with him, they could spend all their time together.
The four of them were walking away when Nicky looked over his mother’s shoulder and shouted, “Bye Tony.” Yeah. Nicky didn’t need him in his life. He had 3 loving, capable parents already.
“Honestly. My AI Karen got me all the dirt on you. There wasn’t much though. Just that you’re a hired assassin.”
“I’ve been waiting over a year from this Wade. I don’t want to wait any longer.”
“Okay boyfriend.” Peter tested the word out.
“You’re lying.”
Friday had already pinpointed Justin’s exact location in the building even though it was invisible to the naked eye. Tony waltzed closer towards the source. “What can I say, Justin? You were never a priority of mine.” He responded smugly.
Harley interrupted him and spoke his next words harshly. "But you're not my father. I don't care if you marry him. You don't get to call me that. If anything, since I don't even know you, you should be calling me Mr Stark."
Steve thought of doing the same too. He went to wash up and headed to Harley’s room to drag him out of bed prior to sending Sharon a Merry Christmas text. He’d give her that much.
“I’m sorry for hiding that from you.” He couldn’t apologize enough.
“What are you high on Steve Rogers?” Tony got up and straddled him.
“Yeah. I’ve always kind of wanted more kids,” Carol mused. “And this way, I don’t have to carry them and go through the stresses of pregnancy.”
“Rhodey doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” Tony supplied. He would never let her feel like she was wrong. “I’ll tell you all about it tomorrow when I come to get you.” Tomorrow, he was moving her into Stark Mansion. She would have her own wing and more people on her staff to care for her.
Maria turned the chair around, so Morgan was facing her. “I know honey. I promise you though, it gets better.” Morgan didn’t know how it could ever get better. When would the pain go away? When would she stop feeling guilty? When would she stop blaming herself for losing the baby? She and Nathan hadn’t even decided what they wanted to do. Maybe that was their karma. They took too long to decide, and the universe took their blessing away.
He was their love-child after all, made after a night of love-making following their reconciliation after years apart. He was a symbol of their reconnection and everlasting love.
Tony rolled his eyes as his cockiness but couldn’t help smiling, knowing Steve was right. Their children’s closeness in age was a testimony to that. Harley and Morgan were a year and 8 months apart, making Harley almost a year old when Morgan was conceived. Morgan and the twins were a year and 4 months apart, which meant they were conceived when Morgan was only 7 months old. They’d probably have at least ten children by now, if he hadn’t gotten on birth control, years after he had Peter and Anna. But that didn’t mean Steve had gotten him pregnant again, over 18 years later. He was sure of what Kayla had said. “You’re in denial.” Tony whispered.
Steve wondered how Stephen had reacted to that. He would pay to see that but he didn’t dwell on that thought for too long though or question it out loud. This was the opportunity presenting itself if they wanted to try working things out and get back to where they use to be. Together and happy because they never stopped being in love.
His eyes were closed when Tony resurfaced from the sheets. He straddled him again. Steve hardened in seconds before him. “Still not even yet.” Tony remarked. He rose his hips and sunk down on Steve’s cock. He started a rhythm, whimpering as Steve held his waist and he grinded against him.
“Who’s Wade?” and everyone in the room turned to look at a blushing Peter. He really didn’t know how to answer that. He wasn’t sure what the relationship was or lack of but he and Wade had been talking almost every day since that day they almost kissed. Wade had given him his number and when he wasn’t annoying him in person, Wade was blowing up his phone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Rhodey passed Valkyrie guiding Sif inside where Thor had also seen but not heard the whole incident. He faintly heard Sif explain to him that Carol had been the one to start their almost fight, claiming he would never put their child in danger like that intentionally, which wasn’t hard to believe; Carol had been the one to approach her after all and many people could vouch to that.
“I’m forever in your debt..."
“Aunt Nat.” She tested out the words she hadn’t said in months. “I came to apologize –”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Tony.” Steve uttered, a small smile growing on his lips as they made contact for the first time with the handshake. Tony’s eyes lingered on his naked chest and biceps before Peggy spoke again. She was leaving for her office.
Pietro and Cassie joined Morgan’s circle of conversation which included Torunn, Amelia, Lila and Michelle – all the girls who secretly lusted after Pietro Maximoff. They hung unto every word that passed his lips as he spoke about his worldly travels whether their significant others were present or not.
Harley glanced up at the screen, smiling widely at her. “Hi MiMi.”
Steve was surprised to hear this. He never thought in a million years Tony would pick up for him, that Tony would ever be on his side again. Especially after what he'd done in the past and/or where they were at this point in their lives, but he was happy about it. He smiled smugly at Stephen thinking maybe there was still some hope left for his and Tony's relationship.
He wasn’t. Ending a relationship with someone you cared about would always hurt. He just really needed some comfort right now. “I will be.” He replied.
“I don’t have a condom on me,” Steve whispered. His voice was raspy and low. Tony rolled his eyes.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Steve questioned.
Nertha pleaded with her eyes to Jacob for him to wait just a while longer before she released him from the mind control. She enjoyed being dotted on. Jacob shook his head to express his disapproval. He wasn’t having it. Nertha rolled her eyes and interrupted Harley’s speech with the wave of her hand, ending his enchantment. He blinked a few times and then he looked from Nertha and Jacob to the containers in his hands, asking what was going on. Nertha gladly retrieved both containers from Harley’s hands and they levitated around her as she exited the room.
“I love you. I love you so much.” And he kissed his forehead before he was between his legs and hiking the right one up with one arm and slipping into Tony again.
“Baby. I’m not Steve. I’d never do that.” He assured him as he strolled towards their bed and joined him there. “You’re stuck with me.” He quipped, kissing the only man he’s ever loved.
Nathan ended up voicing his and Morgan’s concerns and suspicions to his father. Bruce didn’t take too well to the idea that Natasha could have been working with Hammer to hurt Steve and Tony and/or any of their children. He didn’t want to believe that; instead, he allowed her the benefit of the doubt. He’d question her specifically and directly about the situation prior to forming conclusive thoughts.
“But it makes me really excited to find out what next year has in store for all of us.” Tony paused, ready to close but, “Before I forget,” He glanced at his first born and Harley eyed him suspiciously. “Harley is getting married next summer.” Applauds rang throughout the room and Tony wished everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year as the clock stroke closer to midnight.
“So, you two aren’t planning on having more after...right?” Morgan finally asked.
“Steve.” He mumbled into his chest. “So much has happened.”
“We think we’ll manage.” Wanda assured him.
Anna chuckled, hugged his chest. “You’d have to marry me first, lover.” She didn’t want to be just a live-in girlfriend. If he loved her just as much as he claimed he did, why not just marry her?
The movie finished, Ned suggested another and Morgan used the opportunity to call out to her little brother. “What’s got you smiling over there Peter?”
“Winter, please stop running.” Bucky pleaded at his daughter as he ran after her.
“Why? What did he do?” Steve narrowing his eyes.
“Oh,” and Tony realized he really hadn’t been on a date since Steve and that was years ago. “I’m too busy to date right now. We have this new project now. And the kids. I have 3 kids to take care of, Pep. And I happen to be a single parent and –”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, you and Steve Rogers, huh?” She asked, knowingly.
“You don’t think it could be because I love him?” Strange jeered. “Of course, you wouldn’t.” he answered his own question. “It’s obvious you never did. You ruined your entire marriage just for one night with some whore I’m sure.” Strange carried on.
So, Steve knew Anna was working with Hammer at some point in time. Hammer had kept tabs on her as she grew up, considering he was the one who kidnapped her mere minutes after her birth and placed her in foster care. By the time, she was 16, he’d roped her into his plans. He had convinced her to go after her parents; he convinced her that Steve and Tony had abandoned her, and they deserved to pay for that. While Remy, who loved her so intensely would do anything for her and saw it as a way for them to gain a couple billions while they were at it.
didn’t sleep together until mid-May, Mother’s Day.” He informed him. Kayla was always accurate. She was great at her job, had been for years. Steve couldn’t, shouldn’t doubt that but he did.
“– blackmailed you. Right.” Steve finished before turning to Tony. “And we want this guy dating Anna?”
Peter decided to hang out with both Ned and Mj today. He wanted to share with his two closest friends the truce Carmelita Camacho had initiated for some sort of rivalry Peter was even aware they had.
“Love?” he tested out the word. “That’s for old people Rhodes. Like my Mom and Dad or your Mom and Dad.”
“What? No. That’s none of his business.”
“It’s just a gift from a friend...” he trailed off. Tony waited for him to continue. “A guy.” And realization hit Tony. His face lit up.
It was like he disappeared. Not even Karen could track him down. He had just disappeared. Like he never existed. And Peter knew if he gave it a little more time, he’d start to believe it himself; Wade never existed. But he did. He knew he did. The necklace around his neck was proof of that. But it had been over a month now. And his mind was conjuring up crazy ideas.
Tony only smiled and headed to the bar to fix them both a drink. He handed Steve his drink and he joined him on the sofa again with his. They clinked their glasses together, put the glasses to their lips and swallowed as the liquid burned.
Remy entered her room through a window. It wasn’t an issue that Anna’s room was a couple stories up. He hadn’t seen her in person in weeks because Anna was very aware of the fact that her siblings were being particularly inquisitive which meant Remy had to stay away.
“Dad! You didn’t have to do that,” Lila Barton pleaded. “I wanted it.”
And Harley passed the information along to his dad. He was probably struggling to use the internet now to find out who he was. Steve was really old-fashioned and hence not very tech-savvy which was weird considering he had lived with Tony Stark for years and had 3 super smart kids.
Nertha supposed she hadn’t thought this all the way through but in hindsight she never imagined this would get back to anyone on Asgard. Okay.
Tony found his daughter on the edge of her bed. Her hands covered in the outpour of her own blood which was leaking from the spot between her legs. Tony could only draw one conclusion from that. She was losing the baby. Sobs were escaping Morgan’s lips. Her eyes were red and the tears wouldn’t stop.
I did not like this chapter. Someone please tell me that they did. Even if it's a lie. Lol.
Stephen knew what was coming so he didn't give Steve the chance to speak further. “Let’s do a DNA test. You owe me that much.” He bargained. It was really that simple. If they could prove him wrong then…maybe he could try to move on from Tony.
“Hey.” Tony whispered. Stephen tried to sit up and groaned again, holding his stomach. “Don’t move. Your stomach was pumped a few hours ago.”
“June 12th…” he whispered. That date was quite a few weeks away being the 1
“Mommy’s in the bathroom. He’ll be out soon.” He assured him, walking out of the room with him and towards Morgan’s room. “So, what happened to Morgan, Harls?”
The next time Steve and Tony saw Nat, Tony had the arc reactor in his chest and Nat was a full-blown Russian spy. It had been a rough two years. When she returned, she brought Director Nick Fury and Agent Barton. Then Bruce and Thor came along and Fury wanted to form the Avengers. Thor’s brother was on the loose wreaking havoc and Fury wanted all 6 of them to stop him. Tony didn’t want any part of it. He only wished to stay at home and care for his kids. But then Carol reminded him that it would be a waste to not use his powers to help people who needed it. He used his kids as an excuse of course and Rhodey convinced him otherwise, told him to look around. They all had kids. They had to do this for their kids so that they could have a safer world to grow up in.
He and Morgan spent most of the day out of the city and in the great outdoors by a lake before they had to come back home for the dinner. Nathan’s mom, Betty was going to be there, and Morgan would be joining them as well. In the 10 months they’d been dating, Morgan had only met Betty Ross a handful of times. She imagined it was the same for Nathan with his mother living so far away. They called and texted all the time, but he never saw her enough. That was okay though because he was well aware of his mother’s love for him. And besides, he had another mother living with him that loved and cared for him just as much; if not more.
“– is just your sister.” Steve informed her. “Because that’s who the DNA results says she is.” That kept Morgan quiet as she sat back in her seat.
Steve pulled out slowly, drawing his member from the comfort and warmth of his pulsing walls. He lifted himself off Tony, helping him to turn around and get as comfortable as possible. He was on all fours with a pillow under his belly when Steve rammed his cock into him again, impaling him to the hilt. He jerked forward holding on to the arm rest of the sofa for dare life. Steve kept his pace steady while Tony cried out at each thrust. Only slowing his thrusts when Tony came again, spurting his release all over the pillow under him. Steve climaxed again. Then he leant forward, his belly and chest pressed up against his back, so his lips were at his ear. And he whispered to his husband, “You think we could go again before the kids wake up?”
Tony realized he and Pepper hadn’t talked one-on-one in a while and, with the new-found pregnancy he needed someone else to talk to that wasn’t Steve. He went by her place for a change and tried to keep his pregnancy symptoms at bay. He was really craving the distraction.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s fine baby. I just can’t go another round after that.” And Stephen tried to stop himself from getting hard again.
Following the discussion, Tony pulled Steve to the side. “Steve?” he called out. Tony could see how distracted Steve was as he watched Morgan and Nathan leave the room. He hummed to indicate that he was listening, however.
“It’s okay, Kayla.” Tony assured her. “Mistakes happen. We’re fine.” So, Kayla could make mistakes it seemed, as Steve had suggested, and she’d never know how that simple mistake caused Steve and Tony to question everything. Tony supposed there was a first for everything and Kayla could easily be forgiven.
“Hey.” Her voice caught his attention as he stood by her open front door, awaiting Amelia’s appearance. He refrained from entering her home, even though Pepper had invited him in before. He preferred to wait outside. Pepper would write it off as strange, but she respected his wishes and never pushed it. “Can I ask you something, Remy?”
Nat glanced over at the them. She let out a small chuckle and Sam had to tear his eyes away from his husband and Wakanda’s King. Why was Nat laughing? “Sam, I think you’re seeing things that aren’t there.”
“Stop teasing Rems.” She begged and at her request, he rubbed the tip of his leaking cock at her centre before sinking into her. She wasn’t aware of when he undid his zip and freed his member, but she didn’t care because with each powerful thrust and the groping of a breast, Anna could feel herself getting closer to the edge.
“And hello Valkyrie.”
“Lately?” Sam asked, sarcastically. Steve turned his attention to him. “Steve, you knew what she was like before you started this thing. Buck and I told you.”
Sam drew back, not satisfied with what had been said. “Is Winter T’challa’s?” he wondered aloud. Bucky had spent a few months in Wakanda years ago and sometime later they’d found out he was pregnant. Sam found it a little strange after they’d been trying for years with no luck then he got back from Wakanda and he was suddenly pregnant. Sam had just never mentioned it before.
“Besides the obvious, yes Peter.” Tony placed a hand on his shoulder. “I don’t want anyone taking advantage of you.”
“I think the baby is coming.” Steve noticed he was soaking the bed and it wasn’t from his cum.
“Always.” He responded, squeezing the hand he was still holding and glancing at her for a moment. He couldn’t stop the smile that crept up on his lips. “And you guys look happy.” He mentioned. Tony rolled his eyes. He was so over his children teasing them.
Nat pulled out her phone so she could show Bruce the message. He smiled but his mind was still on the things Nathan had said to him. He decided to bring up the topic right then and there. He swallowed the food on his fork and, looked to his right where Natasha was seated. He cleared his throat. “Nathan mentioned a few things that Morgan told him.”
“Dad.” Morgan called out when she noticed him. “What are you doing here?” Although she no longer lived at the mansion it shouldn’t have been a surprise that she would still pop up from time to time, especially since it was Tony’s birthday.
“Tones, I thought we were going to try to work things out.” Steve saw a pout form on Tony's lips and his eyes glistened with sadness. “You gave up on us.” And though the kids resented Tony for choosing Strange over their father when there was the opportunity for them to get back together, Steve couldn’t love him any less.
Torunn focused her eyes on Amelia. “Surely you’re not suggesting I should ask him out.”
“That’s it.” Anna stated, in all seriousness, pulling away from his touch. “I’m done.” Her back turned to him at this point but he moved to stand in front of her, hoping to keep the conversation face-to-face.
“When were you under mind control?” Steve wondered. He glanced over at Tony. He was biting his lip.
Tony drags Steve by the hand and leads him towards the dock on the lake. Tony is holding his hand a bit too tight and Steve is wincing at the pain.
Steve had heard of Howard and Maria’s son but never met him. Tony rarely stopped by at S.I. because Obadiah Stane, acting CEO was running the company’s operations. All while Tony was indulging in the sexual comforts of any man that he could find.
. Eventually, he met Valkyrie formally and the situational relationship became very real for him. Jacob became a little distant from the trio at that point on and was only able to block it out when they’d announced it publicly to everyone else.
Eyes turned to Harley’s direction. Lila Barton was the most irritated by the news, only learning about this for the first time. She wondered who he could possibly be marrying as envy ate her up.
“My Queen you should come inside,” she led Sif inside with that, giving Carol the once over. Valkyrie even did a double take.
“Why?” It was just a series of questions now on Peter’s part.
All eyes were on Amelia and Torunn cheered her on. “You possess such an incredible power Amelia. We must spar one day.”
“I was just curious, what do you know about Remy and Aunt Nat, together?”
“Sure, and besides,” She added as a matter of fact. “Jacob is seeing someone new and we’re okay as friends.” Pepper was a little surprised to hear that. She wondered if Carol knew. “So, what were you and Remy talking about?” She smiled, suggestively.
“Yes, but Amelia doesn’t need any of that.” Pepper assured her. When would she possibly need to use them? The avengers had left the world a better, safer place.
“So, he has no idea?” Tony questioned, sensing the distress in Nat’s voice.
between them.” Morgan informed them, placing great emphasis on the specified words.
“Cooper. Nathaniel. Let’s go.” The other two Barton kids came down soon after with their own bags. Lila groaned and went to get her stuff too.
Carol became a little defensive. "I'm nothing like them. I didn't cheat." She reminded her. She and Valkyrie though they were very much attracted to each other hadn't acted on their emotions.
The mansion was almost empty except for Anna. Tony was at work, Maria was out back caring for her garden, Peter was at school for his last day of junior year and Morgan was setting up her new home with Nathan. “Forgot to mention that I ran into Anna down in the lab, while in search of you.”
Justin Hammer was surprisingly hard to find. It took Tony a couple weeks in fact, not until early October. He knew Harley would have found him quicker had he asked for help, but he had no idea what he was going up against therefore he didn’t want to put him or anyone else in danger. Tony would have acted alone had Rhodey not been present when he discovered the micro-camera but here they were now, getting ready to face Hammer.
Tony rolled his eyes. Tony took in the scene. He loved doing this for his family and because he had way too much money and didn’t know what to do with it. There were only so many charities he could donate to. He watched Rhodey with Carol – they seemed to be on good terms again. Nat and Bruce – they looked happy. Sam was feeding Bucky and Winter. Clint and Laura were there too and Pepper and Amelia. Seemed like almost everyone was coupled-up not including his kids, Torunn and Amelia of course.
“Will you marry me Peter Stark Rogers?”
"I'm sorry." Harley didn't expect that. What was he sorry for? "Tony told me, your other father left when you were a baby and I get it. It must hurt to be abandoned like that. But I would never try to replace him and -"
“I really do,” and he planted a kiss on his lips.
“There is still time.” Loki reminded her. “June is over 6 months away.”
Everyone watched the pair leave, silence filling the room. Tony broke it. “So,” he said, seriously. “Does Harley get a title?”
“Sounds like a good idea. I do love the great outdoors.” Bruce mused. He hoped Nathan would be up for it by then. He knew the loss of his and Morgan’s baby was putting a toll on him right now.
Harley nodded. His eyes still closed.
“Well first of all, he’s a mutant.” Pepper informed her. She knew what Carol would ask next. Had she known he was a mutant from before? “No. I didn’t know he was a mutant. That wasn’t on his file.”
“Well,” Bruce broke the silence. “Whatever you two decide. Just know you have our full support. 100%.”
“I don’t need your judgement, Virginia Potts.” Carol taunted. Pepper laughed. She hadn’t heard anyone utter her legal name in years. “It works. Let’s not question it.”
Sam emerged from the closet minutes later, fully clothed and ready to head out. “Talk later.” He stated, kissing his cheek and heading out their bedroom door. Bucky heard the front door open and closed and then his car pulling away.
Conveniently enough, it was his body pressed up against hers when he slid back into bed that woke her. Morgan let out a yawn and turned to face him. He pushed her dark hair out of her eyes and pressed a kiss to her lips and she smiled into it. As she stared into his eyes, she could tell something was on his mind. “What’s up?”
“Steve is here…” Tony trailed off because he knew the mention of Steve was going to tick him off.
eventually but for right now he didn’t want to dwell on the thought. Instead he caught wind of Tony’s conversation with Stephen.
.” She emphasized her last statement.
He noticed Tony was sobbing which was understandable; he had a tendacy to get overwhelmed at times during sex and he'd become overly emotional since he got pregnant. “It’s okay, baby” Steve whispered. “I got you” and he position himself between his legs, sinking into him slowly. He leaned over Tony as best he could with the baby in the way and kissed him.
Morgan couldn’t do anything else but cry. They room got quiet with the sound of her first cry. Tony should have known this wouldn’t help. Not a party with so many people. Maybe he should have just got a cake and a candle and called it a day. Had he done that, maybe she wouldn’t be crying now. “I’m so sorry sweetie.”
“But who?” Pepper wondered aloud. “They’ve already gone through their exes and we know none of them could have done it. They were all accounted for on the night of.”
“I went down to get a bottle of water a while ago and I saw them together. Really close together.” He explained but decided, “I’m probably wrong.” It could mean anything really.
“Buck. Why don’t we head home in the next few days?” he suggested, one day as Bucky was preparing himself for bed. He kept his hair long as he sat before a mirror, brushing it and putting it up in a bun. He was also wearing traditional Wakandian attire. Sam had to admit it suited him.
“Sorry about that.” Harley sympathized. He didn’t know what he’d do if for some reason the relationship with Torunn suddenly ended, not when they were planning to spend the rest of their lives together
“Thor must be so excited to have a son.” She continued.
Peter was being Anna’s guide around the Christmas party, conducting introductions with everyone she hadn’t met yet. Those proceedings paused when Wade texted him to inform him of his and Ellie’s arrival. Peter had asked his mother if Wade’s daughter could attend; Tony saw no problems with that.
Bucky halted his brushing. “Really Sam? A phase?”
“Besides the sucking up,” Stephen tried to stay on track. He wanted to share this with Tony. “He said something that made me think.” He paused while Tony watched him with curious brown eyes that were glowing from the dimmed ceiling lights. “Why don’t we have a kid?”
“So you’re dating Dr Strange?” Nat inquired, sitting by Tony.
//TWO YEARS LATER//
“Thank you, sir.” He accepted, smiling down at the cheque in his hand before stuffing it in one of his pockets. Justin was grinning. His plan was fool proof.
“So, you weren’t working with him?” Harley chimed in. He figured he might as well ask, since his sisters had just ruined his wedding.
“Harley and Torunn must wed.” Thor provided and Tony released a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He was preparing for the worse after what had happened in the past week. But he sighed, almost laughing at Thor’s announcement.
Tony's jaw tightens and he's glaring at Tate again. Tate jumps out of his seat. “Your honor! What is this a trial for attempted murder or custody for a baby?”
“I’m going.” He explained, pecking Bucky’s lips once more before heading to the bathroom.
, as Steve put it. Which Peter found hypocritical considering they married after a year of dating while it had been over 2 years for him and Wade. Regardless, they went through with it, Steve and Tony tried to be supportive and they gifted them one of the guest houses on the property if they wanted their privacy.
“Cause we’re family. And we don’t get to choose our family.”
“Yeah. I was hoping one of you would make me an aunt already. I love kids.” Anna spoke up. “But not for myself.” She added as an afterthought.
Steve had told him time and time again that he never wanted anymore kids after Peter even though he wanted more but a couple years later and he would knock Sharon Carter up, no problem. It didn’t matter anymore though, right? They weren’t together anymore. He had Stephen. He was happy.
“Very.” Jacob grinned. Harley faked hurling before he was grinning as well.
Tony blushed before typing out a response.
“I would be upset if you did.”
“Yes father. I know the law and I am happy. I’ll have a brother soon.”
“You’re beautiful Tones,” It was like he was reading his mind while he took off the only article of clothing he was wearing, leaving him completely naked. Steve went to his breasts first; they were heavy and full with food for their child. It was his favorite change about Tony’s body during the pregnancy.
“Yeah you are.” He laughed as well. “I’m just a nurse at the M.R. building but you really have inspired me. Your work is phenomenal. There has never been a surgeon as great as you.”
“Just 20 minutes away Mom.” Morgan added, breaking his thoughts.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Harley James Stark Rogers, if you were here, I’d smack you upside the head.” Getting up from his seat and finally saving the model to the folder with all his work. “I have to go and get ready for a date,” Tony said proudly.
“Tony, what happened?” He whispered, handing the baby to one of the nurses and rushing to his side. Tony swayed a bit and Steve caught him before he almost collapsed. He held his face in his hands, seeing tears spurt from his eyes.
“One. I know what you look like, you’re my son. Two. Karen and Friday are linked. And three, I like to keep tabs on your medical records.”
Harley’s name was flashing across Torunn’s phone screen the moment Cassie Lang left Stark Mansion. Cassie had been over to help Torunn with some homework.
Stephen’s eyebrows furrowed as he thought of the situation. “Where were you?”
“Just a guy I met the other day. We’re just getting to know each other. It’s nothing serious.” Peter confessed, quite honestly but of course Morgan needed more than that.
“Incoming boss.” Friday provided.
Stephen understood. “I can leave, we can reschedule. I wouldn’t want to impose on your family time.”
“Maybe.” Hela cracked a smile. “But don’t we all have some malicious intent.” Loki smiled smugly and Nertha spoke up then.
Tony stared at him with fire in his eyes. “That’s not love.” And then he felt a sharp pain in his belly. He groaned as Nat and Steve drew closer.
“With further examination of the records. One can decipher that Mr. Rogers is clearly unstable.”
“Okay.” Steve had a way of commanding a room. “We wanted to share a few things with you guys.”
“I’m so sorry.” Nat expressed her regret, but Tony was growing tired of hearing it. Those words weren’t going to fix anything, and his anger consumed him as he started throwing glasses and plates at them. He was livid.
Amelia rescued him from the sight before him. He couldn’t look away until Amelia came to his aid, dragging him onto one of the balconies so they could be alone.
Torunn cut him off, holding onto one of the hands that were cradled her cheek. Harley dropped the other one and stared at her few concerned eyes. “I know but what if I gave up my place in the line of succession?” Her brother, Prince Magni would be next. A male heir as the Asgardians were so used to having.
Carol halted her actions and faced her husband, “No. I was with Valkyrie.” She answered truthfully. Carol had been spending an enormous amount of time with Valkyrie following Tony’s Christmas party last year; 3 months ago.
“So, are we going to talk about you being pregnant?” He spoke, staring up at Tony with curious eyes. Of course, Steve knew. How long though, Tony was left wondering for only a minute.
“Your parents loves me now.” Wade said, as if that explained everything, as if that could ever be true.
Tony held a hand up, ceasing Rhodey’s speech. “Do you hear that?” Tony left his bar and journeyed over to the wall were his flat screen was mounted, searching for the source of the noise he was hearing. Rhodey eventually joined in on his search once the sound became more distinct.
“So, who are
Jacob sat in the chair across from Harley, observing how he would undo and re-do his tie repeatedly. Harley was happy for the chance to wear a suit as opposed to traditional Asgardian wedding attire. In fact, no one expected or required him to change his life altogether. Thor admitted that if he wanted Torunn’s husband to “act” Asgardian, he and Sif would have chosen an Asgardian, although Harley and Torunn had had relations.
“Yeah?” Harley popped the top and started sipping on the soda he took out.
“You want me to have dinner with a room of people who hate me?”
Nathan pulled her into his arms and held her closely. “I love you too.” He whispered. They’d get through this together.
“What do we really know about Anna?” Harley continued, looking back and forth at his siblings.
He let out a small smile. “Love you both,” he kissed his fingertips and extended his hand towards Peter and Morgan.
“Anna you know we didn’t abandon you. Justin Hammer took you away.” Tony provided. She seemed indifferent but also slightly frightened. Tony noticed and he assured her, “He’s locked up, for good. He can’t hurt any of us.” Tony wouldn’t let him. Never again. He reached out to cradle her cheek, but she backed away. He was forgetting what skin to skin contact could do to him. Anna never would. She flinched and drew back further. Tony sighed, sadly.
Steve was waiting for Tony to join them when Friday passed on a message from him, through the overhead speakers of the room. As it was recently disclosed, Steve explained by starting with, “Fury has closed the case.” Steve saw his children and Wade looking around at each other in confusion. “They found the persons who were working with Hammer and they’re being dealt with accordingly.”
Tony looked down at Steve. He had tears in his eyes and on his cheeks. Steve did tend to get really emotional about most things. He just didn't think him discussing his past would be affecting him so much.
“Maybe to go then?” Justin suggested, picking up both glasses and handing one to Stephen. Stephen thought for a second before he took the glass and clinked it with Justin’s.
“You’re Pepper Potts?” he responded. He had a very thick accent, but Amelia couldn’t place it.
He didn’t get a respond; just a very nosey woman peering over his shoulder. “Is that Steve?” Sharon asked, struggling to make out the text on Tony’s phone. Tony put his phone away after that and turned to face her. She didn’t look the slightest bit apologetic.
“Don’t pull out Uncle Steve. I want everything,” Tony mumbled and that did it for Steve. The reminder that he was balls deep in someone that he considered a nephew was what usually took him over the edge. He was a few thrusts away from coming when Tony exploded underneath him. He came untouched and Tony sunk his nails deeper into his back. He knew he was drawing blood and his hands kept going through his hair. Steve felt his hole clenching around him and his thrusts getting sloppy. He released deep inside him, still giving Tony little strokes. He looked down into his eyes, both hands now gripping his ass and he kissed him again when a thought crossed his mind. He was falling deeper and deeper into this mess with Tony. He was falling in love and he wasn’t supposed to. The day Tony convinced him to have sex with him; he told him after, that it was just sex. He didn’t want a relationship then and he didn’t want it now. That was a given, given the situation but now, he wasn’t so sure.
Justin knew it was his cue to moderate the conversation between him and Stephen. Gary had done the first part of his job. “You got kids?”
When Tony introduced each other, they tried to be nice. Steve shock both their hands but not bothering to look at them. Tony meant to say more with his introductions but he was interrupted by a busy call. He excused himself to another room and his sons used that moment to interrogate Steve.
“We get that Steve but you really shouldn’t be using her like that.” Bucky was right. He always was. Sharon didn’t deserve that. She was clearly into him for more than just the sex and he didn’t want what she did.
“Dad.” Peter’s voice made them pull apart and stare at him. Tony was resting his head on Steve’s shoulder and Steve’s brows were furrowed. “I don’t need to see...” He gestured to his parents, “...whatever was happening here.”
“I’m so sorry, Bucky.” Sam started. Bucky stood, leaning at the doorway.
“We would have done it together.” Steve informed him. Like everything else. Tony sighed; guilt was eating at him but he couldn’t change the past. What had happened, had happened and he couldn’t change it. Instead he changed the subject.
“Thank you.” He replied, smiling back at Stephen as he headed out. Stephen could feel his mind already hatching something else up. He couldn’t lose Tony to Steve. He wouldn’t allow it.
“I want to,” she mumbled. They’d never really talked about having sex before. They figured they would just let it happen went it happened. Nathan just didn’t think it was going to be tonight. But who was he to complain? There was no one else he’d rather have his first time with than her. And clearly, she felt the same way too because one second, she was sitting on his lap fully clothed and the next her top and bra were gone. Nathan drank in the sight of her nakedness and held her in place against his clothed erection. He could feel her soaking through her underwear and soiling his pants.
“I think it’s someone close. Really close. Like family.”
And she remembered, Sharon was pregnant too.
“Where are you going?” Stephen asked, seeing his full outfit for the first time; he was in full black. He grabbed Tony’s arm.
“Your honor, people of the jury,” Tate began. “It is with great pleasure that I provide the court with one of the most crucial pieces of evidence on why Mr. Rogers is clearly an unfit parent.” Tate pulls out two copies of a booklet, handing one to the judge and the other to Nova Caffrey. Steve easily got an eyeful of the paper. They appeared to be medical records.
Steve laughed, still not looking at either of them but instead reaching around to hold one of their arms.
To recap:
Morgan, who was still in his arms responded when she heard her name. “Ma!”
“I had nothing to do with Hammer.” She said sincerely. “How and when did I even become a suspect? I can’t believe that you don’t believe me.”
“But you still love him.” Stephen stated, walking pass him and back into the bedroom. Tony bit his bottom lip nervously, thankful that they weren’t facing each other.
“Morgan,” She tried. “About mom...” The words were left hanging. It wasn’t hard to decipher.
But look at me writing other things when I'm suppose to be updating my ongoing story...lol
“What?” Tony stared at him in surprise. “Why would you think that?”
Visitation was 30 minutes. Tony was given visitation privileges once a week, but Pepper nor Steve wanted to see Tony that often a month. Pepper had been inside for 32minutes now and Steve was worrying, because God forbid something went wrong. Steve got out the car and waltzed right up to the front door. He provided his ID and signed the visitors’ book before he was directed to the visitors area. His eyes met Tony’s first. He smiled that damn smile at him. He hadn’t seen him in two years.
Steve couldn’t help himself from letting out a chuckle. Tony was happy to hear it.
Soon Tony joined them. Harley went to his mother’s arms willingly as Steve passed him to Tony. They journeyed to the kitchen so all 6 of them could get something to eat.
“We’re not even sleeping together, Harley. And if you must know, we’re saving ourselves for marriage.” Jacob explained.
“It doesn’t make you a bad person. You have every right to feel this way. You get to finally move past this.”
Across the room, Jacob was gagging at the sight of his parents being intimate with Valkyrie. They’d sat him down and informed him of the nature of their newfound relationship. Jacob acted clueless and stayed quiet as they’d tried to justify the saneness of it all. He resorted with uttering the words Harley had said to him several times on this very matter.
Remy’s poker face faltered but he answered after a moment in all honesty. “I was curious to know if I could have created anything good.” Pepper raised an eyebrow, not expecting that response
“…but it’s a part of our lives, a part of my life which makes it a part of yours.” Steve carried on. “And if there’s anything that you want to share with us, don’t hesitate.”
“Only have eyes for you.” Steve added. Tony was confident of that as he went back to his breakfast and a thought came to Steve. “Hey.” He said to get Tony’s attention on him again. “When are we going to tell the kids about us?” He questioned.
Sam was in the shower and Bucky almost fully dressed when he spoke again. “Our daughter told me this morning that she likes girls.”
“No. Not yet” Peter took Wade’s hands in his. “Karen, please lock my door. Don't let anyone in. Not even my parents.”
Also I'm sorry about my fight scene. I'm no director or producer or whoever coordinates fight scenes but I tried 😐 please be nice..
Loki chuckled. “Are you certain you aren’t speaking of yourself, sister?”
“I spoke with Fury today.” Tony stated. “Hammer was killed last night.”
“Because even though she hurt me just as much, she wasn’t the person that took vows with me and swore before God and all our family to love and be faithful to me.” He shouldn’t blame
Getting pregnant was a mistake - a complete accident but things worked itself out. Getting married was just something he could never see himself doing.
Now he was getting ready for the trip to Xavier’s School after reading Steve’s text. He wasn’t aware of Stephen’s presence until he knocked on their open room door. Tony smiled up at him briefly while he put on his shoes. “Hey.”
I mentioned a blonde checking Bucky out in Chapter 13 (2nd scene) when he was at the bar with Steve & Nat. That blonde was Justin Hammer. That's the only reason I mentioned that observation made by Nat 😊
“You’ll get there.” He assured her. Crushes took some time to get over. He knew that much; just not how long. He didn’t know when he’d stop thinking about Wade even though he walked out of his life.
Harley was less susceptible to his sister’s kind words. He wasn’t sure if she was being genuine. Torunn still felt the same about her because she was Harley’s sister, a member of the Stark-Rogers family and after today, they were officially, all one big family; regardless of the suspicions her new husband had shared with her after he had had a lengthy discussion with Morgan and Peter a little over a week ago. She personally didn’t see how they could draw such conclusions with any concrete proof. And Harley agreed. It was something, he’d hope to investigate further with his siblings
And quite often enough she got to see her younger twin cousins, Narfi and Vali who lived on Sakaar with their father, the Grandmaster. They were given titles as princes of Sakaar, something Thor could not grant them on Asgard as they were not children of the King. And the Grandmaster was ever so tempted to make Loki his Queen. Loki was hesitant.
It turns out, Peter had pulled Wade away with him because he was so eager to do the deed,
“Hi Dad.” Anna smiled, her voice sweet, angelic and almost child-like – her ‘dad’ voice, that Steve was sure she picked up from Morgan. She pushed Remy even further away and approached her father, meeting him face-to-chest, no longer fazed by his appearance.
“That could be a lie.” Morgan said. Anything to push her narrative because she was still a bit weary of her Aunt Natasha even though the affair with her father was proven unintentional
And Thor second guessed himself for only a minute before the newlyweds left the altar and walked down the aisle, white rose petals raining on them. Harley was officially royalty.
And now Peter was being painted into a corner. Steve was going to absolutely flip out. “Well…” he began. Steve looked at him expectantly, as did Morgan and Maria. Tony on the other hand, was clearly amused.
“Okay. I understand. Thank you for telling me.” She really was grateful that Amelia willingly confided in her. It wasn’t her business after all.
“I don’t think it would matter though. Once a cheater, always a cheater, right?”
“How do you know?” Morgan wondered.
she thought.
~P.S. I have no clue when I'll post next. I've been super busy~
“Is it June now? Has it been fixed?” she asked of him. Loki nodded. Sif, Thor, Tony and Steve had decided on June for a beautiful summer wedding in Asgard no doubt. Torunn sighed, focusing on the conversation at hand.
“You poisoned Stephen.”
“It’s okay. That guy was a menace you know. He killed people for a living.” Tony informed him. Of course, Peter knew.
“110%,” Tony corrected. That was comforting. Now they just had to decide what they wanted to do. Should they keep the baby? Were they ready to be parents?
“Where’s this from?” Tony examined the tech closer. What villain had he created now?
This time was different. They were happy, together as a couple again and both hoping Tony was carrying their baby. Kayla had greeted them, engaging in casual conversations with the couple, especially Steve since they hadn’t seen each other in years. Kayla mentioned she had seen Peter recently to get started on his shots and Steve let out a huff of air, clearly irritated. The topic changed, thankfully when Tony got situated on the examination bed and Kayla set up the ultrasound machine.
“I haven’t my Queen.” They only did this to humor Thor and she walked away to get some food. Sif made her way to the open glass doors to get some fresh air. Her morning sickness was getting the best of her. She leant against the railing, a hand on her small bump when Carol Denvers appeared behind her.
“Whatever you want.” Steve hugged him and gave him a peck on the cheek.
Natasha had of course, taken offense. She was just as clueless as he was. When Steve and Tony had briefed her about Hammer, Nat went to Bruce first, confiding in him. She was relieved but so broken, only the thought that Hammer would be locked up for life eased her mind. He couldn’t hurt anyone ever again. And then she’d heard the good news from Steve that Paige had been found and joined her family. She was happy for them and damn anyone that tried to destroy a perfectly good and stable family.
“She’s been absent from my side, quite a lot.” Sif informed him.
“Don’t you dare lift a finger, mother. Let the guys help you.” Tony lectured. She was a bit stubborn, loved doing everything herself and didn’t like help. Tony was happy he didn’t get that trait.
“I think they already know.” Tony answered as a matter-of-factly.
That was the other thing with their father, they never found out about his latest boyfriend or lover or fiancee until he was weeks away from marrying them and there was nothing they could do about it. He never listened to them but they always tried.
little girl. He should have known, she was his. But he was also beginning to think Bucky had told him about their fight. “I hope you two work pass this. He is a good man. As are you.”
Morgan’s birthday was April 26. Tony knew she wouldn’t be in any mood for a party, but it was her 18
Whom had gone on to join the X-men to use her powers for good and found a girlfriend in Michelle Jones. The couple couldn’t be happier.
“I pity you. I truly do. And I hope you come to your senses before you end up in a lake too but with a weight holding you down. Tony Stark has never loved anyone but himself. You’ll never be a family. Not with him and sure as hell not with my son!”
Sam was shocked when the words came from Bucky’s mouth. He hadn’t thought that Steve might still be in love with Tony. He couldn’t be. “Not after he tried to kill you Steve.” Sam wondered. Steve was silently sobbing when Sam continued. “You can’t still love him. You can’t.”
Tony had stayed home from work today and Stephen had come over after working late the night before. Stephen rolled off Tony before pulling out of him and tossing the used condom in the bin by the bed. He turned to face him again and started sucking on his neck. “Stephen,” Tony moaned. “I don’t want to have to explain a hickey to my kids.” Tony always thought of his children as little kids even though his youngest was 16. Stephen was confused at times, knowing good and well that a 16-year-old knew about sex and if their mother was dating again, he sure as hell would be having it.
“You don’t have to do anyone. Just go on one date with him. From what Christine’s told me, I think you guys would make a good match.”
When the birthday party was in full swing and the twins had properly celebrated by blowing candles and cutting cake, Peter and Anna wasted no time in disappearing. They were nowhere to be found, nowhere visible in their parent’s sight at least.
Anna spoke up, breaking the staring contest between her parents. “Mom wanted me to do it.” Anna stated, completely unfazed and a smug smile brightening her face.
Harley stuttered, unable to find words to express his thoughts.
Wade opened his eyes, not able to hear the tapping of laptop keys anymore. He glanced across from him, arms moving from behind his head to hold Peter’s. Peter, who had been sitting on his bed, his laptop still on his lap. His hands clasped together, however and he was staring out the bedroom window, deep in thought Wade assumed.
“I’m heading out right now,” Steve was drawn out of his thoughts, his blue eyes meeting brown ones and Tony hesitated for longer than he’d hope to. “But, I’m sure Morguna and Pete would love some Shawarma.” He stepped out of the doorway and let Steve in before asking Friday to let his kids know their dad was here. “I have to go, Steve. Good night.” And then Tony was gone, the door closing behind him. Steve settled in the TV room with Peter and Morgan while they ate their food and questioned them soon after, “Who’s this guy your mom’s going out with, anyways?”
– then she’d help Justin get rid of Stephen Strange. He and Tony had dated years ago, and Sharon guessed he wanted him back. She couldn’t quite remember it correctly. But all this was to get Tony back. It was always Tony.
,” and Morgan was realizing now it wasn’t so
Tony shook his head. Steve rested him on the only other piece of furniture in the art studio, his sofa. Tony wasted no time in dragging Steve’s pyjama pants down his legs, revealing his painfully erect cock. “For me?” he questioned, his eyes big and doe-like.
“I know.” Steve kissed Morgan’s forehead. “I’m sorry Morguna.” He tickled her nose with his and she started giggling. She’d forgiven him no problem. He knew things wouldn’t go over that easily with Tony, if he knew the truth. He couldn’t tell him. It would ruin everything. He turned to Tony. “And I really am sorry baby. Never again.” He promised. He would make sure nothing that had happened last night ever happened again.
"Dad just be careful." He begged, walking out the room as well.
“We’re going to the mall with Grandma today to finish up.” Peter informed him, referring to Morgan and himself.
- I would add the Sam/Bucky/Steve tag but that would give my ending away.
“You know we’ll always be here for you Tony. Always. You deserve happiness,” she punctuated her last sentence by resting a hand on Tony’s. Tony seemed conflicted with himself and Pepper noticed. “How are you Tony?”
Even though nothing was going on but two people getting to know each other, his overprotective sister would never approve of it. And what was he to tell her about how they met? The only people that knew he was Spiderman besides Wade now, were Ned and Michelle. And Peter glared at Ned now for even mentioning Wade. This was a conversation he didn’t ever want to have.
“Doesn’t matter what he thinks. He’s just my kids’ father. Nothing else.”
“We don’t have to rush.” Wade had whispered but Peter didn’t want to hear that.
“Can I help you?” she asked, keeping the door only partially open.
“You know a lot about me already from
“Sure?” she asked, plainly.
“Okay then that would make Aunt Nat guilty as well.” Peter reminded her. Morgan had brought her up with no proof or cause for murder.
“Thanks Pep,” Tony began pouring them both a drink when they reached his office. The room was all glass and Tony stood at one of his windows admiring the view of New York City, below.
Loki spotted Tony talking with Pepper. He had gifts floating around him for some time before he sent them flying over to the Christmas tree. Where was Peter?
Tony pulled off his cock with a pop and emerged from the covers, his eyebrows knitted together in worry. “Really?” And Steve couldn’t think anymore, couldn’t think to continue the conversation with Tony still drawing him closer to the edge.
Steve momentarily glanced up from the sketch pad that was angled on the easel, his tongue jutted out from one of his cheeks. Tony wouldn’t really keep sex away from him.
Lila let out a nervous laughter as the other three women stared at her. “I would – I would never.” She stuttered. “I’m not being bitter.”
“Sif suggested a Summer one.” Loki answered. “Around August of next year. Enough time to plan and prepare.”
“It’s becoming really hard to get ahold of her since she graduated.”
Thanks again for the support! 💛❤💙
year of life, if not sooner.
“Sam. Good to see you.” The King began. Sam couldn’t say the same.
It's really short but I hope it quenches y'all thirst for more...
“I did.” He responded, proudly. After which a giant armour three times the size of the average man and 5 times the height, appeared behind Hammer. Tony pulled his helmet back on and, he and Rhodey engaged in another battle as Justin looked on. They were being beaten badly but Tony had to remind himself and Rhodey that they’d faced worse than this and won. They defeated Thanos. They stopped him before he snapped, and Tony didn’t want to know what type of world they’d be living in today had he snapped. He had a 14-year-old, 12-year-old and 11-year-old at the time waiting for their parents to return. So, he and Steve and the rest of the team had made it through. He and Rhodey could handle a gigantic suit of armour.
he thought.
“So many things are changing.” Morgan sighed.
“Hey.” Tony whispered, holding onto his upper arm. They were both dressed in black as per traditional funeral attire. He held no animosity towards Steve. “Can I ask how you are?”
“He’s going to hate you.” Steve reminded her. That as a given. His whole life would have essentially been a lie.
“I had to pee Steve.” He shouted. “Your children were squeezing my bladder.”
Steve also knew Hammer was due to give a statement soon, that he was preparing to give up his accomplice. Steve was then able to put things together as Tony voiced, Fury’s certainty that the person in question had to be the killer. If they found that person, they’d know who Hammer’s accomplice was or is, if they were still working to bring any harm to them.
“I’m deadpool.” The guy continued and since Peter couldn’t see his face he had to guess that he was probably grinning under his mask.
Anna answered quickly. “I was working on an invention. I was hoping to surprise Mom.”
“I gotta go. Nertha needs me.” He clarified.
My creative juices are flowing..
Pepper agreed. “Yeah. Poor Tony. I really thought Steve was the one for him.” Carol hummed in agreement. She had thought so too. Tony was in a bad place before he met Steve. His father had been dead for years but the memory of him still haunted Tony in everything he did, and Obadiah Stane never hesitated to remind him of how much he didn’t live up to Howard’s legacy. Then along came Steve and everything was better. They made each other better. They completed each other.
. Sam had disrespected and betrayed him by getting their daughter tested without his knowledge.
“Oh god!” Tony screamed. He was going to cum soon and Steve knew it, yanking Tony’s pants and underwear down and fully exposing his lower half and his hole. Steve slipped a wet finger in from holding the base of Tony’s cock. Another followed soon after and Tony tighten around them as they curled and beckoned his orgasm.
“Dear cousin, I know you have no titles or claim to the throne but surely even you must know I am to be Queen after my father.” She responded confidently, waving to the crowd and smiling widely.
Peter was feeling guilty. He was in so deep with Wade now that they already planned their future together; marriage, kids, a house. Wade was the person Peter wanted to be with forever, but he knew that would not go over well with his parents. Then Steve was asking, “Who’s Wade?” But before Tony could explain for Peter, Sharon also appeared around the corner a hand cradling her bump. She did that every chance she got; proudly displaying her unborn child like she’d won at life.
Harley grinned at her and patted the barstool next to him, when they stopped kissing. She took the seat. He rose from his seat and began sharing a plate from the food dishes on display. “I made you breakfast.” He explained.
“A very good idea.” Bucky reverberated as Sam initiated a group hug which left Winter smiling. She was happy with her family, but she wouldn’t mind an addition. She just wasn’t aware of the fact that both her parents genuinely wanted to give her that, but luck just wasn’t on their side.
“Hey Harls.” She called out.
“Happy to hear.” Stephen remarked and Morgan ventured off to find her friends. “Where were we?” he continued.
“I guess you have to go back to the party huh?” And Wade Wilson was actually pouting.
They did this most mornings. Tony wasn’t the best cook. He wasn’t any type of cook really. Even when Steve was still living with them, Tony left all the cooking to Steve. He was happy though, that his kids inherited this trait and could fend for themselves.
“You want to try?”
Tony had casually said one day, years ago when addressing the Avengers. It was crazy how it held so much truth. None of them were perfect.
Apologizing for any typos/erros in advance.
“You look familiar…” he trailed off. Stephen stayed quiet. “Yeah. You look like um…Dr Strange. Yeah!” Justin put so much enthusiasm in his voice.
The plan was he’d help her get pregnant – Sharon had been trying for months to get pregnant, but Steve was
“Sounds like something you should be saying to her.” Tony responded.
She ended up crashing into the table Harley and Torunn were seated at and everyone stared as Harley helped his sister and his new wife stand up from the rumbles. Many of the guests were seen leaving the ballroom, fearing for their safety. Torunn’s eyes were glowing with lightning as she scammed the room for the other person involved in the debacle.
Morgan went on to explain. “Two people infiltrated SHIELD that night.” She reminded her brothers. “I think one of them was Remy LeBeau.”
Cassie bit her bottom lip and nodded at her. Amelia called her out. “Geez Lila are you getting wet over there?”
Steve almost lost it at that. “Hell no! Not happening. I’d be damned if Peter even so much as had a boyfriend. No fucking way!” His arms were folded over his chest while Tony gave him a look of ‘I told you so’. There was a little gasp from Steve when he realized Tony was right.
Tony soon released all over his belly. Steve following seconds after him. He pulled out after a minute and leaned down to lick up all the cum on Tony's belly. Tony grinned at him. His eyes were closed and he was very content.
“I mean its sex…” Bucky trailed off, handing Steve a glass and joining him on the sofa as well. Bucky didn’t know what else to say. Sex went as sex went. Until Bucky realized Steve wasn’t asking how the sex was going. Obviously. He was asking about the baby-making and his fertility issues. “Oh!” Now, he understood.
“That would never work on me. I’d Hulk out and you’d know for sure something was wrong.” Bruce had managed to smother the Hulk for the past 6 years. He tried to remove it from his system completely but that was proven scientifically impossible. It just took a lot more that ticking him off to get the Hulk out and that much Bruce was proud of.
Rhodey got some assistance from a nurse and Tony asked for Sharon’s room. The receptionist informed him of such, only getting the floor number out before he was hurrying to the given floor via the elevator. He rushed through the halls stopping at each room, now wishing he had stayed to hear all the receptionist had to say.  But Tony couldn't wait. He was itching to share everything which had been revealed to him in the last couple of hours. The cause of Steve’s infidelity, the real father of Sharon’s child and most importantly, the possibility that their daughter – thought to be dead after all this time – may be alive.
“So you guys are a thing now?” Jacob teased, narrowing his eyes at Harley and putting the can of soda to his lips.
“Huh?” Peter asked. Wade kissed his cheek and Peter turned to him as his face redden and a smile appeared on his lips. Peter was then able to process the words that had been said seconds ago. “I miss…” but Peter trailed off, his eyes saddened, and Wade knew to offer some comfort by maneuvering around the laptop and smothering him in a hug
“Art. That’s a very derivative industry.” Stephen jeered.
“When?” He wondered.
“Almost done.” Steve hummed. He added a few more lines to the section that represented Tony’s hair.
“Clint is going to put an arrow through your arm and no one is going to stop him.”
“You went running without me, didn’t you?” she questioned. Morgan enjoyed hanging out with her father. Morning runs were like a ritual for them now. She’d been joining him for runs since she was 4. She was a daddy’s girl and Steve knew he wasn’t supposed to have favorites, but Morgan was undeniably his.
“I love you more.” Then they’d found each other’s lips, started the removal of their clothes when they heard the doorbell of their home. Bruce went to answer it while Natasha redressed and made herself look presentable. When Bruce returned, Morgan was not too far behind.
Steve paced in the waiting area during the operation while Harley became a shoulder to lean on for Morgan and Peter. Anna had gone to the cafeteria to get cups of coffee for her siblings and father. She was the only one least affected by the situation given she’d only known Tony for such a short time. Her sadness and grief weren’t non-existent however because she didn’t want to lose one of the parents, she just got but she was the one wearing the bravest face.
birthday.
He was huffing and snarling until Tony shouted at him, “Steve! What the hell is wrong with you?!”
“I want to remind you that you had us first. We were your family first.”
“I didn’t know we were re-instating guards for the royal family, Father” Torunn wondered, looking to her father. That had not been a thing since Odin’s reign.
“That’s because you’re the daughter.” Remy remarked. “My daughter.”
The memory became clear in Bruce’s mind. He smiled at Nat. “At the time, yes. Everyone was blaming you for what both of you had done. Unintentionally of course.” He paused. “Now we know the truth. I take all that back.”
This has been sitting in my drafts since October 2020.
child?” Tony did a little shrug. “That just can’t be right.” Steve continued. “Tones, may I remind you. You used to sneeze and get pregnant when we were together?”
“He’s moving again,” Tony started, his hand rubbing over the spot where one of their baby’s feet was pushing against a wall of his protruding belly. He and Steve had just woken up and decided to stay in bed a little longer. It was Saturday after all. They had nothing to do. Tony was convinced they were having boy with Steve’s blue eyes and his dark hair and none of Tony’s issues if they were lucky.
Tony forgot Stephen had moved into his home unofficially which meant most nights he was there. This omittance from his memory, left him surprised when he’d stepped through his elevator doors and found a worried Stephen standing there. He made note of Tony’s treated wounds before anything else.
“I saw them together a few weeks back.” Morgan went on to explain. She saw the faux sincerity on Anna’s face, and she wasn’t stupid.
Anyways...Get ready for a slight time jump next chapter 👀
They watched Wade with Peter. He seemed harmless but then Harley was joining them on the balcony and all thoughts of
“Uncle Thor isn’t going to like this.” Harley murmured. He was right about that. A knock on their door paused their conversation. Loki joined them moments later.
“This year, 2017 has been pretty special for me. Yes, we’ve had losses.” Tony thought of Morgan and Nathan and their miscarriage earlier in the year. “But we’ve gained too.” Anna came to mind as he looked around the room for her. Meeting eyes, they shared a smile. Finding her was the highlight of his year. “Just another year of ups and downs.” The crowd murmured in agreement.
“And I don’t think you should be screwing my brains out every chance you get but you do” Tony shot back, taking a sip of his martini. “What ever would Aunt Peggy think if she found out.” He carried on, running his fingertips up his unclothed arm.
“Race you.” Peter stated. It wasn’t a question.
Steve did want to be a part of his life but he wouldn't force that on him if he didn't want it.
Peter got buzzed into the apartment complex where Wade lived prior to changing into regular clothes. He knocked on Wade’s door once he got to the right floor. Wade hugged Peter the instant he saw him, lifting him off the ground and spinning him around. Peter’s arms stayed wrapped tightly around Wade’s neck and his legs around Wade’s waist while he enjoyed the moment of being with Wade. He could have never been happier.
“Twenty...” Peter began.
“Cause?” Tony wanted to know. He was freaking himself out more by not knowing. Then he pulled the covers off himself and got out of the bed.
“Hey Morguna.” Tony’s tone was nonchalant.
“Harley. I was wondering if you’d like to lay with me?” she spoke softly, approaching him and placing a hand on his cheek before kissing the other.
“I have to make sure, baby.” She squeezed his palm, remembering his past falling outs with Steve. They were never easy, and she was always there for her son.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But Wade isn’t so bad. I have seen him be nothing but good to Peter.” She responded, taking a sip of her drink.
Maria was chatting with Steve when Tony entered the room again; Stephen only a step behind him. Everyone grew silent the moment they noticed Stephen.
“I go by Miss Potts now.”
He smiled sadly at them. “Guys, I appreciate you being angry for me and I know the new information can be a bit upsetting, but this happened years ago. You can’t spend the rest of your lives resenting him. Don’t let what happened in our relationship affect your relationship with your father. It doesn’t take away from the fact that he’s still a good person and an even greater father.” And Tony would know. He had had a shit father.
“It made me a better person. And though we’ve been through so much.” He paused. “And I mean, so much.” Everyone laughed. “It made us who we are. It made us stronger. So I wouldn’t change a thing because I love you so much Anthony Edward Stark-
Peter was starting to think he’d done something wrong or Wade wasn’t that into him any more for whatever reason. He didn’t know. Naturally he asked why.
“Well, I just met him last night but he’s cocky, full of himself, definitely thinks he’s better than everyone. None of us really like him.” He was referring to himself, Peter and Morgan. “But if Mom likes him then I guess it’s whatever.”
“No Steve.” He confirmed. He got up and placed a kiss on her forehead. “You should rest Aunt Peggy,” he walked away from her and directed his next words to his mother. “I’ll be outside mom.” He knew she’d want to stay a while longer with Peggy. She was one of her only friends.
“Oh yeah. That counts.” Justin informed him. “Isn’t easy though, is it?” he faked sympathy.
Morgan was sitting real cozy with Nathan as they watched the movie with their friends, a blanket thrown over them. Torunn sat by Amelia. Ned was watching the movie intensely. Michelle’s cheeks a little red as she talked with Calvin and Peter was off in a corner by himself, smiling at his phone.
“And I want to see you in 4 weeks if you decide...” She trailed off and Tony nodded. It didn’t need to be said. “The sooner, the better.” She reminded him.
“Tony.” Sam answered for him. “Probably Tony.” He paused. “Always Tony.” And Bucky couldn’t help but let out a little laugh at Sam teasing Steve.
And they were at it again. Tony was left sore and half crippled after that. Where was he getting all this energy from, being in his late 40s?
And Steve grabbed his face, kissing him intensely prior to picking him up bridal style. “So are we having sex down here or do you want to do it upstairs?”
Peter was sitting facing him on his lap. Wade’s hands were on his waist – they never went lower than that – and Peter’s hands were around his neck as their lips met in another open-mouth kiss. Peter pried his lips from Wade’s but kept himself in the embrace. Wade opened his eyes to find Peter staring at him with pure exasperation.
“What do you think, Kayla?” Steve questioned, watching her eyes gloss over the screen a few times.
“Yeah. I may be a little paranoid, but you were laughing and having a really good time with him at the Christmas Party.” He swallowed hard at the last two words. Mention of that party only brought him anxiety and infuriated him. His mother had been shot that night.
Tony almost laughed to himself.
“This isn’t your baby.” Tony stated. He didn’t know how many more times he’d have to say it for Stephen to understand. Still he ignored him.
His lips curled up into a smile and Stephen was ready to taunt him again when they saw and heard Maria Stark approaching them. “Steven!” she called out.
“So, have you all done your Christmas shopping yet?” Tony wondered.
“No judgements.” Tony chimed in. Steve begged to differ. “We’re all almost adults here.” He smiled at Peter who returned it.
When they resume, Steve takes the stand. Caffery and Tate go back and forth trying to turn the case into their favors and its making Steve lose his mind. He just wants his baby back.
Sif touched his arm to gain his full attention. Thor knew this was something they’d have to discuss and decide together, alone. “Thor and I will decide.” Sif informed her. She thanked Nertha for letting them know and Nertha nodded, a smug smile etched on her face.
