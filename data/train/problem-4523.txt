"No!" Castiel thrashed in their hold and tried to yank away. The demons ignored him in favor of unlocking the chain that kept him anchored to Dean, allowing them to be pulled farther away. Castiel continued to fight against the demons.
“Gee, Cas, dial the enthusiasm down.” Dean grumbled, lightly shouldering him. “So did you guys find the house like this?”
Eleen rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. You get on out there and rescue your pup. I’ll clean up the rest of these dishes.”
pancakes - a truly special breakfast. Well, Castiel would easily admit that he was feeling rather ravenous after their night of activities.
“I thought this might help you relax.” Castiel explained. He rubbed the back of his neck. “We don’t have to eat, though, if you wish to do something else.”
They continued on to watch the other feedings with tigers, penguins, and other various animals. By the time they'd seen each one, it was noon so Dean took Claire to the zoo's cafe and ordered them some lunch. He checked his phone while Claire demolished her Coyote-Cub Combo (chicken tenders with chips and cranberry juice). There were no messages from Mr. Novak, which made Dean frown. He didn't say anything, though, because Claire seemed to be enjoying herself.
For a second, it looked like Gabriel was going to refuse, but he nodded and placed one palm against Castiel's forehead and the other palm against Dean's forehead. He spoke the words of the spell swiftly and quietly.
Castiel was fortunate that April did not seem to hold any resentment or awkwardness from the previous night. She was perfectly lovely and polite to him, and she even shared secret grins with him when their parents weren’t looking. Castiel smiled back but… his heart wasn’t in it.
The garden itself was very joyful. They sang happily as Castiel and Dean passed. Some even reached out to brush against him, which was about as sentient as Castiel had ever seen in his garden that contained absolutely ordinary plants.
“Yeah, it was right before lunch. I think his lunch period is before ours,” Jimmy answered. He tilted his head and gave Castiel a thoughtful look. “Wait, was Dean the guy that you hated?”
“A general?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows. “And here I thought that you were sent to be my guard, but generals are meant for far more important tasks.”
"Of course we know Dean." Bobby said gruffly. "He 'n his brother used to hang around here when they were younger. It's been years since we saw 'em though."
Castiel almost called and canceled his date with April several times. He was upset with April, yes, but mostly he was upset with himself. He should have known better, should have realized the time sooner. He felt so terrible for failing Claire like that.
Ellen’s expression immediately softened. She stole Jack from Bobby and bounced him a little. Bobby sent Castiel a wink.
Castiel stares at him for a while, then he looks down at his plate. “But nothing, Dean. That would be lovely.”
“Yeah, more than okay.” Dean answered. He could feel his cheeks blushing. “That would be really great.”
Mrs. Harvelle moved to the side and gestured into the house. Castiel sucked in his breath before stepping inside. He removed his shoes and left them at the door as he made his way deeper into the house.
“We should probably get going,” he said as he stood. “I don’t think the storms gonna get any easier than this.”
Castiel nodded and took Gabe’s hand to help him up. They got the blanket untangled from around his legs, freeing him.
"There's nothing wrong with having a sugar daddy or being a sugar daddy." Gabriel said with a sniff. "I was just asking."
seen the impact of Alastair's torture. Soldiers returned with their wings torn to shreds and spirits gone. Alastair never killed the angels he captured. No, he left them for the others angels to find. He did this to make a point, to assert dominance.
Michael scoffed. "Please. We both know that you are too weak to match me. Or have you forgotten when you tried to prove yourself and failed so terribly?"
Bobby smiled. “Believe me, I know that boy is alive. I’d be way less sober if he weren’t. But, he was in a life-or-death situation and he hasn’t fully recovered, so I think you’re probably experiencing something very similar to what I did. Just want you to know you’re not alone.”
On instinct, Dean whirled around to find out who'd called him. He felt his eyes widen when he saw Castiel Novak standing in front of him.
They weren't even a quarter of the way in when the horns sounded, this time no longer echoing against the gorge walls. Castiel risked a glance back and nearly tripped and fell.
Adam lost interest in the baking when Claire finished braiding Sam’s hair, so the two ran back outside to play.
Overall, Castiel was very impressed by all of the onsies, even after Dean informed him that most, if not all, of the ideas had been stolen from Pinterest.
They loved towards the window. Dean turned to Castiel so they were chest to chest. He wrapped his arms around Castiel's neck and tucked his wings in close. In return, Castiel held on to Dean's waist tightly with one arm and then pushed the window open. He moved forward a little. Dean was able to bring his legs up and hook them around Castiel's. It was a bit of an awkward position, but one of the easiest and most comfortable ways to carry another angel when flying.
Charlie nodded, considering. “I guess that’s true. But you should know that Castiel isn’t like that. I think you’re coming up with worst-case scenarios.”
The next picture was of Mary. Castiel instantly knew she was a Campbell. He recognized her features. Surprisingly, Mary's wings were a doves. Castiel had never know an angel fledgling to retain their dove wings into adulthood. Mary was a beautiful woman. The longer that Castiel observed the photo the more he started to recognize Dean's features in her.
Gabe paid for the meal, somehow, and led them to the rollercoaster. Once again, Dean figured they were all too much in shock to really say anything against it. Dean hardly even realized what he was in line for until he was being strapped in.
Dean blinked and glanced over him. Now that the angel mentioned it, spots of dirt were evident on his (Dean’s) shirt and pants.
Well, at least April was making an effort. Castiel imagined it was difficult for the omega to be affectionate towards a pup that wasn't her own.
"Because it is clear to me that you would benefit from some care." Castiel answered bluntly. He tried not to be too straightforward when he was speaking with others as they tended to find it unpleasant or rude, but Castiel thought it was important that Dean know the motivations behind Castiel's actions.
“Students are allowed to have their own opinions, of course, but we do not tolerate any sort of hurtful behavior towards others. Gordon and Aidan both acted meanly towards Adam, which is why we are here.” Lisa told him.
“No problem, man. Any time.” Sam replies, and Dean feels a wave of relief that Sam kept it short and casual.
Dean's scent was neutral, and Castiel knew this was a conscious choice. He heard scuffling as Dean stood, then Dean's figure was exiting his cell and following the demons. Castiel caught his first glimpse of the other angel in the torchlight.
It didn't make sense. Unless, of course, Gabriel had kept it hidden because he wanted to gain Castiel's trust. That seemed far-fetched, though. The demons had no idea that Castiel and Dean would escape.
Castiel bit his lip. “All these things keep happening, and I can’t share it with Dean. I feel like I should wait for him.”
“But you are the one who drove us. I believe that deserves it’s own special thanks. I do, however, have one question for you.”
Gabriel continued. “You must know that, no matter what happens today, my cousin’s intentions are good. He feels for you a lot and he doesn’t know how to handle it, but he’s a good man. Please, you have to remember he’s a good man.”
"Okay, Claire." He said. "I'm going to wash up for dinner, and then I'll serve us what Dean made. Sound good?"
Castiel helped Claire to get her backpack packed with whatever she would need for her evening at Gabriel's house. This included Claire's pajamas and toothbrush since Castiel did not know what time he would be back.
His voice was somewhat awed, but that made sense. Castiel had been trying out new things ever since Jack had forcefully broken his deal with the Empty. He was excited to be happy again.
It was a bit troubling to Dean that the first trials would be the one-day and one-week trials because Dean had no idea if he would be off in time to work a shift at the Roadhouse, which meant he had to tell Ellen he probably wouldn't be in for the rest of the week and that he might be quitting.
He was nervous by the end of the school day. He fiddled with the fabric of his shirt and kept wiping his hands on his pants. It was such a surreal feeling to be so stressed over an interaction with someone that Castiel had vehemently hated only the day before (and still held strong feelings of resentment for).
"Maybe not Center Heaven." Castiel decided. "But at least in the outer rims of Heaven, Dean, where you'll be safe from the demons."
"They are incredibly strong." Castiel said. "It is very unlikely that a magical being could track you through them or enter without my permission."
“If you insist, alpha.” Dean replied, watching with growing delight as Castiel swallowed and his scent sharpened. “Are you feeling well?”
“Yes, Cassie, I can steer a boat.” Balthazar huffed. “Now get on already. For someone so interested in marine biology, you really hate the ocean.”
"I just wanted to let you know." Alastair said mockingly. "Now we must get on to our normal session."
Omegas were revered by angel communities, both for their rarity and their inept ability to be both strong and caring. They made for excellent advisors and counselors, often able to see the sides of an argument that an alpha or beta could not. Usually though, they refrained from higher leadership roles by choice. Most omegas, while fierce, were too compassionate and peaceful, and resented war. There were always exceptions, of course, just as there were exceptions for alphas and betas. They were by no means weak, but normally they preferred to abstain from positions that would force them to make decisions regarding war and violence.
Cas was silent. He did not speak a word the entire trip, but the weight of his stare said plenty. Dean didn’t risk looking at him.
He was unprepared for the wave of emotion that crashed over him. John’s words came back to him, sharp and loud in his mind.
There’s a tall man in his doorway with obnoxiously long hair. He doesn’t notice Dean, he’s too busy glaring at Cas.
The castle had a beautiful view of the sunset. The land came to form a hill that overlooked a large meadow with a glittering lake in the center, so Dean and Castiel stood near the edge of the hill as the sun sunk behind the far mountains.
“Cut the crap, Papa.” Claire snapped. Castiel made a mental note to reprimand her on her tone later. Now was clearly not the time. “I know what abandoned means, and that’s exactly what happened to me. She gave me up.”
Jack shifted and Castiel watched Claire’s ears prick in attention. The cat stalked forward slowly, her eyes wide and head low to the ground. Just as Castiel was beginning to think that, maybe, it’d be best to keep Claire separated from Jack, Claire reached the baby seat and nosed Jack’s foot. Jack kicked his leg in response, nearly hitting Claire. Claire reared back a step, but only for a moment. She approached Jack again, and this time she rubbed her head against his foot and started purring.
Castiel slowly moved back so he could brush his hands through Dean's wings. Dean shivered but did not say anything.
“Wait, man,” Dean said, his lips pursed and green eyes stormy, “Look, I know I’m not the smartest guy, but I’m really giving it my all. It’s really obvious you don’t want to be here and you don’t like me, so why’d you even agree to tutor me?”
Dean dropped his hand and his wing and looked away. Castiel immediately missed the touch, but he looked ahead at the demons and stayed silent. His hands stayed stiffly at sides.
"Crowley?!" Castiel took a step back and flared his wings. If the demon was truly Crowley, then he'd been understating when he'd said he was one of the highest. In fact, Castiel had believed him to be the king of Hell, so it was surprising to hear the demon say he wasn't.
"We do not have to leave right away." Castiel said. "I would like to leave either tomorrow or the day after, just enough time to regain our strength. I have no doubt that the demons have alerted Alastair of our crossing over the gorge. It will not be long until the demons are swarming this woods."
Daphne practically jumped at the alpha voice. She nodded once and scurried away. Castiel sneered in her general direction, then angrily punched the 'down' button for the elevator. He regretted losing his temper, just a bit, because it meant that he had to stand and wait for the elevator while his employees pretended they hadn't seen him yelling at Daphne.
It fell so silent that Castiel could practically hear his heart beating in his chest. Mr. and Mrs. Kelly stared at him with open shock, while Naomi looked absolutely furious.
Castiel breathed out and took a couple of more steps forward, causing the pressure to decrease again.
The rest of what he sold did not normally sell as well. Sometimes his customers would purchase one of his small potted plants or his tea, usually though it was a local from the town and not a tourist. Gabriel always told him that he would make more money if he moved closer to town or opened his shop there, but Castiel did not care. He preferred to be more secluded.
There was a spark of recognization over the frayed edges of their bond, causing Castiel to jerk in his seat and reach out.
Castiel woke before Dean early in the morning. It couldn't have been more than a couple of hours later.
It made Dean just a bit proud and smug to know he’d caught Castiel’s eye because he liked getting positive attention from good alphas like Castiel (and
"I'm a garrison leader." Castiel said, choosing to omit that Dean was a Nephilim. "I am high-ranking and hold valuable knowledge on our war strategies."
“If they didn’t want to play with the boy, then that’s their choice.” Mr. Walker said, voice a growl.
Castiel decided he liked hearing Dean call him his witch almost as much as he liked him calling him his boyfriend.
“Hey, good for you, man.” Dean moved forward and slapped a hand on Cas’s shoulder. It felt awkward and forced, as most of their interactions had been since Chuck died.
Dean ducked his head submissively, his own wings hanging low and open. Alastair chuckled as he stalked forward. His hand slipped under Dean's chin and he lifted it up roughly. Dean's eyes immediately looked down. Castiel felt a growl rumbling deep within his chest, but Alastair ignored him.
recap: John is a demon, Mary was an angel, but somehow they managed to have Sam and Dean. Castiel accused Dean of conspiring against him and Dean ran off into the woods (like a Disney princess). Then Bobby knocked some sense into Castiel's brain and Castiel went after Dean where he found both the omega angel and Gabriel
"I'm going to pick you up again." Castiel said. He took a step towards the ferret and slowly held out his arms. When the ferret made no movement, Castiel picked up the ferret and held it close to his chest. It squirmed a little in his hold, but Castiel didn't sense any distress. He brought the ferret to his bedroom and put it down on the bed.
Castiel settled himself on the ground. He shifted around until he was as comfortable as he could be. Dean also took a seat on the ground, stretching his legs towards the fire. Being near the center of camp made it all the more difficult for them to escape, but it also allowed them to feel the warmth of the fire.
"Then we understand one another." Castiel said. He reached forward to grip Dean's chin, gently forcing Dean to meet his eyes. "Please, Dean. Stay here, by my side."
They all froze and stared at Alastair. The demon's back was towards them. His hand was held up, halting them.
“Here, Dean!” Castiel managed to gasp. He pushed himself up, wiping tears away. Jack was resting on Dean’s chest, unharmed by Castiel’s careful smothering. He gently picked up the pup and held him out for Dean to inspect.
“I’m being productive.” Dean corrected. “Besides, it’s good to get out of the Bunker every once in a while.”
"Mary joined her father on a patrol and they met a demon patrol. John was there on his first patrol. Mary out-skilled John. She spared his life, though, because they were both so young. John ran away, let the demons believe he'd been killed. He and Mary became friends, fell in love, but Samuel wouldn't hear it, so Mary ran away with John and they settled 'round here." Bobby explained. "John grew to resent the demons and the war, so much that he cut off his horns."
Dean did not call at 11, or 12, or 1. Castiel checked the clock nearly every 10 minutes. He was filled with anxiety throughout his entire day.
"Good." Naomi leaned back in her chair, looking genuinely pleased. "Now, there's a charity ball this Friday night. The Kelly's daughter April will be in attendance. I expect you to be there."
Castiel stiffened out of instinct, eyes widening. His left arm locked at his side while the right, which had been placed on Dean's shoulder, slipped behind the familiar in an awkward sort of hold. Dean must've taken Castiel's stiffening as a sign the witch was rejecting him because he pulled away quickly.
Dean must've been pleased with Castiel's explanation because he closed his eyes. Castiel resumed his petting.
Dean twisted around and saw that Sam was the same, his long wet hair sticking to his face and getting in his eyes. Dean snorted at him and looked forward just as Castiel twisted in his seat. He was wet too, his hair flat and plastered to his head, and Dean would be lying if he said it wasn’t hot to see him wet and imagine if that was how he looked in the shower.
On Thursday, he made sure that Claire understood he would be gone for most of the weekend and she would be staying with Gabe. He also let Dean know that Gabe would be taking Claire in the afternoon. He said goodbye to Claire because he would be going to Napa straight from home.
Castiel's schedule for the day was rather light, which was optimal if Dean stormed out midday. It also allowed Castiel to catch up on a bit of back work.
Dean stood from his chair and left the room before Castiel could process what he had said. Luckily though, Dean did not take long. He came back with a gift bag nearly overflowing with tissue paper.
"Little birdie told me that you're terrorizing everyone here without your coffee fix." Dean teased as he held up the cup.
The demon guards returned a guilt-ridden Castiel to his cell. He gnawed at his lip and paced in an attempt to ease the knot that formed in his stomach, but it did nothing. Dean watched him silently from his cell.
The clouds look fluffy and soft. Castiel wanted to be up there, flying. He reached up a trembling hand, eyes slipping closed.
“Language, Cassie dear.” Balthazar replied sweetly. “Besides, it’s my birthday, you’re not allowed to hate me.”
Dean loved Charlie, but some part of him still wondered why she was here instead of someone else, like Bobby.
They’ve spent hours here together, but Dean feels awkward for some reason. He gets two bowls and spoons from the kitchen and sits down with Cas. He pours the soup from its container into the two bowls and passes one to Cas.
At Castiel’s stern glare, Gabe relented. “Fine! Sorry, fetus. Anyways, can we eat the cupcakes or not?”
Castiel startled a bit at that, both because of Claire's request and because of the mention of the zoo, it had slipped his mind. "You want Mr. Dean to come?"
Castiel hummed. He wiped his face. The tears had stopped some time ago, but his cheeks were still damp.
“Mr. Walker, you and Gordon will need to stay behind after this so we can further discuss Gordon’s behavior.” Lisa said. “Mr. Winchester, thank you for coming in.”
Castiel bit his lip. He wanted so badly to take Ellen up on her offer, but he couldn’t. Maybe what she suggested would be good for others, but not for Castiel. Already he could feel himself slipping away, desperate for an excuse to block himself off from the world. He could never turn to alcohol the way that John Winchester did, but there were always other ways to drown oneself, and Castiel had a history of pouring too much of himself into his work. It was Dean who pulled him out of the hole he’d steadily been digging.
Castiel handed him the keys and got in on the passenger’s side. Dean slid into the driver’s seat and gripped the wheel of the Impala.
Summary: Castiel is minding his own business when his classmate approaches him and tells him about a bet. He promises Castiel half the winnings of the bet if Castiel completes it with him and holds his hand for five minutes. Castiel says yes because he wants the money... No other reason.
The bell chimes and the first of the lunch rush comes in. Dean gives himself a little shake and goes to take the customer’s order.
“This reminds me of flying.” Castiel said, his voice soft. “It’s not at all like flying, but likely the closest I will ever get to it again.”
“Hey, just because it’s not real coffee, doesn’t mean it’s not delicious.” Dean replies. He takes a long sip of his pumpkin pie frappuccino for emphasis. It’s entertaining to see Sam’s face screw up in disgust.
They stumble towards the bathroom and have what is probably the least clean (and most fun) shower ever to be done in existence.
True to what Cas had said, there were no alpha guards or servants near Dean at all. His guards for the day were betas and his servants were betas and omegas.
The doctor did not look up from Dean as she worked on him. “We’re going to need to get him into surgery, he’s hemorrhaging. Someone take care of the alpha.”
Castiel’s heart clenched. He felt guilty, which was absolutely ridiculous because Dean should know better from his own merpeople customs.
"Yeah, I can see that." Gabriel looked back down at Claire, something like awe in his eyes. "You, missy, have your daddy wrapped up all around your tiny finger."
"I hadn't thought of that." Castiel admitted, somewhat amazed. "Thank you.  Your work is excellent."
“I treat him as anyone should treat their partner.” Castiel protested. He could feel his cheeks pinkening.
"Yes, you fucker!" Dean shouted, eyes flashing angrily as he bared his teeth at Castiel. Castiel could not help but swallow and step back. Dean's eyes were a dark omega blue and his fangs had enlarged, much larger than any omega fangs Castiel had seen before. He couldn't deny how fearful he felt.
"Nah," Dean replied, "you're the first. It was kind of a surprise too. I mean, I could sometimes hear other angels being tortured, and the guards would talk to each other about it, but I never saw them. Sometimes I could scent their blood, but that was the closest thing I had to physical proof."
"That is very kind of you to say." Castiel chose his next words carefully. "I am happy to discover that you are more down to earth than other omegas I've met."
The being was approaching from the front, near the entrance of Castiel's shop. The wards circled Castiel's property, though the shop and house were near the border of the wards since it was close to the street and more convenient for customers, so there was only fifteen feet or so between the entrance to the shop and the wards.
Castiel started getting ready about an hour before he was supposed to meet with April. It took a long time for him to decided which shirt he wanted to wear. After he finally picked a blue one that Gabriel had once said made his eyes pop (not literally, Gabriel had clarified), he tried to decide if he should wear cologne or scent-blockers. He thought he would like the scent-blockers, which should mask his negative emotions unless he was
It was a little on the warm side when Castiel finished, so he and Dean headed into the house to rest. Castiel served himself water and gave Dean some iced tea. The familiar wrinkled his nose but did not comment. Castiel figured Dean would prefer more alcoholic drinks, but it was much too early for that, in Castiel's opinion. Dean had never argued with him about it before, anyways.
Dean feels his hope crash and knot in his stomach. He licks his lips and tries not to let his disappointment show.
It was just after six in the morning, and the light was beginning to peak through his windows. So, at least Castiel had managed to sleep for five hours. He groaned and rubbed his eyes, then pushed himself out of bed.
And so Castiel was dragged, rather unceremoniously, down to the dungeons and shoved into a cell with so many wardings he could not even begin to think of a way to escape. The cell kept him bound to earth and his grace beyond reach. He was filled with anger and rage, and it fueled his actions.
Claire beamed at him and looked back at the television, so Castiel felt that he'd gotten at least one thing right.
“Fuck you!” He snapped, pointing accusingly at his dad. “I do so much for this fucking family and you never give me a fucking thank you! You come home drunk, laze around all day, and continuously tell me what a piece of shit I am. I don’t give a fuck! You’re the asshole that abandoned his sons! You’re the one who’s too much of a drunk to get a job! You’re the one getting kicked out of town because you can’t get your head out of a bottle! Fuck you! You have no right to judge me! I keep Sam and Adam away because I don’t want them anywhere near you!
“Castiel is really fair, I doubt he’d fire you when he chose to have sex with you.” Charlie said reasonably. “And what’s the worst that could happen? He fires you and you have to wait tables again?”
Castiel glanced down, wondering if the water was clear enough for him to see his limbs beneath the surface.
Castiel spent the day in his shed and walking to and from the his shop, which was the front part of his house. He paused a few times throughout the day to greet the animals that visited his garden. It was mostly small rabbits with twitching noses and trembling whiskers, but sometimes Castiel would see a garden snake slithering by.
Dean huffed. “You must be blind them then. You’ve got the whole broody, mysterious vibes going on. Plus, you’re fucking smart. I dunno if you’ve ever seen BBC’s
He was very happy that Dean felt comfortable with Castiel. It felt more like companionship. With that in mind, Castiel found that it was easy for him to fall back into a peaceful sleep.
“Yeah, man.” Sam said. “We were all super worried for you. Actually, we should probably give Bobby a call already. He’s going to kill us for not letting him know right away.”
Dean takes his kids to school - and while Claire insists she’s old enough to walk alone, Dean’s not even close to letting her go out that far and for that long unsupervised - and then he stops at the store. He’ll make mac-n-cheese or something. Comfort food for Cas since he forgot Dean’s working and that always puts him in a bad mood.
Castiel rolled his eyes, though he knew Dean could see the affection in his expression. “No, of course not, dear.”
Dean focused on steadying his breathing and calming his scent. It came rather instinctually, thankfully.
Dean seemed to have fall asleep. His breathing was slow and even. Occasionally he would twitch and then fall still. It was all very relaxing and almost domestic.
Dean and Castiel both bounced back, the moment ruined (yet again) by Sam. Dean’s obnoxious, third-wheel of a little brother was standing in the doorway with a disgusted look on his stupid face.
"An acute observation." Castiel sighed. "I suppose I am stressed. I've been having a difficult time trying to find a nanny for Claire. None of them last much longer than a few weeks."
Castiel was still looking down, but he could see the light that came with transformation out of the corner of his eye. When he glanced back up, Dean was in his human form. He was naked, of course, so Castiel slipped out of his coat and slowly, almost reverently, he placed it over Dean.
While Claire napped, Castiel searched for nannies online and sent a few emails. He also posted an ad on some nanny website. Hopefully it would yield good results.
“Two things can be true, Cas.” Ellen replied. “Right, these burgers are done. You keep them in the oven, I’ve set the temperature low enough where they’ll stay warm but won’t burn. Same with the pie. When Dean comes home, you give him the date of his life.”
helping you escape." Crowley said. "I didn't say that I'd stall for you. Alastair's going to realize you're gone as soon as the guards change. Can't call off the search and have them think I've gone soft. In fact, I'll probably double the guards."
Dean sat down on an armchair that was set apart from the other seating. It was specially for him since he’d be the focus of most of the games and he’d also be the one opening the gifts.
“I don’t think so, Dean.” Sam said. “I mean, Jack can’t use his powers, but he can still sense some things in the world. That’s how we knew you two had dropped in. He can’t sense anything supernatural.”
“Dean,” Cas interrupts firmly. “I swear to you, this has nothing to do with me thinking less of you or not being into you.”
“No way.” Dean scoffed. “There’s always an ulterior motive. Where’s the office? We gotta do some research on how to get out of here.”
"With an army." Castiel said, scowling at the floor. "They attacked my patrol of seven. They were much farther past our borders than we expected, and so we were traveling in lower numbers. My companions did not survive."
"I'm sure you've heard all about me." Alastair said softly, dangerously. He leaned forward so their faces were mere inches away.
Dean continued to sleep after their coupling, only stirring every so often. It worried Castiel, so he watched Dean intently from his own cell until Alastair sent for him.
It turned out that Dean had been about to go in the completely wrong direction before Sam and Co. had turned up. It wasn’t far at all until they hit a road, less than five minutes, which made Dean feel a bit foolish. There was a car parked off to the side of the road, one Dean did not recognize, but Sam had the keys.
"Okay." Dean said again, eyes wide and wet. "I trust you. If you tell me that we can stop him, without harming you, I will stay."
"Dean, I am happy to have reunited you with your family and that you are now home." Castiel said softly.
“Oh. That’s uh,” Dean cleared his throat, “That’s cool. I am too - attracted to guys, I mean. Not just guys, though. Girls too.”
"Mother," Castiel bit out, his teeth gritted, "Amelia just left, and Claire is still adjusting. I've yet to find a permanent nanny for her. I don't have time for social events, and it is much too soon to start looking for another mate."
Gabriel puffed out his chest. “I just wanted to say that I am happy to be alive and I am happy to be back with you fabulous people. Well, most of you. I’m grateful to be doing the horizontal tango with Sam.”
"Touché." Alastair said. "This has taken quite a fun turn. I'm afraid you've gotten something wrong though, angel."
The sulphuric scent grew stronger and Castiel knew he was getting close. His alpha snarled and urged him to go faster. Castiel's wings twitched with the need to fly. Instead they were just bulky and put him off-balance.
“Cassie, where have you been?” his brother demanded. “I was waiting for twenty minutes, I called you three times!”
Castiel glanced down again. Over Dean's head, Castiel could see the ground shrinking as they rose. Something caught his eye in the distance, making Castiel squint. Whatever it was, it was surrounded in darkness. It was far below them, but it made Castiel uneasy. They drew nearer to it. It was so dark that Castiel shuddered.
"I think it's time you get reintroduced to our social circles. You need to start looking for a mate."
I hope everyone enjoyed the fic, I really enjoyed writing it and I'm so happy I got to participate in the DOBB this year
"I see." Castiel went silent after that, considering. If Dean was indeed a Nephilim, then he and his brother would both be extremely powerful. It made sense, then, that Dean could still feel his grace.
"Of course it matters!" Gabriel exclaimed. "You need passion in an intimate relationship, Cassie! It's not a business partnership, it's supposed to be enjoyable and intimate."
Dean bit his lip. It definitely sounded like an excuse. "Hey, you're a busy man, I get it. Claire doesn't get it, though. You're going to have to make it up to her. She'll probably be upset for a while."
“Uh!” Castiel stammered. He was blushing and his heart was beating so quickly he thought he might choke.
"I understand." Dean nodded, his eyes scanning over rules. He took out his phone. "I'm just going take a picture."
Ellen didn't look convinced. Castiel didn't know why, but the fact that Ellen was also worried for Dean seemed to put him on ease a little. Maybe it was because Castiel knew that he wasn't being overprotective or something.
A tall demon, the tallest Castiel had seen, appeared from the tree-line and marched towards them. Castiel tensed.
Castiel closed his laptop and leaned back with a sigh. It was nice to have a nanny set up for the day, but Castiel already felt like it would end poorly. Maybe he should think about getting Claire a counselor of some type since she clearly wasn't coping well. But other families went through divorce and their children turned out fine, so what was Castiel doing wrong?
He undid his seatbelt and got out of the car. Before shutting Baby’s doors, he took a moment to stretch and loosen his muscles. He wasn’t as young as he used to be and driving for hours on end was much more of a toll than it used to be.
Crowley stepped between Castiel and Dean before Castiel could process what Crowley had said and get upset. Crowley took out a small key and easily unlocked the window.
Claire’s mouth and forehead puckered as she stared at the ducks in concentration. She threw the second fry. Her aim was a little better, not by much, but the ducks did not care either way.
"They start out like you, you know?" Alastair chuckled. "Strong and fearless. Confident. But I break them down. It doesn't matter who they are, or who they
"If you're not alpha enough to do the deed, then I will." Alastair said, rolling his eyes. "The bitch is lucky that demons and angels can't procreate."
Bobby scratched thoughtfully at his beard. "I might got a few things in my storage room. You're welcomed to take a look."
"I'm inclined to agree." Castiel sighed. He finally moved to the back of his cells and slumped against the wall. At least the cell was wide enough so he could outstretch his wings.
Castiel took the ferret's distractedness as an opportunity to subtly probe at the ferret's mental barriers. The ferret froze, ears pricking, and Castiel paused. He kept his face impassive when the ferret looked at him as it licked its mouth. It stared at him for a second more, making Castiel's heart speed up. Could it tell what he was doing?
When the nausea passes, Dean gets up, brushes his teeth, and stares at himself in the mirror. Sam and Cas are still talking and they’re oblivious to Dean’s internal crisis. Dean looks at his reflection and wonders how it’s going to change when he gets his memories back. If what Cas said was true about how he thinks about himself, well…
The ferret finished the last of the meat and started to lap up the water. Then it looked over at Castiel curiously.
Castiel swayed precariously but managed to stay standing. He felt even weaker while trying to carry Dean. He stumbled toward to the entrance of the shop and quickly realized that he would not be able to carry Dean into the shop. Not only was the door closed, but Castiel would have a difficult time maneuvering his way inside while holding Dean, and the door leading from the shop to the rest of the house was also closed. Castiel didn't know if he had the strength to put Dean down and pick him up again in order to open the doors. It already felt as though his legs would give out.
"Let's get going." Alastair said, gesturing to the tapestry. Two demons stepped forward and pushed the tapestry to the side, revealing a hidden door. Heavy warns were carved into the stone. Alastair brandished a key and unlocked the door. He entered first, then Dean and Castiel were forced through with the other demons. The door shut behind them all. Castiel felt his hopes sinking. It would take a long time for invading force to inspect every part of the building, and it would take even longer for them to find the hidden door. Tapestries lined every hallway. The wards would force the invading forces to break in with physical strength and not grace. By then, the demons would be long gone with Castiel and Dean in tow.
“Dean!” Castiel said. He was taken off-guard by the sudden appearance of the other boy and his heart skipped. He scrambled to stand up. “Hello!”
Note: consider the tags to be active always and also tags can be added at times (though if there's anything particularly dark I'll try to remember to add a warning)
Castiel's phone buzzed in his pocket, shaking him from his thoughts. He glanced at it and saw that Balthazar had texted to ask where he was.
Ellen made a noise of disapproval, but Castiel tuned it out. It was upsetting to him that angels would be rude to these humans for no reason. Angels were meant to be good creatures. It seemed odd to him that they would go out of their way to taunt and mock the humans when there was no quarrel with him. Angels mostly flied, though Castiel knew that many of the Earth and outer Heaven patrols went on foot so they would not miss any signs of demons. If the patrols went through or near the Earth villages, it would not be unbelievable for them to overhear news from Heaven.
"I think we have different definitions of decent." Castiel sighed, but he truly was relieved that Gabriel would be there too. "Have you seen Mother?"
of the best things that’s ever happened to Dean.” Gabe amended, grumbling. “Didn’t have to hit my shoulder, Sammy, I was
Castiel quickened his pace until he was nearly running through the woods, desperate to catch up to Dean. He slid to a stop when he reached a river.
They played Chutes and Ladders again, and the second time it was Dean who won, Adam who came second, and Claire who came third.
Adam beamed. He took Dean’s hand and led him and Claire to the bookshelf, where he started taking out various books.
He approached the merman hesitantly and took a seat. The merman made no move to eat Castiel or otherwise harm him, so Castiel relaxed a fraction.
"Oh." Castiel said. He wanted the very best for Claire, and usually that meant nannies qualified enough to be prestigious tutors.
Jack’s eyes were slipping shut by the time Castiel had finished changing him, so the alpha put Jack back in the crib and watched him for a few moments, just until he was sure that Jack was asleep.
"I missed it." Dean whispered besides him. Castiel startled slightly because he had thought Dean was asleep. The demons were mostly asleep by now. The only ones still awake were on guard, but they were too far from Castiel and Dean to hear their quiet chatter.
(which helped me a lot with ideas and just going forward with this fic) it's full of wonderful writers, readers, artists, and lovers of Destiel
Castiel flinched when Dean's hands first came into contact with his wings. Castiel forced himself to relax and lean into Dean's touch.
"I need to apologize." Castiel said quietly. "I let something distract me yesterday, and because of that I missed out on an amazing opportunity to spend the day with you. You're upset by that, and I don't blame you. It's okay that you're mad at me. I did something wrong. You don't have to forgive me, Claire, if you don't want to, but I hope you know that I love you and I am very,
He was sitting on a soft cot in a small room. There was only a tiny oil lamp in the corner. Across from Castiel was another cot with a blanket covering a winged figure.
“I found a pair of keys in my pants.” Sam added. “There was a house alarm, but also a sticky note next to it with the code. The house all this stuff that could've been ours.”
Castiel snarled again. He angled himself at Dean’s side. He wouldn’t let anyone near his sickly mate.
Dean ignored the comment and took Claire’s hand in his free hand, then he led the two out of the room and to the parking lot.
Castiel did not like Dean Winchester. Not one bit. He was just like every other jock on campus: arrogant, entitled, and a massive jerk. What irked Castiel even more was that no one seemed to notice that Dean was awful except for himself. Everyone loved him, teachers included, and Castiel couldn’t figure out why. Dean was just a pretty boy (annoyingly pretty) and nothing more.
"Well," he said, hating the his voice cracked, "I did not want him to be harmed, and I made the decision to be with him since you would bring Dean the most harm."
“About a month or so.” Charlie shrugged. “Your surroundings can have an influence though. If you’re around more alphas or omegas, then you’ll probably go into heat or rut sooner.”
“Ugh, enough. Let’s get to the living room.” Dean led them past the entrance and to the living room.
“So alphas do the protecting and the fighting, omegas have kids, and betas just do whatever?” Dean said.
She led them out of the house and to a garden in the back. Castiel had passed it briefly with Mr. Kelly on the way to see the rest of the property, so he was glad to have the opportunity to get a better glance.
Jimmy made a thoughtful noise. “So Dean’s never actually done anything to you, personally, but you don’t like him because he’s a jock and all jocks are jerks?”
"You won't," Dean broke off and averted his gaze, "I thought that you were going to take me to the outer rims to show me the stars."
As he was saying it, though, Castiel realized he was wrong. Dean was powerful. It wouldn't be surprising that pregnancy symptoms would be sped up with the amount of power that Dean radiated. Dean did smell a lot like Castiel, too.
"Daphne!" He yelled, waiting only a second for his beta assistant's head to peak through. "Reschedule my meetings!" He grabbed his coat and briefcase and stormed towards the door. Daphne jumped out of his way, her eyes wide.
There was no word from Cas other than that he wouldn’t be present during dinner. Claire was sad when Dean told her that her dad was working late. She ate slowly when Dean served her spaghetti, but she sped up when Adam started saying he wanted to play Chutes and Ladders.
"If he is, then he won't be for long." Alastair scoffed, speaking Castiel's thoughts aloud. "He's likely injured and abandoned somewhere, no match for my demon patrols."
Ellen clicked her tongue. “I’m sure it will be. You probably haven’t had the time or energy to cook yourself a meal. I’ll be spoiling you.”
Dean looked up sharply, his jaw slacking. He stared at Castiel with wide, vulnerable eyes, like he wanted to believe that Castiel was telling the truth but would not dare to hope so.
. Dean got to be the pilot the first time, but he went several times and tried other roles. The last few times, only Charlie came with him because the others had grown tired of it.
Castiel circled them slowly to make sure that no demon came close. His mind raced with thoughts. Demons could not fly, so Castiel might be able to escape that way. Except, he doubted that Dean was strong enough to fly, and Castiel wasn't sure he could carry the both of them at the moment. He still had to try.
Castiel shrugged as an answer. He did have some things that he preferred to keep to himself. Dean had no following questions, he just stared at Castiel with inquisitive, perceptive eyes.
There was a sudden and horrible, high-pitched ringing, and Dean couldn’t help but cry out. He covered his ears with his hands, but it did nothing to block out the screeching sound. The ground shook violently, making Dean stumble and fall to his knees.
“Alright, enough!” Sam nearly shouted. “Gabe, shut up. Dean, you’re way too sensitive with Gabe. Let’s just eat.”
"Sorry, little miss." Dean kneeled down in front of Claire. "I'll be back tomorrow, okay? Plus, there's someone I want you to meet."
“Okay.” Claire said cheerfully. She released Castiel’s legs and then jumped on the couch. She picked up the remote and started up the movie again. Dean smiled and turned back into the kitchen.
It was dark and dreary. Dean’s nest, the one he’d so carefully and perfectly made, was abandoned. The whole held the heavy scent of an alpha in mourning.
Instead, he heard laughter and giggling from the living room. Castiel made his way over and curiously peered into the room.
“That’s because you’re actually good at talking about how you feel.” Dean said. “I’m not. I’m just going to feel so awkward and overwhelmed around him. Besides, even if I could talk about my feelings, I still wouldn’t. He’d fire me on the spot.”
“Dad,” Dean pleaded. He tried to summon up the omega-persuasiveness bullshit his alpha professors always talked about. “There
Dean looked away before he retold everything he'd said to Bobby. Sam was quiet throughout Dean's explanation, but he looked sad at the end.
Once they got home, Castiel got Claire ready for bed. He usually put her to sleep around seven, seven-thirty at the latest.
Sometime later, the guards returned. They came for Castiel, and though he did not want to leave Dean, he also did not want to stir up any more trouble. He went along with them quietly.
"My name is Castiel." Castiel said. "I did not realize you were a familiar when I found you, otherwise I would have not forced you from your animal form."
Sam nodded but Castiel knew he was still tense. Gabriel's wings were flittering uncomfortably as well, but he said nothing.
Dean hunched in on himself a little at Castiel's probing question, making Castiel's stomach clench with regret.
Dean didn't respond, so Castiel spoke for him. "It is not ideal. He and the fledgling will be safest in Heaven, so we have to leave as soon as possible."
Dean let out long-suffering sigh. "The bond requires that both partners say 'Yes,' but it doesn't matter if one of them doesn't really mean it."
After finishing up his pie, Dean started on dinner. He decided to be simple and make spaghetti, but before that he called the kids in to play inside. It was too cool for them to be out very late, at least without warming jackets. It was easier to have them come play inside, though. Dean set them up with candy land in the living room, then made dinner.
“Took your sweet time, huh?” She asked, crossing her arms. “What? A month and a half wasn’t enough.”
The ground fell out from beneath Dean’s legs, and his stomach lurched. Cas’s hands fell away from Dean’s shoulders and Dean felt a spike of panic. He reached out blindly in an attempt to grab Cas.
The best part came at the end of the evening, though, when Dean drove Castiel home in his 1967 Chevy Impala and kissed Castiel again before dropping him off.
"Dean," he said, "I find that I am having trouble relaxing without your physical presence. Would you be opposed to sharing a cot?"
"I know that some alphas prefer to be stern or distanced from their children so that their praises and affection are more valuable, but I like to be open with my emotions around Claire." Castiel said. April's scent got sweeter then. She was obviously pleased by this answer. Many traditional alphas were like how Castiel explained them. It was how his own mother had raised him. But Castiel never wanted Claire to feel as if she needed to earn or fight for his attention, and he knew that an attentive and caring alpha was one to be biologically desired by omegas and betas.
"Dean?" He asked softly. "You do not need to be a koala anymore. I think, under different circumstances, you would be rather cute, but I believe that at this time it may help for you to be human."
Male omegas were not exactly common, so it took Castiel by surprise a little. He didn't have anything against male omegas, though (as some people did). Castiel did not think that the fact that the man was an omega would really make a difference, even though it may not be the more traditional route.
Castiel and Claire ate dinner at the counter in the kitchen. Castiel made a big deal of how gooey and stretchy the cheese was to make Claire giggle.
Castiel blinked several times, startled by the command for a couple of reasons. Firstly, he hadn't been expected to be order by this angel, a nobody as far as he could tell, when Castiel was such a highly respected soldier and commander. Secondly, even though Castiel didn't have the best understanding on social etiquette outside of military hierarchies and such, he did know that scenting someone, a stranger or acquaintance even, was rude and completely bizarre. Scenting was an intimate act reserved for close friends, family, and lovers. It was almost on par with grooming another's wings. To say that Castiel was taken aback would be an understatement.
“Hold up.” Dean interrupted when he caught a sudden whiff of paper and oak. He sniffed. “You guys smell that?”
They stood embracing one another for several long moments before wordlessly deciding to go talk with Claire.
"You're really fucking distracting, you know that?" Dean groused, sounding strangled. "You know it's probably not even that late. We haven't even had dinner."
That answer had always seemed to satisfy Claire before. At least, Castiel had thought so. Claire had nodded and smiled at them, and then assured them that she loved them both more than anything in the world and she felt very happy even without a mom. She had never asked about it again.
"You are exceptionally powerful." Castiel said. "I can sense it. It's why the demons would be intent on capturing you."
He got out of the car and then went around to release Claire from her car seat. She held his hand again as she skipped to the front door.
“It’s just difficult,” Dean admitted, not really meaning to speak at all, “I miss my brother a lot.”
"I feel uncomfortable." Castiel said. "I don't feel my grace, though, so I wouldn't know that the evilness here is harming it."
"Hey, sweetheart," Castiel said, "I have to go somewhere tonight, and Dean can't watch you. Do you want me to try Uncle Gabriel?"
“You’re so fucking sappy, Cas.” He mumbled, but Castiel could tell by Dean’s scent that his mate was pleased.
Just as Castiel was about to call for a nurse, the vibrations stopped and Jack let out a cry. Castiel tried calming him, but Jack wiggled in Castiel’s hold, his nose twitching furiously. His pup-scent went bitter with frustration and need. His eyes darted around the room in a way that Castiel hadn’t seen before.
They opened the stockings first, which were mostly just stuffed with random knick-knacks and sweets. Then it was on to the real gifts. Everyone had gotten one gift per person, so they opened gifts based on whoever the gifter was, all at once. It was very casual and Dean appreciated it. He insisted his gifts be opened last, so after everyone else’s had been opened, Dean passed out his own.
Castiel positioned himself in the dining room and waited patiently for Dean to enter. Claire pawed at his legs for attention, but Castiel didn’t look down at her.
Perhaps the angels would not react so negatively. Michael was a fair leader, he might understand the situation and how Dean's role in the war would finally bring peace.
Dean shivered and kissed Castiel again. Then, he opened the backdoor and started pulling Castiel towards the bedroom.
The diner steadily fills up until Dean is constantly between tables. He knows the other waitresses hate it when it’s busy, but Dean doesn’t mind the hustle so much. It makes him feel good to be busy. On the other hand, when it’s busier Dean usually gets less tips ‘cause the customers have to wait longer. Dean gets really friendly to compensate.
This had been the best job Dean had ever had, and he’d gotten so attached to Claire and Cas. He didn’t want to give it up. Sure, he’d lose a lot of money, but mostly Dean wanted to keep Claire and Cas in his life. Adam loved Claire, and even Sam enjoyed visiting after classes.
Dean turned back around when his coughing lightened off, and Castiel gasped and jerked towards Dean. His heart pounded forcefully.
"He's really good with kids, though." Charlie quickened to add. "That's why he became a nanny. He's never been arrested or anything, there's nothing on his record. It's just difficult for him to find anything other than babysitting work or a temporary job because he doesn't have any credentials."
The nurse moved around him and checked his blood pressure and his pupils. She had him answer some questions. Eventually she decided he was down from his rage.
“That doesn’t even make any sense.” Sam said with an aggravated sigh. “I’m going to go do work. You can bake your stress out.”
Castiel slipped Jack into Dean’s waiting arms. He felt a burst of warmth within his chest at the sight of Dean and Jack together. Dean gave Jack a hesitant bounce.
He walked to the other side of the bed and hesitantly climbed in. His heart started to speed up with the proximity and intimacy of the situation. Thankfully, Castiel didn’t seem to notice.
After lunch, they went to the Haunted Mansion. Once again, Castiel and Dean paired up and once again Castiel held Dean’s hand.
Castiel had no time to think about what Alastair would do, when the demon came stalking in. He leered at Dean from the hall and only smiled at Castiel when the angel growled and moved forward.
“You are nothing like John, Dean.” Castiel said, voice firm. “I promise you, you will be so amazing at this.”
Warmth touched his hand, catching Castiel's attention and causing him to glance at his hand. Dean's hand was grasping his. Castiel looked up and found the other angel staring at him, concerned. Castiel gave a small nod and looked forward.
"Not at all." Charlie said. "I just got done with this stupid conference call, anyways. It's my break time and my schedule is light today. Plus, I'm the boss of this department, so what can they do?"
"Shut up!" Castiel roared and flung himself forward with such momentum that he broke away from the demon guards' holds and went stumbling into Alastair, taking them both down. Castiel immediately flared his wings and began to swing his fists at Alastair's face.
"C'mon, Claire-bear," Gabriel cleared his throat, "let's get you inside so your dad doesn't get late."
When it was time for bed, Castiel found Claire sleeping in his bed, again. He only sighed and moved to get ready.
"Hey, you're a busy man, I get it." Dean said. "Claire doesn't get it, though. You're going to have to make it up to her. She'll probably be upset for a while."
"What's all this?" Castiel asked curiously, gesturing to Dean and the tarp. Dean stood and stretched.
"I don't care where I get settled down." Dean said, sounding frustrated. "I just thought that you would be there."
Castiel drove up to the hospital entrance. Luckily, there were nurses hanging around outside that were willing to help Dean inside while Castiel parked the car.
Slowly his other senses cleared. He felt grass, surprisingly soft, beneath him. There was a light breeze drifting through his wings. The sun was warm against his face. It smelled flowery, like a meadow.
They went back to the house after the wine tasting, spent some time ‘refreshing,’ then rejoined one another for dinner.
"Because, Dean, if a customer sees you as a bird and returns and sees you as something else, it may lead to questions."
“One second.” Castiel reached for his things and shoved them into his bag, which was kind of difficult with one hand but he wasn’t about to let go. He grabbed his bag and slung it over one shoulder.
Dean silently followed Castiel around all morning as Castiel tended to his garden. He entered Castiel's shed with Castiel and watched as the witch carved more figurines. It felt odd to know that there was someone watching him, but Castiel continued to ignore Dean. He thought that the familiar must've been bored, but Dean never complained.
Castiel’s nostrils flared and his lips parted. Dean prepared himself for whatever wrong and delicious thing the alpha was about to say.
Dean settled into his warmth and looked up. There was a small break in the treetops where they could see the stars. It still wasn't as beautiful as in Heaven, but it still helped to ease Castiel.
“I like to think that pre-law could include a lot of reading between the lines.” Sam says, shrugging. “And it doesn’t take a therapist to figure out what you’re thinking, Dean, you’re more of an open book than you realize.”
"I'm sorry." Castiel said once they were alone. Dean's bare skin was against his chest as they laid on their sides, broken only by Dean's wings. Castiel's wings were wrapped against Dean's.
Dean licked his lips and nodded. “That’s cool. I, uh, I’m bi. It’s one of the reasons my dad and I don’t really get along.”
Castiel let Jimmy drag him out of the hallways and off of campus. He looked at his shoes as he walked and kicked at things on the sidewalk, all the while Jimmy chattered in his ear.
The forests in hell looked the same as those of the other realms, except for the fact that there were no sounds of life. No owls hooted or insects buzzed. Even throughout the day, there were no bird songs. Only the low voices and murmurs of the demons were heard, along with the crackling of the fire. It was rather eery.
This gave Dean pause. He knew that his close relationship with his own brother was not often replicated in the families of royals, and the last thing that Dean would want to do would be get Castiel in trouble with the Prince of Novak because he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. Dean would never be truly upset with Sam for running his mouth about Dean, but there was no telling with Gabriel.
“No, I don’t.” Dean lied, for no reason other than he didn’t like when Sam made accurate observations about him.
“‘Cause of pheromones, Dean.” Sam said. “We emit scented pheromones. You can tell someone’s designation. Well, you can tell as long as they’re not wearing scent blockers.”

“Dean Winchester,” Charlie said, “Are you telling me that you think women are less because they can have kids and in the past they were always the caretakers?”
Around noon the trees thinned excessively until they came to a tree line and a wide field lay in front of them. Past the field was a gorge, and past the gorge was another field that led to a different forest. The rocky gorge lay that in front of them separated Hell from Earth. To get to Earth they would have to travel down into the gorge and then climb back on the other side. It wasn't terribly deep or wide, but it would still take much of their time and energy to get across. Wooden and stone remnants of long-destroyed bridges could be seen along the edge of Hell's side, a harsh reminder of the demons' multiple attempts to make their access to Earth easier.
Castiel breathed out deeply and turned to look at his husband. Dean’s head was bowed and he still hadn’t moved from the center of the room.
After pie, Dean set the kids and Sam up with Finding Nemo while he cleaned up the kitchen and did the dishes.
"Dean is a familiar." Castiel said again. "He stumbled onto my property and I offered him a place to stay. In return, he formed a temporary bond with me. I did not realize this at the time, but he was running away from Michael because Michael had forced him to form a permanent bond. Michael followed him here, and we ended up fighting."
"He wore something on top of them?" While not uncommon, it was still uncomfortable to wear clothing on top of wings. The fabric tended to rub feathers the wrong way.
“No, Cas, it’s fine!” Dean interrupted, expression sheepish and scent nervous. He raised a hand to scratch the back of his neck. “Actually, I didn’t drink any of it.”
"Does that happen?" Castiel asked. "Do people truly wish for a permanent bond but not go through with it?"
"Sometimes." Dean said, his face still red. "It can get kind of uncomfortable to go without changing for a while."
Castiel also kept an ear out to what the demons were saying. They had their own language, as the angels did (though angels also thought their ancestral language to be sacred, and only spoken in the most special or important occasions). The demonic tongue consisted of growls, snarls, hisses, snaps, and other violent, foul-sounding words. Castiel was a little rusty, but he had always been proficient at the language before, so he make out most of what was being said.
Castiel always became flustered and bashful Dean flirted with him, but Dean had believed that Castiel was merely unused to the attention and was easily fazed by such regard. He hadn’t suspected that Castiel might actually feel something for Dean.
"Dean, hurry and open mine." Castiel looked down the hallways of the dungeons. He didn't see any demon, but better safe than sorry.
The demons only chatted to each other as they left. Castiel waited until he knew they were gone and far away before he approached the shared bars.
Castiel made his way to his office to work a bit more. He was happily surprised with the events of the day. He didn't dare get his hopes up, though. A few of the other nannies had looked promising at first, but sooner or later they all were driven away by Claire's behavior. There were still two whole days before the weekend, anyways. That was plenty of time for Dean to quit.
"No." Castiel shook his head. "If you like, you can have Adam and Sam come over while you watch Claire."
okay I liked this chapter too and I was a little inspired by the scene from the Office when Jim proposes to Pam and a whole lot inspired by CadenceImperfect so thank you v much Cadence ily
“Even if she thought she’d make a horrible mom, how come she didn’t stick around to at least visit me?”
“I mean, he was ridiculously possessive of you before you guys were dating, did you expect that to change?”
Her tone was teasing, so Dean knew she wasn’t upset about the early morning, but Dean would still make sure to buy her a coffee.
"I own a novelty shop." Castiel answered. "A few of the townspeople enjoy it, though I get mostly tourists."
Apparently Cas was thinking the same thing, because he withdrew his arms slowly and clenched his jaw.
Castiel’s guide back to Dean’s room was much quieter and quicker than the original garden tour. Dean didn’t mind too much. He loved talking with Castiel, of course, but in light of recent events he had much to contemplate.
"No." Gabriel said, sounding sad. "That's like saying if you still had a drop of blood left in your body you should be able to recover. You need a certain amount to survive."
"I think I do." Gabriel answered. "I don't know much on bonds, but I've had my fair share of temporary ones. Your bond broke because you were taking too much of his magic, right?"
This had been a terrible idea. Dean was going to be rejected and left without his only friend in this kingdom. He would likely be punished when Castiel told the King and, God, what if the King punished Castiel, too?
The end of the quarter came much quicker than Castiel expected. One week, he was celebrating with Dean over their pair of ‘A’s on the latest calculus test, the next minute Dean was talking about his plans for spring break.
Alastair's slimy smirk returned. He winked at Castiel and nodded to the guards. Two of them left the dungeons.
"Eyes over here, bucko." Gabriel said. It was so familiar and annoying that Castiel almost rolled his eyes as he looked back at his brother. "Who even is that guy?"
"You're right." Dean's voice was breathless and in awe. He'd moved to the front of his cell and was observing the lock.
Dean was tall, likely taller than Castiel. He had plain fabric shirt and pants, both torn and dirty. He had brown-blonde hair and broad shoulders. Castiel could tell he had been muscled and fit at one point, perhaps from field work or construction, before his capture. It made him ache deep inside himself to see the omega in this place. Dark bruises littered Dean's skin and red marks, almost bite-like, covered his throat. Castiel did not catch a look at Dean's face, but he imagined it would be as exquisite as the rest of him. His bowlegs trembled as he walked, no doubt he was severely weakened. Behind him beautiful tawny wings were dragged along, their feathers wilted and dulled.
"Papa, let's go!" Claire shouted. Mr. Novak glanced over his shoulder at the doorway. He looked back at Dean and nodded, then he left. Dean followed him to Claire in the living room.
Castiel stared after him, heart sinking horribly in his chest. Sickness started uncurling itself in his stomach.
Dean's eyes were wide and illuminated in the moonlight. He looked worried and Castiel could feel the concern rolling off of him through their bond.
A much bigger voice replied, easily overshadowing Dean’s concerns and leaving him a longing and frustrated mess.
Charlie led them to the check-in area, and an employee showed them to the entrance of Star Wars Land.
The book that he had been reading was still in his bedroom, so Castiel chose a random one from his bookcase. He tried to immerse himself in reading, but for the first time ever, Castiel was unable to find interest in the book. He was far more interested in learning more about Dean and where the familiar came from. Castiel briefly considered calling Gabriel to alert him of the situation, but he remembered how suspicious Dean had been about other witches, so he decided against it.
“Maybe, but not always. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, Dean, for the two of you to like each other and-”
Dean threw back his head and laughed. Castiel was absolutely drawn to the carefree, joyful expression. His own face began to heat up.
Castiel had absolutely no idea where to start looking for a new nanny. If Anna truly posted about Claire, it would be nearly impossible to get a qualified nanny. Perhaps Castiel should try a babysitter, but he felt that that nannies were a more permanent option.
“Anyways, it’s probably for the best. I doubt the King would take the elopement of his Intended and his General and cousin very well. I don’t want to wish you any punishment.”
After staring into the fridge for fifteen minutes, Castiel gave up. He never seemed to have an appetite anymore, and he knew he’d lost more weight. Ellen was worried, she’d said so multiple times, but Castiel couldn’t bring himself to eat when he wasn’t hungry.
“I don’t know.” Dean said. “I’m just so fucking terrifed that I screwed everything up because I couldn’t keep it in my pants. Plus, Dad’s been a fucking handfull.”
Castiel gripped the side of the boat as Balthazar untied it from the dock and started it up. The first few minutes were not that bad as they got out of the marina, but once they passed the “No Wake” zone, they took off.
Dean loved it. He could work during the day, and he got all of the chores of the day done while Sam and Adam were in school. It was much easier to drive Sam around and take care of Adam after school was over. Some days, Dean didn't have anything to do, so he was starting to figure what kind of hobbies he had. So far, all Dean knew was that he like to take walks on the beach. It wasn't very original, but he enjoyed it a lot.
Castiel was so ashamed that he was unable to fall asleep for the remainder of the night and early morning. He tried to distract himself with reading, but all he could think of was how Dean felt in his dream, writhing and moaning and clutching onto Castiel.
It was already dark when Castiel and Charlie exited the building, and a bitter chill enveloped them. The parking lot was well lighted, but Castiel still walked Charlie to her car to be safe. He waved at her as he entered his own car and she drove away.
Their dinner was very lovely. Dean told Castiel about his day, as he always did. Dean loved being a kindergarten teacher, and Castiel loved seeing his mate so passionate. Dean told Castiel about the new student in his class and how three other students had made it their mission to spend time with the new kid. Dean beamed as he recounted the story, and Castiel enjoyed his mate’s happiness just as much as he did the story.
have you." Castiel declared, his own voice sounding strange to his ears. It was deeper and echoing, almost like it was layered.
The door to the hall opened with a slam, and Castiel saw Dean flinch from the corner of his eye. Four demons guards, each holding warded chains and weapons, entered the hall. They opened Dean's cell first, and the omega obediently held out his wrists for them to chain. One demon held a blade up to Dean's neck, making Castiel snarl, and nodded towards the other three. They opened the door to Castiel's cell and held out the chains expectantly. The threat was clear: if Castiel acted out, Dean would pay the price.
A sudden and hard shove against his back had him toppling over the side of the boat and into the water with a shout.
"Sure." Dean paused near a drinking fountain and dialed Mr. Novak's number. The busy signal sounded almost immediately, so Mr. Novak was probably still on the phone. Dean sent him a text anyways.
This one was the one that Dean was most uncertain about. He was pretty sure it had the biggest drop of the Disneyland Park rides and that made him nervous.
“Gonna make some breakfast.” Dean answers. He can’t help but sneak a quick kiss. “You can go back to sleep.”
"Sheesh, don't hold back." Dean said to her, grinning. "Alright, well, I should go. I'll see you tomorrow, Claire. You too, Mr. Novak."
It wasn't the explanation that Castiel had been expecting, but it certainly made sense. It explained why Dean had not immediately revealed himself as a familiar and why he had been so guarded around Castiel.
“Aye-Aye, Captain.” Balthazar tipped his head. Castiel watched as he got back into the car and drove off. He would be staying at a hotel for the weekend.
The Castle of Novak was not especially interesting. It was like any castle that Dean had visited. The gardens leading up to the castle, however, were very beautiful. Dean could only imagine how gorgeous the private gardens in the back must be and he looked forward to exploring them.
Castiel. I will tear him, rip him piece by piece until he is nothing blood and bones. The longer that he stands in front of you, the longer I will force him to live in pain and agony until I kill him. Even after he begs, I will deny him death."
“I see.” Dean said. “At least you’re kept in the court, though, right? I’m assuming Charles assigned you a position, and if you’re still here then that means Lucifer hasn’t kicked you out yet to prevent competition.”
After the tour of the property, they returned to the house to a lunch prepared for by maids, though it was presented to them by Mrs. Kelly. From there it was a twenty minute drive through beautiful vineyards to the wineries. Castiel wasn’t much of a wine-drinker, he wasn’t much of any-type-of-alcohol drinker, but he went along with the group and did his best to act like he was enjoying himself.
Castiel did not want to hurt Dean, but he also wanted to make sure that Dean was cared for as much as he should be.
natural life and beauty, but he did not say that. It felt odd, inappropriate maybe, to say such a tender and emotional thing out loud. Also, Castiel thought that Dean might be disturbed by this and he would hate to make Dean uncomfortable.
“Punishment?” Castiel asked, brows furrowed. “The King would not punish us for something like this. He would understand.”
Dean purred softly and twisted under Castiel's hand so Castiel was petting more of his side. Castiel made the mistake of petting Dean's stomach. He got a warning nip in return and pulled his hand back a bit. Dean purred again and rubbed his head against Castiel's leg. A bead of drool exuded from the edge of Dean's mouth. Castiel expected to find this repulsive, but since Dean was a cat it was surprisingly enduring.
“I’m peachy.” Dean answered, voice cracking like he was a fucking adolescent. “Have fun with your gardening.”
“Bye, guys.” Dean said. He shot Cas one more smile, hopefully not appearing as flustered as he felt, and then dashed off, his heart pounding madly in his chest.
“How long was I asleep?” Castiel asked, rubbing his eyes. He was still very tired, but he felt more rested than he had been for a while.
"I'm tired of this petty little war. I'd rather we just split into our separate Hell and Heaven once again, leave Earth as it's own realm. This war has gone on for millennia. Can you even remember why it started?"
He tries not to act any differently now that he's discovered he enjoys Cas’s presence, but he can’t help but be a little nervous. It’s ridiculous, really, but Dean doesn’t really have any other friends (or romantic interests) and he doesn't want to mess anything up.
"Yeah, of course." Dean cleared his throat as he stood. He was holding to the boy's hand. "Adam, say hi to Mr. Novak."
"Castiel," Naomi said sharply, "you do not have the privilege of taking forever to adjust and find a new mate. With every day that you remain separated from Amelia and without a mate, our family's image tarnishes. This isn't just about you, Castiel. You just think of your brothers and their families as well. Do not be selfish."
"Mrow." Dean brushed his head hesitantly against Castiel's arm and tilted his head. Castiel could feel his concern across their bond.
Cas would think that Dean couldn’t keep it in his pants. He was going to think that Dean didn’t take his job seriously. He’d fired Dean, and Dean would lose Claire and one of his closest friends.
"Okay." Castiel handed over the printed-out tickets. Dean and Claire whispered their goodbyes and left. Castiel sighed and resigned herself to listening to April.
“Just fine,” Dean replied, tongue sticking out of his mouth as he concentrated, “These car seat buckles are like a dang puzzle.”
“That’s the other thing,” Sam said, shifting from one foot to the other, “I’m pretty sure there aren’t any supernatural beings in this universe.”
Castiel pushed the door open and peered our. There was a hallway in front of him, but no signs of guards. Castiel shut the door softly behind himself and then padded down the hallway, alert and on edge. There were three other doors, but Castiel had no interest in opening them until he figured out where the hallway led.
Castiel frowned at him. He hadn't noticed the slip of Dean's tongue, and it honestly did not bother him.
"You would've rather been alone, though." Castiel said. "You didn't have that as an option, and I wasn't able to ask if you wanted me."
“Me too.” He said quietly. “But you’re going to be an amazing parent, Dean. You’re already so great with your students.”
"Dean, listen to me." Castiel forced himself into Dean's space, if only to grab the familiar's attention. "I would rather die than let him have you."
Castiel put his name in. He was a little early for the reservation, so Castiel decided to wait for April outside. There were a few nice chairs in front of the restaurant so that the customers could wait.
Castiel watched the nurse leave. Gabe peaked in not two minutes later and offered Castiel a hesitant smile.
"I don't know." Dean mused. "I think he really wants the war to end. Why would he give us false information."
without relief for what must have been years. He spent that part of his dream screaming and begging for relief and staring at himself in a mirror as he was brutally torn apart. In the second part of his dream, it was Dean who was torturing others. More than that, Dean was enjoying the pain he was inflicting.
Just that since Chuck had gone bye-bye, Dean had found it harder and harder to suppress his… feelings.
Castiel easily sidestepped John and shoved him to the ground when John lost his balance. John went tumbling down. Castiel leaned over him.
Castiel find himself awakening in a dimly lit room. At first he panicked, thinking he'd been captured by the demons again. But as Castiel floundered around, he realized had he was not restrained by anything and his grace was fully in his grasp. His wings felt odd. Castiel realized that it was because his wings had been properly rebandaged.
No matter how many years went by, Ellen’s compliments and mothering always got to Castiel in the best way.
also in this verse angels molt and groom and stuff but like... idk if any of y'all have ever plucked your eyebrows or something but it HURTS so plucking feathers that aren't old or brittle hurts a lot while plucking old feathers or ones that need to be removed would be a relief
“That’s such a lie!” Claire shouted and stood suddenly. She paced across the room, fuming. “She would have stayed still, I know it! It doesn’t matter if she didn’t feel ready! She would have stayed to see me on weekends, or on my damn birthday at least! The only reason she wouldn’t have stayed would be if she didn’t want me, which means that she didn’t love me!”
"Ellen?" Dean rasped. Ellen moved over to him and wrapped him in a hug. Dean looked stiff for a moment, then he started hugging Ellen back. His eyes closed and he rested his head on Ellen's shoulder, the tension bleeding from his shoulders.
Dean shifted, discomfort growing in their bond. Castiel had to consciously keep his own despair from responding to Dean's emotions. He had hoped that it would be different from Dean, but it was the same. As soon as Castiel lost control of himself and displayed how truly broken he could be, his company grew uncomfortable and left. It's what many of his 'friends' had done.
Dean paused when he heard the door unlock and open, and Cas’s pleasant scent filtered into the room.
"I'm going to the zoo with Claire tomorrow." Castiel answered. "We haven't been able to spend much time together lately."
"Don't be ridiculous." Castiel scoffed. "Even if there was something that I wanted, I have to think of the company and the family."
Dean's nose twitched. He watched Castiel closely as he moved forward so he was standing on Castiel's lap. Dean looked away, then he curled himself up.
Dean let out a huff. He really did not want to go back to waitressing and bartending. He loved working with kids. The goal had always been to be a school teacher, but with Adam and Sam he didn’t have the time or money to go to night classes. He’d settled as a babysitter and occasional nanny, but even that was iffy at the best of times.
"Who is it?" Claire's voice demanded. Then Castiel's daughter was sticking her head out of the door and looking Dean up and down.
"Several years." Benny shrugged. "But Dean's wings had already transitioned from white to brown. They're a different brown now. The feathers are different."
Jimmy steered Castiel all the way home and into the house. He pulled Castiel’s backpack off of his shoulders and hung it up for him. Castiel must have looked really distressed for Jimmy to do all those things without mentioning it. His brother pushed him to the couch and sat him down. He put on a show that Castiel didn’t pay attention to as he continued to talk.
Dean's thin and groggy voice broke through Castiel's red-tinted, alpha phase. He looked at Dean and saw that the omega had pushed himself up so he was sitting. He look thin and sickly, much worse than Castiel had ever seen him.
Thunder rumbled in the not so far distance, causing Castiel to look up. Stormy clouds had rolled in while Castiel had been battling Michael, likely a byproduct of the enormous amounts of magic being released. It would be raining soon, which meant that Castiel needed to get Dean inside.
Dean chuckled. "Nah. I'm just visiting a friend during her break. She didn't have a chance to buy coffee, so I brought her some."
"I do not regret anything that transpired between us, Dean." He said. "In fact, I hope that we can do it again, sometime."
"Gabriel," he said gravely, "I am very glad that you are alive and well and that you have not betrayed the angels. I was hurt deeply when I thought I lost you."
He had meant for that to bring comfort to Dean, but all that Dean did was rubbed a hand over his face.
“Let him get some more sleep.” Someone said softly, and Castiel could only just pick it up. The words didn’t make sense to him, though.
“I’m glad you came to the library today. It’s not like I have your number or anything, and you left too early in class for me to give this to you.”
Castiel was incredibly flustered and pleased. He leaned into Dean’s space. “You too. You’re quite the catch.”
Castiel’s tongue felt thick in his mouth, “Of course, Dean, it was no problem. I’m glad to have gotten to know you.”
"My legs hurt." Dean answered in a whisper. "They're... injured, and I haven't walked this much in a really long time."
to follow the baby shower theme, but no one actually cared. In the end, everyone would eat their cupcakes, and whoever found a small plastic baby in their cupcake was predicted to have the next baby.
Castiel shook his head. "No, I do not think so. Our bond has also been destroyed, and whenever I try to reach out to Dean through it, it pains me."
"There must be something we can do!" Castiel said desperately, looking to his brother. "Gabriel, please!"
"Yes, Castiel. Three." She continued. "The divorce has had a great impact on our image, as Amelia's family was greatly respectable, and you are now a single father raising a pup."
“We pick things up, I guess.” Dean said. “Other merpeople spend more time with humans, so they kind of bring back human culture. I’ve been watching humans for years, but today, for the first time, I decided to investigate.”
“You have very wonderful students, Dean,” Castiel said, “It seems they are learning a lot from you.”
Dean’s mind went blank as Gabriel led him to the chapel within the castle. He barely noticed when he and Gabriel stopped in front of the chapel’s tall, wooden doors.
Finally, they came across a large window. The view was of the thick forest they had trekked through to get here. The sun shone low in the sky, and Castiel thought it was probably near sunset.
"I don't know if he is, Claire, I'm just saying that he might be. I don't know why he would be, it is not my place to inquire about it."
"You're not a freak." Dean snapped, voice fierce. "Don't matter that you look like a demon, you're not like those bastards."
“Please,” Dean tried, “Please, if something happens to me I need you to live for yourself too, Cas, and not just Jack.”
Castiel tried to look as pathetic and pleading as possible (and he was sure he was succeeding because he felt
"Mr. De is the bestest nanny ever! None of the other ones played outside with me, they only watched."
Okay I absolutely love isolated/powerful Cas and injured Dean who's still super cool and I also love writing dean as a ferret because I think ferrets are adorable
“Like is an understatement.” Castiel said. He chewed quietly for a couple of minutes, expression thoughtful. “How was your conference with Adam’s teacher?”
Castiel stayed silent. He was angry and anguished by the thought of his brother's presumed death. He hoped that Gabriel was truly alright. Castiel should be able to feel the loss of his brother, but since he was cut off from his conscious grace he had not sensed any other angels.
"You won't be alone in Heaven." He tried. "I will be there to help you get settled, and once I've gone back to commanding, there will be plenty of other angels to keep you company."
Castiel went to copy the forms and then he returned to give the copies to Dean. Dean put the forms away in his backpack and nodded to Castiel.
“By all means.” Gabe said, gesturing. “You actually woke up a few times to go to the bathroom and eat some pizza, but I doubt you remember it.”
But if the demons had planned for Castiel and Dean to escape, surely they would have made it easier.
"Strong." Castiel answered. "I'll devote all that I can into making sure you and the child are well-provided for."
Castiel bit his lip and shook his head. “I can only speculate on the rationale of Lucifer’s decision. Maybe the King felt lonely and thought that this would allow him to meet someone just as lonely as he is. Maybe he felt that this was what was expected of him. Maybe he wasn’t ready to become King, and the only thing he knows to do is follow in the steps of the King before him and pray he’s doing right by his people.”
The forest was just as Castiel remembered. It was silent but for the crunching of their own feet against the ground. Even under the shade it was hot. Hell was always hot.
Gabriel looked at him just long enough to make Dean start to squirm before he replied. “I know that the feeling is mutual. Anyways, I must be going now. I hope to see you again soon, but I’m rather unpredictable so there is no knowing when that will be. Pleasure meeting you, Prince Dean.”
Instead he says goodnight and Dean watches him leave, feeling an ache in his chest that he can’t describe.
Castiel drove to Gabriel's house and parked in the driveway. Then he made his way up to the front door and knocked.
"There is not much else that I do." Castiel said. "If the weather is exceptionally dry or rough, I will intervene a bit."
"I do not know." Castiel said, also sitting up. He inhaled deeply and found that Dean smelled very much like Castiel. It made Castiel grimace.
“Since you have no relatives or representatives of your kingdom present, I’ll be the one to walk you down the aisle.” He explained. “I am the closest relative to the King.”
"You're acting like an infant on purpose, Gabriel." Castiel growled. "It is not amusing in the least."
“You’re my top student.” she replied bluntly. “I think you would be an excellent tutor. This would also be a way for you to get community service hours.”
"Bullshit!" Castiel snarled. He threw the photo album on the ground and stormed forward, growing even more angry when Dean started to back up.
By the time Dean woke, Castiel was exhausted and full of anxiety. He couldn't bring himself to look Dean in the eye, even after Dean cooked him breakfast and greeted him with a sleepy "hello." Dean didn't seem to notice that Castiel was acting odd, probably because he was still waking up.
"Dean," Castiel whispered, glancing down at the unconscious familiar, "Please. I can't carry you like this."
Castiel opened his eyes slowly. They were at the side of a road and there were a few buildings in the distance, so it seemed they landed a couple of miles outside of the city.
Castiel had to resist shuddering at the thought. If Dean were in an accident like this past one, or one worse… Well, Castiel didn’t think he’d be able to survive it.
Castiel wondered if he should say something to Dean to relieve the tension, but would that make it worse?
“If you are okay with donating your lunch to Claire and the ducks, then I have no problem with it either.” The man said.
The third game was ‘Feed the Baby.’ This one was probably the one that most of their guests were looking forward to. Everyone participating received a baby bottle that had been filled with beer. The person who drank all the beer first would win.
Castiel closed his eyes and took a steadying breath. He wouldn't blame Dean if the familiar decided to leave.
While Balthazar steered them back towards land, Castiel helped Dean lay out on deck so Dean could dry his tail. He was just dry enough by the time Balthazar got them back to their deck, and Castiel was privileged to see Dean’s beautiful tail become two muscular bowlegs.
Jack moved his arms as much as he could. Castiel lifted Jack a little higher on Dean’s chest so Jack could reach Dean’s neck. Jack pressed his face to Dean’s scent gland and made muffled noises.
"I know those movies." Dean said. Adam (and even Sam, though he never admitted it) loved the Kung Fu Panda series.
"Incredible." Castiel breathed, crouching to get a better look. Dean stared back at him impassively. He sat down and curled his tail delicately around his paws.
“More losing than playing.” Charlie answered, finally sparing him a glance. “Jack keeps beating me. I think he’s cheating!” She looked back at him with a hard glare.
GUYS I'm done with school!!!!! (well sorta, I'm on summer break and I am taking a summer class but that's not for a while)
He hadn’t talked about this with April at all, they hadn’t even officially started courting. In hindsight he should have anticipated it. April had her degree in law, but she didn’t practice because of the views of her family. She would be expected to stay home a house-omega and take care of Claire and any other children they might have. Castiel would continue to go to work and come home to a house taken care of by his omega. It was what had happened with Amelia, until she left, and it would be no different with Castiel.
"Been asking myself that everyday, buddy." Dean sighed. Castiel wanted to ask what he meant, but he didn't.
They get to the Bunker in three hours. Immediately, Dean goes to his room and shuts the door. He lays on his bed for a while and stares up at the ceiling.
This has taken me a while and for that I apologize. A heads up - most likely I'll be updating every other week but I'll try to do it every week and stay punctual... Thank you for your patience!!!
They tripped and stumbled in the hallway, walking for what felt like miles until it opened up into a cave. Light shone in the distance, growing brighter as they walked onward. Finally, Castiel and Dean stumbled into open air.
Dean doesn’t say anything for a long time, but neither does Sam. He thinks that Sam’s waiting for Dean to break by either changing the subject or by saying something sentimental that he’ll quickly move on from.
Castiel's magic was familiar with Dean's by now and it was rather easy for Castiel to tap into it. Dean was powerful too, so Castiel could tend to his garden quicker than he had alone.
"I, uh, I can form the temp bond with you when you want." He said, a bit hesitantly. "I don't really know the process for that kind of bond, but I know it's different from a permanent bond." His last words sounded like a warning of sorts, like he expected Castiel to trick him into a permanent bond.
So, avoiding Castiel was part of avoiding the feelings that came with him, and avoiding accidentally proclamations of said feelings. Dean had absolutely no desire to think about why he grew so warm and flustered whenever Castiel so much as looked at him, let alone smiled or laughed at something Dean had said.
He could hear the music of the ceremony, but it was muffled and far away, like he was hearing it from underwater.
Once Claire had finished her cereal, Castiel got her to brush her teeth as he tried to comb out her hair. He was lucky she was so resilient to pain on her head, because those tangles were nasty to deal with and Castiel had to tug a bit to get them out. He wondered if he should look up a video on how to do it better since he was new to all this. Amelia had been the one to do Claire's hair before, and Castiel still hadn't seemed to get the hang of it.
Claire and Castiel stood in the doorway as Dean got Adam settled in his carseat and the three Winchesters left.
A burst of frustration and dread raced along the bond and Dean ducked his head, but not before Castiel saw the shine of tears.
“Well, I’m not going to try because school is for losers and nerds.” Dean replies. “They hit two-for-two with you.”
Castiel nodded. He had assumed that April would want children. Castiel would be lying if he said that it didn't lift his hopes a little. He and Amelia had always planned to have more children to give Claire siblings, but it hadn't had worked out.
The dungeon's door opened with a clang, and Castiel shot to his feet. He approached the bars and gripped them tightly.
"Not that I meant to imply you are a pet." He said. "I have never really been in the presence of a domestic animal, though. You act remarkably naturally as a cat."
Dean showed up on time. He gave Castiel a short ‘hello’ before he started taking out his notes and his book. Castiel focused more on actually tutoring than how much he did not like Dean. Their session ended up going well, which was both a relief and a frustration for Castiel. He’d decided to try not hating Dean, but he’d hated him for so long that it was impossible to completely get rid of those feelings in one day (plus, Castiel’s dignity was still recovering from his earlier apology).
"I know it's hard to understand, Adam." Dean said gently. "My new job is a really good opportunity, though."
“That could mean something else.” Dean argued. “This is a completely different universe, after all.”
The rest of the house was not as bad as Claire’s bathroom, which was to be expected. He worked on putting away random items and vacuuming. Dean kept the kitchen clean at all times, so there wasn’t much to do other than mop. He got into a bit of a cleaning frenzy, then was left with only Cas’s office and bedroom to clean.
Castiel looked back to his brother and took in a deep, strangled breath. He moved to face Michael, hands tense at his sides.
“Alrighty, one second.” She glanced down at her computer and typed away. “Your mate is just down the hall on the left, room 242.”
So Castiel spent the afternoon moping around. He ordered pizza for dinner with the hopes that Claire would eat with him, but she only snuck out of her room briefly to grab a slice before retreating back to her room, leaving Castiel alone to wallow in pity.
Gabriel stood next to the bed for a second longer, then he left the room again, dishes in hand. Castiel waited a few minutes for his brother's footsteps to fade, then he started shifting in his position at the foot of his bed. He more or less crawled on top of his bed until he was next to Dean, then he rolled onto his side. He propped his head up on a pillow and watched.
She was a grouchy mess in the morning, her hair sticking up every which way and extremely tangled. Dried drool was disgustingly crusted along her cheek.
He finished work without a hassle and was able to get home by 5:30. Both Claire and Dean were surprised to see him so early. The charity ball would be beginning at 7, so Dean would just be staying while Castiel was home.
the American public education system. He had downright hated it when he was in high school, but his views had changed a bit with age.
The week had gone by quickly. Sunday evening, he’d taken April on another dinner date. It had gone well. Castiel was starting to think he’d misjudged her at the beginning. They’d had an awkward start, but since their initial meeting things between them had relaxed much more. April was a clever and entertaining omega. She was an excellent listener, too, and Castiel liked to bond with her about their similar childhoods.
He kissed Castiel then, halting Castiel's brain in its tracks. Castiel started to kiss back just as Dean pulled away.
Castiel swallowed. "Gabriel is my brother, along with the other archangels. I cannot imagine that he would do such a thing."
Castiel rubbed a hand across his face, disposing of his tears, and then brought both hands to his lap.
“I can be serious for many minutes, actually, but only when it’s something worth being serious about.”
- that fucking angel was completely aware of why Dean had almost crashed. Cas was just toying with Dean.
Perhaps the most redeeming part of the night was when they brought out the dessert, a delicious tiramisu.
"No." Castiel scoffed, almost offended. "I can assure you they are strong and well. It is just an abnormality that you were able to pass with no resistance and without notice." Well, that was not completely true. The garden had notified Castiel, but the wards still should have felt something.
“Whoever sent us here knows a shit-ton about us.” Dean said. “It’s fucking creepy. What do they want?”
He found Dean in the tavern with Ellen and Jo. Ellen had served Dean a plate of eggs and bacon, and, embarrassingly, Castiel's stomach growled at the sight.
He went back into the living room, feeling heavier and more stressed than he had all the past week. He took out his phone and dialed Gabe’s number.
It relieved Castiel a little bit to get a positive reaction, but at the same time he felt even worse.
Dean frowned but nodded along. He and Castiel started north towards the edge of the meadow. The sun was still high in the sky, so they had to keep moving. Once they reached the woods, Dean helped to bind Castiel's wings with branches and vines in a terrible attempt at a cast. Hopefully his grace, now unblocked, would heal his wings quickly and correctly.
“Yes, Adam?” Dean asked tersely. He didn’t like being on edge with his pups, but he was very aggravated.
Dean stiffened at Castiel's side, fear bursting across the bond in a way that kicked Castiel's flight or fight instincts into action. He stepped towards Michael, shielding Dean from his brother's view. Michael rolled his eyes.
They walked back to Main Street. Dean didn’t care much for looking at the different shops, but Charlie and Jack really seemed to enjoy it, especially with all the sugar that was available.
“I see.” Charlie said, humming thoughtfully. “Well, if it makes you feel better, I sincerely doubt Castiel is going to fire you. And even if he does, he’d probably only do it because he has feelings for you or something, which he might. I don’t think he’s the type to sleep with someone just for a one night stand.”
"I don't have a lot of family members," Dean continued, "but this is the longest I've gone without them in a while."
It truly wasn’t that bad, but the concern and worry in Castiel’s scent only seem to increase. He quickly healed Dean’s finger with his grace.
"I don't think so." Dean rasped, rubbing a hand across his mouth and sitting back. "I think I'm just sick."
Dean's heart sunk just a little. He did want to watch Claire, but there was absolutely no way that he would work on Sunday. It was Adam's birthday. "Sorry. Don't think I can."
Obediently, Dean looked down at the ground and took Gabe’s arm. Gabriel guided him down the aisle. Each step was in beat with the thudding of Dean’s heart. The music rang from every direction and the amount of scent-blocking floral arrangements and perfumes used were making Dean’s head spin.
Castiel rounded on the nurse and snarled, relishing when she shrunk back and her scent sharpened fearfully.
Castiel relinquished his hold on Dean's magical reserve. He felt as the wave of Dean's power pulled away, though a residue bond was still leftover. It was thin and fragile, but it would allow Castiel to access Dean's magic whenever he needed it. It would fade with time, unless Castiel kept using it. If Castiel kept using it, it would grow with familiarity to Castiel's magic, but never to the extent of a permanent bond. Dean could break it off at any time without consequence.
“You know that it is okay, right? And you know that, no matter what, Sam will always love you. Jack, Charlie, and I, we care for you deeply and it doesn’t matter who you’re attracted to so long as you’re happy and-”
Castiel walked Dean through the routine he’d been doing with Jack. It made his heart feel swollen in the best of ways when he watched Dean talk to Jack and play with him.
I had planned to finish this in a month or two at the most, I did not plan for it to take the whole summer, but honestly I do not regret it
Sam scowled, and Gabe leaned against him and tilted his head so he was in Sam’s gaze when he smirked.
Castiel hummed thoughtfully. His instincts told him to go online and find someone who'd gone to college and who had a plethora of experience with this type of thing, but so far his instincts had led him to twelve nannies in the past three months. Perhaps he should change his point of view.
Castiel expected him to say more, but no words came. He busied himself with twiddling his fingers, bored out of his mind. He heard Dean's breathing even out, and he wondered how horrible the demons must've been to cause an angel to rest in a place like this. Angels were not infallible, they needed rest and nourishment from time to time, but they were self-sustaining, for the most part. It would be a few days at least until Castiel felt the beginning tendrils of exhaustion and malnourishment. Dean must've been through agony here.
Dean shoved past Castiel and stormed out before Castiel could stop him, leaving the alpha staring after him.
Castiel squinted his eyes and could make out Claire's small form sleeping in the center of Castiel's bed. How she'd managed to get past Castiel's office without him realizing it was beyond him, but he thought that maybe it could be a wake up call to be more alert in the future. She was facing towards him. One arm was clutched tightly around the honeybee stuffed animal that she'd been in love with since she'd been a baby. The other arm was angled towards her head so she could suck her thumb.
The two started to make their way down into the gorge, but it was extremely difficult. The only trail was hazardously narrow. On one side was the gorge wall, full of jutting sharp rocks and boulders to dodge, and on the other side was a steep cliff. They could only fit one at a time, and their wings made everything even more complicated.
"No." Dean answered. "My dad got mad every time I mentioned my mom after she died, so I only know what I remember from before."
"Do you mind if I make some food?" Gabriel asked. "I'm kinda hungry and I'm guessing you're hungry too. It couldn't have been easy to fight Michael. I saw what you did to him, looked bad."
Castiel said nothing as Dean drifted off to sleep. He stared straight ahead, alert, as he thought over their conversation.
Pain coursed through his wings and made Castiel gasp. They were too sore and weak for this. Their descent had slowed considerably, but they were still falling. Castiel needed to try to glide them as far away as possible before he was forced to land.
Dean would have been touched if he wasn’t so excited to write a letter to Sammy. He was going to tell him everything.
Castiel let out a shuddering breath. “I’ve gotten over it. Mostly. I was never really close with my parents. They weren’t at home much and something about their love and affection towards me always felt conditional. I can’t say I was completely surprised, but it still hurt.”
Their dinner conversation was mostly just Gabe talking, since everyone else was too shocked to say anything more. They decided against dessert since there was an ice-cream place that Gabe insisted they go to.
That was true. Gabriel had always been childish. An aching pain shot through Castiel's chest and he grimaced. His scent must of soured, because Dean shifted towards their shared bars.
Dean flounders for his phone and practically tosses it at the poor man. Cute Guy takes his phone easily and starts typing in his contact info. He gives it back to Dean when he’s done and Dean instantly checks his messages. Cute Guy has sent himself a message so that he can have Dean’s number. Dean reads over Cute Guy’s contact.
"I don't think I've met such a dedicated alpha before." April said. "It's really sweet how caring you are."
Castiel caught himself glancing at the clock more often than he normally did, and he realized it was because he was waiting for the day to be over so that he could eat dinner with Dean and spend more time with the familiar. Their relationship had taken a very drastic, and positive, turn, and Castiel was excited to explore it.
doing here?” Cas’s voice is low and threatening. It sends shivers down Dean’s spine (not in a good way), and has him instinctively turning off the stove and reaching for the bat he keeps near the counter. He goes to the door, hands tightening around the baseball bat.
Thirty minutes before he was due at the restaurant, Castiel drove Claire to Gabriel's house. He unbuckled her from the car seat and let her run to the door to ring the doorbell. Immediately after, she squished herself up against the wall and out of sight from someone looking straight out the front door. When Gabriel opened the door, Claire flung herself in front of him and shouted "boo!" Castiel did not think that Gabriel was scared or shocked at all, but he brother played it off and grasped at his chest.
"Of course I want to win the war!" He snapped. "You think that I want the demons to rule over Heaven and Earth? Do you want that?"
“Yeah, I do.” Charlie replied. “But trust me, Dean, they won’t care at all, okay? Sam probably knows already anyway.”
"I think I can handle the little miss." Dean said with a confident grin. "I've taken care of crazy children. Trust me, they were wild."
In the end, it was a close match between Bobby, Gabe, and Jo. Bobby came first, Jo was second, and Gabe was third. Jo’s apparent beer drinking ability did raise some questions from Ellen, much to everyone’s amusement.
Castiel took a step forward, then nearly toppled under the force of his grace rushing to him. He understood how Dean had fallen, it was intense. Castiel leaned heavily against the bars of the cell and panted as his power flared within him. Dean had been separated from him grace for years, so Castiel could only imagine how overwhelming it must've been for him. Dean was right, though. His grace was still partially blocked.
Dean let out his breath slowly as he continued along with the impromptu staring contest. He didn’t always stare back at Cas (because usually this forced him to think about confusing emotions that were better left buried in the back of his subconscious), but today was different.
Gabriel was quiet and Castiel marveled at the fact that a simple admission of his feelings had rendered his chatty brother speechless.
Next to them, the priest intoned on with the ceremony, but Dean’s focus was solely on the alpha in front of him.
this chapter was pretty short and very late and I am sorry, the chapters will probably come every other week, but I'll do my best to update on time
“My God, you two are annoying.” Balthazar drawled. “I want to go back to shore so I can get a drink while you weirdos flirt it out.”
The rollercoaster’s car had seats in pairs this time, so Dean ended up sitting next to Castiel instead of in front of him. They were in the middle seat, Charlie and Jack were in the front, and Sam was in the back with some random stranger.
Two hands grasped tightly onto Castiel shoulders and forced him to look up. He met Gabriel's panicked gaze.
“Because I didn’t realize it was him that I would be tutoring,” Castiel explained. “I must have horrible karma to be stuck tutoring Dean Winchester.”
Dean breathes in deeply, then exhales slowly. “I wake up from nightmares a lot, except I’m pretty sure they’re memories. There’s always blood, or something. Sometimes it’s my own, but usually it’s not. It feels so real, Cas. I don’t know why, but sometimes in my dream I’m - I’m
Amazing couldn't even begin to describe how soft Dean's lips were and how sweet they tasted against Castiel's tongue. His hands slipped from Dean's collar and traveled down to his hips to grip at the skin there. Dean fingers tugged at Castiel's hair.
They stared at one another for a moment, the air between them awkward and tense. Castiel realized, a bit belatedly, that Dean's sweet scent was because he was an omega.
“I don’t know how I feel about this situation. I don’t know how long I’ll be mad at you. But what I do know is that I still love you, and right now I really want to kiss you.”
The nearest nail salon was also a hair salon, and, immediately after entering, Castiel realized that it had primarily female clientele. Castiel was the only male there. Well, there was one other, but it was a younger-looking boy who was playing on his phone next to an older woman Castiel assumed was his mother.
About a month after Dean had joined Castiel, Castiel found himself waking up from a dream. It was far from the nightmares that normally plagued him. This dream had been a bit more... inappropriate. Castiel had woken gasping and heated from the remnants of his dream.
Balthazar laughed and shook his head. Castiel leaned against the door and stared out the window as they drove. He was quiet for the trip, just listening to Balthazar’s wild tales of his weekend.
Dean glanced over at the angel. Castiel’s brows were furrowed, like he was thinking hard about something.
Castiel’s eyes opened slowly. He blinked owlishly a couple of times, then his eyes focused on Dean and his pupils dilated.
"My energy is severely depleted." Castiel said quietly. "Fighting Michael was... exhausting, to say the least."
“I noticed your friend glancing my way.” Cute Guy intones. His voice is deep and slightly monotone but it’s also fucking hot.
Hesitantly, Castiel touched Dean’s caudal fin again. As before, Dean jerked. This time, though, he started laughing.
"I ran away from home a year ago." Dean's deep voice broke through the silence. He hadn't looked up from the charms he was playing with in his hands. "My brother and uncle, they wanted me to stay, but I snuck away."
Castiel knew he couldn’t let Ellen take Jack. He’d fade away without a purpose, and he couldn't let that happen, not right then. Definitely not when Jack would still be needing him.
“Yeah,” Sam answered, “It’s not nearly as reliable, though. Plus, there’s way less stuff. Some people claim to encounter creatures, but it’s pretty obviously fake.”
Claire's bottom lip wobbled and she looked up at him with big, tear-filled eyes. Wordless she nodded. Castiel crawled over to her and pulled her onto his lap. She snuggled against him and wrapped her short arms around him.
“Sure.” Dean shrugged. “When mers dry out their tails, they turn to legs. It’s how mers hang out with humans so much without being caught. Plus, I wanna spend more time with you.”
"Don't say another thing about him!" Dean snapped. He looked to Castiel. "I don't care, Cas, you know that."
"There's a spell that will allow you to channel your conscious into Dean's subconscious so that you can communicate - if there's anything left to communicate with. You'll have to heal your bond somehow, maybe by forming a permanent bond."
Castiel took a deep breath and turned away. “I’m going to retire in the antechamber tonight. I tricked you into a marriage, I won’t force you into anything more. If you never want to speak to me, or even see me, I understand. I can arrange for us to have separate rooms as well, if that is what you wish. I’m so sorry.”
"I suppose I could make more of an effort." Castiel said. "It's difficult, though, trying to handle all these things at once."
Castiel didn't like to think about it. His strength was slipping away, and with it, the chance of escaping.
Castiel wavered with uncertainty, but at Dean’s glare he stood. He gave Dean a quick kiss before leaving the room and jogging back to the waiting room.
“Well, you’re named after an angel, buddy, so I don’t think you’ve got any room to judge.” The mermaid replied.
“Would you like to join me for lunch?” Castiel asked. He looked so damn hopeful that Dean didn’t have the heart to tell him no, despite the fact that he was supposed to be avoiding him.
"Nah, takes more than a few measly demons to take me down." Dean smiled and patted Sam's shoulder. "Cas got me out. This is Cas, by the way."
"I think that another thank you is in order." Castiel said. "I had no idea that angels interacted with humans in such a way, and I am shocked that you would still rescue us. Thank you."
Cas cut him off again by pulling Dean into a hug. Dean tensed at first, but then he linked his arms around Cas’s hips and allowed himself to settle into Cas’s shoulder.
Dean left the door partially open so he could listen to the kids play as he cleaned up around the house. Technically, cleaning the house was not really part of his job description, but it helped Dean to keep his mind off of the afternoon and it allowed him some time to relax.
As soon as Halloween had passed it seemed that everyone was ready for Christmas, which was absolutely ridiculous, in Dean’s opinion. Gabe was especially annoying, always blasting Christmas music and eating candy canes and putting lights up in the house the fucking
“Yes, of course!” Castiel interrupted. He threw out his hand. “I’d love to hold your hand, and to go out with you.”
This time it was Gabe who won the game, having only missed one flavor. He shamelessly told them that he enjoyed the taste and texture of baby food.
The koala's arms were wrapped tightly around Castiel's forearm and his head was pressed against Castiel's chest. Castiel shifted Dean and moved his arms carefully so that Dean's small paws were grabbing onto Castiel's shoulders and his head was tucked underneath Castiel's chin.  Castiel was able to support Dean with one arm while open the door with the other.
The plants withdrew from Castiel's legs, leaving him standing next to several large bushes with no clue as to what they wanted.
Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away from the ground. Adrenaline chilled his limbs and had his blood pumping violently in his chest. He wasn’t brave enough to look at Castiel that very second.
Dean looked at him with so much pity that Castiel felt himself flush with agitation. It felt condescending to see the expression on Dean's face when Castiel was the one that was the witch. He knew about magic and bonds much more than Dean did, no matter what the familiar thought.
Dean’s heat lasted two more days. Sam had extended their stay at Disneyland, so at least Dean and Castiel were able to enjoy the parks some more before they had to go back home.
hope this ... uhhh.. lovely ? chapter makes up for it? who wouldn't want to read about April and Castiel bonding?????
Dean shook his head. “No. I mean, yes it would absolutely suck, but I’d be fucking crushed. Claire is the most amazing girl ever, and I really care for Cas. I want them in my life, still.”
The nightmares plague his waking thoughts, unless he’s with Cas. When he’s with Cas he can focus on how happy he feels and how great Cas is, and everything seems to be better. He knows it’s not healthy to rely on Cas like this, but Dean’s at the end of his wit.
"Really?" Michael asked, his voice taking a flinty and dangerous tone. "And what, pray tell, is going to stop me?"
Also - I'm sure most of you are familiar with this trope and already know where this story is heading, and I have decided that with this type of trope it would make more sense to have Michael instead of Alastair so I have changed the tags to have Michael instead... it will be the same story with a different character
Would he be able to find another job? Would Cas give him a reference? Would he need to return to bartending and waitressing again?
Just as Castiel had gotten himself settled, a flash of familiar brown hair and flannel caught Castiel's eye. He leaned forward, trying to observe the person standing on the beach just a few meters from Castiel.
Dean’s house was a smaller size, but the front yard was large. There were several large trees, one of which had a rope swing. A few baseball bats, baseballs, and gloves were strewn around the lawn. Castiel was careful not to step on anything as he approached the front door.
I’m uploading this on my phone and not my computer which I have never done so hopefully it looks alright lol
“No! You should not be listening to him. Listen, lil bro, you’re probably the best thing that happened to Dean.”
"You're lucky I'm immune to your puppy eyes, little miss." He said. "But, since you asked nicely, I won't become a hairdresser."
"What happened?" Gabriel questioned as he entered the room and looked over Castiel. "What's wrong? What happened to your wards?"
In general, Castiel didn’t really think much about sex. He enjoyed it, sure, but it hadn’t been something he or Amelie had actively sought out. April was a very beautiful omega, but Castiel at this time Castiel wasn’t sure what he wanted from her.
Dean shrugged, still smiling. “I guess. The answer would still be no, though. Can’t say there’s anyone I’m looking at right now.”
anyways..... how has everyone's weeks been? I've recently got into Sims 4 again and I am absolutely addicted so there's that
“I said that this kid, I think Dean Winchester, came up to me today and acted super weird.” Jimmy said.
“We shouldn’t be doing this, not when we’re not officially courting. I need to do this properly for you.” He said. It was an excuse, but he had such a sudden aversion to kissing April that he had to stop.
Damn Charlie. The last thing he needed right now was a chic-flick moment, even if it made him feel a bit better.
Dean hadn't been able to make dinner for them that evening, but for the future he planned to make dinner for them either before he left for work or after he got home and put it in the fridge so that they could just heat it in the microwave if he wasn't home on time. That way they wouldn't be living on Kraft Mac-n-Cheese.
Castiel thought he could fill a book with poetic descriptions of Dean's beauty. His eyes drew Castiel's attention first, with them being bright and clear and as green as a forest. His other features, though, they were lovely too. His nose and cheeks were sculpted, and his lips were pink and perfect. Light freckles dotted over Dean's cheeks and nose, a gorgeous dust against his skin.
“Jack is getting so big, aren’t you, Jack? He’s gained a couple of pounds at least. I’m glad, he was so small when he was born. He’s very healthy. He wakes up in the middle of night, but he doesn’t cry too loudly and he’s so easily calmed, Dean.”
Dean tilted his head. “I hadn’t realized that you were more preogressive with omega and beta laws. If that is the case, then why would the King ever agree to an arranged marriage? Surely he must have wondered if this was against my will or not?”
Dean’s last moments with Sam were emotional and heartfelt, his last moments with his father were less so. Dean also spent time saying goodbye to the various castle workers and members of John’s court that Dean had been especially close to: Ellen the cook, Benny his guard, Bobby his mentor, to name a few.
Since it was the weekend, Castiel had given Dean permission to make Claire unhealthy food. Originally, Castiel had planned on ordering a pizza, but Dean had insisted that he should be allowed to make burgers. They were "to die for." So Claire would still be having a home-cooked meal, and for dessert Dean would be teaching her how to make pie. It would be apple pie, at Claire's request.
Relief broke out across Sam’s face. “Thanks, Ellen. I’m starving and I’m not really in the mood to be eating four burgers.”
"You're absolutely right." Castiel replied. He got Claire set up in her car seat before he got into the front and started the car.
Castiel swallowed, his chest twisting unbearably. Dean looked in awe around them. Angels were not meant for the dark confines of a dungeon. Dean's soul must've been withering away.
Castiel was very sore. Sleeping on the ground did not help his injuries at all, though he supposed he should be grateful they weren't worse. Actually, it was quite miraculous they had survived at all. Dean's wings must've slowed them down enough to lessen the severity of the fall.
"Don't know." Gabriel shrugged. "He had a picture of himself from before, though, so I had to believe him."
He had no idea how long they stood in their bedroom, hugging, but Dean thought it was probably the safest and happiness he’d felt in a very long time.
The elevator stopped, then with a ding, the doors opened. A familiar redhead beta joined Castiel in the elevator.
Getting the fast passes for Space Mountain first thing ended up being a really smart idea, because the line was way shorter than the normal stand-by line. The stand-by line was already an hour and a half, but the fast-pass was only 20 minutes. Sam said it was because they were early and not that many people got the fast-pass right away.
The ride came to the top of the incline, then rock music started up and cars zoomed forward. Dean was pressed up against the back of his seat with the force of it. The whole room was black except lights that looked like stars and planets, so there was no way to know which way the roller coaster car would turn. It jerked and jolted and dropped in places, but Dean found that he wasn’t as scared as he had been with Matterhorn Mountain.
“There’s no way.” Dean says with a shake of his head. “Guy looks like a walking dictionary. I bet he could reject me with fifteen different words without saying ‘no.’”
“I need to get out of this suit.” He said. He actually moved that time, albeit reluctantly, and got off of the table. The table was a mess with plates pushed to the sides, utensils strewn about everywhere, and wine drying on the top.
Castiel still in the living room for a few moments until he was able to get his brain up and running again. He went to Claire's room to check up on her.
“He has amnesia.” Castiel pipes up, sounding small and resigned. He doesn’t look up from his bare feet. “He doesn’t remember anything.”
"I don't mind." Dean replied. "Claire and I had a very full day. She did all she was supposed to, no problems. We went to the park and fed some ducks some seeds. For lunch we had tuna sandwiches and cucumbers. She had her nap, then we drew portraits of each other and played tag outside. She played with her dolls while I made dinner, and now we're here."
Dean may have been a guest of the Novak court and the king’s intended bride, but he knew better than to keep aggravating the knights. He nodded at them, included the jackass one, and then entered his room. The knights did not follow him, nor did they protest when Dean shut the door.
"I'm sorry." Castiel held his breath as he flipped his hand around too so their hands were palm-to-palm. Their fingers slowly entangled with one another.
Castiel readied himself and bared his teeth. He had no weapons but he would defend Dean with his life.
“I forget that your customs are different from ours. Dean, traditionally one who is getting married is not meant to see or be near anyone who is the same designation of their Intended until the ceremony. You will not be allowed near any alphas and the King will not be allowed near any omegas.”
"I will!" Claire said cheerfully. She skipped back to Gabriel. Castiel waved at them once more before he turned and left.
Castiel bit his lip and looked back to their bedroom. A sort of longing built low in his chest, the need to be comforted and
As Dean turns to leave, the man reaches out and grabs his wrist. Dean acts on unknown instincts and immediately tenses, eyes darting to the nearest exit.
"He's like a seriously popular media icon." Dean told him, sounding incredulous. "How could you not have heard of him?"
They ate lunch first. It was burgers and pie, of course, with a little bit of salad that Dean completely ignored. Since learning he was pregnant, Dean had been eating healthier (and Castiel had been bugging him more on that), but Castiel wasn’t going to make Dean eat healthy when it was his baby shower.
"Er." Castiel glanced to the beta woman, who was looking at Claire like the pup was the cutest thing she'd ever seen.
"I won't hurt you." Castiel said, his words intertwined with calming magic that would would coax the ferret into relaxing.
“How can I believe you?” Dean asks. He fights against the tears that are trying to flood his eyes. He
Eventually, though, the sound of Dean’s and Jack’s soft breathing and Castiel’s own exhaustion was enough to lure him to sleep.
It was fascinating to Castiel that Ellen was about the only person that Gabe truly feared. Ellen knew it, too, and she made sure to use her power when necessary.
Castiel wasn't really tired, so he decided to do a bit of research. He knew there would spells that could undo spells of other magical creatures. Castiel knew a few off the top of his head, but they were more specific and supposed to be against other witch-magic, so he wasn't sure if he should try using it on the ferret. Castiel supposed he only had one chance of undoing the magical barrier on the ferret. Whoever had casted the spell would probably be alerted right away, which would cause them to try and strengthen the spell.
The sound of a cord stretching and wood flexing made him stop his movements. Castiel quickly caught sight of the demon archers and his heart sunk. They aimed for Dean. If Castiel tried to block their fire with his wings, it would be easy for them to overpower him.
The rest of the photos in the photo album were just of Dean and Sam. Even at that age, Castiel could tell Dean was attached to his brother, and vice versa. The photo album ended halfway through the book, leaving a sad, half-empty book that was never to be filled. Dean closed the books bit harshly.
It wasn’t hard to convince Dean to get some sleep. His eyes were already slipping shut as Sam and Gabe were making their goodbyes.
It was to be a routine patrol, a simple check around the farthest borders. They would still be well within the territory, just near the borders to make sure there wasn't any sign of anything devious. Castiel had been confident in his ability and the ability of his fellow angels, and so he led them, unafraid.
He stood and held out a hand to Dean. “Charlie, if you don’t mind, I would like to talk with Dean privately.”
Dean blinked, taken aback. He watched as Castiel’s cheeks reddened and the alpha’s scent flooded with embarrassment.
It would be best for Dean to be alone, and not distracted, as he continued to bury his feelings, so he headed for the Dean Cave for some peace and quiet.
Castiel felt a prickle of worry and unease in his belly. It was light outside, the middle of the day, but there was no way to tell what was out in the woods.
"I have to try." Castiel said, flooding with determination. "Please. I have to do everything that I can." He looked to his brother, mouth set.
Work went by slowly and horribly. His day grew even worse when Naomi called to ask Castiel about his date with April. The call ended up taking most of his afternoon, and it ended with Naomi telling Castiel how proud she was of him. Strangely, it didn't really affect Castiel the way it normally did.
Castiel picked up Dean's clothing but hesitated before entering. Dean looked back at him. The red panda tilted its head curiously.
"Yeah." Dean replied, nodding. "My dad would go off to hunt lone demons, and he'd leave us with Bobby and his wife Ellen for a week or two, sometimes. Other times he'd leave us to camp out by ourselves in whatever old, abandoned house he could find."
"It is." Mr. Kelly answered. "But it won't be too cold, and the tourists will be gone. Liliane and I enjoy spending the holiday there. Perhaps we should go for a weekend though?"
“Thank you for joining today.” Lisa started. “There have been some problems with bullying lately, so I asked for Mr. Winchester to join us today while Gordon and Aidan apologize to Adam.”
that was irritating him, but he hadn't realized it was affecting his grace. He'd been disconnected with his conscious grace for a while now, so he wasn't really able to tell how the land around them was affecting it.
Balthazar put down the ladder and Castiel climbed up as quickly as he could. He was nearly completely out when something pale shot out of the water and grabbed Castiel’s leg, pulling him back.
“Because, others go through the same thing, and worse, and I’m lucky to have all that I have already, so I
Sure enough, Cas was staring at him. He didn’t blink or avert his eyes at being caught, either. If anything it seemed the intensity of his eye contact increased.
A few bunnies hopped up to Castiel and sniffed curiously at him before leaving to find something to munch on. Bees buzzed nearby and sometimes landed on Castiel's coat for a moment of rest. The fish poked their heads out of the water to stare at him before quickly swimming away with a sudden splash.
Castiel opened his mouth to return a snarky insult, but he caught sight of the blood splattered against Alastair's shirt, and he growled instead. Alastair raised his eyebrows in a mocking manner.
"Are you a grumpy cat?" Castiel asked. He watched Dean's ear flick in irritation. Then Dean shimmered and his cat form was replaced with his human form. Castiel looked away, once again caught off-guard by Dean's nudity.
“You know,” Castiel said, “The gardens were originally planned out by the first King of Novak as a wedding gift to his wife. He spent a fortune importing different, exotic flowers. The grounds contain the biggest greenhouse in all the kingdom.”
Castiel stood up carefully. He kept his hands on the side of the boat to balance and peered over the side. The waves lapped gently against metal, and if Castiel focused enough he could discern the small, silver flashes of fish darting around.
This is how he ends up back at the diner he first started at. He only has three bucks in his pocket, but he goes in anyways.
Castiel stumbled over a root and went colliding into the ground. He shouted out in anger and shoved himself up. His ankle twinged painfully, but Castiel forced himself forward. He couldn't let Dean down.
"Castiel, please." He said with a sigh. "This is ridiculous. Hand over the familiar and be done with it. You will never hear from me again."
"It's not your fault." Castiel said. Without much thought, he reached forward to grab Dean's hand and squeeze it. "I am just as much to blame."
I absolutely love witch/familiar au's so I'm thinking about how I would write a sequel or at least timestamps, but nothing's certain just quite yet... I could always just write a new witch/familiar au lol
"The demon's had some strong points." Gabriel shrugged. "Besides, he's not for the angels winning or the demons winning. He thinks the war is pointless."
Castiel's wings twitched. The demon moved to allow them full access to the window. Dean looked to Castiel.
Dean brushed his thumb against Castiel’s knee and made a thoughtful noise. He turned so his chest was facing Castiel and started to look back and forth between both of Castiel’s knees, like he was comparing them.
The dark object had been a ward. They'd gone past it. Castiel was totally reconnected with his grace.
Castiel closed his eyes and poured his magic into Michael as a fierce, deadly wavelengths of energy.
He opened an eye to check on Dean and saw that the familiar was staring at him with a slack jaw. They didn't have anytime to explore their newfound telepathy, though, because a large man suddenly bounded into the room and skidded to a halt in the entrance way.
“Joanna Beth, don’t be rude to Castiel,” Mrs. Harvelle scolded. She nodded at Castiel. “You go ahead, Castiel.”
“Good.” Lisa said. “Now, students are not permitted to say anything negative about one another or to act meanly towards each other. Anything opinions they have that are against another student are not to be shared. Bullying will not be tolerated. This is not the first time that Gordon has been here because of his behavior. He and Aidan will need to apologize to Adam.”
"It's not the same, Cas!" Dean tried, sounding desperate. "I want a permanent bond with you, I swear!"
Claire, intelligent cat that she was, hissed at him from the couch. John’s scent spiked with outrage and he stepped towards her. Castiel was able to break through his shock to grab John’s arm and stop him.
Claire and Dean were sitting at the kitchen table with empty plates. They looked up at his entrance.
"That was rude." Alastair said, calmly wiping the away. He backhanded Castiel suddenly and blood welled up in Castiel's mouth as his head was whipped to the side. His eyes watered.
Dean really didn't want to go in for his shift at the Roadhouse that night, but he had to do what he had to do.
Castiel did not know how long Dean's heat lasted, but he thought it was a little less than a week. The demons separated them once the heat ended. Castiel had wanted to try to fight since it was likely the only time they would be in the same cell together, but Dean was tired and vulnerable, so Castiel refrained.
“I can smell that.” Castiel said, brushing back Claire’s hair. “I think I might need to snag a bite.”
Castiel gently moved Claire's foot and then pushed himself out of the bed. He always got up earlier than her so he could do most of his morning routine beforehand. He ate breakfast, brushed his teeth, took a shower, and put on his clothes. Then he woke Claire.
Dean frowned and his forehead crinkled. "We just got here, though. I haven't seen Bobby 'n the others in years."
He stood quickly from his seat at the couch to dim the lighting and light the candles on the table. It may have been cheesy but Castiel was going to do this perfectly.
"Hey, Mr. Novak," he said, "I don't mind taking Claire early so she doesn't miss out on all the feeding times and stuff. You can come when you're done, and we'll bring you your ticket at the gate."
Castiel answered quickly so he wouldn't lose his nerve. “I wanted to apologize. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have assumed hurtful stereotypes about you. That was rude of me.”
Lightning burst from his fingers and soared to Michael. He'd caught his brother off guard, and the bolt hit Michael square in the chest. Michael flung back from the force of the bolt and landed on his back five feet farther away. Dean whirled around to gape at Castiel.
Castiel’s gaze did not lessen. Dean tried to ignore the way that his neck and ears heated up under Cas’s scrutiny. He cleared his throat a few times, but either Cas didn't understand what Dean was trying to get across or he didn’t care.
“Of course I am!” Dean said. “I won’t be going too close, because I’m not insane and I have no wish to be stung to death, but I’m sure I can admire from afar as you risk your life.”
"Right." Jo nodded. "He sent out an army to reclaim you, led by Gabriel. Only a couple of angels returned, and they all had seen Gabriel with a demon."
"How many forms do you have?" Castiel questioned. Most familiars had two or three forms, but the stronger ones could have four or even five. The magical boundary that Dean had had was powerful, so Castiel assumed Dean would have multiple forms. The fact that Dean had been a ferret too, rather than a more common animal like a dog or cat, was another display of Dean's power.
Castiel pulled back, tactfully ignoring Dean's high-pitched wine, and thought it over in his head. An omega this abused should not be going into heat. There simply was not enough nutrients in his body to sustain such a thing, and yet, Dean went into heat
"If you don't calm yourself now, I will take your punishment out on Dean." Alastair warned, his voice cold and sharp. Castiel settled, looking worriedly to Dean. The omega stood still beside Alastair, his eyes downcast.
“Did you not like the wine?” He asked, worried. “I’m sorry, I could have brought you a different one-”
Castiel kissed Jack’s forehead. “It’s going to be okay. You’ll meet your daddy soon, and we’ll all go home together, I promise.”
“You’re a literal archangel!” Dean said, exasperated more than anything. “You can probably mojo the dishes with one fucking thought!”
Claire's door was shut. Castiel almost knocked, but he stopped himself when he caught a whiff of tears and hurt and heard a few muffled cries.
Castiel was surprised to realize that he wasn't lying. He truly wished to be there for Dean and for their child, and even if Dean wasn't pregnant, Castiel still wanted to be the one that Dean turned to.
“I’ll let your brother know that he can bring your baby in.” The nurse said. “He’s probably already waiting outside.”
Dean was reluctant to stop getting in line for the ride, but Charlie pointed out that there were other things to do.
Only as they were entering their room, and Dean caught sight of the one king-sized bed, did Dean realize that
“What do you always say, Dean, hmm? You say ‘family don’t end in blood,’ and it doesn’t, Dean! Family does not end in blood. You are equally Claire and Jack’s father as I am, never mind that Claire is not biologically yours. Jack is not biologically yours either, Dean, but that does not make you less of a parent to him.”
Dean woke up on the day before his wedding full of dread. He didn’t want to be married to Lucifer. He didn’t want to be separated from Cas. He couldn’t help but spend the first hour of his day crying. When Cas came for his shift, Dean had to hurry to wipe away the tears and powder his face to hide the redness. There wasn’t anything he could do about his scent, though.
Dean reached into his mouth. Before Castiel had a chance to grimace at the poor (and, frankly, gross) manners, Dean pulled something small and white out of his mouth. At first, Castiel thought it was a tooth. Then he realized what it was.
Leaving was still hard. Jack would grow fussy and stay upset for a good hour after Castiel took him home. Plus, Castiel hated having to leave Dean alone. He would feel so awful if Dean woke up to no one, but he would feel even worse if Dean died without Castiel there. He knew Dean struggled with the feeling of abandonment, and everyday he left Dean there in the hospital was another pound of guilt in his chest.
Dean glanced over at the family just as the toddler gestured wildly towards the ducks and squirmed in her dad’s hold.
and seemed to fill up the small space. Castiel barely refrained himself from outwardly scenting the air.
Sometimes the guards came for Dean. Castiel would hiss and spit like a feral cat, but it made no difference. It seemed to goad the guards on, even. They would sneer and snicker in return and push Dean around as they snuck in lingering touches. Dean was always silent during these periods, with his head down. Castiel had never seen his face clearly, and he wished he could.
After dinner, Dean surprised Castiel by not shifting and instead choosing to sulk in his room in his human form. Castiel did not go after him. He couldn't explain exactly why he was upset with Dean, but he was also reluctant to think about it.
"Do you want kids?" For some reason it was easier for Castiel to talk about it when April brought it up but it was difficult when Castiel tried to discuss it.
Oh well. There wasn't much Castiel could do about it. He shook himself out of his thoughts and managed to do some work.
Dean stared at him, looking just as confused as Castiel felt. "What do you mean you don't feel your grace?"
"Yeah." Dean said. He was sitting at the kitchen counter and staring down at the top with a sort of pensive gaze.
"Alastair likes to watch when I pluck my good feathers." Dean shrugged. "He collects 'em too. Probably gets him off or something, sadistic bastard."
"I enjoy your presence immensely, and not just because of our bond. You are humous and witty and caring, and you make me feel like I am more than my mistakes."
"I am positive." Castiel replied. Dean took the bowl and began to eat, satisfying something within Castiel that he quickly buried away. Dean at slower this time, to Castiel's relief. Dean pushed the bowl back over when he was finished, and Castiel stacked it neatly with his empty water mug.
“Naomi mentioned you were having difficulty finding a suitable nanny for Claire,” Mr. Kelly said, “I still have April’s nanny’s contacts.”
"I like to read too." April said. "I can't say the same for board games, though. What kind of movies do you like?"
It was forbidden for an angel to wed or mate anything other than an angel, of course. The union between Dean's parents would not have been accepted, which would explain why they decided to live on earth instead of heaven. Castiel could only imagine the repercussions that would have come from such an act.
“I can’t wait.” Castiel admitted. He grinned at Dean, nearly bursting with joy, and slid out of the car.
Instantly, Ellen was aiming a rifle at he newcomers. Castiel had no idea where she'd gotten it, but he found his respect for her increasing.
"He's not the most traditional nanny, and that kind of throws people off. That's why I didn't say anything earlier." Charlie explained.
"It's amusing to me." Gabriel argued. "Whatever. My own brother leaves me out of his tender moments, but it's fine. Not like I helped him save the love of his life, or anything."
“These are your quarters.” One knight said. “You may arrange them in whatever way you wish and you will have complete privacy. Anytime you leave your quarters, you will be in the presence of a guard, for your own protection.”
"Look!" Claire squealed, taking off in a run. She slipped around another family to point at the large panda bears munching leisurely on bamboo.
This time, Castiel was not able to stop himself from leaning to the side and retching. There wasn't much in his stomach, but he continued to gag.
what did we think about April, hmm? I mean obviously she and Cas don't belong together, but I think that there should be
"Not what I meant." Dean said. "I just think it's weird that you're letting me live in your house and you know nothing about me."
Dean pushed himself back into the water, then moved in front of Castiel’s legs. Castiel startled when Dean grabbed his legs, one with each hand, and pushed them wide apart.
After their first confusing interaction, confusion interactions started to become more usual. Dean would notice Castiel looking at him, or Castiel would catch him off-guard with a personal and genuine compliment, or he would bring Dean a gift of some sort, like a flower or a book, and give it to Dean with a soft, shy smile.
"Well," Charlie hesitated, "he's not really credentialed. He's got a CPR certificate, and some basic emergency training, but no other degrees except for a GED. He didn't go to college."
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted his blabbering, “Whatever you’re comfortable with is what we’ll do, but if I’m being honest, I’d rather spend some time getting to know you and learning more about merpeople first.”
A genuine frown flickered across Gabriel's features as he squinted at them. "Who the hell is Crowley?"
He made his way to the door and let Sam and Gabe in. Gabe took one look at him and wrinkled his nose.
The last game was less of a game and more of a crafting event. Everyone received a plain white baby onesie that they were responsible for decorating. Dean was the least excited for this one until Ellen told him he could decorate his onesie with a pie (as long as he added “Cutie Pie”). Castiel drew an acute angle and labeled it with “I’m Acute Baby.” He’d made it on Charlie’s encouragement. Charlie claimed she had no artistic ability and so she only wrote “I am an Expansion Pack.” Bobby painted on a red bowtie that was outlined in red glitter (and he glared at Gabe when the beta teased him about it). Gabe ‘helped’ Sam decorate their onesie, which had a drawing of a moose with the caption “Don’t Moose with Me.” Benny and Andrea (though Castiel suspected Andrea did most of the work) painted a very cute bee and wrote “I’m UnBeelievably Cute.” Castiel privately liked that one the most, though Andrea and Benny sent him secretive grins so Castiel thought he probably wasn’t very good at hiding his opinion. Kevin’s said “I Enjoy a Little Formula,” and it had a baby’s bottle with the quadratic formula written on the inside. Jo decided to throw on a bunch of different colored paint and glitter on her onesie.
"Something else!" Gabriel exclaimed, holding his hands over his face and head protectively. "Something small and cute! A hummingbird!"
He helped Dean into some spare bathing suit shorts while Balthazar took off towards town, chortling all the way.
"You're too fucking nice, Cas." Dean sounded frustrated. "You weren't given a choice really, either. For what it's worth, I'm glad it was you."
Castiel stood behind him, cool as a cucumber. He was missing his normal trench coat and inner suit and instead was wearing a t-shirt and some shorts. Dean wondered where Castiel had gotten such casual clothing.
"That's bullshit." Dean growled. He let out a harsh laugh. "You don't give a fuck about me and my safety, you just want to win the fucking war." He jabbed a finger at Castiel's chest, and Castiel felt his anger rising in response.
Castiel arrived at work exactly on time. Daphne greeted him with a coffee and his schedule. He'd sent her more flowers, still guilty for his outburst, and she obviously had appreciated the gesture.
It was awkward for Castiel to maneuver his way into a sitting position while holding onto Dean’s hand, but somehow they were able to sit side-by-side on two chairs with their hands hanging between them. It was way more comfortable than Castiel had expected it to be and he found that the weight and warmth of Dean’s hand was rather nice.
Gabriel sucked in a breath. "Yeah, sorry, Cassie. That would do it, I think, if he really cared for you and really wanted to form a bond with you. Is it possible that he wanted to form a permanent bond with you before this?"
"Is it okay if I stay home?" Sam asked with a pinched look on his face. "I've got a test tomorrow that I really need to study for."
"You know, I'm really glad that Dean has you." Sam said. "I wanted to form a permanent bond with Dean. I mean, I didn't
Castiel leaned forward and pressed a quick, chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. All Dean could think was that it wasn't supposed to be like this. It should have been something romantic and lovely.
Most angels lived in heaven, though a few traveled to nearby realms, but hardly any lived on earth permanently. Earth was the primary battleground between angels and demons. It was worn and dangerous, and completely unheard of to raise a family there. Demons crawled all over the place.
Wow it's been 3 weeks and I am very sorry... this chapter was super difficult for me but I felt like it came together in the end there
As he walked away, Dean couldn’t help the stupid grin that crossed his features. He could not wait for Saturday.
It wasn't the wisest thing to ask. Dean was still a bit miffed from the whole Benny debacle, even if that had been a whole week ago.
Once Castiel had finished his meal, he stood and returned to his home. He did the dishes and cleaned up, and then he got himself ready for bed. It was quite early in the evening still, but Castiel had nothing else to do. He got in bed, under the covers, and twitched on his lamp so that he could read. It took him hours before he was actually able to fall asleep.
"Alright." Castiel nodded. "Thank you." He offered a tight grin, then he entered his office and shut the door. He walked over to his desk and slumped in his chair, moping.
“Alpha, I need you to calm down.” The doctor said, her voice firm and soothing. “I need to help your mate, and I need you to let me.”
Castiel spared a glance at Dean and found the familiar was staring at him with a pleading expression.
"Yup." Adam replied, grinning. "It's my birthday so my mama brought me to the beach to eat burgers and get ice cream."
Castiel tried to use another spell, a powerful burst of wind, to push Michael back, much like he'd done with Dean when they had first met.
"It's your name, Sammy." Dean replied with a shit-eating grin. In retaliation, Sam threw a bunch of spinach down all over Dean's pizza, making Dean cry out indignantly.
The car was still in the driveway when they got back to the house, which did ease some of Dean's concerns. At least he knew that Mr. Novak hadn't gotten into a car crash or something.
The ferris wheel was so tall that there was a carriage instead of a simple seat. Dean expected to share with the others, but to his surprise, the ride manager loaded everyone onto one carriage except for Castiel and Dean.
It wasn’t that Dean was… ashamed, or anything. But he didn’t know how Castiel would respond, and the last thing that Dean wanted to do was upset him when he was just starting to be happy again.
Castiel obediently started forward. He tried to match Dean's pace, but he found that Dean was walking slower than he had been the day before. He watched Dean carefully from the corner of his eye. He noticed there was a slight limp in Dean's step. This worried Castiel immensely, but he was not about to mention it in front of all the demons.
Castiel sucked his breath in sharply. He ran his hands tentatively over the lock again, just to be certain that they were truly bigger.
Castiel even stood and paced around for a while, getting antsy. Every time he tried to shut the conversation down, April would get sad and he would feel guilty and she would continue talking. He kept telling himself that it would end soon.
Come Friday, Dean was a fucking bundle of nerves. He had absolutely no idea what to expect. He knew Lisa would try to treat the situation diplomatically, but that didn’t mean the other parents would do the same.
Dean doesn’t want to say anything, but he’s so fucking tired, and Cas’s hand is warm and soft and soothing and Dean’s only a man. He’s weak and desperate for any sort of affection and comfort that Castiel can give him.
During breakfast, Castiel had explained how Dean had come to live with him and how Michael had ended up finding Dean with more detail than he had before. Dean chimed in at times.
With Adam in school, Dean also had way more time to hang out with friends. Charlie, for instance, had told him she'd gotten up so late that she hadn't had the time to get coffee. To surprise her, Dean had decided to pick up some coffee for her and bring it to her at her work.
"I'm sorry to hear that." Charlie said. Her tone was all sympathy and no pity, for which Castiel was grateful.
“Oh.” Dean chews on his lip and picks at the hem of his jeans. “Why haven’t you mentioned them before?”
It was a photo of Mary and John. Both were young and staring lovingly at one another. It was similar to the other photo John and Mary, except for one thing.
Castiel shrugged. "Your presence does not threaten me in the least, so there is no need to know more about you."
“Don’t worry, Dean. We will figure this out.” Castiel assured, his expression soft and genuine. Dean had to look down.
"Around here, somewhere." Gabriel replied. "You're not gonna smite him, are you? Because I gotta say, that would really suck and I would not be cool with that."
Castiel laughed again and shook his chest. His chest felt so warm and full and he just wanted to grab Dean and kiss him everywhere.
For the rest of the day, Dean and Sam did all that Adam wanted to do, which was mostly play Sorry! since the kid was going through a phase. He won almost every time.
Castiel continued on and flung open the door to his shop. He peered outside and caught sight of the being almost instantly.
They passed through the women’s section and into the children’s section as they headed for the men’s section.
Castiel stared down at his baby, captivated by pink, pudgy cheeks and bright blue eyes. His pup blinked up at him, then offered a wide, gummy smile.
"Yeah, he's gone." Sam met Dean's eyes briefly before glancing down again. "I don't know how I got my horns. After I realized you were gone and Dad was dead... I - I freaked out. I was so fucking upset, man, and then I passed out again. When I woke up again, my wings were gone and my horns were there."
"Thank you, Claire!" Castiel called back. He made his way to the door and paused before he opened it, taking a deep breath.
The plants answered that it had been hours since the ferret had come and hours that they tried to rouse Castiel from his slumber.
“Yeah, I agree.” Dean said. He did agree. He thought it was important for kids to learn that their actions had consequences that affected others and not just themselves. Dean just wished he wasn’t part of it. He was feeling stressed and awkward.
“No, I miss my friends, too.” Dean answered. He thought about Charlie, Benny, and Jo. He wondered what they’d been up to since he’d left, if they’d missed him as much as he had missed them.
“Okay, my turn!” Gabriel said, like the child that he was. “I’m grateful that Deano made us this delicious dinner and that I didn’t have to do any work!”
"Mommy used to take me with her." Claire answered. "She said I could get mine done too when I was older. I'm older now."
“You’re not being helpful. I’m trying to say that it feels like there's something more that’s holding me back this time.”
King Lucifer did not call for Dean’s presence the first day or the second day or the third day. In fact, a whole week went by without hearing anything from the King before Dean finally broke and asked a servant why the King hadn’t met with him.
“Dean, what the fuck?!” Sam demanded, pale and shaking. “What the hell, dude? Can you not look at Cas for five seconds? I’m trying to make it back alive and in one piece.”
also if anyone wants to chat about literally anything, my Tumblr is tale-to-tell (just hyphens instead of underdashes lol)
It was getting very difficult to ignore the other thing. They’d visited Disneyland 4 months ago, at the beginning of August, so Dean was rapidly approaching the fifth month. He still hadn’t really decided on what to do about … it.
“It’s fine.” Castiel said. It was a little funny to Castiel for Sam to apologize on Gabe’s behalf. For most of his life, Castiel had been the one apologizing on Gabe’s behalf. To be on the receiving end was a strange experience.
"I promised to take you to Heaven, remember?" Castiel asked, though his question went unanswered. They both knew the likelihood of it was low.
“I’ve known my cousin for a long time, Dean,” He said, voice quiet and serious, “I do believe that I know him better than anyone, except maybe you. I think that you should know that Castiel cares for you a lot. He doesn't like to get emotionally involved with something, because often his feelings will make him do something crazy or rash.”
Dean scoffed. “I’ve heard stories about Lucifer, and his assumption of me is likely to be the least of my worries.”
"No!" Dean cried, and Castiel felt his alpha roar. He flung himself at the bars and reached through, just managing to grab hold of the sleeves of a demon guard. He yanked the guard towards him with an insane amount of strength, and the demon guard collided with the bars. His head bounced off with a "clang," and the guard went slack in Castiel's hold.
Castiel looked forward just in time to see Dean to fall down in front of him. Castiel tried to stop, but they were too close together and so he ended up tripping over Dean and smacking hard onto the ground.
Castiel’s stomach fluttered anxiously as Castiel entered his room and sat down on his bed. The conversation at dinner had left him feeling uneasy.
Clarification: there's a difference between conscious and subconscious grace... basically conscious grace is what they control and subconscious grace is like keeping their health up and stuff like that lol
"Well," Castiel started, forming his words slowly, "I thought that I would clean and redress your wounds. After that you would be free to go. If there's any place you would like to be, I will do my best to get you there."
His room smelled distinctly of Dean, even after he’d replaced the sheets with new ones and washed the soiled ones twice.
With the last of his strength, Castiel shoved Michael's hand away and touched his brother's forehead.
“I am the youngest of the family, and being Lucifer’s younger cousin isn’t something I’d ever like to repeat.” Castiel replied, and Dean was surprised by his blunt honesty. Even relatives of royals had to watch their tongues.
Their sudden descent sent Castiel's stomach churning horribly. He couldn't get his wing to loosen up, no matter how hard he tried. He and Dean spun a bit as they fell.
“I don’t care!” Castiel said, hugging Dean tighter and hardly realizing that he was practically kneeling on the table.
"Pity," Alastair sighed, "we we're getting somewhere. I almost don't want to carry on with our normal sessions, it's boring me so much."
"I know." Dean said. "Okay, well, give me a call if you need something. I'll be with Mr. Novak and his daughter so I'll probably be able to come back."
"Claire, you look so pretty today." Dean's voice drifted through their home. Claire's giggles followed.
"Bye, Uncle Gabe!" She gave Gabriel a hug, then bounced up to Castiel and took his hand. "Ready, Papa."
"As do I." Castiel tilted his head and then took a gulp of his wine. Gabriel had always said he was a bad liar, but Castiel thought himself decent at the very least.
Instantly, the other guards began to yell and shout. They pulled the unconscious guard away from Castiel and raised their weapons, preparing to attack him.
to, but I wanted to help him because I knew that some other witches wanted to force him to bond. He knew that Jess and I actually wanted to form a bond, so he said no whenever I offered. He's selfless like that."
