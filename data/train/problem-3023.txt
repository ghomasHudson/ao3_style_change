And it really was nice. Heaven was clearly curated almost perfectly. Dean could go between the bunker to a gentle wooden cabin tucked away in the woods, put there just for him. There was a beautiful kitchen with wide windows and a porch that overlooked a creek. The bed was soft and the wooden floors creaked in an impossibly familiar way. It did feel like home, like a home Dean never knew of, never would have exactly imagined, but fit just right. It was good. It really was.
“What?” came another voice from the left. Dean swiveled fast. He knew that voice. The graying man walked into the kitchen from the patio, shutting the door with his back foot. “Thought she’d leave me at home?”
The road flattened out entirely. Dean took a moment to shake out his wrists.
Bobby grinned. “Banshee.”
“And then almost immediately, a case forms around you.”
And then the music stopped entirely, static gone too.
“No, no, no, let me explain. I know it sounds batshit, trust me I fuckin’ know, but let me explain.” He reached across the table to push out a chair for Bobby, gesturing at it wildly. Bobby got the idea and sat.
It hit him like a wall, and then it was gone. The entire world was filled with static. Dean hit the floor, hands over his ears out of pure instinct.
Some wistful part of him thought that maybe it was Cas sending the songs.
Dean spent days, years, hours, however time worked up here, driving along the most pristine slices of America. Dean knew it wasn't really America. American-inspired, for sure. There was a postcard quality to everything here. Everything felt like a snapshot. It felt nostalgic, no matter where he went, somehow, despite the landscapes being new and invented and perfect. Sometimes, he’d pull over the impala at a particularly beautiful overlook and gaze out at the sky or watch the bees as they flew low over meadows of flowers.
Jo giggled. It was unlike her.
He’d read about it years ago, back when he still had the imprint of Cas’s hand on his arm. Marked souls wouldn't be permitted into heaven. If you had even a whiff of hell about you, you’d be kicked right out, left on the curb in front of the golden gates, the whole 9 yards. Back when they first infiltrated Heaven, all those years ago, Dean had so worried he’d set off some alarm.
He spread his arms. “You know what you told me when I was thirteen dad? You told me there were only two ways to get to hell faster than selling a soul. Remember what they were?”
“Do you- did you ever miss it? Hunting, I mean?”
He bit his lip. “I think I liked thinking that there was some reason everything felt wrong. Some conspiracy. Instead it’s just me, I guess.”
Not-Sam’s forehead crinkled. “What?”
The song stopped as he came to a bridge. It was beautiful. Dean stopped. He knew he should.
Yes, there was a time where he loved Dean, every part of him. He loved learning about humans, about kindness and persistence and rebellion. He adored Dean’s irrational affection for a car. But overall, he loved how the man remained so selfless. He’d try and hide it. He’d pretend there was always some other selfish motivator behind his actions, but there wasn't. He would build up a wall for him to hide behind, but even when hell raged in his mind or the world turned against him, he tried so hard to be good.
But not today, he decided.
and he threw off the sheets, hurdling down the stairs, already thinking about what he could use as a weapon because who the
Maybe it was because Ca-. No.
Castiel tipped his head to the side as the hunter cried.
He snapped, and the song stopped again.
Cas pursed his lips. He’d probably known this for years. It was an inconvenience. But it was there. He googled the term once. Unrequited. It was a pretty sounding word. It made him feel meek and gross and twisted inside. He almost felt dirty for wanting Dean in a way he knew Dean could never want back. But that's how it was.
He stopped talking, looking at Dean expectantly.
Bobby rolled his eyes again. “And to think I thought you were a functioning alcoholic.” His eyes caught the kitchen table, which was covered in books and song lyrics. “What’s all this?”
“Dad that was a fucked up story. You get that right?”
“And to think I thought we were past such extroverted greetings,” she teased with a smile.
Dean paused. “I mean. Not exactly. It’s just.” He sighed. “I used to dream about escaping the life. You know, lying down the guns and the blades and retiring. Hang up the coat and all that.”
Dean slammed his palm into the sigil, hands and shirt stained red. “CASTIEL!” He screamed it, voice almost giving out from the desperate shriek.
“And after you left I was thinking. Like I said. I would lay awake and I’d remember how goddamn much you gave up.” He wiped his nose. “I mean, you disobeyed God. You-” He was starting to sound hysterical. “And I started thinking “what if that was all for me,” and I know I’m probably just a raging narcissist and that was never even in the cards for you but,” he choked again. “But I couldnt live with myself anymore, knowing how fucking much you gave for us, for Sam and I. And then everything was fixed and Chuck was gone and Lucifer was dead and I still just. There was something missing, you know? I was supposed to be thrilled we’d finally saved the world, and I’d lie awake and think about you.”
Dean cleared his throat, looking away from the blonde. “Hey- Hey Dad.”
He wiped his nose. “I still don't, honestly. This eternal life thing is starting to feel a bit like bullshit. But. I made that choice. And I know Bobby said the case thing was bullshit but. I don't know. For a moment I was real excited. Scared too, but. I just wanted to do something.”
“Cas-”
“It’s just. You- you never gave me a chance to say anything back. I wish you had. Cas you-” He was crying now. The tears ran warm down his face, and he snuffled hurriedly, trying to keep his composure. He had to do that. “Anyways. I fucking miss you, man. I uh. I hope we can talk soon. I-” He sighed. “I have some things to say.”
“Castiel!” He shouted, voice strong and loud and desperate and angry. “Where the FUCK are you?” He spun around wildly, almost tripping over his own feet as they dragged across the rockface. “Huh? You told me-” He wasn't crying silently anymore, this was a loud hiccuping sob now- “You fuckin’ told me you’d always come when I called.”
There were very few faces he knew as well as Sam’s. He’d seen him scared and hungry and tired. He’d seen him happy and resentful and judgmental. He’d seen him wrecked with grief and incredibly euphoric.
His gut twisted a little as he thought about who wasn't there.
Dad. With a passion. Why are you pretending you don’t, hm? He got the love of your life killed.” Dean gestured around the bar. “Where is dear old Bill anyways?”
“And I knew. I knew then that I-” Dean spluttered. “That I loved you too. I was so blind to it back then. Maybe I did know, deep down. There were times when I almost did something about it, almost said something or finally just fucking kissed you, but I told myself I was being irrational and lonely and stupid.” Dean took a breath. “And then you, you said that and you disappeared and-” He tried to steady himself. “I couldn't live with myself anymore.”
He loved meadows, Dean remembered that. He always thought the way that each of these unique wildflowers managed to coexist and thrive together was fascinating and endearing. He loved how the bumblebees crashed into the stalks over flowers. He loved watching butterflies flap by slowly.
The room stayed dead quiet.
Bobby shook his head. “You brothers. So codependent.”
It was soft, at first. Guitar strings and subtle bass.
One of the first things Dean learned was that real God wasn't that different from his own father. Both were distant entities who left their children to search for meaning in his orders. Cas had practically said so when they first met.
Dean’s stomach turned. “I, uh.”
Bobby made his little “hmmph” noise. Dean took that as a sign to continue talking.
Dean leaned back in his chair.
He thought about jumping for a moment, just for the hell of it. Why not?
“And I get it. That’s your right. I uh, I wouldn't wanna talk to me either.” He sniffed awkwardly. “Anyways I’m sure you are busy with angel business. Off with capital-G God. Tell Jack I love ‘im for me, will you? I hope he’s doing alright. It can't be easy.”
Heaven, and he still wasn't content. How fucking selfish could you be, he wondered, to be in eternal paradise and still not be at peace, still not feel at rest.
Bobby read the verse quietly, his lips moving with the words. He sat up.
________
“I wanted to make sure I had the right words to say to you.”
And before Cas could say anything else, Dean pulled him close, right into his chest, a sob racking through his body. They sat there like that for a while, Dean holding Castiel close as he shook. “I’m sorry,” Dean croaked. “I’m so so sorry.”
He cracked his knuckles. “Come on? No shocked reaction? No witty banter?”
So here Dean sat, the most perfect overlook he could find.
Maybe it was because everything here was still partially built from memory. It’s how the food could taste how it did- everything connected back to his life on Earth. The people he met, the places he saw, the beer he drank, it was all a messy web right back to forty one years of living-breathing-earth-dwelling Dean Winchester.
__________
. She looked more put together, physically and emotionally, then Dean had ever seen her.
Cas’s gaze had fallen somewhere on the floor earlier. This made him look right back up. He looked Dean in the eyes.
“Cas, uh. I hope you can hear me.” He cleared his throat awkwardly and opened his eyes, tilting his head to gaze at the ceiling. “I’m sure you can. I know you can. Uh. This is my,” he paused, trying to remember. His brain felt fuzzy. “Eighth?”
He stepped out of baby and walked to the railing, looking out at the vast expanse of trees. A river trickled under his feet.
He rolled his neck. “Anyways. Back to my point. Dean. This is the moment in the story where you stand here, shell shocked, devastated by your discoveries. It’s the plot twist, the climax, and you know what?”
“Fuck!” Dean swore, looking down and trying to pull the tape out. The tips of his fingers burned as they came in contact with the deck. Static was beginning to fill the impala.
“Dean.” Not-Sam said.
He closed his eyes, tried to summon everything he’d felt for the last decade. He remembered sitting in the back of the impala, seeing the nape of Dean’s neck, the way he turned his head away from the road to smile at Cas, his eyes in the rearview mirror. He remembered how he felt when Dean congratulated him with his hand placed on his back, the heat in his face when he shoved Dean up against a wall in a fight. He remembered the warmth in his stomach when Dean ran to him in purgatory.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. Cas could be out of the empty he could be alive he-
That seemed nice, at first. The pain was gone- the constant ache behind his right knee and the weight in his spine were gone. His scars were gone too, he discovered later.
“CAS!” The waterfall felt like it was growing louder.
Part of it made sense. There was almost a script to follow in the art of one night stands and casual hook ups. There was an even larger beauty to long-term relationships, to Sam and Eileen’s constant connection, their inside jokes, the way they found each other across a room.
He deepened his voice. “I
“I love you,” he whispers, the words like acid on his tongue. He meant them. He meant everything he said. It replays in his mind, slowly, sluggishly, like it’s pushing through cement to emerge in his consciousness.
And just like the other day with Come on Eileen, the song began to stretch and lengthen. It felt like it was being pulled apart and patched together again with static crowding the gaps between song and void. For a second, it was quiet.
Dean bit the inside of his lip again. He discovered that no matter how hard he bit, it wouldn't bleed.
Cas had called him on it a dozen times. It was one of the first things he ever said to the hunter.
The night we met, what happened the night they met?
Dean felt cold. There was something icy in his stomach now. He sat ram-rod straight, Jo shifted off of him.
_____
It was a glitch, he thought slowly.
It was quiet again. Mary seemed nervous.
The man was singing disjointedly. Dean’s heart was beginning to beat quicker.
He hoped they were together now. Sam and Eileen. He knew Sammy had been waiting to see her after Jack brought her back. He spent a lot of time being worried about Dean, right after it all ended. Dean pretended not to notice.
He waits in darkness now. The darkness is better then when the empty turn’s its attention on him, making him relive regrets and guilt and horror. In the darkness, sometimes, he forgets who he is.
The first thing he learned was that the song was called No Plan, by a tall Irish dude named Hozier. Dean knew the name vaguely- Kaia had brought him up before.
“Harvelle!”
wanted.
“But Cas you were right. You were so right. I had let anger fuel me for so long. And it wasn't fair to you, or Sammy, or anyone else. I hated what I had become. I was so much like-” his voice cracked. “Like my father. And after you. After you said what you said I knew I couldn't be that person anymore.” Dean sighed. “I’m sorry.”
Chuck glowed white. He wore Cas’s face. His eyes were so blue.
There was a moment of silence. Cas cleared his throat. “For what?”
He pressed on the accelerator, and instantly the music started.
Nothing else went wrong on the drive home.
He didn't even remember picking up the plate. It just. Appeared. He wanted his brain to shut up, wanted to make a noise louder than his head, and there it was, a white polished plate, right between his fingers.
Dean dully wondered if Ash had overloaded the power again.
Cas went up to the bar, holding his glass of whiskey tightly. He closed his eyes.
“No, really.” John said quickly.
There was someone standing there. He looked identical to Sam in every way one should. He was even wearing the exact outfit he’d worn when Dean picked him up from Stanford all those years ago. Part of Dean wanted to run and hug him. He’d missed Sam, so fucking much, but that, that
Bobby nodded. “As far as I’m aware, he’s not here. You should ask around. Ash would know.”
“Find a hobby. I told you about fencing, right?”
“Cas,” he whispered, “I really fucked up this time.” He sighed.
Chuck snapped his fingers. The music stopped.
Chuck was now standing where Not-Sam had stood, adjusting his jaw. ‘Ugh. Shifting. What a process.” He shook out his arms. “Always makes me a little uncomfy.”
Dean moved his hand to smooth out his shirt. “Yeah.”
“Your mother’s become quite the cook, eh?” The elder Winchester joked, mistaking Dean’s closed eyes for bliss. “She’s been intent on learning since we got here. Can't rely on microwave dinners forever.”
Cas stopped thinking about that. He tried not to during his moments of solitude. Those thoughts would be shoved back down his throat when the Empty made the rounds.
He didn't know how long he’d been in there when he first became aware of the disturbance. There was a shift in the darkness, somewhere. He could feel something was different. He gazed out into the darkness. He closed his eyes again.
The song was clear in it’s messaging- Heaven wasn't real, in order to exist as a free persona one must shed the cage of religion and stop living for an afterlife that wouldn't exist. It was a love song, Dean thought with a small smile, to rebellion and to those you rebel with.
“That’s not why I did it.” Cas’s words became hurried.
Not-Sam kept talking. “Honestly. I was worried this was too ambitious but come on, I had to try.” His face slipped into a sickly grin. His eyes burned white for half a moment, and Dean watched as his skin stretched and folded and melded into a new shape.
Dean tried to open his mouth to speak when suddenly Mary was by his side. He hadn't even seen her enter the bar. It was unlike him, he thought dully. Usually he scanned every space so carefully, kept a log of ins and outs even when he didn't mean to. She smiled.

just lack the social awareness.”
Dean didn't laugh. He ate a bite of scrambled egg instead, ignoring the part of his brain that wanted to explore whatever memories were attached to the flavor.
Dean looked back up. His father hadn't moved, he was still leaning back in his chair, his feet up on the table. He was relaxed, not threatening.
He’d stopped trying to measure by minutes or hours. Time here was just daylight and darkness.
“Oh uh, let’s see.” He strained to remember. His brain still felt fragmented, his thoughts not quite connecting.
Breakfast was long over and John and Mary had climbed back into a restored Thunderbird (she purrs like a
Dean tried to casually slip his hands into his jacket pockets while leaning against the railing.
‘Better then how I went out, anyways. Goddamn deals. Never take the deal.” John was already moving on, grumbling as he reached for the syrup.
He put his hand down on the stone, fingers splayed out as wide as they could get, and he closed his eyes, reaching, searching, fucking praying that somewhere here he would feel the angel’s presence, feel his eyes, feel his influence. It had to be somewhere. If Cas helped, Dean would find exactly where he was responsible for and he’d let the energy wash over him, claim him, seep into his bones.
“You mean did Dad and I get into a screaming match?”
It looked perfectly fine, skin smooth and bitten nails fully regrown. There was no ugly red blisters, no puffy skin, nothing swollen or the tiniest bit out of place.
Wait. Maybe Dean did recognize this. He burst into the kitchen.
And if Dean could do anything, it was a hunt.
He pulled his hand back from the red-hot tape, shaking his hand to try and cool his finger tips, when the very ground below the impala started to shift. It looked like a map loading incorrectly in a video game, like something was pushing through the earth and the asphalt of the road was curving around the shape, coating it like rubber.
He looked around the table aggressively. Mary seemed to be vanishing into the wall. Jo looked ashamed. Mom was being so quiet it was wrong, everything about this was
“Drinks!” Bobby interjected. “Roadhouse. You were supposed to meet Ellen, Jo, and I. Remember?”
Dean was about to pick up the bible and read through the rest of the verse for clues when there was a slamming on the door.
Cas had never really figured out the relationship thing.
“Come on,” John said, laughing in that strange baritone again, “Did’ya think you’d never see us again? What? You thought I was hellbound or something?” He laughed again at the very notion.
” He chucked. “Classic.”
It’s not that he planned on being unhappy specifically, but reaching personal contentment wasn't exactly something he had ever visualized fitting on the roster. He’d stopped treating happiness like a given long ago.
“Where is he?” Dean interrupted angrily. “Where’s Cas?”
John waved him off. “Right. Anyways, I’m pokin’ around and I realize I’m gonna need two pairs of eyes for this job and none of my contacts were that far north. So I figure Dean here, he’d just turned what? 12?”
Dean turned around to face the Not-Sam. “You always forget that John Winchester is a Grade A Asshat.”
“See? Practically 12. So I ask Dean to go wait out in that barn so that the banshee ‘ill spot him and take the bait. And it’s fuckin’ cold outsude so we’re waiting and waiting and my hands are getting all numb and that’s been the bitch shows up.”
Bobby was silent next to him.
Cas sat in the silence for a moment. He cleared his throat. He leaned forward, reaching his hands out. His fingers found Dean’s, calloused and rough and entangled.
Dean remembered a moment just like this, he was trying to summon the details. There was a gun and yellow eyes and-
Not-Sam tutted at him. “Mmm-mm. Hands where I can see ‘em. Come on Dean, I’m not that easy to fool.”
John nodded silently. “Mm. Honorable way to go.” He said. “Like you wanted, right?”
Because see, the truth was becoming unavoidable. The truth was that he didn't want a hookup, or the domestic life as Steve the employee, he wanted Dean. And now, here he was, in a bar practically designed for humans to seek out eachother, to seek out sex or romance, and Dean was a million miles away.
Dean slumped back in his chair, deflating.
“This morning?”
No, he had not kept the faith. There was only one entity he’d ever prayed to, and it sure as shit wasn't God.
Dean blinked. “I-”
“Well what?” Dean took a swig. The beer was cold and tasted like the feeling of a good ending to a long day.
Behind him, below the bridge, another radio seemed to have been summoned.
Maybe this is why relationships never quite made sense to him. Because to him, love was always sacrifice. Love was Sam hurling himself into the cage. Love was shattering an angel tablet. Love was coming back after Dean looked Castiel dead in the eyes and said, coldly, “you're dead to me.”
The Impala’s radio started up again. The Night We Met by Lord Huron started drifting out across the bridge.
“I want you to say it.” Cas interrupted.
“It’s-” Dean tried to shake himself of the thought of a hero’s death as words formed unprepared on his lips- “It’s good to see you both again. I wasn't sure that was ever gonna happen.”
The melted tape shot out violently from the tape deck. Dean numbly raised his hand.
But now there were no explanations. Just silence. Cas looked down at his tea. Dean cradled a coffee. Cas knew it was at least 40% bourbon.
Dean could feel some weird anxiety growing within him as he tried to explain. He wished Sam was here. He’d know what to say. “Just. This. All of this. Something hasn't been right since I got here and this-” he pointed at the scattered pages, “Is why. It’s telling me how to fix it, Bobby.”
See, Cas had tried the causal relationship thing. He’d go to a bar, find that one person to pay attention to, make small talk, find a joke everyone always laughed at, initiate physical contact by bumping a knee or touching fingers in what could be construed as an accident. He’d done it, he’d built up to it, said all the right things, all of it, dozens of times. But he never followed through. Sure, he’d kissed a guy once or twice in a corner of the bar, feeling a strange mix of very human feelings.
Come on Eileen was an unusual song to add to the list of “things Dean didn't know he was thinking about”, a registry heaven seemed to be constantly compiling. The upbeat opening bars still brought a small smile to his face as he took a wide turn along the scenic mountainside.
“Well, he’s
Dean opened his eyes and let the tears fall silently. He pulled his hand into a fist, letting the little nubs of his fingernails dig into his palm.
in the front seat, the bridge to immigrant song playing softly.
Dean leaned against the staircase.
The song skipped again. Dean waited for it to go back to the beginning of the verse.
He couldn't place his finger on how exactly he knew.
Castiel missed that. Something in Dean had changed. Cas saw it after Amara.
It was the same song as earlier, the same one from the morning.
No, he never had much faith in God.
He crossed the room quickly and scooped her up in a spinning hug. She giggled happily as he set her down.
His brain felt fuzzy again, all of a sudden, like his thoughts were wrapped in mist. His chest was heaving and he still had things to say but he couldn't remember what.
But then he’d realize that something was off. Something he couldnt put his finger on, and he’d say he had to leave early or make some excuse that usually resulted in some upset, a finger in his face, a “bitch” uttered under their breath, a very familiar human anger.
Instead he slumped over, and let the grief wash over him.
“What a fucking concept.” He placed the glass coldy on the table. “All of you are being ridiculous tonight. Walking on fucking eggshells.” He pointed at Ellen. “You
Maybe Cas knew that too. Maybe he’d always known that.
Dean interjected again. “I was 10.”
“I-” Dean frowned. “I honestly don't. I’m sorry.”
He ran a hand over the back of his neck.
He was still angry, he knew that. Rightfully so. How fucking dare his father sit there and talk about ownership and apologies without giving him one.
He awoke to the smell of bacon. For a moment, a grin stretched across his face. Sammy finally broke, he thought. He was making bacon instead of settling for that ridiculous bran cereal.
Bobby smiled. “What can I say? I like my surprises.”
There was now a massive shape in the road, about three stories tall and filling the entire road. It wasn't really a definable shape. It almost looked like part of a massive hand had tried to reach upwards from underground.
The music was picking up. Dean’s foot tapped along.
“No, really. I don’t. I want Sam to be happy on Earth, more than anything. That’s- that’s all I wanted. For a long time.” He gazed off the porch blankly as he realized the harsh truth of that statement.
Maybe just because Cas was already on his mind, but for just a second, the bunker flashed through his mind. He remembered Billie’s fist on the door, the panic in his lungs, Castiel’s gentle smile as he threw him into the wall.
The friendly tone dropped from Dean’s voice in an instant as he caught Jo’s eyes. “Neither is-”
“Yeah, it’s not on ANY of my cassette mixes. None of them. I only got into it right before-” He stopped for a moment. “Yeah. It wasn't on my mix that was playing at the time and I hadn't set it up to play, but it did. But it was iffy- it started skipping lines and repeating and then the road glitched.”
“Say what?” John asked slowly.
The silence was back.
“Forgot- forgot what?” Dean asked, his brain scrambling to pick up some important detail. Was it a birthday? An anniversary? No, they didn't have those here. His brain felt foggy. He’d been feeling like that more and more, recently. He tried to focus.
But why would he be sent a song about atheism and the romance of rebellion? He was in Heaven. There was a God- he’s a four year old named Jack. And for the romance of rebellion, well. He’d passed up his shot at that already.
“That’s exactly what I mean, yes.” Bobby took a longer overly dramatic drink. Dean wasn't looking at him but he knew his eyes were probably rolling.
He thought the idea was kind of funny now. But maybe part of it still rang true. No, he wasn't barred from entry but maybe, just maybe,  he was marked enough to warrant some issues.Like the glitching he’d seen earlier. Maybe Heaven was broken. Just for him.
Dean shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t- I don’t think that’s it Bobby.”
“So, uh.” She smiled again, warmly. “Vampires, huh?”
He smiled. “Heya Sammy.”
The man smiled. “It gets better.”
Mary Winchester was standing in his kitchen, frying up bacon like there wasn't a problem in the world. “You're up!” She cried happily. “Hope we didn't spook you, sweetie.” She smiled again, tilted her head at Dean as her blond hair glowed in the sunlight.
And then Cas would sit there, an ineffective drink in his hand, and he’d try and avoid the inescapable thing that stopped him from following through.
Sam and Eileen were deeply invested in a game of darts. Sam was losing, very very badly, and Eileen was laughing, clinging to his elbow so she didnt fall over from laughing so hard. Sam was smiling too, his face almost cracked from it. Dean had gone up to the bar, and from the way he was looking around the room, Cas could tell he was looking for a hookup. He made eye contact with a blonde woman by the pool table, and it was over. He sauntered over to her, and Cas watched the script play out. She laughed at his jokes, grasped his arm with a strange amount of familiarity, and smiled when he touched the small of her back.
Just moments after he had all the words down, the radio began to smolder, smoke pouring out of the panel in the back. The song stopped midline.
Dean felt his brain get foggy again. “No,” he mumbled. “NO.” He said it fiercely this time, confidently. The fogginess was weakening.
excited. Free will this and free will that.” He smirked. “You ran out of free will pretty quickly, huh? Considering you spent 15 years getting it and all.” Chuck tutted at him again. “Spent it all on some rebar. How
He took a steadying breath. “And everyone knows. Everyone knows how I went out, everyone knows that I don’t fucking fit here. And I was just so sick of nobody addressing it. Of Bobby looking at me like I was some little kid to be pitied. They couldn't even say the
Because if that’s what it was, well. Then Cas had some questions.
Dean was owed a goddamn apology- he knew that more than he’d known anything. For leaving him with Sammy at age 10 in a motel room armed with a shotgun and two cans of spaghettios for four goddamn weeks, and still getting angry at Dean for having stolen food. For that time John grabbed Dean by the arm and shoved him to a wall for looking at a man funny. For that time when John took him on his first ever hunt and let him get snagged by a banshee to “put the fear of god into him.
He opened his eyes.
Suddenly, he could feel pain again. It was everywhere, in his ribs and his eyes and his head and his legs. He could feel his nose bleeding. It was all-consuming, this pain, lining every orifice of his body. He considered screaming. He didn't think his lungs could take it.
And yes, some part of him scratched at his brain whispering
Cas wanted to wince at the term “left.” He didn't. He watched Dean carefully.
“You said I was angry. You were right. I’ve been so so angry these past few years.” He took a breath. “And I took it out on you a lot of the time.”
His head felt sluggish. “W-” he scrunched up his forehead. “We?” He was wide awake now, he’d always been a light sleeper, but his brain was still trying to catch up with the world around him because there was
Everyone laughed. Dean still felt stuck in the previous conversation. His brain was trying to catch up. A beer was pushed into his hand by Jo.
John leaned back in his chair, smile slipping from his face. “Yeah. Missed us so much that you haven't been able to muster up the energy to visit once in two weeks.”
“Anyways. It was just like that. And we’re fightin’ these vamps and they’ve got clown masks for some godforsaken reason and it’s going just fine. We’ve done this dozens of times. You know how it goes.”
“Like? It’s wonderful here. Everything is pretty perfect.” He chuckled lightly, rasing up his beer as proof, “I mean, how the fuck can this actually taste like-” he checked the label- “tranquility, good labor, and sunshine? Like the fuck does that even mean?
Chuck screamed with pain, glowing white as he reverted back to Jack’s form.
“That’s right.”
He fell asleep there, with his back against the wall, eventually.
“Castiel,” he whispered, his chapped lips barely opening to let the name slip out.
“And she shows up, she sees Dean, she opens her mouth to scream, and I’m about to take the fucking shot when my hands just. Freeze up. It was too damn cold and I couldn't pull the trigger.”
It was Heaven. It’s not like he could die. Or feel physical pain.
He reached out for the eject tape button.  As soon as he touched the dash, a new tape instantly appeared in the slot, already playing.
He scrunched his eyebrows together. “I cant- I can't remember why he was there, though?”
The kitchen was empty, as was the adjacent dining table. Through the windows, Dean could tell there was no one on the porch either. There was just a small radio, old fashioned, sitting on the table.
Dean was starting to recognize the tone of his voice.
He sighed. “Anyways. Over n’ out, I guess. Amen.”
“Oh. Him.” Chuck yawned again, glowed a pale white, and within moments Jack stood there instead. Jack looked like Jack, not like how Not-Sam was a replica of Sam. Dean wanted to run to him but he knew it was Chuck there instead.
“Dean-” He began slowly.
There had been years of that mindset, constant upheaval and panic and the
Dean was surrounded by nearly everyone he’d ever lost and still felt entirely fucking alone.
“Right?” Dean said. “Exactly. It was fucking weird. And then this morning-”
Was that his problem? His lack of faith? Is that why he felt out of place here?
Dean stood quietly, fingers tightening around the hidden blade, brain itching for a plan, a thought, anything.
Louder than Dean ever thought, louder than anyone should ever be blasting any Lord Huon song, the music cut through the air. The fogg was gone, Not-Cas had backed up, Dean’s head was clear.
Dean dragged his bloody fingers across the cement quickly, trying to draw the sigil as quickly as possible. He knew the sigil like it was a part of him, etched to his bones.
He went to the door.
Maybe Bobby was right. Maybe he was making it all up. He had just said, outloud, that he wished the case was real and his to pursue. Maybe all of this really was emerging from his imagination.
“Exactly.” Bobby interrupted. “You miss him. It’s natural.” He elbowed Dean. “It was the same way with me and my family. I missed you. I feel more complete now that you're here.” He chuckled lightly again. “Don’t get me wrong, you died way too young and way too stupid but. I’m glad you're here.”
“Now that heaven fixed up the knee pain I got no excuses.” He retorted.
The world started to come back into focus while John cleared his throat and started talking. “Ooh, this is one of my favorites. Alright, so we’ve pulled up in Duluth and we’re hearing about some mysterious deaths. Multiple suicides, missing brains, self-help hotlines going cold. You know the type.”
“I heard you had breakfast with the folks this morning!” Bobby shouted down at Dean as he walked up the front steps.
Chuck smiled. “Yes, Dean. That’s how this works. I snap my fingers and you’ll forget it all. It’s a heavenly re-do.” He smirked. “Well. Heaven-adjacent.”
There’s a particular brand of tired that comes with fighting eldritch horrors and demonic entities for nearly forty goddamn years. It’s an ache that settles into your lungs and makes you wake up in the middle of the night reaching for a blade, ready to combat what's not there.
Mary slapped his thigh, as if she was a scolding housewife from a 60’s sitcom, as if he had made a mischievous joke, as if he had fondly called out Dean for something silly and sweet and goofy. It felt off. Sickly sweet. Unreal. Dean still felt half-asleep. His brain wasnt responding right.
“But I snapped today, at the roadhouse. Dad was telling some story about the first time he took me hunting as a kid, and I just, I couldn't hear it.”
That evening, Dean went on a long drive. Midway through what he imagined to be heaven’s version of the Sierras, he pulled over and clambered out of baby. Bird song danced in the air, accompanied by the gentle sound of branches in the wind.
Not-Sam scowled and sucked through his teeth. “I thought I went too forcefully on the heavenly reinvention thing. Honestly, I really debated it.”
old.”
Everyones laughing. Dean’s not sure why.
John sucked his teeth. “Nasty fuckers. It wasn't that uh-” he tapped his fork on his plate loudly, clearly trying to capture a memory, the sound a reminder to those around him to not dare interrupt, “Ben. Benny! It wasn't him, right?”
Dean hissed. “Do it. You already know the answer.”
Dean almost threw himself into the kitchen, heart hammering,  ready to grab the paring knife that he knew he’d left on the nearest counter when he was greeted by a smiling face.
The Kansas song stopped.
John’s hand tightened on his shoulder. “Hah! You're funny. Full of jokes today.”
Shit, Dean
He had fought the good fight. He had finished the race. Sure, he sprinted the last part but he did it. It was the last part of the biblical verse that tripped him up.
“How’d it go?” Bobby asked.
Dean scoffed. “Horseshit.”
A silence had fallen over the table, only broken by the clinking of John’s fork on his plate. Mom wasnt eating, and Dean was starting to dully wonder why when she spoke up.
They’d be waiting for him at the Roadhouse.
Dean nodded. It’s what he expected. “Yeah, yeah, I know. It’s just. You said Cas helped. Before. That just seemed like the type of thing he’d have wanted to sort out.”
Dean was laughing now. He turned his back on the Not-Sam. “You were really fucking close. But you guys always make the same mistake.”
Dean squatted down low to look his father in the eyes. “I fucking killed myself, Dad.”
John took a drink. ‘See? Makes it all the more memorable.”
Dean kept driving as the song played. It felt right. His brain was already turning.
Like in a video game.
He couldn’t figure out why he felt so, well off. Maybe it was that he’d been damned to hell before, that heaven couldn’t quite accept a tarnished soul. Maybe it was because Sam wasn't here yet, but Dean knew that wasn't it either. Knowing Sammy was alive was a comforting thought he held close late at night when shit hit the fan and sleep was impossible.
He sighed. “It’ll get better. I was antsy when I first got here, too.”
If John Winchester taught him anything, it was that happiness was a temporary vice. A vixen that seduced you until you were at your most vulnerable, and then it left you gutted and bleeding out on cold concrete.
“This wasn't supposed to be some full-circle bullshit,” Cas said, a small amount of unfamiliar range sneaking into his voice. “You know why I did it, Dean. I told you. Say it.”
He wanted to smack himself again. Fucking hell- how many times did he have to learn not to be angry, not to be emotional, around his father. That was a basic fucking rule-
Dean cleared his throat. “Do you remember what you said to me?”
“Your father and Ellen have always been close. It’s the Harvelles. Family friends.” Her smile was saccharine.
“I told them about how I died. I guess you know already but. Sam and I got into this barn, right? This barn in ohio? And there's these kids and we gotta save ‘em and the barn looks just like the one we met in. Remember? With the shitty gray wooden walls and the ceiling beams?”
But now, after that thirteenth sunset, he was sitting upright in bed, sheets sticking to his sweaty legs, back to the wall. He closed his eyes.
Bobby frowned. “Huh. Haven't heard of that happening here before.”
Or maybe that's not what love was.
“Okay,” he started. “I
He’d known the truth when he made the deal with the Empty. He’d known the truth years ago, while he watched Dean and Amara spiral closer and closer. He’d known the truth last week, and the week before that, and the week before that, when Dean gave him the silent treatment.
Dean didn't know what exactly he was feeling. He didn't like it.
He ran his fingers through his hair. “You had cold fingers. Jesus Christ, Dad.”
No sense throwing off everyone else’s day because eternal peace wasn't good ‘nuff for him.
“I really am proud of how you turned out, Dean. You’re a good man.”
Cas saw it. He got how it worked.
But just being happy, having that be the defining trait of one’s existence, that was a strange and foreign concept to him.
Jo blew air loudly. “Boring. Next!”
“I just. I don't understand why.” Dean’s voice was filled with more emotion than Cas knew what to do with. “I don’t. You said it too, I was so angry.” His voice was broken again. “I was this ugly husk of who I used to be when you said it. I had treated you like shit. I was-” He took a steadying breath. “You're an angel, Castiel. You're this, this incredible thing. I didn't used to think angels were capable of love, you know, back when we first met, because you were all so autonomous. But Cas, god, you just. You have so much of it for this world, for Jack, for Sam,” his voice cracked violently now as silent tears made their way down his cheeks, “for me.”
“There’s no case. You invented one by accident.”
The entire section of the song played through again, and it fell apart at exactly the same place, before looping again. By the third time, Dean got wise and willed a notepad and pencil into his hands. He scribbled down the lyrics in his chicken-scratch handwriting.
Cas nodded. His eyes found the floor again.
Mary gasped from the stove, offended. “Can too!” She protested, tossing the spatula down with joyful mock-anger.
Dean nodded distantly. “Yeah. A hobby.”
A silence filled the room. It was deafening. “I uh. I know you probably don't wanna talk to me. It’s why you haven't. Responded. Yet.” The silence expanded. Dean felt sweaty.
long, and now I just get to drive around in my car all day, and that’s it. That’s all I’m supposed to do.”
. He smiled. This one he knew was on the tape from his own physical work. He passed over the now flattened asphalt cautiously.
Dean was in a state of mild shock again.
And so he’d go home and lie in that soft bed with the navy sheets as the sun set.  Dean would watch the golden rays light up the sky until they faded into a brilliant orange, and he’d try not to think about what he was doing wrong.
The song switched to a Kanas classic. Dean resisted the urge to comment on it.
He sighed again, his breath tumbling out of him too quickly.
He turned.
It was his thirteenth sunset since arriving in Heaven.
Bobby was looking Dean dead in the eyes.
John turned to face him. “Dean!” He said, red faced, “Your turn. Funny story from Earth.”
He shook his head. “Cas, I just. I miss you. I’m sorry. I’m really really fucking sorry.”
He wanted to hit himself, the anxiety and the
He stood up from his seat. “I’m gonna go say hi to Ellen. You take your time.” He slapped the hunter on the shoulder fondly. “Pick up fencing. I’m tellin’ you, it’s pretty fun.” He moved towards the door.
Everyone laughed.
He sat on the cliff face, gazing off into the sunset. A gentle breeze filtered through his hair. He closed his eyes.
He opened his eyes slowly, and almost let out a sob at the sight.
His chest heaved as he remembered what he’d said, what he’d confessed too. He pulled over as his stomach twisted.
“Dean, sit down.”
Bobby sighed again. “Just yesterday, right before whatever glitching happened, you told me you were bored. You missed working.
Bobby looked at him sadly. “Okay, Dean. What’s the verse.”
Bobby raised an eyebrow. “Everything?”
It wasn't until Cas went to a bar with Sam and Dean that he had to properly confront what he felt.
Mary smiled. “Of course, you’d see us again, silly.” Her smile was wide. Her teeth were whiter than Dean remembered. Heaven must do that. Amplify your happiness.
Dean sat there, shell shocked.
`Four and a half drinks later, everyone was laughing.
Bobby smiled. “Sure. But I know this place,” he slapped the chair he was sitting on, “All of it, this new heaven and the entire set up, is because of you boys. That gives me pride. I did what I set out to do. Now I get to rest.”
Part of him felt self conscious- he was sitting there in a smelly stained white tee shirt and navy sweatpants, his hair stuck to his forehead and nails bit to shreds. His Mom looked perfect- white v neck top and casual jeans with curled blonde hair. She’d painted her nails, he noticed. He never remembered her doing that before. John wore what he’d always worn, a big canvas coat and flannel with heavy boots, his dark hair slicked back. It was commanding, put together.
He took a quick bite of sausage. He couldn't explain how, but he knew he’d had this exact sausage before. There was something there, some happy memory, some brand of nostalgia. He closed his eyes, trying to place it exactly. He thought he remembered Vegas and blue eyes, but he was interrupted by John chuckling.
Dean tenses again, but Cas is prepared this time, and immediately starts rubbing circles along Dean's back.
Finally, a chapter!
When she clears her throat, he throws her his most blinding smile. "How about... Two bacon cheeseburgers, two curly fries, a vanilla milkshake, a chocolate milkshake, a vegan cookie and two slices of apple pie?"
The waiter comes up to him again, asking him if he’s ready to order for about the seventh time in an evening. Dean grits his teeth, scowls.
"Did anyone else see her? What did the people you interviewed say?"
No one came to the back yard until after lunchtime, a toddler in a jumpsuit the first to make his way outside. After him came Sam, too distracted to notice the Impala behind the trees at the side. Sam was a dad.
That night the Captain did not die, nor the next, nor the one afterwards.
"I've spent two thirds of my life at sea," the Captain explained then, "it's only fair for me to die for at shore."
"Dean, the way you're eating there's no way you haven't an Omega-3 deficiency. Your skin and nails must be screaming at you. I'm not even going to start with your hair."
“I’m waiting for someone.” He huffs.
“Okay.”
questions what people mean if it's not related to a case or an apocalypse. Even then, it's usually Sam who wonders.
He's used to being famished; he's used to the hunger. Literally and metaphorically, in every sense of the word.
“We were selfish. Despite your initial rejection, you are probably the one who would have made the most of this, especially if we would have talked to you about it. We’re family. We should be able to “put up” with each other, especially if it ends up helping each other. We shouldn’t have left you out.”
When his pulse starts to jump so loud it washes over the sound of Sam's tinkering in the library, he starts to think there must be something seriously wrong with him.
Sam comes out of the bathroom when he seems it clear.  There are no teeth, skin, blood or hair that could indicate a shapeshifters changing forms in there. There is also no trace to determine where Jo is or what could have happened for her to disappear like that.
He had his fishing for nourishment and found peacefulness in the company of the seagulls. There was no need for it.
Dean wakes up, struggles a bit with food, gets in a little banter with Sam and travels with Sam for a case.
"I already tried it," Cas says, amused. "I went on a bender once."
"Sam?" He calls, voice deep and calm despite the urgency. "
Dean scurries behind Sam and briefly looks at his computer, too bright screen blinding his irritated eyes. He wonders if he has a hangover even if he hasn't touch a drop of alcohol in at least twenty hours, give or take.
"Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole."
Cas smiles at the display. He starts his pace towards the group catching the castle’s future inhabitants when Dean halts him.
Dean follows the sound to the bathroom. When he looks in, his face pales.
“But we haven’t- We need to talk about it. Dean needs to acknowledge that-”
He was about to move around to explain that he wasn't creeping on Sam and the kid to, probably, a concerned neighbour, when the knocker spoke up. The deep, familiar voice immediately made him freeze.
Dean stand up and takes the bottle of rum they've got in one of the cabinets nearby.
“How could be play a clean version?” Cas interjects, squinting at Gabriel confusedly. “We are at the beach.”
Cas nods slowly, as if something finally clicking together, and changes his demeanour, looking at Dean gentler and breathing more exaggeratedly.
"Are you okay, Dean?"
. We've been friends for
Thank you so much for your patience.
He can't remember whether the door to the corridor had sigils or not, but he now wonders whether it was some kind of traveling machine or worse, some kind of portal to a hidden world that the Men of Letters were using to protect something from civilians.
Sam's expression changes from irritated to fondly exasperated.
Heya! I'm back~
Nevertheless, his stomach relentlessly reminds him he hasn’t eaten in a while. His mind fights between all the items he could be tasting right now and the euphoria that comes with reaching a fasting goal; starts making plans of escaping his brother to give in without the vivid exposure of his shame whilst relishing in the thought of eternal emptiness if he can hold out that long.
he’s such a wimp,
, he could accept. He could learn the details later.
The next time Dean awakes, it seems that no time has passed at all.
Two chapters more to go.
Sam isn't done at the register when he passes by as they aren't the only ones leaving. When he sees Dean, he gestures him to go buy them some breakfast while he waits.
So, he knows how to fight it, he knows
By the time his fists are raw and bleeding from fighting against it and his nails aren't much better off he's short of returning upstairs to retrieve some holy oil and burn his way in.
Stiffly, almost unperceptively, Cas nods and sits.
When he lies in bed, he closes his eyes and tries to give himself in exhaustion.
"Dean," Cas scolds, "as much as I'm enjoying this, I really should do the dishes now. I know I'm not going to want to do them if I have to wait."
. Despite the emptiness of his stomach, he feels like gagging.
Also, English isn't my first language. So I apologise for any mistakes.
Dean threw his head back and downed the whiskey, immediately putting the glass down to let it be filled again.
Despite their different backgrounds, he burnt and salted him with as much honor as he's have only done for a fellow hunter.
Cas stares at him and what started as slight irritation turns to heart-wrenching guilt so fast Dean wants to punch himself. He keeps hissing instead, nails breaking into the soft skin of the palms of his hands and jaw aching as he just keeps feeling
"Sure," Dean answered, as serious about it as he was about the end of the world. "I'll take care of it."
"I... You know Sam, right?" He says nervously. Cas's attention only spikes at the
When he looks up at him, Dean fake-yawns loudly, quieting the conversation Sam and Jack were having about who-knows-what.
"Why don't you ask him?" He asks.
"Remind me to introduce you to good liquor." He says.
Cas's eyes crinkle.
After a few seconds of Dean white-knuckling the wheel in the not-quite silence of the wheels against the pavement and the motor running, Sam stops surveying him and speaks up non-chalantly.
On the other hand, he'll probably encounter the same employee as the night before and he can't handle asking her for food so soon after his feast.
The strong smell of burnt flesh that assaults him as soon as he actively inhales, though, completely disproves his previous assessment.
Dean looks down at his hands self-consciously, clenching his jaw and fists as he tries not to visibly react.
That day Dean spent with the Captain on land, running errands and sharing stories back and forth of doubtful truth. When night came, as always, the Captain and he each tool a own double shot of whiskey after their meal, stared at the thousands stars and went to bed listening to the waves crashing relentlessly against the boat and the rocks and the sand.
Cas blinks and Dean sighs, patting his own clothes and the mattress to make sure nothing has been missed.
Cas's about to answer that all he has to do is to try when another message comes, making his heart pound heavily on his chest. He blushes and stands, flying into Dean's room with some of his leftover grace.
He takes his phone, gun, dagger and flashlight and ventures outside of his room.
He steps past Cas confidently, cursing under his breath a few steps later when he can’t find any way to leave, but not slowing down, not allowing them to win.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean howl's when the shock wears off, voice raspy and somewhat painful. "What the hell!?"
“Cas,” he gulps, as Cas’s brows knit together while his hand glowingly hovers over Jo. “Can you-?”
Despite his own wishes, his eyes wandering down to Cas. Cas is looking at Dean with wide eyes from his position, lips still pressed flush against him.
Instead of wearing his signature trench coat, Cas is draped by a gay rainbow flag. On his hair, a hair band stands proudly from which little trans flags —blue, pink, and white– spring out of.  His sleeves are carefully tucked above his elbows, showing off his forearms. To complete the look, his dress shirt is pinned with so many different flags —and are those dick-pins?— the white behind them is almost invisible. Lastly, he’s flushed, and he looks so
For him, he believes, it must have grown gradually. Somewhere between Mom's death and Sammy's departure to Stanford it must have grown within him, quietly, slowly, like a virus in the air that gets only caught after its spread worldwide and taken enough rotting bodies hostage to repopulate a city or two. No one knows how it got there, or how to stop it, and everyone points at each other madly for someone to take the blame, because they need someone to get mad at.
that truly took away his ability to speak was the color of Cas's eyes.
"And I haven't even started with the greens though- are they also part of some special skin care ritual or are you just trying to turn us into rabbits, just like you?"
So Dean grunts and takes his whiskey, determined to black out somehow if his brain won't do the work itself.
Dean stiffens. "Cas, what-"
"I don't know," Cas answers. "How will I know if we don't try?"
"Okay. What-?"
He takes his shoes off and lays on the bed. His stomach hurts and everything smells like vomit.
Jack chuckles, Sam just rolls his eyes.
“Dean,” Cas quavers, so soft that Dean recoils at how quickly he feels the word demolish his defenses. “We- You-,” he takes a deep breath and tries again. “You’ve expressed many times your distaste for all things that could be considered ‘girly’ or ‘gay’.”
“You rather play ‘Pictionary’?” He adds, excitement sparking in his eyes. “We could play the dirty version.”
Dean nods, a stray tear falling with the movement. He scrubs his face furiously, angry at the dampness.
As Dean just stares, Cas visibly retracts, disappointed. He takes a step back and makes as if to walk away. Dean still doesn’t move.
Sam sighs in helplessness.
“But nothing, Dean. Massages? No chicks, or loud music, or action whatsoever? You and I know you would have thrown a tantrum-”
“Thanks, bitch.” Dean shouts behind him, burger swallowed unhealthily fast.
As Dean resigns himself to not getting any answers, Cas hums again and closes his eyes as if to take a quick nap.
"It's okay," he says, "we can talk about it later."
He's feeling
As Dean starts cooking, Sam drinking a beer nearby in case he needs to talk, Cas tilts his head and tries to approach Dean again. Before he’s able to Gabriel lays his hand on his shoulder.
He's in the diner and then he's in the bathroom, reaching blindly into the bag and eating whatever he can find first. Cramming food into his mouth like a teenager would cram a lover into their wardrobe when their parents got into their room. He hides everything inside him before he can even swallow, chokes multiple times while trying to fit everything inside him without having to taste it.
“But this isn't-” Dean interjects.
So, it’s Thursday. It’s Thursday and for a while Cas and him have been meeting up on Thursdays because Cas is supposed to be “the Angel of Thursday” and it’s a big fuck-you to everyone upstairs to meet on
Consequently, unsure of whether he’s done something wrong or something else has made Cas tense up, Dean’s body stiffens again as well. After a few interminable seconds, he retreats to get a better look at Cas’s expression,
He feels awful.
“That’s alright,” Cas enunciates slowly, “but it would also be okay if you wanted to.”
“Dude, is that Celine Dion?”
Focused as he is on Cas’s state of consciousness, his alertness on his surroundings fade. Although something feels vaguely wrong, he’s so sure the feeling has something to do with Cas, he doesn’t even consider why they’re actual there. He only realizes his mistake, his oversight, when Cas’s eyes open and widen, and, before he’s able to turn, overwhelming pain hits the back of his head and everything fades to black.
Castiel plans to make up for it. Maybe he could take Dean out. He'll get his first payment today, after all. A pizza in the park, maybe? Sounds reasonable. Dean doesn't strike him to be fancy when it comes to dates. They technically slept through their first.
Dean smirks at him. "I always knew I partnered up. But your smartness always floors me, Cass." Castiel gives him an unamused smile.
"Good morning," he greets as cheerfully as he can muster.
He loves cuddling, but after sex, he always feels a little overwhelmed by it. Probably a state of being overtouched. But Castiel's wish is his command, and it doesn't take long until he snores quietly above him anyway.
"After Dean got his driver's license, he always drove us somewhere nice. We lay on the hood and looked at the night sky. Now, we can do that again. We had to improvise with my truck." Sam chuckles. "But now it's back to the roots."
Castiel huffs a laugh. "You might be right. She's an empath for sure. That makes her really good at her job."
"What the hell are you talking about, Charlene?"
No. He's absolutely not considering it. He built a new life here, left the past behind. As much as he loves his surrogate father Bobby, this isn't an option. But it's a way better topic than the man he couldn't take his eyes off the whole evening, whose warm presence next to him made him all giddy inside, and who he didn't want to let go when they hugged goodbye.
Castiel grins. "Yes, indeed."
Castiel can't look into his hopeful eyes. They unsettle him. He knows if he agrees, everything will go up in flames. So he declines.
"Hannah promised that she and Gabe gave them a good heart-to-heart. I hope they keep their promises."
"Like the cutest cocker spaniel you've ever seen."
"What if he doesn't want to be with me anymore?"
"You're aroused," Castiel states matter-of-factly, looking at Dean's undeniable erection that tents his jeans.
Castiel turns his head to Sam, flabbergasted, and Sam's mouth falls open when he realises that he shared something Dean hadn't yet.
Dean blows a whistle. "Big name. Religious family?"
"Sorry. I was too busy making out with my boyfriend to text you," Dean quips.
He walks closer and hovers a few steps away until Castiel raises his gaze. "Sorry. I was an ass," Dean says.
He steals glances at Dean, watches how the lines around his eyes crease beautifully when he laughs, the way he bites his lip when a joke is very dark, and how his eyes light up when Benny mentions cooking gumbo the next day.
"It's okay," Castiel says. "Let go. No one will see it."
Castiel lets go of him and folds his arms over his chest. "I thought the marzipan was for me," he says in faux affront.
"There's nothing to talk about, man. All that crap you told me when I got sober, about being open and letting other people in? You can shove it up your ass."
Castiel chuckles. "Sure. But would you fuck me tonight?"
Dean nods. "And I don't expect you to, but… what you said… Cass, you know that I'll cheer you on for anything you put your mind on. I just wanna be able to tell you that I worry without you thinking you should off yourself."
"Cass! Don't…! Fuck!"
Castiel gets up and shakes the still sitting man's hand.
He fantasised about intimacy between them, came twice with Castiel's name on his lips. Yet now that he has him, Dean can't even build up enough arousal to come even close to what would likely become a measly orgasm.
He takes a shower and walks out on the balcony, just a towel slung around his waist. He can hear the waves hitting the beach nearby and seabirds screeching. He gets why Sam moved here, why he won't come back. It still stings.
"The food here is mostly decent," Dean says with a straight face, earning himself an eye-roll from the blonde. "I'll take the bacon cheeseburger with fries. And another—" He raises his nearly empty glass.
"Oh, Cass. That wasn't a party. Our parties mean way more booze, Benny belly dancing, and Rowena cursing us all in Scots."
Castiel shakes his head silently, his eyes honest and sad. "I didn't know that there was a word for it. I always thought I was broken, that I had a crack in my chassis."
Dean lets out an ugly laugh. "You hope. Sorry to bother you."
"Hey, I had more girlfriends, Lisa and Cassie were just the serious ones." Dean runs a hand over his neck. "Or do you think I shouldn't…?"
"What? He has no right to make fun of people like us who struggle. People like him wouldn't survive a single day on the streets."
Dean hopes Castiel doesn't look right through this half-truth. He is glad that they have to step aside to let people pass on the pavement. The idea of falling asleep next to Castiel is nice, maybe in his arms, maybe while exchanging more lazy kisses. That sounds like heaven.
Castiel huffs a humourless laugh. "You tell me, Dean 'I'm not attracted to my boyfriend' Winchester. You tell me."
Castiel shuffles into his room. The second bed is still empty and freshly made. It's weird to think about having shared the room with a suspected murderer. But even weirder is how lonely and sad this room feels now.
His heart swells and aches. He had promised himself to never fall for anyone ever again. And now, he's here, lying awake and wondering if this unusually long hug means anything. If the way Castiel beamed at him when he stepped out of the elevator meant anything. If the way Castiel's breath hitched when their arms brushed meant anything to the sweetest, most infuriating person Dean has met in a long time.
"Partly. They sent me to a boarding school."
Dean rolls his eyes. "It was a joke, Cass."
"We're fine. Let's forget it! Today is a new start." He flashes Dean a smile, presses a kiss to his cheek, and carries his boyfriend's duffle bag to his room.
"You're only a few weeks sober, and you're gonna start a new job in two days. I'm much further down the road. I'm good. I don't need you to baby me. I thought you'd be happy for me—daylight working hours, better pay. I could finally get health insurance."
"And now?"
Dean rolls his eyes, and Castiel grins. "Thank you, Jo. Please express my heartfelt thanks to your mother."
He hears the desk chair scratching over the wooden floor, and carpet-muffled steps walking towards the door. He wants to beg and plead. But he deserves this. Castiel is right. He lied to him. He didn't trust him enough.
"That's because you are flexible, take a break now and then, and don't
Dean gapes at him. "You don't understand. I don't want it,
Dean laughs just as humourless. "Sounds like we're a match made in heaven," he murmurs and shuffles his feet.
Working on his car is always relaxing. Well, usually it is. But not today. His hands know the moves. He did this stuff so many times before that the steps became second nature to him. But today, his hands are trembling, and he hits his head more than once with the hood.
Dean huffs a mirthless laugh.
Castiel pushes the thoughts of them away and looks at the houses the bus passes, lit windows cutting through the darkness now and then. It feels lonely, driving through the night like this. But it's a million times better than the barren room he is sharing with a guy named Cain.
"You wanna exchange presents before our guests arrive? We'd have to take a short walk," Dean asks.
"You're not useless, Dean. You're simply off-kilter. You two need to talk about your feelings. I know you hate it, but he's worth it, don't you think?"
There are postcards that he has never seen before. Some show tourist attractions across the land, some excursion destinations close to Hannah's home. There are cards with motivational quotes and many with bees. He raises his eyes, his face one huge question mark.
Dean grabs his arm. "It's not you. I just don't want to burden you with this crap."
He has no idea how he is supposed to handle this. It's the first time he attempts a relationship with a man that goes beyond a one-night stand. He just hopes that Castiel likes to top. It would make things so much easier. Maybe, this new relationship isn't doomed right from the start like the one with Lisa had been.
Charlie shakes her head and crosses her arms over her chest. "You're proof that this isn't true. If he's sexual then you'll find a solution for it. You like him, and he likes you, too. I'm sure you'll find a way to be happy together."
Castiel shrugs. "It's the truth, Dean. I won't tune it down only for you to keep hiding."
Castiel is happy that he brought his backpack today. It was empty just like the day before. Dean had teased him about not bringing lunch for his break the first night, so he had been visually prepared yesterday.
Like the day before, Dean slumps into the empty bus seat next to his colleague. He receives one of those adorable little smiles. Castiel even shows some teeth this time.
Castiel smiles even wider. "Of course. They're all family."
"No, Polish. It doesn't have meat in it. It's my late babcia's recipe."
"That's my stop, angel," Dean whispers, nudging Castiel softly.
it! Dean, this is the most beautiful and thoughtful gift anyone has ever given to me. I feel a little silly now with what I planned for you."
Of course, he would have loved to work in the field he had trained for, or at least have a day job, but he isn't in a position to be picky. No bank wanted to give him a chance. And at the end of the day, he's willing to do pretty much anything. Anything but what he did before he quit drinking, of course.
"Fine, thanks, Dean. And you?"
"I want to talk to all the employees. That's the best way to do it," Castiel states and slips into his trench coat.
Charlie bumps his shoulder. "But how else will you find out if it's seaworthy or not?"
Castiel looks into the rear-view mirror, meets Sam's gentle eyes there. The younger Winchester quirks a smile and Castiel returns it. Does Sam know? Maybe.
"That figures," Castiel chuckles.
Dean looks up, eyes soft and unsure, vulnerable as Castiel has never seen them before. "I love you, Cass."
"So, you've got nothing to say, huh?"
"No. I mean…" Dean should have kept his mouth shut. They don't know Sam, his dark thoughts, the forced smiles, the brave face. Dean knows it all or at least well enough to know that the chuckling man on the other side of the room is a stranger to him. Okay, maybe Dean is a bit overdramatic. He knows Sam laughing, pulling pranks. But life had been shitty to both of them and the only people they could always rely on were the two of them.
"That's half my brothers and cousins." Castiel chuckles. "So, you're Christian, too?"
"Enough of that. What do you wanna eat?" Dean asks in a futile attempt to hide how flustered he is.
Castiel puts the album carefully back into the box and closes the space between them. He pulls her into a big brother hug and presses a kiss into her hair. "I missed you, Munch."
nice," Dean hisses back.
Dean pulls him in for a hug. Castiel melts into the touch. He was right. Dean is an excellent hugger. Castiel lets go after what he guesses is an appropriately long time. He's never been good with things like this.
Was it a mistake to kiss him? Didn't he want him to? Maybe he's straight or just not into fuckups like Dean is. But he kissed back, right?
"I'll show you who's a dangerous breed," he says, trailing off into a chuckle. He manages to carry his boyfriend to his room where Castiel lands laughing on the bed. Dean smiles down at him. He missed this sound. They've dealt with too much serious shit over the last month. It's time to enjoy each other a little more.
"You could never be a bother." Dean doesn't hear the reply. He's hung up for real, leaving Castiel looking at the barely illuminated ceiling until dawn dips his bedroom into light.
"Yes," he chuckles. "Will go over the books and stuff. So if you need me, I'm in my office, crunching numbers."
"And this handsome fella must be Dean," she says, still smiling. "Thanks for bringing my brother home."
"He makes her very happy," the man says and his voice does things to Dean's insides he doesn't want to nurse right now. He needs to focus on his anger. Arousal isn't helpful.
"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
The shop is empty save the two of them now, and Dean allows himself to steal glances of Castiel while he cleans up the mess that Jenny left behind, because Garth had to head out early.
"Aww, you're so gone for him," Charlie teases. Dean shoots her a disappointed look.
"You…?"
Dean studies his face for a long moment. "I could walk you home," he offers. It sounds like a barely disguised plea.
Of course, Dean thinks he is.
"You're lucky that I love you even with black bits between your teeth." Dean chuckles.
"Are you sure, Dean? You just got together," Charlie reasons.
When he returns his gaze to Dean, he finds his boyfriend staring at him with an unreadable expression on his face.
Dean sighs, the relief rushing out of his lungs. He nods and mirrors the dopey smile on Castiel's face. "Awesome."
Castiel smirks at him. "And you're a good man, Dean Winchester," he says and leans in for another kiss.
They've been through so much together, but it's moments like this when Dean realises how little he knows about his boyfriend and Castiel about him.
Eight hours and a monumental slush machine disaster later, Dean and Castiel board the same bus back home.
Castiel is struck speechless. Where is all of this coming from, all of a sudden? Dean likes his looks? He always makes fun of his ill-fitting suits and his trenchcoat. And then, the second part...
Castiel pats him on his back, the movement feeling weird, so he stops. "Left something in the staff room for you. Tell me if you still agree, tomorrow."
Castiel shrugs his shoulders as if it were nothing, but pride and relief battle on his face. "He'll be alright."
"You mean what? That our sister isn't good enough for your big shot lawyer brother?" the man asks.
But today's the day. Castiel knows that it has to happen earlier or later, and better on his own terms than in the heat of the moment.
He clears his throat. "I know, not everyone likes cuddling…"
close, like the Winchesters. Maybe it's because of the things Sam alluded to earlier. Castiel wouldn't know. Dean doesn't like dwelling in the past. And if Castiel is absolutely honest, this suits him just fine.
Who could Castiel turn to when he was fed up with his boyfriend? Sam and Rowena? Less likely. He wouldn't talk to his social worker either, no matter how much he trusts Missouri. Maybe he'd call his sister? Probably not. Dean can't really pinpoint the kind of relationship the siblings share. Does she even know that her brother has a boyfriend?
She blinks at him. "Ah, probably nothing."
"I asked you. It's my first Thanksgiving with them after… I'm not sure how it's going to be, but knowing that Baby is in front of the house? Sounds like a safe way of escape."
Yes, they did. Still, it doesn't make Dean any less angry at his body. Stupid dick! He wishes he'd been born without one. It's a useless tool attached to his body, always getting him in trouble, one way or another. He's so horny as of late, but he can't come with his boyfriend in the same room. How fucked up is that!?
"Rowena would cut off your balls if she heard that."
"I—" Dean trails off and Castiel's heart sinks. It had been the alcohol. He had meant it platonically.
"You aren't—"
"I— Hey, I'm not the asshole here. He said he ate the sandwiches I made him, and he didn't."
"Are you nervous?"
"I—" Castiel frowns. No, quite the opposite. Sex was for the man to take and the woman to receive. As he wasn't into women and not into sex either, he might have shifted to what Hannah had been taught. He should really call his sister sometime.
"Where do you live?"
"Castiel got it somehow in his head that he doesn't deserve nice things. But I guess he is on the way to recovery regarding that." Dean raises a questioning eyebrow. Hannah laughs. "I meant you, Mr Winchester." Dean can't help but beam at her.
Dean stalls.
Dean pulls him into a tight hug. "Forever then."
They fall silent for a long moment. "I'll prepare dinner," Charlie offers and disappears into the kitchen.
Castiel nods. "I'm not used to this," he confesses quietly.
Dean leans their heads together, uncaring that Castiel's hair sticks sweaty against it. "I love you, too, you know?"
Dean chuckles. "I get it. I don't know what I'd have done if Sammy didn't like you, or the other way around. But Hannah is nice. And this Gabe sounds great."
"I fucking love you, man, and Lis knows. She's known for months and now she's gone. Taken Ben, and left me the house. She doesn't want anything. A whole year, and she leaves because I can't stop loving you."
It's been so long since someone hugged him. He's sure Dean is a great hugger, strong and soft at the same time. Castiel shakes himself out of his reverie when Dean pulls his arm back again and fishes for his phone. He didn't even hear it ringing.
Dean looks at him, Castiel's silence unsettling to the core. "Do… do you like it?"
"Well, nothing bad, I hope. Um… you know that I invited everyone via email?"
Dean leans his forehead against Castiel's. "You'll stay?" He doesn't give a shit how needy and vulnerable he sounds.
Castiel quirks an eyebrow. "It tastes better and now that I can, I want to watch what I put into my system."
, not since the first day. Castiel seems to be the only one off the cards. It can't be a colleague thing either, because Dean flirted with Jenny, and even Castiel was able to see that she wasn't the least interested.
Dean makes a dismissive gesture and opens a bottle of beer. "It'll get better eventually. I put on some weight, too, after I got my first proper job that actually paid the bills."
He tries to block out Castiel's noises. They should be arousing, but not for Dean. His cock is achingly hard by now, thanks to Castiel's clever mouth. Thank god for little mercies. Still, Dean doesn't know if he'll be able to come and he's already close to overstimulation.
Castiel looks after her and shakes his head. It's going to be alright. He walks over to Jody. "So, first day, huh?" she asks, smiling.
He'd love to show Dean the beautiful autumn colours in Vermont, but his savings aren't big enough for that. But maybe a weekend trip for Dean's birthday. He hopes he can save enough money until Christmas for that. Dean deserves this. And Castiel is taking good care of his health. He won't need a doctor for a while.
Jo chuckles and shakes her head. Then she stretches out her hand. "Hi, I'm Jo. My mother owns the Roadhouse. Dean and I have been friends since he and Sam moved here."
Dean suppresses a hearty laugh. They definitely drew the long straws when it comes to the people seated around them. End table or not, they most definitely have more fun than the stuck up people on the other side.
There had been a time when Castiel was absolutely oblivious to such signs—until Gabriel gave him the flirting 101 because he couldn't believe that his little brother never brought someone home or got frisky behind the school gym. Part of it was Castiel not even realising that he was being hit on. But frankly, he was simply not interested. Not like the other kids in class.
is turning me on. I like the
Dean smiles at him in that calm way that usually makes Castiel take a deep breath and reassess a situation. But this time, it only seems to fan the flames.
Maybe, if they had dated longer before he moved in... Maybe, if he had been more open from the start... Maybe, maybe, maybe.
Castiel pushes up into a sitting position and leans against the headboard. He rubs his eyes. "What time is it?"
Sam screws up his face. "I have no idea."
"We won't risk your rehab for a silly game night, Dean." Her voice brooks no backtalk.
Dean breathes out a sigh. "Have you eaten yet?"
Castiel bites his lip before he says, "I won't apologise."
"Oh, I know that face," Benny drawls. "You have the hots for him."
Dean bites the inside of his lip until he tastes blood. He hates emotional moments, and he knows this will become one if he continues. But he's so tired of hiding, of the shame that crawls under his skin. It can't be so hard to say it out loud, can it?
Dean works his jaw. "He knows that I'm against his fasting."
he reminds himself.
Dean smiles. "Does that mean you'll have breakfast with me for once?"
He shuffles to the door. Hannah smiles at him, a cardboard box in hand. He motions her to come in, suppressing a yawn. She puts the box on the desk and wrings her hands.
Dean shakes his head. "He wasn't all bad."
Yes, he doesn't know Rowena, but Sam does. Well enough to want to marry her. Sam, who thought he was too toxic for a real relationship. Dean always told him that this was bullshit. And now that his little brother is finally listening, Dean acts like a jaundiced ex?
Dean chuckles. "I think he said it
He presses a kiss on the corner of Castiel's lips. "Need a moment?"
"Creepy," Dean calls, heat rising into his cheeks. He's still not used to being looked at like this. With so much love and devotion. Castiel said he had to learn to live with it. Dean's trying, but as of yet, it still makes him squirm. But in a good way.
Dean cleans him up before he covers him with a blanket and goes to work in the kitchen. A well-infused pasta salad is better than a fresh one anyway.
Although, the stuffed animals still bother him sometimes. Claire and her girlfriend Kaia picked up on Castiel's collecting passion, and bring something home for him from every place they finish a job. And the young women are busy, now that Dean and Castiel are retired from the family business. Teeth-gnashingly, Dean accepts the precarious pile of stuffed animals that might bury them like an avalanche in their sleep one day. It would be a gentle death, at least.
"It's okay, Dean. I know I gained a lot of weight. And you're right. I could lose a pound or two. And then you wouldn't have to fix my wardrobe. I'll talk with Sam about this intermittent fasting thing he always raves about."
He sleepwalks to the bus stop and shows the driver his monthly pass, scanning the other pre-midnight passengers. They mostly look like leftovers, tired and exhausted, a man in a white button-down and a baggy trench coat aside. He looks at least awake. More than Dean could say about himself if the reflection in the bus window is anything to go by.
Dean lifts his hips to keep his crotch from touching his boyfriend, but Castiel has other ideas. He pulls him down again, lips trailing over his neck, and Dean can't help but moan at the touch and the sudden firmness against his cock.
Castiel breathes a sigh. "I really appreciate your words. I know he's your friend. You don't need to comfort me."
Dean scans the people in the room, mainly the bride's family and he swallows hard. Yes, he's the odd one out. He only owns a single suit, so he couldn't wear it tonight. Is it that? Is he jealous? Or anxious to lose Sam?
So Dean grits his teeth, swallows his tongue, and plays nice around her, even going as far as agreeing to be his brother's best man. He will still be there when Sam comes running with his heart broken and with his tail between his legs.
"Shh, it's alright," Castiel tries to soothe him.
Dean stops still when he touches a small magnet, nestled between a soldier figure he played with growing up on the backseat of the Impala, and a flyer for a wedding venue that was haunted by a ghost before he and Castiel banished it. He took the leaflet, just in case. It's stupid, of course. He's officially dead and he won't marry Jimmy Novak. No way! And it's not as if he would think about marriage, or giving kids made orphans by the supernatural a home or something.
Dean leans against the stall door. What a weird place to have this kind of conversation. But who cares? They are both odd in their own ways.
Dean nods. "You should visit us, sometime."
Dean laughs and walks to the fridge. Castiel follows him with his eyes. He likes the way Dean moves, so smooth, seemingly one with his body.
"Crap! What about Billie?—Right.—I could ask Garth, but with Bess pregnant, I'm not sure if he can make it.—Okay. See ya."
Maybe.
"No problem," Dean chuckles. "You get my engine started with your voice alone, no matter what you say."
Castiel tilts his head to the side and squints at Dean, who is struggling to hold his gaze, blushing fiercely. In a split second, Castiel makes a decision. Maybe he's a fool to try it one more time. Maybe the man in front of him will be his final downfall. But the pull is so strong that he stops fighting against his feelings.
Castiel chuckles. "Sounds like a plan."
Dean gapes at him. "You…? No. It's just now and then… It doesn't have to mean anything."
Dean pulls him even closer and cards a hand through his hair. "But not only bad things right?" He can feel Castiel shake his head no. "Good. I'd be offended if it were so."
Castiel shakes his head. "It reminds me too much…"
"Who's that?"
Charlie elbows her. "I can run a background check on him, Dean, if you want."
"I thought calories are stupid?
Dean takes a gulp of his tea. "I don't know. He's eating at home. But why would he hide it from me if there wasn't something fishy about it?"
Castiel closes the distance between them, folds his hands behind Dean's neck, and kisses him softly on the lips. "That, it is."
Castiel doesn't care for those human categories. He's in love, and his beloved is close and safe next to him. That's all he needs.
Dean takes a breath, feeling like he hasn't drawn air for days. He nods, walks to the kitchen, and fixes the items with magnets on the fridge. Then he looks at the three-coloured magnet in his hand. He may not really have hidden his sexuality, but he didn't show it proudly either. Maybe it's time for it now.
But all of them are circling around the Winchester brothers in one way or another, and it always comes back to Dean, who makes him smile until his face hurts, his heart racing until it threatens to beat out of his chest, and a million knots tying his stomach tightly when he sees Dean kiss his wife Lisa, who is lovely, and beautiful, and everything Dean wants in his life. So Castiel loves her, too. Because she makes Dean happy in a way their friendship can't.
"How did you…?"
Castiel nods and spreads chopped chives over his bread slices. "Maybe I could put an alarm for a late lunch on my phone, and have breakfast sometimes. I heard the Roadhouse has a great Sunday brunch." He smiles tentatively.
"My apologies."
Castiel gives him one of his close-lipped smiles, his quiet real ones that Dean adores so much. "So are you."
He squints at the screen when he finally gets hold of his phone with clumsy fingers and picks up swiftly when he sees who it is.
Charlie moans. "That's so good. If I weren't gay, I'd marry you, Cass."
Dean stares at him for a long moment, then nods. "And what if you found out that I did things I'm not proud of?"
Castiel's lips curl into a smile. "I told them he had to deal with a private matter, and his start day is in six weeks anyway. Until then he'll be back on his feet again. You'll see."
"About what? That you lied to me? That my best friend and
"Nothing like that. I'm Castiel. We're happy to have you. If you need help, you can always talk to me. Okay?"
Castiel snorts without mirth.
It's calm in the petrol station so close to midnight, and Dean flashes a toothy grin at Garth, his colleague from the evening shift, as he walks straight to the staff room to get changed. He hates that ridiculous blue vest, but they are allowed to wear anything beneath it, as long as it looks decent. Dean shrugs out of his flannel shirt and takes a sip from his flask. He pops in a piece of chewing gum and returns a minute later to the front.
Thank you so much to everyone who read this story. 💙 Its topics are close to my heart, and even though it might not be read by many, I'm still glad that I wrote it. 💚
Charlie explains the rules. Benny pierces Castiel with a strange look as if he wouldn't trust him to be on his team. But he has no choice. It's men against women tonight. Luckily, Benny's girlfriend nudges him into his side, and Castiel can concentrate on Charlie's explanations again.
"I don't want to impose," Castiel says. He's happy for Dean that he has such a great relationship with his brother, not a stiff and cool one like he has with most of his siblings.
Castiel understands his anger, but he never promised him anything. But Dean seems to think so, and who is Castiel to disagree? He probably just missed it. Even though he understands and loves Dean in so many ways, some things still go over his head. Did he break a rule that he wasn't even aware of? Or is this about praising his sandwiches without tasting them? And what notes did Dean talk about?
"I'm so sorry, Dean," Lisa says.
His way to look at men is one of the things that separates Castiel from other people. Nudes or skimpily dressed guys don't do much for him. He can enjoy the aesthetics of the human body, no matter the gender. But if it comes to finding a man attractive, he prefers him well-dressed, well-groomed, a bit of skin exposed, but not too much.
"In my experience," she interrupts him softly, "secrets poison a relationship. I ain't gonna tell ya what to do. But there ain't nothing to be ashamed of, honey. You are so strong and went through so many things."
She slides closer to him. "Do ye like boys?"
Dean opens the box that holds the few things he still might call his own forever. Like the picture of him and his mum before she died. Well, the first time when he was a kid. There are bits and bobs, knick-knacks picked up on the road, too. A tiny drawing that a little girl made for him after he saved her and her parents on a solo hunt. It's yellowed and crinkled. He smiles at it. That had been one of the good days.
Dean nods, biting the inside of his lip. "Yeah. I mean, I learnt from the mistakes I made in our relationship."
Dean tightens the hold on Castiel's hand. "Then they were assholes who didn't deserve you, Cass."
done.
It's freezing cold and card haven't really stopped storming by all night. Every time he felt himself falling asleep, a honk or a garbage truck would drag him out of Morpheo's arms.
He doesn't know how long it's been like that. He's been in an emotional turmoil ever since he woke up this morning and besides a quick greeting to Sam, he hasn't been paying attention to his surroundings.
Cas sighs. “Dean, I-” he says, shaking his head, “it won’t happen again.”
– to turn around and get into the diner, shame be damned, when his eyes fall upon a couple vending machines near the diner's back door.
Although as he drops the issue he dims a bit, the second he glances at Dean again the amusement returns to his eyes.
He speed-walks to the diner at the right of the motel and thanks his luck that it's still open.
"Of course I do," placated Cas.
"You said, and I'm quoting here, you said,

"Dean," Cas interrupts. "We both know that isn't true." When Dean opens his mouth, indignant, Cas jumps in again. "If you're gonna lie," he enunciates, "I'd rather go to bed."
It's night and Cas's fresh in the bees PJ's Sam got him for his birthday when his newly acquired phone chimes with a notification.
The room is dark when they get in it, curtains closed. The bed is made sloppily as if Jo left in a hurry. Dust covers the few free surfaces, but the room's otherwise empty.
They drive almost silently, Bon Jovi blaring in the background, and Dean wonders if Cas could help him figure it out.
Of he knows about the

The temperature is also steadily rising and before he knows it, Dean's sweating through his flannel.
Out of the blue a hand settles on Dean’s right shoulder. The warmth seeps through the clothes and into his skin and Dean wants to cling so badly, cling to
Regardless of the absolute straining of his senses, he can't hear anything beyond his breath, his pounding heartbeat that keeps trying to race beyond sound speed, and the gravel underneath his feet.
Dean gulps as he catches up with what’s going on and chides himself for his selfishness; for soaking up Cas’s comfort and getting constantly distracted instead of immediately directing him towards Jo. It’s unacceptable.
He parked besides Sam's backyard and waited.
See ya in a couple of days again ;)
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe he knows about the self-hate and the disgust and the rage and the goddamn relentless
His grip on the sheets below him tightens as he rolls onto his stomach, trying to hide from the offending sun light that blinds him even through his close eyelids.
"I like you," he said, simple and concise.
I'm very very sorry, but insomnia and uni and other stuff are kicking my ass so I'm late. I know I am late, and it will still take a bit more time.
Dean came back to the same shore he had parted off. He got sick the first time he set food on land, too used to the rocking motion for the gravity to take ahold of him properly. His body wobbled, weirdly weighed down. It took him a few days to stomach something; a week to sleep and walk around feeling alright.
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asks quietly.
Several times through the process, Dean opens his mouths as if to speak. He clears his throat, or he coughs, even once, he burps. He doesn't say anything.
"Cas?"
There are tear marks on his cheeks from the pressure he's out on his head, from the strain he's put on his body. These tears aren't emotional, they're due to effort.
Sam huffed at the thought.
"Yeah, yeah." Cas interrupts. "Just think about it. Okay?"
"There's nothing to heal."
“Cassie,” Gabriel cautions. “
Dean looks around, dejected. “So, this was all

As if on cue, he hears him bemoan from the bathroom, causing his heart to jump suddenly. He feels as if it's trying to run away from his chest.

From gas station to gas station, from North to South, from coast to coast. And when he got to the east coast he was lucky enough to find a worn-down Captain down a road.
“Dean,” Cas breathes, air knocked out of him in a single sentence. Dean’s eyes harden as his stance straightens and all emotion vanishes from his expression.
And as he saw Cas's eyes; as he stared into the abismal ocean within it, he knew, with certainty, that what the Captain had tried so hard to convey the night they shared a piece of their pasts was true.
He sees Sam turn, but that’s all he’s able to take in before his body gives in, leaving everything that happens after a mystery.
"Anyways," He utters, "Ellen called. Jo's been missing for over a week."
It says, and Cas can picturing sulking while he wrote it. "
"Shhh," Cas shushes him, "it's okay.*
Despite his earlier announcement, Dean waits by the table until Sam and Jack leave.
“Just peachy.”
He can tell there’s more people around him. It smells like sweat and blood and
Dean doesn't know when he got used to the hunger.
He clears his throat and Sam looks up, expectantly. When Dean gestures to the bottles, Sam frowns, but accepts anyways.
“Of course,” says Cas standing up and shaking the sand off him.
"Look again." His voice breaks. He forcefully clears his throat, but it doesn't help. "Cas,
Dean flinches.
"Fine," Sam concedes. "But wash your teeth first."
Cas hums thoughtfully. Dean taps the wheel and bites the inside of his cheek as he wait.
tired of this. Of talking around each other like they're buds, like neither of them want to take it further. He rubs his eyes.
Sam focuses on Jo again, trying to help her as much as one can without healing powers or an education on medical studies, and Dean turns to try to improve his focus.
. Not
Cas doesn't push him. He does close the distance between them, though, trying to reassure him without words.
That night the Captain's home seemed too empty without a captain to occupy it. He took his pillow and laid down on top of the boat, the sea rocking him to sleep.
Before he can acknowledge Sam's heavy footsteps coming back towards him, something glacial and wet falls all over him, making him squeal like a little kid.
Oh, and before I forget, the song of Sam's ringtone is Immortality by Celine Dion. This isn't a songfic, I won't make a habit of this, but I just had to. I hope you didn't really mind.
Sam's face turns into a bitch face, but he doesn't complain, and when he turns to face the window, he does it to hide the small secret smile that appears at getting his brother back.
Nevertheless, Dean can't allow himself to sleep. There's some kind of senseless pain on his chest, which he's gotten quite acquainted with in the past, its inconsistent presence almost invisible by now.
So, there really isn't any reason for anything to happen; there isn't
"Fine," Sam relents. "I meant what I said.
When Dean turns back towards Jo he has to blink a few times as the dizziness overwhelms him and his sight darkens. He doesn’t faint, he never does.

And... Well, it's finally here.
“Wanna play a game?”
" Sam interrupts tiredly. "I need coffee. Take a shower, change. I don't care. Just, hurry up. I'll check us out. See you in twenty? I'll tell you everything in the car."
Dean huffs and blinks, trying to will the irritation and desperation away. It's not time to blow up.
, anything.
Cas turned his head, eyes hopeful and disbelieving as he asked. "We? Our?"
Dean yawns as Cas's pulse quickens and waits for Cas to come back to him.
While it's a blessing due to everything he's been through and all he would feel if it didn't help him repress it, it can also be a curse when he has to focus, such as when he's fighting, reluctantly researching or maintaining a conversation without the irritation of the effort of having to focus when he's
He hesitates at the door, shuffling with his hands and his pockets and his keys and his credit card, but rushes onto a stool when the exhausted-looking redhead looks up from the register.
The longest it's ever stayed was seventeen days, sometime between Sam's loss to Lucifer's cage and his soulless return.
Dean drops his gaze; Cas’s voice stuttering and fading into silence at the sheer, heartbreaking power of the gesture. Expecting disappointed yelling, pity, or, simply, for Cas to leave, Dean clenches his jaw until it hurts.
for change.
After Sam takes her out and he can breathe and think and see clearly again, he forgets because it doesn't really matter.
He checked himself into the nearest motel and, waking up before dawn as was usual to him, he showered, the sea salt still lingering to his skin, and shaved the beard he had unintentionally grown.
That's how Dean finds himself in the Bunker sitting across Sam in a meal he insisted they had to have together.
Cas chuckles and follows him down to where Jack’s seated. The castle’s already well-built by the time they get there, but that doesn’t stop them with having fun adding elements that castles most likely have never had.
Thoughtfully, Dean turned towards them, interrupting. "There was a song the Captain used to like, always muttered it under his breath when we went sailing. It was something like li- lobe- What's the word for freedom in Spanish?"
He closes his eyes and exhales. “Cas,” he murmurs, “where the hell are you? For Chuck’s sake I hope you’re okay because if he-”
So Dean took Baby and drove, and drove, and
They park directly in front of the motel Jo was staying in and immediately ask for a key to her temporary room, making up a story about how she's their sister who they were visiting as a surprise as they suddenly remembered she was in town when they were passing by and thanking their lucky stars that they can back it up because they know which fake identity she uses as Ash had just made it for her.
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts. Please."
“I don’t-”
The rest of dinner flies by peacefully.  There's some kind of nougat chocolate cake as dessert to congratulate Jack on his accomplishments. Cas can feel Dean's gaze on him during the remaining of dinner, but he doesn't think anything of it. It's not the first time Dean does it without following up on it.
Dean's not oblivious to Sam's posture though, and his mind starts to fill with paranoia about what Sam could know.
"It's clean." He says, voice low. Dean closes his eyes and lets Cas take the glass from him, Cas's hands caressing his' all the way through. Cas rinses it one more time and dries the glass and both his hands before looking at Dean.
It's been over an hour since Sam went to bed and Dean still can't allow himself to sleep.
When he washed his teeth, he can still taste the acid and bile in his mouth; the supposedly refreshing toothpaste turning almost too chilly to bear with his sudden sensitivity.
Cas pours both their drinks and watches Dean as he downs it immediately. Cas is still watching when Dean licks his lips, unaware of Dean's eyes locked on his reaction.
Dean rolls his eyes. "I'm
"I," he caughs, "I didn't have enough time to talk to anyone." His voice grows stronger as he goes on. "I saw Jo and came back to tell you. Not m'fault you're the Usain Bolt of research." He adds, giving Sam a half smirk as to lighten the tension in the car.
?” Dean grunts.
"Dean?"
Fighting the black at the edges of his vision, Dean feels his own hands to find out what his restraints are. He can barely move them by a very small amount, but it’s enough to tell there aren’t really any physical restraints on him.
While he waits, Dean’s gaze travels through the room, only stopping when his eyes land on Jo. Urgently, without really meaning to, his body stiffens and prepares for a fight, ready to convince Cas of at least healing Jo before disappearing forever possibly forever. Before he’s able to speak up, though, Cas leaps towards him, Dean’s body tensing further in surprise as Cas drapes his body over his awkwardly.
So, he turns to the end of the bed and slowly, cautiously, lowers his feet onto the freezing ground, stands up without disturbing too much the decaying mattress, takes his keys, and quickly leaves the room.
Before he can dwell too much on it though, he hears Sam growl something. Afterwards, well, he doesn’t know, because a pair of black boots still in front of him, and unable to close his eyes on time to feign unconsciousness, something falls on him and everything, as much as he tries to cling to
Dean has been working on his car, whilst Cas is finally taking care of a greenhouse Sam's allowed him to construct just outside the bunker.
Dean shoves the burger in his mouth and smiles at Sam’s grimace. Before Sam can leave, he talks around the mouthful. “Ghifh ufh a minufh.”
take him by surprise.
"Dean, I'm here. How can I help?"
to talk about this, about
Dean laughs. "
, or if he’s pissed as his dad for making him frown upon everything different, or if he’s mad at himself for the feeling he gets when his own desires —he’s aware of, but they are
"I've seen you with that car of yours, Baby?" He said, eyes glinting with something, "you have to understand, my boat's like your car. It's my life partner, my whole life. I need you to promise me you won't let it die."
,” Sam warns, fighting off a blush. Dean sighs, at least Sam’s safe. Well, as safe as one can be with Gabriel around.
When Jack came back and brought most people back to existence, well, there wasn't much to do.
Dean pouts, barely nodding before he stands up and strides past Cas.
Sam hums pensively.
He glances at Cas sideways and asks trying to convey confidence, although even to his ears he sounds weak and unsure.
As he gets further into the bunker, he starts to pick up the sound of wind and water running, almost as if he were wandering into a whole different place, away from monsters and danger and home. He can't help but feel he's walking right into a trap.
He had taken the bottle of whiskey and served them both, but before either glass could touch either of their mouths, the Captain had looked at Dean and furrowed his brow.
He can make out a group of people. Some lying on the ground as he is, and some hastily moving across the room. As he squints hard, he recognizes that only five people are standing. Stumbling towards the door are a blond girl, Jo, helping someone, who seems to be badly injured, get out.
When he got back to the shore and sat down to his glass of whiskey, there was no one there with him. The stars still shone brightly and the waves still crashed, but it didn't really dawn upon him how much his social immersion depended on the old Captain until the story didn't come.
The oh-so-visible resignation in his features jerks Dean into movement.
Sam looks up from his computer. Dean's mouth closes automatically as he sees his expression.
He's exhausted.
It doesn't have a handle or a keyhole. Honestly, if the wind and water weren't tellingly roaring beyond the door, Dean would have probably thought it was just another wall. Another sealed dead end in a bunker full of unpleasant surprises.
As their eyes meet, Cas’s lips turn into a wide grin. He makes a show of lapping at his own lips as he straightens up and smiles. His grin broadens as he discreetly glances down at Dean’s lap.
“Cas, I’m not a fucking fag.”
She blushes and scrambles herself into the kitchen, nodding slightly to let him know she's on it.
“What have you
"Sam," Dean definitely
“Sure.” Gabe shrugs.
The next day he took the boat in spread his ashes somewhere at sea, knowing the ocean would spread them around and take them in as if they were part of it. And they
"You mean, the case you almost died and then drunk so much we had to leave late the next day?" Sam answers, irritated.
But when he lies in bed, eyes closed, breathing steady, and his brain doesn't quiet, he wonders whether Sam was talking about this.
Weeks after the sentence hasn't left its overstayed welcome in Dean's mind.
, and if he eats right now, he fears he probably won't be able to stop.
Cas blinks at him before lowering his eyes, “I’m sorry, I just-”
Despite what Sam might have said, there wasn't any room left for Dean in that quaint perfect house. And, if there was, well, what would a worn-down hustler be good for in Sam's perfect dreamlike apple pie life?
It's not even a special day. There isn't a case to justify it, nor a shocking experience that makes him reveal anything. He isn't hit by a curse, nor touches anything weird, nor drinks some kind of truth serum that makes him babble about his childhood memories and his undying lust for women and men alike. The culprit of it isn't even magic.
There's a vending machine at his right when he manages to focus again. Dean thinks of buying something but ends up staring at it indecisively until a feeling like he's being watched overcomes him. He surveys his surroundings tentatively, but nothing abnormal catches his eye.
"Call when you got home safely," Hannah says and pulls Dean into a tight hug. "Take good care of my big brother. And of yourself." Dean raises a questioning eyebrow. "You didn't touch your wine," she whispers.
"I thought you could be on food duty today, whatcha sayin'?
"I could need some shut-eye," Dean says and yawns as if on cue.
Dean is snoring next to him, a warm, firm presence, an anchor in Castiel's swivelling merry-go-round of thoughts. He'll have to learn to trust this. To trust Dean with his whole heart. He'll get there. But it'll take time.
"Naw, Crowley, I'm good," Dean retorts. He looks at Castiel with a soft smile adorning his face. "Got everything I need right here."
Castiel holds his breath but takes his hand nonetheless.
"Oh, Dean. I—" Castiel is speechless.
"Dean, you should drink a huge glass of water and go to sleep. I'll bring you a hangover breakfast and we'll talk. Okay?"
"Oh," he says and leans forward to place a kiss on Dean's forehead.
"That's what you said, Anna, the first time you met Sam," the man chuckles.
He slams a pillow over his head and groans into the mattress. Why is he doing this to himself? Even if Castiel should be interested in him—Dean knows that everything will go up in flames as soon as those dreams move from fantasy to reality.
Adler leans back in his leather chair. Castiel can imagine what he thinks of him. He had been in an equally prestigious position. He won't fool himself and think that he was less arrogant than the man opposite him. Since he's fallen, he sees the world a little differently. It's not black and white anymore, right or wrong. There are a million shades of grey in between, and more importantly, so many more colours.
"Wanna come in? I'd like to introduce you to Rowena's best man."
"Okay," Castiel says when the bus is gone.
makes the best fancy cakes in all Kansas. But his schedule is already full to the brim, and Sam breaking his foot right before his big birthday party comes at an unfortunate time.
"It's Scottish Gaelic for 'my love'."
Walking home the day before had been arduous. He most definitely didn't want to repeat this experience just to bring a hospitality gift. So he forwent the trip to the laundromat and had money left to bring some kind of snacks. He was lucky to find a huge tub of popcorn in the reduced section. He peeled the price labels off in front of the supermarket, earning himself a few strange looks. Humans. Sometimes, Castiel fucking hates them.
"Thank you. I'm really happy that they trusted me with this."
Dean chuckles at his brother. "As if we'd do the dirty, bitch."
Sam chuckles, but it sounds strained. "Yeah. Um… I simply used the same header as last year. It's always the same people anyway. But I forgot…"
Lisa's eyes grow wide. "He doesn't know? He's been your best friend for over a decade! How did you explain to him why we broke up?"
Dean smiles at him bashfully. Castiel loves how vulnerable Dean allows himself to be around him. Right from the start, but especially since they tried to have sex the first time, ending in confessions none of them had expected.
Dean jumps off the sofa, pacing through the living room. "How could he? Everyone needs sex. Everybody wants sex."
Missouri smiles at him kindly. "I didn't correct him. I also didn't blow your cover. But, honey, if ya love him, he deserves to know the truth."
Dean can picture him vividly—a leer on his face, sweet-talking people into feeling safe and then smiting them with the snap of his fingers. That man has to be evil incarnate and Dean won't pussyfoot around him. No way!
Dean loves that Castiel cares so much. He said it was because of him, but Dean can't really believe that. Castiel loves so freely. He may not have been built to do so, but he grew and emancipated himself from his original purpose or came closer to the essence of it. Who cares?
His own room. Not a cardboard box under his sleeping bag, not a bunk bed in the homeless shelter, not a shared room with creepy strangers. A bed, a desk, a dresser, some shelves on the wall. Not that he has much to put in and on those. Not yet. But his window has a nice view on the park, the trees blocking out the shrubs behind which he used to sleep.
"You son of a bitch," Dean slurs over the phone, clearly intoxicated.
"Wait, kiddo, do you accuse me of having an alcohol problem?"
Castiel gives him a strange look, well knowing that the only way Dean would consume the fruit is with a big blob of whipped cream on top. "There is blueberry, too, love."
"I have a fitting belt buckle, too," Castiel chirps as he walks to the apartment door.
Castiel blushes deeper.
Castiel closes the distance between them, cups Dean's face with both hands, and just like that, they are kissing again. Slow and languid, hands in each other's hair, noses brushing softly.
. But, yeah. He was right. Come, I made you some PB&Js."
"You should probably care more about where your cock goes than that of others," he replies into Gabriel's ear.
Castiel pulls back. "Why not? You love it."
There is another pause, probably filled with a head shake Dean can't see. "I don't like crowds of people. And my family is, well, my family. I love them, but it's complicated."
"I think I was maybe twelve or thirteen. I had just put Sammy to bed when John came back to that shitty motel we were staying at, drunk like most of the time. He offered me my first beer, and I accepted. No worries, I didn't drink often as a kid. Still got all of my brain cells."
Dean looks at him for a long moment. "Why did you go down on me, then?"
Dean worries his lip. "I'm sure you'll find something. I'll help ya."
Castiel chuckles without mirth. "You say that now."
Dean looks in the direction she is nodding to. "Yeah. Sam always had more female friends."
Hannah promised him to send a few things which she kept for him in her garage. Dean had offered to drive him the five hours one way with Sam's pick-up truck, but Castiel had declined. He's not ready to introduce his boyfriend slash flatmate to his sister. He's not even sure why. It's not as if he wants to hide Dean or their relationship.
"Sure. Coming right up." And with that, Jo disappears into the kitchen.
Dean's blush grows even deeper. "What are you? A tea sommelier?"
Castiel rolls his eyes. "Yes, Dean. Pick me up at six."
Or it's simply Castiel's past that whispers untruths into his ear, makes him second-guess his fortune. He wishes he could tune the voice out.
"’M fine," Dean repeats. "Just tired and thirsty."
Dean beams at him. "Yes. During the summer festival, we have a free view on the stage from our balcony—admission free!"
Hannah nods. "I sent her flowers and a gift hamper. It wasn't enough."
Charlie nods. "He should seek help. It can't be healthy. Yesterday, I found him sitting on the bathroom floor, holding his stomach."
If he were honest with himself, he would hate that man for unrooting him and baby Sammy after their mother's death. But he still struggles to feel anything but numb when it comes to John Winchester. It's not worth unpacking things. His father is dead for years now, and one shouldn't speak ill of the death.
Gabriel leans to Dean's ear. "Our baby of the family has finally found someone stupid enough to marry into this freak show. Naive girl, but I bet a good fuck. If he ever finds out what goes where. But if even Castiel managed that…"
Dean's face falls for a second before he composes himself again. Castiel grabs his hand and squeezes it. His boyfriend gives him a strained smile and an 'I'm okay' look.
Of course, that doesn't mean that Dean isn't teasing him about the growing pile of plushies, everything from
Dean runs his fingers through the items that he only spilt from the drawer in a rush, already too late because of a hunt popping up. Castiel didn't comment on his tardiness. Dean knows that he worries about losing him. He can see it in his eyes, every time he needs to heal him. But Dean is worried about him, too. He has seen him die too many times. Castiel may be an angel, but he's far from invincible.
Castiel chuckles and cups the back of his head. "You never do. But I want to know what you need from me the next time it happens. Or when you rut against me at night."
Dean knits his brow together. "Bad day?"
Castiel swallows hard. "You're not a mess, Dean. You are strong and caring…"
"Kevin?"
"Sure," Dean says, and leans in for a kiss.
Castiel is happy. Dean is safe. Not in his arms. But close enough.
Castiel blinks several times until his eyes can properly see what's in front of him. It's a shed, maybe more robust than it looks in the moonlight. It is surrounded by bushes, a few raised beds and vegetable patches.
"I bought everything for turkey with rice and gravy. Benny gave me the recipe."
"Are you sure that we shouldn't put more lights up?" Castiel asks with a straight voice while struggling with a chuckle that wants to work its way up from his stomach.
much.
Castiel waves him off. "It's nothing." He nods in Jody's direction and leads him to his office. "Coffee or tea?" he asks when he closes the door behind them.
He breathes a sigh of relief and motions her in, quickly pulling a pair of jeans over his boxers. Missouri scans the room and nods satisfied.
Dean shakes his head. "No, we're going to be fine. But the therapist got some stones rolling, and there is so much shit that Cass doesn't know about me. I had to sort through it on my own."
He bends it so that it is plane again, and presses it under the pictures of him and his mum, a snapshot of him, Sam, Eileen, and Castiel. Next to the picture of him with Lisa and Ben, and the drawing of that little girl who drew him with a cowboy hat. He looks at the fridge door and nods. This is him.
Dean. His best friend since college. Castiel was his best man at his impromptu wedding. Dean is the love of his life. But Dean doesn't know. Can't know. And that's fine. There is no place Castiel would rather be than at Dean's side. It's enough for him to see his best friend happy, thriving.
Castiel shrugs. "I lived on the street. I'm a reformed alcoholic. I wouldn't date myself either."
Castiel hums and kisses a trail over the cut of Dean's jaw. "You look hot in a suit," he states.
Dean shrugs his shoulders. "With your religious upbringing and all the no-sex-before-marriage stuff, I took a wild guess. It wasn't worth risking our friendship."
It happens, now and then. It worked for several months with Lisa and Cassie. Not every time, but often enough to act as if he were a normal man with a normal libido and a normal sex drive.
Gabriel grins. As he makes a circle with his left fingers and enters it repeatedly with his right forefinger to illustrate his point, he corrects him. “Lewd, Cassie. The lewd version.”
"I'm fine. How can I help you, Dean?"
When Sam looks out the window, they're long past the sign to Tulsa.
A hand clasps on his shoulder. Dean barely reacts to it, the warmth of the familiar palm steadying him in place more than he’s ready to admit he needs.
Cas tilts his head, finally laying his index and middle finger on her temple, and grunts affirmatively.
He looks sad as he steps away, as if it’s physically painful for him to do so. His hand, which somehow sometime had started clutching Dean’s hand within an inch of his life, recoils as well.
“Dean,” he repeats, “are you okay?”
"Jerk." He mutters.
“I wouldn’t be so sure of that,” Gabriel retorts as he eyes the way Dean’s water-soaked clothes cling to him.
he’s reacting like
His palms are sweating.
When Dean doesn't immediately continue, Cas looks at him and softly smiles. "Yes, Dean?"
If they weren’t in such a public space, he would break something. The chair, the table,
Dean whimpers and swallows, ignoring the dryness in his throat as he forces himself to speak.
Dean clears his throat uncomfortably and turns his gaze back to Sam before staring at the road intensely, his eyes not taking anything in. They're the only drivers there anyways.
even though they feel so
and Cas. Cas, how can you not see how fucked up I am?"
Suddenly, Jo jerks forward, like a kid coughing and gulping air after being underwater for too long. Dean stays back, knowing how hard it can be to breathe even without being overcrowded when coming back alive.
"It doesn't matter," he mutters.
Cas hesitated. "Are you sure?"
Sam's face softens and hardens intermittently until Dean starts to sway with impatience.
He rushes to the room Sam's in quickly and swings the door open.
"Maybe, maybe we should wait. Until you- Until you're okay."
After he's seen the digital clock change numbers seven times Dean starts to doubt himself. He's lasted for so long, he prides himself in being able to curb his needs and pretend to be fine with as little as he can get. It shouldn't be hard for him to not do this.
Dean smiles and shuts his eyes closed.
And when the bottle stops on Sam at the party and with the extra-Punch of the truth serum they're all under says to Dean "
Sam nods, yawning himself. "Yeah, it's pretty late. I'm gonna scour once more the news in case there's a case nearby." He turns towards Jack. "You should get some rest too. School starts at eight, so you better start getting used to waking so early."
He lifts his hand to waiver the waiter from before over. They, who had been watching curiously, obey quickly.
“It’s okay,” he whispers.
"Right, Sammy, how had I forgotten. You party animal. Bet you came to parties all the time in Stamford. Bet you know the best spots and chicks to—" Dean says with obscene hand gestures.
He's in the back sit of Baby, and where a drowsy chick barely covered is expected to be laying, is Cas draped around him.
“What-,” Dean sputters. The doorway is nowhere to be found anymore. “What the hell is going on?”
Fifty-seven. The moment he hits fifty-seven, he feels his stomach quiver and a loud growl go through him.
Behind him Sam fumbles with his phone as Dean recoils in disgust, a mocking laugh stuck in his throat.
"He said he was glad I'm still alive."
They've been having a really tame week. There have been no cases so far. In fact, there have been so little cases in the last few months that Jack's finally enrolling in the local high school. Sam's been busy trying to teach Jack basic math and science and poetry and everything a middle schooler should know before graduating and heading to high school.
“You wish”, he barks. “What’s-”
He's finally dozing off when Cas speaks again.
They go somewhere in Atlanta, and while Sam investigates the details, Dean decides he should catch up with some sleep.
A bottle of the cheapest Whiskey in the supermarket is soon on the table, Dean grimacing at the choice.
"It's-" Dean started. He throws to remember and think, but he couldn't think of the old Captain mentioning it. "That bastard," he said, Sam tutting and trying to cover Ash's ears at the word. It was too late, though, and Ash was already muttering it over and over under his breath. "Bastard, bastard, bastard."
Dean barrels towards him as a bull towards a red flag, pressing his dagger against Gabe’s throat menacingly. The door slams loudly behind them, but he doesn’t spare it a glance.
"Would you care for a night cap?" He asks.
His hearts starts to pound against his ribcage as he tries to recall the familiar clean up routine he performed the previous night.
The day went by, and, at the end of it, he decided not to go back to land. There was nothing waiting for him there, after all.
By the time Dean completely slips out of unconsciousness he's already heard Sam shuffling around for a while.
“Of course,” Cas assures.
“Hello, Dean,” he hears the angel say, and he sounds so
Around him, there are screams, and the sound of fighting, and now that he notices it, he can’t feel Jo at his back anymore. Instead, he only feels the cold of the floor and some stickiness he definitely doesn’t want to think about.
Cas was about to offer to take the couch, when Dean stopped him.
"There's nothing here." Cas mutters under his breath, almost as if afraid of breathing the words out.
Sam’s bitchy expression identifies as he gets a grip on his phone and swipes right. Unbeknownst to Sam Dean catches the blush Sam tries to hide by acting as nonchalantly as possible on the mirror before whatever the caller says swipes it off his face.
One day, though, the inevitable came. It didn't happen after a storm, or because of an accident or anything else.
blush
He surveys the room for any stray items that could enlighten them of what Jo's gotten into one last time while Sam packs up. By the time he's done, Sam's already strolling back to the car.
It’s not long before Dean calls them for dinner. When they see each other, Cas finds himself breathing with much more ease. Dean seems much more relaxed than earlier; the effects of Gabriel’s paradise finally sinking in and the aftereffects of the rejection and their conversation fading away.
It hurts and he doesn't even getting. He's been sweating and shivering for a while and he can't figure out how both reactions are happening at the same time.
be in, but they pick the lock this time.
because what- something caught your attention?”
Dean frowns. "Wha- What had Dad anything to do with this? He- He wasn't- He
," Starts Sammy with a patronizing voice, "you woke me up with your drunk retching a few hours ago. I know you haven't slept and you're probably extremely hangover. Are you sure you're okay to drive?"
When they're finally done, full and tired of such a satiating meal, Dean taps Cas's thigh under the table.
Dean’s periphery vision is finally catching on to him and as Dean moves around he can see more and more people looking at Cas curiously, pointing and talking in hushed voices. Suddenly, Dean feels cold. Cold and embarrassed and an alarm that sounds too much like his dad’s blaring in his brain screaming
“Ellen?” Sam growls. “I- I can’t hear you. Wait a second.” He looks at Dean hesitatingly, but Dean’s already nodding, so he nods back and leaves the room in search of better reception.
'Just
Dean stood up as well, his feet hitting the gravel with more strength then yesterday.
"Where?"
“What can I get you, Sir?” They ask, not even trying to hide their amusement.
Dean laughs self-deprecatingly and shakes his head.
Sam grimaces harder. “Take all the time you need,” he scoffs as he leaves. “You’re disgusting.”
, and the repression and everything he can't convey about secretly
“Fine.”
“Noted.” Cas smiles. He pauses and then adds, innocently: “You’ll be my first-choice next time massaging is involved.”
is what he meant, that he's lucky hunting hasn't ended him.
The Captain only hummed.
"Dean," he says. Neither of them are looking at each other. "I- What do you want me to say?" He asks, angrily and tiredly at the same time. It takes them both by surprise, their eyes looking for each other in shock.
It could just be that the bunker's working so perfectly it doesn't creak or squeak every few seconds, the thick walls are doing a great job of keeping the bunker isolated from any ruckus on the outside and Sam's busy somewhere the noise can't travel to Dean's whereabouts.
The Captain had patted Dean's back afterwards and they had gone inside.
Dean had wondered, why wait for death there, and not at sea, where he always seemed so happy and
He travelled, but never sat foot on land.
Sammy's rhythmic breathing annoys him like an unrelenting fly, because how is it fair that he gets to sleep when Dean's the one who's exhausted?
(See the end of the chapter for
After a few heavy seconds of Cas’s heavy stare on him, Dean opens his eyes and fights a smile. He sways lightly, then leans more heavily on Cas.
Dean starts to fidget nervously. Consequently, Cas turns to Dean completely and stares into his eyes.
Regardless of this being Cas's turn of doing the dishes, he ends up drying them. Dean  washes them, flannel tucked above his elbows, soap slipping through his fingers carelessly, and Cas dries them, leaving them smooth and warm in the rack besides the sink.
“How am I supposed to think if you won’t shut your cakehole,
He doesn’t even know anymore if he’s pissed at Cas for
Take care :)
As scenarios of what could have happened or could be happening to Jo start to take form behind his eyelids, his blood starts to boil and his pulse to quicken in fear, irritation and anger.
"Can we be partners?"
Cas makes as if to talk again, but Dean fake-yawns loudly to avoid it.
Dean sighs defeatingly and grunts as he turns, giving Cas more room to lay besides him.
There's rice and some kind of fish, which is making Dean scrunch his expression in disgust and glare at Sam murderously.
I really hope I didn't mess the Supernatural lore up. It's the first time I write a case fic and I didn't really know how to turn things around, but I did my best so it's okay with me.
When Gabriel smirks obscenely and starts saying something more to it, Cas adds. “Jack doesn’t need to accidentally be exposed to that kind of thing. Or do you want to be responsible for that?”
A cardiovascular condition, a tumor,
Jack shakes his head, so, Sam just goes on his way. Dean smirks, trying to capture Cas's eyes to share some complicity. Cas keeps eating, though he does look up fondly when he thinks Dean isn't looking anymore. He is.
And then they had continued to sit outside and watch the stars, and the sky and the ever-ending sea. The Captain hadn't asked again, well-versed in pasts that bit and stabbed back if they were brought up against one's will.
When he finally focuses the sight of Jo, sprawled on the floor, pale and unmoving, the urgency of the situation dawns upon him and he has to suck in a breath. He closes his eyes and grunts, volume barely above a whisper, as if not daring to disturb Jo’s righteous silence.
Cas's already halfway outside the door before he thinks of something.
"Ah, that's why we're eating it. You just wanted to take care of your girly needs. I knew there would be a day in which you would be your hair before us." Dean spits with sarcasm.
As the culprit goes on and on Dean involuntarily face palms, laughter dying in his throat.
“Cas,” Dean rebuffs, “you know I don’t play for that team.”
"How are you?"
So here's what to expect: next chapter will be Sam's POV of this chapter (so everything's cleared up) and then there will be one more chapter with the aftermath of everything that happened here.
He punches Cas’s arm softly and smiles coyly. “Okay,” he says. "Thanks."
He gasps and automatically flinches away from it, ignoring the urge to lean into it to soak as much comfort as a simple touch can give.
“Dean,” Cas voices. Dean berates himself when his feet falter in response.  “We didn’t mean to hu-”
But Sam deals with that too, so the undertone of constant surprise in the sentence still makes him wonder.
They stayed for dinner, when they met a very pregnant Eileen awaiting a second child.
Before long, he feels warm. He momentarily fights with himself to wake up, to be useful, but he’s just
Cas lifts an eyebrow playfully. “Well, I’ll help you however you want me, Dean.”
Without the Captain working as a distraction, he found himself missing Sam more and more. The thought of coming back didn't really settle in his mind, however. Not as a plan. Not, until, one night.
"Dean," he says, startling him. "Have you- don't kill me- have you thought about therapy?"
Dean turns to his side and closes his eyes.
He can get a black coffee for himself and say he ate while he waited, avoiding the matter concerning him since Sam  mentioned the coffee.
By the time Dean finally says something, Cas thought it would never happen.
Dean looks like Cas just punched him. "What?"
It all comes to halt on a Thursday.
Dean sighs. He’s so tired. He hasn’t been sleeping well- But, well. Since when does he allow himself the luxury of a peaceful night sleep? He rubs his face, then checks the clock. To be honest, he’s getting worried. What if something’s happened? Cas can defend himself. But what if he was taken by surprise? What if there was an unfair fight and Dean didn’t even try to help him?
"Sure." Dean complies, looking anywhere other than Sam. Then he adds, muttering, "
"Cas? 's everything alright?"
"It's not like that," Dean protested, blush high in his cheeks. "I like girls."
When the Captain yawned for the fourth time and deemed it time to go to sleep, he stood up and squeezed Dean's shoulder lightly. He hadn't stepped away yet when Dean started talking.
But then he thinks of Famine, the horseman, and how he was right when he told him he was empty inside. He remembers how he didn't really lied to Cas when he told him he was well-fed, because he gets what he wants when he wants it so he survives. Right now is proof of it. He remembers how Famine wondered why he didn't cave, and he knows,
The walk back to the room is a blur. He's in the diner and then he's in the bathroom and he really hopes Sam hasn't waken up because he doesn't know how much noise he's made in his way back.
He’s been having the shittiest week. Mom’s gone on her own, updating now and then but being annoyingly absent. Like she doesn’t care, like she birthed them so long ago that because she didn’t see them grow up, they aren’t even her children.
Sam opens the door carefully from behind the door handle, gun aimed at whatever could come out of it. Dean imitates him from the other side of the door.
“What’s taking you so long?” Sam asks, voice irritated and expression as bitchy as concerned.
The next thing he knows he's soaked through, he's got sand in his underwear and some very blue, very confused eyes are staring right through him.
He walks non-chalantly over the front of the diner pretending to be just another passer-by while he discreetly tries to survey the diner for a red head.
Dean feels helpless as they don't find anything they could go on.
. He knows he'll never get what he needs because it isn't something he can't just get.
Okay. So, I did my best. I'm sleep deprived and kind of terrified of writing a story with multiple chapters, but I did my best. So I hope it isn't too disappointing.
The Captain heartily laughed at that. "I'm glad, kid. I like you too."
And that's enough for now.
"I saw Jo in the outside of the motel." Sam lifts his brows expectantly as Dean muses over how to express himself and Dean rushes to keep explaining his point. "She didn't seem like herself, nor a shapeshifter. She was too fast and too... Unreal to be human, and she couldn't be a shapeshifter. She was carrying metal. And why would no one have seen her if she stayed? Why would she have come back to the hotel? It just doesn't add up."
Sam, curious, but not pushing, had accepted and brought a book himself in case Dean needed to sort out his thoughts. Dean is thoroughly taking advantage of that.
“Nothing,” Dean answers swiftly. He puts on the patented charming blinding panty-dropping smile he usually uses on cases or to get laid, and Cas sucks in a breath. Unfortunately for Dean, Cas knows better than that by now.
He closes his eyes and imitates Cas's breathing patters, focusing on Cas's warmth and touch instead of his own jittery, painful heartbeat.
Cas squints. As he opens his mouth to answer the wind surges, a raft of air throwing sand all over him, unpleasantly getting into his mouth, eyes and ears and effectively drowning whatever he was going to say.
Dean nods, but doesn't move. He waits a few more seconds before nodding to himself. "Can I give you a hand?"
magic fingers are. Everyone could use a massage once in a while. It’s not like braiding each other’s hair or bubble baths or whatever.” He adds nonchalantly.
Jack hadn't bothered to bring back most supernatural creatures, especially not any of those who weren't capable of any good to begin with or, like most ghost, didn't really belong in their realm any more.
"What about it?
But Cas looks so expectant, Dean just can’t. “I wouldn’t mind if- if it happens again.” He stutters. His mind roars into life again, disapproving, and approving thoughts fighting each other. Dean ignores him the best he can.
“I thought leviathans or Michael or Chuck or
"I know where Jo is, or, at least, where she went after staying here."
as they waltz around before preparing themselves to ask Dean
" when asked to tell Dean his foremost hidden truth, Dean, focused on stopping the witch that's messing up with the faculty, shrugs it off without thinking twice.
Cas takes a step back and stands up. Dean still hasn't opened his eyes. Cas throws his head back and swallows the rest of his drink hastily.
"Whatever."
Dean shivers.
“You dropped something,” the waiter says, before leaving whatever he’s found on the table.
Cas whimpers, desperately wanting for his, well, his
The game continues and between the laughs and kisses and cries it doesn't come up. When the answers start to turn into fights, well, it just doesn't matter.
I'm thinking about adding a chapter with Jo and maybe part of the case? before doing the one with Cas, but I'm not sure. Would you like that?
Dean shakes his head again. "Heal me," he whispers.
"Cas," he growls urgently, "what's going on?"
we can't," he announces.
Still, the feeling's grown over time and now everything hurts. He knows he won't be able to sustain another sleepless night.
Jack is… Well, he’s still on the fence about the kid. He’s good and bad, and has such a great potential to go either way Dean feels like he’s never going to stop being on edge around him.
Before they let go of each other, Dean complains weakly. “Cas, I was
Sometime along the way he finds himself over the toilet, fingers playing inside his mouth, over his tongue and onto his throat, bile and vanilla and chunks of whatever he's swallowed clogging the toilet and stinking up the bathroom, swallowing up all the clean air available in the crammed too.
“Gabriel,” Cas interrupts, “that’s enough”.
I'm not too satisfied with this chapter myself but I don't dislike it either. I hope I didn't romanticized eating disorders and that it actually made sense.
Thanks for reading.
The moment fleets away, though, as Cas’s hot breath on the juncture of his neck and his shoulder —and when were his shirts opened and tucked away?— turns harder and
(See the end of the chapter for
So, he looks around the room and when everything seems to be in order, not a crumb left, he goes outside and stick the vegan cookie in his coat. He may have to use it later if Sam finds out why he left the room that night.
When Sam opens his mouth, probably to point out the sexism in the sentence and to argue his way to the last radio station, Dean growls at him again.
He knows he's still wavering around his
"I actually don't know
Cas frowns. "I have enough of my own."
Despite the direness of the circumstances, Dean can’t help but throw his head back in a laughing fit.
. He knows it's because he's used to it.
but he isn’t comfortable with himself and he knows he’s pushed himself hard enough for one day. “A beer,” he says. “And a double of whiskey,” he adds. He feels like he deserve it.
It's clear to him Dean doesn't want to leave just yet. Looking around, he nods to himself.
One thing is evident; no one has set foot in there in days.
. Maybe he notices his will to die more often than not, but knows the burden of his obligations that impede him to do so.
Jo doesn’t answer directly, but she bumps her head against his, which immediately flares up the pain already there, making him stifle a pained groan because it would be unwise to throw away his only advantage, the surprise of his own consciousness, by alerting them of his wakefulness.
But the meal is ending, only a swig of beer left on Sam's part, and Dean still hasn't been able to voice the question.
Cas frees himself as Dean just stares, both surprised and grateful and a teensy bit disappointed.
Dean sinks into his chair. Cas sips on his drink while Dean gathers his thoughts. He's pondering leaving, pretty sure the conversation is over, when Dean inhales sharply.
When her eyes widen slightly before she schools her expression, he adds "To go, please. Can't leave my brother waiting" and winks at her.
"I just- Dean, really, it doesn't matter."
Sam and Eileen offered them to stay the night. They did. They were offered a couch and the bed in the guest room.
"There were only twenty minutes left, right?"
"Ah, but it is," the Captain retorted. "I'm old, Dean, you can't lie to me. I'd recognize that look in your eyes anywhere. I've seen it before, many, many times. I've
"You can make one up, then," suggested Cas brightly.
When Dean finally comes to, everything’s dark. A sliver of moonlight comes through the window, barely allowing him to see the floor beneath him. An ominous feeling settles in his gut as he thinks but is unable to remember how he got there. For a moment he wonders if his predicament is of his own doing, if his body has finally rebelled to Dean’s relentless abuse of it. His head’s pounding like crazy, almost as if he hadn’t eaten in a while and
When everyone started to fill the streets, Dean took Baby and drove.

This time Castiel is late. Dean doesn’t think anything about it, how could he? It’s summer and it’s Thursday and
Dean's hands shake slightly as he hides them in his pockets. He frowns. The cookie's still in there.
“Oh, I missed you too, Dean-O,” Gabe mocks him.
The waiter turns away, kind of irritated but so sympathetic with their pitying face Dean can almost hear them thinking
He’s pondering on it and on his next move when movement behind him catches his attention.
“You don’t mean that.” Dean mutters. “But-”
Dean moans. He doesn’t mean to. He’s just feeling and thinking and suddenly this
He shivers. He's
“Dean,” he inquires solemnly, “would you care to join us?”
He stands up again and opens the window.
Please, take care of yourselves, and, until next chapter~
“You know, I’ve also said many times how freaking
One day he's driving with Cas, on their own, while Sam works on tying the last loose ends of their most recent case.
He isn't excited, restless nor anxious. There's nothing really going on, nothing occupying his mind.
Cas takes a deep breath, then another. “I’m sorry. That wasn’t my intention- I didn’t mean to bring him up. But
He feels like the air is giving him another chance, telling him to go back, that
, he really-”
One morning Dean came to pick up the Captain, but the Captain coughed and told him to not count him in.
Gabe stalks over him and slaps his arm, winking as he mock-deflates, “I’m more interested in Pantene-hair over there anyways. You’re no fun. Maybe if you got that stick out of your ass-“
And so, driving Baby with the Capt-
"Um- yeah, that one."
It's cold, but the smell will fade.
As soon as he hears Sam leave, he lets his thoughts wander, briefly losing his composure at eating anything else right now, as Sam will expect him to eat breakfast with their coffee.
Cas falls asleep not long after.
Dean washes the last glass for an ungodly amount of time before Cas puts his hands on Dean's.
After Dean throws him a confused look, Cas gestures towards his burger. In that instance, Sam steps in with a smile.
"Let's share the bed," he proposed.
Baby run down, Dean hid her in a garage and compromised to help the Captain out. And so, he learned to fish beyond the basics his dad had taught him, and he learnt to sail, and to appreciate the wind and water and moon cycle, and to be as one with the sea as he was with the thrill of the hunt.
Either these shapeshifters are extremely fast and immune to metal, Jo's died and turned into a ghost —thought he immediately crushes as he can't even fathom it— or they aren't dealing with what they thought they were dealing with.
"I mean love partners, lovers," he said, grimacing at the word, "more than friends."
"Um-"
Cas tilts his head in expectation.
changed and would never be the same, the first thing he did was check on Baby.
Anyways, I swear I'll do my best to have the next chapter published before this week ends.
Sam looks about done. He rolls his eyes as if thinking something along the lines of '
"Yeah, so?"
Just now he notices what he had mistaken as a wall is no other than the flesh of another human. Guiltily, he tries to take on his own weight, to stop leaning on his companion, but his body doesn’t cooperate.
"Enough, boy," he intervened gruffly when Dean showed up. "You, following me around, it's making me sad. Kid, you're scaring Death away. It's okay. I've lived, I'm done."
Nevertheless, even surprising himself, Cas just sighs. He rubs his tired. He
He shakes his head and takes a quick chowder, not allowing himself to relish the warm water more than necessary, unwilling to think his way into another mental turmoil.
Despite the slight blush coloring his cheeks Cas stands up, unimpressed. “I’d rather check on Jack. He could surely use another pair of extra hands for his fortress.”
He stands up and slams his fists on the table. He’s clenching his jaw so hard he feels his teeth are going to break and his face is going to dislocate but he can’t focus on that. “I waited for you over an hour,” he hisses. “You just left me here like
, falls away.
Dean shakes his head, fists tight against his sides. “Don’t you dare talk about my father. You don’t know
However, the following thump of the impact of Cas’s body against the bathroom tiles startles Dean out of place. He rushes forwards, a protest stuck in his throat as the world wobbles around him because of the sudden change of pace, and kneels before Cas, arms carefully cradling his head and shoulders to search for any clue on how badly helping Jo has hurt him.
He took his daily dose of whiskey and spilled some for the Captain to the water bellow before going to sleep.
"Okay."
Cas turns towards him quicker than a lighting bolt and squints.
"Oakhurst, Oklahoma."
. He's craving something so badly his hands are twitching and his mind's fallen into a loop of beer and meat and salty fries and soft vanilla milkshakes.
Dean nods to himself, deep in thought. Slowly, he lets his lips turn into a small smile.
"Dean," Cas answered, leaning in and pressing their lips together, "I'd love to."
day with those he gave Heaven up for.
Cas smiles and shuffles closer to Dean, pretending to lock his mouth close and throwing the key away.
When Dean tied the ship the next evening to its post and went in for the glass of whiskey and the accompanying story, the Captain had already passed.
With Cas's silent support, Dean approached Sam and the kid,
"Yeah?"
"You still deserve love." Cas whispers.
When Cas slowly lays his hand on Dean’s shoulder again, Dean just slumps into his seat. He’s just so
and Dean gets even more nervous.
They had rested against the boat, and the Captain had caressed its wood with such gentleness Dean felt a pang of pain for different times.
“Dean,” Cas repeats gently. “I’m here.
Dean's already turning around when he hears the door squeaking open, almost silently, and something cold fall over him.
" He repeats.
This time, Sam doesn't even bother to answer him. He stands up and smiles at Jack. "I'm gonna get another beer, want anything?"
His minds tugs at him to recognize that that back can only belong to Cas, that he summoned him and hurt him, that
"Did you know a lot of mental illnesses manifest through physical pain?"
The food is... Alright. Cas is still at least half angel, and so, he doesn't really need to eat nor is able to appreciate food as he now knows humans are able to. He still eats it, though. It makes whoever cooks happy.
It doesn't take him long to fall asleep.
Dean finishes, and looks up at Sam expectantly.
"'m not a nutjob or a chick," Dean slurrs defensively.
As he notices that it's Celine Dion and not one of the Classics that's blaring through the radio he hastily changes the music station. Dean growls at Sam's aborted move to change it back.
Cas's summoned and Jo's healed, but everything may not be as peachy after all. They've followed Jo there, but Jo was there for a reason that might just bite them in the ass.
Dean blinks a few times before the shock wears off and, even then, he still feels like he has somehow fallen asleep and is either in a really confusing dream or has woken up somehow in a completely different universe -which at this point wouldn't even surprise him.
“Dean,” the deep, expected voice stated. “I’m here.”
Relief floods Dean as Sam's just given him the perfect excuse for everything he might ask except the well-hidden wrappers and crumbs laying at the bottom of the bathroom's trash can.
As he looks around frantically, he starts remembering everything that happened to this moment, guilt building steadily as he becomes conscious of all the mistakes
Sam and Dean get to the motel where Jo was staying in. There's a significant change in the case and, after a short drive, they find what they were looking for.
The thing about
"Welcome to Eli's Diner. What can I getcha?" She smiles.
He turns again, bed creaking dangerously and he sighs. He's so tired. He lets his eyes close, breathes deeply and starts to count; this should do the trick.
“Dean,” he mutters, “what-”
"No!" Dean growled, doubt in his posture immediately after. "I mean, I didn't- I thought-"
"Sammy, we're in a
It takes him four times to unlock his phone, but when he does, he isn't surprised with Dean's name on the screen.
Dean was really nervous the night he got to Sam's.
While Dean looks around one more time, Sam sets his stuff on the bed to go over the case and hack the motel's cameras. Dean's sent away to talk to the other residents and motel crew.
"The other day, um, he said something and I don't really know what he meant by it."
If, past the ten years mark, someone hasn't taken a step towards a relationship, the likelihood it will happen is as good as being struck by lighting. Hell, being struck by lighting might even be more likely than Dean acknowledging his feelings to someone who isn't Sam.
"Pardon me?"
"I can feel it," the Captain had said, in his rough, wise, exhausted voice. "Death's got me at it's grips."
"Yeah."
These conclusions, which after each second seem increasingly likely, aren't really drawn of the existence of wherever he is right now, or from the fact that everyone's apparently disappeared and now he's soaked through inside the bunker.
Gabriel smirks, “Oh my, I didn’t know you missed me that much, sweet cheeks.” He sticks his tongue out and Dean recedes in disgust.
He checks the room and packs the few stray items laid around before rushing out.
Rendering his body as useless he opens his mouth to alert Sam of the danger he’s in. His mouth feels pasty and gross, his tongue dry and uncomfortable. Somehow, he manages to focus on talking, and despite all the pain that threatens to take his down, he manages to vociferate something. “Sammy,” he says, the overwhelming sensations threatening his body to fail. “Behind you.”
"When we get our own house," he said, "I'm putting glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of our bedroom."
Absently, Dean nods.
“I bet I can get more crabs than you.”
"Dean."
"Uh, what are you doing?" Dean bellows.
A thump in front of him tires him away from his musings. When he sees the bag of food, he smiles.
Whereas Dean finally sinks into the hug, a soft dry chuckle punched out of him, Cas repositions himself for a better hold, and, when he does, he freezes in place.
When Sam sees Dean walking over, his face twists into one of his bitch faces and he prepares himself to fights Dean over being the driver.
Dean feels his mind slipping away from the task constantly as he walks around. He hasn't bumped into anyone he could interrogate yet.
Cas's heart breaks. He wishes his grace could heal him.
During the next who-knows-how-much-time his consciousness fades in and out. One time he feels someone touching his forehead. Another one he’s overwhelmed by the familiar smell and rumble of the Impala. Some time after, his head is tipped up and coldness washes the dryness away. He thinks he hears Ellen, or maybe it’s his mom?
Dean exhales heavily at the statement.
He isn't hungry, he's downright
When his internal clock woke him up before dawn he took everything edible he could find, including the remaining whiskey, and parted to sea.
He tries pushing it as hard as he can, but it doesn't budge. The bullets he shoots towards it don't make a dent and any sigils he could think of from Rowena's magic book don't work.
This time, though, with nothing prompting it, no grief or tragedy acting as fuel, he's as fragile and useless as a child in the war.
Dean can’t help but think he’s either had a really good fuck or alcohol is finally making a dent on his supernatural tolerance.
' he thinks to himself.
The top floor of the bunker is empty, only sand thrown in bouts aimlessly disturbing its normalcy. Well, sand and Sam's absence. But he could be on a grocery run or deep in the bowels of the bunker scouting for books and the Men of Letters' weirdest artifacts.
The waiter smiles. “Coming right up.”
His eyes open against his will and
“Hah!” Dean snorts, coming back to life. “It’s on.”
“Cassiiee,” someone whines in the back, “what’s the hold up? You jacking off to the sight of the bunker or something? Not to kink-shame, but-“
"I'm not so sure we're dealing with shapeshifters here." He announces.
and exhales loudly before straightening in his seat and staring tiredly back at his brother.
Although Cas’s eyes widen and his breath momentarily catches as he slumps back, his hand doesn’t leave Dean’s back.
lucky, fitful sleep.
Dean tries to think of Cas, tries to talk to him, summon him.
"Can you...?"
I really can't work this out for you."
“Do you want to go to Pride with me?” Cas asks calmly. Dean wonders at how effortlessly he says it, as if it’s not a big deal, as if it’s not
The only quirk of it, of the unprecedented hurt radiating from where he's heart should be, is that it's so ever-consuming that it empties every unpleasant thought his mind can come up to.
Despite the lack of sleep making his eyes feel like they're burning as if he were about to cry and his throat stinging every time he swallows due to the night before's activities, he hasn't felt so peaceful in a while.
I really hope you liked it.
Dean turned around slowly, blinking and pinching his own skin a couple times to make sure this wasn't just a sea-drunk dream. The owlish eyes of an angel that was leaning his arms against the open windowsill of his car were already staring
“Butts involved or not. Whatever you need. Gabriel wasn’t wrong before, you know. About me, not-”
After Dean talks Cas's frown unfurrows and his stance relaxes, although his head remains tilted to the right.
A flourish of emotions passes through him as he stays still, afraid even to twitch slightly. Lust, fear, love, anger, gratefulness, sadness— for a moment he wishes Charlie were here, because he
“Cas, wait!” He hears himself say, although he doesn’t recollect thinking it. “I-” He thinks of taking it back, of telling him to move on, that it was
Dean follows him hurriedly, and, as soon as the car's in motion, he looks at Sam sideways before focusing on the road ahead.
Cas moves forward and hugs Dean.
Dean tries to get up, to look for his gun and take the person behind Sam out. Nevertheless, every muscle and bone in his body feel as if a thousand needles were attacking him, and just getting into a sitting position feels like climbing up a volcano covered in lava.
"Can you...?", He asks. "Check for hex bags under the bed and in the closet and in the minifridge. Maybe- Maybe around the bunker, just in case."
