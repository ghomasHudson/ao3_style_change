No one has ever asked Dean about as much as directions and he kind of likes it that way. He has cultivated his “I’m-not-helpful-and-very-dangerous” expression for too many years to have it go to waste now. Cas tries to mimic the face, complete with the same furrowed brow and the scowl. It only really makes him look lost, or as Dean says, constipated.
Dean thinks that this kind of love he’s in is kind of unbearable. It doesn’t feel like the quick, all-consuming love that he and Cassie had, or the stability of Lisa, or whatever it was that he and Amara shared. It makes all the parts of him cringe and shiver at once.
He looks at his clipboard, fiddling with his pen. He looks like he’s stalling.
The first few conversations after Cas came back were stilted. Cas wouldn’t look at Dean and Dean couldn’t look away from Cas. There was an elephant in the room, and there still is; it just went from actively rampaging to sleeping in the corner, waking up every so often just to check how things are going, and then fall asleep again.
“‘Peacocking’?” Cas says, mystified. “Was the crab dismemberment supposed to do that?”
Dean thinks. He knows no one will hear it. He curls his hands over his thighs and sobs.
His heart, already beating like a mouse cornered, seems to go double time. “Can I come in?”
“Knife time,” Dean chuckles. “Sure. Goodnight, Cas.”
He doubles over in that alleyway and ejects the remainder of his stomach contents onto the concrete. They must not be feeding him very well at HYDRA. There’s nothing but clear bile puddling on the ground next to a candy bar wrapper. He wipes his mouth. He can’t remember the last meal he had.
“That’s not what I - Cas, are we really talking about this in the middle of a Costco? In public?”
Dean is sitting on his bed in his room, sewing up a rip in his Levi’s from being shoved into a wall on a ghost hunt, when there’s a polite knock on the door. His hands still.
“He wants to impress you,” Sam says through a mouth of fries. “He’s peacocking.”
“Run it under some water, Jack,” Cas says. Jack nods and holds his thumb under the water, and they both watch the water slowly go from pink to clear. Truth be told, Cas is going off of what he’s seen Dean and Sam do on a hunt. The vodka sloshed all over the wound is probably not necessary. Unless it
“I know. I want to.”
“You can’t see feelings?” Dean says. Cas shakes his head. Dean leans back into the wood of the gazebo. Cas doesn’t know. It is a brief relief that curdles into pure worry. There’s no way Dean can drum up the courage to tell him, not like this.
Cas breathes in harshly, which causes Dean to put a steady hand on his thigh. That hand is asking,
“Uh,” Castiel hedges. He is wary about these ribs. He fears that he will try the food and he will taste something other than molecules. Maybe he will even enjoy it. That scares him. “Perhaps.”
This is getting childish, Dean thinks. This is baby shit.
It is worth it. He'd eat beans for every meal if it is what it takes.
“Huh.” Well. That could’ve gone worse.
“No way,” Claire says. The small smile on her face has dropped off. Cas’ heart is thundering.
“Tree nuts,” Cas says. It’s t-minus two hours until their guests show, and Dean’s final menu: smashed potatoes roasted in olive oil and garlic salt until crispy, Cobb salad with big chunks of chicken and bacon, jalapeno poppers, corn fritters, the aforementioned short ribs, and beer cheese that Dean is currently grating all the cheese for into one big mixing bowl; is underway.
The “green space” Cas described is a little more than someone’s backyard with a gazebo and some of those little Christmas lights strung around it. There’s a little pond filled with squirming fish, and Cas lets them in with a furtive glance around him, like he’s waiting for the fuzz to show up. It feels like Dean is the good daughter’s bad influence boyfriend, covered in tattoos and smoking cigarettes in his leather jacket, telling her to skip church to listen to his awful punk band.
motion. Claire rolls her eyes and pulls up a seat.
Cas’ good humor evaporates.
Castiel hadn’t been aware that was an option. He shouldn’t, as he feels he is on a tightrope and cannot chance an opportunity to be dragged back down to darkness. But it’s his family. Would they notice if something was wrong? Would he even want them to?
“You know, you’re the only person I’d stay up late making levain flatbreads, you know that? You’re the only person I’ve ever considered not annoying in the kitchen, even though I love Sam and Jack, I can’t focus when they’re there,” Dean says. Cas’ eyes are getting wider and wider. “I prayed for you every single night you were gone. When you died, every time you died, I drank so much I passed out every night for a week. How - how do you not know?”
“Jack,” Cas says as he watches Jack turn toward the door, halting him with a hand. “Is everything okay?”
This ball Cas deems adequate for his purposes, and he hefts with one of his hands. He walks and slings the ball down the aisle, hitting the pins hard and knocking all but the two outermost down. Dean whistles quietly.
Cas realises he’s missed a chunk of conversation as the slight pressure on his back becomes more insistent. Cas nods at Dean, who retracts his hand but leaves his arm warm on the back of Cas’ chair.
“I’ll be there,” Cas says quietly after a minute, like he doesn't want to hurt anybody by saying it. “I promise.”
But the invisible rules: what is okay, what isn’t, what trauma is too big to touch and what boundaries are firm; is ongoing. Dean would like to say he never messes up because, in his mind, he is always right. Cas would like to say he’s doing what is right for both of them, because Dean can’t actually see inside his head. In reality, Cas is putting himself inside Dean’s without knowing. They are two bulls, constantly ready to run as soon as something seems red. Even if it is just the fluttering of a curtain instead of a flag, and the man behind it is the only one to hurt you and get away with it because you love him too much.
The soccer mom is leaning on her cart now, on her phone. God, Dean hopes she’s not hearing this.
Dean and San start asking questions about recovery time, but all Cas can hear is muted mumbles, like he’s underwater. Dean grabs his arm as he does his breathing exercises. Sam hovers over his shoulder, wringing his hands as he looks at where the doctor points to all the weak points of Cas’ skeletal system.
Well, he thinks. He sits down on the empty floor of the barren apartment. He’s still alive. That must mean something. Or just that he hasn’t died yet.
The handlers were convinced that there was nothing human left of him as they watched those tiny arms wiggle on the surgery wing’s grey floor. So they decided to turn him into what they wanted: a robot. A gun.
“You bastard,” Dean says unevenly, and then he leans in.
“Let’s say I know that. But the people who think you did?” Dean inches forward again. The shield is bright and big and all-encompassing and Castiel hates it. “They’re coming here right now, and they’re not going to let you leave this country alive.”
“We literally just passed a spot,” Dean says, pointing it out. “Right there, dude.”
“I just wanted to say it,” Cas says, looking at him and willing him to understand. Dean’s posture relaxes.
“I’ve wanted this since I was ten years old,” Cas croaks, putting his hand up to where Dean’s hand is resting on his cheek.
Claire, Kaia, and Jody come together and are still arguing over the supposedly sunny weather forecast as Jody ushers them through the bunker door. All three of them look like wet cats, shielding metal sheet trays and paper boxes filled with food with their bodies. Sam and Dean grab their hugs quickly and whisk away their wet jackets to the bathroom to dry, and then Cas and Jack are left to their introductions. They make eye contact, trying to figure out who will step forward first.
Dean feels all the muscles in his body tense up.
“Did he say what it was?” Dean says, dipping into the bags to liberate his chicken thighs, bread and butter pickles, and farmer’s sausage from Cas’ chemical-laden cinnamon buns, and shoved them all in the fridge where they could fit.
Ask Dean to paint a portrait of a man in love and he will just tell you to look at his face and you’ll know. And you do.
“Don’t be cruel,” Cas says quietly, inexplicably. He lets himself be swayed though, gently moving his hips in time with Dean’s. Forward and back. Never quite touching.
“Well, settle in, it’ll be a while to Lincoln. Hey,” Dean says. He grabs the bin of tapes from underneath the front seat and shoves it into Cas’ lap. Cas receives it like someone might receive a Van Gogh — handling it like it might break, utterly confused why it was given to him in the first place. “Pick one.”
The asset feels himself breathing too quickly, his heartbeat rocketing in his head. It is almost novel, after years of being shocked into cold passivity. He closes his eyes and breathes and thinks,
in perfect accentless French, and then he doesn’t resurface until he’s in a mysterious apartment, the keys still hanging from his fingers.
Cas is in a glass cube.
“It’s delicious, Dean,” Cas says, eyes soft. He leans back to look up at Dean more directly. Their faces get within proximity to each other, a breath away. “Everything is delicious.”
“Are you alright?” Castiel asks. “You’re not usually awake at this hour.”
, Castiel thinks. He says this thought out loud to Dean, who is sitting in the hospital chair next to the gurney he’s been strapped to. He is hoping it would make Dean smile. Sam is lingering near the front door, obviously caught between comforting the doctor and comforting Cas.
It’s all very cute, but this cream cheese isn’t going to soften itself.
Uh oh. Castiel plasters on a different uneasy smile to see Dean coming down the aisle with a full cart, looking surprised at Castiel’s presence at the grocery store. A very valid reaction, as Castiel told him he was going to be in the Himalayas this week to look for clues towards defeating Chuck.
“Well, you know. Heh. He’s. Alright,” Dean says. “I’m not talking about this with you.”
“A month ago, I told Dean I loved him romantically.” Cas clarifies, finding his voice finally. “It was in the meat section of Costco. He reciprocated.”
“If I find you in the kitchen at 4AM again, I’ll strangle you,” Dean mumbles. He leans back, dropping his arms around Castiel’s naked waist. His arms feel warm enough to brand Castiel's skin. He guesses it would be payback of a sort. “You know, it all kinda made sense after you left. I thought you were just being weird and sneaky.”
He thuds his head back against his restraints and watches as Dean leaves, flanked by other SHIELD agents like bugs on a flower as they undoubtedly discuss his fate. At least he’s not wearing the uniform anymore.
They had been very close, and Cas’ fingers had been hooked in the elastic waistband of Dean’s basketball shorts, and Dean had been kissing him slowly. Dean’s hands were on both sides of Cas’ head, holding him steady, like he was something breakable.
from Dean is enough to make Cas feel like he could rip his own heart out and eat it. “I gotcha.”
“Our lives are rarely that,” Cas says. He starts raising his hand but pulls away at the last second, tucking it in his lap gently. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Castiel always thought that Dean’s low, gruff voice was because of those scars, but maybe not. Maybe this was who he always was.
Dean thinks a couple hours later. His phone has been ringing nonstop, but he cannot pick it up and answer it. That would be admitting something.
“It’s useful, okay?” Sam says defensively, holding his bag containing the iPad to his chest. “Charlie rigged it up for me. Imagine all the books I can-,”
“Dean?” Cas says cautiously. Dean had sagged into Cas’ hands without realizing it. Dean straightens up and Cas keeps rearranging his limbs to where they’re supposed to go and winds Dean’s arm back for his turn.
They roll up to the bowling alley about an hour later, Baby’s tires crunching through the gravel of the mostly empty parking lot.
“Dean, I can’t—,” Cas starts. Dean looks at him like
Jesus, Dean really
“They should,” Dean says. “You’re.” He stops there, unable to say more. His tongue is thick in his mouth.
everything’s fine, Castiel,” Jack says. He is pouting. “I just remember a time I could’ve healed it as soon as it happened.” He flexes his hand again, causing blood to rush to the surface and pool in red drops. Cas hands him a clean hand towel and Jack dries the cut, frowning.
“Know what?” Dean says. “Know you’re an angel?”
Dean looks away from where Cas is sucking the juices out of a crab leg and focuses solely on him for the first time since he came in. He puffs out his chest a little bit. “You like it? Got the recipe from the Internet.”
Dean does think about other things other than wooing Cas, by the way. He thinks about Sam and Eileen moving out of the bunker, and he thinks about Cas and Jack moving out of the bunker, and he thinks about the wild rabbits that live around the area that Miracle loves to chase. He thinks about Donna and Jody and the trip to Miami they went on after they were resurrected, and the pictures they text him with their giant cocktails. He thinks about Claire and vows to invite her over soon so he can make short ribs for her that she likes.
Cas’ eyes are very, very blue, and very, very pained. They are swaying back and forth into each other, like some orchestra is playing somewhere and their dance card is up.
Dean doesn’t reach for the ignition. He waits for Cas to look at him, which he does. They sit in the dark car, and Cas is looking at him all self-satisfied at his victory, and Dean could lean over and just kiss him and no one would know.
“I bet,” Dean snorts. “It just so happens that wherever I am, you don’t want to be.”
“Well, I — don’t forget Jack’s sour cream, by the way — I was thinking about what I said.”
Dean pauses for a second, makes a gesture like
Cas looks to Claire, who is obviously thinking about something. Claire nods, finally. “Cool.”
“Buddy, I need you to say something,” Dean begged, putting his shield on his back and coming closer to the table, expression as transparent as it had always been when he thought Castiel wasn’t looking. “Cas.”
Before Dean can respond, the doctor comes in, eyes finally dry. Sam trails in after him, looking worried. Sam always looks worried. It’s a large part of his personality.
Not thinking about it is a struggle.
The next heading on Wikipedia is entitled
This sentence feels less real, less pressing when it’s said in the dark. Dean can make out the edge of Cas’ cheekbone, the side of his mouth. He swallows and swallows and swallows.
“Nah, Sam is in the frozen food aisle with Jack. They’re picking out popsicle flavors or something. Those are alright, but personally, I’m more of a Rocky Road fan myself,” Dean says, nudging Castiel’s arm and raising his eyebrows like
Nevertheless. They don’t hold hands in public because it doesn’t occur to them that they can. Sometimes Dean will put a hand on Cas’ shoulder or back, but that’s as close as they get. At diners, they slide into the middle ground of their shared booth and rest with their shoulders pressed against each other, their thighs are only an inch apart. Dean will look at Cas’ hands on the table, twisting and retwisting the wrapper off of a straw. This is what affection looks like — like it’s always looked like for them. Loved over a table. Loved through the backseat of a car. Loved through the inches apart from each other. It’s only the touch that’s new.
“Now I really gotta go to sleep,” Dean chuckles wetly. “Crying in the kitchen like a teenage girl.”
They’re both working on trying to say what they want. It’s a hard process, but it is going well. That morning, Dean came up to Cas while he was getting changed and asked if he— If he wanted to drive the Impala. Cas, very somberly, nodded, accepting this like the gift it was. Though Cas probably thought it was more a symbolic thing than a Dean-is-horny thing, but they both win, so it’s all water under the bridge.
“It would make you feel a whole lot better, Mr. Novak. I would bet my whole medical career on it,” Dr. Kerubin says. Dean looks at Cas and nods, his eyes liquid and hot.
They wait in silence for Dean to choke out whatever he’s going to say. There’s a soccer mom-type waiting behind them to grab a sheet cake, and she looks pissed at the interruption.
“Come on Jack, I’ll help you bandage it,” Cas says, grimacing. He helps Jack up and nods to Dean as he and Jack shuffle by him on the way to the kitchen bathroom. Sam grabs their first aid kit from below the sink and tosses it at Cas, who catches it with a hand and tucks it underneath his arm. They head to the bathroom, and Jack sits on the toilet seat and looks down at his hand, eyes troubled.
me,” Sam said.
It feels good. Cas takes a second to kiss back, but Dean just powers through because he thinks he knows there’s another side to this slight awkwardness. It’s different from kissing Amara, or Lisa, or Cassie. Cas’ stubble grinds on Dean’s as he opens his mouth slightly. Cas’ mittens, which he brings because now he has bad circulation, are warm on Dean’s neck. Dean breaks away from Cas for a second to bring wetly onto his collar.
The darkness is just as overwhelming as before. Castiel is still somehow awake in this mass of emptiness. He wishes he could just sleep, to become unconscious and oblivious and forever dreaming.
“Would you—,” Dean says. His fingers are trembling as he reaches out and traces the shape of Cas’ nose. “Ever?’
As the months go on, it occurs to Cas that Dean cooks because it calms him down. It allows him to use his hands, and it allows him to be productive, and there’s a clearly defined set of steps that will get him from one point to another. It’s a comforting notion, that we can follow a path correctly and we will end up somewhere else a hundred percent of the time. Especially for someone like Dean, who has been following paths since before he was born that have never led him anywhere particularly good for all his effort. Except for here, maybe. Except for now. But.
“All of it,” Cas says quietly, eyes roaming all over Dean’s face. He is intent on saying something, but he’s not sure how to say it. “I like them all.”
“Is it me?” Dean says. His voice breaks again, and he suddenly feels like he’s an inch tall and ten years old again.
,” Crowley keeps going. He’s smiling, even as Castiel breaks his restraints open with a metal fist and launches out of his seat. I’ll kill you, Castiel thinks as he punches the glass as hard as he can. The whole cube shudders. I’ll kill you for this.
Cas comes back with two pairs of brightly colored shoes in his hands, offering the ones with the fluorescent green zig-zag detailing to Dean and keeping the ones with orange polka dots for himself. Dean flicks his eyes from the outstretched shoes to Cas’ very serious expression.
“Anywhere you are, I want to be,” Cas says earnestly. “But I do not trust myself.”
“I think we’re talking around something and it would mean a lot to me if we discussed it,” Cas starts,  looking at his hands. “I understand it might be awkward, but I’m willing to press through it.”
“Well,” Cas says. “Yes.”
he thinks as Cas rolls his sleeves up past his elbow in efficient little twists,
is what he’s saying. Nothing feels big enough. Cas told him before he
“Dean,” Cas says patiently. “I texted him while we were at the bowling alley. He’s fine.”
“In a sense,” Cas says. “She’s like my daughter, if you want to get technical.”
“He makes a very good pot roast,” Cas says instead of
“Soon,” Dean says, leaning slightly to look Cas in the eye. “Not now, but soon.”
“Good. Good. I’m glad someone appreciates my cooking,” Dean says, unclenching his arms. He hedges for a second. “Any favorites?”
Dean raises his eyebrows. “The shrimp?”
“Even if I were to miss being an angel, no amount of food would make me feel better about my choice,” Cas says. He drums his fingers on the table, looking out towards the next room, where Dean was clanging around and swearing in the garage.
The Rocky Road Dean buys has marshmallows and milk chocolate folded in with vanilla ice cream. The molecules are barely noticeable when he eats it, and he gives it this time to Dean, who shrugs and eats the rest.
“Are you - are you taking it back?” God, they’re in a Costco.
Cas looks skeptical, but he starts digging anyway. Dean knows that Cas pretends to be so otherworldly sometimes, but he must have some sort of music preference. Not that there’s a wide breadth of musical genres in that crumpled box, but there’s enough for a man to have opinions. Just no Tchaikovsky or anything like that.
“Did Dean update you about… everything?” Cas hedges, squinting. He doesn’t know who knows and who doesn’t, doesn’t know the protocol for asking. By the way Jody cocks her head, she’s not in the know.
Castiel Novak’s
Cas has to answer Dean. He has to tell him no, that it’s too dangerous. That he still has those trigger words in his brain, that he has screaming nightmares. That sometimes he goes mute for days, that the taste of fake orange flavoring makes him shake. He is a burden. He is noth-
Cas watches his improbable mouth and his straight nose and the muscles under his skin move and thinks, for the first time in his life, that someone out there must like him a little bit, if only to let him have this after all he’s done.
“No,” Castiel says. He knows it is futile. He says it anyway.
Castiel tries to hide his sigh, but he is unsuccessful. The man’s broad shoulders stiffen. He turns. His mask is covering his nose, the turn of his chin. But it is him.
“I would never,” Dean hisses. His eyes are welling up. He looks angry at himself, the situation, at the tears themselves for existing. “I will never do that again, you hear me? Never.”
“I wasn’t doing anything else,” Castiel says. “It is either this or waiting outside until the sun comes up.” Castiel does indeed do this, but he tries to make it sound like a joke.
and he smiles wide when you ask him to help. And that night, you will kiss the love of your life on his forehead and on his nose and on his mouth, and when you dream, you dream of crust, and love, and peeling apples.
Dean grabs his arm before he stands, and then hesitates. “Is there… anything else you wanted to talk about?”
It had been a week since he and Jack saved Cas, tearing Cas’ grace to shreds and relieving Jack of God duty in order to get him out. Dean slept in the chair in Cas’ room for his first few days back, watching him every time he shifted in his sleep. He left only at Sam’s urging.
“You are,” Dean says, closing his eyes against the feeling. “You always were, Cas.”
“I have to tell you something and you have to promise not to leave,” Dean says quickly. His face is closed off again, his brow furrowed. He’s not making eye contact. Cas’ heart elevates, and Dean must hear it, because he squints at his chest.
“I would try everything in my power to save you,” Cas says, reaching his hand out to cup Dean’s jaw. “But I wouldn’t go back. Although.”
“Jesus, Cas. I would never -,” Dean says. But that’s the rub. He did, several times. He changes tactics.
Dean leans close to Cas and whispers, “Is this a Western-themed bowling alley?” Cas ignores him, instead choosing to walk up to the front desk and converse with the teenage attendant very seriously. Dean is glad the conversation is out of his hands, because he’d have no idea what the hell he would even say.
“Yeah?” Dean says, clearing his throat. He tries to pretend that he’s definitely been focusing on the road for a little while.
“I think people go to school for that,” Claire says, biting into a chunk of Kaia’s buffalo cauliflower. Kaia looks happy whenever someone tries it, especially Claire. Cas watches her and Dean in turn and smiles to himself.
So he commits to the surgery. Of course he does.
“Subs! Nothing like a midnight sub, right?” Dean says, looking adamantly at the wall beside Cas’ head. Cas nods, sighing. The noises of the bunker at night — the clanking of the pipes, the rain against the door above them — amplify in the quiet. It makes Cas feel like he is the belly of some large, lumbering beast, or deep in the earth, mining something precious from the ground.
“Yeah, sweetheart,” Dean says softly. Dean has always been quicker to use “bud,” “man,” or “dude,” and Cas sees them as the terms of endearment they are. But a
Cas remembers looking into that nothingness and trying to remember scenes from his life to fill it - not even the scant happy ones, but the normal ones. The inside of the Gas ’n Sip on Route 45, the golf course they drove past once. He couldn’t remember any of it, not a single blade of grass. Just soul-shredding emptiness.
“I don’t know if I ever told you this, but he— I was sent into his version of my future. 2014 Croatoan-style. I was there but I was awful. Lucifer was wearing Sam like a prom dress. You were—,"
he thinks. He turns the key.
“Nothing,” Castiel says, taking a step over the door and shutting the door behind him.
Fuck. Dean knows rationally that this is probably just going to be a discussion of movie night, or Jack’s new lactose intolerance, or how the power washer works. But God, it could be something else, right? He looks himself over. T-shirt. Basketball shorts. Socks. Well, Cas has seen him butt-naked and covered in gore in Hell, this isn’t any worse.
“Don’t you worry about that. Now, let’s discuss your home, shall we? Not Ohio, and definitely not Kansas. Your real home, Cas.”
Cas points him along a little route, one that takes them past Lebanon onto highway 36. They both watch as the last hint of sunlight dips down below the horizon. Dean cranks Pink Floyd.
“Yeah, me too, Cas,” Dean says. “That’s kinda the whole point of this.” He gestures between them, the hand on the chest, Dean leaning into it. The people in their house, unaware of both of their quickly beating hearts and dry mouths.
“What are we thinking next?” Dean says, smiling down at Cas.
“You, of all people, should know that life isn’t fair,” Cas says, and grins, and Dean feels very, very fragile all of a sudden, like this is a moment that will shatter him if he lets it.
They both breathe shallowly for a moment. Dean pauses for a millisecond, leans forward to rest his forehead on Castiel’s. “I never thought it would happen. Not in my wildest dreams,” Castiel says quietly, a confession in itself. Dean nods against his forehead, an apology or a benediction or a simple acknowledgment of fact. They spent years and years circling around something neither of them could name.
“Let’s go to bed, hey. It’s late,” Dean says, feeling like he should be something like an adult. He and Cas usher Jack to his bedroom, turning out the kitchen and hallway lights on the way. Before Cas can disappear into Jack’s bedroom to talk about things Dean isn’t allowed to know about, he grabs Cas’ arm and holds him back. Jack stumbles into his bedroom, oblivious.
When they wiped him that first time, when they wiped Dean and Sam Winchester and his brothers and Kansas from his mind entirely, his alliances didn’t change entirely, not quite. When she - a handler named Naomi who would only show up in perfect gray pantsuits and crisp notepads - asked him to kill a Captain America proxy, he couldn’t. Whatever spell Winchester had on him was uncrackable by electric currents and implanted nodes. Castiel stood next to this Winchester proxy and he wept.
He is. He just
“Indeed,” Castiel says. The rabbit finally freezes at the sudden sound and bounds away a second later. They both watch as it disappears deeper in the forest, and then Cas turns around to actually look at his interloper.
He remembers being raised from slumber laid neatly between two of his siblings. He remembers it being so
Cas is very still when he thinks. It’s like he’s mapping out every possible option and mentally rehearsing it before saying it.
With that, Cas turns tail and heads to the lane christened with a single yellow neon star. Dean scampers after him, grimacing at one of the moms as she smirks at him from her lane.
There is a fight. Castiel remembers very little of it.
“Ready to go?” Dean says, facing him again sheepishly. “Charlie burned us a couple tapes apparently. It’s a long way to Kansas.”
Dean is trying valiantly to keep the conversation going in the same direction when Cas wordlessly gets up and offers Dean a hand. Dean takes it, deflating. Next time he’ll say it, and it’ll have all the gentleness that doesn’t come easy to him. He’s sure of it.
Dean reached over Cas to wrestle his t-shirt from under Cas’ chest and he slipped it on and he left Cas in their bed, flicking the light on in the hallway behind him. His shoulders were broad and strong and it hurt Cas to look at them.
Cas likes how happiness looks on him. All of them have suffered exorbitantly, but he wonders deep in his heart if Sam has perhaps suffered the most out of all of them. Not that Sam would ever admit it, even in the dark depths of his soul.
“Ever go back, I assume,” Cas says. He looks, at that moment, as human as anything could be, the thin veins under his skin light blue. The fluttering pulse in his neck. “No.”
The configuration of their lives is like this — Dean sits in the front seat, and in the ten seconds it takes for Cas to open the door to the passenger side, he thinks about giving him the keys and asking him to drive.
Castiel breathes it all in, already dreading the absence of it in his life. He wants to be able to explain this to someone without them knowing Dean and still knowing that they understand - a handsome man leaning on you for comfort, smelling like a desert, calling you his friend.
“About going to the gay bar. We don’t have to bring Sam and Jack,” Dean says. “That was a cop-out, I think. On my part.” He laughs quietly to himself. “Maybe I could finally get you out of that coat.”
“Sure were. Full-blown hedonist too. Popped pills, orgies, the whole works. You were wearing a shirt that looked like it fell off the business end of a Cabela’s,” Dean chuckles. “You hated me. I was a jerk though. I would’ve hated me too.”
“I guess a plain ol’ Caesar will do, hey?” Sam says, voice shifting as he turns to look at Jack. Dean drops his hand finally, curling it beside him. Cas leans in after it for a second before standing up straight and facing the conversation like an adult.
“Great. Just keep me in the know when you’re done, don’t want to Snape-Kills-Dumbledore you, you know,” Dean says, itching the back of his neck. “Uh, you hungry? I got BLTs on the brain.”
“Hey,” Dean says quietly as he opens the door. He’s wearing a pair of loose sweatpants and a grey t-shirt. If pressed, Cas could name all major muscle groups through the fabric. He doesn’t exactly mind it.
“Typical,” Dean says out loud to himself. The festering blister Cas’ absence causes him has been rubbed open so many times you could probably see the movement of Dean’s insides through it, like those cows with the holes in their sides. Sometimes his skin feels so raw and translucent that you could probably see through him if you held him up to the light.
Cas looks off into the distance, flattening his grip on Dean’s collar and then dragging his hands down the front of Dean’s chest, thinking. He looks at Dean, at his big green eyes going from Cas’ eyes to his nose to his cheeks. The way he smiles when Cas woodenly tells a joke to the room at large, the way he used to look away when Cas saw him looking back. His hands, large and warm, stroking either side of his ribs with his thumbs. He is struck, as he often is, by Dean’s handsome face, his nose, the way his smile makes his eyes wrinkle at the corners.
Cas hums next to him. A wind chime from the dim building across the street rings.
“Nothing,” Sam says, lightly. “You just seem happy, is all. Nice to see that on you.”
From the beginning, everything that could’ve been a problem during the case became a problem. There was a dead husband’s ghost in the newly single mother’s bedroom, breathlessly trying to convince her to get out of their house. There was the brackish water streaming down the walls and puddling under their shoes as the ghost tried to talk to them with his throat torn open. Then there was a knocked-over candle in their barn spreading to the piles of dry hay. The kids Dean had to save, two twin girls, watched the structure go up in flames in silence.
Dean brings them to a couple houses in northern Kansas, on the outskirts of a small town there.
“Tell me if I’m misreading this,” Dean says quietly. The light inside the sunroom is orange and yellow. Somewhere in the distance, a bird chirps its morning song.
It goes like this: Dean watches Cas and Cas watches Dean. They look when the other is looking and when they are not. They carve out spaces on the couch for the other to claim, looking hesitant as they do, shoving their jackets onto the seat beside them at diners while the other orders. It is a middle school romance just as much as it is the romance that killed God, and it quietly rends them the closer they get to one another.
“Huh?” Dean says. They both look at each other, simultaneously having the notion that they’ve missed something important. “Your feelings?"
“Yeah,” Dean says. “And I know that too.”
Dean shrugs and turns to go too, but Cas stops him with a hand to the chest. Dean stills, eyes weary.
Cas nods. She was a high-ranking SHIELD officer assigned to the Captain America project during the war. Cas was on the front lines too often to know her very well, but received most of his information during the hours Dean would sit, dreamy eyed, writing letters to her on the bunk table. Cas would always double-check his responses for spelling errors.
Dean laughs, which is all Cas needs to drop his shoulders from where they’ve been pushing up towards his ears. And the evening continues, and they answer questions about where and why, and Dean’s hand never goes far from his. In the end, that is all he wanted. Just Dean’s thumb, drawing circles on his neck while he talks to Sam and Jody. Just to be loved like this at all.
“Why? Maybe the best is all they want.”
More accurately, Dean Winchester put him in a glass cube, and then left.
“Yeah,” Dean says happily. He’s very handsome like this, coming to save Castiel. Castiel assumes this is what this is, a saving. He wonders if Chuck is dead, if Dean has forgiven him for dying again. Probably not on both accounts, but Castiel can deal with both eventually. Preferably when he has clothes on.
“I doubt that,” Cas says. “I don’t think I could stand to be there if I did.”
Dean is back and doesn’t hate him. Those words come ringing into his brain and he sighs at the relief it brings. Dean doesn’t hate him. Dean wishes he would’ve stayed.
“You’ve talked to S—? Alright. Well, guess that makes sense,” Dean says. Both of his hands are clenched in his sheets.
Ever since Dean confessed, Cas has caught Dean looking at him from the corner of his eye.
“Yeah, you do,” Dean insists. He looks, suddenly, like his heart has been ripped from its dark hiding place and thrown into the unforgiving sun. And then all the doors explode inwards at once.
It feels like a dream that Cas is here. That they’re driving together, that Cas is sitting heavy on the seat next to him. His cologne curls throughout the car around him. It smells like some expensive wood. It reminds him of those perfume ads he used to flip through, waiting for Sam to get done his math tutoring. He breathes it deep in his chest, trying to commit it there permanently.
“Sometimes I would stand in a marketplace in Morocco and watch as the grandmothers bought their grandchildren fruit,” Cas says. His hands are crossed over each other neatly on his chest. “And they would argue with the vendor that it was too much.”
“I,” Dean said, his voice unsteady in the silence between them. He watched their shut door for a second, and he took Cas’ hand and squeezed it. “I’ll be back, Cas. I promise.”
“It’s your favorite. I know,” Castiel finishes, picking up the knife in question. “John gave it to you when you were a child. I remember.”
“I know you think that,” Jody says, not unkindly. “But put yourself in her shoes, Cas. This is a big step, meeting the family. Even if her family is the possessed vessel of her dad and two random tall guys.” She turns to face out into the foyer, where Dean and Claire are sniping over barbecue utensils. “This is about as normal as this sort of thing will get for her.”
“You’re Dean,” Castiel says instead. He wants to put his hands in his pockets to hide the shine of his arm. “I read about you online.”
He breathes deep and rests the knife against the skin there.
“Toldja,” Jody whispers. Cas grunts.
, Dean thinks, looking at the way Cas’ t-shirt hugs his chest as he twists the wheel to and fro.
“I hate knowing people think I would do something to them,” Sam said, and he hunched his shoulders up as he looked around behind Cas’ head. He looks smaller that way, Cas mused. Like a teenage boy waiting to be punished.
“Thank you,” Cas says, in that over-earnest way of angels. He rolls the sleeves of his henley up past his elbows from where they’ve fallen.
“I thought I heard someone slinging crap over here,” Dean says as he comes back in the room, Sam just behind him. Dean jogs down to stand to Cas’ left, standing a non-personal foot away. Cas can see Dean calculating the exact distance between friendly and intimate and thinks about stepping forward into it. “He thinks he can get me to give up my morning ribeye.”
“Krispy Kremes. I was running late, hoped you fellas wouldn’t mind. We figured there would be very little vegetables at this table, so Kaia made fried buffalo cauliflower,” Jody says, handing her box of donuts to Cas, who accepts them solemnly and places them on the kitchen counter. “I also brought wine.”
“Turn here,” Cas says eventually. They’re in some bigger city, one with actual bars and restaurants and movie theatres. The street they turn onto has a bar that has an actual lineup snaking down the block in front of it. Dean scoffs as they pass by it, craning his neck to see what could possibly be worth lining up for.
They had, just previously, been very, very close to one another. Close enough that Cas could feel the heat of Dean’s body on his neck, and in between his knees, and curled around his ankles.
They sit there, their heads leaned together for what feels like hours. Just two men and the world slowly erasing every atom of them.
“If you’re truly not tired,” Cas starts. Dean is already shaking his head. How could he be tired of living like this? “If you’re sure. There’s a green space on our way back. Hopefully it won’t be too long a detour.”
Dean tsked, placing his hands on either side of Cas’ ribcage and leaving them there. They feel like two warm spots on his chest, two separate heartbeats. “You joke, but you should’ve seen him growing up. Geez, I almost got my head bitten off every time I talked to him under the age of seventeen.”
, you know. About her house next to a little river that her kids would swim in when it was hot. She would always show me pictures of them on her phone,” Dean chuckles wetly. “She made it sound so good, you know. Having a family. Not having to solve a world-ending crisis.”
Dean sees this new Cas, this human Cas, this less-of-a-wild-animal Cas, across a room and he watches him like someone might do a painting, although he has never had the vocabulary for that. He thinks if he gets too close, he might start seeing the brushstrokes. That there are cracks in Cas that might show something evil inside him, scratching to get out, parts of the Empty that never quite cleared customs. He will realize that no matter how close he gets to Cas, it will always be just Cas, looking back at him. And looking.
Dean looks back at him witheringly before checking his watch for the fourth time in one minute. Claire, Kaia, and Jody were going to be coming in twenty minutes, according to Cas’ innate timekeeping sense. That, along with a broad knowledge of human languages and angel sigils, is one of the few things that transferred when he fell. It gives him a warm feeling whenever he uses it.
“It was microwavable crap, but it was —,” Dean says. He twists a banana free of its brothers, laying it gently on the counter next to him. “I thought it was pretty damn good.”
“Last chance,” Dean says finally. Cas looks up at him, squinting. “Last chance to tell me what’s going on with you before I start asking around.”
“I wish you could too,” The Empty says to him. The voice is Balthazar's this time. It has seemingly run out of all the people he's killed to torture them with, so it goes between Balthazar, Anna, and Dean. He ignores it and tries to shut what he thinks are his eyes. He does so for what feels like seconds, hours, years, millennia until he’s sure he’s alone again.
Jack eyes Dean with some degree of suspicion, which Dean takes offense to. What, just because he’s human doesn’t mean he’ll let Cas
“Hard sell, but I think I can manage that,” Dean says. He picks up the bowl again and gets to work softening that bitch. Cas comes over quietly behind him and wraps his floury hands around Dean’s waist and hugs him tight. He kisses the nape of Dean’s neck once and rests his giant head there carefully.
“I hate feeling like a monster, Cas,” Sam said once. They were waiting in front of a movie theatre while Dean was flirting with the cashier over popcorn. It takes a few minutes but he usually leaves with free candy if he’s stubborn enough.
“Yeah,” Dean bristles. He’s closing off already, his shoulders rounding. “I’m going to take that as a no, then. Good talk.”
“Even once is too much, Dean,” Cas says. He’s not quite sure how Dean isn’t getting how dangerous he is, or if he’s actively choosing to ignore it. “If I hurt you or Sam, even by accident, I’ll never forgive myself.”
“Geek,” Dean coughs into his hand. Sam glowers at him, flips him off, and opens the passenger door roughly to slide in.
Cas steers him to the gazebo with a hand on his sleeve, and Dean doggedly follows him until they’re both parked on a bench in the gazebo, looking out at the tiny pond and the dark ghost of the building next to them. It’s well into the night now, the sun tucked directly under the horizon and the stars bright and shining. If Dean had the mind to, he would pull out his old tricks and tuck his arm over Cas’ shoulder, pointing out the constellations he recognized. Cas probably knows all of them already. Maybe even created a few.
“Heard you can catch a catfish the size of a toddler in there,” Dean says finally, nodding towards the reservoir, the shifting waters, the rocky beach below it. He’s pretty sure he’s heard that.
Looking at it like this, beige and squat in the middle of a small town, it’s weird Dean was ever scared of it in the first place. Not so shabby, Dean thinks warmly, and then they drive right past it.
He doesn’t mean to do it so creepily. It just so happens the library is on the left of the kitchen, and he was thinking about his lunch — BLT on homemade beer bread, should you be suitably impressed — and there’s a flash in the corner of his eye, so he turns.
Dean catches Cas reading a book two weeks after Cas’ homecoming.
“Yeah? From who?” Dean says, feeling jealousy curl up in his chest.
God, he doesn’t know.
“Thank you, Dean. It’s nice to hear that,” Cas says, ignoring the mustard. There’s a streak of red skin rising from his polo shirt that Dean can’t stop looking at. Cas shifts his weight like he’s going to stand up. “Thank you for the talk.”
Doll’s Saloon is a lot less intimidating in the daytime.
Sometimes, when he gets knocked in the head on some of these hunts, he wishes he could get amnesia and forget all about monsters and demons and sigils and exorcisms and everything that his dad pumped into his brain since he was four years old. Sometimes he looks at a man in the line at IHOP and feels so jealous, like he’s a little kid and Dave or Bill or whoever has a shiny new truck he wants and is dangling it just out of his reach.
“There’s so little meat in this animal this feels hardly worth it,” Cas says, putting down the leg he was gnawing on. Dean reaches over and downs the liquids out of the shell, to Cas’ immediate scowl.
Dean tears his eyes away and goes to the bench to shuck off his own boots. There are like ten thousand laces on these things. He’s glad he wore his nice socks today, the ones without any holes in ‘em. He slides on his puffy paint abomination of a shoe, and Cas waits until Dean ties the last bow before he gets up and takes off the trenchcoat, dropping it back onto his seat without a word.
They’ve returned to where Baby is sitting in the dark, and Cas is grimly reporting their trip to a weirdly anxious Jack. Dean side-eyes Cas for the umpteenth time, his worry etching a hole in him.
“That’s not fair,” Dean says quietly. Cas must know about Dean’s… affliction, this is just painful confirmation of it. Cas must see this love all over him like a stain.
When the asset is finally brought to a doctor for the first time in seventy years, a friend of Iron Man’s Charlie Bradbury, the doctor has to leave the room to cry.
His mind flashes back to Lucifer, wearing Cas like a raincoat, putting Cas’ hand on the wrong shoulder. What if this is some sort of manifestation? What if this is a
Dean wonders what he would’ve done if Cas had gone to the Empty in that gazebo. Probably would’ve tried to grab his arm and go with him. Probably would’ve stayed there for weeks if he couldn’t, a guard dog looking for his last resting spot.
“Did he now?” Jody muses. “Dean’s an interesting guy, isn’t he.”
“It’s fine, Cas. I freaked out a little bit back there,” Dean says. He doesn’t look at Cas, can’t stand to see Cas pitying him and his awful human feelings. “Let’s just sit here and look at the stars, huh. Bright tonight.”
“Tell me, Cas,” Crowley starts. Cas rankles at the nickname coming from this unfamiliar man’s mouth. “You’ve experienced a great big load of bullshit, eh?”
Cas— well, blush isn’t really a word you could apply to Cas. It’s like saying a rock looked bashful. But whatever the swinging fairy lights were doing, or whatever Dean’s awful vision could suss out, it really does look like he is blushing. It’s up near his eyes and down his neck, pink pink pink.
“Cas is cooking tonight,” Sam says as soon as Dean bustles in from his weekly grocery trip, knocking the door shut behind him with the tip of his boot. He, in typical Dean fashion, refused to do more than one trip to the car and back, and therefore hisses as he eases the ten or so bags off his arms. Jack, who had been waiting patiently at the table, dives in immediately, pawing through the contents like a raccoon.
Dean slides his jacket back on when Cas does, and watches the security camera screen carefully as Cas goes to return their shoes. His eyes don’t flash when he faces the camera. Not a shifter. Dean sighs pretty hard in relief, nodding to the front desk clerk who looks suspicious.
feelings?” Cas says, looking dismayed. “Why would I be talking about your feelings?”
“Would it be to save you?” Cas says. Dean shrugs, tracing Cas’ jaw now. He doesn’t look at his eyes, the eerie blue of them inhuman in the dim bunker light.
“Scandalous,” Claire says, smiling at him. “You bribe him or something?”
Dean’s lips are so careful against his, only moving a little, like he’s waiting for Cas to turn away from him. Cas turns into it instead, gently sliding his hand up Dean’s chest to rest at his collarbone. Dean’s breath is uneven on his cheek.
“I like spending time with you, Cas,” Dean says, aiming for casualness. Major understatement, but hey, who’s counting.
“I can’t,” Cas says. “I can’t, Dean.”
Dean purses his lips and looks off into the kitchen. “You coming?”
“Oh,” Dean stalls. Someone hits the back of their cart, and Cas and Dean both glare at the interloper. The perp, an old woman, glares back as she wheels around them.
Cas has them driving out of state, which means that Dean mentally catalogs every motel he passes by in case he needs to find somewhere to sleep.
“Well, it certainly seems like the truth,” says Dean. He can feel a hard, cold pearl of anger in his chest form. He wants to give into it, say something petty and mean, to make Cas feel how he feels when Cas leaves him. He shouldn’t. He shouldn’t.
“I’ve noticed,” Cas says shortly. He breathes deeply against the nausea churning in his gut. Dean leans back in his chair and rubs his eyes, resting his hands there for a beat too long.
“Cas said he bought potatoes for it a few days ago,” Jack said cheerfully, having found and claimed his gummy worms. “Thank you for my worms, Dean.”
Sam shrugs. “He said he found a recipe online. Seemed really excited about it.” Sam had put flank steak, medium grain couscous, and organic bell peppers — which he eats raw — on the list for himself. Dean is a perpetual bitch about it, but he makes sure to get the crunchiest, most organic bell peppers he can, even if they are Satan’s vegetable.
, and then hugs him. The wind is brushing through the trees. The chokecherry bushes are dotted in little red fruits. Castiel reflectively returns it, and then really returns it, leaning his head against Dean’s.
The handlers were disgusted. They had expected the killing machine they formed with their own hands to be ruthless, that he had no soul left, that they had scooped it out of him. Yet the Winter Soldier wept anyway, his ruined shoulder shaking with the effort of it.
“Well,” Cas says, crossing his arms and leaning against the countertop. “Would it help you to know that if you weren’t fine, you wouldn’t be alone?”
“I, uh. I made all the good stuff so you could try them. Try out your new taste buds. Not like you got to last time,” Dean says, itching the back of his neck with a spatula he held.
“Yeah, of course, buddy,” Dean says, moving off to the side of the bed. “Is it, uh. Is it something bad?”
“Don’t,” Dean said, pleading. “Don’t do that.”
You need ice-cold water because you need to keep the butter cold so your crust doesn’t become an oily mess. You need to put the crust in the fridge when you’re not using it, so the ambient heat of your room doesn’t melt your precious work. You need good, crisp Granny Smith apples, not those mushy Red Delicious’ that Ernie at the market keeps trying to give you.
section is brief. Castiel Novak was born in Pontiac, Illinois, the youngest of six siblings and the devout son of a pastor. As his father became more distant as his practice grew larger, his older brother Gabriel took reluctant care of him, his other siblings too old to care about a seven year old.
“So,” Dean says, leaning onto the back of Cas’ chair. “What do you think?” His eyes are hopeful, mouth set. Hoping for the best but preparing for Cas to tell him to go fuck himself and his lemon pepper wings. Like Cas would ever.
“I wasn’t in Ohio,” Castiel says. He knows why Dean is here in his kitchen, going through his things. “I don’t kill people anymore.”
“We’ll find Chuck, Cas. I swear to you,” Dean says. “If it’s the last thing I do, we’ll beat that bastard.”
“You’re telling me,” Sam mutters under his breath while taking a sip of his wine. Cas and Dean both pretend not to hear him.
suspended in the darkness  —  old angels and demons, nothing more than torn apart corpses. If they were animals, Dean might’ve called them roadkill.
“He said he’s “trying something new,’” Sam says, complete with air quotes. He pushes his hair behind his ears as Jack wanders back in to grab the next grocery item, eyes obviously peeled for the gummy worms Dean always gets him.
,” Crowley finishes. The glass finally breaks and what was Castiel Novak tumbles to the floor in a rain of shattered glass.
“That is… heartening,” Cas tries. “I will try my best.”
There, in his favorite leather armchair, is Cas, reading some book from the library. His back is hunched over it and his shoulders are hiked up to his ears, and Dean has half the mind to tell him to save himself some back pain and straighten up, like his mom might’ve said in another life. Cas must hear some small noise — his shoe on the ground, his heartbeat — and looks directly at him, head tilted.
Forgive him. He’s got a lot more living left to do.
“Yeah, you sure have,” Sam laughs, picking up a taco from over Cas’ shoulder and sitting down across from him. Cas grimaces with effort as he pulls the middle piece of the crab’s carapace off, digging in his fingers into the shell and scraping out the gills.  Liquid seeps from the crab’s shell around his gloved hands, puddling on the table.
He breathes as deep as he can as the skin starts to refashion over it, moving jerkily underneath his fingertips. Being an abomination has its upsides. In a moment, the only thing that will remain is the shakiness of his human fingers as he starts digging the other tracking chip out of the metal arm.
Now for the tracking -
In the midst of Castiel’s obsessive categorizing, Dean has caught him with his metaphorical dick in his hand. The knives, all Dean’s, spill onto the kitchen table in surprise.
“Yeah. Sure. Merit badge,” Sam says, typing something onto his computer. Dean huffily makes his own sandwich, and opens his mouth to say another thing — because really, Sammy, he’s not a 1950’s housewife, he’s
“Uh,” Cas says. He grabs the list out of his pocket again. The only thing Dean has written in his neat handwriting is SHORT RIB 2.5LB. “That’s it, I believe.”
He looks back at Cas, and Cas quickly averts his eyes so Dean can’t tell what he’s been looking at. He is overcome with the desire to slide his hand into Cas’ jacket, around the warm dip of his waist. Ten years ago that would’ve scared him. He looks back to the lake.
“Oh?” Jody says, swallowing and taking a sip from her wine. Claire breaks away from where she’s been smiling at Kaia and raises her eyebrows. Sam and Jack smile at Cas encouragingly, and Jack even gives him a thumbs up from under the table. Cas is grateful for them, but he also wishes he could melt into the floor.
Cas looks up at Ellie who's patiently waiting for his order. He looks around the meat shop and straightens when he sees he’s the only one there.
Unbeknownst to Castiel, Dean watches his every move with his brow furrowed. There is something wrong but he can’t figure out what it is.
“Well, we have to tell both Claire and Kaia that Dean and I are… together. I don’t know how she’s going to react,” Cas sighs. Jack nods in sympathy. When he and Dean broke the news to Jack about their relationship, he was slightly confused, but ultimately accepted it with little fanfare. Sam’s reaction had decidedly more fanfare. “I am still in her father’s body, after all.”
“Dean, you must know—,” Cas starts, looking at his hands as they curl into fists. “You must know. You have to. You can’t make me say it.”
“I think a lot of the finer details of horror novels are lost on me. At no point do I think they are in true danger,” Cas says, eyes down on the book, lips pursed. “All I am truly thinking is that if they had some sort of salt circle or sigil, they wouldn’t be in this predicament,” Cas frowns. “I could be overthinking it.”
“I thought you weren’t going to be back until Tuesday,” Dean says, tone straining to be light. Castiel nods and looks at rows of perfectly-faced peanut butter jars instead of Dean’s expression.
Sam bites through another mozzarella stick, thinking hard about something while Dean and Cas do their thing in the background. He is close to coming to a conclusion when Dean breaks him out of his reverie with a snap in his face.
This particular day is very mild and pleasant, the last bastion of summer before autumn arrives. Castiel watches the wild rabbits in the dense forest outside the bunker hop and thump the ground, and gently holds out his hand so they could sniff the grain he’s procured for this exact reason.
“He wants to make sure you don’t regret coming back human,” Sam says, eyeing the plate of chicken wings Cas has in front of him. Cas waves it to him. He inclines his head in gratitude.
“Yeah, man,” Dean says. “Where to?”
“Don’t be like that, ducky,” the man says disapprovingly. He tsks, a small noise Cas can hear perfectly through the foot-thick glass. “I’m just making conversation.”
“I’m just saying, if you haven’t tried,” Jody sighs and leans into the pillar. “Might be the time. Happened with me and Donna, you know. Could happen with you two.”
“That’s a nice thought,” Cas says. “Retirement.”
“How can I help?” Cas says finally. Dean looks back in slight shock. He looks very sleep-wrinkled, and he’s shivering in the frigid air, and he looks so much like a younger version of him that Cas has never seen that Cas just wants to move on. To forget this ever happened, and to let this fester between them like a wound.
Dean and Sam worked at various bars and butchers as Castiel trained as a bookseller as they got older, and they all lived in a small apartment near Castiel’s father’s church, and they were, by all intents and purposes, content. The asset tries and remembers these days, but all he gets is the sense memory of a hot and humid day - Sam’s high, sparkling laugh, Dean's green eyes and his wide, unconscious smile. He remembers how that smile made him feel. He swallows and keeps reading.
“What will it take to have you stay with us, huh?” Dean asks. “A padded cell? Tranquilizers? It’ll kill me but I’ll do it, Cas. I’ll do anything.”
“I heard about your stint as God, kid,” Jody says, balancing her cargo on her hip. “Glad to have you with us.”
“Like the most glorious thing you’ve ever seen,” Cas says, suddenly throwing a leg over Dean’s waist to straddle him and then leaning in close. They’re a hair breadth of a space away from each other now, lips ghosting over each other. When Cas’ lips move, it is like Dean is saying the words with him in an uneven recitation. “I was beautiful.”
More chatter on Dean’s end, some tinny voice telling him to attack. Or something. Castiel forces himself not to listen to the exact words. Privacy is important.
“Cas?”
“Dean,” Cas says, reaching for it again. Dean holds it higher, a big smile curling unconsciously over his face. Cas crosses his arms over Dean’s KANSAS CITY FISHING EXPO 2005 hoodie he pilfered from the laundry and watches as Dean chuckles. It’s a big, uncomplicated feeling, this happiness. Both of them give into it more often than not these days.
They both get out of the car quickly, and the cool flow of air conditioning as they open the door makes Dean sigh a sweet sigh of relief. Sometimes it feels like he’s pushing through hot, muggy soup in these Kansas summers. This is just nice. The interior of the alley is rife with neon too: bright green cactuses and yellow stars and brown boots above the lanes, dimmed slightly with age. The soundtrack is some twangy, folky thing, barely heard above the din of the crashing pins and celebratory yells.
All of the emergency lights in the room snap on, red and flashing, and shrill alarms go off on all sides of this room. He looks to Crowley, who looks nonplussed. Castiel is starting to have a sinking feeling in his gut, a remnant of his army days. The silence before the gunfire. The second between hitting the ground and the bomb going off.
As he walks through the streets, and the sun is rising, and the humans are in line for their coffee and laughing and not covered in blood and river water, he lets some deep instinct take over him. He lets his shoulders relax and his spine straighten and when a woman hits his shoulder and apologizes, he doesn’t kill her. He inclines his head and says
“Rachel—?” Dean stops, and turns around to face a clearly smug Sam. “What did you just say?”
“He’ll feel better sleeping in an actual bed,” Cas says. He eyes Jack. “Am I right?”
When it comes 一 and it does come, sure as the worms tilling the Earth and the saltwater eroding stone一 Castiel can walk endless grocery stores in his mind. He can walk the grounds of the bunker and identify every single rock he picks up. He can sit in the Bunker’s kitchen and cook a whole meal from the ingredients he knows sit on the pantry shelves. He can whistle every bird in Kansas’ song and imagine them all whistling back to him at once in a beautiful symphony of sound.
He is tired of this cyclical conversation. He is tired of Dean feeling sorry for himself, about the veil of misery he exudes with him every time he looks at Cas. He is here now, breathing freely and of his own volition against all odds. If Cas could even hold a grudge, it would’ve been gone the second Dean hugged him hello, willing to welcome whatever Cas was hugging him back.
“Okay,” Cas says. He releases Dean, who winks at him and goes up the stairs to where his meat is waiting.
“French fries, mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, uh. I didn’t make all of this, but —,” he shoves his spatula into his waist apron pocket and crosses his arms. “Most of it. Yeah.”
“This earth is miraculous,” Cas says. He looks at Dean now, steadily. “We are given the only best it has.”
Part of Dean resents that this be so complicated. Another part of Dean also knows that it isn’t, that this is how it’s always been and he has never realized it. That Benny wasn’t a one-off, only-port-in-a-storm situation. It’s painful to be forced to such a conclusion after watching the man he — Loves? Cares for? Has a crush on? — die again. Right in front of him. What an asshole.
“No, Dean.” Dean is about to grab a package of bagels when Cas stops him. “Before I died.”
“Come in,” he says, trying to sound nonchalant. He digs the needle into his pants and casually puts it beside him on the bed. He leans back, a little bit. Lengthens his neck.
Dean is a lot of things; a good cook, an okay brother, great at pool, bad at looking himself in the mirror; but he’s not stupid.
The asset remembers this old face. He remembered it before he realized he had a name of his own, before the conditioning sunk its claws in his brain. The freckles on Dean’s face and shoulders, growing more and more numerous in the bright Kansas summers. He remembers watching the sweat bead on Dean’s chest, remembers wanting to rest his mouth on the scars on his neck. He remembers the shame he felt when he thought it, how it mingled with pleasure in his chest.
Sometimes Dean wants to watch Cas drive his car, resting his elbow on the open window. Dean wants to watch Cas back up, his neck craned as he sees over the seats. Maybe his jacket is off and his shirt is rolled up, maybe to his elbows. Maybe he is wearing sunglasses too, those smaller ones that make him look like some kind of movie star. Maybe Cas looks at him when he’s driving and maybe he smiles at Dean, large and wide and uncomplicated. Maybe Cas calls him Dean in that voice of his. Maybe he watches Cas’ mouth form every letter.
“Me too,” Jack says, very seriously. “It’s,” he pauses. “It’s strange to be human.”
“Alright.”
The arm had regrown four times before they had to chop off the joint entirely, and they soldered the new arm on before it could regrow again. Castiel wasn’t awake for this - or he was, and the pain had been too much to bear - but the four small, wrong arms that were discarded fell in disarray around the operating table.
Dean thinks. He bristles at the thought.
a traitorous thought escapes. He lets it. The world could end any moment, what’s a little showboating to try and make his guy blush?
“No, no. I think you didn’t quite understand what I meant,” Cas says. “I said that romantically. I’m in love with you.”
“Uh,” Dean says. “I’m not, uh, totally. Gay.”
There’s a change in Dean when Cas returns.
“You got it!” Dean says, beaming at the twist of Cas’ hands as he methodically liberates the crab from one of its crusher claws with a dull crunch.
The apartment he finds himself in is probably an old HYDRA shell. He suspects he has fifty minutes before they notice him curled just on the inside of the door. He forces himself up on shaky legs and plucks every security camera he can find from their hiding places and crushes them in his palm.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Cas says at last.
“Then stay,” Dean whispers. God, Cas is making him say it. Out loud into the empty space between them.
“Thank you, Jody. Dean told me something similar when I asked him,” Cas says, unable to stop bringing up Dean if his life depended on it. “He said I’ll get a big head if he tells me again.”
Cas searches every inch of Dean’s face before chuckling breathlessly. “You don’t know,” Cas whispers to himself in amazement.
Claire hugs Cas goodbye, and she hugs Dean goodbye, and then she’s gone. Jody waves goodbye to everyone, and Kaia awkwardly thanks everyone for inviting her, and Dean pulls her into a hug too, because she’s part of Dean’s always-evolving definition of family permanently. Even if she and Claire broke up, Kaia would be part of that elusive group Dean would sacrifice himself for without a second thought. Kaia nods like she knows, and then she is gone too, disappeared into the Kansas rain.
“No, just the egg salad Cas made. I have cheese, I have chicken, you want a club sandwich?” Dean says, opening the fridge door and checking out the selection. “We have eggs and bacon, we can do a McMuffin thing.”
They’re not very big. True to Dean’s word, It’s two single story houses with most of its acreage being dense, thick forest. Dean goes into the city a couple times a month to visit Cassie and meet with SHIELD. Sam does his research and spends his days talking with the professor of History at the local college. There’s enough room out back for a garden, which Cas could spend his time tending to when he’s not sleeping, reading, or getting fat off of Dean’s cooking.
“I don’t mind the company if you want to stay,” Castiel says quietly. Dean’s eyes meet his and tries to read something there before he smiles limply and looks away.
“I want you to know whatever you say, I understand your opinion and I respect it, but I’m doing something for Jack and I,” Cas says, now looking squarely at Dean. Dean, being vaguely acquainted with the notion of passing out, is thinking that this is how it starts.
“Yes,” Cas says tonelessly. “I’m sure we will.”
“I can’t promise, but,” Cas says, laughing shakily. “I’ll try.”
“The fruit?” Dean says.
“Yes way,” Dean counters. “Dating.” He holds up their two hands like they won a race. Both of them are very stiff.
tired.
“Precisely,” Castiel says. “I was just thinking that.”
It turns out being turned into a ruthless killing machine and being frozen and unfrozen for dozens of years confuses your body down to its base level. It starts thinking cold is hot, sour is nauseating, that pain is necessary for function.
“Dean,” Cas says, annoyed. Dean was always a hoverer, someone to give you blankets and watch over you when you were sick. “I don’t want to be your pet project. I’ll be fine.”
“Alright, alright, keep your pants on,” Dean says, looking away from Cas now and turning a little bit red across the tops of his cheeks. True to what Sam said, Cas doesn’t think he’s seen that since 1943 - how Dean always laughs at his jokes, how Dean always leans in a little too close.
In fact, it’s one of the things that makes Cas
The butcher down the street at Pete’s Meats is not named Pete. Her name is Ellie, and she has always been nice to Castiel, even when he comes in and spends an hour staring at the display trying to figure out which one is flank steak or what filet looks like.
Dean grimaces as the Impala slows and pulls a U-Turn right in the middle of the street. He slides into the door as the Impala turns haltingly into the other lane, and a Subaru honks at them as it speeds by, almost clipping the paint. Dean flips him the bird. Asshole.
There’s a man in Castiel’s kitchen.
If Dean were a person fundamentally unaffected by Cas, someone he hasn’t been in thirteen years, he might’ve been able to hold onto his anger better and say no, but they’ve gone through it all. It’s Cas. It’s Cas, Dean imagines saying to an audience, begging them to see him. You don’t understand. It’s
“But it’s you, Cas,” Jack says, eyes creased in confusion. “It’s just you now.”
He used to think Jimmy’s heart was too big for his chest, constricting his airways at inopportune times for seemingly no reason back when Jimmy was just a thin sheath over his grace. He has since learned that’s just what it feels like to see Dean Winchester smiling back at you.
Of course, Dean picks that peaceful, quiet moment to come back rumbling into the room. Cas’ eyes go to him, following him as he goes about the kitchen.
He doesn’t know what year it is, but he has a watery memory of looking up something at the library as a child. He grimaces. Last time he checked, it was 1994. If he’s lucky, libraries as a concept still exist.
He just thinks that, lets it sit in his brain. He could kiss Cas. He’s been thinking about it ever since he almost lost him in Purgatory the second time. The first time, even. When Cas first walked into that barn. Even before then.
This had been one of the rare nights where all four of them were in the bunker together. Dean had made corn on the cob and pork chops for dinner because he got a new recipe from Kathy at kansasmama.com that didn’t look half-bad. Cas was grey and worn sitting at the table, listening to Dean and Jack chatter with very little commentary. If Cas hadn’t moved occasionally, Dean might have tried to do chest compressions.
“Dean,” Cas says. It’s 2:35 am, according to the blinking green numbers on their stove. “Dean?”
Cas puts it on the counter, next to his new kettle.
“Sure you’ll be fine. I’m talking about me, you diva,” Dean says, nudging his arm. “I want some R&R. I was talking to Sam, he wants some too. Apparently SHIELD’s had him doing archive work since he was unfrozen. It sounds friggin’ awful.”
It’s been a month since Costco. They had not seen each other fully naked. Cas had been excited to get to that point, even though he has seen everything before. There’s a difference between seeing something passively and seeing it because someone loved you enough to show it, that they bare their belly to you. That they hand you a sword and trust you not to do it.
Dean grunts and wipes his sweaty hands on his shirt, a prized Goodwill find that has the ACDC insignia on it. The shirt is one from his line of experiments with wearing only one layer when he’s at home, an experiment that makes Cas feel incredibly sad somehow. Cas can’t put his finger on why. Maybe it’s because Dean’s forearms are crisscrossed with scars and blood blisters now that Cas can’t heal him. All the hair on his right arm was singed off about a week ago while burning bones. Dean likes the feeling. Being permanent in this body. Likes feeling the pain when he’s pinched.
“Go to town, buddy. Let Cas try one of everything first though, you junkyard dog. Don’t go finishing off my mozzarella sticks,” Dean says, pointing a warning finger at him. Sam puts his hands up in surrender and delicately scoots the plate closer to himself, dipping a stick into marinara sauce and biting it in half.
Dean sighs. “Always saving me. One day, I’ll return the favor if you’ll let me. You know, I’m kinda good at it.”
The smell of a good apple pie baking should permeate throughout the entire house, like from a childhood memory you’re not sure you actually had. You will sit at that table, wondering if you did it right. If your family will love it still if you mess up. You will wonder if the pie’s delicate lattices are intact after all this time, if what you promised will never come to fruition. You’ll wonder if it is the best you could do, and you will wonder if it is not enough.
So he cannot say it. He tries, but it rings hollow. But someday he will place a hand on Dean’s jaw, and Dean will understand. He hopes so. He’s never hoped for anything more.
Cas makes a lot of his friends by accident. He is usually just standing in line or sitting at a table and suddenly someone wants to help him with something or offers him a drink or wants to know where the nearest 7-Eleven is. Dean and Sam usually watch unhelpfully as he sputters. Now that he’s not an angel anymore, he rarely knows left from right, let alone where the closest barbershop is or what wine goes well with pork loin.
Stupefied, Cas nods. His heart monitor is going crazy, which finally gets the attention of Sam and the doctor. The doctor seems to snap out of his trance, and he pushes Sam’s hand away as he wipes his face and blows his nose.
“Hell, do gay bars have karaoke night?” Dean says. “You and me and Sam and Jack. A regular barbershop quartet.”
“Already got it. Said when? Earlier? Yeah, we can get hotdogs before we go.”
“Cas, baby,” Dean says, and Cas hums in response, lulled by Dean’s soft tone. Dean presses his hands and the mixing bowl against Cas’ arms and they stand there, silently swaying, Cas breathing wetly on the collar of Dean’s ACDC shirt.
“Isn’t it just,” Jody says, smiling. “Cas, you too. Dean told me about your homecoming.”
This kiss feels like it was born out of a pile of their shared bones in their future grave, so cradled together that you couldn’t separate them if you tried. A forever sort of thing, Dean thinks. He thinks if Cas was still an angel he’d make all the bulbs in Kansas shatter. Does Cas miss that? Shattering lights like it’s nothing?
"Gimme Shelter" is the first song that comes plunking out, and Cas leans over to turn it up, brushing close to Dean’s arm as he does so.
“Clothes?” Dean tries. His hands are slowly sliding down the wheel, not of their own volition.
“Sorry,” Cas mutters, readjusting his hands in his pockets.
What?
“Gay bar,” Dean says. It’s the first thing he’s said since they left the bunker. Cas looks at him, considering. Dean clears his throat. “It’s, uh, a gay bar. Maybe it's a half-off night.”
He kinda wants Cas to back up and find an alley somewhere, but they’re meeting Jack and Sam and Eileen here, and they’re already ten minutes late.
“You had nowhere else to go,” Dean reminds him. “It was the Walking Dead out there, what were you supposed to do? Jump ship? Nah, you were stuck in a bear trap. I probably didn’t even let you out to piss.”
Ask Cas to paint you a portrait of a man in love and he will tell you he is not a good painter, but the way Dean put on his nicest shirt for Claire and how Dean tries to include Jack in every conversation, even haltingly, even when it’s not familiar, makes Cas understand Romeo and Juliet, and Orpheus and Eurydice, and Bonnie and Clyde. He will tell you about Dean’s comforting hand on his thigh when young women flirt with him in bars, and he will tell you, at length, about the way Dean looks in this bathroom light, the sharp angles of his face well-worn and soft.
Castiel’s next frontier of memorization is all of the stock of the stores in Lebanon. He spends days just looking at the various labels in the little grocery store, the one down the street from the bank. He goes several days in a row, so much and for so long that the employees usually stop asking if he needs help.
“Dean,” Cas starts, sounding like a speech he’s rehearsed, like it’s step one in his twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. The silence bends to him. “I am sorry I haven’t been more forthcoming with what I’ve been up to.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean says. He hesitates a second, scratching his denim-covered thigh. “Do you remember Cassie Robinson?”
They segment out into groups quickly. Claire and Dean disappear outside to start their routine fight over control of the grill, and history suggests that Claire will win. Kaia and Jack group together to talk about a show they both enjoy, one that Jack has tried futilely to explain to both Cas and Dean a dozen times to no avail, and Sam puts Kaia’s cauliflower into the air fryer that Cas got him for his birthday and is eagerly showing all of its capabilities to Jody. Jody ooos and ahhs at the specified times, and catches Cas’ eye for a second and gestures to the next room. Cas nods and follows her out. Sam goes to join Kaia and Jack’s conversation about… some sort of serpent? Cas isn’t sure.
Dean gently closes the door behind him and sits in the opposite armchair from Cas, looking troubled. Cas prepares himself for a talk. Their mornings have been a little stilted lately. Cas watches Dean and then Dean turns to watch Cas and then they both turn away. There’s always been a tension between them, but it’s reached a fever point.
“Cas, it’s me,” Dean says impatiently. Is this a trick? Cas looks down at himself and sees that he has a tangible body again, which is a good sign. It’s also completely naked, which also points to this not being a fabrication. He doesn’t think he took just his coat off more than four times in the last four years. “Cas, we gotta go.”
Soon enough, the quest for memorization extends to places outside the Bunker.
Shit.
Dean nods along and flexes his aching wrists. Dean is doing a pretty good job for a first-timer, he thinks. He gears up with Ol’ Pinkie and goes to try his Between-The-Legs technique, but there’s a hand on his back that stops him.
Cas nods next to him. Dean could move his leg two inches to the right and be touching Cas’ knee. He does. Cas lets him.
says the elephant in the room. Dean sighs, and gets up to put on some better pants to fry some chicken in.
“I know you and Sam like to have your own space, and Jack and I don’t want to intrude, but being here is going to make us the happiest,” Cas says. He peeks at Dean’s face for a second before looking in another direction.
Cas wants that, and he can’t have that. What’s new.
The man answers whoever is on the other side of the phone with a short, “Understood.” He’s facing away from where Castiel is standing, looking through something. Castiel’s wallet perhaps. His books.
“She texts me about my day,” Cas says simply. He looks at Dean now. “It is nice.”
Dean bounces on his heels and “WOO!”s loud enough for the moms to look their way for a moment. If this is a shifter, then the shifter will just have to let him have this for a few minutes. Cas watches him with amusement, his arms crossed across his chest.
They just look at each other for a second. Two old men in young men's bodies, in a time that wasn’t supposed to be theirs. Dean should’ve been married by now, working hard on a farm in Kansas. Cas should’ve-
Anyway, Castiel can count the times he’s been truly happy on one hand. One of these occasions was meeting Jack for the first time, even though he was older and looked more like Jimmy than he expected. Another one was cracking his head out of the ground and breathing in the smell of warm dirt and sunlight after the Empty let him go. Another one was when he was in the Impala and wearing a cowboy hat and D
The man looks out of place next to his tea towel. He’s hunching his shoulders in his big dark suit, like he’s trying to disappear. The man hasn’t noticed him yet, but Castiel thinks he must be aware. Castiel has been bred to be quiet, but not quiet enough for who he thinks this is.
, Cas fills in the blank. His mind races for potential places to stay. Garth Fitzgerald was always nice to him in the Avengers tower, whenever he wasn’t ten feet tall and green. Anna Milton didn’t look disgusted by him when she met the real, non-asset version of him, and she and Dean had some easy camaraderie that might translate into pity for his circumstance. He even thinks he recognizes her, somewhere deep in his brain. A target or an accomplice or both, back in his inhuman days.
“You have to know, Cas,” Dean says, desperately. The shopping cart handle is biting into his stomach. “You have to know that I -.”
He sets up a plan. He stays in the bunker at night to memorize every inch of it; the uneven cracks of the concrete walls, the old smell of books and corroded metal. He palms every uneven and mismatched utensil in the drawers of the kitchen and runs his fingers over the wood grain of their kitchen table until he’s sure he’s committed all of it to memory. And it goes on and on like this until he is sure he could draw a map of it, the place where he used to live.
There’s a pause as they sit in their silence, familiar as a limb.
Sam sits back and watches Dean monologue to himself about ungrateful brothers, stomping to the fridge to get himself a beer before he comes back to the table, arms crossing close to his chest. His beer leaves a condensation mark on his now-thoroughly soiled shirt. He takes a second to rip off the cap and knock it back before wiping his mouth.
Castiel memorizes all this too; the motion of Dean’s Adam’s apple against the skin of his throat, the worn-in thyme and amber from his cologne, his hair limp and devoid of the gel he uses.
“You text Jody, but not me?” Dean says, affronted. Usually he just suffers his jealousy in silence, but his tongue has been loosened by ten or twelve Sour Patch Kids and a nice evening.
“Okay,” Castiel whispers.He shifts his stance so his lower half is not so pressed against Dean's.
DOLL’S SALOON, it says in bright neon lights. Cas watches it carefully as they crawl past, stuck in the middle of Ubers and party busses.
Cas nods.
Cas wasn’t in the room with them often.
“Just that you’re back, buddy,” Jody says, smiling. “Can I talk to you a little bit later?” she asks, looking out of the corner of her eye toward Claire. Cas gets her meaning.
“I’ve come to the decision that I need to put myself first occasionally, and I’ve talked at length to Sam about this and he agrees. I just want to know your perspective, as your opinion is quite important to me,” Cas continues. He’s now looking at a spot just over Dean’s shoulder. Probably Dean’s poster of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly if he had to guess.
No. He cannot think about that. He steels himself and lets Dean take a step back.
“Of course,” Cas says. His hands are creeping into his pockets again.
The carrier starts shattering into pieces around them. The asset is ready to die, The asset shakes his head. His head hurts, probably because he got punched a hundred times by a super soldier. He feels like he should be hurting him back, so the asset tries. He tries balling his fist, he tries to bring it down, he tries -
