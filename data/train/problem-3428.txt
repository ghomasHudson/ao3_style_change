“Well then, might as well get to it then, the reason I came.” Crowley said, bringing a new aura into the room of pure business.
!” Dean moaned after a sharp gasp as he felt the tension release from his body into a fountain of come. He released the grip of his cock squirting up against his stomach and pushed his head backwards hard, quickly wiping off the sweat pearling on his forehead down to his lips where he clasped his hand to silence his moans from his ongoing orgasm.
But it didn’t matter what he was feeling. This was his fault and therefore his responsibility to fix, a promise made at that. Despite the fact that he wanted to get away he couldn’t let himself coward anymore. He could no longer allow himself to hide behind the paralyzing pity and anxiety, so very safe in a way. Allowing his vessel’s nails and stubble to grow out of proportion just because he was busy feeling sorry for himself. It wasn’t productive, it was debilitating and pathetic. It wasn’t him. He was an angel with the rank of a seraph, perhaps even with powers such as an archangel at this point- when having his grace.
Cas blinked at him, silently. He didn’t want to think about it because it still filled him with one of the most uncomfortable emotion he knew of:
He wondered what Cas’s orgasmic cock spasms would feel like elsewhere, and it flooded his brain in ways that removed every other thoughts –
And Castiel had no clue just how awful nightmares could be. How one’s own ghosts residing inside the mind could manage to achieve such despair that still haunted him now in his waking hours.
you want if you’ll be my side bitch in hell. This is the Era of Dean Winchester doing the fuck he wants!” Crowley went on enthusiastically and the fire in the demon’s voice did tickle Dean’s mind, even enough to forget about Cain for a second.
Dean closed the door, but kept his back turned on the angel, one hand resting on the door frame and the other massaged between his eyebrows.
” Cas now whimpered, eying down flushed at him with that damn jizz dribble on the corner of his mouth. Looking like a damn snack. Dean could see the pleasure on his face, but it was not only that. His eyes were pleading and comfort-seeking, so Dean hummed softly and stroked his thigh and stomach slowly and smoothly. Wanting him to feel good and relaxed this time- not frightened, to actually enjoy the build up.
Castiel stopped walking as his fingers traced over Dean’s door frame. It was open and the room seemingly untouched except the fact that Sam had forgotten to close the drawer where he had taken the clothes that Castiel wore at this moment. He hesitated, but entered the room, figuring that he might as well close the drawer.
Fuck- you gotta get off me dude!” He squeezed out as he pressed his head back against his pillow and pushing down on Castiel’s shoulders, trying to nudge him away but the angel felt like heavy cement against Dean’s trembling arms. If anything, moving him only edged him further down into the pit of no freaking return. Dangerous friction rubbing down on him.
And Dean didn’t even correct that thought because he was too freaking overstimulated to notice. Every suck and lick on his poor cock felt like a painful tickle and had him crying into the air. Being sucked in the refraction period was cruel, so cruel. But before Dean knew it his ailing moans turned from mad to rad. He could feel it turning around, like Cas was boosting the cooldown in some weird way with his mouth on his cock. Sucking him from pain to pleasure like gluttonous beast and humming satisfied which sent vibrations tickling his merrow.
“Interesting to see how you’ll pull that one off.” Sam snorted. “You know the bunker is warded. You can’t even enter, so you might as well forget about it and tell us where the hell Dean is.” Sam said, pulling out his gun and aiming it right at the king of hell, ready to pull the trigger on instinct should he see the slightest twitch at the demon.
He had spent the last few days working off Crowley’s contracts, killing assholes and collecting their souls for Crowley’s taking. It was easier than he had imagined it to be, actually feeling some sort of fulfillment of his blood thirst. But that was just it. While he found that it fed one part of his demonic desires, it didn’t actually fulfill the other. Just as Cain -
“I might have been a little overwhelmed initially… This with you… You overwhelm me Dean,” He grinded, so smooth against their wet stomachs- as in belly dance stripper smooth. “Your body… The taste of you…” He groaned with another slow hump that lured out pleasured noises from Dean’s mouth. “
“Let’s just say I had the time to get creative.” Dean said, which was true. He had been torturing damned souls for years in hell and then spent another unknown years in purgatory where he had the same luxury. Something he admittedly, but shamefully, found himself wanting to do. But It wasn’t something he was proud of as a human, not at the slightest. It had weighed on him greatly with guilt over how much he wanted to do it. To inflict pain on those ungrateful souls who had a chance of an honest and good life, such as the man dangling from the roof. They had all thrown it away, whether it was through the acts of selling off their souls, or choosing to murder or abuse others instead of cherishing the simplicity of life,
The angel mouthed sloppily at his chest, but that was an impossible request, especially feeling those lips on his skin. If anything, it was Dean that needed saving,
“Yeah, whatever. Cas is full of bullshit double standard.” Dean snorted as he thought of the moment after Castiel had come back from purgatory, how Dean had put down all of his efforts to save him and get him the hell out of there. Cas was important to him, he was family. And because of that he had spent weeks feeling guilty, ruminating over when he had lost the grip of his hand just before they were sucked back into earth. But Cas, well apparently he just didn’t want to be saved. The angel had shown him that. He had wanted to stay, to be punished for the messed-up things he had done up until that point. Even Dean Winchester could see that Castiel suffered as he came back, and he did ask; Why Cas wouldn’t go up to heaven.
“It’s all fine Cas. Hell, I’m a little dirty myself right now too.” Oh, if Cas only knew - Dean thought as he pulled his cock out from his underwear to pump it, slowly but firm. Thinking of all the ways he could make the angel messy. How he’d tongue trails of saliva on his body, how he’d have him sweat so much that his dark hair would stick to his forehead, how he’d dazzle his chest with a streaks of come and claim him as his own.
But that would mean a life without Sam, which basically had been his whole life up until this point. Making sure that he was okay and safe like an overprotective dragon guarding his most valuable treasure. There was never a question about what he himself wanted, or ‘doing the fuck he wants’ as Crowley had delicately worded. His life was ruled by John’s words imprinted in his mind;
“Cas that’s- why would I be angry about that? That’s amazing!” Sam radiated but soon stopped when Castiel adverted his gaze again. “…Why isn’t he here?”
Then Castiel stepped on that damned bottle again and this time he slipped. He went crashing down on all the plastic bags he had avoided stepping on and tipping over a small table as he had flailed his arms trying to get a grip on something. The thumping on the door stopped, just as Castiel’s breathing for a moment.
Seeing the demon made Castiel forget everything about his morning and of Sam’s recent grin. Instead, it just brought him straight back to their last encounter in the woods.
He felt a strong want to approach him, and his mind was already two steps ahead. But when Castiel was to initiate the task of motioning his feet forward to Dean, he found himself dumbfounded. They didn’t move. Castiel stared down at his feet. Everything was there and intact but for some reason his legs were too afraid to move. It felt as if the earth was in the process of swallowing them, gulping him down into invisible quicksand - or as if his legs simply didn’t exist at all. He was paralyzed.
Dean heard a sharp inhale and felt a last jerk before Castiel rendered completely rigid, squeezing harder and harder at Dean’s arms through each passing second he held his breath. The angel stretched his neck, mouth brushing past Dean’s earlobes which sent bliss straight into his brain.
“You’re having an orgasm, Cas. Chill. Just freaking breathe, okay?” Dean basically sobbed himself both wanting to flee, wake up, move to another planet and never return. But also sobbing at how great it felt to hear the angel’s frightened pleasure, it was exhilarating in a sick sadistic way, perhaps even honorable to be experience this sensation with him. “You’ll be ‘aight, just let it happen. It’ll be over soon.” He tried to comfort him as he palmed the back of Cas’ head, the poor angel had probably never…
Whether it was all the money Crowley and he had spent on gambling and boozing, or the newly found demonic confidence… or the exotic mating dance and horrible flirting that made Barbie fine with her nickname was left unknown. It didn’t matter to Dean, because either way they wound up doing it dirty in the bathroom,
But Cas was purring as if being inside a whole other dimension, pressing his body so tight against Dean’s and rubbing his cock up against his naval in sticky motions. And Cas was moaning so happy and horny,
But Dean didn’t get frightened of the sight, if anything he felt a warmth to his heart which made it beat just a little harder.
. Because in this moment he felt his body go rigid, toes turning like a ballerina dancing, and his body tickled as if every single one of his limbs needed to sneeze.
take a shower. You still remember from when Dean taught you right?” Sam said in a careful manner as if not wanting to hurt Castiel. But he was simply stating another obvious fact. Castiel knew that he was in dire need of a thorough cleansing.
Dean moaned, both because of Castiel grinding him good, and at his assertion. “You mean, we can’t do nothing else but this?” Dean asked with a smirk and cupped Castiel’s cheeks to pull him down into a kiss again, in which they both hummed into each other’s throats. Cas relaxed his whole weight on Dean as he kissed back, sliding his arms underneath Dean’s armpits, and just holding him. Holding Dean so tight. It sent flocks of small earthquakes down his body whenever he felt Castiel’s strength, and Dean squeezed at the muscles on Cas’s shoulder just to amplify the Richter scale.
Dean growled and stole his feet back from under Cas to tug at the angel’s arms. He swiftly pushed him down on the bed and earned himself a surprised yelp from the angel at his eagerness. He was mad with desire, balls hurting and -
“But I thought-“ Dean tried asking but found himself interrupted by Castiel’s fingers stealing smooth touches on his skin. He looked like a lucid drunk, struggling even more with personal space than Dean thought it possible… and it was distracting to say the least. “Hey! You gotta get a grip and listen, man. You
“Moose, Sparkles. How do you do?” Crowley grinned. He was standing a few feet away from the door as if he had been waiting there all morning. Hands locked together in front of his stomach.
Dean stopped munching for a moment. He really wasn’t feeling like telling Crowley about his Castiel-situation. He didn’t understand why the king of hell seemed to be so persistent tonight either, or looking extra bitchy with his pink drink garnished by a small umbrella.
Dean proceeded with his shower, turned the water off and stepped outside only now realizing the steam inside the bathroom. Opening the door was like a tsunami of cold and refreshing air hitting him as the warm mist escaped. Dean tied the towel against his waist, water still dripping from his hair down on to the floor as he walked out. A knocking was heard at the door shortly after and he opened it with an empty mind still floating from his shower revelation.
“Cheers Bobby.” He said and raised the bottle in the air, into the empty room and took a few swigs. He leaned backwards on the unmade bed, pillows propping up his back against the wall. Fingers tapping on the outside of his pockets where his new phone was. Wondering what Bobby's soul was doing… and what Sam was doing, perhaps even what Crowley was doing – and
“I have masturbated.” Castiel said with frustration, as if he had been sure it would solve his problem. Dean clenched his fist on the door.
“Fuck this. You suck Crowley, I’m out.” Dean said and pushed the table out of his way, hoping that it would tip over Crowley’s silly umbrella drink, and he snorted as it didn’t. He could hear the king of hell call after him as he left, but he wasn’t having it anymore. It was unacceptable to actually be so put off that he now wasted a perfectly good sandwich. It was blasphemy to leave a delicious snack left uneaten according to the Dean Winchester bible. He didn’t even get to finish his damn beer.
Before Dean could even open his eyes and reprimand the stalking angel, he felt Castiel’s tongue all over his body. Feeling completely ambushed, he stared down and released the weakest and most trembling yelp he’s ever squeezed out, seeing and feeling Castiel lick his cock and torso free from his semen. He should push him away, but his arms were too weak by the hot and wet sensation of the angel’s tongue. Cas was cleaning him up like a hungry animal, the begging dog finally getting his treat. All Dean could do was to grapple at Castiel’s messy hair and wheeze at each lick. “C-Cas! D-Damn it, y-you can’t just sneak up on, ofh fuck be careful! T-there’s a cooldown rate-”
Cas had seen the insides of Dean’s wallet a few times, and there were more receipts sloppily tucked inside of beers and pies - than cash and cards. But then he realized that it was a memory of Dean being alive. Every single receipt inside the black leatherbound wallet had been placed there by Dean. All the small crevasses folded in the paper was made by him, tucking the paper inside the pockets with his fingers. It had a sentimental value, Castiel understood that now. He had never experienced grief like this before he had seen Dean die… before he knew that the curse would work.
It was a turn on that made Dean moan a shaky voice-wobble, and that in turn made Castiel edge into a full hump-frenzy. Mouthfucking Dean as if he was an object with no boundaries, merely a tool used to get from point A to point B, and it felt so fucking great that he had to stroke his damn dick again while fighting back the gag reflexes.
Dean took another breath, going back to his original question, “I thought cupids were third-class angels, so how come you’re affected? Aren’t you supposed to be a falcon punch Seraph or whatever?” Dean hugged the bedsheets closer to himself, trying to get some sort of barrier between him and Cas…and also some dignity.
So he sat up too, draping the bedsheet over his crotch to make both of them comfortable. He scratched the back of his hair in a shy manor, a concerned furrow plastered his face. “S-so,” he coughed to clear his hoarse throat,
So there he was with handsy Cas exploring the crevices of his laugh lines around the eyes. As long as it wasn’t Castiel’s right hand that would be touching him… which is
Dean shut his eyes, feeling his release unload into him. His whole body throbbed as the heat-wave amplified with each thrust he mindlessly rammed at him. Biting down on curve of Castiel’s neck, skin tan and undefinable yearning. As if designed just for Dean to have his nose nuzzled into, to breathe in and fulfill his human desires amplified with demonic drunkenness, just like Cain said. Only it didn’t smell like Castiel at all.
It seemed pretty straight forward, unlike poker where you had to remember what a good hand was and not. After a while he did get the hang of it. Though it was difficult at times. Once he was told to make his eyes glow and imitate a white walker from Game of thrones. Acting was not his strongest suit.
Sam said and folded his laptop shut, probably noting the dark circles forming under Castiel’s eyes. The Winchester looked exhausted too, which wasn’t odd. He had been driving all day and now the clock was soon past 2 am. “Time to hit the sack anyway. Just pick any bedroom, okay?”
It was decided, Dean knew exactly where he was going. To Kansas, Lebanon. Once and for all he would prove to himself that what his mind was implying, the whole Cas-addiction-abstinence-thing, was utter and complete nonsense. He was in control, not the curse and absolutely no demonic greed. Killing off victims on Crowley’s contracts didn’t help as much as he wished it would, but he hadn’t tried getting the blade yet. He hadn’t dared to because that would mean actually meeting up with Castiel. An encounter that he feared would shake him to his core even if he was levitating in zero gravity.
He finally tugged Castiel’s pants down and felt the burning hot wood slick and slippery at his stomach. It made Dean gasp, and that’s when Castiel just delved his tongue right into his open mouth with a primal groan. Thrusting his cock against Dean’s stomach and squeezing at Dean’s hips to pull him closer against every motion.
Castiel observed Sam slowly placing his beer bottle down on the table with his eyes locked on the computer screen. His formerly happy appearance had turned into an evident frown on his forehead which had Castiel worried. He hadn’t meant for him to get upset but understood that it was inevitable. Although, he didn’t know how Sam would react to this, whether he would be thrilled or angry. He seemed to be neither of them however, just plain sad.
Dean blinked at Sam, then he glanced over his shoulder to Cas who stared at him in his usual manner. Dean squinted at him, and Cas shrugged a
Crowley squinted at him in a quiet manor, as if fascinated and trying to figure out the source of his sudden change of character. It wasn’t odd, since this wasn’t Dean being overprotective like he always had been before, it was him stating his claim.
… a thought flashed his mind. This was a chance for him to not allow shit happening to him, but a chance for him to cause shit to happen at the power of his own hands. He was a knight of hell, he was Cain 2.0 for all he knew. And demons take what they want. His hand had in a way become powerful, a feeling that was estrange to him and made him look at it. Clenching his fist, opening the fingers back up as the warm water dashed down on his knuckles. He did like that feeling, it was a good one...
, but it hurt in the most fantastic way Dean had ever experienced. It was just as he had imagined it to be if not even better. The strength of his embrace mashed up with the rough thrusts- it made him feel complete, out of control at this seraph’s verdict.
“Ahah, Kay then! I’ll fucking kill everyone on this damn list. Then you’ll be gone- cus’ you’re jackshit and your twisted words are jackshit too!” Dean cursed out in the void, listening to his words, they were real. Real as the blood he was going to spill the next couple of days, proving to Cain that he was wrong. He’d kill them and have the problem solved. Then he’d get that first blade back before it played any new cards of obsession in his mind.
“Ah, that’s delightful, truly is.” Crowley chuckled as he clapped his hands together. Castiel flinched at the smack which pulled him out of his cloud of thoughts. It seemed like the demon had gotten his answers. “It could be a good thing, you know... The whole lot of you could do with some time apart. Perhaps, take up on a hobby, get to know yourself, yoga on the beech etcetera…”
by the way.” Crowley mocked as if he couldn’t help himself. Dean glared at him, clearly not amused as the reference, and especially not now as he was experiencing an emotional turmoil between mountains and valleys.
Sam ran his thumbs slowly over the texture of the leathery wheel, his eyes focused on the distance behind the sweeping windshield as the rain scattered down in dancing speckles. Worry was written in his face. “I, uh..” Sam paused and gulped “I wonder how much of him is still Dean.”
Cas said like a sassy savage, and Dean would’ve laughed if it wasn’t for the last deep suck making his cock gush out come again without even having a second to breathe.
“Since when do you change clothes?” Dean chuckled in disbelief and put the phone on speaker mode on top of his chest. He propped one arm behind his head and relaxed his back against the pillow fully, getting himself more comfortable. Dean closed his eyes, picturing Cas being in front of him, blocking out any other sensory input other than his voice, his mind and the feel of himself rubbing and squeezing his dick.
When he turned his eyes to look at him, he saw the muscles of Sam’s jaw clench and relax repeatedly. Any time soon his patience would pop, and Castiel was prepared for it.
Dean didn’t want to look. Instead, he found himself staring at Castiel’s hand that he held. And he was kind of happy he did because the view actually made his nose crinkle. Feeling an emotion that wasn’t
Until he saw it, a light in the far distance burning at his soul, feeling so vibrant as it throbbed and pulsated before him. Growing closer,
?” Dean growled as his eyes fixed on Castiel touching himself underneath his shirt before unbuttoning the last pair of buttons. “Cas! C’mon, focus!” He barked despite finding it hard to focus himself. He needed an answer fast so that he could lock himself up inside that bathroom, although… what the hell is stopping him from doing that now? They could talk through the door couldn’t they?
Maybe, just maybe that was all he needed. Blood. To see twisted minds bleed and squirm as punishment for his injustice. A punishment for what has been denied him. How he wasn’t allowed to indulge in listening to
“Thank you for letting me borrow your razor. It proved itself very effective at removing stubble.” Castiel said as he approached Sam, feeling fairly good about himself… until he thought of the fact that Dean had actually called him. He should tell Sam about this, but he wasn’t sure how.
on the karaoke stage while showing off his most exotic dance moves like a mating ritual. The bartender had smiled at him and given him a pink drink on the house, perhaps she was happy that he was now in a better place in his mind. And well, that made Dean feel obliged to repay her, and he was inclined that the pay back was to be in
Hell had been following him ever since the angel pulled him up from his damnation. But maybe hell had been there even before that. It was the reason why Dean almost found his black eyes symbolic, just like a meaningful tattoo. The fiery pit had probably been a part of him all along since things in his life turned sour; and now he finally was showing his true self, what he had become after all years of torment. Someone filled with despise and jealousy even over the unfairness of his pitiful life. How people got to claim a life he couldn’t, or at least were provided a choice to live off the grid. The fucking injustice of being able to throw away chances that Dean only could dream of achieving in his own life.
“So, he just asked you what you were doing?” Sam asked again as if to really wrap his head around it. Although Castiel already had explained how the call had played out, he could understand why Sam wanted confirmation. It was weird.
He’d be immortal and eventually he’d lose Sam. Castiel wasn’t sure if Dean could walk the earth like that and still be Dean. It would be his own personal hell.
That was when they decided that it was time to call it a night. Dean still struggled with a human hang over and felt the need to sleep. Crowley had sent Guthrie, his favorite servant a call to pick them up and despite the fact that the king of hell was able to teleport his ass back to the hotel, he had insisted on staying. So now they wandered the streets together in wait, still high on how the night turned out to be.
“And that’s supposed to solve my whole, coocoo problem that you apparently know all about?” Dean asked, swirling his finger in circles with his temples, glancing up from the paper to eye at the devil.
“Never mind… So, um. What did he want?” Sam asked as he was fingering at his beer bottle, staring into it with his gaze lost in whatever went on inside his head.
Castiel stood paralyzed as he felt the words sink in, now alone in his isolation. This had been a fluke, a chaotic and stupid fluke. There was nothing else to do but cursing at himself for being imbecilic and how helpless he found himself to be. He couldn’t do anything to try and piece this shattered mess together.
He gulped, the whole experience had been crazy weird, just as when his mind had snapped before where he wanted to gut Crowley like Peppa the pig. Dean adverted his eyes from the demon as he suddenly realized that he was being analyzed by him. He searched for some way to play it off cool but his mind ran blank. He had been thinking so much and now he got nothing left. Then as if he couldn’t baffle Crowley any more he bent down to pick up a pair of socks from the floor for no apparent reason. Now just standing there in a towel, holding a pair of socks.
Suddenly the reality of his situation began to make itself clear in his mind and it made him feel sick. Crowley had just confirmed what he had feared. A draft of melancholy for his brother struck him. Sam had buried him, thought that he had lost him again. And that revelation ailed him with a deep pain to his brotherly heart. The emotions were back again and filled him with want to get back to his brother and tell him that he alive. That they’d be together and be a family again, that he’d take care of him as he always had and always would.
Dean shook his head, dropping it low and rubbed his uptight frown (with his free hand), trying to squeeze out the vision of Castiel using his semen as playdough. “…strength in numbers ain’t just one cherub, Cas. Don’t tell me you’ve managed to provoke the whole freaking love army.” Dean grumbled… before growling at Castiel, who was still trying to touch his face with that nasty hand.
“And that’s totally fine, Cas. I won’t push it. My door’s open though, if anything’s bothering you. I’m here to listen okay?” Sam reassured with one of those sweet and caring looks again.
Sam took a seat behind him, but spared him any looks. Instead, they both just sat there in silence for a while and observed the scratchy prints on the wallpaper, simply just breathing and digesting the situation that they both were in.
“You just going to stand there mute like Mini-me or start talking?” Dean snapped as Crowley hadn't answered his question yet.
. The stutter, so delicious and filled with guilt. It was so beautiful and arousing. How much he’d like to have Castiel whimpering in front of him, begging at him. To tease his skin until he’d cry and beg for Dean to finally massage that yearning out of him.
Impatiently he aligned himself above Cas’s slippery cock and nudged it at his hole – and fuck did Castiel’s sauna heat feel good on his ass… It forced out a breathy grunt from his throat. His ring muscle contracted at the touch, hyper-aware of every nerve ending being tickled by the angel’s cock. Dean let his body weight bob up and down to try out the waters.
But somehow he got through to Cas. In some damn way the angel had managed to listen despite not even being fully present. Cas’s grasp turned soft and tender against Dean’s length, slowly massaging the last dribbles of come out the slit of Dean’s dick, rubbing his thumb over the mess of his pink acorn. Purring in delight with low vibrations whenever he felt Dean twitch and sob from flicking the thumb.
Dean couldn’t manage to do anything but to give in and let his body do what it yearned for. He tilted his head and motioned it like a dance as he sloppily moved along with Castiel’s phase. The raw emotion of want spread through his body like a heat wave, just as when you walk outside on a hot summer day. He soon found it reaching down to his crotch area, he hadn’t noticed it before he felt it nudge against Castiel’s pants. The pressure against his bulge felt good, so good in fact that he couldn’t help himself to slip out a small moan.
’, feeling the warmth on his skin. Secondly the phrasing of that specific question was more of an implying nature as if the sun equaled nice weather, completely cutting out the fact that some do prefer rain.
"Yeah, It's just a kiss! You made me text my ex I still keep her bra... Next Dagorhir is going to be so awkward." Charlie sighed and slumped back. It had been an unfair move, Dean agreed. Of course, it would come back to bite him in the ass.
Castiel tore off Deans shoes and pants completely, leaving him semi nude on the bed with his cock supported on his t-shirt. Dean watched him carefully get on the bed, clenching the sheets below him tightly in his fists. He was bracing himself for what was to come, and he felt lightheaded just thinking about it. The slippery goods on Castiel’s fingers began rubbing at his entrance and Dean gasped for air feeling them pressing their way in. “Oh, god!”
- had told him. And that sucked. So much in fact that he had spent his last few days slipping back into old habits. Seeking out women every nigh just to sleep with. Because Dean didn’t want to be alone with his thought, he didn’t want to think about Cas or Cain – he needed to convince himself that it still wasn’t true, or at the very least; that it had no power on him.
“You cursed me!” Dean screamed and then he suddenly was there, face to face with Castiel, inches away from him. Dean’s hands tightly gripping at his shoulders, and he shook them like an earthquake as his fiery spit crashed at Castiel’s’ face.
Cas sucked his teeth in disapproval as Dean pushed him down the bed, probably from the lack of body contact and the abrupted kiss. “Mmno…” He whined and tried to prop himself up, but Dean wouldn’t allow it.
“Fine! but you don’t get to watch!” Dean snapped in determination. This was the moment he would prove to himself that it was all just some odd fantasy and nothing else. Charlie lit up; it was a compromise she was willing to agree to. Dean was now standing, motioning to Castiel to get up as well with his hand waving quickly in the air. He didn’t look at Castiel directly, but at the wall behind him.
the blood eagle? So savage. You really went there didn’t you Squirrel?” Crowley asked as he stepped inside the room. Dean found him tip-toing over the pools of blood to shield his newly polished shoes, a shadow motioning into his periphery field of vision.
“Have you even listened to one single thing I’ve been telling you?” Crowley scowled and frowned at him with some kind of superior impatience.
That’s what the angel figured at least as he nearly slipped on a plastic bottle somewhere in the mess.
kind of sigh. The angel was giving him a neglected pout, like a dog being refused a treat by the kitchen table. While that look itself planted bothersome images in Dean’s mind on how to get Cas a
Until he saw it, the outlines of a man, of Dean’s body. He let himself feel the tiniest rush of joy before smothering it with worry. He had arrived late which meant he had no time in rejoicing. Dean was alone out there as a newly fledged knight of hell, he had woken up alone which wasn’t something Castiel had planned to happen at all.
“And? Bloody hell Squirrel, stop seeing the glass half empty. Metatron’s gone, meaning, little moose and Sparkles are safe,
“He sends his regards by the way.” Crowley snorted as if to deliver the last blow to Castiel’s growing guilt. And then, with a snap of his finger, the king of hell was gone.
And that’s the story of how Dean sucked his first dick. A cherub’s spell, a filthy come-loving angel and a total of 4 shared ejaculations later, that was what it took to get over Dean’s
And Cas just kept pounding himself into a sweaty mess, and he was so beautiful doing so… skin glistening like he was Edward Cullen, and his eyes… they were glowing. And he purred and gasped in incoherent mumbles by each struggling moan Dean made as he stroked himself into bliss.
“That’s good, Cas. That itself is proof that he doesn’t hate you. I mean, either he called because he was drunk and bored, or he called because he was drunk and lonely. Which means that he’s still Dean.” Sam said and somehow seemed a little happy despite the initial reaction. His words were encouraging, and it did make sense in some ways, even Dean’s anger. Had he been fully demonized, then Castiel figured he wouldn’t be struggling the way he interpreted him to be. But then again, he couldn’t take much joy in the notion of causing Dean all that hurt which riddled his voice. Which is why he could only give Sam the smallest smile he could afford to fake.
Dean clasped his lips around the woman’s, letting his senses be conquered by her. The taste of strawberries from her lip calming him down like a warm embrace. Gripping at her thighs, at her stomach, taking in all of her. Letting himself belong to her just for the tiniest while, to sooth him. He didn’t want to be left alone again, not with this emotional turmoil. He needed her, for the same reason why he needed so many other of his mistresses. He needed to be vulnerable with someone and this was the only time he could allow it to be voiced. The yearning of being held and swayed which the boy within his heart cried for so often, always when he was alone, felt so alone. In this petty act of fucking - he satiated that need. It was the only thing he knew that would ease his internal seclusion, so dark and depressed.
“If you have not called to unveil your location, at least tell me if you are alright… Please. I’m so sorry Dean.” The silent and somber tone of his voice snapped him back to present again, and with a large gulp in his throat.
Then Dean felt the worst fucking squeeze around the head of his cock, suffocating the hell out of him in both spirit, body and soul – stealing away his orgasm like a sink being plugged just as the last bit of whirl would slurp down the drain. Unsatisfactory, not being able to hear the last bit of rumble… all meanwhile he could hear and see Castiel rumbling. He was grunting in pleasure, watching Dean quiver and shiver with dark eyes slowly blinking bright, and allowing himself to pump his dick into a spurting hot rain on Dean’s thighs and legs.
He understood the emotion Sam displayed; he felt the same despite not mirroring it. Metatron had claimed that his grace was destroyed, and he was actually quite shocked of learning that it wasn’t obliterated into nothing after the false god had performed the spell. The spell where Cas was cast down from heaven. It meant that he might not have to die after all in the end, because he didn’t want to survive on stolen grace from other angels. The action of stealing grace was one of the most despicable things an angel could do.
“Damn it Dean…” Sam muttered. “It doesn’t matter the way you do it, Cas. What’s important is getting the hair clean.” Castiel nodded at Sam’s instructions.
horny beast, able to explore Dean in calculated actions, actually learning what he liked and didn’t like. Though Dean would lie if he said he didn’t miss the purring.
Cas knew that the probability of Sam contracting rabies from the injury was highly unlikely and closing in on zero, but he could think of more than a million other microbes that could turn Sam’s wound into a festering infection.
Sequences of the conversation with Dean played back in his head. He really did try to understand the purpose of it all but he felt like he missed something. The conversation had been so trivial and simple. The term ‘small-talk’ was the only thing applicable which itself was an oddity, because Dean never phoned to just ‘talk’. He always wanted something.
once in a while?” Dean growled in the most annoyed fashion he could while shaking his head. He could feel Crowley’s gaze burn into his neck in silence. So he turned around, and sure enough the king of hell just stood there and judged him as if he was a puzzle missing a piece. It was uncomfortable on a whole new level, as if Crowley was the shrink all of a sudden, poking inside Dean’s brain.
There was suspicion in Sam’s voice, as if he could see through the shortcut Cas had made to deny complete honesty.
distracted.” Cas confessed, and he could finally see that the angel was feeling bothered by this too, shifting around his hips in discomfort.
With a deep grunt he pulled the device out and eyed it for a second, running his fingers over the buttons again and pressing at them with a curiosity. The one button made it open with a flick that startled him, revealing a tape inscribed with ‘
Dean downed the last of his beer and stretched his hands up in the air, releasing a little burp as he with great confidence said "Dare, c'mon. Show me what you got kid". He firmly placed the empty beer bottle on the floor, leaning forward towards Charlie and mirrored her smirk. There's nothing she could make him do that would be too difficult for him.
. Wide awake he flipped the heat back and relaxed with a relieved groan as the temperature went from arctic to tropical. It was nice, but not as nice as it should have been.
Dean swiftly fiddled his phone out of the pocket, hands trembling as he held it a short distance away from his face, eying the numbers and the screen. Each press at the buttons filling him up with adrenaline and anticipation. It was more potent than any whiskey, making him feel lightheaded and out of breath. He needed it. He needed Cas.
“Uh, huh. So, what? You want me to go all Bridget Jones, start writing my feelings until problem solved?” Dean snapped, not even thinking of the symbolism of how Cas in this case would be Mark, and Crowley Daniel, in some farfetched parable.
So, he found the red fabric sickening at first, but just as every other emotional dip and tip in his demon-life, he now found himself somewhere in the middle again. He wasn’t as bothered as he had been before when he snapped out of his killing spree, but he wasn’t being bat shit crazy either. It always surprised him whenever it happened, but it was actually something he loved about being a demon. Everything was suddenly okay, whereas human-Dean would torture himself mentally. His self sabotage frenzy before would usually end with Sam either finding him passed out on the bed with a hangover to show it… or beaten into a pulp from deliberately aggravating some drunk dude. Back then he'd chase being a punching bag because he wanted the pain, and he also wanted Sam to be dissapointed in him.
He found himself in a moment of human clarity, sincerely unwelcome since it mostly meant feeling like shit ever since he had resurrected. Hearing the mention of Cas made him feel hurtful, angry, betrayed, and most of all; weird in a way that frightened him. The winning emotion now however was betrayal as his memories drifted away at last year.
“Yes, Cas. I am. I mean, I woke up and you were gone and then I found that text...” Sam took a deep breath and turned himself towards Castiel whose body had grown tenser at his scolding. He just waited and prepared for being cursed at, to hear how much Sam hated him. “And I’ve been really worried about you…
Dean couldn’t help but to grin, because there it was again, the welcomed muffle on his emotions. Just the feeling of the blade pressing, the freeing tension of his skin opening but no pain. The most delicious drug that only left him with a thrilling want and a salivating mouth. Fuck Sam, fuck John, fuck everything about their name and of course, last but not least; fuck the double C’s pestering his mind! Cas and Cain. Boy did that feel like a weight of his shoulder.
“Creative, sure, of course. But this is far above anything you’ve done before.” Crowley stated after a moment of silence. “I mean, again… The bloody blood eagle? Haven’t seen that one in a while…
but it was one of the few luxuries provided by living on borrowed grace. He was borderline human and the less power he had, the more he felt human needs… such as - in this case - sleep.
Then he pressed at three more other buttons that appeared to do nothing. The last button however made static noises exit the headphones. Castiel adjusted them to his head and could hear the music play into his ears like a lullaby. A calm guitar was playing, and he found himself adrift as the man began singing. Something about a lady buying a stairway to heaven.
. His hands grappled at the cold surface below him, feeding the need to anchor himself in anything and everything he could get a hold off. To feel something real, whatever real was, he found that he didn’t remember. But something was different, that much he knew. He felt awfully cold both inside and outside. At least the latter had an explanation.
He whispered as his cock pulsated with increased blood flow, every damn throb made him more and more hard. And he couldn’t think. Didn’t even notice how Cas hadn’t even chased after him or how quiet the angel was on the opposite side of the door.
He squeezed at his balls, fondling them as if wanting to aid the approaching fire building up in his dick. Thinking so hard on Castiel’s body, his tan and fit body, his hands touching him and rubbing him wet. His dick flopping and slapping Dean’s face with come, His cock against his own, his cock inside him and vice versa. Oh, he wanted it, needed it, it felt so good to want it.
“Fucking great, ain't that perfect! Y-you... You just took away my chances of dying a human. Did you ever stop to think about that? O-or that maybe I didn’t want to be saved? Hell, you of all should know what that’s like.” Dean’s words were bitter, his mind drifting away at purgatory. The selfishness of the angel had wrath building up in his chest and sting at his blackened heart. The voice no longer beautiful to his ear, but only causing him rage. Another type of hunger screaming to be fed. Something that would still the boiling blood in his veins. He wanted to kill again, kill more scum like Professor White on Crowley’s contracts and he needed it now.
“No Cas, it’s okay. He would’ve hung up.” Sam said in a way to insure Castiel that it wasn’t him he was hurt by, but it was something Cas only could interpret as a half-truth at the least. “I just… I’ve spent days and nights with all of this,” He said gesticulating his hands at all of his research. ” and he’s… Sure he’s a demon but he’s still my brother. I’ve put down this much energy and he still hasn’t gotten in touch with me.” Sam sighed and shook his head as if what he felt right now didn’t matter.
Dean stood stationary, letting the shock drop, grounding himself on the grass between his toes as trickles of rain started falling on his face. Not knowing if he should follow the demon or not as the reality began to sink deep down into his gut like a rock.
“Oh, Cas… by the way.” Sam said as if he just realized something important, but his voice seemed a little concerned for some reason.
Meanwhile Dean’s inner conflict distracted him, the angel scooted himself closer and closer with flared nostrils, appearing pleased and content. “
He was jealous that they actually had a choice, whereas he himself was forced into a life he had no control over. It was not that he enjoyed the torture or the need to punish, it was more so the fact that his emotional intelligence was that of a three-year old’s. He hadn’t learned how to properly deal with setbacks or feelings
“By the way Cas. I found this note in your coat before loading the laundry machine. Thought you might want it. It’s uh… In enochian so I guessed it might be important?” Sam said as he pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and lent it to him.
“Got a problem with my work ethics?” Dean’s voice was deep in his throat, already feeling agitated enough by Crowley’s presence. He didn’t want to listen to the exaggerated sway in the demon’s voice.
Cas eventually said as he froze on top of Dean. And well, that was not enochian gibberish, which Dean kind of found himself preferring now. He didn’t know how to face him,
“You are being silly…” Castiel answered at Dean’s recent thought, palming at Dean’s body in calming strokes, showing appreciation that he didn’t really want to appreciate right now. He’d rather want to run away.
“So uh… You want me to kill… Professor White who was dealt 10 years in order to… get away with soliciting his student.” Dean felt disgusting reading that last part, but despite fantasizing about this moments ago he felt a knot grow in his stomach, two sides clashing at each other, demon Dean vs human Dean. As much as Professor White deserved whatever thing that was coming to him, he still wasn’t a supernatural creature. But then again the dude was practically an incubus.
. Curiously, he sat down on the chair closest to him and grabbed the paper from Sam and slowly read “Bransg c qew madriax. dorpha lap g lansh maasi g a salman c iadnah…” out loud.
sorry?” It was a weird and involuntary emphasis on the word ‘just’ which he hoped that Sam wouldn’t catch. He knew that Castiel wouldn’t.
He put the bottle down with a firm thud, frustrated over that the alcohol didn’t sanitize his taste-buds. The beer barely did anything really. As a demon, he found his tolerance to getting drunk even higher than it was before, and human Dean could drink loads in by himself. This was his eight beer and he just now started to feel a mellow buzz. He regretted that he hadn’t ordered something stronger already; but Crowley had left him here at the bar for hours and at least beer was an activity he found soothing even if it didn’t get him drunk. To sip slowly on the noose of the bottle and teeth down at the glass every now and then. Guess it was his way of being mindful, and that makes him kind of into mental balance,
“Dean!” He heard echoing and he swiftly spun around on a startle, trying to figure out where the voice came from. But his eyes widened as he realized -
Castiel shifted himself on the bed with a grunt. It had been the first time in 24 hours that he changed his position and it felt absolutely exhausting –
The angel turned around, swiftly putting on his trench coat and prepared to leave at that. Dean groaned at the inadequate understanding of ‘what to do and what not to do in public’, the something he usually found hilarious to tease- now it had come back to bite him in the ass. “…You’re looking like a damn weenie waver…” He breathed, but thankful that it was at least dark outside so not too many people would see him dressed as a perverted flasher.
Dean felt his heartbeat convert into improvised jazz as Cas just nibbled and kissed him sloppy, purring and cooing and just running his hands all over Dean’s body before tugging his arms close around him. Sometimes being run over by a compulsion that made him squeeze Dean’s body even tighter than he thought possible.
Castiel turned his head up towards Dean and he looked at him for a tiny while before asking “Truth or dare?”
Sounding so fragile all of a sudden, as if he was made of porcelain, or having his Achilles heel stabbed.
, the moments before your impending orgasm… it is,” Cas paused. “…It’s looks more divine than heaven itself.”
He growled and groaned into his neck desperately, the volume only increasing as the time passed and the more he rubbed himself against Dean… and the more Dean rubbed himself against Cas.
“The only interest I have is locating and bringing him with me. Not to idle with you. Again, where is he?” His patient started to diminish at Crowley’s ridicule. Sure, he couldn’t kill him, but that didn’t mean that he would let him slither his way out of this situation unharmed. The price of humiliation and disrespect was piling up and filling to the brim and he would make sure the payment would be satisfied.
“…Y-you back?” Dean asked carefully and afraid of the answer, hoping that neither him nor Castiel would be driven insane again by lewd salaciousness. He was so tired, and his cock was aching.
“…I don’t hate you Cas. And I promise, neither does Dean.” Sam said, the calmness in his voice felt welcome to Castiel’s ear. Though he felt reluctant to actually believe it, eying down at the first blade snuggly tucked in its old cloth beside them on the table.
The whole room seemed to be set on pause for a second. Cas stared at his fingers, then he stared at Dean. He seemed tense, like he wanted to-
“Help how?” Castiel plainly answered. Dean flung his head back and groaned. To think Cas would be so stupid despite kissing him like that earlier.
Cas’s cheeks turned pink again as he saw Dean’s dick between the spaces of his fingers when he had spread them apart. Blinking at it a few seconds before turning his gaze up into Dean’s eyes.
. Dean blinked at him with deep breaths before he lowered himself down to clasp their lips together, hands buried in the angels hair, so happy to see and hear how Castiel loved every second of this.
He kept fighting on, trying to squirm himself loose as he felt the flash sending a weird burning meandering inside him. Like a match it set a fire deep within his stomach and filled him right up with the sensation of a carbonated drink, bubbling at his reward system as if spamming the ‘
, it started to feel like a noose around his throat. As if it was his kryptonite. And for that he growled and slammed his fist into the marble wall, hard enough to crack his skin and let reddish tints trickle down with the water. His blood. The sight a comfort to his own pain. The vengeful demon arising within himself and soothing him, whispering promises in his ear. The temptation to kill just at the tip of its tongue, tickling every nerve ending in his body. A chaotic calm starting to radiate from within, having him suck down on his own bloodied knuckles just to feel the copper diffuse in his mouth.
The touch was uncomfortable to Castiel, just as uncomfortable as the deep tone in Sam’s kind voice. Cas wasn’t used to the feel of strong emotions activating areas of his brain that before partly laid dormant, not in others or himself. But soon the gentle hand on his shoulder began to feel weirdly okay and caring.
Cas pulled his lips backwards. It was neither a smile nor a pout. Just something that felt natural to his vessel as he thought of what it would be like if Sam and Dean didn’t get intertwined in an apocalyptic prophesy, where their demise all began. Perhaps it would have been for the better. They’d have their deepest desire of a normal life, and they’d have their family. But the thought made his heart ache with the same selfishness as before, because in that reality they’d probably never meet. He would still be a mechanical angel standing by and guarding the seventh heaven, a regent of Saturn, an observer of humanity. Not someone who interacts with the human world. He would be a seraph that would only attend the deaths of Kings or those who found themselves complete at loss. Lost like the Winchesters often found themselves.
Sam grinned and threw a bag at him which his hands grabbed in the air purely on automat. His angelic reflexes and the eons of training didn’t let him slip. Although he wasn’t sure he trusted them all too much, seeing as he did trip on that water bottle back in the motel.
“You’ve been eyeing me like a damn hamburger, that’s the only talkin’ you’ve been doing. Cherubs vs seraphs, spill it.”
Dean grabbed Cas’s chin, squeezing his mouth open to see all the goods pooled at his tongue. His eyes fluttered at the view, and that damn Cas just smiled at him and reached out his tongue to show off his treasure. Dean eyed at him, lust still in his mind, wanting to please him just a little bit more. He leaned in closer and spat out a slow dribble from his mouth of Castiel’s come onto the angels tongue. The angels eyes fluttered, his cheeks growing pinker and his eyebrow elevated, looking so embarassingly grateful and aroused,
Castiel smiled and tugged at his hand firmly, urging him upwards. "Dean…" he whispered, so enticingly that it would be impossible refuse. Dean straddled him over his waist and looked down at Castiel’s flushed and pearly body, finding him to be extremely cozy-looking. But then the angel tugged Dean’s hand further up to his mouth and licked it clean of his semen, as if it were cookie batter, enjoying it so much he was grinning.
“Dean called me.” Castiel quietly confessed. “I should have alerted you, but he threatened to silence his telephone device.”
Cas drenched a cotton wad in chlorhexidine and turned around to Sam who sat on one of the infirmary beds with a dizzy look on his face. It was a relief to see him up again, and that it hadn’t taken too long for him to wake up. It happened sometime when Cas carried him on his shoulder midway to the infirmary.
“Aah… We.. We don’t need to defeat it.” Castiel sighed and suddenly… loosened his tie? And wow. Dean had never seen Cas without it now when he thought of it. “We just… need to… find the leader a-and.” Cas began to unbutton his shirt and furrowed his eyebrows confused. “Oh? Dean,
Still the feeling lingered back at his mind as he stared at the chrome of the pipes, seeing a warped image of himself, an extended face in the metal. He couldn’t help himself, blackening his eyes to truly see what was there. Himself a demon. A hysteria bubbled up in his gut all the way to his throat, and he couldn’t help but to suddenly burst into laughter at the sad mess his life was,
Castiel had specifically told the motel owner that he didn’t require or want any room service, and that he’d rather not be disturbed by anyone. No one should be able to find him, he had set up wards against both angels and demons so that he wouldn’t be found. Like Sam and Dean had taught him, he also checked in with his alias that Dean had made him,
“You know that angels aren’t exactly materialistic beings, Sam.” Castiel replied flatly, but then eyed the roof as he remembered. “Although there is Sachiel… He owns
Cas snorted into the phone with that delicious sassiness only he could deliver. The angel could take a few jokes, most of the times he didn’t understand them – but having his celestial persona be joked about in a belittling way was something his celestial ass couldn’t stand.
Maybe he had merged fully with the darkness and the empty, cursed to be a lone soul that simply existed in nothing, being embraced by the cold of black.
“I’ll bet you one Benjamin that they’ll show up themselves.” Dean said, straightening his back and crossing his arms in a defensive stance.
Sam had gone straight to the Impala, but Castiel found himself forced to watch just a little while longer. A form of self-punishment over failing them again, but also a moment to pray that the curse would work before picking up the first blade that laid untouched by the fire.
But when he would find them finally succumbing, whenever their souls were leaving their bodies to be snatched down into the inferno awaiting them; Dean felt empty and somber again. He would think about the angel, and if he found that it hurt just a little too much, he needed to fetch another fleshy aspirin to torture.
Obligatory as always in the everyday life of Sam and Dean, there was also beer bottles propped beside him on the table. Two empty, one that he still hadn’t finished beside his laptop, and one unopened if he would find himself want another one.
Or They don't? Because I am feeling so indecisive. I am also very stressed with UNI up my knees, so I will need time to figure the shit out. Maybe I'll force a friend to read it all just to slap my senses back into focus.
“Huh? Here?” Dean said as he wiped the wrong side on purpose, grinning mentally as Crowley stared at him with frustration.
Dean trembled through the aftermaths of his orgasm, not releasing the bite on his lip until he could feel the last freaking spasm his perineum made. And despite the coast seemingly clear he waited 15 seconds just to be sure.
“He just… said okay and agreed to come with me? When I explained that Castiel wanted to apologize and quote on quote ‘hug it out’.”
They reached the front door, and Sam gave him a grin before he opened it, eyes daring in a way that made Castiel feel as if Sam knew something he didn’t.
“You okay there, Cas?” Sam asked, hands on the wheel as he drove Dean’s impala the same way he had come from just a few hours ago. Back to the Bunker in Lebanon, Kansas.
A common quota that Dean carefully lived by and let rule his life. As long as he wouldn’t utter the deepest and darkest thoughts that lured in his mind, they wouldn’t have any power over him. They simply wouldn’t exist. Because thoughts and emotions aren’t real, they’re easily manipulated- unlike a voice, his voice, and his ears as he would hear himself speak. Just as real as Cain’s voice felt. Just as Cain was wrecking that very quota which was crucial to his survival and sanity, that has started to feel real too.
But the bed was empty now. Instead of Dean, it was Sam in the room. Untreated cuts visible on the exposed skin of his face. His head hung loosely in a way that would probably be aching his neck come morning, only supported by his shoulder and the armchair he sat in. Sam looked oddly small now despite being the largest of them three. The vision completely different from when Dean would be sleeping there peacefully, now the whole room felt heavy and dark. The eyelids on Sam were puffy and tainted pink from crying. Blood still tarnished his shirt that belonged to himself, and from Dean. Despite sleeping, distress was still written all over his face and body.
Crowley shook his head in impatient disappointment and gripped at his injury where the blood was seeping through his coat. “Fuck. Why do you blasted mongoloids always have to ruin my coats...?" He growled slyly.
“Sure, you don’t feel like talk about it? It can help sometimes, y’know.” Sam said careful, as if Cas were some frightened doe on an open field ready to run.
that fine lass back there… What was her name again?” Crowley inquired with a grin, and Dean was too happy to even care about the message behind it at this point.
One moment ago, Dean found himself knocked out as Castiel force-landed on top of him out of the blue.
Dean honestly thought that he was just going to switch sides to the other part of his neck, anything but freaking...
. He began to remember bits and pieces of what had happened. Gadreel had betrayed Metatron and tricked his servant into gaining the location of his secret library in Blaine, Missouri. Apparently Sam and Cas had been conversing with the
“God, you’re clingier than Alice Parker in seventh grade.” Dean said under his breath as he swung his backpack over the shoulder. “Fine damn it. Do I need your permission to wash up this gunk from Mr. Lee over there too?”
“…Damn it.” Dean sighed in defeat. He had offended her, and not going through with this would offend her even more. She didn’t refuse to text her ex, but Dean couldn’t give his friend who he’s known for years a simple kiss. A friend that he had been with through hell, purgatory, heaven, and all things in between. This should be easy as a fart in the wind, but still. He felt nervous because it was complicated with Cas. The angel made Dean feel warm in ways he shouldn’t. He felt attracted to him even though he didn’t have boobs or soft womanly features. Cas had a strong chest, a toned and rough body at the perfect amount. He had small speckles of hair beneath his belly button, leading down… down to…
He observed himself with no specific emotion, but then an article in the woman’s magazines suddenly popped up in his mind,
Then he felt it again, lightheaded drowsiness, and the image of his surrounding began to blur out in colourful smearings. He could hear Sam desperately yelling at Castiel to save him, and it seemed like he had tried. For a moment everything was clear again and he saw that Castiel had lowered himself closer. He whispered something in his ear with a voice deep with determination, but full of somberness.
“Kay. Count to ten out loud. Let’s get this over with.” Dean said trying to be vocal about what a chore this was. Still not facing the angel. Charlie saluted at his order and turned around.
Dean watched him take off, paralyzed, and puzzled over the course of the event. He’s never seen Castiel embarrassed like that before, then again he hadn’t been this embarrassed in front of Castiel either.
“Uh, yeah, that and… Well, maybe you don’t want to wear Dean’s clothing all the time while yours are drying?”
Cas heard clutter of things falling down on the floor behind him and looked over his shoulder where he saw Sam flailing one hand towards a bin, the other hand was covering his stuffed mouth with something Cas knew wasn’t air. Before being able to aid the Winchester, Sam was clutching onto the bin and purged this morning’s breakfast into it with gnarly sounds. Still purging he stepped backwards to sit down on the infirmary bed again, nearly falling over.
Castiel’s swirling hips, and the dilerious enochian being breathed into his ear in soft moans sent Dean’s eyes rolling backwards as he gasped for air. He could feel it like a vibration, his own dick preparing to ooze out a new batch of come with new twitches and throbs. “
Dean and the king of hell sat in a booth on opposite sides of each other. He had initially grimaced at the fabric choice of the sofas. Red leather. It was a color he had been seeing too much of today. Satiating his anger and growing want after his call with Castiel had made this his most productive day ever since he became a demon ‘working’ for Crowley.
“Damn it Cas!” Dean blushed as he felt Cas’s hot breath land a little too close on his bare skin. He backed off just the amount needed to deliver a slap on the seraph’s cheek. He knew it wouldn’t snap him out of it, but perhaps he’d at least manage to finish this conversation before they both would get sucked back inside the rabbit hole, because… They seriously shouldn’t do that again.
“…Yes.” Castiel whispered, seemingly afraid to move. “… We don’t have much time...” He said as he slowly sat up, blinking dazed.
“Thank you for the parable.” Cas said, calm as a floating feather. A small grin was visible on his face along with confident eyes. “I’ve learned that there’s more to it than what the Pizza man initially taught me.” He continued as he fingered his way inside Dean, nudging at the walnut an inch deep. Dean clasped his hand over his mouth to counter the loudness inside his lungs which he had wanted to release. He wanted to cum now. He had wanted to cum since they were in the bathroom. No- before that as they had kissed at first. But Castiel shoved his hands away at any attempt to touch himself.
