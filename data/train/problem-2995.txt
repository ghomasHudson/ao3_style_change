“Yes, but if the situation were reversed, wouldn’t you want to know?”
As usual, I don't own Supernatural or any of it's characters. I'm just borrowing them for a time and I fully intend to return them in moderately good condition. (Well I say

“Uh – hey,” Dean replies, taking a step backward.
“Well Crowley can shove his

“Oh, I would, Winchester.” Charlie slides the iPhone from her pocket and gestures with it menacingly. “And I know people. I can make that kinda shit go viral in no time flat.”
a purge. He paid his dues. He stripped himself down to the basest form and it allowed him to rebuild from the ground up. Dean remembers that he is a newly made man – formed from the dust of monsters twice dead. He does not answer to a God or a father any longer. He answers to his own call.
“First of all,” Dean says, “as he’s so fond of pointing out these days, he’s
“Ah. I forgot.”
“Hold up!” Dean extends a hand to try and quell Charlie’s excitement. “I gotta make a few calls – make sure the tabs we got on the angels place ‘em the hell away from here – and take a shower. And
“I sure as shit did!” Charlie whines. “Those poor devoted fans were left with Dean in hell for eternity! That’s just awful! It was like

published the rest of the novels?” asks Sam incredulously.
He puts the phone down and returns his attention to the road. He savors the drive, lets the grip of the wheel beneath his hands ground him. It's his last chance to think before he has to deal with Crowley. Before he has to kick it into high gear. Then again, Dean always seems to be operating at 500%. Rest, peace, relaxation -- all foreign concepts. He tries, certainly, he tries. He'll kick up his feet, close his eyes, and take deep breaths, but his mind won't stop racing. Someone needs something. Something needs doing. Problems need solving.
“You wouldn’t dare.” Dean narrows his eyes.
“The angels are in Kansas and we don’t know why.”
“Yeah, Kevin asked me to talk to you.”  Dean sighs and makes a lap around the room. He straightens things that don’t need to be straightened and fiddles with whatever is in his reach. “So, what happened – I guess?”
have you and Sam not been answering my texts?”
But before Dean can complete this thought, Cas himself enters the kitchen. He’s slightly more disheveled than usual. The fallen angel is dressed of course – slightly too big thrift store jeans belted into place, the sleeves of a ratty plaid over-shirt rolled up to the elbows, and a grey v-neck thrown beneath the button-up… A grey v-neck that Dean thinks he recognizes… A grey v-neck that Dean is pretty sure he’s
always there whenever Dean needed him. He pulled Cas out of heavenly battles to make house calls. He consistently and perpetually alienated Castiel from his brothers and sisters. Though, in the end, Cas has always made his own decisions (and perhaps been one of the first angels since Lucifer to do so) Dean cannot ignore or disregard his own influence on those choices.
Charlie’s lecturing Dean on the benefits of Joss Whedon when Cas materializes in what Charlie assures him (for the third time) is the last thing he’ll have to try on. Dean is again mad speechless by what adorns Cas’s body. This time, however, it’s for a very different reason.
idea?” Dean’s words echo around the training room before it falls silent. That may have come out a little more hostile than he intended, but Kevin’s right about one thing. Walking on eggshells is getting real old, real fast. Dean turns to go, and is stopped short of the entrance.
“Just your average, run-of-the-mill billionare CEO whose bank security is insultingly shitty. One of many, unfortunately. Well, I say
Dean says nothing.
“I might be able to forgive you for all the shit you’ve put me and Sammy through. I just might have it in me. But you wouldn’t even hear it! I can’t even forgive you, you son of a bitch!”
“I may have… recently assisted him in finishing his untold story.” Charlie shuts her eyes as if waiting for death to descend.
Though they no longer share a telepathic link, the angels have found other ways to network. They’re on the lookout. They want revenge. Namely, Cas’s head on a silver platter. Crowley makes their list as well, but he’s essentially harmless. The angels almost seem to pity him. They haven’t thought to try and find him yet. That’s why he volunteers to run the errands. It’s why Dean, with horror in his heart, relinquishes the keys to his beloved mechanical baby once a week. It’s the safest course of action. The angels don’t know Crowley’s stuck around with the Winchesters. They have no clue that the link to Cas is right in front of them. So Crowley is the one who makes a trip to buy Cas and himself new clothes. He’s the one to pick up bananas for Sam and pie for Dean. His immediate satisfaction with domesticity has more to do with deep-seated guilt than anything else, but no one’s had much time for psychoanalyzing as of late.
He pushed his lips against Castiel’s with a new found fervor and Cas responded enthusiastically. It was sloppy and frantic. Dean’s mouth opened hungrily against Cas’s and their top teeth clinked together. Cas clumsily reached his arm up Dean’s neck and into his hair, tugging gently. A little moan escaped Dean’s throat and hummed against Cas’s lips as he felt the shaking fingers of the angel trace circles on his scalp. Slowly they found a way to fit themselves together and as new and unfamiliar as it all was, Dean couldn’t remember ever feeling anything better. He bit at Cas’s bottom lip. He traced his tongue over the indention his teeth had made and felt giddy.
Okay, I know it's technically been two weeks and one day, but here it is! Chapter Five! What a doozy.
Well. It's been just over 7 years since I last updated this fanfic. I stopped watching Supernatural around 2015 and I thought I was done. I thought I was out, but then November 5, 2020, happened and by god, they pulled me back in. Please consider the act of me finishing this fic as my "one last job."
Cas smiles slightly at the joke and Dean watches the corners of his mouth strain against whatever weight lies heavy upon him.
Dean makes it to the Impala before sunset and almost kisses his baby hello. Instead, he yanks open the passenger door and slides into the driver's seat. His breath comes in huffs and pants. He unlocks his phone -- five missed calls from Sam, a couple voicemails too, and a single text from Cas. Not wanting to stay near the house any longer than he has to, Dean starts the car and does a U-turn back onto the highway. He speeds out away, cradling his phone in the crook of his neck to return Sammy's calls.
Dean mumbled into the fabric, so quiet it was almost inaudible.
“I can’t,” replied Cas. “Not now.”
“Good. No, really. That’s
“Yeah. But Spock’s always been my favorite,” he replies.
“That’s not important right now,” says Sam. “Charlie, how did you read past Dean going to hell? I thought that’s where the series ended.”
It’s a bumpy one, all dirt lane roads, but Charlie doesn’t seem to mind. She sits in the back of The Impala at the edge of the vinyl seat cushion, her safety belt a discarded luxury. She talks nonstop and Cas proves to be an excellent listener. Dean isn’t quite so patient and pops in a Journey tape after the first five minutes of one-sided chatter. The speakers, which are still in pretty good condition given all they’ve been through, spit out the thumping rock beat of
“Sound travels, squirrel!” calls Crowley from the kitchen.
“Yeah. Thanks Garth.”
nice to see Charlie again. It’s kind of relieving to have a conversation with someone “normal” for a change. Someone who’d rather chat about the latest Star Trek Movie (which Dean has to admit to Charlie he hasn’t seen yet) than what kind of mega-spell could kick an entire race out of their homeland. See, lately certain pieces of Dean have been stumbling out of their carefully guarded caves and prodding him sharply, as if they’ve finally had enough of being ignored. He’s realizing, slowly, that happiness is not something that just happens to you when the storm blows over. It doesn’t fall from the sky and land in your lap and suddenly solve all your problems for you. Happiness is something you have to take when you can get it – storm be damned.
For a minute, Dean expects Cas to claim he doesn’t understand the reference. For a minute, Dean thinks things might be like they used to be. However, any hopes of a nostalgic and innocent ending to this talk are dashed with the look on Cas’s face.
“In short, you’ve taken my beloved trench-coated angel baby away from me and that simply won’t do.” As Charlie says this she laces her left arm through Cas’s right and locks their elbows together.
The morning after the wine glass incident is a lazy one. Dean lies in bed for a good hour after he wakes up. Having a regular sort of sleeping pattern doesn’t always agree with his body. He’s gotten so used to catching three hours of rest here and there, running on empty, and downing whatever he can con off a pharmacist to keep him going. Sometimes Dean misses the rush of being on the run. That’s the way he’s lived the majority of his life. Sure, there was that year with Lisa and Ben – which he pointedly refuses to think about – but other than that he’s always been transient. He’s done what he’s had to do to survive. There’s no shame in that, but it does mean he’s got the occasional memory that he’d like to forget.
“This is about Kevin, I assume,” Cas says, shutting the door. He wrings his hands.
It’s a warning. It’s a warning that Dean refuses to heed any longer.
. Not even facing Leviathan. Not even confronting unknown evil whilst dressed in a tunic. Charlie is entirely and unequivocally worried.
There’s a pregnant pause.
Dean’s caught off guard. He panics and grunts non-committedly. Charlie doesn’t seem to notice and sorts through the piles again for another outfit. Cas walks back into the dressing room and throws Dean a weird sort of look before sliding the curtain shut. Dean clenches his fist against his knee and remains silent.
"Hello? Dean?" Sam's voice is faint and tinny.
“I said it was harder than it used to be. I didn’t say it wasn’t easy.”
“It has, though,” says Cas between jabs. “This is all much harder than it used to be.”
He leaned forward to touch his forehead to Castiel’s and Cas responded with minimal surprise at the gesture. Their noses slid against each other as they hesitantly crossed a line into unmapped territory. They stayed there, just like that for some time. It was a contented, but charged sort of contact. Their mouths hovered near each other, but didn’t touch. Dean could feel the warmth of Castiel’s breath pass over his slightly parted lips and slowly —painfully slowly— he moved forward to close the remaining space between them. Each movement was equally terrifying and exhilarating.
“I mean,”—Charlie shifts closer to Dean—“You don’t actually trust him… do you? Cured or not, he’s still Crowley!”
Abaddon isn’t the issue. Since taking up her throne in hell, she’s been more interested in tracking down the angels than anything else. They think it’s her intention to kill every last one of them and make sure they’re never given the chance to return home… or at least torture them to insanity. Dean has a theory that hell might actually give the Winchesters a break for once – seeing as they’ve stopped trying to close the pit and were pivotal in the eviction of heaven. Crowley agrees that they likely aren’t Abaddon’s immediate targets. No, the demons aren’t their biggest problem at the moment.
The words caught in Dean’s throat.
Charlie laughs and sets a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll pick out an outfit. You’ll try it on. Simple.”
“Speaking of Cas, where’s the trench coat?”
“Welcome to the club,” mumbles Dean. He sits down next to Cas with his arms propped up on his knees. “You’re making sense. It’s just like I told you, you can’t hold it in – not like this. I wasn’t kidding. You’ll start taking it out on everybody around you and it’ll get a whole lot worse than just yelling at Kev.” Dean thinks he hears something on the other side of the door – the scuffling of boots, or the bitter grumblings of a dead man. He ignores them.
“Good,” Crowley mumbles.
Thirty minutes and he starts realizing how stupid it was for him to leave The Bunker at midday.  Especially when, for all he knows, a gang of angels could be lurking at the nearest Gas n’ Sip. Garth’s assurance that he wouldn’t “be much use dead” plays like a loop in Dean’s broken mind. But he’s out now and he might as well go ahead with the plan. Even if the plan is stupid too. Dean would rather eat his own hand than try and sit Crowley down for a pleasant little chat about his midnight roadtrip. With evidence, it’ll be hell of a lot easier to convince Sam that they really don’t need to
almost 40!”
“You make any headway on Metadouche’s spell then?”
be thinking about. It isn’t hard to guess when Cas sets his jaw like that – like he’s determined to do something about something. Dean knows that kind of preoccupation intimately.
“You can if you want,” says Dean. “But I swear to God, if I find out later you’ve somehow managed to stay conscious, I really am going to knock your lights out. Nothing quite like a head injury to help recharge your batteries. I would know.” Dean sees Cas smile out of the corner of his eye and hears him chuckle under his breath. The previews continue to play, advertising various spin-off series, while Dean picks anxiously at a callous on his left hand and waits. When the main menu of the DVD finally appears, (It’s
“Yeah, you really seem to be struggling here Cas,” Dean grumbles, bitter under the weight of his friend’s torso. Cas smirks, inching his knife closer to Dean’s throat with each passing moment.
“Well, if you’ve got any suggestions, please, feel free to share with the class.” Dean grumbles. He begins to tap out the guitar part of a Foreigner song on his knee. His fingers move in time with the music in his head and the action relieves some of his frustration. He’s not sure how much more of this fashion show he can take.
“Don’t be stupid. We’re tracking him.” Dean picks at a loose thread in a seam of his jeans. Maybe he should do a little shopping for himself while they’re there.
“Wait a minute.” Sam pauses and thoughtfully appraises Charlie. “How do you even know Cas used to wear a trench coat?”
to end.”
Dean clears his throat. “Also, uh, last Thursday night. You didn’t commandeer the Mazda for a midnight snack run did ya?”
“What?”
Sam sighs. "Fine."
“Wait, so you’ve just been letting him leave the bunker unsupervised?”
“Well, I was wondering,” Cas says while Dean is dazed. “If maybe you could… we could…”

“Oh, yeah, by the way – who’s paying for all this?” Dean asks, gesturing to the not insignificant ‘buy’ pile.
were this information made known to you.”
Kevin spends most of his time desperately translating the angel tablet – hoping beyond hope that there’s a way to set things right or summon an angel’s grace. Dean tells him not to push too hard. He makes Kevin take breaks and days off. He wishes Kevin didn’t have to translate the damn thing at all. He wishes he could show the kid a way out. Dean doesn’t want to tell Kevin what he fears he already knows: there
“I just don’t know if that’s true or not.” Sam pauses. “And I’m not willing to risk it.”
Initially, Crowley’s induction didn’t go well. Upon sight, Kevin launched himself at the dethroned king of hell. The kid got a few good hits in, too, before Crowley fell to the floor in complete surrender. He wept openly, begging to be shown mercy. Kevin was completely and appropriately stunned. The situation was explained. Crowley admitted that he hadn’t actually killed Mrs. Tran. She was hiding in Washington – under the impression that Kevin had sent her to a cushy safe house on the Olympic Peninsula. Crowley had sent her the coordinates from Kevin’s phone with express instructions not to contact him until he’d given her the okay. After this revelation (and a long distance phone call) the prophet came around.
“Do what? I’m reading.” Cas lowers his head to gloss over the pages of his book again.
Sam snorts. Dean whips his head back around to shoot an icy glare at his brother.
Sam shakes his head in slow disbelief. “Maybe it’s a glitch. Maybe the tracker’s gone haywire or something?”
Sam had entered their shoddy motel room, swept past the unsightly oilcloth curtained window, and bullied a near unconscious Dean into the bathroom. It had taken Sam a couple of tries to prop Dean upright against the bacteria rich toilet bowl. Eventually he’d been successful. He’d then proceeded to open Dean’s grumbling mouth and shove his pointer and middle finger as far down his brother’s throat as was humanly possible. It was not an overly pleasant experience for either Winchester sibling.
. When I try to write Dean as a literary heroine from the 1800's, she beats me with a wooden stick and sends me back to the drawing board.
“Oh, come on!” says Sam. “We weren’t being malicious. You’d overheat in that thing!”
. If it were you instead of him, things would be different. You wouldn’t want to know because you wouldn’t… feel inclined to…
“Alright, alright. Relax.” Dean says, raising his hands. “I get it. Cas is a dick. That’s nothing new. But maybe – just for right now – you could cut the guy a little slack, eh?”
Dean closes his eyes and does what he’s learned to do when the stench of his father’s whiskey breath floats in off a breeze from the past. He stops. He remembers. He remembers the soot and the perpetual overcast and the taste of iron on the wind. He remembers when he saw himself, really, for the first time and didn’t turn from the image in disgust. The simplicity of that time – purgatory. It
Charlie looks to Dean.
“How could I not care?” he asks, the slightest hint of emotion leaking into his voice.
“How –
“Ow! Fine! Fine – we’ll get a third phone or something. A back up,” Dean says. “Or, hell, we’ll just give you Cas’s number.”
” Charlie says this all in one breath. Dean actually gasps.
“Alright,” she says with gusto. “I think we’re ready to try on!”
“So that would make him… what 38? 39 now? Shit, Cas! You’re almost 40!”
“Three or four hours outta Lebanon.”
“I just think you guys should be a little more careful with Mr. Tea-and-Crumpets.”
“Then approximately forty-five hours.”
Dean enters the control room with a wadded up set of sheets in his arms and inclines his head toward Charlie as he makes his way through to the lowest level of the compound. The whole gang is sat around the table chatting. Each of them has a drink in hand due to Crowley’s fastidious bartending and the atmosphere in The Bat Cave feels lighter than ever. Charlie regales one of her ComicCon exploits to much laughter – Cas excluded. Mostly he just clings to his beer bottle and looks politely confused. She gestures with her hands and moves through the story with grace and timing, as if she’s told it a million and one times before.
“You got this one?” Dean asks.
“Uh… twenty.” Sam answers.
“I could fill a book —twenty books— with the stuff I don’t tell Sam. I can’t tell him these things.”
“On you?” Dean looks skeptical.
“You’re Cas? As in Castiel? As in Angel of The Lord, Castiel?” Charlie takes very slow and measured steps toward Cas who starts to speak.
, Dean thinks.
Cas nods. He takes a moment, but slowly rises to a stand. Dean joins him.
He kicks the door to the laundry room open with the edge of his foot and enters, letting it swing closed behind him. Dean tosses the sheets into one of many hampers stacked around the place and makes a mental note to wash the sheets sometime during the coming week. Maybe he’ll start working on the other bedrooms too. They seem to be amassing a small militia and it wouldn’t do to be unprepared for any new troops. He passes through the door again and listens to the slight echo of its squeaky hinges all the way down the hall.
“The what?”
He doubts his father ever knew. About any of it. If John did notice it, he ignored it. He preferred to maintain that his little soldier was the picture of masculinity and strength. And Dean tried. He tried so hard to live up to those standards. For years he trained himself to avoid anything deemed ‘sissy.’ He hid his comic books and his science fiction novels. He read them in secret, a deep guilt settling in his stomach. As if his need for an escape from his freak show of a life was weak or wrong. He’s shed so much of his father’s skin. Sloughed it off almost entirely in the dirt bath of purgatory. Yes, Dean supposes if his father could see him now… he would likely be eternally and indecently amused. Dean can almost hear it – the disappointment. The degradation.
Cas narrows his eyes a little, but grins.
,” says Dean and Charlie jumps up and down again. “But I’m coming with, in case we run into trouble. I’m not sure I trust you with that pea shooter.”
Dean rolls his eyes.
“So, what?” Dean huffed, “you telling you me you’re alive out there? You’re sitting in some diner eating a cheeseburger and waiting for us to figure it out? Well, congratulations. You’re wasting your time. We ain’t looking.”
“Christ, Charlie! You scared the shit out of us.” Sam lowers his shotgun.
There weren’t scars on his back – no wounds, no gaping holes, or feathered stumps. And he’d sat impossibly still while the needle pressed into the tender skin over his spine. Dean didn’t see him flinch, not once.
not.”
“It’ll turn up, I’m sure,” says Sam, his eyes glued to an open book in front on him.
“Wait – please tell me you’re the one who covered their website in pictures of kittens and rainbows.”
"Just don't let Crowley leave -- for any reason, got it?" says Dean.
“But physically, I mean, you’re almost 40... Oh fuck. You’re only four years older than me.
“How do you do it? How do you not just die? I
Kevin just stares at Dean, mouth agape. “Does it matter?”
“Are these pants supposed to feel like they’re cutting off the circulation to my feet?”
Sam looks unnerved by the question.
“He screamed. A lot. It was kind of hard to misinterpret.”
“No!” Sam raises his voice and the sudden increase in volume makes Dean flinch against the concrete. “I
His dreams were normally re-runs: repeats of his greatest hits and conquests or, more often, a series of brutal and unrelenting nightmares. Sometimes he rehashed old failures and mistakes. Sometimes these horrors mutated into entirely different beasts. Sometimes his memories of hell mixed with reality in the pursuit of un-matched terror. But, regardless, there was always a blue streak of recognition. His dreams were always familiar and this dream was not. He couldn’t even identify pieces of his experiences that had perhaps been sculpted into something new. It was all fresh out of the packaging.
He stares at the screen a moment too long and drifts onto the shoulder. The sounds his tires make against the rough asphalt tear him away from the phone and he directs the car back into the center of the lane. He really shouldn't text and drive. But he does anyway.
Cas raises an eyebrow and then steps back as well.
“It’s okay, Charlie. He’s… uh… well. He’s cured.”
“It’s not poison, for Christ’s sake, it’s Benadryl. Now take it before I decide knocking you over the head is the easier solution, here.” Dean shakes his hand slightly from side to side. The pink pills shift and roll in his palm. He raises his eyebrows as if to say
for all her help and hard work in making this thing way less shitty. She puts up with all of my crazy and my insistence on trying to make Dean Winchester sing things at every possible opportunity.
. You left. You walked into that goddamn lake and all that came out was your dirty coat! And I’m not dealing, Cas. I used to deal. I used to be able to take this stuff in stride and I’m losing it over here. I’m cracking. I’m probably 90% Jack Daniels at this point and crossing my fingers that Sam’ll lend me a part of his liver when all’s said and done. And you know the worst part?”
did you idjits do this time!?” Garth’s thick twang sounds over the receiver.
“I have no clue what you’re talking about.”
Charlie passes Cas his next ensemble under the curtain of the stall and returns to her perch on the couch. Dean notices she’s lined up a couple of other outfits and hung them on an empty rack next to the chair.
“Well,” says Dean, pushing himself off the couch and wincing at the continued throbbing in his head. “Somebody took the car that night. Late. And didn’t come back for a while. Charlie’s tracker caught ‘em. Whoever did it stopped right outside of Clay Center -- about an hour or so from here. So, if it wasn’t you, and it wasn’t me…”
. There’s an old school speed bag in the corner, a full set of weights, archery equipment by the back wall – everything a hunter dreams of owning, but never has the chance to. It may be outdated, but it’s utilizable. Dean adores it. He considers actually bothering to work out, just so he can spend time in the place.
“Why not?”
“It’s a movie. Don’t – don’t worry about it.” Dean has a hard time reigning in his smile. “What I’m saying is, you need to find a way to get that stuff out: shoot a gun, punch somebody, gank a demon, Hell! Get laid for once! You find ways.”
“Should I leave?” Cas asks. He’s confused, clearly. The meds probably aren’t helping.
“Oh.”
-okay, but is he adjusting to it? The – the human thing?”
“I can’t find my bag.” Dean doesn’t have to specify which bag he means.
“Full Metal Ja—?”
Dean clears his throat. “What? What were you wondering?”
appeared in his dreams on a regular basis for some time. Occasionally those appearances had actually been Castiel attempting to contact his subconscious. Other times, it had just been dream Cas— a marble carved memory. Dean had only just made the decision to approach the form of his friend when he suddenly found himself standing beside the very bench his angel was hunched over.
sure you’re about the only person I could ever say this to. So I’m gonna say it. I may not have another chance, right? I—”
“All of them?” he asks, swallowing hard.
“Kevin,” Charlie says. “Would you mind getting the bottles from over there? And, actually, if you’re interested in hacking stories I should really tell you about the time I completely defiled The Westboro Baptist Church homepage.”
hurts Dean in a hundred special little ways. Yes, Cas could be an asshole like his winged siblings. Cas could be oblivious and cumbersome. Cas could also be fierce and loyal and even funny on the rare occasion. Dean can’t ignore the faults in his friend. To do so would be dishonest. It would be unwise. But when Dean wakes each morning to the find Cas the same hollow shell that he was the day before? It makes him wonder if Cas hasn’t suffered enough at this point. What good would his anger do? No good. Not when the target of said anger seems dead behind the eyes on a good day.
“I understand, Dean. We’re working on getting y’all off lockdown, so just sit tight and take care of yourselves.”
“It’s difficult,” says Cas. “I find it near impossible to… to…”
“I don’t know – But that dungeon we got’s looking pretty tempting right now.”
“Kill me.”
“Not getting cold feet, are ya, Cas?” Dean had asked, clapping Cas on the shoulder, and cocking an eyebrow.
Charlie freezes. She looks quickly between Dean and Sam as if they must be crazy and eyes the shot gun across the room. Sam steps in.
Charlie considers the choice. “You’re right,” she sighs. “The color totally brings out his eyes. Here, Dean, hold this.” And Charlie thrusts the shirt into his hands. Dean is about to protest that he is not a pack mule when he catches the unobstructed sight of Cas.
I reiterate: I don't own Supernatural or any of the characters I've hijacked below. All glory to TPTB. Kripke is our king.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Charlie says, rolling her eyes, “Just the bajillion texts I sent you after people started
“Hello?”
“Listen, there’s a strong possibility the angels don’t even know you’re in the state. So don’t go startin’ something you know you can’t finish.” Says Garth. Dean rubs his palm into the socket of one eye and looks at Cas with the other. The fact that Cas is still standing in a fighting stance doesn’t escape his notice.
” Dean cries.
“The Doctor?”
Cas wasn’t a phone call away anymore.
Dean makes his way from the bedroom hallway to the balcony, down the stairs, across the control room, through the library, and sidles into the kitchen around 9:15. By the time he’s made the impressive trek across their sprawling compound, he’s worked up quite an appetite. An obscenely hung-over Kevin sits slumped at the breakfast table, his head in his hands. Dean pulls ingredients from their bulbous 1950’s refrigerator and lifts various pans and utensils from the surrounding cabinets. He lets the doors to the cupboards slam shut.  There’s a groan from the table area. Dean smirks and cracks a few eggs into a bowl. He takes a very deep breath and begins to scream his every word.
“I texted Charlie about it,” says Dean. “She seems pretty confident that it’s not a glitch.
“That’s what I thought.”
“We didn’t meet Cas until he pulled Dean –“
"Yeah. I just left the place Crowley's been to visit on his secret little roadtrips --"
“Right. Sure.” Says Kevin, like he’s not at all convinced that either of those statements are true. Dean half-wonders how long it would take to locate a new prophet if this one were to suddenly find himself without a pulse. “Anyway, I need you to find a way to… calm him the
Cas is silent and expressionless. Dean takes it as a cue to continue.
“Around you, maybe,” Kevin laughs humorlessly. “Today I had to ask him a couple of questions about the angel tablet and he about tore my head off.”
“Yeah, but it’s a pretty inaccurate method of keeping tabs on someone. That much I’m
“Maybe you could help me…” There’s another pause during which Dean wants to shake the man beside him until he finishes his stupid sentence. “With some combat training?” Cas studies his nervous hands intently.
"Join the club,” Sam scoffs.
. Sharp, triangular, encrusted in blood. The relief Dean was feeling moments before slides out of his stomach and is replaced by a sharp aching sensation. He stands, the angel blade in one hand, the other fishing around for the phone in his pocket. But it's not there. It's where he left it, on the seat of the Impala. He curses under his breath. Leave it to him to remember a gun but forget a goddamn cell phone.
Moving right along, I must again thank my flawless Beta and friend,
“Fine,” Dean agrees, then sighs. “Fine.”
Dean turns to head up the staircase, but for the second time that morning he’s stopped dead in his tracks by an obscenely loud noise. This time, he’s frozen with laughter instead of fear as Kevin’s frustrated cry reverberates through the large open rooms of the bunker.
That responsibility falls to him now. He’s got home court advantage. His guardian angel needs a guardian of his own and it seems only fair that Dean return the favor. With one more glance at Cas’s sleeping face, Dean turns out the lamp. He uses his phone to guide himself out of the darkened room and walks slowly toward the kitchen. As he wanders the halls of The Bunker he hums a Beatles tune and contemplates just how far the tables have turned.
“Well, Ken doll I suppose, if you wanna get technical—”
Dean lost a little steam.
“What do you mean what did we do? We haven’t done shit in months! I’m friggin’ dying of cabin fever over here!”
“I got this one,” Sam says.
angel.”
“I thought you might like this one,” she chuckles.
Dean glances over at the blade resting next to him on the seat.  "Nothing good. It's getting dark and I'm driving back now. We'll talk more when I get home."
“I don’t know what this has to do with the offspring of domesticated fowls, but okay.”
. She screams at me and cracks the whip and, masochist that I am, I love it. If I'm not careful, I fear she might tattoo "SHOW DON'T TELL" onto my forehead while I sleep.
“Good! The tie’s nice too. Very mod. What do you think, Dean?”
“The very same!”
“I’ve been waiting for this. I’ve been waiting for a confrontation, for my punishment. At first I assumed you’d kill me upon sight. Bite off the head of the serpent. Nip the eternal failure I am in the bud. But you didn’t. You’ve kept me protected and tolerated me. You’ve worked tirelessly to fix my errors. This is hardly the first mistake I’ve made or that you’ve had to mop up. It’s a pattern, Dean. It’s…” Cas trails off for a moment, but Dean doesn’t know what to say. Then the moment is gone and Cas becomes truly erratic.
Cas is quiet for a moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
HERE IT IS. THE THIRD CHAPTER. FINALLY.
Cas still looks uncertain.
“I literally have no clue what that means.”
“You have
“I’ll take care of it,” says Dean with a small sigh.
“You can have it, Dean. If you like.” Cas seems entirely sincere.
“Let go?” Dean offers.
Again, many thanks must be given to my glorious beta
“Would you?” Dean rubs at his face a couple of times before looking up at Sam, who seems amused, but not unkindly so.
The lamp also illuminates Cas, who blinks wearily in an attempt to adjust to the lighting shift. He looks just as tired as he did at dinner, maybe even more so. He doesn’t wobble one way or another as he leans against the couch, but stays stiff. It’s only his face that gives away his true exhaustion. The circles under his eyes are dark and prominent. They never used to get that way. Dean lifts himself into a sitting position on the couch, his back against the arm, his legs stretched out on the seat.
Dean furrows his brow. “What are you talking about? Calm? He’s totally calm.”
Now he
The man looks beyond bashful beneath the mound of garments he’s already piled high with.  Dean wonders how Charlie’s managed to pick out so much merchandise in such a short period of time (he couldn’t have been gone more than ten minutes) but he doesn’t ask her. He knows when to step aside in the face of a master. She zips around the store, pulling out pair after pair of jeans, button ups, t-shirts, undershirts, jackets, and the occasional tie. She pauses just long enough to ask for their opinion on a striped v-neck or set of khakis before flitting back into the dense forest of huddled racks. Dean can barely keep track of it all. The stack in his arms grows almost as unmanageable as Cas’s. Eventually Charlie stops her mad dash to review the fruits of her labor.
“No he did,” says Dean, “I just meant – you, what happened with you? Why did you…”
Dean doesn’t like the way Sam says that.
He quickly stows the blade in his inside jacket pocket and starts sprinting through the forest. Branches whip past his ears and scrape up his neck, but he doesn't stop. If it weren't for the light cresting over the hill now, streaming through the tops of the trees and casting a golden haze over the trail, Dean might expect to meet a vampire around the next corner. He might expect Benny to sneak up from behind it while Dean does his best imitation of helpless bait. He might huddle up against a tree to get some sleep while Benny keeps watch. He might dream of Cas by a river, drinking in the gloom of the world around him. Drowning in it...
Dean shakes his head. “You best watch Cas like a hawk. He might try to sneak out the window while you’re not looking.”
“Okay, thank
The lights in the library sear his eyes shut and Dean turns them off before sitting in front of his laptop. It hums and whirs like a reminder. The path the Mazda took is just waiting in Charlie’s GPS tracker log. Turn by turn directions. Exact coordinates. Dean drops his head to the table and presses it, hard, against the wood. The pressure temporarily relieves some of the pain. He tries to think.
“Okay! So I did! Just online though!”
“Sure,” Sam says, “but you should really go see Cas too.”
Cas grabs his untouched glass of wine and flings it across the room. It shatters against the stone wall and the explosion of glass throws burgundy liquid all over a set of nearby book shelves.
Cas worries Dean the most. Cas worries them all, to be honest.
Dean glances toward the silent form beside him to find that sleep has finally claimed the former angel. His head is tilted back, his mouth slightly open, and his arms deadweight by his sides. Dean has to stifle another laugh and considers snapping a few pictures with his phone, but decides against it in the end. It’s too early to be so cruel. Dean pauses the movie and stands to go retrieve it from the DVD player and return it to its case. He’s about to turn out the lamp by the couch and leave the den when he sees Cas again – his neck scrunched uncomfortably against the back of the seat cushion. Dean looks at the lamp, looks at Cas, looks at the lamp and leaves it on before making his way to help his friend avoid a pinched nerve.
But there’s a hollowness to Cas’s interactions. He leaves the room when the angels are mentioned. He doesn’t offer information or solutions. He tries to seem as if he doesn’t care. They all know otherwise.
Cas looks confused.
Crowley stretches his arms in a yawn and stands up from the table. He excuses himself and leaves to go wash his empty wine glass. Dean can’t help but notice that Charlie’s eyes stay glued to the former demon until he’s completely out of her sightline. There’s a sort of shadow in her eye. She slides her chair away from the table and reaches to grab Dean’s empty beer bottle from in front of him.
most people. She’s someone he can just hug, no questions asked. He wraps his arms around her and she responds in earnest. If she sheds a few tears into his shoulder, he pretends not to notice.
before. Laundry is more difficult with five sets of clothes to sort through instead of just two. Mix-ups have been known to happen. So Dean isn’t sure why Cas wearing one of his shirts hits him in the gut. He’s equally unsure why the guy’s damp post-shower hair hits him in the same place. It sticks up in all directions. When Cas reaches up a hand to idly smooth the back of his neck, the borrowed t-shirt rides up a little. Dean glimpses a line of pale flesh above Cas’s beltline before snapping his head back to his plate.
“Why not?” She starts to fiddle with Cas’s collar. She makes a twirling motion with her finger. When Cas doesn’t understand what this means, Charlie grabs him by the shoulders and turns him herself. She pulls at the tag on his t-shirt to check it. Kevin watches on with what can only be described as pure envy. Dean coughs and rubs at his neck.
Guess who said they were going to post this on Sunday? And guess what day it is? (Monday)
“What, did Chuck keep publishing? We threatened to murder him, you know.” Sam crosses his arms and raises a single eyebrow in what looks to be the beginning of mega bitch face.
“You mean well. You always have. So you’ve screwed up? Join the club. We’ve all done shit we ain’t proud of and most of the time the reason things go sour is cause someone isn’t trusting someone they should. I’m not laying blame here. I’m not pointing fingers. I’m willing to leave the past in the past and just focus on the now. But, now more than ever, you’ve
“Nothing. Nothing. Don’t worry about it.”
The second month is better.
Cas makes a face like he’s actually considering this suggestion and is utterly horrified by the very possibility.
He’s never really truly had one before.
The sky darkens and Dean drives westward. He passes by The Angel Den again. The hearse has been moved, but the Christmas lights still shine, hanging from the eaves of the house like warm-weather icicles. They wink at Dean and throw light onto the faces of the angels below them. Each stone seraph shifts and dances, as if painted through the eye of a kaleidoscope. They live. Dean watches The Den grow smaller and smaller in his rearview mirror, until it can no longer be seen -- blinking or otherwise. He feels around in the seat next to him until he finds his phone again.
Dean grimaces as pain shoots like a bolt of lightning up the base of his skull. “He’s a demon, Sam. We know what this means.”
“She’s right though,” pipes Crowley from the doorway of the library, “Edlund did a particularly excellent job detailing Castiel’s features. I was less than pleased with his assessment of me, but he got Cas spot on.” He steps down into the control room and Kevin follows behind him.
"Yeah, It's me. Why do you say that like a question? Who else is it gonna be?"
Dean glances around the store, his eyes lingering a little on Cas’s dressing room.
“What the
it’s on a Mr. Elliot James Connelly.”
“Yeah, yeah. A hobby, something.”
“That’s okay,” says Cas, smoothing out the front of his shirt.
Sam rolls his eyes as he loops his arm around Kevin’s back and practically carries the inebriated prophet out of the room. It is decidedly quieter when the youngest members of their team leave. Dean supposes it isn’t fair to count his 4-year head start on Sammy as a real age difference when Cas and Crowley are in the room, but he does it anyway. Because, as the big brother, that’s his job.
Kevin laughs even harder and sways in his seat. Sam chuckles, too, and pushes the tipsy kid upright in his chair. Even Cas smiles a little.
Cas settles down at the table Crowley has been circling. He absent mindedly picks up a book and flips through its pages with blatantly feigned interest. Crowley’s footsteps echo in the silent space as he exits through the kitchen door – propping it open as he goes.  The space that’s left between the only two people in the room seems ridiculously large, so Dean moves to join Cas at his table of preference. The chair creaks as he settles into it, but Cas doesn’t appear to notice his new companion.  Dean downs the remainder of his scotch and makes a decision. He is going to get Cas back. He is going to pull Cas from whatever hole he’s retreated into. He is going to find a way. When Dean’s glass runs dry he slams it down upon the tabletop – hard. The sound startles Cas who, though not engrossed in the pages of the demon guide, clearly wasn’t totally present.
Kevin glances downward at his own layered ensemble and concedes with a tilt of his head and a shrug of his shoulders.
“Oh!” Dean says. “And Spock is part alien. That’s why he’s got the ear thing going on.” Dean gestures to his own ears and Cas gets a goofy little smirk on his face. Dean ignores it. “He’s half human, half Vulcan.”
all over again—”
The first month is bad.
straight up his—”
Howdy folks! The update took a little longer than I wanted but it's here now! Chapter 9 is in the pipes as well. Thanks for your support and your patience! I'm coming back to Supernatural after a long time away and it's been quite the journey.
The two of them sit and watch the movie for a while without talking. Dean looks over to his right every couple of seconds to check on his friend.  The antihistamines haven’t won the battle just yet. Cas keeps jolting himself awake. He’ll be almost out, barely clinging to awareness, and then shake or push himself into a more upright position. Dean rolls his eyes. Khan appears to The Enterprise before Cas speaks again. When he does, he slurs in an almost unintelligible fashion.
Supernatural is not my brainchild and I don't own any of the characters depicted below. Like the proverbial boy on the ant hill, I just like to watch through my magnifying glass as they squirm and beg me to leave them alone. *ahem*
There were long kisses that seemed to burn and ended in huffs of shortened breath. There were little kisses, like the first, to act as pauses and silent confirmations. There were kisses placed over eyelids and cheekbones and foreheads. There was a moment when Dean wondered if angels could get hickies and soon proved that, indeed, they could. Their mouths began to blur around the edges and a group of heavy clouds rolled in. These formations seemed to be made solely of static electricity and when their rain started to fall it tasted like warm cherries and pastry.
Dean.
“A sneaky little
“What the hell?” Sam laughs and inches away from both Charlie and Cas.
“Really?” Dean’s face lights up even more than it already has. He’s not even trying to hide his enthusiasm and he looks ten years younger for it.
” Dean asks of what might just be the smallest revolver he’s ever seen.
Cas peaks out from behind his pile and appears terrified by the prospect.
“Enlighten me.”
“I only know where he took the car. After that, it’s anyone’s guess.”
"I don't know, maybe whoever murdered you and threw you in a ditch, considering I thought you were
“I mean…
When Charlie turns back to look at Dean he’s staring at her rather incredulously.
to have a spell with that kind of clout lying around?”
Dean came to this conclusion after downing and then promptly vomiting up a couple bottles of the stuff.
Cas’s arms drop. They hang by his sides, limp as a rag doll’s.
He’s slowly learning that maybe an equestrian oral inspection should be the new protocol.
“So, Admiral Kirk and Captain Spock have a history?” Cas asks through half-lidded eyes.
“Yes. They used to serve together on the S.S. Enterprise – that’s the big ship they’re on now. Kirk was Captain, Spock was first officer, and that other man from before –”
down.”
“Are you sure he wasn’t… uh, just being Cas?” asks Sam.
“It’s about your angel, actually.”
“You wanna know what’s going on then?” Dean asks.
Charlie doesn’t have much time to respond as Cas rounds the nearest clothing rack and the cashier tells her the total, but Dean swears he sees some of the burden lift from the lines of her face. Not much. Just a little.
“Yeah, yeah,” says Sam. “But Chuck stopped printing after Dean… well…” He looks at Dean apologetically. Dean dismisses it with a wave of his hand. Sam continues.
Kevin laughs a little too hard.
“Keep your shirt on – not you Cas. You go take yours off – This is on me.”
And Cas.
“Oh my God, you guys should let me take Cas shopping! Can I?” Charlie grips Cas’s sleeve like a two-year-old and hops up and down. “Can I? Can I please?!?”
He prayed to an angel who couldn’t possibly hear.
“Give or take an hour.”
Crowley relocates his sense of humor.
“I don’t know. When are you making it?” Dean fires back. Crowley’s been getting on his last nerve lately. Ever since Charlie left, really. Maybe she’d thrown fuel on the back on the fire with her suspicions. Or maybe Dean’s just about fucking had it with a certain someone rearranging his t-shirt drawer when he’s not around.
“Oh, I don’t know, let’s see. You refuse to help with the tablet. You scream at a kid who’s given up his whole life to give us a fighting chance – to give
“We can’t just throw him in the dungeon, Dean,” says Sam, slamming shut his book. A small cloud of dust erupts from the pages.
The clearing opens up to a cottage as neglected as the trail leading to it. The windows are caked with dirt, the door kicked-in and barely clinging to its rusted hinges. Dean sidesteps toward the structure. The siding hangs loose from the outside walls and the porch slopes inward, warped from years and years of moisture. Dean's heart races. His stomach fills with the familiar acid burn of adrenaline. Slowly, he makes it up the collapsing porch stairs, over the rotting floorboards, and stops to the left of the doorway. He takes a moment to breath, to observe his surroundings. The forest seems to go quiet.
heavy
P.S. [DISCLAIMER] I know nothing about guns. I know I live in Texas. I feel like I should have some sort of inherent knowledge of firearms, but I don't.
“We’re not saying it is, Kevin,” says Sam.
Sam and Dean glare at her.
There were years spent slicing through the haze of cannabis and wading in and out of drunken consciousness. There were addictions and vices that he’d vehemently deny ever having if questioned about. There were times when he’d been desperate – desperate for cash and for contact and for intimacy. These desperations would sometimes culminate in promiscuous transactions taking place behind run-down gas stations. They were dimly lit affairs. So many of them drug initiated escapades. Dean remembers skin and the stench of dirt. The grip of sweating twenties in his hand. The exact number of these kinds of exchanges he’s been a part of over the years escapes him. It’s enough to be significant. It’s enough that he used to go in for the odd HIV screening when he blew through a town with a decent hospital.  And he doesn’t know why he’s thinking about those experiences. They weren’t all exactly pleasant. Not to mention he hasn’t done something like that in… what, seven years? Nearly a decade. That’s enough time to change, Dean thinks. That’s enough time to warrant a shift in someone’s needs, someone’s interests, someone’s desires.
“Well, that’s where the series
The two spend the next hour or so arguing about the merits of different television programming. Cas interrupts every couple of minutes or so by appearing in a new set of clothes. Charlie makes comments on his appearance, asks how he feels in whatever garb she’s shoved him into, and eventually ushers him back into his stall. Despite the repetitive nature of this proccess, It’s not as excruciatingly boring as it could be and it
.” She says her last words pointedly and flicks her eyes toward the kitchen.
“Liar, liar…” Dean mumbles as he and Cas follow her to the fitting rooms.
“The blue,” says Dean. “Definitely.” He says it without thinking.
TW: Blood
The curtain of the dressing stall slides open. Dean tenses immediately, but Cas has thankfully shed the skintight jeans of before for a more practical pair. He also wears a hoodie layered beneath a leather jacket and Charlie is beside herself. She slides off the couch again to circle around him, making adjustments here and there and tugging at the clothes. While she prattles on about ‘fit’ and ‘style,’ Dean allows his thoughts to wander. Charlie’s right – about the tracking being unreliable. Crowley could easily stash his phone around Lebanon before jetting off to someplace shadier.
He sets the water down on the coffee table again. And maybe it’s just that it’s late and they’re close and Dean can smell the scent of Irish Spring soap wafting off of Cas’s skin, but he suddenly can’t sit there anymore. He pops off the couch so fast that Cas jumps a little. Sleep is already pulling at his eyelids. By contrast, Dean is wide awake and any hope he has of getting back to sleep is dwindling. He needs a distraction. The TV calls to him with its promise of mindless entertainment. He ducks behind the table they’ve moved to support the monitor, and rummages through a cardboard box sat there on the floor. It’s filled with the DVD’s they’ve collected during their stint at The Bunker. He takes his time searching for something to preoccupy his mind and The Complete Star Trek Film Collection catches his eye. He grabs the thick case from the corner of the box. It was a birthday present from Sam in retaliation for the Harry Potter Box Set he’d gifted his brother at Christmas. They were both dorks at heart. They both just hated to admit it.
Totally not FOUR MONTHS LATE.
“Awesome doesn’t even
When someone or something changes you without your consent, righting that wrong can consume you. It can become your
“Well, like you said, people have been falling from the sky lately – angels, to be exact – and those angels are kind of angry about, you know, getting chucked outta the heavenly gates.”
Dean nods his head and considers asking Charlie whether or not she’d be willing to throw some of that 1-percenter cash his way, but she keeps talking – barreling through her words.
“Dude, it’s your body,” he’d said.
Dean mumbles a reply and shoves a forkful of eggs into his mouth. Eventually Cas settles in the chair beside him and scrapes the last of the available food onto his plate. They all eat in silence. It’s not like any of them have much to report. Crowley’s the only one who’s seen the outside world in a fortnight and they get all of their serious intel from Garth. There are requests to pass the pepper or the salt. Dean catches Sam giving Crowley a meaningful look when Cas offers to refresh Dean’s coffee. And of course Crowley would have gone and told Sam all about their little tiff. Of course those two would assume there was some sort of lingering tension between he and Cas. Ridiculous. Dean smiles when Cas returns with his full mug and thanks him. No tension there. Still, Sam continues to watch them throughout the meal.
“You think I don’t understand the gravity of the situation?” Cas asks with venom. “Do you think that I don’t know how poor my judgment has been? I
“Come in,” He says, motioning for Dean to pass through the door. Dean does so and quickly takes in the room. It looks a lot like his – everything neat and tidy and in its place. Cas doesn’t have a lot of possessions, but the few he does are well taken care of. His trench coat is hung on the back of the closet door, visible and at the ready. A place of honor.
Once more, I don't own Supernatural or any of the characters I've decided to take for a spin in this work. Which sounds dirty. It's not. I promise.
“What?!” asks Dean, frowning.
A pause.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean is dealing.
Another tense moment fills the air with the sounds of caught breath. Cas opens his mouth to speak, his eyes half-lidded, but not in their usual squint. He’s about to say something when—
“What?” Dean can’t believe he’s actually just heard that come out of her mouth.
“Ready,” Dean replies.
“No, but, I’d maybe like it somewhere else,” he said shyly. “Would that be alright?”
“Exactly! I felt bad. Every fandom deserves its
“Do you want me to go talk to him?”
Charlie sighs.
“It’s rough,” he concedes. “But we’re working on it.”
A few days after the initial angel exodus, Garth had called. Despite how long he’d been MIA, he opened the conversation, not with a “hello,” or an “I’m alive,” but with an earsplitting cry of “IDJITS!” Dean didn’t even bother asking how Garth knew
“Just—” Dean sighs. “Just don’t ask him anything else about the tablet, alright? You got a question, come to me.”
“You’re damn straight I’m angry!”—and Dean was yelling now. He hadn’t wanted to yell, but he couldn’t help it. It all came boiling out of him—“You betrayed us! You betrayed us and then you
Dean stares at him, incredulous. Kevin, Sam, Crowley, Cas – they’re all driving him nuts with their secrets and their mood swings. An irritation Dean didn’t even know was fully there bubbles to the surface and he can’t help but voice it.
“Charlie!”
he thinks.
In anyone else this scene might have been a calming one. It only put Dean on edge. Something was off. Something was here. And then Dean saw him.
“So you just steal from the richest, most powerful men in the world on a daily basis?” Dean grabs the remaining clothes and follows Charlie toward the front of the store. When they toss the jumbled mass of hangers onto the countertop, the cashier slaps her magazine down with unnecessary force and glares at them through narrowed eyes.
“Not molesting. Aggressively loving.”
“Pleeeeeeeeeeeease, Dean? You know how I love a good dressing room montage.”
“Where.”
“What did you say, Dean?”
"Are you
Dean jumps into action. He springs toward the fridge and reaches to slide his hand along the top. He finds the hidden pistol there and cocks it as he sprints through the library, into the control room, and up the staircase. As he approaches the door, he looks down at the room below him. Sam lifts a shotgun from where it’s been leaning against the wall and nods as if to say “I gotcha.” Cas stands next to Sam completely weaponless and Dean wants to scream for him to get back into the kitchen. He doesn’t. A fear settles in Dean’s stomach. It’s a fear he’s well accustomed to. This could be it for the bunker – for his home. He’s never been allowed creature comforts before. Why did he foolishly think this time would be any different?
Charlie breaks the tension in the room. There seems to have been a lot of that today, despite Dean’s best efforts.
” Sam echoes.
Dean hangs up the phone. He taps over to his text messages.
Dean paused. “I could tell you. I could tell you if you weren’t a pile of angel dust. But I can’t even pray to you now, can I? Nobody hears it now, Cas. Nobody.”
Cas looks sheepish and ducks his head against his chest. His erect posture falls and he slides from the arm of the couch onto the cushion next to it. There’s a soft groan from the frame of the sofa. If it were any shorter, Dean’s feet would be in Cas’s lap.
“Christ, I don’t hate you.”
Kevin laughs again and the sound breaks the tension. Crowley inclines his head to his former business partner and lifts his wine glass. Sam’s eyes flick from Dean to Cas and back again. Soon, however, Sam has little time to gawk. Kevin finally does what he’s been threatening to do for the last hour and topples out of his seat and onto the floor. This prompts him to laugh even harder and Sam stoops to his aid. Cas edges forward into the room and Dean takes a large swig of his scotch. It burns on the way down and he revels in the temporary discomfort.
“You could at least let me help you rig up a decent car tracker,” says Charlie. She stares at Dean’s jittery fingers for a moment and flashes a quick smirk before burying it under a look of genuine concern.
“Fucking Hell!”
“Definitely,” she says. “They’re not very difficult to hand-make if you’ve got the right materials.”
“Jesus, twenty? You weren’t nearly so pissy at twenty. Were you?” Dean walks over to Sam’s table and drops into a chair beside his brother.
“Good,” says Cas. “Familiar.” He smiles a little.
“I’m sorry about that,” he says, taking a few steps to bend and retrieve the mostly-intact stem of the wine glass. “I’ll clean it up.”
“What?” she asks.
Sam’s no longer bedridden.
Cas says nothing. However, the comment seems to remind Charlie of her preoccupation with the man, and she turns to him. Something about what she sees makes her furrow her brow.
“Those were dark times,” says Kevin.
“That all?” Relief unfurls in the pit of Dean’s stomach and something else too. Something Dean can’t quite place, but it hits him low.
“Closing statements?”
,” Dean says dryly, squeezing the bridge of his nose.
“I’m gonna finish this up,” says Sam, pointing to the mess on the table. “Give me like an hour, alright?”
Garth?”
“Sorry. I just really like that line.”
“Ready?” Cas asks in a dangerous tone.
He sneaks a look at Cas and again finds him rigid with frustration. Dean swivels his head toward the road again and whispers something under his breath. Cas hears the murmur over the rush of the wind.
Charlie looks overly affronted.
“I am no longer an angel… nor am I in any way your child”
“Uh…”
Dean ends the call and turns his attention to Cas who looks, despite his established age, like a sullen teenager.
Before Cas can ask the question, Dean answers it.
Cas smiled in a half-broken way and before Dean could process what was happening he felt the angel’s arms close around him in a fierce hug. It took a second, but then Dean wrapped his arms around Cas in return and buried his face in the lapel of that familiar tan coat.
They aren’t using real blades of course. Dean found a whole store of wooden training knives in the closet of one of the bunker’s many rooms. They’re sleek, made from polished redwood, and they feel good in hand. Cas absentmindedly flips his around when they stop to take a rest or guzzle water— which is more often than Dean would like to admit. He may occasionally find a grey hair, or notice his laugh lines growing in number. But just because Sam makes a point of sticking to a rigorous exercise routine and Kevin can eat 3,000 calories a day and
Some Production Notes: I haven't actually watched past Season 10 and this fic takes place in the aftermath of Season 8. I have extremely limited knowledge regarding what happened in the 5 seasons I missed out on so, any similarities in the plot are purely coincidental. And also evidence that I easily could have written for this nightmare show that I have apparently sold my soul to... again.
I love you all dearly for waiting patiently and continuing to support me with your comments and kudos. Seriously. You're all stars. Each and every one of you.
“Yeah. Whatever.” Kevin huffs, reaching down to violently unplug his laptop from the wall outlet. “I don’t know what else I expected from you.”
The worst part is Dean really doesn’t know what to tell her. He clears his throat. The woman’s almost through ringing up the clothes. Cas is probably on his way to the front of the store by now. He feels pressured. Does he spare Charlie further anxiety over the matter or does he tell it to her straight? Does he protect or does he confide? He’s hit this wall so many times before. With Sammy and Bobby and Cas and Lisa and even John. For the first time, he chooses neither option. He aims somewhere in the middle and hopes it’s worth the shot.
“Sorry. I just. I’m a big fan.” She smiles.
Dean takes a look at the options. They’re both henleys and almost identical beyond their color. One is a purple, the other a deep and royal blue.
Cas ascends the stairs and disappears down the main hallway.
“But you can’t. You can’t go back.”
Cas is across from Dean now, poised on his bare feet, his eyes alight again. The wooden knife in his hand twirls as if by its own volition and Dean’s palms sweat. His own knife feels like it might slide out of his grip at any second.
“Yes,” says Sam, “good. We could all use a little ‘good’ right now.”
Cas’s smile fades away and he’s left looking just as embarrassed as before.
Sam is getting better. That, at least, is a worry off of Dean’s shoulders. It seems that once the trials are truly abandoned, they release the doer from their Herculean grip. Sam’s progress is slow, but each day he can stomach a little more food, walk a little further, smile through the pain with less falsehood. The bunker is a blessing. Dean can only imagine how much worse things would be if he were carting Sam around in the Impala—from motel to motel— and watching him cough up a lung in the back seat. He isn’t quite sure how the bunker is able to keep the worst at bay – but it does. Nobody comes looking for them at their sanctuary.
been hiding for a reason. The angels aren’t showing any signs of slowing their roll.
“Nice to meet you Kevin,” says Charlie, turning to Dean with a painfully neutral expression. There’s another lull in the conversation. “Well. This is just a party!”
“Jesus, Cas. How long have you been awake for?”
Silence.
“When I said you don’t get a free pass, I was saying you’re not fucking invincible! You can’t be reckless! If you die – you die and I don’t know if any kind of demon deal or act of God’ll bring you back from that. You don’t get a free pass to act like an idiot all the damn time anymore!”
’) Sam and Crowley enter the kitchen. Crowley seems utterly bemused at the singing hunter, but Sam catches on quickly and joins in as Dean reaches the second chorus.
He stretches his neck a little and spots Cas out of the corner of his eye pulling the sweaty t-shirt from his back. There, between his shoulder blades, is an anti-possession tattoo. They’d taken him to get it almost immediately after The Fall and at Cas’s insistence. There had been an affordable parlor two cities over and Dean had agreed to drive. The place smelled of an old ash tray, but the resident tattoo artist was competent. She hadn’t even blinked when Dean pulled aside the collar of his shirt to explain what they wanted. If she made any assumptions, she didn’t voice them. But just as she had lowered her disposable razor to shave Cas’s chest for the transfer, he’d stopped her.
That place had been so easy. So had those moments. So had kissing Cas.
“Crowley has requested we bleach the grout,” says Cas.
“Oh my god. Oh my
Dean laughs.
“Do you know where he went? Is there anything around the area that could clue us in?”
Charlie sits in the back and flops her arm out the left window, occasionally lifting it up to let her hand ride on the wind. Cas is in the passenger seat, staring out at the landscape with a perturbed look etched into his brow. His shoulders are tense, his arms tucked to his sides. Dean watches him for a moment too long and Cas turns to meet his gaze. Dean quickly whips his head back to stare over the dashboard. He doesn’t want Cas to think he’s worrying… but he’s worrying. Shifting his grip on the wheel, Dean sarcastically wonders what the former angel could

He starts the car before anyone even realizes he’s left.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Dean asks, snatching the bottle out of her reach. “You’re our guest.”
And then their lips made contact for the very first time in just about the chaste-est kiss that Dean could ever recall being a part of. It was short and soft and when they pulled their heads back Dean heard Cas quietly gasp. This was what he’d been missing. Was the hole inside of him really so easily filled? He figured there was only one way to find out for sure.
“Oh no, no, no. Don’t you even think about going after them.”
"Ow, shit!" He spends the next couple of minutes balanced against the trunk, pulling burrs out of his jeans. How did Cas do it -- trudge through this for eight long hours and in the midst of a heat wave too? No water in his system? No food either? He should have honestly faired much worse than he had, but other than a curable case of heat stroke and a ravenous appetite, Cas had been fine -- was fine. For the most part.
“Night, Cas.”
As usual, this chapter would not be nearly so bearable if it weren't for my charming beta,
More silence.
“Good. Now hand me that broom before I throw up. No chick flick moments
“Got what?” asks Kevin.
“I’m sorry – hey, I really am.”
Cas pulled out of their hug and looked at Dean in a way that made him feel utterly transparent. He could almost sense Cas boring holes into his forehead and rooting around in his brain. And that’s when it hit Dean like a wall of paved cement. Words were hard. Words didn’t ever come out right. Not even Cas could manipulate them to his ultimate will. They always left something to be desired. Actions though— actions were almost scrutable on occasion. So, he looked at Cas and let go of every barrier between him and the things he’d been squashing since birth. He just felt. He just let himself feel something for once.
, Dean!” Charlie pleads before turning to address the man on her arm. “Or do you wanna wear plaid flannel shirts for the rest of your life?”
Dean thinks.
“It’s kind of a rare shirt,” she offers.
He hears the muffled sound of morning voices from outside his bedroom door. Sam and Crowley’s mumbles linger for a moment before fading down the hall. Dean supposes he’s done enough introspection for one day and moves to slip his Men of Letters robe over his pajamas. It comforts him. It’s his. He looks around his room.
“Well, no. He kept writing but he – Edlund didn’t keep publishing. Not
Cas jolts upright at the mention of his name. He seems to have been completely ignorant to their game of “monkey in the middle.”  In fact, he looks pretty out of in general, as if he’s having a hard time staying awake. The disoriented way in which he avoids eye-contact is hard to ignore. Noticing this, Sam shoots a quick glance at Dean before turning his attention back to Charlie. She’s strutted around to him and has her hand outstretched. With a shrug and a smirk he relinquishes the bottle and Charlie grabs another off the table in front of him. She appears to make her own assessment of Cas’s behavior and gets that familiar glint in her eye. The whole thing is pretty obnoxious and Dean can’t help but roll his eyes when Charlie and Sam share what he’s sure is meant to be a ‘meaningful’ look.
Had he always wanted that?

. She teaches me how to write less like an illiterate mountain troll and for that, I am grateful.
It just wasn’t a whiskey sort of evening.
Thanks to my good friends Emily, Balke, and Reid for reading this whole fic during our "Fanfiction Book Club" nights and to Emily and Balke for helping me edit the new chapters. Y'all enable my supernatural bullshit and for this I am grateful.
Castiel. On the opposite end of the field from the faceless man sat an angel in a trench coat and a sloppy tie. Dean froze for a second. He wondered if it was all a trick. Was he sure he was dreaming? This wasn’t so out of the ordinary. Cas
“You’re shutting me out!” Dean realizes too late the mistake he’s made. He should have said ‘us.’ You’re shutting
“Hacked, shmacked. I did what I had to do.”
“Because it’s none of my goddamn business.”
“Oh,” says Dean.
In a rare turn of events, he drives the speed limit the whole way home.
“You’re angry,” murmured Cas.
Crowley’s voice is hushed and the insistence of his and Sam’s discussion peaks Dean’s interest. Rather than strolling into the library as he’d intended to do only moments before, he pauses outside. The lights in the control room are dim and he finds it all too easy to conceal himself in the shadows. Dean presses against one of the walls and while he can’t see into the library, he can hear into it – the flipping of pages, the occasional groan of someone shifting in their chair, and the muffled hum of music that bleeds from Kevin’s earphones. Every noise reverberates crisply through the archway of the room. It’s as if the space has been miked and amplified specifically for use in eavesdropping.
“Good to know you’re still a bad liar,” Dean deadpans. He appraises his friend thoughtfully and something about Cas’s manner flicks a switch in his brain.
“Done, now let’s
The destination at which he's meant to have arrived appears to be a bank of trees running along the highway. He pulls over and steps out of the Impala. The road is deserted, but not quiet. Birds, squirrels, insects chirp and shout from the tree line while Dean circles around the hood of the car.
Sam clears his throat and shakes Dean out of his daydream. His brother’s got that puppy-dog look on his face – the one he makes when he’s worried about something. For a brief second Dean’s terrified that Sammy might still be sick and trying to hide it, but – no. That’s not right. Sam wouldn’t look near this perturbed if the trouble was his own. And he hasn’t stopped staring at Cas since Charlie left the room. Dean’s about to ask him what’s wrong when Cas abruptly stands and pushes his chair under the table. He hasn’t changed into his new clothes and is still wearing Dean’s t-shirt. There’s a fresh beer stain on the hem.
He felt himself being forcefully pulled from Castiel’s hands. His eyelids trembled and shut against the increasing downpour.
“Maybe that was a bad example,” Crowley concedes. “If you were in D—”
It’s a good day for a drive. Even if the drive is just back the way they came. Thick clouds slide gently across a sickeningly blue sky, blocking the sun every now and again to cast huge amorphous shadows over the highway. The light comes and goes as they make their way east – bursting through the back window of the ‘67 before fading away again. It seems to dissolve and reappear like magic. The spring air is pleasantly cool and Dean rolls down the windows of the Impala to take in some well-deserved fresh air.
Dean starts to inspect the area and stomps through a patch of sand burrs, the little thorn-ed stickers clutching his pant legs and scratching his calves through the denim.
Dean sits back in his chair. He wasn’t expecting the hostility to emerge so immediately. He considers the man across from him. His mind lingers on the word ‘man’ for a second too long. This isn’t going to be fun.
Phew! *wipes brow* This chapter is finally done! I really enjoyed writing this and I hope it shows! I've gotten a ton of encouragement from readers and I thank every single damn one of you. I was originally going to try and fit more into this chapter, but I think it stands on it's own fairly well. So I'll leave you with this and promise the next update is on it's way!
“What are you doing up?” Dean asks.
“I hate you,” she mumbles into the fabric of his robe.
“I appreciate it! I do, but… Anyway, you’re a human now. You gotta sleep too, sometime.”
“Dean, what’s going on?” Cas asks, getting to his feet.
wasn’t something he admitted to himself. He always tried desperately to dismiss his feelings as being of brotherly intent. His stomach and groin often told him otherwise, but that wasn’t overly difficult to disregard. He cared about Cas, sure. He wanted Cas to be around as much as possible. When Cas had been alive he’d caught himself considering calling the angel to him for more and more frivolous reasons. Sometimes he’d allowed himself to fantasize about what life with Cas would be like. Traveling in the Impala with Cas. Watching movies at Bobby’s with Cas. Arguing over radio stations with Cas. Sharing motel rooms with Cas.
And somehow Dean understands.

Anyway, I'm hoping to have chapter five up in a week -- two weeks tops. I'm not near popular enough to warrant having a fanfiction blog, but I do post occasional updates on
“OH NOW YOU’RE BEING A GRUMPY GUS. I KNOW JUST THE THING TO CHEER YOU UP!”
Bile burned at the back of Dean’s throat. He’d thrown up plenty of booze, but so much of it had already hit his bloodstream by the time Sam had arrived. He felt restless and heavy at the same time. His eyes drooped, but his back ached from where Sam’s elbow had been pressed into it. It had been the only way to keep him upright for a while there. Dean blinked a few times in the semi-darkness and felt himself drifting.  It was a cool minute before he realized that his view was no longer of their moldy motel walls.
“And this anger applies to Cas, how?” She rolls the back of Cas’s jeans down to check that tag too. Cas squirms and answers her query.
“Dude,” Dean says, turning back to Sam. “Are you okay? You seem… jumpy. I don’t know.”
“I… I guess I do.” Dean must look stupid – all wide-eyed and thrown for a loop – but it’s an odd thing to hear and discuss so casually. A voice in his head urges him to run
“C-Could I come too?” Kevin is absolutely dripping with desperation and blatantly eyeballing Charlie.
Dean clears his throat and wills Cas to make eye contact. Cas does not oblige. What follows are a tense couple of minutes. Crowley reenters from the kitchen and senses something’s up, something he’s not needed for. He quickly places an overfull wine glass in front of Castiel and grabs Sam and Kevin’s many beer bottles on his way back out of the room. A few seconds pass before Dean hears the faint clinking of dishes and sighs. He silently wishes for Crowley to develop a hobby that doesn’t involve vigorous housework. ‘Clean’ is one thing. ‘Spotless’ is obnoxious. But one problem at a time. Cas and he are alone for the first time in what seems like forever and it’s time to rip off the bandage. It’s always best to do it in one fell swoop.
“RISE AND SHINE TABLET BOY! ISN’T IT A GREAT DAY TO BE ALIVE?” Dean grins like the cat that got the cream.
” Dean sings.
He’d made the executive decision to offer Charlie his room for the night and to claim the couch in the den for himself. Charlie had protested, but he’d insisted. They had more rooms of course, the bunker seemed to be a never-ending maze of a facility, but none of those rooms had been cleaned yet. They all remained frozen in time, the dust collecting on the decades-old fabric of the beds. He didn’t want Charlie holing up in an uninspected room only to discover a nest of super-spiders or else a demon who’d been tucked away there in the fifties for safe keeping and then forgotten about. Not to mention, Dean’s slept on far worse than the den’s luxurious sofa and he’ll probably only catch a few hours at most.
seemed like a decent model. Or at least according to Google. If my use of the gun is grossly inaccurate, I suppose you could let me know. But really you should take it up with Google.
“Oh, shut it!” she says, blushing a little. “I like playing dress up, so sue me!” She settles on the vacant arm of the couch and tucks her feet up on the cushion before continuing. “It’s like having a real live Barbie doll—”
“Because we don’t know what this means, yet.”
“So! ...How are you guys… uh, doing?” Charlie asks with a furtive look in her eyes.
“Well,” says Dean, “for starters you don’t keep it bottled up inside until you go all
“Dean?”
There’s a short, slightly awkward pause.
“I don’t know. I don’t think we were speaking when I was twenty.”
Dean nods. He isn’t buying Sam’s bullshit for a second, but it’s late and he’s not in the mood. Whatever his brother’s trying to cover up is just gonna have to wait for another day. He lets the subject drop.
he thinks.
“Of course,” shrugs Cas. “If it’s rare, as you say, whoever wears it should… appreciate it.  I’m afraid I don’t quite qualify in that aspect.” He glances down at his front and smiles a sad little smile.
“Then tell me –
“Well, if you asked
“That’s the spirit! What do you say, can I keep him?” Charlie pouts her lips and turns back toward Dean. He glances around for any kind of support. Sam just smirks away, Kevin looks like he’d follow Charlie to the ends of the earth at this point, and Crowley seems to have disappeared – likely, to busy himself with more chores. Dean heaves a large sigh.
Kevin flips Sam the middle finger.
“The fans!” Charlie throws her hands up and begins to pace. “They’d been waiting so patiently for so long. They never gave up hope on getting a resolution to the series. You should’ve seen the forums. They even petitioned the publishers to release more of the books, but the publishers didn’t have anymore. Carver Edlund never sent them the manuscripts he’d promised. So I did a little digging… figured out his real name… gave myself access to his online backup service—”
“Yeah. Why’d you flip?”
Dean snorts and shakes his head.
So hey guys! Here's the new chapter!
For being so worried about his new form, Cas sure knows how to handle himself. He shifts easily from stance to stance – never losing balance – never faltering. He makes eye contact with Dean as they tussle and a dormant flame seems to awaken in him. His stare becomes brutal, like it was in the days before his rebellion. And this should probably scare Dean. But there are things that just stay with a person, no matter what. For some it’s a quirk or a trait. For some it’s riding a bike. Dean never did get around to figuring that one out, but for him it’s knowing instinctively when to lift his arm to block a jab. It’s sensing an ambush before it happens. It’s being the first to fire in a Mexican standoff and walking away unscathed. Cas offers little to fear with his intensity. It’s an intensity his opponent mirrors.
“Yeah? And who’s he?”
He reaches slowly for the door handle with his left hand and grips the gun tight in his right. He pulls it open in one fluid motion and unflinchingly trains his pistol on their visitor. To his surprise, Charlie Bradbury stands before him also brandishing a gun. Well, if you can call it one.
“Nightmare,” he replies at last.
“Always nice to meet a fan.” He smiles and winks at her.
“You’re doing exactly what you always do! Exactly what always gets you in trouble!”
“What?” says Charlie a little too quickly. She drops Cas’s sleeve. “Um, uh, the books, remember?”
Dean isn’t sure what he’s planned to say next – wings? Grace? – but whatever it is, he doesn’t say it. The air is sucked out of the room like someone took a vacuum to the doorway. Sam’s eyes widen and all laughter stops abruptly. The temperature of room suddenly feels much too warm. Dean turns to stare up at Cas, who stands in the entryway like a wax statue. The angel continues to smile.
Twenty minutes into the drive he stops wanting to bash his head against the steering column.
It’s why the Winchesters fit so well amongst the sloping hills.
Dean realizes she’s been working up to asking this question all morning. He reads the heartbreak on her face like map. She’d reacted quickly in order to lighten the mood when Cas had dropped the angel bomb earlier, but she hadn’t ignored it. She’d been processing, thinking, formulating a plan of action. That’s what Charlie does. But Dean’s never seen her this unsure before, this

“Charlie?” Dean says with concern, “Why are you molesting our angel?”
Dean grabs the keys to the Impala off the table and jets out of the library.
sleep in – but he shuts down that train of thought pretty quickly.
Here he is. Dean Winchester. Inveterate liar. Hopeless alcoholic. Traitor to Heaven.  And he, of all people, has been charged with taking care of this once powerful being. He’s tucking a goddamn, certified Angel of The Lord into bed. And it’s funny, in more ways than one, because Dean kind of gets it. He gets why Cas has always offered so freely to watch out for him while he sleeps. Their friendship – profound bond, whatever – comes with responsibilities. Before, when Cas was the superior figure, Dean imagined he felt the looming concern of the angel wherever he went. Cas was always… well,
“…Best friends…” Cas repeats the words slowly, rolling them around in his mouth before speaking.
“Hey! MacGyver is a classic!”
“This,” Charlie answers without hesitation, “is a Ruger LCR and it’s awesome and why in the
The artist had shrugged and Cas had flipped over to lie down on the bench instead.
“If it becomes relevant to the investigation, I’ll say something, okay? I just really don’t want to fuck with things. Things are…”
” asks Dean, one eyebrow raised. “Wow, yeah. Never pegged you as a Barbie girl… Heh, Barbie Girl—”
“Damn!” Charlie grins. “I was really hoping I could get video of that happening.”
Dean nods. “Sure.”
“This isn’t goodbye,” Cas whispered against Dean’s jaw.
“Oh bloody –
“It was about his grace. I found something interesting in the tablet.” Kevin walks further into his corner and scans the notes, eventually pulling a crumpled slip of paper off the wall. “It talks about the essence of the grace, the significance of it, blah blah blah. But then here”—Kevin holds the paper in front of Dean’s face and stabs at it with his pointer finger—“it gets a little confusing. The tablet goes on about how if a grace is removed, but ‘twice gone’ or ‘unwanted,’ no restoration can be made. I’m just not totally sure what that means. So I took it to Cas.”
And the best place to find evidence is the scene of the crime.
Cas frowns and watches Dean press buttons on his alarm clock. “Kevin didn’t tell you?”
“A decent and durable cellphone – or really any device with GPS capabilities, basic understanding of how a car battery works, and internet access.”
“Ahhh, let’s go talk in the library for a second, Kevin.” Sam raises his eyebrows at Dean and then ushers their young prophetic protégé into the other room.
“Dude… I’m not even gonna
“Oh, I
to cover it. You’re getting this shirt Cas. You’re getting it and then I’m going to steal it.” He finally looks up from the t-shirt design and realizes how close he and Cas are. Also, that he’s practically pulling the shirt up and over his friend’s chest. He drops the hem he’s been clutching and takes a little step back – pretending to cough into his fist as he does.
Sam’s not the only one with secrets, after all.
The angels are the problem.
“S’alright,” he grumbles, sliding a hand down his face. With his other hand he reaches back over his head and fumbles with the switch of a lamp. It clicks on and illuminates a smartly dressed living room. In addition to the couch Dean’s currently occupying, the den also houses a plump arm chair, a flat screen tv tucked into one corner, a turntable beside that, and is of course covered wall to wall in books. Built-in shelves line the space and hold, not hunting texts, but pleasure reads. They’re alphabetized by author starting on the far right wall and run clockwise around the entire room. Dean had spent a few hours browsing the titles one day and had been floored to uncover a copy of Vonnegut’s very first novel tucked into the stacks:
