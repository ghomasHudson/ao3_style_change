“She did what she did for me and Bucky, but… she likes you, Tony,” Steve says, and his tone is somber again. “Think whatever you want of me, but don’t think she’s not your friend. Or that you can’t trust her.”
He still remembers this one time, a couple of years ago, when for some fortunate reason he got to bury his hand in Tony’s gray hair. All he did was to smooth it back with his fingers, but it felt so wonderful that Steve had to excuse himself and go to his room to have one of the most mind-blowing orgasms of his life, with his hand still tingling from the sensation of caressing Tony’s silver hair.
Steve inhales and exhales. He does it again a few times, until he feels like he’s in control of himself. He lies back down on the blanket, next to Tony. He feels heavy and defeated, tired all of a sudden, and also kind of stupid.
“Tony—” Steve says, coming close to him, cheek to cheek. When he starts speaking again, he’s whispering in Tony’s ear. “I love you. I trust you. I know you know your limits. If you get off on a little pain, that’s fine, and I’m willing to give it to you. I like it too, no point in trying to deny it now. But I know myself. I’m not walking on eggshells around you because I fear you’d up and leave if I give you another bruise during sex. I’m only trying not to put you in serious physical danger. Okay?”
“And don’t you dare call the love of my life an ‘archaeological artifact’ ever again. I was born in 1918, I know what I’m talking about.”
Sometimes I wonder how Howard's genes could create someone like Tony. I imagine mine took over. There's so little of his father in him, except the artificial. Sometimes I observe him and he reminds me of you, Stella, and I wonder if I didn't pass him something of you. If in some way he's yours too. In his name there's something of yours, after all.
Steve releases Tony’s throat and buries his face into Tony’s collarbone, inhaling as deeply as he can, and Tony spares a thought to marvel at Steve’s lung capacity. Tony couldn’t breathe even half as long.
“As a belated apology,” he says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Steve laughs and tells him that he loves him.
Tony gets to work. He takes the fish (four gilt-head breams) out of the fridge, cuts off the heads and cleans the entrails out. It grosses him out a bit; it always does. Mom used to be grossed out too, and maybe he is only because she was. As if she didn’t teach him just the recipe, but the attitude behind the actions as well.
“I need you by my side, Steve. I can’t pretend that’s not true anymore. I need you in every possible way. Even as an Avenger.”
They head back into the bedroom. There’s not much light in the room; Steve closed the shutters to keep out the mugginess of the day, but it’s enough for what they have to do.
“Were you spying on us? Grandmas really don’t know how to pass the time,” Tony replies without missing a beat, rolling his eyes for the sake of the game.
“Already yours,” Tony had said, and he can’t think about this anymore. All of a sudden, it almost makes him sick.
“I can go,” Steve mouths at him after adjusting Maria in her cradle while Tony pretends to listen to the phone.
Tony’s tongue caressing Steve’s, his teeth sinking just enough into Steve’s skin, the callused pads of his fingers rubbing against Steve’s nipple until it hurt.
“Oh. You’re back,” he says, awkward. “Sorry, I... She was crying, so… It seemed wrong to just...” He waits for Tony to come closer, and he passes Maria to him, careful not to touch him. He could hold her up with just one of his hands. “I’m sorry,” he repeats.
Steve is crying, and Tony is pretty sure it’s out of joy, which is not at all what he was expecting.
He tries to speak, but his lips are stuck together, and separating them seems to need a disproportionate amount of force that he doesn’t have.
Steve huffs a little laugh, and helps Tony out of the bathtub, follows him back into the shower. Tony doesn’t feel very steady on his legs, but he grabs his washcloth and lathers it up. He starts scrubbing himself meticulously, like he does every day, his arms first, his neck—
Steve nods, slow and thoughtful. He lets the silence fill the room for a while, and Tony doesn’t say anything.
Steve looks at them and feels like there’s no proof he exists. Like he has nothing to show for himself. Like he isn’t real, too—he’s fading away.
He feels like he weighs so much he could make a hole in the Earth. He feels his muscles spasming, contracting painfully without him instructing them to. He feels weak. He’s sweating; he’s cold and hot at the same time. His mind is slipping away from him, his control faltering.
Everything inside the little house is white, except the floor, the oldest pieces of furniture, the few spots where the ancient stones that make up the little building have been left visible, and the turquoise tiles in the bathroom. Nothing is modern in style, despite Tony’s usual preference. For this place, he wanted something that wouldn’t clash with the rest of the landscape. He wanted something that would fit right in, as if it had always been there.
. But now, Tony thinks about it and wonders if between all the possible universes, in some of those alternative Earths... if there was ever one where him and Steve somehow could make it work.
Tony doesn’t know what this feels like for Sarah. Did she feel them, Steve and Tony? In her head? Is it more physical for her, more a thing of scents and protective touches than feelings? He doesn’t know.
Steve, thinking about how Tony likes to be brought to the very edge of his orgasm and then feeling like it’s being denied to him—and that, just there, that little voice that says,
He meant well. He tried to do the best he could. But that week, that fucking week was so fucking awful and there was no time and no calm and no quiet—and he turned to look at Tony, he turned while Ross was talking so he could look into Tony’s eyes, and he was
Tony’s whole body jerks to the left, away from Steve. The steering wheel follows his hands, the car sways to the wrong side of the road.
Tony seems to read his mind. Tony always seems to read his mind, except when he doesn’t, and they crash and burn and explode and bring the whole world down with them.
Steve kicks the blanket away, swings his legs over the side of the bed, and Tony is hit by the smell of
Loud noises scare him. He jumps in his seat whenever an open window makes a door slam by mistake. But it’s not a problem when he’s in the field. When he’s Iron Man, he’s free.
It hits him suddenly, unexpectedly—until a moment ago he absurdly thought that he could somehow solve this. He can’t. Worse: there’s nothing to solve. Mom wrote those words ages ago. Mom is dead. Nothing can be done to make her life better. Nothing can be done to make her happy.
It was more than he'd ever hoped for. When he was young, he thought he'd be lucky to have a courthouse ceremony. But here he was with an alpha that could give him anything he ever dreamed of.
Tony slid the ring onto his finger. It fit perfectly. They kissed falling back into the bed. Steve's arms wrapped around the alpha’s neck, deepening their connection. They were slow to part.
“Maybe I can reverse engineer it from this. If I figure out the right parts, maybe I can track down his location or least get us one step closer.”
Slowly, they pulled away from each other. Lena got into a waiting taxi, waving goodbye to her family. She already missed them, but things at the lab were finally getting exciting. Lena couldn’t wait to return. She felt like a child anticipating Santa.
Steve laughed. It so rare that he left Natasha speechless. She seemed to have a response for everything.
“I’m getting there,” laughed Lena “The elephant seals had caught Theodore. Big crude animals, who hated all that entered their beach. He’d been imprisoned by the evil Beach Master. Theodore was close to giving up, unaware of how close his friend was. A sharp poke to his side woke him.”
Nat was right. Everything she said was true. It stung deeply but it needed to be spoken and acknowledged. Tears silently leaked down his cheeks.
Tony braced against a railing as the footing began to sway. “Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.”
Barny got up and followed him. “Please don’t run; trying to keep up with you will give me a heart attack."
"Because that's private between your papa and me. You'll have a similar relationship with your doctor," he said.
Why had Steve forgiven him? The question kept on running through his mind, but he couldn’t come up with an answer. There was no logical one he could come up with. If he didn't find an answer it would keep him up for days.
“Yes, I want it. But I want to be me when I accept. I don’t want to be this identity made for me,” said Steve.
“I love you," repeated Steve. It was so unreal saying it. Tony brought him closer. "I owe you an explanation, Tony."
"There's so much information to be gathered that's unrelated to the pregnancy. It's difficult sifting through what may be relative," said Bruce.
"Morning, baby girl." Steve moved his hands away. "Rune is making waffles with your aunts; why don't you go help them."
Tony smirked during the opening scene when Steve clenched his hand. He pulled his hand away from Steve, wrapping his arm around the omega's shoulder instead. Tony pulled a blanket over the two of them. He loved watching old horror movies with Steve it always brought the omega closure to him. It never failed to make him smile when he saw Steve react to the films. The man face down Nazis and countless horrible events without fear, yet pressed close to him when something like The Blob or Jaws. He'd be sure not to share the sight with anyone else.
Steve handed her off to Tony. She whined at to coolness of his armor. Tony’s faceplate lifted. He nuzzled his pup, breathing in her scent. Tony kissed her forehead. It was real. Blood coated her hands.
“That’s all I ask. A relationship is good it will help you build further connections to this era. Maybe one day if you're comfortable we can bring him into one of your sessions,” said Barny.
Tony pulled Steve into a deep kiss, stealing the omega’s breath. He slowly pulled away, touching their foreheads.
Fury rubbed his temples. It should be a personal issue. Spy, assassin, fine, but matchmaker wasn’t skill widely available to him.
“Can’t your favorite godson come to visit? Without you thinking there are alternative motives,” said Tony.
That’s all he said before shutting down and simply stared blankly at his sketchpad. She moved closer to him. Hoping her nearness would provide him with some comfort. She hummed the lullaby Papa used to calm her down.
"You make me unsure. That bothers me in a way which might be fear. I don't know what it is to be scared. It's not something I'm allowed." Winter had had many handlers, but none of them affected him as she did. "Don't cry, that's not what I set out to do."
Steve got to his feet. Instinct refused to let him move from behind his alpha. Loki's armor faded in a mist of golden light. He raised his hands in surrender.
Edith sighed. If Tony trusted her from the start Steve wouldn’t be so suspicious of her now at such a critical time.
Tony left. Steve yawned stretching out. He was starving. Hopefully, something would stay down. He went to the kitchen a made himself breakfast. It was only toast, but he needed something simple that would be easy on his stomach. His breakfast was quiet.
He lifted the virtual segment of Happy’s focus. A pair of dog tags were among the damage. “Any military victims?”
“I wish I had that. To have that connection is better than nothing. But, that doesn’t make your pain greater than mine!” The throb in Tony’s chest stabbed harder, escalating the tightness. His anger made him push past it.
Winter rolled up the tarps, setting them in the sink. The room was pristine. He would incinerate them later. His process was ruined when heard to people coming down the hall. There was no rattle of keys. They were heading in his direction. Winter put on his mask. He had to leave. His protocol overrode his process. He could not be caught.
“Only tests to see if everything is going smoothly. Nothing that will bring harm to you or the baby,” she said.
“Stark is a brilliant man there’s no denying that, but he’s unstable. I would hate to see you hurt by him,” said Barny.
“I have to get going,” he said. Stark wouldn’t tolerate his presence for much longer. “Tell me if you change your mind, Rogers.”
He went into the bathroom, ignoring the blatant filth and got into the shower. The hot water lasted all of five seconds before turning cold. He shut off the water as soon as he was clean and changed into another set of civilian clothes. His hand brushed the fluffy white unicorn he'd gotten the pup. Would he even be allowed to give it to her? He stuffed it to bottom of his bag, again, not wanting to think about what may be happening to the child in his absence.
“No." He looked at the peacefully sleeping omega in his lap; he hated to wake him. "Steve, wake up."
“That’s who I smelled on you,” said Tony. He clenched the steering wheel. Why was he getting possessive? Tony hated the lack of control.
"Totally fine, Sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch. Then at the end of the sentence, I say the wrong cranberry. But sir you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal," said Jarvis.
“At this point, I think nothing would surprise me,” said Steve. His boyfriend flew around in red and gold metal suit. How much more surprising could it get?
Banner picked up the scepter. Unlike the other, Steve didn’t go for a weapon. That wasn’t the solution. They had to deescalate the situation. “Dr. Banner put down the scepter,” he said.
With that Tony hung up. Rhodes had no idea how to process the conversation. There were many surprises in that one less than a minute conversation.
Natasha let herself into the room. Steve was in his dress uniform. The jacket laid next to him. He sat at the end of the bed polishing his shoes.
Natasha went into the hospital room, taking a seat in the chair nearest Steve's bed. The deafening sound machines supporting Steve filled the room. She took his hand, gently squeezing it. "He'll be here soon."
When he regained consciousness he was standing. His arms and legs were zip-tied to a metal bed frame. In front of him was Maya typing away at her computer. They were some kind of dank cinder block lab.
Steve couldn't put into words how nice it was to hear that from someone a bit more outside of his normal social group.
Piper rushed to the front door, knowing her parents didn’t want her interacting with the man, but she was curious. Opening it before her parents could.
After his run, Steve went to the range. Natasha walked in at some point, taking the booth next to him. He lowered his weapon. Steve took off his headphones.
She sat up when she spotted Lena hurrying into the backyard of her home, clearly flustered. There was no harm in listening to one more call.
Cramping brought Steve to his knees. Alpha stepped closer. Steve shook his head. His feral side was starting to take over control.
"Yes, Aunt Natasha and I are going to play." Steve emptied a box of Lincoln Logs in front of her. "Be good."
Tony looked up at him. The alpha looked so defeated. Steve could ask for anything at this moment and Tony would comply. He was that desperate to make up for what he'd done.
Steve's unphased by the outburst. His pup was acknowledged and accepted by its father. That wasn't changing. The reaction was fueled by alpha protective instinct.
Steve relaxed, letting Tony wash him. Once clean and dressed he was more than willing to return to bed. He cuddled up with Piper. She cooed happily, pressing against him.
There’s a three-year jump forward everything that occurred in those will still happen, but at a later on.
Piper watched Winter. His attention was caught in thought. He seemed unaffected by his injuries, but there was something he wasn’t saying.
“Mind explaining these,” said Steve. Dangling from his fingers were a pair of red panties. They were far to short for Steve’s liking. On the hip was a little Iron Man mask.
He paced the room, looking for danger. A gestured fueled by a mixture of paranoia and maternal instincts. When he was sure it was safe he took a seat at the end of the bed. He took off his dress uniform. Tony hung it up for him and tossed him a pair of gym shorts. Steve pulled them on and fell back into the bed.
Rhodey taps at a screen Steve can’t see, then turns to look at him. “Steve, you seem confused about this thing but… we’ve got a pretty busy schedule. So, long story short: Barnes here is gonna get a new arm made at Stark Industries, and then he’s gonna start working on his traumatic memories with the help of technology Tony developed. Hopefully that’ll help eliminate HYDRA’s programming from his brain. That’s it. Barnes wants to do it. And Doctor Sonani is gonna kill us if we don’t get to their lab in five minutes.”
“Hello,” he mumbles, and Steve sighs into the hollow of his throat, breathing hard, muscles taut with exertion.
“Just French and German. And the songs in Irish. Also, I think I’ve heard Rhodey talk to her in Urdu once.”
His hand travels down, his fingers graze Tony’s pubic hair. Tony stirs in his sleep, and after a couple of minutes a grumpy voice slurs, “What’re you doing?”
The sunshine catches in Steve’s hair. Tony smooths it back with his fingers, as delicately as possible, so he doesn’t wake Steve up.
Steve holds Tony tight, his hands roaming on Tony’s back, down and up again and again. His body feels small against Steve’s, he is relaxed but there’s an underlying tension in his bones, Tony is trying to hide it but isn’t doing a very good job of it.
Still, Steve’s distress is so acute that his knot shrinks and he’s able to pull out of Tony earlier than expected.
He squeezes his eyes shut as hard as he can, clenches his jaw with so much force his teeth grit together painfully. He tries to hold it back, but he can’t, and it explodes in his chest like he has a reactor of his own on top of his heart.
Tony looks down. Uh. It looks like part of a paper placemat, the ones they use in cafés and diners. It’s a drawing of Stark tower.
“For her, for her,” Steve says. “But I figured, since she’s your kid and everything... she’s gonna like whales too.”
Steve presses him up against the cold tiles of the bathroom and he grinds his hips against Tony’s ass. He’s half-hard already and Tony smirks at that.
Tony nods, and curls up on the bed, drawing his knees to his chest. Steve’s hand is resting on the mattress, his palm facing up. Tony reaches out slowly, and brushes his fingertips over Steve’s, just enough to feel the heat of his body, just to feel him close, like when—
“No, it wasn’t like that,” he says out loud, in the darkness. Barnes isn’t even an Omega, for fuck’s sake.
“Tony, hey. Look at me, sweetheart.” Steve, caressing his face. He sounds strange,  lost and devastated, but also tangible, like he woke up to find out his worst nightmare is real, like he’s crying too. Tony always makes him cry.
Have you ever listened to it? I assume you have, it was at Sanremo. The melody is full and strong, Martini's voice has an unique power, but the lyrics are maybe the most beautiful part. Please, listen to it if you haven't already. It reminds me so much of our summers, when he watched the stars.
Tony moved his hand to Steve’s stomach. The omega finally started showing. Steve's core muscles softened and a small bump could be seen. It would be unnoticeable most but to someone as intimately knowledgable on every beautiful part of Steve's form as him it was impossible not to notice.
A week did nothing to change the pup. She hadn't gotten back her surety. Even when she was happy, she lacked that
"Oh, I thought that was one of those questions that you aren't supposed to answer? Yes, you are one."
Tony brought Steve into his arms, pushing his husband’s nose into his neck. Steve breathed in his scent, and his muscles unwound. Tony had caught him just before another panic attack could happen. His alpha knew him so well. It felt like he was failing in some omega duty. He pulled away from him.
Steve nodded. He took another test from the box and shut the door of his bathroom. Several minutes passed but he hadn't come out.
Steve took two small water paint canvas from the box in began to work. Without realizing it, he’d painted the night away. Steve leaned back in his chair, stretching out. He yawned. Maybe he’d be able to sleep. He pulled the blankets from the bed and set them up on the floor. Steve woke late the next morning. His back cracked as he turned. There was a vibration from under his pillow. He flipped open his phone. There was a message on the screen from Edith.
Steve wasn’t eager to dive into conversation. If he did say what was going on his mind the night terrors or memories of the war that would flash before his mind even when he was awake, they would say he was crazy. He wasn’t insane. It was taking him some time to adjust. That’s all.
It didn’t take long for it to finish. He grabbed two large bowls and served them both. Thor stared at him. Steve felt embarrassed.
“Sure.” They leaned into each other again. Steve even dared to purr, again; relaxing further when Tony responded in kind.
Steve’s arms were wrapped tightly around him, his arousal pressed against Tony's rear. Tony struggled to get out of Steve’s powerful grip. He showered and dressed. Tony took Steve’s present from the drawer, placing on the bedside table. He glanced back at the sleeping his sleeping omega. Steve would kill him if didn’t say goodbye. He took a seat on the edge of their bed, out of reach Steve’s arms.
"We have to keep him on IV drip Extremis his body sees it as a toxin and recovers every time. I assure you it's a painful process. Your CEO isn't handling it nearly as well. As soon as her body gives up its will to fight. I have to detonation is quite spectacular."
"I don't think any less of you for making that choice. No one should. You were put in an impossible situation. Where you were forced to defy instinct."
Steve let a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. A smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. He may never have a pup, but the ability to know he could was a great comfort.
Winter continued to adjust to the pup’s presence. It was no longer the annoyance it once proved to be. In one week, she’d decorated the entire cell floor with her scribbles. The only placed untouched by her drawings was his corner. There was nothing left from the box of crayons. She was sleeping, now. The pup had a habit of falling asleep between 12:00 and 13:00, for two to three hours.
Tony moved to him. The touch of their skin was electric. They kept as little space between them as possible. Their lips crashed together but it was all too brief. Tony kissed down his stomach. Steve bit his lip as Tony suddenly took him in his mouth. He fought back a scream as Tony’s tongue circled the head of his arousal.
Steve pulled away when the cramping passed. He turned around gently kissing Tony. "I'm going to bed."
"Let's take Piper to meet Peggy tomorrow. Banner won't be done for days. We promised the old bird a visit," said Tony.
Steve put the dishes into the washer and grabbed several protein bars from the cabinet. They were an easy way to take in the calories he needed and had the bonus of being easy to eat while nursing. Piper refused to let him have a real breakfast until she was fed. He placed her on a pillow and brought her to nurse. Steve loved this intimate time with her. It was relaxing for the both of them. Edith believed the reason his PTSD symptoms became less frequent and serious was the powerful cocktail of calming hormones nursing released. It also had an anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effect. His fear was that this calm would break. He was broken from the thought when Piper pulled away early looking up at him worriedly. She must have felt him tense.
Piper fidgeted, uncomfortable. Winter seemed to sense her discomfort and understand. He focused his gaze on the ground. She took off her shirt, shivering when a cold stethoscope pressed against her chest.
“She was, not many remember that. Mom was always overshadowed by Howard. People always seemed to forget all the good she did. She paid for Bert's children to go to college and attended his wife's funeral,” said Tony. He quickly shook off the heavy emotional haze. “I need a drink. You want one?”
“Show me,” said Steve. Tony pulled on a dark blue electromagnetic glove he’d made. He closed his and shield instantly attached to his forearm.
Steve scowled. Scent played an essential role in coupling. How was he to find someone to help him through his heat if he smelled repulsive?
Pepper sighed heavily. "She's an extremely well-known talk show host. Going on her show will introduce you two formally as a couple to millions. She's respectful and appeals to a wide range of viewers."
“So you’re saying that the Hulk, the other guy, saved my life? That’s nice. It’s a nice sentiment. Save it for what?” asked Bruce. In the beginning, he'd died, instead of cursing him with the green beast. Those dark thoughts decreased but they were still present.
Steve blushed. His heart raced. He wanted that. That was baser part of him. It was something he couldn't have. He tried before. But what was the harm in fantasing? Tony kept him tucked protectively close. For hours they remained. He whined when Tony pulled away.
"Listen, idiots, if we weren't understaffed I'd have your jobs.” Lena took a breath steadying her building anger. If it weren't for her sleeping family in the neighboring rooms she'd be screaming.
The disembodied sound of Jarvis’s voice seemed to only scare the omega. He took the blankets from the couch and slowly approached. Tony tried making himself seem smaller.
"Our stock has tripled since I became Ironman. Is it all about money, Pep? What if I loved this guy?"
Non-invasive prenatal paternity testing – advances in genetic testing has led to the ability to determine paternity while a woman is pregnant through noninvasive measures. There's a small amount of fetal DNA during pregnancy from blood with no risk of miscarriage. Studies have shown cffDNA can be observed as early as 7 weeks gestation.
“You can’t say that, Matt. That was Jeri Hogarth. A partner in one of the biggest law firms in New York,” he said.
The elevator doors opened. He went to the guest bedroom. Captain Rogers was huddled in a nest of pillows with an arm wrapped tightly around Tony’s waist. He was purring softly.
Tony jogged over and got the kit. Steve was sitting on a bench. The omega took his hand. Steve splinted his hand with athletic tape. He kissed Tony's hand.
“We aren't doing anything too exciting. We'll at some amazing restaurants and layout on the beach," said Tony.
Sex was the last thing on his mind. Tony had to earn that privilege. Steve fell back onto the bed. He was horny. Tony successfully has woken up a sex drive he’d managed to suppress most of his life. He closed eyes for a moment gathering himself. His omega begged him to further reunite with the alpha. But sex wasn't going to mend the emotional rift. Steve returned to Tony settling next to the alpha.
Steve tensed backing away. The scent of an alpha filled his nose. It was a mix of black pepper and rosemary. The scent belonged to a somewhat scruffy dark haired alpha. In his hand was a cane. He wore a pair of dark glasses and in one hand was a cane. He’s blind. There would no chance of him being recognized. The could smell him, but it would be easy to slip by. He stepped forward his feet crunching in the snow.
“This isn’t the first time. As soon as I fall asleep, you leave. You can sleep in a tin can but not by your mate.”
Steve watched as the alpha processed the new information. He wasn’t sure which emotion Tony was trying to control. Tony left their bed and started pacing.
He was likely one of the few to see him like this. Tony leaned against the edge of the couch. Smirking when the omega started softly snoring. Steve's eyelashes were long. He devoted several minutes to counting the delicate lashes. There were three hundred. Steve turned slightly in his sleep, causing the blanket to fall away, exposing his pale flawless skin. Tony couldn’t resist carding his fingers through that golden brown hair. It was so soft. Tony smiled when Steve began purring contently, releasing pleased pheromones. It took so much more to get Pepper purring like this.
Steve smiled and brought her to his chest. A peaceful aura surrounded them. From there, it was easy to fall asleep.
Blue eyes locked on his. They held such deep relief. He thought he'd never see them again. Tony touched Steve’s cheek, making sure it was real. Steve leaned into the touch, tears streaming down his face. He was real. Steve brought him into his arms, kissing him. The omega's tears wet his face.
Steve growled. Tony backed away from him before he could get a grip on him. Steve managed to get his feet. By then, Tony was back in his lab. The alpha never ran from a chance for sex. He waddled down the stairs. Steve snarled when he found his husband doing pull-ups in the lab. He'd been talking to an empty tin can this entire time. Dum-E offered him a plate of fruit.
Tony scowled at the idea of anything tampering with Steve's wonderful scent. "Jarvis send me a full body scan now!"
"How about this? If you go, you can choose any car you like and we’ll rebuild it together?" said Daddy.
“Yes, it’s preferable to have my subjects close at hand. But I still have a higher level of control over them than a mindless ape like you will never possess. All it takes is a single word, and they'll be at my beck and call. Why not let them gather information for the time being."
“No, look around you costumes green screen. Honestly, I was on vacation for half the stuff when I was movie magiced up.”
His chest. The scar. His chest, his chest, his chest—Steve stares at Tony’s chest and he really needs to stop staring at Tony’s chest right the fuck now.
“Not yet. But maybe soon. I don’t know if we’ll see each other again, Stella. It’s going to be very dangerous. For us. The fight, I mean. And I’m just a man in a tin can. And what if we can’t stop them, they’re gonna destroy…” Tony breathes through his own panic. “But meeting you, talking about Mom… it’s meant the world to me. And I want to say thank you.”
He draws Tony close to himself with a hand on his back. He feels a slight twinge in Tony’s legs and he seizes the moment before he can think himself out of it: he slides his hand down, over Tony’s butt, and he hoists him up until his thighs are wrapped around Steve’s hips, his ankles crossed against the small of Steve’s back, like yesterday in the river. Tony holds himself up by putting his free arm around Steve’s neck, and then Steve does the only thing he could possibly do right now.
Tony clutches at Steve’s shoulder and leaves without another word. Steve hears him start the shower. He stares at his hands splayed out on the table.
So it goes on. Their activities vary now, depending mostly on the place they find themselves in, if they have lube on hand or not, if they have to be really quick about it because Fury is waiting for them in the conference room.
Tony steadies the bag and lets his forehead touch the leather for a moment. He feels sweaty and tired, clumsy in his gloves, and he really should have worn something that was closer to the definition of sweatpants than that of pajama bottoms. He looks down at his naked feet, at his chest, at the space where the light of the arc reactor used to shine through all his t-shirts.
It’s the same way he feels about Tony’s hands, lived and real; while his own, unblemished and artificial, feel like the hands of a statue. Lifeless.
. There was no serum to make me strong and brave like Captain America, so he tried single-malt bourbon.
He rolls the leather of the kit over on itself and wraps the strap around it but doesn’t clasp it, since he’ll have to open it again later. He looks at the embroidered letters there, traces the J and the R with his finger. The only thing he’s got left of his dad. A man who died two months before he was born. He’s glad Peggy and SHIELD kept this for so long. He’s glad they gave it back to him when he asked.
Steve leans on his desk, hand splayed on the hard surface. He spreads his legs and waits, hears Tony fumbling with the bottle of lube Steve left on the bed for him.
Sarah comes back to kiss them goodbye. Peter takes her to school most days; it’s on the way to his day job in the city. Tony fixes her hair in a ponytail and pushes her undershirt inside the waist of her jeans.
“You slicked yourself completely. I had to change them,” said Tony. He shivered, remembering the blissful intensity of the omega's slickened scent.
“Stress can’t override a biological imperative, not if your body is capable following its will,” said Edith.
"I'll start with the changes we've found in Tony. The bond the two of you share has somehow transferred a fraction of the effects of the serum. We're trying to figure out why and how long the effects will last," said Bruce.
Steve nodded, leaning more of his weight into the alpha. He took Tony’s hand and led him to the bedroom. Tony willing followed behind him.
Steve bucked against the intimate touch. He clutched the edge of the table, needing something to grasp. His legs wrapped loosely around Tony’s waist. His heart drummed in his ears.  He nuzzled against Tony’s neck breathing in his scent. Steve ran his tongue along Tony’s neck, causing the alpha to freeze for a moment, before kissing him. He moaned into their kiss as Tony’s finger pressed into him. His legs spread, further offering himself to the alpha. Soon other fingers joined. He pressed further down on them. Steve balanced on the edge of release.
“I’ve discovered something else from your bloodwork it from before and after your heat,” said Edith.
They went to the large double doors. Tony lifted one of the potted plants, taking a key from underneath. It seemed rather out of date to Steve.
Steve slowly came out of the feral state. He stood in Tony’s lab with his arms tightly around the alpha. His rival’s scent was gone from his alpha. He did it again. Tony wasn’t his alpha. Steve realized he was still holding the inventor close.
“I don’t have plans for the holiday. You should spend with whoever is important to you. I wish I still could,” said Steve.
, how could he help his daughter? A touch against his shoulder made him strike out. His opponent caught his arm.
"My grandmother made me learn. I also speak with French, Spanish, and Dari. Oh, and Latin. Why my boarding school insisted on teaching a dead language I don't know,” said Tony.
The light under her skin started to dim as she calmed. It would be easiest to rip off the boards and lift her out. When he stepped onto the deck. Piper cried and the blue light brightening due to stress.
Phil kept his expression neutral. He didn’t want to know what his hero whispered to Stark to make Stark have such a heated expression.
“This is where you belong. Submitting to an alpha. Stark, has been too lenient with you,” said Rumlow.
“What kind of tree do you want?” asked Steve. He had to keep himself under control. Sex wasn’t the right distraction for Tony, after the holidays.
"If you can do that," he said, pointing to the hundred-pound weight in the wall, “then your punches should pack much more of a wallop.”
Steve woke happily huddled against Tony. He soon realized he had an issue and it was currently pressed against Tony’s inner thigh. Luckily, the inventor was still asleep. He carefully slid from the bed to the bathroom. Being covered in Tony’s scent didn’t help his problem. He started slicking. He got in the shower, waited for his body to calm, hoping Tony hadn’t caught the scent.
“The average tank in WW2 was fifty-four tons. Seventy years in ice yet you’ve grown stronger,” said Phil.
"Me, no. Captain Rogers, you are. You are a hero to the omega community. Without you, I and millions of other omegas may not have rights and opportunities we have today."
Piper slowly opened her eyes. She wiped the drool from her chin. Her neck ached from her heavy collar. The swelling in his eye had gone down enough for it to open.
Steve undressed, changing into the gown given to him. He closed his eyes and laid back on the padded exam table. Edith was quick as always.
There was an indoor track there that was rarely used. They could walk there undisturbed. The large room was empty. Jarvis had sealed off all non-business floors of the tower. The elevator stopped at the gym. They slowly stepped onto the track. Steve took his hand, entwining their fingers.
"I don't either." Tony wanted a peaceful life for them, or close to one as possible. “We’ll only give them enough to leave us alone."
He allowed it, this time. Her tiny hand wrapped around his finger, holding it tight. She was unafraid of it. She was unafraid of him.
Caring for Steve provided some relief from the pain. Steve touched their foreheads together. They nuzzled, taking in each other's other scents.
"A government agency, setting up two superheroes. It's a conspiracist’s dream. They’d claimed we were put together to make some super baby,” said Tony.
“Metal, we’ve had to piece together his skull a few times,” said Hounsfield. He studied the image. The spider webbing fracture spreading across Winter temple wasn't as serious as he’d thought. No bone fragment had broken off. It would heal naturally in a week or two.
Steve clenched the metal foot stand of the bed. It groaned. Howard was one of his dearest friends. He thought he at least one person from his past in his present. If Howard's death were natural, it would be easier to accept. He couldn’t stop a tear from falling but was quick to wipe it away.
"No, that's not it. The idea of being alone with Piper for five days is a bit intimidating, but I'm sure I'll manage." With his free arm, he hugged Steve.
She should have never left! Piper started sniffling doing her best to force back her tears. He kneeled in front of her. She watched as the feral nature shrank from his eyes. He gently wiped away her tears.
Natasha pulled up the footage of a man dressed in a gold and red armor. He was speeding through the air with such ease.
“Stark, congratulations on your new bond and pup. Let it grow strong powerful person like its parents,” said Thor.
Tony went to the hall. Scent tracking wasn't one of his strong alpha strong suits. Tony worked through the maze of halls getting closer to that familiar scent. When he was closer singing could be heard:
As they played Piper tried piecing things together. Seeing Lena would give nothing away. But there was nothing to explain her absence of memory. There was no thrill to beating Lena at the game. Wouldn’t she remember wiping that smug look off her face? She ended up winning. Lena helped her put away the pieces.
Piper hopped down from bed, going into the bathroom to wash her hands. Even though Winter's blood was gone, she could still smell it. The scent was everywhere. Once her nose caught the smell, there was no escaping it. She realized the scent was on her body, not only on her hands. She threw up into the sink. Winter was by her side.
The pup was scared. It needed to stop before they could move forward. He drew closer to the girl, kneeling beside. She was the only person he’d encountered who gained comfort from his nearness. Piper caught him a hug, knocking him back slightly. Her arms wrapped snuggly around his neck. He briefly hesitated before returning the gesture. Winter knew he shouldn’t indulge the pup like this. She wouldn’t receive this kindness here.
Steve flipped the shield revealing the shredded leather arm straps.“Thought you could come up with something better."
Tony sighed. He shouldn't be interested in the bombings, but he wanted to claw into it and solve the problem. A new challenge to distract from the constant stress and fear over losing his family. Without distraction, all the anxiety and stress he was feeling might be unleashed on Steve. He didn’t want to burden his mate with that, not after all Steve had been through. Keeping it redirected was the only way he could manage it.
“It’s nothing.” His aching side and bleeding leg were nothing compared to what he felt in his heart.
This was her trying to open up. Denying her may discourage it. But what if she wasn't ready? Steve hated the corner they’d been backed into. What bothered more was he wasn’t sure if Piper had intentionally done it that way. He looked to Tony, the alpha nodded.
“My doctor at a heat facility. I was weak and sickly while in heat and needed special attention. He used my situation to his advantage."
Steve sat on the far end of the couch. He dug his fingers into fabric denying his need to cuddle into his alpha.
By the time they finished he'd worked up a good sweat. When they went to check on Piper she was tackling a Curious George stuffed animal.
Piper sighed. Unlike everyone else here, Winter was the only one who never intentionally hid something from her. There was something wrong with him that made him so limited in what he was free to do. He was sick.
He sat in the rocking chair. Piper was placed in his arms. She was loosely wrapped in Steve's shirt. Piper pressed against him, seeking the warmth and comfort of his skin. He purred. She made a cooing sound. Piper yawned, closing her eyes. He rocked gently back and forth. Holding her, he realized how right Yinsen was. Before Steve and Piper, he had nothing. Now that he had them he would anything to protect them.
Steve sat next to him. He ran his fingers through Tony's hair. The alpha leaned into him, breathing in his scent.
Tony lifted the metal on top of them. Steve caught the metal edge that nearly sliced through Pepper’s neck.
Steve had never seen so many zeros on a check before. He donated most of it spreading over worthy charities, leaving only a million for himself on Natasha’s instance. His pay from S.H.I.E.L.D. and those saving were enough. Steve shook his head. He didn't want to focus on this subject.
It takes him an embarrassingly long time to realize it has nothing to do with his shower, and a lot to do with the way Steve’s cheeks tinged with pink just now.
He looks at Tony’s face while he sleeps and focuses his hearing on Tony’s regular breathing, on the steady beat of his heart. Steve’s eyelids are suddenly too heavy, and soon he can’t keep his eyes open any longer.
Steve was tired. He wanted nothing more than to get back home. Finally, he got to the tower. He still found the building ugly but it was home nonetheless.
“We are awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark, hoping he will give us his reaction to the attack," a reporter.
“At first I forgot I was wearing it, but even when I realized I was still wearing I couldn’t take it off,” said Steve. He nuzzled closely to the alpha’s neck.
They toiled away together. Piper started nodding off around one in the afternoon, so Tony picked her up.
“With those pretty locks of yours out the way, you should be able to see better,” said Sir, running his finger through what remained of her hair.
At least it was something he was secure with. The familiar rhythm of that life would be natural for him to fall back into. He craved it. It gave him direction and some sense of control.
Piper grabbed him, trying to get them both away. She didn't get far before she too was shot with the same drug. Piper collapsed. It was a battle to keep her eyes open. Sir’s soldiers rolled two metal crates were into the room, and locked heavy retrains around her wrist. A familiar pine mint scent touched her nose. Winter came into the room, sheathing a bloody knife.
Tony clung to the edge but was forced to let go when the piano came rolling toward him. A blast from his gauntlet sent it crashing into one of the helicopters. “That’s one.”
He’d wasted his time. All the wasted effort. There had to be some link here. Something proved this misuse of time.
Steve was tempted to kiss the alpha to see if he could taste it as well. He pushed the thought from his mind. Steve realized he stood between the alpha legs. His arms frame Tony in. Their faces were only centimeters apart. Heat rose in his cheeks. Tony’s breath brushed against his lips.
As soon as Tony entered the room he caught him a hug. Tony turned and pressed a kiss on Steve’s soft pink lips.
Steve huffed but took a bite. It triggered his hunger and ate with ease. Steve brushed the crumbs out of the bed. His stomach growling when he saw the empty plate.
Breakfast was always oatmeal with blueberries, whole grain toast with butter and jam, fruit, bacon, scrambled eggs, and a glass of water. Lunch was several peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, with smooth peanut butter and grape jam, apple slices, chicken nuggets, and milk. This was dinner. Dinner was mash potatoes, green beans, meatloaf, broccoli, and a glass of milk. Everything here was always the same. There was no change. It was a pattern. A stupid pattern that helped her keep her sanity. It only meant something to her. Piper started crying.
Steve sighed. He would have to use the pump. A week would give him plenty of time to make enough bottles for Piper while he’s gone.
He pulled his hands away. The last thing he ever wanted to do was scare her. His emotions had gotten out of hand, lately, and he let his nerves get the best of him.
“Thanks,” said Steve. He got out of bed, closing the distance between them. His legs grew weak only feet away from the alpha. "Tony."
The beta started packing up his desk, not wanting Piper to discover anything prematurely. There were some anomalies he had to discuss with her parents first. He also had to have a discussion with Maria and Pepper.
Tony was slow in his approach. He was not going to risk losing a chance to get into Captain America’s pants. Tony moved, so he was sitting next to the perfectly sculpted omega. He leaned closer.
“When have you given a fuck about a contract?! You know the press will find out. They always find out," hissed Pepper.
“I’ve calculated Captain Rogers's necessary calorie intake. For him, maintain his current weight, he needs to ingest 14,404 calories a day. Even more so when goes to heat,” said Jarvis.
He wished he could believe that. “Steve, I’ll be in the living room.” Tony sighed, walking away from the door.
Lena returned to the room. Observing the changes taking place with her subjects. This was a shift in their dynamics. This was a big step in cementing Winter’s trust in the pup.
“I am well aware of the danger your children pose. They’d be my most high-risk patients in that sense. But their cases aren't as unique as you think," said George.
“I’ll try,” he said. That selfish, possessive streak of his inner omega wasn’t him. Recently, it had been putting up more of a fight. He was finding it more difficult to resist.
Grasp Reflex - A baby will grasp a finger or object when it is placed in the palm of her hand. This reflex is strongest during the first 2 months and usually fades by 5-6 months.
“Tell me,” said Loki. He took a seat. Loki heard her story from Clint, but it was far more interesting to hear it be told in person.
He wanted to tell of her he met her parents, but protocol would not allow him. And if he could tell her, would it do her any good?
“Don’t waste your tears on me.” Winter brushed her tears away with the pad of his thumb. “You shouldn’t cry. It shows weakness.”
He ran his fingers through Steve's hair. Tony was incapable of producing the purr that would provide the greatest comfort to his mate. He just couldn't do it with Piper still missing. So, Tony brushed his thumb against the claim mark on Steve's neck. Steve gasped awake, leaping from the bed, tumbling to the floor.
He hears noise on the other side. He can’t tell what’s going on. The line is disturbed, as though the phone isn’t working all that properly. There are ragged, shallow breaths.
“Shower. Then bed,” Tony says after a few minutes have passed, but for a long while they just stand there, hugging in silence, looking at Manhattan. The high-rises are dark and shining, an irregular chessboard of lit and unlit windows.
“No,” he says, pinching the bridge of his nose, “I did not shrink myself with the laser like that movie Clint made us watch. Obviously.”
Tony turns away from Steve and his gaze falls on their hands, still bound together with his hand wrap.
“After we... When we... Okay, no,” Steve takes a steadying breath, rubs his hands up and down his face, and wishes this came easier to him.
He remembers not eating. For days. Not sleeping. Not shaving. Not being able to do anything at all except sit on his armchair in front of the window and stare outside, seeing nothing, while pain kept exploding in the middle of his chest because his heart felt like it was being constantly torn into pieces for the sick amusement of some superior entity that fed on his agony.
Steve gets down on one knee in front of him, between Tony’s open thighs. He touches Tony’s hair, pushes it back from his forehead, and when Steve removes his hand Tony hunches down to press his brow to Steve’s.
For a moment, Tony is made pure and perfect. He becomes sheer intention, disconnected from the vagaries of execution.
“I’m sorry it’s taking me so long. I keep turning this in my head... I care about you, Steve. I don’t want to get this wrong. I swear I’m not being cruel on purpose.”
“She used to say she liked him at first because he was always clean. Said other boys weren’t. She said he was good. Excited about having a baby. Wanted a daughter.” He smiles a little at the thought. “But she never said much. Always cried when she talked about him, so I tried not to ask. He loved her very much, I think. She did, too.”
There’s symbology there, something psychosomatic, as Sam would say. He doesn’t want to acknowledge it.
It’s the most beautiful thing Steve has ever heard. Suddenly, the ringing in his head disappears to make space for this, the best sound in the world: Tony’s voice. It wasn’t fading from Steve’s memory; the serum doesn’t really let him forget things, but Steve had been scared that for some reason it would slip away from his grasp and now… now he doesn’t have to worry about that anymore.
It’s been folded over itself and twisted and tied up with twine and some type of barbed wire that Steve has never seen before. There’s dried blood all over it and the skin is blue with the loss of circulation. They must have done this while Steve was passed out, not even to hurt him, just for the fun of it. He tries to touch it, but he can’t use his hands. Tony looks at him for several meaningful seconds, and Steve says nothing. He squeezes his eyes shut, grits his teeth and soldiers on through this new humiliation.
He stops to look at a bird flying low and then perching itself on one of the cypresses. He takes a picture of it with his phone. Tony doesn’t realize he stopped, or maybe he does but he’s leaving him to his own interests. Steve watches him walk away.
It’s like taking off your wet clothes after being out in the rain. Like someone wrapping a warm blanket around your shoulders, pushing a cup of coffee in your hand. It’s like sitting together in front of a fire while the storm rages outside.
Steve’s breath hitches, but Tony continues, “I hope I’m not overstepping here, but, uh... she really loved you. Losing you, it fucked her up. She learned to deal with it, she worked, she had a family… she found closure in the end, because she had to. She had no other choice. But sometimes she cried when she told me her stories—your stories.”
“That’s just as well,” Steve pants against his lips, interspersing each word with a kiss. “God, Tony, I… I’ve never been this hard in my life,” he says, and then blushes since the sentence wasn’t meant to be said out loud. But Tony can feel it, Steve’s erection, he can feel it against his groin, the inside of his thigh.
“You were... you were having a nightmare. I’m sorry I touched you, I tried to call you but... I just wanted to wake you up, I promise... I didn’t wanna hurt you, I wasn’t tryin’ to hurt you, I swear I swear I swear I swear—”
and his mind is suddenly filled with images of himself kneeling in front of Steve, hooking his fingers on Steve’s waistband and dragging the sweatpants down around his ankles, licking at Steve’s groin and tasting a deep white heaven on his tongue.
“Feeling better?” he asks, and Tony laughs again, but he doesn’t reply, and Steve lets it go for now.
Steve is trying to speak, but it’s hard for him right now, Tony can tell. He brushes a hand over the side of his thigh in reassurance and Steve bends his head to look at him and the second their eyes meet Steve shakes, and his dick pulses inside Tony’s mouth, and he spends himself into Tony’s throat for a second time.
Okay. What the fuck is happening to Steve? What the hell has gotten into him? Did Loki sprinkle him with some magic glitter that makes him horny all the time? Is he just regularly horny all the time and the glitter makes him think Tony is half his actual age?
Tony reaches for the lube on the bedside table, slides down Steve’s thighs so he can slick him up. His fingers are shaking. Steve just looks at him, wants to stop him, wants to warn him, to say,
The truth is, he misses Steve. He’s angry, so angry he can’t even see straight, but he misses Steve.
He’s facing the other way from Steve, staring far away into the valley, at the hills, at the dark clouds already above them.
Steve sits and takes his fork and forces food into his mouth. It tastes amazing, of course, but he can’t appreciate it right now. He eats in silence, quickly, he’d be sick if he didn’t have the body he has.
“I don’t doubt it is. But you and the other Avengers, you have an unimaginable power. Without consciousness…” she sighs. “You can’t be judge and jury, Steve. There are laws. International ones, too. If you disregard them, what makes you different from the criminals?”
Steve stays on the ground, keeps the ladder steady for Tony, distributes the fruit in the baskets, passes him the scissors when he needs them.
Tony searches for him with his mind. He finds regret and an underlying sense of guilt that will probably take a while to get rid of, but there’s also relief and acceptance. Steve is accepting Tony’s apology. Steve is accepting that maybe he didn’t deserve all that. Not ten years of it, anyway.
Tony shakes his head, but doesn’t say anything else, and the awkwardness vanishes on its own in a few minutes.
They eat sitting at the kitchen peninsula, the soft melody coming from Maria’s mobile toy as their background music.
Steve reaches behind Tony, grabbing the t-shirt from the collar at the back of his neck. Tony bends down, and it’s only now that he’s not looking into Steve’s eyes anymore—that Steve isn’t looking into his—that he realizes how much he needs that.
“I always hoped I could forgive you. Someday. Seeing that it was affecting Sarah in ways I hadn’t thought of… it convinced me.”
In the kitchen, Stella is cutting twine off of a piece of beef with a long knife. Tony smiles at her.
And Tony could lie. Could minimize. He could pretend it’s just work stuff, that he’s worried about something going on with Riri or Kamala or Miles or any of the other kids, but he knows that he can’t. He shouldn’t. He should tell Steve the truth, always. He can trust Steve. They’re building something. Something real. They’re making all their dreams come true. He can’t lie to Steve.
He laughs, then, like Tony always does in the wake of revelations too terrible to accept. He laughs, and the edge in his voice transforms into something ugly and mean—it’s deranged and dangerous, it’s an unruly, unrestrained bitterness; a shame too deep and too familial not to become disgrace and dishonor.
They saw each other again two years later, when the sky was dark and some purple alien fucker that looked like a used condom wanted to destroy the planet.
But if there’s one thing that secretly pining for each other for more than a decade has taught them, is that they need to
Tony stumbles into the bathroom, closing the door behind himself. He doesn’t lock it. If he wakes up, Steve will hear what he’s doing no matter what, and he won’t disturb him.
Later, while Tony is brushing his teeth and changing into sleep clothes, Steve searches for a blanket in the closet. The one he finds is thick and smells clean, so he spreads it on his bed and sits on it, facing Tony’s bed. He props his elbows on his knees, holds his head between his hands. He feels cold.
Steve covers his eyes with his hands, frustrated, annoyed, impatient. “Please Tony don’t do this. Please please please, I can’t take another night like this, please.”
They remain there, at the center of each other’s minds, Steve enveloping Tony and Tony enveloping Steve, folding and unfolding all over each other. A sense of protection stems from it, and it lulls them into a sleep-like lethargy. There’s nothing else to do except to let things flourish naturally between them. Let it happen.
Ugh. They fell asleep on the bed while they were playing with Maria. She’s still between them, eyes open now.
Tony feels like an animal, not moving, not even breathing lest a predator senses his presence and attacks, but he can’t fuck this up. He’ll take what Steve gives. It’s already more than Tony could ever deserve. Even if he flew a hundred nukes into just as many wormholes in the sky, he’d never be worthy of Steve.
to hate you, just for a little while, just to prove to myself that I was able to, that you didn’t really have that scary amount of power over me. That some of this was still up to me and me only.
Steve is by his side, waiting for Tony to climb down the stairs. He hasn’t seen Sam waiting for them on the tarmac, leaning against Pepper’s car while he talks with her about who knows what.
There’s concrete under him, snow and ice all around him for miles and miles and miles and Steve is gone and Rhodey is hurt and he’s alone and there’s no one to call for help, there’s no one, no one.
Tony had stopped paying attention for a second and all of a sudden, just like that, he was Steve Rogers’ boyfriend.
The bread is crunchy outside and fluffy inside; the meat is spongy, but not in an unpleasant way. The spices complement the other flavors in a perfect equilibrium.
Later, when they’re lying down on their side waiting for the knot to subside, Steve touches Tony’s abdomen and starts whispering in his ear.
How small your world becomes, when you feel so utterly alone. It reduces itself to the littlest things. An old t-shirt that becomes a lifeline, and its presence fossilizes in your heart until the day you realize that you can’t live without it. It’s become part of your pain, giving it an unexpected shade of mundanity.
again and the only thing he can do is suck Tony off until he feels the familiar thick liquid flood his mouth, the comforting bitter taste on his tongue, the warmth of it make its way down his throat.
Tony shouts, “Finally,” takes Steve’s fingers out of himself and sinks back down on his dick. In his hands Steve sees the cock cage.
“Will trust you. They’ll believe you. You’re a hero. You were a hero long before you were Iron Man.”
Tony fucks Steve hard, and if he was a lesser man Steve might think the lack of finesse is a belated punishment for that unwelcome touch that still makes him feel guilty, but at this point he knows that’s just how Tony likes it. Steve likes it too.
Their eyes meet for a moment. Steve looks so all-encompassingly sad, it’s in his bones and coming out from every pore of his skin. He finishes dressing quickly, shivers while putting on a sweater.
Manuela has to get back to work, but he remembers to tell her that they will have dinner at the restaurant tonight. She knows who Steve is but doesn’t comment on it, and Tony is silently grateful for it.
Now that he knows that Tony is in fact smaller than the last time they’ve done this, it’s easy to notice how. Just one of Steve’s fingers seems so big. He doesn’t know how he’ll manage to fuck him.
“I know that. And you know what I think? That the one drawing the short straw here is Steve. He’s out of his mind with want and need, and I just go to him like,
“When this is done… we’re gonna find you a therapist. Someone we can trust. Someone you like. We’ll have them come here, bodyscan them before they set foot in the compound every time. Have them sign a contract they won’t want to breach. They’re gonna keep their records about you here, on your personal server. And you’re gonna work on this. We are, together.”
“Don’t make me laugh,” he says, still with a smile on his face, but he can’t quite hide the strain in his eyes. “I’m too old to handle it.”
He tries to tell himself that until they reach a full week of this with no changes there’s no reason to panic, but—
Tony is asleep, but he’s frowning, sweating, his whole body trembles as he tries to speak but what comes out is only gibberish. Steve shifts on the bed to wake him up without scaring him, but before he can touch him Tony awakens on his own with a shout that sounds an awful lot like
, more concentrated, more powerful, even, and Steve doesn’t want to taste anything else for the rest of his life.
As it often happens, Steve resumes thrusting into Tony a couple of minutes after coming inside him. But after a bit, Tony yawns, and Steve stops, tries to pull out.
Why can’t Tony be just a normal Omega; why can’t he be just… thin and cute and… and enjoy the right things and not want his Alpha to knot his mouth, and not want to fuck his Alpha with his fingers and maybe even his dick, why can’t he just… why can’t he just be submissive and good for Steve and—
And when Tony almost died to save New York, he gained Steve’s respect, maybe, but not really his friendship—they were teammates. Avengers.
Tony closes his eyes, and Steve takes over his mind. Blue eyes, strong arms, the low rumble of his voice. Was it that deep even when he was sick and skinny?
“Alright. Alright,” Steve says, and rests his forehead against Tony’s chest. The light pressure on the reactor feels good, even through two layers of clothing. Tony brushes his lips to Steve’s hair.
“But I want you to know that Steve… I’ve held him while he cried himself sick for you—me, Sam, Nat, we all have. A lot of times. It never went away, it never got any easier for him.” He sighs, shaking his head because he’s unsatisfied with the way he’s explaining this. “What I mean is… don’t think, Tony, not even for a minute, that there was ever a point in the past ten years where Steve wouldn’t have taken you back in a heartbeat if you agreed to it. Or that he wouldn’t do it now, or in the future. He’d always want you. He never stopped loving you.”
Tony just looks at him. Opens his mouth, closes it. Opens it again, closes it again. His brain is working. He lowers his head, sighs. He’s tired. “I’m sorry. Guess the three missed orgasms explain why I’m being such an asshole.”
There’s a small window, up above, close to the ceiling. I can see the sky and the white clouds passing by. It makes me feel human.
Before Tony realizes someone is even approaching the car, T'Challa is sitting in the passenger seat.
The way she always looked Steve over before he went out, making sure he was dressed all proper, that his hair looked good and his shoes were clean, so people wouldn’t think badly of her, letting her son go around the city like this or that.
But they need to focus. They need to understand where they are and if and how they can leave, if and how they can call for help. Tony needs to concentrate and free them both, so Steve can fight their way out of this mess and take Tony home, to safety. To Sarah.
This has been happening for months, and not even that often. He’d think about someone, even someone who doesn’t exist, just a warm body on top of his—and there it is, his cock getting mildly interested, and then, as soon as Tony tries to do something about it...
Tony, beautiful, beautiful Tony, who trusts Steve to look after his numb body, his perfect body, his exhilarating body; who lets Steve use him like this; who is willing to be the means to an end for Steve’s needs; who offered himself up for Steve’s pleasure like it was the most normal thing in the world.
Steve kneels on the floor and surges forward to put Tony’s cock back in his mouth, and in no time Tony is again on the brink of his orgasm.
Steve is back with a glass of water in his hand and he makes Tony drink it, and Tony tries to protest and not drink the whole thing but Steve looks at him and says, “Finish the water, Tony, please,” so Tony finishes the water because Steve said his name, and he said
It’s usually how it goes. It’s rare, this kind of betrayal, but when it happens… the pile of Omega bodies grows.
Tony is getting married. When, exactly, Steve doesn’t know, but it’s gonna happen soon. It must be. It’s been months since the announcement.
Steve whines, whimpers. It’s pitiful, he looks like he’s in pain. Tony feels come gush out of him with every thrust, hears it making a squelching noise that is straight up pornographic, and he realizes exactly what it is that has reduced Steve to this state.
Tony comes back to the penthouse about an hour later, tired and dirty and with a burn on the back of his arm. But what he sees when he enters his living room makes it all go away.
He goes outside, sits on the porch. He looks at the sky, and the familiar spike of anxiety makes its way up his throat. He thinks about all the protocols FRIDAY is ready to implement if—when—
Slowly, and very, very carefully, Tony reaches up to intertwine Steve’s fingers with his own, stares at their hands. Steve can’t breathe. This can’t possibly mean–
He never had to deal with the long-term physical consequences of what the man did to him, but there are others, less obvious ones. He doesn’t like to be naked for long stretches of time—he showers in record time and gets dressed while his skin is still damp. Sometimes he wishes he didn’t have a body at all. Sometimes he thinks that his body is just a sack full of vomit and the man’s come, and he should try to throw it all up. He should cut his stomach open and let it all bleed out until he feels clean and empty. Tony thinks these things, and then he comes back to his senses and tries to go on with his day.
He just writes in the end, in wonky and uneven letters that barely resemble his usually neat handwriting.
They reach the little river, and it’s not frozen over. Tony thinks that maybe they could follow the stream for a few yards, reach a place where the riverbed is wider and the water deeper, but he thinks better of it. This was the exact place, so it has to be here.
They’ll have to find somewhere to sleep before that, though. Tony feels exhausted, jetlagged. He wants a drink—
“I’m so sorry,” he says, and it’s so inadequate that Steve could cry if he had any tears left after the past year.
Even though the man is dead, Tony still thinks about what he did to him once a day, every day. But now, he thinks he gets what the poem really meant.
The words were spoken in such a straightforward way, he didn’t make a big deal out of what Steve did at all. He just laughed it off, but didn’t dismiss it with easy camaraderie. He referenced to their night together casually, but not regretfully or mockingly. He just mentioned it, described it simply but precisely, straight to the point.
But after much thinking, and pondering, and brooding, Steve started to wonder whether Tony’s age really was affecting his libido.
Steve’s moves his hand to Tony’s ribs. Tony hears, more than feels, the soft kiss Steve places over the scar, through the t-shirt. Tony presses his nose in Steve’s hair.
He grabs the lube from Tony’s hand and coats his fingers, pushes in tentatively but the ring of muscles has already been worked loose, the intrusion is easier than usual.
Tony is paying for everything, and Steve doesn’t know what to do. He has money, his credit card works again thanks to T'Challa. On the other hand, Steve doubts Tony is paying to stay at a place he owns.
Steve opens his eyes, blinks a few times and tries to look at Tony. “What…” he starts, but he can’t finish.
Tony’s face is still painted with a perturbing anguish Steve wishes he was able to cure with a snap of his fingers, with a kind word, with a kiss.
Obviously the staircase had always been there. It was just hidden inside the stone. Someone only needed to coax it out. Convince it.
“Makes me crazy, Tony, y’know that? Your scent, your voice… These past few days I’ve barely seen you, thought I was losin’ my mind. Thought you didn’t want me anymore.”
Tony sniffs, loudly, and Steve realizes that he’s crying too. He drags a hand over his face, Steve wipes his own cheeks with the sleeve of his hoodie.
Steve seems to be about to get up, but then he hesitates and turns to face Tony. He’s not laughing at all now.
He looks at his hands, limp in his lap, and so different from Tony’s. Tony’s hands are real—used, callused, large, the fingers thick, the skin ridged with scars and old burns, the knuckles darkened like a worn-out pair of leather gloves, fingertips rough, palms hard and firm to the pressure, with grease under the nails sometimes. They’re hands that tell a story. They’re real hands.
It’s a very little river, shallow, and only a few feet in width. Tony can’t see any fish in it, even though the water is so clear he could count each of the black pebbles at the bottom of the riverbed. Some of the bigger stones, gray and white, create a little waterfall, and listening to the rush of the water, lazy and eternal, fills Tony with a peculiar sort of peace.
“I know. You don’t want to talk about it. That’s fine.” Steve puts his hands on his hips, then drops them. He bows his head in thought. “I’m not… I’m not a patient person, Tony. I’ve never been. I don’t wanna pressure you into making a decision. You need time, I’m gonna suck it up and give it to you. But don’t pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about when I tell you that no, I don’t just daydream about kissing you under a tree. I’m not 15. I know what I want. And I’ll wait for you to tell me if you can give it to me or not. I owe you that.”
Tony didn’t understand why Steve insisted on going to an old gym in Hell’s Kitchen when there was a fully updated gym in the tower. In any case, he’d bought the gym. The old owner kept it running, and Tony kept it funded under the condition it remain the same, and that Steve could go whenever he pleased. He made sure it was stocked with punching bags.
"Are we still at ding dong? We're supposed to be on total security lockdown. Come on, I threatened a terrorist," said Tony. Some woman was waiting there. Jarvis was already running her through facial recognition. “Who is that?”
Tony shrugged, not seeming to care. He went out onto the porch answered. A warm ocean touched his face. A minuscule part him missed the industrial smells he'd grown up with. He could get used to this kind of weather. It always seemed perfect.
. She made the last cut flinching. Nothing happened. They were safe. Her hands shook as she went for the clasp and unsnapped it.
“A week after I was released from the facility, I found out I was pregnant. I was terrified and ashamed. I was trapped with no options. There was no one I could tell, not even Bucky, no matter how much I wanted to. I was so weak the strain of pregnancy was too much and I miscarried. There was so much blood. Bucky found me curled up on the floor near death." Steve took a breath, realizing he was shaking. Tony's arm wrapped around him. He braced against the alpha for emotional and physical support. "Days later, I woke up in a hospital with Bucky by my side. He'd been with me the entire time. The reason he'd been allowed to stay was they thought the baby was his. I broke down and told him everything. He was so angry threatened to kill the doctor. But I couldn't let him. I'd already lost so much my mother, my baby. I couldn't lose him too."
Piper drooled at the smell pizza. Junk food was never allowed at the base. It was only given as bribes to get her and Rune behave.
"Are there others here?" She'd seen so few people. If there were more, she thought she'd have seen them by now. Or were they keeping her secluded on purpose? She wouldn't put it past them.
The war was over, yet it returned with vengeance after months of peace. As if it were trying to remind that he was unworthy of his new life. It should have been over when he crashed into the ice. He bit his lip holding back his scream. Blood trickled down his chin.
She hid her face in his neck. Piper didn't make a move to break the embrace, wanting to enjoy it for however long he would tolerate it. He rubbed her back.
“You weren’t ready to hear it. Honestly, I didn’t think you would be until you were a few years older,” said Daddy.
Steve woke about an hour later rushing to the bathroom. He came back a few minutes. Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder.
Tony stopped himself when she raised an elegant eyebrow, daring him to challenge her. When he lost his mother, Aunt Peggy became the only person he was willing to share the more intimate details of his life with. She let him live with her weeks after his parents' death.
Piper groaned; her arms were sore from being trapped behind her back. She'd wet herself. Her pants clung to her, irritating her skin. They'd left her like this to shame her into compliance. Lena wouldn't have left her in such a state, or at least would’ve given her pull-ups.
Tony could sense his pup’s anxiety. He kneeled down at eye level with her. “What color do you think we should paint it?”
Tony went through a thoroughly detailed plan of how the gauntlets worked. Steve was out after ten minutes. Tony purred deeply. Hopefully, it would help Steve sleep through the rest of his early labor. Steve was asleep against his chest. He tried reaching for his tools. The motion was impossible without waking his mate.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know what else to say. I will take this to my grave." He hoped he said the right thing. What had he done to deserve this level of trust? He couldn’t even hope to understand Steve’s grief. Holding Steve seemed to be best.
“I’m not the same as before,” she said. She doubted she ever could be. Thinking about it was confusing.
There was confusion in his expression. Something she'd said was foreign to him. Winter gave her the same look time to time.
Cell-free fetal DNA – is fetal DNA which circulates freely in the maternal blood. It can be gathered from a simple blood sample.
Steve let the cold water pour over him. The only challenge of the day was supposed to be telling his boyfriend that he was pregnant.
Pepper was asleep next to her. "Give me a second." Maria quietly left her bedroom and went to her secure office. “Alright, we’re good to talk,” she said.
“They are orange because they contain an organic pigment, carotenoid, which gives them that color," he said.
Winter signed his progress had been slowed by the incompetence of Sir’s men, but he should arrive at his tasked destination with enough time to spare.
Steve popped off the wooden lid. He smiling when he saw rusted falling apart 1942 Harley Davidson WLA.
I’m not sure if the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center was the hospital that Happy went to, but it was the closest one the Chinese Theater where he was injured. It is an actual hospital.
She grabbed the toy, dunking it into the water, and made waves. Tony would have enjoyed the scene more if Piper's eyes weren't almost entirely black, marking her mental state. It was heartbreaking seeing she couldn't achieve this simple happiness on her own.
“I do, Steve. We’ve been together for five years. In all that time, do you think I learned nothing? I know,
“Steve, you need to get out in the world. The Peles Castle is only an hour and a half train ride away,” said Natasha.
"Especially for me. I'm not the easiest person to get along with. Papa and Rhodey have the patience of a saint."
"This is idiotic even for you. You scared the hell of out of me! Did you even think this through?" she said.
"A promise that you'll comply with our conditions," he said. George quickly jotted down the agreement she'd proposed, leaving a place for her to sign, offering it to her.
He managed to turn his head to the side. Pepper was strapped upright into a stretcher. His pup kicked against his rib, urging him to get up.
“Steve, the system of omega alpha pairing only allows an omega to pair with the same alpha three times. Otherwise, things get complicated. The couple is tied. It becomes challenging to untie that knot. Pardon my phrasing."
Steve bit his lip. He wanted to ask what this was. It was their second date, yet it felt like so much more.
She was hesitant to touch. This was cybernetic technology. She knew enough to recognize it, but that’s as far as it went. The issue was a simple fix. The alpha was clenched and unclenched his hand.
Steve had knowingly or unknowingly agreed to a date. The choice was Steve's. Steve’s phone laying by the pillow. There were only five numbers in the contacts. Tony was tempted to take a picture of the two and set it as the background. He added his number. Tony pushed his nose to Steve's neck, closing his eyes.
They made their way to castle grounds. The surrounding woods were a mix of reds, orange, and yellow. It was beautiful. He took his time examining the architecture. Natasha was patient, not rushing him through the exhibits. Once done at the castle, they had a late lunch in the village before taking the train back to the base. Clint was waiting for them.
"Weapon hurt people that's a simple fact. Their creators aren't responsible for how someone uses them." His words did little to soothe his alpha. "Come here." Tony continued to pace, ignoring his request. "Tony."
The tunnel forked. He and Natasha split off to the right. They were forced into a single file approach as the tunnel narrowed further. In some areas, he was forced to lower his shield to side at some points.
Natasha took a breath, knowing this conversation wouldn't end well. Their anger was barely bridled. It needed to be released for them to stand a chance of having a reasonable discussion.
Steve went to the door, opening it slightly. The omega arguing with Tony was beautiful. She was dressed professionally. Her strawberry blonde hair was tied neatly in a bun. She was the kind of omega that many alphas dreamed of. Steve tried pulling away from the door, but couldn’t. It was rude to eavesdrop, but he couldn’t pull away. She still had feelings for Tony. That much was apparent. Nothing was ever simple with a Stark.
Winter almost purred at the comforting caress on his back. His eyes shot open, jumping to his feet only to lose his footing due to his muscles' stiffness. Where was the pup?! Relaxing slightly, he remembered she was safe. She'd beaten the odds and got back home. How much time had passed since he last saw her? Was it decades, years, or months? He groaned, rubbing his temples. Time had never taken on such importance. He'd adapt and serve. The setting or era didn't matter. It was only an obstacle to overcome to complete his mission.
Steve did as told and waited for it to be over. He was thankful for the new advances, but it didn’t make things any more comfortable. Thankfully, Edith worked quickly.
“Easy there alpha. Mine isn’t for a week and I’m on suppressants. Heat is something every omega goes through Steve should be more than capable in dealing with it," said Pepper.
His weapons deployed as he forced his way through the worm, exiting at the opposite end. Tony was thrown, landing on a taxi.  He got to his feet only to be shot back. Alien troops marched toward him weapons drawn.
Her opponent was taller. Size meant nothing. The hair on the back on her neck rose. A heavy static charged the air between them. She shifted lightly on her feet, waiting for him to make the first move.
“Steve is an improvement over that Pepper. You two were never a good match. What kind of parent names their child after table spice,” said Peggy.
Fury left them taking the holographic reconstruction with him. Tony fell back in reeling from the work he’d examined. It was eerie how his daughter style replicated his own. Shit, at her age he couldn’t dream of making something like that.
"Watch Stark. A toddler can get away with it but have no qualms about tazing you. Actually, it would make my day," warned Fury.
The beta frowned. It was an expression Steve was unaccustomed to seeing on Barny’s normally friendly face.
“Not you. There’s always a reason,” she said. Peggy sipped delicately from her teacup. “I haven’t seen that look in some time."
Steve slowly got up. His center of balance changed completely. He rubbed his lower back. For the first time in his life, he felt fat. It was impossible to find maternity clothes in his size. In the end, he had to get them custom made. Steve rubbed his stomach. The baby kicked gently against his hand.
Thor dropped his hammer, grabbing his brother, hauling him up to meet his gaze. How could Loki be so blind to how he was missed? Was there anything left of the brother he once knew.
“I don’t know just something I’ve always been raised with. Machinery is in the Stark blood. My grandfather and my daddy did it,” said Piper.
He rubbed his eyes to make sure the omega was still there. Steve’s eyes were slightly puffy and red from crying. He must have been crying all night for the effect to remain. Steve smelled of another alpha.
Tony knew what his omega wished of him. He wanted to give it to him, but he wanted that choice to be made when they weren’t like this. Tony sucked a mark onto the juncture of Steve’s neck and shoulder. His omega shuddered at the sensation, but he was unsatisfied. He managed to soothe and soon lulled the two of them into sleep. A week passed in the animalistic passion.
“Yes. Always by his side was his best friend Steve, a small sickly chick. Theodore protected him from squa and southern giant petrel without hesitation. One sad day Steve’s mom grew sick.”
Piper hurried off to the elevator. Steve smiled. Piper restored his joy in painting. It wasn't only a coping mechanism, now. Their paintings hung on the walls of the penthouse and her first finger painting was in their bedroom. Steve doubted Piper would come back up from the lab; if Tony was working on a project then so was she.
Steve turned red. Had Tony seen him in the bathroom or him changing? Tony wouldn’t do that, would he? Steve took a seat on the couch. He shook the thought from his mind. Pepper sat across from him.
She caught the small smile crossing Steve’s lips. She smiled. Steve may not be the average omega in many aspects, but he was possessive like any omega was over their chosen alpha.
"Doesn't mean I can't slow down, enjoy a moment. We can go out to the beach. No one will bother us," said Tony.
"I suppose so." Steve doubted Tony would tell just anyone what he told him. He would keep it to himself. Tony was vulnerable at that time.
They talked about sports for an hour. Steve groaned as that cramping repetitive pain returned. He desperately wanted to reach out for Tony's hand. It was an anchor.
The pup spent the rest of the day, reading quietly and talking to herself. Even when the lights went off she kept reading. Her super soldier abilities allowed her to read the text even in the darkness of their cell.
The alpha wouldn’t give him the privacy he wanted. Steve unwrapped his hands and decided to head home, pausing when he noticed Fury had a file.
“I’m will never leave you, Steve. You will always be my mate. I don’t want us to be at each other’s throats. I know your breaking point. I’ve seen it and have gotten you back. I'm not sure if I can do it again right now. I'd try god, would I try. Do you not see how close you are to falling over the edge. Can't you see I'm just as close to falling as you?"
Jeff lifted the girl’s head to strap her muzzle in place. Kevin added a small dosage of reversal to the girl’s IV. It wouldn’t be long before it took effect.
Tony took a breath. Now his search was limited to all of Hell’s Kitchen. Better than all New York. Footprints on rooftops caught his attention. That’s why there was little footage of him, he traveled along the rooftops. All he had to do was follow the prints. He stopped when the footprints came to an end. Tony landed on the roof. His facemask lifted. Steve’s scent was strongest here. He’s here.
Piper slowly took a seat at the desk. It was a bit big for her, her feet couldn’t touch the ground. Lena put a notebook in front of her along with several pencils.
“He was taken advantage of. There was nothing I could do to help him. He wouldn’t let me help him. And I was too you to understand,” said Thor.
"It doesn't matter! He killed our only lead. Now we have to find a ghost!" Tony burst out. When other two just stared at him, wordless, Tony left to get some air.
Tony hated going to museums even as a child. They were relics of the past, he wanted to focus on the future. The only museum of interest to him when he was young was the Air and Space Museum, but even that became boring after the second trip.
Soon, the bite guard was removed and he was allowed to sit up. He was in a room full of strangers, an occurrence he'd long become used to. The graying alpha in front of him was clearly in charge.
“Jarvis, pull up Steve’s therapist information." It appeared on his phone, Dr. Barnaby Turner. It had been almost a year since Steve talked to him. He should have pushed Steve to go. But everything was going so well.
“I’m thrilled that you’re thinking of our future and I want to have that conversation, but now isn’t the time. I agreed to go,” said Steve.
"What I need is for you to go home be with your mom. Keep your trap shut and guard the suit. And stay connected because when I call you better pick up, okay? Can you feel that we're done here? Move or I'll run you over,” said Tony. He got into the car and rolled down the window. “I’m sorry, kid. You did good.”
Doris Day – a famous actress and singer born in 1922. She began her big career as a band singer in 1939.
He brought the book into his lap. Taking the time to enjoy each photo. Ever so often the startings of a smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. As he became lost in the images he gave up his fight against the gesture.
Steve settled in bed with Piper. He turned on the TV to fill the quiet. The impatience in Tony's posture was clear, but he would not ruin this important time with Piper. After several minutes Tony surrender to a project. Piper was ready for a nap. He set her down in the playpen.
Tony chuckled. "Yes, but there's more to it before that. I wasn't planning on telling you until you got a bit older. But I think it will be better to tell you now.”
Pepper didn’t dare cry. She didn't have the right to. Steve was barely holding it together. Her breaking down would only make it more difficult. She noticed the woman standing near Steve. “Who are you?”
He mustn’t close his eyes. He reached out for her. She was just out of reach. The last thing he saw was Piper being taken away.
Killian was knocked away by a lamppost. Pepper stood before him. The small glimmer of hope faded as swiftly as it occurred. A suit came jetting toward them, attack ready.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Steve Rogers,” he said. She seemed nice. Her brown hair was tied into a messy bun. She had intelligent brown eyes.
When he could no longer stand the quiet of the art studio, he left, pausing in front of Piper's room. Steve hadn't been able to enter it since she was taken, fearing what it may do him. Yet, now, his hand rested on the doorknob. He pushed it open, firmly frozen at the doorway. The room was exactly how she’d left it. For the first time, he was happy to see the mess. He stood there for a few minutes, unable to enter.
She snarled, kicking her legs in a desperate attempt to throw him off. His grip was too strong. She bit his arm and slipped out of his grip. He grabbed her again. She punched back.
“We aren’t having sex on the plane,” said Steve. But it was more of a temptation than he thought possible. He took a breath, trying to remember there was still a pilot on board.
The drive home was quiet. Steve watched Piper sleep. There was something so calming to watching her.
Her eyes widened. The preheat stained his scent. Her nose wrinkled his scent was terrible."I shouldn't have snuck up on you."
Tony shrugged not caring. He constantly tested Piper’s growing intelligence. Bruce didn’t notice when he walked by. He went to his room, shedding his clothes, and got into the shower. The hot water helped wake him up. He toweled off and changed into fresh clothes before heading to the kitchen.
She wriggled out of Tony’s hold, scooting toward Steve. He held her closely, breathing in her scent.
How could he expect her to sleep now? She wrapped herself up in the blanket and shut her eyes, counting sheep until she finally fell asleep.
They were both exhausted by the time they got to their California home. Everything was back in place. Banner sat in their kitchen seeming perfectly at home. Steve gave him a small wave before curling up in his nesting couch.
“Loki’s scepter. The energy. The Tesseract can’t fight, but you can’t protect yourself against yourself,” said Selvig.
From her clutch she pulled a compact, appearing to check her perfect makeup; secretly, searching for anyone may have noticed her. Nothing abnormal, only a few lust-struck alphas who'd likely try, but fail, to get her attention. She snapped close the compact, tucking it back into her purse. Her newfound fame was a massive hindrance to her job. She lazily stirred the olives in her martini.
She hid her face in Papa’s shoulder, letting her mask drop. Piper breathed in his honey vanilla scent, a smell she'd known since birth. It made her relax. He put her down when they got the bathroom and helped her out of her muddy clothes, before placing her in warm water. She sighed. It used to take so long for the water to warm up at the base.
“I like helping people, Tony. I don’t think I could handle sitting around the house doing nothing,” he said. He watched his mom leave for work every day. It was only to support them, but she loved her job. He loved his job. But it was a real temptation. He could see himself being happy in the life Tony offered. It wasn't like he didn't have his own money. “Thanks for the offer, but no. I need activity."
Those memories were the only good thing Winter had. They were the only good he’d ever done. So, much had already been stolen from him. He wouldn’t allow this to be taken. Winter steadied himself enough to carve a message into the floor with his prosthetic arm. A precaution he hoped he wouldn’t need.
Rune peaked timidly, from the fluffy warm jacket in which he was wrapped, to look at the beta. She'd nearly thrown herself off the jet to save him. He didn't want to let that kind of person go. When he asked Piper what parents were, she’d told him,
Tony bathed his daughter. He feared his callused hands may hurt her, but she leaned into them seeking their touch. Her scent came through. She smelled of honey and lavender. The gentleness of her scent marked her as omega. His protective instinct grew. No matter how old she grew he protect her. He shut off the water and got out. Christina was unfazed by his nudity. She handed him some clothes.
He leaned against the rocky brittle. Steve took a small notepad from his utility belt. He started sketching out their surroundings. As night grew closer it grew cooler. Steve was grateful for the change. The next morning there was change inactivity. Natasha took up the binoculars again.
Rune’s gaze darted toward the alpha in the room. His aura was unlike any other he'd encountered before. Dangerous in a way that was different from those he'd met previously. It made him shiver. Piper hugged him.
No answer. She raised her head, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Winter was gone. He had been here just this morning. She instantly woke up, shooting from the bed. Her cell was truly empty. She went for the only item of comfort, Stanley the flattened rabbit, hugging it closely to her chest. Piper bit her lip barely fending off the tears.
Piper hissed as she burned her finger with soldering iron. With the amount of wealth they had, they should have been able to afford custom tools that fit in her hands, instead of her constantly injuring her hands using the adult size ones. She grabbed a Band-Aid from the box next to her, wrapping it around her finger.
She zipped out into the hall ahead of him. Stopping every ten feet for him to catch up. She never wandered far from him when outside of their enclosure. The pup knew that as long as she was within a ten-foot radius of him, no one would dare bother her, fearing the shear wrath of his presence.
“No,” Helmut acknowledged. He rubbed his face. "Let's not have this argument again. All I want to do is spend the day with my beautiful wife and our son."
“That leaves room for flexibility. Chemistry, physics, engineering doesn’t have that. What do you think of the human body?”
Piper took the pen and pad. “This contract is meaningless even if I do sign. I’m still only three. I could easily say I didn’t know what I was signing. And everyone would believe me.”
“I don’t have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I’ve sent it off. I know not where,” said Loki.
Steve carefully lifted Piper from the ground, breathing in her scent. This was real. He grabbed Tony's arm.
Tony took a breath. He hated easily he slipped into that territorial alpha tone when a threat was anywhere near Steve. It was something he had to get over. Their orders came. Tony smiled softly when Steve instantly dipped his French fry into his strawberry milkshake. It was a cute cork. The meal was cozy. He could tell Steve was holding back his appetite so he ordered something to go. They went home. Happy had gotten a good head start on them the boxes and paintings were unpacked in the garage. They moved the painting into the guest bedroom. Tony unwrapped one of the smaller paintings. It was 24x 30. It was a glowing blue cube floating in a black background.
"A three-year-old that was trained to be an assassin. She's not as much of a child as she used to be," said Tony.
She ran at him, jumping to his shield. He pushed her up onto the chariot. She made it. He dodged attacked. He had to keep moving.
Steve wrapped a clean dishtowel around the alpha’s foot and grabbed the first aid kit. Tony hissed as he pulled out a shard of the mug. Steve bandaged the wound.
“It will be fully protected by your healing and durability until its born. I wish there was more information on this, but that’s all I can tell you.”
Steve got up from the kitchen island and started gathering pillows. He had to build his nest. Steve wanted it to be ready. Tony watched him from the door as he worked. Only when Steve had built the to his highs standard did Tony join him. Steve purred as Tony’s fingers ran through his hair.
"You grossly overestimate my sway here. You forget this entire organization is your namesake. You can get me fired. I'm sure S.H.I.E.L.D. would go as far as getting my license revoked if I truly upset you."
"She won't come out until she's ready," said Rune. He stared up at the sky, admiring the stars. "Just let her figure it out."
The alpha took off. Moments later there was a sound of gunfire. It drew the guards from the entrance along with a flood of other men. They propelled down the side of the cliff and ran in with Steve at the lead. The two easily took care of the remaining men. The worked their way through the maze of paths at the back there was Rumlow. He was strapped to a chair and bloodied, but alive. There was duck tape across his mouth an improvement in Natasha’s opinion. She ripped off the tape.
“Remember that time during the Halloween party a couple of years ago, I picked up a confetti from your hair and combed it back with my fingers?”
The question seems disconnected from the rest, but Tony can see Stella has a destination in mind, and wants to lead him there slowly. Alright, he’ll play.
The tip of the cigarette lights up with the first drag, and the smoke filling his lungs deceives him, makes him feel like his stomach is filling too.
Tony twists around to look at Steve, and there’s a wild glint in his eyes, something impulsive and ruthless that he’s desperately trying to reign in. Tony reaches up with his arm, and there’s a bit of fumbling until Steve can press his face into Tony’s neck and Tony can do the same to him while still maintaining a comfortable position for knotting. It’s difficult, but they manage.
Tony lies back down on the blanket, and Steve does the same. After about half an hour, Tony is almost falling back asleep. It’s good that he’s calmed down enough for sleep to creep in again, but it’s still the third time today that Tony needs a nap. It’s too much, even accounting for the lost sleep of last night.
“Finish your visit. I need a moment alone,” he says, but the look on Steve’s face tells him he’s not going to give up so easily. “Please, Steve,” he tries, and Steve relaxes his shoulders and lets his hand go. Reluctantly, but he does it.
“Wait, let me say this. I don’t know if I make you better. So I don’t know if we make each other better. But I know that you—
Steve manages to snatch a tourist information booklet in English and reads about the towers. There were seventy-two of them in the 12th and 13th century, but now only sixteen have survived the passing of time, and they earned the city the nickname of Manhattan of the Middle Ages, which makes Steve laugh more than he probably should. Apparently, building towers was a way for the most powerful families to show how rich and influential they were. It got so out of hand that a law was made to prohibit private citizens from building towers that were taller than the Torre Rognosa, so they started building two or three at once, to prove they could afford it.
