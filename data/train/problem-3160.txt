"No need to thank me. Getting to watch you come is always my pleasure." Dean grins and hands Castiel a towel.
"I am sorry if I ever gave you the feeling that I'm uncomfortable even though I enjoyed what we did and do."
Dean grins. "That wasn't a no, don't bother trying." He says and digs his fingers into Castiel's ribs.
[2.12., 19:49] Dean: No no no. Like alarms. They are super smart and can be trained as scouts. They are fast and quiet and can alert the group if zombies are near
By the time he makes it back to Missouri he has a few minutes to spare before Cas appointment is over so he grabs two milkshakes across the street and waits.
Cas moans softly and goes on feeding Dean who has a glint in his eyes. He purposefully licks and sucks on Cas fingers every time he gets fed another piece.
Cas very slowly gets out, doing his best to keep his head down. As he comes out from under the car he tries to walk away keeping his back to the customer but the man stops him with his voice.
[8.12., 09:59] Castiel: That's not a thing that was going on in our relationship. Sex was a bedroom thing. She did never text during work hours.
Dean pulls him into a messy kiss and holds him close. "God damn! You may not generally like sex... but fuck are you good at it."
And apparently that's why I don't say them anymore. Missouri thinks I am subconsciously avoiding them in order to make sure that the person doesn't die."
The doorbell rings a a little while later and Dean opens the door, greeting the delivery men. "Morning guys. Just put everything near the couch please. Thank you."
Dean smiles too but he is nervous. He has been overthinking every single sexual encounter they had since Cas told him what his ex did.
Dean is thinking. "I don't like sleeping alone anymore or waking up alone. But we can try? You said sometimes you miss the early texting and stuff. And if we don't like it we just call it off, right doc?"
Dean nods but pulls Cas back in for another kiss. "Drive safe. And let me know when you are home please."
"Yes." Dean grabs his phone. "I'll set up an alarm on here. I swear I'd be lost without you keeping track."
"Dean!" Cas says louder. "I know why you're doing it. I get the fidgetiness after therapy. Just tell me if you would like to talk about therapy or not. That's all I'm asking. A simple no and I'll leave it alone."
[20.1., 10:51] Castiel: I meant my dilemma with you needing me and me not being in the mood for even remotely sexy things…
[13.1., 10:18] Dean: I told Garth to leave you alone and not to scare you away. The other 2 guys are on the truck today. So you are only with me, Garth and Rufus.
[31.3., 21:04] Dean: I'm in my bed. Sitting on top of my blanket dressed in those pink soft panties you gave me
"Hi. I missed you today and couldn't go home without a kiss and checking on you. Especially after a therapy day."
"Thanks babe. I was the slowest so I need to clean up and lock up. Everyone left. Give me 10 and I'll be ready to go home."
"Yeah? Me too. I'm glad you do. Its nice. And it shuts me up so you can watch your show." Dean laughs.
"Uh.... I... can I talk to Dean about that? He's on summer break, and we joked about a fake Europe Road trip."
"What did I just walk into? Why are you planning murder? Why did Gabe jump into my arms? I am so confused."
"It was... weird, interesting, funny, and fate. Well, initiated fate by my sister, but how else could I have met a perfect guy like Dean?"
[12.1., 14:46] Castiel: I know. I'm thinking about either visiting Gabe or spend the evening with my girlfriend and those three second favorite men…
"Good." Dean drives them to the massage place. "I made sure its an actual massage therapist and not just a massage parlor..."
Dean hears the news playing in the living room. "No news please. That shit is depressing. I rather watch another romantic comedy. "
She'd treated the bunker like a hostel, coming and going and hardly leaving a trace she was ever there.
"I can honestly say I haven't give it much thought, Dean," Sam says, looking like he's about to ask Dean if there's anything else he wants to admit to, and Dean doesn't want to give him the satisfaction, so he climbs inside the car and turns the music up before Sam can open his pinched little mouth again.
He drifts off, thinking about hypothetical someone elses. If he had longer than a month, he could start growing his hair out. Long hair, like his mother's. He'd have to tie it back to hunt, but at the end of a long day, he could let it down. He remembers how his mother used to do that, after a long day working around the house with her hair in a ponytail, or wrapped up in a bun, and the little relieved sigh that came along with letting loose. He only remembers little things like that about her now, almost thirty years later. Like the way it felt to hug her, to bury his face in her hair, smelling of shampoo and detergent. It might be nice to have long hair like that.
"You're saying I'm a bad example," Dean says, and knows he's correctly intuited the direction this conversation is going when Sam makes that little tight-mouthed face he makes. "For Lucifer's son?"
Castiel turns where she stands. Shadows carve hard lines across her features and make her blue eyes as dark as the sky. A long, curling lock of hair rests on her cheek.
"That's it?" Dean pulls a face as Cas shows them what she picked out. "New body, new you! Don't you wanna mix it up a little?"
. He nearly killed me, and I still didn't—" He grits his teeth, holding it back. Charlie doesn't need to hear this.
"Sam, you mind if I check out your setup?" Charlie points at the laptop. "I promise I won't go through your browser history."
Even when he was with Lisa, his whole life was packed away into one borrowed drawer and one bedside table. Anything worth keeping always had to be able to fit in the car. He's been living on a week's worth of clothes since he was four. Now he's got more space to fill than he knows what to do with. He's got room to grow.
"What happened to the lights?" Cas croaks. Dean just laughs harder, sitting back on his heels and wiping his chin. The alarm clock on the bedside table is flashing green,
"Yes, sir," Dean said, because that was what you did when John Winchester gave you an order. He'd learned that by now.
He leaves it on and puts his shirt back on, and the change is noticeable, at least to him. Just that one item of clothing, which nobody else can even see, has him looking at himself differently and feeling a lot more confident about this whole endeavor. He could totally nail this being a woman thing.
"I just—I mean, that's cool. Not cool that you broke up, but." Dean winces, because what the fuck is he
or anything; underwear from way back when sure leaves a lot to the imagination. He tosses his clothes to Cas, and she unfurls the folded jeans, studying them with narrowed eyes.
His waist isn't as small as he'd like it to be, he thinks, stepping back to get a better look. He's very square, and there's a little swell of fat and skin at the waistband of his boxer briefs. His stomach seems softer, too, poking out just a little at the front in a way that looks different. His underwear's too tight, though. He pats around, feeling the swell of his own ass. Yeah, that's, uh… that's different. He turns to the side, his eyes going round at the sight. Jesus Christ.
"Yeah. That and betting. Hustling pool. Not so many people who carry that much cash on 'em these days, though. And, uh, you know. Sometimes you clear out a vamp nest, and then you clear out their wallets after."
Dean's chest aches. Next to him, Cas sucks in a sharp breath and goes to Jack, taking his face in his hands before pulling him into a tight hug. Dean watches them a moment, suffocated, before he breathes in deep, coming up behind them, afraid to break the moment, but needing Cas to know what he means. When Cas pulls away from Jack, he looks up at Dean with wet, hopeful eyes. Dean nods. It doesn't feel like enough, but Cas smiles like Dean's given him a gift anyway. Then Sam's there too, a brief hand on the back of Dean and Castiel's necks.
Dean wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, striding down the hall to make sure Rowena hasn't gobbled up Cas's grace or anything like that.
Dean considers the point. He pulls a face, conceding, because now that she's spelling it out like that, he definitely gets it. He'd be lying to himself if he said it had never occurred to him that Benny could have drained him dry without breaking a sweat, probably dozens of times. A couple of times Dean might even have let him, though Benny was too good a guy to have gone for it.
Dean tilts him back, one hand splayed across his shoulders, the other gripping his hip, until he's laid out flat on the bed. Dean lifts his hips up, tugging his boxers down his thighs and lifting his legs in the air until he can pull them off completely. Cas hasn't shaved—anywhere in fact, which—he guesses that makes sense. Why would he? It's another detail about this Dean never could have imagined, any of the times he actually allowed himself to imagine it, that just kind of makes everything that much more perfect, because that means it's actually
towards Cas more times in one hour than he has in their entire years-long acquaintance. There was a time when this might have annoyed Castiel, or even disgusted him. Now it moves him, though the proper way to react still eludes him. He does not know how to be a brother to him as Dean is. He only knows how to be a brother-in-arms. He would, and has lain down his life for Sam, for Dean, for Mary. Living with them is still a work in progress.
"Do you think she's okay?" Sam asks after she goes. He's slowed down, nursing a beer that he probably intends to be his last for the night.
now, but she's my ride, and I'm pretty sure she wants to leave with stupid fucking Sean, and the last thing I want to do right now is spend thirty dollars on a cab, but it's that or third-wheel them all the way back to her place while he's talking big game about his stupid… fucking…
He takes a shower even though it's 3 AM, scrubs until he can't feel blood caking under his nails, and when he comes back out wrapped in a towel, Castiel is still sitting right where he left her on the bed, watching the bathroom door. He rushes past, digging for his clothes in his travel bag.
There was no time, in Purgatory, to think of what Dean looked like to anyone else. How anyone would perceive him. There was no time to think of what he had left behind on Earth. Stopping to think would give death an opening. He had a promise to fulfill. In a way, it was Dean's life's work distilled down to its purest form.
Sam purses his lips. "I don't think it's an act." He can tell Dean's about to protest, because he adds, "
"That's not— Of course not, but… Come on, Dean." Sam pushes himself up, walks over to talk quietly to Dean, like they're not in a room the size of a walk-in closet. "I think we should keep an eye on her for a while."
"It's not a waste," Dean says, but he brings his hands up to cup Castiel's jaw, skimming his thumbs over his bristling cheeks while he kisses him again. "You're here, right?"
"That's bullshit, man." Dean ducks his head, trying to catch her eyes, but she doesn't move. "We're the ones who wanted you to—" He looks up, glancing around the room to see if anyone's around to hear them. He speaks again, a little lower. "We told you to kill him."
When she finally wakes, it's just to tell Dean to put on something a little less grating. He grumbles for a minute before switching out
-sexy. If he holds still enough, he can see them wobble in time with his heartbeat. Cool, but weird.
His heart nearly launches itself out through his throat when the door swings open and Sam walks in, greasy paper bags in hand. Dean coughs, wiping his hand over his face like that'll wipe the red from his cheeks, and turns his back to the doorway, planting his hand on his hip in faux-nonchalance.
"Uh-huh. And whose fault is that?" Charlie looks amused as he tries to fold his legs into the passenger side.
," Bobby said, equally horrified. "But you are gonna be stuck like that for a month. Once the moon cycles through back to where it was when she zapped you, you should just go back to normal."
And he's handsome, even if it's borrowed handsomeness. All those big ideas and contradictions sheathed in that perfectly normal human vessel make him something, someone different. Someone special. It's not hard to think that would appeal to some woman out there.
"Think he does. I mean, look at this," he says, and pushes Dean's thighs down, fucking him deeper, the loud slap of skin on skin filling the room. Dean can't hold back the sounds he's been biting his tongue against. "Look at you, you slut."
"Dean," Castiel says, like there's nothing that brings him more joy. Just saying his name. He holds Dean's hand, knife pointed down at their feet, against his sternum, stepping close enough to share breath. Castiel's lips are dry and chapped, parted open on a sigh. "Dean."
"Sammy," Dean says, and starts wiping things down with a dishtowel. Sam closes the door, empty-handed, and slicks his hair back.
Dean swallows, a hard knot twisting in his gut. Sam's already looking at him like he's trying to puzzle him back together from entirely new pieces. It's not rejection, but Dean can't stand it, and he has to look away.
"I was, like, twelve, thirteen, and I hadn't ever actually liked someone like that before, but when you're an angry girl, and you don't wear the clothes people think you're supposed to, and you're not interested in the things you're supposed to like, and you're not nice to boys the way they think you're supposed to be, people… decide things. About what you're like, what you—what you are.
The thing is, he knows he's being a coward, and he still can't stop himself. It's a gut reaction, as intrinsic to him now as sleeping with his gun under his pillow, or doing a sweep of a room every time he walks in, checking for potential exits or ambush points. It's instinct, written into his code somewhere so deep he can't really pick out one particular instance to say,
Dean tries to speak, and it comes out as a whimper. Castiel's face crumples, and she swipes a thumb across his forehead, cradling his face. Ice-cold, her grace shivers through him, then just as suddenly, he's warm all over, the rabbit-pace of his heartbeat easing. His throat relaxes, and air rushes into his lungs. His head swims with it. Cas just keeps stroking her fingers across his temple, through his hair. When he feels like he can sit up without getting dizzy, he pushes her away, tearing the sheets off and staggering into the bathroom. He can't look her in the eye right now.
"Not a problem, hon," Mina says, taking one last sip of her cherry pie cocktail. "Let me get your tab, I gotta thank you for helping me out."
Dean turns to look at her, then, feeling some of the calm weariness seeping back into his limbs. He sees her more clearly now, without his heart in his throat. It's been around a year since they met, on what he can guess was probably the worst day of Jody's life, because that's usually the case in his line of work. He hasn't asked if she's been all right, but he can guess that too. She's working the night shift, with new lines by her mouth and dark circles under her eyes, and she's wasting her time worrying about his dumb ass.
"You've been gone for twelve hours," Cas says, irritation bleeding through. "I promise I'm not so incompetent I can't occupy my son and one witch for one day."
"Anyone ever done this to you before?" Dean asks quietly. His tongue darts out, lapping at Cas's entrance just enough to tease, to get him wet, but not enough to really get him anywhere.
He swallows hard, trying to keep his breathing steady. He's going through some shit right now. Sam coming back and dashing the last faint shred of hope he'd been clinging to of being a normal guy with a normal life. It's not a huge shock that he might feel like being someone else for a little while. Being Dean Winchester comes with so much baggage. It was a relief to think he might be able to drop some of it for a little while.
"Yeah, all right." Dean covers his face, wincing. He keeps his eyes shut through the sound of clothes rustling, the sink running, and finally, the door opening and closing, followed by heavy silence.
"Okay. Good." Dean kisses him again, lingering a moment this time, and Cas sighs into it, letting himself be held.
"Okay. Plan B. Back to the compound, hit the books, try to figure out ways to undo a…" Sam looks at Dean oddly. "Sex change incantation."
"But yeah, uh, Sam's back now, so I guess we're gonna eat and hit the sack. If we can catch up with the vamps tomorrow morning, we might be back before the day's out."
A thought occurs to him. He digs through the front pouch on his travel bag and emerges with his old bracelet and his ring. He'd given up wearing them while he was working construction, but now's as good a time as any to start again. He leaves his watch behind—it's a little too masculine. But while the ring doesn't fit on the intended finger, it does fit on his thumb, and it doesn't look too bad. He slips the bracelet on his other hand and doesn't think about how he's just putting on things he already owns to beef up his lady vibes.
"Frances Krawczyk died of Spanish Influenza in 1918 and was buried in a mass grave in New York. It doesn't track, given where I… woke up. All I know is that I
"I don't give a shit Lee's a hunter. If I catch you after sneaking around in some shithole with him again, I'll black his eye. You come home by midnight. You stay home. That's part of the job."
"I like listening to you talk," Dean says, 'cause it's true. It's weirdly a total relief to hear about a normal person's problems for a change. It's also a relief not to have to explain whatever's going on with him to anyone else. Just the thought of it makes him want to drink until he can't think anymore. He's floating along pleasantly right now, and he'd hate to ruin that.
He cleans himself up and limps back outside. He honestly feels like he could curl up and sleep in the car, but he knows he needs to wash away the evidence before Sam sees him in the morning. He adjusts the rearview mirror to take a long, drowsy look at himself. Just a slice of his face, the smudged black makeup around the same old eyes he's always had. It's just him. At the end of the night, it's always just him.
This is another thing he's picked up after a year of watching Lisa go through her morning routine. The only other woman he'd been so close with was Cassie, and she hadn't ever let Dean in on her morning routine. She just always showed up looking perfectly put together. Lisa was the one that showed him how much work must have gone into that. He starts with the eyeliner, leaning over the sink and trying to line it up with his lash line. It's harder than it looks, keeping a steady hand and not stabbing yourself in the eye. Dean wondered why Lisa always had to make a goofy face while she applied makeup, but he finds himself doing it without meaning to. The lines are shakier than he wants, and he has to go over them a few times to get them sort of even. Then he has to repeat the process on the other side, which means even more frustration as he tries to match the coverage on both eyes. He ends up with much thicker eyeliner than he intends.
Cas is taken by the desire to keep feeding him, to fill him up until Dean is finally satisfied. He wants to give Dean everything. Around him, Dean goes lax, and Cas pushes inside until he can feel the flutter of Dean's throat. A sound escapes Cas, an involuntary, helpless noise. Dean swallows. Cas's hips stutter, and Dean coughs.
Dean puts down his drink and maneuvers so that his arm is draped over Charlie's back, and that leaves it so she can tuck her head under his chin. After a minute of getting his breathing under control, enjoying it while trying not to be a total chick-flick about it, he asks, "The fuck is meatspace?"
"Who's there?" comes Haleigh's quivering, tearful voice. Dean and Sam exchange looks, relaxing their stances. Whatever Haleigh is, she's pretty convincingly not a threat.
"You don't have to participate if you're uncomfortable, Jack," Cas says. Jack looks back, eyes lowering in thought before he meets his eyes again.
The voice on the phone isn't one that Dean recognizes, except for the part where there's only one person it could be. But that doesn't make sense either. It's impossible.
Dean laughs unsteadily, running his fingers back through his hair. He chews on the inside of his cheeks. "A lot. A lot happened. I dunno if we really broke up, we weren't really…
But the wind is whipping around him, cool and sharp, and Dean is pressed against him from shoulder to knee, warm and solid, blood pumping wildly in his excitement, and Cas tells him, "Yes, a little."
"He, he doesn't—" Dean protests, but breaks off into a moan when Thien licks his thumb and presses it to Dean's clit.
He stomps his way into the library, which is basically a dining room with a desk and a lot of ramshackle bookshelves. He starts skimming through titles, barely reading them, needing to backtrack and make second passes frequently because he's too worked up to focus. If he had his way, he'd say fuck the whole Campbell clan and Sam too, and just drive straight off to Bobby's instead. Then he thinks about Bobby seeing him like this and he feels sick to his stomach.
"Good. Okay. I'm sorry I'm being such a headcase," Mina says, and Dean stops her with a kiss pressed to her chin. He lingers over her mouth, a question. Mina sighs and pulls him in the rest of the way as an answer.
"Yeah, me neither." Dean says, frowning at his own reflection and picturing it on the cover of a tabloid.
"We can discuss whatever you'd like," Cas says, but he's not helping the situation at all by skimming his fingers over Dean's hipbones, where the blankets have bunched up at their waists.
Castiel watches him, a simple joy he has indulged in often in his time on Earth. The pleasing lines of his profile against the black sky, the wrinkles that gather by the corners of his eyes and the angle of his jaw. Castiel is allowed to touch him, now, in ways that he hadn't dared before. It was always Dean who had drawn up those invisible lines, and who was therefore the only one who had been allowed to cross them. Everything had been at Dean's pace, at Dean's say so. Even now, knowing the ways Dean says he loves him, knowing the many shapes his desire takes, Cas is uncertain how much he is allowed. Even just to watch is sometimes a line crossed, so he takes the opportunity greedily.
She'd kissed his lips, leaving her lipstick behind, and said, "Obviously," and stroked him through the satin until he came with her seated on his face. She had a floor-length mirror in her bedroom, and lying there on his back with her slick still on his mouth, he saw himself and liked the way he looked, soft and spent and oddly delicate, and he'd thought,
"But even if you never get it," Dean says, "You gotta have something to look forward to, Cas. Something
Based on the progress I'm making in the fic, I've set the number of chapters at 7. Might grow down the line depending on how it shakes out, but I think that's where it's gonna land! Thanks to everyone for reading and commenting. <3
Dean re-emerges from the motel office with a key dangling from his finger. Cas looks closer for signs of unease or mistrust, but Dean is still so hard to read. Cas tries to make himself useful by carrying Dean's duffel, locking Baby's doors behind himself and trailing behind Dean at what he hopes is a respectful distance.
"Then let's hope you can track them efficiently," Cas says pleasantly. "I've been thinking about what I'd like to do for you next time I see you."
After a few minutes, Sam frowns, looking down at his hands. "You know what Cas and Rowena are trying to do, right?"
"Right. Got it." He has not got it. "That was—that was stupid, and, you know, it makes sense. Like, if I were a chick, I'd wanna be a chick I thought was hot," he says before he can stop himself. "Hypothetically," he adds, when Charlie looks at him oddly. "But… I dunno, if you date people you wanna be like, don't you just get jealous or feel… like, not good enough?"
"Around." Cas approaches the table, placing a hand on the surface on front of him. Her jaw is set in a challenge. Right, Dean almost definitely deserves that. She looks at him defiantly for a minute before she seems to grow awkward, looking down and around at the rest of the room instead of meeting his eyes. "How have you been?"
Castiel's expression softens, his eyes scanning Dean's face. He reaches up to wipe a droplet of water from Dean's stubbled chin. Dean swallows.
He sits in the garage, listening to the dead air settle, for a while. Then he heaves himself up, groaning at the way his knees don't cooperate quite like they used to anymore, and goes to shower, to wash the grime from under his nails and shave.
"Yes," Castiel says. "He had fallen into the pit— a pit," she amends, and Dean's hand tightens on hers, steadying her. "I… pulled him out."
Dean sinks bonelessly into the sagging mattress, trying to catch his breath. His skin is still flushed and red, all across his face and down to the purple mark on his neck. The hem of his black shirt is stained, and his softening cock rests against his stomach, over the band of his boxers. Cas wants to take another picture, but he doesn't know if Dean will be as permissive in this instance. Cas's hand is sticky with Dean's come. He licks his palm, then sucks each of his fingers into his mouth, swallowing whatever he can. Now part of Dean is inside him as well. It's a pleasing thought.
"Panicked?" Dean says, feeling shrill. "Yeah, maybe a little! Look, was everything… normal, when you woke up this morning?"
Castiel's shoulders draw tight at the first catches of Dean's fingers in her hair, but as he reaches the last knots and coaxes them out, she relaxes, melting back into the cushions. It becomes oddly meditative, the familiar sounds of a movie Dean's seen a dozen times washing over him, an easily solvable task in front of him, and Cas pliantly allowing her head to be tilted this way and that as Dean works, until the brush runs through smoothly and without obstruction. He keeps brushing for a few minutes just for the simple satisfaction of it before he separates the hair into three sections, weaving them together the way he'd been taught once, years before.
The whiskey is right where he left it in the glove compartment, and he takes a long pull, gasping after he swallows, his throat burning.
"Cas," Dean says, low and rough against his temple. His lips are dry, and they catch against his skin. "Fuck, please don't do that again. I can't take it, man. Not again." His fingertips press into Cas's scalp, scratching though his hair. The feeling tingles through him, light and sharply pleasant. Dean's lips press against his brow, too firm to be anything but deliberate. Cas hasn't felt so buoyant since his wings could still carry him, yet he feels like he would crash to the ground were he not being held firmly upright.
"I don't know what's going on with you. But we don't have to talk about it right now. I'm just asking you to stick around. Just be here. Can you please just do that? For a little while?" Sam's voice resonates in his chest. Dean gets him to let go long enough that he can wipe at his eyes with his thumb and forefinger. He gives one curt nod. Sam breathes out haltingly.
"What’s the point of saving humanity if you don't get to be a part of it?" Dean's chest clenches painfully to think of a world Cas saved without him in it. "You deserve to enjoy it as much as anyone, Cas. More than most people, honestly, even if you are a dick sometimes."
"I suppose," Rowena says with a flick of her eyebrows. "If that helps you understand it. What matters is that I'm
Mina folds up the slip of paper, sliding it into a book on her side table. "Yeah, sure," she says, holding her lower lip between her teeth. "Um… thanks."
"Yeah, I don't think Samuel's in any hurry to take me to the Father-Daughter Dance," he says, eyes glued to the hand gripping his glass. His fingernails are still just as blunt and dirty as ever. What would they look like longer, maybe with a little polish? What color would he go for? Red's a little obvious, but he's always been a fan of the classics. Or maybe black and glossy, like Baby.
Then Sam is leaving too, his large hand squeezing Cas's shoulder before he walks back to their motel. Dean watches him leave, and then his eyes slide right back over to Cas, darting all over him, like he's looking for the blood that had stained his shirt, or the leathery cracking of his skin. He looks at Cas's mouth, clean and pink, no evidence that just a few hours ago, he was vomiting up his own rotten, blackened insides, dying on the floor of a barn, and then he drinks, and drinks, and drinks. When closing time comes and forces them out, Cas slings Dean's arm over his shoulder and helps him walk, just as Mary had done for him. This, too, he has learned, is what family is meant to do.
He dips his middle finger inside himself, not too far, just to the first joint. He feels around a little. Should he have a hymen or something? Is that a myth? He's got his tattoo, so obviously the body isn't
"Fuck, what time is it," Dean huffs. He grinds against Cas, feeling the head of his dick nudging at Cas's clit, and his leg tightens where it's wrapped around Dean's, a heel digging into the back of his thigh to pull him closer.
He feels Cas easing him to the bed distantly, and there's a tickling sensation on his brow. Castiel's grace tingles over his skin, leaving him feeling clean and refreshed. Then Cas is with him again, pulling the covers up and crowding up behind him, curling an arm over his stomach. Dean dozes off that way, light and untroubled, Castiel's steady body against his back.
He was right about the panties, though. They feel nice. The band is more forgiving on his stomach, fitting over his hips in a way that flatters the curves, and the material sort of glides over his skin. He can't see himself full-body in the bathroom mirror, but he likes that they match the bra. He tugs the new jeans on, and then a green tank, and looks at himself again, marveling at how much of a difference it all makes together. He can't speak for anyone else, but he really thinks he's pulling it off. It's not too different, but it's just different enough.
They all gather in the basement, preparing the spell in an empty room which Rowena selects because it's out of the way and easy to clean, the thought of which ramps Dean's anxiety up a few notches, because what's the blast radius on this thing, exactly? She draws a sigil in chalk on the floor and lights white candles that make Dean's eyes water. She also asks Cas to undress, which Dean puts his foot down about.
Dean's too tall, his body too long for her to kiss him while she tiptoes her fingers down his stomach and under the band of his panties. He feels enormous next to her, somehow, taking up too much space in her little bedroom. She tugs the cups of his bra down to expose his nipples, a fun loophole to his bra-on rule that lets her slide her fingers into him while she mouths at his breasts. He does like that, the wet heat of her mouth followed by a shock of cold. She tries to slide his panties off, and he stops her again, praying she doesn't make him explain. Thankfully, she just keeps going, working his clit between her fingers.
"So?" Samuel sets his mug down, pushing his chair back from the battered kitchen table. "What was the emergency?"
"Yes, Dean, I don't want you to be a weird dick about… about this kind of thing in front of the mega-powerful half-angel teen-baby, okay? Please don't take this the wrong way," Sam says, in a tone of voice that clearly indicates he thinks Dean has already taken it the wrong way. "I know you're not like… I mean, I know this is just… Dad's shit."
The nightclub the vampires use as their hunting ground is a lot more populous than Dean would have guessed. Apparently, darkness is in this year. He's only surprised there's no rave.
Cas walks in when he's grimacing through his third sip, still dressed down to his shirt and slacks. He's not even wearing shoes, Dean notices now. He freezes mid-motion.
When he goes on a hunt with Sam, he expects they'll see some kind of action. A little adrenaline, a little hot-blooded firefight. Maybe he ends the day with a few bruises and a split lip, or worse, but he also sleeps like a damn baby. He woke up this morning expecting a chase. Now he's like a dog in a kennel, all pent up with nowhere to run.
"Fuck. I'm sorry." Dean can't look at her, can't look at the way he's leaving her with kiss-bitten lips, alone, in the dark, because he's too chicken-shit not to. "I can't."
"If you girls are done?" Samuel says with a roll of his eyes. And evidently he's not the family picnic type, because he's back on the road inside of five minutes.
He's still working up the nerve to dial him up when the sound of boots on the floorboards and tires crunching over gravel breaks the quiet. A couple of hunters tromp through, packing up supplies.
Dean excuses himself to get dinner for the group. Cas offers to come, but Dean declines. He needs some damn breathing room right now. He hops into Baby, rolls the window down, turns the tunes up, lets the familiar rumble of the engine in his arms and thighs soothe him like a lullaby.
He can't control the sounds coming out of him anymore. His hand is making wet sounds where he's fucking himself, and every time he breathes it comes out high and needy,
He could still be grateful, if he really tried. John was just a man from a different era trying to make sure his son didn't attract the wrong kind of attention. He was protecting Dean. He was doing his best. And so what if his best isn't what you'd expect of a father nowadays? Maybe if he'd been allowed to live, he could've become that kind of father. He never got the chance.
"The amount of power required for this… With Jack being a target right now, we could be inviting more trouble than it's worth."
but didn't. Dad liked Lee, respected him. He said he liked hunting with him, that he had a good head on his shoulders and a mean right hook, even though it pissed him the hell off when Lee, who was older than Dean and should've had his dumb early-twenties bullshit far behind him, brought him back half-senseless smelling like cigarette smoke and stale beer.
"Yeah?" Dean's stomach flutters again. He knows how to follow this script as a man, but he's not sure that still applies here. Is she asking if he needs to use her bathroom?
"I don't have a preference," Castiel says, still too busy smiling at Jack, taking in the face he hasn't been able to see until now. "Gender has never had the same importance to angels that it does to humanity. If my appearance means it's easier for you to think of me as a woman, it makes no difference to me."
Dean's still fighting a losing battle with the anxious fluttering in his stomach when they step into the library. He frowns, breathing in sharply through his nose when the air makes his eyes sting, and smells smoke. He hears the start of Sam raising his voice in a question just as a high-pitched scream splits the air. Time narrows around Dean; before he can tell his legs to move, he's running.
He scrubs his fingers through his hair, manipulating it so that it looks purposefully messy, and admires himself from a few angles. He hasn't actually changed anything about his body since this morning, but he looks different. He
The original plan was to keep pushing until they got to Lebanon, but that's not happening now. It's another fifteen minutes to get to the edge of town where they might be able to find a flophouse that rents to folks like them at 3 AM. Dean steals glances at Cas in the rearview the whole way, cheeks heating when her eyes catch his in the reflection. They're blue, he notices, just as blue as before, and he turns back to the road, his grip tightening on the wheel.
Dean's stomach drops. No, he hasn't. He's kind of given up on praying to Cas, because Cas spent a year letting him go to metaphysical voicemail. There were nights when the only thing that'd get those memories out of his head—Lucifer talking with Sam's face, Castiel exploding into a mist of gore, the snap of Bobby's neck and the crunch of Dean's jaw under Sam's knuckles, Sam tumbling into an endless abyss—the only thing that made it bearable was drinking himself to unconsciousness. He knows that some of those nights, only halfway to a blackout, he was low enough to go to his knees, begging Cas to come back.
Hell changes things. Dean gets that better than anyone, and he's afraid to even think it... but it's a little like Sam never came back at all. Like maybe he's still dead, and just walking around and breathing and blinking like he's not.
Something about this hunt has Dean distracted. Cas can't pinpoint what it is yet. He likes to think that he can read Dean fairly well by now, though they still misunderstand one another often. The only person who might know him better is Sam. But Cas knows there are things about Dean that Sam is not privy to, that only Castiel has been granted. He loves Sam, knows how important Sam is to Dean, but the thought still fills him up, a warm and bubbling feeling of pride. If they could see the smug way his feathers puffed and swelled—but they can't. Cas sips his black coffee quietly. Another thing for him alone to know.
Dean spends the next few days in the garage. Baby's had about all the tinkering she can take, but there are half a dozen other cars in there, and Dean needs something to focus on. He lifts the hoods, judges the damage. Mostly it's just neglect. They were all in pristine condition when the Men of Letters were wiped off the map, and they've been saved from real rust and decay by the bunker itself.
Clean and dressed in different clothes, he puts on a pot of coffee. It's nearly dawn anyway. When Bobby tromps his way down the creaking stairs and comes into the kitchen, he gives Dean a measured look.
tucked into the middle row, front and center. He sets his beer down and goes to have a closer look. The spine is cracked and nearly illegible, but he can still pick it out. He spent enough time reading it over the years. All those books are just ash now, Dean thinks. He reaches out with one finger to pull it out.
He turns the faucet off. When he dresses and walks back out into the room, all Sam cares about is what he saw in the nest. Like he saw anything but cages full of girls tortured into being feral animals. That could have been him, if he were just a little weaker, a little less prepared. That was almost him.
"Cas, get over here," Dean mutters, then Cas is on him again, pushing back the covers and tangling his legs with Dean's. This body he's in is long and skinny, and Dean's hand feels big spanning over his ribs. None of that changes how strong Cas is, and he's a little shocked when Cas easily shoves him back against the bed, holding his chin with one stern hand so he can lick his way back into Dean's mouth. It's a little filthy and completely perfect, and Dean's unbelievably hard against Castiel's thigh. Dean bites down on Cas's lip and is rewarded for it when Cas hisses and bucks down into him, perfect dragging friction.
He's startled out of his spiraling thoughts when Charlie sighs wistfully. He refocuses on the screen. Galadriel is staring into Frodo's eyes, glittering and intense. She's about to go nuclear on him, and when she does Charlie bites her lip in excitement, then mouths along when Cate Blanchett bellows,
"Soup's good," she says, smiling encouragingly at him. "Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on young Master Winchester."
It's a lot more abstract than that. Some kind of a confidence thing. Or at least it is for him. Looking at a guy and thinking he's cool, he's tough, he's got style, and being drawn to that— that's pretty normal, he thinks.
out here in the field? I don't. Cause what matters is I know how to do my job, and I do it well. Doesn't matter how much useless shit you memorize."
"Nah, it's no problem," Dean says, and sets the bottle on the ground, gesturing for Cas to stand in front of him, facing away. She goes obediently, tilting her head back to allow him better access.
He feels the sharp press of Charlie's shoulder into his bicep. Her hand slips into his, squeezing. His jaw trembles, and he shuts his eyes tight, willing it to stop. She lets him breathe, gives him time to collect himself. The kitchen is quiet, aside from the faint ticking of the clock on the far wall, and the low hum of the fridge.
and then he imagines someone else saying that to him, and it drives him even further. Oh god, he's so on display. If someone else were there, they could smack his ass, and it would be so loud in that little motel room. They could call him whatever they wanted. They could mouth at the back of his neck and bite down on his shoulder. They could fuck him raw and come all over his back and make an even bigger mess out of him, and he'd
Sam signs to Jack, mouthing the word "jealous" with his back turned to Rowena. Jack gives him a goofy smile.
Something bursts within him, white hot, and without him as well, flooding the little room with light and sound, the pop and burn of a dozen fuses. Cas comes, half into Dean's open mouth, but misses just as much, marking his flushed face with white. There's a stripe across his cheek, interrupting the constellation of his freckles, and some escapes his mouth, dribbling over his lips and chin. He swipes his tongue across it, trying to take more. Still hungry. Cas's cock throbs and pulses a few more weak gushes onto Dean's waiting tongue. Dean laves his tongue over the softening head until there's nothing left. Then, through the blissful haze Cas finds himself in, he realizes that it's gotten dark, and that Dean is laughing, low and rough under his breath.
"No," Cas says, and when she looks up, her eyes are so sad it makes his chest hurt. "I spoke to Jack, I learned what he could be, and I loved him. And then I did what you taught me. I fought for him."
"I don't believe the fishsticks to be divine," says Castiel. "But the burning bush warrants investigation."
plays the opening notes of "In the Light" he just ejects it again, pulling off onto the shoulder and sitting in the idling car in silence. He pulls his phone out for the first time since he started driving. To his surprise, he's got a missed message from Cas.
"No, I know that," Dean groans. "I'm just— I dunno." He paces in the empty room, anxiously peeking out the window to see if Sam's back with dinner yet. Dean's never been one to complain about fast food, but if he's honest, he's gotten kind of used to cooking for himself. It's been… well, nice, not to have to eat stuff that came out of a bag all the time. It makes him feel accomplished when something comes out just the way he imagined it. It feels like a job well done, keeping his family fed. "It's not— I trust you, Cas, of course I do."
Dean's hands grasp Castiel beneath his coat, pulling him closer so he can crush his whole body to Dean's while he kisses him. Castiel only breaks away to throw his leg over Dean's lap, going up on his knees to bend down to kiss him again. "When I found you, you were in pieces. They'd stamped you out to embers, trampled you down, and I held you, this… flickering little soul," Castiel whispers, pressing kisses to Dean's jawline, "and I saw your death, and your life, all the ways it had tried to douse your fire, and you were so
Dean thinks about Cas, holding his hand, calling his soul 'beautiful'. He thinks about Benny, all loyalty and trust, while he stood there and watched Dean take a blade to his neck. Then he drinks until he can't think about it anymore.
In the morning, Cas hears his phone chime from the heap of clothes still lying on the floor. He carefully extracts himself from Dean's warm, inviting body. There's a text from Jack.
"You're awful," she moans, smacking his leg with the back of her hand. "No, it's not! Not all anime is porno! And we
"I do," Dean says, and tugs the woman—Cas, he tells himself, this chick in her funny little hat and her theater geek getup is
sorry, I'm just a little… Bad breakup," Dean says, another sort-of-truth. "A little while ago, but I haven't really… been with anyone else since then."
Castiel's fingers flex under his, spreading out so that Dean's weave between them. When Dean looks back up, his eyes are achingly soft, his mouth curved in a barely-there smile. Cas leans in close. Dean's eyes flutter shut, and Castiel lays a kiss right between them, one burning touch to his brow.
"I don't do roleplay before the third date," she says, and sticks out her tongue. She's too short to kiss him when he's standing up, not without him leaning down to meet her halfway, but she solves the issue by sitting him down and climbing into his lap again.
"Band kids fuck," Dean says, shaking his head. Gwen sputters, spraying his cheek with beer. Dean wipes it off on his sleeve with a grimace. "I'm dead serious. No high schooler is more sexually active than a Band geek. Believe me, I've been to a lot of high schools. They're all playing each others' trumpets all the time."
He has the presence of mind to make sure the guy puts on a condom. Everything after that defies logic. Dean's strong. He's fought any number of supernatural assholes bare-handed. He ought to fight when he's shoved to his back on the bed, but he goes down like dead weight, the springs creaking riotously under him. The guy kneels over him, the mattress dipping, and unbuttons his fly, the sound of the sinking zipper drawing a shiver down Dean's spine. The guy doesn't bother with Dean's bra beyond tugging it down to his ribs. His breasts spill out, the straps sliding over his shoulders, and he must make a face, 'cause the guy laughs, and gives one a squeeze. Dean's skin is so hot he thinks he must be the same shade of red as his lipstick. He hikes Dean's legs up over his hips and bends him wherever he wants, tugging his panties to the side. The elastic presses against Dean's clit. He whines without meaning to.
"I want to do that for you. I want to see you..." Cas mouths at Dean's chin, at his own wetness streaking Dean's jaw, at the beginnings of Dean's stubble, then down towards his ear, enthusiastic and aimless.
It's a relief when they finally pull into the garage at the bunker, to be stretching his legs and looking forward to the prospect of a dark, quiet bedroom to nurse his headache in. It's also a relief to put some space between him and Cas, because being constantly aware of her at his back was starting to make him feel kind of insane. Apparently, Cas feels the same way, because she's gone before Dean's done unloading the car. He and Jack carry the bags inside while Sam helps Rowena get to her feet.
The wind caresses his bare legs. The back of Dean's neck prickles as he remembers how he's dressed, what he must look like.
"Whatcha think, Cas?" he says, leaning in to speak directly into Cas's ear, not quite a yell, but close. "This anything like having your wings back?"
Dean catches him at it, and Cas can tell how it embarrasses him from how he flinches away, covering the skin of his neck with his hand. But he doesn't tell Cas to stop. He only nods to the Impala, an invitation.
"No you aren't," Cas snaps. Dean, startled, looks back to see her reflected in the mirror. She still won't look at him, but her cheeks are splotchy red, her lips thin and pale.
He ends up with fishnet stockings, black nail polish, and a black choker. That'll have to be enough to sell the look, cause he's not getting his ears pierced at a mall kiosk, and if Dean has to listen to one more whiny kid scream about lipstick stains over an out-of-tune guitar, he's gonna shoot the damn speakers out. He shoves it all into his secret bag of girly shit and drags it back to the motel. Maybe he can pass it off as having just bought all of it in one go.
"Jesus, I dunno, Cas," Dean says, covering his face with his hand, hunched over with an elbow on his knee. "Sex is weird. Your wires get crossed. Sometimes people like getting, you know, called names. Sometimes they like getting slapped. Some people do it with like, harnesses and handcuffs and shit. It doesn't always make sense, it just feels good. But you don't
"Said a lot of stuff last night, a'course," Dean mumbles, letting his mouth press against Castiel more deliberately. Cas sighs faintly above him, and his arms wrap more closely around him, which has the very positive side effect of pressing his breasts against Dean's cheek. "I might need to, uh…" Dean turns his head to press a lazy kiss to one hardening nipple. "...wake up a little more, first."
Even Sam can't argue with the amenities, though. Dean's gone full tilt, drilling pegs into the wall of his bedroom to display his favorite weapons, putting out the family pictures he's had folded up in his wallet for years, while Sam still seems to be treating the place like a free motel. But Dean's seen the growing collection of toiletries in Sam's corner of the shower room, so he hasn't given up hope that Sam will come around.
"Right!" Jack grins, just as pleased as punch. Yeah, they're doing a bang-up job raising the antichrist all right.
"I dunno," Dean mutters. His whole head feels like it's burning, and it's not just the alcohol. "Maybe—maybe six."
. I thought maybe it would be harder. To tell. If someone dies kinda peacefully, like that, in bed, but. Her face was..."
Dean gapes. "Yeah, to the bunker. Not— here." Wherever here is. Now that he's apparently cured of his hangover, he's starting to remember stumbling down the road towards this motel from the bar. He winces, realizing he left the car in the other parking lot. That's probably where his gun is now.
Cas, for his part, is sitting up, one hand on Dean's collarbone, the other slung across the headboard. The hand on Dean's chest tickles a bit, sending tingles of a different sort across Dean's skin.
Sam comes into the room, and Dean tries to look busy while avoiding his eyes. Lucky for him, Sam doesn't seem to want to force a touchy-feely conversation with him about
It's just him in the motel, though, because Sam had Dean drop him at the Campbell compound. Because apparently Sammy and Samuel are two peas in a creepy little undead pod now. Neither of them need Dean; makes him wonder what they bothered roping him back in for, when they lost him damn near everything doing it. It's a Monday, closer to seven A.M. than Dean's used to sleeping in 'til. Ben should be down at the corner waiting on the bus soon, finishing off the eggs and toast Dean made just the way he liked them (overdone and underdone, respectively). That hurts a different way, and he shakes it off, focusing on the things he can deal with. He's got aspirin, he's got more liquor. He's got a motel shower that will hopefully dispense water a degree or two hotter than lukewarm. He steps onto the worn carpet and staggers into the bathroom.
He can't look at Cas for long. It makes him feel too much, his head too full. He can still feel his eyes on him, on his face, on his body, watching some other man's dick plunge into him, making him arch and strain and clench his fists into the sheets. It's been more than a year since Cas told him he'd never been with anyone like this before. Has that changed? Dean doubts it. Does Cas even know what it feels like, or can he only guess from watching? Dean wants him to know it's good, wants him to know what he's missing out on. He bites his lip between sharp teeth.
Cas does touch him then, gripping his shoulder. A droplet of water falls from his ear and onto the back of her hand.
"Uh, yeah—yeah, Jesus, thank you, that's so nice," she says, stunned. Cas stands, shoulders hunched, somehow managing to look diminutive next to a 5'2" mom and her five-year-old. He probably seems like a total weirdo to her, wearing a coat in the middle of this heat, but maybe his being with Dean and the brief respite from her child's tears makes him seem like less of an anomaly. "Justice, say thank you."
This is the kind of shit that gets his subconscious off now. Formless balls of flame, as long as they're named Castiel. Without trying to, he can still feel the sear of his kiss. He leans against the refrigerator, his forehead thunking against the cold metal.
"Even if I'm a dick?" Dean laughs bitterly. "Yeah, tried that. Didn't really work out." But Cas is different from Dean. He's old, older than Dean can comprehend, but he's still so new. He keeps learning, changing as fast as any human. He's not like Dean at all. Every time Dean changes, it's back into something familiar, something worn out and well-used. There's an inescapable persistence to Dean's past, and he knows he can't outrun it for much longer. He's only got a few days left in this body, and when they run out, so will his excuses.
"Is this your boyfriend?" Thien sounds less alarmed than Dean thinks he ought to, considering his dick is still inside him. Dean ignores him.
"All I see when I look at myself in this form is the hypocrisy, that I could call myself Jack's father, knowing the unforgivable things I might have done to him if everything had gone differently. If I had obeyed my orders, if I weren't
"Oh… shit, the name's right on the tip of my tongue, it was—the dog's name was Rosie, I remember that," Sam says.
"Angel Face, you've always been my favorite," she says, flinging off the towel, which collides with Sam's chin.
"I wonder if it may have been Jack. If his voice had the power to call me home," Castiel says. Dean tries not to remember a choked-out prayer behind a restaurant or split knuckles on a wooden sign, how he'd begged and pleaded and wept for Cas to return. The scabs have long healed over, but his hands flex against the steering wheel remembering the ache.
"No, I will not shut the fuck up, I'm going to be emotionally sincere at you, and you can just sit there and take it." Sam gives Dean a wet smile. Dean sniffs, covering his eyes.
Cas laughs a bit, a wet little cough. Dean's thumb catches a tear beginning to trail down his cheek, and Dean kisses him once, firm and definitive.
Fact is, his brother had always wanted more from life than Dean could give him, and that hurt more than he wanted to admit. Dean had been the one to drag Sam back into this life, kicking and screaming. Now Dean's finally starting to see his perspective, and here's Sam, worn down to practically nothing, saying he's done running from it, and all Dean wants is for him to run as far away as he can get. He'd give anything for Sam to throw in the towel, to say he quits, that he's giving this all up to go back to school. Or hell, anything else. Sam's smart and he works harder than anyone when he sets his mind on something. Sam should be a lawyer, or a teacher, or a goddamn alpaca farmer. He shouldn't be killing himself trying to slam the gates on Hell.
Dean thinks, and then he really is coming, throbbing and convulsing under Thien's hand, around his cock.
"Dean, it's only me," the someone says in alarm. Dean's finger stills on the trigger. Shooting wouldn't do him any good, anyway; it's Cas. Dean lets out a breath, setting the gun down on the side table heavily.
They've got a whole library full of books, but they're all about monsters and crap, so Dean keeps a milk crate in the back seat of the car and starts filling it every time they go out on a job. A used bookstore they pass by in Nebraska has the
What would Mom think of all this, if she were here? Would she even care, or would she just treat it like another bad dream she could get away from if she just took one more job?
Rowena gives Dean a sharp smirk as they pass. Sam, trailing behind her, looks at Dean like he would gladly murder him with his bare hands right there if Dean so much as blinked at him the wrong way. Dean decides not to test that hypothesis.
"Oh, you know. Babysitting. Getting babysat. Tit for tat." Dean gestures at her hair. "You, uh, you do that with a machete or something?"
"You wanna try this, Cas? I mean, I get that it's all molecules or whatever," he says, his mouth stained red with syrup, "but these've gotta be some pretty top tier molecules."
Sam doesn't stumble out of his room until it's already past noon. Charlie's been poking around their library, sorting through the catalog cards, but once Sam's there, Dean can't focus on anything but how he doesn't look any better than he did last night. He's got a cough, and dark circles, and he looks sallow and damp with sweat.
not to," Dean says. And yeah, maybe he feels a little bit like a shithead for messing things up with Sam and Amelia, but what was he supposed to do? Sam was out to
Trying on pants is an even more humiliating prospect than the bras were, somehow, which doesn't make any sense to Dean. Neither does the way the sizes work, which is apparently based solely on planetary alignments and star charts rather than any actual standardized sizing system. He straight up refuses to try on jeggings, even though he knows secondhand that they are much more comfortable and easier to fit into than regular jeans. That's not a line he's ready to cross. But most of the other offerings aren't much better, because half of them have rhinestones and shit embroidered into the ass for some reason, and the half that don't come pre-distressed, as if Dean can't tear holes into his jeans the old-fashioned way all on his own. He spent hours of his downtime as a kid patching holes in his jeans. Why would he want to spend sixty U.S. American dollars for something that's already half-ruined?
[11.1., 22:18] Castiel: I'm very glad you liked it. I actually haven't worn a corset for quite a while, never felt special enough
"I... no. We... we need to ... like decide that before we start? I ... had asked to take up what we started the other night.  I wasn't aware that the rules changed for tonight wich is fine but it leaves me hanging in the air. I wouldn't have asked if I had known it was just about me tonight."
Dean is finished with his shower and hears Cas getting into the tub. He steps out of the shower and into the bathtub.
Garth laughs. "He told me about it and I like the idea. I think he is liking this way more than he admits."
"My sex drive is higher than yours. And ... your thighs ... you under me, holding me down with them…"
"Well, both of you have been in therapy long enough to know coping mechanisms and how to communicate. If you guys could get over the fear of losing each other and actually spoke about what's bothering you, you'll be golden."
[6.12., 19:10] Castiel: He's told me there's lingerie for men so i wouldn't have to suffer in women's
"Yeah. She's a daddy's girl. But I give her another 2 minutes and then she'll leave me for the cat. She has an unhealthy obsession with him. "
Dean rests his hand on Cas' thigh after he finishes his plate and sits back to listen to the conversation around him.
"I don't understand why you chose those middle of the night classes. I thought I'm starting early and you always get in way more of a frenzy in the morning than me..." Cas says getting out of bed
"No. I am just thinking things through. I don't think I will cause working for friends and family is not good. But it's a nice dream."
"Hey Bennie. What's up. Sure by all means feel free to sit down with us." He says sarcastically but the shaking in his voice screams 'nervous'.
[11.3., 11:22] Dean: Hey Charlie. Can you send me the transcripts of today's classes? Cas is still sleeping.
Gabriel joins them for lunch but has to run out after to get something that Dean didn't catch. Cas is off to be drawing some more and Dean works through his home work.
"If you'd stay, I'd have loved to go through with it, but I know you're leaving. I'm not angry you jumped me per se, I'm just... disappointed, I guess."
"No he didn't.  Like I said. It was obvious I was horny and that's when he said that that wasn't the plan but he'll roll with it. And that just... it didn't sit right with me."
[12.1., 11:34] Dean: I could teach you.  Your car is so heavy you should be good but once you lose control of that weight its hard to get it back
[26.5., 15:49] Dean: Hey babe. Work is going interesting. I'll give you an update later. Super busy right now. 😘
Dean leans into the kiss and loses his balance. He is still sitting on the kitchen chair and with Cas on his lap his center of gravity is off. Dean and Cas topple to the floor with Cas landing on top of Dean.
[12.1., 11:32] Dean: Not only does that take away time from the books for me to work on. I now also have to drive in this weather. I hope it stops snowing soon.
Dean puts his phone down and focuses back on Castiel.  He has stopped crying and has fallen into a fitful sleep. His face is scrunched up but he is calm so Dean keeps stroking his back.
"I think so. Once my ears stop ringing I'll let you know." He grumbles. "You need a bell. It's getting ridiculous how many times you've startled me. Why do you walk so quietly?"
They finish up their food and end up chatting for a little while longer until Gabriel realizes the time and hurries home.
Dean rests his head on the back of the couch and looks at Benni. "I know. He put my tie on me yesterday. I just wanted to drop to my knees. God and his thighs. He can hold me down with his legs. "
[26.1., 20:03] Gabe: He has been by himself for a while and did well. His teachers didn't know and he fed himself and didn't burn the house down. He's a good kid. You'll be fine. Its not like you guys adopted a toddler. Few more months and he will be off to college
[24.12., 20:18] Castiel: Donna, Fabriel, Jack and Claire are super happy for us and want to "officially" meet you
Dean shrugs. "Not much we can do. It's Sunday. Nobody to call to fix up the house. Not our house to build a nest or forth."
Sam whispers. "Come on, kitty. Breakfast." And opens a can of cat food along with one of dog food. Lucifer gets up and walks right across Dean's and Castiel's faces to get to it.
Dean settles half on top of Cas ' chest. He slips one hand behind his head and holds himself up with the other. "Just because I said no tonight doesn't mean I don't want you, ok?"
Castiel gasps lightly and tries not to snap his hips into Dean who takes that sound as a good sign and applys a little more pressure.
"They're my family. I love them and when it was just me and Lucifer, I still went to see them regularly."
Dean trots trough school. Charlie looks at him very worried but he won't talk to her so she gives up.
[3.2., 15:23] Dean: She also has zero recommendations.... said we should find our own without her input but she'd gladly talk to them if we want to
"Yeah." Dean nods. He kneels back down on the floor and puts his head on Castiel's thigh. "Thank you for making a food decision. I am happy you liked it. There is more for later."
"Well, to be honest, I'm surprised I was impacted as much, I wasn't expecting as many orgasms as I had."
[6.12., 22:24] Castiel: And if you were there and we were doing that, I'd run my other hand over your thigh.
"Good... yes. Not gonna lie I was very nervous you'd ditch the conversation as soon as you see the ring box."
Dean helps him settle on his chest and looks at him encouragingly.  "Come on. Let me suck your cock."
"Forcing yourself through something for the sake of the mood is much much worse and I'd have felt like shit. I'd rather eat dinner and maybe blow you later. "
[4.12., 19:33] Dean: https://www.boldsky.com/relationship/beyond-love/2013/deal-with-over-protective-brother-034404.html
Dean is grasping at the blanket trying to stifle is moans. His cock is hanging heavy between his legs,  leaking underneath him, dribbling out more liquid everytime Cas massages over his prostate.
Dean lifts his head and carefully pulls down the Waistband of Cas panties. His cock is almost peaking out anyways.  He wraps his hand around the fabric covered shaft and sucks the naked head head into his mouth.
"It's... it's bedroom advice. I don't really want to discuss that stuff in a restaurant." Dean chuckles.
"I know." Dean whines and rolls into Castiel's shoulder to hide his face. "But I am scared. Like one day I am gonna ask for something and you'll freak out cause it reminds you of your ex and then you'll never trust me again."
Dean looks embarrassed.  "The owner owns a really old car and I helped him find parts and put them in for him."
Castiel stares at her with the widest eyes "what? You want us to what?" He looks at Dean "why did we take this to therapy? All I get from that is homework." He says with a pout he hopes is mockingly enough for Dean to understand.
Dean smiles. "I am dating your brother you sad, homophobic excuse for a human." Then he punches Michael in the face who hits the floor like a wet rag and stays down.
[31.1., 21:55] Dean: Made it home babe. Jack left already. Sam claims they spent the weekend on Netflix.  But the house is still standing so that's good.
John stops short on the other side of the street. He wanted to talk to Dean about his refusal to pay his bail and now he has to watch his son kiss a man. He is incredibly angry and about to storm over when a police car drives by and even though he is out of jail legally he ducks down behind a parked car. By the time he dares to stand back up, Dean and the guy he was kissing have left.
Gabriel watches them and shakes his head. "This dog is just like Dean... please drink your tea. Maybe even talk to me."
[2.12., 12:32] Dean: Was it tough? I can only imagine what one would go through with 3 older siblings
Dean holds Cas tightly. "But getting up is a good idea. We need fresh clothes. The babies need food and beds and your art stuff. Shit. And my school stuff." He sighs. "Fine. Let's go."
Gabriel frowns. "Hmmm. I think there needs to be some more talking between you two. That doesn't sound.... it doesn't sound fair."
After they check out and have the car packed they are on their way. It's later than Dean expected but Cas is wide awake and together they pass the hours until they are home.
[15.2., 10:19] Gabriel: Wonderful. We agreed to meet again and talk about using my honey and making mead.
"Well, yes. I have. But it works and I'm not going to buy another just because you think it's it's ugly."
The tree of them sit together till 8 pm when Dean's stomach growls audible to everyone. "Ok. Fuck this. I caught up more than I expected. Food please. Before I eat the book."
They stumble to the bedroom. Lucifer and Santana are curled up on their bed having hid up here when the house got fuller. They are both asleep. Dean snorts and goes to change and wash up.
"Yeah, I suggested we meet at the dog park in our neighborhood,  so it's not Tana's immediate territory though."
Cat and coffee taken care of he checks the fridge for breakfast. With Dean out most of the week there isn't much left but he does find some fruit in the fridge and a glass of Nutella in the pantry.
"Just for you." Dean moans and thrusts harder. "Your ass is so nice and tight. I am so hard for you, I'm leaking all over your ass. So wet."
Once on their way to Dean's place he looks over and asks "Are you staying? It would make sense if you did."
Lucifer and Santana have curled up with them, already having forgiven them for the late start to the day.
"Yeah." Dean clears his throat. " yeah that too. I can't begin to explain how happy I am that you are willing to try this with me."
"Not if it scares you to be there. But we can talk more tomorrow. Let me get an estimate and then see."
"If we hadn't told him we wouldn't need clothes."Cas unwraps from Dean and gets up. "What shall I bring you?"
They sit down for pizza and chat about some upcoming project that Benny might need help with from the both of them And Dean agrees immediately.
Dean's hips move in short aborted thrusts against Castiel. He moans when Cas kisses him like he wants to devour him.
Dean hasn't noticed Cas and is mumbling to himself. Nothing Cas could understand. He looks distressed and his forehead is wrinkled.
Cas swallows hard and slides down the door frame, he puts his face in his hands and hopes to wake up.
Cas runs his hands under Dean's shirt before he takes hold of the hem and pulls it up over Dean's head.
Cas asks Charlie if she'd be willing to come over and take a look at the commission so far and advise him.
"Hmmm. Yeah but this was more important." They turn to lay down under the window and watch the sky explode into hundreds of colors while holding hands.
Deans alarm wakes them up and after a quick and chaste shower together they head to Dean's house to drop of the pets before Dean has to go to class.
Dean tunes out a lot of what is being said but he snuggles up close to Cas.  Not too close, not knowing how the community would react.
"No. Not if you're uncomfortable.  It's.. It's the hands above me or behind my head, it's a headspace thing. I am sorry."
"It does kind of. I feel like walking on eggshells sometimes, trying to figure out what your mood is. I don't want to be pushy. How can I figure out what you are feeling up for?"
[15.12., 10:49] Castiel: But if he knows you since childhood doesn't that count as friend and didn't you say you don't work for friends?
Dean turns to Castiel. "Listen, I could have sex several times a day. Matter of fact, I have. So me being horny doesn't mean anything needs to be done about it. All I wanted tonight was a nice evening spending time together. Do this relationship right, you know?"
She looks at Cas crotch. "You know I am gonna try and see if I can see a pantie line on you for the next weeks maybe months."
When Cas wakes up he's too much in a hurry to notice the note or to bother that he woke up alone. He rushes through morning routine and pours the coffee in his travel mug before he rushes off to work.
Dean nods.  "Arthur has been cheating on his taxes and will be audited this season. It's not looking good for him. I smell jail time for him as well."
[26.5., 10:02] Castiel: I don't want to lose you either, but you're making it horribly hard for me to still love you right now. I don't know if i can trust you anymore.
"Ok. Let me bring everything out." Dean heads inside and grabs a tray. He puts his grilled cheese sandwiches and the bowl of salad on it and adds some forks just in case.
Cas kisses down along his spine and then both his cheeks. "So gorgeous." He moans then lubes his cock.
"It's not me you have to apologize to. I am used to people not liking or trusting me. It sucks and it hurts. I've worked hard on myself and I came out a better version of myself. You using my sealed file against me.... that's grounds for official complaints that could impact you, your family and Donna's job. Make it disappear to wherever you got that from, please."
Dean puts everything away and snuggles onto the couch with Castiel,  ready for another day of romantic comedies.
[12.2., 08:09] Dean: The cold does not do it any favors and I had to jump start him.  I don't think the drive to work will be enough to recharge and get him home.
[2.12., 10:09] hot stuff: Unless you are my cat, I'm sorry to disappoint, but I haven't been out last night.
[13.10., 08:50] Dean: They are doing well. Doggy is settling in nicely and plays dead when they throw the unforgivable curse at him. Lol
Cas puts more lube on his hand and lubes up his cock. He moves behind Dean and rubs his hard cock against Dean's ass.
[2.12., 21:51] Dean: That would be something I am interested in. But my goal right now is to open up my own specialty car shop for classics. The accounting is so i don't have to trust anyone else with my money
Dean nods. "Yeah. For sure. Come on babe. I want to stop at best buy and see if they have affordable cameras."
[27.12., 22:12] Castiel: I would love to see if it's as beautiful for real as it is in your pictures
Dean wakes up to Cas trying to sneak out of his arms. He grumbles. "Noo. My alarm hasn't gone off, where are you going?"
Dean goes back to the couch and checks the time. "Five, ok. That gives us some cuddle time." He says and looks up a movie on Netflix to put on.
Dean puts one candy between his teeth and turns his head to Cas who hums happily and tries to get the candy with his teeth.
They spend the next 2h going through everything Cas had been working on and he patiently explains everything and why he did it the way it is. Dean nods along and asks questions until he understands.
"You don't like the tension between him and me? It can't be helped right now.  I am sorry. I won't hold a grudge forever. "
Dean pulls out his fingers and crawls up to kiss Castiel before turning around. His hard cock hangs down in front of Cas face while Dean has Castiel's ass in front of him again.  He kisses along Cas thighs towards his cock and runs his fingers over his hole.
"Hmmmm." Dean hums.  He slowly peels of the shirt and kisses every inch of new skin that's revealed. He wiggles down the bed to get to the pajama pants and slowly pulls them off as well. " ohhh. I like that color on you." He says when something emerald green and lacey emerges the further he pulls the pants down. He throws the pants to the side of the bed and starts licking and kissing Castiels cock through the lace.
"No! Baby. No! You did not cause trouble. I told Rufus I was going to teach you stuff so we are covered there. Nobody could have expected the biggest douchebag customer I've ever met is your brother. Please, no. Don't feel bad."
"One more day and then it's finally the weekend." Dean sighs. "I want to build a nest and watch the Harry Potter movies with you please."
[4.2., 08:58] Charlie: I've seen his ass more times than I care for. Changing rooms for larping are unisex
"Not like this." Dean shakes his head. "If at any point you don't want that anymore, let me know and I won't bring it up again. I like it, yes. But I love you."
"No." Castiel leans closer to Dean. "Be a good boy, and for once, this one time, let me be your Sugar Daddy."
Cas sighs lightly and tries to finish the movie or at least the pizza, but with Dean asleep he feels just lonely doing things
Dean watches them and smiles. He didn't mean to throw them together like this but seeing them work side by side as well as they do makes his heart skip a beat.
[10.3., 13:12] Dean: Have fun. Let me know how it goes. We'll, let me know if you want to be alone or if you want to come here and do dirty car stuff
"Don't be." Dean kisses his temple.  "I liked it and now I have a reminder of you getting us off secretly."
Dean blushes deeply and moans quietly. He leans his free hand onto the couch, bending over Cas. "Yours."
[7.12., 15:33] Castiel: I have googled that garage and called them earlier, I'll be taking my car there today.
They arrive shortly after at Castiel's house. Dean unpacks quickly and changes. He waits for Cas on the couch after he feeds the dog and cat.
Castiel tilts his head and thinks. "You will not complain in the least, boy. I will come up with a punishment if you do complain though." Cas tells him, his fingers never stopping teasing Dean.
[28.1., 10:51] Donna: I was there while you were in school. I ran home to my parents before you got back for the first week
"Yes! Fuck so pretty when you come." Dean moans and watches the cum spread over the inside of the panties. "You're so messy." He mumbles to himself and licks over the head again, coaxing Cas to spurt out more cum.
Dean stands up on shaky legs and tries to hide his face while he climbs into Cas lap. Once settled he puts his head on Cas shoulder and nuzzles his neck.
"Of course us, but you're the one driving and if you weren't happy with driving it'd be bad. And I will do my best to stay awake and entertain you."
Dean comes back 15 min later in pajamas looking as clean as he did when he left in the morning. "Success. "
Dean gets up and leaves the kitchen. Cas can hear him go upstairs and fold down the latter to the attic.
"I'll try. I mean, I don't see him, so how am I supposed to talk to him? His phone is turned off too."
Dean puts on a squeaky voice. "Are you sure you know how to work with a  car in this price range? Can you shower and change into clean clothes before you sit in it? Do you have to sit in it? You give it back as clean as it is now right?"
"I tried to make contact, but you never replied to my text and i didn't try again but made my salty caramel saltier."
Castiel smirks and helps by moving himself. He slots his leg between Dean's and puts pressure on Dean's morning wood.
Dean rubs his face. "I'll see if she talks to me." He gets up and kisses Cas on his cheek. "I'll be back guys. Let me figure this out."
"What did you like?" Dean whispers in his ear. "Me submitting to whatever you wanted? Knowing we could get caught?"
Dean moans at the skin contact and wraps his leg around Cas' hip as he goes back to leaving small marks on Castiel.  This time the collar bone and chest.
"That. That one. That's my number 10. The way he says I love you. Like he really means it from the bottom of his heart."
Cas feels sad and nervous as he packs up most of his personal stuff. Zeke accompanies him to his car when he leave at lunchtime
[3.12., 10:16] Dean: I was taking my friend to the free health clinic for a regular check up. She was wearing a rainbow hat and got yelled at by one of those bigots. I tried to push past them but one guy followed us and kept yelling at her and trying to rip her hat off. Once he layer a hand on her I turned and punched him. Lights out. He went down like a wet towel.
"It's in this house.... I brought it when we watched Brokeback mountain. I left it here in the livingroom.
Dean shrugs. "I killed my own mood. I never really had a problem with ... you know.. . ..not keeping it up. It's embarrasing.
"I am. It's not what it looks like." Dean groans. "Fuck that sounds so cliché. I swear nothing happened. I know what it looked like. But it's Benni.  My brother. I asked him to come over to talk and he stayed the night. Helped me sleep. That's it. Please Gabriel! You have to believe me." Dean is frantic, tears running down his face. Dean is pacing in his livingroom waiting for Gabriel to answer him.
Dean sits on the couch miserable. Listening to Gabe making sure Cas is safe makes him feel terrible.
[28.12., 17:25] Dean: I currently have a crying Dean in my arms because he is all sorts of messed up and while I only understood half of what he told me I get the impression that something major for you 2 went down last night and then he ran into a douche today and now he thinks it's over and he messed everything up.
"Just never, ever mention to Dean that you were in our room. He's scared enough of being intimate in your house."
Dean's phone is in his backpack turned off.  The library is empty and quiet, that's why he showed up so early.  One more exam and he will know if he can graduate early or if he's stuck in college for longer.  His study group is small. Just him and this other guy from his classes. They don't talk much besides sharing page numbers and that suits Dean just fine. He wants to be done and be able to spend more time with Cas, if that means seeing him less now, then so be it. He's sure Cas will understand once he actually tells him about his plan.
Dean grabs Cas' ass and pulls him forward. He licks over the head and runs his tongue around the foreskin before he wraps his lips and sucks just on the tip.
"Hmmm. Well, let's just see what we come across. Damn, this really sucks, now that I cut down on hours and should invest in my own business I need to buy a new car."
Gabe grins. "So I couldn't help but overhear. Loverboy went to couples therapy by himself because he thought you were painting? Keep him. Marry him and have babies. If you don't I'll convert and marry him myself."
"But I'm... I'm in charge and I said ok and ... and ... why didn't you believe me? What the fuck do I have to do so you would believe me, Dean, what?"
[6.12., 14:54] Dean: Nothing less interesting then listening to several aspiring accountants argue over proceedings
"Hmmm." Dean hums. "Just ask, or tell me to suck your cock if you're in the mood for that." He licks over the fabric and makes it nice and wet so it goes almost see through. "God I love it when you're this hard. I feel so wanted when I can make you throb."
"I'll check with Charlie when she's free, so maybe Sam can choose that night to stay at Gabes. And yes, I'll dig you out."
Dean drives them back. Once at the house they change back to pajamas and take the muffins Dean made along with the cake to the couch nest. Dean lays down and looks up. "We should order your ceiling."
Ezekiel takes his plate and puts some lasagna on it. "I hope you like it. It's very simple, but we couldn't agree on what else to serve you guys."
"I miss you too. So much... I have one more big test tomorrow and that one will tell me if I can graduate early or if I need to take all the classes I dropped after all. I am sorry you feel like you're losing me, you're not. I promise you're not." Dean reaches over and grabs Cas' hand.
"Let's do it together." Cas smiles. "Hang on, where is my phone? I heard something before you brought veggies."
[6.12., 20:04] Castiel: We've only known each other for a few days and you went from straight as an arrow to buying man lingerie in such a short time
"What flag do you think is yours? Like from the little Jack has told me, you always thought you're bi or pan or something but also no need for like sex but it does seem like sex is more... uhm... common now? And I don't know, I don't know what flag to choose or if I even want or need one?"
Dean throws on a pair of Castiel's panties because he didn't bring his own and grabs Cas' coffee before crawling into the fort.
Cas feels giddy. After the talk with Ezekiel he had been rather scared of what it'd look like when he actually got to spend time with Dean again. But now he felt giddy and happy. Dean was still his, he was sure of that now.
[8.12., 10:01] Dean: How many relationships have you been in? I am assuming your body count wouldn't be higher then relationship number.
Dean looks at Sam sadly. "Yeah. Like we used to. I promise things will be better. Let's go. Tell your boyfriend you are coming over."
[4.12., 10:39] Dean: And I swear not 2nseconds later she was on top of that fucking shelf and I couldn't get to her anymore
Dean let's his hand wander. One is in Castiel's hair, the other just close enough to Cas' ass without actually grabbing him.
When Cas arrives at Dean's he feels exhausted. He grabs his bag and walks up to the front door. Dean opens the door when he hears the car arrive in front of his house. "Hey babe. Come in, it's cold outside. I made you a hot chocolate."
"Cassie, we need to head back. Food is ready and my lovely wife is mad I am ignoring her. I guess whatsapp was down? Good thing you text me like a weirdo."
"Yes. I got tomorrow off so we can see what we can get done." He serves dinner and they all sit down.
Dean grabs his blanket after changing and joins him again. This time he sits in the arm chair he had left in the studio for himself and silently keeps working on his own project.
Dean rocks back and forward on Cas fingers. Just a little. The pain is gone and it feels amazing again. Dean knows he can come from this. His cock is begging to come. Hard and heavy between his legs leaking onto the seat below him.
[22.1., 09:10] Castiel: You helped him set up our date night. I just need ideas... never mind. I'll manage
Dean looks at the bedspread and blushes. "I made you stop to check in on me... clearly it wasn't ok."
Dean makes the last finishing touches to the fruit plate and arranges the plate with the pancakes und the sirup bottles on the table. He is still unsure about where they are headed in their relation ship, especially after last night. He did enjoy himself. A lot. But there is this nagging voice in the back of his head that something wasn't right. He can't pinpoint it but he is determined to find out.
[13.12., 13:27] Dean : And on the other hand the thought of being allowed to touch you and see you in your lace turns me on like mad
Dean takes his eyes of Cas and stares at Bennie, daring him to comment on their obvious relationship status.
"She is protective.  She knows me longer then you. Your brother told me he liked me but doesn't trust me. I guess same with Charlie."
[28.1., 10:51] Donna: Gabe and me got into a big fight over that. It almost broke us. But I finally told him how I felt and we worked together.
"On what? Doesn't have to be sex all week. And maybe not naked the whole time. Pretties are mandatory."
Dean makes a face."that's gonna ruin your stomach lining." He hands him a glass of water. "Please drink this."
Cas' heart races harder than the first time he "accidentally" met Dean when he steps through the door
Dean rolls over Cas and kisses his lips before he gets up. " Lucy! Dinner." He heads to the kitchen and makes their food.
"Legally he is Dean's child. Now, are you going to let me and Sam inside to grab his stuff or do I have to arrest you for refusing to cooperate?" Donna says calmly.
Dean grins mischievously.  "I wonder how your reaction to me being flirted with by another guy would be."
Castiel paces his studio. He had accidentally created a nice, colorful painting by throwing paint tubes at the canvas. He's added some more personality to it when his tears dropped down on it and thinned the paint.
[2.1., 20:39] Gabriel: That is a hard goal you have there, sugar. I don't think you will achieve that one.
[7.1., 12:55] Dean: I figured if your sex drive isn't there you wouldn't want to be in a setting that be sexual
Dean skips putting on a shirt and just throws his vest over. He grabs the lube and his toy just in case,  hiding them,  and walks downstairs. Castiel looks towards the stairs when he hears Dean come down the stairs
"That's a lie, brother, the first missed call was at 4.20. Around the time I started cooking dinner..."
"Okay. Thank you so much for inviting us, we had fun. It was so great meeting you, Cas." Charlie hugs Dorothy to her side and smiles.
Dean huffs and let's go to undress quickly. He stands naked in the bedroom, waiting for Cas to finish up.
Castiel moans but does his best to stay still. Dean switches to the other side and works his way down. He leaves another mark on the hip bone and is on his way to make sure he didn't spill anything on Cas cock, when the doorbell rings.
Cas nods with a soft smile. "I've never told you", he says after a while, "but I had my results in the mailbox..."
"Thank you!" Dean moans out and comes across the blanket he is on. "Keep going... mark me up. Fill me!" He pants.
Dean's day at work is nice and back to normal. Someone brings in an older car and he actually gets to fiddle around and find out where the noise comes from instead of plugging in a computer to get told.
"Hey Love." Cas says softly entering the office.v"Sorry I sent Missouri but i felt helpless trapped at work, she was all I could think of to help."
Dean runs his hands over Castiel's back and into his hair. Moving his head where he wants it so he can have more space while kissing along the neck.
"Lets just keep kissing and see where we end up." Dean says and frees his hands.  He grabs onto Castiel's shoulders and wiggles himself between Cas legs.
Castiel kisses Dean's neck as his hand moves to touch Dean. He strokes slowly, soaking in the feeling.
A few minutes later his bed is straight and Dean comes inside. He walks to the studio. "Angel, I need your help please."
Cas smiles softly and kisses Dean back. They kiss unhurried and lazy, both still catching their breaths. Once Cas got fully soft and slips out Dean sighs. "No more plug please. I don't think I could do more tonight anymore."
"I think that's a good ice breaker. Shows her right away we need help." Dean laughs. "Set up an appointment and let me know?"
Cleaning up together is fast. After, they go walk Santana and cuddle on the couch once they are back home.
It takes them another hour to pick up everything,  put the paintings back, take down the balloons and put away the washed dishes.
[28.12., 18:33] Dean: He got off and you touched him. He liked that but he felt bad because he wanted to touch you too and then he felt bad for wanting it because he thinks you don't want him to
Dean grins. "Food and coffee. If you now take off your pants we got the holy trinity and I'll be helplessly enthralled to do your bidding."
Dean perks up. "Ohhh yes. Can you guys do homework in the kitchen so I can make sure you don't cheat?" He grins.
"I think you really like your nipples played with." Deans answers and bends down to suck one nipple into his mouth and scrape his teeth over the nub.
Dean turns to Cas and has him walk right into him. "Good thing I really like that guy." He grins and kisses Cas.
"No, don't feel bad. It takes pressure away from you even tho I keep telling you it's ok. I get it. I think?"
[7.1., 13:55] Castiel: Why else wiuld he have to bind me to the bed to fuck my mouth if i wasn't willing to give pleasure, huh?
"Now, let's see all those amazing things you cooked. Anything specific you want us to have tonight?"
"I want to be with you and you're up here, so I bring my meal up here too." Cas shrugs and puts everything on the bed.
Dean feeds himself a spoon. "Hmmm. It's a good thing this is a rare treat. I'd become squishy if I had that too many times a week."
Dean smiles. He chops up some berries and then sits down on the side of the bed. "I am gonna decorate you with cream and fruit and then clean up... is that OK?"
Dean grabs his stuff out of the car and walks to the door. He pulls his phone out to check the time and curses. "Fuck." He opens the door and walks inside.
Cas keeps moving but barely as he knows how sensitive Dean feels now. It takes all his willpower not to keep going.
It's Castiel that wakes up first  in the morning. He spends a few minutes watching Dean sleep before he gets up. After a quick stop in the bathroom he heads downstairs and makes coffee. Lucifer greets him  and meows at him for food.
Dean arrives at the house but Cas is nowhere to find. Dean sits down in front of the couch and plays with Lucifer.
"I want you to know that practicing your love is nothing to be ashamed of. I know that it feels awkward, but it's natural."
Dean changes into pajamas and sits on the side of the bed still deep in thought. He looks up when cas enters the bedroom and pulls him closer.  He hugs his middle and puts his head on Castiel's stomach.
"Uh, yes. Yes. I'm okay. I didn’t expect you to bring that up now." Castiel admits and leans down. "I enjoyed that very much as well."
Castiel straddles Dean's chest. His hard cock is right in front of Dean's mouth so all he has to do is stick his tongue out to lick over the head.
The rest of the evening is more relaxed and they joke around. Dean gets to hear some stories of Cas as a child from Ezekiel  and teases him with getting pictures from Gabriel as soon as possible.
Meanwhile Gabrielhas found Dean's locker and knocks on the door to the showers.  "Cassy? I have a clean overall for you here." Gabriel says standing outside the shower. The door opens slightly and Cas' hand sneaks out. Gabriel chuckles as he hands the overall over. "I'll be out here waiting."
It takes all day and many, many swear words but when the sun is setting they sit exhausted in the living room.
[15.2., 11:07] Dean: Oh. Yeah. No.  I was hoping something unfixable would break or something exceeding the worth of the car
Dean wraps him up in his arms. "I'll miss touching you too. I'd never thought I'd be such a touchy feely kinda guy but here we are. I can leave you a shirt of mine if you want."
Cas sits up in a wide lotus and breathes calmly, trying to get his erection down. At least enough to eat. Because they have to eat. They slept in, had no breakfast and had had awesome calories burning sex.
He stops and answers. "I love you too. I want you to come so bad. I want to feel you shoot your cum into the panties. I want to hear you moan. I want to suck your messy panties clean. "Dean stops and moans quietly at the thought before taking Cas back into his mouth.
"So uhm Castiel,  did you grow up super religious?  Because Jack's parents seem pretty chill about religion."
He struggles out of his panties with Cas' help and kicks them of, once they reach his legs. As soon as he's done he grabs for Cas to move back on top of him and moans loudly at the feeling of naked skin on top of himself from chest to feet.
"I'm sorry." Sam answers through his door. "Tomorrow buddy. Go to sleep it's late." He listens to Sam go to his room and grabs his phone again.
Cas opens his mouth "I love you." He whispers then pulls the cucumber piece from Dean's fingers using his teeth.
Clair thinks and then shakes her head. "No. I have a really soft blanket that's my favorite and I would take it anywhere because it makes me feel good but I don't because kids at school made fun of me."
"But it was me so now it doesn't. Trusting. He trusts me not to hurt him in any way and agreed to come to couples therapy or let me do things he may be weary of at first."
Cas moves to sit behind Dean. He wraps his legs around Dean's waist and puts his chin on his shoulder.
"He's secretly a badass. Allegedly he punched my father. Must have been awesome to see." Dean laughs.
Dean nervously watches the priest come closer and closer to them and looks at Cas and their hands and back towards the priest but the priest just walks past all the pews and returns to the altar.
"You love me for them." He answers with a smirk and gently pushes Cas hips so their cocks line up properly before he moves his hips again.
Dean grabs the plate and takes it to the kitchen. He comes back and kneels back in front of Cas. "Sir, may I take your pants off?"
Dean is in the office. Lights now on but he sits behind the desk typing numbers into the computer. He still really pale and looks drained.
Dean places something on his back and crawls over him to eat every single one. "Wanna try this? You might like it?"
"Oh yeah no worries. I am just in shock that the both of you actually did that and made sure they got what they needed without having to buy it themselves. I am in shock that you Cassie, sat through a fucking slide show. Dean what the fuck?"
They transport the couch quickly and set it up in the studio. Dean drapes himself on it and bats his eyes at Castiel.
He takes the lube and squeezes some out with one hand then he reaches behind himself and rubs circles onto his entrance.
[2.12., 20:34] Dean: What color is it. Cause I have seen one around these parts... and that one does sound like it could use some love
Cas nuzzles him lightly and closes his eyes again. Dean wakes fully to Castiel's breath blowing over his neck some time later.
"I hope you didn't mind our weekend to start this way." Cas says as they meet again at Cas' front door.
"How about part time for starters. Cut your hours at the firm to make sure you got a fix income and do art and get that off the ground?"
"You ok lovemuffin?"Garth slaps Benny's back. "And no worries Dean. Nobody at work knows anything about me either. I am not in the closet but I don't like spreading my private stuff at work."
Dean smiles and listens to Cas voice. His eyes growing heavy. "I am felling asleep. Good night Angel. " He mumbles and kisses his chest .
[15.12., 11:58] Castiel: I'm done baking. But my kitchen looks like a battle field now that I'm decorating
Dean kisses Cas."Don't get me wrong babe. I like that you like this... but this really really killed my mood." Can we just go to bed and snuggle till me ego has healed up?"
Deans runs his fingers over the little bumps of Cas' spine from the bottom to the top and back down. He flattens his hands and runs them back up to the shoulder blades.
[6.12., 13:23] Castiel: It was just a lot to go from drinking too much to drown thoughts of you to getting asked on a date.
"Once you 2 are more comfortable... with each other and sex we will revisit the last slide. Toys and kinks."
Cas comes upstairs rather shortly after Dean and goes straight for the bathroom before joining Dean naked in bed.
"Yeah, I might. It was really great meeting you, Dean, and to connect with Cas again as well. I didn't expect to have connections right from the beginning of moving here. I'm happy to have run into Cas like this." Ezekiel says.
"Morning Freckles." Cas says softly and kisses his forehead. "57. That's how far I got before you moved and I had to start over."
[2.12., 10:23] hot stuff: Why does my age matter to you, since you apparently have the wrong number anyway?
"I don't know. I've only started feeling like I want that at all since we've been a real thing, Dean. I thought I didn't want it, I also thought I couldn't have that. I don't know what I want. Just... right now I feel like we have enough teenagers in our life." He looks away feeling bad about his feelings
"Then we'll have you come, Babe." Cas says, his voice deeper and raspy just like the night on the couch.
Claire looks to where Gabe is talking to Donna just outside the kitchen and chews on her lips. "You promise not to be mad?"
Dean smiles. "Urgh I should change. I haven't come into my pants like this in a while, I forgot how yuck it feels. Let me get up?"
Cas makes groaning sleep noises clearly annoyed that Dean's trying to get away, but not awake enough to act.
[5.7., 14:14] Dean: No. We worked on my 'daddy issues' some more and she helped me feel a bit better about the situation. But she wants to see you as well.
[26.5., 09:16] Gabe: You two move so fast and it's scary to watch. You are so in love with him you don't see his flaws.
Castiel bites his lips. "It's always been like that. It's what my relationships have suffered and died from."
Dean kneels on his side of the bed and holds out his hand. "Can we go back to where we stopped in the backyard?"
"You are very sexy." Dean moans. "This is not gonna take long once I start trying to get off so I am getting all my touching and kissing in now."
Dean looks Cas up and down with a smirk and runs his hands over Castiel's shoulders and arms. "So much skin I haven't seen in weeks. May I wash you?"
Dean snorts. "I am happy as fuck right now because for a split second I panicked  that I'd trigger you. So tell me. "What do you want to do?"
Dean nods and takes his hand off his angry looking dick. It's head is dark red, almost purple and leaking visibly into the water.
Cas lets out a soft sigh and kisses him again softly. Dean chants up his hips and moans when his hard cock rubs against Cas. He can feel that Cas isn't unaffected by their making out either but he'll be damned if he brings it up.
