Course once he got used to it, he couldn’t fathom not knowing how Cass felt about him. He loved seeing the different colors flickering throughout the day, but only when Cass was nearby. Dean had quickly caught on to many of his Angel’s feelings about him, but they were confusing and frustrating at the same time. At times he knew Cass wanted him with all of his being, the bright reds, the passionate purples, the calm blues, attesting to those facts. The next, all the depressing grays and shy yellows, meant he was pushing Dean away, or walking away himself if Dean tried to start something. The fact he knew that Cass did want him, but the Angel was convinced it was wrong and refused to act on his feelings.
Cas closed his eyes and focused on breathing, the heat and the pressure was intense, the fact that it was Dean was even more. Only hours ago he thought he would never have this, never get to touch Dean like this, and had sacrificed himself to save Dean, he had gotten lucky that the Empty was willing to send him back.
Dean watched Cas as he was struggling to wrap Dean’s birthday present. Cas had it put in a box so whatever it was Dean didn’t know. Dean felt bad as Cas was struggling so he gently sat across from Cas, smiling warmly, “Want me to teach you, Angel?”
Dean didn’t answer Sam, he just carried Cas back to the Impala whispering, “Shhh shhh it's okay Angel… it's okay. I know it hurts, we are going to get you back and get you patched up”
Dean pulled Baby into the garage, and once she was in park he took a deep breath, his hand going to the pocket where Cas’ ring was, that was probably the 10th time he had checked his pocket in the last hour. After another moment, he carefully grabbed the flowers, and the jars of honey before going inside. Dean carefully put the extra jars in the cupboards before he went to find Cas. Cas was reading in the library, already dressed in his suit like Dean had asked. Dean also hid the flowers and honey behind his back. “Hey, Angel,”
Castiel whined in pain as Dean carefully scooped him into his arms, their hunt had gone completely sideways and Cas had been taken while he was out getting dinner for the three of them. Sam offered to help, knowing that carrying pretty much dead-weight wasn’t easy, “Dean do you need help?”
Cas eyes flew open at that declaration, and he closed his eyes again for just a moment before pressing his lips to Dean’s using his grace to soothe Dean’s anxiety some, “It’s going to be okay Dean… you are going to be alright… you will be with me. I won’t let anything happen to you, Honey… I promise… I love you so much, Dean…” Tears filled Cas’ eyes as he could feel Dean’s heart slowing more; it was only a few moments away.
Cas coated his fingers with lube and gently prepped Dean, using his grace to help it go faster, he was barely at his third finger before Dean was writhing with need and begging for his Alpha to just fuck him already. Cas used his grace to make sure Dean was fully prepped before gently pulling his fingers out and suddenly pushing his cock in. Dean cried out and there was a brief moment of relief before the sensation just being filled wasn’t enough. “Alpha! Please… please… pleaseee breed me… please it hurts…”
The Empty tilted its head and then slowly walked around him, its steps making no noise in the surrounding darkness. It then stopped in front of him once more, “You gave me what I wanted, your moment of happiness, but not only that Castiel, you also gave me Death, after she had betrayed me.”
Cas looked at Gabe his confusion deepening, unsure how this was relevant but answering anyways, “I am worried, something is obviously wrong with him and when I tried to heal him something is blocking me.”
Cas moved so he was comfortable than his wings, let one relax completely so it was laying more on the cool ground while he folded the other one some. Once he was comfortable he gave Dean a slight nod, “Ready Dean,”
Dean moved to sit on his bed and watched Gabriel for a moment, and he started to open his mouth but then Gabriel finally spoke, “Look Dean-O, I know you already know how this is about to go but I am going to say what I need to say anyway. I am happy despite how I feel about you that the two of you finally got together because that sexual tension has been brewing since you idiots first found out I was an archangel. However, I also know that Castiel is willing to do anything and everything for your dumbass. I plan to be sticking around, so if you fuck this up, you will answer to me. I know I screwed up in the past, but Cas is the one fledgling I have always loved, and it killed me to leave him.”
Dean grabbed the scissors first so he could cut Castiel's shirt off, wincing some at seeing how bad the cuts and few burns were, most were rather superficial but a few were deep and all of them looked harsh and painful. Dean looked at Cas cupping his cheek before gently rolling the rag and carefully nudging Cas’ mouth open and putting it in but not too deep "Bite down on this babe."
The Empty chuckled heartily, then nodded uncrossing its legs again, using the arms of the throne as leverage, and stood. Slowly walking over to Castiel, “And I did, but you gave me something even better Castiel, you gave me Death and intended to give me peace, letting me finally, finally go back to sleep, which I have every intention of doing once our conversation is over. I may not be known for showing my appreciation, but Death,” The Empty sneered Death’s name like it had left a bad taste in its mouth, “Death royally screwed me over, and honestly she is much better than your moment of happiness. So, I will ask you only one more time Castiel, do you want to go back?”
Cas turned to Dean after also taking his suit jacket off and his finger fumbling with his tie, “Whatever you want from this Dean, we can do or not do, I want to do things at your pace. I personally am not experienced in sexual intercourse with another male while possessing a male vessel… but-”
Dean closed his eyes tightly, thrusting up into Cas’ hand desperately. Dean was vaguely aware of his mouth moving but his heart pounded loudly in his ears,. “Fuck Cas, Cas fuck, Cas… I’m close don’t stop, don’t stop please…”
Before the man could reply or cause any more of a scene Dean tugged Cas out of the store, clinging tightly to Cas’ hand. Dean was quiet as they walked through the mall, Dean obviously having a location in mind but not saying anything. Dean didn’t realize he was shaking, or that he was still holding Cas hand still until Cas gently tugged on his hand changing their direction and pulling him towards a hallway that was empty, “Dean…”
Dean started to think of the room as theirs and not just his with Cas sleeping in there every night. Dean couldn’t help but admit that he thought it was adorable to see Cas attempting to sneak his things in. Finally, Cas had all of his stuff in their room, and while he was sure Dean knew by now there was one more thing Castiel wanted to talk to Dean about, he wasn’t sure how to start the conversation though.
Dean turned to him, he was sure he had just heard Cas say ‘Honeybee’ but he was confused, he raised his eyebrow questioningly as he looked at Cas “Huh?”
The doctor came in as well as a few nurses and Sam trailing behind them, “Good morning Mr. Ackles, you gave your family quite the scare. Do you think you are ready for that tube to be removed so we can talk?”
Gabe sighed but ignored Sam’s outburst and looked at Cas, “Trust me, Cassie, zap Dean-O back to the bunker. Sam and I will kill the witch but it won’t stop the spell until the heat is over.”
Dean did his best to relax, but he was freaked out and he couldn’t remember at all what happened, the last thing he clearly remembered was telling that Cas he was going to go for a walk.
Dean rolled his eyes but strokes through both the toddler’s hair. Cas looked at the toddler with hesitancy before he carefully laid his hand on Gabriel’s head, trying to reverse the witch’s spell uttering softly, “Impossible…”
Dean was slow to realize how he felt about the angel Castiel, not just because he was afraid of his little brother’s reaction or anybody else’s reaction, but because his father had instilled in him how wrong and dirty it was to be gay. Dean didn’t realize he loved Castiel, because he didn’t know that he could let himself be in love with another man, or that that was what love had felt like.
Cas chewed on his lip, before softly asking and maybe using a bit of the puppy dog eyes that rivaled Sam’s, “I would like it if we could maybe get a kitten Honeybee,”
It took a few seconds for Dean to meet Cas’ eyes, but once he did he could recognize the concern that was there, after another second Dean leaned forward and slowly kissed Cas, “I am okay Angel… I just hate ignorant assholes…”
At first, Dean had been frustrated with Castiel, because he thought it was good for them to have their own separate spaces. The more he thought about it and the more things Cas brought into the room, the more the room started to feel cozy.
Cas looked around the bunker confused and slightly concerned that was only getting worse the longer it took him to find Dean. Dean had told Cas he was going to go for a walk and then make dinner but since he couldn’t find the hunter inside he guess he was still outside. Cas decided to go out and look for Dean, it took him a few minutes and halfway up the road leading to the bunker before he found Dean. Dean was laying on the ground with a hand on his throat be he looked like he was out cold, panic flooded Cas’ chest and he ran over to Dean, he could see stings that were now very swollen all over him and Cas knew it had to be some kind of allergic reaction. In the time they had been together officially Dean had finally taught Cas how to use his cell phone and the former angel quickly pulled it out and dialed Sam. He was a few minutes down the road and as much as he wished he was, he wasn’t strong enough to carry Dean the whole way. Cas instinct was to heal him, but he had no grace anymore and that pissed him off more than anything. It took longer than Cas wanted for Sam to finally answer and the angel growled, “SAM! Is Dean allergic to bees… or maybe wasps?!”
Dean heard Sam sputter and huffed in annoyance but he could hear Gabriel pulling Gabriel out of the room slamming the door. Cas sighed gently and ran his hand over his face, “Dean…”
Dean raised his eyebrow before shaking his head, relaxing in his angel's arms, there was one thing he needed to get away from Cas in order to be able to get. Dean took a deep breath and then finally pulled away, “Do you think if I gave you the size for your trench coat you could find one yourself. I need to get something and I was planning on getting you a gift… You have your phone so you can call me when you find it and I will bring you the card?”
Dean shook his head, "Yes sir, your queen Megara. You married her when Knight Micheal challenged your place over the Empire because you had no heir and no chance at an heir. Megara was your best friend and she suggested it. I am your consort. I please you when you need pleasing, you rarely lay down with the Queen. I don't really remember falling asleep in here though... I don't normally because Michael can catch us and your crown will be threatened."
Cas kissed Dean’s head again, “Come on Honeybee, let's get a shower and then we can get some sleep.”
Cas looked slightly dazed with the information given to him before he nodded and he grabbed Dean’s shoulder and flew them back to Dean’s room in the bunker.
Gabriel gave Cas an epic bitch face for a two year old and then started crying. Cas attempted to reason with the now screaming toddler, of course Sam getting upset that Gabriel was angry so Dean broke in and took the fry from Cas and gave it back to Gabe who still cried and softly spoke, “Trust me angel, either he learns, or he gets it stuck up there, and he can deal with that when he goes back to his normal self.”
Cas hesitated, he didn’t know much about anal sex but he didn’t think Dean had been stretched enough to not cause any discomfort, “Are you sure Dean?”
Cas gently pulled out Dean’s computer from his drawer and started to look for something to watch on Netflix. Cas used his grace to make his headphones appear in his hand and plugged them in so he wouldn’t wake Dean up. Cas watched a few episodes of the newer version of Hawaii Five-O before he could just barely sense Dean drifting into a more conscious state. Cas smiled and put the computer away, then stroked his fingers through Dean’s hair, helping him sleep just a little longer, it was almost 6 am, and Dean would probably be awake soon.
After a few minutes, Dean came back in with a thin sheet he had soaked in cold water and then rung out so it was not wet but was still cold. Dean carefully laid the thin sheet over Cas’ wings and at first, Cas flinched but then he relaxed some. Dean put the other cold rag on his forehead before crawling into the bed next to Cas, “How’s that angel?”
Without missing a beat, Dean turned towards the man and replied his voice filled with anger, “Been there, done that, bought the damn t-shirt.”
Castiel personally healed Dean’s soul, pulled it back together and rebuilt the human’s body. Castiel admired Dean’s soul because even though the man had tortured souls in Hell, it was the purest soul Castiel had ever seen. When Castiel rebuilt his body, he definitely appreciated the human’s physique. Castiel had been particularly enamored by Dean Winchester’s freckles, not that he really understood what he had felt back then.
Cas had asked Sam two days ago to text him or call him when they were going to be close, and he knew they should be home within ten minutes. The pie was done, so he turned off the oven but put their food in the oven to keep it warm.
“I found Dean by the side of the road, he is barely breathing and covered in some sort of stings… I don’t know by what… Sam, we have to get him to the hospital” Cas replied the anger falling out of his voice and pure panic falling in.
Dean rolled his eyes some, “Wings or not you are always going to be my angel Cas. It’s a pet name, you know endearing terms like babe or Honey.”
Cas hadn't planned on moving all his things into Dean's room without his human's knowledge, at least not initially, until after moving one thing, it became a game for Castiel to play.
It is the morning of their wedding day, Gabriel lectures Dean, and Sam has a heartfelt conversation with Cas.
The girl chuckled and nodded, “My girlfriend says I am the same way,” She takes the card from Dean, sliding it before handing it back to Dean. After carefully wrapping the flowers and grabbing a few floral food packets she gives Dean the flowers, “Okay here ya go! I would wish you luck, but you seem pretty confident, so I will say congrats.”
One week later, Cas finally found his grace after nearly killing Metatron because the stupid angel teased him and lead him on a wild goose chase before finally giving up where he head Castiel’s grace in an abandoned library in one of his favorite books. Cas stared at the glowing vial of grace, he could feel the grace inside him resonating, emitting a high-pitched noise only he could hear with the grace in the vial. Finally, he opened the vial, tipping it into his mouth and closing his eyes at the familiar feeling of his grace feeling every single molecule of his vessel, his wings stretched and flexed finally feeling whole.
Dean looked over at Cas from the couch but was up the moment he heard Cas speak. Dean was by his side almost instantly and stroked Cas cheek, “Hey there handsome, how ya feeling.” Cas groaned gently and mostly out of habit he tried to sit up but it pulled painfull on the stitches making him squeak, actually squeak in pain. Dean stopped him and caressed his cheek, “Easy Cas, we don’t want you ripping out your stitches okay?”
Dean looked at Sam who nodded some before tossing him the pill bottle, then a bottle of water. Dean caught both easily and gently helping Cas take the pills and sip the water. “Now these are probably going to make your head feel weird and make you tired okay so just relax.”
Cas shook his head vehemently and used his grace to hide his wings, he hated them, desperately hated them. So many angels had shunned him simply because of the black color, and then they had gotten burned carrying Dean out of Hell, “They are hideous Dean…”
Dean shivered and groaned in pleasure, the idea alone bringing him closer to his orgasm, he forced himself to take a deep breath and met Cas eyes, “Okay Angel, I swear to fucking Christ himself if you do not fuck me or do something soon I will do it myself,”
Cas shook his head some, “Not yet… he needs a few minutes, then I will go talk to him. First, though, I wanted to check on you Sam, how are you doing”
Dean pulled Cas by his tie, smashing their lips together and kissing the angel with a fervent need. They could only have a few more days together, he had no idea what Chuck was planning but one thing he had dreamt about for years was having Cas fuck him.
Dean relaxed and then nodded some, “Yeah, but I didn’t want roses; they are a little too cliché for me.”
Cas smiled a little, resting his forehead against Dean’s and he was about to say something when Chaos jumped up onto the table, the cat was full-grown now, his tail swayed gently as he rubbed against Dean’s shoulder and purred. Gabriel had used his grace to make the cat immortal because it was effortless to do with pets but very hard to do on humans. Mostly because human souls were not exactly meant for immortality. Chaos continued to rub against Dean’s shoulder and arm begging for attention, Dean quickly gave the cat the attention it wanted. “Well good morning Chaos, where have you been?”
Cas raised his eyebrow in confusion but nodded hesitantly and warned Dean knowing Gabriel was protective over him. After giving Chaos a small stroke Gabriel left, leaving Castiel alone with Sam.
Dean carefully pulled off Cas shirt studying his body for a moment before leaning forward and kissing the angel slowly. Cas looked up at Dean and returned his kiss but he was feeling overwhelmingly insecure, his body had once been in pristine condition, James Novak had been an avid runner, before Castiel had never really cared about his appearance, but after weeks of being in a relationship with Dean, and not having intercourse, Cas was starting to wonder if maybe Dean no longer found him attractive. They had done other things but had still yet to go all way. Dean noticed the demeanor change in his boyfriend’s body language and cupped Cas’ cheek and studied Cas’ face softly, “What’s wrong Cas?”
Sam was shaking some, his pain radiating off of him before he finally started to turn away from the pyre. Not being able to stomach the sight or the smell right now, Sam nodded gently to Cas, his eyes lingering on his brother who barely noticed his brother leaving before he made his way through the field and back to the bunker. Cas nodded in return then gently moved closer to Dean, softly speaking, “Honeybee…”
Dean watched Cas as he watched Sam and Gabriel making a mess as they ate, and silently thought it was hilarious. Cas looked disgusted, confused, and also really concerned. When Gabriel attempted to shove a French fry up his nose, Cas quickly stopped the fledgling and said sternly, “Gabriel that is disgusting. Why would you attempt to shove food up to your nasal canal.”
Dean then smirked and unwrapped the towel, letting it fall to the ground, before kissing just below Cas ear and whispering, “Gone for the weekend. We have the whole bunker to ourselves, angel.”
Sam smirked and grabbed his coffee before leaving the kitchen to go sit in the library and shouting over his shoulder, “Finally!”
Cas looked at Dean confused for a moment, but he said nothing, the waiter nodded some, “Okay, do you know what you gentlemen want to eat, or do you need another minute?”
Dean shrugged gently, “I don’t know… I guess he always thought I was bisexual, and he was so homophobic he would do anything and say anything to make sure I repressed that part of me.”
Dean swallowed around the lump in his throat before putting a decent glob of lube in his hand, then putting the lube aside. Dean slowly rubbed his cock with one hand, taking some of the lube on his fingers of his other hand spread his legs, slowly rubbing around his hole. Dean closed his eyes tightly, groaning softly in pleasure canting his hips up gently, it had been too long since he had done this.
Gabe touched Cas’ forehead again, making his younger brother sleep before looking at Dean, “His wings are molting… and since he is a vessel it is even worse… For us, molting happens all at once, and after the feathers are gone, they grow all in a matter of… well on Earth it’ll be about 48 hours. I need to make his wings manifest in this plane, part of the reason he is this sick is because they aren’t in the same plane.”
They had both wanted this for years, despite neither of them acknowledging it to the other and now they were finally here. Dean slowly met Cas’ eyes and nodded, “I’m okay Cas,”
Cas looked up and blushed some before nodding, “I like the color of these jeans better than than the lighter ones you gave me.”
Dean groaned, “Damn it, so we have to deal with him using his powers and being a toddler, this is going to be hell,”
Dean wanted to be excited about the pie, and the bacon cheeseburger in front of him but his stomach was twisting painfully making him very much not hungry. Cas gently stroked Dean’s arm, he knew Dean had barely eaten yesterday and he needed to eat, “Dean… at least eat dinner please…”
Cas walked slowly over to the bed, keeping a firm hold on Dean before carefully laying the man down on his back and positioning himself over Dean.
When Castiel won again, Dean got up and stalked off, to annoyed to say anything to his angel. After Dean had been sitting in his room a few minutes by himself trying to work out his frustrations without taking them out on his angel, Cas gently knocked on the door before stepping in, “I am sorry Dean…”
Dean looked at Cas who looked overwhelmingly worried still and nodded, “Thank you Doc… how soon can I leave?”
Halfway through cooking, Cas was too painfully hard to care anymore, and he slotted himself behind Dean, kissing along his hunter’s neck gently. For a minute Dean tried to ignore his angel, but then the asshole dipped his finger into the slightly melted chocolate meant for dessert and smeared it on Dean’s neck, then worked on licking it all off, making Dean groan in pleasure.
Dean came in as Sam had said ghoul and made a humming noise, “Good, I get to shoot things in the head. So where at?”
Just Sam was about to call for Dean, Cas came in stretching his arms out and rolling his shoulders gently. Sam smiled, “Hey Cas,”
Castiel’s voice had gone from soothing and calm to harder and dangerous, as if he was challenging Dean, and it made something knot in Dean’s chest, but he forced himself not to jump to conclusions. “Okay, Angel,”
Cas came into their bedroom and saw the book Dean was holding, out of curiosity he walked over and looked over Dean’s shoulder to see an gorgeous sketch of Dean’s mother. “That is beautiful Dean, did you draw that?”
Dean chuckled and the two were soon naked and teasing the other and trying to get the other to orgasm first. Cas cheated and manipulated Dean with his Grace, making the hunter cum first.
Dean wanted to laugh at hearing Cas cuss because he knew the angel rarely did but he also knew his angel was in pain. Dean kissed his head gently, “I am going to get you a cold rag for your neck okay angel?”
Falling in Love with Castiel was easy, simple, it happened so quickly and easily Dean had barely realized it had happened. It actually happened only weeks after the angel had pulled him from Hell, and Dean was too far in the closet to realize it. Now that Dean knew though, he sometimes wished he could go back, and just smack himself so that he would open his eyes to his feelings. Now, having Cas by his side even though their relationship may have only started while Cas was human it was now the best thing he had ever experienced.
Cas groaned gently, he slowly forced his eyes open and he knew something was wrong, he didn’t know why he felt so awful, and his wings hurt more than they ever had before and he let out a soft whimper of pain as he tried to adjust his wings in the other plane.
Cas frowned gently and looked away from Dean, after a moment he whispered, “I am sorry Dean… you… you just looked so wonderful… and… I thought you had heard me”
Once they made it to the room Dean’s eyes lit up at the pictures on the wall and explained to Cas who the cowboys were with excitement. Cas just listened to him and asked questions here and there before Dean went towards where the beds were to put his things away. Gabe looked at Cas, “He… uh… likes cowboys huh?”
Dean smiled some and nodded softly, “Trust me, angel, I did. Come on before we are late for our reservation.”
Castiel loved Dean, but his feelings for Dean Winchester were so much more than the word Love could really fully explain. Love was such a simple word, but the way Castiel felt for his human, it was so much further from simple. The English language just did not have the right words to really encompass how Castiel felt for Dean. There was a word in Enochian that explained how he felt, but of course, the English language just didn’t have the right word so the translation was completely impossible.
Castiel was quiet for a long moment still, staring into the Empty’s blank expression, struggling to process what was going on in this moment, before the words came out effortlessly. It was his constant defense, words that often replayed in his mind like a mantra in constant repeat. “I needed to protect Dean.”
Sam nodded, “Yeah, looks like it may be ghoul or zombies. Or technically it could just be grave robberies…”
Dean hummed in response and refused to let go of Cas’ hand as they walked towards his room, Dean’s free hand roaming Castiel’s body as they walked and then pushing the angel against the door to his room, kissing him desperately again. Dean had nearly lost the angel, Dean hadn’t even had a chance to ask the angel how he was alive but he wasn’t even sure he really cared. Cas was there, and that was what mattered right now at this moment.
Cas hand found its way to the handprint on Dean’s shoulder, after all these years it was still there, not that Cas expected it to be gone considering a piece of his grace was there. Cas could just barely feel the grace left inside him resonating with the piece in Dean’s scar, Dean gasped in pleasure when Cas applied enough pressure to it. Cas smirked before he had enough of Dean’s teasing and flipped them over so he was now on top, and Dean let him. Dean had always taken the lead, pushed things at his own pace but right now, Cas wanted the control. Cas lips found Dean’s for a just a moment before the trailed to the brand on Dean’s skin, the mark that told any other angels who this human belonged to, he hadn’t meant to do it but now he was supremely glad he had. Cas missed being able to see Dean's soul, it had been and would always be his favorite because he believed it to be the most beautiful soul his father had ever created. When Cas just barely nipped at the bottom of the handprint Dean moaned lewdly and closed his eyes tightly whimpering, “Fuck Cas”
Cas chuckled lowly, the gently rumbling going straight to Dean’s dick, making it jerk and twitch with need. Finally, after another minute of teasing he gave into Dean’s request, like he always would and expertly gave Dean a blowjob, because as they had discovered last week, Cas had no gag-reflex and man if that didn’t make things all the more amazing. Cas gently played with Dean’s hole as well, they hadn’t done that before but it had Dean cumming harder than he ever had and he was excited for more.
6 hours later Cas woke up, Cas groaned gently, wincing at the same time from the pain as he was pulled into awareness. “Ow…” Cas muttered softly.
Dean groaned again and scrubbed his hand over his face, “Well, we can be prepared, and we will kill her when she comes to kill them.”
Dean closed his eyes and leaned into Cas once more, then the realization that they hadn’t eaten crossed through his mind and he groaned deeply, “Shit, we didn’t stop for food… I don’t want to cook…”
Cas was sitting in the library talking to Gabriel, Dean came in just as Cas started to talk, “I understand your feelings for Sam brother, but he was very hurt by your death, and he failed in his attempt to move on. You will just need to give him time, he is doing better now than he first was.”
The waiter looked down at the ring and smiled some, “Of course, I will ask you to hold onto it until then, I wouldn’t want to lose it,”
Cas was still quiet before finally pulling his hand away and the glow faded as he looked at Dean, “I was using my grace to clean the mattress thoroughly,”
Dean smiled warmly, then pulled Cas closer to him, pressing his lips to the angel’s then sighed into it, and forcing himself to pull away because otherwise, they wouldn’t accomplish anything. Dean watched Cas hesitate for a moment, clearly wanting more before he closed his eyes and within seconds the majority of the mess disappeared, even the pan that was soaking in the sink was clean again and Cas had used his grace to put it away. Dean smiled and then shook his head and started cleaning the shelves and they completely cleaned the kitchen with Cas’ help.
Cas watched Dean for a moment, he was starting to look slightly pale, and he was so nervous he was starting to fidget. Cas gently reached out and carefully took Dean’s hand, hoping to ease his nerves.
Cas closed his eyes then shakily spoke. "I... I need to get back to Dean... he is probably freaking out..."
Cas smiled warmly at Dean’s anxious babbling before leaning forward and pressing his lips to Dean’s not entirely pulling apart as he whispered, “Dean, as I just said, anything you want. Really,”
Dean smiled more in his sleep, as his dreams were nice and pleasant. Cas closed his eyes, since getting his grace back Cas could barely stop thinking about how Dean had touched his wings and the look on his face. The touch had sent jolts of pleasure through his grace and his body, but the touch had also terrified him. No one had touched his wings since Hell. It had been hard enough for him to find help grooming them before because of their dark color. Balthazar had helped him after Gabriel left Heaven before then Gabriel had always down it. Cas closed his eyes remembering how Gabriel would tell Cas how much he loved Cas wings, how beautiful they were. Not to mention Gabriel had told him that they were his favorite set of wings, despite the hate the other angels had given him.
Cas shook his head softly, leaning his head against Dean’s some of the tension in his body released, “I feel like everything I have done so far has been wrong… Gabriel seems to hate me and… Sam… I don’t know what to Dean. My first instinct is to make them sleep and not interact with them… but I… I know that is not what you wish to do… I feel lost… but… I am trying to do well and show you I can handle children but…”
Within 10 minutes Dean finally figured out where they were and how to get them back home, they were only 20 minutes from the bunker but on a back-road Dean had never taken before.
Cas nodded some then watched Dean as he ran his fingers gently, barely a feather’s touch along the longest scar that went diagonal across his chest. It was from the dragon, they had removed the stitches 2 weeks ago and the scar was still raised and red and very sensitive. Cas shivered gently at the feeling and his stomach fluttered gently. Dean lowered himself further so he was looking at Cas’ chest now, Dean gently leaned forward and softly licked and kissed along Cas scar. When Dean looked up Cas was doing his best not to move and groaning gently a bit overwhelmed at the new attention to his over-sensitive scar. Dean smiled and his hand trailed down Cas’ happy trail teasingly slow before he gently unbuttoned Cas’ jeans that weren’t his jeans. Cas watched Dean with needy anticipation rising in his chest. Dean slid Cas pants down part of the way along with his underwear before gently rubbing along Cas’ half-hard cock that was quickly becoming fully hard with the attention. Dean was kissing and nipping, and licking at Cas’ scars as well as rubbing his cock. It didn’t take long before the angel was starting to writhe in pleasure and Dean knew his angel was getting close. Dean being the tease he was slowed down and then stopped as he pulled Cas’ pants off.
Dean huffed and rolled his eyes in annoyance before looking at the map again trying to figure out where the hell they were, just then there was a loud crack of thunder. When Dean looked out the window, the light sprinkling was now a full downpour of heavy rain. Dean sighed, he hated the rain, then he looked at Cas a glare still on his face before shaking his head and replying. “You should have said something Cas, I could have pulled over and figured it out then, I have no fucking idea where we are even at right now.”
Cas closed his eyes leaning into Dean’s touch, Dean could see that the angel was close to breaking down into tears again and his voice broke, “Why do you love me, Dean?”
Gabe finally cleared his throat loudly, making the two pull apart reluctantly but they kept their hands together. “Remember, no matter what you cannot let go, it’ll break the ritual and can cause some damage,” After both Dean and Castiel nodded Gabriel began the ritual. It was halfway through when Dean could feel the handprint on his arm where he knew there was a tiny piece of Cas’ grace was, had started to burn slightly. When Dean glanced at the mark, Dean could see that it was glowing underneath his clothing, but he quickly returned his eyes to Cas, and then Dean realized Cas; eyes were glowing blue like when he was about to smite something or to use a lot of grace. The pain started to become nearly unbearable, but Cas held tightly to Dean’s hands to keep them from breaking the spell. Suddenly the pain built so much, but in that same instant, it was gone. The next sensation Dean could feel was Cas’ lips against his, and it felt like Cas’ grace wrapped around him, a coolness spread over him and he realized that Cas was trying to absorb most of whatever pain he was just in and had just happened, and Dean relaxed more into Cas’ strong arms.
Dean pulled away to stare into Cas’ brilliantly blue eyes for barely a moment, and then without warning pressed their lips together. The feeling of Cas’ lips against his own was overwhelming, his chest going tight but he didn’t care. Cas was there, in front of him, and he was alive, the angel he had loved for so long was alive.
Cas leaned forward so he was hovering over Dean, his fingers still rubbing Dean’s hole, Cas pressed their lips together before pressing a finger in slowly. Dean gasped out and moaned gently, there was no pain, Dean knew Cas had to be using his grace but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. Dean arched into Cas as the angel moving faster, pushing his finger in and out of Dean’s hole.
Cas sniffled before chuckling softly, "Dean might try to kill you but... I know Sam misses you even if he doesn't say it..."
Cas wasn’t full-on dancing to be fair, and he was swaying his hips to the music he was listening to, not that Dean could hear because he had headphones in. Dean smiled at Cas when he had turned to grab something. Cas jumped when he saw Dean, gasping loudly and quickly pulling his headphones out, silently guessing that this must have been how Dean and Sam felt when he would appear behind them. “D… Dean… I thought you were… uh going to do shopping…”
Cas sighed gently, before sitting next to Dean as he closed the sketchbook and set it aside, then intertwined their fingers. “Dean… your father was a man that grew up in a period that being gay was wrong and sinful, and people were lynched and murdered for it. I am not saying that excuses him taking it out on you, but it was also his upbringing. You couldn’t help the way you were born; I know it is hard for you to accept it sometimes but there is nothing wrong with it, or our relationship”
Cas woke a few hours later, his wings felt like they were on fire, similar to when he had pulled Dean from Hell and instinctually tried to tuck his wings in close to him to protect them but the sudden movement caused even more pain and he cried out.
Gabriel was quiet for a long moment then broke into a broad smile as he found Dean’s response good enough and nodded, “Okay Dean-O, well Sammoose made you breakfast,” Gabe snapped his fingers, and there was food on his desk. “And the ritual is in three hours so hurry your ass up, eat, and get dressed.”
Dean blushed again; the words were somewhat overwhelming, but he kissed Cas slowly. Then he grabbed the sketchbook from Cas as an idea came into his head, he hesitantly asked, “Can I draw you an angel?”
Cas did as Sam asked and by the time he was getting Dean’s shirt looser, Sam was pulling up, Sam helped Cas get Dean into the back of the Impala. Cas sat in the back with Dean’s head in his lap making sure Dean’s airway was open and rubbing his hand gently over Dean’s chest. “Shhh, it’s going to be okay Honey… it’s going to be okay”
Dean quickly turned dinner off, and they started to take turns putting food on each other and then eating it, or licking it off each other. Finally, it was too much teasing for both of them, and Cas finally bent Dean over the counter and fucked him mercilessly. They laid there in bliss for a few minutes before they made their way back to Dean’s room for one more round, and then Dean finally passed out, with Cas spooned behind him. The angel listened to his human breathing and was gently stroking Dean’s side, he may have been an angel, but he was exhausted as well, and soon even Castiel fell into his exhaustion and was fast asleep.
Today was Dean’s 72nd birthday, and Dean had lived much longer then he had ever expected himself to. Dean groaned gently as he started to stretch out, his bones cracking and popping with his old age. Dean blearily opened his eyes, Cas was settled in his arms like every morning, but he carefully reached around his angel to get his glasses. Dean’s vision had grown weaker, and Sam had insisted he got glasses, when he nearly got into an accident in Baby because he hadn’t been able to see how close the car in front of him was, Dean finally agreed. Dean met Castiel’s warm gaze and smiled, “Morning Angel,”
Dean groaned gently but internally he was desperate to finally have a real reason to look for Sam and Gabriel. “Yeah alright, let’s go look for them, Can you sense Gabriel’s grace?”
Sam gave Dean a major bitchface before huffing his response, “Uploading some of the Men of Lett’s information Jerk. Charlie… she kept complaining about our system being outdated and before… she helped me get it started… I haven’t wanted to do it after but… I decided to try and get it done…”
The dragon had grabbed him and taken him to the sewers, torturing him and collecting his blood even if Cas’ didn’t know why. Cas had deep cuts to his chest and wrists, not to mention a few burns from the dragon as well. The former angel was in and out of consciousness on their way back to the motel.
Dean’s wonton voice spurred the angel on more and he moved faster, he could feel himself reaching his climax as well.
Dean frowned gently studying Cas face, he could see the genuine concern and seriousness on his lover’s face, quickly shaking his head and promised, “Of course I do Cas, why would you think that I do don’t”
Cas couldn’t help but wonder if this was a dream, Dean was undressing him, they were about to have sexual intercourse. Dean wanted to have sex with him, Dean loved him. It felt too good to be true, especially considering barely half an hour ago he had died and said goodbye finally told Dean the truth, and then sacrificed himself.
Dean rolled his eyes under his hand but was still refusing to uncover his eyes, “Something is wrong with Cas… I… he says his whole body hurts, especially his wings and… he is covered in sweat…”
As much as the idea was terrific, he slowly shook his head, one thing Dean would refuse to bring up to the angel, was how he had once killed a Nephilim for the spell that would ultimately cause the angels to fall. “That… it would be hunted Cas… I mean… you said they are considered abominations…”
Cas started to pull away, not wanting to have this conversation but Dean stopped him, and the look in Dean’s eyes quickly broke his resolve of not talking about it and finally nodded hesitantly. Cas gently stretched out his wings looking over his shoulder at them. “Most angels have brightly colored feathers, Lucifer, his wings were the purest white I had ever seen, Micheal’s were white too, but they were iridescent, like opal. Gabriel, his wings were golden, honestly, they looked like pure gold. Raphael's wings were as blue as the sky,” Cas took a shaky deep breath, “Almost all angels have brightly colored feathers and… those who don’t are believed to be more likely to rebel. Anna’s were a darker brown shade, they… they were like an owl, Uriel… his wings were a navy blue. Mine… well, mine are black. No angel would touch my wings, as if my taint would rub off on them… Gabriel… Gabriel though… he would groom them, constantly told me how beautiful they were and… told me to ignore what anyone else said. I was just a fledgling when Gabriel left, but after that Balthazar helped me… When I rescued you from Hell, my feathers were darkened even more by Hellfire and soot…”
Suddenly the burst of energy was overwhelming and he collapsed to one knee, holding his chest as he gasped for breath, it had been months without his grace, it took him a moment to find the balance of his grace and his vessel. Dean ran over and kneeled in front of Cas, cupping his cheek making the angel look at him, “Cas! Cas angel are you okay?”
Dean chuckled and then kissed along Cas’ neck whispering, “So Angel, should I take this towel off and get on my knees for you.”
Cas took a moment to process what his hunter had just said before finally nodding tiredly, “T…that sounds like a good idea… Everything hurts…”
Dean was pulled from sleep by the sounds of Cas groaning and whimpering in pain, Dean rubbed his eyes sleepily before he slowly looked at Cas who was covered in sweat and curled up with his back towards Dean. Dean tried to rub Cas’ back but Cas cried out in pain and tried to pull away from Dean’s touch. Panic suddenly lanced through Dean and he got up and moved so he was facing Cas, “Cas… Angel what’s wrong”
Dean gasped at the sudden cold air on his legs before suddenly Cas was picking him, Dean instinctively wrapped his legs around the angel but somehow their lips stayed together.
Dean smiled some and chuckled softly, “Well lucky for you, and I single-handedly raised Sammy here by myself, basically anyways, so I think we will be alright Angel,”
Dean finally pulled away, his chest rising and falling harshly as he tried to catch his breath, his arms wrapped around the angel’s neck. Dean let his forehead fall against’ Cas and closed his eyes.
Dean was positive he didn’t deserve a guy, a former angel of the lord, like Castiel. Between the things he had to do to keep Sam fed sometimes, then Hell, he didn’t deserve Castiel. Of course, Castiel being the ever rebellious angel he really was, didn’t care what Dean thought he deserved and loved him anyway, the former angel had told Dean how he felt when they were fighting their way out of Purgatory. How he loved Dean and he had left Dean because he couldn’t stand the idea of Dean getting hurt because of him. Things after Purgatory were unimaginably fucked up though and sometimes Dean was almost positive he imagined Cas telling him he loved him.
Cas and Dean were perfectly content to lay in bed for another hour before Dean’s stomach growled with hunger and his bladder was full. He was comfortable and wasn’t ready to move way from his angel but after trying to lay there for another minute it was no longer comfortable forcing him to get up.
Dean smiled with excitement bubbling in his chest and he quickly got up to get the pencils he had found with the sketchbook. He was nervous at the idea of drawing Cas but also really excited. Once he found the pencils he moved the chair by his desk so he could sit there, but Cas gently stopped him, “Wouldn’t it be more comfortable for you to sit on the bed, I can sit in that chair for hours with no trouble, but you are human Dean.”
Dean frowned but carefully picked Cas up, and even though Cas is out cold he still flinched at Dean touching his back. Dean took him to their bed and laid him gently on his stomach as he softly asked, “Why hasn’t this happened before? I mean I have known him for 8 years now and he has never been through this.”
Dean smiled before he worked the buttons of Cas’ button-up undone, slowly revealing inch by inch the angel’s slightly-toned pale skin. Cas looked down and watched Dean as he did so, the hunter’s hands weren’t shaking like Cas’ were.
Cas moaned into Dean before pulling away, focusing on thrusting his hips and focusing on their connection, it was everything Cas had ever dreamed of.
Cas eyes went wide with excitement, his other conversation briefly forgotten, and he nodded vigorously, “Yes! Yes, of course, Dean!!” Cas then excitedly pressed his lips to Dean’s, and the smile on his angel’s face was worth it.
Castiel felt relief bloom in his chest, even though he was nervous to think about how Dean would react to him after Castiel had told the man the truth, he needed to be there for Dean. “I understand, thank you…”
Cas frowned gently, he could see the shame on Dean’s face and didn’t understand it, “Dean, that was a beautiful drawing, May I see more please…?”
Sam looked at Gabriel and then nodded, “Okay Bean, we be nice to Cassie, if he shows us his wings. Peasee”
Cas smiled some before carefully toeing his shoes off before climbing into bed with Dean. Dean wrapped his arm without the IV in it around Cas and closed his eyes, it was barely a few minutes later before Dean was starting to fall asleep again. Cas sighed gently before closing eyes and soon followed Dean into a dreamless slumber.
So now, if you asked Castiel, Angel of the Lord, what being in love felt like now that he had Dean Winchester, he would tell you that being in love, was being devoted to someone. Castiel was, completely and utterly devoted to Dean Winchester, and nothing could or would ever change that.
Dean had finally told Cas about selling himself so he could feed Sammy a few weeks ago, not long after Dean had gotten out of the hospital. Being dominated by Cas was making his heart-race but not in a way it had before, he felt safe underneath Cas, he knew the former angel wouldn’t hurt him. Dean wanted to ask Cas for more but it seemed the former angel had other things on his mind, as he went back to paying attention to the scar he had left on Dean’s shoulder. Cas’ voice was deeper then Dean had ever heard it and it made his cock twitch in anticipation. “I never told you Dean, but when I left my mark on you, it is more than just this brand on your soul, I left you with a piece of my grace. It’s tiny, barely noticeable unless an angel who is close to me. I can feel it, just barely resonating with the grace left inside me. Imagine Dean, if I had all of my grace, how this direct, skin-to-skin contact would feel.”
Dean cupped his cheek, looking Cas' eyes before nodding gently, "Okay my king, I should go, as much as I loved staying with you I should not have stayed with you, Knight Michael would not like that I was here and not your Queen,"
Dean looked over the menu quickly before replying, “I will take the surf’ n’ turf, and he will have the lobster mac and cheese,”
Cas smiled lovingly because he loved to see the sort of joy and genuine excitement on Dean’s face. “It’s good Honeybee”
So this is a super short one, mostly to make up for the fact that the next one is going to be pretty long. I hope you guys enjoy though!
Cas explained in a gentle tone, “Dean and I were playing Chess, and I kept winning, so he decided he wanted to play a different game, and I have won that, so Dean is upset,”
They were naked, Cas was supporting most of Dean’s weight without issue, one hand holding Dean by his ass and the other around Dean’s back. Dean’s eyes were closed but Cas didn’t need to see the man’s eyes to know they were full of tears, he could feel the emotion pulsing off him.
Dean blushed deeply before looking away, “Thank you Cas, you… you can keep it if you want. Hell, you can keep the whole book… I don’t…”
Dean smiled before pulling Cas down with him as he laid down again, the two of them decided to just lay in bed the rest of the day.
Dean shook his head, he hated how much the former angel doubted himself and gently made Cas look at him, “I love it, angel.”
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean again but stood up, before helping Dean stand, using his grace to soothe the pain from Dean’s arthritis gently. The angel had tried to heal Dean’s eyes, but it hadn’t worked, it was just a part of the inevitability of growing old. Dean glared at Cas for just a minute when the pain in his joints eased, Cas’ grace had become much weaker from the extended time out of Heaven, but Cas still used it to help Dean and sometimes Dean wished he wouldn’t.
Sam sighed heavily before shaking his head some, “I don’t know Cas… I mean Charlie was practically our little sister, sometimes it… it feels like we can’t have anything good…”
Dean raised his eyebrow as he watched Cas act squirrely, then he moved in to kiss Cas. Dean took advantage of the angel’s lapse in attention from the kiss, to take his phone. Cas yelped, realizing what his hunter had done and tried to take his phone back, but Dean quickly ran off to the library and opened Cas phone to find that he had been listening to some guy named Sam Smith. After a moment he realized the song Stay With Me was playing on repeat.
Cas sniffled the tears away and nodded tiredly before moving to his stomach again, so he was settled between Dean’s legs and his head in Dean’s lap. “That’s b… better… thank you Honeybee.”
Cas smiled proudly, also ignoring the slight hardening in his pants because no human being should ever sound that divine while only eating a burger, “Yes, there is also a pecan pie in the oven.”
Cas chewed his lip and looked at the ground, he instantly knew he had made Dean nervous, but he needed to talk to Dean about this, and it was every bit as dangerous as he had made it sound. “Do you know anything about… angel sexuality?”
Cas nodded some, he knew Dean was thinking the same thing and he understood why they had both been through so much. “I know Sam… sometimes finding the good, in a bad situation is the best you can do… I am sorry about losing Charlie, I am”
Dean smiled at him before he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, “We can kick Sammy and Gabe out for an hour or two, have them go get food.”
Dean pulled off Cas’ now fully erect and leaking member, the taste of Castiel's pre-cum on his tongue. Dean slowly stood, ignoring the pain in his knees from kneeling in the concrete for too long. Dean pulled Cas mouth to his once more, gently running his tongue against the angel’s lips, and quickly the angel opened his mouth and Dean pressed himself even closer to Cas, his hand snaking between them and rubbing Cas’ hard cock slowly.
Cas mad a soft huffing noise still slightly confused but he did as Dean said and started to look around. Cas soon found a black suit with a light blue shirt under it that he liked. Cas showed Dean, Dean looked at the suit and it was pretty much the same as the one Cas’ used to wear but darker, and the undershirt matched Cas’ eyes. “Looks good Cas, let’s see if they have it in your size.”
The young girl smiled back and nodded excitedly, “Absolutely! I am so happy to hear someone willing to be open about their sexuality, and it’s so rare around here.”
The desire to touch Dean made Cas’ palms itch and soon he did just that, making the lube Dean had to his side appear in his hands and put some on his hands before moving between the hunter’s legs. Cas was surprised at the coolness of the fluid and used his grace to warm it some, then laying his other hand on Dean’s knee, making Dean’s eyes open once again, the man’s pupils blown wide with lust. Cas followed Dean’s movements as he gently rubbed Dean’s perineum, his fingers moving in small circles around Dean’s hole, the tight pucker gently relaxing.
Dean’s thoughts stilled utterly, that was the absolute last thing he had expected Castiel to say, after a moment, he stuttered, “W…what?”
Castiel took a deep breath, “Right… it isn’t necessarily in any of the lore I suppose…” Cas had grown significantly paler, and his hands were shaking, not that Cas noticed this, but Dean had, before Dean could say anything Castiel finally spoke, “Angels are sexless, we… we have no specific sex until inhabiting a human body. However there…. It is still possible for us to have… intercourse though it is not the same as human intercourse.”
Dean purred as Cas rubbed his nose against the junction between Dean’s neck and shoulder. Dean had barely registered the last few words Cas said as he felt his clarity fading. It frustrated him, and he felt like he was fighting against a brick wall as he watched himself acting like a bitch in heat, although according to what Cas that’s basically what he was right now.
Dean smiled at the suggestion, after the whole debacle with Claire, Cas had been trying to involve her more and more, and the girl accepted it. Even though Cas knew he would never fully make it up to her, he did care about her a lot. “I am sure they would love to come, Angel,”
Cas knew it was meant to be a rhetorical question but he answered anyway, “You have saved the world Dean, more times then some can count. You deserve happiness”
Dean smiled at the fact that Cas had called Baby her instead of just a car as he had in the beginning. “Yeah well, I need to show you how to take care of her the right way,”
Dean made a soft mewling noise in his sleep pulling Cas from his thoughts, and Cas looked down at Dean, who was still fast asleep but had rolled closer to Cas chest. Cas smiled and pulled Dean closer to him, his finding the handprint on Dean’s shoulder, earning a gentle gasp from Dean as he leaned into the touch.
Cas held back the chuckle because he could see the apparent frustration on his hunters face and shook his head gently, “Of course not, that would be cheating Honeybee.”
Dean saw the pain crossing Cas’ face, the emotion’s and he could feel it like the angel was broadcasting it. Dean wasn’t an idiot, well he was a lot of the time but at the same time he knew Cas, he had loved the angel for a long time.
Its been 6 days since Cas' wings finished molting. Dean and Sam had no choice but to go on a hunt the day after and had been gone since. When they get back, Cas surprises Dean with dinner, dessert, and a massage.
By the time Dean came back, Cas had cleaned up their mess and was pulled his pants back on. Dean smiled some at Cas, “I am going to get some lunch, want anything?”
What it is like to be in love, explained by two people who are completely and uttrly in love with each other.
The doctor nodded gently, “You had a severe allergic reaction to the stings, your throat was completely closed when we first got you. We gave you some epinephrine and some heavy antihistamines…. We are going to give you a prescription epi-pen so we can avoid your reaction being this bad again,”
Cas made Dean dinner, gave him a mind-blowing blow-job, and then fucked him into the mattress before he was finally ready to broach the subject. “I thought maybe we could get a kitten…” Cas chewed his lip, and it wasn’t exactly the thing he wanted to talk about, although it had also been on his mind.
Dean’s shoulders dropped some before he looked at Cas, “Can… can we do something before Sam and Jack get back?”
Cas’ hands moved now, slowly grabbing the hem of Dean’s black t-shirt, Dean shivered as Castiel’s fingertips brushed his skin. Cas looked up at Dean, meeting the man’s eyes, before being gentle as he pulled the black t-shirt over Dean’s head. Cas’ eyes were first drawn to the hunter’s anti-possession tattoo, then the faded scar on Dean’s left arm, to be fair Cas didn’t even need to see it to know exactly where the scar was, he was the one who put it there, it would forever be in his memories.
Dean frowned but nodded and moved closer to Cas clinging to him and bracing himself for the flight. Cas closed his eyes and flew to where he could feel Gabriel’s grace when both the angel and the hunter opened their eyes, they found themselves in the Impala.
It was evident it was not meant to be a question, but Cas shook his head, “She can track them with the power of the spell, so she knows where they are,”
Cas chewed his lip for a moment before suddenly standing and hugging Gabriel. Gabe stood there in shock for a moment before hugging Cas back tightly. Cas whispered, "Why... why did you..."
Dean turned over in Cas’ arms so his face was now in Cas’ chest and he was starting to drift off to sleep but not before whispering, “Love you, Angel,”
Cas hummed gently before suggesting, “Well the meadow behind the bunker is beautiful, and in the summer it will be even more so with the tall grass and flowers.”
Cas was still hesitant but didn’t respond this time. Dean moved more so he could drive, and looked down at Sam and Gabriel, “Sammy you guys gotta sit with Cas on his lap so I can drive,”
Cas nodded and went to look out the window to watch the people passing by, and Dean made sure wasn’t paying attention as he walked up to the waiter and carefully tapped him on the shoulder lightly clearing his throat, “Hi… I um was wondering if after we were done eating if you could put this,” Dean showed the man Cas’ ring, “In my boyfriend’s champagne.”
Dean smiled before pulling further away, letting Cas step away so he could open the door, Dean shed his jacket as he walked into the room, throwing it haphazardly onto the chair by his desk. Cas followed suit and took his trench-coat off, draping it over the chair with a bit more care as he did so. Dean felt his nerves rising in his chest, but at the same time, the excitement bristled and overtook the nervous feeling.
Despite having barely been paying attention Dean was aware that Sam was no longer there, and after a minute he finally couldn’t take it anymore and he started to break down, Dean’s knees gave out and he started to collapse but Cas’ arms caught him and gently eased Dean to the ground following with him. Cas hugged Dean tightly and let Dean sob into his shoulder. Dean hadn’t had much chance to break down after her death besides his episode of pure rage taken out on the werewolf that had killed Charlie. After killing the rest of the pack, they had wrapped Charlie’s body up and put her in Baby and drove straight back home. Dean had wanted to get her back to the bunker for Hunter’s funeral she deserved. Dean had chopped the wood for the pyre and taken his anger out on the trees.
Gabriel huffed in annoyance but hid his smirk as he left. Cas looked at Dean and sighed gently, “Dean you know he is upset over Sam, and Sam’s refusal to talk to him about their relationship.”
Gabe watched Sam as he left quietly sitting down to wait while he waited for them to come back. Gabe sighed and closed his eyes, he remembered that fight, it had broken his heart but he couldn’t let Lucifer or the other stupid gods kill Sam or Dean yet. They needed to stop the Apocalypse from happening. Gabe missed Sam and being around him and not talking to him was driving him insane but he understood why Sam was giving him the cold shoulder.
Cas opened the book and gently flipped through the pages, he was in complete awe of his human, the drawings were breathtaking, even some of the first ones that weren’t as good. “These are all amazing Dean, really they are breathtaking,”
Cas was still in bed because after fucking practically all over the bunker, even the angel had been well worn out and fallen asleep at some point after Dean had. Dean knew he could just ask Cas to clean it up with his grace, but Dean knew he needed to do a deep cleaning of the kitchen anyways, their mess had just sped up the need. Dean also really wanted to let Cas sleep, he knew it was rare that the angel did so anymore.
Cas looked up briefly, obviously entranced in whatever he was reading, which Dean didn’t mind. “Hello, Dean,”
Dean took a steadying breath before reaching for the glass, and carefully pulling the ring out by the string the waiter had attached to it and then wiped it off before meeting Cas’ eyes again. “Castiel, we have been through so much together, and it took us both a long time to get to this point, it was longer than I wish it could have been, but the point is, is that we are here now, and I cannot imagine not spending the rest of my life without you by my side. So Castiel, will you do me the honor of marrying me,”
“Open your eyes Castiel,” The Empty’s voice filled his ears, well it was Meg’s former, but familiar gravelly voice.
Dean groaned gently while he tried to open his eyes, his whole body felt like it was on fire just without burning and he didn’t understand why. The last thing he could clearly remember was that he had been on a hunt for a witch with Sam, Cas was in Heaven helping Gabriel. Dean groaned again and tried to move, but then he heard Sam’s voice and he tried to move but he could feel Sam touching him holding him down. “Easy Dean, the witch hit you with some sort of spell, I tried calling Cas but-“
Cas watched Dean’s body react to their contact, he could feel the emotions pulsing off of Dean’s soul, slowly Cas pulled his hand away and used it to cup Dean’s cheek, the hunter opened his eyes that held unshed tears. Cas pressed their lips together again, Dean put his hands on Cas’ waist and pulled the angel closer to him, reveling in the feeling of their bare skin touching.
Dean suddenly pulled Cas into his chest, hugging him tightly and closing his eyes relieved that Cas finally had his grace back. Dean knew the angel wasn’t invincible but he was much harder to kill then he was as a human. Cas closed his eyes and wrapped his wings around Dean, thinking they were only in the other plane and Dean wouldn’t feel them.
Sam was running to the garage then and replied trying to stay calm, “Okay Cas… um… fuck make sure to get his feet up, his clothes need to be loose enough for him to breath”
Cas wanted to say something, but then Gabriel came in and kneeled next to Dean, “Hey there a baby bird,”
This chapter slightly coincides with the first fifteen minutes of Ep. 19, certain details changed to include Castiel being alive (As he should be). I had originally planned to do it all in one but I feel like its long enough as is so I broke it up. Hope you guys enjoy <3
Dena smiled before pulling his laptop out and connected it to his TV, then the settled in bed together watching episodes of Hawaii Five-O. Cas made off-handed comments about things the show got wrong or the correct information. At some point, Cas told Dean he had assisted in making a few of the animals that lived in Hawaii because almost all the angels helped created life in some way. Cas told Dean he had created the dolphins, and a bird Dean had never heard of in his life.
Cas looked at Gabriel who was studying Dean closely, “I cannot sense what the witch did to Dean. Could you try brother?”
Cas couldn’t help but preen at hearing his full angelic name on Dean’s lips, said with so much pleasure and need. Cas positioned himself so he could hit that same spot on every thrust, it barely took three more thrusts before Dean orgasmed so hard his vision whited out, his back arched up into Cas so hard that Cas was sure if he hadn’t been pressing him down Dean might have hurt his back. Dean’s hole squeezed roughly around Cas’ cock pulling him into his own orgasm.
The waiter nodded, and after getting their sides he wrote it all down and took their menus, “Alright I will get that all in for you guys,”
Dean nodded and watched him walk off for a moment and then leaned forward and captured Cas’ lips slowly, “I will be right back, Angel, I got to run to the bathroom.”
Without warning Dean suddenly had an armful of Cas as he wrapped his arms around Dean, burying his nose in Dean’s shoulder, and Cas was shaking hard. “You… you stopped breathing Dean… I… I couldn’t heal you… I thought… I thought I lost you… I… I was terrified, Dean…”
Dean practically purring and rolled to his side, curling into Cas’ slightly sweat soaked chest. Cas closed his eyes and pulled Dean in closer to him.
Sam rolled his eyes again, “Nice try Dean. Gabe gets a record of the purchases on that card, so what are you doing Dean?”
Castiel didn’t bother stopping the tears that filled his eyes, his face split into a wide smile before he pressed his lips to Dean’s once more and his shoulder’s dropped the tension they had.
Cas gasped and pulled Dean close to him, wrapping his arm around Dean’s back, he could feel the hunter’s pure desire and need for him pulsing off him in waves, it was almost overwhelming if it weren’t for the fact that Castiel also felt the desire and need for Dean in return.
Dean didn’t want to admit how much he sort of liked the idea and brought up the only argument he legitimately had against it, “I get all sneezy around cats Cas, I think I am allergic,”
Dean glared at Cas before yanking the map from the former angel’s hands and looked at it. “Damn it, Cas!” They were lost, currently sitting on the side of some backcountry road. Normally would he use his phone but Dean had forgotten to charge the stupid thing after finishing his hunt with Cas and the fallen angel barely knew how to use his let alone remember to charge it. Dean had put the former angel on map duty so he could focus on driving, and he had sensed that something was wrong almost an hour ago but then Castiel seemed confident within a few minutes and thought they were on the right road to get home.
The idea of losing Cas again made Dean’s stomach lurch and he had to force himself from yelling, he cupped the former angel's cheek and made Cas look at him again, “Don’t leave me Cas… I wasn’t just saying random shit, you make things easier… so much easier and I swear if I have to go as far as making a deal with fucking Crowley to bring you back and I will not hesitate Cas.”
Dean chuckled and nodded, “Just the way you like Cas. Now come on.” Dean gently pushed Cas off of him at the same time and got up.
It's now been a few days since Cas got his grace back, Dean sleeps peacefully with his angel watching over him
Cas swallowed thickly again, “I didn’t think it was fair for me to know this information, and not share the possibility with you. You deserved the right to choose Dean.”
Cas could not help but smile back at Dean, he knew very well of Dean’s obsession with cowboys and they had roleplayed before. “We should be fast Dean,”
Now though, he was just done, he was still pissed, especially at himself but right now the sadness was taking over, Charlie had never wanted to be in the life, but then Dean and Sam had forced her into it. Cas watched the fire as it was finally burning the body of their friend. Dean was still clinging desperately to Cas, but he was also watching the fire, barely able to make himself tear his eyes away from it. Dean’s chest felt so unbelievably tight from the emotions he was forcing himself to keep in but he couldn’t bring himself to take his eyes off of Charlie’s burning body.
Dean hesitated again, but Cas gently tugged on his arm and whispered, “Baby will be just fine Dean,”
Cas gently used the last bit of grace he could, for now, to clean both of them up, slowly pulling out of Dean before laying next to the man. Dean once again wrapped himself around Cas and held onto the angel tightly.
Dean found himself relaxing more as he looked at the total before handing her the card Gabe had given him, “Yeah… I uh… I am working on it. My boyfriend is much better about it but… well, he doesn’t understand social norms that well,”
Dean had noticed though, the first thing Dean had noticed was Cas’ journal because Dean had never actually seen the journal, he just knew that the angel kept a diary. Cas had started to write in the journal after he had become human, and he said it was natural for him to continue writing in it after he got his grace back.
It's a week before Dean's birthday and Castiel has never wrapped a present before, Dean offers to help since his present is already in a boring old box and hidden from his view.
Dean’s eyebrows knitted together, that was not where he was expecting the conversation to go. “Um… no?”
Dean nodded barely and stroked Cas’ sweaty hair gently. Gabe watched Dean softly talking to Cas, even though Cas was out cold and he smiled softly to himself. Even though he didn’t always trust Dean not to screw up, and hurt Cas, the way Dean was being now with Cas made it obvious to him that Dean would do anything for his baby brother.
Dean didn’t have to ask how Cas knew what he wanted, he had been silently praying to Cas without even meaning to. “Yes… please… I need you.”
Cas shook his head gently in confusion, “They are beautiful drawings Dean, I would think he would have appreciated your drawings…”
When he got down the stairs Sam was looking at his computer studying something on it, he spoke without looking up, "I checked the cameras we put up around the bunker and in the library and... it looks like his eyes are glowing blue, he flinches when I try to talk to him but he keeps walking..."
After making sure all the cuts were clean he bandaged the burns first, before looking at the deeper cuts that needed stitches. Cleaning the cuts hurt but the stitches were going to be the worst part and he desperately wished that he had pain medicine to give him to make it easier on Cas. Cas’ eyes were now wide open and he was panting hard through the rag, beads of sweat on his face from the pain. Dean cupped Cas’ cheek and kissed his head gently before looking into his eyes, “Okay baby, that was the easy part… this next bit… it's going to be worse, try to stay awake if you can but it's okay if you can’t.”
Cas slowly pulled his finger out before gently pushing two in, still using his grace to override the pain into pleasure, and slowly started stretching Dean open.
Sam and Cas both stared at Gabriel in confusion, before Sam finally interrupted the tense silence. Although it wasn’t exactly silent because of the whining coming from Dean on the bed behind him, “What are you talking about Gabe?”
So this one is definitely very fluffy, but I love it. It happens only a few hours after our lovely couple got lost
Sam nodded, quickly putting his bag down before grabbing Dean’s and digging in it for the first aid kit. Once Sam finally found it he handed it to his brother and then grabbed a washcloth from the bathroom and handed it to Dean.
Cas was to focus on watching them trying to get Dean to breathe again to answer the nurse's question. Sam looked at Cas for a moment before turning to the nurse, “He was stung by something, I… I don’t know if it was wasps or bees, we just found him…”
After a moment of confusion, the idea Dean was having seemed to pop into her head, she smiled again and nodded, “I think we can do that, it would take a few weeks since its custom. Do you mind if I take a picture so I can send it in with the order so the match is better,” Dean nodded easily and stood still while the woman took a picture of his right eye, then his left, then both. She started to write details on a piece of paper, “What size?”
Cas watched Dean lay his jeans down before sifting through the jeans and finally finding the exact pair with Cas’ measurements. Cas softly asked, “What are the numbers, Dean?”
A few days later Dean leaned heavily into Cas after finally finishing a long hunt, it was the hardest one they had been on since Charlie died, and Dean had been stupidly distracted, nearly getting himself and Cas killed. Cas gently wrapped his arms around Dean, running his fingers through Dean’s sweat-soaked hair as he leads them to the motel bed and made Dean sit down, sitting down with him. “It’s okay Dean, I am here”
Gabriel chuckled softly and looked at Cas, who was intently watched Dean still, he knew what his little brother was thinking about, Dean’s health had taken a sharp decline in the last few months, and he was wondering how much longer he would get to spend time with him. The rest of Dean’s birthday was spent quietly relaxing. Sam and Gabe got him some parts for Baby, and Cas had given him a new rather fancy and expensive-looking watch.
Dean hummed gently before pulling Cas close to him, despite his usual hesitancy for PDA he was too happy to care, he pressed his lips to Cas’ softer and slower this time. Sighing gently into Cas’ lips and pulling away just enough, “I know Cas, and well truthfully we don’t even have actually to get married… I just… well, I wanted us to have something…”
Dean growled impatiently, "Who the fuck did this, and how the hell did they know Cas was even here?!"
Cas watched, and listened to Dean as he sang to the toddler and fledgling, he felt like now things had been better. Cas silently wondered if maybe he could handle having a child, but he also knew Nephilim were considered abominations and knew their child would be hunted its whole life by the powers of Heaven and even Hell if they found out, so he was quite unsure of the idea of having a child. Cas’ thoughts were interrupted by Dean laying down next to him and wrapping his arms around him. Cas smiled warmly at Dean, “That was the song your mother sang to you correct?”
Cas knew in an instant with the young version of Gabriel had done, “He used is grace to fly from the table since he is a fledgling he can only fly with his grace exposed.”
It was almost 7 hours later before Dean finally began to stir, he groaned gently trying to sit up his mind feeling overwhelmingly hazy. Cas was wide awake and gently stood up and laid his hand on Dean’s chest to stop him, “Shhh Dean easy, don’t move you are intubated”
Dean panted harshly, his chest rising and falling and he met Cas’ stunningly blue eyes, “I am okay, just, go slow.”
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean, every morning on Dean’s birthday, the hunter asked him that question even though he knew the answer very well. “I have never made you cook breakfast on your birthday since we got married, Dean,”
Gabriel sighed, “Oh baby bird. You obviously didn’t pay enough attention in sex ed in angel school. She somehow knew about the piece of grace you left inside Dean and used that piece inside Dean-O to forge it with his soul long enough to make Dean go into heat, since Dean is obviously a bottom, he became the Omega in this equation, you little brother are an Alpha, and I am also an alpha. That’s the reason you keep looking at me like you want to kill me if any part of me moves closer to Dean.”
Eventually, Dean tore his eyes away from Castiel’s and focused them on the stiffening member in front of him, it had been a while since Dean had given a blowjob but the motions were practically muscle memory. Dean slowly rubbed Cas’ thigh before leaning forward and licking up and down Cas’ shaft. Instantly earning himself a deep groan of pleasure from the angel. Dean almost froze at the sound, he had thought Cas’ voice was a turn on but that, fuck that was practically a porn worthy moan.
Dean sighed some, but his shoulder relaxed the tension he had been holding, “Well then you already know what I am doing Bitch,”
Dean tried to say he realized his feelings for Castiel in Purgatory when he was ripping apart the place to find his angel. Dean had started to figure it out that maybe he was in love with the angel after the Leviathans took over Cas’ body and he walked into the lake and the only thing that comes out was his trench-coat. Dean was a disaster and a mess after that day. Dean had begged God if he was really out there to just bring Castiel back because between the crap going on with Sam and losing Cas he wasn’t sure he could handle it anymore.
Dean smiled a little at hearing Cas’ voice, he knew it hadn’t been long since he had heard it but he genuinely loved Cas’ voice. “Sammy went to get you some Vicodin, do you want one?”
The first time Castiel met Dean, he had started to feel things for Dean Winchester even more because the human was beautiful, feisty, and most interesting. The way Dean had reacted to him made him even more curious about Humanity. Castiel knew that most Humans would have been too scared, and some may have fainted. Not Dean though, Dean Winchester had shot him with Silver, Rock salt and had even stabbed him with the Demon Knife.
Cas shook his head, he understood the humor behind what Dean had ended his confession with. A certain thing Dean had said earlier was sticking his head and Cas cleared his throat, “Dean… you said… you said you did things… what did you mean?”
Cas was confused, his brain taking a moment to catch up before he sighed gently, “I am… struggling with being human… as you have seen my emotions get the better of me more often than I like… not to mention the… the dreams… sometimes… sometimes I wish that Metatron had just killed me…”
Dean ignored the burning sensation in his eyes as he nodded, “Don’t sacrifice yourself for me Cas… ever… I don’t know what’s going to happen but… we go down together…”
Cas yawned a little, he had had his grace back for a couple of months now, and occasionally he was able to sleep, mostly because he was constantly away from Heaven. This tended to drain his grace faster, but sleeping a few hours usually helped him feel better.
Sam looks at the sigil, he recognizes it to and he goes to one of the bookshelves to grab a book before putting it on the table, then flipping to a page that showed the sigil, that says Horn of Gabriel and that's when Dean remembers as Sam explains it, "Yeah, remember wasn't Uriel using it. It calls angels to it... it reminds them of Heaven or something."
Dean chuckled warmly and smiled down at the toddler version of his brother, “I forgot how addicted Sammy was to McDonald’s when he was little like this,”
Dean groaned gently in pleasure as Cas slowly pulled out of him, then collapsed next to him. Cas carefully wrapped his arms around Dean and relaxed while he held his human. Dean sighed and closed his eyes, listening to his Angel’s quiet breathing and profoundly enjoying the peaceful post-coital bliss.
Cas cheek heated up as Dean kissed along his neck and tried to look away, but Dean was to close, “I… uh…”
Cas swallowed thickly, this time meeting Dean’s eyes, “I can carry a child, a child that would be Nephilim, and it would be wholly our child Honeybee,”
Dean’s face was hard as stone as he watched the burning corpse of his adopted sister. Charlie had been the one to bring the hunt to them, it was a pack of werewolves that were killing humans. One of them had grabbed her and ripped her heart out before any of them had a chance to get to her. Cas was holding Dean’s hand tightly, his boyfriend had barely said a word since Charlie died, besides screaming and then immediately killing the werewolf in his rage. Cas knew how much Dean loves Charlie, and thought of the young woman as a sister. Cas had wished belatedly he had his grace, but with the damage she had taken, Cas wasn't sure it would have even mattered.
Gabriel pouted and looked like he was going to cry but then looked over at Sam and Dean, then nodded and suddenly hugged Cas, “I sorry birdie, love you.”
Sam was at the stove putting what appeared to be an omelete on a plate and grabbing his coffee before turning to go sit at the table. His eyes widened as he looked at Cas, he knew that shirt was Dean’s and he was pretty sure those pants were also Dean’s. Sam met his brother’s eyes, “Dude, why is Cas wearing your clothes?”
Dean’s phone started ringing again causing Castiel to pull away and Dean looked down at his phone that was still sitting on the ground next to him, Sam’s name on the screen. Dean swallowed thickly and picked up his phone, hitting the green button and putting his brother on speaker, “Sammy…”
Cas smiled back, the corners of his eyes crinkling gently, “I made your favorite, I… I wanted to thank you for taking care of me when my wings were molting.”
Cas nodded and slowly sat back so his ass was resting on his ankles, unbothered by the traditionally uncomfortable position.
It took Cas a moment to notice the ring sitting at the bottom of the glass when he had gone to reach for his drink, he looked up to say something to the waiter but instead his eyes met Dean’s who had deftly slipped out of the booth and was now kneeling slightly on one knee on the ground. Dean took a breath, and his eyes went to the ring at the bottom of the champagne glass. The motion made Cas realize what was now going on, and his nerves ramped up.
Dean huffed softly and looked away, before he kissed Cas again and checked his grocery list and shouting out as he walked away, “I will be back later, Angel.”
Gabe chewed his lip hesitantly before shaking his head, “No… I am sorry, Sam… Dean just had a massive heart attack and Cas… Cas couldn’t save him.”
Cas blushed but then hugged Gabriel back and carried him back to the table, putting him in his seat next to Sam. Cas then used his grace to fix the lights and TV, making the mess from the shattered glass disappear. After a few more minutes, they were both finally finished eating, and Dean looked at the two very messy toddlers and shook his head gently, “Okay bath time. Then we need to find you guys some clothes.”
Dean had pretty much always been competitive, even if it wasn’t exactly on purpose. Dean always tried to win John’s affection and interest the way his little brother had, following John’s rules to the letter most of the time, giving up his entire childhood to raise and protect Sam, it was never enough. It had taken a long time after John’s death for Dean to accept the shitty way he grew up, it didn’t matter anymore because John was long dead and being angry over it made no sense. Despite that, though, his competitive nature was far too ingrained in him to forget it and stop being competitive. As Dean got older he had come to accept that you can’t win every single time, but after losing a game of chess, (something Dean was usually surprisingly good at) to Cas for the 5th time in a row he was starting to get rather frustrated, “Damn it Cas are you using your mojo?”
Dean looked hesitant but he fully trusted Cas and slowly closed his eyes. Cas smiled before putting his hand on Dean’s clothed chest, using his grace to make their clothes disappear. The sudden cold air made Dean gasp gently, but he was rewarded with a small kiss from Cas. While they were kissing and gently rutting against each other Cas also pulled his wings forth into this plane. Dean had asked a few times for Cas to let his wings be out while they were having sex, but Cas was too nervous, and he wasn’t sure what exactly possessed him to do it this time. Cas spread his wings out gently before looking down at Dean who was waiting quietly, his eyes still closed, Cas leaned forward and kissed Dean again, gently whispering, “Open your eyes Honeybee,”
Cas bit his lip harder, nearly drawing blood and shook his head, “You can’t go yet, Dean… I don’t… I don’t want you to go yet… please” The word please came out so broken as Cas tried to plead with Dean and keep his human alive. Cas could feel the reaper there, and he wanted to yell at it, it wouldn’t matter because Dean’s soul was going to become attached to Cas’ grace, but the reaper had to be there for the death.
Their conversations always started with Dean checking in on Cas’s day. It warmed Cas the way he remembered every detail Cas shared, always asking how his quiz went or whether the guy he’d complained about was now pulling his weight for their group project. From there Cas got the status report on the engine rebuild Dean had been struggling with and the latest on the regulars at the diner. Once they’d thoroughly gone through their days, they moved to all sorts of topics.
“Donna!” Charlie waved to the kitchen manager and she bounded over, a ready smile on her face as always.
all around town, though.” He slaps his hand against his chest at the word “mine” and the sound echoes through the tension filling the room. “Hey, tell enough people and maybe Alastair will come back and finish the job. Is that what you want?”
“The kids are by far the best part of the job. It’s all the rest--the hoops the state requires teachers to jump through, the parents and their over the top demands--that’s what burns out the teachers.”
The kid is getting too old to fool. He stomps down directly on the crack between the two squares of concrete and yells “Step on a crack, break your uncle’s back!” Making sure to jump directly onto each one with both feet, he hurries ahead, still chanting.
“Don’t give me that look,” Cas says, running a finger along his lower lip, before leaning in to kiss his temple.
Cas moves to sit on the floor beside him, reaching out his hand. Defeated, Dean slaps it into his open palm like he’s delivering a scalpel to a surgeon. Cas holds it up so that the toy fish dangles in the air, flicking his wrist every so often so that the fish twitches. Lady Marmalade watches, first in a bored offhand manner, but then with increasing interest and when he lowers it down almost to her nose, she swipes a paw at it.
“All I did was make sure he had your number. Which, by the way, you neglected to mention he gave you his.”
Balthazar is coming from another engagement, so they agree to meet at the theater. Cas walks the few blocks there, taking in the sights of the city as he does. The weather is turning colder, but there are plenty of people out. Young families and couples all navigate the sidewalk, looking to start their weekend with a meal out or a treat from the ice cream shop. He catches sight of an older couple, both dressed nicely. The man is wearing a topcoat and hat, and the woman has on a skirt with stockings and low heels. Her grey hair is perfectly coiffed, like she just came from the salon. The man walks with a cane, but his free hand is tucked in his wife’s arm as they walk slowly up the street. They come to a stop in front of a restaurant, one that’s been there for decades according to the sign in the window. The doorman holds the door open for them, greeting them by name and assuring them that their regular table is ready. Cas gets a glimpse of old world glamor inside, dark wood paneling and candles glowing on crisp white tablecloths.
“You can tell him yourself next time you see him.” Dean’s sure it won’t come up, but he appreciates the message Sam is sending here. They won’t keep Henry from Dean despite the fact that he’s a mess.
Besides, Cas could say no. He could say he doesn’t want to put Dean out. He could say he doesn’t want Dean going to all that extra trouble, not when he’s already doing so much for Cas as it is. And to be honest, Cas
“Hey.” Dean’s tone is clipped and Cas can see the tension on his face, like he wants to cut and run.
It took Dean’s sleep heavy brain a moment to process what his angel had just told him before he was suddenly sitting up, taking his shirt off so he could change and shouting, “Fuck Cas, why didn’t you wake me up I told you I had sh-“
And indeed Castiel fell, both literally and figuratively for Dean Winchester. Cas had known the moment he gripped Dean Winchester’s soul and raised it from Pe3rdition that something was different about this human.
Suddenly Dean remembers what had happened, “A bird was messing with a damn wasp’ nest, I remembered feeling one pinch and then the next minute I was full-on swarmed…”
Dean looked up to meet Cas’ innocent-looking blue eyes, and at that moment, his frustrations melted away. Dean softly sighed and patted the bed motioning for Cas to sit next to him, “Not your fault angel, I am just really competitive.”
Despite the fact that Dean did want a family with Cas, he also refused to put that kind of hunted life on a child, he had been through his hell as a child, and the idea of his child being hunted his whole experience made him refuse to want a child at that cost, perhaps they could look into adoption, but Dean was content just to have Cas and their kitten once they finally went to get it. “Thank you, angel, but I just can’t put that on a child.” Castiel didn’t need to respond, and he understood where Dean was coming from, he even agreed gravely.
Cas nodded as he moved to make Dean’s coffee, “Alright, well if you need anything while you are out there, pray to me.”
Cas nodded and grabbed the lube again, liberally coating his cock before positioning himself at Dean’s hole, then very gingerly pressing in, immediately he was overwhelmed with the sensation of the tightness and the pressure. Cas paused and forced himself to calm down despite desperately wanting to press in more, this wasn’t just about him he needed to make sure Dean was alright. Cas looked at Dean and the man’s face was pinched with the pain but at the same time, he sighed with relief.
Cas smiled sadly with tears in his own eyes, “Okay Dean… I promise.” Cas had hesitated to say those words, he loved Dean so much, he never wanted to live in a world without Dean. Even if they were fighting and did go down together, one of them would die first, Castiel would rather it be him always.
Sam looked at the possible case on the computer screen, sighing audibly. Sam was pretty sure it was a ghoul, but the case was in Dodge City, Sam knew exactly what that meant for him, Dean’s stupid cowboy obsession. Luckily for Sam, Cas would have to deal with him more than anything. Since Cas had come back, Dean had barely let the poor angel out of his sight.
Dean hummed softly as he looked between Cas, and the two toddlers in his lap, “Okay, well temporary is good right, Angel?”
Cas cut Dean off by grabbing his wrist and pulling him close, making Dean look at him, “Dean! I already took care of it, Sam and I already took care of everything. You haven’t been sleeping well lately, so I wanted to let you sleep in.”
Cas smiled softly and kissed Dean slowly, “Get some sleep, Honeybee, I will watch over them.” Dean hummed gently in response, he was already half-asleep before he cuddled more into his angel, and he was soon fast asleep.
Dean handed the present back to Cas and watched him as he followed Dean’s instructions exactly, but it had somehow ended up looking better then Dean had ever done before. “See that looks, great angel!”
Dean huffed in annoyance again as he tried to think of something that he was sure he could win. Cas gently cleared his throat to break the silence, “Dean if you wish, we could not play anything else.”
Cas groaned at the words coming out of Dean’s mouth and started thrusting into him harshly, “Such a good Omega, so good, so pretty. Going to breed you.”
Cas bit his lip hard trying to stop tears from falling and focused as much of his grace as he could to try to help Dean’s heart beating. Dean slowly grabbed his angel’s wrist and pulled Cas closer to him, “Angel… you… you can’t… save me this time.”
Dean smiled at his new attire, any chance he could see Cas shirtless was his favorite. Cas looked down-right gorgeous with his pale skin, mostly toned abs, little happy trail and the scars that Dean adored. Cas could see Dean was distracted and gently cleared his throat, “Dean…”
Dean reached up and tried to pull Cas against him, but Cas growled lowly and stopped him and his voice dropped an octave, “I am in charge. You will get what you want but I am in charge of this, is that understood Dean?” The authority and power in Cas’ voice made the side of him that hated being dominated bristle, but the largest part of him loved it and he preened with desire. When Dean failed to give an understandable answer, Cas growled more and pinned Dean’s hands over his head, “I said, Is that understood Dean!”
Dean sighed heavily and ran his fingers through his disheveled hair, then gently kissed Cas, “It’s fine Angel, and I didn’t hear you so you sort of scared the shit out of me,”
Cas nodded softly before he went back to his cleaning. When Dean came home a couple of hours later, Cas didn’t say anything as he heard Dean humming the same song, and dancing just a smidge as he brought in the groceries.
Cas nodded gently, “Thank you, Sam, there is a grilled chicken salad in the fridge, and Gabriel is in the bathroom with a hot bath for you.”
Cas nodded weakly, he had heard and understood what Dean had said but he couldn’t make any words come out, he realized his mouth was full of blood and coughed when he tried to take a deep breath. He was starting to feel light-headed, no doubt from loss of blood.
Cas sighed gently before moving closer to Dean and taking his hand, “I understand that Dean, but technically he did not kill you, and he had been trying to prepare Sam for living life without you. Come on we should go get our stuff”
Dean held back the urge to chuckle and smiled warmly, “I already wrote down you size angel, just find something you like and I will make sure it is the right size.”
Cas nodded and followed Dean into the garage. After Dean got everything ready, he looked at Cas, “We should probably change into something else,”
This time the man was much more vocal in his hatred and he shouted, “Burn in Hell you disgusting Faggots!”
Dean smirked before leaning forward and capturing Cas’ lips slowly before bending down more to whisper in his ear, “Showing you that you are still just as hot to me as the day we met.” Dean pulled away more his eyes raking over the former angel’s body before softly saying, “Speaking of, I kind of wish there was a scar for when I stabbed you, not that I thought to stab you was fun but, it would mark when we first met.”
Cas groaned gently as he was pulled into awareness, his whole body felt sore and he didn't remember why. When Cas opened his eyes he found himself in a completely different room then he had fallen asleep in. The room was made of stone, and there was a large window, a window being a loose term because it wasn't closed, it was just more of a hole in the wall. The covers that he was under were animal skins of some sort, Cas suddenly tried to sit up and push the covers off him in a sudden panic. The voice next to him was gentle and made him stopped, "Relax love..."
Watching Dean grow old, was so much harder than Cas thought it was going to be. Not because he didn’t expect it, but because he couldn’t become old with him. Cas was constantly reminded that there will be a day that Dean is going to be gone and it was starting to be sooner rather than later now. Cas watched Dean’s sleeping more closely now because his heart was weaker then it had been when he was younger, not only because of Dean’s bad eating habits, but also the countless injuries on the hunts the man had been on.
There were suddenly cheers and people clapping around them, Cas tried to look up but before he could Dean quickly captured Cas’ lips, kissing him deeply. Cas closed his eyes and leaned into Dean’s warmth until Dean slowly pulled away and Dean chuckled gently despite the tear rolling down his cheek. Dean then carefully slipped the ring on Cas’ finger before quickly returning into his seat. Everyone else’s excitement from their new engagement started to wind down around them, but Dean and Cas were both still buzzing with their enthusiasm. Dean paid, and then instead of getting in Baby, they decided to walk next to the lake near the restaurant that was barely large enough to be called a lake but also to large to be called a pond. Cas finally broke the excited silence, “You know we do not have to get married for me to be with you until the end of your life, Dean.”
Cas smiled at the offer before shaking his head, “No thank you, Dean. Do you mind if I meet you in the kitchen, I need to check my left-wing, it is sore. I think there could be a twisted feather…”
Dean bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from snapping at Cas, and he knew it wasn’t precisely the angels’ fault, “No, No damn it. I am just trying to think of something,”
Cas gave a small chuckle and shrugged softly, “More of Hawaii Five-O, I have almost finished the seasons that are on Netflix,” After studying Sam for a moment he asked, “Are you going for a run?”
Cas nodded and watched as Dean sprayed down the Impala, then he got a sponge out of the soap bucket and threw it at Cas. Cas barely managed to catch it after it hit his chest making a wet splat against his skin. Cas blushed as the warm water made his skin tingle slightly. Cas swallowed the lump that formed in his throat, then he moved and helped Dean start washing the car. After the whole car was covered in soap, and Cas was to because Dean kept flinging the soapy water at him. Cas then helped Dean rinse of the impala, and let her dry some before buffing the wax in.
Cas started speeding up, the lazy thrust no longer satisfying him and he pulled his hand away from Dean’s to work itself between them and took Dean’s cock in his hand, again using grace to coat his hand in lube and started rubbing Dean’s cock in time with his thrusts.
Cas gasped gently before he was now feeling impatient, using his grace to rid Dean of the rest of his clothes and picking the man up using his grace to do so with ease.
Dean frowned some, not wanting to bring up the Fall but he didn’t trust the snarky and overly annoying angel, “Metatron? Cas are you sure? I mean… he isn’t exactly trustworthy.”
It took nearly 2 hours for Dean to close and bandage all the cuts. Dean slowly and carefully removed the rag from Cas’ mouth before gently runnings his fingers through Cas’ sweat-soaked hair. Sam watched his brother from his bed and smiled sadly, he knew Dean hated himself for having to hurt Cas. Sam got up and grabbed another rag and got wet with cold water, squeezing most of the water out before coming out and handing it to Dean. Dean carefully laid the cold rag on Cas’ forehead, Dean stroked his hair gently and watched him sleeping, the tenseness was still there but had gone down quite a bit. Dean slept but only in hour increments, constantly waking up to check on Cas.
“Well, this is your lucky day. I should be able to fix that for you if we can find the proper parts.”
In fact, it would still be a few months after that--the night of their high school graduation--before anything changed between them. It was a keg party in the woods and while Cas was never much one for drinking, he’d fucking done it: finished high school. According to all the stupid songs and movies, these were supposed to be the best years of his life, but here he was drinking from a red solo cup and watching Dean with a pretty girl in a tank top on his lap. The mixed emotions churned with the too-foamy beer and eventually he’d wandered deeper into the woods to sit on a fallen log and let his stomach settle. He only vaguely registered someone approaching, but when he felt that hand on his shoulder, he knew like he knew his own name that it was Dean.
“I know. But it’s something I want you to know.” There’s no other way to do this than to go straight through. He takes a deep breath, then stops again because how do you tell someone this story? “This is kind of a chicken and egg situation.” He sees a flicker of confusion in her eyes and honestly, he’s starting to confuse himself a little bit. Cas, on the other hand, stays still and quiet beside him, not trying to clarify or ease the way and that silent vote of confidence gives Dean what he needs to keep going. “It turns out that when I was a kid, I was sexually abused by somebody.” To Jody’s credit, her expression doesn’t change. “It went on for years and it was so bad that I… I apparently developed a type of amnesia about it and only began to remember it a couple of months ago.”
Cas stopped, his razor halfway to his face. “I know that, Dean.” He said it gently and carefully, like he couldn’t believe Dean needed this reassurance.
He wakes to Kathryn standing in front of them, gently touching Cas’s arm and saying his name. “She did great,” she says with a broad smile. “We got the obstruction out and there was no other damage. We’ll keep her here for the next day or so, but she should have a full recovery.”
As promised, Billie is able to see him on Monday. Even though he’s feeling a bit better, Dean doesn’t argue when Cas says he’ll drive him, and Dean finds himself approaching her office with a combination of anticipation and dread. When Billie opens her office door right at the top of the hour as usual, Dean turns to Cas before he gets to his feet.
Retina issues, says Naomi. Visual migraines are Bobby’s diagnosis. Whatever it is, it’s driving Dean batshit. Nothing in particular seems to set them off but they’re distracting as fuck. Yeah, he fucking googled--sue him--and while retinal tears are supposed to manifest as singular flashes of light and migraine auras as shimmery patches, neither of those quite seem to fit. And even though he’s started getting sharp, sudden headaches, they aren’t related to the vision stuff.
“Dean,” Cas says, putting a hand on Dean’s wrist. “I’m going to kiss you now to stop you from talking.”
It’s all good, he reminds himself. He and Lisa remain friends, both of them realizing they’re better that way. And his brother will be home for Christmas, just a few short months from now. He’ll be graduating in the spring, so maybe there’s a chance he’ll choose a law school that doesn’t require Dean to give up two days of his life driving or multiple years off his life by getting on a plane.
. He pictures Cas sitting in the front, pictures the adorable way he frowns at his computer screen while he runs a hand through his hair and re-reads what he’s just written. Dean has to stop whistling for a moment to grin at the mental image. From the moment he first laid eyes on the guy he was intrigued. And now, he’s earned himself the chance to get to know him in a whole new way. A way that feels consciously layered on top of the foundation they’ve already built. A way that feels like a logical next step.
“Oh shit,” Charlie said when she saw where Cas was looking. The whole group had been filled in when Cas sat down. “You ok, Cas?”
Kevin raises his eyebrows. “Everything good?” Many a time Dean has been the last one standing (staggering) trying to convince the gang to keep partying.
While Eileen gives Henry’s dinner input the seal of approval and flags down their server to bring his dessert, Sam changes the subject. “So, how’s the house hunt going?”
Dean lets his head fall back and makes an unintelligible noise of agreement. Cas knows him inside and out and could probably tell him precisely how many strokes it would take to get him off at this point, and hey, that would be a fun game.
He fixes himself some toast—again pushing away thoughts of Dean and the toaster oven debacle. There’s only so much he can deal with right now and he needs to focus on Lady Marmalade and making sure he’s able to care for her. He feels marginally better after eating, and while he needs to call his brother and fill him in, he puts it off a little longer so that he can shower first.
He splits his time between the two locations, and even if his nails mostly stay clean, there’s never any shortage of things for him to do. Still, he can’t deny being the boss makes it easy on a day like today when he’s got to leave mid-afternoon for his dentist appointment.
Cas made a small whimpering sound just as Dean looked over and caught his eye, smiling. Cas smiled back and pulled Charlie a little closer.
“Negative self talk can be like piling guilt and obligation on top of what your abuser did to you. If it helps to think of your nephew in order to find that kindness for yourself, that can be both a start and a reminder.”
done this before, mainly in groups but still. It’s encouraging to think he has a little bit more experience in this particular area. That, on top of knowing Drake isn’t mad, that he wants to keep talking despite Cas having taken that big step back, it leaves him almost giddy.
Cas sighs. “I don’t think I could’ve been more obvious if I’d hit him over the head with a sign that said
“Come on in. Let me put this away and finish getting ready.” She follows him into the kitchen. “Did you want some coffee or anything?”
There’s a long moment when both of them look at him wide-eyed, and then Cas is laughing. “I’m kidding. My mom is cool, I swear.”
Linda Tran is half Dean’s size and twice as scary. She was Cas’s doctor first and took Dean on as a patient when they got married as part of the whole
Dean tries to keep any hint of bitterness out of his voice. “I’m the son.” He spends a moment looking over the small waiting area, like he’s still considering, like he hadn’t made his decision the moment he laid eyes on Cas. “Uh,” he begins, in his best indecisive voice. “I think that shouldn’t be a problem? We don’t get a ton of customers hanging around in here but if we did start to fill up--”
Together, with Dean feeding her, they finish both plates of toast. When the food is gone, she licks the last crumbs from the plates, then nudges against Dean’s hand. “That’s all there is.” He reaches out cautiously, petting the top of her head. She leans into the touch and, emboldened, Dean scritches her like he’d seen Cas do last night. Her skin is warm under the short, bristly fur and she seems to like it when he scratches around the base of her small horns. Dean sits for a long while, watching as the day begins around him, sitting peacefully as the birds flit from branch to branch and the sun moves higher in the sky.
“It’s a school night,” Eileen points out, but the look she exchanges with Sam tells Dean it’s happening. “Ask your uncles if they want to come, too.”
Afterwards, he’d slipped outside, away from the reception where people chatted and ate cookies like it was a goddamn party. He’d barely gotten in a few lungfuls of cold air when Dean appeared, holding out Cas’s coat.
From there, Dean can explore, kissing and licking across Cas’s chest, with his arms wrapped around Cas’s waist to keep him in place. He listens for Cas’s breathy gasps as he tends to each nipple in turn, alternating between a quick, sharp nip with his teeth and long slow strokes of his tongue. Cas threads his hands in Dean’s hair, pulling him closer. He uses one hand to knead at the back of Dean’s neck, and Dean finds himself closing his eyes, nuzzling his face against Cas’s chest and letting Cas hold him close. After a few moments of that, Dean lets his hands drift downward, dipping into the waistband of Cas’s jeans before sliding lower to cup the swell of his ass. He kisses lower as well, letting his tongue circle and dip into his navel, which leads Cas to yank sharply at his hair as he squirms and gasps. Dean works a hand between them, stroking over the bulge in the front of Cas’s jeans, kissing along the dark trail of hair until he’s nosing at the button of his jeans. He’s wondering if he could get the button undone with his teeth, when Cas takes a step back and starts to take them off himself. Dean hurries to follow suit.
At first Chuck simply stood quietly at John’s side, but as John began his running commentary again, Cas saw his father lean in and speak quietly to John, who listened stone-faced. Cas could feel an air of expectation hanging over the crowd as they waited for the next outburst. When it came, Chuck calmly rested a hand on John’s shoulder, but John yanked away, turning to face him, eyes blazing. For a tense moment, Cas thought John would shove his father and he took a step forward, but Charlie grabbed his arm.
Cas felt everything inside him go cold as he tried to make Dean understand. “It’s not that I don’t want to. I want to. I’ve wanted to forever. It’s just...I want it to be right for both of us—”
“I definitely feel something,” Cas says. He takes a drink of his wine, keeping the glass pressed to his lips for longer than necessary. He chances a look around, scanning the crowd, but nearly everyone seems as enraptured as Balthazar. Maybe he’s just too uneducated to appreciate it, he thinks, and he looks again. Literally all he sees is tiny dots. It couldn’t have taken the artist more than five minutes to make each piece.
He thinks that looks pretty good, but he’s reading over it to be sure when one of his co-workers enters the breakroom. In a hurry to put his phone away, Dean manages to hit send. “Shit,” he hisses.
Cas stops. He hadn’t actually considered the fact that this person could be nearby, an oversight that now seems ridiculous. Whoever feels so strongly about the theater must have lived here, if not currently then at some point in the past. And SavetheDrake is apparently a local.
So why is he laying it on so thick with Cas? Maybe it’s the uniform. Dean’s only human, and it seems impossible to be immune to the way Cas looks in that crisp, form-fitting outfit. Or maybe it’s the air of authority Cas exudes while he’s wearing it that makes him a natural target for Dean’s needling. From the moment Dean met him, emerging out of  the darkness to lecture Dean about the burn ban, Cas had proven himself to be extraordinarily rule bound. Messing with him is a game, more a harmless distraction than anything else. By this point, Dean’s pretty sure Cas isn’t going to take a swing at him just for mouthing off. Probably not, anyhow. Dean thinks back to the way Cas glares at him when he’s completely fed up. About the tight set of his spectacular jaw that indicates he’s done with whatever conversation they’ve been having. About the way his uniform pants show off his ass as he walks away.
No wonder Cas only sees him as a friend, and even that feels precarious if he’s wanting to go down this particular road. “I mean, not a lot. I’ve been in a couple of bar fights, I guess.”
Face serious, Cas scans through them, and Dean can’t help the tiny smile that crosses his face. He has no doubt that Cas will learn everything Dr. Tran suggested, probably even trying them out himself. “This is good,” he says, still reading. “We can do this.” He looks up. “Did she say why it started?”
He’ll have to work a little harder at meeting people when he gets back home. Maybe he’ll sign up for one of those dating apps or something. It might take some time but the whole point is that there are plenty of fish in the sea. Here? Here there’s barely a puddle to dip his toe into.
“Hey,” Dean said, just as Cas moved his hand, dragging it across Dean’s stomach before lifting it to rub his eyes. As Cas’s hand moved, Dean suddenly had a flash of the night before, his lips moving against Cas’s. “I’ll just…” He scrambled to get up and ended up inadvertently digging an elbow into Cas’s (extremely firm) thigh. “Sorry,” he added, even as he tripped over his own feet in his haste to get away. “I’m gonna shower,” he yelled from the bathroom door.
It’s not the response John was hoping for, if the muscle twitching in his jaw is any indicator. “Why here?”
“It’s just…” Dean didn’t know what it was exactly. Something about the way Balthazar seemed equally comfortable being seen with women or men irritated him, he was just so
Dean’s nervous in the time leading up to when Jody is set to arrive. The nice thing about being home for the better part of a week is that, at a certain level, he’s been able to pretend that none of this happened. As he begins to interact with other people, though, he can’t avoid thinking about the fact that everyone driving by the garage saw his battered shell of a car. And even if it wasn’t out there for long, his employees know exactly what Dean had done even if they don’t know why. That afternoon, when he realizes he needs to start thinking about it, he asks Cas who he told about the car. Cas explains that he’d called Charlie that night and told her Dean had been upset about some bad news he’d recently received. He looks away almost shyly as he tells Dean, saying he wasn’t sure what to tell her, especially since at the time he’d thought Dean was reacting to their fight. Dean doesn’t give the flicker of guilt he feels at that the space to take hold, instead he kisses Cas and thanks him for handling it.
“Hang on.” She takes out her phone and dashes off a quick text. “Okay, dinner handled. Now, tell me everything.”
“It’s all a matter of perspective, I guess. Where we grow, what surrounds us. That all ties into how we’re valued.”
, who had an inkling as to what was going on at the time could be their strongest path forward. Toward that end, Dean has come up with an idea.
Cas walked around turning on lights as he checked the different rooms. “I know it's not much,” he said, “but a little trip away without a case seemed long overdue.”
to have them come back. Not that anyone can ever be completely ready, not for something like that, but they can be surrounded by love. They can have a husband who is there for them unconditionally and with a breathtaking combination of tenderness and unbelievable strength. They can have a younger brother who continues to look up to them, even when their roles should clearly be reversed. They can have a sister-in-law who jumped into the family with both feet and a heart so big that there was no escaping being drawn into her orbit. They can have an uncle that taught them more about being a man in silent, selfless moments than any lecture ever could. They can have a nephew who shows them what a child should be, one who has been cherished since the day he was born, one whose very existence is a miracle.” Henry looks like he can’t decide whether to smile or roll his eyes and Dean can’t help giving him a quick wink as he addresses him directly. “You showed me exactly what a child should get from a parent, you inspired intense feelings of protection and love simply by existing. As all children should.”
Dean looks between them, his expression almost blank. “I’m--” he stops and clears his throat. “I’m gonna get back to work.”
“What I’d really like to do,” Cas says almost wistfully, “is tell you what to do and have you do it for me.”
Dean takes a step backwards and looks down to find a small sandy-haired boy hugging Cas around the legs.
By the time he gets to the bar, Sam is already there with Jo and Ash and Kevin, and he pours Dean a beer from the pitcher on the table. They shift around to make room for him and he slides in next to Kevin. Immediately they all raise their glasses for a toast. “What’s the occasion?”
“Yours. Always yours.” He’d met Meg in college, well, more precisely, she’d found him sitting in the same place in the library four days in a row. On the fifth day, she’d simply pulled out the chair across from him. He looked up from his Econ textbook, stunned, ready to apologize because obviously she’d reserved this table or something. There was no reason for her to invade his personal space otherwise.
Dean smooths his own hair as he tries to explain. “You know how I have a habit of overthinking things?”
Apparently that’s more than Ellen can abide. “He should’ve been on his knees begging for your forgiveness, dumping everything on you like that.”
Cas climbs the stairs two at time, catching him just outside their bedroom door.  He takes Dean by the arm. “What the hell was that all about?”
There are rough spots where the panties have dried and he tries to reposition his junk as subtly as he can before rejoining the party.
“I’m--I’m not--” Cas sputters. He definitely is. Because if Dean likes him that means there’s a chance he could stop liking him and Cas can’t even think about that. Easier to rationalize away all the other evidence instead.
“Okay,” she says when they meet for coffee near her apartment. “Tell me the whole thing one more time.”
Dean honestly can’t believe his luck that weekend when he wakes on a Saturday morning to find he’s slept straight through the night, not waking until the bright summer sun is climbing in the sky. He’s actually a little groggy from so much uninterrupted sleep, but it’s so nice to wake slowly—no alarm, no gasping awake from nightmares—that he’s not complaining. He lies in bed, warm and relaxed, listening to the sounds of Cas moving around downstairs before stretching luxuriously. Finally, he tosses back the covers and pads to the bathroom.
“I don’t owe you anything,” Dean hisses, pressing his forehead to the wall and turning his face away.
It’s a lot of piecing things together, but somehow it works. Every time he decides he hates writing, that it’s fruitless and pointless and isolating and he misses shaping young people’s minds, he does a few substitute teaching gigs and finds he can’t wait to get back to the solitude of sitting quietly with his own thoughts. Lather, rinse, repeat.
“You were warned, Dean,” he growls and before Dean can react, he’s got both of Dean’s hands above his head.  Dean can’t do anything but grind upwards taking advantage of Cas’s momentary distraction while he uses the scarf to to tie Dean to the newel post at the top of the flight of stairs.  With his hands tied, Cas can only push the jacket off of Dean’s shoulders and shove up his shirt.  He wedges a thigh between Dean’s legs and Dean nearly yelps at the sudden contact.
Cas presses one finger in, moving it slowly in and out as Dean adjusts to it.  “Tell me when you’re ready for another.”
“Well, traditionally they symbolize fascination, devotion, and love. That’s why you see them used a lot as boutonnieres. But these days they tend to mean cheap, hardy, and easy to purchase in bulk.” He takes a step back as three little girls come running over to admire the display.
When Cas is down to his t-shirt and underwear, he stops to appraise Dean. “I should just leave you there and go shower.”
“When we lived with my brother, she had zero interest in him. In fact, the more he tried to befriend her, the more aloof she became.”
“Cas,” Dean pleads, as Cas begins to get him ready, but he’s not even sure what he’s asking for at this point. He feels so good knowing he can rile Cas up like this, that he can drive him to this place of taking what he wants from Dean, who would give him everything. The life they have here in Linden may be simple but it isn’t always easy. They’ve had ups and downs, they’ve had fights and compromises. It’s an ongoing process, but Dean has learned to stop hiding behind jokes and bravado and Cas has learned to stop carrying the world on his shoulders. In growing their relationship, they’ve found a sweet spot, where the freedom of one to be vulnerable reveals the strength and caring of the other. Sometimes it’s Dean fixing Cas a drink after work and sending him to soak away the frustrations of his day in the tub. Sometimes it’s Cas sitting by his side in the Impala, letting Dean drive fast, blasting his music until he’s ready to talk about his latest conversation with Sam.
“Well,” Dean says. “Turns out you don’t know me that well.” As he pulls into the parking lot, Cas opens his mouth to say something more, but Dean cuts him off. “Thanks again, man. You went above and beyond last night. I appreciate it.”
Cas knows exactly how he wishes his family treated him, he knows down to the words he puts in the mouths of his character's parents. Words of support, of genuine concern and caring. He knew people in college who talked to their mothers every day. Because they
He double checks that her water and food are still in good shape and then retrieves the groceries, coming back inside as quietly as he can. In the kitchen, he starts to relax for the first time in hours. Here, closed up in the house against the now-howling wind, with Cas safely in his care, Dean thinks he might actually be able to focus, and he sets to making soup.
“Uh,” he’d said, a little blindsided. “I’ll try.” It makes no sense that he’s hedging. He’s literally been talking about this topic for weeks. But something about seeing the big letters at the top of the notice have him taken aback. There, in bold type, it reads:
He shuts the blinds in his bedroom, blocking out every trace of the sun, and climbs into bed. He lies on his side, curled into himself, numbly letting the hours pass. He’s ruined everything.
Dean grins, even though he’s starting to shake a little bit as the adrenaline leaves his system. “Sam seems to think I was highly believable, but honestly it wasn’t that hard to be pissed off. The whole thing is bullshit.”
“Fair point,” Cas concedes as they start to reposition chairs around the table. “You on the prowl again?”
“Amazing,” Dean says, still boneless. Another few moments pass before he says. “Only now we’re soaking in my jizz and that’s disgusting.”
Naomi smiles gently at the sight. “Dean came by and offered to do the ones Anna and I couldn’t reach.”
When the lead counselor blows a whistle, the entire room falls into something almost resembling quiet, everyone rife with anticipation as they wait for her go-ahead to line up for the bus. The chaos swells after that, the kids’ volume increasing with excitement as parents give last minute reminders and make sure they have all their luggage. Henry hugs them all in turn, his face solemn.
The relief on her face is clear. “Oh, that’s a good idea. Makes sense.” She’s nodding too many times and Dean knows he’s making her nervous.
Even back in the quiet of his own apartment, the headache doesn’t ease. He finds himself getting more and more pissed at his brother for blowing off his conversation. Jesus, Sam’s always trying to get him to have chick flick moments and then when Dean tries to talk, he’s climbing over him like he can’t get away fast enough.
“So, tell me what happened.” He doesn’t know the first thing about cats and their health but it seems like the right question to ask. If nothing else, he’s watched enough Dr. Sexy to know that calming down a person in distress is always a good first step.
“It can be, for sure. Which is why having a few more people to talk to can help to spread that around.”
Dean thinks back and tries to put it into words. “I was startled by the sirens and I think that was enough to set off my fight or flight response. My hands did that weird tingling thing and my vision kinda started to tunnel.”
He does, starting with the frantic phone call. He tells her how sick Lady Marmalade was and how it took the both of them to catch her and rush her to the vet. He touches on how upset Cas was, but he doesn’t tell her all the things he said, about how the cat helped him through his darkest days because that’s not his story to tell. But he explains how he left and came back, and how he sat beside Cas all night as they waited. “When the doctor came out and told us she was going to be okay, he got this look on his face. It was like the weight of the world had been taken off his shoulders, you know?” She nods. “And it made me so happy to see that and I don’t know what I was thinking but I just…leaned in and kissed him.”
Billie turns to him, eyebrows arched like she wants to explore that some more, but he winks at her and she continues. “While the stress may not be equal on both partners, it’s real and it’s valid.”
They’ve taken to exploring the city together. Sometimes Dean takes Cas to crowded bars where he can buy him drinks and press up against him in dark corners, before taking him home to the familiar comfort of their bed. Sometimes Cas takes him to restaurants he never would have tried, and they’ve learned that often the more a place looks like a dump, the better the food. Dean tries new things, some he likes, some he doesn’t, and Cas merely nods and files the info away to help in choosing the next place.
“I am. The people in my building are nice and there’s a coffee shop on the ground floor where I do a lot of writing.”
Dean looks around. He’s right, there’s no dining table, but he spots the desk chair over in the corner. “That’s a chair.”
“I’m okay,” Dean insists. He feels a little shaky, but things are settling again, like he’s locked everything back into place. “I’ve got that appointment next week.”
. He gets that, he does, but how can his well-being progress if he’s letting someone else suffer while he indulges himself?
Dean can’t help it. He’s fucking whistling while he works like one of Snow White’s goddamn dwarves. He can’t believe how well their talk went. Cas seemed totally on board with Dean’s suggestion they take it to the next level. Okay,
Dean has learned what Cas likes, and his hands glide the length of his back, reaching to cup his ass and pull him even closer. Cas never tires of feeling so desired, thrilling at the way Dean digs his fingers in like he never wants to let him go. He trails kisses along Cas’s jaw and down his throat, tongue darting over the pulse point there, stubble scratching sensitive skin. In return, Cas works a hand between them to find Dean’s nipple, thumbing over it until Dean is gasping, open-mouthed against Cas’s neck.
“Have a good one,” Cas says, even though it sounds like the most inane thing he’s ever uttered. Maybe Dean thinks so too because he gets something that could almost be construed as a smile, just the quickest uptick of one side of his mouth, before he turns away and steps through the door into the garage.
Charlie gives him a whole fifteen minutes to get settled in his office before she comes to see him, and honestly, he’s impressed with her restraint.
They lay their loads down in Dean’s office and Cas turns to go back to the car, but Charlie smacks him on the arm. “None of that,” she says firmly.
“That’s a look, alright,” Dean says, green eyes sparkling with mischief. “Not often you see the no shirt/suspenders combo.”
From the bedside table drawer, he pulls out a bottle of lube and a sanitizing wipe. He gives the new toy a thorough cleaning before dropping it on the bed. Dean waits, bare skin warm and inviting, and Cas takes a moment to run a hand along his back.
you can’t deny that it’s ultimately a factual distinction. Maybe not practical, but the truth of it exists. Either you’re a farmer or you’re not.
Cas wiped his face with a damp cloth and uncuffed him, directing him to the bed where Dean foolishly assumed
“Yeah,” Dean says, a little breathless as the mental image floods back in. This one is less scary, but he remembers it with a sense memory nearly equal in intensity to the abuse. The cold night air, the dark shadows stretching across the yard from the shop light in the garage. The uneven feel of the pavers that made a makeshift path back toward the house.
As usual, it doesn’t faze him, and his only response is to lean over and kiss Dean good morning. “How are you feeling?”
The shampoo smells like lemon and lavender, fresh scents that revive and relax all at once. Cas is nearly lost in the meditative work of his fingers, admiring the long line of Dean’s neck. Eyes closed, Dean’s expression is serene, and Cas revels in being trusted with every part of him.
It makes Dean’s heart sink a little, but Cas quickly changes the subject, talking to him about what books he should be bringing home the next time Henry comes over. With Henry distracted, Eileen steps over to Dean. “How’re you doing?”
He walks right up to Cas, close enough to kiss him as he hands him his drink. This close, Dean can see that Cas has retrieved something else along with his sunglasses. He’s holding the leather wristband they use for scenes out in public.
Dean huffed. “You know what I mean.” He turned to Cas, eyes wide with excitement. “If we had a really long rope, we could use the bucket to send messages back and forth from your room to the tree.”
He goes through the entire story, from Lady Marmalade being off her feed, to the crisis, to rushing her to the vet. Gabe listens attentively, reacting in a way that reinforces that fact that this
Cas had a flash to when they were kids, getting changed at sleepovers. They’d gone from not caring to carefully angling away from each other, eyes mostly averted as they got dressed. Now, Cas stood at the edge of the bed, peeling off his clothes, letting Dean have a full, unobstructed view. Dean stared, his eyes raking over him with an intensity Cas could almost feel. Belatedly, Dean realized he was still wearing a t-shirt and he flopped ungracefully to get it off.
Getting to his feet, Dean stacks their breakfast dishes while Cas picks up the remote to switch off the television that’s been tuned to the local news. “Sounds good. I can go any afternoon except Wednesday.”
Cas picked up the empty plates and took them to the sink to give himself something to do. “It was weird of me to just show up here, I know it was. I apologize for that.”
The evening is pleasant enough. It’s good to be together and the food, as always, is delicious. Dean drinks his stupid lemonade and tries to enjoy himself. Cas checks in on him more than he usually would, offering to refill his plate, dropping a kiss on the top of his head when he comes back with it. Sam’s eyes dart to him frequently and something about it has Dean gritting his teeth. He’s thankful for the distraction of Henry who can scarcely wait for it to get dark. Dean takes him into the yard and lights sparklers for him while the sun is still visible in the sky.
“Ugh,” he says. “Every morning.” Still, he doesn’t get up, leaving her with no choice but to employ her secret weapon. She takes a few firmly planted steps before stopping to knead her paws. “Bladder!” he yells, pushing her out of the way so he can sit up. “You’re the worst.”
Each night since Cas has been gone, Dean lies in bed and turns his name around and around in his mind, like a rock in a tumbler, smoothing all sides of it with his thoughts. It’s not praying, not quite, the intention isn’t there, but if Cas can still sense his longing, well, he's got that in spades. Cas gave his life for Dean, professing his love in a way that couldn’t have been more clear and Dean…he just stood there processing it all.
“I get that,” Dean says. “Like Oliver said, fixing cars is cool but it’s such a small part of what I do each day. Somehow ordering parts and dealing with payroll doesn’t quite hold the same appeal.”
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Cas said, but he picked up one of the factory made ones so Dean could compare.
Back outside, he stands for one long moment, poised and silhouetted in the darkness. And then he swings the tire iron. The windshield cracks but that’s not good enough. He swings again and again until it’s in pieces, broken glass glinting against the leather seat. His breath is coming hard and fast now and he takes a moment to knock off the driver’s side mirror as he begins to move around the car, taking aim at whatever feels right. The shatter of glass, the thud of thick dents in metal, the crack of plastic as he takes out a tail light. He doesn’t even realize he’s screaming, a raw gutteral noise that comes from somewhere newly uncovered deep inside of him.
Dean’s a little rattled all day wondering what the fuck is going on, but the way Donna has talked leaves him pretty sure he needs to keep things close to the vest. Still, when he’s home again after work, he calls his brother.
Bobby holds up his phone. “Just wondering why your daddy left me a message saying he was leaving town and you were--and I quote--my ‘problem now’.”
“Okay, sweet girl,” he says as he enters the cluttered room. “This is our new home and—” he stops abruptly at seeing the carrier door standing open. ”Lady?”
Dean thinks back to the way Cas went from guarded to open, not blaming Dean for what happened, and even making a joke. He shakes his head. “He’s been through a lot in the past and he’s good at, like, setting boundaries, I guess? Taking care of himself when he needs to.” There’s a flash where he wonders if Cas has gone back to therapy and if so, whether he’s talked about Dean.
“She marched me right back over there to apologize. Luckily, the neighbor thought it was funny and the lady showed me how to cut them properly. We left with a bouquet of tulips and daffodils.” There’s a long pause as Dean lifts his hand from the vase, then clenches his fingers into a fist. “She died later that year.”
“The guy is kind of a disaster,” Dean tells Rowena. “I think this is his first time living on his own and he’s got to be almost as old as I am.”
“But nothing,” Benny said, popping open the lid and removing the foil covering. “Let us give you your present.”
Great. If Dean had managed to use his phone like a normal person, he could’ve kept it out during his lunch and responded in a timely way. Now that response has been sitting there for over an hour. He puts his phone away again. No point in responding now, when he’s already feeling rushed and off-kilter. Besides, Chrysler said it was fine, and he’ll choose to believe that.
Dean promptly pushes back his chair and picks up the dirty dishes.  When he’s behind Anna, he turns and catches Cas’s eye.  “You’re cut off,” he mouths before taking his red face into the kitchen.
Dean pulls out of his grip and tries to keep his voice from rising. “It’s not, Sam. It’s not okay.” Maybe his brother thinks he can always find it in him to forgive Dean for all the trouble he keeps bringing into their lives, but there’s no coming back from this. Not if he’s put Henry at risk.
Dean never breaks eye contact, squeezing Cas’s hands tightly. “I was so proud of you for getting out of here. Still am. I wouldn’t ask you to come back and sneak around with me like we’ve been doing.” He takes in a deep breath. “If you really mean it, I think I’m ready to try something new.”
Dean glares daggers at him and struggles against the scarf.  Cas raises one eyebrow and Dean stills.
Cas turns to look at Georgina. Georgina turns to look at Cas. “He’s a little slow, but he got there.”
It should have been enough to send Dean running in the other direction, but there he was, a gentle hand between Cas’s shoulders, speaking soft, soothing words from those lips that had just kissed Cas.
That leads Dean into a description of her stalking a fly around his apartment, yowling at it with this strange chattering sound. He’s still mid-story when Sam and Eileen appear.
Dean swallowed the blood and bile rising in his throat. The dragon was here… for him? To… to raise him from perdition? What the fuck did that mean? He was pretty sure ‘perdition’ meant ‘Hell’, but that would mean… That would mean…
“Uh, I don’t really know, hold on,” Dean said, frowning as he tried to remember. “I think I need… paprika. And garlic powder.”
The days during the height of his cycle were sort of a messy blur, but Dean remembered only the softness of his nest and the warmth of Castiel’s smile. The Alpha had remained a steady and comforting presence throughout Dean’s heat, and Dean remembered jacking off to the memory of his rumbling voice many times. It was probably something he would take to his grave, but he couldn’t deny that his orgasms always felt better when he had the image of Castiel in his head. He didn’t even feel that ashamed about it.
At the same time as he thought that, he felt a little guilty. It was almost like he was keeping a secret from his friend, or something. Like he was lying to Dean somehow. Did Dean need to know that sometime during the night they’d started cuddling? Was it worth telling him, especially now that Castiel had already committed to pretending like it hadn’t happened?
to say it! Whatever it took to return Dean to his snarky, annoying, frustrating, fiery self. This broken shell was terrifying.
The ghost on Dean’s bookshelf sighed, rubbing at his non-existent temples. He didn’t even want to try to imagine the scientific possibilities behind a ghost having a headache. At this point, the stupidity of the two boys he was sharing an apartment with transcended all known rules of science.
Castiel’s sweatshirt. The college logo was a simple design burned into the fabric. It was the only part of the hoodie that wasn’t fleecy and soft. Dean’s cheek and the corner of his eye scraped against it, bringing his flailing attention back into focus.
For a week and a half, Dean woke up at four in the morning and worked a shift at the diner, then went to school in the afternoon. After that, he worked another shift at the diner and then went home to study and finish his homework. By then, it was typically close to midnight, so he passed out in his bed and woke up to do it all over again.
Alastair grinned at Dean. “Soon as we gut your Alpha and his friends, we can come back and have some fun,” he promised.
After that, Dean distracted himself with finding the perfect balance between cheering for his team and saving his breath. Castiel gave them a half a second lead on the other team, which Benny promptly fucked because his goggles completely came off during his start. The blond senior managed to finish second after the opposing team in lane three, but he’d given them at least a three second lead.
shape, and it had been a while since he’d flown so far and so fast. The oxygen intake slits on the sides of his neck and the ridge of his chest were flared wide, capturing as much of the rushing mountain air as they could to make sure Castiel got enough oxygen to his muscles.
“I’m sorry too,” Castiel replied, wrapping his arms tight around his trembling Alpha. He squeezed his eyes shut, wondering when Dean had become so thin. He needed to pay some more attention, it seemed. Castiel's heart squeezed at the memory of Dean shouting that he was never around anymore. “Why aren’t you in the nest?”
“I’m ready,” Dean replied. His voice was firm and confident. Unwavering. The voice of a king. “Let’s go kick some dragon ass.”
Castiel sighed, nudging Lincoln around a large pothole in the dirt road. “I told Missouri he will likely bring four or five dragons to support him. It’s the most he would feasibly allow in a situation where he will be very vulnerable.”
He knew why. The person who usually kept him sane had just walked out the front door of their apartment.
Castiel pushed in two more fingers when Dean’s hand slipped free, making up for the fingers lost. The hand Dean had been busy with went out to the side to grip the sheets, his still-lubed fingers glistening slightly.
Dean laughed. “What, do I have a choice, after I let you fuck my brains out?” He waggled his eyebrows.
“How long do you have until your heat?” Castiel asked. His hand was still on Dean’s knee, warm even through the fabric of his thick black gloves and Dean’s work uniform.
He opened his eyes, disoriented and confused for several long moments. He sat up, groaning at the aches and pains in his body, and breathed in a faint drift of Castiel’s scent from the hoodie he was wearing. Dean looked down at himself in bed, and everything from yesterday came rushing back.
Dean wasn’t playing fair as he ran his fingers over the meatier flesh of the joint on Cas; left-wing making Cas stumble over his words. After a moment he pulled away and put the sketchbook on the side table and decided to play with Cas’ wings.
Cas watches Dean move, feeling hypnotized as Dean pleasured himself, his hands moving slowly but also with a sense of urgency. Cas could feel Dean’s desire, his silent prayers for the angel, Cas wasn’t sure if Dean even realized the thoughts and feelings he was broadcasting.
This time Cas didn’t hesitate to return Dean’s kiss, closing his eyes as Dean moved his hands and cupped the angel’s face. Dean pulled away once more, but still cupping Cas’ face in his hands and softly speaking, “I love you too.”
“There is a Burlington Coat Factory right over there,” Dean pointed to the store across from the hall they were standing in, “Try there first, if you can’t find any feel free to ask someone for help. If they don’t have any just call me okay?”
Cas smiled and cupped Dean’s cheek, “You told me you wished for me to show you my wings while we were having intercourse so…”
Gabriel snapped his fingers, the fantasy world disappear and he was in a motel room sitting in a chair. "Dad wanted to stay in hiding and you were looking for him. Father is on Earth, he is just hiding. It took him a while to rebuild me because of how powerful I am..."
Dean shook his head, he wished he could let Sam do it, it wasn’t that Dean was better at the sutures because Sam was just as good, Dean had taught him. Honestly, Dean couldn’t name a reason as to why he needed to do this he just knew he did. “No… I need to Sammy…”
Dean nodded and carefully sat up, getting out of the bed and helping Cas up. They stripped each other before making their way into the small bathroom, it would take some maneuvering but neither man would mind being so close to the other. Once the water was warmed up Dean climbed in first, relaxing under the spray as the blood, grime and dirt were washed away, Cas got in behind him, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist pulling him closer. They helped each other get washed off, then get dressed again and they were both so exhausted they fell asleep within minutes.
Gabe softly nodded, “You are welcome Dean if he looks worse or you can’t get his temperature down, or they start bleeding just pray to me alright.”
Dean moved to kiss Cas lightly, then cupped the angel’s face in his hands, “Hey… come on it’s my birthday. I lived a whole nother year Angel,”
Cas laughed softly, pulling Dean close and kissing him then gently whispering, “It is okay to enjoy other music Dean,”
Dean blushed deeply before slowly handing Cas the book, “In high school, I started drawing, and… I used pictures of Mom… and some by my memory…”
Sam nodded, he was worried about Dean too but he knew Cas was struggling to think about anything good, their lives had sucked so it was only fair for him to think that things wouldn’t turn out well. Sam needed to think positive though because of he. Ouldn’t go down that road, but after the hell, they all went through he was sure that Dean and Cas finally being together was some good they both deserved. “I know Cas… but they are helping him, it is going to be fine.”
Within a single breath, Castiel was back in the dungeon and found himself standing in front of Dean, who was still on the floor but now with his head between his knees openly sobbing.
Dean then realized a third thing, and there were tears streaming down his face, shakily he wiped his eyes and gave Cas a warm smile, “I love you so much Castiel.”
Cas chuckled heartily, shaking his head and assisting Dean with standing and he started to lead him back inside for the party that their small family was going to consist of. Dean paused though and turned back to look at the wooden cross, took a deep breath and softly spoke, “Love you, Charlie…”
Cas watched Dean, who was obviously in a lot of pain and he felt bad for his human. A human body was not used to experiencing an angel’s heat and Cas was not sure how it would affect him. Cas gently used his grace to make their clothes disappear, remembering enough about an angel in heat to know what Dean needed right now. Dean relaxed minutely at the feeling of cold air against his hot skin.
Dean relaxed as Cas rubbed his back, he knew what the angel was doing; they had talked about it in great length and detail. Dean was aging, his health was frankly crap despite Cas’ attempts to heal him, it tended to be like putting a Band-Aid on things, but some of those things were too impossible to fix completely. Dean knew how hard it was for Cas to watch Dean aging, he remembered their fight after the turkey bacon switch, that had been over something so simple, but it had been such a bad fight. Dean got pissed at Cas, telling him turkey bacon was disgusting and he refused to eat it. Cas had scolded him, told him if he wanted to eat bacon that was the only way. Dean had refused and gone out and bought some real bacon and ate the whole pack by himself. Dean had never seen the angel that upset before, and after screaming at Dean that he was a selfish bastard, Cas had gotten some of his things and slept in his room. Cas had been stubborn after that fight, he didn’t talk to Dean for a couple of days after that, well he hadn’t spoken to anyone after that, the angel had locked himself in his room. Cas didn’t finally speak with him until four days later, and the angel had been a wreck, explaining to Dean how hard it was for him to see Dean growing old. Cas had said to Dean that he was trying to help Dean live longer, and after seeing the absolute pain on his angels face Dean finally relented and agreed, apologizing profusely for how much of an ass he had been. Another hard part was that once Dean died, he wasn’t going to Heaven, Dean’s soul was going to become a part of Castiel’s grace. Dean carefully turned some and spoke, “Hey… I am still here Cas, okay. I am alright Angel,”
Cas silently wondered the last time Dean had slept in like this, he knew before finding the bunker Dean would only sleep around 4 hours at a time, now though he usually slept a full 6 or even 8 hours some times. If they were on a hunt he could easily only get 4 and be fine. Now though Dean had been asleep almost 12 and a half hours, Sam had been shocked when Cas told him Dean was still very much fast asleep and he still hadn’t gotten up by the time Sam and Cas had finished everything Dean had planned to get done this morning.
Dean smiled warmly and moved to wrap his arms around Cas’ waist slowly kissing him, and along his neck. “Really? You should have asked me to join you. You would have enjoyed it then,”
This chapter has Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics in it, if you do not like those feel free to skip this chapter. It is not necessary to the story to read it.
Cas wished it was that simple, part of him wanted he could let it be at that, but he knew he couldn’t. Finally, Cas took another deep breath, “Technically Dean… I can carry a child, and it would be Nephilim… but it would be wholly our child.”
Dean stepped closer and grabbed Cas’ hip, kissing him slowly before pulling away and sitting on the other side of Cas as the angel sat down. When he looked at the plate, Cas was right, and he had made his favorite, bacon cheeseburger, he had everything but tomatoes and French fries. Cas had a cup of water there, but he also had a bottle of Dean’s favorite beer sitting there.
After cleaning the kitchen Dean was in a mood to continue cleaning and they started to clean and organize the majority of the bunker. They had started with Dean’s room after the kitchen, Dean had stripped his bed and taken the linens to the washer. Dean came back to his room to find Cas standing over the bed touching the corner of it, his hand glowing gently and his eyes were closed, “What are you doing Angel?”
Cas tried to stop him but it didn't work. Dean opened the door and then all of a sudden he dissipated like a mist and there was a voice behind him that he had not heard in years, "Hey baby birdie."
It took twenty minutes before Dean finally turned his music down to barely anything but background noise, then turning to look at Cas, and Cas could see the utter pain in Dean’s face “You… you have to find your grace Cas… I can’t… I can’t…”
Cas was in his thoughts so he hadn’t realized Dean had woken up until Dean said his name, “mmmm morning Angel…”
Alright you guys, this is almost the last one. Tomorrows will b the end technically. I will be nice and tell you it is sad, but it had to be. I think Sunday I am going to write alternate versions of the last three chapters for those of you who want Dean and Cas to have kids. And also because now the idea is kind of stuck in my head as well. I am not sure if I will have it all up Sunday but they will be there. I will post the alternate versions after their respective chapters but it will be labeled accordingly.
Dean blushed but quickly forced himself to keep his composure, “What are you talking about Sam? Am I not allowed to take my handsome ass angel boyfriend out on a fancy date?”
Dean moaned loudly and closed his eyes tightly, arching up into Cas as the angel started moving faster, he felt like he was on fire but not in a bad way, the most amazing way.
Dean ignored the unsaid words of Dean’s mortality that Castiel suggested. Dean slowly shook his head, “I just… I don’t think that’s fair to put on a kid… I mean… it wouldn’t be content to stay here forever, angel… it would want to go out and… then it would have angels and demons alike after him…” Tension started to bleed out of Cas’ shoulders as Dean came to the same agreement he had. Dean realized it, “You… you didn’t want to… why bring it up?”
Cas chewed on his lip and looked away from Dean, Dean sighed gently, if Cas wasn’t going to take his word for it, he was going to have to show him. Dean gently pressed Cas back into the bed so he was laying down, and he was just barely hovering above Cas’ body. Cas looked up at Dean, nerves suddenly forming in his stomach, “Dean… what are you doing?”
Cas let out a soft whimper, but nodded and finally let go of Dean’s shirt. Dean carefully kissed his head one more time before he finally got up, quickly pulling his boxers on before going to find Gabriel. Dean knew Gabriel usually sat up in the library so he checked there first, although he had no way of knowing that Sam had come out almost 2 hours ago to get a cup of water. Gabriel and Sam had started to talk, unfortunately for Dean, they were no longer talking and Dean got to see things of his brother and the archangel he never wanted to see. Dean yelped and covered his eyes quickly yelling, “DUDE! We eat there!!”
Cas cupped Dean’s cheek fighting his tears, “Dean… Dean come on Honeybee, stay with me. You made it for 72 years… come on, Dean… please not yet…”
Dean stopped himself from laughing but again grabbed the angel by his tie and pulled their lips together, his fingers also working to undo the angel's tie and pull it off. Dean pulled away again, smiling gently. “I want you inside of me Cas… I… I have dreamt about us… before and just… I want you inside me. I uh… I have had sex with men before… so I… I know what I am doing,”
