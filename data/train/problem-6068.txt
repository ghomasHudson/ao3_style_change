“James, huh?” Steve said once the buzzing died down.
Steve cleared his throat, making his discomfort known. Tony was too preoccupied in his leering, so Pepper spoke for him, “We wanted you to come here because we are so sorry about what happened to your apartment and personal belongings. We’d like to do whatever we can to make things right for you.”
Tony hands him a piece of multigrain bread and a banana, and Steve takes them in grateful and mildly-surprised silence. He’s supposed to be the professional here, but the inventor is the one reaching out the olive branch. “You stay up all night? I thought we were going to take turns.”
Tony doesn’t seem to mind, carrying on. “Reverted to the state. But what do I know. Maybe you sold them your soul already and you don’t have a choice.”
If Steve can literally take a fall for Tony, then Tony can do this. He can put aside his fears and do what needs to be done.
“I’m breaking you out of here in a couple of days,” Tony promises. “And... you can come home with me. If you like. Better than moping around by yourself for three weeks. I guess. I mean, you might not want the company. Or
Tony’s ass is all his.
“’Oh’? That’s the best you got? Doctor, I think you screwed him up! I want a refund!” Is it cruel to tease Steve when he’s so out of it? Maybe. Is it fun, helping to unwind his tightly-strung nerves? Yes. Very much so. He’s not taking advantage of the situation, not at all. The soldier’s grinning, isn’t he? Sure, he’s doped out of his head, but he’s happy. “This better be on warranty, Rogers.” Tony is grinning himself, reaching over for the can of ginger ale the nurse left.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, marched right on back to the big boss, huh?” Tony is goading him, though it doesn’t seem like he can help himself. They’re in the jet now, flying low over the water and approaching the island. It’s dark out, and the two of them are dressed in waterproof coveralls.
“Nope,” Steve’s ears dust fuscia, and the color reaches down his neck underneath the collar. Tony wonders how far down it goes.
Steve knows that Natasha probably could have done this alone with a bottle opener and some scotch tape. She’s a spy. He is not. Sneaking around gathering intel is not one of his strong suits, and though he’s not exactly a show-boat, running in and blowing everything up is much more to his strengths. He won’t tell that to Tony.
“Not until the battle is over,” Steve watches a small group of SHIELD agents swarm the back door, armed with stolen HYDRA weapons and racing in to clear out anyone still hiding.
Fine. He will. “Put him through,” he sighs.
“Captain,” the AI responds. Why does it feel like even the computer suspects he’s about to do something he shouldn’t?
“Okay,” Steve agrees. “Thanks.”
hurt. It doesn’t matter that everything will heal, that nothing is permanent. What matters is that Tony made a mistake, and someone else suffered for it.
“Better than those ridiculous pleated pants you showed up to the helicarrier wearing two years ago,” Tony crinkles his face. “You don’t still wear those, do you?”
Tony leans back in his chair and clasps his hands behind his head. Yes, the base was emptied and destroyed, all of its occupants either killed or taken back for questioning. That certainly counts as a success. Nobody died, either. Steve’s the only one in surgery right now. Fury doesn’t seem to give a damn. “I bet Barton could have done it,” he shrugs.
“We aren’t” Steve assures. He’s got a better idea: look for shelter. Where there’s a cliff, there are rocks, which means there might be a cave somewhere. SHIELD scans have shown there are likely to be caves around these mountains, especially with the rivers and streams cutting down from the top. There’s plenty of room for water to flow through and erode away a little shelter. Tony follows obediently as Steve wanders along the cliffside, brushing away foliage. Even if they can’t find a cave that two people can comfortably fit inside, it would be quite easy to make a shelter between the almost-vertical incline and some trees.
“Rogers-!” Fury tries again.
Iron Man isn’t built to fire guns by hand, so he picks up the fallen machine gun and hands it to the nearest SHIELD agent. Then he turns and runs toward the next HYDRA uniform in sight. “JARVIS, how many of them are there?”
Steve just wishes he could feel it. He likes his team, likes working with Barton and Romanoff, but it’s not the same. He’s lonely, and he doesn’t know how to go out and fix that. Part of him knows he’s afraid to try, and even more afraid to succeed. You can’t lose what you don’t have.
Steve smiles. “Thanks Tony. I’m gonna have a shower, I think.”
They spend a few minutes in silence, Steve keeping his hand rested on Tony’s shoulder, and Tony crying quietly into his arm until he’s sure he’s done. He gives himself a bit of time for his eyes to dry before sitting up. There, that’s better.
“And if we can?”
Tony groans and shifts, and to his relief nothing protests too terribly. Nothing is broken, and he hasn’t ruptured anything. All his limbs are attached and functional, just bruised.
Rain is coming. They would be much better sheltered in a cave than a tent. Tony swallows and glances down at Steve’s heaving chest. His shirt is dampened by slowly intensifying rain, clinging to his pecs.
Everything is under control. They’re winning, overpowering this well-armed but poorly-manned base with their larger fleet.
dark in here.
“Can’t help it,” Steve taps his collar. “This thing’s in the way.” He can’t quite open his mouth all the way, or tip his head to go with the flow, that’s for sure.
Can you imagine that when I first conceived this, I thought it might be more on the cute/humorous side of things? And look what happened instead. I'm not sorry.
Steve can’t think of an answer, but that’s alright, because Tony continues. “We worked together pretty good way back when,” he strolls along like they’re headed to the park instead of a weapons manufacturing facility. “Kicked some alien ass. Good times. I figured I was wrong about you, that you weren’t just some jock in a flag-colored bodysuit. Suits you, I will say, but you’d look cuter if you pulled the stick out your ass. You’ve got one the size of the Statue of Liberty up there. Did then, still do.”
Steve doesn’t answer, completely unconscious.
“God, you’re a pain in the ass, Rogers...” Tony scrubs his face nervously. “If you could wake up, that’d be dandy. I work out, but not enough to lug you around, that’s for sure.” He reaches for the Captain’s bullet-proof vest and unzips it carefully. “You’ve got until I’m done checking you out, then I’m dragging you through the forest, got it? It’ll be embarrassing. You don’t want to be dragged, do you?”
This might at least not be terrible.
The ramp lowers, and Steve hops out, angling his body swiftly. The drop is short, and in seconds he’s plunging into the water. Another few heartbeats, and there’s a second splash. Steve swears he hears a third, but he can’t be sure.
"We’ve got something for you. SHIELD needs you on this.”
Tony isn’t a spy either. He’s not even a trained operative. Why Fury wants him to come is still a bit of mystery; Steve doesn’t think Stark’s skillset is the only reason he’s being thrown into this. It might not even be the main reason. Things never are as they seem with Fury.
Steve’s hand gently lands on top of his head. His coordination is shot because of his injuries and all the drugs in his system, but he manages to give Tony’s head a pat. “It’s okay.”
“You brought Iron Man.” Steve can’t believe it. The chip is one thing, something he actually agrees is a good idea and will make breaking in a lot daintier, and a lot faster. But Iron Man? A whole suit of armor capable of launching rockets and small missiles? Something the government has tried to take ownership of for being too dangerous? Something that’s so shiny and colorful and recognizable?
Happy is waiting for them in the car, and watches as they both slide into the back seat. “Captain,” he greets. “Where to?”
“Good, cus you’re shit at it,” Tony smirks.
“Aye aye, Captain,” Tony peels off and flies to his side of the building, while Steve does the same.
“Get off,” Tony groans again, trying to push the Captain off his back. Steve is
The jet disappears, and Steve closes the distance between himself and Tony in two powerful strokes. Then he wraps his arm around the engineer and starts swimming for the shore. It’s about ten minutes’ swimming distance, for him at least. To his relief, the other man goes quiet, perfectly still in Steve’s grip as he allows himself to be dragged along at a pace that would put Olympic medalists to shame.
what he can do. “JARVIS,” he bats the EMTs away from him and throws off the blanket before they can stop him.
Surprisingly, Tony doesn’t take much to rouse. He groans and rubs his eyes, and the journey of realization is clear in his eyes as he remembers he’s not at home in a warm, plush bed surrounded by expensive sheets. Nope, he’s in a forest, in a tent. The inventor scowls and props himself up on one arm, his hair a mess. He licks his lips. “What time is it, Soldier?”
Did a computer just complement him? Steve’s tickled by that, and there’s a possibility it’s because he feels as though Tony himself had given the praise. “You’re doin’ great,” Steve assures. He raises his hands, determined to shoot down this HYDRA agent once and for all.
Steve scans the carnage below, forgetting his pounding head and strained breaths so he can focus on a plan. “How many suits do you have?”
Now it’s gone, with everyone going their separate ways.
Steve doesn’t like being on the sidelines for any reason, and he doesn’t like not knowing what’s going on. At least he still has his earpiece, through which he can hear Tony breathing, and the occasional exchange with JARVIS. Even over the buzz of helicopter rotors, he can hear the sounds of gunfire below.
Steve isn’t a hardened, soulless soldier who only cares for order and rules. He’s sweet and friendly and understanding. He wants to make other people happy, even within his own suffering. He’s endlessly selfless, endlessly caring, and more human than anyone Tony has ever met. All of that he knows from just a couple of days spent in some cave. Now it looks more and more that they’ll get to spend some more time together. How much more will he learn about the Captain? There’s more to learn, he knows it. Steve’s already alluded to some of those layers.
“Okay, look,” Tony hands the towel over to Steve to dry his hands. “I need you to stop doing that weird thing where you make a vague remark. You’re in no way assuring me that you’re not some crazy guy who lives alone in the woods with his pet wolves preying on innocent joggers.”
“I gotta get a new job,” the woman shakes her head. “I knew he was crazy, but man did I underestimate it.”
“Why, so you can pretend to give a shit?” Tony quips, throwing his shirt to the floor and turning back to Pepper.
If he had to guess, he figured Steve would probably drag them to some 'art in the park' event, or maybe just the movies. Either was fine with Tony so long as it was low key, and just the two of them. Long gone were Tony's days of bar hopping and binge drinking, at least in public. He still had his low moments behind closed doors, but Steve made him better most days.
“Tsk tsk,” Steve shook his head, “still so selfish. On your knees, Director. I’m not done with you yet.”
“God,” Tony said, more to himself than to Steve. “You either said that to turn me on, or you’re too innocent for your own good.” He said with a light shake of his head.
Tony rolled his eyes up and tilted his head, when he looked at Steve again he asked, “What if I leave the chocolate and flowers out of it?”
Tony’s face remained straight and Steve immediately knew that he wasn’t joking. But why even ask? Was he interested in him?
Tony grinned and held the roses out to Steve, “I believe they call it, courting,” was his cheeky response.
Steve’s eyes lingered on Tony’s for a moment, before he snapped back to reality and focused on Pepper.
“I’m…” Steve started, wiping his reddened lips, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.”
Steve huffed out a laugh as he replied with, “I’m sure.” He thought for a moment, and then continued, “Besides, you’re you and I’m me. We’re looking for two different things.”
And then Steve did something that Tony wasn’t expecting.
“He uh, well…” Steve squirmed around and offered a nervous laugh. “I can’t really compare you two.”
doing more than enough,” Tony corrected, speaking to Steve for the first time that day.
“I like it more than cars, too bulky in my opinion.”
He put his strong arms around Tony and switched their positions so that Tony was firmly pressed against the door. The second their lips were parted didn’t stop them. Steve latched onto him and sucked Tony’s open lips into his mouth. Their tongues dipped in and out and their closeness forced them to swallow the noises building up from their throats.
After a moment, “This isn’t replacing my stuff. That couch—” he pointed behind Tony at the large sectional, “—probably cost more than my stuff combined.”
“Okay, good. That’s good, right? So, what happened to good ol’ James?” He went for another bite when Steve answered.
“Tony,” she said, this time in a scolding tone that Tony hated and loved because it’s the tone that forced him to keep his shit together. “You could’ve hurt someone.”
“No, Tony. No way. Stop it,” she said and turned to her boss as if Steve wasn’t in the room.
Steve let his hand fall to his side as he let out a short laugh.
The only thing was, he hadn’t realized Tony would join them as well. This time, the billionaire wasn’t coated with oil or smelling like iron. This time, he was dressed like Steve had seen him in those magazines. He wore a gray suit with a band t-shirt under the jacket which made it hard to see who they were. He had on some sort of rustic fragrance that smelled good on him. Steve thought for a moment that he preferred the machine smell he’d worn the previous day. But he wouldn’t admit that aloud.
“So you like to ride?” He asked and Steve gave him a shrug and a nod.
Steve squirmed, but didn’t hold back the way he wanted to, “I’m just not interested in having sex just to… have sex.”
Steve was left alone in the mammoth sized office. It was relatively clean if not for the desk that looked like it’d been hit by a hurricane. Metal parts and odd objects littered the large expanse of wood. On the walls there were plaques, floating shelves that housed technology books, and blown up magazine covers; some featuring Stark and his business partners, some solo.
For one, the home looked like something off of a TV show with all it’s polished, brand new furniture that couldn’t possible belong to Steven Grant Rogers. And also, the man pressed against Steve like he wanted to climb him like a tree surely couldn’t be Tony Stark, owner of Stark Industries, right?
“Meeting?” Tony questioned. He scratched his cheek with an oil-stained hand, creating a dark smudge from his ear to his chin.
Once they were sitting and Steve had gotten a couple bites, he sat his food on the coffee table and thought about what he wanted to say. He hadn’t told Sam about Tony’s initial flirting, if he could even call it that, because he assumed it would go away. In fact, he assumed Tony had flirted with him because he was bored and Steve was there. Once he’d left the tower he hadn’t thought it would go any further than that. But now that he was here, pushing himself against Steve and allowing him to get a whiff of that expensive cologne mingled with the faint smell of burning wood.
Steve rolled his eyes and ignored the comment in favor of addressing Pepper, “I’ll go take a look at the place and I’ll let you know how it goes,” he said. She uncovered her mouth and nodded.
Chalking it up to mere coincidence, Tony settles back down into his bed, relaxing a little as he falls into a content slumber.
“Excuse me?” Tony eyebrows shoot up in surprise.
From behind his back, Steve revealed a bouquet of flowers, JARVIS zoomed to get a better view.
“Oh, shit…”
Tony’s too far gone for reasoning, his eyes a bright glowing golden. He struggles beneath Steve, his claws extended as he desperately tries to swipe at Steve’s hands, pinning down his wrists. Steve’s been there before, being a teenage werewolf wasn’t as glamorous as Hollywood insisted, and too many times he’d found himself in Tony’s position, which is great because that just means Steve knows exactly how to handle this.
Tony gasped, toes curled in his perfectly shined shoes.
“I’m here, Tony, don’t fight it.”
It wasn’t a sickness, per se but his body had ached in a way he couldn’t explain. He didn’t want to be touched, but he wanted to be held. He couldn’t sit still, anxious and restless. His head had been heavy and he felt lethargic. Obviously those two people who had kept him up half the night were to blame, so he'd taken it easy on Saturday and postponed his plans for the next day.
Tony’s whole stance seemed to change when he read that last message. Suddenly, it seemed, the events of the evening were beginning to dawn on Tony. Steve’s hovering in the bathroom while he got ready, the hand on his lower back throughout the night, and now this.
Wow. Steve wanted to gape at her, but he had enough discipline to mask his complete shock of her offer. Instead his eyes widened a bit and he let out a low gasp that he couldn’t hold in.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck and followed his friend over to the counter to pick through the bag of Chinese. When he found the box of lo mien meant for him, he grabbed a pair of chopsticks and walked it over to the couch. Sam followed him, waiting patiently for him to explain why America’s superstar was draping himself over Steve just before he’d shown up.
Pepper pursed her lips at him, “Did you hear a thing I said?”
He opened the fridge and was almost surprised by the array of foods: milk, juice, eggs, bacon, fruits, water bottles, and more, that greeted him. He sighed, because honestly, this was too much.
“Good afternoon, sir.” Steve jumped and looked around, checking each corner to see if a little British man was hiding somewhere in them. Then the voice spoke again, “I am Jarvis. I will start your ascent to the top floor, Mr. Rogers.”
Taking that as an invite, Tony followed when Steve turned and made his way into the building.
“Call me privileged, but are you really about to drink New York tap water?”
On the side of the large drone-missile-looking thing, the name Stark is written across it.
At the elevators, he didn’t see a button, so he squinted his eyes at the doors. He tilted his head and looked around in search of one when the doors in front of him slid open. He was a little shocked to see that it was empty, but got in anyway.
“And,” Tony interrupted, “I’m not buying my way into your pants. I’m simply replacing the things I destroyed. Nothing more, nothing less,” he finally took a sip of his water then and Steve eyed him as he finally went silent.
Steve winced at that and looked away. Sam noticed the way the atmosphere shifted at the mention of James Barnes, but he wouldn’t speak on it. James was a mutual friend, but the way he’d left Steve after all the years they’d been together as friends and more, especially with his mom in the hospital, was too cruel for Sam to blame Steve for distancing himself.
He grabbed the offered hand with a firm, but tentative grip, and gave it a light shake. “Uh, hello Ms. Potts.”
Once he was a foot away from Tony, he spoke in a low voice, “What is all this?”
role, the man kissed like he was born to do it.
Something bubbled up and forced a laugh out of Pepper before she could contain it. She put a hand over her mouth and looked between the two.
Steve rolled his eyes at that, “I’m not interested in…” he waved his hand as he reached for the right words, “getting off.”
Tony squinted at her, his mind digging up the information he needed. “Meeting... meeting... Oh! Rogers, right? Hey! I remember!” He said in defense as he wiped his hands on his pants, creating ugly black smudges on each leg.
“Ms. Potts. Uh, I mean, Pepper. You don’t have to. You’re doing more than enough already.”
“What! I’m trying to be nice!” He argued, playful but defensive.
The next day came, and the situation had not improved.
“He’s kidding. You don’t have to answer that.” Pepper said with a weak attempt at a laugh.
What they were looking at was a brick, tattered building on the Southside, two bus stops and a train ride away from his campus; yet still much closer than he was living before.
“We became lovers,” Steve tried to sound nonchalant, but his cheeks were betraying him.
Tony laughed a little and shook his head. He took a second to eye Steve’s appearance while he drank down a considerable amount of wine.
Tony smiled, and wasn’t shy about the way his eyes trailed up and down the length of Steve’s massive figure. Steve fought the urge to squirm because he swore he could
“Oh uhm, yeah. I’d appreciate that. I’m kind of homeless now,” he laughed a little, even if it wasn’t a very funny situation.
Steve gaped at him. Pepper had walked in half way through his question and was just as wide-eyed as him.
Steve looked between them for a moment, thrown off his axis by the left field question.
They both went quiet and it became apparent that they were expecting Steve to speak up next. “Oh! Well yeah, I do. But, I couldn’t ask you to do that.”
“Uh, what?” Tony asked, shaking his head to clear his mind so that he could make sure he wasn’t hearing things.
Tony’s presence didn’t make much sense to Steve, seeing as Pepper appeared to be the voice of the company. Tony merely sat at the other end of the large table glaring at them while he fiddled with some unorthodox gadget.
Tony looked ahead as he thought for a moment, then back at Steve, “I’ve never rode one. I’ve built a couple in my spare time, but I never had the urge.”
Tony shrugged, lips twisting upward as he spoke, “I can wait. I’m a patient guy. Ask Pepper.”
“And, are you expecting
They stared at each other after that for a while. Their eyes were locked, and all of a sudden, it felt like there was a force pushing them towards each other.
On the other hand, Steve wasn’t sure why he hadn’t just kicked Tony out by now. Maybe there really was something about him that drew people in. But through all his charm and easy going personality, Steve had to remember that he was still the infamous playboy, philanthropist that ended up on the cover of news stories more often for his scandals than for his inventions.
The people around him on the streets are in a panic, constantly brushing against him as they fled the scene to some form of safety and making way for the fire truck that really had no flame to extinguish.  All the while Steve just stood there in his collared shirt and khakis, a messenger bag over his shoulder and a passive look of acceptance written across his face.
But to both of their surprise, Steve did it for her, “Actually, I just got out of a long relationship, so I’m not interested. Sorry,” he dipped his head, looking boyish and charming. Meanwhile Tony’s face twisted like he’d just been spit on.
Steve paid the bill, after a good amount of arguing, and the two left the restaurant. They walked side-by-side back to Steve’s place. Tony started back up on their conversation about motorcycles.
With his eyes on the wall to the left of Tony, Steve spoke again, “You can’t buy your way into my pants, Mr. Stark.”
She had led him down the hall to a large conference room. They sat at the end of the table and she opened up a laptop to help Steve search for a new apartment that would be affordable once he’d have to start paying again, and also close to his campus.
As promised, Pepper slotted out some time to meet with Steve in his search for a new apartment.
you want to remember what I said.”
“Single? Yes—no? Eh, I guess it doesn’t matter. I can work with it either way. How about dinner tonight? Lunch tomorrow works too.”
“I’m not the one yanking my boss around,” Tony countered, even if besides the cock blocking he didn’t really mind Pepper’s manhandling.
Steve didn’t give the commotion happening outside his classroom building much thought. It could’ve been anything, a celebrity appearance, a fight, a magic performance; hell, who knew?
“Whatever you say,” Tony started, looking into Steve’s clouded eyes with a lust-glazed look of his own. After a second to collect himself, he went on, “I’m so fucking glad you did.”
She crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes at him, “No. You’re trying to get in his pants.”
Tony nodded. The mood was growing dark. Now that he didn’t have any food left to use to mask his discomfort, he reached over and plucked a fry from Steve’s tray. He decided he needed to brighten the mood before it plummeted any further, “Is he better looking than me?” He joked and Steve immediately blushed in a way that Tony was growing to love.
“Okay, no dinner and sex. Got it. What about a friendly dinner and a friendly movie? Light petting may or may not be involved, but totally subject for debate.” He suggested this time and Steve couldn’t help but laugh a little.
Tony straightened, and pulled his welding mask up to rest on top of his head. He glared up at his ceiling as he addressed his A.I. “Uh, no. Why are you turning down my music?” He turned to Pepper next, “Who let you in, and why are you turning down my music?”
“Okay sure, but are you really going to call the cops on this face?” He leaned against the kitchen counter on the elbows, while Steve rifted through his cabinets to find brand new glasses. He pulled out two, probably because his good-guy persona wouldn’t allow himself to not offer Tony a drink, invited or not.
“Uh,” Sam slowly came all the way in, and closed the door behind him. He looked back at the pair; eyes squinted like he was trying to see things clearly. “Hey buddy, what’s going on here?”
He swallowed and shrugged, “I wanted to see your reaction.”
Tony shrugged, “Why not? It’s not going to cost me extra if you stay here. Hell, it’d cost me more if you ended up staying somewhere else. What d’you say?”
“Sounds good.”
“Steve, I am so sorry. As you can see, Mr. Stark’s been working all day and hasn’t had much time to rest. He's just talking nonsense. Don't mind him, please.”
Steve chuckled, but shook his head. “No, no way.”
The apartment he’d visited had stained carpets and peeling wallpaper. The appliances were a bit rusted and the tiles in the kitchen were chipped.
Steve shrugged. It’d been almost a month now. Could he still consider that recent? “We were really close, but I don’t think we were good together.”
Steve gave her a small smile, “Well once I have to start paying bills again, it’s what I can afford.”
Steve’s large shoulders sagged. He shook his head and walked around the counter towards the couch. Tony grabbed his wrist, effectively stopping him. With the momentum, it forced Steve to turn back and face him. They’d almost bumped chests, but Steve was able to quickly hold his ground to prevent the contact.
“Stop what?” He asked, though his eyes never left Steve. “I’m just saying. It would be super convenient, right? Aren’t you going to that community college right around the corner from here?”
On the way he’d learned that Tony could
Another week passed when Tony decided to pay his new object of interest a visit. The home visit wasn’t a complete failure. He’d seen the way Steve had looked at him. The attraction was there; he just needed to break down that damned wall of virtue Steve was hiding behind.
To his surprise, Tony spoke up again, “How tall are you?”
Steve sucked in a breath, and he wasn’t completely sure why, “That might not be a good idea.”
She pulled a small book from her breast pocket and began reading off her notes. “He’s a student at the local community college. He’s twenty-three, works part time at an art shop, and his only known family member is his mother. She was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and has been in the hospital for the past two weeks.” Pepper finished her spiel there and it took a moment for Tony to respond.
He was testing out the rotary movement in the little robot’s left arm when he did, “So what? I’ll set him up in a new place or something.” He said as if the solution were as simple as giving a dollar to the homeless.
“Well why don’t you…” Tony paused when the doorknob jiggled, followed by the door being swung open.
“Huh? Oh, yeah. My best friend,” Tony shrugged. “He’s more like a big brother. Scary face, army brat, helps me keep my shit together when Pepper can’t deal with me anymore.” He took a bite of his burger after that. Steve nodded like he was coming to some sort of understanding.
Tony laughed, “Why not?”
At the restaurant, Tony drew in people’s eyes as if he sparkled. His presence was impossible to ignore. Apparently he’d noted just how uncomfortable Steve got with groups of people staring in his direction because he’d requested a table in the back.
“Seriously? Tony fucking Stark asked you on a date? What did you say?” Sam urged and Steve was feeling more awkward about the whole thing.
Pepper’s eyes widened. She looked from Steve to the rent that was barely over nine hundred.
He thought maybe Tony would drop it there, let go and take a few steps back. But Tony pressed forward, not suffocating but close enough that their chests nearly pressed together. Steve could really see into Tony’s chocolate brown eyes now. They were amazing.
Steve looked around at the furnishings again then gave Tony a side-eyed look. “You did this?”
expression and attempted a charming smile, “How much trouble am I in?”
was creepy.
“Oh.” Pepper paused to think for a moment, then said, “What if we covered your expenses until you’ve graduated? We could do that—.”
She scrunched her face. “Ew Tony. Stop! No! No sleeping with the guy who’s home you wrecked.”
“Uh,” he cleared his throat again, “I’m here. I uh…” He dug into his back pocket and pulled out the crinkled invitation. “I got an invitation to meet with Mr. Stark.”
Tony rolled his eyes and held his hands up in defense, “Look, no touching. Promise.”
Steve called Pepper the next day. In two weeks he was moving into his new place with a book bag holding the rest of his belongings. After that initial conversation with Stark, he’d opted to stay with Sam until he’d secured a new place. Staying in a suite sounded nice, but he didn’t want that conversation to turn into something else.
She dropped her phone to her side and rolled her eyes, “A lot, Tony. Like, a lot,” she emphasized her point with an exaggerated wave of her hand. “You can’t fly those things out in the city untested,” she said this as if he doesn’t already know, but he does, though he won’t point that out to her.
Steve paused and looked over his shoulder at the billionaire.
Tony turned his body towards Steve and nodded his head at the apartment building’s entrance. “Should I walk you up?”
“Are you out of your mind?” She shrieked. Steve was starting to think he really should have stayed home (or rather, on Sam’s couch).
So, he’d just have to fix that.
“Tony, I swear to God.” Her patience was clearly at it’s limits.
“Wow,” Sam said and laughed some more. “Only you, Steve. Good ol’ kid from Brooklyn turns down the most powerful man in America.”
“Bend me over?” Steve questioned, face red as he looked up at Sam.
“It wasn’t any problem at all,” he said, trying to appear conversational, but really wanting to sink into himself. He’s never been great at talking to women. Bucky would always tease him about it when they were growing up...
They stopped in front of the doors, and they automatically slid open for them. She motioned for Steve to enter first, so he did, albeit without the most confidence. “I’ll have to grab Mr. Stark. He’s probably downstairs in his workshop.” It seemed like she’d said that last bit to herself. Either way, Steve nodded. “Make yourself comfortable. I’ll be back shortly.” After that, she turned and was gone.
Her smile melted into something less professional, and became much more welcoming.
It was so uncomfortable to sit with his face turned to Pepper, while he could feel those eyes on the back of his neck.
“The pleasure was all mine.” With that, he backed away. Because her eyes were still on him, he gave a short wave before turning and making his way to the elevators. He beat himself up a little for it.
Tony’s eyes widened, “Seriously?”
“Courting you. Didn’t I say that already? Or maybe I should serenade you as well.
“I told him no,” he picked up his food and busied himself with stuffing more into his mouth so that he didn’t have to look Sam in the eye then.
“We hope you’ll accept our offer,” Pepper finished there, opening the floor for him to deny or accept and yet Steve was speechless.
“I don’t know,” Steve said as he digested Sam’s words. It was true that he was slowly getting over what happened between him and Bucky. It’d been nearly three weeks now. But still, he highly doubted there was anything Tony Stark saw in him other than his looks.
Don’t be alarmed if all he can do is stare up at the building, unmoving and unsure of what to do next.
Tony shrugged, “He wouldn’t have to do a lot of things if he would stop being such a Boy Scout and accept my date.”
She rolled her eyes instead of properly responding. With a hand on her hip, she nodded back at the door she’d come from. “Did you forget about your meeting today?” She chided and Tony blinked at her as if she had spoken a foreign language.
“No, it’s okay,” Steve cut in. Maybe it was because he’d been here for the past hour dealing with Tony’s silent treatment, but he was feeling fed up. “I guess he’s not used to people saying no to him. Not everyone is desperate.”
Steve blushed, “I didn’t say it to turn you on.” He realized how awkward those words sounded coming out, but he stood by them.
Tony bit his lip, breathing hard and fighting to come down from the temporary high of being absorbed by Steve. He ran a hand through his hair, scratching his scalp and pulling on the strands in an attempt to clear his rattled mind.
Halfway through their burgers and a story about Steve’s first experience on a motorcycle, Tony’s phone buzzed.
He argued instead, “Well, to be fair—hear me out on this— I technically didn’t fly it out there. I was testing it on the roof and something went wrong with the navigational system and,” she still wasn’t impressed, so Tony shut his mouth before he earned himself a longer lecture than he was already in for.
Pepper closed her eyes and sighed. “Tony,” she said in a scolding voice.
Steve met his eye again, and Tony could tell it was hard for him. “You’re very… different.”
Maggie typed something up in her system, and while Steve was poking at the bobble head of what appeared to be Tony Stark, she spoke up again, “Okay, you can go on up.” She stood, and leaned over the desk so that she could point around the corner. Steve tried to seem unbothered by her closeness, “The elevators are right over there. Go on up to the top floor. The doors will open for you.”
Once they arrived at the building, both spotted the silver sports car where Happy was parked on the corner. His head was down and his eyes were staring intensely at his phone as his thumbs tapped away.
Steve paused, then laughed and shook his head. “I wouldn’t describe you as buff, but,” he blushed and looked away. “I wouldn’t really know, so…”
Her fingers paused. She peeked up at him, finished typing whatever she was on, and then turned to him with her full attention. Her pink tinted lips curled upward, and she pushed her chest out in a way that Steve knew was inviting. Even he couldn’t ignore the view presented to him.
Tony shrugged, “I don’t see your point.”
Steve cleared his throat and shifted in his seat again, “Still not giving up on that, huh?” He asked as if he didn’t already know the answer.
But then, to her horror, he walked back into the office without another word.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Steve said to no one in particular as he looked up at the enormous metal contraption that’s landed itself into the twelfth floor window that just happens to be his apartment. He could imagine the state of his hand-me-down sofa; twin sized bed and 2001 box TV with that monstrosity impaling it.
On the other side of the glass doors, Tony allowed his assistant to drag him until the automatic doors closed behind them.
Tony paused. Pepper sighed, because for once it seemed like she was able to get through to him. Tony could be so thick headed when he wanted to be.
“Isn’t this technically breaking and entering?” Steve asked after a moment and walked over to inspect the kitchen.
“What? This?” He pointed down at his vibrating pocket. “It’s nothing, just James or Pepper. Maybe Stark Industries is going bankrupt. Who knows?” He joked and Steve found himself laughing at it.
“This was fun,” Tony said instead. “You know, I can’t say I wouldn’t mind a little hanky-panky, but I’m not totally distraught.”
But what were more surprising are the first words that came from Tony’s mouth. “Say Steven. Steve,” he corrected after a quick second. “Would you happen to be gay? Single? Bi-curious, maybe?”
Tony gave a slow nod, but he wasn’t done, “Different how?”
He cleared his throat, for some reason it felt thick with an invisible lump, then made his way into the building.
“Are you sure you want to live in a building like this?” Pepper masked her disgust, but the slight tilt in her lips gave it away.
“Um,” Tony pointed, switching between Steve and Sam. “He isn’t your boyfriend right?”
He patted her on the shoulder; “At least I’m not the bad kind, right?”
He walked into his new apartment and was shocked to find it fully furnished. He let out a short laugh as he took in the brand new sofa, large television and renovated floors and appliances. It was definitely not the same apartment he’d visited two weeks ago.
done anything.
Pepper sighed and shook her head, but didn’t protest when Tony got up from his stool and followed her to the elevator.
Steve nodded, obviously confused, and simply watched as Pepper practically dragged Tony out of the office.
Tony sat up straight and countered “If by desperate, you mean normal, then yeah, I think we’re on the same page.”
“Oh.” Steve said and placed a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. He’d finally let go of Steve’s wrist, and didn’t fight being pushed back a couple feet. “Hey Sam.”
“You’re kidding?” Tony swiveled in his workshop chair to face his fuming assistant. Pepper wasn’t the least bit impressed. Her eyes were narrowed into a deep glare. She held the screen of her phone out to him. “Oh… You’re not kidding,” Tony breathed out as he watched the news report she'd presented to him. A Stark Transport drone, his latest model, crash-landed into some rundown Brooklyn apartment building. The headline, “Stark Inventions Gone Wild”, was tasteless if you asked him. He looked up from the screen to Pepper’s
But being scrutinized for so long, and having to pretend it wasn’t happening was becoming a bit unbearable. Pepper was obviously a pro at dealing with whatever type of temper tantrum this was, because she spoke to Steve with ease. Even though with the way she was sitting, she could easily make eye contact with her boss, she kept her eyes focused on Steve.
Steve didn’t know much more than the average person did about the young billionaire. He knew that Tony Stark was a genius, though didn’t fully understand in what capacity. He had a vague understanding that he was known to be some sort of eccentric playboy, but that was no surprise. What young, rich guy wasn’t? He’d only recently found out (via Sam’s obsessive research upon Steve receiving the invite) that Tony was twenty-four, born on May 29th and his favorite food is shawarma.
Tony rolled his eyes up and smirked, “Well Pepper helped, along with a team of interior designers, and some good ol’ handymen.”
Steve stared at the door for a long moment. He hadn’t really registered Sam walking over to his counter and putting the food down, until he was standing in front of him and waving his hand.
Steve pinched his brow before he spoke in a tight voice, “Why are you here, Tony?”
Steve silently shook his head and Tony clamped his open lips shut.
Steve glared over at him without even meaning to. Pepper spoke for him, “Something he wouldn’t have to do if you weren’t playing with your toys in the city.”
“Yeah well, it feels nice to ride with the wind against my skin.”
Pepper rolled her eyes right back, but moved on because Tony is hopeless and she knew this very well. “Steven Rogers is the man who’s apartment you destroyed.”
But he did, and Tony’s eyes zeroed in on him like he had some sort of thermal vision.
Steve laughed a bit, because he instantly understood what the A.I. meant. Just then he’d made it to the top. The doors opened to reveal a ginger-haired woman, dressed in a royal blue jacket and pencil skirt. Her mouth was decorated with a diplomatic smile and a tablet was clutched to her chest. Once he’d stepped through, she reached a hand out, “Hello Mr. Rogers. My name is Virginia Potts, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Tony was gaping at him for a full ten seconds before he clamped his mouth shut. He looked down, then around the table until his eyes landed on Steve’s shy face.
He frowned and lightly tugged back to let Tony know he wasn’t happy with any of this.
Tony lifted the hand holding the Snickers and waved it high over his head at Steve, causing people to turn their heads and focus all eyes on him. Steve sighed, because he was too much of a nice guy to simply walk away when he was being so obviously beckoned. He dipped his head, even though he was taller than nearly everyone else in the crowd. The people parted for him like a sea, and he really felt like he’d sink in the floor with the way everyone looked at him as he passed by.
Steve sighed, completely taken by Tony’s charm but unwilling to admit it. He bunched his shoulders together and shoved his hands into his pockets. After a second to silently debate with himself, he offered a light shrug.
He does. Tony sits down beside the soldier and pulls out the food. “All settled?”
wake up, and though Tony dreads facing the scorn of Captain America, he’s relieved that his companion is breathing more-or-less normally. He doesn’t need Captain America’s death on his conscience.
Tony’s piping up now, grunting over their personal link. “Dammit. They’ve got another Jericho.”
“So you’ve been spying on me.”
Feedback is always appreciated <3
It is a power-making device, and nothing is ever one-hundred percent efficient. The arc reactor comes pretty close, closer than any other power source on the planet, but there is still some energy lost to heat. Tony brushes the hologram aside and comes closer. His arms have a better handle on the mood than he does, because they don’t hesitate to pull off his shirt. He takes Steve’s hand in his and sets it to the glowing circle in the middle of his chest.
This isn’t anything outside of what he can handle. He’s adaptable, quick-thinking, resourceful. This is no big deal. All he has to do is stay calm.
Tony lands outside, on the redesigned pad. The doors open and he walks into the lounge, stepping out of the suit as it peels away and stands sentry.
“I’m so sorry,” the words spill out of his mouth as he puts his arm through Steve’s Kevlar vest. “I’m so sorry, god, I’m sorry... I fucked everything up... I fucked
“Such a flirt,” Tony grins, and jets up into the air through the hatch.
“Vodka? Before lunch? I underestimated you,” Tony ignores America’s boy scout and walks over. “Maybe we could get along after all.”
It feels like forever since he’s been down in his workshop. Tony walks down the stairs on jelly legs, feeling strangely giddy. It’s been ages since he’s had a house guest, but it’s never made him feel quite as victorious as this. It feels... satisfying.
Happy helps Steve fold some clothes and personal belongings into a suitcase. It doesn’t take more than fifteen minutes to collect everything. Tony stands by the bookshelf in the living room and picks up the photo there. It’s black and white, and a little yellowed within the frame. It’s of Steve, and a group of people he knows are the Howling Commandos. Howard told him about them, but mostly about Captain America.
There’s little chance of that, but Steve knows that from this point onward, Tony will do what he wants no matter how much they argue. This mission is testing his nerves more and more, and they haven’t even started it yet. “I’ll take first watch,” he growls, standing up and pushing the tarp flap aside. He brings his blanket with him and secures the tarp corner with a rock, sitting down in the dirt where he can see the forest best. Tony doesn’t protest or follow. He simply turns out the light. Steve hears him shuffle around a little as he gets tucked into bed.
They’ve fallen, and it’s his fault. Steve took the brunt of it, too. How many feet did they crash? Tony swallows, sobering. “Rogers,” he tries again, reaching under Steve’s jaw for a pulse.
When Tony opens his eyes, he can’t breathe. His whole body aches, and he’s pretty sure there’s dirt in his mouth. That’s the clue that he’s not just woken up from a terrible nightmare, or accidentally knocked himself out fiddling in his workshop. It’s happened. He’s hit his head too many times to count.
Tony’s brought plenty of girls home. He’s never wanted to indulge any of them as much as he wants to indulge Steve, spoil him so much he can never go back to less. He can’t even imagine a day when Steve will leave, even though he knows the soldier might pack up at the end of the three weeks when he’s allowed back to work. Maybe he’ll leave sooner. Tony tries not to think about that as he watches Steve run his hands along the soft sheets.
SHIELD medical is just as sterile and cold as any other hospital. Tony hates it, and vows to get Steve out of here as fast as possible. “How long are you keeping him here?” he asks more aggressively than is necessary.
Steve can start to feel his shoulders tensing up again. “I’ve done it before. The serum lets me get away with it.” He’ll pay for it once he lets it catch up to him, but he’ll be home by then.
beyond his expertise. Tony does sit back now, stricken with guilt and terror. Steve’s neck might very well be broken. Maybe his spine is damaged in other places, too. It’s hard to tell.
Finally he finds a place to build camp. Tony happily falls into step, shedding his waterproof jumpsuit and backpack of supplies to help erect the shelter. He clears the ground with his boot and lays out the thermal cover. Steve throws the camo tarp over a high branch and secures the holes into the cold earth with pegs and his bare fist. It only takes one hearty smack each to get them into the ground, and soon the shelter is drawn over them, the cliff to one side, and a large tree to the other. Steve hangs their bags from lower branches, unzipping his larger one to retrieve thermal blankets and some food. He rolls out his mat and sits down, loosening his bullet-proof vest and reaching for his food.
of a mess), but in the end Steve had loosened up, showing there was more to him than following the rules. Right now, in his SHIELD-issued uniform, Steve looks like he carries a little notebook full of rules in his utility belt.
“We can turn the lights on in there, and it won’t be so dark,” Steve reassures, finding it impossible to keep up the stern distance he’s been so diligently cultivating. Lots of people are afraid of the dark, and he won’t hold it against anyone not to feel comfortable in it. Steve himself isn’t fond of it, but with some lights on it’ll be a nice shelter.
There’s more to learn about Tony, too. Steve’s smart, a lot smarter than the engineer first perceived him to be. He’ll soon figure out that though Tony doesn’t sell weapons anymore, that won’t stop him from being the Merchant of Death. On top of that, he’s a wreck. Steve can’t possibly want to be friends with someone so broken.
Tony makes a point about groaning, even though the reaction he’ll get from the AI is less than satisfactory. It’s more fun with Pepper. “What does he want.”
Fury glances around. “Lay your ass down, Rogers, or so help me God-”
“Avengers’ Tower. You have until noon to get here.” There’s a click.
Tony comes closer, gets down on one knee and moves with some of his classic confidence. Steve’s licking his lips, struggling to know how to respond. He’s leaning forward though, as if some kind of instinct is driving him, too. Tony closes the gap, opening his mouth and pushing it against Steve’s willing lips. It feels just as safe and warm as when the Captain drew him into a hug in that supply closet. Steve’s arm comes up and pulls him closer, affirming that this is okay and encouraging him to give more. Tony does. He’s a good kisser, and Steve definitely isn’t, but that’s alright. Steve just lets him do whatever he wants to, willing and easy-going. He doesn’t resist.
Tony pulls out a flashlight, but Steve shakes his head. “Just follow me,” he orders. “They might send out night patrols. I can see fine.”
He’s not worth all this. He can’t be. If space had swallowed him back then, he’d have died happy. A hero. His last act would have been something selfless, something that saved countless lives. He’d have been mourned, would have left a good impression. But he survived, and now he’s been given the chance to fuck up making friends.
Once it’s bright enough, and the last few stars are chased away, Steve goes back inside the tent. The sooner they leave, the better. They have a lot of ground to cover. “Tony,” he announces, nudging the man sprawled under the blanket. “Up.” He’s not sure how he’s supposed to wake up a man he doesn’t know very well. Should he kick him? Shake him? Or just stand over him and say his name until he gets up?
They likely will. How soon? That depends on how annoying Steve is.
Fury is waiting, appraising the two of them with satisfaction and something edging toward malevolence, as if this is all some evil plan. Tony wouldn’t be surprised. It’s not the first time the director has been hiding other operations. Tony can’t bring himself to care though, not for this. He knows he’s reading into this because he’s bitter.
up...” He loops his arms under Steve’s armpits and pulls.
“At the expense of his own safety,” Tony argues. Cuts and scrapes are one thing.
There had been some swift and sure bonding after fighting off a world invasion, no doubt about that. Steve hadn’t felt so alive in a long time, gathered around a table eating shawarma with a group of people just as lost and different as him. But they’d all gone their separate ways immediately after, and that had been the end of that. A hint of friendship, a glimpse at a new family he could have made, with people carrying baggage just like him. The only people who came close to being able to relate to him. He hadn’t felt so alone, for just a day.
“Maybe...” Steve winces. He’s still too sore to bend down and touch his toes, or twist all that much.
Soon they’ll be free, and Steve can walk around in the tightest shirts Tony can find him.
“I’ll uh, leave you to it?” he offers. “JARVIS can order dinner. Whatever you want. I’ll be, um, down in my workshop. If you want me.”
“Wow, you really are off your tits, aren’t you,” Tony smiles and pulls the chair as close as he can get it. “Nice threads. Though your accessorizing needs some work. Those wrists are too pretty not to be covered in jewelry. You’ve got yourself three weeks off. I think we need to go shopping and get you a Rolex.”
suit,” Steve scowls. “I’ll wait outside.”
“I am merely following Mr. Stark’s direction,” the AI replies, taking control and flying the suit back to the chopper.
He gathers up Iron Man in a couple of armfuls, and finally the whole thing is sitting in a pathetic pile out of the rain. Tony abandons it and sits by Steve, wrapping himself in a blanket. He pulls his arms out of the sleeves of his coveralls and tucks his hands under his armpits, trying to coax some warmth back into them. Steve looks the same, a little pale but breathing at a steady rate. He’s not moved at all.
“No, you work for yourself, and this one is on your conscience. So I suggest you do yourself a favor and get your ass up here. Or I’ll come to you.”
“I know that,” Tony’s joking tone finally cracks, and it feels like a petty victory to rouse that frustration. “I’m not a moron, and I’m not taking this lightly.”
“Everything you asked for is in these,” Fury explains, and two other agents step forward, producing a bag each and handing them over. The larger one goes to Steve, and he shoulders the weight effortlessly. “You’ll find basic tools and some electronic equipment,” he explains to Tony. “We’ve also given you enough supplies to last you a couple of days. That includes a tent, food, water, fire-starting supplies, blankets, and first-aid. There are distress beacons in your left breast pockets. If things go to shit, you can call for an extraction as a last resort. We’ll be thirty minutes out from your location.”
There are bits or Iron Man littered around them, as well as plenty of broken twigs and branches. Tony plucks some pine needles from his hair and ruffles it, checking his throbbing head for blood. There is none. Right, of course, Rogers had his hand wrapped around it. Wincing, Tony gets to his knees. Steve lies beside him in the dirt, completely relaxed, a little pale.
“After you,” Steve said pulling the car door open and letting Tony slide in first. Once in, Steve shut the door and requested the driver roll up the partition.
“I’ll just say it. Tony, we’re mates, life mates, soul mates, whatever you want to call it. You’re mine, and I’m yours. It doesn’t seem likely, I know. The way we met was such an act of fate, it doesn’t seem real. The way we’ve spent the past month was so horrible.”
“You!” Tony sneers, a total one-eighty from his tone on the phone. Steve guesses he’s had some time to mull over his acceptance.
And…that isn’t at all what Tony was expecting to hear.
“So obedient all of a sudden, what's changed?” Steve asked, his breath danced across the tip. “Is it because you want something? Now it’s all ‘please sir, I want some more’?”
Tony runs down the stairs, sniffing, and he’s glad no one else is around because he would look absolutely crazy to any passerby. He doesn’t stop, the smell getting stronger the farther he goes. Finally, once he reaches the fifth floor - exactly five floors below his own office - he opens the door to find an office party. Pizza from his favorite place, Little Angela’s, is stacked seven boxes high.
“You alright, boss?”
Furiously, Tony begins unraveling the cloth until he can see the cloth beneath it. Tony's kind enough to catch the gauze before it hits Steve’s bed, but it's not the dried blood that makes Tony gasp as he examines his leg.
Rhodey shook his head, "I gotta get home to the missus soon. And you're avoiding the question," he pointed. He got up to rinse his glass in the sink, and set it to dry.
“I know you’re afraid, Tony, but please listen to me.” Steve hisses as Tony slashes a claw across Steve’s chest, tearing his shirt and ripping across his chest. Blood drips onto the sofa, but the wounds heal quickly enough, and Steve goes on.
“No thanks, I’m not accepting any Stockholm Syndrome today,” Tony says, pushing past Steve. The brush of their shoulders sends a wave of relief over his entire frame but Tony doesn’t stop at the door.
Steve had promised a prompt arrival at six to pick Tony up for their night out, but in the meantime Tony busied himself with Stark Phone tinkering. The latest version, Stark Phone IX had a few bugs in the operating system, nothing he couldn't fix with a little work, but he knew he needed more than a few minutes to do it.
"I'd rather kill time than have you kill yourself. You're supposed to be a genius, why can't you think these things through?!" Steve pointed an accusing finger against Tony's chest.
Tonight was different, sure Steve was dressed just the same, but instead of sitting on the couch to wait, he decided to actively participate in Tony’s ‘getting ready’ routine. That meant standing behind him in the mirror and watching while he shaved, it meant picking out the suit he wore. That meant telling Tony to slick his hair back into place with gel, and ‘no, not that watch the other watch’.
She’s harmless, Steve -T
“Yeah,” Steve nods, “yeah I get that. I accept that. I fucked up, Tony.” Steve pushes all thoughts of kissing to the backburner of his mind. “I understand if you never want to speak to me again after tonight, but I’m really glad you’ve at least decided to accept my help. This is going to make things much easier for you.”
“Oh shit, the bacon!” He calls, making a mad dash from the room, happy to have an excuse to leave.
Tony licks his lips as his eyes drag up the expanse of the man’s chest, “no, this is definitely heaven.”
“Look at me, Tony.” Steve panted as he watched every expression that crossed Tony’s face.
He stepped away a few moments ago to use the bathroom. He took his time, giving Tony plenty of opportunity to find someone who would get him in trouble. For the entirety of the night, Tony had been glued to Steve’s side, and while Steve loved to flaunt Tony off like a trophy, he needed Tony to get in a bit of trouble tonight. So he gave him space, and he gave him time, and Tony, the beautiful fool, didn’t disappoint Steve at all.
"Alright," Tony sighs softly, turning to look out the window. With the sun setting beyond the building, Tony gets an idea. He's going to go for a run, and he knows just the place.
“Hallucinations aren’t generally a symptom of turning into a werewolf…” Steve mutters as he sits up, trying to regain some semblance of dignity.
“I’m here, Tony.”
Back at the Tower, Tony hangs up the phone and curses himself out for being so dramatic. He can’t help it, he needs Steve. He can’t explain the sudden dependency either. It's as if the moment he decided to accept Steve’s assistance something in his mind clicked into place, a piece that was previously missing.
Tony’s one of the last out of the room, despite being the main cause for the early dismissal. Pepper stays behind as well, slowly gathering her notes and files into her black briefcase. She stands when Tony does, watching him from the corner of her eye.
Steve tossed the pillow to the floor, it had caught most of Tony’s mess and could be cleaned tomorrow morning. For now, Steve was more concerned with getting Tony in a comfortable place where Steve could cuddle him back up.
“If you want some relief,” he said slowly. “Then you can rub yourself against the carpet. Do not cum,” he added. Tony was usually very good about not finishing without permission, but hard lines and clear direction were always key once Tony got to this state.
“What are you doing here? Who let you in?”
“For some reason I really doubt that…” Tony stretches a little and pads out of his bedroom toward the bar he had set up in the lounge area.
Tony can hear the slight spike of Steve’s pulse, and maybe he has some sort of condition which makes his heartbeat loud enough to resonate through an otherwise silent room. In any case, Tony finds it strange, but he doesn’t say anything about it, or about the slight pink shade that takes over Steve’s cheeks.
“No one was there,” Tony said a little out of breath. His pupils were blown wide and a little glassy in that telling way. Steve knew he was starting to get to him, but he wasn’t there yet.
Not even Captain Steve Rogers, who stepped out of the elevator upon JARVIS' second review of 13 A.
“Go on,” Steve said nodding toward the office.
Tony didn’t even question it. He caught a glance of himself in the elevator mirror and knew this was exactly who he was meant to be. He stumbled out into the office and headed straight for his office door.
"Yeah? Or what?" Tony pressed his challenge further, a small part of him actually afraid of what he might do.
He's instantly greeted by the smiling office workers sitting around enjoying their meals, and they gladly offer him some. After all, Tony is the boss, and at the end of the day, he's the one supplying this pizza for everyone. He leaves with four slices on a plate, which he finishes before he even reaches his office door.
It wasn’t very late. They left the event early thanks to Steve’s insistence so they still had plenty of time to play, but by now the building was empty. All Stark Industry employees had gone home for the night hours ago, from the overachievers who put in sixty hours a week all the way to the hourly janitorial staff that stayed past everyone’s out time to make sure things were presentable in the morning. They’d all be gone.
“What’s burning?” Tony asks, looking up at Steve who sniffs the air curiously.
“Yeah, I’ve got quite an appetite on mornings after,” Steve replies, but doesn’t elaborate, setting the plate on the small space near the edge of the table.
This doesn’t make sense, none of it makes any sense, and he’s having a full blown attack now. He falls to his knees just in front of the bed and gasps, his lungs trying to take in more oxygen than he needs, but still never quite getting enough. The room around him is dimming, and then brightening. It feels like he’s spinning so he leans forward, head between his knees.
It was tense and silent in the large conference room. At one end of the table Tony sat, carefully not glaring at Steve, who sat at the other end, his pen too loud against the paperwork he was filling out. Witness reports of all things, because once again Tony had gone out of his way to royally fuck things up.
Steve doesn’t say anything, though he knows exactly which dreams Tony is referring to. He’s experienced them just the same. Something on Steve’s face gives him away, and he watches as realization hits the other like a freight train.
“Oh,” Tony stutters before walking over toward the freshly brewed up. Folgers, Tony thinks as he takes in the smell, it’s his favorite. There are two large mugs already set out, and Tony pours the hot liquid into each. “How do you take yours?”
Every instinct in Steve’s body is screaming 'run to him, screw clothing, Tony needs you'. But he doesn’t think he could use that as an excuse as to why he's running around the city barefoot and naked.
This catches Tony's attention, his mind pausing for just a moment as he looks over to her.
Steve motioned to the floor. When it was clear Tony wasn’t understanding Steve’s suggestion he spelled it out for him.
Tony spends almost two hours flipping through papers and notes, phone calls and messages, carefully not thinking about Steve or his stupid phone number, and he loses track of time. Time is such a silly thing, it never really meant much to Tony anyway, but his stomach growls and maybe he should have had more than three cups of coffee for breakfast.
“Because the evidence is right there!” Steve says, pointing to Tony’s leg. “Last night, you said you sprained your ankle, possibly even broke it? You were bitten by a wolf, you hit your head on a rock! Do you have any of those injuries today?”
Tony snorted, "I'm not avoiding anything. Steve and I are...well we're having a good time."
For a moment, Tony kisses back and it’s a long moment, and it’s the best moment Tony’s had all month. But it’s over in a flash, Steve pulling back with a horrified expression painting his features, and Tony’s hands on Steve’s shoulders holding him still.
Hell, Tony didn’t even know it. Not yet anyway.
“Fast healer, huh?” Steve says softly, tilting his head to get a good look at Tony’s leg. His voice picture perfect nonchalance, but Tony can hear something tight just beneath the surface, it piques his suspicion.
Steve stopped walking, and Tony stopped crawling. “Don’t lie to me, Tony, bad boys lie.”
“You need to relax, it’s only going to be worse for you if you don’t.” Steve warns, watching Tony carefully.
There’s a rustling in the bushes then, and Tony holds his breath trying to calm his racing heart.
The conversation goes on for another ten minutes before Tony lets out a loud yell of frustration, “oh shut up already!” The windows of the tower shake with the power of his voice, and even Tony finds himself a little shaken by the sound.
“Please…” Tony moaned as Steve tightened his hold around the base, leaning down to lick at the slit.
“Hey,” Steve tries again to grab the other’s attention.
Lucky for Tony, his alpha has abandonment issues, and enough guilt to insist on looking after his stubborn beta. Of course, there's also that underlying bond that Steve had refused to mention.
"Hey, JARVIS. Is uh…Tony in there?" Steve asked trying to peer in through the bullet proof glass to catch a peek.
“You gonna just stand there, or you gonna pour some coffee?” Steve asks, not turning around.
Steve let out a bitter laugh, and crossed his arms over his chest. "Do you hear yourself? My job is to keep everyone alive whether we defeat the enemy or not; we're a team."
Tony took more of Steve's cock into his mouth, and Steve set a faster, more ragged pace, as if signaling that he was close. Tony took this as an opportunity to try and assert some control, moving a hand from Steve's thigh to cup his balls, adding light pressure here and there. He also made sure to swipe his tongue across the vein that ran along the underside of Steve's cock, and occasionally over the head. By this point, Tony's confidence had come back to life, but Steve didn't have time to notice it because he was overwhelmed by the pleasure that consumed him.
Steve looked up, his eyes willing holes to appear through Tony’s thick skull, at least then he might be able to get his point across. This wasn’t a game, it would never be a game. This was their lives -- Tony’s life -- that he was playing with, and even if it didn’t mean anything to Tony himself, Steve couldn’t think of anything more important to him.
Thank you so so much for reading. This was a long and painful road but I feel really proud of the writing I've accomplished here! I wanna thank Morphia my beta, encourager, hand holder etc...for being amazing throughout the entire thing. And most importantly I wanna thank all of you so much for reading. Leave a comment letting me know what you think thanks again for reading!
There’s a sudden quiet in the street below, and the only sound Tony can hear coming from the couple, are their feet carrying them away from whatever it was that just shook Stark Tower.
It’s a little absurd to assume there would be lube in the living room, so Steve pulls Tony’s legs from around his waist and presses them back until they’re flush against Tony’s chest, exposing Tony even more to Steve.
Tony’s face was on fire as he started down one of the rows. He could feel the cool air on his exposed cock, as he walked up and down the aisles like some sick office pervert. By the time he got back to the elevator he was leaking like a siv.
“Sincerest apologies,” JARVIS replied with something like sarcasm in his tone.
“Darling,” Tony greeted, a bright smile on his face.
Tony jumps back when he makes eye contact with his reflection. His once very normal, brown eyes are now a bright and glowing golden. He drops the razor, nearly catching his foot when it lands on the floor, buzzing.
Tony, for what seemed to be the hundredth time today, complied, but was a bit more satisfied with the climax he pulled from the soldier. Looking up at Steve, he wiped the come onto his fingers licked them clean, then proceeded to lick his lips.
“Tony!” Steve shouts, following the trail to Tony’s bedroom, and then into the adjoining bathroom.
Tony nods, bracing himself for the worst. This is it, Steve is a murderer, he’s got bodies in a freezer somewhere and Tony’s next.
“Why the hell else would I still be so desperate to talk to someone as ignorant as you?” Steve hisses.
Tony cats hips forward and he’s whining softly with head pressed back, throat exposed to Steve. his wolfish tendencies are still there despite his wolf’s disappearance. Steve is proud, Tony's showing signs of working with his wolf, rather than against him. Giving into animalistic desires, but still remaining control of himself, that had always been the key.
Chenny, nor am I Michael J. Fox.”
Tony moans, and he feels the same, a mutual feeling bouncing between the two of them, neither knowing where it starts or where it ends. It doesn’t matter much as Steve’s wrapping Tony’s legs around his waist and pulling him further down on the couch.
Tony follows, setting the mugs down and having a seat.
Tony turned when he heard Steve’s voice, started back toward the elevator but his legs gave out. Steve was about to go out and see if Tony was okay, maybe this was too much too soon and they needed to end this scene here. But then Steve saw Tony crawling toward him, and he knew the other was just fine.
When he arrives at work he’s hit with a familiar scent, and that’s strange. He takes a couple of sniffs before he sees a guard with a confused expression staring at him. He clears his throat, nods a greeting and heads toward the elevator that would take him to his office.
“You may not believe me now, but you’d better start paying attention to the signs. It’s not going to matter what you believe in a week when that full moon rises and a part of you comes out that you can’t control.”
Startled, Tony jumps at the sudden command, but finds himself following through without question. Once seated on a barstool, Tony growls. Before he can say anything, Steve’s approaching him.
Slowly, Tony began dragging himself on hands and knees beside Steve. He kept his head down, tried not to focus on the throbbing in his cock. It was swollen red now, itching for relief. Tony had a good view of it from down there.
“I should have told you,” Steve speaks through gritted teeth. Tony isn’t exactly sitting still for the conversation, but Steve knows he can hear his every word. Steve can feel every emotion Tony is, they’re bonded that way, even if they’re not truly mates.
“Good evening, Steve,” JARVIS greeted, same as he always did.
When he pulls into the lot, there are still a few cars. It’s an ideal time for fishing, for catching that last bit of sunlight at the shore of a lake. Tony doesn’t have time for any of it, he needs to run, his fingers tapping restlessly on the gear shift in his car.
“And the bite?” Steve looks on expectantly.
He allows himself a few moments to sob silently. He doesn’t have much of a pain tolerance, and with no one around to hear him he can grieve for a moment. When the moment passes, Tony takes a breath and looks up to the sky, he doesn’t have time for this, it’s getting late and the sun is almost completely gone from the sky.
“I’m leaving,” Tony says as he returns to the living room, all of his clothing in hand. “I want to thank you for your hospitality, your services will not go unrewarded. I’ll mail you back your pants.”
“Steve,” Tony gasps as Steve’s mouth works its way down Tony’s jaw to his exposed throat.
Tony swallowed down a retort, instead lifting his hips to meet each downward stroke, his breath became heavier. Steve thought he looked better this way, playing at the will of his hands and taking whatever he was given.
“Yes, Sir,” Tony rasped.
For a moment, Steve gives Tony a look of disbelief, he doesn’t even seem fazed by the kiss, and then it dawns on him. Maybe he's not the only one feeling this strange pull. Maybe the kiss didn’t feel wrong, or forced, or bad, because it wasn’t supposed to.
If she touches your arm again, I’m gonna rip her hand off -S
"Good afternoon, Captain Rogers," JARVIS greeted dutifully. The workshop door was locked and would remain that way until directed otherwise.
“Breathe,” Tony whispers to himself, his hands in clenched fists on either side of his head. He buries his face into the carpet and shuts his eyes. “Breathe…” he repeats, and he thinks about Steve.
“So stupid…” Tony mutters into the receiver, “was so so stupid, I should’ve listened…”
With a palm to his face, Steve continues, “we have a certain bond now. Tell me, how have you felt this past month?”
“So,” Steve starts as he scoops scrambled eggs and bacon onto his plate, motioning for Tony to help himself. “I saved your life, you slept in my bed, you’re wearing my pants, and you’re eating my breakfast. Do you think I deserve to know your name yet?” He asks, smiling around his forkful of food.
At 11:34 pm the two men returned.
And that's about all Steve can take. Tony had been nothing but aggravating and argumentative since he stepped foot into the house, and even Steve, with his saint-like patience, can only take so much.
“What the fuck?” Tony frowns as he viciously paws away the remaining fog on the mirror as if that would erase what's on his face.
“I haven’t lied to you yet, have I? And still you don’t trust me at all. Fine, I can live with that. I can’t force your trust, but you do need to listen to me, because that stunt in the bathroom? That’s just the beginning, and it’s nothing compared to what you’re going to experience in, oh,” Steve checks his watch, “five hours. That’s it, that’s all the time you have to stop denying that this is happening and just let go. Accept it, that’s all I ask. Come to terms with me, yourself, and your new wolf. Fighting him will only make him more agitated, and there is nothing worse than an agitated werewolf on the night of a full moon.”
Manhandling Tony was always easy when he was loose and pliant like this. Steve rolled him onto his side and slotted himself up against Tony’s back. For Tony, aftercare involved a lot of contact, and a little water.
“Yeah, more or less,” Steve shuts off the water then, and takes a deep breath, his eyes shut like he's trying to calm himself down. Tony wonders what he might’ve said wrong.
“Okay,” Tony shakes his head walking out from behind the bar. “Let’s get something straight, Fido, I don’t need anyone, least of all you.”
Steve didn’t lie; he gets there within the hour, which is quick considering the distance. JARVIS greets him in the lobby, and grants him access as allowed by Tony. Steve makes his way up to the penthouse floor as instructed by the AI.
“I don’t know! But I’m not going to sit here and listen to you talk this nonsense about werewolves! You’re insane if you expect me to believe that I got bit by a wolf, oh wait I’m sorry,” and by now Tony is standing, “I got bit by you and now I’m a werewolf. I’m not Lon
“You’re such a slut,” Steve smirked as he tightened his grip and tugged a little harder.
The elevator opened a few moments later, and Steve stepped in with his hands behind his back. Camera 27 B panned to meet his movements, zoomed as JARVIS tried to decipher what was hidden behind Steve’s back.
The lock clicked into place behind him.
They both knew this was getting them nowhere. Nevertheless, the voice in the back Steve's head chanted ‘Take control’ and wouldn't relent.
“Eggs were a little dry,” Tony says, watching Steve’s smile fade, “I’m just kidding, it was all very delicious. I can’t believe we finished all of it.”
A blond, shirtless man stands in the doorway then, Tony drinking in the sight of his wide shoulders, his toned torso, the way his sweats hang low on his hips. There's a kind smile on his face, hair in a sort of disarray that has Tony wanting to run his fingers through to tame the wild nature of it.
Unfortunately, on Sunday he'd woken up feeling exactly the same, and by Monday he isn’t any better. It’s something he can’t seem to shake no matter how many jugs of orange juice he consumes. He vows to visit the doctor if it keeps up and heads out to the office.
As Steve’s cock buried itself deep inside Tony, it seemed as though he pushed the air right out of his lungs. Tony deflated with a sharp exhale, hands still clutching his cheeks even as he relaxed into the movement.
A spike of anger shot through Tony at yet another failed attempt, which made Steve to smirk at his obvious frustration.
Tony pulled his face away and tucked himself back into his pants, he zipped himself back up, and quickly left the room, paperwork be damned.
The rest of the meal was spent in comfortable silence, Steve looking over a newspaper, Tony hadn’t seen a newspaper in years.
It takes everything in Tony’s power not to shove Steve right against the wall behind him. Ignorant? Who the hell does this guy think he is?
"Sir," JARVIS chimed in then. "Steve - heart emoji - is requesting you call him back as soon as possible. He's picking up dinner and is unsure which rice you prefer."
It’s the strangest thing, how Tony, without so much as opening his eyes, can tell how many strips, how long they’ve been cooked, and which particular brand it is. If he focuses hard enough, he can hear the sizzling sound from beyond the door, Tony’s mouth waters.
JARVIS ran surveillance on the office. The office didn’t have a lock on the door like the workshop, but there was an intern playing secretary outside the door. He'd take care of anyone attempting to bother Tony during his morning routine.
“Oh God,” Tony pulls the plug from the wall, the razor’s buzzing dying off before he hurries out of the bathroom, unable to stand the sight of himself anymore.
"Mr. Stark has asked not to be disturbed at this time. Would you care to leave a message?"
On Monday morning, Tony wakes up, shaves his face, takes a shower and grabs his first cup of coffee before heading out to the office. He’s not in a particularly good mood, considering the fact that it’s nine in the morning, but he’s feeling better than he has in a while and that’s something.
Without a word Tony went on to comply. It gave Steve some time to reach down his own pants and give himself a few good strokes. Since the car Steve had been hard as a rock and ready to go, but good things came to those who waited. This was about Tony for now, Steve would get his own.
Lucky for Steve, Tony’s just a pup in comparison to his thirty years of experience, so it’s easy enough to flip over, pinning the other man to the floor with hips and hands.
Once Steve was satisfied, he called Tony back to the elevator and the doors closed again. Steve crowded him once again, and Tony didn’t even flinch. He tilted his head back kept himself open and willing to whatever Steve wanted to do this time.
When they stepped into the lift, Tony hit the button for their shared penthouse suite on the top floor. Steve had other plans and reached out to pressed a few other buttons as well. One opened on the accounting level, one in HR, one was Tony’s own office floor, the workshop level, the recreation room for the team, and finally the penthouse.
Steve’s heart-beat is steady, and his mouth is set in a straight line, and his eyes are narrowed, determined to make Tony believe. There's such a long pause, Steve's not sure Tony would ever reply, and when he does, it's with a laugh.
Groaning, Tony rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head, smashing it against his ears to try and drown out the sound. It doesn’t work.
Inside the music cut off instantly, and Tony looked up surprised to find Steve in the door way. His expression softened when he saw him, but then he glanced at the clock. "You're early," Tony accused.
Tony was just trying to keep himself on kilter, but was it all too surprising for him. Steve pulled away in favor of pushing Tony against the conference table, coaxing a grunt from the genius. He looked as if he wanted to protest but Steve interrupted. "Don't. Just don't talk."
Steve wraps his hand around the wolf’s muzzle holding his mouth shut, his other hand keeps the wolf tight against his body.
“You feel it too, I know you do. The aches, the sleepless nights, the hallucinations, that’s our bond, it’s more than alpha and beta, it’s me and you. It’s Tony and Steve. So I need you to pull through this for me now. Latch on to this bond we’ve got and turn for me, I know you can. Make peace with this animal, he’s with you for the long haul, concentrate.”
Self-consciously the woman sniffs herself and shakes her head, “no.”
“Home,” Tony said leaning in for a kiss.
It was a fair question, and Steve smirked. He reached up and trailed knuckles down Tony’s cheek. “Don’t worry, you’ve only disobeyed once. Although, you can be such a slut when you want to be, can’t you?”
“Thanks, LeAnne,” Tony gives her a smile, and shuts his office door behind him.
“Steve?” Tony asked, looking up at the other confused.
Steve, naked now, stepped up to the bed. “No, but you will be. I thought the elevator would be more than enough punishment for you tonight, but apparently you want more. I think a spanking is in order. Ten should do the trick.”
“And you’re sure it got you?” Steve asks, “you’re sure the wolf bit you?”
“No, I don’t think that’s how this is going to play out. See, you’re the director, you tell me which direction you want this evening to go. And me?” Steve’s hand trailed further south, cupping Tony’s semi-hard cock through his pants, “I’m the commander, and you’ll do as you’re told.”
Rhodey barked a laugh, clutching his side as Tony scowled at the nearest ceiling mounted camera. "Betrayed by your own tech, that's a new low even for you."
“Look, I said I was sorry for that. I can’t go back and change that night. I- My wolf made a mistake.” To be fair, Tony had thrown a rock at the animal, but that's not important now. “So now we have to live with our mistakes, okay?”
At first JARVIS was alarmed, they were in a rush, both men’s pulses were racing. They moved frantically from the elevator to the bedroom, stumbling along the way. They remained close, even with night vision cameras JARVIS was unable to ascertain if there was reason for intervention.
Steve sighs, and he feels for Tony, really he does, but he’s done all he can, and now it’s up to Tony to pull through.
“Please, Commander Rogers, please let me come.”
“Sappy,” Tony chided with a laugh. “But beautiful, red roses are a classic. Here, no—don’t hand them…I’ve got a vase here.”
“Rhetorical question, JARVIS. Maybe the red will look better,” he huffed softly.
“Oh!” Tony’s eyes widen, he didn’t even realize he hadn’t introduced himself yet. “I’m sorry, I completely forgot. I’m Tony, Tony Stark, yes. That’s me.”
“JARVIS,” Tony said. Steve jerked back, looking down at Tony like he was nuts. “Activate sleep mode.”
Tony gets two pages into a google search about werewolves before calling bullshit and slamming the laptop shut. He can’t believe he’d even go so far as to search it.
Despite the shower he’d just taken, JARVIS was picking up on a higher than usual body temperature resulting in stress sweat. That wouldn’t make for an attractive first date. That, of course, was what Tony was so worried about tonight. He’d had it on his calendar in bold, with several alarm reminders so he didn’t lose track of time or forget.
