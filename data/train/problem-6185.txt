been having sex pretty often for
"You are not jealous of a–"
The tense moment passed when Rhodes decided to redirect his gaze to Tony again. "You better call me in the morning, or I'm calling Pepper."
“So, should I give him a call?”
In conclusion, even Captain America, hero of war, national icon, Boy Scout Magnificent (as Tony would call him), and proud leader of the greatest superhero team in all history could admit:
already talked with Tony about, and he really didn’t appreciate Rhodes referring to it as if it was something that Tony couldn’t change. That he HAD changed a long time ago.  It was as if the Colonel was trying to say something that Steve didn’t appreciate. “What are you trying to s–”
“So you’re doing this for Tony?”Rhodes asked skeptical.
“Steve, nothing happened.” He reassured quickly before Steven could tighten his hold even more. “We just danced and talked until I got murderous thoughts. And then some more.”
Maybe not the last part, but the colonel knew Tony appreciated him in his own weird way.
. There was simply no other option, all their ‘one night stands’, all their misunderstandings, their martyr behaviour, their talks, their shared moments, the way they overcame every obstacle together... it was enough proof of the feelings that swam between them. It wasn’t just sex for them, they both had their fair share of casual sex to mistake what they did with anything other than love-making. “I came here because Tony is stubborn and self-destructive and it doesn’t seem that he will ever be honest about it. I want to know why.”
Steve knew it was just a matter of time before he found out the reason behind the Colonel's latent resentment; after all, it was bound to happen at some point. What surprised and embarrassed him was that it took him so long to figure it out.
“They could be a paparazzi stunt, you know how they–”
Instead, Tony thought the question over. Boring video conference, even more boring paperwork, brief crisis over Steve not wanting a family with him, then quickly resolved by some communication which led to a rather wholesome bonding bathtime and then falling asleep watching shitty cartoons about a family of pigs. Ten years ago, a day like that might have made him want to jump into oncoming traffic. God, ten years ago just having to think about a baby being in his care would have probably brought him out in hives.
something. It doesn’t have to be expensive. Get him something related to an inside joke, or something that you know is important to him. It don’t gotta be no diamond ring. Tony doesn’t give a shit about that and you know it.”
It was okay though. It was manageable.
Steve spluttered a bit more, flailing his hands. “I- I mean, yes, but…”
“Stay with Tony,” Rhodey told Bruce, squaring his shoulders and then grabbing one of the spears Natasha had spent hours crafting. Tony watched Natasha move as well, picking up her knife and turning to Rhodey.
And get on with it Steve did, because by the time the movie was over Tony’s whole forearm was covered with little doodles. Flowers and patterns and cartoon Avengers spattering across his skin, painting a lovely picture as to what exactly went on in Steve’s head.
His breath stopped half-way through his mouth, and he felt himself stiffen up.
“Sorry,” Steve grinned as he hoisted his shield back up onto his arm, “couldn’t help it.”
No, no. They still had time. They still had… it’d be fine. Tony was thin, he was injured, but he’d be okay. He could walk through hell and be okay, that was just who Tony was. Steve nodded to himself, and maybe everyone else thought that was finally some sort of acknowledgement that Tony might not be coming home, but they were wrong. It was Steve promising himself that he
“Look, I’m calling it a night,” Clint said, after Steve didn’t respond to his previous statement. He got to his feet quietly and looked between Steve and Tony, a pained expression in his eyes. “You look after one another, ‘kay?” He said, gently punching Steve’s shoulder. “You need eachother.”
“SHIELD have any non-bulletproof windows we can smash through?” Tony responded, cradling his arm in his good hand, “in fact, maybe if we just got to the outskirts of the building it would be enough. I don’t know. Would you happen to have any idea where the blocker is coming from?”
Steve harrumphed sulkily, but stepped back—of course, not before he’d nipped his fingers under the towel around Tony’s waist and quickly tugged it off with a flourish. Tony just eyed him from the reflection of the mirror, but Steve didn’t notice. Too busy staring at other parts of Tony’s anatomy. “You’re an asshole.”
Steve bit his lip. “No.”
He swallowed and pursed his lips, rolling his head to the side and looking at Tony, who was curled up like a hedgehog just under Steve’s shoulder. Seeing as Steve probably hadn’t moved a muscle for an hour, Tony had not even been remotely disturbed, and was comfortably tucked into Steve’s side, one hand resting slack across his midsection while the other lay slack against his chest. Steve smiled softly at him, taking a few more deep breaths as he steadied himself back into reality.
It wasn’t important. Just some people he had to hang out with for six hours a day and then forget about as soon as he was gone. He ignored the laughing from the boys behind him.
Steve was already up and running once more, racing over to the little hut about twenty paces away from where Rhodey and Nat had gone down. It was a tiny thing, and the one single window at the left of the door had been blown in. Steve scrambled for the metal handle and lifted his gun. If there was a single HYDRA logo in the room, Steve was going to riddle it with lead.
Steve adored it.
But Tony must have registered that, because he grunted. “No… m’good. Swear.”
“Tell that to the pockmarks on his arms from where he shot up last night in a drug den,” Thor snapped, before just raising his hands in defeat and sighing. “Sorry. Sorry. Let’s not talk about my wayward brother tonight, hmm? I’ll yell at him tomorrow. For now!” He raised his sippy cup (Steve didn’t even want to know why he had that in his house) full of mead and then beamed. “Let us drink and be merry!”
Tony didn’t want to open his eyes. He didn’t trust himself to see what was actually in front of him if he did. And on any other occasion, he would rather have died a thousand fiery deaths than ever try and let Steve coddle him when he was like this- he was a capable hero and absolutely able to deal with this all on his own, thank you very much- but now wasn’t any other occasion. Steve was already in here with him, and Tony… Tony trusted him, dammit. He’d be useful. He wasn’t going to hurt Tony, and so Tony couldn’t quite find it in him to say no.
“That’s fucking irrelevant,” Tony snarled, fists clenching,
Hauling himself upright, he informed the team briefly of his plan, waiting for their approval until leaving. They knew Tony’s state even better than Steve did and agreed almost instantly, trusting Steve to know what he was doing while they remained indoors and nursed their wounds, all of them huddled protectively around Tony’s unconscious form.
Fury began in, well, fury- but both the boys just ignored him, turning to face one another.
“Listen, at the very least, it’s a way to spend a Tuesday morning that’s more fun than Cap’s training routines,” Clint said with a shrug, tossing a couple of peanuts into his mouth. “And hey, with War Machine there point about seventeen different weapons their way, I’m pretty sure most of them peed themselves a little bit, which was an added bonus.”
“We should get icecream,” he declared, whilst the other half of his brain groaned in despair and cringed wildly. “I feel like I owe you at least an icecream. A thank-you-for-not-abandoning-me-at-a-stranger’s-party icecream.”
Tony kept his glare for a moment, staring at Steve, the last attempt to fight off an emotional conversation he didn’t want to have. Steve, of course, didn’t waver. He never had, and Tony didn’t think he ever would. Not when it came to things like this.
“So what you’re saying is… that all of us must be rational or Tony would be already dead?” asked Steve honestly confused. It did make sense in some twisted kind of way, but not enough for him to link it to the topic.
Even with all of his resolve and annoyance at her negative persistence, listening to her uninterrupted point of view over the subject made something inside Steve turn with dread. He definitely didn’t want to think of the possibility that her words were true and all he has been doing is pining after an idea that simply wasn’t there.
“And you like that?” he asked with honest curiosity. Steve didn’t really know if Tony was enthusiastic about his so-called righteousness. Even if he didn't feel all that righteous right now.
“They shouldn't do that, it is too early to vote for the movies we're watching tonight,” Steve couldn’t help but feel indignation. Really, what some of the Avengers wanted to watch baffled him, still. Well, it was more Clint and Logan than the rest of them, but with fewer votes in favour of sanity, more the chances to get stuck with two indescribable movies, "Where are they now?"
“What? Wait! Steve, don't let them drag me away! I want to stay here and help undress Steve a little more. Steve! Help!” Tony yelled after him, the girls didn’t even seem winded at his struggles and started a conversation between them as if Tony was just the purse they were dragging around, “These girls look like they are plotting something wicked! Hurry, assemble the team!”
Used to listen to the faraway whisper that was his conscience, Steve couldn't help but recognize its voice reminding him that if Rhodes hadn’t found Tony in that dessert in the middle of nowhere, he wouldn’t be kissing the best thing that’s ever happened to him in that moment.
Oh. That was… perfect, actually. “Yeah,” Steve said with another smile, “yeah, I’d like that. You might have to wait in your car for a bit though- I’m five minutes out myself, so you’ll probably get there before me anyway.”
this fucking car?”
Eventually, though, he fell into the zone. Driven by determination and anger and a dozen other emotions, Tony worked voraciously through the hours, first doing the research and checking out any similar contents on the web, then working off that in order to make his own. He’d never made a website or blog before, but he knew the basics of it, and he knew how he wanted it to be laid out.
“I don’t know how to be a good dad,” he’d said, fear and bitterness in his voice as they’d looked at the adoption agencies, “I never… everyone always says I’m just like my old man, but if that’s true, I couldn’t—
What, did he think Tony was going to flinch or something? Fucking hell. “Just take the fucking shoe off, Steve. Please.”
She leaped into his arms freely, and with a small laugh he caught her easily, hoisting her up onto his hip. “Hey squirt,” he replied, giving her a quick kiss on the forehead as he stepped further through the corridor, “is your father trying to make dinner again?”
Steve raised a hand and stepped back at the same time Thor stepped forward. “No.”
Steve swore to god, Bruce Banner had the patience of a saint.
“Sorry,” Steve let go, embarrassed, “I just… your knuckles-“
For a moment, Steve couldn’t tell if it was the helicarrier on SHIELD, or the train running through the mountains.
Steve smiled, sitting down gently on the bed. Now Tony was actually here to speak to, Steve wasn’t all that sure of what to say. “Are you back home now?” He asked eventually as his eyes flicked over to the clock, “or are you staying with Thor? Please stay with Thor, Tony, just for a few nights-“
. He was touching Steve, after all this time, after all those battles, after Steve had questioned whether or not they’d ever be able to bring Tony back home.
Clint just waved a hand and flopped back onto the rug. “Remember reschmember. S’all love in this house, baby.”
By the end of the call, Steve was having to persuade Sam not to bunk off school to come help out. “Your mom will literally go nuts,” Steve told him with a half-laugh that was tinted with nervousness, “she already must think I’m completely off the rails, I don’t want her to think I’m dragging you down with me as well.” When Sam sounded as if he was going to argue, Steve continued. “Anyway, I don’t think… I think it’d be hard for Tony. To see people, and know that they know. Even if it’s you. He doesn’t…”
“No,” Tony said firmly, shaking his head and looking down, quickly plucking the bottle from Peter’s hands before the boy could throw it uncaringly onto the bed. “No, I need to… I can track them fastest. I’ll be okay.”
She walked forward, and Steve’s eyes widened as he raised his hands in defense and stepped further behind Sam- but she seemed not to notice, instead just curling her hand around one of Steve’s raised hands and then pulling him back into the kitchen with excitement. Steve turned and looked a little helplessly back at Sam, but the bastard just laughed and then wandered after them, not a care for Steve’s pleading eyes.
Bucky’s face turned incredulous, and he whipped his head around to Steve. “What the f-“
It was the paternal little goblin in his brain, just desperate for a reason to call them a family. Hell—if Peter looked like anyone, it was probably Tony. They had the same hair and, according to Natasha, the same ears. Not that he’d really paid much attention to Peter’s ears. Or his own, for that matter.
The boy lasted a grand total of two seconds before agreeing to drive Steve home.
Steve cocked his head and squinted. Thor shrugged, leaning in. “There are few people who care much about Tony. But those who do, do not do it by halves. Myself included. Although I shall refrain from the threats, considering I know you well and doubt you have any malevolent intentions toward my friend. The other two, though, may not be so sparing.”
So instead, he curled his hand around Tony’s neck and he kissed back.
He paused for a moment and then huffed. “When that didn’t work, I pulled out my A-game and told him you needed as much support you could get, and if he cared about you at all, he’d stick around and look out for you.”
“Please?” Steve looked at him earnestly, his blue eyes startlingly clear from where Tony was sat, a few short centimetres between them. “We can make out with each other while something else plays in the background.”
Steve laughed loudly and yanked his other slipper off in order to throw that one too. “Tell him he can go fuck himself, fuckhead!” he yelled.
“Yeah, I noticed,” Steve laughed with Tony, fingers skating up and down Tony’s hand, handkerchief mostly forgotten by that point, “although his brother sounds like a bit more of a handful.”
“No,” Steve said bluntly, “it’s about Peter.”
He tried not to let the words sink too deep under his skin, or he knew he’d drown in the weight of it. Just looked at Tony and let that anchor him instead- the sense of a shared experience, a shared weight on both of their shoulders.
“Ah- Glad you asked,” Peggy said, sitting up instantly and jumping off the bed, hair falling into her eyes as she leaned over Bucky’s desk and grabbed his laptop. “We’re going to do some detective work.”
“You ready?” Bucky asked him quietly, and Steve cocked his head a little, keeping his eyes on the target ahead as he shrugged.
Again, Steve said nothing. Wasn’t quite sure what to say about the fact a 12-year-old had just laid Tony Stark’s entire character out like that, all for him.
“Nightmares, I assume,” Tony broke the silence, and Steve… didn’t acknowledge the sound had been made at all.
Tony’s hands found a ledge.
Please don’t leave where I can’t follow, not ever. Not ever.
Clint was the only one to acknowledge any of it all. Steve wasn’t stupid; he knew that Clint had a knife stashed up his sleeve, in the same way that Natasha had the day before. He knew Steve knew, too, because as soon as he clocked Steve looking at it, he sighed. It was late into the night, and Tony was sleeping peacefully in the bed in front of them. “I know this is horrible,” Clint told him quietly, “I know this is hurting you. Watching us do this. I couldn’t imagine what it must be like.”
Steve shot him a look, part frown, part fond exasperation as he kissed Tony again. “We go through this every year, babe. Yes, I remembered your birthday. I’m slightly offended that you thought I
“Well, to be honest- if we get caught in the blast now, then it’s probably gonna be the equivalent of being hit by a brick wall,” Tony frowned, cocking his head and looking over to it, “fortunately- it takes a while for it to garner all that energy. And seeing as we aren’t lucky enough to be wearing HYDRA’S reinforced uniforms, I’m just gonna have to work fast, aren’t I?”
. Honestly. Nothing a good rest and a few painkillers won’t fix.”
Creeping down the stairs quickly, he did up his coat and then grabbed his keys off the side before opening the door as quietly as he could. The night was pitch black but fairly warm- not too bad. At least Tony wouldn’t freeze.
“…‘Bout’ta a week and a half ago,”
Steve said nothing. It was beginning to rain, and he felt a splash against his nose as he ducked back into Thor’s apartment complex. “Did he manage to get anything before he left?” Steve asked, beginning to climb the stairs and making sure not to knock JARVIS—or JARVIS’ shell, anyway—against the walls.
Steve just blinked. “No you’re not,” he said.
'What did I do to deserve you?'
Mr Wilson laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. “I’d be a bit of a bastard if I didn’t let my son have his boyfriend over sometimes, wouldn’t I?” He said with a smile, before ruffling Steve on the head and then beginning to walk out of the living room. “Just make sure to get enough sleep, Steve. It’s school tomorrow.”
“Ah. You’re awake.”
Peter had the whole team wrapped around his stubby little finger, and none of them even cared. It was… weird. But a good sort of weird. A
He saw Natasha and Clint as he did a quick once-over of the deck, and Clint did a little salute before swinging the butt of his pistol across the temple of some poor HYDRA soldier. Steve grinned back.
There was another tense silence once he’d spoken, during which Steve prayed to whoever was listening that she would do this for him. Then, after what felt like an eternity packed into a second, she huffed. “Fine. Text me when you’re ready.” Without saying goodbye, the phone went dead. Steve figured that was her way of saying she was pissed, but willing to cooperate.
“-ve, Steve? Can you hear me?”
It’s not like Tony would ever say no to a request when Steve said it like that.
Tony stared at him blankly for a moment and then scoffed. “Like hell you’re drinking my booze,” he said with a shake of his head.
Tony slapped him away weakly, pointing to the machine. “But Steve. Steeeeve. It… it hasn’t stopped moving yet. I wanna watch it stop.”
The man only grinned, dropping into a roll and then slamming a molten fist into Tony’s chest, sending him backward again. “We have different skillsets,” Cass informed him, “I’m freelance. And prettier.”
“Yeah yeah,” Natasha rolled her eyes, leaning back and then huffing when Tony squeezed Steve’s hand reassuringly. “God, I feel like we’ve just opened up Pandora’s box with this whole ‘Steve & Tony’ thing.”
“So… what do we do now?” Bruce asked the room, voice quiet and serious. They all shared looks with one another, and then one by one turned their eyes onto Peter, tucked into Tony’s arms. The whole baby-element was, admittedly, way out of their comfort zone. But hey- at least now they had AIM to contest with, and AIM were
, and I was just thinking..." he broke off, shaking his head. " -And yeah. I was an asshole and I shouldn’t have-“
want me to stay the night?” He responded with, having to drag his gaze away from Tony’s mouth in order to look at his eyes instead. Ever the gentlemen.
“I’ve been going to therapy,” he blurted, nodding once, “and I… I can talk about her, now. But it’s still so lonely, you know? And my apartment’s gone to shit because you know me, I never fucking clean, I eat alone every lunch and I miss you so much it fucking
that’s how emotionally stunted he is.
And hell- despite Sam’s presence on top of him, he still managed to feel sort of… weightless.
“Love you too. Even though your feet kinda smell.”
Muscle memory. Like amnesiacs that still remembered how to drive cars or shoot a hoop correctly. Flying the suit was intrinsic to him. He could do this. And then, maybe he could get to stay on the team. He just needed Iron Man back.
“We’ll sort it,” Steve told him with a nod of his head, eyes determined, “we’ll get Iron Man back, Tony. I promise.”
Tony chuckled darkly; the first sign that he’d been following the conversation at all. “Yeah. Literally,” he mumbled,
Bruce looked at him dryly, and then without speaking, lifted his hands and made a length of approximately 8 inches between them. “That’s why.”
I love ballet dancer tony with all my fucking heart this has no context i just love it
Curious and a little excited, Tony read through the last line.
“Well, you can thank our friendly visitors for that, “ he heard Tony reply, hands reaching for the pie and then ripping open the lid, “they were the ones who went and sat on the goddamn power grid.”
Tony looked at him; the confused way he was staring between Tony’s face and the bag in his hand. Tony supposed that this was for the best anyway- he had to face the music someday. But the worst thing was, more than anything, he just wanted to drop the whole idea. Even now. Even when he knew that he couldn’t live like this, part of him didn’t even care. Part of him would take the pain, just for the chance to get Steve when he was good and happy. Part of him- a terribly, humiliatingly large part of him- thought that would be worth it.
“The whole ‘oh, I’m Tony Stark and I can do what I want because no one explicitly told me otherwise’ thing,” Steve said harshly, standing up from the desk and walking over to him. His eyes were slightly bloodshot, confirming that he hadn’t been getting much sleep.  “Do you know how worried I was? I was Goddamn seconds away from going out there and looking for you myself. I called seven times, Tony, and you didn’t answer.”
and ‘
“I’m pretty sure I do, Steve.”
Steve was shaking. He was shaking and his eyes were wet, and he looked up at Tony, ashen and exhausted. “I think we need to break up,” he said softly.
“Of course. There is no one else in this house who could possibly have taught me the conversational values of sarcasm,” JARVIS said, of course, sarcastically. Tony laughed. Definitely his creation, that was for sure.
He stirred, breathing in softly and feeling Tony’s hand trace a line from neck to abdomen, fingers stroking across the bumps of his muscle. Tony was pressed close already, his bare leg tangled up in Steve’s own, and when Steve shifted to roll onto his back, he made sure to pull Tony along with him so that he lay spread across Steve’s chest. He pushed his sleepy eyes open and watched Tony grin down at him. “Morning,” he muttered with a sly grin, dropping down to kiss Steve’s neck again.
“Wait,” he stopped them both in the center of the room, which, in hindsight, was probably not the most subtle or Generally Great way of doing things, “are you fucking hitting on me?”
After a few more rounds of Jan’s advice and a lot of inner-meditating to increase his already unbelieving patience, Steve thought he was ready to face Rhodes. When he left the tower with intentions of taking a cab, he was surprised to find Happy Hogan waiting for him with Tony’s business limo behind him running and ready. Steve was suddenly nervous by the unexpected arrival of the ex-boxer; it could mean that he was about to be threatened by the chauffeur at the first opportunity.
“I love you so much that it hurts.” Tony continued when some air got into his own lungs, “Sometimes I can’t believe I haven’t died yet over how much it hurts me to listen to you saying you love me over and over and not being able to say it back, no matter how much I yearned for it. I’m so sorry, Steve, this is all my fault. I shouldn’t have let us get this far; I should have pushed you away the first time we kissed right on this couch.”
“No, he stated that clearly enough himself.” He murmured a little angrily. “I just want to know what would you suggest to be a good approach with him so he’d stop insulting me for an instant and start to actually listening to what I have to say. And of course I would be willing to listen to what he has to say in return.” He added quickly.
“Well, I thought it wasn’t necessary considering that I wasn’t a defenseless victim enduring your evil harassment since I was striking right back at you, Steve. We are both guilty.”
“POPS!”
“I was tired of you denying me,” Steve whispered with regret in his voice, ”I can see the truth in these wonderful eyes, yet you are never honest with me. I tried everything but in your stubbornness, you wouldn’t consider
“When you’re right, you’re fucking right, I’ll give you that;” he commented while shaking his head in surrender. “I should talk to Steve about it.”
“Fine!” he exclaimed loudly with resignation. “I told him you’re nothing but a charade; that the instance you got out of the ice you decided that you were too much for this world but you were going to grant us the
“Sorry.” He whispered sincerely, soothed by Tony’s touch and sarcasm when once upon a time it would’ve surely triggered another fight.
“How stupid do you think I am?” The super soldier asked annoyed, uncrossing his arms to curl his fingers into fists. "I know he is here, Rhodes."
“Hey, I don’t even know for sure if he was cheating on me–”
When Rhodey first met Tony, he was pretty much scandalized about the flow of published words that described in detail a particularly shocking photo, but as he got to actually know him more and he started to actually
Normally, he would've taken a more proper attire to venture the woods, however he was late already so he'd decided to let his shoes to ruin and he'd only taken the time to cover his royal red and gold garments with a long, black hood that also sheltered his head and matched his trousers.
So! I wasn't sure to post this chapter two as it is. First, because the first part was already published in the one-shot, and second, because of the explanation of the power of the name thing. Why? because that plays a role in the looong story, but it won't have much meaning in the few chapters I'm going to upload. At the end, I decided to put almost everything as it is as a promise to myself that I'll keep writing and finish this one day. Hope you don't mind that nor the cliffhanger!
If there was any doubt in his mind about what he was about to do, it was totally whipped out just for the thought of no more if’s alone, even if it was for a few hours at the most.
“Let my husband go. Now.” Steve ordered immediately. So,
“Do we even have a cavalry for these kinds of things?” Steve asked disbelievingly.
“What is?”
“No, Rhodey, we are talking about the sport section where my cricket team lost big time against the weather.” Tony replied with a tone that screamed sarcasm. “Yes! We are fucking talking about that article!”
was close.” Anthony tried to make light of the situation the moment he was able to use the oxygen for more than just panting loudly while trying to remove all the splatters of blood on his face with his sleeve. His heart was still beating a mile per hour; he even felt a little faint but he wouldn’t admit that even under torture. Besides, the spell protecting the cottage was more than enough to fend off the whole wolf-pack and then some.
"Yeah, whatever. It's not like this was going to last or anything."
crazy.
In Tony-speak that meant:
At this, Rhodes looked a little startled. For once, Steve noticed he didn’t immediately find the words to throw him off, so he grabbed the opportunity and continued;
The guest even had the gall to smile leeringly at the prince and looked incredibly pleased with the turn of events. He then positioned Anthony so he properly sat on the horse. The moment the prince was arranged as the Lord wanted, he surrounded him with his arms more tightly than necessary.
He really should start to call Tony’s friends more often if this was the response he was likely to get.
Steve needed a few seconds to process the question and try not to stutter when he answered. “Nothing, I was-”
“Are you taking that to Tony?” Natasha asked while staring at him with an elegant, raised eyebrow as she buttered her bagel. She already knew the answer, of course, but it was her way of letting him know that she knew he was up to something.
Queen Maria Collins Carbonell of Stark had been quite the character not only within the world of humans, but in the magic realm as well. She'd been the first human, never mind beta, to be the head of the white fairy foundation, The White Court, which had granted her the Grater Name of the White Queen between the humans. Her contributions to the city had been full of helpful magic and human kindness; everyone in the kingdom had loved her and had mourned her death sincerely.
“Again with the same argument. I know enough, so fuck the hell off before I for my gun, Rogers.”
call me.” He stated with fake-resentment, eyes dancing.
Steve couldn't stand still anymore and before he knew it, he was on his feet with his hands tightly curled in fists, walking in small circles and ready to punch something into another dimension where not even Reed would find it.
“Yes.” Steve stated while he resisted averting his eyes from Rhodes’ who was still staring, or scowling, at him without blinking. Steve thought it was important to maintain eye contact, especially after finally realizing that the Colonel’s problem with him was probably because he didn’t like sharing Tony. The stare only got worse when Tony put his arms around Steve’s waist as if he wouldn’t let go no matter what.
Unable to stop himself, Steve elaborated further, "We finally had an honest talk and we agreed that we are in a committed relationship from now on." Tony's elbow digging into his ribs was well deserved and Steve endured it.
“Then,
When Steve's and Tony's brain got over the fact that they apparently have been very obvious in their little drama, and finally caught to what was actually being asked of them, the serum took over their lips and instantly answered the little brunette.
“I just want you to know that.” Steve lied smoothly. But maybe not so much considering the skeptical look he was receiving from Tony.
was almost out of his lips when he received a stronger jab on his ribs, taking some air from his lungs. He masked the choked sound by coughing a little, not that these people would pay attention to him when all eyes, including his, were on the pair walking towards the thoroughbred stud, who neighed at their approach.
Taking advantage of Tony’s obedient daze, Steve quickly got rid of his shirt for the brunette and then he went straight to Tony’s pants, unbuttoning them and yanking them out of the way along with the useless black underwear. He manoeuvred Tony to fully seat on his lap with his legs straddling him.
“You were
“I will,” Anthony agreed easily and denying nothing. This whole wolves experience hadn’t been easy for him either; his heart was still beating a little off rhythm. “Steve, love, you won’t lose me. As far as I don’t lose you, of course; you can’t expect this to be just me pinning after you while-”
are the one who had no right to set me up with some girl! What the hell were you thinking?!”
“Man, you’re going to make me cry,” James commented while fake wiping his face, but never losing the soft look on his eyes. “You really do love him, don’t you?”
As I explained in another one of my stories, I'm still in the quest for making my stories a little more legible by spliting chapters and getting a beta. I don't know how that last one works, so meanwhile, I'll split this story and keep counting on you guys to help me improve my stories.
No further conversation could be said after those weird, romantic moments between them when they bared their hearts out and just made the other aware with simple, but at the same time complicated, words what they meant for each other. They left behind the sarcasm and playful banter and they just made sure that the other was as happy as they were feeling.
This was one of the things Steve loved about visiting Tony to the workshop: his banter with Jarvis was always fun to witness. Steve allowed himself a fond smile without daring to move from his spot and cause them to stop.
“As thrilling as that offer is, I do not think it-” Anthony started now bluntly putting a hand on the other man’s chest to push himself away.
of a third wheel than he felt right now. Probably even jealous. Which he wasn’t. Really. “I’m here for you as well, Rhodey; my need to annoy you sustains my sanity, even if I suck at showing it,” Tony murmured,
“It seems that the Avengers were gathered around the living room inquiring about yours and Captain Rogers’ whereabouts before they decided to take advantage of your absence this morning and selected the movies that will be displayed this evening, forgoing both your votes.”
Then he remembered: No more
“He would.” The super soldier agreed.
Naturally, Steve beamed, “Thank you, Colonel. You don’t know how much this means t-”
“Hey, my fan club is awesome! At a safe distance, of course. They pulled me out of prison once.” At Steve’s incredulous
“Yes, I will help you, but I won’t do a normal truth serum,” She answered resignedly, and before Steve could protest, she continued, “This is the third difficulty, even if he took a truth serum, he would have the choice to remain silent; as long as he does not speak, the truth would be hidden.” At the blonde’s frustrated expression, she awkwardly touched his shoulder as if in a weak attempt to comfort him, “So that’s why, after hearing what you really want, I am going to prepare for you an Honesty Serum. It will take longer, about three days, but I think it's better.”
“Hey, Rhodey, come on, cut me some slack here, man.” Tony’s muffled yell could be easily identified as persuasive. It wasn’t like James was anywhere near him to fall for that. Besides, he had heard it an infinity of times before and he was pretty much immune. “Just give us ten minutes and we’ll–”
“Definitely, but only until Rhodes arrived, then he handled it pretty well.”
“Bucky, snap out of it!” Steve ordered before anything could escalate as he slapped his friend in a swift movement.
, I fucking didn’t give you any sort of pass to order me around. You are just trying to take it without asking me. This is not the battlefield, I don't have to do anything if I don't want to. I gave you nothing and I won't give you anything, so let me go. Let
He shook his head and gently laid Tony down.
“Come on, it’s bed-time for you,” he muttered, finally getting them into the elevator. “Which floor?”
“Wash your mouth with soap and sulphur, you philistine, you don’t recognise the choreographic genius when he graces you with his presence,” Tony was saying, every syllable perfectly pronounced in that posh New York accent of his, but the way he was leaning on the bar was decidedly tipsy.
“You don’t?”
“Oh, come on, Cap. One night. The team deserves some R and R, a chance to unwind. Even
He kept his eyes closed, his teeth gritted against a shout, mouth pressed to Tony’s skin. Oh, just like that, just-
His eyes were drawn back to Tony, to his olive skin and soft hair. He smelled of some exotic body wash, nothing like the army issued grey soap, nothing like the stale air of the Brooklyn apartment. Steve leaned closer and breathed him in.
His fingers grazed a nipple, pebbled from the cold, and Tony sighed, long and low.
“Sir’s bedroom is on the top floor,” a voice from- from
Tony grumbled and shifted again, rolling onto his side, a bit further, one leg rising at the knee, leaving him lying half on his stomach, one arm flung up, the other curled close. He looked different like that, without his sharp suits and sharper words. He looked- warm. Human.
Only he didn’t want to.
he needed pain medication, the arrogant, brave fool… Steve leaned closer still and carefully kissed one of the bruises, let his lips linger against the damaged skin.
“Jesus, Tony. You can’t drink after taking medication, it dangerous and-“
, God, the ice-
He touched it softly.
and, oh my God, what would he be like
Steve sat a bit away, a drink in his hand, just the one. He couldn’t get drunk anyway, so all that good alcohol would just be wasted on him. He watched others relax, bit by bit, watched Natasha stop checking exit points every few minutes and Bruce’s shoulders slowly lower. He kept half an eye on Clint, who seemed determined to occupy every high point in the cavernous living room, and there were quite a few of these, really, what did Tony need all that space
He slipped a bit to the side, one leg still thrown over Tony’s slim hips, against the wetness he left there. He kissed anywhere he could reach, the shoulder, the knobby spine, the proud neck. Oh, Tony…
“I think you’ve had enough,” Steve said, coming over and gently taking Tony under the elbow.
Steve blinked.
It happened after the invasion in NY, after the fight and the atomic bomb and the shawarma. Once they had secured Loki for the foreseeable future, had gone through the debrief, the press release, the medical examination…
, oh- Yes,
“I rego- reco- I know a pissed git when I see one,” Clint muttered, stealing one of the remaining bottles and sliding away. Tony tried to stop him and overbalanced, almost falling over.
Steve didn’t mean to do this.
Oh, God. One night, Tony had said, one night to rest. Didn’t he deserve that as well? For all the people and things he had lost, didn’t he deserve this one good thing?
Tony’s skin
more than this. Must be the pills they gave me.”
Tony sighed, low and long. He had to like that. In whatever dream he was, he had to enjoy Steve’s attention, his reverent exploration.
please, the next time-
Steve kissed back towards the centre of his back, let himself taste the firm muscle there. So warm, so pliant. His hand drifted down, to the small of Tony’s back, to the silky boxers. He slipped one finger under, between the soft material and the warm skin. God, so warm. He had to close his eyes and take a deep breath. The air tasted of Tony.
Talking elevators. Huh.
“Pills?” Steve asked sharply, turning Tony towards him. “What pills?”
Into Tony’s bedroom.
, smack in the middle of the room, the sheets gleaming smoothly, probably worth more than his yearly pay.
“Miss Potts expressed concerns regarding privacy.”
Slowly, carefully, he eased Tony’s boxers down, over his bottom and down his legs, completely off. That left Tony lying before him on his stomach, legs slightly parted, nude and warm and welcoming.
Tony didn’t squeeze back. How could he? How could he do
there was a party, with loud music and dancing lights and alcohol. Really extraordinary amounts of alcohol, if anyone asked Steve.
He moved closer, kicking off his shoes and settling further on the bed, kneeling on it, against Tony’s hip, over him. His hands moved slowly lover, over the bruised sides, careful, Tony could be suffering from bruised ribs, no
. It vibrated under his fingers, just the tiniest bit, probably too faintly for a normal human to notice. Did Tony notice? Could he feel its pulse in his chest?
Steve’s hips jerked again, just a bit closer, just a bit
His hand slipped under the material, along the shapely bottom, always so well defined by Tony’s formal suits. It fit his palm just right, filled it perfectly. As if Tony was made for him.
“And there are other people around to handle it,” Tony interrupted, putting a tumbler full of whiskey in his hand. “Emergency services, national guard, SHIELD agents, Santa’s little elves. People trained to deal with this shit. We did our part, we deserve a party. The most fantastic, the most exclusive party ever-“
Steve froze. He realised he was sitting on the bed, leaning over Tony, over
Tony sighed under him and he felt it against his own chest, felt Tony’s back move slightly with each breath. Expanding, contracting, back and forth, just a tiny movement, but it sent electrical sparks down his spine, all the way to his toes. Back and forth, under him, warm and alive. Back and forth. His nose was buried in Tony’s hair, his mouth found his ear, the delicate curve of it, the dark space behind.
“Thank you?” Steve tried, looking around the empty cabin.
“’ Course I can, I just did,” Tony patted him on the shoulder, slow and uncoordinated.
, just touching. Skin on skin, everywhere. His head swam with it, his breath speeding, the air getting warmer between them, damper from his breath.
“Tony?”
? As the night wore on, and Thor shared tales of valour and bravery of his shield brothers, and others joined with stories of their own… Steve sat back and slowly let himself relax.
It happened after the party.
Tony moaned and shifted, legs parting just a little. Steve’s hips jerked, his- oh, God, yes, his erection fitting between them, against the curve of Tony’s bottom. Oh, oh
And the party had been fun. They mostly sat and drank, too exhausted to dance, but as they drank they also talked, really talked, no arguments or trying to up one another- well, not
, not when Tony was waiting for him.
warm, he discovered a moment later. Warm and a darker shade than his own, smooth. Alive. His fingers glided down the arm, touched a fine-boned wrist, ghosted over the long, strong fingers. There were callouses on Tony’s palm, small scars, from cuts and nicks and burns, so at odds with his
tower.
Tony’s finger twitched and Steve froze, eyes flying to his face, to- to his closed eyes. He was still asleep.
He kneeled over him again and lowered himself carefully, keeping most of his weight on his hands, not pinning, just-
did that. He stretched again, one hand rising, his fingers twining with Tony’s, squeezing gently.
The scars around the arch reactor were white and smooth, long healed. No hair on them, but then Tony didn’t have much hair, his chest smooth and well-defined-
Sometimes, there was just no point arguing with Tony, he was coming to realise.
When was the last time he was so close to another human being? In the last century, he was sure, before the world stopped making sense, before the mission and the cosmic cube and the snow and the
with another person… he kissed Tony’s shoulder blade, tasted the skin with his tongue. Warm, slightly salty. He breathed out and gloried in the goosebumps his breath raised.
He hurriedly took off his own clothes, tugging the shirt over his head, leaving everything in a pile on the floor. No time for folding it down, no time to stop and
There was a star in Tony’s chest.
Tony, and- and petting his chest. He snatched his hand away, swallowing heavily.
Tony sighed and shifted, just slightly, just enough to give Steve more back to kiss, to explore. He touched gently, carefully, the pads of his fingers feather-light. Up the defined spine, and Tony really needed to eat more, up to his neck, into the mess of his hair, the stands thick and cool between his fingers. Just long enough to grasp, if he wanted to.
Steve’s eyes flew open. Oh.
“You are most welcome, Captain.”
“Relax, Cap,” Tony had said, resting a warm hand on his shoulder. “We just saved the world. We deserve a break.”
The doors opened with the quietest swish.
He had the gratitude of the talking tower. The 21
…Oh God.
Steve took a deep breath and gently released Tony’s hand. He had to stop. Tony was- interesting, and holding hands was hardly scandalous, even in his times, but- He had to stop.
exterior.
Steve’s eyes snapped to Clint, perched at the minibar, and Tony, resting against it.
Oh. Again, yes, again and- He was moaning now, small noises he couldn’t stop, his hands clenched against the bedding. He had to be careful, couldn’t be too loud, couldn’t risk waking Tony- Tony- Oh God,
through the den, all open space and windows, seriously- To the left, where doors opened for him on their own.
“Through the den and to the left,” the same voice said. “I hesitate to ask, but I believe that Sir could use someone to monitor his state, and as I do not have access to the bedrooms…”
Steve blinked and almost laughed at himself. The arch reactor. He had read about it in Tony’s file, of course, but the thing in the picture had looked dark and dirty, surrounded by bandages and a mass of scars, red and raised against a thin chest. This one…
The room was enormous, of course, all rich, dark colours and muted lights. The bed was huge and
“Painkillers,” he muttered. “I think. I wasn’t listening. Isn’t my first rodeo.”
His lips touched the warm shoulder, moved slowly across soft skin and defined muscle. He could feel the fine hairs on Tony’s arm against his lips. He kissed down Tony’s shoulder, his back. His pulse thundered in his ears.
Tony didn’t squeeze back.
“’M fine,” Tony insisted, even as Steve gently steered him towards the elevator and, hopefully, his bedroom. “I can drink
He stretched and sighed, eyes slowly closing, a stupid half-smile lingering on his lips. That was… He nuzzled the luxurious strands of hair, breathed in the smell of shampoo and exotic body wash and sex.
Steve swallowed.
“You did good,” he agreed because he believed in praise where praise was due. “But there were so many casualties, and so much could still go wrong-“
A trembling sigh escaped him. To touch, to grasp, to truly
“Yes, I can see. And that’s why you can’t stand straight.”
“Whoa, Stark! Watch where you’re going, you git!”
This one was bright and sleek, a cold blue light casting strange shadows around them. It was cool to the touch, hard and unyielding, undeniably
Steve sighed.
“You have my gratitude, Captain.”
Tony swayed closer, his forehead gently bumping against Steve’s chest.
century was weird. Or maybe it was just
“Wasn’t talking to the baby.”
fit for use?” Bruce asked as he dived into the gap at the front of the mound.
“Sixteen in a few weeks, come on,” Steve argued on autopilot, “and Tony’s only just had his birthday. It’s like, a year difference.”
It was a thing.
Jesus. He was in love with an idiot.
Except… except he’d seen Tony, halfway down the corridor and talking with the girl Steve
The boy just shrugged. “My mom likes fancy beds. But I had to strip the entire house of its furnishings, pretty much.” Thor grinned, and then bounded forward like an enthusiastic puppy, grabbing Steve’s face and kissing his forehead soundly. Steve just blinked, accepting it as Just A Thor Thing by that point.
Tony’s smile, if even physically possible, grew bigger. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone has ever told me,” he said, holding out a hand for Steve to take, “now can you please take my hand and let me escort you to the vehicle?”
He heard his name breathed out on Tony’s mouth, but pushed ahead fearlessly, kissing Tony softly before continuing. “Then on my first day at school, I see you, and something just… happens. I can’t describe it. But whenever I’m looking at you, or talking with you, or you’re kissing me- I just remember how it feels to… to feel. More than just on the surface. It’s something I genuinely didn’t think I’d be able to do again; but of course, you come along and suddenly I’m acting like a thirteen-year-old with her first crush. It’s mostly just embarrassing, but it’s also kinda nice, I suppose,” Steve laughed a bit, and their noses brushed as Tony shook his head and grinned back, tired and rough and perfect.
"Phone, Steve," she said sharply, flexing her fingers. Goddamn it. Steve groaned, putting his phone in her stupid hand and then letting his head fall onto the desk.
Steve sighed. The heavy feeling in his chest gained a few pounds. “A lot,” he agreed quietly.
“Hey, yeah, God, of course I do,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony’s hand tighter around his own and then dropping his head forward, falling into the base of Tony’s neck. “I’m sorry. I didn’t… I didn’t think, I just took one fact and then ran with it, but this- this is completely understandable, okay, I didn’t mean to be an asshole.”
Steve eyed her for a moment, but Natasha didn’t look anything other than satisfied. In all honesty, Steve was mostly just irritated that she’d gotten there first. There were a few things Steve wanted to say to her too. “She was given a sentance, right?”
“Just give them some fucking money, Steve,” Tony hissed down the line, “they probably only need enough for some weed. You got twenty on you? That’ll be more than enough for one of them.”
he could use to drop lower, to get to Tony, “please, love,
So we all know how much of a sucker Steve is for Tony when he’s in his element in the workshop, with his grease-stained face and tight tank tops etc. But I also feel like Tony would be exactly the same for Steve when he’s painting.
“Digging yourself into a hole here, man,” Sam patted him on the shoulder and shut him up as Steve’s eyes went narrower and narrower, “but Steve, he’s just surprised, that’s all. It’s not a secret that Tony’s more relaxed about that sorta stuff. Why do you think he’s not made a move yet?”
Tony was hurt. Not just by the arm and the bruised face, but by Steve, and what he’d done. In fact, he figured that what he’d done had probably hurt more.
"So?"
Tony cracked a smile, but shrugged. “He wants to talk, I’ll talk. He wants to fight- I can do that, too. I’m easy.” He winked on autopilot a the choice of words, but Steve got the message and began backing away worriedly.
What happened to me, was never your fault. You did everything you could. I didn’t… I didn’t know you were so affected- I’m so sorry. It wasn’t your fault. It
Cass stepped forward again, but this time instead of continuing the fight, he passed Tony completely, nodding over to someone behind him. Tony looked, watching as the fifth and final Enhanced rounded the corner and sprinted straight past all of them. He got back to his feet and raised the repulsors, knowing that he no longer had his targeting system thanks to the lack of helmet, but figuring he was a good enough shot to get a hit nonetheless. Now they were getting further away, firing shots would be easier. As cool as Iron Man was, he tended to work far better in open space.
“Hey, since when did they start becoming ‘my’ friends again?” Steve frowned. “
He turned the handle and pushed open the door swiftly, stepping into the room with Tony once more.
Her face softened a fraction, and she smiled at him. “Well, at least you’re not gonna be wandering around alone. We’ve got your back, Steve.”
He blinked, feeling a lump in his throat. “You… you did this for me,” he said so quietly he wondered if Tony even heard.
- a little longer, there are people coming to help us, I’ve-”
They flew back to New York in a heavily-armed SHIELD jet.
Tony just rolled his eyes and dropped his head into Steve’s chest. He felt a long kiss pressed into his skin, just over his heart. “Mmm- if it’ll help you sleep easier. Want me to wear a hazmat suit at all times too? Just in case, y’know?”
“Time to haul ass again, then,” Tony sighed wearily, as Steve whooped and pulled them in the other direction.
Clint frowned, but Tony pulled him into a hug and then let go, turning to Natasha as she held out an envelope of her own. “Wait- you’ve all done this?”
“Yes,” Steve blurted before he could even stop himself, and then felt his cheeks flame in mortification. “I- I mean, uh-“
He gasped, made a small noise. Something was wrong with him. His vision was getting hazy, he was—
He was right: Tony lasted two. “You know you’re a menace, right?” Tony asked her as he plucked her up and then placed her into his lap, shaking his head at her despairingly, “I should throw you in a dumpster.”
, his hand wrapping around Steve’s bicep worriedly, “fuck, Steve, you look like you’ve been through the wringer. What the hell is going on? Wait, hold on, don’t answer that now. Come in. I’ve got you.” Without hesitation, Tony tugged him backward, guiding Steve into his house. He was biting his lip- a clear sign of anxiety, along with tapping his feet and flexing his hands. Not that that was relevant right now. This was a mission.
“Yeah.”
Again.
Steve wanted to say- but he knew it would come out wrong; debating something whilst hungover was never a good idea. Sam meant well. “It’s alright,” Steve told him instead, running a hand down his face, “listen, I was just…somewhere I shouldn’t have been. I didn’t like it. Tony took me home.”
It took an extra ten minutes until Tony began to slow down and veer over to the curb. Steve looked around him in confusion; this road was pretty much entirely empty- a couple of houses at the top, but only the one over here, right at the end of the road. It was obviously abandoned though- a
Tony’s mansion was huge.
There was smoke and fire and bombs and screams and it was
Now, for all he knew, Tony could be dead.
Tony doesn’t let go of his hand, though, and Steve has to stop unless he wants to drag Tony along with him.
Help was coming.
Steve grinned lazily, waving a hand over to Bucky and then pushing him away so he could talk to Tony- well, not privately, exactly, but with less involvement from surrounding parties- “yeah. That. S’nice you’d… do that for me.”
But, surprisingly, it was Tony who broke the silence first. “You were convincing as hell, I’ll give you that,” he said slowly, voice devoid of anything at all, “really had me thinking it was real for a second there. Well done. I wouldn’t have called it. Not you, of all people. You always used to be terrible at lying.”
“Nice ride, Rogers!” Someone yelled over the parking lot, and he turned curiously, noting Ty lounging against his own expensive Audi with a group of his friends and smiling sharply over to Steve.
Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist, and Tony shivered violently, sinking into it. “I’m sorry,” he said again, gripping Steve’s shoulders with unsteady fingers, “you saw it, right? Jesus, this is a mess. I know this sucks. I’m sorry—”
“Of course it counts. Everywhere is different and that is a fact. So you gotta keep an open mind and not let any bad impressions get you down, okay? It’s all gonna work out fine.”
God fucking Dammit, Tony.
“Christmas,” Tony informed him, waving a hand weakly, “had these… these cool questions in ‘em. Was gonna sit on Steve’s right hand side an’ he’d pull the cracker with me an… yeah.” He sighed, thinking of the way Steve’s cheeks would’ve turned a little pink as he read the question-
Steve was on his feet like a man possessed. Tearing across what was left of the deck, he ran and he ran and he ran.
“Unfortunately not, Sir,” JARVIS admitted apologetically, “however the codebreaker is 98% complete and we will be able to access the contents of the deceased woman’s phone shortly.”
Everyone turned then; Tony practically getting a face-full of Steve as he stumbled forward from Thor’s push. Tony put his hands out and caught Steve by the stomach, stopping him ending up sprawled over the table- and Steve looked down at him with a grateful smile. When he turned to scowl over at Thor, the unfazable boy just beamed. Steve wasn’t sure whether the push in Tony’s direction had been intentional or not.
Eventually, Tony saw another hatch a few meters ahead, and now it was just a desperate race as to who would get there first- Clint to them, or them to the vent.
Tony could definitely get on board with that idea, and two seconds later, he was clocked out in Steve's arms, hoping against hope that Steve was wrong and that deafening screaming would not be a problem for the rest of the night.
Bucky was doing well though, and Clint and Scott had been able to go home and see their families, so that was good. Steve focused on training as much as he could, saving people wherever they needed saving. That was all he had left to do. It was the only thing he still cared about, really. All he had left to do.
Right. Sounded pretty nice. Safe. “Who else is there?”
up,” Steve snarled, “don’t talk about him like that, you son of a bitch. He’s worth a hundred of you.”
you shit. I thought you were
There were a million things he wanted to say to that, but he wasn’t sure how to convey it without getting angry—not at Tony, but at the situation itself. It was just so unfair. Of course, though, Tony took his silence for agreement and Steve watched him avert his gaze, shuffling a little further away on the cramped mattress almost subconsciously. Steve quickly saw to halting that, however; pulling him back in and rolling him smoothly up onto his chest. When Tony looked mildly surprised by the action, Steve just leaned up and kissed him. The moonlight from outside shone in through their cracked-open window, illuminating the other man in a soft white glow. He looked almost ethereal like that.
“You don’t need to, it’s okay, I get it,” Tony told him quickly, ignoring the way everything that had seconds ago been pleasant now felt uncomfortable- the dampness of his clothes he’d previously ignored, the way the lights were a little bit too cold and it was making his eyes burn. He didn’t want to hear Steve say that he wanted a family, but just couldn’t fathom it being with Tony. He didn’t want to have to accept that as fact and realise he just wasn’t family material. It was true, but it didn’t make it hurt less.
, Steve Rogers, personally for this." She groaned and turned around, facing the ceiling just as Bucky pushed open the door with a tray of snacks. Mainly icecream. She glared at him when he smiled. "You know, I'm starting to get sick of you, Barnes," she declared sulkily.
he could, he just had to- bend? Twist? Unwilling to move any further up into the air, he tucked his knees up and then rolled his body back around, seeing if it would change his direction, and then grinning in satisfaction when it did. He stopped flying upward for a second, hovering in midair.
orry-”
“Well, it’s lucky that I’ve never given a shit about important stuff everyone else seems to care so much about then, huh?” Tony said airily, spinning around in his chair and turning his back on her. “If you can kindly fuck off now, that’d be great. I appreciate the check-in, but I’m doing fine.”
know that, God dammit, it was so fucking
“Well, I’ve got the message,” Steve chuckled, head thumping against the stairs as he leaned back, “’don’t mess Tony around or you will be hunted down and possibly skinned’.” He paused, before adding: “Not that I ever
Sam, who had been busy on his phone a second ago, suddenly piped up. “He as good in bed as everyone says he is?”
It didn’t. If Steve squinted hard enough, it was almost like a sunset in Brooklyn; when the chemicals and smog had tinged the light unnatural colours, just like this one.
“You’re not allowed!” the kid interrupts him yet again, and with way more vigor than Steve had expected. For a moment he’s stunned by Peter’s stern look, the way his whole body trembles a little with the anger he’s trying to keep in that he can only blink at his son. The silence between them stretches on until the small body in front of him basically deflates.
All Steve can do is watch him scoot off in the direction of his room and make sure FRIDAY has an eye on him. Just before he slams the door shut Peter yells, “And then we buy a tree!”
“They’re not… you can just pull the lid off,” Tony explains, already halfway bent over to do it himself, but Peter thoroughly slaps his hands away.
Steve ignores Tony’s near-silent, gleeful snickering while he apologizes to his son who is probably the only one trying to pay attention to the Tooth Fairy swooning over Jack Frost’s shiny teeth.
His hand travels up higher on Tony’s thigh. Tony turns a little, opens his legs a little wider to give Steve some room for activities they have neither the time nor the privacy for, but that feel nice nevertheless. They’ve taken too long already which only becomes more obvious when Peter calls over, “Dad! Papa’s present! Come on!”
“I love it.” His own voice is breathy, way too airy.
Bruce is evading Steve at all costs, although he spends an awful lot of time with Peter, he realizes. Bucky sends him this secret smirk of his that he doesn’t like to see on missions because it means trouble (mostly for him). By the time Clint comes up to him, clapping a hand on his shoulder and telling him he’s in for a treat Steve almost breaks. He’s this close to losing it in front of his son.
“How about,” Tony started slowly when he had his own emotions under enough control and felt like he could regulate Peter’s, “we record a message with FRIDAY’s help and send it to Papa? So that he knows we’re thinking about him? How’s that sound?” He managed a watery smile that Peter didn’t return. His reaction wasn’t as docile as Tony’d have expected. The small boy’s face was suddenly hard and twisted in a scowl as he tried to push away from Tony (which Tony obviously didn’t allow since it would’ve sent him straight off his lap and to the ground).
No, no that can’t be… I- I swear you said 5, and it’s… Oh god, my phone’s not broken or something is it, I swear, I swear Steve I only thought 40 minutes had passed-“
It was Steve who gave it up in the end. Sitting down robotically in the chair opposite Tony as he worked on his table and looking at him with dead eyes as he’d said that this wasn’t working any more. That Steve needed to leave. That it needed to end. Again, in hindsight, he knew he wasn’t fucking thinking straight. His head was off somewhere that not even Steve himself could describe, but at the time, it seemed like the only course of action left. And Tony… Tony didn’t argue. Tony had just put his pen down slowly, exhausted and defeated and broken, and had nodded his head once.
She sighed, but hopped off the sofa and then toddled up the stairs all the same, Tony watching her until her feet had disappeared before turning back to Steve. “What’s happened.”
Peggy sighed again. She folded up her legs on the bed and then shuffled around a bit until she was facing him. He kept his eyes fixed on the wall in front; hand tucked under the pillow and not even caring that much about how wet and uncomfortable it was. He hadn’t been bothered enough to swap it out after the glass had spilled all over it, and it had ended up sort of molded to him anyway.
they were
Tony couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t do anything. He felt a drop of coffee on his wrist from where he’d thrown the mug trickle down his index finger and build at the tip. Steve was still looking at him with that broken, broken face as he cried silently.
He sniffed and leaned forward, carefully brushing the flecks of dirt off the stone. Pulled out the weeds that had begun sprouting around her grave. Cleaned it up, nice and neat, just the way mom liked it. Had liked it.
Thor glanced at the group, nodding solemnly. “He is a liar,” he stated, “My love is wanted by all.”
he’d thought of every safety measure known to man except for a fucking defibrillator, of fucking course. He felt himself begin to hyperventilate as he looked down at Steve’s unresponsive body, just lying there on the floor of his workshop. This was not how Steve was going to die. Not because of Tony.
“How long do you intend to keep this up? Are you looking for long-term, or is more of a curiosity thing?” And okay- that was it, he was
“I’m getting out of there soon,” he promised quietly, “and then I’m going to take you everywhere, Steve, I promise.”
Tony stared down at the data on his tablet with a deep frown and a worry-bitten lip. On the screen, scans of his own brain and closeups of his limbic system, his hypothalamus, all the weird mushy stuff that Bruce had been explaining to him earlier but Tony had been a little too exhausted to listen to, all planted themselves on the tablet’s surface in a freaky sort of clarity. It sparked some bits up in a worrying red, and he read the captions with a deepening sense of foreboding. He hated getting brain scans for this exact reason.
Sighing fondly, he leaned in and pressed an innocent kiss to Tony’s nose. “You know, if you don’t want to go any further than kissing, you can just say so. It’s fine, Tony, really.”
“Come with me,” Steve whispers eventually, standing up and gently grabbing at Tony’s hand.
that Tony was convinced Steve could just lick his face for ten minutes and he’d still get turned on by it. It was a little sad, honestly, but at this point Tony just needed to look at the boy’s lovely, angular,
“Steve?” Sam prodded him with his elbow gently, and when he looked up, Sam was shaking his head a little, “Word of advice. Don’t get involved with the ones like him. All of them are just… they’re not the type of people you’d wanna be associating with. You’ll end up with a criminal record by the end of the week. And if you get on the wrong side of them, they’d tear you apart. People like Tony Stark are not there to make friends with.”
Tony broke off, and Steve sat there in stunned silence as he watched Tony sink his head into his hands and sigh deeply. “Anyway, everyone thought it was very funny. And it was! HD definition, got to see the wreckage of the godforsaken car and the footage of them rushing her into a stretcher and everything! Fun, yeah, it was- it was fun.”
“You’re not moving!” Tony called out from down the corridor, and Steve jumped as he looked up in surprise, “I can’t hear your feet, Rogers!”
that, he’d
Steve nodded, smiling back. “Yeah, sure,” he agreed.
He didn’t really feel like himself. He felt like the autopilot version, coded to respond in the ways that he should. It was a familiar sensation. He knew it would pass.
Tony paused, brow furrowing for a moment before it dawned on him. “You remembered my birthday?”
Tony clenched his jaw. “Didn’t think to look after you when you were walking around in Lower Manhattan on your fucking own though, did he?” He muttered sulkily, before sighing. He shot a look over to Steve; eyes catching on the bloody lip and cut forehead.
“It was close enough! Don’t undermine Pete’s hard work like that,” Clint leaned forward and looked at Peter seriously while the boy picked up a piece of meat and tried (and failed) to make it reach his mouth. “Say ‘Bruce Banner’ for me, squirt. Prove all these fuddy-duddy’s wrong.”
Steve pulled a face, and when he glanced around he realized in surprise that both Bucky and Sam had left the room. Probably for another food break or something.
“Well consider me assured- but I’m gonna call you again when you get out anyway- I want to know every detail about the new school, alright? People, classes, cafeteria food- all of it.”
Steve nodded, shutting his eyes. “Seems accurate,” he declared with a sigh.
Steve didn’t bother answering; just wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist and pulled him in, tucking his face into Tony’s stomach and clutching his hands across the planes of Tony’s back.
“Yeah, ‘cause that’s clearly all you care about him for, isn’t it,” he said, “but yeah, you’re gonna have to act like big boys and girls and pay for your own drinks tonight, because he’s not meeting you. Now fuck off.”
“Oh, so Tony Stark follows the rules now?”
Natasha paused, an eyebrow shooting up at Steve’s words. “You think the reason you’re so bad at this is because you can’t talk to women?”
Steve ran his hand down Peter’s head to the back of his neck, and Peter squeaked and jumped, causing Steve to pull back hastily, eyes going wide. “Shit, what’d I do,” he blurted, “did I—”
Tony hadn't been in shock. He'd been right.
“Steve, does it matter?” Tony’s voice got a little snappier as he glanced back and frowned, pushing a hand through his hair. “It was years ago. It’s a fucking sex tape, I’m famous and they were probably offered a shitload of money for it, so they accepted. That’s all you need to know.”
“You know he won’t do shit if you just don’t finish it, right?” Tony asked him from across the room, nursing a coffee filled with a little more alcohol than he cared to admit. There was a reason for both their presences at the dinner table at 3am in the morning, after all- and it wasn’t because their dreams had been filled with too much fun.
“…Fair point.” Steve grinned wickedly, and then surged up suddenly, catching Tony’s mouth. “I could keep your mouth busy though,” he offered, which seemed to briefly throw Tony off for a moment as he sucked in a sharp breath, but then he blinked back into it and Steve yelped quietly when Tony huffed and flicked him sharply on the forehead.
Tony shrugged, looking away again. “I thought you were worth it,” he admitted, voice quiet and uneven. “I guess… that was it, at the end of the day. You were worth it.”
“Don’t say that,” Steve snapped, harsh and completely unfairly, Tony had done nothing but help him all night and Steve had just been a dick in return, “please. Don’t.”
Steve didn’t say anything. Just looked down at the plastic cup numbly. He was conscious of every thought that passed through his mind, every flash judgement he made. Just in case they’d missed something. Just in case he was still dangerous.
With a small sigh, he flipped Sam off and then neatly dodged another shoulder. It had been a long fucking morning of math and history, and in that moment there was one thing in particular he was after.
Except when he looked up, Steve had moved an awful lot closer, and before he could even begin to yell, his mouth became occupied.
“Three weeks ago. We were fighting Loki again. You disappeared for a few minutes,” Tony said quietly, and he watched as Steve stiffened minutely under his gaze, and knew he was on the right track.
, merely stifled. It was fine.
he wanted to scream,
Steve froze against the sink, toothbrush halfway to the rack as he turned his gaze on Tony. “I told you to shut up about that,” he said, demeanour totally changing from the relaxed way he’d been talking to Tony just five minutes ago.
“Your shirt’s still damp,” Steve murmured after a moment, his thumbs brushing across the soggy material over Tony’s shoulders, “shall we get that off you?”
Tony looked at him for another second, before nodding and then rolling onto his back and shutting his eyes again. His hand didn’t let go of Steve’s, which was just fine with him. He glanced at his watch: 4:14 am.
“Oh look, it’s Steve!” One of them called out, and he bit back on a sigh and kept his head looking into his locker, hoping they’d just walk off with nothing more than a few nasty comments thrown his way.
He spent the next few hours hunched over his laptop, searching for exactly what it was that he was looking for while planning and going through everything with Pepper. The product launch was at midnight tomorrow, and so Tony’s schedule was even more crammed than it usually was, but with the help of Miss Potts, he managed to rearrange and clear out Tony’s agenda for the next five days. She assured him it wasn’t going to negatively affect anything- these were just promotional extras that Tony chose to do, and it would make no difference if they got someone to step in last minute, and all emails or blueprints could be taken and done anywhere in the world. Which was useful, because Steve hoped that they wouldn’t be anywhere close to a damn office for a little while.
