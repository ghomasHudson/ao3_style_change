Just then, several police officers came running into the corridor, efficiently capturing and handcuffing the surprised abductor.
“Sure, no problem.”
Mycroft briskly sat up and inhaled sharply, while several plans of action started to vaguely take form in his mind. At all cost, he would make sure that this was preserved and that no one ever came between what Sherlock and John now had. Sherlock was the only person about whose life he’d ever permitted himself to care. And after decades of celibacy, his brother had chosen John, chosen to have
A short knock. “Sherlock?”
“I… I didn’t think you still felt that way,” he said quietly, his eyes flashing between John and his scone.
“Oh god, yes,” John exclaimed, his words muffled by Sherlock’s collar. He pulled back to look at Sherlock, then pressed their lips together, before pulling back once more. “God, yes, I will. Always have been,” he added lightly. “We just didn’t know it.”

“Protecting her from his own flatmate and old pal, with whom he travelled all the way from South Africa to the UK?”
The edge of danger, that was always there both during the act itself and during his confessions, was now heightened. This was an extremely clever man. What if he remembered some bits and patches and would manage to piece them together afterwards? Not that he would have any proof at all, of course.
The DI gave John a deadpan look, raising his eyebrows at him over his coffee cup.

“There is. But this is distracting you, I can tell. There’s not enough room even in your magnificent brain for both these mysteries at the same time. Give yourself a chance to solve this one first, to make room for the other one.”

to me.
John still felt his partner’s gaze on him, who was clearly wondering what was going on in his mind.
“Are you sure?” he rasped.
You promised not to kill her!”
He wished he could just take Rosie and all their stuff and go to Baker Street. But Sherlock had probably been right that it was for the best this way.
Sherlock tried to focus on his surroundings: the layout of the room, which smelled of old curtains and citrus-scented all-purpose cleaner. Only one entrance from the hallway, and one emergency exit onto Kingsley Road, where some of Lestrade’s men stood loitering about, undoubtedly either pretending to smoke or actually doing so. Several others, Sherlock knew, were in the waiting area, posing as candidates for Horatio’s role. Meanwhile, Sherlock feigned having his attention on the men in front of him droning out their lines.
“Can you tell me how tonight’s events are related to the case with the Thatcher busts?” Sally Donovan asked, gently steering him to the purpose of their interrogation.
“Well, all that
She managed a small nod, before drifting off into another silent sleep.
Christmas was meant to be a cosy, intimate affair this year.
like this, he wondered, not knowing whether their loved one would one day simply walk out of their lives? Not knowing whether harsh words spoken without thinking might inadvertently drive them away forever?
the boy and bring him back home!
They’d only been hiding it to keep it from Eurus, and she seemed to know now, anyway.
When he woke up the next morning, his arm still on Sherlock’s chest, he gratefully drank in the sight of Sherlock peacefully sleeping a hair’s breadth away from him. He smiled at the thought that he would likely not soon get used to this kind of view. Then he closed his eyes again, not wanting to wake Sherlock just yet.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John for a moment and bit his lip in a radiant smile, before dropping his head back on the pillow with a thud.
“What about his brother?”
He strolled back over to where John sat, leaving behind an astonished couple.
With everything he did, he could feel a direct response on his own cock. When he planted soft kisses, John would tenderly run his tongue alongside his shaft. When Sherlock dragged his nose over the sensitive underside of John’s bum, he was rewarded with increased suction and some beautiful moans coming from deep within John’s throat.
Once at the hospital (after Sherlock had ‘visited the loo’), they soon found themselves in the middle of a play area in a children’s ward. Child patients and their nurses were sitting and standing around Smith, who turned as Sherlock and John entered the room. Everyone applauded. Another nurse smiled at them as they walked past.
Catching his breath – his nostrils wide – and raising one eyebrow, Sherlock whispered with an intent stare: “That was close.”
Witnessing how Sherlock watched out for his brother suddenly made John realise that Sherlock often did something similar for him, as well. He had the ability to flawlessly tune in to what John needed, or what he wanted to avoid, and made sure that any avertable obstacles and situations were steered clear of – greatly helping John reduce his recently resurfaced anxiety in public spaces. John had just never seen it as clearly as he did now, through watching Sherlock do something like this with Sherrinford – even though his needs were quite different, of course.
Also, their innately different approaches and different sets of strengths and weaknesses were like two complementary colour palettes creating an entire rainbow of possibilities together, which made everything they tried to do so much more easy and comprehensive.
‘I need to kill someone.’
(See the end of the chapter for
The three brothers smiled at one another, exchanging a knowing look.
“Is this really what you want?” he asked again. “Right now?”
“Oh, is there one over there as well?” said Mr Holmes. “Marvellous. That’s settled, then.” Then, to Rosie, “You’re going to get your own little bed up here, how about that?”
He’d talked about both the mysterious broadcast and the puzzlingly missing sibling to John and half a dozen police officials a great deal over the past four months, but hadn’t managed to find a plausible explanation for either. Even more perplexing had been the fact that the Miss Me message hadn’t been followed up with anything. And seeing as there had been two Moriartys, one of whom had been great at disguising himself, at manipulating people and at being in places he wasn’t supposed to be, the fact that the other one had now mysteriously vanished while his brother’s face had been on every screen in the country, was definitely more than suggestive.
However, he now found that John’s kneading and stretching of the bread dough was becoming rather distracting, and he decided to walk over to have a closer look.
After an hour of tossing and turning, and devising plans of revenge should she ever somehow come face to face with the little shit, she suddenly remembered.
At how intense Sherlock’s orgasm had seemed.
Sherlock grabbed his phone – his fingers trembling ever so slightly – and took a couple of pictures of the envelope in his hand and of the gap he had recovered it from. Then he nodded to the bench nearby.
“It was utterly stupid of me,” Sherlock went on, “to have been honest to you about something like that, which completely changes your image of me and which therefore makes it impossible for us to continue the way we were. I’m sorry I didn’t think it through. I just--”
Of course, after this reward, she started using her name more often to get what she wanted. Each time, there was a cheeky twinkle in her eyes, as she pointed at her rattle, her teddy, or the pretty coasters at the restaurant. “Lowey! Lowey!”
“Yes?”
was to Sherlock. How Sherlock would only keep off drugs if John was there. Mycroft had practically said as much. And hadn’t the exact same thing happened a year ago, after his wedding? He was realising only now that his absence might have had something to do with Sherlock’s relapse back then as well. John guessed it was a habit to keep underestimating his importance to Sherlock. “I’ll make sure of it,” he said, determinedly.
John took a few steps towards the door with him. “I’ll talk to him,” he said in a hushed voice. “Just think it through next time, okay.”
They looked at each other.
John tried to get hold of Sherlock’s cock to stroke him, but that turned out to be altogether a bit too ambitious: to his own frustration he couldn’t maintain the same angle and rhythm while leaning only on one arm. And he was close now, so very close. He could already feel the beginnings of a dizzying whirl gradually building up inside, until it suddenly over-flowed his being and erased everything around him, annihilating along with it any reluctance to cry out an elaborate string of primordial syllables that meant nothing and everything at the same time.
ever happening?
“I’m not sure. I’ll just open the door a little and peep outside… I can see tiny lights through the windows.” She was whispering almost inaudibly now.
With their mouths still pressed together, Sherlock pulled up his knees towards his shoulders and wrapped his legs around John’s back, provoking a feeling of wondrous inevitability. Then he tentatively reached between them to take John’s cock in one hand and guide it to his arse. First, he wriggled John’s glans around a bit between his arse cheeks, at which John couldn’t help but let out a blissful moan. When Sherlock stopped moving and held John securely in one place, coaxing him to start pushing in, John carefully did so – as slowly as he could muster. He let out a stifled noise through his nose as he felt Sherlock’s arse hole gradually open around him.

was why he loved this man. Because only to John would he show himself so utterly vulnerable, all thanks to this inexplicable magic bond they had, from which stronger feelings inevitably had started to evolve. On both sides, as it now appeared.
“Christ,” John breathed. “What happened?”
He took out his phone and punched in a number.
“Wednesday morning I booked today’s session. Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago – two weeks before you were abducted and brought here against your will...”
Mrs Hudson was rather bad at playing Uno. And Sherlock didn’t feel like playing any of the other games he’d been occupying himself with ad nauseam in the past weeks – or the violin, either – so he decided to clear up the game after this round and then start emptying his inbox on his phone.

“So…,” Eurus said, suddenly pretend-casual again, “now you’ve finally remembered me. At last I’ve got your
“Like a museum, such as this, but much smaller,” he explained. “More like a shop. People can also go there to buy paintings they like.”
“Well, it started about three weeks ago, or at least that’s when I started noticing, anyway.” She took a deliberate breath. “At random moments of the day, whenever I’m walking somewhere – and I go by foot quite often – this bloke in a hoodie is following me. Every time I turn around to look at him, he pretends not to see me and turns away, studying a shop window or suddenly looking down at his phone. He’s there half the time I go out, whether it is to work, to the supermarket, to yoga class, or off to have lunch with a friend. It’s creepy.”
In a flash of clarity, he stayed in exactly the same position and continued to talk into the phone, pretending to not see the book his gaze was fixed upon, and hoping that thereby the owner wouldn’t notice it lying opened on the desk either. “Yes, thank you so much. Sorry again.”
It had been twenty-six hours and roughly fifteen minutes since John had known.
“Christ, Sherlock, I want you so badly, you’ve no idea, but--”
Wordlessly, they each took a passport to see whose it was.
“You know, Sherlock actually
It was funny seeing Sherrinford be so in awe of these paintings, that were barely of superior quality to his own, Sherlock thought.
“Basically fine,” Sherlock answered for her, launching himself from the stretcher.
“Yes, yes. Complicated business. So much money going round,” the greying shop owner answered.
And then, suddenly, a hundred jigsaw pieces started to fall into place, sprouting a fountain of deductions in Sherlock’s head. Mycroft was
He wondered if all the safety precautions were still really necessary. Was Eurus still shadowing their every move, or had she gotten bored and found a new project already? Just to be on the safe side, he texted Mycroft as well, to let him know where he was.
Unfortunately, gathering the evidence as to Mary’s real identity had turned out to be immensely harder than anticipated, and more than a few things had gone awfully wrong along the way.
At the start of his hiatus, Sherlock had found out that Jim Moriarty had a sibling. And Sherlock still hadn’t forgiven Mycroft for letting him disappear off the radar. The simple fact that he’d managed to become invisible like that was extremely fishy in itself, Sherlock thought.
-- Would like to visit my aunt. But not as myself. Can you maybe let your brother arrange something? (Also, where is she being held?) J
Thanks for all your lovely comments. Each one brightens my day!
What was more, now that he gave it proper consideration, Sherlock realised that John didn’t seem to be looking over his shoulder every ten seconds anymore, like he had often been doing the past couple of months. Although he was obviously still quite a bit more nervous and paranoid than Sherlock was, John had definitely lost a significant amount of his anxiety.
When he looked up, bewildered, John was suddenly holding out a small sleepy puppy, that had definitely not been in his hands before.
She smiled shyly again at this.
From her blanket on the floor, Rosie looked up at him and began an elaborate soliloquy that only she could understand. But it sounded joyful enough, so John decided to crawl over to sit with her and affirmed everything she said with an interested “Is it really?” or a baffled “You don’t say!” and grabbed the nearest teddy to join in the conversation, making funny voices that made her cackle out loud.
John forgot to breathe for a few moments and looked at Sherlock with what he hoped was not too much eagerness.
Sherlock let out an embarrassing noise when he felt a soft, warm tongue on his glans.
She sighed contentedly.
“Hi.” He didn’t object.
He heaved a deep sigh as he rinsed the last foamy cup and handed it to Sherlock.
Then again, Greg was probably making quite a pretty picture himself; standing there stupidly with his jaw dropped, clutching his silly envelope with pictures.
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath. “Ophelia!” he said, as an idea apparently started to take shape in his mind. “She wanted to play Ophelia in Hamlet. Oh, this is good, this is very good. Last week, in the hospital, I happened to overhear one of the nurses mention that there were soon going to be auditions for a small production of Hamlet by some award-winning amateur theatre group that her son was going to have a go at. Oh! This is brilliant!”
“Yes, that’s what I asked, wasn’t it?”
It hadn’t.
“Well… er… you always made it very clear that you’re not gay.”
When he briefly opened his eyes, Sherlock noticed he was not alone in the room. There was a nurse pottering about.
Irene had in fact always insisted Sherlock should make a move, as she was completely sure John felt the same. Much like Janine. They both said John had been so clearly jealous when he’d thought Sherlock had been in love with them. (A ridiculous notion.)
* * * * *
“So it was Jack, after all?” Violet said.
Smith straightened up and started to walk around the foot of the bed, towards the drip stand. “Then I restore the settings. Everyone assumes it was a fault, or you just gave up the ghost.” He smiled.
It wasn’t long before Sherlock started dreaming in sign language. Which was funny, because he’d often dreamed about people signing to each other before without actually knowing how to do so himself. (Like in that elaborate, strange, Victorian lucid dream he’d had on the plane bound for his intended exile, which he wasn’t likely to soon forget.) And he’d never realised that those dreams were almost certainly fuelled by some very early childhood memory, that he didn’t even consciously remember, of BSL teachers coming to their home to try to teach Sherrinford, back when they had been only toddlers.
“I was defending you.”
He noticed that Mycroft was more tired than he was willing to let on. And also…
John pulled Sherlock closer towards him in the bath and tried to give in to being vulnerable like this, with Sherlock on top of him while his legs were spread open. Sherlock had been so trusting, had let him in, literally. Why was it so hard for him to do the same? “I love you,” John whispered. And before Sherlock had a chance to reply, John trapped his mouth in a slow and deep kiss to reinforce the message.
Also, actually spending time around Sherlock, who she’d long considered a dear friend, was a blast. They often understood each other with half a word and they both appreciated the other’s witty remarks and the sort of obscure references that no one else ever seemed to get. And despite Hannah’s reservations, John had turned out not to be so hard to get along with at all, now that the two of them were happy together.
‘Who?’
“Yeah. Who’s this?”
Finished, John rested his forehead on the pillow next to Sherlock, his chest heaving.
Sherlock looked at John again and at the swelling slowly coming up below the red spot on his forehead.
Furthermore, he couldn’t forgive himself for not having been able to see how John felt about him all this time. Naturally, he couldn’t blame John for not seeing it in
“Goodness, all those complicated, bizarre movements we were supposed to copy. What with my arthritis, I just couldn’t do it. My hands would hurt for days after each lesson!”
He sleepily thought back to the previous night and the way Sherlock had looked up at him with delighted serenity and hooded eyes, just before John had emptied himself into him.
He wore a ginger wig with long, wavy hair, small but thick-rimmed purple glasses, a pink boxy top with a wide, green, coarsely knitted cardigan over it and a pair of his own dark blue skinny jeans and lilac pumps with medium high heels below, which he still had from last time. Furthermore, he wore a set of false teeth he’d remembered he kept in a drawer, and had stuffed bits of cotton wool in his cheeks to change the shape of his mouth and make his cheekbones not stand out as much. On top of that, Hannah had not only added a perfectly natural looking layer of make-up (using lipstick to alter the apparent shape of his upper lips to a more generic kind), but she’d also plucked his eyebrows to reduce them to a thinner line, higher up above his eyes, as women tended to have.
Sherlock had his mouth open and blinked, undoubtedly brooding on some sort of sarcastic reply, which, however, didn’t come to him within the time frame of the second and a half that she remained silent.
And he’d said he loved him.
By Tuesday afternoon, a day and a half into his new ‘job’, Sherlock had become rather fed up with the senseless banter of the workmen, which distracted him not so much from the case but from being able to meanwhile think about the situation he’d gotten his relationship with John into. Also, his back was aching. He’d been taking as many trips to the loo as he could without arousing suspicion, so as to optimally extend his area of surveillance into part of the Hall, as well as stretch his back and have some quiet moments to himself, and he decided to venture another one now.
Sherlock chuckled loudly, making no attempt to keep it down.
“Yoohoo! Are you boys decent?” Mrs Hudson’s voice rang through the upstairs hallway, only seconds after.
Sherlock reached across John and held out the phone with a tight smile. “Thanks for the hug.”
Her eyes widened as she stared at the outlines of their backs in the dark; nailed to the spot. Even though she couldn’t see much of John, she sensed he stiffened just as much as she did at Sherlock’s words.
“Last January.” He looked away, biting his lip. “When things got rather…
Although it quickly became very obvious that Sherlock hadn’t kissed anyone in a while, it was also very clear that he really, desperately wanted this. He had grabbed John’s waist so tightly as if he were afraid John might otherwise turn and try to walk away again.
“It’s funny how everything started to look up significantly from the moment we got into a relationship,” Sherlock replied. “God must approve of that, then, it seems.”
So by the time it was almost Christmas, John was unsurprisingly rather exhausted. Hence it was only on the afternoon of 23 December, that it suddenly occurred to him he hadn’t yet thought about Christmas dinner, let alone bought any ingredients.
“I’m not completely sure.”
Then he helped himself.
They’d never taken Rosie with them, though. The poor thing hadn’t had a breath of real fresh air since John had been shot, seven weeks ago. John couldn’t wait to take her to a park and let her play on the swings or on the lawn, investigate the bugs, acorns and pinecones.
As soon as she was gone, though, something occurred to him.
* * * * *
It was quite possibly one of his best birthdays ever.
“Oh, he’s been making so many paintings since he’s been in Wantage, you have no idea. We keep having to take them away in truckloads to the store room we’ve rented. Mycroft actually started renting a second one for him now, I believe.”
“Why isn’t John coming?”
Then Sherlock leaned to the side to put the bottle on his desk and they wrapped their arms around each other, neither of them apparently sure what to do, but both unwilling to let go.
This made John raise his eyebrows in a mock display of surprise, now hiding his lips between his teeth. “I’ll give you your
“Oh, good. This is Josie from The Golden Beehive, of Epping. I just wanted to let you both know that we’ll be hosting a private party in the main garden from 6pm on the day that you’ve booked your afternoon tea, just so that you have the opportunity to move the reservation to an earlier hour if you should prefer. But we’ve got a table in the poppy corner reserved for you till as late as you like, anyway, so it’s up to you. But I know how William generally dislikes crowds, is why I thought I’d call.”
Time for some Shakespeare and a couple of additional holes in the wall.

development, you know. Have to keep on the bottom of things.” Sherlock briefly closed his eyes. “On top. In order to be able to get to the bottom of things, I mean.” And on the same breath, “You know we should probably have dinner because it’s getting cold.”
Sherlock woke up because he was uncomfortably warm.
“None serious enough to consider to stop doing this,” John replied.
Surely that had not just been
It took Sherlock hours to fall asleep, which in itself wasn’t uncommon. However, the reason usually wasn’t that his bed felt empty and that he had to actively restrain himself from going upstairs and listening at John’s door, never mind opening it and... and... what, exactly?
Sherlock blinked. “No.”
the little voice inside John’s head said
“What?” Sherlock asked.
They travelled the tube chatting about the crime scene they’d just contaminated with coffee, their knees touching as they sat side by side. The ferret had been a wild guess, Sherlock admitted (although not an entirely unfounded one).
* * * * *
He stumbled back to the lounge.
“So what do you think?”
seemed to have that effect on him, at least initially. Everything had changed once she’d shot Sherlock, of course, let alone when the rest of her background had come to light. But the cherry on the cake had been when Sherlock’s (initially withheld) prediction about John not being the father of the baby turned out to be correct. It had been obvious, really: that David had been rather fishy from the beginning and eventually a DNA test had proven exactly what stream he'd been swimming in.
As Sherlock hadn’t really drawn or painted since his schooldays, he wasn’t remotely good at it. It felt strange being so clumsy at something. But he did enjoy it, because he did it together with his big brother. Sometimes, they would put two easels side by side and each would work on their own canvas. Sherlock mostly painted still lifes of objects that were already in the room, while Sherrinford primarily painted animals, people and landscapes from memory. Occasionally, he would help his younger, inept brother, by showing him how to add shadows or mix an additional colour into his palette. Then they would look at one another and smile.
They both sniggered covertly to cover up the seriousness of what John was saying.
Just as the girl slunk away after finishing her lines, though, someone slipped inside through the open door and stepped into the centre of the room before anyone had a chance to tell her not to.
Sherlock simply didn’t know what it was like to have a younger brother about whom one worried constantly.
John stepped outside, just as a helicopter flew overhead. He looked at the expensive-looking red car, parked at an awkward angle outside the house, with rubbish bins lying on their sides near it.
“I really didn’t.”
Because if there was one goal he still had in his life, it was to not become the kind of father his dad had been.
John smiled awkwardly. “I’m not sure I want to… finger myself.” The idea was rather preposterous to him, even though Sherlock was right, naturally.
Both of them were looking at him with wide eyes.
But in reality, Sherlock knew he was fighting for his life.
He should never have sent her that bleeding text. He just hadn’t been able to resist, thinking she was still abroad anyway.
Once she was back under her blanket on the sofa, having drunk the wretched warm milk, her hand slipped between her legs before she was even fully aware of doing it. She then eagerly pushed her middle finger inside, reaching deep within her own familiar warm softness while creating a pleasant pressure with her palm, in order to channel the built-up frustration of not only seeing Sherlock fuck someone else – on top of just having had her bloody handbag stolen – but also of the fact that she was spending another night out not getting laid (which had rather been the idea of going out to begin with). With images of Sherlock and John together floating through her mind, she ended up having one of her most intense orgasms ever, requiring every bit as much restraint as her hosts had exercised not to cry out, as she spasmed into blissful limpness.
John had actually managed to make Sherlock come just with words once: whispering both sweet and filthy things into his ear while kissing his neck – and subtly pressing his bulge to Sherlock’s naked cock as he was straddling him, but otherwise not touching him.

He rested his elbows on the table and carded his fingers through his hair.
Would either of them ever grow up, he vaguely wondered?
Sherlock typed his reply with one hand, still cradling his cup in the other.
John briefly smiled, and nodded, as he let his legs fall open.
Sherlock’s shyness is betrayed by his sudden business-like manner. “I hoped you’d say that.” His eyes dart away, seeming to avoid John.

Neither did his other feelings at the moment.

And well, now he knew.
“If he needs any help whatsoever--” Mycroft began.
“Yeah right. Good luck, mate,” Rob smirked as he walked away, following the others.
“Still here. Just give me a minute. We’re going to do everything that we can.”
The case. He still needed to work on the case.
“You don’t seriously think that she’s involved, surely!” the earl exclaimed, indignant. “That handwriting was nothing more than a good forgery. I’ve spoken to her, and she’s just as worried as I am!”
His Mind Palace was a chaotic mess, though, and wasn’t providing any answers. But he was on to something. He just knew it. That tingly sensation of having found a loose thread in the world. Sherlock was intent on seeing where it led. All he needed to do was to get a proper hold of it, and pull.
Although, come to think of it, didn’t TD12 have a distorting effect also on previous memories? Could it be… that he had been injected with Smith’s drug?

“I assured them it didn’t, even though I wasn’t
Mycroft listened intently, silently.
He sat on the sofa, motionless, as far away from the window as possible, holding her tightly.
They fled the crime scene like naughty teenagers.
“No, I’m failing to.” Which was true in so many ways.
His phone was in silent mode – save for incoming messages from one particular number, of course (although there had been fewer and fewer of those as well).
Also, they didn’t actually live together, seeing as John still had the terraced house he’d lived in with Mary.
Before his mug was finished, his phone beeped. Sherlock frowned at the screen.
Smith turned and looked at him.
“We’re at home?” the boy said, incredulous. He was clearly weakened and Sherlock very much doubted that he had been fed on a daily basis. Sherlock was, however, quite sure that that was the only way he had been maltreated (beside undoubted verbal threats and intimidation to keep him from calling for help). Thank god.
“That’s good to hear.” Sherlock dragged a hand over his face, unable to keep his eyes open.
, which, upon further inspection, turned out to contain nothing but a number of his own tweets retweeted with the same added hashtag each time.
Sherlock fidgeted with the hairdresser’s cape around his shoulders and looked at his worried frown in the mirror, as the barber proceeded to trim his hair. Sherlock had figured that one aspect of his disguise for his undercover work as a builder might as well be a regular haircut (which was long overdue anyway and which usually tended to alter his appearance quite a bit already), even though most of his hair would be covered by the cap that he was planning to wear on the job. While he watched the amount of curls that lay scattered over his cape gradually increase, Sherlock pondered the transience of life and how the nature of relationships was just as changeable as people’s physical appearances, even though they were rarely altered as deliberately. After having hugged Sherlock and held his hand pretty much throughout the previous afternoon, John had started to become distant by the time evening had come. He hadn’t touched Sherlock anymore, not during the night, nor this morning. Sherlock felt a sense of shame creep into him when he thought about it. He had become someone different to John, and he had been a fool not to anticipate that.
your blog.”
But other than telling him Bob was a somewhat geeky, slightly dyslexic and fairly devoted roleplayer with an enthusiasm for medieval weaponry, none of that provided any useful insights into his behaviour.
“How could I be so blind, Sherlock? How?”
This was it. They were about to go to his bedroom and do it, Sherlock knew. He felt a strange calmness descend over him and he gently took hold of John’s hand. “Come on,” he whispered.
He was still alive.
Once they had stilled, and contentedly started to doze off between sweaty sheets, snow started falling outside their windows, covering the world in a beautiful blanket. Like a fresh start; a new page, waiting to be written.
Sherlock remembered her only vaguely: a rather strange woman, with a funny accent that almost sounded fake.
Sherlock felt his stomach turn to solid rock. Was John disappointed in him for his lack of experience? But he could learn, surely? He wanted this,
Once Sherlock felt John’s bulge harden into the same state he himself had by now also reached, he began to gently grind down onto him. His legs were between John’s and he couldn’t deny that this position elicited a very specific fantasy in him. The first time they’d had penetrative sex, John had mentioned that he would also like to try bottoming, but the subject had never been raised again and Sherlock didn’t think it entirely unlikely that it never again would. He wasn’t sure whether he really minded. He loved everything they already did and he definitely wasn’t going to coerce John into switching. It would have to be a matter of patiently waiting to see if John would ever specifically ask for it. And Sherlock wasn’t even entirely sure it would be a good idea to do it anyway. There was a deeply hidden fear that he might be unable to be gentle; might lose control and hurt John. When Sherlock bottomed himself, he could at least completely surrender to his impulses without any risks. But nevertheless, in moments like these, the desire to penetrate presented itself quite plainly. How he would love for John to pull up his legs and wrap them around his back, surrendering to him, allowing him in…
John’s thumb hovered over his screen. Eventually, he typed, “Going back to work tomorrow. R is bound for new adventures at nursery. Any interesting cases on your end? J”
John nodded, contemplative.
“How about the investigation that was undoubtedly started into Ms Norbury’s presumed activities as a mole, after her false confession?” Sherlock asked, his voice low. “I hope that has been abandoned, by now?”
John’s eyes smiled and it was the prettiest thing Sherlock had ever seen.
Sherlock loved nothing more than this: to lie on his back with John on top of him, holding him, alternately looking down at him in reverent wonder or fervidly kissing his neck and shoulders as he drove into Sherlock, caressing him from the inside, panting as he lost himself inside of him. The feeling of luscious fullness and being wanted like this were addictive new sensations and Sherlock couldn’t imagine how he’d ever lived without it.
“Yes?”

It was the deepest, purest, most desperate kind of love.
“Would you perhaps like some tea, mate?” John asked, putting both hands on his knees to get up.
Maybe it was good to take some distance from Sherlock. Get his life back on track first, so that he could see things more clearly and could make healthy decisions again. To make not everything in his life always be about Sherlock anymore.
feels very real at least to me.”
(25 May)
This was what she’d longed for him to do to her, so many times, in this very bed. She felt a little spike of anger at the memory of the previous summer. Sherlock had seemed so shy and unsure of himself where sex and intimacy were concerned. It had been irresistibly appealing, somehow, and had only made her yearning worse. Now, she saw that he was perfectly capable of making love; in fact better than many guys she’d slept with, by the looks of it. She’d known for a while now that he fancied men – or more particularly John – of course, but she’d never quite been able to picture what he would be like in bed with the right person.
“All done,” Angelo smiled. “Let’s go to bed.”
A bit later than I promised, sorry! The whole proofreading process always takes more time than I anticipate, and it doesn't help that I'm a bit of a perfectionist. :D
“Since I’m assuming that the police are not passing you information directly, I thought I’d call to let you know that the French teacher has been found. He claims to have seen Arthur climb out of his window, alone, and went after him. Then he followed him around the back of the school and onto the moor, presuming that’s where he’d gone, but never saw him there. After walking for a good bit in the direction of what he says looked like a moving flashlight, he sprained his ankle so badly he couldn’t walk. He had to crawl back to the road, which took him three days. He’s in hospital, dehydrated.”
When the front door swung open, a friendly, elderly lady appeared with outstretched arms. “Hannah! So good to see you!”
“Yep. Sleeping like a log,” Hannah replied.
“Anyway,” she continued, her voice friendly again, “here’s the brooch you asked for.
Also, topping had been different after this. More intimate, somehow. Maybe because he knew what Sherlock was feeling as John topped. And definitely also because he was finally rid of his nagging unease about not being on equal footing.
. Except that, since last Saturday, whenever he now looked at Sherlock, it wasn’t pure elation that he felt. It was also pain and anger about the mental scar that had been so cruelly inflicted on him all those years ago.
“Can’t stand it," Sherlock had replied. "Never can. There’s a loose thread in the world.”
Sherlock woke up feeling ten times worse than before.
The feeling of relief was overwhelming. Like too many heavy coats suddenly having been taken off.
John could only pray to God that Smith’s current appointment lasted more than two hours.
After he’d hung up again, he felt like his own battery had died, too, and he collapsed back onto the bed, next to John’s. However, he couldn’t manage to fall asleep anymore.
He woke up again when Sherlock somewhat forcefully grasped his arm. John stopped moving his hips, realising in that instant that he’d been rather enthusiastically humping Sherlock from behind. He had one hand on Sherlock’s upper thigh, fingers hooked around the waistband of his pants, apparently in the process of pulling them down.
. Come back when you’re married and no longer high on bloody sex hormones, for crying out loud. Go!”
“Sure.” John frowned. “What is it?”
“I sent e-mails to both of you from the other’s account and intercepted the replies,” he explained with a friendly smile. “I figured you, Miss Smith, would be convinced that Bob does like you, which he really does, by the way, if he invited you to such a posh place. And I have my reasons to assume that thanks among other things to this dinner date, Bob’s friend Jack by now has made plans to move back to South Africa. Am I right?”
Sherlock frowned. “A bubble bath, John.”
(John had managed to convince Mary he’d better let his flu run its course at Baker Street, so as not to pass on his bugs to her while she was heavily pregnant. The real reason was that his nerves had worn so thin that he’d needed continuous visual proof that Sherlock was really back; that it wasn’t just a dream.)
John was afraid of hurting him. Wonderful, wonderful John. Everything was going to be alright.
She turned the page in search of some more uplifting news.
She had been right, once again.
Should he apologise for having put Sherlock at risk all this time regardless? After the first time, it hadn’t really seemed to matter anymore. At least John had warned Sherlock to use a condom on
, dummy, you only catch the dumb ones. Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill some people. What would happen then? All that power, all that money.” He squeezed the head of the doll with one thumb, crushing its face. “Sweet little government dancing attendance.”
“Listen, John is the only person I’ve seen make you happy in a long time, Sherlock.” She frowned, looking concerned. “You’ve got to give this a chance. Talk to him. Maybe things aren’t as bad as they seem.”
He thought about Greg and Molly and how they seemed to be going places just for fun, enjoying themselves and each other’s company. Perhaps he and Sherlock should get out of the flat, out of London, even, for a bit. But before he could suggest anything of the sort to Sherlock, John would have to come up with some sort of meaningful gesture that would break the ice between them.
. Like my brain isn’t working properly.” Then, in a lower voice, “I’ve had to tell so many lies these past months. First, to Mary. Then, after she was… gone… to everyone else, about what happened with her. To Molly, Mrs Hudson, to my co-workers, my therapist, and on my blog. I’ve been repeating all those lies in my head, over and over, to try and make sure I had a consistent story, adding and removing details until I reached a point where everything in my mind became garbled up so much that even I now sometimes don’t know what is the truth anymore. Like my actual memories have been corrupted. Overwritten.” John heaved a long breath. “On top of which, people have been lying to
John shook his head. The bottle was ready. He walked over to Rosie and picked her off the floor. Settling with her on the sofa, his thoughts once more drifted back to what Mycroft had said. Or rather, hadn’t said.
Sherlock and Sherrinford drank their tea in what felt like companionable silence.
“Ah. Hello,” he replied.
After a couple of minutes, John took pity on Sherlock and he closed his lips around him, sucking him deep, but not hard, and still tantalisingly slow. He could feel Sherlock trying not to thrust up into his throat, so clearly did he want to.
Sherlock then pressed his mouth to John’s and was soon snogging him thoroughly, very effectively bringing back all John’s blood to where he clearly wanted it to be right now. Meanwhile, John could feel Sherlock’s own half-hard cock occasionally bounce against his bollocks under water. When it brushed the region very near his arsehole, however, he uncontrolledly let out a startled grunt. The feeling had not been unpleasant, quite the contrary, but to him it was both unfamiliar and very sensitive territory.
Sherlock drained the rest of his coffee.
Sherlock climbed down to show him and Moore the picture. “This window was forced weeks ago. There’s fungus growing on the surface of the markings.”
of next month. And he needs to coordinate things with the director of the theatre group.”
had stolen it. Incredible coincidence. I applauded her for getting away with it. She seemed the ideal mum, from what I’ve seen.” She said this with an actual wistful smile on her face. “Better than mine, anyway.”
Sherlock had been out several times for minor cases, which he’d taken on in hopes of finding new inspiration for the Moriarty case along the way. (He hadn’t.) Or that he thought might be connected to Eurus. (They weren’t.)
Following the follower had been easy enough. He
Sometimes he watched telly, wondering if John was perhaps watching the same programme at that very moment.
What a day.
“Like what?”
“Or with another person? Ever?”
During his last visit, they’d sat quietly together and talked about Rosie and how she was growing and how she regularly melted all of their hearts, even Sherlock’s. And how wonderful it was to see her interact with Sherlock, who didn’t even seem to mind looking after her at all.
It was a kind of quiet, familial cosiness and companionship between the four of them (including Rosie), that Sherlock had only very rarely experienced before. He realised that this was what happiness felt like. Just being together with people who accepted you, and who were hardly ever annoying, really. Hannah’s practical stoicism and dry humour often lightened their glum situation, as did Rosie’s spontaneous, unrestrained cheeriness and wonder, and, of course, the marvel that was John’s unconditional love and affection.
Because Mrs Hudson’s symptoms, although serious, had been
The minute John could see 221B in the distance, a whole batch of butterflies seemed to take flight in his stomach. Still, he didn’t bother to try calming his nerves before he went in, especially if no longer denying your feelings meant it made you feel this young and light again.
“Sherlock, what’s going on? Why are you asking me all this?” His voice sounded like sanding paper, as if he hadn’t talked in days.
She smiled nervously.
It opened.
, Sherlock. That means that I’ve got no problem at all with what people have incorrectly labelled as ‘gay stuff’.” He bashfully smiled a crooked smile, making him look twenty years younger.
“You okay?”
In the lounge, she was greeted by the blond woman who had brought little Rosie and her to Mr and Mrs Holmes’s a little over a month ago. (What was her name again?)
“Yes. Two weeks,” Smith said.
“By all means,” Sherlock panted with a slight smirk.
“Yeah. Writing is a great way to get stuff out of your system, I’ve found,” Janine agreed. “Oh, I’m so excited for you! A novel!” she squeed. “Ooh, can I know what it’s about?”
“I need you to tell me about the day Redbeard died. In as much detail as you can remember.”
His anger was actually real. Anger at Sherlock having been so stupid to take drugs again.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t ready earlier. It just took me a while to get used to the idea, I guess. And then it got worse after… you know.” John caught Sherlock’s mouth in a tender kiss before he could reply, then let go to continue, “You were so trusting of me, right from the very beginning. I just… I’ve realised that I find that hard.” He tried a small smile. “But I really want it now. I want my future husband inside me.”
to actually spend his energy and time on. No goal. The only purpose he’d had in the past year had been
Bob being in love with Violet in spite of the very mixed messages he was sending was typically something that Sherlock would overlook.
So many papers everywhere.
Lying in an intensely content heap of sweaty limbs, they gradually caught their breaths, with ridiculous smiles plastered to their faces.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John,” Sherlock grinned back, amused. “I only have a doctor/soldier kink, which I
An hour later, he was startled by the sound of his phone buzzing in the quiet of the evening.
“Oh, but I do. I spent a whole evening with her.” Sherlock grinned. “We had chips.” He looked down reflectively. “I think she liked me.”
“No, I haven’t.”
“Okay, I promise.”
As John’s smile widened into an intensely happy grin, Sherlock hastily pried the ring out of the box and set it on the top of his little finger. Naturally, it was too small to go on properly. Nevertheless, he showed it to them with pride.
He was in the process of trying to find pornographic depictions in the shapes of the letter combinations inside the little coloured squares when his bedroom door opened to reveal a tray with tea, followed by John, who was carrying it.
“Bad doctor,” Sherlock mumbled again with what he very well knew was a shit-eating grin on his face.
One afternoon, when John was free from the surgery and Sherlock was out on some errand, John was surfing the internet to get ideas for a nice location to propose. But everything he looked at just seemed meaningless and silly. He paced the room and started to clear away some of the accumulated clutter that had begun to annoy him from the corner of his eye, when the phone rang.
“Yeah, he is,” John smiled proudly, still a bit pensive.
* * * * *
Sherlock sat up, and stared into the darkness while he focused on the calm and reassuring sound of John’s quiet and regular breaths.
“But you’re gonna.”
He didn’t move or open his eyes just yet. He only hugged his knees a fraction tighter, with his chin still resting on top of them.
Sherlock was in one of his meditative poses on the sofa but noticed John already before he’d even closed the door behind him.
A woman. Late thirties, early forties, physically fit.
“Do you remember the end of our first case?” Sherlock said in a hushed voice. “Mycroft showing up at the scene where you shot the cabbie, making you realise that my ‘arch enemy’, as he had introduced himself to you earlier, was actually my brother?”
“Yoohoo!”
Sherlock nodded, frowning.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, trying very hard not to kick himself. This had definitely been the stupidest idea he’d had in a while. “I guess that’s for the best, yes.”
They fell silent again.
When John’s hands reached the small of Sherlock’s back, he pulled Sherlock more tightly towards him, grinding his cock into Sherlock’s thigh, apparently desperate for friction.
She hadn’t seen John in over a year. They’d had a horrible fight just before his child had been born – over the phone. They hadn’t really spoken since.
“That’s the text alert of Irene Adler,” John said. “That noise.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock kept rolling his head this way and that, sometimes seemingly gasping for air as if his primary metabolic functions were struggling to maintain homeostasis. Frankly, Mycroft was quite grateful there was no audio, because he was reasonably certain that the sounds coming from his brother’s throat were fairly obscene, which he could tell mainly by the smug smirk on John’s face that was visible whenever he came up for air.
John sat back to give him some space and watched with restrained heavy breathing as Sherlock positioned the dildo and started to slowly push it inside.
“It’s alright, Mrs Hudson,” he said, putting a hand on her arm. The plant had only been there for a few weeks. She must have forgotten it was there and knocked it over without seeing.
,” she assured them. “Sherlock, you know perfectly well we’re not narrow-minded about these kinds of things.”
When he came back with three filled teacups, Greg cleared his throat. “Well, er, now that I’ve gotten over the initial shock of this unexpected development – well, I say ‘unexpected’ but as I said, we were all really past hope, to be more accurate...” He quickly swallowed away another grin that threatened to take over his face again. “Anyway – I’ve remembered what I came here for.”
Sherlock could tell that it turned John on, regardless of what he’d just said. John clearly still had some stuff to work out for himself. “Well, I couldn’t very well dress up as a woman and wear men’s briefs underneath, could I?” Sherlock teased, playing innocent. “And the bra was necessary to put my fake boobs in. Your socks.” He pulled them out to show John the familiar black and green pattern.
John quickly ducked behind a bus stop shelter as he recognised one of his patients approaching; to avoid having to receive condolences for losing Mary. He pretended to check his phone, and while he was at it, deleted all his new notifications. Nothing from Sherlock.
John had tidied up.
Sherlock tried not to nod too eagerly. “Yes,” he frowned, with a touch of indignation, but still playing it cool. “Of course.”
He remembered with some embarrassment the mixed feelings he’d had when he’d received the results of the paternity test he’d secretly had done on Mary’s amniotic fluid sample. After finding out she was a cold-blooded criminal, he’d almost hoped the baby wasn’t his. He hadn’t known what to do when he’d learned it
Besides, he wasn’t here to talk about Mary. Not really.
Maybe they shouldn’t have gone out today, after all.
“By all means,” Sherlock panted with a slight smirk.
A couple of times, as it did again now, the thought had crossed his mind that he could ask John to move back in with him. But this was probably a foolish thing to even contemplate. John had a good job as a GP now and no longer needed a flatshare.
“What name?”
John almost giggled at how funny Sherlock’s voice sounded.
novels, ha.” He lifted his mug. “Could be more effective than therapy. Also, cheaper. Not to mention safer.”
That was the moment John decided to give up for the day and go home. He had a night shift that evening, after all.
over the years. Even Irene had seen that there was something between them, going so far as to insist they were already a couple.
“Yeah, well, just killing time, you know, till a new murder comes along. Sometimes I’m buried up to my neck in work and sometimes there’s nothing for
It took Sherlock several seconds to realise which Greg John was talking about.
Although spending an entire evening with Sherlock Holmes had been very interesting, to say the least – especially with him being high as a kite – Eurus hadn’t really managed to gain any new information that she could see the use of just yet. But that often came later, after she’d had some time to mull the new facts over in her mind, so that was fine.
“John, Janine never touched me in that way. The relationship was never real, you know that.”
I just want to fix ALL THE PLOT HOLES!!! Because they still make me angry. Me making up for Moffat and Gatiss’s lazy writing is just a form of therapy for me, I guess. ;)
John and Sherlock looked at each other in mild horror.
His eyes were scanning his surroundings for imminent danger. His ears were pricked for unusual noises from outside.
“I’m in love with you.” There. Gravity seemed to downscale its G-constant by several percent. Sherlock closed his eyes while he quickly continued talking, explaining. “Which is why I feel it wouldn’t be fair to spend any more time around you, without you knowing this, while I’m having these… thoughts, about you. And now that you know, obviously, we can no longer be—”
After a beat of silence, Sherlock concluded with some reluctance that it was apparently necessary to state the obvious. “Because you haven’t made love to me in over a week, John,” he said, defeated.
that he could.
* * * * *
someone for that pearl. Actually ended a human life in order to possess it, probably to sell it. And since, it had been lying here, inside a stone wall in Norway, forgotten. Worthless, until Sherlock had found it again.
Nurse Cornish looked around the room anxiously.
He cleared his throat. “What did you watch?”
“What,
John had replied almost instantly. “Great idea. ;) Tomorrow afternoon? Three-ish? J”
Blowing out a sigh, he handed the passport to Sherlock, briefly exchanging a look with him.
Mrs. Hudson just shook her head and winked at John as she left.
“Seriously? You just went cold turkey the minute I landed in hospital?”
Sherlock, however, is very much walking over to him in a straight line, and then, shockingly, drops to his knees in front of him, never breaking eye contact.
John tried to send her away, but his “please leave” came out somewhat garbled and was cheerfully ignored.
Not a good sign.
His face heated at the memory.
“Unsettling, really John? I rather thought you’d be intrigued, seeing as you’re
He rested one hand on the railing, looking westwards to the London Aquarium. Where it all began… Or ended. He couldn’t really tell.
On the next floor, in a rather messy and curious looking lounge, five pairs of eyes turned to her, as she entered. There was another fully armed man in AFO uniform, a pretty lady with a small gun at her hip, the odd, posh roommate whose name was escaping her at the minute, and two men in overalls carefully carrying a glass windowpane towards what seemed to be the kitchen.
On top of Chloe’s grumpy phase being a reason to take it easy, John was also organising Sherlock’s fortieth birthday party for two weeks after. That’s when they would have a house full of people already.
“Can she know about… you know…
Holding his fingers pressed lightly to John’s neck to keep checking his pulse, Sherlock took out his phone and called Lestrade. “Greg. I need you here. Right now. I think we’re looking at attempted murder. It’s John.”
A few minutes later, they were sitting in their chairs by the fireplace.
He might as well risk it all now.
Smith walked away, looking as freakishly confident as ever. Sherlock looked at him grimly for a moment, then hugged himself, sighing silently.
Sherlock seemed about to roll his eyes, but his expression halted in mild confusion.
“Well,
“Yeah, he doesn’t really wear the hat,” John replied for him. Good old John.
of him. But how could he ever touch Sherlock like that now that he knew that that same act had once been traumatic to him? How could he ever do the very thing to him again that that monster of a teacher had done?
“ID, please.”
After breakfast, he spent the remaining part of the morning trying on every single one of his lay-person disguises and all his wigs and fake noses, and throwing them all into a corner in frustration.
The implications slowly started to crystallise in John’s mind, while he revelled in the feeling of Sherlock’s lips against his and Sherlock’s hands clutching him tightly, wantonly.
“Finally,” John breathed.
“Aww, doggy, doggy. Cute doggy!” she cooed, as she took a small packet of raisins from her coat pocket. “Come on, little doggy. Do you want some raisins?”
“Maybe it could make my eyes better too,” she said, as she handed him the steaming mug. “They do desert me these days. Mrs Turner says it’s just old age. It comes to us all, doesn’t it? But I’ve never had any problems with my eyes before, you know? Would you like some honey in your tea?”
“Christ, Sherlock, you are the best thing that ever happened to me,” he whispered urgently. “And that was before tonight. Now... you’re just off the scale. Oh
“And all the politics, surrounding the mining and the value of gold and such.”
It was at moments like these that John had felt guilty about his sexting affair, oddly enough. What was it to Sherlock, anyway? The man obviously couldn’t care less about sexual relationships. Especially if they weren’t any of his business. Or not even sexual, in fact.
Nanny Forsyth shouting, running.
“Aunt Harry, yes, look, there she is!” she then heard John’s voice coo from the landing, as he came into the room with the cutest little baby girl on his arm.
He sat down in his desk chair, leaning back and intertwining his fingers, and looked at John intently.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, visualising one of those memes where an object, labelled ‘you’, flies past a dot, labelled ‘the point’.
“Ah, yes, the famous
John nodded. “Yeah, I... I am. I think I am. Not all day; not every day, but, er, you know.”
John sat back to give him some space and watched with restrained heavy breathing as Sherlock positioned the dildo and started to slowly push it inside.
There could be several.
All Sherlock needed to do was have that announcement printed in small poster size and put it up near the warehouse that Eurus occasionally squatted at.
The secret Holmes sibling. (Maybe it was a sister rather than a brother.) Why had Sherlock never mentioned them? Some sort of family feud? Even worse than the one between him and Mycroft? Perhaps it was even the source of the strain in Sherlock and Mycroft’s relationship.
His back straightened as he saw a reply from Bob arrive in Violet’s mailbox.
“Wow.” He appeared to shake this thoughts away. “Why don’t you?” he asked.
John pushed his lower lip forward. “Sounds like a good plan.” He lounged back on the sofa, taking the cardboard lid off the roast pork. “Let’s assume for a moment you were right about Bob and Jack having made some pact between the two of them. What if Bob then got second thoughts,” John said, shaking his finger at nothing in particular, “once he actually gets to know the girl and really likes her.”
She stretched her arm above and behind her, holding the raisins just out of reach, cackling and sticking out her tongue, as he made a complete fool out of himself.
,” John said, eyes wide in shock.
I have, however, decided to neglect my family a little bit less and not to prioritise this fic above all else anymore, as I have been doing for the past seven months. Therefore, I will aim for two updates a month rather than four, from now on. :)
Sherlock merely smirked.
“Of course I do, yes. I was oblivious and insensitive to your feelings and it makes me feel like a complete fool. I’m a bloody doctor and I failed to see the signs of your abuse. I failed. Please forgive me, Sherlock.”
When Sherlock got back home, John was out. He’d left a note on the kitchen table that said, “Gone to Leverton’s to choose a coffin. Back around 1pm.”
his father’s voice echoed in his head.
This chapter was initially part of the previous one, but my new plot beta Amanda very wisely advised me to split that outrageously long original chapter in two. That’s why this new chapter was finished so quickly after the last one. :)
It reminded him of the entrance to his primary school library, in the attic of the old convent, where Ms Elinor resided. He always used to chat with her – about things that often had very little to do with any of the books she was lending out.
“Yeah, sure. Of course. I promise.”
To Sherlock’s astonishment, he couldn’t even
image from his memory – certain as he was that this one was already going to prove enough of a challenge as it was).
Smith’s laughter became louder. “Oh, no!”
“Listen, before I do anything,” John said, quietly, “I need to know what state you’re in.”
“It’s… er… probably time for me to go,” he said, trying to focus on something that would make the room stand still. Perhaps he’d overlooked a third bottle earlier.
“Explain? You don’t have to explain anything, dear!” she said, stepping over the threshold. “It’s perfectly clear that the Lord has heard my prayers and the two of you are
“I promise I will try,” John replied truthfully, already having a hard time focusing on the conversation they were having.
As soon as Sherlock appeared with another full bottle, John pushed himself up from his chair.
John was silent for a moment, apparently trying to solve some puzzle. “So I’m… your first?” he said eventually.
“James!” a man called from the distance. “Get on with it, will you? We’re all waiting for that chainsaw over here.”
So the knowledge had indeed come in handy, like he’d thought it might one day.
Sherlock, too, had turned red. “You
John stared at him incredulously for a moment before rolling his eyes. “You
She told him John didn’t want his help.
Sherlock pinched his lips together. He’d assessed, in the meanwhile, that she was unarmed.
“Do they really?” Smith asked.
At any rate, John could no longer claim that nothing ever happened to him. And in his case, that was definitely a good thing.
Sherlock froze, his breath hitching, his body a tense bundle of muscles. John’s lips met with nothing but passive flesh.
That said, there might still be loads of inconsistencies regarding Sherlock’s perception of reality while he’s high, simply because I’ve never used drugs in my life and didn’t have the foggiest idea what I was doing while writing these scenes (in spite of having read as much as I could about the different effects of heroin and cocaine, of course, which smirkdoctor pointed out to me Sherlock must both have taken). Please do let me know if you spot any glaring errors!
It was as if the world had shifted on its axis.
One reason being, he could finally show off how happy he was with John. He had already been doing this for five months, of course, but on a much smaller scale, in occasional one-on-one settings only. Having all his acquaintances over and showing off to all of them simultaneously was much more efficient, and therefore much better, naturally.
. And you finally know who Rose really was.” She looked smug. “I guess we’re almost even now. One down, one to go.”
Sherlock is still standing silently by the window, facing him from across the living room.
“It seems he hasn’t, no.” There was a short silence. “He was very young, Sherlock. He’s no longer the little, angry boy who liked to torment his baby brother. I’ve been trying to tell you, but of course I respected your reluctance to… reconnect with him.”
He wanted to do this right: he first had to find out what the legal possibilities even were, exactly, before asking Sherlock such an important question. But the decision to ask him had been made today, on this beach, and it felt momentous and wonderful.
Sherlock put a hand on his back and nudged him closer.
In one of the adjacent parking spots, a plain, blue Vauxhall stood waiting for them.
Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure yet whether he would actually have her do this, but he might decide to apply this approach to lure out Miss Moriarty if all else failed. He’d just needed Molly to tell him about the process and how foolproof a forgery would be. So now he could properly consider that route.
“Just being your usual brilliant self, I suppose,” John said, trying to make it sound casual, as he gently turned Sherlock around to face him.
close to me. The personal things I’ve shared with her! And all she did was lie. And break the law.” She wearily shook her head. “It gives you a right dent, having trusted someone like that. And then your
None of this would of course have been necessary if Sherlock had actually had any damned proof that it had been Mary who’d shot him, in the first place. But to his utmost frustration, he didn’t. (Obviously, his own statement would not have been worth a penny, after he'd suffered severe internal bleeding, almost died on the operating table and spent several hours unconscious and under the influence of heavy painkillers and other medication. There was no chance in hell that a judge would have taken him at his word if he'd said that he remembered it was Mary who shot him. Besides, for the court of law, a mere statement was never enough anyway. However, as was to be expected, the idiots of Scotland Yard naturally had found
With many thanks to quietlymischievous, julzann, monikakrasnorada, smirkdoctor and ewebie for their medical advice, which I have incorporated in the following chapters.
Inside was a flat, see-through zip-lock bag with what seemed to be two British passports and a curious little round ball of crumpled up masking tape, about an inch across.
Oh. “
Dammit, why hadn’t he spent his time on more pressing matters?
“I need to know. Everything. Each tiny detail you can remember. Please.”
After a while, Sherlock withdrew his hand to lube up the dildo.
“We bugged it with a GPS tracker, knowing that Mary would somehow manage to snatch it from us, which indeed she did – after drugging me – and that’s how we followed her to Morocco.”
Those kisses. God. They had still been relatively chaste, but Sherlock couldn’t help but smile like an idiot in the complete dark of his bedroom, thinking back about them. The last person he had kissed had been Janine and that had all been an act, of course. He couldn’t even actually
EDIT 21 June 2019: It wasn’t the last time. There will be 37 chapters at least.
But that was precisely what made it so scary. He’d become so accustomed to such strange norms of interaction between people – what with him having first lived with an eccentric, emotion-blind, wildly intelligent sociopath and then with a cruel, selfish, sassy psychopath – that he just couldn’t tell what was supposed to be normal anymore.
“You are so beautiful,” John hears himself whisper breathlessly. He would never have said that if he’d been completely sober.
John was taken aback by the name for a second, for Sherlock never used his real name, as far as John was aware. “Well, actually, this is his partner speaking,” he said.
She cursed as she noticed a ladder in her tan tights, then decided she could do without.
The pair had started loitering around their neighbourhood at the end of the spring during which Sherlock had been investigating Carl Powers’ death. He’d been thirteen.
The police officer’s cap lay on the chair beside the door, with the man himself nowhere to be seen.
He would soon have a look at private teachers who could teach BSL to the both of them.
reason why I’m really glad John recovered so well,” she said, giving him a playfully admonishing, shocked look. “God, you had me so worried when you were unconscious!” She looked at John, and then at Sherlock, remembering how he’d never left John’s side in the hospital. “You were both in my prayers every day throughout the summer.”
Faith let out a brief scream.
John froze. “God, Sherlock, are you sure?” He crawled back to lie down next to Sherlock and looked him in the eye with a tentative smile and a frown, as he held him. “I mean, it might hurt. I don’t want to hurt you.”
“Are there ships on it?”
“How about Janine, then?” John asked. “I literally saw her come out of your bedroom, remember?”
John and Rosie had practically been living at 221B a good deal of the time anyway, though, in the past months; every time Mary had disappeared, sometimes for days on end. And a lot of other days as well.
This whole honesty lark was decidedly grossly overvalued and it clearly led to nothing but calamity. How stupidly naïve it had been of him to think that his relationship with John would last, with that wretched history of his...
While Sherlock helped wriggle his knickers off his legs, John took the opportunity to quickly take off his suffocating leggings – and his pants, while he was at it.
“Well, no, a
He let out a long breath and took several large gulps of the lukewarm brew.
“Is it a city?”
“I’m not sure about the ‘unnecessarily’,” Sherlock pouted.
Sometimes he texted John. But he invariably ended up feeling even worse afterwards.
John even bought some sunglasses, as he hadn’t anticipated needing any and had left his at home.
Verdigris eyes stared back at him, content but still inquisitive.
Now Lestrade could do the dirty work.
“I promise.”
“Yeah, well. Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to get the dates. We’ll have to find another way.”
? I mean, that hardly makes any sense, if Redbeard only had a single wound. On his chest, no less. Tell me, was Redbeard lying on his back also, before he was attacked?”
As he put the cups in the sink and added hot water and washing up liquid, he suddenly felt warm arms around him.
If John only knew.
Then it started to dawn on Sherlock.
“Er, yes, yes, certainly.”
who happen to be midway through their twenties. They do little else than drink beer and watch crap telly, and they interact with friends mainly through roleplay, thus completely distorting their image of reality, which leads to the construction of ridiculous plans that have no basis whatsoever in the laws of logic.”
, as Sherlock was well aware he was more than an expert at hiding his own feelings. But how could
Even after all these years, John had no idea how Sherlock could recognise his brother from the way he rang the bell, but there it was.
“Oh! Yes, hello!”
They smiled bashfully at one another, as Sherlock tried to casually sit back in his chair as if nothing was out of the ordinary. And perhaps nothing was. Perhaps this was exactly the most ordinary, most natural thing to ever happen between them.
Hannah then spent another good half hour giving him tips to make his posture more feminine without it looking like a parody, and Sherlock felt he was all set.
John hastily opened his fly and applied the lube. Sherlock was patiently looking up at him, wild curls framing an eager face, biting his lower lip in anticipation. His heels were almost touching his bottom and his knees were pointing outwards.
John blushed a little. “Er, I’m still working on the plot. So I can’t tell you much just yet. But there’ll be action and mysteries, stuff like that.”
Several hours later, he was going over the results of his experiment, sitting in his armchair with his eyes closed as he committed the observed facts to memory and stored them in the relevant sections of his Mind Palace.
Sherlock felt nauseous.
He looked at the people passing in the corridor. Doctors. Visitors. Cleaners.
Sherlock vaguely became aware of some enthusiastic wolf whistles in the background.
John cradled his wine glass, privately delighting in the fact that Sherlock solving a case entailed so much more than him just elucidating the facts in order to cash his cheque. He used all his powers and creativity to actually solve people’s problems, not just the mysteries lying at the core of them. After all these years, the man still didn’t cease to amaze him. To think John had once been fooled into believing he didn’t have a heart. It might be small compared to his brain, but that didn’t say much at all in the case of such a genius.
“I do need to get up extra early tomorrow,” Sherlock said slowly, “to personally ensure that you reach orgasm without having to use your own hands.” He smiled bashfully, very much aware that regardless of everything else, that was the first issue he had to set right.
Not a waste of time, indeed.
As Sherlock learnt alongside Sherrinford from Arnold and his DVDs, which they watched for homework, John took the shortcut of learning BSL from spoken YouTube videos, which was naturally much easier and faster, as things were simply being translated and explained. This way, John only needed to invest a couple of hours a week, contrary to the Holmes brothers’ three-times-a-week half-day sessions.
. Having continuous hesitations as to whether John might perhaps feel the same or not; whether he should tell him how he felt or not.
“Oh,” she grunted, “don’t get me started on
As to be expected, it takes him several attempts before he manages to insert his key into the keyhole properly so that the front door to 221 Baker Street opens. He enters the downstairs hallway, glad at the numbing effect of the ethanol molecules in his blood, which make the world buzz almost pleasantly around him. However, the double whisky has barely managed to wash away the embarrassment of his date walking out on him halfway through their dinner (which was rather the idea of his resorting to liquor to begin with).
Naturally, neither could Sherrinford. He looked at Sherlock like a scared child.
than a friend?
He’d looked at the map a hundred times in the past couple of weeks. Could his eyes have fallen on the curious name of this village before, just without registering it consciously? Could his brain then have provided the link with Mary’s sense of humour in his dreams?
--There’s this wonderful thing called Google, you know.
When one of the men left to get both the ring and the oil (sensible, as it had probably been the lack of oil that had worn the ring), Sherlock entered the second phase of his mission. “So, you gentlemen have definitely found yourselves a nice workplace, eh? Wouldn’t mind spending my days here myself. Ha-ha! So are they treating you well, the snobs that live here, eh? Are they nice?”
They said good-bye on the next street corner with a quick peck on the lips and John went home in a state of mild unease that he couldn’t quite place (this was Sherlock after all – what was he expecting?) and that he still hadn’t managed to shrug off by the time he opened his front door.
hospital.
Smith looked round at the children. “Look at you all! So gloomy! Can’t you take a joke?” Chuckling, he stood up. “A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson!” He himself clapped his hands while the audience applauded rather unenthusiastically. “Come on! Wonderful!” He turned to smile at Sherlock, who gazed back at him intensely. “Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.”
Something was definitely off, and Sherlock couldn’t put his finger on what it was. He realised that part of the problem was, he’d deleted almost everything to do with Sherrinford from his memory. “Can you explain why he’s never learnt sign language? I presume Mummy and Daddy tried to have someone teach him.”
“Ah.”
He let out a long breath and switched on his computer.
He’d seen it coming light years away, naturally, but after half a decade of fruitless dancing around each other – during which time John had actually managed to get married to someone else – who would have thought the day would actually come? Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth for his sloppiness in not observing.
Then, with that one hand still touching Sherlock, it is suddenly very easy to casually add his other hand and to rest it slightly higher on Sherlock’s other flank.
This was new information.
‘Hell’.
“Just tell me when to cough.” He fake-smiled at her for a second and walked out the door.
Once they were back outside, he smiled at Sherlock, before looking down at his bags with the day’s harvest. Then he put them down to sign to Sherlock, “I am happy.”
“I was seventeen,” John said. “My dad accidentally made her trip down the stairs, because he was drunk. As usual. But she didn’t manage to avoid his uncoordinated staggering that time.” He took a deep, shaky breath. “She was carrying a heavy laundry basket, full of wet clothes.” His voice broke, as he continued, “They ended up strewn all over the hallway.”
“You know all those ads with half-naked, sexy women you see all over the city, wherever you go, or whenever you switch on the telly?” John said. “They can drive a man crazy. I know, because I used to be such a man. That incessant stream of images showing scantily-clad females used to turn me on endlessly. Incredibly frustrating and annoying. I spent half my life fantasising about models staring me in the face all over the place. But you know what? Not anymore. Now, I look at them and all I can think is: I have something so much better. I’ve got Sherlock bloody Holmes in bed with me every night, not to mention his amazing, perfect mouth doing all sorts of wonderful, unspeakable things to me on a regular basis. I’ve got all that I could ever wish for. If ten beautiful women would throw themselves at my feet and beg me to take them, I would still choose you, and only you. Because you are absolutely gorgeous and brilliant, naturally, but on top of that, you
