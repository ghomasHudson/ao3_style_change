John pulled his head back and looked up at Sherlock.  His eyes were glowing in the darkness, and his lips appeared to be curling slightly in what almost might have been a smile.  "Try that again."
"No, I don't mean it like that.  Well, I do, rather, but that's not the point."  He let John pull his hands out of the sleeves and flopped back to raise his hips while John undid his trousers.  "It's obvious you hate your bedsit, and for good reason.  I've a spare room upstairs that I didn't know what I was going to do with.  Had been contemplating getting a flatmate.  You can't deny it's in a wonderful location.  And it does--"  Here he rolled his hips for show as John pulled off his trousers, his cock an obscene and beautiful line in his black pants-- "have certain advantages."
“Because that’s really what we need, is more gifts,” said a warm voice George has never heard before from the door.
John appeared in front of him with a teacup perched on a saucer.  “Oh, ta,” George said.  “Um, I take—“
Setting up the profile on Grindr had been an exercise in self-hatred.  I mean, what could he say about himself?  Everything that he had bitterly muttered at Bill in the pub was just as true for men as it was for women.  He wasn't a good prospect, not for a relationship, not for a one-night stand. He couldn't even come up with a reasonable username, something that didn't make him feel ridiculous or remind him, repeatedly, of his own personal failures.  I mean, what was he now?  Not a soldier, barely a doctor, out of touch with popular culture, doubly out of touch with gay culture, since he'd been so far away for so long.
“I’m the other woman,” the man said primly, and glided away, arms behind his back, which set Mary off again.
John explained to the paramedics how he'd splinted Rochester's arm as they worked on him.  It hadn't been easy, but Sherlock had apparently had a long roll of gauze in one of the inside pockets of his ridiculous coat--he'd have to have a talk with him about that, by the way, because John might have changed his coat but Rochester had recognized
John sighed.  "It's like having one of those robot-fridges that tells you what's in it.  And you eat just as little.  Wait, the bread's gone off?  I had toast this morning."
this, Sherlock!" he yelled, no longer caring if Mrs. Hudson and all of Mycroft's bugs and Mrs. Turner and probably half the population of bloody Marylebone heard them, gesticulating wildly.  "You can't just, just
“No, it’s fine.”  He smiled and made enthusiastic eyebrows in John’s direction.  “John was nice enough to let me in, fix me a cuppa.”
"I'll need to reapply," Sherlock said.  He picked up his camera, took a quick photo of his lips, and then sprung out of his chair, barely remembering to hold onto his sheet as he skittered away.  Once he was in the bathroom, John brought his thumb to his mouth, and licked the remnants of cappuccino foam off, tasting the lipstick, imagining he could almost feel the warmth of Sherlock's lips.  There are only a third as many layers of skin on the lips as on the rest of the face; the color of them is blood, and the heat, too.  John curled his tongue around his thumb for a moment, and then pulled it out.  He shook his head to clear his thoughts, and went back to drinking his coffee.
John forced himself to look away from Sherlock's mouth and clear his throat.  "I thought you quit.  Both of you."
to be pitching his voice that low on purpose, "that there are other things I can do with my mouth that I would like to document the effects of."
John wanted to find something snarky to say in response to that, but Sherlock was leaning over now, his hands braced on either side of John's shoulders and the muscles of his inner thighs rocking against John's cock through their clothes as he lowered himself.  He expected a kiss, but instead Sherlock pressed his nose into John's cheek and used it to turn his face to the side.  John closed his eyes and caught his breath as Sherlock's nose slid down his cheek to his ear, where he exhaled softly.  John's hips arched up instinctively, and Sherlock pushed back; their rhythm was slow and deliberate, but they kept going as Sherlock slowly pushed his nose down John's neck, along the line of his collarbone to his suprasternal notch.  Then down, down, down the line of his sternum, just the pressure of the tip of Sherlock's nose, slow and deliberate, pausing again at the infrasternal notch, and then again at his navel, taking the slightest moment to nuzzle against the soft flesh around it before continuing.  John had no idea what to do with his hands, but when Sherlock looked up at him as his nose slipped down past the waist of his pants and nuzzled deliberately against his cock through the material, he reached out instinctively and buried his hands in his hair.  "I thought," he gasped out, "this was going to be about lips.  Oh, fuck,
"Trust me," John said, dropping his shirt on the floor and pulling off his t-shirt.  (He'll realize, hours from now, that he didn't even think about showing his scar to someone other than a medical professional for the first time.  He will think this while Sherlock is inquiring whether he knows which brand of sutures were used in its stitching, because there are a few idiosyncrasies that he believed might be useful for future reference.)  "I have no intention of leaving any time soon.  But I do have to go home eventually.  You could get undressed too, you know."
John swallowed.  It wasn't like he hadn't seen some incredibly fit blokes on Grindr; he'd sometimes clicked out of the program and been utterly confused by the mixture of arousal and self-disgust he felt.  But it wasn't just that this was a beautiful arm, or that he could perfectly picture that hand buried in his hair, digging nails into his arse, those beautiful arms wound around his shoulders or pushing his neck into the bed.  No, it was the poise inherent in the photo that appealed just as much, the sense that this was someone with a skill, proud of it, someone who wanted to show off a little but only what really mattered.  Because John was sure that past that arm was a chest to match it; he could have just stood there and taken the same body shot as thousands of other blokes on this site, but it was more important to show that this was his thing.  And, well.  John respected that, was
"Mmm, no.  Not truly necessary.  Besides, the untrained eye would be distracted by the specifics of my lips if there were photos, and unable to generalize to other lip shapes and structures."
"So, normal, then," John said, remembering the Sherlock-has-a-theory-of-pasta incident which had resulted in them being kicked out of the Tesco.
"It's.  Um."  He hadn't even come close to doing it.  With hands perfectly steady, John reached out and brushed his thumb across Sherlock's philtrum and cupid's bow, gathering the foam and feeling the waxy silk of his lips.  "There. Got it."  He showed his thumb.
Scrambling to follow, George threw his coat over Mary’s and shook himself off so he wouldn’t drip too much as he followed John up the stairs.  The first floor flat was wallpapered in dark colours, and all the Victorian aesthetic of the place seemed to be intact, but with the addition of some weird taxidermy on the mantle.  “It’s a nice place you’ve got,” George said, trying to strike up conversation, as John turned on the fireplace and then went into the small kitchen.  “Lovely, um.”  He gestured to a framed bat skeleton hanging on the wall.  “Decor.”
"Really," Sherlock said, and threw him an appreciative glance.  "You'll have to show me your medals later.  Captain Watson, here, then, is just continuing to serve Queen and Country, now that he has been repatriated.  A natural progression."
John spent a moment looking around the room, which was a disaster of half-unpacked boxes and chaotic unmatched furniture.  Sherlock used this as an opportunity to unfasten John's trousers and steer him towards the ugly green couch.  "You're not the most organized housekeeper in the world, are you?"
The right thing to do would be to wait, to force Sherlock to use his big-boy words and express whatever he was feeling in a full, coherent sentence.  But John recognized the look of ragged desperation that Sherlock was struggling to conceal, because he spent a great deal of time fighting it too.  Sherlock had lit his book on fire and called the kiss an experiment, and what he meant is
"To keep the experiment to affection ratio balanced.  If it goes off course, I'm liable to kick you out of bed."  He reached for the waist of his pajama bottoms and pushed them down, keeping his pants on out of some bizarre sense of propriety.  In principle, he felt there should be some sort of transition between a lead-in snog and actual genital contact.
Lestrade cleared his throat.  "John," he said, a little hesitantly.  "Um.  Is this something he usually…"  The sentence drifted off.
John forced his eyes open, and oh, yes, the eyes boring into his as sharply as ever, studying his every reaction, and the curve of those lips, so deep and red, were everything he'd found himself inappropriately fantasizing about since the moment this started.  He watched the slip of Sherlock's pink tongue dart out, the way his lips tensed and released as he slid down and then back up again, and how the shadows of his cheekbones deepened as he sucked in.  Oh, and the faint ring of red at the base of his cock, a fucking set of
, the sticker on the bottom of the tube read.  He shook himself to get the image out of his head, and went to pour himself a cup of tea.
John tried to remember if he'd seen Sherlock eat or drink anything last night before bed.  He vaguely recalled a cup of tea being lifted once or twice.  "At ten hours, I'm tying you down and putting in an IV."
that could be construed as sexual.  Even his reactions to Irene Adler seemed more about confusion than about arousal.  So, when suddenly confronted with his lovely roommate all tarted up about the mouth, John's hindbrain is necessarily going to drop all the hints that it's been suppressing this past year.
"  That was it, he was gone, groaning as he came in Sherlock's dirty gorgeous red mouth.  Sherlock kept sucking even after the last pulse had gone down his throat, and then he felt why, the shudder and gasp of him coming before he let John's cock fall out of his mouth.  John used his hands to guide Sherlock's head to rest just above his hip, and smiled when Sherlock dug his teeth in hard.
instead of sitting around staring at his naked flatmate's experiments on his own lips, but the problem with Sherlock being mad was that it was synonymous with Sherlock being interesting. And he liked it when Sherlock was interesting.  Plus, he was apparently getting a cappuccino out of the deal in however many minutes.
"I find I think better when I have someone to explain it to."  Sherlock cocked his head.  "Why, is there some other reason I should have had?"
Sherlock was lying on the couch wearing a sheet and that bloody lipstick when he clomped up the stairs.  "So, are we poisoning these or something?" he said, dropping the tray on the table.
“Oh at least that’s reasonable,” John said, wiping his eyes.  He smiled and crossed the room to George, and held out his hand.  “John Watson.  Pleasure to meet you.”
The whole way over on the bus he'd thought about how to handle meeting him again, what to say, and he'd finally decided, as soon as an opportune moment presented itself, to admit that he didn't remember much of the night before, just that he was very happy to see him again.  And if possibly he could remind John of his
Bill snorted.  "If it makes you feel better, text me where you're going when you go out, OK?  Just, please, John.  Promise me you'll do something."
John thought, quite a lot, about possible ways to get the experiment to end.  Or at least to get him to stop wearing the
John examined him so piercingly that George half felt himself about to melt away, and then turned back to the kettle and tea-tray.  The look had everything in common with how Mary looked at him sometimes, and that, precisely was it, was exactly what he had been not so subtly worrying about for six months: here was this gorgeous man, six feet tall if he was an inch, cheekbones like a supermodel and hair like a Greek god and eyes that sliced through you and an exact match to Mary, with her brilliance and her edges and the beauty that took his breath away, and George a nebbishy little nobody in a cardigan.  What the hell were they even doing together?  If this was Mary’s past, what on earth was he doing imagining he was her future?  He tried to remind himself that this was the marriage that didn’t work—that like didn’t always fit like—but next to that, what the hell did he have to offer?
When Sherlock emerged from his bedroom at eleven-thirty, hair mussed from the pillow and dressing gown tied crooked, John did his best not to grin.  He'd never seen someone wear disheveled quite as performatively as Sherlock did.  He guessed it was a side effect of sleeping so inconsistently.  He watched his flatmate flop onto the couch over the edge of his computer.  His lips were pink and smooth this morning, bearing no trace of last night's color.  "Experiment's off, then?" he asked.
John shrugged.  "Not a lot of use for a trauma surgeon with significant damage to the ulnar and radial nerves."  He held up his hand, which trembled just hanging there.  "What am I going to do, end up a GP in some little practice somewhere?  I'd die of boredom."
George sipped his pint.  John was the ex, and also the only person Mary’s phone sent messages through from if she put it on do not disturb, as he’d learned when he’d stupidly said something about her phone not having any notifications on it, and how it looked like she lived a more digitally clean life than he did.  His phone was constantly telling him things, and he had no idea how to turn it off.  Maybe she could set it up for him, he was pants at that sort of thing.
Sherlock pulled out his magnifier, leaned down, and used it to examine her lips.  "But that's pointless. Why would you apply a pigment that matches the colour you are covering up?  Isn't the point of lipstick to change the colour of the lips?"
Sherlock straddled him, still dressed, and examined his body closely.  It was sharp, the feeling of those eyes tracing his body, and John felt it more strongly than he would have if it had been those soft, supple lips.  The lower lip was the densest concentration of nerve cells on the body, but Sherlock processed visual data better than tactile.  Sherlock's eyes snapped up to his, and then he was reaching into his pocket and pulling out his phone.  Slowly, deliberately, he documented the state of his lips, and cast a glance at the photo.  Then, dramatically, he held out his hand toward the edge of the bed and dropped the phone away from them.  "Now that experimental parameters have been established," he said, "we can begin."
"I'm certain you could handle it the other way," John said.  He wondered, vaguely, if that was too raunchy for Sherlock's taste, but it was probably a bad idea to get gentlemanly now, it would just make Sherlock annoyed.  He flopped over onto his back, head on the pillow.
Oh, he was early, and this should not be making him nervous but it was, of course.  George hovered in front of the door to 221 Baker Street, rain dripping down the back of his neck, and wondered whether to ring the bell or not.  His first time to Mary’s house, and here he was, nervous as a schoolboy.  (It was a nice house.  Too nice for the likes of him?  Oh, Christ, get it together, Jeffords.)
), two packets of litmus paper, and a bunch of dead batteries before he found two lone straws, obviously sent home with takeaway at some point.  He dropped them on the counter and poured the water over the bags, and then went to investigate Sherlock, since the toilet had flushed but he hadn't yet emerged.  The bathroom door was ajar; honestly, he had no manners at all.  He pushed it open, and watched Sherlock as he stood in front of the mirror, carefully tracing his lips with the color.  The lipstick was smooth, matte without being dulling, and gave his lips a sort of plushness that wasn't apparent when they were their natural color.  John ignored the strange twinge he felt watching the process; he'd watched girlfriends do their faces before, but it had never felt so personal, or like such a great transformation, as this.  "Why did you go to Harrods, anyway?  I'd have figured you for more a Space NK kind of shopper."
He picked it up, and forced himself through an uncomfortable and vaguely confusing conversation with a headless torso who couldn't spell.  He apparently wanted to know John's favorite songs as a way of deciding whether he was interested.  John hadn't bought a CD since med school, and apparently the headless torso did not have a fondness for Peter Gabriel, because he was ditched in about five chat lines.  John locked his phone again, and set it down.
She laughed.  “We, um.  We own a building together.  An old Victorian conversion, two flats.  He’s up, I’m down, Naz’s bedroom is the attic.”
"I'm told I'm miserable at it," Sherlock said as he shoved his hands into John's trousers and vibrated the length of those long, firm fingers down his cock.  "Mostly by landlords.  I may actually have set my last flat on fire, a little bit."
“It’s Christmas.  Spoiling children is literally the point,” argued the voice of Not-John, whose name George had never actually learned.
hour), so he'd end up drinking the tea too.  He dug around in the drawers while the kettle began to rattle, pushing past a series of glass rods for stirring things in graduated cylinders, a turkey baster, a full set of piping tips (he'd lay twenty quid Sherlock didn't even know what piping tips were
There was a bruise on his forehead, of indiscriminate size and shape, dark and pronounced.  And the marks on his chest were not at all indiscriminate; they were very clearly fist-shaped, three blows.  He looked down at his hands.  Yes, his knuckles were more than a little bruised, though they didn't hurt to flex.  He leaned into the mirror and examined his body more closely.  The bruising wasn't serious; whoever he'd been fighting with had been strong, but the fight hadn't been prolonged.  Christ, had he gotten into a pub fight?  He wanted to say it wasn't something he would do, but it's possible that, if he'd got riled up, something might have tipped him into a fight.
to him that someone see him as something, not as the pathetic cripple limping around (though perhaps there would be less limping in future, he dared to hope), not as someone who'd had his life taken away from him.
"I joined the site a few weeks back.  It seemed like an interesting opportunity to deduce facts about people's lives based on how they presented themselves toward strangers.  Anyway, the results haven't been very good, people haven't been receptive to my conversations.  Some good data, but very little.  You were the first person to respond with interest."  Sherlock shrugged.  "Given your career, I assumed you would be comfortable with a bit of danger, which you most certainly are, based on last night's actions.  In addition, you expressed interest in how I work.  I thought it was worth the opportunity to meet you."
But how, precisely, do you have that conversation?  How do you tell your flatmate that his new habit of wearing lip color, for entirely non-sexual, non-aesthetic reasons, has driven you into a mad frenzy of lust?  How do you tell the person whose friendship you value most in the world that every time you see his mouth now, you want to shove him to his knees and cut off his air supply?  Is there any possible way to ask, politely, if Sherlock would mind switching to one of those more neutral shades he prefers when leaving the house, just so that John could get through one
, that was the bloke's name, and he'd messaged at half eight.  John enlarged the man's profile photo.
John considered not doing either for a minute, but he'd already drunk the whole press of coffee he'd made when he got up (at a
"I think you should fill me in," John said.  "Particularly because I have no idea what any of the things you said a minute ago actually mean."
"You do miss the most obvious things," John said, and kissed Sherlock gently on the cheek.  They were going to fall over shortly, unable to balance properly on the corner of the doorframe, but John wasn't quite sure whether he should invite Sherlock to come the rest of the way into the room, or bid him goodnight.
Sherlock returned the magnifier to his pocket, and studied her face for a moment.  "There's a Boots around the corner."
"No, absolutely not," he said, marching over to her.  "You've just become interesting, Donovan.  Explain yourself."
He forced himself to log on to Grindr and go back to therosinlessbow's profile.  And there was the little light that said he was online.  Christ.  John set his phone down.  OK.  He could do this.  There wasn't a three-day waiting period with someone you'd had anonymous internet sex with the night before, was there?  No, couldn't be.  He picked up his phone again, and then set it down and rubbed his hands over his face.  If he could only
It didn't seem terribly likely--if nothing else, he probably would have called the police, because someone like this was dangerous, picking up men online and meeting them somewhere just to hurt them.  And, no, he'd been
: Here, I'll text you now.  If you have any other improvised weapons you can bring along now that the cane's gone, they'd probably be useful.  Must dash, if I don't monitor this reaction half of Marlyebone will be radioactive tomorrow.
"Rochester.  When he hit you with your cane."  The man gestured towards the bruise on John's forehead, which he had tried in vain to hide with his hair.  "You managed to disable him after that, but not before taking a few more hits.  How little do you remember of last night?"
: All right is two words, not one.  It's a common mistake.  I should give you my number so you can text me.
John poured the tea and added milk from the carton Sherlock had, unsurprisingly, left on the counter.  He tried to mentally reconstruct the post-lipstick morning rituals of Angela, who he'd lived with during his house officer years.  "I think it's less about time and more about the lipstick…drying?  Or setting, maybe?  So that you'd be able to feel when it's changed texture.  I mean, someone in a hurry might take a sip of a cup of coffee sooner than that, if she wanted it."
“Hey, thanks for coming.” Watson came to a stop next to Sherlock, but didn’t move to open his locker.
They are all delighted to receive a visit from Siger and Olive's newest family member, but he's looking for more than superficial aggrandizing. He wants intelligent interaction, someone with whom he can undertake daring exploration, important observation, and relevant work. He's not sure what the work might be, or how it will be relevant, but he knows he's meant for more than ice slide racing and Mother's cuddles.
“Yeah, we had the first one at home, the one I brought to school that time. I remember you were so dismissive of it, because it was a comic, but then you read some of it, and said maybe it wasn't so dumb after all, and you sat next to me on the bus all the time after that, and I knew I had to get more books. To keep you.”
“Is this a bad time? I thought you wanted me to become more familiar with pop culture,” Sherlock answers as he and John switch places, Sherlock straddling John's hips and lowering himself flat, belly-to-belly, to steal a kiss between giggles.
This is a short one, but I didn't want to go on and on about Sherlock and Mycroft's journey to the shelf. I have a tendency to draw things out waaaaaaay past the point of necessity, and I think what we all want right now is for them
John nudged his head in the direction of the microphone. Mycroft was talking about the time Sherlock solved his first case by identifying poisoned cream on a young man’s shoes, and John was beaming at him with pride.
John took his time undoing Sherlock’s layers, kissing under his ear and down his neck as the robe slid to the floor, then his chest and shoulders and belly as the long-sleeve top and tank top came off. He stroked the cords of muscle running down Sherlock’s back and kissed his pecs and nipples and sternum. He only stopped when Sherlock moved to strip off John’s T-shirt and tug him back onto the bed, and then Sherlock laid John out against the pillows and returned all those kisses, all those caresses. Chest to chest, legs intertwined, they explored, unhurried and content. When Sherlock’s lips felt tender and pink and his fingertips were hot from John’s skin under them, he let John roll him onto his back and reach for and remove the white silk pyjama bottoms and boxers. He let John sit back between his spread thighs, his canted knees, and touch the arches of his feet, his calves, his inner thighs.
“C’mere, lean down,” John panted, so Sherlock put his hands on John's chest, and John put his hands around Sherlock's waist, and began thrusting up into the rhythm Sherlock set, his thighs slapping against Sherlock's ass each time he drove up and in.
He is within steps of Erebus now, but his friend seems lost in his own world, and unaware of Sherlock’s presence.
“I can give you my list right now: Harry, if she’s out of rehab by then, Bill Murray, Mike Stamford, and James Sholto.”
Sherlock pushed back from the table and picked up his half-finished meal and the empty bottle of wine. “I’ll just bring these into the kitchen.”
“How long do you think this will last?” she asks him, turning her head to be heard over the wail of the storm.
“Apparently Ayn Rand wrote it about Wright, but despite repeated requests he wouldn’t meet her for an interview. She finished the book without having met him or seen any of his work. I guess they became friends after that, but I’m not sure he ever read the book.”
“You’re perfect,” he said, and Sherlock opened his eyes and blinked back at this man who had just been kissing him and now was saying the impossible.
“Well, so were his deductions, to be honest. I have no idea what my watch says about anything, but everything he said was brilliant.”
In the distance he heard the crunch of rubber on gravel, gears downshifting, the rumble of a V8 208hp engine. The truck came closer, then the engine cut out, spluttering and hissing before letting out a final few bangs. A door creaked open, and slammed shut.
. John is easy enough to find. He is the only other peng standing still, watching Sherlock over the heads of Erebel and her peers. He’s looking to make sure Sherlock is all right. Sherlock nods. He’s all right.
The John in this story is begging me to let him use terms of endearments for Sherlock, but the one that seems most natural to me, and that I use the most in my other fics,
Sherlock crossed the room and knelt between John’s legs. He wrapped his arms around his waist and buried his face in his stomach. He breathed him in.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock continued. “I’m not being fair. I kiss you and touch you and tell you how badly I want you, then complain we can’t do more when it’s me who’s decided we can’t do more in the first place. It’s not fair to you. I’m not trying to be a tease.”
The two chicks flit and flutter until they’re arranged at her side, stretching as tall as their snowball shaped bodies will allow in order to catch a glimpse of their leader and the legendary hunter as they approach.
“Mycroft! You're home, and after a tremendously successful hunt, I see.” Sherlock taps his brother's well-insulated belly and ducks back before Mycroft can slap his wing away.
The bell for their floor dinged, and they stepped apart and out of the elevator. John turned left, Sherlock turned right.
Sherlock closed his book and ran his fingertips along the spine. “This has been extraordinary. Thank you.”
John’s voice startled him out of his detail-gathering. He spun from the scene in front of him and back to John.
John locked eyes with Sherlock. “You’re not suggesting James actually date this guy? If you know who he is, why not just go after him now?”
Sherlock lies on his stomach, asleep, unaware of his little bee messenger. The sheets are twisted around his splayed thighs, his curved bottom half-exposed. His arms are flung out to the sides, and he's managed to burrow his face in both his and John's pillows. Sherlock's hair is spread over the linens in every which direction, curls of silver and sable and all the shades between sticking out in an unruly mess. He wears it longer now, and even after all these years, John can never stop touching it. The hair at the nape of Sherlock's neck is still just as dark as when they first met, and John likes to burrow his nose there and imprint Sherlock's scent in his memory. As if he could ever erase it.
Sherlock turned the doorknob and pushed the door open a few inches, curiosity trumping caution. John, nearly flush against his back, whispered, “Careful.” Sherlock could feel him go up on his toes in an effort to see more.
Then, just like that, over a weekend in March of their senior year of high school, John Watson went and changed. On Friday he was the same, but on Monday he was different. Sherlock knew it shouldn’t be possible, but he could’ve sworn John’s shoulders were broader, and his forearms more heavily veined. His jaw was squarer. His thighs were stronger, thicker in his Levi’s, and those Levi's now cupped him just so. Just like that, Sherlock found himself sitting next to his best friend in the bleachers during lunch period, wondering what those thighs would look like, trembling, on either side of his bobbing head.
Laffitte sat down and pushed the shot toward John, who ignored it, then took a sip from his own cocktail. He rested his elbows on the table and his chin on the back of his crossed hands. John took a drink of his soda, and smiled into the glass as he set it back down on the table. It looked as if he were being coy, but Sherlock knew John simply wasn’t ready to smile at the man sitting across from him.
John was talking about Highland cattle and grazing, or something along those lines, but Sherlock was distracted by his inability to find the right words to describe John’s hands. Strong? Yes, that word was right. Cute? No. Agile? Maybe. Dexterous? Yes. Maybe. Sexy? Yes. That was the right word. God, what was wrong with him? He needed to focus on something other than John’s skin and fingers and eyes and smile and lips and ears and eyelashes.
is Arabic, and means "chooses the right path." I thought it was perfect for Mrs Hudson, who has been sadly absent until now.
“Fine. I see how it is. Boys, this has been an absolute pleasure, and I do hope we'll meet again. Greg, you are no longer allowed to accept a date without conferring with me, first.” Molly shoved her phone back into her purse, wrapped her scarf around her neck, and got up to go.
It was surprisingly light inside, no doubt from the large windows set in the thick ground floor walls, but damp and chilly. Sherlock set the bag and hamper down and looked into the room to the right of him, which was part of the original structure and set up as a library. “Fascinating. I take it this was once a watchtower before it became a home?”
Steady on there, John, Sherlock thought to himself, imagining the wheels in John's mind shifting into gear and making the same crotch-pillow-connections he had already made.
“You didn’t uncover the worst of me in a couple of seconds, though, did you? Maybe I’m not looking for someone else’s idea of ‘suitable marriage material.’ And I’d love to hear you play the violin sometime.”
The image was from that same visit, but a different day. The four of them stood on the front porch of their house, posed and smiling for the camera. Sherlock wondered if this was the last shot taken by Kevin’s family before they drove back downstate. It had an air of finality about it, but maybe that was about something else.
And if John, thinking about the utter bliss of that sucking mouth on body parts other than fingers, wove his own fingers into the curls just under the crown of Sherlock’s gorgeous skull, and if he pulled just an iota harder than one should while dining out with friends, and if Sherlock’s eyes slammed shut while he moaned loud enough for the party next to them to hear him, then certainly Mycroft was not out of line to ask Sherlock if his stomach was still at him.
They were standing on the precipice, backs to the water, with their arms around each other’s waists. The sky spoke of early evening, and their lips had a blue tinge to them. The chill in the air hadn’t stopped them, though. They had practiced jumping off the rock slab into the water over and over and over again. Jumping wasn’t unusual; they jumped all the time. Jumping backwards with their arms around each other, holding on the entire way down, though, had been a challenge.
“The horror,” Sherlock said, pulling the offending vest out of John’s jeans and reaching for his belt buckle. Belt undone and tossed to the floor, he positioned himself between John’s legs, hips to hips, belly to belly, and wrapped John in his arms. “I’m going to take very good care of you, you know. I’m going to, well, I don’t know exactly what I’m going to do as I’ve never done it before, but I’m going to take care of you and it’s going to be wonderful.”
“I plan to implement the next stage of this journey, brother mine. I’ll be taking my leave in short order.”
Annette’s mission went smoothly and provided them with a wealth of data, the most important of which was that Daniel was not staying on his own. Based on what Annette observed and the dozens of photos she’d taken with her phone, his companion was most likely a woman with a size five shoe, medium-length brunette hair, and a penchant for lesbian romance novels. Neither had packed more than three days worth of clothing. Annette had found no weapons in the hotel room, but this did not surprise Sherlock. He suspected the sniper had hidden the tools of her trade in a locker at the train station and worked surveillance of that spot into his multi-layered plans.
“They couldn't be, not — oh. Oh, of course. They didn't need a calling, or a parade. Of course they were bonded.
John rolled his fingers in light circles over the front of Sherlock's jeans. “Ejaculation is the expulsion of sperm, which are produced in the testes and stored in the epididymis. During ejaculation, sperm are propelled up the vas deferens, which are two ducts that pass behind the bladder. Fluids are added by the seminal vesicles, then the vas deferens become the ejaculatory ducts, which join the urethra inside the prostate gland. The prostate and the bulbourethral glands add their own secretions, and then,
“No! No, you’re fine, you should definitely sleep the way you usually do. If you don’t usually wear a shirt then please, do not wear one for my benefit. I would actually not benefit in any way from you wearing a shirt, so no shirts will be necessary.”
As he ponders the mythological sea-faring transport, his eye catches a movement, just a speck of a movement, from the nearest shore of the island. Excitement surges through him before he has a chance to consider the possibilities. His heart knows before his mind comprehends; nothing would move toward the huddle in the deepest stretch of night that wasn’t adventurous and important and pivotal for them all.
“Okay.” John ran his hand through his hair and puffed out a breath. “Let’s have a quickie, just to like, you know, take the edge off. But not too much because we need to do it right tonight.”
“There. Right there.” He held on to John’s cock as John slowly tilted his hips, and moved forward. He watched Sherlock’s face the entire time, scanning for any discomfort, any reason to stop. Sherlock smiled, a small lifting of the corners of his mouth, and nodded.
“Anyway,” Sherlock continued, “what are your plans for the weekend, while John and I are exploring Bucktown and Logan Square?”
“You seemed kind and wise and essential to me then, and you feel even moreso now. Ancient, I believe, must be a state of mind, just like being bonded to another is a state of mind. Do you feel ancient, Erebus?”
John tightened the lug nut and glanced over at Sherlock, who was very busy scowling at the truck’s carburetor.

Sherlock had been too busy warding off like-colored boyfriend-stealers with his masterful death-glares to have noticed Greg’s handkerchiefs. He took a sip of his drink, evaluated the concoction as it slid down his throat, and took another long slurp.
“It was so lovely of you to come. Not at all. No, the reason I called was that you left your scarf here. At least, I think it’s yours. Light blue, wool? Mmhmm, I thought so."
“How can you even say that?” Sherlock withdrew to the bathroom and slammed the door closed behind him. He sat on the edge of the bathtub and lowered his face into his shaking palms.
He knows John is on the other side of the huddle, but should he go to the right, or to the left? Which way will get him to John fastest? Why are all these pengs in his way?
Sherlock rolled over onto his stomach and rested his cheek on his folded arms, and John rolled onto his side and ran his fingers up and down Sherlock's toasty warm back.
“Over there, near the doors to the bathroom, you’ll find a big box of handkerchiefs. There’s a list of colors taped to the wall above it. Kevin and I are in the Glass Bar, and tonight’s frozen cocktail special is the Ketel One Krush, so if you like Vodka, get that.”
to begin. Sherlock's neck is sore from snogging John senseless, and John is leaning heavily on Sherlock, flank to flank, a blissed out expression on his face.
Sherlock blinks, still groggy, his mind reaching for something that happened a long time ago. He sighs.
Apologies, dear pengs, for posting this so late. I have been away the last two weeks, and arrived home yesterday after a long, international flight.
"Hey, no, it's all right. And I know it wasn't the last time you drugged me, so don't worry about that, either. I trust you. Lord knows why, but I do."
When his queue was full, which he now knew happened once a person had three-hundred posts lined up and ready to go, Sherlock adjusted the settings to post twenty-five posts per day, which would bring him right to the end of the four weeks and the end of the bet, and hopefully, into John's arms.
"Yes, I know. I know. Right, well, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that. There's been a change."
John cupped Sherlock’s ass and backed him up against the wall, then whispered in his ear, “Count of three, other leg up. Ready?”
Sherlock's mouth is magic, his tongue is bliss, his lips are a miracle. All three are working John's cock now, and Sherlock's desperate enthusiasm is as arousing as the blow job he's giving. He keens and grunts as he sucks, and John is quickly losing the ability to think whatsoever, let alone clearly. He does pull back, though, and when he tells Sherlock to wait, they are both gasping for air, flushed and sweating.
John combed his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, catching tangles, lifting and releasing his sweaty curls, and Sherlock sighed, all of him going limp and soft in John’s arms.
Sherlock, taking the unexpected role of devil’s advocate, asked if even the spectacular could be made better with the addition of, well, something additional.
“The colors you wore signified what you liked. For example, dark blue is for, um, you know –” Greg looked around and lowered his voice, “penetrating, or being penetrated. Light blue is for oral, fuschia is for spanking, and so on. There are probably about fifty colors –”
“Hundreds of cars were towed off the streets, including those of elderly people who couldn't get their cars shoveled out. Bilandic told them they should just protest their tickets in court, and explain their hardships to the judge, since that's what judges were for.
And what of the bigger issues? He was going to see John naked when John moved in. Well, actually, he’d see John naked the first night of their married life, wouldn’t he? And the only reason John would be naked would be because they would be expected to have sexual relations, and what was Sherlock going to do about that? He’d have to be naked, too. Oh, there’d be so much skin-to-skin contact, and Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d be able to cope with that, not if it meant ceding control of his body to John and losing control of his mind.
“My Lord, is that really the time?” Sarah said. “I’ve got a date in Dodgeville tonight, so I’d best be going so that I have enough time to get ready.” She stood up and brushed down the nonexistent crumbs on her skirt. “I’m sorry to eat, ask, and run, but I do need to go. John, Sherlock, will you walk me out? Mrs. Watson, thank you again, so much.” She leaned forward, wrapped Mrs. Watson in her arms, and patted her on the back. She was halfway to the front door before John’s mom came back to her senses.
Sherlock turned in John’s arms and started kicking all the covers off again. “Burning up. So hot. Why is it so hot?”
back. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t believe in goddesses and magical seal teeth and all that. I believe it was easier to blame our disagreements on something outside of us, and so that’s what we did. I believe it was easier to wait for someone else to fix it for us so that we didn’t have to do it ourselves. I believe you gave us two paths to choose from. We can believe you found the relic of Kororā’s love and brought
It was about this time that John woke up and found his mouth sucking on Sherlock's neck and his hand wrapped around his solid, mutinous erection. Sherlock stilled, waiting for the yelling and shouting and jumping around that would commence shortly, but John didn't move. Instead, he removed his fingers from Sherlock's penis, turned his hand over, and began stroking it with the back of his curled fingers.
“Sherlock, son. Listen. I do not tell you our story to upset you, though it certainly was a very difficult time for both of us. I tell you the tale so that you can prepare. Times are different now, and you and John may not face the same adversity that Selvic and I did. Your parents are loving, open, intelligent pengs. They have not pushed Mycroft to mate; they are letting him take his own path. But there are others, on the council and beyond, who are very set in their ways, and who may cause trouble for you when it is your time. They may not do so, of course. I cannot say definitively, but you need to look into your future, and be ready.”
John pouted and the woman taking their order tapped her pen on the stainless steel top of the glass bakery case.
Sherlock furrowed his brow and inched a piece across the open cardboard box and toward his wad of napkins. After securing it in his palm, he slowly rotated it, narrow point of the wedge facing him, and sniffed at it.
“You said it was a death threat? I suppose it is the sort of thing I’d usually enjoy getting involved in.”
“I don’t know what to think. I’ve never been a believer. I’ve always taken the legends at face value, as parables and nothing more. But Mycroft, I
Sherlock looks up from John’s shoulder and peers around. “They’re chasing after Molling’s little one, who is chasing after Stamfjord’s little one. And, somehow, they’re losing ground. Oh, no. Kahu just tackled Ariki, and – oh, for heaven’s sake.”
Mycroft manages only slightly better; a half formed slip of a smile, but a smile nonetheless. “And I you, little brother. When will you go, then?”
“That every time we get in bed together, you feel like you’re going to die if you don’t get your hands on me as fast as humanly possible.”
He'd only just figured it out when the door to his bedroom opened a crack, then a bit more, and then enough for the hallway nightlight to cast one very sneaky John Watson into silhouette.
Sherlock tells Mycroft that he will sleep on this request, and answer him in the morning, and Mycroft accepts this compromise, presumably, Sherlock suspects, because he knows it’s the best response he’s going to get right now.
"Pōrangi looked and looked. She had everything she needed; she had strength, and speed, and agility. She was clever, too. But there was one thing Pōrangi was missing, and it was that one thing that caused her to fail. Pōrangi lacked
“It's not possible to mess this up. I promise. Just tell me if you don't like it. Don't do it if it bothers you.”
. The campus is on the lakeshore, and has an amazing view of the city. Oh, and Soldier Field (where the Chicago Bears play - that's American football for you non-Americans), and McCormick Place (the largest convention center in North America) are part of the same park.
John’s expression was one of unrestrained joy. He wasn't holding his breath anymore, either; in fact, it looked like he might have been yodeling, or howling. His eyes were shut, and his free arm was straight out at this side, his fingers spread wide, like he was grabbing at life as he plummeted backwards twenty feet into shocking cold water with his best friend by his side.
“I'm going to slide into your ass now. I'm pushing forward and you're eating me up inch by inch. You’re stretching so big for me, so tight, God, so tight.” John was going breathless. Sherlock wriggled back and forth and John let out a long breath around a burst of “Oh!” and pushed in further. “There you go, taking it, so good, taking all of me. You’re so good, you’re so good to me, Sherlock, Jesus Christ. I’m—oh—feel that? I’m as far as I can go, you amazing man, you—”
John’s lips twitched, but he did as he was told, tugging his shirt up and out of his jeans on his way back to Sherlock.
Sherlock keened. “Kind of. But it doesn't matter, it's all hypothetical. Please, just do it, it's going to be so good. Forget the physics, John, just do it.”
Sherlock was pretty sure that John’s body was perfect, and would be no matter how his inches lined up. Sixty-six inches tall, fifteen around the neck, thirty around the waist, thirty down the leg, and there, just there, four-and-a-half beautiful, flaccid inches, almost seven when erect, and hello, four-and-a-half marvelous inches thick.
John turned the phone off and joined Sherlock under the covers. He kissed the tip of his nose and threw his leg over Sherlock’s hip. “How could you see it so clearly for Kevin and Greg, two people you hardly know, but not see how perfect we were for each other?”
He catches her, lifts her up and twirls her around, her arms coming up around his neck and her slight legs flying out behind her. One slipper flies off into a hedge and she squeals, then kicks the other off and presses her nose to his, squeezing her arms around his neck, tight tight tight.
“You don't believe me? This little lady will go get water, then stand at the entrance of the hive and fan her wings while releasing the water, thereby cooling the air inside.”
He heard John shout something about Jesus, felt John’s hand fall away as he jerked and went shushed-still against him. They clung to each other, bodies taut through the aftershocks, and then slowly, as if climbing down from something precarious, they relaxed into each other.
Definitely graduate students, then. The restaurant had done well with the older students who wanted a less clubby scene in which to drink and nibble on plates of crostini and olives late into the night, and Sherlock was glad to see that business was going well.
Sherlock wriggles to turn over and John shifts to make it easier, then lowers himself back down, hips aligned, head on Sherlock's shoulder. He feels Sherlock's hands run lightly up and down his back and under the waistband of his pyjama bottoms, stopping only when they are cupping John's arse and softly kneading the smooth, warm flesh. He sighs, relaxed and at home in Sherlock's arms. Sherlock rubs his nose through John's short, grey hair and presses one small kiss to the crown of his head.
“That's right, Imi. I married Mary, and Mary and I had your mama, and then when your mama was about six months old, Mary moved away. So then I moved back to Baker Street, with your mama, and Sherlock and I raised her together, and then when she was all grown up she met your dad, and they had you.”
Sherlock rolled to his side and caught John’s arm before he moved away. His grip was weak, more of a gesture than a barrier to leaving, but John sat down again and ran his fingers down Sherlock’s neck.
The shorter of the two fluff balls, which is not saying much, as neither of them reach Sherlock’s hip, flutters his wings, and says, “That’s what we call you,
“Sherlock, you are exactly who are you, no more, no less. You are happier with him, but not better. If you say that being happier allows you to be better, I will say you are allowing his absence to let yourself be less. He wouldn’t want that, would he?”
John smiled, but shook his head. “But Hobbes wasn’t imaginary to Calvin. That's the whole point. No matter what everyone else saw, he was smart and witty and protective of Calvin, and no matter how frustrated he got with Calvin’s ridiculous ideas and experiments and adventures, he stuck by him.”
They grinned at each other, then Sherlock turned and put his hand on John’s arm. “Do you remember John Watson?”
John peered around Sherlock’s bicep and nodded. “It looks like you’re getting aroused now. We can do some experiments. Do you have a tape measure?”
John rolled onto his back first, lifted his hips, and tugged off his underwear, then moved to the middle of the bed and onto his stomach. Sherlock sat over John’s upper thighs, then reached behind him to pull the covers up and over his shoulders.
Sherlock flops down on the bed at John's side and sighs as he feels John's fingers undoing Imi's hard work. John places each of the barrettes and elastics on the nightstand, and soon there's a small pile of them competing for space with the newspaper, his reading glasses, and a glass of water. He tells Sherlock to roll over so he can get the remaining plaits and ponytails undone, and then runs his fingers through the mop running riot on Sherlock's head, trying to tame the frizz and kinks.
Sherlock sat up and let John hold a glass of ice water to his mouth. He took a few sips and licked the chill from his lips, then slid a little lower in his seat and curled back into John.
Sherlock wanted to kiss John for lots of reasons. He wanted to kiss him for the way he loved pizza, and for how polite he was to the person who sold him the pizza, and for trying to get Sherlock to eat pizza, too. He wanted to kiss him because John was thoughtful, and spent twenty minutes trying to decide if Harry would prefer raspberry or vanilla scented lotion, and because he was buying his mom Christmas presents as if she weren’t currently accusing him of making the biggest mistake of his life. He wanted to kiss John because John was good, and John deserved to be kissed.
And now here Sherlock was, licking circles around his boyfriend’s asshole, finding that he liked it much more than he thought he would, because John’s breathing told him he was already falling to pieces, and Sherlock hadn't really even done anything yet.
“I was crazy about him. I spent an inordinate amount of time imagining what it would be like if he touched me, if he kissed me, if we were, you know, together. And then, one day he did. He touched me. We were sitting on the bank of a small stream near his house. It was warm and we’d been out most of the day. I remember that I was sweating and my shirt was damp and sticking to my back. His was, too. I thought he was beautiful like that, breathing hard from our hike, his clothes clinging to him.”
The two of them are hissing at each other, trying not to have a repeat of what happened a few mornings ago, when Lestra and Molling woke up and overheard them talking about their stolen ice cave treasure.
John had him roll over, then hovered over him, cupped his cheek, rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s lower lip. “Tell me.”
John's entire hand joined the party of its own volition, and then his lips were sent out to locate Sherlock's neck, and then Sherlock's vocal cords got all pissy that they weren't involved, and decided to let out a shockingly indecent moan. Sherlock bit his tongue, even though his tongue had not been remotely involved in the coup thus far, and his tongue retaliated by ordering his saliva glands to go into overdrive.
“Isn’t it? I used to love coming here as a kid. We’d spend the whole day, go fishing, have lunch, nap, whatever we wanted to do. My parents would bring a bottle of wine and let us run around to our hearts’ content.”
John ran his thumbs over Sherlock’s hips and rested his forehead on his shoulder. His voice was muffled, but Sherlock heard him clearly enough. “Yeah, maybe it’s in part because of today, but that’s because I want it to be a different day for you. I want you to have better memories. I mean, you can’t erase the ones you have, but you can add new ones. And if I can take care of you at the same time, it’s kind of win-win.”
John sighed. “She pretty much gave me the silent treatment, except for saying things like, ‘I was beginning to think you might never come back,’ and ‘I don't suppose you'll have time to help your dad get that barn door back on track?’”
“Yes, you’re a real champ, Rocky. The point, however, is that Laffitte happens to be Greg’s ex-boyfriend.”
“Because you’re so brave, John, and so good, and you saved their lives today. It’s very, um, appreciation-making.”
John leans back on his elbows and looks up at the gorgeous work of art in front of him. “Oh, I bet he was very, very happy to help you. Did he pick these out for you, help you put them on? Did he touch you, Sherlock?”
John flipped through his notes and turned the pages back when he found what he was looking for. “I did. These places sounded good to me. Ready?”
Sherlock was on fire inside, every sensation a quickening toward his cock and balls, an encroaching tide to John’s pull, and his mind was a mute witness, watching, waiting, an outsider to his body’s storm.
“I didn’t see it until we got out of the elevator! I swear!” John was doubled over, backing up until he could sit on the edge of the bed. “I’m sorry,” he wheezed. “I am. Really.”
“We have worked for endless cycles of the sun to locate that tooth, to ensure that Pono is never resurrected, that her ill-begotten offspring never hatches. I was more than willing to play your silly game if it meant I could get close enough.”
“Yeah, you are. Totally adorable. Come on,” John said, pulling off his towel and swatting Sherlock with it. “Let’s get dressed and go get all the hankies.”
“Oh, you. Now you really are going to make me cry. Go get dressed and then the two of you come on down for breakfast.”
John shuffles closer to Sherlock as he talks, warm and cuddly with the last shadows of sleep. Sherlock wraps his wings around him, and tries to pull him closer, but John fidgets, trying to find his own comfort.
The bishop’s blathering droned on for at least fifteen minutes, a veritable eternity, and then John was sliding a ring on his finger and talking, so Sherlock tuned in again in time to hear him repeat his name, his promises, and then say, “I do.” Sherlock felt a small chill move up his spine at that, because John had just vowed to take Sherlock as his own, to have and to hold, and wasn’t that an amazing thing?
“We’ll pay for it together, however you want. We’ll figure it out.” Sherlock released his vine-like grip on John and flipped the book open. John had inscribed the first page.
The moon waxes and wanes, and one morning, after he smacks his bill awake,  checks on the pouch, and stretches, Sherlock turns around and sees the Shelf. It is a thick band of ice resting on the milky blue horizon, the thin edges of its parent continent curving away in either direction.
Sherlock reached out a tentative hand and placed it on John’s knee. John covered it with his own and smiled, but didn’t open his eyes. Sherlock tried not to think about what they’d be doing right now had things gone according to plan. For one thing, they’d be in the bed and not sitting on the floor next to it. Maybe they’d still be asleep, or maybe they’d be waking each other up with slow kisses and roaming fingertips. Either way, he was sure they’d both be naked and ready to celebrate the previous night of sex with even more sex. Sherlock wondered if they’d have stayed in bed for hours and hours, bringing each other pleasure before slipping back to sleep, then waking to do it all over again.
Sherlock loved to dance. He was pretty good at it, too, having learned a few of the basic dance steps from his mother when he was small. He had happy but receding memories of her turning the kitchen radio up loud and leading him around the kitchen table, through the family room, and into the office where his father was working.
The seal has dropped Tui in an attempt to locate her attacker, but Anahera has plunged out of sight, no doubt circling around to attack again. Sensing no danger, the mighty predator turns back to Tui, who is dropping like a stone toward the seafloor, blood trailing behind her.
They agree to meet right after lunch at the path that leads to the cave, and Hudi hustles away to tell the other Senior pengs about the change in her afternoon plans.
“Oh, but I did, Sherlock.” Anahera leans in close, and Sherlock has the briefest glimmer of a thought that she is about to share a very important secret. He leans in toward her.
“That’s a nice break. Maybe we could get together for lunch or something while you’re home.” She directed the comment to her lunch, but Sherlock assumed she was speaking to John, so he let John answer.
Sherlock leaned over to see out John’s window, and raised an eyebrow. “I think it’s just for their branded apparel. T-shirts and leather jackets and things like that.” He gave John an appraising look. “But you’d look good on a hog, John.”
John sucked at the side of Sherlock’s cock, then kissed the flare of its sloping head, ran the tip of his tongue along the ridge of it, and opened his mouth wide.
He took another sip of his fourth glass of Grande Réserve Brut, slumped in the opposite directions of the bubbles and said, “Whoever came up with the idea of pairing Champagne with cheese is a genius.”
Sherlock crossed the room and crawled in next to John, curling into his open arms and the warmth of his body. John's fingertips scrolled over Sherlock's back and dipped into the waistband of his briefs.
They conclude the meeting, and dive back into the water, each of them frustrated and worried. The swim back to the iceberg is short, and when they resurface John and Sherlock see their friends gathered around the swimming hole, playing Lestra’s ice chip game.
“However, Mycroft has been called to serve the High Council, and one might argue that he can serve his prophecy as well from there, as he would here, by Sherlock’s side.”
“What's not fair … is that you aren't in me right now.” Sherlock was whining, and he really didn’t care.
John finished removing the g-string, sliding it down Sherlock’s legs and over his feet before crumpling it into a ball and pressing it to his face. His expression spoke of doing something much more significant than removing a piece of clothing. He looked reverent, beholden. He looked like he was diffusing a bomb.
Angelo that John was his boyfriend, wondering if John was embarrassed or confused or offended or if he even cared at all. He conjured up a flashing stop sign in his head, a little trick he’d learned to stop runaway, useless, spiralling thoughts like these.
He reached down, grasped John’s arse in both hands, and flexed upward. That movement may have been purposeful, but the next one, a full body shudder, was the result of Sherlock involuntarily responding to John’s obscene groan.
“The urethra traverses the corpus spongiosum and the meatus and passes through the prostate gland. It serves as a passage for urine and ejaculation.”
“I know, but you also know that John and I would’ve been just as happy going to the village clerk and having this done in less than five minutes.”
It was more than Sherlock could stand, to spread his usual reserve of steadfastness so thin, to be speared on the reach of his own heart, spilling open everything he had worked so hard to protect for so long, and so he pulled John forward by the collar of his shirt and then tilted him up with his hands on either side of his face, and he kissed him. When he couldn’t kiss him any longer for fear of passing out, he rested his forehead on the top of John’s head and breathed, and when John said, “Yes, of course, I’ll love you. Of course I will. I already do, you fool. Of course I do,” Sherlock thought he might pass out for real.
He undid the last two buttons of John’s jeans, and pulled the tails of his shirt out. He tugged it off John’s shoulders and arms, dropped it to the floor, and brought his hands back to John’s chest. His fingers traced the subtle curves of John’s pecs, and circled his tight little nipples, and then trailed lower, down his belly, finding and following the soft line of hair disappearing into his jeans.
In the near distance, Ariki brushes Erebel off and pats her on the head. Sherlock cannot hear what they’re saying but can hear them laughing. Erebel loves her pengsitters, and they love her. There are times when Hudi, Anahera, Tui, or even one of their mothers mind the little feather-covered snowstorm, but she has made it abundantly clear that she prefers her
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and rubbed his face into his hair. John kissed the side of Sherlock’s neck and exhaled a long breath of relief, then pulled back, arms still circled around Sherlock’s waist, and said, “Let’s exchange gifts, then get naked, and go to bed.”
Sherlock sighs and looks up at the stars in the ever-dark winter sky. “Handsome? Handsome does not begin to describe him, Tui. He is broad shouldered, and solidly built. He is shorter than me by perhaps half a head, but what he lacks in stature he makes up for with strength, and determination, and courage.
Sherlock listened to those with half his attention, choosing instead to focus on the warmth radiating off of the man next to him. He was so small to be such a furnace, wasn’t he? But sitting this close, thigh to thigh, Sherlock could feel the heat of him through his trousers. That caused him to shiver, and wasn’t that ironic? Sherlock pressed his leg a little harder against John’s and John glanced at him and smiled, then patted his knee.
, as your little friend said. I was tending to Tui’s dressings, and she did not pay us any attention.”
Anahera nods. “I am almost six winters old. My hatchday is toward the end of the hatching season, one of the last days.”
Sherlock sat up and rubbed his eyes. John was kneeling at the end of the bed, looking out the window, with the blanket draped over his shoulders. Sherlock crawled down to join him, and John held the blanket up and wrapped it back over both of them.
Sherlock didn’t respond right away but instead disappeared into his mind palace to quickly review his files. When he came back James was pouring them all another cup of tea and John was adding a log to the fire.
Sherlock nods in acknowledgment, then hears them move off; John’s footprints heavy and even, Erebel’s light and quick next to his.
When Sherlock is naked, standing in front of John with his hands on his hips and his cock jutting out, John pushes him back toward the bed and presses their bodies together. He reaches under Sherlock’s balls and fondles them, caressing the base of his shaft with his thumb. Sherlock’s mouth falls open, and John sucks his bottom lip into his mouth and growls.
–” Sherlock heard John jerking himself off behind him, fast and furious, and then felt lashes of come stripe his back.
John tugged Sherlock in the direction of the hotel a little faster, and Sherlock waxed poetic about John’s heroics a little louder.
Sherlock opened his eyes and smiled. He couldn’t see John, but his breath ghosted over his ear, and ruffled his hair. John was warm and heavy and his lips were wet wherever they touched Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock didn't necessarily see the problem with this scenario, but he could tell that John didn't find the arse cheek balancing situation all that appealing. He shimmied over a bit, giving John the perception that he had more room, but as soon as he felt he had waited long enough for John to relax his defences, he pulled his legs up to the side and reclined his torso until his face was in John's lap. He counted to three; surely John would protest by then if he was going to. At the count of ten John let out a long sigh and said, “You are such an insufferable prat.”
Thank you for the cheerleading, Happierstill. You ease my pangs of self-doubt and motivate me to keep going, and I appreciate it so much.
Then, in a stroke of genius, Sherlock lowered his head and covered John's erection with his own long curls, nudging his head from side to side, and John swore under his breath.
“Sherlock, there really isn’t anything I don’t know about you, including that you can be kind of insecure in spite of being the smartest, sexiest, most interesting person I’ve ever met. You couldn’t do anything that would ruin it for me. Not that I want you to test that premise or anything.”
“Ha, ha. Do you really not know any of this bible stuff?” John stopped at the flashing red light at Main and 1st, then turned left and headed out of town, toward the freeway.
Sherlock zipped through his mental files and pulled up the color chart again. Uniform? Like a cop? A UPS delivery guy? Fireman?
John had been plastered to Sherlock’s side since they’d woken up that morning. He’d touched Sherlock awake, kissed and held him, showered with him, held his hand in the elevator, sat thigh-to-thigh with him on the bus, and now he was eating a donut with his right hand while resting his left on Sherlock’s knee.
“Oh fuck, don't stop, don't stop, just like that – God, your mouth, your fucking mouth, yeah, gonna come, gonna, gonna, coming –”
The others have stopped talking, and are looking at him. He doesn’t know what they’ve said. Perhaps they asked him something. It doesn’t matter. “I’m sorry. I am not feeling well. I do not mean to be rude, but I wonder if Elder Rika might meet with us, sooner rather than later. I don’t think I’ll be able to –”
They drove on, following the subtle curves of the shady, quiet street. Within five minutes the view gave way to a round, dome-topped building, covered in what looked to be intricate carvings of symbols, inscriptions, and filigree patterns.
Sherlock feels soft and smooth on the ice, his muscles turned to sea jelly, his eyelids weighted down with sweet exhaustion. The feathers under his tail are warm and slick, and his legs and back ache. He feels absolutely wonderful. He is swimming in a sea of elation, and would be content to drown there.
John smiled, and Sherlock smiled back, whether because of emotional sensations looping into those more physical, or because of subconscious joy at his continued survival, he couldn’t discern. He didn’t care. John Watson had kissed Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock was ready when John picked him up, almost exactly one hour after bringing him breakfast in bed. Sherlock bolted down the stairs and out the front door, hoping to avoid Mrs. Hudson and her headphones. He pulled on his hat and gloves once he was in the truck, and tapped his boots on the plastic mat under his feet to dislodge the snow.
“Good. You understand.” Sherlock nibbles his way down John’s neck and snuggles the top of his head into John’s shoulder.
They had all been key witnesses, working with prosecutors in the months following the attempt on James’ life to expose the security breaches inherent in the program and show how it could be used toward nefarious means. There had been public outcry and demonstrations calling for the end of the program and the closure of all the agencies. The government had had enough on its plate dealing with the ramifications from Brexit and had quickly acquiesced and shut down the program.
The bartender seemed to like John’s giggle, too, because he looked up from shaking a cocktail tumbler and smiled.
Sherlock scooted his seat closer to John’s and leaned against his arm. “Where should we set up the tree? I think the sunroom would be best, but I wouldn’t be opposed to putting it on the wall between the bathroom and bedroom.”
John bows low, his bill almost touching the ice, his eyes closed. Tui cannot bow, so rather than risk embarrassing her, John meets her where she is. Beautiful John.
She smiled at him and shrugged. “All I can say is that the University of Chicago would be extremely fortunate to steal you away from Harvard. If your boyfriend is up to the rigors of our program, it might be possible. Each department head has a certain amount of leeway in how creative they can be when wooing talent, but it would depend on a lot of different factors. Like I said, keep my card.”
Sherlock taps John on the back, and when John looks at him, his face still pinched in a scowl, Sherlock shrugs his head in the direction of the dusk-smeared sunset, and smiles. John’s precious face softens a bit, and his eyes lose some of their murderous glare. He shuffles closer to Sherlock and aligns their wings. It’s the most minimal of contact, but it makes Sherlock feel as if he’s united with the entire universe.
“I now believe that James’ would-be killer infiltrated the AMP in order to get close to him. Think of all the information he’d have right at his fingertips; personal history, identifying details, maybe even the town he lives in and information about his household. And what if he created a profile that he thought would attract James and draw him out from under the heavy security he’s been under? He’d be able to get his own profile right into James’ hands.
“Tui, we feel terrible that we were the reason Anahera left and caused you so much distress,” Sherlock says.
“I think what you’re saying is, perhaps, we’ve put too much faith in the power of something that might not even exist, and that it’s time for us to take responsibility for ourselves, and make our own decisions, and live the right way regardless of an egg in the sky. We need to save ourselves.”
He’d tried to make it sound light-hearted, but he knew there was truth there, too, born of his almost desperate need to be with John as much as possible. They had less than forty-eight hours left before he’d have to head to the airport, and John would drive back to school.
In the end, Sherlock doesn't need John to stroke him. In the end, John's frantic thrusting is stimulation enough, and Sherlock's eyes widen in disbelief as he feels the unstoppable gather up inside him, no going back, no going back, and at the last shrinking second he arches off the bed, shifting himself on John's cock, and around him, over him, in him, he hears John shouting his own beatific release.
“I’ve known you since you were in nappies, John Watson, and you can be sure no member of the Watson clan is going to order off a menu! I’ll be back with something special for you in just a bit.”
“Yeah. I know.” Sherlock got up and crossed the room to where John was standing, half-dressed. “Keep the shirt. Wear it for the next week, then send it to me, unwashed.”
Sherlock strode into the kitchen and glared at the brand new plastic and glass coffee maker sitting on the counter. “It fell.”
He closes his eyes, parts his bill, only enough to breathe, and sucks in lungfuls of air. Behind him, John calls his name, his tone full of concern, questioning. Still, he doesn’t turn around. He lets John approach, waits until John is tugging on his wing, trying to spin him, but still, he does not turn.
He was so focused on where John’s hand was, stroking harder now, he hadn’t anticipated the first lick through the silk. He was up on his knees immediately, spread and keening.
“I know you do. That’s why we’ve watched it thirteen times in the last fifteen years. And that’s why we’re not watching it now.”
“Yeah, she knows. She doesn’t approve, though, so it’s no surprise she hasn’t mentioned it. It’s been a bit rough, to be honest.”
Sherlock lifted up again and leaned over John. He kissed him square on the mouth, smiling, happy to give John what he’d asked for.
“Nope. I know what’ll happen if we start kissing now. I’ll be undressed in about thirty seconds flat and we’ll be halfway to tonight. I want to wait.”
He filled them in on what he’d done that day, the three of them sitting around the table with their bowls of soup and warm bread slathered with butter. James and John asked questions and Sherlock gave him what information he had. James told Sherlock he’d contact his security detail first thing the following morning, but the conversation eventually turned to topics regarding the house and property. Whether it was James’ reticent nature or his discomfort at imposing that kept him from participating more fully in the conversation, Sherlock wasn’t sure, but he was appreciative that James didn’t act overly familiar with John.
Sherlock pressed the back of his head into John's stomach and mumbled, “There are two perfectly comfortable chairs over there if you don't find this acceptable. I prefer to lie down.” For half-a-second he thought John might toss him on the floor, but he didn't. Nothing happened. Sherlock was still on the sofa.
, you may think yourself clever, pushing your apologist agenda along under a different pretence, but I see right through you, and if you persist, I will report you to the Council.”
He observed two men sitting side-by-side at the end of the car. Both had baseball hats on, turned backward. Both were looking down at their phones. One was cradling a backpack in his lap and had his legs splayed wide in typical man-space posturing. The other was doing the same, as much as he could in the seat closest to the window. Their knees were touching. One of them bumped elbows with the other and showed him something on his phone. They both laughed and looked at each other, and then the look turned a bit soft and sweet. One licked his lips, and then the other jerked his head around and glanced around, as if checking to see if anyone had noticed them—what—looking at each other?
Sherlock and John left Annette to whatever it was she was working on that day, and headed up the path leading back to the house.
Sherlock nodded absentmindedly and frowned at his menu. Did John currently have someone to feed him up? He was ninety-eight percent positive that Molly wasn’t fulfilling that role, but his powers of observation were muddled by something he suspected were the stupid, pesky emotions flooding his system, the same emotions that made him break out in a cold sweat whenever he thought about John. Or looked at him. Or caught John looking at him.
John reached up and turned off the water, then let go of Sherlock long enough to grab two towels and yank them into the shower. He wrapped one around Sherlock’s shoulders, grabbing the ends and using them to draw Sherlock as close as he could, then wrapped the other one around his own back.
Mummy would never change her mind, and that meant Daddy would never be allowed to change his. At age twenty and three months, Sherlock had nine months to try to win Daddy over, but his efforts were half-hearted given the likelihood of success.
“I wonder if we could find a really inexpensive place in Uptown, or Rogers Park. We’d have to be near the El.”
Sherlock looks over John’s shoulder at the way the slowly greying sky is seeping down from up high, as if to touch the water, to rest on it for the night. Soon, he won’t be able to see where either one meets the horizon.
Sherlock began setting up his own blog by testing independent variables. In the first week he assigned different names to his blog to see if that would affect his follower count. He changed his name every day and tracked all changes in an Excel spreadsheet. With no posts, he surmised that the changes in follower count could only be dependent on the name he chose.
“What about ‘em, Ma?” John’s mouth was full of pot pie. He swallowed and chased it down with a gulp of milk.
“Well, I didn’t have much of a preference when I started looking,” John said, scrolling through his phone. “But then I ran into the same problem as the bars. We could eat something like twenty-five different cuisines within a square mile. Japanese, Korean, Italian, Greek, American, Mexican, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Ethiopian, Middle Eastern, German, Russian – and now I just feel kind of full and confused.”
He picked up the teapot and swirled it in slow circles, then poured himself a cup. He swirled the pot a bit more, then poured for John, who was devouring a piece of banana bread. John was quite sexy when he devoured things, if not a bit messy.
“Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Ms. Sarah Sawyer. She's just moved here, what, three months ago, from Davenport, to take Martha’s place at the elementary school.”
Sherlock feels his chest swelling and his heart squeezing and his belly fluttering. He did it. He gave John comfort, and he didn’t even know he was doing it.
“However,” Siger continues, raising his voice, “there were countless ways you could have fulfilled that fate. Had we not gone to Cassiopeia, had you and John not found the tooth, you would have taken a different journey.
“Oh.” Sherlock waved a hand in the air and turned onto his side to face John and reclaim his ass. “I remember my dad talking about the politics of snow once, so I looked it up and read about it.”
“So, Aunt Martha told me that you’re at Harvard, and Mycroft is still traveling the world on top secret government business. What are you up to, John?”
Sherlock drags his feet, plants his wings, and jumps to a stand. He calls. He calls louder and longer than any peng has ever called before, of this he is absolutely sure. He calls for John, over and over and over again, trumpeting the long stretch of beautiful sounds that make up John’s unique call. There is no other call for Sherlock to make in this moment, no other combination of notes. There never has been.
“Did you know that Australia has imported twenty-three species of dung beetles to help remove an overabundance of cattle dung?” Sherlock tucked his feet between John’s thighs.
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist and moved closer. His knees knocked into John’s. “Other oral things.”
His eyes sparking with excitement. "Come on, John! There's a terrible ice storm coming- let's hide out in this ramshackle shed and fuck to stave off hypothermia!"
“No. I’m mad at myself. I mean, I wasn’t anticipating that you’d be as upset as you were, but maybe I should have. Things have been going so well between us, and I think I forgot that you haven’t, I don’t know, you haven’t done all this before. Dealing with exes and feeling like you aren’t a priority and all that. First fights. God, this is such a mess. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I let you down.”
John turned and stretched his legs out on either side of where Sherlock kneeled. Sherlock rubbed John’s legs, massaged his inner thighs and quads.
Kudos to Happierstill for being such an enthusiastic beta, and to all of you for being supportive and lovely between and after each chapter posting. MWAH.
He still had misgivings about going to the hanky party at Sidetrack. Greg and Kevin had begged them to go, and John had talked about it all day as they’d loaded the rest of Greg’s belongings into their cars and then unloaded them at Kevin’s apartment. John had asked Greg to go over the colors again when they’d taken a break for lunch, and then had shot Sherlock silly looks over some of the more adventurous kinks.
Deer, red squirrels, osprey, raptors, and salmon were all in the area, John explained. They could even go salmon fishing if Sherlock wanted. Sherlock, who enjoyed eating what others put in front of him more than he enjoyed hunting for it, demurred and suggested they pick up some of the fish at the local grocer later that day.
Sherlock couldn't care less about the castle and wasn't entirely sure why he'd said anything about visiting.
He watches Anahera’s face for any sign, any tell whatsoever, that the seal is on them. Ahahera’s eyes are almost closed, with grief or effort or both, Sherlock does not know. She knows he’s watching her, though, and she shakes her head, back and forth, just once. For now, they are out of danger.
Sherlock pushes the plate away, and reaches for Imi's hand, which fits under his palm with room to spare. It's like holding a tiny bird, the way she wriggles her fingers around before putting her hand on top of his and tapping gently on his knuckles.
John put his own tea down and stood up, then came to sit next to Sherlock in his sheet with his fuzzy just-woken-up looks and his half-drunk cup of tea. He put his hand on Sherlock’s wrist where it rested on his thigh and smiled at him. “You’re quite talented, you know.”
“John Watson? That little blond kid who was surgically attached to your hip? Is this seriously him? John?”
There is no one at the High Council grounds when they arrive; Sherlock, Anahera and Tui stand to the side and make small talk while Mycroft glares at them. Sherlock understands. This is a stressful situation, with many unknowns. Mycroft lacks the ability to fret, so he glares. Every once in a while Sherlock gives him a little wave, and then Mycroft huffs, and then he glares some more.
Sherlock’s hips bucked up and his glutes contracted. Neck arched, words gone, he came, hard, all over his hand and stomach.
“I’ve never wanted any of this before. I’ve never wanted to be touched or kissed, and it’s certainly never had this kind of effect on me.” Sherlock took a deep breath and felt it low in his groin.
“I feel like I do. See, for you, arranged marriage dating is something that you have to do. You haven’t wanted to do it, and your parents have pressured you, and now the Crown is going to make you do it. You’ve done it with reluctance. I suspected that you were only dating me, and I’ve been truly honoured by that.
Sherlock couldn’t finish the thought. His mind was spinning with the possibilities. Image after image flitted through his head, thoughts of the first moment he would see John naked, of the first time John would touch his rigid cock and stroke him, thoughts of John’s strong hands on Sherlock’s arse cheeks, kneading and lifting and pulling. John licked around the curve of Sherlock’s ear and Sherlock’s brain fed him the sensation of that wicked, warm tongue on his cock, twirling over the head, licking at the leaking fluid, those lips spreading and slipping down, down, down.
Once outside, John led Sherlock to a quiet spot away from the front door and held him by the elbows. He looked at Sherlock for a moment, scanning his face for signs that might indicate what should happen next.
