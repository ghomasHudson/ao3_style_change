Sherlock nodded, “That sounds like a good idea.” He put his full weight onto John and ground down on his lap, Sherlock could feel John arousal, and it didn’t bother him, if anything it encouraged him a bit more. He continued grinding into john and started kissing him, starting off with little pecks on the lips, but starting to experiment with longer kisses where he stroked his tongue across John’s lips.
“Yeah I love London too, it’s a shame I can’t stay here anymore, there isn’t really way of staying here on an army pension,” said John choking back a sob, mentally kicking himself because he doesn’t know why he is sharing that with Sherlock.
“Okay into the tub, Boy,” Said John. He let out a groan as Sherlock rapidly pulled out of him and walked happily to the bathroom. John could feel Sherlock’s cum just leaking out of him. He sighed and walked to the bathroom, only to find Sherlock lying in the large tub. “Present!”
“Oh... well um yes Sherlock has the head and he got it legally,” Replied Mike.
Mycroft whispered "you didn't like that I told you no on reducing the surveillance, so you went to mummy. For that I might as well come up with new ways to keep track of you."
Violet laughed, "oh you'll see, we can call it an experiment."  Siger smiled and nodded, not being quite sure of what she was thinking of, the combo of "experiment" and laughter was a bit of a worrisome combo, especially when a Holmes was involved.
“Do you want a ride back?” Asked Mycroft.
"Well that's settled we can get off this fucking roof," said the first teen as he started packing up the scoring kit. His siblings approached Ella and Mycroft, and started to removed the wires of the kid while Mycroft and Ella removed the outfits and handed it back to the teens.
John laughed, "well Sherlock, probably not the best behavior to show, Rosie."
John laughed, “Sherlock everyone has those scratches on their phones these days, I highly suggest you delete that assumption.”
"You want comfortable or discreet?" Replied Crystal.
Mycroft nodded, "yes that will be fine."
"Nice use of I-statements, Sherlock. But other than past behavior is there anything John has done that makes you feel like him leaving you because of a lack of sexual intimacy," asked Ella.
John let out a small laugh at Sherlock’s appearance and delivered a light kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“John we live together, one could assume seeing each other later is an inevitability, the length of time between seeing each other is the only varying factor,” said Sherlock with a rather flat affect, but he did have a hint of a smile. “You better get going, can’t keep the huddled masses in search of PEP or Plan B waiting too long.”
“I am completely yours,” John smiled and pulled Sherlock in for another kiss. He reached out to hold his hand, they proceeded to walk back the 221b Baker St. John couldn’t actually believe this was happening, but it made him immensely happy how fast things changed, and to do it without the awkward conversation made it even better. He was also amused because they
After he put on the hood, he did immediately get a comfortable weight on his head that at least dampened the constant buzzing feeling in his head. Which was something he actually struggled to feel often and to have it dulled so easily was actually a bit amazing. When he started focusing on acting like a dog, he found himself able to actually clear his mind. It was all very unusual for him, and he actually liked it. He figured that this was something he could just do in the privacy of his room and no one would have to know. He especially didn’t want John to know, because despite moving back in with him with his daughter in tow, he still felt like he could still loose them despite John’s attempts to assure him otherwise. He didn’t want to make John feel uncomfortable in anyway and he wasn’t sure how John would react to the pup hood, so he kept it to himself. He was already on high alert for trying to make John feel absolutely comfortable because he felt bad for still indulging in some fairly graphic sexual fantasies about John, that he knew could never happen because John certainly exclaimed enough times that he wasn’t gay.
Chapter 11
John sighed, "I mean if you can find it in this store, yes, otherwise we will have to go to one of the outdoor markets."
"I got a job that gives me fulfillment. I have a ridiculous amount of power to the point that wars can start or end by my word and sometimes a single look. I have enough money that I don't have to worry about any thing. I think in terms of a life well lived, I think I am doing a damn good job," said Mycroft, his gaze softened, the corner of his mouth slightly quirk as if to aim for a slight smile, but it didn't quite his the rest of his face.
The pup rolled his eyes before diving in its meal, it did appreciate that his Master took the time to make sure the temperature was easy to eat. It finished its meal and looked up at its Master. It smiled as Master gave it head scritches.
A fireside chat that starts a plot...
"No such thing as a weird trigger in my opinion," replied John, he sincerely believed that.
“Oh fuck it, Mrs, Hudson, it’s just too much. I am bored and we both know we won’t keep this up, I might as well give him realistic expectations.” Exclaimed Sherlock.
Mycroft shrugged his shoulders and continued writing his three terms for the family contract.
“I think the rental place did an okay job for the suit samples,” snapped John.
“Hello John, nice to see you as always,” greeted Siger, offering a hand to shake to John which John returned.
"Because Hiram won't shut up about them," snapped Violet.
“You should've seen your face,” replied Sherlock.
John took a deep breath and sighed, "why would you ignore a teacher suspecting your kid is having seizures?"
Sherlock handed Rosie to John and smiled at the two of them, “you have to admit it wouldn’t be a bad idea, I mean we have been together longer than a lot of married couples, and we have a relationship that is built on a really solid and battle tested foundation. We are already raising a kid and we did just get a dog. And someone has to use the trust fund my parents set up for any potential grand kids. And it would make things a lot easier if one of us got injured and went to the hospit… I’ll just stop now.”
John swallowed, “About two weeks now, I mean we always danced around the subject, but even more so now.”
“Well, Mycroft, the answer is still no, I rather like your brother and he certainly likes me, and given how that waitress acted when she saw him eating and your presence, one can guess he is terrible at taking care of himself. I for one rather like taking care of people, so we might just balance each other out.” He tried to stand up even taller against Mycroft being so close to his personal bubble.
John woke up with Sherlock’s head still in his lap, the sun was now low in the sky, and his mind temporarily drifted to ideas for dinner. But of course, his cock decided to take the wheel. He was amused that Sherlock was just nuzzling his crotch like it was his favorite pillow. He was reminded of how they started all of this, a few months ago when he found Sherlock in a pup hood and John took the first steps toward breaking that barrier of firmly not touching each other. Yet, when that barrier was finally crossed, it was like a dam was burst and nothing was going to stop it. Sherlock was absolutely voracious when it came to his sexual appetite since him and John started all of this. He highly doubted many people went from virgins to being able to take a fist and a cock up the ass in just a matter of months. Sherlock told John that he was making up for lost time.
Sherlock took a deep breath, "I guess."
Sherlock groaned and clenched down on John’s cock, which caused John to groan. Sherlock was just delighted with everything so far, he really hoped against all hope that he wouldn’t ruin tonight because he wasn’t sure what this was, but it wasn’t boring and it didn’t have that slight twinge of guilt and shame all the other things that bring him joy tend to do.
Sherlock awkwardly nodded, “more than that actually.”
Joey laughed, “at least there is no church wedding component.”
Toby looks at Sherlock and senses something is off, Toby barks and paws at Sherlock. Toby tries licking Sherlock's hand, not much of a response. Toby goes off and finds John and barks at him and starts running in circles around John, herding him to Sherlock. John runs up to Sherlock with the other two dogs.
"Well William now goes by Sherlock, and is sharing a flat with another man and his daughter and Mycroft is still being a mysterious asshole, but now Wil-Sherlock's mom seems to talk about him with a bit of an edge. So I can only imagine the kind of drama going on there," said Blaze, his voice filled with excitement and a slight lisp. "But they didn't mention Eurus, but Sherlock's mom, did light up when she heard about your work."
Sherlock tossed Rosie’s phone over to John. They got her a cellphone because their lives were complicated and the schedule was constantly changing. The phone helped Rosie navigate all the changes in schedule and kept her up to date with her dads. “Look at her phone! The scratches!”
Sherlock spread his legs apart so that John can thrust against Sherlock creating maximum friction. Sherlock arched upward as he started to orgasm, he shot off a couple long strings of cum against John’s body some of it managed to even his John’s face. He moaned when John’s tongue darted out to taste Sherlock’s cum. Which only made sherlock more enthralled with John, he hooked his legs around John’s waist to hold him closer when he suddenly felt an intense pain. “Fuck!”
Molly watched him get out with a look of exasperation, “Sherlock! Remember to give back John’s phone! It is rude to keep people’s possessions without their permission!” She held out an envelope, “And you can't just read your own test, we are actually trained for that! You aren’t and you don’t even fill out your paper work for your cases, so what makes me think you are going to do the follow up paperwork for your labs. Also here sign this so you can get your money!”
Mycroft nodded at Ella's observations, "well I have indeed studied and mastered to a level of competency multiple forms of fencing, are you challenging me to a duel?"
The door opened, Violet and Siger walked in looking like they came in with a purpose. Violet stood next to his desk opened her bag and over turned it, an obscene amount of small cameras fell out of it. Mycroft made the mental note to fire whoever was supposed to be in charge of maintaining the surveillance of this parents because obviously they failed at discretion and doing anything about the cameras getting taken.
On the couch, Sherlock had a small smile.
"Okay who is Danny?" Said Mycroft.
“I am glad to hear that our cook didn’t cock it up this time. But next time I suggest you try the crepes, some of the combos, are an absolute stroke of genius. But be careful with any of the cream filled crepes, if you aren’t careful you can leave sticky white stuff everywhere and no one wants to clean that up when they least expect it,” said Molly leaning a little close to John and Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled off the bed dramatically and he got back up taking off clothes and heading to the shower.
Sherlock opened the door, and before crossing the threshold he kissed John one more time before he started tugging John through the door way, and slamming the door shut. He dragged John up the stairs, almost as if he was afraid that John was going to run off, but nothing was going to stop John from this moment. He shoved John down on the couch and immediately straddled, John’s lap, and proceeded to kiss him in a fairly intense, almost sloppy manner. Sherlock wasn’t exactly sure where to place his hands, he just wanted to jump into the deep end of this. He didn’t really care that he wasn’t exactly sure what he was doing and that he was probably a touch bit too old to be completely unsure of what he was doing. Yet he knew that he wanted to make it good for John.
Joey smiled, “yeah that surprised me too,” he suddenly frowned, “buuut I mean we cannot be too sure what he meant by blessing. For all you know this is just him trying to force a way to ensure that he had a chance to do a homophobic rant at the mic.”
Sherlock leaned into John’s touch, and accepted when John delivered a rather chaste kiss. He gasped when John roughly grabbed his hair. His cock dribbled even more.
Rosie smiles.
Sherlock quickly rolled over onto his chest and pushed himself up into a kneeling position, he ripped the hood off his head and grabbed John as he was trying to leave. “No John, please stay, I would more than welcome it,” Said Sherlock with a rather wide smile. He tentatively leaned into John’s personal space and held back mere centimeters from his face.
"It isn't that awkward after you set the boundaries," replied Blaze.
Mycroft laughed further, "I like to see you panic. Also I hate Musicals."
Sherlock nodded, he pulled out the keychain Solomon gave him. He started with Mrs. Hudson's door he clicked the the clicker, "Mrs. hudson's" he said.  He walked around the hallway and when they came across the basement he clicked the buzzer and said, "no" and as they rounded up to the stairs he started clicking the clicker until they got to the door. He said, "home," and opened the door. Toby came in and scanned the room around her. She stayed perfectly still. Sherlock started walking her around the living room and the kitchen. He clicked at the food fridge and buzzed at the experiment fridge.
"Violet, dear, do you ever wish you could just brag about the kids to your colleagues?" Said Siger.
He added yet another finger, and started thrusting even harder.
“You’re bored aren’t you, your brother said that’s one of your triggers,” Wiggins said as he started searching his pockets. “Here’s the ticket to get in, you need it more than me. But heads up, if you use cocaine and get caught and I loose my spot in the Norvir study.”
One of my things when I was an altar server, was working funerals where the deceased were outed as queer. But I remember one time this stuffy bureaucrat tackled the Partner of the deceased because the bureaucrat thought it disrespectful to the man’s position at work for him to be outed. Especially when the cause of death was an opportunistic infection typical of HIV/AIDS. I’m glad this isn’t as much of an issue these days.
“Yes, anything, I want it all,” Said John rather enthusiastically.
"You really need to give that woman a raise, I mean look at what she does to survive in this city," said Blaze with a tone that was a cross between indignation and judging, but not really because he wasn't about to judge someone over being a pro-Domme.
John smiled, “of course, I mean you feed her, you change her, you pick her up from day care, you are who she runs to when she sad, you are her parent. You’re stuck with us.”
For weeks, William used the name and loved how it fit, eventually he used it every where. Even the folks at school knew to call him “William” but his peers refused to accept the new name and when his dads talked to the school, the school said, that it wasn’t their responsibility to make sure other kids treated his son nicely. So Papa exposed all the secrets of the school administration, and quickly got him enrolled in a new school, one that William loved so much more than his old school.
Mycroft sat at his desk, and looked at this appointment book, he wasn't looking forward to his next appointment, it was his parents. He wasn't sure what they wanted because they rarely talk to him since they found out his sister Eurus was still alive. He understood why they were upset but he was only doing what he thought was best, he was sure some day they would understand.  He got up from his desk fixed himself a tea, momentarily thinking of just pouring himself a scotch, but choosing against it. It would probably be the best to be sober for this conversation, he could always drink later.  Instead he dumped an obscene amount of sugar into his tea.
Violet chuckled, "well the last time I talked to Hiram, he moved to CalTech to work the JPL, his wife is now at Oxford teaching Literature, most of the kids are together running some genetic tech company in San Francisco. One of the kids from the younger set of twins is an associate psychology professor who specializes in trauma and CPTSD at UCSF, Hiram thinks it is hilarious but Moira is offended by it, she thinks that all her daughter's work is just an academically sponsored hate campaign against her. She also apparently is head of her own program to help people who have been conserved get back to living outside of hospital settings. The youngest is currently in med school to be a plastic surgeon and urologist, so she's in San Francisco with her siblings because the doctor she wants to work under is there and apparently it has a high concentration of the kind of clients she wants. Hiram said the youngest son jokes that one of these days he is going to randomly hire Sherlock for a job just to get in slapping distance. I am not sure if it is about Cluedo or the fact that they were roommates for their first year at Cambridge. Hiram also says that ever since that meeting, his kids got along so much better. Apparently the Aithne kept asking Hiram to ask us to set up play dates for quite some time.."
Irene laughed openly, “you know what, I might just give you one on the house just let me find Kate, to see if she is okay with it.” She pushes back Sherlock, her coat rubbed against Sherlock in a way that felt wrong, he started downing his drinks in hopes of getting to that point of intoxication where that sensation would be okay. He finished both drinks rather quickly to the dismay of Janine.
“To be honest I don’t know you seem to have been a priority to me since we met, I don’t know when the feelings turned this way, part of me started to identify those feelings around the whole Irene incident... unfortunately I didn’t know exactly what I wanted until you were gone, and by the time you came back I was so set on moving on, I didn’t think about what I actually wanted.” John smiled and gently touched Sherlock’s face, “but you are it for me, we been through so much and you are still here. And you just take everything that comes our way, and you have been absolutely wonderful with Rosie, I don’t think I would be able to do this without you.” He pulled Sherlock down for a kiss.
"But for real though, as absurd as it is that you want to visit Eurus, I get it, you didn't really like anyone when you were a kid, and I really don't think you'll be able to put up boundaries with her that would be conducive to her getting out of a program and living a life amongst society. But you feel obligated to at least visit her, will you have company because I can always tag along. I mean I do have to check on our investments in the U.K., so it really wouldn't be hard for me to tag along," said blaze with a smile on his face, that really didn't quite reach his eyes.
"Is Eurus still alive?" Asked Crystal.
Sherlock groaned, "okay I see your point, but is there anyway I can at least get to the point that I can try to approach sharing that kind of contact with John, because I really, really want to."
Sherlock swiped his card and punched in a number and smiled.
Still William was not happy with the situation involving his documents, but his dads were on the case. William overheard Papa arguing with Uncle Mycroft at Christmas Dinner, “It’s just data on some form, Mycroft, you are the British Government, you can change one little name and a gender marker and no one will blink an eye. You can do it from your laptop.”
Sherlock nodded, "I agree with John, but I think he should get a chance to still add input."
"Sherlock, you needed to do the training with Toby and we don't want to waste Kayla's time," replied John.
Aithne stared at her patient board in the meeting room of Maureen Russo house. It had three spots open,  she looked at the waiting list. She looked at all the files of those on the list and all of them were very much deserving of getting out of the institutions, and all of them had heart breaking stories of the trauma that got them there. She also looked at the file of Eurus Holmes which just came to her private fax machine. She enjoyed a challenge but she knew from just looking at her file that she could easily break the balance of the house. Russo had 15 beds, there was 12 people here currently and she wasn't sure if she should take on Eurus even though she was quite fond of her. No one really got Aithne like Eurus did, sure with time her twin Blaze, understood what made Aithne tick and they even came to enjoy each other’s company, but Eurus got Aithne right away. It wasn't in the same way Eurus read the other less significant people. "No wait, people aren't insignificant, cannot think like that anymore. I can't slip up now." She loudly thought to herself. No, Aithne thought Eurus saw her as someone who could almost understand her in way not even her brothers could dream of. Twelve people’s chances at reclaiming their lives depended on this program, and the mere presence of Eurus could toss that progress out.
John paused his door was already open, he knew he locked it in his rush to get out with Sherlock because he didn’t want the front desk person to pack his stuff for him should the management decide to kick him out. He knew the laws changed and it was no longer that DADT bullshit, but he knew there was a good chance they would pull some other reasoning to kick him out.
“Fine, but I’m still going to make sure he doesn’t just leave with jumpers and jeans,” replied Sherlock as he closed his eyes and went back to sleep wrapped around John.
Sherlock turned to John and nodded vigorously as he returned to scrubbing the floor just as vigorously.
Ella stared at the two men in front of her, "I think you both have made a lot of strides in your treatment and I commend you both on deciding to start this journey together in a way that gives you both a space to maintain this relationship in a healthy manner while protecting the strides you made in treatment. Yes things have not been easy for the two of you on the journey of your relationship but at the same time you both feel that you make the other a better person. And I understand that both of you are comfortable having what you have mentioned in past individual sessions mentioned in joint sessions, so I think we can proceed. I am curious how did this new element of your relationship start."
"Yeah, um... that is a bit funny, but yeah I can help," said John, he took the bag from Paul and looked around the park and spotted a group of young men playing football while some of their friends sat to the side drinking some beers. John sighed and walked over to them, "hey so my friend over there trying to stay sober but he had a bit of a rough start today and bought some booze but he changed his mind of breaking sobriety, basically do you want these, because well he doesn't want them but would also feel shit for tossing it down the drain." He held up some of the bottles while at the same time keeping an eye open for police because public drinking could always be a bit troublesome depending on the responding officer.
John smiled, "thanks for being considerate." Sherlock smiled and offered his hand to John, and with that John and Sherlock walked away holding hands.
Sherlock nodded, “follow me,” Sherlock started weaving through the crowd with a little too much ease.
Sherlock was surprised by the sudden jab to the face and slightly dazed, he awkwardly slumped to the ground. He was dizzy but he was still able to move. He saw John throwing a few punches at the intruder until the person passed out.
Mycroft laughed, “so what would it take for you both to just leave me?”
“I don’t have friends,” snapped Sherlock.
Violet opened the door, "so you think we are tedious?"
Sebastian looked at Sherlock slightly shocked, "I don't know what you mean?"
"Oh yes well I didn't like Astana either but I didn't set her on fire. That was a bit extreme," blaze laughed.
"John is a rather nice man for Sherlock, and I still can't put my finger on what is going on between them, because at this point they are raising that child together. And as much as I say I don't want to pressure any of them into giving us grandkids, I honestly feel like Sherlock might be our only chance. After all it is a different time, if they are together they might as well just make it all fine and legal, it would be nice to provide for Rosie," grinned Violet.
“Why would he put up a fight? I mean I enjoy a bit of rough treatment but if he genuinely wanted to fight me, I’d just have to walk away.” Replied Sherlock. “And how is a car relevant in this situation.” He did look a bit confused when, “I don’t know he was different, He wasn’t dull, and he is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion, I had quite the series of orgasms. Never had the urge to see people I have liaisons with again, but we ate breakfast and he is coming over to look at the flat. I mean I am assuming this is what people mean when they like a person and enjoy their company who knows maybe something interesting will come of this.”
Aithne smiled, "discreet."
Sherlock smirked, "I can surprise you sometimes." He disposed of the bag and did a quick run up to 221b to wash his hands with Toby following him up. He promptly returned to John, Rosie, and Kayla on the curb.
Aithne looked offended at them.
Ella laughed, "you can keep telling yourself that if it it helps."
William looked at Papa, but started looking at his hands he tapped his fingers a few times before he softly said, “it was a gift for a specific person.”
John stared at Sherlock, slightly shocked but incredibly amused. He broke out into even more laughter. “How about we start with a round two and see where it goes?”
John frowned, “I take it people were always rude to you because of the whole deduction thing, and you probably don’t have any idea about how to be polite, because it has all been deleted.”
“So I had to intervene, and well given that I have a bit of a record, she tried to capitalize on that, so she tried running to a cop doing beat patrol in hopes of him believing her. So I had to back off and she bolted for the church,” said Aithne, she said that as she chewed at the inside of her cheek, a habit she knew she had to break because she never knew when she pushed it too far.
Sherlock burst back into 221b and started scrubbing away at the floor.
Sherlock nodded, "you don't have to if you don't want to, you were pretty adamant against the other options. I am here and I am as okay as I can be with the circumstances."
“I take it, that you are bringing Crystal, since they are pretty much in every decision you make about the program. They are likable but again are you sure they are the best person for this job?” Said Athina.
John stopped in his tracks as Sherlock blocked his way, “trust me it is better off if I just leave right now.” He tried to sidestep Sherlock.
John frowned, "Sherlock, I am never going to be bored with you, when you were gone, I wasn't really living. I was lost without you and the life we had together, I was almost back to how I was before I met you. I am pretty sure your brother snuck in and stole my gun at some point because it was only after you returned that I was able to find it again."
Mycroft shot a look at John and Sherlock, "simple, Sherlock doesn't know when he needs help. I found him in enough crack houses and dark alleys to know he is never good at knowing he is in trouble."
But as she just kept finding new ways to do things to keep up her end of the bargain made at the Farm, Eurus promised to get her out, but she had to come back for her. One could easily assume that Eurus was one of the kids who died in the fire, but deep down Aithne thought that Eurus was too smart for that. But she thought 25 years in a secret compound that wasn’t supposed to exist might mean that the Eurus she knew was not the Eurus on that island. Would Eurus even remember her. Did Mycroft remember her? Was that why she was contacted? She smirked, she knew that her house was one of the best programs out there even if it was a bit flying by the seat of their pants at times. She rather liked all of her clients and she did root for them she wanted them to live their best life. Eurus on the other hand always thought it funny to make the other kids at the Farm do what she wanted, and sure it was funny but Aithne always thought such a power can be used for such terrible things, especially when you throw in the inevitable problems that comes with being isolated for so long. She read more of Eurus's file and she saw what Eurus made so many people do to themselves. She smirked, Eurus got really good at her little trick. Maybe if she could use it for good, there would be some real amazing stuff right there. She laughed, oh the terrible mind feedback loops she could break.
John smiled because Sherlock’s ass marked so easily and he imagined what he could do to that skin when they build up to other implements for impact play. He thought about how pretty Sherlock’s skin would take to a cane or a crop, and oh how he is going to have to try that one sooner than later. “Stop wiggling, Boy,” Said John as he dug his finger into a spot that anlot of the over slaps over lapped and was already form a small bruise.
So William tried another name, he always liked it when he heard Papa say things like “John, my conductor of light!” to his dad. So he thought it fun to have a play on that, so he tried Samson, because it meant “Sun Child”. A few days later his computer caused him a bit of trouble, that no one in the house could figure out, so they went to the Apple Store to get it checked out at the genius bar. The Apple Genius called out “Samson” and once again William felt good about the name. The genius struggled to solve the problem, and ultimately it was an issue that they couldn’t solve in one day so they sent it out for repair.
“Oh you are the very best boy, always wanting to please your Daddy. I love you darling.” John smiled as Sherlock arched his back and came as cum struck the wall of the shower. John felt his piss being sprayed back at him and found that to be a rather satisfying feeling.
The Holmes Parents smiled as they saw their son off to take care of his boyfriend’s daughter.
"I'd say with me, but I highly doubt John would allow it and we have an agreement that we are to make decisions of that magnitude together," said Sherlock.
it might actually still be in the yellow for me,” Said Sherlock with a slight shrug. “I know I liked playing with your ass, but I am still not sure how I feel about putting my cock into you.”
“Yeah, I may not have dated him, but we both know he tried to ‘accidentally’ confuse me for you back then. We were still using the red:blue system back then too, so the ass should've known,” said Francis while glaring at his brother.
Paul laughed, "we are most certainly avoiding alcohol, but there is a fancy coffee shop around the corner that gives people trying to stay sober free coffee, so let's get some free 7£ coffee. Yeah I've had the urge to drink all day, let's put it this way, I've have been wandering this park long enough to be stopped by multiple guys thinking I am cruising."
“Okay the numbers talking to you is helpful at work but is helpful outside of work?” Asked Aithne as she inched closer to her brother.
Toby started barking and pawing at Sherlock.
He wanted a fix but his brother was using his new found power to just about stop all of his sources. He couldn’t even make his own stuff because the last time he tried to cook up some meth, his brother took all his lab equipment. He didn’t even like meth he was going to barter if off for some cocaine, if he had any luck, and he usually did because all the dealers knew his stuff was high quality.
Mike smiled, “not a problem, it’s always good to help a friend out. Also seriously consider changing your specialty to Infectious Disease, should you not be able to get back into trauma surgery.”
Violet looked at her son again, no longer concerned, but with an edge of anger. "Okay Mycroft what about when the hyper surveillance and extreme hovering is aimed at one person?"
Ella got up and came by the screen, she could see that John had his eyes closed and he was taking deep breaths. She whispered "John are you okay?"
“Mmmm... but is the mystery the only thing,” Said Jeanine as she dries off a couple of glasses with a bar cloth.
"What?" Said Sherlock.
Yeah no porn here, this is just me getting attacked by plot bunnies of the morning after the rave.
John reached out for Sherlock's hand, which was balled up in a fist, john's hand hovered for a second as is silently asking permission. Sherlock opened his hand and took hold of john's, their fingers interlocked. Sherlock's frown broke out to a small smile, he started sit a bit more taller in his chair, as if holding John's hand made him a bit more confident. He pulled their hands closer to himself, John being a much shorter man henceforth shorter arms had to shift over closer to Sherlock's side to the point that john ended up sitting shoulder to shoulder with Sherlock.
John turned to Sherlock, “I glad you thought so.” He delivered a soft kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
I don't know back when I taught nine year olds, some of them were already talking of dating each other. The amount of times I had to deal with small children kissing is more than I care to remember... like those were 11 and 12 year olds. The 9 year olds were firmly just in the hand holding and spending all their time together realm. I mean I was already getting an inkling of my queerness at 9, so yeah that was a thing.
“Oh it is very good Daddy, but I had a very hard, hard, hard night and I know I misbehaved but you know you love giving your bestest boy a treat,” asked Sherlock as he bounced on his Daddy’s fingers and tongue.
One of the other teens added, “I’m sure it is a big deal if you wanted to duel in the middle of the fucking night, but going to church on sundays is the only thing that stops our grandparents from driving our parents up the wall and when they go up the wall, they take us all with them and I for one would like a good summer for once.”
John watched the young man walk away, thinking, “well that was interesting. Hmm 221 B Baker St.” He shrugged his shoulders and thought what’s the worst that can happen, decision made, he was going to see Sherlock again, and it will be to look at an apartment together. This could be the start of something interesting.
John shrugged his shoulders, " I don't know Sherlock if you can keep human body parts in a fridge next to food we ate before Rosie came along, I am sure you can let Rosie sit in a shopping cart."
"We would be paying full price, but there are quite a few private trusts invested in the program, so they said that no matter what cuts happen, they would be able to keep it funded," said Violet.
"I mean mother does allow him to play with men," said Blaze, "she probably allows it so that she can feel some kinship with her favorite authors."
Sherlock groaned, “Captain i’ll need your help.” Sherlock leaned in closer to John and wrapped his arms around John and held him closer.
“Girl, bye,” replied Blaze as he continued down the hall to the foyer of the house blowing yet another raspberry.
John grinned and said, "Rosie is a very curious and, at times, mischievous child, like all 2 year olds. She was snooping around our stuff, and found Sherlock's letter box, and she happened to leave a bunch of them out.  And after reading the words he wrote I knew I had to tell him that I felt the same way, and this past week has been great, I almost wish I said something sooner."
"So are you and Danny the only people I keep misnaming?" Asked Mycroft bracing for an answer.
John slowed down Sherlock’s descent to the floor. He left Sherlock on the ground as he walked his bags in and closed the door behind him. He started to rummage around his bag and pulled something out.
John flipped Sherlock over and kissed him softly, he placed his full body weight onto Sherlock and that smeared the mess all over the two of them, as they started to kiss a little harder. John nipped at Sherlock’s lips before he licked his way into Sherlock’s mouth, their tongues just lazily meeting each other. John felt like Sherlock was reading him because Sherlock was doing everything just right, and he thought that just made sense. After all if Sherlock could figure out John’s life story just by looking at him, he could probably figure out what John liked physically. Eventually his shoulder started to bother him so he just rolled off Sherlock and they both found themselves panting for air.
Sherlock tossed the last of the trash into a bag, and
“Hello I am Sherlock Holmes and I need to settle a bet, if you answer my question I pay for your meal,” announced Sherlock. “I’m going to ask to see the charging port of your phone and ask about your alcohol use. If anyone is wishes to opt out you are free to do so.” He was pleased to see that everyone was willing to participate.
"That was a bit good," said Sherlock. "I also feel like I need a shower."
John started to deliver slow, long strokes occasionally changing angles until Sherlock arched his back and gasped rather loudly. Finding the right spot he started to thrust into Sherlock a little bit faster, he smirked as Sherlock gasped. He pulled out completely and added more oil, he pushed the solid oil into Sherlock and was a little fascinated with watching it liquify, but when he was satisfied with the amount of lubrication, he once again lined his cock against Sherlock’s hole and immediately started pushing in. As he is thrusting he decides he wants to get closer to Sherlock, so he grabs Sherlock’s ankles and hitched them over his shoulders essentially folding Sherlock over, he shifted his hands to grip onto Sherlock’s hips. It once again changed the angle which left Sherlock absolutely breathless but throwing his head back in pleasure, John delivered some playful nips to Sherlock’s exposed neck.
Sherlock had a blank look on his face like he was worried,nervously gnawing at the side of his mouth. He was staring into space, occasionally his fingers twitch.
Sherlock kneeled in the middle of the bedroom still contemplating what was happening, he just knew he liked it though. He peeked up when he heard foot steps coming down the hall. His jaw dropped when he saw John entering the room in his fatigues. He thought he couldn’t get any harder, but he did, his cock now slapping against his stomach. He squirmed a bit more.
Sherlock nodded, he looked around to see if anyone noticed the cake, he picked it up made a motion to swap it with a similar cake but wasn't dropped, but Rosie started to openly reach for the broken cake. Sherlock tried to subtlety hide the broken cake.
John was looking at Sherlock with a bit of concern, which was quickly turning to a look of relief. He started laughing, “I thought I broke you for a second there.” He started easing himself out of Sherlock but Sherlock had him still firmly locked in place with his legs. “Come on Sherlock we are going to have to clean up eventually. Also, I know the horse is already out of the gate, but my last STI test was with my annual check up last month and it was free of any diseases, and I know your health record, and your last test was clear. But we can always get tested together again if you want.” John leaned fully on Sherlock, who finally relinquished his grip on John.
"I just want to make sure my brother is going to be okay with this new development in his life, he doesn't need more suffering. He really deserves someone who loves him for him and not some idealized version of him and doesn't make him flinch at sudden movements," said Mycroft. "I just want to see what Dr. Thompson is thinking with all of this and what did she see when she decided to help them navigating being together. I am not going to get it out of them, that's for sure."
"Is this your 'you break his heart, I break your heart speech,' because I think you made that clear when we first met," replied John. "Also I learned from this experience and I do my best to avoid what sets me off, and that is why I am just going to try and walk away now, before things escalate. I also don't think Sherlock likes being left alone with your parents. You don't have to trust me, but you are going to have to trust Sherlock, we all are."
"Well we don't have much space for a spectacularly large dog, but otherwise we want a dog that can take public transit and taxis fine, but not too small." Said Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at John with a slight smirk, “don’t say that, I got a spare room, I find you interesting, and you are incredibly hot.”
John smiled at the fact that Sherlock lit up at the idea. Okay I am counting about 10 little messes so your count is already at 10 and it is only going to get higher from there.”
"Will do, Mrs. Holmes, see you later. Tell Mycroft we hope he still comes by, because some conversations are better had in person," responded John and the line disconnected.
Josephine and Joey nodded in agreement seriously wondering where the story was going.
"Yup, that would be good," said John. Sherlock nodded in agreement.
Sherlock nodded as the cum in his mouth mixed with his saliva and every time he took a breath through his mouth it made an amusing amount of bubbles. He hated it, and he knew John knew he hated it. Because as much as he loved being covered and marked by John Watson, he very much preferred to swallow right away instead of just letting it linger on his tongue. Still he knelt obediently as John went on with making supper.
Mike shrugged, “preferably not, but if you aren't going to be romantic with them, we don’t care.
“I don’t know who they would send but DI Gregory Lestrade offered to be here right away if no one from special victims is available right away,” said Molly.
“Yes I think we can be assured that bottoming is now firmly in the green column now,” Replied John, “how was topping for you?”
“I see what you’re doing, and yeah he did only mention cocaine, no I didn’t point out to him that there was plenty other options for you,” replied Wiggins with a chuckle. “Try not to fuck this up for me.”
Sherlock frowned, "that is far away, and The States seems to be in dire straits at the moment, does the facility even have the funding to operate because we all know mental health services tends to be cut first no matter the country."
“No,” Said John standing up ramrod straight he dug into his military train to give his posture an air of meaning business.
He already observed John enough that he was pretty sure he could deduce what John likes. He was already enjoying this kissing business.
The fruits listed are considered aphrodisiac in case you didn’t know.
John and Sherlock watched as Sherlock's parents got in a cab and drove away.
“Darling,” Said Irene as she delivered a sharp jab at Sherlock, who whirled around to face Irene. She held up a brown bottle, “it’s on the house. Do you know what to do with this thing?”
"Thanks," said John, offering his hand for a handshake.
John pulled back and grabbed Sherlock roughly by the shoulders. “When I say all fours I mean it. Center of the bed now and stay on all fours or else this stops. Do you understand?” He waited for Sherlock to comply, and when Sherlock was in position, he grabbed a condom, some lube, and got up on the bed, which was a bit too plus to be standing on, but it would certainly make for good sleep, just a little soft for rough sex. He couldn’t wait any longer. he stroked himself to full hardness and rolled on the condom himself, drizzled some lube on his cock and slathered the excess lube between Sherlock’s ass cheeks and with a great grunt he roughly shoved his cock into Sherlock’s warm hole. He didn’t take his time like he did the night before, he could tell that Sherlock liked it rough and he was willing to give it to him that way as long as no lasting damage was going to happen. John kept still to allow Sherlock some time to adjust.
John shrugged, "i guess one that can thrive with at least two walks a day and occasionally been out the whole day. Probably one that likes to play especially because we have Rosie."
John blushed slightly, and deciding to seize the moment also leaned up and kissed Sherlock, initially aiming for his cheek, but in that moment Sherlock was turning his head to talk to John. And John caught Sherlock’s mouth instead. He made a move to pull away but Sherlock started return the kiss, and went so far as to pull John even closer to his body. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and deepened the kiss.
"Oh don't you worry a some of it went to petrol and traffic tickets for the Ashton Martin too," said Mrs. Hudson with a smile.
John got up and gently parted Sherlock’s ass cheeks. He was relieved to see that despite a bit of swelling, there wasn’t any tears, but the look of his cum just spilling out of Sherlock was fucking fascinating. He felt the need to take it in in all possible ways. He ran a finger along the riim of Sherlock’s hole which was
Ella nodded, "okay I am going to have to admit that is beyond the scope of my expertise, but is there any form of touch you enjoy with John?"
Molly Hooper, one of the folks who worked at the forensic lab of St. Bart’s, stepped up to the testing RV. She called out, “hey Mike, if you are already friends with a person can you still take their test?”
"You are enough, and despite all we have gone through together, we are still here and doing our best," Sherlock pulled John back to the bed and curled up around him. "And hey if you are really so worried about messing up Rosie we can do our very best to make sure she is a socially competent child by 8 years old and put her in a boarding school, I mean I can really hype her up with some selective use of reading materials so that she romances the idea of going away, therefore cutting down on any possible chances of homesickness or feeling abandoned. That way we can be really fantastic parents on the weekends and holidays because she can't possible be around us long enough for us to mess her up that way." He was cracking up by the time he finished that sentence.
“I have my ways,” Said Mycroft.
“Arrest! That was double touch!” announced Andrea.
“Yeah Mycroft, the oldest, called me for a case, after I fill up the current openings I going to head over to meet with the potential client,” said Aithne with a slight shrug as if trying to show indifference but the barely concealed smile was betraying her.
Kayla came back with a box, "okay Sherlock, we got Toby's bed, her toys, and a bag of dog food. She already has her vest, collar, and lead. So if anything you are all set." She handed the box to John, and pulled out a business card and handed it to Sherlock. "Here's my card, so you can contact me directly for scheduling training sessions. I prefer text message."
"I think I am going to get the kettle started," exclaimed Sherlock.
“Okay Billy, time to tell the Ice Man what his dear brother is up to,” snapped Mycroft, as he pulled off the sack. Mycroft really wasn’t happy to see that Wiggins made a bit of a mess of the sack and his car trunk, he didn’t want to think about how he was going to have to explain that to the folks who clean his car. Mycroft realized he was going to have to improve on his delivery of folks in future instances.
John really should’ve known better than to leave Sherlock alone with something as intense as sounding. He also knew that Sherlock would just be insufferable if he was to let Sherlock go unpunished for busting a load all over supper. So he had to give Sherlock some sort of light punishment that fit the crime. “You know boy, I am not even going to call you boy, that was disgusting, not even human. So stay put, pet.”
John stood in the tub watching Sherlock walk away. “I hope I am not going to regret saying that.”
“Hmm... what was that Sherlock?” Said John trying to pretend he wasn’t listening but the idea of Sherlock being a power bottom using him like he was nothing but a living dildo was playing out in his head. He unfortunately started to feel a slight hard on developing just from the thought of Sherlock being a powerbottom. He moved the newspaper lower so that he could hide his rapidly developing hard on because his cock was a bit hard to miss.
Mycroft sighed, "okay, just tell me when you are able to come for the evaluation, and we arrange the proper arrangements."
John laughed, “Violet, Siger, that is a very generous offer, but I am not sure I am ready to take you up on the offer. I mean not now you know, maybe after me and Sherlock settle more into the idea of being an us, you know.”
There is a small amount exchange of homophobia, but don't worry nothing too bad happens. Just skip the parts between the line doing this thing *~*~*~*~*~*. Also body dysphoria happens a bit too, but skipping it will mean skipping some important bits.
Sherlock smiled, "yes Rosie, let's get a cake."
John sighed as Sherlock and him pushed through the crowds of parade attendees as they tried to make their way to Baker Street. They were exhausted after solving a string of robberies that at first looked like opportunistic crimes at gay bars against mobile clinics but turned out to be one academic team making a power grab for funding for mobile services.
“Good because we both know at this point I’m always going to take whatever you can give me,” Said Sherlock. He got on John’s lap and pressed a fairly chaste kiss against John’s mouth. He pulled back to look at John and smiled at John’s breathless expression.
“The one with the tea!”
John on the other hand was delighted at the turn of events. He wasn’t exactly sure what to make of the fact that Sherlock was willing to try all the kinks under the sun as long as John was interested in trying, but some of them did make him feel a little weird. While he had no problem with Sherlock probing his ass with his fingers and cock, Sherlock’s tongue and mouth was a whole other issue, and at this very moment he was moaning into the pillow as Sherlock was delivering gentle kisses all along his spine, John was anticipating what was going to happen next, but was surprised at the rather sharp bite he received. He let out a small gasp and found himself rutting on to the bed spread. He felt Sherlock grab his asscheeks and spread them. He bucked when Sherlock’s tongue breached his hole. He could feel Sherlock practically smiling against him.
Sherlock let out a soft moan as John proceeded to kiss him, he tentatively placed his hands on John’s chest and gently stroked lines down his chest. He let out a rather sad sound when John gently pushed him away.
John looked at his Pet, “no you spoiled the human dinner so you have to eat up your mess, you whine again and I am adding even more food.”
Mycroft made a face as he snuck up behind Sherlock’s associate and draped the hood over him to drag him into his car. He hated having to do the leg work for things like this but given how new he was in his career he didn’t want to owe anyone favors. He hoped against all hope that this time the man had some incontinence pants on this time.
He just wasn't sure if he was ready to go back up there. He knew that Mycroft had every right to be wary of him, but he felt like at this point it shouldn't be an issue because he was mindful of his actions and he now knew to get himself out of situations that set him off. There was risks, and more than one person has given them warnings about continuing on as friends at first, but they really thought they were to better together. At least he thought they were better together than apart, he couldn't speak on Sherlock's behalf. He regret what happened that day in the morgue with the Smith incident, and he regret the amount of times he hit Sherlock on the day of his return. He at the time thought it was justified and he knew Sherlock thought that as well, but they knew better. He was worried that he would slip up, and it made him scared because messing up now meant messing up so much more.
“You know what dad, it was a pretty great birthday. And don’t worry papa I am pretty sure it was obvious that my friends absolutely ate it up.” he hugged his dads and went up to his room.
“Okay which column does this experience go into?” Asked John.
“That sounds good, but I definitely want to tag along, we cannot have Ro looking like he tumbled out of a fashion magazine,” laughed John. “Go back to bed, we have a long day tomorrow.”
Sherlock bolted out of the car, but John was still unbuckling himself.
“Well biting someone during a time of a pandemic, especially for a disease that was transmitted through spit is especially frowned upon. He bit some posh mum who tried to start a conversation with me, that women was obnoxious and I guess she thought given my coat, my being a bit overwhelmed by the situation at the time, and Ro’s Patagonia jacket, made her think that I was a posh parent like her forced to do the groceries for the first time in forever. Well she had three very loud boys in tow with her,” said Sherlock as he leaned back onto his pillow, and stretching out a little bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’d rather be shot at than deal with a lot of the emotional stuff I have to process,” said John as he let out a yawn while closing his eyes.
John nodded and looked at Sherlock, and gently squeezed his hand as if to say that he to reassure Sherlock that what she is saying was true.
Sherlock nodded and sat back up on the couch, John sighed already missing Sherlock presence. “John, I’m okay if you feel the need to get your fulfillment elsewhere, and I am working on it, I want to share that part with you eventually.”
John and Sherlock shared a knowing look at each other.
John firmly grasped Sherlock by the back of his neck and forced him to look down at the site where he got “stabbed”. He got relieved when Sherlock’s breath evened out.
“Dad! I give up I can’t fix it! I tried every method I could think of but it’s welded shut and any screw I can think of moving might make it worse!” Said William holding back tears, but a single tear still managed to escape. He climbed onto his dad’s lap and shoved his face into his dad’s sweater and released even more tears.
Sherlock sniffed at himself, “you know what you are right, I’ll do just that.”
“He went to a warehouse rave in East London, after that, I don’t know what else,” snapped Billy as he awkwardly stumbled out of the car trunk. “I mean do you have a picture of the guy, I mean I wasn't there but I mean I know people, maybe I can identify the man, who managed to get Wi... Sherlock to stay more than just the time it takes for him to cum.”
After John was done cleaning, he checked on Sherlock who was still sleeping rather peacefully. He went to the kitchen to make Sherlock a snack for recovery. He sliced up some watermelon, strawberries, pineapples, and pomegranate. After the kind of play they just had, Sherlock was going to need all the fiber he could get. He also knew that all those fruits had the potential to be aphrodisiacs. He found that amusing. He grabbed a couple bottles of water, and entered the room. He smiled to find that Sherlock was still sleeping but rutting against the sheets. He released the ties pinning him down because he knew that Sherlock could risk hurting himself when he was having his dreams. John joined him in the bed and closed his eyes for a nap of his own.
Aithne shook her head, "trust me limiting her hours with the other clients would help all of us. I mean I doubt things will go that way, I always burn people out, Eurus is someone I don't want to burn out, I would be extremely mindful."
Aithne took a deep breath, and picked up her private phone and dialed a number. “Hello Mycroft.”
“I really want to taste you, I want to feel you coming down my throat,” Said Sherlock burying his face into John’s clothed chest, the dog tags making a noticeable noise. “Let’s get tested, and on three months do another round of confirmatory tests that proves we have been monogamous, and then let’s do away with the condoms. You got my attention, I find you extremely attractive, and we are going to be sharing financial responsibility, the only thing missing from this formula is time. And I mean if these past couple hours keep up like this, you are going to have me for an awfully long time. Let’s get tested.”
John pulled almost all the way out only to snap his hips right back in. He made sure to hit the prostate the best he could, he also admired how Sherlock looked in the mirror; as much as John worries about Sherlock’s weight he found himself absolutely enthralled with being able to watch the outline of his cock making its way up Sherlock’s hole. If he didn’t actually know medicine he would swear he was rearranging Sherlock’s guts every time they fucked because he could just see the length and girth of his cock making it’s way. Yet to combine the motion with Sherlock gagging on a model of his cock, he almost wished it was possible to position Sherlock in a way that he could also watch Sherlock’s throat spasm around the model of John’s cock. John hit Sherlock’s spot all over again sending long strings of pre-cum flying.
“Really pretty boy, i’ve lost track of the times I found you passed out from low blood sugar,” said Irene.
Sherlock looked at John with his eyebrows raised.
He decided to take himself to Ella Thompson's flat. It was part of a duplex in a quiet neighborhood, Mycroft had an easy time parking. It seemed empty, it was 10pm and her spending reports showed that she went to the movies every Saturday and from her social media, her time of choice would put her prime time to   the movies would be at the hour, and given that she lived alone according to the report. Mycroft assumed that he could easily enter the home, glance through the records, and leave before she even came back. He looked again at the records, which showed that she paid for a ticket to a 9:30 pm showing of some action film, so he knew that he had plenty of time.
"I deleted it," said Sherlock.
Please comment I am not quite sure if I might just be going a little too far. Then again I know my Partner and I are also prone to playing in ways that may cause concern for folks.
"Why does things have to change?" Spat out Mycroft, he stood up and picked a seat even farther away from his parents. He sat with his legs crossed and gripping at the arm rests slightly, leaning forward. Mycroft noticed his father copying the same body language, he laughed internally, Siger might be aiming to subtly open his trust. Mycroft knew that trick.
