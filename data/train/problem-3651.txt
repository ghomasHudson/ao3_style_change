Pressing down on you, no man ask for
" I think, my love," Kristen explained pointing at the banner "that our friends and family have come together to congratulate us on our engagement."
After Mary and Jack had watched the play, the three men spent most of the rest of the night explaining the parts that were real and the ones that were entirely Marie (why did everyone think Dean was a woman, damnit!). After that the Angel and the nephilim went to another part of the bunker so the boys could have a talk with Mary.  She took everything surprisingly well, though she did struggle with a few aspects involving her late husband. It was never her intention to have the boys grow up as hunters.
"It's over when I say it is!" Chuck snarled. Amara shoved Dean and Sam out of the way before a burst of power hit her across the chest, sending her stumbling back.
Cas pulled Jack into a hug, squeezing him with all he had. "I love you Jack."  He released the boy from his arms, but kept his hands fully on Jack's shoulders, staring firmly into his eyes. "And I am so proud of you."
"Yeah," Dean scoffed. "Pretty sure he knows that. "
The first part of the morning was spent playing various board games. That ended quickly though after a heated argument over the rules of Monopoly. The rest of the morning was spent down in the bunker's shooting gallery. Jack was eager to show off the skills he had learned from Mary. The others used the time to fine tune their aims, turning it into a contest to see who was the best shot. It was pretty much a three way tie between the Winchesters.
Aziraphale bent down and held out his hand to shake Adam's hand. ‚ÄúHello, Adam. It's a pleasure to see you again. This is our friend Dean. He is a very long way away from home, and we were hoping that you could help him get back.‚Äù
üé∂...I felt the coldness of my winter
"Alright, let's get going before all the Gas 'N Sips are closed." Dean said, trying to quickly change the subject. "We gotta grab a few snacks on the way back. I ain't sitting through that play again on an empty stomach."
Sam wanted nothing more, than to tell Dean that he should have learned his lesson the first time with the Angel. It wasn't like he didn't like Castiel. Of course he did. He was appreciative of everything the guy had done for them. Dean was right that he had saved their asses more than once. It was just‚Ä¶.at the end of the day, whether they liked him or not, Castiel had betrayed them. He understood that perfectly. What he couldn't understand, was why dean was so suprised by him doing it again. Hell, Dean had been the one to bring up that fact that the guy wasn't acting right since he got back and yet, there he was, praying to him, putting his trust in him again. It was maddening, to say the least. He had tried to talk to his brother about it, but Dean immediately shut down.
"Oh, yes, right, of course." Crowley nodded. "And spouting off words from the holy book, dictated by the very entity, Heaven bent on destroying us all, where any one of them can hear you, is most definitely a better option." Aziraphale stopped walking to fix the demon with an unamused glare. Crowley rolled his eyes and grabbed Aziraphale by the sleeve to keep pulling him along. "Forgive me if I'm not oozing with confidence at the moment." He said in a harsh whisper. "I'm a tad fixated on the fact that regardless of whether we accomplish anything here, we are still utterly FUCKED!"
" How...dare...you." Chuck seethed. "You selfish, useless.... no...no that's not possible. How is that possible?"
‚ÄúAnd what about what everyone else needs? Huh? What about what you need?‚Äù She huffed back.
"Exactly!" She exclaimed, like that should have been the answer.
Dean nodded his head and twisted around to face the angel. "What about you, Cas? Feel like choking down some molecules?"
‚ÄúMakes me sick just to look at him.‚Äù Crowley grunted.
"What?" Dean sobbed pitifully, just wishing Cas would end this already. It was like a cat playing with his food before devouring it. It was cruel, and unfair, and Dean was just ready to die.
*****
"You're not killing innocent people to make new angels, Gabriel!‚Äù Sam said.
" Right behind you..... Dad..." Jack snickered.
"Like father like son really." And no. Dean wasn't dead. He had lost his fucking mind. It finally happened. He had actually gone insane and was hallucinating, because there was absolutely no way Meg was standing behind him. "Lucifer didn't expect his demons to turn on him either...and....well...you know the rest."
Dean stopped and pulled his head up to see a grin across the angel's face. "Did...did you just Han Solo me?"
"If Dean is dying, why the hell aren't you there with him?!" Sam cried.
Then a wicked smile passed Sam's lips. In light of the past few hours, Dean had almost completely forgotten about what he and Cas started fighting about in the first place. That was, until he saw that evil fucking smirk. "So I guess that means you two kissed and made up?"
"I mean..." Sam said.
"Ha, yeah." Sam said, shaking himself out. "I've heard." He took his last sip and set the glass on the table. "I guess that's pretty much why Aziraphale's here. He got a demon with him too, but he took off with Dean and... I don't know it's all so fucked up."
"It is indeed." Aziraphale agreed with a tiny smirk. He tucked the box of medical supplies into the bottom drawer of the wardrobe where he found it and turned to leave before Dean cleared his throat.
‚ÄúWhy's that?‚Äù Dean growled.
"Yeah, and why is that, Dean." Sam was reaching the end of his rope again. Dean was already pissed so why not air everything out now. "Why are you suddenly concerned about Cas? Because you sure as hell didn't seem to care when you locked his kid in a box. Or when you blamed him for Mom and told him he was dead to you! But then, any time he dies or you two are separated, you're a complete wreck!"
" I don't think I'll ever be used to you making references like that." Dean smiled.
Dean's smile fell slightly as he fought the wince that was threatening to break. ‚ÄúI miss my buddy. Not really that hard to believe.‚Äù
"I didn't really have that much of a choice." Crowley mumbled.
‚ÄúI don't see what's so fucking funny here.‚Äù Dean said, a little annoyed by the mockery of these two assholes. ‚ÄúI deserve a little more respect after saving the world, your asses included.‚Äù
As the time for Siobhan and Kristen to arrive drew nearer, the men made their way to the back of the crowd. It wasn't their night, after all, the focus should really be on the happy couple. When the clock struck 7:30 all the lights were shut off in the house. Marie hadn't mentioned it was a surprise party before, so the men were a little confused at first, but they caught on quickly and began to hide. A few moments later, the front door cracked open and the lights we're on with every one yelling "Congratulations!"
Dean smiled back down at Adam and clapped him on the shoulders. ‚ÄúSure, you were, kid. But I told you my world is dangerous. You really shouldn't be here.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay...‚Äù Dean said, holding his hands up in defense. ‚ÄúBut like, why?‚Äù
Dean was eyeing her carefully as she made her way to the door, when he felt Cas nudging his shoulder. "Move, I have to get up."
"It always is with you, isn't it?" Aziraphale smiled, one eyebrow quirked. His smile only grew wider as he felt the huff of Crowley's answering chuckle breeze over the skin on his cheek. "What was it this time then?"
AKF my friends. YANA.
"Holy water?!"
‚ÄúI try.‚Äù She said hugging him back. ‚ÄúBesides, someone has got to take care of you. I'm glad it's him. An angel is kind of a handy tool to have in your back pocket.‚Äù Dean couldn't hold back the chuckle at his Mary's unintentional innuendo. ‚Äú Oh, grow up!‚Äù she laughed stepping back and swatting him on the shoulder.
"I'm not a fucking babysitter." She huffed, repeating the same sentence she did every time she joined him. Dean chuckled, as he usually did, earning him the same bitchface he got every time. "I'm serious!" She snapped "Do I look like some fucking 'Holly Homemaker' to you? I'm a hunter. I've had a fucking angel live inside of me before! I should be out there, slashing monsters, not playing tea party with a bunch of snot nosed brats! It's humiliating!"
Dean took his tone as confirmation that he was on the right track. ‚ÄúLook, I may not be the sharpest knife in the block, but I ain't stupid. I fell, on my back on your stupid stone floor and, I don't feel a damn thing. You wave your hand and magically knock me out, I'm guessing I probably hit my head pretty hard on the way down and all my cogs are still ticking away at full strength.‚Äù Dean saw Aziraphale swallow hard. Good. Maybe he would get his answers easier than he thought. ‚ÄúI'm no spring chicken. There are mornings I hurt myself crawling out of bed, more often than not these days, and I get tossed on the ground here, wake up and feel 20 years younger? That ain't natural! So, I'm gonna ask you again, and if you want your answers, I'm want mine. What...Are...You?‚Äù
Chuck glared up at him, his grip tightening as he waited for the hunter to explain, but Dean could barely manage to form those words. The only thing keeping him on his feet was Chuck's iron hold. All he wanted to do was crumble to the ground and accept his fate. The air was thick, electrified by Chuck‚Äôs rage, the ground began to quake.
üé∂It is the springtime of my loving
~Such Small Hands~
"No."
"I'm just trying to understand here Dean." Sam let out a mirthless laugh. "Why is it one minute he's dead to you and the next you can't function without him? You know, why is it that you're the only one who gets to hurt him? You get to yell at him and hurt his feelings over and over, but the second anyone else lifts a finger against him he's suddenly this fragile thing that needs you to protect him?"
Sam narrowed his eyes and slipped into a bitch face. " I know what 'bisexuals' are, Dean. I'm not stupid. Please. I've known you've had a thing for dudes ever since that whole 'Dr. Sexy' incident. I just never thought you'd actually admit to it."
'We're just better together."
"There you two are!" Aziraphale smiled, marching into the room, followed closely by a weary looking Sam and a (still) utterly wrecked Castiel. "We've been looking all over for you."
Sam groaned and followed him again. "What are you going to do when you find him, huh? "
Sam would never forget the first time he had walked in on Dean in the throes of passion. He was a few months shy of fourteen and they had been staying at the same hotel for a little over two  months. John had been tracking down a powerful coven for a while and he managed to get a general location. Sam was still too young to help out and John didn't trust him on his own yet so, he ditched the two of them in a hotel, once they got close enough. Sam had been enrolled at the local school and Dean took a job at a nearby diner to keep money flowing. It was barely enough to keep them boarded and keep food on their plates, but for a while it served as one of the most stable times in both of their lives. Every day Sam would go to school, and Dean would go to work, making sure he got off just in time to be back at the hotel to meet Sam. He would do his homework while Dean made dinner and the two of them would sit down and watch TV or read until it was time for bed. On the weekends, Sam would go to the library while Dean worked and when they came home Dean would teach him how to play poker or they would sneak into a nearby pool hall and they would hustle games for some spare cash.
Cas let out a mirthless chuckle and shook his head. " I think, if it knew any better, it would see that I'm suffering enough now to suffice."
"Why do you need my assistance then." Cas asked (a little bitterly, in Dean's opinion). "I'm sure your demon friend and Rowena will provide sufficient protection."
‚ÄúSome do.‚Äù Rowena said, stepping forward. ‚ÄúNot all of them are visible from the outside, is all.‚Äù She stepped up to Anathema, sizing her up as she rounded her. ‚ÄúDid I hear that correctly? You're a witch?‚Äù
‚ÄúWatch it, Angel!‚Äù Crowley hissed. ‚ÄúAlright, that's enough then! Come on, let's go‚Äù He grabbed Dean by the shoulder and started shoving him out of the door.
" Oh, nothing I suppose. " Cas said pointedly. "I did ask her however, if there was anything she felt we should bring to the party tonight. I felt it was rude to arrive empty handed. She assured me that us being there would suffice."  He chuckled.
She smiled wide as she placed her free hand down on the bar and leaned in to Cas's bubble. Having no sense of personal space himself, he remained unmoved, which she read as encouragement. " You, know I've   been working  here a long time. I see a lot of men drink themselves  silly. I don't  think I've  seen many who can..." She paused, looking Cas up and down and gave him a wink "...handle themselves....quite as well as you." She stood back up sliding the empty  glasses towards her, never breaking eye contact. "If I didn't know any better, I'd  think you were some kind of freak."
"Inactive?!" Dean was shocked at the angel's, almost, caviler tone as he took in the utter destruction around them. " Are you not seeing thi...." He looked around again noticing that the land beyond them seemed completely untouched. The chaos was only a few hundred feet around, almost like someone had planted a burning building on top of the forest. It looked insanely familiar. " Did...did you go full angel for me buddy?" Dean asked Cas through the rear-view mirror.
‚ÄúIt's not....I... I don't....‚Äù Sam stuttered in shock.
She took a small step to place herself between the two brothers, putting both her hands in front of her. "Careful, Samuel. He just woke up."
The look on Sam's face was enough to make Dean wanna punch him. "You know what Samantha? You can shove it up your ass!"
"Now, I believe we have an apocalypse to prevent and a God to stop. We should find the other's and get to it. I do have a shop to run so time is of the essence." He nodded once, pulling at the bottom of his coat to straighten it out and marched out of the room.
He was gone and he was never coming back.
******
"You expect us to trust you? After everything you did? All the pain you caused? How do we know you‚Äôre not just setting us up to fail again? What does it matter to us if the world is destroyed? You've already gotten us killed once. Why should we die again?"
"Oh, fuck you!" Dean grumbled.
I think I saw you in my dreams
Sam, walked out of the bathroom  after washing his hands for about the fifteenth time. He figured he had waited long enough and as unsure as he was about the situation he was going to walk back to, he knew he would have to face it sooner or later. To his suprise, instead of approaching a fuming brother and a sulking angel, he found the two of them pressed together, holding hands, heads resting against eachother. "Oh, thank Chuck all this crazy tension is over!" He said as he sat down in his previous seat. "It's  about damn time you two got your heads out of your asses! Hey what happened to my beer?"
Aziraphale's face lit up like a Christmas tree at the demon's suggestion. ‚ÄúThat sounds like a splendid idea, my dear!‚Äù He beamed. ‚ÄúThe Ritz as usual?‚Äù
Cas turned to him with an annoyed huff, eyes flicking briefly between him and Sam before landing on the plate in his hand. "Your pie is on fire."
‚ÄúAdam, no.‚Äù Anathema shook her head.
They say your life flashes before your eyes before you die, but Dean had died enough times now, to know that was all bullshit. All you see is darkness, nothing, but maybe that was just because he had never stayed dead. Now that this was really the end though, his final farewell, he could say for certain it was still completely untrue. You don't see your life, you see the dead, rising out of the blackness to greet you. Why it was only angels he was seeing, popping up out of the black goo surrounding him, he had no idea, but that's what had to be happening. All around them a wave of sticky black sludge produced angel after angel ( some they had seen destroyed with their own eyes) standing with their wings flared out, blades in hand until the room was flooded with them and the goo gathered in front of Chuck, taking human form, and this had to be the end because, as the goo receded in left Death himself in its wake...except that wasn't possible either... because Death was dead too!
I am so sorry. I know how frustrating it can be to have a story you've been reading put on hold like that. Please forgive me. I promise I haven't abandoned this .
"Dean..." The angel groaned into the hunter's ear, pressing his body tighter against him to halt his movements.
"Fuck you, Dean." It came out of Cas's mouth in a near whisper, completely without his permission,
******
He turned around to see the former reaper smiling, leaning casually against her scythe. "Billie." He nodded stiffly, resisting the urge to back away.
Click.
"Oh." Sam said, taken aback by the angel's sudden outburst. Then everything clicked I to place. "Oooh!" That's how Aziraphale knew about how Cas felt. He knew that an angel would never rebel for anything other than love because...then he started thinking about what he had witnessed between his brother and the demon since they got back. The pushy nature and the weird behavior. He had been thinking that something was going on between them, that Dean just decided to say 'fuck it ' to sexual norms and start fooling around with a demon...but now it was making sense...at least...he hoped..."Are you two.... are you his exception, too...or..."
'Please.' Cas found himself begging silently, throwing a blade towards Chuck to throw him off. He was praying again, but this time to Dean. 'Please get out of here. Please leave. Get yourself somewhere safe.'
"Where you going?" he asked. Now that the situation was defused he was hoping to have a little more one on one time with his mother.
So this chapter was super important for me to write. I needed Dean to realize that not all forms of love, outside of family love, are inherently sexual. That it's possible to be madly in love with someone without wanting to jump their bones all the time. I also needed him to understand that the concept of gender has ( almost) nothing to do with sexuality. Love is love. No matter which way you slice it. The world is changing and learning to accept the fact that gender and sexuality aren't black and white concepts ( hi! I am a proud member of the grey here) for some reason I needed crowely to be the one to help him understand that.
"Cas, wait!" Dean called out before they found themselves standing in a field a little over a mile away. "No!"
After Dean and Cas had calmed down from their fit of laughter, the three men made their way through the party to bid the girls goodbye. They gave each of them their emergency numbers and told them to call in case anything ever happened that they couldn't handle. Siobhan told them to look out for a wedding invite ( via text of, course) while Kristen gave them each a massive bear hug. As they were heading out the door they made sure to thank Marie again for the invite and told her to text their numbers to Maggie as well. Dean had no plans to hop on a plane to Rome anytime soon, but he figured as long as the others had a way to contact them, she should too.
"That's how I remember it. " Crowley pouted turning his head away.
‚ÄúWell, no.‚Äù Aziraphale dropped his eyes in shame. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Dean. I tried to explain our plight, but the archangels just wrote me off. None of them were willing to believe the almighty was capable of such malice. They called me a 'boob' and sent me away. I'm afraid if Adam is unable to help you, you'll be stuck with us forever.‚Äù
"It will be our pleasure!" Aziraphale smiled again.
"Yeah. You do that." Dean said as Crowley followed Aziraphale down the hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You heard them in there!" Crowley hissed, turning to face him. "They're talking about killing people and taking their souls! Not, monsters, Aziraphale. People! They've gone completely mad with desperation! I'm getting you out of here before they decide to ad us into the mix for extra measure!"
Dean shook his head, doing his best to avoid his brother's questioning gaze. "He told me..he told me I was worth more than I thought I was. That I wasn't just some tool. That I was worth more than just the people I saved. He‚Ä¶ I don't know, man‚Ä¶he just kept talking about me like I was this amazing thing‚Ä¶like I was something special. Said I was the reason he learned to care about stuff‚Ä¶the reason he changed‚Ä¶that was the one who taught him‚Ä¶that I taught him to‚Ä¶to love."
‚ÄúIf you're asking about the nature of my relationship with Aziraphale, well---‚Äù Crowley took a deep breath and looked Dean dead in the eye (as best he could underneath his sunglasses) ‚ÄúI have stood by his side for over six thousand years, and in those six thousand years, I have watched him do some really stupid things in the name of goodness. He gave away his flaming sword which literally became the summoning tool for War. He tried to justify drowning children because it was part of the Ineffable plan. He trusted a complete stranger that lead him into a den of Nazis because he believed in the good of humanity. He gave holy water to a demon once, so the demon wouldn't risk his life to acquire it himself.‚Äù He paused as sad smiled crossed his face. He shook it off quickly and heaved another sigh. ‚ÄúFor over six thousand years I have watched him muck up time and time again and still, for over six thousand years, I have stood by his side. Not because I have to, and certainly not because it was fun, or easy, but because I wanted to. And because he has done the same for me. I've made my fair share of mistakes, as well, over the years, after all... I'm no angel.‚Äù Crowley chuckled to himself as he swallowed down the last of the fries. ‚Äú So yes, if you're asking if I love him, absolutely, just that, it's in a way that I don't think that you can quite comprehend.'‚Äù
‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù Adam asked excitedly.
He let himself cry, until the tears ran out, waiting until the next stage flowed through him again. Because this was it for him now. And endless cycle of emotions. Forever. The only solace he took in it, was that at least he knew what to expect. Forever.
Sam chuckled softly, shaking his head at the guy's ridiculously, unending optimistic tone, even in the face of certain death. "Yeah. Okay, point taken."
Sam took a moment to realize what the Angel was referring to, shaking his head with disappointment when it clicked. "Cas, that doesn't..."
"What do you mean it said we don't need you?"
"I'm not entirely certain I'm completely restored, no. " Cas replied. " But that appears to be the case so far. I'm still weakened a bit, as my powers are tied to Heaven, and well.... but yes, I am more myself than I have been in recent years."
"How are we supposed to get him in there?!"
Marie just shrugged. " Well I couldn't have very well fit all these people in the dorms. That would've been a fire code distaster!"
"He loved us, so much, Sam." Dean answered.
‚ÄúIt doesn't mean you listen.‚Äù Crowley replied in the same tone, prompting a huff from the angel as he set down the glass and walked away. Crowley chuckled and side-stepped Dean, pulling a pair of pants, a dress shirt, and a vest off the rack and handing it to him. ‚ÄúThese look about your size. Go and try the on, and be quick about it. He gets a bit tetchy when he hasn't eaten.‚Äù
"The feeling ain't mutual." He lied, trying to keep focused on the task at hand.
"I mean... it's just... I didn't know...like...wow...Cas are you...?" Sam sputtered.
The demons all scrambled to their feet and backed themselves up against the wall as Cas crossed back to Dean across the room. "C- C- Castiel." The female demon stuttered, pressing herself closer to the wall as he passed. "I see you've got your wings back. How ya been?"
Monster madness and finding a trap for God.
"Not happening Winchester." Meg shook her head. "You won't last a second in there. Your part in this is done, we can handle the rest."
‚ÄúWicked!‚Äù Adam exclaimed in awe as he stepped further into the bunker from the portal. ‚ÄúA real-life alien planet!‚Äù
"What sort of thing?" She shouted back.
"No, man. No. You can't do this to us." Dean argued. "Not, now."
"What are you talking about?! Where is he?!"
All hope is lost, Sam's giving up and Cas is angry.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Cas interrupted, lazily waving his hand up to stop whatever Sam had to say. ‚ÄúJust don't, okay? I'm not your brother, Sam. I don't have a drinking problem. I'm not constantly looking for the solution to my sorrows and fears at the bottom of a bottle. I'm well aware that alcoholism isn't a healthy coping mechanism.‚Äù
Dean grabbed his shattered hand in his other fist, but kept his eyes squarely on Castiel, tears pooling at the corners of his eyes. "You promised me Cas!" He screamed, the pain evident in his voice. "You promised me you weren't gonna do this again!"
"Oh..." Crowley nodded. ‚Äúthat‚Äôll do it." He turned then to Castiel and gave him a wicked smile. "And you of course, are the infamous Cas. We've heard all about you. And Sam over there of course. But you were the more interesting story I have to say." He held out his hand to shake Cas's only to be met with a blank stare.
Also a GIANT thank you for all the positive vibes and to everyone who's chosing to stick this through with me. You guys are the best and this would never have gotten this far without you.
"Oh yeah?" Said another defiant angel towards the front. "How?" He wasn't expecting her to appear right beside him.
"C'mon Jody." Claire protested. "If Dean doesn't have any shame, he should have any problem with me telling everyone that he..."
"But we did." Dean growled. "You got him back, and nothing happened. Not for a while, and not because we got him back. Right?!" Cas looked away again, squeezing his eys shut. "RIGHT?!"
"No. My plan was to leave and never come back, so I wouldn't have to see your
Dean shook his head. ‚ÄúLook man, I'm in the business of lying. I've been talking to people who got somethin to hide my whole life. I may not be a genius or anything like that, but I know people. She's hiding something.‚Äù
Cas was full on shouting now and the fear was growing strong. Dean found himself limping backwards. He knew it had been a close call, Aziraphale had told him as much but he had no idea he was the reason why. "Cas, man, I..."
Dean looked down at himself and pouted when he saw that Cas had put his shirt and boxers back on. "How come?"
"As Castiel mentioned," Aziraphale pipped in "though the immediate threat is vanquished, there is still the future that lies ahead. Your world is still a dangerous one, and it would be beneficial for everyone to be prepared to deal with said dangers."
Maeve ran over and gave Sam a big hug. "Thank you, I think." She took a step back from Sam and glanced over at Cas "Oh, wow!" She said breathlessly tucking a piece of loose hair behind her ear. "Are...are you Castiel?"
She slid off the desk and took a step away from it, holding her head up high. "I don't like the idea of caging my brother away for the rest of time as he intended to do to me. However, it is necessary, to prevent him from harming anyone else, ever again." He stared at her blankly, waiting for her to continue and get to the point. "There aren't enough souls to complete the cage" she said bluntly.
‚ÄúGod has no say in my death. It's true, there will be no Earth, no Heaven, no Hell. There will only be one thing left, one place where everything, everyone will end up. Everyone except me.‚Äù Cas shook his head; his voice was breaking. ‚ÄúThat would be too easy. It said it wanted me to suffer. I imagine spending the rest of forever alone after watching everything destroyed would suffice.‚Äù
*crawls out from under piles of laundry, over mountains of toys, through the dishes, clad only in ratty old pj's with disheveled hair and dark circles beneath both eyes* Hello? is anybody still there?! If you are, I am SO FUCKING SORRY! If you read the chapter before this than you know what happened a few months ago. WHile i had begun to rewrite my ending....it was complete garbage. I rewrote it several times. so much so, that i began to lose motivation. I lost all the passion i had for this story, unable to recreate the ending i originally had. Piled on with life, holidays, a terrifying hospital visit, trying to raise kids, and then Corona, my passion had almost completely fizzled out. I'm not gonna lie to ya'll i almost abandoned this fic entirely. it was impossible to find the time to sit down and write with the kids being home and trying to balance a household in a time of crisis. and then i began reading again. I was killing two, three fics a week, and i came upon one i really enjoyed. It ticked all my boxes and was super long and i was so happy with it until i got to the final chapter....It was incomplete...i checked the date...it had been incomplete for years. And i realized that feeling of despair, might be something i may have caused some one else.so i sat down and i wrote.
"What can I say? The guy broke me." Dean shrugged.
That's how he sat, as Jack explained to them the Deal that was made, as Jack sobbed his apology for the life of their friend. That's how he sat as Jack curled against his shoulder and cried, while Billie claimed she had no idea that the Shdow planned to take Castiel's life before he was happy, breaking their deal. How he sat while Eileen comforted Sam as he sobbed silently into Eileen's shoulder, while they all had a moment of silence for their fallen family member. He sat there, just like that, while everyone had a drink, apologizing to eachother, to Dean. Long after everyone had gone to bed, to prepare for the day ahead.
Cas responded with a confused, angry glare. Dean was gonna have to remember to explain it to him later. " Okay, everybody load up." Dean said after clearing his throat. " Let's get this show on the road. Samsquatch here gets shot-gun so he don't crush anybody with those tree trunks of his he calls legs. Jack's gotta have a window seat since he gets car sick and I ain't having anyone yakking all over my Baby." He pointed between Mary and Cas. " So, I guess it's up to you two to decide which of you wants to ride bitch."
Cas opened his mouth to protest, but no words came. There was nothing to protest. Aziraphale was right. He was no better than a demon. A shuffling of glass signaled the arrival of another person, and he turned his head to see Sam with a perturbed look on his face, enter the room, armed with a large broom and dust pan.
"Alright, that's quite enough." Crowley said smashing the witch's orb on the floor, stuffing an extra into his pocket. "I've seen enough touchy-feely things these past few weeks to last me the next few centuries. Sam, quite the brain on you, young man. Don't lose that tenacity." He smirked. "Dean," he paused a few emotions crossing his features before his cool demeanor has returned, "Your music taste is terrible, you dress like a homeless person and you‚Äôre the most stubborn creature I have ever met. You would have made an excellent demon. However, I'd be lying to say I haven't enjoyed your company. I suppose I might miss you a little. Feel free to see me anytime you like. I wouldn't mind some more alone time." He finished with a wink.
‚ÄúYour manners could use some adjustments, Angel.‚Äù Crowley chuckled. ‚ÄúThe Youngs are going to start getting suspicious about a grown man calling about their son and hanging up without explanation.‚Äù
Which brought him to his second conclusion that maybe he wasn't 100% straight after all. The signs had always been there, he guessed, but it took him trying to scare off his best friend to get him to realize, he might possibly be seriously attracted to dudes. And speaking of Cas....
‚ÄúNot in my line of work it ain't.‚Äù Dean scoffed.
Aziraphale stepped forward, walking up to Dean and placing his hand softly on his shoulder. "The way Sam explained it to us, the entity that runs to your so called, Empty, will only take Castiel once it feels like he has truly suffered."
üé∂...if I'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry-on, carry-on...üé∂
'Not this shit again', Dean thought to himself. He rolled his eyes and scoffed. "Yeah, well she doesn't have to look at you everyday!"
"I understand." Cas said, his face a mixture of hurt and duty. " You wish me to fly you to Kennesaw in order to ensure you arrive safely."
Cas shifted his gaze towards Sam with his signature head tilt and squint, obviously still confused.
He was also fairly sure that he just broke the angel.
"Don't do that!" Dean practically shouted, shoving him away again. He knew Cas's grace had to be running low after everything that happened. There's no way he had fully recharged. He was gonna make himself sick trying to help Dean.
" Really?" The guy laughed. " The bee?"
"Your friends!" Rowena huffed. "I never claimed any kinship with the likes of them. Most of the people here would like nothing more than to see my head on a platter! They've hunted my kind for years. We might as well put them to use!"
Sam was stuck. She was their only chance to get his brother back. The only chance at lighting a fire back under Cas's ass and getting him back on board. Their only chance at having a chance and she has no reason to help. They had taken advantage of her too many times, just like everyone else they had come across. All she wanted was one good reason. ‚ÄúWhat about love?‚Äù He asked
Crowley turned around and rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest as he leaned against the sink. "None of us 'chose' to fall, Angel. It's not like there was a group of us sitting around, chatting it up saying 'Oye! Yeah, Heaven's great and all, what with the perfect, clean, shiney wonders of it all, but you know what would make it even better? Fire an brimstone! I bet if we add some tortured souls and endless screaming, maybe a few dark pits and dank caverns it would be great!' No! We just made a few, unappreciated, comments and the Almighty picked us up and tossed us down, getting rid of the taint on his perfect little world."
‚ÄúI knew it!‚Äù She said slamming her hands on the table. ‚ÄúI never should have trusted you! It's a blood bath out there and you took my weapon! I'm as good as dead thanks to you! You were supposed to kill Michael, not make things worse!‚Äù
Jack stood by his bed, bag slung over his shoulder, as he stared in confusion at Castiel. This was it. The final peice of the puzzle. Billie  would be here any minute to collect him so they could retrieve the last of the supplies. Sam was on his way back from picking up Eileen. Dean would be back any minute with what he managed to get. Everything was set. They were going to kill God. It was the final chapter, and Castiel already knew his part of the story was coming to an end.
‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù Crowley replied, sounding only mildly interested.
"I've got an idea." Sam said defensively.
Dean scratched the back of his head and looked down. "Of course Cas. You know that. I mean, yeah, you can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but it doesn't mean I care about you any less. I need ya man. I don't think there's really anyone who means more to me, besides Sammy. You're my best friend."
‚ÄúI can assure you, Dean‚Äù Crowley said straightening up, ‚Äúthere's nothing homosexual about us.‚Äú He snatched another fry and twirled it between his fingers.
"Shut up." Dean barked.
He heard Sam scream and oh, no! They were both too close now. It wasn't time. Amara still needed more power; it was too soon. He couldn't make the call yet. They shouldn't be this close....
As Cas positioned himself, ready to strike, ready to try his best to get God to take him out, a wave of panic began coursing through Dean's soul. He was going to watch Cas die again. As long as he lived, however short it would be, he was going to have to lose Cas again, knowing that he just stood there and watched. "Cas, wait!" But what was worse? Living through that pain, that anguish, that emptiness again, for the rest of his incredibly short life, which could very well be a matter of minutes, or Cas having to suffer for the rest of eternity? "Please ..just...wait...." His voice came out in a broken sob. Cas paused turning to face Dean, cerulean orbs pleading with him just to let him get it over with. He had caused the angel too much suffering already. He wasn't about to let it happen again.
Mr. Young's eyes traveled back and forth between his son and the strange men outside for a moment before stepping back inside. ‚ÄúAlright, son.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúYou shout if you need me. Understand?‚Äù
"Dean!" Sam screamed after his brother helplessly, when he felt a hand on his shoulder.
since he got back. There was a lot that needed to be said still, about Mary, about Jack, about everything. He knew that it all needed to be laid out on the table, but now wasn't the best time. He had to focus his energy on what he wanted to say to Cas before it was too late again, and he didn't have time to hash out all that family drama with his baby brother like some fucked up episode of Dr. Phil.
"Not long."
Everyone in the room hummed in agreement as they all leaned back in their chairs, sufficiently stuffed. " I mean hey," Dean shrugged. "Everyone's gotta have a fallback right?"
"You don't  have to do anything you don't want to Cas," Sam told him placing a comforting hand on his shoulder " we can just hang out tonight. It's fine."
Cas shrugged and tilted his head back towards Dean, never slowing his stride. " Yeah. But I'm your dick."
Castiel stiffened and squared his shoulders. He has done plenty of questionable things in his time on Earth...but to be compared to a demon? "Is that so?" He snarled.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come here." Aziraphale said, holding out his arms and approaching the demon.
Dean wiped the grease from his hands on a rag, after closing Baby's hood. She had been through a lot on their little road trip and working on her always helped set his mind at ease. Never mind the fact that he had already detailed her five times in the last three weeks. She was a lady and should be treated as such. It wasn't so much that he was avoiding Castiel today, he was just trying to figure out the right words to say to him. To ask him to stay, without sounding like he was fucking begging. He was a man, damnit. It shouldn't be an issue for a man to tell his friend he didn't want him to go off and get killed, but every time Dean thought of something to say to him, it just came out sounding mushy as fuck. He knew why it was so hard, but he put the reason in the back of his mind (just like everything else he didn't want to deal with) and tried his best to come up with something that came off just on the good side of desperate. Before he could gather his nerve though, he was met face to face with a towering pile of puppy dog eyes.
Everything.
‚ÄúOoooh.‚Äù They responded in unison.
"You did the best you could for us." Dean said firmly.
Thank you so much for the encouragement and support guys. This has really been a fun piece to write and it makes it better knowing that there are others who enjoy it üòä
" Alright." Aziraphale nodded. "I guess that means it will give us more time for Castiel and I too continue discussing the differences between our worlds" he added brightly.
Cas looked up at Dean with a smug smile across his face. "See, Dean? She thinks I look nice."
"Stop it!" Aziraphale scoffed. "Yes. I hadn't even thought about it until we were in there with Dean, and then I realized, I've never actually said the words. The world is ending, all of existence is as a matter of fact, and I realized, we might very well die without me ever telling you that I love you."
‚Äú I got eyes‚Äù Dean defended.
Day day de mm hm
Chuck stood in shock, his mouth slightly open as he raised a hand to one cheek and traced the cut, pulling it away to inspect the blood. "All I ever wanted was for us to be happy." He half whispered, staring down at his hand, running a thumb over the bloodied fingers. "I wanted us to be loved. All I ever asked for was cooperation, support in creating perfection." He looked up at Amara, his face almost pained. "You're never going to let me have that, are you?"
"I told him it was fine." Mary assured. "I always kind of wanted grandchildren and I figured, considering who he feels his fathers are, it fits."
"I haven't slightest idea what you mean."
Aziraphale straightened up, giving the demon a slightly annoyed look at, what must've been, some secret innuendo and shook his head. He tried his best not to smile at the demon's ridiculous joke as he addressed Dean. ‚ÄúVery well then, if the two of you wouldn't mind joining me in the back room, we have quite a bit to discuss in regard to our new friend here.‚Äù He turned on his heel and began walking away while the other two followed before pausing. ‚Äú Oh, and Crowley, dear, please take off those sunglasses of yours. It's far too dark back there for you have them on.‚Äù
They spent a small dinner together, piled inside the Dean cave, while the others took the kitchen and the library, talking about everything they had gone through. They laughed at the misunderstandings that had occurred over their time together, they shared stories of what each of them went through while the others weren't around, they even spared a moment of silence for the lives that had been lost. They talked well into the night, and by the time they were done, they agreed it would be best to get some rest before the journey ahead.
"It ain't ya idjit." Bobby chuckled in response, to Dean's surprise.
‚ÄúWell, there's hardly room for him here with me.‚Äù Aziraphale explained. ‚ÄúAnd we can't just throw him out in the street. Besides,‚Äù he paused and gave a brief wink to Dean before turning back to Crowley with, what could only be described as, the most pitiful set of puppy dog eyes Dean had ever seen (which was saying a lot, considering he had lived with Sam his whole life) ‚Äúhe's still a complete stranger after all. He might very well be dangerous. Heaven knows what might happen if we left him and the weapon in the same place...‚Äù
"Contrary to what you believe, not everything is about you, Dean." Crowley said "What are you making?"
"Cas?" He asked, concerned.
‚Äú No, Cas. I wanna know! At least give me some sort of timeline here, so I'm not just lying in wait, worrying over when I'm gonna lose you again.‚Äù Dean's anger was starting to melt away, being replaced with heart wrenching misery.
‚ÄúI can hear you, you know.‚Äù Aziraphale said from a few feet away, holding up a glass to the light inspecting it.
"Well," he swallowed, sure she was about to think he had gone mad, "it seems‚Ä¶it seems to have grown a foot!" He explained, staring at the shiny shoe that was now poking out of the light.
‚ÄúNah,‚Äù Dean smirked, ignoring Anathema's warning, ‚ÄúI got a pretty dangerous job. It takes up a lot of my time. I don't really have the energy for a girlfriend or anything like that.‚Äù
"You'll get over it." Crowley said.
Crowley dipped his head trying to hide his shy smile. "I do. Don't tell him that. His head is big enough as it is."
"Sam? Are you awake?" She asked, nudging him in the side with her foot. "I would know if you were dead, so you can stop pretending."
"Then I guess it's time I go sit in my new throne. Those demons are probably gonna shit a brick when they see me waltz up in that bitch." She chuckled, before kissing Cas's cheek. "Stay golden Pony Boy." She smiled before turning back to give Gabe another wink. (And seriously? What the hell was that?) "I'll be seeing you later, Short Stack." And in a puff of black smoke, she was gone.
"Not really." Cas replied, grimly.
"Yes." Aziraphale said, walking through the threshold, before shooting a small smile over his shoulder at Dean. "I suppose I did."
"We've already lost so much," Sam answered, his voice broken "I've already lost her so many times I can't‚Ä¶"
"Well at least I made it to Heaven." He said to himself with a smile on his face.
‚ÄúWe should play a game.‚Äù Aziraphale swooped in, trying to save Dean. Unfortunately, it ended up dampening his mood slightly more. The mention of Cas and games in the same few moments caused his heart to drop a little, remembering a time that playing games was all Cas wanted to do. ‚ÄúAs long as it ain't Sorry or Twister, I'm down.‚Äù
"You're under reacting!" Dean spat back.
"I'm gonna kill both of you!" Dean yelled. "Slowly!"
He glanced back up into the rear view, ignoring the wicked smile growing on Rowena's face, to see Cas's face scrunch up in confusion as his head tilted to the side.
"I certainly wouldn't mind having such a saucy counterpart." Gabriel said with a wink. "What do ya say toots? I take the good souls, you take the bad, maybe occasionally meet in the middle to do a little soul searching of our own?"
"He was so willing to give up his happiness to keep him safe, that it blinded him from the truth." Aziraphale said, staring at Dean sadly.
Dean's soul had sung to Castiel in Hell. For forty years, he had fought in the pit against demons, taking blow after blow, striking down every demon that stood in his way, and he would be lying if we're to say that it was his sense of duty to the mission that drove him. For forty years he longed to find the source of that song, to bask in the glory of its tune and let it consume him. Forty years he dredged through fire, and sulfur, battered and worn, unwilling to accept defeat until he could lose himself at the feet of what was creating such an exquisite sound. It was pointless ugly noise compared to the moment he saw Dean's soul. In all his existence, he had never seen anything so divine (blasphemous implications be damned). Even torn to shreds, laying broken and bare in the deepest, darkest pits of Hell, it was beautiful and bright. It was agonizing, glorious, perfect. He had never held so much purity as when he was piecing Dean's soul back together. Never felt so much love. Dean had sacrificed his life for his family. He gave up his childhood to make sure his brother had some semblance of one. He had dedicated his freedom to helping others, to saving the world. He was willing to save the souls of humanity, even those who were unwilling to save themselves, never wanting anything in return. Never expecting anything for himself, because he truly believed that was what he was meant to do. Castiel had fallen for his soul before he had ever even met him.
‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Crowley stormed passed towards the door, clearly still irritated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be glad to have my home back. It's starting to smell like a wild animal, anyway.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sam asked. ‚ÄúWhat am I missing? That the world is ending? Yeah, no, pretty sure I got the memo, thanks.‚Äù He returned to scratching his families initials on the table. All hope was lost, so it's not like he had anything better to do.
Ah, don't keep convincin'üé∂
Cas just laughed as he walked ahead of Dean, who was silently cursing that damn trenchcoat for preventing him from checking out the angel's ass.
Crowley closed his door and ran his hands over the steering wheel, missing the feel of the leather beneath his skin. He turned to the side to see Aziraphale sitting up straight, hands folded neatly in his lap, staring straight the window with a melancholy look upon his face. "Oh, come now Aziraphale, I was only teasing."
‚Äú Hey!‚Äù Dean said it mock offense. Cas just shrugged. ‚ÄúOkay. You're right. I'm sorry. And I do, love you, I mean. I think I always have. I don't know. It's weird. Ever since you burst into that barn... I always feel better when you're by my side, ya know? Complete.  And that's where I want you Cas, right here. Right with me. For the rest of my life, however long that is.‚Äù Then Cas sat up. 'Shit' Dean thought to himself. 'Shit shit shit. Why'd I say that?'  ‚ÄúListen, man, I'm sorry I didn't mean to...‚Äù
‚ÄúDean?‚Äù
"Dean, stop."  Cas commanded in a low, breathy voice.
‚ÄúDean!‚Äù Aziraphale and Crowley practically shouted together.
The crowd erupted in applause as the two girls seals their union with a kiss. The music began to play, as the happily married couple retreat back down the aisle waving to everyone as they made their way outside for pictures. Everyone began to scatter out, some to the food and bar, others to the dance floor while some went outside to watch photos being snapped.
"Crowley, that's enough!" Aziraphale snapped. "Dean's going through enough right now. This is hardly the time for..."
No, he had been to hell. This was worse.
"I understand, that several of you may have reservations about following my lead, but now is the time to put the past behind us and work together to fight for what is right." Castiel said as he paced along the lines of angels, an air of command in his voice that he thought he had lost years ago.
"Hey, you said I never talk." Dean shrugged. "So, here I am. I'm talking."
"No, no that's not it!" his eyes shot up to meet hers. "Well that's kinda it, but that's not really what I mean. You said Edlund stopped writing after 'Swan Song' but I saw a couple things that no one would know about unless....you didn't tell anyone about the things I told you did you? The stuff about Sam's soul and me being a demon or whatever."
Cas placed his hands on either side of Dean, trapping him further. "You seem frightened, Dean." He rumbled, his face barely a few inches from the hunter's. "Funny, considering you seem to have no problem with irritating me for your own amusement." His head tilted to the side and his eyes narrowed and Dean could swear he saw them glow for a second. "Do I frighten you?"
Aziraphale let his eyes slip closed as he let Crowley sway them back and forth. "You have?"
I think I saw you in my dreams you were
"Cas..." The man began before being cut off.
"You stink, Cas." Sam said interrupting him. Cas lifted his head and stared into Sam's eyes another apology on his lips. "I mean you really stink. You smell like the dead, dude. C'mon." He stepped back from the angel and went to his drawer, pulling out the smallest clothes he had. "Let's get you cleaned up so you can get some sleep. I'll crash in the library tonight until we can get rid of the body, and we'll talk some more about you being a dumbass for not thinking we care in the morning."
Sam watched as the angel stumbled back to his room, refusing to look back, leaving him in the room with a dangerous and angry teenage girl. He looked back at Kaia, his eyes pleading, hoping for one last shot. ‚ÄúKaia, please.‚Äù He begged. ‚ÄúPlease, we'll do anything we can. You're in this as much as we are now. We'll give you protection, we'll try to help you find a way home, just...please....‚Äù
‚ÄúCas!‚Äù Dean snapped, a little louder than necessary.
any way...here ya go.
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He answered. ‚ÄúWell... I can't really read them, it's more like pictures. I just discovered it recently. I used it to figure out what pepper wanted for her birthday. I wanted my gift to be the best, so everyone knew I was still on charge of course.‚Äù
Without Dean he would have fallen into the ranks. He would have continued to carry out the orders of his superiors, however cruel they seemed (or otherwise be brain washed into doing it anyway). He had always been a little different, yes, but without Dean he never would have known why. Dean taught him about choice, about freewill...about love. Who knows how lost he would be without him?
"Yeah. And we said we were gonna do better!" Dean huffed. "Guess I'm the only one who's tryin."
I thought it would be good for Mary to address all the things she's seen between Dean and Cas since she's been back. Honestly, that's not even the half of it and the fact that people can still deny that there's something between them...
******
The group saw Crowley wave them over with a confident smile as he slipped his glasses back on. "Alright guys, you ready?" Dean asked. "Cas?" Cas sighed and let himself disappear into the ethereal plane. "Awesome. Just keep a hold of my sleeve or something, so I know you're still with us, alright? Don't let go unless it's an emergency and keep quiet." Cas rolled his eyes and followed the other two to the door where Crowley was waiting. The four of them followed the other demon into the depths of Hell.
" That's what I'm here for."
"Then what are we waiting for?" Sam asked from the entry way. "Let's build this thing." He strode across the room, his eyes red rimmed and hair a mess, and plopped down in the chair next to Aziraphale, pulling the angel's notes to him.
Sam learns the truth about Cas's deal, among other things.
"And what good is that going to do, Dean? " Sam asked. "It's not like yelling at him for something he can't control is going to make it better. There's nothing we can do."  This wasn't how this was supposed to go. Dean's reaction was expected but he needed to let Sam explain. Cas wouldn't die until he was happy. He wanted to tell Dean that they didn't need to worry until everything was over. He had a fleeting thought that he should just let Dean go at it. It would definitely keep Cas from even smiling for a while if he just let his brother tear into him, but that wasn't fair. "Besides, we've already been over this. You think I didn't scream my damn head off at him when he told me? It's not going to do a damn thing but make things between you worse!"
Cas scoffed and shook his head, a dead smile playing across his features. Sam tried to ignore it as he addressed Kaia. ‚ÄúWe need your help.‚Äù He explained.
Dean lifted a skeptical eyebrow and side eyed the demon. ‚ÄúQueen? Really?‚Äù He chuckled.
"You don't get to tell me what to do anymore." Cas snarled grabbing Dean by the arm and pulling him back in, another, weaker pulse surging through.
"Yeah, well the rest of us ain't half as badass as you." Dean smiled.
"Don't thank me just yet." Sam smiled back. " I told Garth to keep her out of the killing ranks and keep her out of trouble."
Cas stopped and drew his face away from Dean's gripping him by the hair, needing to bite his lip to keep from crying out. " Dean..." He panted, voice completely wrecked "my wings....."
Crowley was painfully aware of every micro movement in the room the second the true battle had begun. Every speck of rubble hurdling through the air, every single sound to form each and every letter in every single whispered syllable, trumpeting through his ears; every molecule of air that brushed against his skin. It was, in reality, a matter of a few minutes at most, but to Crowley those few minutes were the longest years of his life. Time creeped by, so painfully slow he was sure each fallen bit of ruble could be fossilized and rediscovered before the battle would end. Was this typical of war? Is this what it felt like to every soldier? Permanently locked in a time that barely exists, where everything is happening all at once yet, at the same time never ending? A constant state of worry, that every breath might be your last? Why would anyone choose this for themselves? For Honor? Glory?...for love??
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Aziraphale said sadly. ‚ÄúI was afraid you would say that. I fear, however, it might be our only option.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don't know how things got this bad.‚Äù Sam groaned. ‚ÄúThey were so close once. I just don't ...‚Äù
"If I'm not evil then why did the Almighty choose to toss me out with the rest of the lot?" Crowley asked.
"There are far too many souls in the veil." Billie supplies. "With Heaven running on empty and Hell more or less out of commission, they have nowhere left to go. It's only a matter of time before it rips and spills onto the earthly plane."
It wasn't.
"A bit, yeah." He replied, weakly, pulling the door closed behind them. It turned out that, once again, everything he knew about life was dead wrong.
‚ÄúI don't mean to poke the bear here darling,‚Äù Rowena said, sounding half offended, half sympathetic ‚Äúbut a witch of my caliber doesn't get spells wrong. I'm certainly not going to get one wrong when the entire world is at stake.‚Äù
*****
He was in the kitchen making lunch, when Cas came sauntering in. Dean tried his best to ignore the angel as he focused on the task at hand, but Cas wasn't having it. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat and leaned casually against the door frame  "What's cookin' good lookin'?" He smirked.
‚Äú Shit! ‚Äú Dean said, glancing at his watch. ‚ÄúHe's right. You ready for this?‚Äù
"I'm surprised he knows the meaning of family, given you were the one who taught him." John said solemnly. Dean turned to argue with his father, but stopped short when he saw the sad look on John's face. "God knows I did a pretty crappy job of teaching you."
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Sam asked ‚ÄúWhat makes you so sure it won't?‚Äù
"He's not gonna do it again." Dean said. It was weird, how protective he felt of Jack at the moment, the kid had killed his mom after all, but honestly, Mary was happy now. She was in Heaven, with his dad, she felt no more pain. He missed her of course, he always would, but there was nothing he could do. Even if he did manage to bring her back, why would he? She had everything she ever wanted now, Jack had given her that, what good would it do to tear her away from that for his own selfish wants.
Cas grabbed Gabriel's hand, allowing the archangel to pull him to his feet, confusion still swirling through his core. "Gabriel, I don't understand, how are you...?"
"Alright, alright!" Sam said stepping between the two and shutting the screen again. "Break it up. Let's just step away from the computer for now, okay? Will that make everyone happy?"
‚ÄúOkay! Alright! I'm goin! Jeez!‚Äù Dean said stepping out of the car. Even though he hated to admit it to himself, and even though Crowley was starting to touch on some seriously sensitive territory, he was actually kinda starting to really like the guy. He had a similar attitude to Dean's own, he obviously appreciated good cars and their music tastes weren't too far from each other either. It was easy to forget he was a demon. Hell, in another life, they probably could've been friends. As they walked into the bookshop, he actually felt a pang of pity for the guy. Leave it to God to kick a decent person out of Heaven.
"There's no way in hell he's going up there with those feathered dicks!"
"Yeah," Sam chuckled, still reeling from the fact that everyone seemed to know about his brother and Cas. Except them. Maybe they did for all he knew. What the fuck was happening? "Anyway, Dean gets there and buddies up with this angel and his demon.... friend, and we managed to get him back, and he just... I don't know he expects us to trust them. Like it's nothing, you know." Sam ran his hands through his hair and rested his elbows on the table.
Dean nodded in solidarity. Been there, smelled that. He decided that he kinda liked this guy. He came off as a snob (Dean assumed it was part of an act) but it was in such a crazy, charming way that it was almost impossible not to get sucked in. He gave off an air of nonchalance that could only be faked, which made Dean think that he probably actually cared too much. He could relate to that. ‚ÄúSo, let me ask you a question.‚Äù Dean said through a bite of toast.
"Werewolves?" Claire scoffed, trying her best to hide the excitement she felt about actually getting to fight.
Splits a family in two
‚ÄúI thought you said 'Cas' was a seraph.‚Äù Aziraphale said, looking like he was trying to fight back laughter of his own.
Dean's head shot up, his eyes wild with a mix of confusion and relief. "What?!"
"Not really." Aziraphale replied, shuffling notes around in front of him. "I've looked into everything from capturing demons to archangels and I'm afraid none of it seems strong enough to hold the Almighty himself. I don't even think a combination of each would be sufficient."
"What's so damn funny?" Dean demanded once there was a lull.
‚ÄúNo....‚Äù Anathema said shaking her head. Then a sly smile began to creep over her face. ‚ÄúBut we may just have the next best thing!‚Äù
"It went pretty well, then." Dean chuckled, noting the demons wide, confident smile.
Dean watched as a hint of a smile curled up at the corner of the angel's mouth. Cas three his head back and let out an exaggerated sigh. " I suppose if that is what you require of me, I have no choice but to comply."
Cas pinned down Dean's hands at his side and pulled back to a safe distance. "No. Try again."
"No way!" Siobhan half screamed "Who did Marie have to sell her soul to to get you guys here?!"
Dean couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy. Nothing worse than having your life chosen for you by circumstances beyond your control. He understands that all too well. ‚ÄúAlright, let me ask you one more.‚Äù He smiled wiping the crumbs on his pants.
‚ÄúThank you, Samuel.‚Äù She smiled before shuffling over a table and dropping the book down on top. She slid out a chair, sat down and started flipping through the pages as she spoke. ‚ÄúI was up the entire night, buried in several books, for you, since you deemed it impossible to wait until morning to look for a way we could retrieve your precious Dean.‚Äù She looked up and quirked and eyebrow at Castiel. ‚ÄúThe least you could do is have the patience to let me speak. I don't have to be doing this at all, you know. I am offering my help out of the kindness of my heart. There are more pressing matters at the present time.‚Äù
Then it grows like thunder
"Yeah, well me and Cas got plenty to talk about too. All the other shit can wait." Dean shouted back, eyes never leaving Castiel's. "This is more important."
Try to hold it steady
Kristen and Siobhan dropped Cas's hand and linked them with each other's "Yeah," Kristen says " We kind of figured as much."
Ee da de da de
Cas's face shot up to meet Dean's, his mouth a gape, his eyes wide as they searched the man's face for the lie. Knowing that there was none to be found, Dean closed his eyes, cringing against the pain when he saw the glimmer of hope in Cas's as he reached for Dean's face, preparing himself for what he knew was coming next.
Dean turned to see Cas standing with the passenger door open, arms crossed over his chest. ' Only if you carry me to bed' he thought to himself. ‚Äú No.‚Äù He shook his head and stepped out of the car. ‚Äú No, I
Castiel gave a small, sad chuckle and shook his head. "I told you, it isn't that simple, Dean."
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
"That's...really good to hear." Dean chuckled. He had no idea what he was so concerned about. These weren't fragile women by any means. They probably could hold down the cabin by themselves and ride out the end of the world right here without batting an eye.
"HOLY SHIT!" Kristen screeched  looking between Sam and Dean. "is..is he...are you...?"
"It seems now they might be worse than ever‚Ä¶."
emptiness
"I don't know Sam, maybe because there's a damn apocalypse happening right now!"
It was years ago, after returning from a 'milk run',as the boys sometimes called it, where they had decided to take Cas's Lincoln instead of the Impala because Dean had said she needed an oil change or something along those lines. He had been busy going over their notes in the library, searching for a way to remove the Mark from Dean when the hunter walked by and slapped the rectangular piece of plastic down on top of the book he was reading.
That was fast, Dean thought, as he walked over and sat down in front of the plate. ‚ÄúYou sure this is safe to eat?‚Äù He said grabbing the burger. ‚Äú I mean you're a demon, right? You might try to poison me.‚Äù
"I said I get it, Cas." He picked his own beer up and looked out over the hills. "You did a good job. You fixed Heaven. Good for you. You even got beer up here." He took a sip and shook his head. "Oh, wow." He chuckled. "Tastes like the first drink I ever shared with my dad." He looked at Cas out of the corner of his eye to see the Angel perk up slightly.
"I hope it does." Amara answered as she sifted through the plans. "For all of your sakes."
"You're sure about this?" Sam asked Amara again. She closed her eyes and nodded. "How long is it gonna take? He turned to Rowena.
"It terrifies me." He replied, too calmly. Aziraphale turned around in his arms and studied his face, a million questions hanging in the air. Crowley sighed and pressed his forehead against Aziraphale‚Äôs. "I've already told you that I don't have high expectations in this fight. We're going up against the Almighty himself. This was never going to be easy, and I never had any illusions of it being as such. War never is. It's bloody, and cruel and heartbreaking, for everyone involved. That is why it is utterly pointless to engage in, unless you have something you believe is worth fighting for. Lucky for me, I happen to be fighting for the most important thing in all of existence."
Here's a fun little chapter of giggles at Dean's expense to make up for making everybody relive the horror that is Cas's endless need for self sacrifice.
Cas and Dean both started laughing as Mary pushed away from the table. " And... I think that's my cue." She said wiping her hands on her pants.
"You still haven't answered my question." Crowley chuckled following close behind.
Also, sorry about the title of this chapter. It's stupid, I know, but I couldn't land on a good one so I used the Bi flag, cuz well, why TF not?!
And that really should've been it. Dean should've been thanking his lucky stars that he was still in one piece, let alone forgiven; that he was loved. But something Cas had said was nagging at him and he knew he could never forgive himself if he didn't ask..."almost?"
"He did?" Aziraphale asked, turning his face slightly to stare at Crowley. "I guess Sam was wrong about that then."
********
Before Sam could open his mouth to respond, Mary was between them. "Alright, that's enough you two!" she said in her best 'Mom voice'. " I've had it with your constant bickering these last couple of days. We are going to have a NICE day today, got it?" Sam and Dean both nodded. "Good. Castiel you can have the other window since your legs are longer. I'll take the middle. Now, can we please get going? Or do you guys wanna spend my last day here arguing with each other?"
"Sheesh," Sam put his hands up in surrender "sorry, I was just kidding. That was actually really nice of you."
"Beats me." Chuck shrugged. "Could've been any number of reasons. My guess? Depression. It's a hell of a disease."
*Sigh* I don't even know what I'm doing any more....
"You just waited? On the side of the road? For hours? For me?"
"I am." Jack nodded. " It's what's best for everyone. And it's not like it's goodbye, it's just...."
A quick thank you again to all of you for your continued support. Your positivity gives me hope.üòò
"Yeah." Dean nodded. He didn't want to think about what that mean. Cas would want to get back out there as soon a she gave him the all clear, and that thought scared the ever living piss out of him. It was scary as hell in the beginning, watching Cas struggle, watching him fight for his life, but once everything calmed down, it was kinda nice. Not that he'd ever admit it out loud, but he always hated it every time Cas took off without them. He was always sure that every time he saw him would be the last. Having him here, stuck in one place where Dean could keep an eye on him and make sure he didn't get himself killed....it was just...nice.
"You have got to be kidding me!" Dean groaned. He scrolled through the page, clicking back through the other websites. Sure enough, they were telling the truth. There had to be hundreds of thousands of stories online featuring him and Cas as a couple. " What the actual, fuck? What is wrong with these people?" He scrolled through a few of the stories, noting some of the 'tags' on each one. ' Fluff', 'crack', 'Smut' ' Dean's red ass' 'Top Castiel/bottom Dean'....he felt like he was gonna be sick. "Who writes crap like this about people?"
******
"Cas!" Dean screamed out, causing Amara to pause. She froze Dean in place and tilted her head to the angel breathing raggedly on the floor across the room before turning back to Dean with questioning eyes. She approached Dean slower then, letting a dark smile spread across her face. Dean kept his eyes fixed on Cas until he felt the backs of her long, warm fingers trail down the side of his face, sending an involuntary shiver through his core.
Mary smiled and pulled him into a hug. ‚Äú Just go easy on him, Dean. You mean a lot to him. He just wants to help.‚Äù Dean nodded l, hugging her back. Then Mary pulled away and held him at arm's length. ‚ÄúNow, let's go have a nice family dinner, okay?‚Äù
After a while, he let his gaze drift over to Jack and Cas. They were on one of those platforms with the arrows your supposed to step on as they scroll across the screen. Dean always thought those games were more of a way to trick people into exercise than an actual game, but it was certainly entertaining to watch. Jack was actually doing pretty decent. He only missed a couple of arrows, which was impressive considering it was his first time. Cas, on the other hand, was failing miserably. He kept stumbling over his feet, glancing back and forth between them and the screen, only able to catch a few on accident. It didn't seem to matter to him though. His face was lit up and Dean could almost hear his laughter over all the other sounds.
"Please Samuel," Rowena scoffed, " soul magic is my niche, after all. I've been extracting souls since before you're great-grand parents were soiling their nappies. A few thousand from a cosmic being should be a piece of cake." Sam leveled her with a glare for her tone. She rolled her eyes and tried again. "Yes, I can manage it."
"Cas, can we... I know you've gotta save your Powers up and all, and I can't believe I'm asking this, but I don't think I can walk through all of this man." His voice broke at the end, causing the angel to look at him with sad, sympathetic eyes.
Ten years of tension finally get released.
so...new chapter...enjoy!!!
Dean just smiled. "I've never told anyone about any of that shit. Ever. Save the panties thing, but I don't think that counts since the only other person I told that to was myself."
"I have." Cas said. " You haven't though. Not truly, anyway. You have only ever seen me as Jimmy Novak."
next up: WTF GABRIEL??? I dont even know what's going on anymore...or do I?
"Perfect for who?" She cried, tears streaking through the streams of blood.
‚Äú'fraid not, kid.‚Äù Dean shook his head. ‚ÄúThings are super dangerous there and I wouldn't want you to get hurt. I'll try my best to make it back here when it's all over.‚Äù He lied. He turned to Anathema then and smiled. ‚ÄúBe proud of making your own choices. I wish I had the same option. Being your own person is way better than having some silly old book full of the future.‚Äù She gave him a warm smile in return. ‚ÄúAnd keep an eye on the kid. He's gonna do great things when he grows up.‚Äù
enjoy.
No, no, no, no!
"We don't want him." Standing demon said. "It's the end of times. Who needs a king when the castle is falling?"
"Amara." He breathed out. It was like taking his first breath in years to hear his name from her lips again. Like a weight he hadn't know he was carrying had been lifted from his shoulders. A hole being filled that he wasn't aware was empty. He felt so utterly... whole. He hated every second of it.
Let's open us some rifts!
(See the end of the chapter for
"Cas, no." Jack choked. "That's not right! We can talk to Sam and Dean. They can figure something out. This doesn't have to‚Ä¶"
Dean smiled at her and turned on his usual charm. ‚Äú Hey, there darlin',‚Äù he winked ‚Äúhow are you doing tonight?‚Äù
"You don't want to. " Dean chuckled clapping Cas on the back. "Believe me, I've been there. It ain't fun."
Cas slammed down the half empty beer and swiveled his chair to face Dean in a lighting fast motion. He let out a thick sigh placing one hand on Dean's leg the other gripping his jaw. His azure eyes bore into Dean's and he tilted his head as he spoke. "You know, it's true what people say, about eyes being windows to the soul. That's why you can tell so much about a person, by just looking them in the eyes. You're seeing their soul. You can see the glow of joy when they feel happy, the watery river of sadness when they hurt. You can even watch the cloud of deciet cover their soul as they lie. A person's eyes are far more than optic nerves connected to colorful orbs meant to help us gaze upon God's beautiful creation. They are meant to open our souls to others so they might see our true selves. Love at first sight? Soulmates? All of it is true. All you have to do is look into someone's eyes, look into their soul, to know how truly pure and perfect they are. Do you know what I see, when I look into these eyes? These emerald jewels shining  bright in a world of darkness? I see pain, and longing and hatred and lack of self worth. But over all of that , shining past all the hurt, all the torture  you have had to endure, I see the brightest, most pure soul I have ever encountered in my entire existence. I see the most caring, most selfless creature in all of creation and I want nothing more than to take it and rip away the pain, just so I can see more of it. I want to bask in the glory of your soul's  brightness unhindered by the tainted worry of your past. Every single time I have to look away from it, even for a second, I feel nothing less than pure agony. You're eyes, you're soul, it's like a drug to me. I long for nothing more than to be near you, just to feel the glory of its presence wrap me in its warmth. I fear that once I can no longer gaze into these eyes, no longer feel the pure, stunning bliss that I feel when I am surrounded by the beauty that is your soul, then I will have nothing left worth living for. Gazing into your eyes has become my only solace in all these painful years. Without them I am nothing. And I would not have it any other way."
Dean scratched the back of his head looking around the table sheepishly. ‚ÄúWell...we kinda...uh.... bled them... I guess.‚Äù The tension between the group became palpable at that statement. ‚ÄúNot the last time!‚Äù Dean added quickly. ‚ÄúA witch friend of ours had some grace on hand after she...uh...kinda...slept with one. She used it and cast some spell and well...‚Äù Dean held his arms out and dropped them back down.
"What!?" He huffed, incredulously.
‚ÄúShe was our mom.‚Äù Sam answered walking over to the angel and placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúYou know it wasn't your fault Cas. Dean was just upset. He didn't mean...‚Äù
"Oh, definitely." Crowley agreed.
The three men walked up to the bar and sat down on the rickety  bar stools, Cas in the middle with a Winchester on each side. They had convinced him to ditch the trench coat for the night and straighten his tie. They even managed to get him to style his hair into something more  than his usual disheveled mess. He looked good. Dean waved  the barmaid over and ordered them all a beer and a few shots of whiskey. He looked over at Cas and saw the same petrified look he wore the time Dean had brought him to a brothel. He smiled at the memory , it was one of his favorites of Castiel. He never thought he could have such a good time at such a hard point in his life, but Cas made it so easy, without even trying. He was being Cas, and that was enough the lighten up Dean's  life.
"And now you've gone and fucked that up too, just like everything else!"
The nausea hit Dean as soon as they landed, but it wasn't because of Angel Express this time. The streets of Reno were littered with corpses, human and monster alike, some of which had baked for weeks under the Nevada sun. Bile rose to his throat as the smell of death seared itself into his nostrils, while he surveyed the slew of bodies around them, in various stages of decomposition. He wasn't sure what was worse; the smell or the sight of the rotting, bloated corpses being preyed upon by the various scavengers of the desert. He barely suppressed a full-on gag as he witnessed a wake of vultures feasting on a particularly mangled carcass. He felt his knees go weak beneath him from the overwhelming stench, almost losing the entire contents of his stomach before he felt Cas place two fingers to his temple, dulling his sense of smell. "Thanks." He muttered, holding onto his stomach as he glanced up at the angel, relived that at least one of the puke worthy factors was taken care of.

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Crowley said. ‚ÄúI pick Truth or Dare. ‚Äú
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞
‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù He nodded before backing away.
Rant over.
Rowena was standing in the middle of the library, dressed in purple silk pajamas with red fuzzy slippers, her hair tossed up into a bun, clutching the Book of the Damned in one arm like a teddy bear with the other hand held out in front of her ready to strike. Castiel brought his hand down slowly to his side, releasing the pressure of his middle finger from his thumb. He was sick of people getting his hopes up only to have them dashed away again. If Rowena wasn't willing to help, he was determined to find someone who would, but the threat of her making sure Dean was lost forever was enough to give him pause.
"Hmm." Cas hummed in reply, whether it was conformation, or a sound of contentment Dean could care less, as Cas rested his weary head on Dean's shoulder.
I think I saw you in my sleep.
"Cage?" Garth asked turning his head to Sam.
"Damnit, Cas!" Dean shook his head.
The click of the closing door echoed throughout the room, as Sam slumped against the sink, with nothing he could say.
The demon's snake like eyes flicked briefly to the object in Cas's hands, his face wavering a bit, before meeting the angel's. "So, I've heard." Crowley nodded. He pushed himself off the door frame with his shoulder and sauntered into the room towards the bed, plopping down on the end with a bounce. He crossed one knee over the other and spread his hands across the comforter to straighten it out. "Dean told us all about how nasty this woman is." He paused, his face twitching in though as though he was trying to decipher what he should say next. " He's quite concerned that the both of you won't be making it back alive."
"Hey! I'm plenty man!" Dean shouted, pointing his knife back at Crowley. " I'm the manliest man you've ever met!"
Crowley placed a cup of tea down in front of Sam as he moved to the other side of the table, placing his hand on Aziraphale's thigh as he sat down beside him. They had been researching the issue half the night but came up with little to no results. It was unprecedented. The only thing they could find on the matter was strictly speculation; wild hypotheses at best. He couldn't help but feel sympathy for the man in front of him, tapping away at his keyboard, his eyes sunken and tired, still wrought with determination, but anymore research was pointless. "I have no idea what you expect to find that we haven't already spent hours pouring over. It could be an irreversible side effect for all we know. You might as well give up, Sam, and let it play out as it will."
*****
The three of them sat their duffles down on their respective beds, Cas taking the couch of course, and set to shuffling through them to find their shower bags. "I'm going first!" Sam announced, pulling out his array of hair care products.
Things had been a nonstop shit storm lately. They weren't  making any progress on finding  Jack and (even though Sam  insisted  otherwise) Mary was a lost cause. To be honest, the weight  of it all was starting to get to all of them. They needed a break. Even if it was just one night of reprieve to clear their heads. That's when Dean had been struck with an idea.
Cas tried to argue again before Billie cut him off. "The kid's right." She said. " We're all going to have to fight this war together, the more souls we save, the better. We need someone who knows how much the humans can take before we need to step in."
‚ÄúJust gonna hit it and quit it then, Cas?‚Äù Dean joked ‚Äú Use me then hang me up and leave me out to dry?‚Äù
Dean crossed his arms and cocked an eyebrow at his brother. "Would you rather wait 'till we get home, where anybody could walk in and see it?"
"Oh, Jesus!" Siobhan sighed, rolling her eyes. "Leave it to Marie!"
‚ÄúYou're American, aren't you?‚Äù Adam asked, still staring at Dean‚Äôs head.
"What do you care?" Dean grunted.
‚ÄúYou put those fingers down right now, understand? Or I promise you, you will never see the Winchester boy again!‚Äù
"I know." Dean huffed in a small laugh before letting himself drift away.
"Or what?" Crowley smiled back. "You'll burn my hands off or something?"
"And no one bothered to come looking for us?!"
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Dean asked removing his hands from his face.
Sam made a face that showed he understood why and nodded. "Actually yeah, good idea. We don't wanna roll in to a place for families with a guy who looks like he belongs in an empty house with Chris Hansen."
"I already told you, I do not feel like being dishonest." Cas said, clearly  irritated
Dean had to swallow past the lump that was building in his throat. ‚ÄúYou know, for a soulless bastard, the guy can be such a sap.‚Äù
‚ÄúI figured since my name isn't Sam, I was allowed to come in.‚Äù The girl said.
"You got it Hot Wings." She winked, before turning to a couple angels behind her.
"Hi pops!" Gabriel smiled, wiggling his fingers at Chuck from where he was leaning against a wall, his large golden wings tucked neatly behind his back. " Long time, no see."
"You wanted everything!" Amara cried back, thunder booming over head as she gathered what strength she could. "You are a selfish, spoiled, little brat!" The marble started to crack beneath her feet, splitting a line all the way to Chuck's just before a bolt of lightning struck him. Chuck staggered back.
"Should hold for a few more hours without fading." She said. "You understand though, in doing this, whatever souls I take from Heaven, good souls, they will be sacrificed. Lost forever."
'Your problems always come first'
"Dean, I really don't think now is the best time to worry about something like this." Sam said with his best bitch face. "We kinda have a lot  our plates  right now and I don't think getting Cas laid should be our top priority."
‚ÄúShut it!‚Äù Crowley snapped, pulling away from the curb as soon as dean managed to click his seat belt in place.
They both turned their heads, listening to Dean's angry call somewhere deep in the bunker. "Well that sounds ominous." Crowley said, turning his gaze back to Castiel. "If I were you I'd go see what he wants. I think we both know how little patience that man harbors and after all," he smiled and leaned into Cas's space, his lips just a few inches from the angel's ear, "Hell hath no fury, like a lover scorned." He rocked back on his feet scanning Cas's face for a reaction. " I'd hate to see you stuck back in this room because you made Dean wait."
* Also:side note....please forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes made in this story. I am writing this entirely on my phone ( which is a bitch btw) and the editing app I run it through before posting, doesn't always pick up what it needs to. I have no beta to speak of ( I've said it before in other fics that my husband normally does my editing, but he won't touch my fanfics with a ten foot pole) so my writing may come off a bit sloppy. I'm sorry if that makes it difficult to read.
The next day, the hunters gathered at the bunker, each of them helping to build his funeral pyre. They had convinced the hospital that Dean wanted to be buried in a natural way, behind his home, under a tree, by his family. It was a mess of paperwork and legal arguments, but Sam managed to get his body back home. Once the pyre was finished, a few hunters, along with Sam, wrapped him up and place him on top, along with the scraps from the Impala they managed to salvage from the junk yard. An hour after they had laid him down, after each of them had said their goodbyes, they each lit a match and threw it on the pyre, sending Dean Winchester up in the Blaze of glory he deserved. Eileen held her new baby tight in one arm, and her husband's head against her shoulder with the other as they stood and tearfully watched the flames die down, long after everyone else had left.
"And? That was two days ago! Kinda hard to talk to someone when they can't even be bothered to be around you in your time of need."
Jack pulled Cas into a massive hug and turned to the guy at the counter. "I would like that guitar please, sir." He beamed.
