Anyway, I hope you're all doing well. I'm also writing a Stucky fic, so I will be alternating between this one and that one. Chapters will most likely still be posted sporadically but hopefully nothing too serious. I'm so sorry. To all of you. I love you. Thank you.
Hi everyone, I'm not sure if you guys will get this. But I decided to write an update here. Unfortunately... this story is being discontinued indefinitely. I hate that I have to do this, but I've lost passion for it. Not for writing, per-say. Just this particular story. I'll be deleting my second fic, and writing a new fic. Stucky this time.
When he came to, Cas was sliding his sweats back over his hips and clipping the little bag of medicine back to his waistband. Castiel had a dark, wet spot on his own grey sweats, which he quickly changed out of before getting back into bed with Dean, who, with Cas's assistance, rolled to his side with a quiet cry of pain and wrapped his arm around his boyfriend's waist. "Thank you, Cas." Dean murmured sleepily. Between the drugs going through his system and his completely fucked out, boneless body, Dean felt more exhausted than the last few days combined. Castiel wrapped an arm around Dean protectively and pulled a sheet up over their bodies, subtly checking Dean's wound, which was bleeding and beginning to saturate the dressings. "Dean. I need to check your wound."
Looking around, Dean firmly grasped Sam’s arm to ground himself. Sam noticed Dean’s panting and padded to the kitchen only to return seconds later with an ice cold bottle of water. “Another nightmare?” Dean could only nod as he opened the water bottle and nearly sucked down all of it’s contents. Gasping for air, he set the bottle down on his bedside table and leaned back against his headboard.
Dean nodded once in understanding, “I’m sorry… sir." He murmured. Cas released his harsh grip on his hair, and ran his fingers through it soothingly. “It’s forgiven. Now. Get back to sucking. And… use your tongue.” He murmured, a filthy wink following his request. Dean leaned down, his tongue lapping at the frenulum, right beneath the cockhead. He knew sucking, licking or rubbing the cockhead with his tongue was enough to drive Cas crazy, alone. He wondered what this might do. He wasn’t disappointed. Cas's back arched, his eyes rolled back into his head, and his hips thrusted up harshly. “Oh, right there! Dean… right there.” Dean smiled, his tongue lapping away at the sensitive spot on Cas's dick. Cas's hands rested at the back of Dean’s head, not adding pressure, they were just there. “Dean… God… Fuck, that feels so good.” Cas groaned, arching his back even more and grabbing the side of his seat. Dean rubbed his tongue against the sensitive spot a bit longer, then proceeded to put Cas's dick back where it belonged, in his throat. He sucked him down inch my inch, dragging his tongue against the sensitive vein on the underside, until his nose was nestled against Cas's shaved pelvis. His hand reached up and grabbed his heavy, no doubt aching, balls, his fingers rubbing them gently.
“Gabriel?” Sam diverted his attention to his newfound boyfriend “Uh, do you mind if I walked you out? I think I need to have a talk with my brother.” Gabriel raised his eyebrows and stood up from his comfortable position on the couch “Sure thing. I think I should probably head home, you know, so I can drill my brother in regards to your brother.” Gabriel blew a suggestive kiss towards Sam’s direction and showed himself out, peeping his head in a second later to say “Text me, Moose.” and left with a wink.
Castiel retrieved the landline phone and dialed three numbers. Dean could hear him conversing with someone about an ambulance, the pain making him dizzy and disoriented. Cas set the phone back on the receiver, kneeled down to Dean’s eye level and grabbed his hand, rubbing his thumb in gentle circles on the top of Dean’s hand as he ran fingers through his hair soothingly. “I called an ambulance, they will be here soon. Is there anything I can get you?” Cas felt tears prick his eyes as Dean rolled his face into the pillow and screamed. “Dean, sweetheart, please tell me what I can do?” He struggled to keep the tears at bay. He had never felt so helpless in his life.
As Tessa cleaned up and tossed the vials of medicine in the sharps bin with the needles and syringes Castiel cleared his throat, Dean clearly in some form of sleep. “Tessa,” Cas started, struggling to keep his composure as the night replayed through his head. Dean was so sensitive with every little touch, the needle going into his hand for the IV put him in tears. “Does this disease spread? Does it worsen?” Tessa turned and sighed, pushing the wheeled tray to the side. “Every disease worsens, unfortunately, when we don’t have proper forms of treatment or cures. With RSD it’s especially difficult since it starts from injury. The needle in his hand could cause it to spread. Seeing as he was a victim of a tragic accident… The doctor wanted to keep him overnight to manage his pain continually.” Castiel nodded once and offered the hint of a smile, his eyes diverting back to Dean as she left the room.
A few moments later, sand began flying into mini tornados as the helicopter landed. Four men jumped out with a stretcher and ran to retrieve the fallen soldier. “Alright, those bastards finally made it. You better write me every chance you get, you hear me? I want a letter everyday, some ‘Notebook’ shit.” Benny let out a strangled laugh as the men approached the scene. After they loaded Dean onto the stretcher Benny gently picked up Emily and gingerly laid her across Dean’s torso. He followed his best friend to the helicopter before quickly saying his goodbye’s “I’ll see you as soon as I get back home to Louisiana. You let me know how that leg goes. Love you, brother. Never forget that.” Dean reached out a hand and the two men held each other briefly before Dean was loaded into the MEDEVAC and taken to the hospital.
Sam returned home at around nine PM and walked into his brothers room, sitting on the bed to pet Grace, who’s tail wagged wildly as she received attention from her Uncle Sam. “So, how was you date with Castiel?” Sam smirked, looking up at Dean as he stroked Grace’s ear. “How the fuck did you know about that!?” Dean did not want Sam to know just yet. He wanted to see if it would work between he and Cas first. “Gabriel.” Sam laughed “Dude, they’re brothers. I’m sure, much like us, not much goes unsaid.” Dean rolled his eyes and went to grab a beer, Sam following.
After what felt like eternity he heard three knocks at the door followed by “Paramedics.” Castiel got up hastily and led them to Dean, he didn’t care about the evidence of their night together strewn around the room, he just needed to get Dean relief. One man set a stretcher on the bed next to Dean and held it ready as the other two men took vitals and listened to Castiel explain the problem at hand. They pulled up Dean’s hanging pant leg and assessed the damaged limb.
Cas put a hand around his arm, giving him the most intense stare Dean has ever felt. "Don't you dare... don't you dare say that to me again, Dean Winchester. You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen. Your scars... they're as if I'm looking at a perfect piece of artwork." Dean looked back at Cas and could swear he saw tears glisten in his eyes. Cas reached out and very gently traced his fingertips along the burns, causing Dean to shudder as his fingers made they're way down his spine. "Why would you ask a wolf to hide in sheep's clothing? Or a tiger to rid of his stripes?" Cas murmured. "You wouldn't..." Dean responded as Cas kissed his shoulder blade. "Precisely." He murmured, his breath raising goosebumps against Dean's skin.
Once Dean finished drying off he wrapped the towel around his waist, grabbed his crutches and hobbled back to his bedroom, Grace following next to him. Stopping at his dresser in front of his bed, equipped with a television and cable box, Dean picked up his watch, slipped it on and began to pull out a pair of jeans, boxers, socks and an ACDC t-shirt.  He pulled the towel from around his waist and tossed it into the hamper next to his dresser.
I hope you're all doing well. I think about you guys often and hope your dreams, ambitions and wishes come true everyday. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
Immediately, Dean felt the bolus of pain medicine kick in. It didn’t feel like a pain pill does when it kicks in, he just felt the pain dull and his body relax. He felt a slight haze but nothing major. He almost felt perfect. “It’s just funny is all,” Dean began, laughing again as he felt the warmth of relaxation flood his body “You’re a vet but I would think you were actually a doctor if you didn’t patch Gracie up.” Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, a warm, loving look in his gaze “Well. I don’t think it counts, but I actually was going to be a Doctor. I was 2 years into Medical School. I changed my mind when I accidentally hit an Australian Shepherd on my drive home from school one night…” Cas trailed off, as if he were thinking back to that very moment. “He made it. I promised him I would devote my life to saving animals just like him. It was my fault he almost died. I will never forgive myself for that.” Cas sighed, his eyes misty with tears he refused to let fall.
Dean picked up his menu, opened it and began his decision. “So, what did you want to get together for?” Dean inquired after he made his decision on the cheeseburger and fries. Castiel cocked his head to the side like a bird and looked at him with confusion in his eyes “I thought I told you last night?” Dean didn’t respond, he couldn't tell him how drunk he was from both alcohol and his orgasm. He licked his lips and suddenly became preoccupied with his coffee.
Just then, the doctor came into his bay. "Lance Corporal Winchester, my name is Doctor Freely. I work in the trauma and ICU ward. Do you remember what happened?" The doctor quickly checked his chart as the nurse pushed pain medicine into his IV, hurrying off to get a bag of morphine for an IV drip. Dean shook his head slightly , memories slowly coming back to him. "I... I was patrolling a compound just outside the wire at Barioli Base. My MWD and I accidentally detonated an IED." The doctor nodded gravely "Good. Very good. Unfortunately... Mr. Winchester, I have some bad news." Dread's icy fingers grasped Dean's heart, he could feel his body grow cold. "You see, Dean. The way your leg was injured.. it was beyond repair." The doctor side, moving to look Dean in the eye "I'm afraid we had to amputate the limb from the knee down."
Dean didn’t know if it was the physical pain, emotional pain, loneliness or his PTSD that drove him to drink but it seemed that, no matter how much he drank, nothing would drive the pain away. Dean thought back to that day. Remembering little details he should have picked up. Such as the way the ground looked at the threshold of the doorway of the room he and Emily stepped into. How the dirt seemed different than the rest of the ground. And, Benny… the asshole promised he would write him everyday; Dean certainly wrote him. But, no matter how much he wrote, Benny never responded.
Dean chuckled and turned the lights on "Alright, you two. Break it up. Sam, you have class in the morning." The two bodies quickly sat up from their positions on the couch,, lips swollen and hair mussed and that's when he realized it was a man Sam was with. Dean didn't think Sam was into men, but as a bisexual man himself... he didn't much care. "Uh... Sam? Who is this?" The last Dean knew, Sam was all about some chick named Jessica.
Dean looked at him, his hand still on Cas’s bare chest. He made to sit up, Cas helped him as best he could, Grace’s head sliding off of his body and plopping on the bed; she didn’t move a muscle. Once he was in the position he wanted to be in, he leaned in and gently pressed his lips against Cas’s, Cas closed his eyes and returned the favor, his body leaning into Dean’s ever so slightly.
Castiel laid back down on his belly and opened his mouth, slid Dean's cock all the way down and swallowed around it in one, smooth, swift movement. Dean almost passed out from such intense pleasure and Castiel reached up to put two fingers in Dean's mouth. Dean closed his mouth around them and sucked, drooling as he rubbed the pads of Cas's fingertips with the flesh of his tongue. Castiel groaned around Dean's dick, gyrating his hips against the mattress. Castiel quickly removed his arm from Dean's pelvis so he could pull his own hard, aching, leaking cock from his sweat pants. His eyes fluttered shut when his dick sprung free and layed heavily between his warm body and the cool sheets, he removed his fingers out of Dean's mouth and pulled his mouth free from Dean's cock once more.
Castiel, looking aimlessly through a gossip magazine, sighed and closed the audaciously written article about whatever celebrity was wearing in the streets of LA whilst grocery shopping. Sighing, he tossed the magazine to the side table next to his chair and noticed Dean's stature. Worry immediately flushed Cas's senses. He gently touched Dean's shoulder, unsure if he was suffering from flashbacks or a pain flare, “Are you alright, Dean?” Cas's voice was at least one octave lower than it normally is, to spare the other patients in the waiting room from hearing in on their conversation.
Dean whined slightly before taking a deep breath. "Yes, sir." He muttered, his words slurring from the drugs being pumped into his body at that very moment. "Good boy. Don't move." Cas whispered, gently pulling Dean's pants and boxers down and off of his body. "If it feels too good you can grip my hand as hard as you'd like. I promise you won't break me." Castiel reached up and thread his fingers with Dean's right after he gave him the permission to do so. Cas then dropped his head down and licked languorously from the base of Dean's  balls to the tip of his thick, hard cock in one, broad, long drag of his tongue. Dean gasped audibly, his eyes rolling back slightly and fluttering closed. Cas scooted up and wrapped his left hand around the base of Dean's dick, he licked his lips once in preparation and, finally, parted them just enough to fit the swollen tip of Dean's gorgeous cock between them. Dean sighed out a broken whimper and  reached a bandaged hand down to curl cold fingers into dark hair. Castiel glanced up before closing his eyes, slowly pushing his mouth downwards and hollowing his cheeks out. "Oh. Fuck. Castiel." Dean felt tears spring to his eyes, he wanted to fuck that mouth so badly but he promised Cas, and he won't go breaking promises.
“Why didn’t you tell me!?” Sam demanded, “Why didn’t you call or- or text!?” Sam crossed his arms and gave his brother the look; the look that said Dean was in deep shit. Dean rolled his eyes, set his beer down and faced his brother. “Because it was hard on me, Sam! It still is!” Dean challenged back, his voice deeper and louder than his brothers. “You have no idea what that dog means to me!” Dean snatched his beer up, drained it of the rest of its contents, tossed the empty bottle into the trash and went to his bedroom just as his phone began to ring.
Dean went to his room and closed the door behind him. He smiled like an idiot the entire time he got ready for bed. That night, instead of nightmares, he dreamed of Cas.
“So, how was it?” Dean twisted the cap off and tossed it in the trash can. After he took a drink he looked at his brother “I really like him Sammy. He makes me happy, he makes me feel things I haven’t felt before.” Sam smiled warmly at his brother. “I’m glad, man. You need someone who can do that for you, Dean. You deserve so much. It’s about time you get it.” Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Well, before we both grow boobs and a uterus I’m going to bed.” Sam explained he needed to study anyway and, with that, they bid each other good night.
Castiel then began to assess the injury. Going to the cabinet, he pulled out a sheet of paper, wrote something on it and set it next to Dean's dog, referring his attention back to his client. "Here's the plan. She will definitely get to keep her foot but it does look deep. Bone deep. We'll have to put her under sedation, take a quick x-ray, remove the shard, stitch the wound up and apply a soft cast." The Doctor offered a warm smile, causing Dean's heart to stop at the sight of it. In all his life, no one has ever managed to make Dean Winchester that flustered. "So..." he cleared his throat and processed what he had just heard "You won't have to cut off anything? She keeps her paw?"
Dean looked around anxiously, his eyes wide and pupils dilated from fear. “Dean, Dean… Stop. Stop fighting. You’re okay. Dean.” Dean looked at Cas’s face above him, “Cas, what happened? I-I was awake and… Cas what happened?” Dean felt his voice break as tears spilled down his face. He choked out a sob, “I don’t know what’s real anymore, Castiel.”
Also, I need to apologize. I'm so sorry I went MIA these past few days. I have medical issues and needed time to recuperate. I can say I am back to hopefully finish this story, so I hope you guys haven't given up on me yet!
An hour passed and, while Grace was jogging back to Dean, tongue hanging out as she panted heavily, she yelped loudly and stumbled to the ground. Dean immediately ran to his companions side. As his eyes scanned for any injury he noticed blood soaking the golden fur on her left paw. Upon further inspection, he noticed a massive shard of glass stuck in her paw and up into the back of her ankle, as blood slowly poured out of her paw. It looked as if it were hitting the bone.
Dean hadn’t realized his eyes were cast downward. He looked up at Castiel to see a look of pure sadness. “Oh, Dean….” Cas murmured gently “I’m so sorry.” Dean nodded once and continued “My dad… he was a shit father. Always screaming at me and Sam. Always… I would usually be the brunt of his anger when he came home drunk, because it was either me or mom and Sam. God forbid he lay a hand on mom.” Dean grit his teeth slightly at the thought of John Winchester. He cleared his throat and shook his head “Whatever. Anyway, what about you? What’s your story?”
Cas leaned forward and opened his drawer again. Dean could hear the sound of a little foil packet and the drawer closing as Cas leaned back on his knees, ripped open the foil and rolled the condom on his length. Dean reached down stroked his wet cock, rolling his hips up into his hand. Cas yanked his wrist away and pinned both hands above his head. "Don't you dare touch yourself." He murmured, holding Dean's arms securely above his head. "I want you to come only on my dick. Can you do that?" Dean nodded, his cock twitching at Cas's sudden domination.
Dean left them with a quick "Bye Bitch, Bye Jerk" between each other and a kiss on Grace's head. Once the door was locked behind him he made his way down to the lobby via escalator and, sure enough, Cas stood at the passenger side of his car, a cherry red mustang, waiting for Dean and looking practically lickable. He wore dark jeans, a black t-shirt and a burgundy leather jacket. Dean practically drooled as he hobbled to his boyfriend. They kissed each other quickly before Cas opened the door for Dean, who slid into the passenger seat.
Not that Dean would get anywhere. He was probably already taken... even though Dean didn't see a ring on the Veterinarians long ring finger.
Cas smiled warmly for the first time all night, “I would like that very much, Tessa, thank you.” He decided he would have Dean’s brother bring him a bag of comfortable clothing and would call his doorman to have his door locked in a few hours. For now, he followed Tessa up to the admitting floor and helped her put Dean in the fresh hospital bed in the rather large and accommodating suite.
They both put each other’s personal numbers in their phones and Dean headed out, but stopped at the doorway once more. “Text me the details,” He stated simply, “I mean, what breed of dog you’re looking for, her age, what tasks she needs, etc. And we can go from there. Should you want a Golden like ol' Gracie girl, here, I’ll contact her breeder for you. She shows and titles all of her dogs, as well as health tests breeding parents and temperament tests the litters. ‘Sides. You can’t go wrong with a Golden.” Dean left with a wink, his fingers interlaced in Cas's.
Dean swallowed, unable to process the information. He pulled the blanket back, noticing burns on his arms as he did so, and went pale at the site of his stump of a leg. "Where's my dog?" He murmured, staring at his stitched limb in complete and utter shock "Where's Emily?" Dean slowly pulled the blanket back over himself, his face growing hot as tears filled his eyes. The doctor sighed sadly "Emily made it, but she is waiting to be adopted by another veteran. Dean, you know you cannot adopt the dog you work with. It's against military policy."
Dean smiled and bit Cas's clothed shoulder gently. Kissing his way up Castiel's neck, Dean whispered "Make love to me, Cas. Please." And that was all it took. Castiel swiftly pulled his t-shirt off, followed by his pants, boxers and socks. His clothes fell to a pile on the floor as he reached into his nightstand drawer and pulled out a bottle of astroglide.
"Okay girl. Ready?" Dean threw the ball and the dog bolted to after it. Jumping, she caught it midair and brought it back to Dean. He chuckled and clapped at her stunt as she dropped the ball at his feet "That's my girl!"
Hey Guys, I am so very sorry but life had me by the short and curlies for a bit there. I apologize for taking for what seems like eternity to upload this chapter. I do hope you enjoy it and know there is in fact more coming after this, I will try not to take forever to upload the next one.
Cas then released Dean's hands and kisses him softly. "That's my good boy..." He murmured gently. Dean keened at his praise, quickly becoming drunk off of it. He wanted more and knew he would do anything to get it. Castiel flicked open the top on the bottle of lube, squeezed a generous helping on his cock and spread it around his length. He reached over, grabbed a pillow and lifted Dean's hips with one hand effortlessly. Once the pillow was shoved beneath Dean's rear Cas lined his head up to Dean's hole. "Are you ready, baby?" He murmured, blue eyes met green eyes, the ocean meeting the earth, and Dean nodded reluctantly in response. "Dean..." Cas rubbed his stump gently "Sweetheart, you have to communicate with me." Dean cleared his throat and nodded. "Yes, I'm ready. Please... just do it."
Once the driver arrived to the clinic, a large brick building with big white letters on the front spelling "ANIMAL HOSPITAL", Dean handed the driver 95 dollars and gently eased his way out of the Taxi with his dog in his arms. Blood dribbling a trail behind him, he entered the clinic and walked up to the front desk, interrupting a client's conversation with one of the vet techs stabding behind the front desk.
Cas smiled slightly and continued eating around his words “Well, I’m not perfect. Putting them down is the hardest on me. I grieve for weeks since some of them I’ve treated since they were kittens and puppies. However, it’s gratifying to help them. To ease their pain and suffering.” Dean could see how passionate Cas was about his career and it truly made him happy. For the first time in six years, Dean genuinely felt happy.
Sam nodded in understanding and dropped the subject. "Any plans for the day?" he inquired as he got up for another serving. Dean glanced down at Grace who was laid out under his seat in what was known as a 'tuck'. Service Dogs were trained to do it on impulse in order to stay out of the way. "Yeah, I was thinkin' I could take Gracie, here,  out on her well deserved outing to the park. Girl's been workin' herself stiff. She could use some Me Time." Dean explained as he got up and limped to the sink to clean the dishes.
Dean awoke sometime later to something warm, wet and smelling like kibble licking his face. When he opened his eyes and focused them on what it was, he reached up and felt soft, silky fur under his fingers. "Gracie," Dean murmured, wrapping his arms around his dogs body and hugging her close. He could hear familiar voices too. Bobby, Sam, Gabriel and Ellen. He looked around the room, still very much out of it, and smiled. "Hey guys," he croaked out, his throat dry and sore from the medicine.  Everyone turned around to face him, warm smiles on the faces "Look who's up." Ellen announced, walking to Dean's bedside and reaching down to hug him. Dean leaned into her hug, his nose filling with the smell of home. "It's so good to see you, Honey." Ellen murmured. "It's about time!" Sam said, a huge smile on his face. Dean smirked and murmured "bitch" under his breath. Sam chuckled and hugged his brother, "I missed you, jerk. The apartment's been so weird without you." Before Dean could say anything Bobby hugged him next. Bobby was the closes thing Dean had to a father, especially when he came back broken from Afghanistan. "Its good to see you're okay, son." Bobby said as he pulled away. Grace lay across Dean's lap, her service dog vest on her body. Castiel stood on the left of Dean, giving him space to spend with his family. Gabriel stood next to him, both brothers having their own quiet conversation with each other.
Castiel chuckled, nodding his head slightly "Yes, Dean. Gracie here will live comfortably- with all four paws attached." He patted the man on his back and opened the door to the exam room "Meg will see to your paperwork. Grace will have to stay overnight as we're about to close and we are putting her under anesthesia." Castiel explained, leading Dean out of the exam room as two vet techs went inside to remove Grace to the back room.
Once Dean finished cleaning up he shut the water off, stood up and carefully hopped back out of the walk-in shower. He looked around and swore under his breath when he realized he had forgotten his towel. “Grace!” he called as he leaned against the wall next to him with his left arm in order to help support his body weight, since he no longer had a leg to do it for him. The dog came rushing into the bathroom and sat in front of her master, looking him in the eye expectantly. “Towel, please.” Dean commanded. The dog stood up and swiftly made for the linen closet in the bathroom, spacious for a two bedroom apartment. She pulled down on the paracord braid hanging from the door, causing it to open, and pulled out a towel. Bringing the towel straight back to Dean, Grace quickly returned to the linen closet and pushing the door closed with her nose.
After taking a few swigs of his beer, Sam walked over to the couch and sat next to Grace, who was knocked out from her pain medicine. Sam gently stroked her ear as he always did. Dean liked to think it was a way to relax him. "Have you seen Castiel today? How is he?" Sam inquired as he struggled to watch his brothers favorite show. Dean took a sip of his whiskey before responding "I'm actually going out with him in a couple hours. We're going over to Charlie's bar then.... then I'm going back to his place for the night." Dean took another sip of his whiskey while Sam choked on his beer.
Dishes cleaned and Sam off to the library, Dean sat comfortably on the couch, checking the weather, when he looked down at Grace who was lying at his feet, busy chewing on a toy. “Feel like going to the park?” Once Dean muttered the word ‘park', the dog got up and began dancing excitedly. Dean chuckled and got up to retrieve her leash, whistling for her to come to him so he could clasp her leash on her collar. "You know..." he began as he clasped the leash onto the animals collar "You're a retriever. Retrieving things is your job." Dean laughed quietly and rolled his eyes as he stood up.
Cas’s phone alarm went off, causing Dean to jump out of his brain and come back to the present. Dean heard Cas sigh, as he normally did upon waking up every morning. He heard him stretch out in their massive king-sized bed, he heard him reach over to the nightstand to drink some of his bedside water and grab his phone. But, for some reason, Dean couldn’t let him know he was awake.
Dean and Emily worked through a few obedience commands to sharpen her skills before gearing her up. He packed up the essentials, picked up his gun and met with his patrol team. He was pleased to see Benny would be accompanying him today. “We all set, brother?” the burly man asked. Benny was pure muscle standing at six feet tall. Dean pitied anyone who stood in his way. He nodded in answer and made way to the front of the line. Sergeant Eliot Ness instructed him of his tasks and ordered everyone to begin moving.
Once the elevator dinged and the doors slid opened, he pulled his keys out from his back pocket and walked three doors down to his and Sam's shared apartment. Unlocking the doors, he walked in and found Sam... on the couch... making out with some stranger under soft lamplight like two horny teenagers.
In that moment, watching Cas- watching his boyfriend- remove his limb and place it on the floor beside the bed, rub his stump and kiss his sore thigh... Dean felt loved. Tears filled Dean's eyes and rolled down his cheeks. "Cas...?" His voice cracked, giving away his tears. Castiel's blue eyes shot up to Dean's face, sitting up quickly with a look of concern on his own features. "Dean! What's wrong? What's happened? Are you hurt?" Dean choked out a laugh, shaking his head. "No, you idiot. I'm happy." He wiped his tears away only for more to follow. "I've never... I love you, Cas." He pulled the man against his broken body and buried his nose into his shirt. "I love you like I've never loved anyone." Cas wrapped his arms around Dean warmly, tightly; as if Dean would be ripped away from him at any moment. "Oh, Dean..." Cas murmured, kissing his neck. "I love you more."
Dean’s hands started shaking, so he rubbed them up and down his thighs in an attempt to hide his anxiety. Grace noticed his anxious tics, and swiftly approached Dean, the metal on her equipment tinkling as she walked, her leash yanking out of Cas's hands and dragging behind her. She put her two front paws on the foot rest attached to the exam bed and nudged at Dean's hands to both alert him to his anxiety attack and stop him from having a full blown panic attack. Cas watched as Dean subconsciously ignored the dog, yet she persisted. Finally, after a couple minutes of nudging, Dean finally stopped and buried his hands in her thick mane around her neck. “She really loves you, Dean,” Cas murmured, his voice shaking slightly, “She truly does care for you. Just like I do.” Cas's eyes never leaving Dean's face, “I hope you realized how much I’m willing to do for you, in a heartbeat. What I would give for you to just… be open with me.”
“I understand.” Dr. Sands began, smiling warmly. “Dean. Don’t ever feel like you can’t tell me how you’re feeling. Okay? That’s what I’m here for. If you want to stay on oral pain medications, that’s more than feasible and acceptable. I know this surgery, alone, was difficult for you to get through. Don’t worry.” Doctor Sands truly had such a gentle, calming voice, “You are the patient, here. You’re in control.” Dean relaxed audibly, releasing a breath he hadn’t realized he held. “Now, lift your shirt up for me.” Dean did as he was told and gripped the edge if the bed harshly. Cas got up and gripped his hand. “Squeeze my hand however hard you need to, baby. I’m right here.”
“What’s this?” Dean looked at Cas suspiciously, “Cas, you really need to stop spoiling me.” Cas rolled his eyes as he sat on the cushioned chair next to Dean, “It’s nothing Dean, just open it. I figured you and Grace would both equally like it.” Dean sighed and rolled his eyes playfully. However, he couldn’t hide the smile on his face, no matter how hard he tried. He put the box on his lap and encouraged Grace to “help” rip the wrapping paper off, which was decorated with bones, dog toys, paw prints and leashes and collar sets. Once the paper was removed, Grace sat obediently in front of Dean, almost as if she wanted to see her present as much as Dean did.
“I mean,” Sam said, “I guess it wasn’t just any one thing. You lowkey flirt with anyone you think is good looking, regardless of gender, I guess that was a big one. Then a couple of years ago you started blatantly checking men out as often as you did women.” He shrugged, “it seemed really obvious?”
Cas frowned (sadly?) and pulled at his borrowed flannel shirt. “These I’m wearing will suit me fine. I don’t need more.”
Sam entered the kitchen not long after, and Dean waved him quiet when it looked like he was going to speak. He titled his head toward the competitors, and Sam joined him in watching the silent show.
Cas furrowed his brow for half a second before Dean’s meaning hit him. Dean watched him check his internal clock. “I’m fine too.”
“Dude, where have you been this week? He’s been tripping over himself to make you comfortable, he has no sense of personal space when it comes to you anymore, and let’s not even talk about the soppy grins he gives you.”
“Yeah, of course. Just tired, I guess. And thinking about what to do with all these people we suddenly have in our home.”
All around them, people cheered as Cas and Dean wrapped their arms around each other and began swaying to the music. Embarrassment flushed Dean’s cheeks a bright red and made his movement stiff and jerky, but that didn’t keep the grin from forming on his lips.
“Cas and Dean are each other’s lights in the darkness,” he said, “and watching them fight for their love and their lives together, I have never been prouder to call them my fathers.”
I hope everyone liked the first chapter, this is one of my lesser favourite chapters because I found some of the interactions, especially in the beginning, a bit awkward. But I think the chapters get better as they go on so please keep with me :) Also this Cas is sort of a mix between sassy 2014 Cas and regular angel Cas. It'll make more sense as to why in this chapter.
“I suppose we should just be grateful that they didn’t make us wear cowboy boots,” Sam muttered, clearly thinking the exact same thing as her, and Mary laughed. She probably wouldn’t have minded that, though… she looked
Dean felt flushed and nervous as Linda passed him the microphone. He’d had everyone’s eyes on him all day, and that had been bad enough, but this time felt different. Because now it was time for his speech, and speaking from the heart wasn’t always something Dean was good with. And he didn’t think he’d ever so much as
“But I mean it, I’m glad to be here with you now, Cas,” Dean admitted, his eyes tracing the smile on his husband’s lips. “I’m glad that we’re celebrating this, that we’re doing it the right way. I’m glad to have you by my side, and in my arms, and tell you all the sappy shit I’ve always wanted to. Like…” Dean had to pause to take a deep breath, feeling his emotions begin to claw at his throat. But he wanted to say this. He wanted to say it all. So, he just cleared his throat and continued. “Like how I’ve been in love with you for so long, that I don’t even remember what
Another thing that had changed was that he wasn’t speaking to Sam, for obvious reasons. He was actually staying solely in Cas’ safe house for the time being. He’d explored a little while but it was just a standard house, which was weird as hell considering it was inside of an abandoned factory building. He’d eventually come across a notebook filled with what looked to be Cas’ notes on the Apocalypse.
Charlie could understand that. Dean and Cas might have had one of the shortest engagements in history, but it probably felt like much longer to them, considering how long they’d been dancing around each other and their feelings. Charlie was going to say as such, but she was cut off by a short tap on the door. They both turned to look that way as Sam came in and closed it behind him.
This time, however, the sauce actually tasted pretty good. Dean nodded his approval. He supposed he shouldn’t be surprised; Cas always was a quick learner. He said as much and saw the way that his husband beamed with pride, his grin contagious.
“You know, when I proposed to Cas, we weren’t exactly looking at going the whole big family wedding and reception kind of route. But none of you would let us run off to elope in Vegas in front of an Elvis impersonator, so here we are.” That joke had the added bonus of being 100% true.
, he loved his man so much, more and more every day. They’d been married now for two months. Two months and counting, and Dean was so happy to spend the rest of their lives together.
There is also an impression given that Dean was going to get tortured in his hallucination, but nothing gory was written.
Thankfully, before either of them could make eye contact with Mary and drag her into this, Linda appeared and was quickly putting everyone into order. Mary was placed at the front of the queue besides Bobby – Apocalypse World Bobby, that is.
Cas wrapped his fingers around Dean's hand that was still putting pressure on his wound and then pulled it away and just held it. His blue eyes glanced over Dean's shoulder towards Sam.
“I told him to do that,” Claire boasted once she was done laughing, and then she high-fived Charlie.
So this is my newest multichapter destiel fic, I hope you enjoy it. I have about 11 chapters prewritten and plans for the next fifteen; I'm really not sure how long this fic will be but it'll definitely be my longest yet. If I had to guess then I'd say about 30 chapters long.
Ellen responded by batting at his arm and rolling her eyes. Ash shrugged and continued eating. He couldn’t help but think about how that’s what everyone kept saying about them today, though. That they were happy. Maybe that was just the norm for a wedding – Ash wouldn’t know, he hadn’t been to any before – or maybe it was just because
So, three years later and I’m finally back. I want to apologise but I’m not going to write a big explanation because it makes no difference anyway. So, sorry!
That was why the demon blood was so important to the plan. He needed to be strong, strong enough to kill even her, in order to secure them their victory in the war against the angels. And his soul needed to be damaged and his will weakened enough that he would say yes and let the dark lord into his body. But they were running out of time and they needed to act quickly to ensure that happened.
Charlie smiled and nodded. “Yeah.” She was alright; she was. Because besides the inkling of jealousy she felt settling in her chest, there was also a calmness to it all. In a way, it was kind of like a reassurance that, if she ever wanted to actually try for the whole settling-down thing, she could. “How are you doing?” she asked. “Nervous?”
"Yeah, you should have," he agreed and then dipped back down to kiss the angel again. Cas got lost in the moment with Dean. He'd been worried about how the hunter would take the news ever since they had started sleeping together and it was a relief to now be entirely sure that Dean wouldn't hold his lies against him. He was mesmerised by Dean's tongue brushing against his own and making him moan lightly, so mesmerised that he didn't notice Sam waking up in the other room. So mesmerised that he didn't hear the younger Winchesters footsteps until it was too late.
“I, Dean, take you, Cas, to be my husband, my best friend, and the love of my life.” The ring was already on now, but Dean kept holding Cas’ hand as he listed off the memorised vows. “In front of our friends and family, I vow to be your faithful partner in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad, and in joy as well as in sorrow. I promise to love you unconditionally, to support you in your goals, to honour and respect you, to laugh with you and cry with you, and to cherish you for as long as we live.”
Rage filled Dean, then. He started pushing the blanket back and grabbed for his crutches before the doctor pushed him forcefully back against the bed. "NURSE!" the doctor yelled as Dean fought against him "Let me go! I'm getting my fucking dog!" Dean shouted, pushing the doctor away and once again trying to get out of bed. "NURSE! PROPOFOL!" The nurse immediately ran to Dean's bed with a syringe loaded with medication. The doctor quickly pushed it into Dean's IV and his body instantly went limp.
There is no smut in this chapter, however Cas and Dean do go on a date.... of sorts.... and talk about things. We'll see where it goes from here. Once again, I am so eternally grateful for all of you who are reading this story and cannot wait to see what's in store!
Dean groaned when Cas finally stopped, his body boneless and covered in a thin sheen of sweat against the leather driver’s seat. He head Dean against him, which only caused Dean to suckle at Cas's slowly softening cock. Cas moaned softly at first, but he grew sensitive quickly and gently pulled Dean off. Dean sat up, wincing slightly at his aching jaw, and even more so aching back. His lips shiny with come and saliva, swollen and bright cherry red. His eyes glazed over, his chest heaving and bright red, as were his cheeks. “Stay still. Don’t move.” Cas instructed. He pulled out his phone and quickly snapped a picture of Dean. “What the hell?” Dean asked, obviously confused. “You look so beautiful, Dean. I had to take a photo. I’m sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I’ll delete it. If you want?” Dean laughed and shook his head, but deep down, his heart swelled. Cas really, truly thought the world of him. “No. It’s okay. I get it. We all have a spank bank.” Dean leaned over and gently kissed Cas, no tongues, no fight for domination, just... a loving, gently, sweet kiss. "I love you, so much Cas..." He murmured softly against Cas's lips. When he pulled back, he palmed at the erection bulging in his jeans, groaning lowly. He wanted to do more, but his spine seriously ached now, and the pharmacy wasn’t open forever.
Dean hadn't realized they arrived at their destination, nor had he realized Cas parked and took his seatbelt off to better position himself. He was focused on Cas, the way he tasted, his perfect, huge cock in his mouth and the beautiful sounds he made... sounds that caused his own dick to twitch in response. He had Cas all the way down to the hilt nowpp and Cas began to make fast, little thrusts into his mouth. His breathing began to become erratic, his hand pulling on Dean's hair. "Dean... I'm close." Cas's body began to tense and Dean could feel his balls draw up against his chin. "Dean, baby. I'm gonna come." Dean didn't move, he just sucked harder and breathed through his nose.
The kiss wasn’t needy, lustful, or passionate. Instead, it was almost apologetic. “I love you,” Dean wanted to scream, “I love you more than you know, I just don’t know how to say it.” Cas understood, he knew what Dean was trying to say without asking. He always knew. He just hoped Dean knew how much he meant to Cas.
What felt like an eternity later, Cas removed his mouth from Dean's sensitive buds, kissing and licking down to his navel he sat up and quickly unbuttoned Dean's jeans, unzipped his fly and hooked his fingers beneath the waistband of Dean's pants. Dean lifted his hips in order to give Cas room to pull his pants off, boxers coming off along with them followed by his socks. Dean's cock twitched against his belly as Cas tossed his clothing to the floor.
About five minutes into their drive to the bar, Dean reached over and undid Cas's fly. "Dean, what are you-" Dean quickly pulled out Cas's growing erection and gently  drug his tongue from the base to the head before parting his lips and putting the half soft cock in his mouth and giving it a hard suck. Cas accidentally pushed his foot down on the gas pedal, jolting the car forward as Dean began sucking him. "Fuck, Dean." He groaned, putting a hand on the back of his head and tangling his fingers in his hair.
Castiel leaned down and gently pressed warm, chapped lips to Dean's. He brought his hand up to cup the back of Dean's head, his long, tan  fingers tangling in blonde hair. Dean moved to roll to his side but Castiel had him pinned. Cas kissed Dean's bottom lip, pulling it between his lips to suck at it gently before releasing and  kissing it once more. "No moving, Dean. You cannot dislodge that catheter in your spine. Can you stay still for me?" The words came out in a breathy murmur and Dean nods once more. Castiel moves his way down between Dean's thighs, resting his head against his good  thigh. Dean whined, thrusting his hips ever so slightly, careful not to move his body. Castiel looks up at him and places his hand gently over Dean's erection. "Listen carefully Dean. I cannot have sex with you at this very moment, but I will make love to you. I'll have to be very careful, okay? As will you. Please do not arch your back, no matter how good this feels. It could cause serious damage if you do." Cas warned, his voice firm but gentle, "We do not want your spinal fluid to leak even more than it already is. Do you understand?" Dean nods once. "I do not want you to thrust harshly, no thrashing your body around either. You have to stay very still for me, Dean. Can you do that?" Cas asked again, he just wanted to make sure Dean understood the severity of the situation.
“So, what are you saying? That we should just keep the bond, since we’re ‘made for each other’? That we shouldn’t even try to find a way to break it? I can’t do that to him, Bobby. He’d be stuck with me for the rest of my life. And that’s not even getting into the supposed romantic effects that we might not know about. This is basically a marriage contract, and Cas said only angels who truly want to be together forever even attempt it. What if there’s another angel he’s meant to actually bond with? I’d be depriving him of that.”
He jogged to the kitchen, grabbed the sugar, and looked for the milk, only to remember he’d used the last of it on the pancakes. Frowning at the powdered creamer that was God knows how old, he had a flash of brilliance and dug out a packet of cocoa mix he’d bought last week. Sugar, milk, chocolate, and tiny marshmallows should help with the bitter coffee flavor. Then he decided, fuck it, and dug out two more packets, then headed back to the library.
Cas inclined his head in a brief nod. “I am sorry to say so, but yes. Dean said your mother is missing?”
“Wait. So if the bond is permanent, does that mean I can’t die? If I’ve got angel mojo coursing through these veins, does that make me invincible? Will I age? What if I age but never die? Do I keep getting more and more wrinkled and tiny, but never die? Ew no, please tell me I won’t live forever.” He looked pleadingly at his brother.
Sam’s eyes were wide. “Um, well, I can’t say for sure on the living forever part. It’s complete conjecture, but yeah, you’ll be faster and stronger, so you definitely won’t get hurt as easily.”
Dean barked a laugh and slung an arm around Cas’s shoulders. “You’re learning, man, you’re learning.” He led them out the door and down the hall to the kitchen. “Okay, the coffeemaker is calling my name.”
Before he could try something else, his phone vibrated. The timer he’d set for the pie was going off. “Oh, I gotta go get the pie out of the oven. I’ll be right back.” He nudged Cas’s hand with his own before heading down the hall. “I think I saw the bookshelves in the next room, if y’all want to go look for them.”
“I’ve told you, angel, the number of layers you insist on wearing is ridiculous. That can’t be comfortable. How many years have you been wearing the same outfit now?”
“Wait, did Sam teach you about the cinnamon? I thought maybe we had better coffee than what you can get at a Gas-N-Sip, because it’s tasted great, but now that I think about it, I was tasting cinnamon.”
Dean and Charlie were standing side-by-side at the worktop, laying out the meats and cheeses (yes, they had multiple types of each), when she finally asked the question Dean had been anticipating all morning.
“Just … give it time,” Dean finally said. “Once you’re here for longer, you’ll see how nice this is. Maybe- You know what? You need a new mattress. That makes all the difference. Yours is hard as stone, no wonder you can’t get comfortable. I’ll get one for you next time I’m in town. You’ll love it.” Dean kept prattling on. He knew it wasn’t helping, but he couldn’t stop. There had to be something he could do or buy to change his brother’s mind.
Dean thinks he’ll stay awake all night, but just as had happened at the motel, the warmth and comfort send him off to dreamland after only a few minutes.
Cas continues. “I didn’t like the pajamas you bought yesterday, so I won’t like anything else. Your clothes are soft, and they smell like you.” Cas’s eyes widen comically, as if he didn’t mean to say that.
“What? Oh, am I presuming too much? I just wanted …” Shit, had he fucked things up already? Wouldn’t be surprising. Even when he tried to do the right thing, he did it wrong.
Gabe led Cas over to his usual seat near the window. With Abby faithfully sitting right next to Cas and the brothers continuing to talk about the town, they only had to wait a few minutes before a bubbly redhead bounced over to them with their drinks in hand, “Hey, Gabe!”
Cas scrambled to get away from Dean and ended up on the floor. He curled his legs up close to his chest and hid in the corner.
They laughed through their embarrassment and stayed in bed a bit longer after cleaning up, sharing sweet slow kisses. Dean frowned and stroked Cas’s cheek with his thumb, “As much as I wish we could spend today together, I have to go to the shop.”
“Fine! You want me to leave so bad, I will!” Dean untangled himself from the blanket and left the room, slamming the bedroom door behind him. The harsh sound of the door slamming shook through the small house, cutting through the silence.
This time Cas ignored him; he wanted Dean to come back. The stranger grabbed his wrist and pulled Cas close against his body, “Don’t be like that, baby. Stay a while.”
Cain pulled Cas down the dark, empty hallway with what felt like a gun pressed to Cas’s back, “Walk quietly with your head down.”
Very slowly, Cas opens his eyes and groaned before throwing up everywhere. Gabe quickly turned him to his side and tried to tell him everything was okay, “I got you baby brother, you’re alright.”
Dean drops the front of Cas’s jacket. He silently put the Impala into drive and without saying another word or even looking at Cas, Dean drove him home.
Dean felt like a damn idiot. The first completely gorgeous guy in Lawrence in god knows how long and Dean had made a fool of himself and insulted his dog within five minutes of meeting him.
Annie knew something was wrong when Cas didn’t pick her up but more than that, he didn’t say anything or even look at his little girl. The only thing she could think of was running to the fridge to look at Dean’s number that was for emergencies. Grabbing the house phone, Annie quickly dialed it; as soon as the line stopped ringing she answered in a shaky voice, “Dean?”
Not understanding why Cas would apologize, Dean just reassured him instead of asking why, “Hey, it’s no problem. You guys enjoying the last of the weather?”
When Dean added a third finger, he moved back up to kiss Cas. He easily slipped in his third finger while gently capturing Cas’s soft lips in his. After another minute, Dean pulled away to look at Cas’s lust-blow eyes, “Think you’re ready?”
The next morning, Gabe, Alfie, Luke, and Mike came home early so they decided on making breakfast. Trying to be considerate, Alfie softly knocked on Cas’s door and opened it a crack before whispering, “Hey, Cas. Do you want some waffle—oh my god!” Dean and Cas were still spooning each other, facing the door. They were shirtless with the comforter draped over them, making them look naked.
Jody didn’t call Cas until the end of the day. She wanted the most emotional testimony to go at the end of the day so the jurors would think about it all night. Cas took the stand and swore the oath that he would not perjure himself. The questions Jody asked him were similar to the ones she asked during their meeting. But soon, Crowley stood up to cross-examine Cas. His Scottish accent was thick and cunning, “So… internship at the station? You’re a pretty lucky guy.”
Anna pulled the helmet over her head and once she was on the bike, securely wrapped her arms around Cas’s middle. He revved the engine and drove off towards the highway.
Dean quickly scrambled in the back of the ambulance with Cas as Gabe, Mike, Luke, and Alfie grabbed their stuff along with Dean and Cas’s so they could meet them at the hospital. In the ambulance, Cas’s heart rate kept increasing as he desperately reached out for Dean, “Dean? I’m really scared. Please talk to me… I feel awful and I’m kind of panicking and I feel like I’m going to throw up and pass out and fuck—Dean, please. I need you.”
Cas refused to let go of Dean but he wanted to sit with him so Cas heaved Dean up, allowing him to wrap his legs around Cas’s waist as Cas carried Dean back to his room.
They both climbed onto the bike as Dean scooted up close against Cas’s back and tightly held onto him. Cas turned on the bike; feeling it spring to life under him, the vibrations shook through the two boys. When Cas revved the engine, Dean could help but break out into a huge grin as he thought about what the rest of their night was going to be like.
Dean didn’t want to say anymore. The things he wanted to say to Cas weren’t for anyone else to hear.
Elle frowned at that but not for the reason they thought, “Oh, that Alastair. He’s the one who smashed out on the Roadhouse’s windows. I’m glad he got his ass beat. The more I hear about this Cas kid, the more I like him.” She nudged Dean’s foot under the table and winked at him. Dean’s face was so red, it looked like he was going to explode. Somehow, Ellen always managed to pick up on the smallest things.
Dean pried one of his boyfriend’s hands off the wall and starts to drag him away from the wall, followed by Cas’s panicked protests.
Dean most definitely checked out Cas’s ass as he left and yes, Cas is hot and no, Dean is not sorry.
Cas didn’t fight, he just grit his teeth and waited for Cain to stop, waited to be alone, waited for everything to stop.
Cas clung to Dean’s bare arms, burying himself against his boyfriend, “Don’t go, Dean. I’m so sorry.”
“Me too… please don’t stop.” Cas started to move his hips to meet Dean’s thrusts, the pleasure becoming overwhelming. Desperate for release, Cas wrapped a hand around his cock and after a few strokes, he came over his own stomach with a loud moan.
Dean ran a hand over his face and pushed his papers back, “He’s doing as good as you’d expect. That definitely took a lot out of him.”
Cas on the other hand… not so much. He clung to the white stone wall and refused to move. Dean put his hands on Cas’s hips over the smooth leather, “Let go, Cas. I got you.”
Cas ran his strong hands over Dean’s round ass, “Now, baby… do you know why I brought you all the way out here?” Dean only whimpered in response so Cas continued, “No? Well, here I can fuck the hell out of you and you can make all those beautiful noises as loud as you want.” He ended his sentence with a harsh slap on Dean’s ass.
Dean, Cas, Sam, and Jody all sat together at a circular wooden table with a tape recorder in the middle. Jody started asking Cas easily questions;
Needless to say, the car ride back to Dean’s house was silent, but not the same silence as they sat in on their way to the courthouse; this silence was slightly awkward but at the same time, full of excitement and uncertainty.
Wanting to slam his fist into a wall, Dean decided to walk away before he did something he would regret.
Cas looked completely defeated sitting eerily still with his blood still damp on his grey sweater, “Yes… I’m going to bed.”
As soon as they were back in Lawrence, Gabriel knew he made the right choice; Cas locked himself in his room and finally let go of his anger and sadness and grief.
The two brothers said goodbye and made plans to meet up soon, Dean was walking to his car when his phone rang. Looking at the caller I.D, his phone read, ‘Novak.’ Dean hated the part of him that was excited that Cas was calling but even more than that, he hated the part of him that was annoyed he was calling. Groaning, Dean answered the phone, “Novak, what did I tell you about calling me?”
Dean grabbed Zeke’s collar and got into his face, snarling out his command, “Listen to me. You will tell me who you tattooed this on or you'll be shitting out your own teeth.”
Cas reached over to touch the only part of Dean he could without waking up his daughter; gently resting his hand on Dean’s cheek, Cas stroked his thumb over Dean’s freckle-covered cheeks, “I love you.”
Pulling away from Dean, Cas wrapped a solid hand around himself and started to quickly stroke himself, “Open your mouth.”
Dean could feel his heart stop in his chest and bile creep up his throat, “What? Is… is he awake, sweetheart?” With her shy reply of “yes”, Dean’s blood pressure started to even out now that he knew Cas’s health wasn’t at risk, “I’ll be there in five minutes, okay? Just stay on the phone with me.”
Cas didn’t fight it as he flopped down in bed before saying a quick thank you to Dean and almost instantly falling asleep.
Sam looked up from his sandwich and with his mouth half-full, skeptically asked Dean, “You did go and get him, right? Or at least call somebody?”
Mary sighed at her overprotective son, “I’m just fine, honey. I have a handsome EMT taking care of me.”
After wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, Cas walked over to Dean and stroked his freckle-covered cheek with the back of his hand before softly kissing him, “I love you, Dean.”
“Let’s go then. I need a break from this goddamn job and it’ll be good for you to get out of here for a little bit.” When Dean saw Cas’s bright smile light up his face, he knew he made the right choice.
Quickly standing up, Cas stepped out of Dean’s office, leaving the older man to roll his eyes and go back to looking at his screen.
Raphael and Michael quickly walked up to Cas and grabbed his arms. Raphael, the bigger of the two, sneered into Cas’s ear, “Look who it is, out little faggot came home!”
Looking back over the clipboard, Dr. Wyatt shook his head thoughtfully, “Well, your blood tests look good as well. However, if you have any other symptoms please come in, it’s better to be safe than sorry. I will also write you a prescription for Zoloft.”
He remembered that time in the police station when they had been surrounded by demons. That was when he’d realised that Cas would just always be there for him, no matter what. Cas had kept trying to brush it off and pretend that he was only there because it was interesting and he was bored… but he’d used that excuse too many times for Dean to buy it at that point. When Dean really thought about it, he supposed that day was when he’d first started falling in love with Castiel.
“For the past twelve years, I’ve fought by your side. I’ve fought heaven, and hell, and everything in between. I’ve chosen you over every
rippling through the hunter's mind. Cas moved away from the Winchesters and was about to fly away when his senses picked up on more angels, ten of them at least. His eyes went wide and he summoned his weapon once more.
They’d see each other again – sooner than expected if Bobby was right about this whole ‘time is different up here’ shtick – but that wouldn’t give Dean back the life he’d never had.
Yes, sorry. They're warming up to Cas, but they also still think he's a monster. Sam and Dean aren't quite trusting yet… but don't worry, they'll get there eventually :)
"Can I look?" he asked softly, needing to make sure that Cas was really healed like he was acting. Cas nodded and began to unbutton his shirt, his movements were slow and stiff and Dean could tell he was still in pain so he pushed his hands away and did it himself. When he got to his chest he ran his hand over the small red scar there and tears spilt from his eyes. "It's not disappeared?" Dean questioned and Cas shook his head delicately.
The nurse quickly came into the room and when she approached Cas he clung to Dean with shaky hands and pleaded in a wavering voice, “Please, don’t let them hurt me.”
The voice that came out of the kid wasn’t what Dean was expecting from looking at him. It was deep, gravely, and filled Dean's spank bank, “Dean Winchester?”
Again, Annie took everything in stride, “Okay!” But after a moment of silence, she piped up again, “…does that mean I get to have a boyfriend?”
He could have moved out years ago. Cas worked hard in college and had enough money saved up from working as a waiter on campus but he still lived with his father, Chuck. The only reason he stayed was that his father needed somebody to talk care of him; he was getting older and drank too much to be able to care for himself. As horrible as he was to Cas, Chuck was still his father and Cas still loved him.
Cas pulled the six pack out of the grocery bag, “The cashier didn’t believe me that I was twenty one so they checked my I.D and then had the manager check it.”
“How are you?” Of course, that’s the question Dean decided to ask. Cas wanted to help Dean, he walked to talk about Dean, not himself.
Instantly knowing her son, Mary shook her head against the crisp white pillowcase, “Dean Winchester, I did not raise a liar.”
After a few more moments of trying to catch their breaths and pull their brain cells back together, Dean and Cas walked back to Jody’s office to finish the rest of the meeting. Cas described going to the hospital and his injuries and after that, they all decided to call it a day.
For two weeks, Dean and Cas sat next to each other in the scorching hot courtroom. They had to listen as Cain slandered the other victims as well as Cas but in the end, the jury found Cain guilty on all charges.
He gripped onto his boyfriend’s hand, everything became too much, “Hey, Cas. What happened? I… I told you to wear your helmet… I begged you… I—… fuck. I love you so much. Just open your eyes, please.”
The smirk that crossed Cas’s face brought out the willing-submissive in Dean. The way he growled out his words, his firm and commanding hands; Dean just couldn’t get enough.
By ten in the morning, they were on the road. As it turns out, driving to Arizona in the middle of August in an old car that doesn’t have A/C wasn’t the greatest idea Dean or Cas has ever had. In the middle of New Mexico, it reached almost one hundred degrees in the car. It got to the point where neither of them could take it anymore so they ended up stripping down to their boxers to drive the rest of the way until they reached a motel for the night.
Surprisingly, Annie seemed completely unfazed by her teacher and her father screaming and Dean found out why when he pulled her aside after school to try to explain, “I just want to apologize for getting into an argument with your father.”
Sam’s face is bright red with rage, “Are you fucking kidding me?! You didn’t bother to tell mom and dad about Cas?!”
Cas stirred more and snaked an arm around Dean’s middle and pulled him closer. After they kissed for a few more minutes, Cas pulled away but moved his hand up to cradle Dean’s face, “So… last night was really fun. I’d love to see you again.”
After giving Cas a quick kiss, Dean ran up the stairs stripping off his flannel and t-shirt on the way up. In his room, he pulled on his black suit, white button up and a green tie, that perfectly complimented his eyes, before running back downstairs.
Cas remembered the first time Chuck laid his hands on Anna. She had just turned ten years old; they were sitting around the kitchen table in their usual tense silence when Anna cleared her throat and asked if they could go to the fair that was an hour away.
After hanging up, Dean rested his head against Cas’s shoulder, “Thank you for coming, I just didn’t know what else to do… you don’t have to stay, you know…”
Dean kissed the back of his hand, “Is it your stomach again, baby? We can go home if you don’t feel good.”
The doctor lead both Dean and Bobby down the hall but stopped when he got to Cas’s room, “Perhaps just Dean should go in? He’s been asking for you since he woke up.”
Dean smiled back at Cas and pulled him back in for another kiss and very slowly took off Cas’s shirt, giving him plenty of time to stop him. When Cas didn’t stop him, Dean lightly rubbed his thumb over Cas’s nipple, eliciting a small moan from him.
They spend most nights together. Wherever they go, their siblings usually come with them. They were never the older siblings that were embarrassed by their little brother or sister, they loved spending time together.
Dean started walking back towards his room, hearing Cas get up and follow him. In his room, Dean flopped back into bed after taking a drink of water. When he looked at Cas he knew he made the right choice; Cas was standing in front of Dean’s bed, holding the pillow close to his chest, staring at Dean with those big, blue eyes. Dean couldn’t help but smile and pat the left side of his bed, “Come on, lay down.”
Sitting in the passenger seat of the ambulance, Cas let out a sigh of relief, “That’s better than it could have been. Do you need anything? I’m still in the city.”
The light flurries had started as the cold gusts of wind bit at Cas’s split, bruised knuckles as he rode to the bar. He hated the pit; it was cramped and dark. The ring smelt of dried blood and sweat. The room was damp and musty. It was the last place Cas wanted to be. He would have much rather ride home and have Anna and Dean waiting for him; he would wrap each of them in a hug. After a hot, relaxing shower, Cas would lay in bed with Dean and finally finish that book; they would be warm and safe.
“You weren’t out with that disgusting boyfriend of yours?” Chuck slurred his words through his aggressive question.
Cas had Dean’s face against his bare chest, his arms holding his boyfriend close against him. As Cas absent-mindedly trace soothing patterns onto Dean’s soft, warm skin. Before either of them could drift into sleep, Cas quietly said, “Me, you, and Annie should take a trip somewhere.”
Dean smiled against Cas’s neck, breathing in the clean scent of his shampoo, “Don’t apologize. How are you this fine morning?”
Cas only pulled away a few inches before smirking at Dean, catching the slight blush on his freckled cheeks and the shine in his green eyes, “You’re the best.”
Dean stopped and apologetically winced, “Sorry… I just haven’t seen Sammy in three years. What if he’s not the same? I’m not the same.”
As soon as the lunch bell rang, Anna rushed to the front of the lunch room where Cas said he would wait for her. Sam loyally stuck by her side through the busy hallways, trying desperately to offer her any comfort he possibly could.
The smile quickly fell from Dean’s lips, “Yeah, he’s like a father to me but he is actually Jo’s dad… my real dad died four years ago.”
Brakes. Go back. Bad topic. Dean shifted uncomfortably in his seat and nervously sipped at his whiskey before placing it back down and watching the ice cubes bobbing in the amber liquid, “It’s okay. That’s a big can of worms. Anyway… you said you adopted Annie?”
The redhead smacked his arm, "Shut the hell up, Winchester. My yellow beast could beat Baby any day… four-wheel drive baby!” Charlie flashed Dean that smile that he had grown used to; it was warm and familiar. So was the 'ridiculous' novelty t-shirt she was wearing that day.
Cas quickly walked to his room while Dean grabbed Chuck by his collar, pulling him close to his face, “Listen to me you disgusting piece of shit, you ever touch him again and I will kill you.”
On their own account, Dean’s feet followed the doctor to a small, empty, quiet waiting room. Dean doesn’t remember sitting down. He doesn’t remember the doctor starting to talk to him.
Being close to Cas felt right, even though it broke Dean’s heart to see him so upset. He wanted to hold Cas and take away the pain he was feeling. And when Cas looked at Dean with those big blue eyes and asked him to stay, Dean knew he wasn’t going anywhere.
When Bobby finally was able to look into Cas’s eyes; the boy looked dead. He looked empty. His once bright eyes were more grey than sapphire, the bruises plaguing his face complimented the dark bags under his eyes. The dried blood easily stood out against his pale skin.
An unreadable look crossed Bobby’s face, “Head home early, Novak. Someday when your parents are home, stay for dinner.”
Dean had no idea what he was talking about. What happened with Alfie… that was Cas’s fault. Alfie was a quiet, sweet, somewhat reserved kid before he met Cas. Then they started to date and the bullying started. Alfie started to get assaulted and beat up for being gay. Cas was petrified the same thing would happen to Dean.
The next day when Cas dropped Anna off at school, he hugged her for a long time, soothingly rubbing his hand on her back, “Love, I promise you’ll be okay.”
It was around four o’clock when Dean texted Cas. They hadn’t been together long but none the less he missed Cas. It had been a week since they first hooked up and they hadn’t seen each other since Cas was still suspended. He missed Cas’s lips, his strong arms, he missed the dominant look in his eyes… hell, he even missed his sometimes terrible attitude.
With every thrust, Cas slammed against Dean’s prostate making him scream out and moan, “Yes, Cas! Yours… I’m all yours. Oh… god! Fuck me, Cas. I’m so c—close.”
Dean re-watched the footage a few times before scrubbing a hand over his face and sighing, “Alright, forward me and Novak the whole days’ worth of footage, we’ll comb through it.”
After another kiss… or two or three… Dean left and Cas took a deep breath before stepping inside to face his brother and their roommates.
After eating, Annie asked Cas to take her to the park. Figuring the weather was going to turn too cold soon, he agreed. Even if it was too cold, there was no way he could say no to those big blue eyes.
After checking that Annie was wrapped up in the movie, Dean quickly kissed Cas’s cheek. Cas turned back to him with a lust-drunk smile on his face and snuck another quick kiss, bumping his nose against Dean’s but turning back to the T.V before Annie noticed her father kissing her teacher; they weren’t trying to hide their new feelings but they also didn’t want to make Annie uncomfortable.
“He had a benign Polycystic Astrocytoma five years ago. He had it removed and it hasn’t come back. He’s blind and has asthma. His last CT scan was a little over two months ago, it was clear.”
Cas was busy working a usual shift of eight in the morning to eight at night when he got a call over the radio. It was five twenty-seven at night, “3220, two car MVC. Possible entrapment. Highway 335, past mile marker 6.”
Despite all of Cas’s protests, they did end up going to the gym almost every day. Cas had two months before the academy started and by the time those two months were over, he could easily spar with Dean. Their study sessions turned into play-wrestling which turned blow jobs; it was surprising Cas ever got any studying done.
Cas ran his hands through his hair, the grease and sweat that was on his hands transferred into his black hair, “Listen, I don’t need to be judged for how I choose to live my life and I sure as shit don’t need anyone telling me how to raise my sister. If you don’t like it, you can fuck off.”
Nothing could stop Dean from attaching himself to Cas. He threw his arms around the older boys tense shoulders as Cas securely wrapped Dean in a tight hug.
As promised, he pulled up to the front entrance of Lawrence Memorial Hospital a few minutes later. The cold night air breezed through his old sweatpants and light t-shirt. He had completely forgotten to put on a jacket; his panic of thinking Dean was hurt rushing him out the door.
“Then explain how you threw that demon ten damn feet with enough power to crack a wall, Dean!” Sam shouted. And Dean’s mouth fell closed. How did they know about that? “We were there last night. We saw everything.”
For as much as the pair of them had given Sam a headache this morning – well, let’s be honest, they’d been giving him a headache for twelve years now – he was glad to be the one up here with them.
"And you're going to choose them over me?" He asked incredulously. "After everything we've been through… you're just going to
“And so today, my world it smiles,” he sang. His voice was deep and rough, but still beautiful, and Dean’s heart really did leap at the sound. “Your hand in mine, we walk the miles. Thanks to you, it will be done.”
“Now this wedding is about as unofficial as they come,” Sam announced to the guests, “considering Dean is presumed dead in all fifty states, and Cas wasn’t even born, so we’re gonna skip the whole signing of the licence part because Dean says it sounds boring.”
"You should leave, Hester… I don't want to hurt you." Hester gritted her teeth and was about to attack him when there was suddenly a new presence in the room.
Cas grinned as he continued. “Before I first spoke to Dean, I spent much of my time feeling lost. I was… a good soldier, but not much more. I had brothers and sisters, I had a father, but I didn’t have a
been in a serious relationship. But, somehow, he had fallen in love with the trickster. Sam hadn’t really thought it through when he’d stabbed Cas. He’d just wanted to protect his brother.
"And that's why you're in so much pain," Dean said as a statement, he didn't need it answering but Cas nodded anyway. He looked away from the inflamed skin and into deep blue eyes, "is there anything I can do to help?" Cas paused before he shook his head.
“No, I believe that is a fair assessment,” he confirmed, and Dean’s eyes turned soft again as he smiled back at his soon-to-be husband.
They were almost done eating before one of the songs that Dean had added onto the mixtape that he’d made for Cas a few years ago started to play, and Cas started to hum along, tapping his fingers lightly against his glass to the beat of ‘
They’d hoped Rowena might be able to help with that one but, apparently, the spell needed for it would have reacted poorly with the much-needed hangover cures. And they didn’t exactly have an angel on hand right now. Even if Cas had been here, getting ready for the wedding inside the bunker like Dean was – which he
"So what… you got your hands on a DeLorean?" Dean joked and Cas huffed out a laugh. He remembered Dean saying something similar in another life, but he had never understood his references back then.
And then she had to immediately hold back her cough of surprise because that was definitely no longer apple juice in her glass.
’ Cas’ voice rang in his head again and Dean’s heart clenched at the words. Not like this! Why did it have to be like
“I will,” Dean nodded. “But Bobby needs to hear this too and I don’t feel like saying this crap twice.” Sam could understand that. He could wait a little longer. Dean patted Sam on the shoulder and walked into the kitchen to grab a beer from the fridge. He frowned down at Bela, who was sitting at the kitchen table, as though he hadn’t even realised that she was here. “You look like you’ve been hit by a car,” Dean muttered and Bela gave a sarcastic smile
Dean’s eyes went wide as he whipped his head around to glare at his Best Man – which was a gender-neutral term now, according to Charlie. “You told me no one could tell!”
Meanwhile, both Lilith and Zacharia are plotting on ways to shift the plan back onto the right direction. One of Zacharia’s human spies manages to find Sam and Zacharia enters his dream and builds his trust until Sam gives away their location. Zach tries to talk to Dean and Sam in person, but Cas senses him there and shows up, killing Zacharia. More angels show up but they are mostly from Cas’ garrison and are conflicted on whether to kill Cas or not. Uriel tries to talk him down but Sam, now finally equipped with an angel blade, tries to attack Cas while he’s distracted. Uriel retaliates by choking Sam until he is left unconscious. Cas kills Uriel and flies the Winchesters out of there. Dean has now put together that Cas is an angel and so Cas tells him the whole truth. Afterwards, Sam wakes up and walks in on them kissing. He freaks out, thinking that Dean is being manipulated by Cas. Sam stabs Cas with an angel blade. Cas doesn’t die because he is too powerful but he is drastically weakened. Cas agrees to temporarily share some of his grace with Dean so it will heal unburdened inside of him and help Cas to heal more quickly. And that’s where we left off!
“Good to see you too,” Dean shouted after him, his voice dripping with sarcasm as he plastered a fake smile on his face. Dean walked further into the room to look at the papers on the desk and frowned: the first clipping was just a lonely-hearts page from a newspaper. Well, Bobby had said it was a
the time to think about such a thing. Sam thought that Cas was a danger to Dean and he’d do anything to help his brother.
Claire smiled nervously out at the large room of hunters, trying not to fidget. “Hey, er… most of you don’t know me. Which, er, sucks for you, I guess,” she laughed, and she thought she saw a few people in the crowd smiling back, but she suddenly couldn’t hear anything over the pounding in her ears. “I’m Claire, and I’m also the last speaker so, don’t worry, we’ll all get to eat soon enough.”
Sam rolled his eyes and ignored it. “Linda sent me with a message. She says if you don’t decide on which champagne you want serving during the toasts in the next five minutes, she’ll come down here and, I’m quoting here, ‘
Except, they both knew that death wouldn’t be the end of their story. Either they’d come back to life.
There was a loud squeal of laughter coming from the buffet area, and all eyes turned to watch as Eileen squirmed and laughed while Sam struggled to hold her still long enough to blow raspberries on her neck. Beside them, Dean had his mouth filled to the brim with food, his cheeks ballooned up like a chipmunk, looking as though he was only one surprised laugh away from choking to death. Meanwhile, Cas was hugging him tightly from behind, his head rested on Dean’s shoulder as they both fondly watched the scene play out in front of them.
"Castiel?!" A blond woman asked in shock and she stepped forwards, Cas winced at the happiness in her voice and hoped that his friends didn't pick up on it. "We thought you were dead."
Though, today, it didn’t bring quite the same excitement as it normally did. Today, the only story Dean actually wanted to tell, the only one to bring a flutter to his chest, was the one about him and Cas.
“You don’t meet people like Dean Winchester and Castiel every day, you know,” Claire said, more confident now. “And when you do first meet them, you might think that there is no way that they could work, they’re just that different. I mean, take Dean – he is a junk-food addict who has not only seen, but can also quote, every single movie ever made. Whereas Cas can barely understand a Star Trek reference and only actually learnt what pop tarts were… like a week ago.”
“A little,” he admitted, turning back around to survey himself and his well-fitted white suit in the mirror. He was also wearing shiny black shoes, an embroidered ivory waistcoat, and a blue silk tie. It was definitely a show-stopper look. “I hate the waiting.”
"What's happening?" Dean asked once he realised that Cas didn't want to hurt them. Cas didn't answer and a few seconds later the room was flooded with angels.
Dean leant around Cas to look at Bobby and said his thanks, following it up with: “I have to ask, did you insult me in Japanese?”
“Shut up and let me get you two married already,” Sam rebuffed, and another, softer, wave of laughter went through the rows of guests. “Alright, rings and vows,” he said gesturing to the Best Men before looking back between Cas and Dean again. “Who’s going first?”
… then do it for me. Think about it, Cas. You are quite literally my guardian angel. You've saved us countless times and so if you're too hurt or too weak then demons, and

Cas clung on tighter to Dean’s body, and the contact felt so good, so warm. He closed his eyes and sighed. There was so much that he wanted to say, so much he
He didn’t think he’d ever get used to this, to actually being with Dean, but he’d have the rest of his life to find that out.
Dean pulled the car up to a stop. He was on a bridge, and the scenery beyond was breath-taking. He took a moment to stare out at the world that Jack had built, that
“And let them take the Winchester away from us?” Lilith asked, eyes sharp and menacing despite the sickly-sweet voice that she put on. The demon in front of her cowered and shook his head.
Like I said at the beginning of this chapter, this will be my last post for several weeks but I promise that this fic won't be stopped completely and updates should start back up again before the end of next month. I am really sorry for where I left this before going on my hiatus. I didn't realise until today which chapter it was that I was leaving you hanging on... sorry.
She had only ever wanted the best for her boys, and seeing Dean looking so carefree, and in-love made her heart soar higher than ever before. She’d missed a lot in Dean’s life, but she was so glad that she hadn’t been forced to miss this too.
The Roadhouse was, of course, originally Ellen’s bar. But that one had burnt down like 13 years ago. Ellen hadn’t been in any rush to rebuild, but Ash hadn’t felt right without the place. Even in heaven, the Roadhouse had been his home. So, he got the go-ahead from Ellen, wired himself some money straight from a billionaire’s bank account, and built himself a bar. This place was all his now.
There was a grin pulling at the corner of his lips, but Dean tried desperately to keep it locked inside. Not because he didn’t want to feel it, but because he
can get to us as well as to you," Dean said, hoping that Cas would take the bait and sighing in relief when the angel nodded a few moments later. "Okay… how do we do this?"
“It’s a long story, Bobby,” she brushed away. She looked down at the colt she was still holding and passed it to Sam. There was something different about her but Sam just couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
Sam had never seen Dean smile so wide as he was doing right now, standing at the altar and preparing to marry his best friend. He was so thrilled that he couldn’t seem to stand still, brimming with energy and happiness.
While everyone was laughing, Dean grinned. “We’re the best damn love story ever told, man.” He said it quietly, whispered it into Cas’ ear, so close that he brushed his nose against the hairs on Cas’ head. Obviously, no one else overheard him, but it wasn’t meant for them, only for Cas.
“Look, I’m just not one for the mushy crap, okay?” Dean admitted. “And I’m not particularly looking forward to having everyone’s eyes on me as I spout my undying love, or whatever.”
“And don’t forget to exorcise him before you come back in!” another hunter, who Claire was pretty sure was named Rufus, shouted after them. His comment received a fair few cheers.
"Of course it is." Cas moved closer to the Winchester and kissed him delicately, Dean automatically kissed him back but he was too broken to put any real thought into it.
"In there." Dean quirked his eyebrow but followed Cas inside and found himself inside a hallway of a seemingly ordinary house.
Charlie decided she wasn’t going to touch this one with a five-foot pole, so she just kept on walking. She would really have to get the lowdown on what exactly happened during their ‘
“I’m not going anywhere,” she encouraged and Sam nodded. He started going into the whole story, including the information they had only really just learnt themselves about the Apocalypse. Bela didn’t look as surprised as Sam would have expected. Actually, she was pretty emotionless. She had clearly been through a lot lately. Which brought up another question. What was Bela even doing here? They hadn’t even heard from her in nearly a year.
Dean didn’t care how Cas tried to dress it up, it was sleep. And, eventually, Cas had admitted it too. He’d tried to deny it for so many days because he was worried about what it meant for the state of his powers. But Dean had calmed him down and reminded him that sleep was a good thing. It was how the body, and hopefully Cas’ grace too, healed itself. Cas had taken one hell of a blow to the system and getting a little sleepy was nothing to be alarmed over. Or so Dean hoped anyway. He’d never met an angel before… but how much different could they really be?
From the hole in the door, he could see part of Dean’s face. He looked broken. Sam pulled himself to his feet and moved towards the panic room, twisting the lock to open the door. Dean just stood there silently. He looked at Sam briefly before his eyes returned to Cas’ body lying on the floor.
“Everything’s down in the basement. It’ll be a damn sight easier to show you than to explain,” Bobby said as they hurried through the house. Dean followed him into the panic room where Sam was sitting and going through papers. Dean wasn’t surprised that Sam was here and he wasn’t exactly thrilled to be proved right, but he would push through it if Bobby needed him to. When they walked in, Sam raised his head and frowned at them. Bobby obviously hadn’t mentioned that he was coming.
The werewolf was partnered with Eileen, and behind them stood the mullet guy (Mary thought his name might have been Ash) with Jo Harvelle, behind them were Rowena and that Southern vampire who seemed far too attached to Dean, then Jody and Donna.
So, in return for the assistance of her demons, she asked for two things: first, she wanted an angel blade of her own. But most importantly was the second thing: she would grant the angels free access to hell so that they could raise Bela Talbot from the dead. Surprisingly enough, they agreed to both stipulations.
“They love and accept each other for who they are, flaws and all, and that’s what marriage is about.”
And then someone was chanting an exorcism. A woman. Sam looked up and saw none other than Bela Talbot standing over him with the colt. She had only gotten a few words into the exorcism when the demons all suddenly up and left their hosts, retreating. Sam looked around in surprise but he supposed that they had done what they’d come here to do: they had killed Cas. Sam spared Bobby a glance to make sure he was alright before his eyes trained onto the door to the panic room.
That guy said that you were friends…" Cas stopped his work and looked over at Dean for a moment before he turned back to painting the sigil. "How does a
“Can I talk to you for a second, Bobby?” Sam muttered through a clenched jaw and Dean rolled his eyes as his brother walked past without a word to him.
Anyone who wants to contact me while this is on hiatus can do so via my instagram account (pieprincess_andthe_fallenangel), if you have any questions about my fic and future updates then you can ask me on there
But when the song finally began to play, she sighed in relief, as did everyone in the line behind her who had all also heard about the apparent plan to combine Cas’ love of pop and rap music with Dean’s love of cowboys for their ceremony. But instead of
Cas’ voice sent a shiver down his spine, making the breath catch in his throat. For a moment, Dean was frozen. He couldn’t turn around, he couldn’t… He couldn’t let this be another trick.
"Why are you giving them us if they can kill you?" Sam asked and Cas reluctantly broke his eye contact with Dean so he could turn around and look at the taller Winchester brother instead.
Cas wasn’t proud to admit that this game went on for several days while the guest list expanded to include Hannah, Lisa Braeden, Cas’ sort-of-wife from when he had amnesia Daphne (and yes, he imagined that, if she had, in fact, turned up today, she would have been in for a shock), Dean’s ex-girlfriend Cassie, and the Djinn Queen that Cas may or may not be technically married to…
Again, except Crowley, who instead shouted “When do I get to object?” over the noise of the crowd. He received a glare from Cas for that one and a roll of the eyes from Dean. Rowena just told him to hush.
“What’s happening?” Bela whispered and Sam could only shake his head, it was too much to explain. They decided to check the rest of the bodies for pulses, but all of the empty vessels were already dead. Once they’d finished, they looked back to Dean but he hadn’t moved an inch.
than the pair on the karaoke machine. When Dean finally turned around to meet Cas’ eyes, he blushed and leant over for a kiss. Jody looked away to give them some privacy as she sat down with her pie.
Jack accompanied Cas down the aisle, hugging both Cas and Dean before taking a seat beside Mary and the two Bobby’s in the front row. Mary felt close to tears again as she took in the scene – Dean standing there and smiling wide next to his soon-to-be husband, both of them in matching white suits, practically bursting with excitement.
“You know, I remember that first day that I brought Dean home like it was just yesterday rather than 42-years ago,” Mary said. “Though, of course, to me, it was only seven years ago, but that’s another story.” Bobby laughed along with the rest of the room. Though he had a better idea than most of how much that must of hurt their mother. If it hurt Bobby to be out of their lives for eight years, it must have hurt Mary a helluva lot more to be gone for
“It’s fine,” Sam insisted. “And even if I wasn’t… I can’t exactly go tell him off for flirting with my girlfriend when I’m kinda the reason why he died.” He said it as a joke and followed it up with a nervous laugh, but Eileen knew that he still did blame himself for that. He didn’t seem to be in the mood to actually talk about that right now, though, so Eileen just pressed a kiss to his cheek.
“Sure, Jan,” Charlie’s doppelganger responded. They’d decided to call her Charlie-X (for eXtreme since she was, you know, an angel-killing, apocalypse-world surviving
“Mmm, type AB positive,” Benny drawled after lowering the canister back down from his lips. He grinned up at Ash. “Refreshing.”
Castiel was dead. She didn’t even need her underlings to come back and confirm it, she had felt the earth shake at its core when he had lost his fight. He really
“He was one of the good guys,” Dean mumbled and Sam nodded because, whether that was or wasn’t true, it was a moot point now anyway.
“So, differences be damned, you know,” she continued. “Despite them, they’re better together, because they love each other. And I hope that one day I will be so lucky to marry someone who loves me like that.”
“When you were little, I used to tell you that angels were watching over you. It was just a saying back then… but I guess I was right.” Mary took a deep breath then and turned to Cas. “Castiel, I am so happy to call you my son.”
– and they chose each other anyway. They’ve been through a lot, but they always come out of it, together, stronger than ever before.
The length of the chapters varies depending on which episode I'm working off and how much I can see Cas doing in it.
Ellen and Jo's source ended up being yet another dead end; the boys drove back in a sullen mood but Castiel knew that he couldn't stay for much longer. He had seals to save and there was too much work still to be done. So, instead of following Dean around for a little longer like a lost puppy, he said a quick goodbye to the brothers and flew away. He had all intention of returning after a few days to check in, but he hadn't been expecting to be forced back to the Winchesters after the sensors alerted him to the presence of an angel nearby.
“What’s going on here?” Cas asked. The confused look on his face was enough to make Dean smile. He never got to see his angel look like that, Dean was usually the one a step behind in their relationship. But then he saw how Sa tensed suddenly and was reminded that now was
Sam threw his arm over her shoulder and pressed a kiss to the side of her forehead. She could read his gratitude for her rescue in his body language long before she looked up and read the words from his lips.
Sam just rolled his eyes and continued the reading. He managed to get through the final verse without any more interruptions from the stupidly happy couple gazing into each other’s eyes up here on the altar as though no one else was around.
Charlie still found that strange. Learning she had a doppelganger from another world hadn’t really bothered her – she’d read enough comics to be familiar with the multiverse theory, thank you very much – but, somehow, finding out that the
She regretted her words almost instantly. She forgot that sometimes her jokes came off as malicious rather than just dark-natured. Kaia would have been able to laugh and ease the situation if she was here, but she was sitting a few tables down with Jody, Donna, and Alex.
"I can't believe angels really exist," Dean muttered and Cas just nodded. "And God, too… the apocalypse… it's all just a lot to take in."
, including me, who doesn't join your mad crusade." He saw that Sam had passed out on the floor. "I am
Dean almost wanted to tell him to stop. To tell him that he couldn’t hear this again. But he didn’t because perhaps that was exactly
If Dean was better at vocalising how he felt, then he would have told Cas that. He thought that Cas still understood, though, if the was he was smiling, his blue eyes glistening, was anything to go by. He was beautiful.
“Damn right,” Claire muttered, accidentally into the microphone. There was some more cheering before everyone settled again. “Anyway, like I was saying…” she cast a glance back down to the newlyweds, noting how comfortably they were sitting together, even despite the preceding ruckus. “Cas and Dean are two very different people,” she said, looking back out at the crowd. “But their differences complement each other – they work together, like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.”
"I increased my warding a long time ago. Nothing less powerful than a high-level demon can kill me… not even with an angel blade," Cas said in return. Then took in a sharp breath as he moved to sit up straight instead of where he was slumped over Dean, "it's still just as painful though," he muttered. Dean smiled and pulled him into a kiss. It was soft and slow and he used it as a way to express just how much Cas meant to him as he cradled the angel's head in his left hand. A couple of moments later they pulled away and just stared into each other's eyes.
Dean woke up five hours later, feeling like he'd been stabbed. It took him a while to remember everything but, once he did, his eyes shot open. At first, he couldn't move through the pain, but he forced himself to. He sat up and noticed the scruff of dark hair of the man sitting on the floor against the bed and sighed in relief.
PS. Bela could also see Cas' true form when they were at the bar, but she was very close to dying at that time and she was hallucinating like crazy so she didn't think it was real.
they could kiss. So, they did. Dean leant over into Cas’ embrace, meeting his lips, and pulling him all the closer.
"Don't act like you wouldn't do the same thing," he sneered. "I know of your plan to free Lucifer and I know that you would kill
“Dean…” Sam began to say, but he didn’t know how to finish that. Only half an hour ago he’d thought that Cas was evil. But now… now he supposed it didn’t matter whether he was or wasn’t because Dean was going to have to mourn him no matter what. Dean walked past Sam and into the room. Everyone was silent as Dean knelt beside Cas’ body. He brushed his hands through Cas’ hair and pulled his body into his arms. He was shaking but silent.
Sam was officiating the wedding, so he stood in front of her, and the young flower girl stood behind. The girl’s father – that strange, gangly werewolf who was apparently a hunter too, once upon a time – was also one of the groomsmen and was currently crouched down and adjusting the girl’s pale pink dress. Mary smiled as she watched them interact, though it made her a little sad too; she’d missed out on her boys’ childhoods, and it still stung. She couldn’t help wishing that things had been different, even though she knew how great they were now.
“You look fine,” she assured her son. And then, because she was maybe just a little wicked, she added on: “Though you would look better with some mascara and lipstick. Do you want to borrow mine? We could match.”
They cut the cake together, and Cas got a lot of fun out of stuffing a slice into Dean’s mouth and then licking the buttercream off his lips. Afterwards, the music restarted, and their friends and family found their ways back to the dancefloor, but the speeches had been an emotional drain for both Cas and Dean, and they decided to sit down to rest and just enjoy each other’s company for a little while. They’d re-join the party soon enough, he was sure.
Dean thought on the moment of the proposal fondly now; it had been early in the morning, only a few days after getting Cas back from the Empty. Dean hadn’t slept much that first week. Not because he and Cas were doing it like rabbits (though, yeah, that was kind of true too), but because he was just too happy to sleep. His mind refused to shut-off.
Dean shouted and stood up as he looked over at the angel, "you've been lying to me since we met! I deserve some God damn answers!" Castiel looked at his lover sadly and nodded. He moved away from the wall and into the living room, indicating for Dean to follow. They both sat on the sofa.
"Damn it, Dean. He's obviously brainwashed you or something!" Dean spun around to face Sam and glared at him as he stood up.
“Have been all month,” Dean answered, even though it wasn’t a question. It was obvious that her boy was ready to be a married man.
This chapter I don't think is as good as some of the others, so I apologise. Also I realised around about the time that I was writing this chapter that I wasn't actually liking this 'following canon' as much as I thought I would (it doesn't give enough freedom in my writing) and so even though it carries on for a good few chapters, I managed to cut it down dramatically to get to the good stuff sooner.
“Hey, Bobby,” Dean whispered so as to not wake his boyfriend. “No, I just got done with one. Why? What’s going on?”
“Have at it,” Dean muttered, standing up and gesturing at Cas’ body. Sam frowned in surprise and stood up to.
“You’re kidding, right?” came the Scottish twang on the redheaded woman who had already downed half of her drink while Jody had been standing here. “This load of bullcrap? Quite frankly, I’d rather eat haggis.”
on appletinis. The only thing Dean seemed to care about now was making that shiner disappear before he had to walk down the aisle in only a few hours.
“Yeah, well, what can I say… I’ve been working out,” Dean joked and then banged on the door again. “Now let me out.”
The noise meant that no one really heard Dean’s muttered: “You’re damn right he will.” No one but Cas and Sam – who was
“We are gathered here today,” Charlie continued, “to celebrate these two idiots finally getting a damn clue!” The guests cheered around them, and Claire suddenly felt nervous about her own upcoming speech. It sucked, and there was no way it would get anywhere near the kind of reception that Charlie’s was getting.
He could feel the pain that he was inflicting on Dean and wanted to cry. Then Cas' pain increased significantly at the loss of a part of his grace. After a few seconds, he felt Dean lose consciousness and he let out a pained sigh. He opened his eyes and slipped down from the bed to the floor beside it, then he curled in on himself and breathed heavily in his attempts to keep from screaming.
. He’d passed out from lack of oxygen and woken up in a strange bed only to find that Cas and Dean were apparently a
. He was sure that word would always fill him with butterflies. “I didn’t mind,” Dean eventually answered. “In fact… I’m kinda glad that you did.”
?" Cas stayed silent for a few more seconds while he finished the sigil then turned to look at Dean.
“I need your help with something,” she admitted, surprising them. It had to be big for Bela to ask for help. “But that can wait,” she said, turning to face the kitchen window. Sam turned as well, though they couldn’t see Dean from this position. “What happened between him and Cas? He’s acting like they were…” Bela drifted off. Like they were in love.
In hopes of giving Dean a bit of his own medicine, Cas had asked Jack to revive Meg for him so that he could invite her as well. Because if Dean wanted to play that game, then Cas sure as hell could too. Of course, because they were still so used to avoiding talking about their issues, Dean only responded in kind by asking for Benny to be revived.
“Would you quit acting like a baby and just let me put makeup on you?” Charlie demanded and, after only a moment more of hesitation, Dean finally nodded and let her closer. She was able to put the concealer on over his black eye without any further complaints. Thankfully, there was only minor bruising, and his face wasn’t swollen. If it had been any worse, Charlie didn’t think she’d be able to help. As it was, a few different coloured concealers and a lot of blending, and Dean was as good as new. Charlie-X helped too, touching it up where Charlie herself missed, and then leaving to re-join Stevie and the rest of the wedding guests.
"Cas?" Dean said again, beginning to get worried. He pushed himself off the bed and knelt by his boyfriend, smiling lightly when he noticed that he was still breathing, and sat next to him. Dean was overcome by the sight of the angel in that minute, though. He looked just like he had when Dean was piercing the veil, bright white wings sprouted from his back and engulfed the majority of the room and a light fog filled Castiel's core… Dean realised it must be his grace when he reached out to attempt to brush a hand through one of the wings and noticed a very faint version of the light fog on his own skin.
As promised, I got reviews so I'm updating again. Sorry once more for the widely varying chapter lengths, this one is longer than most of the others because there's just so much that could happen. It's also one of my more favourite chapters of the ones that are based on S3 episodes (although, in my opinion, the better ones don't come until after the 'No Rest for the Wicked' chapter)
"Castiel, please. You're my brother, my friend. We fought side by side for millenniums and you're just going to throw it all away for this
Dean was fascinated for a moment, feeling like a child with a new toy. Then he looked back at the brilliant white wings and slowly lowered his hand to touch one. He wasn't sure if it would work, but the wings turned out to be tangible. They were soft and warm to the touch and they fluttered when Dean made contact with them. He smiled brightly as he delicately brushed his fingers into the light feathers. Seeing these again was worth the pain, Dean decided as he stared at Cas and wondered how he'd never been able to see that the man was an angel; even when he could see his wings the first time around, he had bought Cas' excuse. He really was gullible.
now. Sam still didn’t understand how that had happened: Dean had never shown interest in men before, nor had he ever
Dean had flicked through the pages and discovered that a seal was about to be broken. He’d packed his bags and helped Cas into the shitty car he’d stolen (God, he missed his Baby) because Cas had insisted on coming along to be nearby and on hand to help in case he was needed. But Dean was fine on his own. Especially now that he had this… this… this angel sight. It was like he was piercing the veil again. He could spot a demon a mile away and he’d been surprised to find that he could talk to reapers now too.
There were a lot of people here all fit into a relatively narrow space, but that was okay; Mary liked that there were so many people out there who cared for her boys and considered them family – even if most of these people Mary barely even knew.
Okay guys, listen up because this is IMPORTANT: There are potential TRIGGER WARNINGS in this chapter. They're hard to tag so I'll just say dubcon? I have written the explanation out in more detail in the end note!
He thought of the first time Dean had realised how much Cas cared. They’d been stuck in a dream world and had stumbled their way into a cemetery filled with Cas’ loved ones. Cas had knelt down at one grave in particular and, for the first time since they’d met, Cas had dropped that mask he was always wearing. Dean later found out that the grave was his… or future-his, really. Dean hoped that he never became the dark, bitter, empty man that Cas had known. But Cas had loved that man anyway.
The next morning, Dean got the call. He was wrapped up on the bed with Cas at the time. He grunted at the sound and opened his eyes a little to see Cas practically lying on top of him: the angel barely reacted to the noise, pulling himself closer to Dean. Dean kissed the mess of dark hair softly and wrapped an arm around his angel. At the same time, Dean was reaching for his phone. A couple of seconds later, and with more than a little effort, he had it in his hand and answered the call without disturbing Cas.
"He'll be fine," Cas answered as he summoned a knife and sliced his arm. He began to paint the angel banishing sigil on the wall. They were silent for a moment and then Dean lifted his head to look at his lover, he frowned at what he was doing.
. Dean’s fear was in actually having the one thing that he’d been yearning after for years. It was in finally getting what he wanted, only to prove that he wasn’t
“Nah, it’s alright, Ellen,” Ash responded. “We all know he’s got delicate tastebuds.” Jo laughed while Rufus grunted something inaudible under his breath. Ash couldn’t hear it, but he had no doubt that it was an insult. That was alright, though, he had a soft spot for the old man. “That’s why I got in a bottle of blue label, just for you,” Ash continued around a mouthful of mashed potato. He nodded to the kitchen, and Rufus grinned.
“Erm… I’m stuck in Bobby’s panic room…” Dean said aloud, not sure how to respond in any other way. Cas clearly couldn’t hear him.
"Well, he's not human." Dean shook his head, he wanted to shout to Sam that Cas was an angel, that he was one of the good guys, that he'd saved their lives countless times and was trying to save the
Suddenly, everyone was moving and grabbing weapons and there were demons charging down the stairs, Dean could instantly see their twisted faces under the human’s they were possessing.
an angel…” Bobby said slowly, his eyes trained on Cas. “That doesn’t explain why Dean was able to throw that demon around like he weighed nothin’.”
“I didn’t wanna believe it because it just sounded… insane. But this war, it’s not between tricksters, is it?”
had built. His Cas. The man who had fought for him, fought with him, time and time again. The man who was capable of such greatness, who had love, and forgiveness, and compassion running through his veins. Who was everything Dean had ever wanted.
"Pick up the blade!" Cas growled at Dean. Both the Winchester's perceived Cas' words as a threat and Sam's grip on the knife tightened while Dean looked scared, lost and hurt at the thought of Cas wanting to hurt them, he stayed deadly still. "For fuck's sake, Dean," Cas practically shouted as he summoned the blade to him and strode towards them. Sam stiffened and was about to lunge at the oncoming threat when Cas just pushed him out of the way and shoved the blade into Dean's grasp.
"Wait," Dean stopped in his tracks "You said she'd have to stay overnight? You don't understand, she's my-" He couldn't tell him. He didn't want this beautiful man to know he was so broken he needed a dog to fix him. "She's my best friend," Dean continued "I can't leave her here." Castiel offered yet another warm smile "I can assure you, Dean... nothing will happen to your precious girl. Not on my watch." He patted Dean on the shoulder before he turned his attention to his clerk "Alright, Meg. Please be so kind as to check him out, send home some paperwork for him to fill out and instruct him on when he should return it." With that, the Veterinarian turned for the back of the clinic when Dean stopped him, again. Wait," he bit his lip nervously before asking "how will I know if she's doing okay? I can't wait 12+ hours, sir."
“Dude,” Dean muttered sharply as he sat on the couch to put his shoes and socks on. “What the hell has you freakin’ out?” He asked as he watched his brother run around hysterically, almost like Sam jumped out of a cartoon, and started laughing. “It’s not funny, Dean.” Sam said harshly “I can’t find my bag. I’m gonna be late!” he explained loudly as he dug through the coat closet next to the door. Dean stood up, walked to their table and gingerly picked up his brother’s leather shoulder bag. Sam glared at him and took his bag, sliding the strap over his shoulder. With a quick “Bye” he left, locking the door behind him.
Slowly, Dean began his morning routine very painully. Once he had his prosthetic securely in place he limped out into their living room to see Sam running around erratically like a chicken with it’s head cut off.
The dark haired veterinarian with the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen and the most perfect mouth. Dean began to imagine that mouth wrapped around his dick, blue eyes looking up at him, burning into his soul, as he licked, and sucked, and kissed, and stroked. Dean set the bottle down on his bedside table and palmed his growing erection. He quickly laid flat on his back, pulled the comforter back from his body and yanked his boxer shorts down, allowing his cock to spring free. Dean reached down, closed his eyes and wrapped his hand around himself.
Dean awoke suddenly to Cas sitting on his knees next to him, struggling to keep him from thrashing and punching. Grace sat next to his other side, on the floor, her head resting next to him on the mattress. She couldn’t respond as he was fighting so hard. All she could do was wait it out and help calm him down when she was able to.
The bomb did more than steal his leg, it scarred his entire body with burns. He felt like a creation of Dr. Frankensteins; missing limb, patches of wrinkled, scarred and mangled skin. And forget too rough sex... With RSD being the biggest cockblock. Dean knew the moment Cas saw his body,  and learned of his limitations, he would run for the hills. However, Castiel was so patient and gentle, they only stuck with making out and the occasional hand job from Dean despite Cas's urge to return the favor.
SMUT IS INVOLVED. Now, since this is in fact my first fic it is also my first time writing a sex scene of any kind. So, if you have any suggestions, especially in regards to light BDSM, please don't hesitate to send them my way. Also, the next chapter will involve nothing but Dean and Castiel.
Dean sat up, pushed the blanket back from his body, kicked his one good leg over to the side of the bed and looked down at his missing limb. He was at least thankful he still had his other leg. Grace brought him the prosthetic leg and he gingerly took it from the golden canine, praising her and giving her a quick scratch on the head. “Thanks, Gracie girl,” he murmured, reaching into his nightstand to pull out the rubber piece which goes over his stump, a sock band to go around the rubber piece and a spray bottle of alcohol.
Castiel fiddled with his now empty coffee cup, he must have finished it when Dean was telling his story. “Well, I come from a very conservative family. When I came out as gay, they weren’t pleased at first but slowly began to accept who I was and my partners.” Just then the waitress came with their food, Dean asked for a soda, Cas a glass of orange juice, and dug into his burger. “My brother, Gabriel, took it the easiest. I guess you would know that.” Cas smirked as he cut into his eggs, over easy, “You met him last night.” He took a bite of his eggs followed by a bite of his bacon. “Anyway, I had a pretty privileged childhood, which I am eternally thankful for.” The waitress returned with their drinks and Dean thanked her quickly, his eyes never leaving Castiel.
The nurse took Dean’s height and weight, her gaze reverting back and forth between her clipboard and Dean's service dog. She bit her lip, then proceeded to show Dean, Cas and Grace to the exam room. Dean handed Cas the leash and Cas took over handling Grace, with the instructions Dean had given him back at their apartment. Once they got in the room, Cas sat down and instructed Grace to go into a down, stay, head down on the floor, in the corner next to his chair. Dean slipped off his jacket and tossed it on the empty chair next to Cas. Once he sat down on the exam bed, the nurse began to pull out instruments, bandages, tape and a jar full of gauze pads soaking in alcohol. “The doctor will be in shortly,” is all she said before leaving the room and shutting the door behind her.
If Dean was being totally honest, the pain in his back was nearly just as bad as the pain in his leg. Which, up until then, he thought there could never be pain worse than the pain in his leg. Obviously, he was wrong. “I just need them to get this show on the road. I want this out of me.” Cas, worried, and now confused, just stared at Dean. “Dean. Just a few hours ago you were telling me you had never felt better. Now you’re having second thoughts? I don’t understand what’s happening here. What changed?” Dean didn’t look at him, his eyes stayed glued on the leash in his hand. The leather smooth, soft, the purple color helping him stay grounded. “Not right now, Cas. I can’t do this right now. It’s too much. After all I’ve been through. I don’t want to cause any other issues to deal with.” He bit his lip, a coppery tang annihilated his taste buds, which he just quickly licked away with a flick of his tongue.
Dean looked at the apparent brother of his dogs Veterinarian in disbelief “Okay, this is just way too trippy.” He muttered as he limped to the fridge, pulled out an ice cold beer, twisted the cap off and took a long swig all in one fluid motion.
Suddenly, Cas came with a shout. His cock pulsed in Dean's mouth as his come slid down his throat; Dean moaned in succession, which only caused Cas to release every last drop into his lovers mouth. Once his dick softened, Dean sat up, his lips swollen and glistening with spit and come, his cheeks flushed. Cas looked at him utterly spent and satisfied. "Dean..." His voice was the lowest Dean had ever heard, his eyes lust blown. Dean nearly came at the sight of him. "Dean, that was quite honestly the best blowjob I've ever had." Cas leaned in and kissed him, moaning softly as his taste intermingled with Dean's taste hit his taste buds.
When Dean tossed the small bottle of lotion in the drawer he caught a glimpse of an unopened bottle of whiskey laying on its side. Listening for any noise from Sam, Dean quietly reached for the bottle, broke the seal and took a long sip. The familiar burn in his throat and belly soothed his pain and stress. Images began filling his mind. Emily, Benny… wherever he was. The bastard broke his promise and never wrote or called. Dean took another swallow and leaned back against his headboard. Despite his thoughts, there was one thing he could not shake from his mind.
He curled his finger into a come hither motion and felt around until Dean reached down and gripped the sheets as he cursed; There it is. Castiel smirked and sucked Dean back into his mouth, this time bobbing his head up and down in slow, long motions. His tongue rubbing against the sensitive underside of Dean's cock each time he pulled his mouth upward. Dean's breathing became erratic and his chest began to turn a deep, bright red. Castiel started rubbing the pad of his finger solely against Dean's prostate and deepthroated his cock everytime his mouth went down the length of it. "Cas-" Dean panted, his hips thrusting ever so slightly but not enough to count as movement. "Fuck- Cas. right there. Oh, right there." Dean angled his ass in such a way that allowed Cas's finger to get deeper inside of him.
I am so shocked  this story is really making the rounds. I never thought it would be as supported and enjoyed as it has been. You guys have no idea how much that means to me. I also do read all of your comments, even though I may not always respond, I do read them. They mean so much to me. I wish I could hug every single one of you beautiful people. Just... thank you. For always supporting me and this story. More to come soon.
Dean sat in the waiting room of the doctors office, his back really starting to ache, the pump had run out of medication about one hour after he woke up. Just in time for the trial to end and the pump to be removed. Dean’s hands gripped both arm rests of his chair, his knuckles bright white from the intensity of his grasp. Grace laid under Dean and Cas's chairs in what was called a “tuck". It essentially keeps Grace out of the way and yet still able to be attentive to her handler if need be. Currently, however, the golden took this opportunity to take a quick snooze. There wasn’t much for her to do anyway, Dean wasn’t in immediate distress.
He grabbed Cas’s wrist, to which Cas stopped what he was doing and looked up at Dean in confusion “What’s wrong?” Dean didn’t answer, he just looked shocked. “Dean?” He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, squeezing gently. “Dean?” he repeated again, Dean came to and smiled widely “Cas…. I feel a little pain but, other than that, it doesn’t hurt like it did three days ago.” Tears actually rolled down Dean’s cheeks, he wasn’t sad, not at all. He was the opposite of that. He was ecstatic. “Cas. What if this actually works? What if this is the one thing that semi-works?” Cas slipped the leg sock on, then hooked his leg up to his thigh. “Well, statistics do say if the trial works substantially, the pain pump implant has a huge success rate thereafter.” Dean nodded, still smiling because for the first time in his entire life. He actually, truly felt hopeful.
“Well, yesterday I could tell you were lonely. I could see pain and desperation for friendship in your eyes.” Cas explained. He smiled and looked down, blushing. “My mother calls me an empath. She says I have a way of reading even the most complicated people.” He picked up his own coffee and took a sip. “So, I wanted to offer you something more. Yesterday, I couldn’t ignore you. You stopped my heart the moment I laid eyes on you as I walked through the exam room’s door. There’s something about you…” He looked away from Dean’s gaze, obviously embarrassed. “I should’ve taken into account you probably don’t lean in my direction. Correct?” Castiel’s utter look of defeat broke Dean’s heart.
The woman was young, no older than twenty seven, with long blonde hair, light blue eyes and a slim figure. She particularly gave her attention to Dean, standing straighter and pushing her chest out to accentuate her breasts. With slight bedroom eyes she asked for Dean’s order. He looked down at the menu he never closed “I’ll have…” he put his finger over the title of the meal “the Elvis Cheeseburger, extra onions.” He closed the menu and looked at Cas, once she wrote it down she looked at the other man, glancing at Dean often. “I’ll have the Zeppelin.”
The driver turned around and, with an aggravated attitude, explained loosely no dogs were allowed in the car. Dean pleaded with the man, showing his dogs injury, showing the large, thick shard of glass sticking out from her paw and ankle. The driver sighed and nodded slightly. Dean slid in, slammed the door and settled his dog carefully in his lap. The driver put the car in drive and sped off "Which vet?" the older man inquired. Dean struggled to keep himself together as flashbacks of Emily begin filling his mind "The closest vet you know."
Dean hummed at the touch. As he sucked, he rubbed his tongue along the side of Cas's cock. When he pulled up for air, a strong of pre-come mixed with saliva followed his mouth, attached to his swollen lips. He took a breath, opened his mouth wider and relaxed his esophagus as he pushed Cas's dick down the length of his throat. Cas let out a string of obscenities intermingled with Dean's name as his hips thrusted up into his mouth. The head prodded Dean in the back of the throat but, thankfully, he didn't have much of a gag reflex.
Castiel looked at Dean. Moving over to the other side of the exam table, he put his hand on his clients shoulder and looked him in the eye "Listen to me, Dean. This was not your fault. It was an accident. Accidents happen. It's our job to learn from them and move on. Your Grace looks to be in prestige condition, aside from the glass in her ankle and paw. You did not cause this." Dean looked at the man, it felt as if his blue eyes were looking straight into Dean's soul "Forgive yourself. She does." As Castiel said the last two words he nodded his head in the dogs direction.
Meg wasn't the same woman Dean had seen previously. She had dark eyes, dark curly hair and a Cheshire grin on her face as he walked up to pay his bill and collect his paperwork. "Alright, that'll be three hundred and fifty dollars, please." As Dean pulled out his wallet, he froze at the sound of the price "wait, that can't be right. He's doing more than that." The woman sighed and handed him the bill "Apparently he wants to do a lot for free, hot cakes." Dean threw her a slight glare as he quickly read over the bill. Sure enough, he was only paying for sedation, surgery and pain medicine. "Does he always offer free care?" Dean inquired as he handed Meg his credit card. She swiped it and handed him his card back and a receipt to sign, separating his copy from hers. "He sure does. He also volunteers at the local shelters, offers free spay, neuters and vaccines bi-monthly." Wow... So he's the Angel of Animals. Meg handed him a stack of paperwork "please fill this out and bring it back tomorrow. Thank you for choosing us." Dean nodded, slipping his credit card and Castiel's card in his wallet, sticking his wallet back in his jeans pocket, collected the paperwork, receipt and printed bjll and reluctantly left the clinic, and his dog, behind.
Dean awoke early the next morning to four loud knocks on his door. Castiel shot up from his chair beside Dean's bed and opened the door. A nurse came in pushing a small cart with a tray on top of it. The tray contained needles, test tubes, vials of pain medicine and a funny looking syringe filled with a clear drug. "Goodmorning Dean. My name is Hannah. I'll be your nurse for the day." Dean opened his mouth to speak and felt a strange tickling in his nose along with a sickly sweet plastic smell; he was being fed oxygen. "Why am I getting oxygen?" Dean questioned apprehensively, his fingertips touching the cannula. Castiel spoke this time, moving his way back to his chair beside Dean, "Last night, you were in a deep sleep. Your oxygen levels dropped exponentially due to the medication they've been giving you every few hours." The nurse put some latex gloves on with a snap and began to check his vitals and IV, "Narcotics, especially narcotics as strong as Dilaudid, can easily cause respiratory symptoms," she explained, "Your levels were below the 80's, Dean. That's extremely low for a man your age, size and weight. Your doctor will be in shortly to go over the game plan for your disease. In the meantime, we will keep managing your pain and help make sure you're comfortable, okay?" As she explained this, she got her supplies ready to draw blood. Dean watched and immediately began to panic; he always hated needles. "I had my blood drawn yesterday. Why are you doing it again?" Hannah smiled warmly and grabbed a packet of alcohol from the tray, "We're just making sure you dont have any infection or other abnormalities going on. The doctor wanted to check your white blood count due to your symptoms last night. I'll try to go quick but gently." She explained, seeming to hear the shakiness of panic in Dean's voice.
Cas shrugged. “To do that, I’d need a coffee grinder, access to freshly roasted beans, and either a French press or a gooseneck kettle and pour-over cone.”
P.S. Is Parcheesi difficult to understand? I dunno, I’ve never played it. The name just popped into my head, so I used it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The hunting part of their life was going strong, at least. As Dean and Cas got better as a fighting team, Sam took on more Men of Letters roles and spent most of his time at their home base (though still not
Dean groans but doesn’t move from his spot. He manages to get himself under control by the time Cas emerges from the steamy bathroom over half an hour later,
Then Dean says—with perhaps a hint of waver in his tone?—that these past few weeks have been good, that it’s been nice getting to breathe and just hang out and talk about inconsequential (word of the day) things. He says he might like to do it again sometime, and hope rises in Castiel like bubbling water in a fountain. He smiles and agrees that it has been nice, that it would be nice to have it again. But he doesn’t say
Castiel shakes his head. “No. Promise,” he adds when Dean looks at him sternly. “I feel restless and prickly, but nothing aches.”
“Not unless you want to summon a cupid and make them do your bidding. Or trap an angel without holy oil. Or rename a seraph. Or make Gabriel do the chicken dance while reciting the ‘Star Spangled Banner.’”
“Well, you did make us lug a huge shelf in here. I should do it the courtesy of filling it up,” Cas teased right back.
A moment later, the other side of the bed dips as Cas crawls under the covers. At least with the extra set Dean had to get last night, they’re not sharing blankets, which makes it slightly less weird. Except that he’s
Cas sighed. “I really would. It’s a pretty shitty system, isn’t it? Us being required to take vessels.”
Cas shakes his head as he slumps at the table. Sam has never seen Cas with such bad posture as in the past few weeks. It’s very strange, and very human. If they weren’t all so freaked out about what was wrong with him, he’d be glad to see Cas relaxing a little. The guy has had a rough time of it the last few years—well, they’ve all had, but he and Dean are used to it—and deserves having some time to really enjoy being on Earth. He vows to redouble his efforts to figure out what’s happening to his friend.
Dean glares at his annoying little brother. “When has the guy ever paid attention to personal space? I had no say in that.”
Dean sighs. “I dunno. Maybe? Or, maybe, after all this time, Earth is finally affecting him physically, not just emotionally.” He doesn’t really know what to think, and he hates that his hands are tied for now. They need to hurry up and catch this pied whatever before they disappear the entire city. Then they can focus on what’s going on with Cas.
Dean struggled to standing, groaning as his not yet healed elbow crunched in a very not good way. “What kind of Amazon puts an angel trap in her house?”
Dean doesn’t let himself think that it was his own presence in bed with him at the motel, not the sleep itself, that had settled him a little. They slept separately last night, because how does one ask their best friend if they want to platonically sleep together? They may be blurring the lines of personal space right now, but he doesn’t want to let himself hope. This could all go away as soon as Cas gets better—and he
“No! I mean, you’re molting, like birds do when they need to replace feathers. Like Attenborough said last night!”
They settled into a silence not too fraught, and after a while, he turned on the radio, which kept them company until their next gas stop.
ties are to you. What affects me, affects you. If you don’t want a surly teenager underfoot, we can try to talk her into going to Jody’s. But yeah, if you’re okay with having her here, I think that’s what I want. She’s not only my responsibility, but I think I
She shot him an unbelieving glance. “He’s an angel. His vessel is not his gender. Stop being so narrow minded.” She punched him on the arm, but then slid her hand up to grip his shoulder. “But in all seriousness, friend. I
“Damn it, you too, Garth?” Dean asked. He looked pleadingly at Jody. “Tell me you’re not involved, Sherriff.”
“Should we drop the hunt?” he asks, voicing his thoughts to Dean. His brother might not always be the most strategic thinker in the room, but he knows the most about their angel, and he should be the one to make the call. Then again, maybe he’s too close to make a good call.
Dean untangled one of their clasped hands to rub self-consciously at his neck. “I mean, I was kinda joking there. But, wow, I didn’t know you felt like that. You think I’m doing good? Because sometimes I feel like I’m doin’ it all wrong. I haven’t had a home since I was, like, four. I’m pretty clueless on how it all works. And I can’t manage to talk Sam into really moving in. Have you seen his bedroom? It’s practically as bare as the guest rooms.”
losing his grace again?” Sam runs a finger up the feather, and the rainbow shimmer follows the movement as light glances off it.
“Perhaps,” Cas says, trying to and failing to look cool and unaffected. Dean can see the pleased pride underneath it.
“Are you …” Dean begins softly. “Are you losing your grace again?” His eyebrows are furrowed and his lips pursed.
Smart girl. She was learning their weaknesses already and using them to flatter them, and to probably get whatever she was after. Despite knowing this, Dean lived to make those around him happy, so he went with it.
. And while he knows that angels in general and Cas in particular are capable of feeling and acting on sexual attraction, and he’s ninety-nine percent sure gender is not a deciding factor for them, it’s just not like that between him and Cas.
Sam literally face palmed and tiredly said, “Dean,” while Cas’s reaction was much more … reaction-y.
“Well, there doesn’t seem to be any connection between the missing people,” Sam explains. “Different ages, genders, races, economic statuses. They’re all in the metro area, but different neighborhoods. The only thing they seem to have in common is that they were all taken in their sleep. All but one live with other people, and no one sleeping in the same home heard or seen anything strange.”
He covers up his salivating with a protest. “Hey, no. Those are my clothes. Where’s your suit?” Dean can’t believe he’s actually fighting for that stupid get-up, but he can’t deal with seeing the being he’s been pining over for approximately a thousand years wearing his clothes. It makes a possessive monster crawl up into his chest, and he really can’t have that right now. Or ever.
Dean allowed himself a quick glance before looking back at the now-empty doorway. Cas had a frown on his face, and his shoulders were slumped. Dean wished yet again that he had a window into Cas’s deeper thoughts and feelings, rather than mouse tunnel to his momentary reactions.
Maybe he was about to tell Dean that he’d had enough, reached his limit. They’d manage this “marriage” as best they could, but from a distance, like divorced parents with joint custody. The thought made Dean feel sick again, and he was contemplating a dash for the nearest sink when he felt a tap on his forehead, the alcohol fog he’d worked on so hard disappeared, and the need to hurl (mostly) went away.
Sam sat down at the table and pulled Claire out of her quiet by talking about their library and archives, which led to a history of the Men of Letters and how the Winchesters had eventually acquired the space. He somehow made it sound dry, but Claire was interested enough, so Dean didn’t comment. Cas eventually came over to heat syrup and grab plates and silverware, and they worked around each other as seamlessly as they fought monsters.
Dean grinned. “We’ll have to do Indian sometime. You’ll love it. Want anymore?” He waved his fork at his plate.
If the results of this first hunt were anything to go by, they were good to start hunting again full time. Dean wondered if that was just an easy ghost, or if the hunt went far easier with the bond. Sam had practically stood back and watch during the actual fight, Dean and Cas working together like a well-oiled machine. And so they slipped back into their regular hunter lives. With Cas and Dean needing to be together for the bond, many easier hunts ended up being just the two of them, with Sam staying home and doing whatever he did with his big brain when he was alone. He took on a few easy hunts of his own but often seemed content to stay at the bunker when not needed out in the field.
They glare at each other for a few moments until Dean gets exasperated, stands up, and takes his dishes to the sink. As he’s furiously scrubbing dishes, he feels a presence and looks over to see a chagrined Cas standing next to him with a towel. He takes the dish Dean just finished rinsing and dries it.
When they pull apart a few minutes later, Dean grins in that way that used to make jealousy boil up in Castiel. The one where a beautiful woman flirted with Dean, and he lost all sense of cool as he drooled over the attention. But now that he is the cause of it, it makes Castiel’s stomach swoop with joy and maybe a little pride. He smiles back, and it’s probably just as goofy.
When he sat back down, Sam was explaining his findings of the afternoon as Cas sneaked another bite of Dean’s meal. Dean rolled his eyes and waved away the fork Cas sheepishly offered to him, holding up the new one he picked up on his way back to the table.
“Then everyone is happy, and all is right with the world.” Dean hugged Cas close to him again. He was telling the truth when he said he’d support Cas if he decided to get a new vessel, but he was relieved that wasn’t an issue. He did see Cas as this particular shape he inhabited—the blue eyes, the soft brown hair, the gentle smile, they were all a part Cas. They weren’t all of him, but they were a part.
“One jasmine tea, coming right up. See you in the library?” Once Castiel nods, he takes off for his bedroom.
Dean turned to face him full on. Dear God, what did Cas think he was, some ogre? Then a few recent memories flitted across his mind—him asking for space, being stubborn and staying away until they literally collapsed—they’d cleared up the second-hand store thing, but before then Cas had believed Dean didn’t care enough about him to pay for new clothes. Maybe Dean
Claire raised her eyebrows, and Dean decided they’d definitely get Charlie to the bunker soon. It had been a while since they’d seen her, and he missed her. And she hadn’t met Cas yet either.
“You know what? This is a lot to take in. I think I need a breather.” He stood up, and Cas mirrored the movement, reaching out a hand when Dean took a few steps back (
Sometime during the cleanup, Claire seemed to realize it was okay to smile around the adults, and so dinner was lighthearted and fun. Dean, Sam, and Cas shared hunting stories, and Sam and Cas went into the history of the bunker. After the crumble was devoured, they ended up in the TV room with the latest Marvel movie, during which Cas asked constant questions until Dean put a hand over his mouth to shut him up and then promised to put the entire Marvel movie canon on their list of movies to watch. Dean fought against his instinct to plant a kiss on his cheek for being so adorable and annoying. They weren’t there. Yet. But maybe … someday.
“So what do you think’s wrong with him?” Sam asks, crossing his arms on the roof of the Impala and watching Cas stomp around the path.
“We’ve got a few more books in the car that might have something,” Sam offers, “and I can do my usual internet checks.”
“So … Number one. I may have mistranslated a word, but it’s a super common problem. The two symbols are almost identical, and the handwriting is pretty sloppy in the book and …”
Not that Dean cared, because being with Cas was even better than Dean thought it would be. Sure, they bickered and disagreed, but he also got to see his angel with a big dopey grin just for him. And he got to see him first thing in the morning, soft and sweet. They found all manner of hidey holes, perfect for a lil’ make-out sesh or four. Now, more than ever, the bunker felt like home, and he’d be happy to live there forever, if Cas was there with him.
Cas takes up knitting, of all things, to keep himself from fidgeting. He’s a quick study, of course, and knits up three hats in just a few weeks, and he’s so proud of them that Dean doesn’t have the heart to tell him he’s not exactly a beanie guy. Sam takes to wearing his around the bunker as the weather turns chilly, and Dean has to admit it’s an improvement over the ridiculous hair, though still just as douchey.
, he hears in that annoying tune from his childhood. He’s contemplating bed when Cas shuffles into the library, looking forlorn and clutching, weirdly, a knitting book.
Things have been tense in the bunker for the last week or so, what with Cas still being extra irritable. And his grumpiness is making Dean grumpy, which is just not fair. He should be happy right now. No one is dying, the world isn’t ending, and he’s got his favorite people with him. But Cas has made him feel restless and annoyed, and he’s taken to cleaning out the storerooms and archives to cope. Sometimes Cas joins him, until they start bickering too much, and other times Sam does, but mostly Dean’s been working alone. He’s found a few cool things to add to the bunker’s décor and a few other artifacts that Sam and Cas have nerded over. The rest of his time is spent cleaning. The place doesn’t get dusty—because magic?—but the more trafficked areas do need floors mopped and tables wiped down, and it gives him something to do. Still, he was relieved when Sam found them a nearby case yesterday. Dean (and he suspects Cas) could use the distraction.
Dean vowed to get her and Kevin to hang out more, seeing that she’d dropped that mask when he was around. She needed to interact with someone closer to her age.
They ended up with the cardigan, both pairs of jeans, a couple of Henleys, the blue t-shirt plus two others, another t-shirt and soft flannel pants for pajamas, the flannel shirt he’d tried on first, and a surprisingly fancy and soft cashmere sweater in a dark green. They also picked up a coat on their way to the register. Dean got a tiny little kick from spoiling Cas, but he kept that thought to himself.
“I read only sincerity from him; he truly seems to want to learn and help. I will keep an eye on him, but I think we’re safe.”
Claire stayed almost two weeks, to the surprise of everyone in the bunker, including Claire. Dean thought it was because she was enjoying actually learning how to be a hunter. If she only had two hunts under her belt, plus a few assists she’d managed with other hunters she’d bumped into, the whole idea of being a hunter was probably still overwhelming, but she seemed committed to the career, so they all vowed to teach her what they could while she would allow it.
“There is a custom among the newly married in the Western world. To go on a trip together. Following the wedding.”
She turned to him and rested her hip on the edge of the counter. “Dean, full nosy offense, but, why are you and Cas always around each other these days? He’s been at the bunker for months, even though he’s an angel and doesn’t need to sleep or eat or anything. I mean, I get that you two are BFFs or whatever, and that he’s a bit persona non grata with Heaven these days, but, like, he’s
Panicked eyes – check, bed head – check, flushed face – check, hard dick – fuck. He strips and jumps under the coldest water he can stand while he gives himself a pep talk. He can’t do this. This is
He met Dean’s eyes in alarm, and Dean shrugged, letting his confusion trickle into their bond to show he was just as surprised as Cas was. They were so used to the bond by then that it barely took half a thought to have a subliminal conversation on Claire’s sudden appearance. Cas had no clue Claire was looking for him, and he was just as baffled as to where her mom could be. They decided to sit her down and figure out what was going on. All of this was decided in a matter of seconds, and with nary a word spoken. Cas went to find Sam.
Cas immediately angel changed into the cardigan combo Dean had liked so much as they headed for the grocery store. It was moving toward late afternoon and Dean was flagging a bit. Weird that he could hunt for days and be fine, but an afternoon of shopping near killed him. He was ready to be back home, in front of their new TV, and rubbing shoulders on a couch with Cas. It was a pipe dream, though, as he knew they’d be camping out in the library for the foreseeable future trying to find some answers to the bond problem. Maybe they could move a couch into the library so they could at least be comfortable while they worked.
Despite the bond, he could never get a good read on Cas’s feelings for him. Or perhaps he was too scared to really look. It took a bit of concentration to feel out the deeper-seated emotions in each other. They could easily feel momentary spikes of surface feelings without trying, and he’d gleaned that Cas was certainly very fond of Dean, but that was to be expected of best friends. He also knew that Cas was perfectly content spending the rest of Dean’s life by his side, but they’d already talked that out months ago as well.
He still spent the night awake reading or on the internet, but he’d gotten into the habit of lying down to chat until Dean fell asleep. It had been difficult for Dean at first, allowing himself to touch Cas in a less than platonic way (well, more than the hand holding they already did), afraid the close contact would put thoughts into his head that ended up with him accidentally cuddling Cas in his sleep and popping a boner he couldn’t hide.
meant temporary doesn’t mean temporary? Then what the hell does it mean? Oh fuck.” He rubbed his temple. “Let me guess. It’s the exact fucking opposite of
“Yeah, well. One, I think you wear a size smaller than me, so we should get you something that fits a little better, and two, don’t you want something that’s a little more … you?”
