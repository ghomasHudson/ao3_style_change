He had slept a couple of hours when he heard someone moving in the room and then a warm and familiar body slid under the covers next to him. Sherlock snuggled up to him and pressed a gentle kiss to John’s neck. John wasn’t sure if he was dreaming, but either way it was a pleasant way to drift back to sleep.
“I was drugged for a while. I do feel better now.” Then he remembered his arm. He lifted his hand and John’s eyes widened at the blood on his fingers. But when he wanted to clean it away, Sherlock shook his head and pointed at the cut.
Sherlock often dreamt vividly during those times, and now and then mumbled or even talked in his sleep. Used to his weird antics, neither of the men in the kitchen reacted much when he suddenly sat up and said very clearly to no one in particular, “No, that is not how you construct a tangent to two circles!”
“Never mind!” Sherlock shook his head. “I know they will be on the list!” He tipped his imaginary hat and left the library, feeling quite accomplished, even though he wasn’t yet sure why. The tattoos were the link after all, but for a different reason than he had believed. If he had held the entire leaflet in his hand, he was fairly sure that it would have featured a print of “Make a Wish.” All victims were linked to … well, George, or body number 4.
The blade was now pressed against Sherlock's jugular and therefore it seemed appropriate to pay attention to it.
I am also not sure if this chapter makes much sense. *hands the whole shebang to Days of storm with a shrug and a helpless smile*
“You know, when the murders initially happened, I collected evidence about sightings of Santa Claus,” he leaned back in his chair and licked his lips. John began eating again, feeling a little more at peace with the world. “There had been six seperate sightings of flats in which strange shoe prints were found on carpets. In some cases, the biscuits and milk that children had left on the window sill had been consumed. It was generally thought that someone was playing a trick on them, trying to get them to believe in Santa. Possibly just unrelated instances of parents trying to convince their children that a stranger would fly around the world in a single night and leave them gifts to find in the morning in exchange for sweets. But, those parents always refused to admit to that. This means that the murderer might have had a choice of victims.”
Sherlock sighed and pressed his face against John’s shoulder. He knew they probably wouldn’t leave the bed tomorrow and he was absolutely and one hundred percent fine with that. “Good night, John.”
The librarian had risen from behind the counter and came to stand next to him, trying to really very quietly shout at him. Sherlock decided that he couldn’t be bothered and simply stepped around him and towards the public announcement board. Most of the leaflets on the photograph were still pinned to the wall, so it couldn’t have been very long since it had been taken.
When John was done, Sherlock grabbed his hand and pulled him closer, without touching anything but his hand. John didn’t like being touched when he was angry.
The next morning started with a phone call, which resulted in rushed tea, no toast, and banging doors. 48 minutes later they had gathered in a flat in Chiswick.
“I mean, why should I? What would I gain from it? Do you think because you show me your house and your little collection of bodies and you admit to your obsession with me, I would feel the need to kill you? I don’t know how all of this works for you, but I’m not getting off on killing people. I’m not compulsive like you.”
“Sherlock,” John beckoned him to come and see what he saw, but when Sherlock had taken the few steps to the window, the figure was gone.
Chocolamouse said the following in her comment on chapter 17: "I bet next time this blade is mentioned it will be something like, "The blade was now pressed against Sherlock's jugular but it was boring so he didn't pay attention.""
John’s stance loosened and Sherlock knew that he would be forgiven. Some groveling might be necessary and some show of goodwill. Oh! He just had the perfect idea of what to do!
Sherlock gave him a look of disdain. “If you did, you would drop your weapon now and let them arrest you. The game is over. You’ve played your hand and you did not win.”
Predictably, the former urge won over, as it so often did with Sherlock. “The announcement board,” he started and Sherlock leaned back in his seat, his fingers unconsciously finding the cut in his coat. Another spark of hatred pierced his mind, sobering him up further.
The voice was smooth and the man it belonged to was tall, dark-haired and had astoundingly grey eyes.
John managed not to laugh until they had left the crime scene and Lestrade had forced Sherlock to wrap a shock blanket around himself so the police car that was taking them home - instead of going to the third crime scene - wouldn’t forever carry a sooty imprint of Sherlock’s arse on the backseat. His coat had been carefully wrapped in a plastic bag, as per Sherlock’s instructions. He was clearly more worried about not getting his coat dirty than any other thing in the world.
Oh, now things were finally getting interesting! Sherlock sat back down, again ignoring the blade that was now in the man’s hand.
“In any case, we might have a copycat on our hands here,” he grinned and rubbed his own hands gleefully.
link between the victims. I am sure that if we get all the details from the other crime scenes, the more obvious pattern will be found in the “Make a Wish” slogan.
John looked from Lestrade to Anderson and back, entirely flabbergasted. “It’s a Christmas miracle,” Lestrade suddenly burst out and raised his arms over his head. “Hallelujah. That I would live to see the day!”
"What is it?" said John, glancing over to the photo in Sherlock's hand. He didn't notice what made the picture special at first, but suddenly he became aware of a slight oddness in the features of the man lying on the stretcher (well, as odd as it could be compared to the other depicted dead people).
The teacher blushed a little. ‘Seriously’, thought John, ‘what kind of student could make teachers blush? That was just abnormal.’
"Oh. Right." Sherlock looked disconcerted. "Why didn't I think of that", he muttered under his breath. John looked at him and laughed. "You got it from the lung and heart? I would never have guessed that! I recognized the teeth from my uncle. He's a goddamn chain smoker. It's horrible. You can probably smell him from here."
Sherlock looked at him. "Yes. What would I want with the people down there?" Well, scratch the part about not being a snob. But it also made John sad to hear that the other boy was such a loner. He'd known that, but now it bothered him.
"I'm curious, when did you put it in my bag? It must've been either in arts or music, right?" John laughed at the other boy's inquisitiveness. Of course, it'd bug him that something escaped his notice.
“How can you live with yourself?” Were those tears in the man’s eyes? Sherlock swallowed, wondering how close to having the blade run straight into his chest he was. “How can you waste your mind, your brilliance?”
Sherlock tried to keep his eyes open. He should not have accepted the offer of a tumbler of brandy, but he knew he would have been in greater danger had he refused. He was utterly exhausted. Outside, the first grey light peeked over the horizon. The view was actually quite something, he found, wondering whether, if he ever grew tired of London, he’d be able to live in a house with a view. Maybe the southern coast? With a lovely garden and a handful of boxes for beekeeping. John would bring tea outside and they could sweeten it with their own honey.
Sherlock gave an eyeroll that was fonder than it appeared at first glance, and ducked back into the living room, calling over his shoulder: “As I stated previously, I don’t care. But if we could refrain from further dissecting my sexuality, or lack thereof, in our
And there are only so many times that a man, even as patient a man as John Watson, can allow himself to be misidentified without wanting to do something about it.
“I do love Sherlock,” he said, and he wasn’t so drunk that he didn’t instantly regret saying it, and he felt a blush rise immediately to his cheeks. He should stop now. Just take it back and change the subject.
Sherlock put on such a front for the rest of the world. He seldom presented himself without a full suit of armour (minus that one trip to Buckingham Palace). John always felt oddly privileged to see Sherlock like this: unadorned, unconcerned. Content.
The case was solved within a matter of days. It was done up in dramatic form, with Sherlock and John arriving just in time at a crime scene-to-be. It looked like it would have been a right fucking mess: the murderer, one Andrew Hollingsworth, was using a basement in an abandoned apartment building, where he’d set up gurneys and a barrage of medical equipment. The victims were laying on the gurneys, out cold, and Hollingsworth was about to cut into the first when John and Sherlock arrived. John promptly levelled his Sig Sauer at the man, whilst Sherlock cuffed him. It had then been left to John to see to the victims, relief and a second wave of adrenaline washing over him when he found that both of them had strong, steady pulses.
John considered this, sipping from his pint of Stella. Greg wasn’t wrong. Though John didn’t necessarily think the idea of soul mates was rubbish, that was a can of existential worms he was not prepare to open, and he certainly didn’t need the term applied to him and Sherlock.
John blinked in surprise. Sherlock brought his tea back to his mouth and took a soundless sip. He continued to watch John with the same frank blue gaze, nearly unblinking. It would have been unnerving, if not for the fact that . . . well, it was Sherlock. And, for John, Sherlock’s intense stare was not the threat that most people perceived. It was. . . .
“Because . . . I don’t like people telling me what I am or am not. Or what you are, for that matter. It’s aggravating.”
The tone of the question was gentler than John had expected, and when he looked into Sherlock’s face, there was a genuine and un-snide curiosity there.
, and she placed John’s hands where they needed to be and went about the rest of her work while John listened to the sounds of equipment beeping, the sirens wailing, watching the pale, pale, too pale face of Sherlock as they raced for the hospital. . . . .
Two days later, John entered the inpatient ward of Bart’s hospital. He had a messenger bag with Sherlock’s laptop and several books, and a handful of flowers—
There was security detail from NSY posted outside Sherlock’s hospital room, and he nodded and stepped aside as John approached. John had practically lived in that room for the first twenty-four hours, and had made damn well sure that he was allowed back without question.
what John had meant to say, and it seemed to catch Sherlock off-guard as well. He didn’t stiffen, or give any indication that he was uncomfortable; but he did stop typing, which told John that he had Sherlock’s full attention.
John sighed. He suddenly felt very heavy, just thinking about it. “You know, I’m starting to be baffled myself.” He brought a hand up and ran it once over his face. The force of four beers had hit him in full: his head was beginning to spin a bit, and he was bloody tired. “Fuck.”
Sherlock turned the page, still not looking up. In a bored (and slightly annoyed) tone, he asked: “Whatever do you mean?”
John clicked to the next channel. A reporter in a bright yellow dress was standing in a torrential gale trying to make the most of it.
John was just beginning to contemplate how pathetic that seemed when Sherlock, with a shrug and lassiez-faire that was almost shocking, said, “All right, then.” He gestured to the hallway leading to the stairs. “After you.”
Which is how, sometime later in the month of February, after having been assaulted with Valentines’ well-wishes and snide remarks from much of New Scotland Yard on a case earlier in the month, Sherlock came into the kitchen holding John’s laptop aloft, his eyebrow raised.
am not bothered by what other people think of us. As far as I’m concerned, we are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson and, whatever that means, the rest of the world can bugger off.”
Before he could think better of it, John blurted: “I feel like I’m trampling over ground that needs to be tread softly.”
Seeming to grow bored with John’s fumbling, Sherlock pushed back his chair and stood, taking his mug of coffee with him as he exited the kitchen. As John sat at the kitchen table, stewing in his own embarrassment and horror, he heard Sherlock set down the mug, and then the sound of him picking up his violin. A bow was drawn experimentally over strings once, twice.
Carefully, with a measured voice, Sherlock finally replied, “I don’t think that I have ever felt grand, sweeping romantic devotion to someone, if that is what you are asking.” He paused here, his voice growing quieter. “Of other kinds of love, perhaps.” He paused again. “I think I loved Victor.”
John was unsurprised to learn that his own knowledge of anything to do with non-heteronormative sex or relationships was relatively shallow. He was, however, surprised at the sheer breadth of terms people applied to themselves, their sexualities, their gender identities, and their relationships. Sexuality and romantic leanings were both spectra, he was aware; but the internet, or the denizens therein, seemed to have attempted to define every pinpoint on the spectra with a term or series of terms. Surely, John thought, scrolling through pages, there was something that he could apply to him and Sherlock.
Comforting. To know that he had Sherlock’s attention entirely. To know that Sherlock was, in a rare move, content to remain silent, interested to hear what John might say next. It was a courtesy—no, not a courtesy. It was a gift Sherlock gave almost no one.
“I don’t think Sherlock believes in souls,” he said by way of reply. “You know. He’s a scientist and all that.”
Sherlock continued to watch John. He had drawn the coffee mug away from his mouth, but the sight of it gave no further clues as to Sherlock’s inner machinations. He looked as cerebral and bilious as ever.
The silence that followed that statement set upon the kitchen so swiftly, it was as if someone had turned down the volume. It seemed that even the birds outside stopped their squawking momentarily.
John cleared his throat, suddenly, feeling something warm settle in his chest. He blinked, breaking Sherlock’s intense gave and looking back down at his eggs. He took up his fork again, unable to help the smile that curled around his lips.
John couldn’t help but give a quiet chuckle at that, which caused Sherlock to shift until John squeezed his ankle reassuringly. “Puppy love,” John said softly.
It bothered John in a way he couldn’t explain. Shouldn’t have to explain? It was annoying as all hell to be constantly and consistently misinterpreted—almost wilfully, as in the case of Mrs. Hudson, bless her. John was a relatively easy-going bloke (a quality which made living with Sherlock at all possible), and there were times when he knew it was a lost cause and hurting very little to let people carry on with their assumptions. A part of him gets it, he really does: what he has with Sherlock is . . . intense. Unpredictable. Devoted. In short, it has been the most important relationship of John’s life, and it continues to be so. Sherlock surprises, consternates, delights, and knows John in ways that (as he has come to suspect and accept) a potential romantic partner may never do.
However, whilst DI Lestrade definitely fell into the category of NSY, Greg the drinking buddy was fair game, and John found himself bringing up his latest predicament over pints a week later.
When he entered, Sherlock was laid back on the bed. As John approached, Sherlock’s closed eyelids flickered. And, as John sat down, they finally cracked open, the blue of them appearing almost too bright in the harsh hospital lighting. Sherlock licked his lips.
So, John went about his research and exploration. And, jesus, did he unearth a whole world of terminology he never knew existed.
When he came downstairs a few minutes later, dressed in his cosiest, oatmeal-coloured jumper (the one that Sherlock occasionally stole when it was especially cold), he was met with the sounds and smells of breakfast being prepared. He found Sherlock in the kitchen, scrambling eggs and making toast and tea. John felt his eyebrows nearly disappear into his hairline. Sherlock cooking wasn’t an
The kettle went off and John found himself walking over to remove it from the flame. He saw that Sherlock had already put out two cups with tea bags, and so John poured the hot water and took the cups to the table. He got jam and milk from the refrigerator and set them at the table and forks from the cutlery drawer. Only then did he sit down himself.
, I won’t stop you from trying, and will give an opinion on whatever you come up with, if requested.”
Sherlock shook his head. John could see the drugs still clouding his mental faculties, and Sherlock’s annoyance at them. “Not much. Gallery. Chase. Cezanne painting. Pain in my abdomen.” He brought a hand up and placed his fingers gently on the edge of the gauze. He looked up at John. “Bad?” he questioned.
“Not patently obvious to everyone,” John pointed out, spearing one of his kippers. He had made a large batch this morning and, though Sherlock insisted he wasn’t hungry, small pieces kept disappearing from John’s plate when he wasn’t looking. There was also more syrup on John’s plate than he remembered putting there in the first place.
And, maybe it was because he was tipsy, or maybe it was because he was just so used to being able to say
“Person’lly,” Greg said after they had settled back into their seats, “I find that love is like an orgasm.”
Sherlock swept further into the kitchen, his blue silk dressing gown fluttering around him, before settling into the chair opposite John and reading aloud, “’More than best friends’?  ‘Nonsexual partnership? ‘Intense male friendship’?”
The next morning, John awoke with what he might call a very wee, very insignificant hangover. He groaned as he turned over, mostly for the sake of groaning. He was more than a little surprised to find a tall glass of water and paracetamol on his bedside table.
to be burdening Greg with all this. He and Sherlock were stuck in the middle of a case that didn’t seem to be going anywhere and Sherlock was being almost insufferably moody: playing long, wandering pieces on the violin and running experiments at all hours in the kitchen. The experiments were fairly contained, and the music was beautiful (as per), but there was only so much John could reasonably take of Sherlock’s sulking. Especially since he couldn’t
Sherlock was quiet for a moment. John was even more aware of his hand resting casually on Sherlock’s ankle.
Later, as they were both (respectively) going to bed, John looked up on his phone a term that he had read several days ago:
The thought stayed with him for some time, as did the ghost of the feeling. That overwhelming rush of sensation in the heat of the moment, which faded into a quiet sense of comfort once they were back at the flat. The strange, easy feeling which John now recognized as utter contentment when he and Sherlock were simply sitting in the same room. It felt familiar to John.
“Tha’s fine. You don’t ‘ave to be. Being in love’s overrated,” Greg slurred, though just slightly. “But even if you were, iss your fucking business. You don’t owe anyone an explanation.”
Sherlock met his gaze as he reached the top of the stairs. He quirked an eyebrow, and John grinned sheepishly.
“Morning,” John said as he entered the kitchen. He stood next to the kitchen table, suddenly unsure if he should sit down.
do something about it, as some cases would have it. Maybe nothing needs to be done. No change necessary.”
romantically involved. And he was staring at the TV listlessly, contemplating this, when Sherlock piped up:
inclined towards women. However, the notion that it was possible, and not really all that uncommon, for a “straight” person to have romantic feelings for someone of the same gender . . . well, it gave John a lot to think about. A good deal of self-reflection was in order.
There were several articles he had come across in his earlier Google searches that he had, originally, cast aside, thinking them non-applicable and uninteresting. However, he returned to them anew with something akin to trepidation.
Sherlock, knew him more profoundly than he had ever known another human. It often felt that there were no secrets between them, but this conversation was causing John to realize that there were, perhaps, boundaries that they had not yet pushed with each other, places in each other’s minds that they had not explored. Were they ready for such a thing?
But he always assumed—possibly, up until this very moment—that, because he was only sexually attracted to women, he was therefore also only
.” His eyes drifted from John’s face, towards the blue flowers on the bedside table. A dark brow rose. “Flowers?”
— immeasurably heightened. He was both pleased and disturbed when, with complete insouciance, Sherlock stretched one of his legs over John’s knees in an almost possessive manner. This, too, was not entirely unusual, nor was John placing his free hand over Sherlock’s socked ankle whilst his other clicked the remote.
Sherlock kept his attention on the eggs, but offered his own “morning” in response. Sherlock was still dressed for bed, his white undershirt rumpled and his blue dressing gown hanging off his narrow frame. His hair was wild, curls spilling everywhere. He was barefoot.
“I was. I made them let me come with you.” John licked his lips, glancing back at the entrance where the NSY guard was. “I, uh, may have told the paramedic that we were . . .”
The thought was clear, even while the sights and sounds surrounding John were not. His vision was unfocused, dizzying. He could see the flashing lights of NSY, the large white outline of an ambulance. He could hear sirens, but they seemed to be underwater. Someone was accosting him, trying to talk to him, but—
John nodded, something like relief flooding him. “Great.” And then, because he could think of little else to say and desperately wanted to change the subject. “Toast?”
He can’t speak for Sherlock but, to him, this definition felt fitting in its ambiguity. However, he admitted to himself as he climbed into bed, he doubted that the term would do much to clear up their public perception. And he definitely wouldn’t be using it within earshot of New Scotland Yard.
The paramedic gave John a significant look, which then passed briefly over to the prone form of Sherlock, face hidden by an oxygen mask. After a moment of hesitation, she said, “Fine, get in.”
Sherlock frowned and, surprising John, stood up from the table. He walked over to where John was leaning and didn’t stop until he was right in John’s space. The wrinkle from earlier made a reappearance and, this close up, John could see clearly the dark circles forming under Sherlock’s eyes. But the eyes themselves were clear and alert, and he surveyed John intently.
John paused in his eating. Sherlock’s gaze was pensive, evaluating. He looked like he might be about to say something. John set his fork down, feeling his heartbeat pick up a few ticks.
And, with that, any tension that had lingered in the air dissipated, and it was like any other morning at 221B Baker Street. Sherlock took another drink from his tea before pulling apart the paper and handing John the sports section. They finished their breakfast mostly in silence, Sherlock occasionally piping up to ridicule a political figure or two. Once they were both done with breakfast, Sherlock left the table and wandered into the living room. As John dutifully cleared away their plates and began the washing up, he heard the sound of a violin being tuned, and soon after the first slow notes of one of the few pieces Sherlock had taught him to recognize: Elgar’s
In a slow and deliberate manner, Sherlock folded the paper and set it on the table. He picked up his Bart’s mug with both hands, and took a purposeful drink of his coffee. He then looked at John over the rim of the mug, which hid his mouth as he locuted in the most exquisite deadpan:
The question caught John off guard. Truth be told, he had gotten side-tracked by terminology to define their individual . . . well, beings that he somewhat neglected his original search. “Bromance?” he hazarded.
“Well, if I ever got another girlfriend, it would be their business too. But maybe that’s a big If.”
John set down his mug of tea, considering. He hardly got angry any longer at Sherlock commandeering his laptop— boundaries were something that Sherlock was still working on and, besides, there was little that John could hide from Sherlock at any rate. Sherlock could read him like anything, and did so regularly and with a gusto that could only be explained by fondness, even if the results were sometimes (or often) irritating. He was so used to Sherlock being inside his head that it didn’t occur to him to delete his browsing history after his search.
After a few seconds, Sherlock began typing again, and the sound lulled John into the sense of ease that had previously enveloped them. He had just landed on a crime docu when something made him ask.
had just swallowed a mouthful of lemon juice, and promptly shoved a hand over John’s mouth to keep him quiet. So, John nixed that one.
It didn’t matter how or how many times he said it, people just seemed not to get it. Even his slew of girlfriends (who, though their association was short-lived, usually had ample and earnest example of his heterosexual inclinations) exited the relationship with the accusation, almost admonition:
true? Do you even know? Maybe instead of defining it for other people, you ought to define it for yourself. Assuming
But, as is wont to happen when going down a rabbit hole, the search for a term that defined them both inevitably lead to a search for terms that defined them each. John was quite comfortable labelling himself a white, cis, heterosexual male, though it seemed to have some ugly connotations across the web, and it was a bit of a mouthful to say out loud. When he brought this up to Sherlock over breakfast one morning, Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow at him over the edge of the newspaper.
about Sherlock. And everything else. And, by the time they were finishing their second pint, John was spilling to Greg this “new”
“That’s only the Winchesters and Cas -- where is Sherlock?” John asked in a panicked voice. He turned to Gabriel, who had a smug expression of doom on his face, his eyes glinting with nostalgic mischief.
“Of course, why else do you think I keep calm living here? Nothing can surprise me, dear. I wasn’t born yesterday.”
Sherlock popped his lips and hissed a breath. First things first, he didn’t really care much how he referred to him. They’re going to be here for less than two months now, why bother? He’ll probably never see the man again. Second, he didn’t bother remembering Lestrade’s first name, even though the rest of the house called him by that name constantly. It wasn’t relevant to anything Sherlock took interest in. But… would John think of him less for this? He didn’t want that. Granted, he still didn’t care, but what will John think if he comes clear?
The vending machine slid back into its place once he reached the bottom of the stairs and the elevator at its end. Crickets were creaking in the grass under the moonlit sky outside.
“There’s no point in going outside the castle either, by your logic,” Mycroft said patiently. “What is there to see during the night?”
A doubtful look. “Fat chance. No presents, mind you. A wish is enough. Welp, I’ll go close up the museum before Sally gets here. Have reasonable fun at the quarry!”
It’d be much more enjoyable with John by his side, Sherlock thought. He rested his chin on his palm, biting a fry in half, chewing on it sadly. He doesn’t have to be ashamed about wanting John, needing him nearby almost constantly. He’s gotten too comfortable, perhaps, but his world didn’t feel complete without the blond, bloody charming Canadian that accompanied Sherlock on their adventures.
“But, Greg!” Philip Anderson, the local news (trash) reporter, said. He showcased him two t-shirts he liked especially well. “There is an important distinction between ravens and crows! How can you expect me to make a decision when both birds are equally fascinating?”
The windowsill on which he leaned creaked under his weight. The wood was old and the protective layer of wax was peeling off. John picked at it, crumbling the flakes between his thumb and forefinger. “I’m not sure,” he murmured. “I want to make sure Sherlock doesn’t brush me off as a dumbass. I do have a suspicion but, well. I need proper proof.”
“We have to smoke that bitch out,” Dean added, shuddering. Irene wasn’t sure she understood but she let it pass. She’ll have more time to inquire once the call ends and she will ask John. Or she’ll wait for when they visit.
Harry’s gaze wondered about; his eyes settled on a skull resting on the rim of the fireplace, its empty sockets impaling a point in the distant corner of the room. A car honked somewhere in the streets and a clock ticked away slowly, bidding its time.
“Irene and Kate are trying to make use of the nacho sauce machine, but I strongly advise against eating anything that comes out of it,” Sherlock said, apparently bored by the deep sound of his baritone. He glanced at Sarah, who kept typing away at her phone. “Sarah keeps tweeting about the latest episode of the Kardashians, and Irene also revived a slurpee machine right there.”
“Not all of us can dance in stilettos to deal with their dead husbands,” Greg snorted. He continued, desperate to change the topic. “Actually -- when do you want to visit Frank’s grave?”
“Not that I don’t like cuddling you, but it’s getting warmer and I’m sweating bullets,” Sherlock said, shattering their bubble of comfort. John extricated himself from him and Sherlock cursed his stupidity. “No -- I didn’t mean I don’t want you here, just --”
“I engage just fine on such Friday nights, thank you very much,” she grinned and turned her body on the seat so that she could face him. She sat on her legs, leaving dusty footprints on the fabric. “At least my
“You don’t, but I will do it, watch me. Us, whatever. You’re not alone in this, know that. That’s real, if nothing else is.”
He never saw himself as a believer, but Sherlock wasn’t that shocked by the revelation either. But when you have eliminated the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. And besides, they needed data to work with in order to find out what happened to Castiel, and as much as it was unfortunate, it was also intriguing -- would others of his kind show up? Would they have amnesia?
“You had a brother?” John repeated, startled by the knowledge. Sherlock straightened his back and angled himself so that he faced John. “Sorry, didn’t want to sound accusatory. You just never said.”
Sherlock put away the last glass from the drying rack and closed the cabinet above the counter. He looked at John, his gaze soft, only a little sign of heat behind the colourful irises. John sucked in a breath and went to sit besides Greg. He tapped a finger on the wood.
“No, you don’t,” John snapped, straightening everyone’s back. “Take the day off. Put up a maintenance sign. Just… self-care, alright? Crash on the couch for all I care, but get some rest. Please. Sherlock and I are taking Cas out on the town to show him around, so it’ll be quiet in here. Kate and Irene can have a gossip meeting in the attic, and Mrs Hudson moves around like a mouse. Please, Greg.”
John leapt up the ladder, Irene and Alex cheering him on while Cage charged at him akin to an enraged bull in Spain. Cage almost caught John’s ankle, but his rigid legs gave out and he slumped down, his head hitting the ladder steps with precise rhythm.
“Alright, alright,” Irene interrupted before it got out of hand. “How about you and Will and the rest make a list? Hold on, you don’t have paper or pen…. Never mind that. I’ll get you some basic stuff and we will figure out from there what we can afford to get you, okay?”
started to like him more. Just a tiny bit. “Alright, we’ll pack it right away. I’ve had enough of those bitches fucking with my family for one day, let’s go. I know what we’ll do.”
"Now, with the hard news behind us, allow me to introduce you to our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dartenyll." The Headmaster motioned towards the seat of a young woman, probably in her forties, she stood up and bowed as the students clapped for her. Dumbledore turned to the students one last time, "I think I bored you enough for today, let us feast."
’. “If anything, we can have a good laugh. I don’t know her, but your implications point to her being a little cray-cray.”
“Yeah, but I like when you wear my clothes. C’mon, Cas will make sure Irene’s fine while we’re gone.”
The mother sniffed at his leg, licking the denim for residual grease and lingering scent of potatoes. Sherlock used his right hand that was in her field of vision to offer for a sniff, which she accepted. She let him pet her, and he was tactful in his administrations of affection. So much of that has built up over the last week he found that channeling it to two homeless dogs was an adequate outlet. Besides John, of course.
worker. ‘Worker’ - well, he’ll actually move up from a mere pawn of a graduate into some higher positions, no doubt about that. Sometimes, Sherlock missed his older brother in ways he couldn’t describe, and neither would admit to. It’s been a long time since they had a lighthearted moment.
“Hi,” John forced through his frozen smile, eyes darting to Sherlock’s silver irises for a split second.
“Perhaps the island distorted time while Gloria was still possessing it,” Sherlock said, finger taping his chin.
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering what path his life took to find himself in Oregon managing a scamfest of entertainment, countless feet underground, wrought out and tired. At least he wasn’t alone. John was still coming back, basically moved in already for some time, and he got Sherlock and Irene under his protective scrutiny. And they had Hudders and the lovely dogs too.
“You two are like Dumb and Dumber, but enhanced to modern Canadian-British edition,” Irene fake cried over their disheartening pining. “Have you
Mrs Hudson informed Irene that the mill was on a small river and no longer used ever since the owner had died decades ago, even though apparently it was a picturesque sight to behold. The top of its roof appeared the moment that Irene reached the top of a medium sized hill, dust from the road sneaking into her shoes. She looked at the time: 12:55. She wasn’t late, thankfully.
“Hello, John,” Mycroft said, giving him a well-practised polite smile. He stepped aside to reveal Sherlock in his entirety, arms crossed and sulky. “As per your invitation, Sherlock is here for the three work days and the whole weekend of your sleepover. I had to ensure he arrived safely, you see.”
Rowena sighed, and John looked at Sherlock to confirm they were doing it. They inched closer to a big flat rectangular object over which an even bigger linen cloth was thrown to cover it. John outstretched his hand, a little shaky from a few seconds ago when the woman’s voice startled them, and tugged at the fabric to let it fall.
“I know,” John rolled his eyes, passing by him with a wet pat on the shoulder. “Future doctor, remember?”
“Yeah, lots of people overdo it,” Cedric agreed, pushing his bowl aside. He gulped down the rest of his pumpkin juice and rose to his feet. Blake mirrored him; he barely touched his breakfast since he got a hold of the paper. It needed burning. “Want to go to the Owlery? I need to send my mum a letter. We could go to Hogsmeade later.”
During dinner, John threw a few glances at his friend, who nitpicked his food, looking disinterested as ever.
“I’m not angry,” Sherlock had assured her, feeling a pang of guilt. He was more frustrated than anything. He had plans to expand his homemade laboratory, but alas. “Just… Fine. We’ll go. I assume you talked with Irene?”
“But today,” said Seb, swinging his demon knife between his digits. The vampire struggled against his restraints, but to no avail. Seb put the knife to his throat, his voice low and dangerous. “Today, I am your worst nightmare.”
“Leave where?” Sherlock asked, shooting John a quizzical glance when he put toast on a plate in front of him. “Oh. Thank you?”
In the end, Dean nudged Sherlock to hand them their rings, and although the boy doubted initially whether they’d be able to take them, they did put it on each other’s ring fingers without a hitch. Then Dean started chanting something in latin and the ghosts, gazing at one another besottedly, started fading away until eventually they disappeared before their very eyes, the rings clattering against the wet rocks.
“Possibly. I was able to tell John isn’t a prophet, but I’m still unaware of what I can or can’t do. But unless we stumble upon him I won’t be sure.”
Weren’t it for this project, Greg would flat out refuse to leave. He was ready to shut John’s well-meant offer, but the memory of his guy, Florida Man, brought certain prospects to his attention he couldn’t ignore. Florida, as he called him for short, was a crazy dude doing crazier shit by the minute (google a random date along with the keywords ‘Florida Man’ and you’ll get yourself headlines -- a great birthday gift to yourself to cheer yourself up), but he also had connections. Greg had them too, but he was also legally dead across several states, so he had a few limitations in place. Technically he could ask Anthea for help, but he thought it was too early to involve her in this elaborate and fifteen-year long scheme of his. Not yet.
John paid for the ice cream, thanked the man, and let go of Sherlock to taste it. “Not bad,” he said as they walked to the exit. “So, how did you know?”
“Seeing the logic, aren’t we?” Mycroft said coldly, clasping hands behind his back, straightening himself. He unlocked the doors leading to another carriage. “Off you go, then. Rest assured I
Carefully so as not to wake him, John repositioned his new friend to lie horizontally and covered him with a blanket for a short while. He will repack his things to a more strategic arrangement, and then minimise it so that he’ll be able to strap Sherlock to himself. This will be a long day.
“Shush!” she whispered, pushing him back into the room and carefully closing the door. John almost tripped on his own foot, having to steady himself by grabbing the wardrobe. He certainly didn’t fancy waking up like this. “I have to talk to you alone.”
“Hi,” Harry said stiffly, shifting where he stood. The girl next to him looked Blake over, her dark brown eyes skimming critically over him; he felt strangely exposed.
“Only you two can dig up people’s secrets on your first date and consider it fun,” she said, arching an eyebrow sardonically. “I knew you were made for each other.”
“Make sure you don’t get arrested for defamation of property,” John said, elbowing Greg in the ribs.
“Doesn’t mean she can’t be in the same room as us,” John said in a singsong tone that meant that the debate was over. Sherlock huffed, defeated, and walked over to his bedside table to get the journal, falling onto his mattress next to John’s feet dramatically. “Oh, come on! She’s your sister, not an alien. Be nice.”
see Sherlock be happy and not hurt. And it was disheartening to see him deny himself this hypothetical joy of a relationship with John Watson when she saw it would only blossom and grow. In the end, she did see John’s reaction when she told him Sherlock’s into guys that second day at the Shack.
John felt the weight of his silver eyes scan him head to toes. He crossed his arms, which exposed the watch he had on his left hand. Sherlock stepped closer, examining him from all angles as he circled around the Gryffindor boy like he was some sort of old painting.
John rolled them over, pinning the impostor face-down with a huff as Sherlock repeated, “John, you’ve got to get him to touch the mirror! He dragged me in when our hands touched!”
“FUCK NO!” Greg shouted, putting his feet down, knocking over a soda can. “JUST LET HIM BE WHO HE IS YOU WICKED WITCH!”
Cas was satisfied with the choice of clothing John and Sherlock presented him with, but he omitted most of the jeans and agreed to take only the pitch black pair. After that he picked up a couple pairs of black or grey underwear, neither John nor Sherlock wanted to necessarily interfere with that. However, once Cas started browsing through the socks collection, John joined him.
“Because you weren’t comfortable at all when she came to see you,” Irene continued, her brows furrowed as she picked at her nails. “She invaded your personal space like you belong to her. She forced herself onto you, basically. And I think you’re too nice to say no.”
“Simple. You see it. I have a good nose for it, I usually sniff it out before the people realise it themselves. It’s like a sixth sense.”
Irene laughed, thinking of how Sherlock could come across as intimidating. He never fooled her, but she could see how his long, gangling limbs and and searching, intelligent gaze made people and Jake alike unsettled. “You don’t have to worry about my brother. He’s just a twat and a giant, pining idiot.”
“Irene’s obvious awesomeness aside,” John cleared his throat diplomatically, “how do you go about finding a person you’ve likely never met before?”
“What does Castiel think of your fashion choices you made for him?” Sherlock asked, leaning into John.
“Fucking amazing,” he muttered, not having the energy to look for the remote. He really hoped the git who lost it stepped on Lego. Or a Lego castle. While running on a treadmill. Greg liked the show in its early stages, but he dropped out soon enough not to become obsessed, but his happy days were over. He remembered the initial plot and characters too well for his liking. Especially the King’s conservative mother grinded his gears. If there was a character Greg wanted to die or go off the show, it was her.
“Great, as if I need more publicity,” Harry sighed, looking as uncomfortable as Blake had felt the whole time in the cupboard.
“You could’ve been more sensible about it,” Sherlock said, amused by how Wilkes’ arrogance played him. “The doors are the first thing homeless people or robbers go for. They’d be long gone if there wasn’t a mechanism from either side holding them in place.”
“You can’t know that,” Greg said, crossing his arms. “The least threatening people can kick your sorry arse the most, usually. But I concede your point. It probably would be better to stumble upon him than the other teachers.”
“I remember losing my vision as I reached for something to help me. I got hold of a stone and hit him in the head and his skull cracked. He fell on me and I didn’t have the power to push him off, and I felt my eyes shut.
"No? He says that if you joined him, he would provide you with anything you could ask for, especially the detective. If it were on me, I'd have you killed already, and believe me, I'm inching for it, but I've heard about you. Sherlock Holmes, a detective with extraordinary talent. The Dark Lord counted on this, so he is willing to give you a few days to think it through. He would like help solving a mystery or two, so he will be patient with you."
“I get it,” Sherlock interrupted, his expression torn between bemusement, being on the verge of laughing, and mild confusion. Ah, yes -- Irene warned John that Sherlock is willingly turning a blind eye to the Internet lingo. “It’s…. an adequate depiction of evolving linguistics.”
“Can we just get to our beds now, please?” John peeped from behind Sherlock, stopping him from further elaboration. The Ravenclaw boy felt a pang of guilt upon hearing the exhaustion in his voice. But they learnt some interesting facts, at least, on top of seeing the Silver Blaze outside.
“Hungry,” he mouthed back, spooning himself the pie, not breaking eye contact. It was his turn to tilt his head and raise an eyebrow.
"Look, I had a weird day," Mundungus said, face tired. "I already told the kid everything I knew, I promise - well, I did…"
“You heard me. I know, pretty shocking. But she’s telling the truth! I saw her tentacles and she’s been stuck here for years when some fishermen caught her. She escaped, flopped through the forest and almost died, but forest animals like the deer and skunks licked her awake and helped her plop into this lake from that cliff overhead. Pretty crazy!”
Silence. John’s brows furrowed as he repeated the question, but no answer came. Did Sherlock seriously think that pretending he wasn’t there would fool John?
Sherlock fell into a stroll next to him, grunting a non committal response. John noticed the duffel bag he carried over his shoulder, and he was sweaty and dishevelled. As far as John assessed him, he had no injuries. “Sherlock?”
John refused to comply that soon, but it became harder when his boyfriend’s baritone sent shivers down his spine. He managed not to give himself away, repeating a mantra consisting of all 650 muscles of the human body to himself.
“Vampires?” John teased, budging the doors open with his hip. He already turned around and missed Sherlock’s eye roll. They deposited the nacho bags on the free seat next to Mike who hummed in delight. He immediately grabbed a bag of plain chips and munched on it. “You’re welcome.”
“Yeah, well anyway, I promised Kate to help her clean up the gift shop, I have to go,” Irene had said, her energy similar to that of a tennis ball. She had waved John a goodbye and shut the door on her way out.
“Christ almighty. Alright, I won’t question ya. I’ll get in touch with you when my guys get back to me. That all?”
“So? I’ll give you one of my old ones,” Greg shrugged, falling one step behind him as John spotted that mop of curls crouched nearby. “Seriously, you would make a good Keeper or Chaser. Maybe even a Beater.”
"Last afternoon before we went to have dinner," Jane said, tears forming in her eyes. "And then… I came back and Lancelot was gone. I turned the whole room upside down, but he was nowhere to be seen."
the chemistry between them. They’re so natural around each other it ticks me off to see them both play dumb-dumbs and hesitate.”
“Natural my ass! Do you honestly think I wouldn’t notice? You could never be Sherlock, he’s far too unique for anyone to pretend to be him.”
“What do you think so far, Sherlock?” There was uncertainty in her eyes and a distant sense of fear he hated to see there. Mrs Hudson shouldn’t be scared like this.
“Sorry, what’s your name again?” Sherlock said, taking a step forward to inconspicuously take a closer look at Irene’s new ‘girlfriend’. She wore high platform shoes, dressed in all black (the usual goth business), had impeccable make-up look saying ‘Don’t fuck with me’ and a beautifully done manicure. Her nails were onyx black and had tiny skull stickers on top. Sherlock liked her style, but his senses told him there was something off about her - and he thought he saw her hand shake in a weird manner.
Smiling, Blake pushed the door open to see Krum and Fleur already waiting inside, as well as Ludo Bagman and a witch in magenta robes. Bagman noticed Blake and waved him to come closer.
The pregnant pause that followed this question seemed to stretch infinitely, and John suddenly felt as though he was in over his head. Sherlock knew him better than anyone—and, at long last, he felt he could say the reverse as well. He
When John stumbled home that evening (that last pint had been a doozy), Sherlock was (of course) still up, seated at the kitchen table and bent over his dissection microscope. He was dressed in grey wool pajamas and his blue silk dressing gown, looking rumpled and sleep deprived. John leaned (read: sagged) against the doorway, just watching him. It took several minutes before Sherlock looked up. There was a wrinkle between his eyes that smoothed out at he gazed at John, taking him in.
Sherlock’s precise and deliberate enunciation made John grimace. Why did that word have to sound so bloody awkward? “Yes! Most people think of… well, other people. Sexy scenarios. But you have no interest. So, what do you think about—
“So, what? Your goal is to find a term that explains away,” he mimicked John’s earlier gesticulation, “
With some bemusement, John made his way up the stairs leaning heavily on the bannister, Sherlock following behind. He said nothing, not even to chide the obvious listing in John’s climb or the slow clumsiness of his ascent. When John reached the top of the stairs, he waited for Sherlock to climb the last few steps for reasons unknown to himself.
on the bar. “What d’you say we change the subject and have another?” He was already signaling the bartender.
in detail,” he said, holding up his hand in panic as Sherlock lowered the paper incredulously. Lord, he did
John wasn’t gay—sexually speaking, at least. He was fairly certain of that. He had wanked with an army buddy once, but it had done little for him. All of his sexual fantasies revolved around women, and the one time he had deliberately thought about a man during a wank, he hadn’t . . . well, he hadn’t been able to stay focused. It wasn’t that he found it repulsive. John was self-assured enough that he could aesthetically appreciate a fine male figure (exhibit A: Sherlock), but . . . when it came to sex, that just wasn’t what he went in for.
He was thinking about this interaction, and his latest reading into homosocial relationships, whilst he and Sherlock were pressed together in what might have been kindly called a broom closet in a nearly empty warehouse. Since they were technically breaking-and-entering, Sherlock had grabbed John by the hand and pulled him into the nearest door as soon as he heard the footsteps of the night watchman. They were standing chest-to-chest, Sherlock’s arms practically wrapped around John in a way that wasn’t in the least off-putting and, really, it was all par for the course for them.
The words were said with such a matter-of-fact tone that John couldn’t help the bark of a laugh that escaped him. Sherlock stopped briefly to look over at John a grin before returning to his work.
Sherlock tore his eyes from the screen to give John a look that clearly reciprocated the sentiment, and then asked, “Your search history. Am I to expect a declaration of undying devotion in the near future?”
His initial Google searches, ham-handed though they were, lead him to websites that he (now with the full knowledge of Sherlock’s scrutiny, and having been exonerated from explanation) clicked through with interest and without hesitation. Sometimes it led him to things that were . . . well, just not his bag; but, for the most part, it was extremely informative.
His voice was scratchy and dry. John got the cup of water and straw from Sherlock’s bedside and, once Sherlock had raised his bed to a gently reclining position, John helped Sherlock drink some of the water.
Greg had been there when John arrived, and had a pint waiting for him. They talked casually for the first hour, Greg bemoaning one of the new sergeants that was added to his staff and John, in turn, complaining about Sherlock. It was probably a bad foot to start off on, because talking about Sherlock just opened up the door to . . . well, talking
They were opening the back door of the ambulance, two paramedics hoisting in a gurney. A body on the gurney. A body strapped down, with bandages covering one of its arms, its side, an oxygen mask going over it’s face—
Sherlock considered him for a moment, blue-grey eyes nearly unreadable. (John thought, for a moment, that he detected a spark of mirth there, but it was gone before he could examine it more closely.) Then, Sherlock turned his attention back to the paper.
“Is there something you’re trying to tell me?” he asked. His tone was somewhat bored, but it usually was at this time of morning, on Sundays when there wasn’t a case on.
John clambered into the cramped ambulance, relieved, trying to stay out of the paramedic’s way as she got Sherlock’s vitals, applied pressure to the wound at his side, but still
Sherlock blinked, an odd mix of weariness and surprise flitting across his features. He crossed his arms over his chest, tilting his head. “It’s still bothering you.”
But he’d known this for . . . well, for a while now, and god damnit, he had to explain this to someone. Greg was a mate, and a good listener, and had so far taken everything John had told him with surprising aplomb. “He’s a fucking prat, but I love him. I’m just don’t know that I’m
He had looked up then from the second victim to see Sherlock, who had forced the murderer to his knees, staring at him. It was a look such that John had seen before, almost never directly; he tended to catch it in his periphery, presumably when Sherlock though he wasn’t paying attention. Only once or twice had he glimpsed it before, yet here it was again: a look completely devoid of any pretence, open, raw, joyful, and completely transfixed. As if John were something amazing.
been asking whether or not Sherlock had any kind of sex drive, but this question got at the same issue. “Erm, yes.”
He expected Sherlock to scoff, maybe roll his eyes and turn away; but, instead, Sherlock merely shrugged one dressing gown-clad shoulder. “Perhaps.”
“Not in all cases. Some of them were very bright. I simply dislike having to compete for your time and attention. I find everything much more pleasant and efficient if you aren’t distracted.”
As John brought his fork to his mouth, he studied Sherlock, or what he could see of him over the paper. Sherlock was, unequivocally, an attractive man; lean, with a face chiselled out of marble, piercing eyes, and a meticulous overall countenance. Definitely good-looking. It was a thought John had had before—hard not to when women (and men) on their cases went gaga over Sherlock before realizing that he was a complete and utter bastard— but, with John’s current line of research, the thought came with baggage that he had never had the nerve to unpack.
Sherlock suddenly poked his head back into the kitchen—possibly just so that John could bear the full brunt of his baleful expression. “It sounds cinematic.”
was out. That was fine with John. It felt like a throwaway term, anway—more flippant than was desirous and, upon further reading, seemed (in some contexts) to have similar connotations as
After a moment, Sherlock put his cup down without drinking from it. Quietly and evenly, as if he had given the words a lot of thought, Sherlock said:
Sherlock followed shortly, carrying two plates with scrambled eggs and toast. He set the plate with substantially more eggs before John and then sat down to his own plate.
This, thankfully, dissolved some of the tension in the room and caused Sherlock to snort. “Too right.” A thoughtful pause. “And yet, here we are.”
Namely that Sherlock, for all he knew, had never had a relationship or encounter that John knew of. And, there was a very Sherlockian explanation for all of that, but there could also be another. . . .
Instead of looking annoyed at being coerced, Sherlock considered him thoughtfully. And it felt good to be at the center of Sherlock’s attention, to have the whole of his consideration, even for something so trivial.
In fact, John managed to put the issue more-or-less on the backburner for several days. A new case had come up, which helped immensely: a string of murders, done in pairs, all the victims couples, and linked by seemingly nothing. Sherlock was all in a frenzy over it, spending all night in the morgue with the bodies (and Molly), running experiments in both the lab at Bart’s and at their kitchen table, and in general having a grand time. John, as per usual, got sucked into the imbroglio, was more than happy to come along, really. But, as it happened, the last two couples that were murdered were gay; this, somehow, heightened the scrutiny of all involved on John and Sherlock, and John once again began to research and re-evaluate.
John blushed harder. “Stop being obtuse. What do you think about when you—” He made a vague hand gesture.
And John did, turning the subtitles on for the crime docu and settling in. At some point, Sherlock removed his leg from John’s lap and put it back under his thigh, and it was not a rebuff, but a reassurance. Later in the evening, as part two of the show was ramping up, Sherlock closed his laptop and put it aside. He asked John to turn up the volume so that he could abuse the show properly, and rearranged himself to spend the rest of the evening with his head on John’s shoulder, and then on John’s left thigh.
He had not been overly surprised to learn that, like sexual orientation, romantic orientation was a rather broad spectrum. However, he did have trouble imagining romantic attachment without, or incongruent to, sexual preference.
Sherlock clicked around whatever page or document he was perusing and answered distractedly. “I don’t hate them, I simply find them annoying.”
”, stood up and took his dish to the sink. He did the washing up whilst Sherlock launched into a violin sonata that John recognized as a favourite of his by melody, though not by name.
Greg nodded sagely, his eyes drifting to the screen where the Northampton Saints were playing the Leicester Tigers. Though Greg had been keeping to their conversation, he had also been sneaking glances at the telly—which was, honestly, reassuring. John hadn’t been too sure how Greg would react when John brought up his conundrum, but he needn’t have worried. In his typical fashion, Greg had raised his eyebrows in slight surprise, but otherwise nodded and supplied opinions where necessary and without mean judgement. The whole affair concerned him little enough that he took to cheering whenever Northampton scored, before returning to their conversation.
Happy holidays to all of you from me, Anarion! Enjoy the last chapter from Days of Storm tomorrow and thank you for reading and leaving all those lovely comments! <3
Sherlock followed the prints from the window to the chimney, went down on his knees and looked up the chimney. Then he turned and looked at John.
“You know that I know where you live. Where your friends live. Where your parents live. A nice little Holmes collection could be my next project.”
I get a call from Greg about shots fired and a bleeding man on the street. Why don’t you, for once, put yourself in my shoes?”
When the librarian approached him again, looking thunderous now, Sherlock stepped right into his path. “Thank you for offering to help,” he started. Politeness would lead to success, John sometimes said. He wasn’t sure why the man turned a little white around the nose at his words.
When he entered, he was disappointed to learn that the smell had changed. When he walked the reading room, simply rushing past the young librarian sitting at the counter and ignoring his comments about being forbidden to take his coat into the room, he understood why that was. The furniture was relatively new and where typewriters had rattled away, people sat with their laptops or phones, and, if at all, took notes with ballpoint pens. He inhaled deeply and filed the smell away, but without replacing the old. He liked how the place had smelled when he was young and it was one of the few memories he wanted to hold on to.
The man’s hand trembled and then he pushed forward. Having anticipated the move, Sherlock sidestepped him and pushed him hard against the bannister of the bridge. The knife slipped from his hand and landed in the murky water below. The desperate roar that came from the man turned into a whimper as Sherlock’s knee connected with his back. A moment later they were surrounded by men in uniform and battle gear and Sherlock had to smile at the fact that Lestrade had probably overstated the severity of the operation. Yet he was relieved that they had been this quick.
He opened his eyes again, losing the memory of the familiar smell and crossed the road. The library would close soon and he needed to hurry if he wanted to look for clues.
That was not the thing that destroyed the rare quiet atmosphere that filled 221b Baker Street, though. Sherlock flopped back down and went back to sleep, Greg continued to tell John about Rosie.
"Sometimes." Sherlock grumbled into his pillow. She laughed at that. "Yes, but then you can't say that you hate everyone. There's always an exception. Who was it today?"
"Yes, John! Bodies! Would you like to try and analyse the cause of death and criminalistic background of some of these cases? That's what I would call active biology!"
"Shut up, Sherlock!" interrupted John, who needed to get some things off his chest. "Just so you know once and for all, my name is John. J-o-h-n. And right now, I don't will either call you a freak or tell you to piss off. I just want to tell you that if all of this is true, your brain is fucking amazing." he looked at the smarter boy, expecting a snob answer regarding ordinary life forms in general and stupid humans in particular.
