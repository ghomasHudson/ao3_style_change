Sherlock blinked, “I... didn't follow that at all but I believe the latter is correct, the 'spinning crap' one, as you so elegantly put it.”
“Right, thanks...” John said as he sat up slowly and inspected the back of his head for any bumps or blood... he felt fine, if a little jostled... “You a doctor then?” he asked, trying to make conversation with his apparent saviour.
John arched a brow at the old woman, “Yes, yes it is pretty hard,” He said in a false friendly tone, “But then I remember that I still get to have hot hate-sex with random strangers of all genders and I feel
He puts his now mostly empty champagne glass on the table in front of him and shuts his eyes. Then, he rests his head back against the long velvet settee they’re all sharing and lets out a slow breath. He tries to count in his mind just as John had taught him and concentrate on a single point, only John isn’t here and Sherlock is finding it difficult to find a single point to concentrate on.
John holds still and allows Sherlock to do what he wants. Whatever he wants. It’s fine. It’s all fine.
that I’ve been drinking a lot. Dorian has been shoving drinks at me all night, each of which I’ve very surreptitiously been abandoning here and there. I’m sure the only person who would notice this is me.”
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees, looking at him as he prepares another piece for Rosie, “Which means you get to have her all the time.”
Sherlock allows the boy to latch himself onto his side as he’d been doing the whole evening earlier. He lets the emptiness of John’s distance be replaced with the warmth of Dorian’s admiration. And while, yes, Sherlock finds his attentions a tad bit annoying, he’ll take them right now over being pushed away.
John spoke calmly then, looking deep into Harry's eyes so she could see the open anger inside of him “You tell her the truth, Harriet, or I will.”
“John was talking to George, the tow-man, during his interview rounds. Told him where abouts your car had crashed. George promised to get it in the morning. All that alcohol you presumably drank tonight should help cover this quite neatly.” The other man explained, a torch light shining ahead of Sherlock but a gun still pointed at his back.
“Oh my god.” John whispered, looking at the ceiling, “I feel like I just found out my favourite love song was written about a sandwich.”
“Irene” He greeted, looking her up and down. Her hair was a mess and she wore a dress that seemed a little too small and too colourful for her usual tastes.
Sherlock tried to catch up but only just caught a glimpse of John quickly removing his suit in the car.
“Oh,” John answers quietly, and he starts to feel as if they’re leaning closer. He feels Sherlock’s breadth closer to his anyway, and those eyes seem to be sinking towards him. John begins to feel as if his eyes will droop as Rosie’s had and —
*insert shrugging emoji here* He doesn’t know. You know who else doesn’t know? Me. Yeah. I have no clue. ;) (no really the story is running away from me and doing whatever it wants to do. Is this what happens to mofftis? Is this why they make us cry like this?)
“–Oh she’ll have to deal with it,” the dark-haired judge laughs, “It was really refreshing actually, to have you two jive to that song. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen the same tired performance of songs like jailhouse rock–“ Some people in the audience start to grumble but the judge speaks over them - “Not that there’s anything
Sherlock rolls his eyes and says, “Fine,” his exclamation sounding fondly exasperated enough that the rest of the dancers buy it and they all cheer as they come together to chat excitedly before Claudia can bring the other contestants up and the Cameras will be switched on again.
“No!” Irene Answers while Molly and Lestrade shrug in affirmation, each muttering “yeah,” and “pretty much.” Irene ignores them and shoves two almost identical pairs of Louboutins at Sherlock — “Which ones — these or these?” She asks, lifting each pair to emphasize her question.
“You could have just spoken to her in privacy.” Irene said gently as John picked up his wine from the counter next to him and took a large mouthful, “I don't claim to own a moral compass that points exactly due North but... if I say something doesn't seem right, then something's definitely gone wrong.”
“So here's to the most perfect couple,” John finished, his expression clearly saying what he truly meant as he raised his glass, “brought together by destiny. I'm so proud of you baby sister.” He brought his glass to his lips and drank, staring Harry down, daring her to get up and say something.
Molly shrugs, a smile on her own face as she watches Rosie settle her face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck and stay there, quietly breathing him in, “Irene asked. Besides, It’s no problem. John said she misses you, so I figured it might be okay to bring her for a few minutes, at least before we go for our morning walk in the park.”
John barged his way into the flat impatiently. He did not have the time nor the patience for Harry's lies today.
as i said, I don't know what the original plan was for this but I have some notes i made after re-reading it about what it can become (yes I said that on purpose ;P) and hopefully I can pull it off. I dunno. We'll see. As I said in my notes for In Pursuit, though, I am starting school soon and life has definitely been a bitch to me recently so I'll see just how much of these tow stories i can manage to type up for you guys properly with like, grammar and descriptions and plots and shit. Hopefully. I dunno I'm an artist, not a writer, scottie.
John looks between the two men. He’s confused by Sherlock’s sudden and somewhat panicked expression. Who the
John considers firing off a text to Sherlock to ask him about it but as he unlocks the screen on his phone he notices the time. It’s well-past midnight and while John is sure Sherlock is awake (especially if this
The stage is bathed in bright blue and white lights. They wear classic looking ensembles for tonight’s performance (Sherlock in a tuxedo with some tasteful extremely thin flecks of dark blue glitter smattering the black suit and his partner in a long white dress with light flecks of silver glitter) and as the loud trumpets and the strong romantic voice fills the room Sherlock begins dancing to their arranged choreography in the center of the stage by a large prop building while his partner sits on top of it, as if she were dining on a roof top patio, wiggling her shoulders to the tune.
Harry gets a present from mum, John gets a lecture on saying 'no', Harry does more mean things, secrets are revealed and Sherlock gets to do some fun research for an article. Also cock jokes.
John Watson) was saying, “Now, I am going to get up, and I'm going to take a glance into that car, and you had better hope that Sherlock Holmes is still breathing or I
“There's nobody here that you can help, Doctor. You might as well sit still, relax, and have a drink. It's been a long day,” Sherlock said making a grab for his drink as the bar tender set it down saying, “There you are.”
Lightning flashed in the distance and they heard the rumble of more thunder as they sat there, fuming. John made a sudden movement then and reached towards his back pocket for his phone. Sherlock had no idea, of course and assuming John was still mad he grabbed the hand to stop him on instinct. John glared, grabbed the phone and yanked his arm away. Sherlock stared for a second, then turned to do the same.
Sherlock feels his cheeks glow for what feels like the hundredth time this morning and he finds he’s still grinning stupidly when he replies, “Yes, well. They came over after he picked Watson up from yours yesterday. He made dinner and then we watched a film. He... stayed quite late and Rosie was asleep so... He’s having a shower at the moment and then we’re taking Rosie out for breakfast.”
Sherlock looks to Irene and gestures a question at her with his eyebrow. Irene just smiles and shrugs, wrapping an arm around his stomach and sprawls on him as well, “I do insist,” she replies.
John gives him a puzzled look, “No I didn’t think you had,” he comments slowly, “But you know it’s really not an issue that she does. I’d be a lot more worried if she hated you.”
John smirks and kicks Sherlock’s she lightly under the table as he says playfully, “Afraid he’ll show me embarrassing photos?”
Sherlock stared back at the ground. “Right. Right, of course. I'll just... I'll leave this here then.” He placed the phone precariously on the thick wood of the restaurant's patio fence. He squared his shoulders, looked John in the eye again and said, bravely, “Goodbye, Doctor John Watson. It has been a pleasure knowing you.” He made to extend his hand but, thinking better of it, pulled it back behind his back. He gave John another weak smiled and this time, when he walked away he did not turn back around.
“Hmm. You should see the view from down here.” Sherlock replies evenly as his eyes roam over John’s form.
YOU!” He turned his face back to the road, with Sherlock's face almost touching the steering wheel while John held his shirt tight in his grip as they made a sharp turn.
“Yeah well, ta for that lovely bit of information, you sex-addict.” John laughed taking a swig of his wine and getting up. “I'll be right back, yeah? Loo.”
As they sat in silence while the adults walked around chatting with on another Harry and John held hands and stayed put, deciding not to run around with the other children, not wanting to cause their mother any sort of grief today. Little Harry, however had more difficulty understanding mum's pain and finding herself already bored and uncomfortable in the tall wooden pews she tried to find an excuse to get up and stretch her legs for a bit. The bride was taking too long anyway. It was then that she spotted a little boy, cousin Malcolm, it looked like (harry couldn't quite remember since she didn't get to see half these children very often), drinking what looked like a glass of orange juice. Suddenly Harry's throat felt very dry. She wanted some juice too. Harry looked from John to her mother. She remembered John telling her earlier 'You mustn't bother mummy today, she's a little upset because she misses dad, so if you need something, just ask me, okay?' So Harry turned to John and whispered, “Pssst! John! I'm really thirsty.” John's mother heard, of course, and made to get up, but John stood up quickly and held a hand forward to stop his mother, “It's okay mum, I can handle it.” He said, “C'mon Harry, this way.”
“Of course, John.” Sherlock replies with a nod, and stepping out of the bedroom, speaks directly to Rosie, “Come on, darling, let’s leave daddy to clean up that mess you made all by himself,” the last bit clearly meant as a tease towards John.
“Of course, John.” Sherlock replies, passing John the nappy as the other moves to Rosie’s changing table.
Sherlock, however, pulls away, though his smile is still evident as he teasingly covers his mouth, “No, John,” he whines around a shy grin as John follows him up.
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock says, already bringing another small forkful to Rosie’s mouth. She chews it gratefully. Apparently the taste of the food has reminded her that she has legitimately been hungry.
“Hello, John!” Mary beamed at him, “Thank you so much for doing all this, it's absolutely wonderful!”
John chuckles at his friend’s frankly ridiculous response, “Never let her hear you say any of that.”
The flash of something seems to pass over Dorian’s face again as the next couple of drinks are poured. Once again it’s gone before John can analyze the look. The boy hands one drink to Sherlock and leans against the bar, again speaking in a charming voice, “Oh no, no, I’ve never acted a day in my life. I find I’m quite clumsy at it. Bit of a terrible liar,” he shrugs, “which I suppose is what makes me so bad at pretending. No, I am but a humble musician, though I quite admire people who are multi-talented,” and at this comment his eyes rove over Sherlock’s figure while he continues brazenly saying, “Like you Sherlock.” He then addresses John again telling him, “He’s quite a marvellous dancer. I would have never guessed — but then I suppose we all have our secret talents don’t we? Like yourself — to think, you’re a Doctor now but you were an army captain at one point and
That doesn’t reassure John, but he decides not to comment anyway, walking up closer to the bouncer just as Greg appears behind the man and taps his shoulder to hand him a card and gesture about John. The bouncer nods in agreement as John approaches and waves him in after removing the rope belt from his path. As John meets with Greg and gives him a hug in greeting, he takes in the detective’s own appearance. Apparently he’d chosen a slightly more youthful look than John. He wore a black leather jacket, a light grey t-shirt, a simple silver necklace, and light blue jeans. Despite his age, the outfit suited him. Greg was pretty good at hiding his years even with the salt-and-pepper hair.
(I say this as if I don't have the power to add hilarity... in my defence this story has a mind of its own and 90% of this plot is not mine)
There stands Sherlock in a dark sequinned top, grinning as he runs down some steps to talk to a woman, (something like... Tess Daly, if he was correct?) and gives her a kiss on the cheek when he reaches her. John doesn’t quite catch what they’re saying - the volume on the phone is on low for the baby’s benefit - but he doesn’t think he’d have heard it properly if he had been listening anyway, because again, that was Sherlock Holmes and he is standing on a stage surrounded by hundreds of people while he chats amiably with a television show host while wearing a sequinned blouse. Sequins! On Sherlock Holmes! What? What?!
Also, they were out of character in the first couple of chapters because the whole thing is basically the same lines as in the movie minus the “sherlock-esque” speech patterns, but now about 90% the lines in this chapter are completely mine so they might seem a little out of character of their characteristics so far...? LOL, I dunno. I tried to keep them consistently Jane and Kevin-esque as they have been so far... soooo hopefully I succeeded? I'm being too self-conscious, I think XD I'll stop now.
“Well,” John said, through his food, “I'm going to go put on that slide show!” The look in his eye giving away all the insults he wanted to hurl at his sister in that moment.
John huffed out a little laugh and shook his head. “You mad wanker,” He said as he pressed himself against Sherlock's lips. Sherlock kissed him like he was drowning, sucking the breath right out of him. “I love you too” He whispered against John's lips, “I love you, John.
Cecily squeals, “Oh how exciting! Let’s ask the others when they get up here! It’ll be jolly good fun!”
Sherlock stares at the man with a carefully blank expression, “Not your problem,” He says flatly, “I’m not going to say it again –
, John thinks. He lets out a huff of breath and asks Rosie, “You want to dance with the real Sherlock?”
William turned his glittering eyes reluctantly from John then and directed his sight to Mary and Harry, his expression going a little more professional, “Sherlock Holmes,” He introduced himself, shaking Harry's hand.
And John, after tonight I'm going to turn 'round, walk away and vanish and I promise you that you will never see me again if you don't want to, but I before I do... I want you to know that I think you deserve more than what you've settled for.” John scoffed. “No, I do. I really do, John. You deserve to be taken care of, for a change. I believe that, John.”
“Huh? What? Oh. Yeah, yeah I'm fine mum. It's all fine.” John answered quickly tucking into his food and sipping some tea.
Sherlock and John smiled at her. “We did indeed, he is in custody.” Sherlock said, as John spoke, “Yeah it was a shame for her, poor woman.”
He smiled, “Alright, John, I'll concede it fits you quite nicely,” he spoke as he brought the phone over to allow John to have a look, “But, come on, the colour? Please.”
Sherlock glared at both of them for a moment, but then smiled as he said, “Tell him to stop wasting time and come out to marry me already, then.”
“You’re quite the sight,” John teases as he rolls the condom onto himself and begins to coat his cock in lubricant.
“Ooookay!” Irene's voice broke the silence as she joined John at the front of the room, “Alright, well that was certainly... an experience.” She pushed John towards out of the way and stood with her hands on her hips, awkwardly, “So... ummm... to keep the merriment going, Mary's godson, Archie, wanted to say a few words...” She gestured to Archie as he walked over, “So let's give a hand to Archie!”
And to be honest, John would have been a lot more embarrassed at that revelation if he wasn’t so turned on at the moment. No, his interfering landlady is the last thing he’s thinking about right now. Instead, John is thinking of the many thousands of ways with which he could make Sherlock moan and grunt his name. John sighs as he mouths at Sherlock’s skin, rubs his hands up the other man’s arms until he reaches his neck, brings them up further to pull that face down for a searing embrace. As predicted, Sherlock melts in his arms, a low sound escaping him as he lets John twist his tongue into his mouth.
“Fuck me,” Sherlock tells him, “Fuck my hand, John. Feel my cock pulsing against yours. Feel how hard you make me.”
The woman shakes her head and huffs, “Nevermind John,” she sighs and picks up her knitting things as she leaves the room.
Okay so there's a case and it's a little longer than I originally planned... so i dunno how 'mini' my 'mini-case' ended up being... Long enough for me to write a whole chapter and decide to cut it in half again. 7996 between this and what is now Chapter 9, so far. So... I'm sorry guys. I decided I'd cut it in half so that you guys could get to at least read something. I'm honestly 50% making this up as I go along while mostly following a movie script. I felt bad though because work has stopped me from writing and I haven't had a chance to do more. (honestly guys today was insane, holy shit i was so tired.)
Irene was dressed in a very chic-looking three-piece wool suit in a dark cool grey with a white-lilac shirt and a lavender necktie. She had a white rose pinned to her lapel which was decorated with a soft lavender chiffon ribbon. In her pocket she had a white lilac kerchief peaking out. She smiled coyly as she made her way to a rather mousy yet extremely cute looking bridesmaid dressed in a lilac-grey chiffon dress, matching Irene. “You must be my maid of Honour.” Irene said, taking her hand and bowing as she kissed it.
“Of course, John, I’m ever at your disposal.” Sherlock responds. His partner pinches his ass to grab his attention. Sherlock turns to glare at him just as the man gives him a sour little pout. ‘Don’t stop!’ Sherlock mouths, annoyed as John answers, “Great! Thanks, Sherlock. You’ve really saved us. You’re sure you’ve not got anything on?”
Sherlock feels his ears and cheeks burn at her words but tries to act nonplussed, “Quite sure, little sister.”
This one is short but hopefully the next one is longer. I’ve got part of it down already. Hopefully I can add more in the coming days before I start school again.
Dorian gasps dramatically at Sherlock’s side while the others laugh at his expense. The boy pouts and yells at Algernon, “You shall be sorry you said that when Sherlock, Gladys and I all crush you into the ground!”
Before Sherlock realizes what’s happening, John has pulled Sherlock into himself, running his hands up from Sherlock’s hips to his sides, then back down. He steps forward, leading Sherlock and then pulls him back. The dance is slightly clumsy, but Sherlock feels entirely dominated by the pressure of John's hands against him. He stops and John presses his whole body in against him – his hands crawl up towards Sherlock’s back to hold the detective close. With a powerful grip, he twists Sherlock around in his arms. He skims a hand sensually up from Sherlock’s abdomen to his chest. He uses the same hand to push down on Sherlock’s chest until Sherlock is leaning his head back on John’s shoulder. Sherlock pants involuntarily. His knees suddenly feel weak. He grins. This is what Sherlock had been seeking on the dance floor earlier – to force John to release this part of himself. John moves the hand on Sherlock’s chest up to his neck and strokes just beneath his jaw before groping his way back down. Sherlock, by some miracle, regains strength in his limbs. He pushes a hand up behind him to hold John’s head and pull it down towards himself, entangling his fingers into the short silky strands. He shivers as John breathes against his neck. The position is awkward and Sherlock can’t do much but feel John’s hands on him but God, this feels good. His mind has never been more blank than it is right now. It’s so freeing.
John smiled, “I guess so... Mary, before we go anywhere I just wanted to apologize for the other night. What I did... it was wrong. I shouldn't have said it like that–”
honest as Mary believed her to be. She was a liar. She was his sister, but she was also hurting Mary, a woman who loved her and was about to marry her, and that was not on.
John feels a change in the air and shifts in his seat a little, his leg almost touching Sherlock’s as he leans subtly closer. Sherlock twitches slightly but doesn’t move away.
“Hullo, Mrs. L.” Dimock smiled at her sweetly, “I assume you know why we're here.” (she nodded; yes.) “This is DI Scott, and I'm assuming this is his partner. They're from Scotland yard. They're sort of stranded it seems, but have decided to help. Can you tell us what you know?”
"But, Jennifer Wilson... you killed her for more than the reasons you killed the others in London. The others may or may not have been having affairs. It's why you kill them, because they're having affairs. Poisoning a marriage or their own like your father poisoned his. He hurt your mother, the endless romantic. And she, she committed suicide after he broke that locket like he broke her heart. The police may have made note of it if they knew of the affairs, but they only knew of one. They made note of it but discarded it as they only knew about Sir Jeffrey Patterson but the police didn't know that either Beth Davenport or James Phillimore were parts of an affair with married people. You knew because you'd driven them from one incriminating destination to another. Normally you work in London but you came to see your sister after dropping Jennifer Wilson off. You didn't know she was a serial adulteress at first. How could you? So you brought her to town and went to see your sister, then your sister tells you something. She's suspicious of her husband having an affair. You plan his murder but you go back to London first, for work, then a few days later you come back and find your sister confronting the woman in her kitchen. Your little sister. The one you cared for after your father left you two to fend for yourselves when your mother died and now Jennifer was destroying not only
“Wait a minute...” the female interrupted, “I know you from somewhere... aren't you – wait aren't you that man from paper? The groomsman?”
John pursed his lips and picked up the sheet of paper with the script Harry had written for him. He cleared his throat and started, “Harriet and Mary are a perfect couple. No– a
Sherlock doesn’t bother to remind her that glass isn’t safely edible, nor that the glass that she thinks made him laugh was actually shards of glass that she’d cut him with and that it had made him scream in agony. He suspects she knows and is just trying to get a rise out of him. In lieu of an answer he just gives her a look.
It’s a few seconds into their conversation that John realizes he’s being… well, weird really. He’s being weird. Sherlock invited him to come out for a meal and John is sitting here conflicting himself over his (newfound?) (sexual?) urges (feelings???). He’s got to stop thinking about this. He shakes his head slightly and finally decides to concentrate in the moment. He watches with fondness as Sherlock and Rosie talk to each other. He’s always so awed by the way Sherlock is so comfortable with her. John had always thought Sherlock would dislike children but he’s surprised John every single time he’s been in a room with a child. Sherlock is nothing if not attentive, kind and encouraging of them. Eventually, Rosie ropes John into conversation as well, though he and Sherlock can’t seem to find words to address each other. The silence between them is less uncomfortable now though, and John is sure they’ll find their rhythm again soon.
John is speechless. He stares, wide-eyed and his lips half-parted at the scene before him. He feels a heat rise up to his face and feels himself shake his head as he turns self-consciously away. “Sorry. Sorry!” He hears himself mutter rather raggedly as he rushes back out the door and towards the stairs, “I’ll leave you to it!” He panics. Thoughts of: Oh dear god, and: what the hell? And: Why couldn’t I have just called Sherlock? Rush through his head as he runs, barely registering that Sherlock is calling after him, and simply repeating: “Sorry! Sorry about that, should have kept knocking!” He feels nauseated and upset. A flurry of emotions rush after him as he follows his brain’s tirade of ‘gotta get out of here, gotta get out of here.’
“Enough,” John breathed, “I don't want this over yet.” He pulled Sherlock back up for a kiss. Sherlock moved back after a moment and settled himself right above John's dick, just on his abdomen. He reached up and pulled some damp curls out of his face as he began grinding himself wantonly above John, every so often allowing John's cock to rub against the cleft of his ass. Sherlock reached down and gripped himself as he moved in slow, tantalizing circles above John, his voice husky as he released soft breathy sighs. He was a fucking vision.
The words are so unexpected that Sherlock feels his cheeks immediately flare in embarrassment. He’s momentarily struck dumb by the very implication that John might miss him enough to mention it to Rosie. He feels his heart beating fast in his chest and something akin to butterflies in his stomach at the thought.
Sherlock smiled at him, “Even with the rain I could tell that she has her jewelry regularly cleaned. Her wedding ring, however wasn't as shiny as the rest. It's a bit dirtier than the rest, suggesting she touches it often, when I removed it I noticed that the inside of the ring was clean, though. Therefore the only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. Regularly removed, then, logical assumption, affair. And as for Carter, well, so far Dimock tells us he's the only one she really spent much time with. He was quick to blame his wife. He has something to feel guilty of doing to his wife which might lead her to exact revenge. Then there's Mrs. Laurinston, who told us Jennifer Wilson had had a fight with her boyfriend,
“Please, I need to ask you where they're keeping someone–” A frantic male voice sounded somewhere at the end of the hall, “I need your help–”
John quirked a sad smile at that. He felt awful, hearing Mary say that after what Harry had confessed, but he knew she was hurt, and perhaps, if Harriet had simply told her the truth, and John hadn't interfered Mary wouldn't feel this way right now. He said nothing.
Sherlock laughed, amused, but decided he should probably explain, considering how angry John kept getting over everything, “I used to be a sort of PI.” He yelled back as he drove the bike slowly behind Carter's police car through the muddy little village and towards Mrs. Laurinston's, “I worked with the police for a while as a consultant with a friend. Eventually word got out about some unpleasant habits of mine along with a rumour that I was working with my brother to get stories for the paper, which I wasn't. A friend of mine on the force was fired and I was never allowed near a crime scene again. My brother then seduced my friend and hired him at the paper as an investigative journalist, as revenge on the police force, I imagine, and eventually, out of guilt for ruining my friend's career through my relation with Mycroft, I followed. Of course the police forbade my brother from allowing me to do any investigative journalism that put me anywhere near crime scenes so Mycroft stuck me in the style section, because apparently I've a natural gift for it, and he doomed me to write about commitments forever. The badge I have now used to belong to my friend, but he threw it at me the day he was fired in a fit of anger. I've kept it since... Ah, but here we are.” Sherlock stopped his story just as they reached the little house. A small lamppost had been turned on and an old woman inside the house waved at them from the window. Sherlock parked the motorcycle behind Carter's car and got off, gesturing for John to follow.
“No problem.” Gary smiled and took the jacket, hanging it up neatly by the change room and ushering John in for him to change.
” John reprimanded. He was stunned that Sherlock spoke ill of a woman who was lying dead at their feet so casually. It was a little unnerving.
The swiftness with which the other had retrieves the items is almost comical but in Sherlock’s current state, he is glad of it. Soon the man is making Sherlock keen and grasp at the fabric of the throw blanket sitting on the back of the couch. The man is slow and methodical as he prepares Sherlock teasing him lightly and keeping him just on the edge of pleasure. Oh, he had chosen well tonight.
. No time to warn John, and it'd probably be safest for him if Sherlock left him behind anyway. He grabbed his coat and scarf at the bar and followed the suspect out through the exit. As he walked out, he noticed a london cab waiting, parked just in front.
Sherlock and John turn to look just as Dorian protests, “Oh, don’t tease me Algy, you know I can’t help the way I speak.”
!” Harry finished by bellowing the last insult into the phone then hung up violently and chucked it on the couch next to John as she screeched again wordlessly and began tearing up more of the paper in her hands in frustration. She stomped on it and finally started walking away, crying “I've got to get out of here!
Sherlock frowns. Leave it to Eurus to make an inappropriate analogy to equate to his homosexuality. And he did remember that Christmas now that she mentioned it. “You’d put glass shards in the icing and were trying to force me to eat it.”
On the telly the waltzing dancers finish their song to the last melodies of the song, the singer lamenting with a few last cries for all the things he should have done for his lost love.
.” Sherlock continued, “And before you ask, no, he's not part of the wedding circuit. He does this all, apparently for the
But Mary must have had it bad because she smiled at Harry and said, “Oh that's so sweet. You know when I was a child I had a stutter,” She informed.
John’s girlfriend stands irritably as she notices the slight pause, “You see? He’s not even here and you’re paying more attention to him!”
“Wait wait wait - Is that really –?!” John’s girlfriend asks, suddenly tossing her needles aside to watch with John and Rosie.
Sherlock swallowed as he thought of the torture investigative journalism would be now that he knew what it felt like to solve a mystery with John at his side. The thought of ever doing it again without him was almost one he couldn't bear. He couldn't help the sob that escaped him as he dropped the phone and he put a shaking hand to his mouth.
Archie gave her a mischievous smile, “And after the wedding are you going to see her again?” He asked.
John, growing frustrated replies, “Fine!” And puts her down, but before he can lead her to her crib she dashes in the direction of Sherlock’s bedroom with the wobbling speed of a toddler filled with energy. John stares. To think, she’d only recently learned to walk and she was already running away from his authority. He couldn’t wait til her teen years. She’d be a whirlwind.
At the end of the night, for both weddings (different times of course) cake was served and the Bride and Groom got up to say their thanks to their guests. Both the grooms made similar speeches which melded together in John's memory because of their similarity.
“You're right Carter. Here are the keys. You can take the car. Drive safe. I'll ride out with Fred when he gets here. And here're the keys to the house– just let yourself in.”
Rosie’s turns her wicked little smile on John and changes her expression slightly, in an attempt to look innocent. “Daddy. Hungry,” she states.
Unfortunately as John puts the finishing touches on the meal, Rosie begins to stir. John sighs in defeat and leaves the meal on the table while he goes to collect his waking baby. Luckily, Rosie seems to be in a cheerful mood. “Dadah!” She says, then, with a cute yawn she rubs at her eye, questioning,”Ah Shewak?”
John Watson feels himself gulp. He clears his throat and licks his lips before saying anything again, “What about your boyfriend then?”
John laughed again and went to his room to change into it, bringing with him a large staff and posing while Sherlock took a photo. “God!” Sherlock laughed, “No, people do not have cartoon theme weddings.”
... First he’d said he didn’t need romantic attachment and then he’d held John as he cried for the loss of the woman he loved.
Sherlock sat back down, though, and John followed. Sherlock asked then, “Did you know her even a little bit?”
“Ugh. Disgusting. You’re disgusting. I hate how gross you are right now.” She says although she’s smiling too.
“I don’t understand why you don’t like him,” Molly replies, borrowing some of Irene’s lipstick at Sherlock’s suggestion, “he seems like a sweet young man to me.”
“Hey!” Suddenly a voice spoke up behind them, “It's the great and handsome DI Scott of Scotland Yard's finest and his brilliant partner, John Watson!” It was one of the girls from last night. John almost spit his coffee back into the mug as he giggled remembering Sherlock's gangly limbs dancing awkwardly.
John tunes them out again in favour of another video clip of Sherlock. This one is of a dance performance from the week before. John looks up the song lyrics after the number is finished and compares them to the other songs Sherlock and Irene had danced to. So, this is why the judges were questioning his song choices. Most of them were heart-breakingly stroppy in their words, and similar to the song that had just been danced to by this other couple, had the underlying theme of a lost love. John didn’t really understand that. Had Sherlock picked these songs before he’d known Irene was going to be his partner on this show? Or, did he pick them to show her how he felt? John is beginning to question whether or not Sherlock is on this show for a case at all. It seems now, that perhaps he came on the program to get her attention? It seems like something both of them might be mad enough to do, but why would Sherlock do that? Sure, he had to know already that the woman was crazy about him – why else would someone consistently send flirty texts for well over four or five years. She was mad about him, clearly. Maybe this is a romantic gesture from the two of them to each other?
Rosie looks up from her cartoons distractedly, “Hi daddy. I’m good. Look it’s Dugee!” She grins, pointing at her favourite character on the screen.
“Yes, well, in any case, Dorian says that he and Basil didn’t see each other as often after meeting Harry. Or sorry – Henry – he calls him Harry. I do think that it could be that Harry was jealous and stopped them seeing each other, or it could be that he was protecting Dorian. He sort-of acts like a mentor/father figure to him, even if he is a bad influence.” Sherlock shrugs and continues, “Dorian hasn’t told me much more. I think that despite what Dorian says, he did care for the painter – he was genuinely upset when I asked him about it. I don’t really see him being the blackmailer though. Mostly because of how obsessed he is with me. He’s read your blog from the very first post to the very last one you wrote. If he were really looking for his lost lover, he’d have asked me to help by now, instead of threatening a bunch of
Sherlock and Irene pant and giggle, “Oh we’re feeling great,” Sherlock responds with a smug look, “How are you feeling, Tess?” He turns the question on her in a teasing tone.
The other man gasps in surprise, “Oh fuck.” He breathes, “probably a good call. Was getting too close.”
Sherlock’s lips twitch around a grin, “Yes, and I rather think you enjoy it – Particularly enjoyed it in the shower this morning,” he teases.
“I don't know if I can do this, John, it's a big responsibility, you know? What if I'm not good enough? And I mean look at her she's bloody gorgeous and I'm just, just... And and – What if she gets bored of being with me becomes a lesbian and leaves me for some hot thin woman? What if she decides she misses home after all and she divorces me for wanting to stay in England and she takes the kids and leaves me alone with nothing but my shit job at the paper? I don't know if I can deal with that kind of pressure, John!”
John smiles, still assuming Rosie means dancing along with Sherlock when he was on the television, “Okay, maybe I should rephrase the question; Would you like to dance with Sherlock
The crowd of people filled in around the pews at St. Mary's church chattering happily and excitedly. The place had been decorated in white roses and lavender bouquets with beautiful lilac ribbons intertwining with the flowers. The perfume permeated the air in their soft and pleasant smells mixed with the scents of the incense and candles in the church.
Sherlock chuckles and argues, “Oh no, Rosie, I can’t get up. I think shall have to dance from down here!”
“You lied to me.” John said, in an accusatory tone when he was satisfied Harry was distracted and out of earshot.
“I forgot I'm supposed to be meeting a friend – Irene, girls, you know her –” John explained. “I don't want to be late so I'm just going to pop out now.”
Eurus had beamed like an innocent child, more than happy to play some music with her older brother. They’d played for hours that day, until suddenly tears had begun to stream from her eyes. Eurus had cried and cried and cried, finally telling Sherlock that she was tired and needed to rest. Sherlock had raised a hand to the glass in front of them, beckoning her to come close for their goodbye ritual. She had pressed her hand to the glass as usual and her forehead as well waiting for Sherlock to kiss the glass between them in a goodbye. He did so, with a slight sadness filling him in sympathy for his confused little sister.
Jack smacks Sherlock as he takes another sip of his pink monstrosity, “Oh just say yes. He’ll be relentless otherwise and don’t worry, I’ll protect you. Besides, Henry will be here soon. He’ll keep the little monster under control.”
On his way to the bedroom John notices a stab-mark on the bathroom door, and another on Sherlock’s bedroom door. He huffs out a breath in exasperation, “Holmes,” he says quietly with a fond smile, despite his annoyance at his friend’s carelessness. As he approaches Sherlock’s door he notices that the door is slightly open. He quietly sneaks a peek inside and is relieved to find that Sherlock is fast asleep, alone in his bed. John slips away as quietly as he had come and makes his way to the kitchen, but not before checking up on Rosie again. Noticing she’s still sound asleep, John returns to his mission of making Sherlock something to eat.
Rosie pouts, and it’s clear she’s immediately not a fan of this concession. “I’m a big girl,” she explains.
Henry sighs. He looks upset as he stands there, wordless for once, balancing his wine glass on the small space between their arms on the balcony. Molly takes the glass and sets it aside on a high table behind her and reaches up to brush a strand of hair out of his face. Henry leans into the touch and she retracts her hand before he can try anything. “I don’t know,” Henry finally admits, “Dorian once asked me if I’d thought he’d been murdered, but I would prefer not to believe such a fate could befall our odd friend.” He turns his face away from Molly, his hair sweeping over his face as he looks down at the people below them. When he finally turns back to Molly he has his usual smile plastered back on his face, but there’s a falseness to it now that Molly hadn’t seen in it before, “Basil was rather dull, you see, and he had a wonderful genius for painting, but he wasn’t ever clever enough to have enemies. If he’d have been murdered it would have at least been some kind of romantic end for him. I much prefer to believe that he fell off an omnibus somewhere and that the conductor hushed up the scandal. It’s a fitting fate for someone of Basil’s character. Or maybe he’s alive somewhere in Paris unhappily married to some comely puritan woman hiding somewhere in the country,” he shrugs, “In any case, I try not to think about him. Dwelling on the past is so… tiresome.”
John shook his head, grinning, “No, no, it's okay. I did always wonder what that would feel like...”
Sherlock started to walk away as quietly as he could, but just as he turned Mary spotted him. “Holmes?” She called.
John shrugs, annoyed, “Well I assumed you’d deduced it, somehow, you being an overly observant genius and all that!”
to read it, but you've got rather messy writing, you know, being a doctor and all. You know, they do have these new fangled inventions, they call them 'smart phones' and they take care of everything quite nicely for you.” William informed.
-people’ Sherlock – honest to god blushes. He rubs a hand behind his head and laughs nervously as the Hostess and the other female judges squeal in understanding.
“Yes, that’s right, it does go ‘ding’,” John answers with a light chuckle. She raises her arms expectantly and he moves to pick her up. He takes her with him into the bedroom where he finds the screen of his phone lit with Sherlock’s name and his photograph flashing above the message in a little circle.
find him physically attractive, no matter what he claimed. In any case Sherlock had to find a way to distract the cabby, and get out of this fast or at least get what he wanted out of him without an unpleasant outcome on Sherlock's end.
Yeah. I know. Leaving you here, with this short chapter like this is a dick move on my part. I’m the worst. Muahaha.
“I... I... ah... she ah... well she was a young genius and top of her class in Uni, then she visited the top five most impoverished cities in the world and helped set up new clinics in each ... and then she came back to London where she became Bart's youngest female surgeon and after that she started her very own practice and pharmaceutical company all at once, both of which she runs today...”
Sherlock turned on his side, pulling his arm from underneath John's body to peer at him silently. John continued staring at the ceiling. Sherlock lay back down on his back then, hands behind his head. “Oh. I see.” He finally said.
About an hour later Sherlock found John while he spoke to a surly man named Berry Berwick who seemed to know and care very little about what had happened tonight. Sherlock wrapped an arm around John's back, his eyes twinkling, “I believe we're finished with the interviews, Doctor Watson,” He said, “Why don't we leave poor Mr. Berwick here alone to finish his drink and go have one ourselves, now our job's done.”
And Molly can’t help it. It just slips out, “Sherlock, surprisingly,” she answers with a laugh. Wait. Oh no! Her face grows impossibly more scarlet.
a case), John’s girlfriend might question why he’s not already in bed. For some reason it feels odd to explain to her that he’d been up watching videos of his old flat mate dancing in a tight glittery outfit. He sighs and closes the laptop with a soft snap and puts it away. He isn’t sleepy yet, but he decides, with a sense of finality, that he should get to bed. Maybe he’ll text Sherlock in the morning, or go ‘round to Baker Street. John yawns and steps into the bathroom to get ready for bed, clicking the door shut behind him. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he will ask.
ps. I’ve finally outlined most of what’s going to happen to the point where I’m happy with it and have at least a sentence to describe what will happen in the subsequent chapters. If the case doesn’t get too stretched the story should end up being around twelve chapters. I’m thinking it could go up to fourteen if I end up having to add one or two between chapters eight and nine just to round out the case and address all my plot holes but for now, 12 looks like the right amount.
John nodded awkwardly. He couldn't meet Mary's eye for a second. He knew, after all, how much Harry lied to Mary on a daily basis, and with his constant need to protect everyone, John had said nothing because he feared that he'd end up hurting the people he loved. One way or another it had thus far been best for him to stay out of it, keep his mouth shut... but Mary... Mary was in love with Harriet for being
John clicks on another link. This one is an interview of Sherlock - a sort of introduction of him to the show. John watches in amusement at Sherlock’s antics. He’s a good actor, he’ll give him that, anyone else would be fooled by his false charm and cheery smiles, but John isn’t. That false charm makes his brow wrinkle a bit and really makes him wonder why Sherlock is even on this show. Because there
“Thank you!” Archie started, interrupting their argument, “As all of you know, Mary is my godmother, but she's more than that. She's one of my best friends.”
Josh laughs nervously, “Thank you, er –“ and he hesitates, John didn’t give his name, and out of spite he chooses not to answer now.
After he sets the kettle to boil he rummages around the kitchen and is surprised to find that Sherlock at least has the makings of a good breakfast fry-up in here. He smiles wistfully. Either John has to thank mrs Hudson for taking such good care of his favourite moron or he has Sherlock’s new beau to thank. If this is the work of the young brunet John grudgingly gives him some points.
They enter into the crowded building pushing through a variety of different people. There seems to be some kind of coat-check area, which they bypass to move into where the main party is going on. John is surprised to see how packed the place is, despite how spacious the building appears. Its high ceiling is almost invisible from the ground, the dim lighting above making it appear as if it’s an endless shadow with floating colourful jets of light that beam down onto the dance floor but do very little to provide clear views. The strobes move with the beat of the music making it difficult to concentrate on any one detail.
Mary made a b-line over to John and Irene, looking nervously at the gift station. She'd forgotten to get something... She looked at John, her eyes wide in a sudden panic.
John takes a breath as his stop comes up. He makes up his mind while he exits the vehicle to go up and try to talk to Sherlock. He just hopes that Sherlock no longer has company. Of course if he does have company, (and he doesn’t catch them in a compromising position again) John can at least introduce himself and perhaps even scope this guy out. Not in a jealous way or anything - just... to make sure he won’t be hurting Sherlock. After all, Sherlock did have an odd taste in romantic partners (ie. Irene Adler), and it was only reasonable to want to protect his best friend, right?
Once on the road he was lost, though. There was no clue which way Sherlock had been taken. John knew there was at least one fork on the road coming up the way they'd come as he and Sherlock had seen it when they'd been jogging their way towards the lights of the village pub. John knew he was driving the bike way too fast in this rain, but he couldn't help it in his panic. He only hoped he wouldn't crash the bike this time. He'd be less likely to survive a crash with so little to protect him.
As the introductory chorus ends a salsa beat is incorporated into the song and the lights flick on at the exact second that Iris and Sherlock begin to move faster in time to the music, each steadily making their way to the other, their hips, legs and arms all flailing rhythmically in time with the song. Iris wears a gorgeous and incredibly sexy frilled dark blue dress with a red flower clipped to her short blonde curls. Sherlock matches her with dark trousers a thick sequinned belt and a shirt of the same colour of her dress opened almost halfway down his chest. On the occasional zoom Molly can almost spot the bullet wound left near his heart where he was shot a couple of years ago. Molly watches enraptured by the sensuality of their movements. She is stunned by the freedom Sherlock seems to dance with this week, especially as they twist and turn on the stage, coming together and splitting apart in wide dramatic sweeps. She’s stunned when they move into a particular position, Iris’ back to Sherlock’s front, his arm on her belly as they almost grind their hips against each other while the loud trumpet sounds fill the dance hall. Molly feels her face go hot. The move is scandalous! And when combined with their expressions...! Eek! They look so caught up in the heat of the dance, both sweating profusely but smiling all the same. The way their feet move and their hips sway - it’s like they’re in their own little world. It’s really a wonder to watch and to equate the image of this sensual and charming man with their Sherlock. This man is sex on legs, while Sherlock, who Molly already thinks is very, very hot, tends to be more... demure if not arrogantly flamboyant. Molly is so distracted watching the big finish, as Sherlock dips Iris for their final pose, that she almost doesn’t hear the light knock on her front door.
John smiled in fond memory, “Night club wedding.” He remembered attempting to close the jacket over the sheer black top which left absolutely nothing to he imagination and using anything he could to cover his crotch while the photos were taken. Sherlock almost chocked as he hid his flush of lust when John came out wearing it by pretending to laugh hysterically just so he wouldn't have to look for too long. He made sure he had a good photo first.
John tilts his head in confusion and Sherlock informs him, “Algernon has a made-up friend named Bunbury that he uses as an excuse to — shall we say —avoid distasteful encounters?”
The man rolls his eyes slightly in fondness and waves shyly at John and Rosie as they enter 221B while he makes his way to the exit. “Bye.” He mumbles.
Sherlock eyes John’s nearly empty plate and his own then asks, “If you’re finished we could get going? I’d love to have Rosie over and Irene and I have rearranged the flat so it’s easier to practice at home.”
want that story printed! I begged Mycroft not to run it but he did anyway, to spite me. I never meant– I didn't want to hurt you, John... I–”
“She helped me fake my death and kept it a secret for two years, Iris” Sherlock says, seeming to stumble on the Dancer’s name nervously as he says, pleadingly, “We can trust Molly. I trust Molly. The more help we have the better.”
Once back at the flat Sherlock waves them in. “Welcome back,” he says as he grabs the baby bag from John and tosses it on the couch, then moves to help him carry Rosie so that John can remove his coat. Sherlock sits Rosie down in his chair, which as he’d said, has been moved to accommodate a large empty space in the living room, and helps her out of her own tiny coat. John’s eyes explore the flat, marveling at the sheer amount of empty space Sherlock and Irene have managed to create by moving everything. “Hang on- where’s the coffee table?” He asks, finding it missing.
Just as she feels herself begin to vibrate on the tip of her seat Sherlock’s smiling face appears on the screen. It’s an odd smile, one that doesn’t quite reach his eyes, but for anyone that didn’t know him, you might say that he looked genuinely kind and happy to be on the show.
John is already fuming when Sherlock returns with to the table with their coffee and tea. “Josh says he’ll send over another waiter or waitress,” Sherlock explains, giving John a hesitant smile.
“All the suicides so far have been in London. My... higher ups have had me investigating them for months.” Sherlock said.
“Hi, John,” Mary said, sounding a little tired, “Thank you for coming on such short notice. I really appreciate it.”
The other man gives Sherlock a meek smile as he opens the door to exit, “Well, alright, I understand, but, er, you have my number, you know, in case you change your mind,” he says. He pulls on his maroon leather jacket over the tight white t-shirt he’d just put on and walks down the stairs.
“Yes! I’m so happy to have gotten to see you dance like this Sherlock, really I am. You were the couple I was most worried would end up disappointing me after that first dance, to be honest – you see I was afraid that you’d done so well that you wouldn’t be able to top it, but somehow you have! Each and every week you two walk onto this stage and manage to do a dance that’s better than the last. I don’t know how you do it but I am happy for it. You’ve pushed all the other dancers to try harder and we’ve seen so many wonderful performances tonight. You two are the ones to beat, and everyone knows it.” The other female judge answers, her dark-haired head nodding in agreement.
Jack lifts a brow from beside Sherlock, “Dorian My faith in the politeness of the youth is restored at your manners but I’m surprised you’re trying to run a conversation when the music is so loud,” he yells this slightly louder than necessary to emphasize his point.
“Greg!” Sally insists, pressing the phone firmly back at him just as he attempts to return it “trust me, you
Anyway have fun crying inside after I’ve put that thought in your head. I’m going to go write about John being clueless and his cluelessness making everyone sad/annoyed/angry. (Including me).
”  Sherlock and his partner pant as they strike their ending pose. They breathe heavily almost into each other’s mouths as the audience explodes into loud cheers and whoops. They’ve done it! They’ll be staying on for another week at least. They have to be, after this dance, and thank God for that.
John kissed his mother as she walked away while Sherlock raised an eyebrow at Mycroft, who bowed subtly and took Mrs. Watson's hand as they descended the steps of the Chancel towards their seats.
Sherlock continued his smirking and called out, “Any more weddings on the horizon, then Doctor Watson?”
His girlfriend glares, “No. I’m late as it is, John. I’ve fed her already, by the way. She should be fine for ten minutes.”
Sherlock gives him an exasperated sigh, “Fine.” He closes his eyes and takes another deep breath before replying, “I
But Rosie, like every toddler with the sudden mood to just do whatever she can to annoy her parents, just laughs.
Two nights after that: Harry and Mary making out on the couch when John gets home. They don't notice him leave. (He sleep's on Irene's lie-low that night. Wakes with a terrible back-ache.)
John lets himself in to 221 Baker Street with an air of determination. He has a short chat with Mrs. Hudson about her day with Rosie and after a few minutes decides to head upstairs. ‘Enough stalling, Watson,’ He thinks.
John had run out of the pub the moment he noticed Sherlock was missing. He was too late. Sherlock wasn't out here! But then John noticed something, fresh foot prints in the mud. Sherlock's and someone else's at his back. There were tire tracks on the mud as well, going in the direction towards the road Sherlock and John had come into town in. John frowned. What the fuck had Sherlock gotten himself into? John dashed over to the Motorcycle and quickly got on, hoping that he wasn't wrong as he drove it in the direction of the other tracks.
“Someday,” John breathed, “God knows when, but someday, it'll be my day and then all those people will be there for me, so... that is if I ever find–”
“It's not bloody finished!” Sherlock shouted after her, “Anthea! An–!” But she was already gone. Sherlock stared at the screen... He'd lied of course, the article was done he just... He didn't know why but he didn't want to send it. He wasn't ready, and he'd still not told John he'd written it in the first place. He wasn't sure John would appreciate the fact he'd written it anyway. What should he do? He'd asked for this. Should he just send it? What was stopping him?
It was a clear night and Sherlock could feel the excitement coursing through him as he looked through the diary to make sure he had the correct address to give to the cabby as he got into the car. “Hmm... thirty-two thirty-seven Cowper Street.” He told the the driver as they began moving.
! Imagine... imagine...! A shiver runs through Sherlock’s spine and he groans as he thinks of what more would feel like. Sex with John Watson, that must be paradise, and Sherlock is overcome with the need to have that,
“Alright, you come here,” Their mother gave Harry a light tap on the arm and held her hand, “Let's go upstairs, Johnny why don't you bring up those groceries, let's see if we can't make something nice for lunch.”
Irene had cringed at Sherlock’s words and her gaze had gone firmly to the table they were seated, her jaw clenched in defiance.
John blushed, “Ha... well... um, it's really not the worst one. If I had to pick one...” He grinned at Sherlock, “Oh, I've a good one!” he said and rushed to the closet excitedly, grabbing a shiny canary yellow monster consisting of a tailcoat and rather tight-looking slacks with a large red bow tie, shiny pink silk vest, a white frilly shirt and accompanied by a white top hat with a yellow ribbon. A white plastic carnation was pinned to the lapel. “It's my favourite.” John informed.
Sherlock hides his blushing smile by burying his face between his shoulder and Rosie. John had almost said ‘
and I finished interviewing you all. And we wrote notes here in our little... little do-hickey.” (he wiggled the notebook in his hands) “And we're done now. We are finished. Fiiiiinito. And I, the great and handsome DI William Scott, do hereby release you from your duty to the law! Thank you, thank you very much,” Sherlock did an odd Elvis impression that made a few people giggle and then he bowed flamboyantly. “Now, if we could all just cheer up a bit and forget about this dreadful murder business, that would be good. The night is young! Let us toast! To life! To love! And to sweet delicious Alcohol to rid us of our sorrows!”
getting on in age…” he teases. Algy squawks in indignation but Gwen merely removes a long silk glove she’s wearing and smacks the young aristocrat across the face with it.
“He means the girls,” Greg tells him, pointing out a large group of women who are currently doing body shots off of Irene’s stomach (
The cab has stopped now and John is at last liberated from his thoughts. He pays the man and finally makes his way inside the clinic. He spares one last thought to his personal life, hoping Sherlock truly doesn’t mind having been saddled with unexpected baby-sitting duties for a day.
John looked curiously at the proffered serviettes, “I don't remember teaching you that...” He commented.
Irene smiles watching the exchange with interest from her perch by Sherlock’s side. Sherlock, for his part, is still watching the dancers on the screen, frowning.
rings in his mind on an echo as he awaits Sherlock’s next message. The echo only breaks when his phone dings with Sherlock’s next response.
John lifted a brow, “Right, well fun as that all sounds I can't. I've got to pick Harry up from the airport.”
“Oh it's not a problem dear, none at all.” She stood too and got them their coats. “I hope you find them, whoever did that. Dreadful business,” She said.
“Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Call them, back for me, will you? But I'll probably have to dig up a date for that, won't I?”
He emerges from his bedroom refreshed and ready for the day, dressed in an overly large v-neck t-shirt, a light jacket, and soft sweatpants. They’re going to be rehearsing a group dance as well as their rumba today. Sherlock and Irene have to decide on their new song choice since the one on Sherlock’s original list likely won’t do. It’s clear the judges are a bit tired of seeing Sherlock dance to songs about lost love, so he’ll just have to switch it up here and there, or otherwise make sure his and Irene’s routines are perfect. They’re only on the seventh week, after all, and while they haven’t found their Hallward, they’ll need to stay on the show.
“...oh...uhh, sure, yeah,” John answered, and then to Mr. Berwick, “Thank you for your... erm time.”
“Hmm, no that's definitely plenty.” Sherlock then turned his attention to John, “So, Doctor, what do you think?”
Sherlock had thanked her and planned to leave right away except his office phone suddenly rang. It was Mycroft. Normally Sherlock wouldn't answer, but right now, he thought it was best to stay on his elder brother's side, lest Mycroft decide to run the story before Sherlock could clarify the situation with John.
Sherlock raises a brow, “Don’t encourage her, John,” then turning to Rosie he continues, “Watson, if you’re going to frame someone, at least make sure they’re animate. It’ll make your argument much more believable.”
“As I said. They still talk about you. You've a very unusual look, for a crime-fighter, almost like you're daring for retaliation. The arrogance. But tonight your hubris will destroy you. It's no secret you daylight as a love journalist and moonlight as a vigilante detective. I even read some of your articles. I know who to avoid if I don't want to arouse suspicion. But you got in the car with him. Saw him home safely, despite your grumbling. And when he left and you gave me the address, the London Journal, I knew for sure it was you. True I could have ended this then, but I had no reason to. In fact, in all honesty I still don't really want to do this. See I know, even if you won't admit it now, that you do believe in the same thing I do. I know it because I saw the way you looked as I drove you home after meeting him that night. The way you looked at him this very night confirms it. But... You leave me no choice, Mr. Holmes. I didn't want to do this to either of you.”
“No,” His mother implored, “No, John, you're wrong. Your sister adores you. Everything is going to be fine, my darling, if you'll just
Sherlock’s smile has fully returned to his face now and his eyes twinkle with mirth as he answers sweetly, “I love you too, silly idiot.”
That throws John into a fit of giggles and he replies, bringing up an old memory, “You’re the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes at the pet-name. He isn’t going to dignify that text with an answer, but the attention does make him preen a bit. After all, it’s been years since anyone (other than Janine) has called him pretty and as the years get on he feels his age beginning to catch up to him. His hair is beginning to grey in some areas and the wrinkles on his face become ever more pronounced as the days go on. Sherlock sags into the sofa, lying down with the arm holding his phone over his eyes. He let the years pass by him so quickly and didn’t even give himself a chance to enjoy them. No, instead he spent them waiting around and pining away his heart like a Shakespearean maiden to man he would never ever have.
“Yes, you and your brother are idiots. So was James. He got to me, but none of you ever got to her. No one ever did,” Irene had taken a sip of her drink, “until now. Bastard has threatened her life if I don’t give him what he wants.”
“Oh, yes, thank you Mr. Holmes – sorry, Sherlock – it’s another award of some sort or other, as you might have guessed – I’m not really sure what for, to be honest. I hardly pay these things any mind – they’re all so very droll, but I do so love an excuse to see my friends and celebrate.” He turns towards Molly with a grin, taking both of her hands in his and says, “So glad you could make it, my dear, I was very much looking forward to your presence,” then, turning to Sherlock, he continues, “You, as well, of course, Mr. Holmes. You know, Dorian has been driving me absolutely
At that Sherlock’s eyes fully clear and he sits back, out of John’s grasp. “Nothing.” He replies, an arm wrapped around his torso to grasp at his other arm.
; they have these sort of club mixes—” John informs him, “but I don’t think you’d appreciate how they’ve butchered the originals,”
John looked down at the carpet. Irene stared at him for a moment then crossed her arms, “So... sweetheart, what happened there?”She asked kindly.
“No, you're not. Not you John Watson, you could never do this. You... you keep me right. What happened... I did it to myself... However, I
Sherlock hums distractedly as he taps his finger on the screen to have a look at the video John has sent him. “I suppose I should be grateful you didn’t text him back,” he mumbles.
“No! No, he didn't call me. Didn't want me to see you, actually. Blamed me for the state of you.” John smiled sadly at that. “Maybe I am.”
“The thing is…” She had looked down, clasped her hands around the glass and then tapped her long lawyered nails along it in a nervous tick. She had seemed to swallow before she had finally looked back up. When she had looked at Sherlock she had seen stronger than when she had looked down but here eyes looked glassier and her voice shook. “I’ve investigated as much as I can about the company and at this point, you and I have hit a dead end.”
