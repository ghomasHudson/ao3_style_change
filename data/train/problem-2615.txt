Without looking up, he grabs Cas by the arm, stopping him from going anywhere, because he wants him to stay. The movement reminds him of the early night at the balcony, but this is different, because it’s just them, not alone in a balcony arguing about something Dean can’t wrap his head around, but alone just at home, and Dean’s fingers are holding Cas tightly by the arm, and he’s drunk, okay, but he can’t go on another minute not kissing Cas.
“Been busy”, he explains casually, before Benny gets some kid jokes in. It’s not that he doesn’t want to talk about it, it’s the sorry eyes people give him whenever Jack, or the backstory of it, is brought up. And he’s here to have fun.
“It’s not making me murderous”, Dean argues because he hates it when people read him like an open book, “It’s not.”
Cas can’t take his eyes off Dean, and the man is getting uneasy under his soft gaze. He wants to say something, but he doesn’t know what. There’s just something, on the tip of his tongue.
Sitting on that uncomfortable chair next to his hospital bed with his blood dried all over him, Cas looks like he’s done some thinking as well. Or at least that's what Dean's recently stabbed, pain medication filled body and brain wants to believe, when the man keeps staring him down and the silence around them stretches.
He’s definitely not looking forward to seeing him, but they were so busy fighting in the morning that they didn’t exactly have a conversation about the child that they’re taking care of together, and how they should handle picking him up.
Dean doesn’t say anything to that, and like Cas wasn’t even in the room, he grabs the giggling kid to his arms, and they head out.
He’s with Cas, in the safety of his arms with a blanket over both of them, so focused on whatever’s happening on the TV that Dean manages to feed him some more soup for dinner.
“Sam would close his eyes, and I would give him the medicine so quickly he wouldn’t even notice it”, he answers, and shakes the juice in front of Jack, “and then he’d sip juice after, and it wouldn’t taste bad anymore.”
His mouth is dry, the taste of everything he drank last night as a disgusting mix on his tongue when he slowly takes in the hangover. He feels horrible, but it’s been a while since he’s been that drunk, so he shouldn’t be surprised.
Dean’s stomach growls of hunger, but a small smile tugs at his lips when he looks at the small circle he has drawn around today’s date. He’s just about to run out and across the street to buy lunch, when his phone rings.
“That’s too bad”, Dean pretends to be sad as he leans towards Cas, pushing his hands higher to slide them under his shirt when he leans down for a kiss, “Maybe you should teach that asshole a lesson.”
Dean holds the snacks in Jack’s reach for a moment, but eventually places them back on the table with a sigh, throwing one piece of cucumber in his own mouth. The insides of the vegetable are carved out because Jack hates the texture of it. He fucking carved the insides out for the child, only to have him refuse to eat any.
Dean is having a brotherly argument with Sam that he’s started for no other reason than to entertain himself while he is waiting for Cas to come downstairs. He has memorized where every one of those things have been hanged, so he doesn’t get Sam’s smug smile, when Cas walks into the living room and stops to stand next to him.
When Dean finally opens the story book, Jack pushes the covers aside and gets out of the bed, wordlessly climbing to Dean’s lap, curling up under his arm to listen to the story, eventually falling asleep there.
The kid squints his eyes like he’s a mini version of Cas, leaning towards Dean, “Why do you wanna sleep in Cas’s room?” he asks, tilting his head, “Don’t you like your own room?”
Dean goes through Cas’s tea collection while the water boils, the sound of it filling the silence in the kitchen. Cas left for his meeting, and after Jack had fallen asleep for his nap, Dean called Sam, and his brother invited himself over. They’re out of coffee, but Sam’s a weird tea drinker like Cas, so Dean’s stealing some from him and hopes he doesn’t notice.
“No, it’s not that”, he says, and Cas lays down back again, waiting for Dean to continue, “I usually sleep in the middle”, he clarifies, hoping it doesn’t sound pathetic when he adds:
The doctor smiles warmly at them when she comes in with the diagnosis. Jack, like an average toddler, has otitis.
Dean puts the sound back on the shitty daytime TV show that’s on and leans back on the couch. He wonders just how confused Jack will be this time, when he wakes up and he’s there again instead of Cas.
Dean crosses the room to hand one of the cups to Cas, who has managed to get a spot from the couch. Dean thought he’d just drop the booze and head elsewhere, but when he steps closer, Cas just scoots over to make the tiniest spot for him to sit in.
“Dean, look”, Jack breathes out in awe, and turns to him, holding something, running his tiny fingers over it, “It has Peppa Pig on it.”
“Oh, cool”, Dean smiles, turning towards the TV again, “We’re really living together soon”, he points out, but he’s not actually nervous about it, he’s excited. Which is funny, because they’ve more or less been living together all this time but moving out of his own apartment completely makes it all more real somehow. He shrugs, “Haven’t we dated for almost a month in like a week? I guess it’s about time.”
Dean sighs, knowing an honest answer would get him the keys the fastest. It’s not that Dean has never talked about his love life with Sam. His little brother has too many experiences of awkward small talk moments with Dean’s one night stands the morning after for the topic never coming up.
Donna just smiles at Jo as well, and she does seem the type to never get mad about anything. She drops the conversation and turns towards her coffee again.
He presses a soft kiss to Jack’s hair. He’s about to step away from the picture, but then Jack opens his mouth again. His voice is hesitant, like he’s testing the words in his mouth when he whispers them in the quiet kitchen, resting his head back against Dean’s shoulder:
Cas’s been struggling with work all day, and Dean being loud is not helping. He has no idea if Dean’s fixing his car or just totally wrecking it.
He can see Novak reaching towards him, so he quickly drops down to get more paint on his brush before sprinting away. But Novak is not only perfect at everything, he’s also
“Yeah, Cas, of course you can”, Dean assures and sits down on the barstool next to Cas, leaning towards him, worry making a frown between his brows.
“Apartment 4B, we might have to knock the door down since no one is answering”, Mick says, and they start pulling out the equipment. There’s an ambulance parking behind them.
“Left me bruised all the same”, he pretends to complain. He takes a piece of toast from the bag on the isle and waves the bread at Cas, “I should start throwing stuff at you, see how you like it.”
So, sue him for smiling about the notification paper stuck to their door about their basement laundry room being closed for even longer.
Well, except for Jo, but she’s got the same sense of humor than he has, making comments on their conversations that Dean feels bad for not laughing as loudly as he would want to. She reminds him of Charlie a bit, she seems like a snarkier version of her.
“Because you’re an ass”, Jo deadpans, smiling to Cas over Dean’s shoulder, “Cas is new to the family, I want to give his opinion a chance.”
Yes reason, the possibility for Cas to be there tomorrow is high, since they both are there usually on Thursdays around six.
Dean snaps his eyes open and turns his head to his right, and there’s Cas, lying on his stomach. Based on the numb feeling on Dean’s hand, the man has been lying on his hand for a while already, as sound asleep as Jack on top of him is.
my porridge?” he asks with the Papa Bear voice, frowning exaggeratedly at Dean, who looks like he’s gonna burst into laughter any second.
The man hums an absentminded answer, and walks over, sitting down on the armchair next to the couch, a thoughtful expression on his face.
"Please", Dean rolls his eyes, shrugging it off. He asks about how the spell went down with the rings, and that’s distracting enough for his nerd brother to drop it, not that Dean himself is able to stop thinking about it.
There’s a tiny shop that sells party decorations near their grocery store, and every time they’ve walked past it, Jack wants to stop and look inside the big window, fascinated by all the colorful decorations and balloons and glitter, almost pressing his nose against the glass.
They haven’t been hostile towards each for a while now, but Dean’s thought that’s mostly because they’ve avoided each other. But there’s no denying that Jack cares about them both a lot, and it feels relieving to know that Cas seems to think about it like he does. He would never admit it out loud, but he’s damn happy about Cas’s suggestion.
Dean’s done some serious, stupid mistakes during his life so many times that he has stopped ranking them years ago.
Dean looks down at the hand, his gaze following along his arm and eventually to his eyes. Cas is smiling a little.
this chapter was soooo hard to write because i went so out of my comfort zone with this one, and i'm still not sure if it's quite what i imagined to be, but i really hope you liked it!! <3 if you want to share your thoughts, leave a comment or come scream with me on
The bearded man with shoulders broader than Dean’s pulls him into a hug, “Of course, would I miss the first party in a long time that you’re actually hosting?” the man, Benny says, holding Dean by both shoulders as he smiles at him.
Dean rolls his eyes at him, even though it’s probably true with him and Cas standing there dead serious and awkward and Jack standing in front of them, more interested in the cake behind them than this photoshoot.
“Nothing bad happens, even if you let yourself relax for a moment”, Cas says without looking away from the screen.
If this turns out to be something more, he would have to eventually, but now it seems pointless. Mick seems like a lovely person, but he’s happy for the lack of questions for the moment.
“It’s, you know, easier to moan when you’re drunk and not sure who you’re sleeping with”, Dean grins, adding an exaggerated wink that’s sure to earn a proper eye roll from Cas, and to hide the fact that he would definitely use pet names for real,
Cas suddenly feels like a teenager spying on a crush at a party, and it feels so stupid he has to turn away.
They manage to get the rest of the decorations in a way that more or less pleases all of them. Jo calling Cas family rings inside Dean’s head all the way to dinnertime, and he wishes so badly it would be true, that while Cas is his best friend and his family, he would be part of this family too, in a way they allowed everyone here to believe.
He and Cas meet up at Kelly’s house the day before they’re supposed to pick Jack up. Dean gives him a quick nod, when he gets out of the car and sees Cas already standing at the door, fiddling with the two sets of keys in his hands.
Dean’s phone makes a sound and he checks the message he got, “Bobby needs me at the garage. Is it okay if I go?”
But naptime comes eventually, and after two books, they happily sleep on Dean’s bed together, getting the much needed rest after an hour long play with the toy animals.
Dean frowns at this chick who he has never seen before, but Cas seems to know quite well, considering the way he completely turns his attention to her, opening his arms for the chick to step into a hug.
He steps out and closes the door behind him, and he’s free from this mess of a situation for the next two days. Somehow it doesn’t feel good like the freedom of it probably should feel.
“I think honey is overrated”, Dean explains, and stops the cart in front of the selection of fishes, picking one package up to check it out. “I can see how you are a honey person, but I’m not.” He hands the fish to Cas. “This enough or do you want more?”
“Nice to meet you too”, Cas says and signs the same, because he knows a bit of sign language, and he’s always mindful like that. Dean wants to smack himself for not learning to sign even just that.
“We both need time away from the house and you know it”, Cas says quietly, and Dean agrees. Hell, sometimes they’re at each other’s faces probably just because they’re literally spending every second together, and not because they want to.
He climbs back up to the couch again, holding from the arm rest as he struggles to keep himself balanced, standing there.
And that’s the worst thing: Jack keeps bringing up Kelly, and Dean has no idea how many times he can deal with it, especially with the sleepless brain and a screaming, hangry child who doesn’t understand what’s going on.
Cas can’t help but glance to the living room from the kitchen door, a fond smile tugging at his lips when he sees Jack crawl out of the fort and into Dean’s arms, the man closing his eyes as the small boy climbs into his lap, tiny arms around his neck. Dean presses a kiss into Jack’s hair, and Cas has to look away, doing his best to focus back on the dishes.
“Your favorite birthday present”, Dean helps as he notices Cas is totally out of their conversation. The man looks thoughtful for a moment.
“Not tonight though”, he shakes himself out of wherever watching Benny being sappy took him. He raises his beer, “Tonight we get drunk, and hope this bar gets a bit more crowded than it is.”
“Dean, we got this.” There are excited sounds coming from the kitchen right on time to prove his point, when Eileen asks if Jack wants to measure something. “See? He’s getting used to Eileen as well.”
If that idiot wouldn’t be so annoying, they wouldn’t be in this stupid ‘paint this wall as a punishment while the others go to the lakes to have free time fun because you can’t behave’ mess in the first place.
The last hours of Dean’s shift are much less eventful, which gives Dean too much time to sit around and think about what happened back at their apartment.
And Dean falls in love with him just a bit more, when he makes the air quotation marks around the phrase.
And he sounds like he’s genuinely waiting for an answer. “Yes”, Dean says with an eye roll, “and if all else fails, just take it off and show, you know”, he gestures at Cas, “whatever you got going on underneath all that.”
Cas hasn’t asked Dean how he feels about it all, but he thinks this switching thing worked in the beginning, when they were weighed down with grief and anger and sheer tiredness of being up all night with a crying toddler.
“Besides”, Dean continues, turning it around, “Don’t act all single to me. How’s Andrea?” he asks, and as a fond smile grows on Benny’s lips at the mention of her, he has to tease just a bit more, “When’s
Sam is asking what is going on through his earpiece, but Dean ignores him, making his way to the two.
“You feeling better already, kid?” he asks, not really expecting an answer from a half asleep toddler, but filling the silence anyway, “Had us worried for a second, but the doctor said you’ll be fine”, he stops his hand for a second to put his palm against Jack’s forehead, checking the temperature.
They look taken aback by Jack’s very off-topic question, but the kid just stares at them, clearly more interested in the answer of the question, than anything they’ve talked about before that.
Dean’s eyes grow three sizes when he turns to look at Cas, and his hand on Dean’s. Cas gives his hand a squeeze. “Honey?” he repeats.
Dean heads straight to the bathroom when they arrive upstairs. When he returns to the bedroom, Cas is already dressed in warmer clothes, sitting on the edge of the bed with a thoughtful look on his face. Without saying anything, Dean goes to his backpack to search for clothes as well.
The man chuckles, putting the cigarette off against the grass, before pulling a small glass jar he’s hidden underneath the terrace, showing that this is not the first time he’s smoking there, “And throw away a perfect opportunity for a promotion everyone would be jealous to get?”
“That’s the spirit, grab some plates and dig in”, Dean smiles and points at the table stacked with the food.
Benny agrees to that, clinking his glass against Dean’s. The beers are downed fast, and soon it’s time to do shots. As they get more drunk, the bar gets more crowded and by the time Dean’s got his arm around someone pretty, it almost feels like a Friday night.
Cas tries to lure him out as well, but Jack does what he always does if he’s angry but doesn’t bother to argue: he ignores them.
, Cas breathes, letting his head fall forward, his whole upper body following, “I am in no shape to take care of a child right now, Dean.”
Unborn baby Jack might be a miracle maker for real, in the way the bickering from earlier is washed away as the three of them share the happy baby bubble together.
“Yeah, well, Jack drooled all over it earlier at nap time, so you ain’t special”, Dean jokes, tone easy as it usually is, but there’s something weird in the way he looks at Cas. If he didn’t know better, Cas would say he looks affectionate. They’re under a blanket, so Dean must’ve put it over them while he slept.
“Stop staring”, Sam calls them out without turning to look, and the two force themselves to sit on the kitchen table, to keep themselves from stalking.
And not that he doesn’t trust Sam, kid’s a genius and taking care of a toddler for an hour doesn’t really require huge brains, he himself is literally proof of that. It’s just the first time ever that Jack’s alone with someone other than him or Cas, and he’s scared they scarred him for life with abandonment issues or some shit.
Dean stares at one of the crying children on the cover. He’s barely dealing with this crap himself, how he’s supposed to be there for a toddler dealing with it. She was his mother for fuck’s sake.
Cas doesn’t answer, but he takes a step behind as Dean drops his bathrobe. He thinks maybe he should say something, but Dean’s staring him down as he joins him under the water, and suddenly there’s hands on him, wandering all around his body, and the shampoo bottle slips from Cas’s hands as he pulls Dean closer.
It’s not the smile he’s seen on Dean’s face before, dimmer somehow, but it’s a smile, and Cas gets an urge to say something, but as soon as he opens his mouth, it’s gone again, and Dean gets up.
Days go by quickly one after another, just binge-watching movies, cooking and baking, spending time outside when it’s not snowing too much and suddenly it’s Christmas morning.
Cas doesn’t answer but continues scrolling through the movies. Before he can choose any, Dean grabs the remote from him.
Dean frowns a bit for his question, flicking his eyes away briefly. Eventually he shrugs, “I’m okay”, he says, somehow neutral, somehow still confused about the awkward conversation starter.
Anna’s luck has turned up as well, he notices, when she arrives at the break room where he’s currently alone. She gives him a smile as a hello before going to pour herself some coffee as well.
So, when she lets go of Dean for a second and says she’s going to grab another drink from the kitchen, Dean’s not joining her because he takes the moment to talk to Benny and Andrea who just arrived. He’s also busy ignoring the fact that Cas is nowhere to be seen.
. He’s so used to seeing Novak here every summer he hasn’t even thought about not spending a part of his summer getting annoyed at the too serious boy who uses weird words and has the most beautiful eyes Dean has ever glared at.
He’s surprised to have Eileen open the door for him when he rings the doorbell. He’s glad Jack isn’t running into his arms crying with terror, but he is surprised. And a tiny part of him is just a little bit disappointed.
“Dean.” Bobby speaks firmly, like he’s making a point at each word, “You’re a good dad, so don’t go around thinking otherwise.”
“Guests are not allowed further into the apartment until they’ve downed one of these welcoming drinks I’ve been friendly enough to make for you all”, Charlie explains as the two eye doubtfully at the disgusting, colorful liquids in the cups, “Them’s the rules.”
Dean looks at the calm expression on her face after she’s dropped the bomb. He glances at Cas who, by the frown on his face, is also processing the information.
When Jack seems to be comfortable enough to run his own party, Dean lets himself chill for a bit. He joins Benny and Andrea on the bench by the backyard fence.
Dean grabs his plate for him after he’s given Jack one and puts pancakes on it before handing it back.
“Choose something without wrappers”, Cas orders before turning around, probably to grab the popcorn from the other side of the aisle, leaving Dean and the girl staring after him.
Jody seems like a really good mom, the way she’s always making Dean feel better like he’s a little boy like Jody’s own kid. He takes a sip of the coffee, and realizes he’s mentioned Cas while he was whining, but luckily no one asked about him.
“It seems so”, Cas says and moves to sit on the couch, “I think it’s only fair. We did interrupt something he was in the middle of, apparently.”
The day before the party goes mostly around cleaning the house and preparing things in the kitchen. Dean had ordered the cake from a bakery, but he’s planning on baking and cooking everything else by himself.
Cas takes the plate and catches Dean’s eyes with his own. “With your math skills you should be able to calculate the right amount by now.”
“I don’t know”, Dean answers honestly. He didn’t realize he was until Cas pointed it out. He sits down next to him, “Makes you look very, I don’t know, human.”
Dean sits down on the edge of the coffee table to be on the same level with Jack, which according to Cas’s research is important when you have serious conversations with children. Cas squeezes to the tiny space left next to him.
“And Castiel”, Sam smiles at him when he let’s go of his brother, “So glad that you”, he makes a hand gesture between Cas and Dean, “joined us this year.”
This is a shaky plan at best, and Dean’s about to give up and head to the bar to get as much free alcohol in his system as he can, before heading back to Sam, when his eyes land on a familiar, dark brown hair and a jawline that’s covered in clean stubble. Fuck.
Dean gives it a more critical glance, “Lacks in glitter, but it’s okay, I guess. Why’d you draw me so short?”
He had felt enough alright, to be kissing the guy at their front door. Dean’s brows turn into a frown as he challenges Cas with his gaze, “Chill, I didn’t say you
“And you do the laundry”, Castiel continues, voice low, nodding towards the pile of neatly folded clothes before leaning his back against the sofa, “and you take very good care of our home and our children.”
But Dean wants to say something, he wants to know how to. He wants to comfort Cas, get that awful sad smile away from his face, but he has no idea how. He just settles to look at Cas, while the man fiddles with the cloth in his hands, and desperately tries to figure out some words.
“Of course, man!” Sam nods furiously, “I mean Eileen’s here too so—” it seems that this is the point he remembers her. He turns around so she can see him speak, “Oh shit, Eileen, this is my brother Dean and that’s Castiel.”
It was a huge ass nest, and there was no way Dean and Sam could’ve handled that on their own, so they left it to be solved last.
He could lie, but he doesn’t want to, not to Jody, because she’s met the woman three times, and she feels already close to him.
“I’m Charlie”, the redhead introduces herself, holding a hand out for him to take. He shakes it quickly.
“Do you love each other?” Jack cuts him off with a casual question, like he’s asking what’s for dinner. Or more like he’s asking what’s for dinner and knowing it’s going to be his favorite meal.
“I never wanted kids”, Dean starts, and it’s like speaking the words out loud hurts, but he forces them out, “because I—my dad, uh, growing up he wasn’t very—good at the whole being a father and all.” He doesn’t go into details, because it’s hard enough already, “And to turn into him, I—I didn’t want to risk that. I don’t want any kid going through that, not if I can stop it.”
The bathroom is so tiny it takes two steps for Dean to reach him, that flirty smile playing on his lips, “Don’t you think there’s enough room for both of us?”
Like how he has a frown for too many emotions, and how Dean’s gotten pretty good at figuring out, from
He feels weirdly relieved about how he’s actually having second thoughts about ending the night there. But it’s too late, they’re already at the door, and it’s a wrong one.
He checks that Jack’s still sound asleep before heading back to the kitchen. Dean stays silent for an hour like he promised, but Cas still has problems focusing on his work.
It’s silent inside, of course it is, because no one is home. The absence of something, someone, who should be there feels crushing, as they walk through the hallway that opens up to the living room.
Dean takes a deep breath, staring at one of the posters on the wall. Cas repeats himself. Dean takes another breath, nodding.
works alone. He must’ve gotten help with that one, there’s no way he got the ring alone and made it out alive. Whatever, they have two, he only has one. “Show off.”
“Okay”, Jack says again, his smile unwavering as he’s already sliding down from the chair, but Cas stops him.
Jack gets up as well and says he wants to get the football, but before either of them can do anything about it, he’s going across the yard to get it. Jody spots him there and holds her hands out, and they can hear her asking him to throw the ball to her. Jack considers for a moment, and it looks like he’s about to return to them, but suddenly he throws the ball to Jody, who catches it and throws it back to him.
“My turn to make drinks, right?” he rambles and rushes back inside before Cas can finish whatever he was going to say.
“Yeah”, Dean hums, realizing he is again, when Charlie points it out. Shouldn’t be surprising, he’s been doing that a lot more since that night.
Dean would be lying if he said kissing Cas is the only thing he’s daydreamed about like an idiot, but the actual feeling of
He doesn’t look awful when he’s a mess, but he definitely looks good now, even if he doesn’t look like his normal self. And Dean can think like that, because he has eyes.
The woman takes it as the joke Dean intended it to be, chuckling a bit, “I remember when me and my husband were as young as you two”, she muses, “Oh, he drove me crazy.”
him and his crap, there’s Jack who loves him but doesn’t put up with his bullshit. It doesn’t feel like it’s gonna fall apart any second.
“Hey, it’s not that bad, don’t worry”, Dean laughs and tortures himself with another gulp of the drink, just because it brings a slightly disgusted, but a fond smile on Cas’s slips when he does.
“We should sleep”, Dean says and Cas makes a sound of agreement, before crawling closer to Dean, who is already holding his arms open for him, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, like this wasn’t the first time they’re close like this. Cas settles in on Dean’s arms and they are both passed out in a second.
“And I think a little ice cream wouldn’t hurt either”, she says secretively to Jack, “if your parents allow it.”
Cas frowns at that, unbuttoning the top buttons of his shirt as he walks to the kitchen, and Dean follows him. “Are you mad that I came home?”
Cas just glares forward, pointedly not looking at Dean, and says nothing. Dean laughs loud as he reverses from Cas’s yard to the road.
That’s one of the annoying things about toddlers, they’re too young to understand that the bad tasting thing is actually helping them, and the adults aren’t doing it for their own sick entertainment.
“Sometimes I would like to just quit my job”, Cas continues after a moment of silence and Dean turns to look at him, “I don’t hate it, but I’m not enjoying it either”, he keeps his eyes in the distance and takes another drag, blowing the smoke out, “And after this long, horrible day, I’m thinking about it again”, he finishes, looking at Dean.
He pulls Cas with him down the hallway to their bedroom, and they’re both snoring within minutes after landing on the bed.
They’ve been doing so well lately with the three of them, so Dean’s pissed off Cas had to ruin it with this. Even if, deep down, he knows he’s the one who really ruined it.
Now that he’s experienced the reality of it, he’s found it being the exact opposite, and hell if it isn’t better than he ever could’ve imagined.
Dean used to be a man with a free will, a king of his own life, really, no one told him what to do. He has a Netflix show on pause in the living room.
The waiter puts drinks in front of them. They take sips in silence, until suddenly Cas comes up with an idea. He’s eyeing a small group of people nearby them, listening to their conversation.
Dean stares back at him for a moment, thinking about what he could say to that. Eventually he decides he doesn’t really want to say anything and turns to put the key to the lock.
Rowena stomps the floor once with her foot, and the floor vibrates a bit, probably half out of magic, half out of annoyance. "
Cas gives Bobby a polite smile and nods at that. Dean shoulders his backpack and grabs his and Cas’s bags from the floor.
Cas would think the situation in his boxers would've gone away with the unsexy environment and the amount of embarrassment, but somehow he’s still as hard as he was when he woke up, the ghost of dream Dean’s touch on his skin still.
They stay quiet for a moment, and with no sense of time left, Cas has no idea how long they stand there. He can’t bring himself to move or to talk.
And watching Cas suffer through that is amazing, the man on the bed moaning and moving against his hand, frustrated as Dean trails his fingertips on his thigh, working the one finger he got inside Cas, slow and steady.
Jack says, sounding so much like Dean when he does. He’s picking up so many phrases from the other man, Cas is glad Dean’s able to tone down the swearing in front of the child, or they’d have a toddler screaming
“Notification about the laundry rooms”, he answers, giving the paper to Sam, “Apparently they can’t repair the machine, so they have to order a new one or something.”
Now that it’s out there, maybe he should’ve not gone that much into detail. Feeling embarrassed at everything he just said, he adds:
Then again, the person walking past them is the only other person he sees there, so he lets Jack browse through the pages in peace. While he waits for him to finish, he goes through the children’s books on the shelf next to Jack, picking up the ones that he’d think Jack would like.
Jack turns to look, and the overwhelming joy that lights up his face is very comforting to Dean. The toddler almost trips over when he rushes to get up and runs into Dean’s arms.
Sam gives them a moment, before he starts the teasing, “We didn’t need to call 911, thank you very much.”
“My apologies”, he says, “but this is the last summer we’re going to attend this camp together and I just wanted to make the most out of it.”
Dean’s always had a habit of forgetting his bracelets everywhere around the house where he just happens to take them off, and he’s always finding them in random places around his apartment.
“Not at all”, Cas assures, glancing out from the kitchen window that’s faced to the backyard, the sounds of Dean and Jack running around quieted by the wall.
“Jack misses me when he’s with Cas, he misses Cas when he’s with me and—" he shrugs, “I miss him while I’m gone. And it
“I can see that”, Cas returns the smile Jack’s giving him. He looks at Dean, “He’s just finished his night snack.”
Cas had asked him about it once, before they went to bed one night, to make sure if he’s okay with it, or if they should find some other word for Jack to call him. Because Cas is like that, because he gets his crap.
Dean stares at the sky instead and they lay there silent for a moment, squinting because of the sunlight. He tries to wipe away the paint from his cheek, but it’s not really coming off.
Dean drops the hand and opens the fridge. “Since we’re responsible adults, I think drinking something non-alcoholic at the end of the night is mandatory.” He stops to look at the shelf on the door, and the tiny juice boxes there.
“Get off my ass, Bobby, nothings wrong!” he shouts as he pushes himself up from the floor with the force of his words, suddenly sounding like someone else.
Cas closes the blanket door carefully, and goes around the fort, lifting the blanket and crawling inside, leaving himself out from the waist down as he lays there on his stomach, propped up on his elbows.
He’s not twenty anymore either, he can really tell that now as he shifts his aching, hungover body on the bed, pushing himself to sit. He presses his hands to his temples, but it does nothing to the pounding pain behind his eyes.
He lifts Jack to sit on the kitchen counter, where the kid empties the whole box, spending a long moment going through the band-aids one by one before making his decision, and Dean lets him take his time.
Cas blinks, staring at Dean and desperately trying to forget the image of him pulling his naked body close.
When they finally arrive at the pickup point in the school yard, oil stained book in Claire’s backpack, Jack is already waiting for them.
They switch the subject on to some college stuff Sam’s got going on, and Dean’s glad to have something else to think about for a moment. Sam pours them both more coffee, and Dean tries to get Jack to join them at the table, but the kid doesn’t want to get any closer to Sam, apparently.
i do have to point out that kissing on the mouth, or anything else for that matter, did nothing to them still being the idiots they are, though.
he adds, when he remembers it was his turn to serve. Jody answers with a thumbs up emoji. His phone buzzes for another message from her.
The smile on Jo’s face is so wide and she’s clearly holding back some excited sounds, Dean is already embarrassed.
He puts his toothbrush on the mug where Cas’s brush, the spare one from his apartment, already is, before turning off the lights.
“Yeah, uh, sorry about that”, Dean says. He wants to come clean about this to Jo, that in his defense,
Cas notices Dean facing away from them at that. He clears his throat. He doesn’t have an explanation that would be understandable and satisfying for a three-year-old.
are.” He opens the fridge to grab something to eat, “He threw a toy car at me this morning, because he got mad about the clothes, that
The kid wraps his arms around Dean’s legs, hugging him tightly, and there’s a lump in Dean’s throat when he swallows. He almost can’t look down, because he knows the kid is smiling up at him, and he doesn’t deserve the smile, not right now.
“Then you gave me a beer.” The exact same brand, Dean knows he must’ve bought it on purpose. They used to have it at the store, where he used to work before starting his own business. “And you looked very handsome working under the hood of my car.”
Bobby cuts his polite speech off with a wave of a hand, “None of that Mr. Singer crap in here, call me Bobby.” He shakes Cas’ hand, “And it’s no problem, the more the merrier.”
“I—” he starts, “I am—the last time we were here I—” he can’t form a fucking sentence to save his life, it’s impossible to put words to the feeling he has in his head.
They’re watching TV when Cas comes home, greeting them from the door. He joins them in the living room, dropping down on one of the armchairs since Dean’s hoarded all of the couch to himself. Cas somehow looks even more tired than Dean feels.
“Glad you could make it”, he says, when they’re close enough, shaking Sean’s hand. He’d invited Jo earlier but decided to invite Jody too only a day before on instinct when they were alone at the park.
“Your back is not made for sleeping on a couch”, Cas eventually says, shaking Dean back into reality.
Dean looks up at Cas, waiting for him to protest or say he should go to his own room or something, but Cas just shrugs. Jack gives the empty space next to him a pat, inviting Dean there.
He shoots an angry glance at the dark haired boy in question, who stands next to him, holding two paint brushes.
Dean lets him wear all of them to the store, just to get out of the room quickly before Cas starts stripping again.
Dean sits down on the toilet seat and guards the shitty, cut in half bracelet he gave to a three-year-old, just because the child ordered him to do so.
He walks around the house even though his hangover begs him to lie down, but he can’t stay still. It gives him too much time to think about this morning, and he’s too tired and hurt to do it.
He can’t stop touching the man, running a hand up and down his arm to assure himself he’s really awake.
Charlie turns Dean around, looking at him firmly while Jo kneels next to Cas as well, examining him.
“I think Cas hurts too”, the kid suddenly says as he puts the band-aid on Dean’s foot, continuing before Dean can make himself ask about it.
He forces his face to a normal expression before turning around to look at the kid, who’s already looking at him from the kitchen table, a crayon absentmindedly hanging between his fingers.
, like he’s something special or whatever and his heartbeat gets faster as his brain processes Cas’s words, and he just keeps looking at him, and Dean needs the mistletoe above them again.
The three of them head to the living room where Cas is with Eileen and Sam. He gets up as they enter the room, holding out a hand with a small, polite smile on his face.
He expects Cas to answer something annoying back, but instead he hears the man getting up. “In that case I have a price for you.” Dean lifts his hand from his face in interest.
“Oh, okay”, Cas says, adjusting the hem of his shirt to give his hands something to do, but not making a move to go outside. He glances out the window where Jack, sitting on Dean’s lap, is ripping open a present from Jody and Owen.
isn’t awful enough, they have to work with Cas of all people. Sam doesn’t have a problem with that because he’s friends with everyone, and to be honest he’s just as weird as Cas is. They fall into a conversation about the translations for the spell, and Dean gives himself permission to zone out for that part.
When Dean turns to look for him, he finds him crouching at the small garden at the front yard he and Jack had put up not that long ago.
Dean does the dishes, silently boiling inside and constantly swallowing it down. That stupid argument over
The hangover definitely dampens the mood of the kiss compared to the ones last night, but that’s not the point, this kiss is perfect in a different way, with a bad morning breath and a promise of something starting.
“Now, how big of a sandcastle you think we can build?” she asks in a tone that's sure to get any kid's attention, “Let's build the biggest castle ever while Dean grabs something from the stroller real quick, huh?”
They’re coming back from a cat in a tree rescue turned into rescuing a man rescuing the cat, but eventually they’d gotten everyone down on the ground safely.
“That settles it”, Charlie decides, “No one should enter the dad years in the life without having played this game.”
This is the longest they’ve spent together at the apartment for a while now, but it works perfectly. They both have their own tasks that require as little communication as possible.
“You won’t tell Jack if I drink one of these?” he turns to ask Cas, showing him the drink, “I swear he keeps count on these."
“I have to fix her before I drive to work tomorrow.” There’s more clattering as Dean is trying to find the next tool he needs. Cas thinks it’s either that or he just rummages to make as much noise as he can.
Soft, heartfelt moments with a four-year-old can’t be too long, apparently, because the next thing Jack does is he’s getting rid of the limbs wrapped around him to grab the board game from the coffee table.
There’s still a light on in the living room, but at the front door it’s darker, the light from the streetlamp dim on them, as they stop at the door.
Would be weirder if he didn’t, and it would be even more awkward to try and take his hand away. He’s not blushing either, it’s the heat of the apartment and not the way Cas seems to relax against him the second Dean’s palm is on his shoulder.
If they would’ve thrown a party like this few months ago it would’ve turned into dead bodies buried to the backyard for sure, but as things have gotten so much better in such a short period of time, Dean’s positive about tonight.
Dean places a comforting hand on the little guy’s head. “I’m here with Jack, he’s—” Whatever he’s supposed to say, he can’t. “Three.”
So, he just sits down and settles for glaring at his brother. But he’s happy to notice that Cas is blushing a bit as well, so he’s not completely alone in this embarrassment.
When the bedsheet drops from his body as he sits up, and the cold air in the room hits his skin, he realizes he’s naked.
“I don’t like this”, Jack states and puts the piece of steak he’s grabbed back to the plate, after taking the tiniest bite of it. He spits the piece to the plate as well, and Cas is clearly holding back a grin when he watches Dean’s heart crumble into pieces.
“You say that too!” she points out, quite loudly too. Dean gives an apologetic smile to some woman walking past his car before looking down at Claire again.
“Oh, I almost forgot!” She holds a hand up and tells them to stay right there before disappearing to the kitchen for a second. She returns with a tray of drinks in her hand, demanding they both take one.
Kasey is still standing there, eyes flicking between the two, and Jack on Cas’s arms. Dean’s dumbfounded look fits the situation perfectly, and as realization hits her, the flirtatious smile on her lips fades away.
Dean’s old room turns into a storage space for now. Jack enjoys the increasing amount of big cardboard boxes he can turn into tiny houses and hiding places and towers taller than himself.
Now that they are ‘together’ they can’t really change the sleeping arrangement without it seeming weird, but so far it hasn’t caused any awkward situations. Seeing Cas next to him before falling asleep and seeing him the first thing in the morning feels so natural and good it would be scary, if Dean would be a reasonable person and actually think about it. Blissful ignorance has worked good for now, and Cas hasn’t caught him staring at him in the morning, so that’s a plus.
He picks the kid up in his arms, holding him close. “Hi, Jack”, he instantly smiles at the kid, before greeting Sam.
The others end up choosing a movie that’s just started on some random channel, and Dean is doing his best to focus on it, but Cas falls asleep on his arms during the first fifteen minutes, and he fails miserably.
Dean stares at the dark mess of hair on the pillow next to him for a moment, feeling comfortable even lying just on the left side of the bed, before closing his eyes.
He walks closer to the living room window, trying to get a look at the driveway to see what kind of shitty car this dude drives. He’s sounded pretty boring in Cas’s descriptions of him, so he’s probably driving some eco-friendly sensible piece of crap.
Jack might’ve given Dean the perfect way out of that phone call with Sam, but it came with shitty consequences, because it’s been almost two hours, and the kid’s still not down.
“That darn girl”, Donna sighs and glances at the direction where the other kids are, too far away to hear them, “She’s a six year old teenager”, she states, “I thought I would have a few more years to prepare, but based on the emotional meltdown I had to witness this morning, oh boy.”
Charlie holds her hand up, ignoring him, “Are you saying that you two slept together and just… are not going to talk about it, ever?” she asks him, like he’s stupid, “What are you, idiots? You have a kid together!”
“Coming!” Dean shouts to the kid, and after stealing a few more, quick kisses from Cas, he takes his coffee mug from the counter before heading to the living room to help Jack.
“I know”, Cas says, almost too quiet for him to hear even though the man is standing right in front of him, “I know how you feel.”
They succeeded in charming Rowena enough to get her to invite them over to her house for the event she’s hosting there, while also getting a pretty sure confirmation that the ring will be at the house during the event.
“Snack break”, he tells Jack, and grabs the boy in his arms even if he doesn’t want to cooperate right away. “We’ll make more cakes after we’ve eaten a bit”, he assures and hopes that Jack will behave. The other adults make him nervous about his parenting performance, because that’s what it is now that there’s people watching him, a performance.
“The point is to see how much sugar you can eat before your stomach hurts”, Dean explains, giving Cas a serious look, before he peeks into the strollers, “You want some pastries, kid?”
“No, no, no”, Dean rushes to assure firmly. He doesn’t want Cas thinking that even for a second, “No. I’m officially off the market for anyone else but you, Cas, I don’t want–if you’d be–okay with that?”
There’s a lump in Dean’s throat suddenly, when he looks at Jack smiling and making car sounds, busy trying all the levers and buttons he can find. The thing’s completely dead, so he’s safe to do so.
“He’s a nerd”, Dean states to Charlie, but he doesn’t sound mean when he says it. Charlie sides with Cas on this though, and they fall into an identity conversation like they’d be old friends already.
“Yeah”, Dean says, and smiles friendly at the couple who are walking past him towards the grand entrance of the museum. He looks at the small crowds of people that are hanging around the huge lobby, self consciously tugging at the sleeve of his tux a bit. He hates cases that require monkey suits, but you don’t go undercover to steal a cursed ring, that’s caused three dead people last week alone, wearing jeans. Sam’s lucky enough to be good around computers, so this part falls to him every time.
Jack gets excited by the idea of a birthday, asking questions that Dean tries his best to answer, like if they can have cake then, or will he also get a lot of presents like Peppa, will there be a magic show too and so on. He tells Jack a story of one of his favorite birthdays, when he got a fire truck as a present.
“Give me that”, he grunts and puts on the first action movie there is on the Recommended for You list. They lean against the couch as the movie’s opening credits start rolling.
Cas could literally just stand there doing nothing and be the hottest thing Dean’s ever laid his eyes on, probably.
The other blonde lady, Donna, turns fully towards them and greets them with a wide smile on her soft face.
“Back at the museum. Didn’t mean to piss you off with it”, Dean explains, blaming the pain medication fucking up with the connection between his mouth and his brain, “or okay, I did", he admits honestly, "but I’m sorry anyway.”
Cas is about to say something, but before he does, his eyes suddenly flick at somewhere behind Dean, and he pushes himself past him, disappearing into the crowd. Dean curses under his breath, downs the champagne in one go and leaves the glass at the bar before going after him.
Cas had seen the list of ideas Jack had come up with, and it had been interesting and surprisingly detailed.
For one, if the social workers called him, they’ll call Cas as well, and two, they haven’t talked since the night at the hospital, and now that the initial shock of it all has gone past and he’s got it under control, he realizes he’s said some nasty shit to Cas. And frankly, he isn’t excited to deal with all that for as long as he can avoid it.
“Hey, it worked”, Dean shrugs, smiling triumphantly. His smile falters a bit when Cas steps closer, staring him down, his voice low when he growls.
Cas is full on grinning when Dean roars loudly, but then falls to the grass the second Jack pushes him a bit. The kid steps closer to check if he’s really okay, and Dean just grabs him in the air, lying on his back as he holds the wiggling kid above him.
The best difference between house parties and sophisticated adult barbecues with only a reasonable amount of alcohol involved is that people actually clean up after themselves before they leave. The last guests helped them carry all the stuff inside, even if they tried to protest, so when everyone’s gone, there’s only a huge pile of dishes next to the sink to tell there even were guests over in the first place.
Cas is trapped against the opposite wall, sitting down, head hanging, but the same invisible force keeping him pinned there. They’re alone in the room.
“Shut up, you idjit”, Bobby rolls his eyes and gets up, folding the paper before dropping it to the chair. He waves the two to follow him, “Come on.”
Stomachs full of breakfast, the six of them make their way to the living room while Bobby and Ellen head out to find a Christmas tree. Dean rushes in first to get the best place on the couch, landing to lay there with a smirk on his face as the rest of them walk in behind him, rolling their eyes as Eileen and Sam take one of the arm chairs, and Jo sits on the floor to lean on the other chair, letting Charlie sit on it.
Dean doesn’t really look at Cas, because he doesn’t feel like it. He’s feeling shitty enough already as he makes his way towards the front door.
Charlie’s targeting inspires other people to target their friends, which leads to people bickering with each other so much that even if it’s quite funny, Charlie eventually makes a rule that targeting, from now on, would be forbidden.
“Dude”, she gives him the look he was already expecting to get, “I know all your hangovers, and this is not your ‘I had fun time last night’ hangover, this is a ‘something’s wrong’ hangover”, she explains like it’s obvious, “So, what’s wrong?”
him, and the paint covering his hand has dried bit but it’s still sticky when Dean takes a hold of it as he deepens the kiss, holding the other boy close.
“Okay”, his uncle pretends to buy into it before grimacing, “And don’t pretend you couldn't use some beauty sleep, you ain’t that pretty.”
Cas works his way down from Dean’s lips to his jaw and down his neck, leaving kisses wherever his lips land when he moves. He remembers the last time he’s heard Dean use a phrase similar to that.
Now that the game is paused, Charlie takes the time to change the settings she had complained about before, “How did Cas take it?”
“It was a nice party”, Charlie breaks the comfortable silence between the two of them, and Dean hums in agreement. “Jack’s learning from the best, soon he’s partying like a Winchester back in his days”, she continues and they both laugh a bit at that.
He can’t help but smile, when the kid runs towards Dean and the man scoops him up and in the air, the kid giggling as he lands back on Dean’s arms.
Dean’s lucky, because Jack doesn’t bring up that word again that night, and they spend a surprisingly good and calm time watching cartoons and playing with toy trucks until it’s bath time.
The nurse asks some questions, and as Cas answers them and she writes something down based on that, Dean has time to take the situation in.
Jack arrives at the doorway and asks if they could go outside to play monster, and when Dean agrees to it, Cas gets up and says he should get some work done, to give himself an out and an explanation to Jack.
Cas has his eyes closed, and Dean doesn’t have the heart to wake up the other man, and it’s not like it’s uncomfortable letting Cas sleep there. Dean allows himself to look at Cas for a second, the peaceful look on his face, eyelashes resting against his cheeks, lips a bit parted as he breathes.
Start your own business, while you have two kids and a husband who works in three shifts at the hospital, they said. It’ll be fun, they said.
Surprisingly enough, it doesn’t take the whole book for Jack to fall asleep, and when his hold of Dean’s hand loosens, and he can pull it away without protesting from Jack’s side, he closes the book, but stays for a moment on the floor, looking at the sleeping kid.
Dean listens as Cas clearly takes something forbidden from Jack, and he can’t make out Jack’s exact words, but it sounds like he’s disagreeing with Cas on the matter.
Now that he takes in the sounds from around the house, he can hear that Jack and Dean are already awake, doing something in the kitchen, based on the sounds he could make through the walls. He gets up and puts on a pair of college pants before leaving his bedroom.
“Shut up”, Dean mutters, causing Cas to frown. “I was talking to the bitch in my ear”, he explains, once again ignoring Sam’s groaning.
“Right. Uh.” Dean scratches the back of his neck. He glances at Cas and smiles fondly, like he can’t help but do every time he looks at the man.
Sometimes, more often than not, Dean spends the night at his apartment, pretending it helps but it doesn’t. Sometimes Cas spends nights away too.
, which means making decisions, and if Jack is bad at something, it’s knowing what the fuck he wants.
“Don’t give him any ideas”, Kelly smirks, speaking under her breath like she’s afraid the baby will hear her. She hooks her arm on Dean’s, guiding him across the yard and towards the back door, instead of the barbeque he was waiting for. “I have something important to talk to you about.”
Cas is a smart guy, Dean gives him that with a wink. He suggests that Cas figures his work shit out first, and he’ll check his after that, and Cas agrees to it.
Dean’s not trying to avoid this Lisa chick. He had approached the group of women when Charlie kept desperately signaling him to do so and chatted with them for a while. And he spent some time with Lisa when the group left them alone and had a conversation about nothing in general. She seems friendly and nice, she’s obviously hot and, based on Charlie’s intel, very bendy.
The three of them lay there, playing with the stuffed animals and just talking. Dean asks him about his day at work, Jack explains about something almost nonstop, and suddenly it’s time for dinner.
“Cas”, Dean greets with a shy smile when he is close enough, stopping in front of Castiel. The dark-haired man doesn’t make a move to get inside and Dean really doesn’t know what to do. He stands there awkwardly for a moment, staring at the other man before he gets a grip of himself.
Right before naptime, Jack decides he wants all of the attention Dean could possibly give him, but somehow manages to not be satisfied with anything Dean tries to offer, and the setup for the end of the world is ready.
When Dean arrives at work twenty minutes late, he’s rushing in with Jack stacked under one arm and his backpack with things thrown into it under the other. Bobby gives him an amused look behind the newspaper he’s reading on one of the chairs by the wall, but Dean’s just glad he got himself and Jack into proper clothing before he ran the two out of the house.
That gets Jack’s interest. He runs to the kitchen to see what Eileen’s doing and to get some of that sugar in him.
Dean can’t stop himself. He brushes a gentle finger over Cas’s paint stained cheekbone. He manages to get a little bit of paint on the same exact spot every time he’s working on something. “Don’t worry about it, I’m just damn happy you’re okay”, he says around the lump back in his throat, “Got me worried for a second.”
“Sam puts all the golden decorations on the same spot, it looks stupid”, Dean whines when Sam pushes him further away from him as he tries to remove the decorations Sam’s just hung up.
“Me and him, we’re not—it’s complicated. Our mutual friend, Jack’s mom, she—uh, she—” The words get stuck in his throat, but it’s further than he's ever gotten with talking about it. He has to look away from Jack.
“Hey! Language”, he lectures as he opens the car door for her. He’s already picking up his daughter because she was being violent at school and gaining disapproving looks from other parents who are picking up the kids with shorter school days, he doesn’t need them judging him for her vocabulary too.
He can’t make out the car in the darkness and with the reflection of the window, but he spots Cas and that Mick guy standing on the front porch, talking about something. He backs away on instinct, because he doesn’t want Cas to think he’s spying on him or some weird shit.
When he steps back inside, Jack’s almost eaten his plate empty, which is impressive. Cas wonders that they’ve probably done something that has made Jack tired and hungry to get him to eat so well. The two-day hell at work is weighing him down, but he’s happy that Dean took care of the dinner.
“Well”, Dean starts, trying to reason his actions, “I am going to change the bed sheets tomorrow so, you know”, he shrugs, “More laundry at the same time.”
, but somehow it doesn’t bother Dean like it usually does when someone tries to talk about it. Which is why he bites his teeth together so hard his chin aches, to keep himself from saying anything more.
wants to kiss the angry expression Cas has on his face, and he’s so close Dean could do it even without having to lean in, he’s so close it could happen without trying, so Dean closes his eyes, turning his head slightly, his nose brushing against Cas’s—
It doesn’t take Dean long after that, the way Cas feels around him, the way he looks, splayed in front of him, eyes shut and come on his sweaty stomach and chest, breathing hard, all of it enough to push him over the edge as well.
“No, Cas”, Dean holds his hand firmly, shaking his head. “Don’t worry about it. As long as you’re okay.”
“I’m just assuming you’re going to do something that takes the whole night and maybe the day after”, he explains when Dean looks at him with a questioning look.
When he’s done, Dean checks Cas’s expression to see just how much he’s struggling with holding in his amusement or second-hand embarrassment. He’s surprised by the look he meets.
So, Thursday evenings become the highlights of Dean’s weeks and he and Sam always have clean clothes and warm, soft bed sheets and towels (since using the dryer gives the two more time to spend together). So, it is a win-win situation.
Cas turns to look at him from where he’s kneeling on the floor, “You take your jewelry off before showering, right?”
eat candy that’s in a wrapper”, Cas explains, “It’s loud, and then the wrappers are everywhere, and it’s just annoying.”
He gives himself permission to touch Cas a bit more. They’re already really close with each other as friends, but now they touch more frequently than before. Small, brief touches come so naturally in different situations Dean almost stops thinking about it.
He, of course, wishes his daughter would not get in trouble in the first place, but he hopes the next time it happens – and he knows it will – it will be on Cas’ day off, because when they both work, it’s always Dean who’s able to leave work for it.
Sam frowns at his brother as he starts to wash the dishes, “You have been whining about me not doing the laundry and now you want to do it?”
That’s the only thought in Cas’s mind always during the first mile, when he’s running and his lungs are killing him. This time more than usually, because he just smoked a cigarette before running, which he usually doesn’t do, because it’s stupid and he knows it.
Their noses are brushing, and Dean keeps his eyes closed when he breathes the same air with Cas, and it all feels so unreal that a quiet chuckle escapes his lips.
“Someone calling about Jack”, Dean answers, fiddling with the phone in his hands. Up until this point being a godparent has been three babysitting cases and buying gifts on birthdays and Christmases, but this seems bigger than that.
Something about the gentlemanlike gesture makes something warm flutter in Cas’s chest for the first time that evening.
They still have Charlie’s birthday invitations stuck to their fridge door, so one afternoon Jack comes to the realization that he should have invitations as well.
Cas promptly points at the open door behind Dean, face red from embarrassment and growing anger, “Go!”
They’ve chatted a few times about going for a coffee or something, but it’s been hard trying to match their busy schedules. Cas didn’t expect him to show up on his door.
Dean closes his eyes and leans his forehead against Castiel’s. “You are the perfect man”, he says, “What did do right to deserve you?”
Dean dips his way too small brush into the bucket and sloppily starts brushing the paint on the wall. Novak next to him takes some paint on his brush too but examines what Dean is doing.
Jack wakes up from his nap before the first guests arrive, and they have time to get some food in him and get him used to the idea that the house will be full of people.
Jody seems to notice that, the way she looks at Jack before glancing at Dean. She quickly claps her hands together, shooting a smile to the small boy.
How many people are joining them if Bobby doesn’t have a spare mattress for the two of them anyway? While Dean is horrified about sleeping next to Cas, he is glad he didn’t go through with his plan to sleep on the couch, because Cas is right: his back would kill him.
Castiel smiles so softly at him and leans in to give another kiss to his husband. “It’s fine”, he speaks against his lips, “I brought beer.”
The question gets another dry huff of laughter out of Cas, he shakes his head. “You don’t have to listen to me whining.”
Cas hears Jack’s footsteps all the way from the living room, because the kid’s still wearing his shoes that Cas had left on his feet in the fear of waking him up.
Cas looks innocently at the younger Winchester, tilting his head, “Well, your brother here thought it would be a good idea to pretend to be my husband”, he reminds Sam.
A moment later, Cas shivers against him, and Dean automatically reaches to grab a blanket draped over the armrest of the couch, and throws it over them. It’s not even a big deal if you think about the fact that the three of them basically lived on that couch, under the blankets all those days when Jack was sick.
Cas puts on the pair of shorts he usually sleeps in, grabbing a t-shirt to put on as well. He hears Dean shift to the other end of the bed and he’s trying to prolong this moment before he has to look behind himself to see if Dean woke up or not.
“I’ve had my fair share of that with you”, Bobby says, nodding at Dean, “I ain’t getting involved in this.”
“Yeah, just dropped Jack to his room”, Dean says, pointing a thumb somewhere behind him, “I thought you were staying out all night.”
“That’s when I first thought about it”, Dean elaborates, scratching the back of his neck, “That maybe— maybe I have some feelings for you.”
“There is no relationship, because I never met him”, Cas continues with a neutral tone, “I have no idea what kind of man he was, I didn’t know him.”
Which is why Cas is a little disappointed, when he sees Dean alone in the living room when he goes inside.
“It’s okay”, Jack says easily with his almost-four-year-old’s mindset when he crosses the room, “It was an accident.”
Cas grabs two cups from the shelf and pours hot water on them, handing one to Mick with some tea from the shelf too. He asks about the meeting that brought Mick to that part of the city, and they fall into a nice conversation over the cups of tea.
