Tony settled in between Steve and Rhodey talking a mile a minute at both of them getting happily excited that both groups are interacting well with one another. Tony seemed to have more bounce in his step, more curl to his smile and a larger fire burning behind those eyes. It made Steve a little sad that Tony was not quite there yet to feel comfortable enough to let himself fully be happy like this. Though Steve conceded that it was a dumb way to think and selfish as well. There was no way he or the Avengers could compete with the harpies who traveled all over to find him. It actually made Steve a little glad that Tony had other people to depend on...it will make it easier for Steve to say goodbye knowing Tony is happy and with family.
“I can ask you the same thing,” One of the harpies asked stepping in front of all the other harpies including Tony.
Tony gave him a small smile in return and Steve felt his whole world focus shift in that moment. He stared happily at Tony who looked away towards the fire in an attempt to hide his blush. Steve had never been more happier than in that moment.
Tony warned himself. He needed to know what he had gotten himself into. If this was a ploy by some evil asshat, he needed to get as much info as he could. “Didn’t mean to wake you up. I guess I had a little rough sleep last night.” He wasn’t
“Like Hell you can’t,” it was Bucky’s turn to look insulted as he stood up next to Steve coming close to Tony without crowding his space. Bucky looked ready to give a whole entire speech but Steve just pulled Bucky back and forced him to take a few breaths first.
He felt so alone. Emptiness settled in and the world of people was gone. Steve left the bar leaving Bucky and the annoying girl behind. Outside the air was cold and crisp. The streetlights were dim making it hard to see. Still it was refreshing to be alone in the semi darkness. Steve walked away from the door and down the street when he heard a few footsteps behind him. Walking a little faster Steve turned into the first alley he found. The footsteps stopped and there was silence behind him. He turned.
They all partnered up and although Steve usually went for Bucky or Sam, Steve had found himself naturally pairing up with Tony. They were quite in sync and worked quite well with each other. The rest kind of defaulted to them to take down each guard since Steve used his shield to stun and Tony used his gauntlet for the knockout hit. It was almost fun if they didn't have such a serious goal in mind.
They made it to the outskirts of Brook by nightfall. The city had grown since the last time the Avengers have been back. They often dreaded heading into town the direct route for the flocks of people who come out to great them but it was not always avoidable. This time was no different as people were lining up around them with large smiles on their faces greeting them back home. Steve had grown up in Brook and has tried his hardest to help the people of this city the best he could. It was how he was able to get to where he was due to his friends who are now his teammates and the people of this city who always helped each other. Each of his teammates were his family and deserved to be treated like heroes even if Steve felt he was a little unworthy. He had failed at protecting Peggy and that still hurt him to think about her.
“Anthony Edward Stark!” Pepper glared at Tony making both Tony and Steve shiver in fear at her gaze, “you are a better person than almost everyone else I have ever met! And it is they that don't deserve you. We love and care about you and that is all that should ever matter to you.”
Now he will get to see him. After five hundred years he will get to look into those eyes and hear his voice. Steve knew that the droids would never live up to the real thing but it will still very much be
So, there sat Tony bare chested, hunched in the corner, waiting for his father to finish his rant. Once Howard took a breath from his long monologue, he raised his belt.
Pepper took Tony's hands in hers once Rhodey stepped away. She had smiled at him telling him that they were doing this for their people. Pepper reminded him that it was worth the risk. She kissed each cheek and spoke, "will that be all Mr.Stark?"
“We grew close to friend Tony,” Thor spoke to Steve as they began to move, “I would be deeply saddened and angered if any harm would befall our new shield brother.”
It was then that really got them moving up their schedule for what to do but first, they needed to find out more about that explosion and why it happened. Steve was not going to risk anyone else until he had a clear picture.
“I...would actually love that,” Tony confessed giving Steve his first genuine shy smile that he had often seen adorn Tony’s face when they had been together.
“Oh for him? Thirty dolls,” the merchant replied holding out his hands to seal the deal. That was more than half the coin he had on him but he was determined to save the harpy.
If he were not the prince Tony would have called him out on his rudeness but instead decided to answer the question, “If you, suffer your people to be ill-educated and their manners corrupted from infancy and then punish them for those crimes to which their 1st education disposed to them. What else is to be concluded, sire, but that you first make thieves and then punish them.”
Rolling his eyes, Steve got up stood in front of the mirror and scowled at the sight he saw. He was too small, too bony, too sickly. No one would ever want him. He was tempted to punch the darn thing but he already broke too many mirrors. Steve does not want his mother to waste more money on a new one.
"Yeah, Tony. I - I'm okay." By sheer force of will, he manages to get the words out. He doesn't actually feel all that okay, but Tony’s tight grip on his hand and look of fear has Steve rushing to calm him anyway he can. Tony slumps then, breathing out all at once. He looks at Steve and the glisten to Tony’s eyes attract all of his attention, everything else fading away. Tony’s still holding his hand, but the grip has loosened a bit, with a softer touch.
He thinks of Tony dying from this, and can’t move. Stands there watching, holding his own breath as he waits for the sound or sight of Tony’s.
‘But you don’t anymore.’ It’s so bland and certain that Steve wants to scream. He wants to know that Tony feels the pain of this as much as he does. But Tony doesn’t give it to him.
It’s been two weeks and Steve’s dreams are vivid. His voice issuing execution orders, hailing hydra. Watching the obliteration of Las Vagas. Feeling Tony’s body splayed beneath his.
“I could get you out of here,” he says. She could walk away today with a million dollars in her pockets. Never again suck a dick she doesn’t want to. “I could save you.”
As he drifts to sleep the last thing he hears is, ‘I’m sorry it had to be this way, Tony, next time will be better. I promise.’
He runs his fingers across the dents and scratches. Weather worn and well aged, the helmet isn’t what it used to be.
It was a lot smoother now even as more armed harpies charged at them. Steve felt a few blows and he could feel a bit of the pain as he moved but it did not slow him down from protecting each fighting member of the Avengers as well as taking down his own attackers.
We want to say congrats to all who have scored themselves a date tonight but to those who haven’t worry not for we have a special event just for you!
...He should have parted ways with Tony back in the forest…no that is wrong because he was actually glad to have Tony here. The harpy needed a place to go and heal up and what better than with a group of warriors and a doctor? It was better for now that Tony stay. It did not matter if Tony liked the rest more than him. Tony deserved so much more than what he got and Steve will make sure he gets a full recovery.
He is crying. Eyes clenched shut but the tears break free anyway, like they did the last time he spoke so honestly to Steve. To Steve's body.
“A dance?” she asks. He nods, his stomach feeling tight with dread. The music pounds and her body bleeds into the rhythm like the familiarity of this place bleeds into him.
He stops to breathe, to release the tension that's been growing tighter and heavier in his chest. He's bleeding more sluggishly now and the pain is distant and soft edged.
He smiles a little. Steve is too busy to notice. He lets his soft focus on the worlds drift away. He could sleep maybe. He wonder is Steve would stop. If he fell asleep? If he screamed and cried? If he died? He’d keep going even then, maybe, because Tony’s not so different from a corpse these days and Steve doesn’t seem to care.
The air is cold, the whiskey warm. He left his shoes in the stripper’s room. Sitting on the sidewalk, people pass him by and he has never felt so invisible.
Steve wants to throw the phone across the room and walk away. Let Tony die like he was meant to. Tony chose this. Tony doesn’t give a fuck who he hurts and Steve shouldn’t either.
He turns the shower off and stands dripping on the cold tile floor, listening to the sound of his neighbours fucking on the other side of the plasterboard walls. His life has changed, maybe, but people haven’t.
He feels the world shattering inside of him. He tries to blink it away like a vision he can dispel, but it stays crystal every time he opens his eyes.
Steve rolls over, wedged up next to him on the cramped bed. Tony feels a little claustrophobic, even with the cuffs off. This is the start of something and Tony isn’t sure what. He’s been orbiting around the edges of Steve’s affection for years and this time he can’t resist the pull. He wants to run away and he wants to never leave Steve’s side again.
He turns his back on it. Pulls the box out from under his bed, rifles through the dusty porn magazines and crumpled newspaper he hid it amongst, rests the helmet Tony gave him on his lap and wonders what he’s doing here.
Flashes of the fight with Carol. He lost, he supposes. Lost but survived, because he always seems to hang around to witness his failures.
"Pepper, I'm sorry, but I know what Tony's going through better than you do." Ms. Potts is silent then, the argument apparently won.
He buries his face in the grass, feels the blades itch his nose, smells the organic must of nature. The earth shifts beneath him, moving constantly as if trying to sooth a restless infant.
He wakes dizzy and breathless. His body feels heavy and his eyes itchy and sticky with sleep. Smell of disinfectant, feeling of an IV hooked up to his hand and restraints around his wrists.
“As many as you want.” Her flippant attitude is meant to encourage him in to fantasies. He obliges. He imagines day after day, man after man, taking it and taking it again.
'God. Fuck. Steve.' Tony screams. All his despair, all his physical pain, all the wretched melting pot of every emotional response he has suppressed over the last two years. And when he stops, Steve is there calling his name over and over, because he thinks he's listening to his old friend kill himself. Maybe he's not, but he is listening to his old friend die.
He'd thought he would die back then, before Rhodey swept in to save him. He’s not going to die this time and there’s no Rhodey to rescue him. He keeps walking towards the tower, but maybe it would be better if he walked into traffic.
There’s a motel across from the diner and Tony heads there now, walking away like he’s on autopilot.
'Why are you telling me this now, Tony, what the hell is going on?' Tony used to think he was good at reading Steve, but perhaps he never was, perhaps he saw what Steve was willing to show him, because he's getting nothing now.
Tony hops on the back of the bike and wraps his arms around Steve’s waist with a stiff defiance, like the mere touch proves they can still be friends.
Steve will wake to the news that Tony is a cheat and a woman beater. He wonders what Steve’s face will look like. Disgust and  disappointment, maybe - too kind for hatred, too good not to condemn. If he could just see Steve’s smile one more time...
He slips them on and Bucky leads him to the room down the hall. The one that has Happy and Pepper standing outside the door whispering among themselves before they stop when they see Steve.
Tony tugs lightly on the bonds, a gentle reminder that he can’t participate in this properly, but Steve is in his own world. He touches Tony, watches Tony, feels Tony, but Tony feels like Steve never sees him at all. Like he wants so much he’s going to take it no matter what, and Tony wants to ask him to stop just to see if he will. But of course he would; he’s Captain America.
Feels Tony’s pulse and lets some of the tension drain away. Touches Tony, remembers his fantasies from earlier tonight and feels wrong for it. Tony is still and quiet and none of that carefree hedonist remains in this shell of a man.
“How many men have fucked you today?” He asks and wonders if he is looking to connect. With her? With the man he once was who visited places like this for fun?
It's a wonder they were ever friends, teammates, whatever they were. If Tony wasn't selfish and hollow and needy, he would let Steve have his righteous anger, let Steve live and thrive and remember Tony as a man who failed him, a man who lied and destroyed their friendship and never showed remorse. Never gave them the chance to be anything more.
The Stones physically drained Tony just as they did Steve. But Tony had no Super Soldier serum to give up.
Every emotion has been stamped out of him, like a whirlwind of wild horses have trampled through his brain, leaving behind splattered mud and chaos. There is an after-storm calm in him, and he feels like he could rest his head in the pillowy grass and sleep the rest of eternity away.
They stay, but say little to each other until the owner conspicuously clears the table of their unfinished food and comments on the lateness of the hour.
From what he remembers, Tony looked pretty bad but at least seemed to be faring better than Steve. It seems Steve- being the more advanced individual - braced most of the strain from using the gauntlet. That was good. He would take anything that allowed for Tony to finally bear less of the burden. Together, he reminded himself.
He’d gripped Tony’s wrist, encased in the Gauntlet, and he’s not even sure if he’d said anything, but for a brief second he’d met Tony’s gaze, and he thinks they’d both known that if they were going to go out, they’d do it together. After all the mistakes he’d made, all the times he hadn't been there for Tony, it was the least he could do.
“I’m horny. Boring dinners always make me horny.” Its the truth. They have their best sex when Tony gets homes from a particularly dull meeting.
Steve sighs. ‘We don’t need the IV. It’s just a shot, Tony, to make sure I don’t lose you again.’ Steve prepares the needle as he speaks, fills it, taps it, then tucks the bottle in the bedside drawer.
Steve slings Tony’s arm across his shoulder, carries him out on jelly legs before Tony can protest further. If he’s honest with himself, Tony wants to walk away from the violence too, it’s not an image he wants in his head when he thinks of Steve.
'You don't get to call me out of the blue at two am and hang up without an explanation,' Steve says.
Above the humming evidence of Tony’s life, Steve hears the poorly hushed voices of Colonel Rhodes and Ms. Potts outside. He considers all the harsh words his mother once said about eavesdropping, but there’s an urgency in their tones which tempts him in.
“A lot of men do.” She’s dancing still, like her body isn’t part of her, like a lioness pacing her cage waiting for a meal to come.
Tony inhales shakily and his face contorts. He blinks rapidly, his lashes long and dark in his paper-pale face, and Steve catches the sheen of tears in his eyes. But that doesn’t last long; Tony’s expression smooths out and he quickly gets himself back under control. “You know, I waited…” Tony starts, then stops, his voice a hoarse, choked-off thing. His gaze flicks away from Steve, and Steve feels the loss of it acutely. Chills wash over him.
Steve smiles at him, and Tony thinks, perhaps he knew him better than he thought. Drawn to him, burned by his flame because he saw something in his soul hidden deep, a darkness that has never been there in the real Steve, an imperfection that finally made him attainable. Deep down there’s something rotten in them both.
‘I know. What happened happened. I don’t expect you to change it. I want my friend back. I don’t want to let that hydra asshole take more from me than he’s taken already.’
'I wanted to say sorry so fucking bad, but I could never manage it. Not to your face. Not to a you who could tell me where to shove those good fucking intentions.'
"Come on," Rhodes' voice is softer now, "let's get coffee, give Cap a little time with him before we break the news."
The soldier doesn’t put up much of a struggle, just lies on the floor and tries to swat Tony away as Tony tries to get him pinned. ‘A little help here, Cap?’ It’s not like Steve to react to a surprise attack with inaction, but Tony can’t blame him.
‘I don’t know,’ Steve says. ‘When I look at you now, I just see what he did to you. I’m so sorry, Tony. I’m so, so fucking sorry.’
They eye each other in expectant silence, monitors and machines beeping around them, and the harsh scent of disinfectant sharp in their nostrils.
'Space,' Tony says and realises he has no intention of elaborating, because as much as he likes the fantasy of Steve here with him, comforting him, easing him into his last sorry moments, it's a fantasy.
He lingers, wants to touch Steve as Steve touched him, but he’s tired and spent and his body is not used to moving anymore. His sluggish fingers drag down Steve’s chest, but his arm is heavy and he can’t hold it up. ‘There’ll be other days, Tony,’ Steve tells him. ‘Rest. I’ll stay with you.’
Tony's hand twitches in Steve's. He glances quickly and notices Tony's face contouring and trying to form words.
It takes every bit of self-control Steve possesses to restrain himself from folding Tony into his arms and holding on tight. Instead, he presses a kiss to the back of Tony’s hand before gently laying it on the hospital bed. “Thank you,” Steve says softly. Even then, he can’t bear to let Tony’s hand go. His thumb strokes slowly over the back of it as Steve concentrates on breathing.
Since Steve met him, Tony has buzzed with a constant movement like some kind of perpetual motion machine. Except for the briefest twitch of fingers and the steady rise and fall of his breath, Tony hasn't moved since he woke up.
Steve yawns and stretches and smiles at him. He looks so different in the post sleep haze, like the stresses of being a soldier have been washed away. ‘Good morning, Tony.’
He feels Tony’s arm pull out of his grasp, though he tries to hold on, hears Tony mumble something soothing when he chokes out a distressed noise. Then Tony’s hand is in his, he can feel the callouses and scars, the recent burn damage from the Gauntlet. It matches his own.
He chokes back the foul taste that lingers on his tongue. One whiskey wasn’t quite enough to wash it away.
"I'm glad that you're okay. I was worried that you wouldn't make it and that I wouldn't have the chance to tell you how I feel. Tony. All we've been through. All these years that we spent either fighting or arguing were the worst and yet, the ones that we spent side by side on the battlefield were even better. I saw you in a different light. Saw the true man that you became and my feelings for you---"
He didn't mean to, not consciously at least. It's like a muscle spasm, his brain thinks it and it is so.
He awakes somewhere cold, abrasive bed sheets beneath him. It’s not the same bed, maybe not the same room. He’s blindfolded and gagged and the restraints around his wrist and ankles chafe. He struggles against the bonds to little effect.
'Because I'm a mess. Goddammit. We're a mess. I fucking love you, Tony, and that's why I can hate you so much. I hated what you did to us, I hated that you made us fight on opposite sides. I hated that I couldn't stand with you. I hated that I couldn't love you and I hated that I loved you anyway. '
And the restraints don’t seem so important anymore. There’s a twinge of something unreal in it all, like Tony is going to wake up and find it was all another dream. He wants to ask Steve why he never said anything before. Why they wasted all these years. But Tony never said anything either. They both played their part in this charade of friendship.
'What the hell have you done?' There is a mix of panic and anger in Steve's voice. Of course, of course Steve makes an assumption. It's funny almost, the sad sort of funny where no one's laughing but they wish they could be. Steve at once sounds angry and scared, because Tony has a history of fucking him over. Once Steve might have met an unprompted apology with
There's no mercy in dying, no freedom from his demons that make his last moments feel worth it. He is a drunk and even now, he wants a drink.
Now though, Steve will take what’s his and in his mind, Tony is his. It’s okay though, it’s just flesh. It’s just blood and sex and it doesn’t mean a thing, because it isn’t Steve and in the morning he won’t be Tony.
The relief that Steve knows they both must feel is palpable in the air between them. Tony’s alive. He wasn’t too late this time, the thought making him almost dizzy with joy. Only he realizes a beat too late that he actually is dizzy, feeling his head lolling back to the side.
Steve, in all his cowardice, doesn’t question it, or ask him to back off. He starts the bike, takes the fastest rout to the highway and uses his shield like an illicit beacon of authority to break the speed limit without question. He can’t hear Tony, can’t feel Tony, just the wind and the road and the burning of bile in his throat.
Steve leans over and kisses him, the smell of Tony’s come still on his breath. ‘You’d like that’s huh?’ Steve whispers against his lips. Steve is fondling Tony’s balls, but his hand moves now, up to the restraints. He pulls them loose, snaps the leather effortlessly. It’s teasing almost, a reminder of how little power Tony has in comparison.
“Buck,” is all that he manages to croak out, his throat feeling too dry to form proper words. Steve watches as his action causes a determined look that he hasn't seen on his old friend's face since what felt like a lifetime ago. Irritation starts to well up at the base of his stomach and he has to stop himself from letting that same old frustration and inadequacy build up - things are different now, he’s different. He's come too far to revert back to old worries and woes.
Tony waits all week for it to break. He has JARVIS monitor upcoming headlines and web activity, but there’s nothing. Either the stripper was lying about going to the press or no one would take the story. After all, Tony Stark is a changed man.
He imagines women fall at Tony’s feet. Men too, maybe. He feels guilty for thinking it, for the picture it brings to his brain, sitting there stagnating something awful in the pit of his stomach.  He imagines Tony on his knees and starts to get hard. Closer to the bathroom wall, step by traitorous step to listen to the moans of man and woman, and remind him of how it should be.
'Just tell me what you're thinking.' He still likes the sound of Steve's voice. Even in anger or sadness, it sings to him, reminds him that Steve is alive once more. If he can't die at peace he'd like to die remembering that.
‘I missed you, too.’ He knows what this feels like from the other side. So many times he’s crumbled without Steve in his life.
‘Please, Steve, please. Let me touch you.’ Tony thinks he would do anything Steve asks of him right now. But that is all Steve wants of him.
He tries to call through the open door for help. Jarvis. But the mansion is too big and too empty and they are alone here in Tony’s gilded crypt. He fumbles for his phone, shaking fingers jabbing at the buttons.
Tony is caught between the urge to hang up and the desperate, tightly held composure that is crumbling away at the sound of Steve's voice. He thinks if he opens his mouth he will not stop talking. There is so much he wants to say and he can't because his own body is betraying him, holding him in time like an ancient castle, too late to change, too broken to rebuild. He would give anything right now just to hear Steve say he is forgiven.
Tony nods. Wordless, breathless. Hazy dreams long passed drifting back to him, closer to reality now. A life he always wanted and never got. A life he never dreamed he’d get but has found somehow.
‘Tony, it’s me. It’s Steve,’ he adds, because he doesn’t want to be Captain America tonight. ‘Jarvis told me you’re in there.’
His hand, where it still clings to the Infinity Gauntlet, gloves torn and knuckles bloody, looks burnt from the energy that had coursed through him moments before.
He gets a drink and takes a seat, shotguns the double whiskey like it’s lemonade and lathers himself with the stupor of distraction.
‘Shhh. Everything will be fine soon.’ Steve’s voice sounds echoic, like they’re in a cave or a cell and Steve is watching from above. Footsteps approach.
If ever there was a time to make good on that promise and prove they weren’t empty words from a liar’s mouth, it’s now, when Tony’s trapped in a hospital bed, unable to move, because he saved the world.
But for Tony’s sake, he keeps his voice calm and level. “Don’t be sorry. I mean it—I don’t want you to say anything except that we’ll do this, whatever comes next, together. You’re not alone. Okay?”
It was the delusion he'd needed to stay alive. Let it crumble now, let Steve shatter it apart and show him just how stupid he was.
They don’t stop until the fuel tank is running on empty. Steve isn’t even sure where they are, he’s been following his instincts for a few hundred miles, not the road signs. They pull up at a gas station attached to a diner so old fashioned it looks like it hasn’t been renovated since Steve’s youth.
Tony snorts in disbelief. “Yeah, or maybe I should just be realistic. I didn’t expect to survive, and now— And now—”
There have always been so many things holding them back, but Tony no longer cares about any of that, because this is Steve, because this feels so natural, it feels like this is what his life was always meant to be.
Something beeps. A machine lights up. He begins to feel heavy. He was thinking about something important. Maybe. He forgets what. It doesn’t seem to matter anymore.
‘Need you? Fuck your arrogance. I didn’t invite you. You’ve been trailing me around like a lost puppy. What do you even want from me? There’s nothing I can say to change what happened.’
Exhale foggy breath, one foot forward, and the next. He thinks of the sands he once walked; the biting wind of a New York winter is not so different from the dry desert air. Intolerable and destructive.
‘Jesus. Fuck.’ Tony has no better words. He gets up, steps closer to the windows, examining the sight before him like if he looks close enough he’ll spot some sign of life. ‘What happened?’
‘A tragic loss of life, but lessons have been learned. It sounds callous to reduce it to this, but the world is a better place for it.’
The bedroom is quiet. The thoughts of sex shut away with the bathroom door. He sees the bloody uniform and bedsheets strewn across the floor and wonders if this is better.
But Steve never has a chance to answer. A klaxon goes off, and the door swings open and a single Hydra soldier steps inside.
Tony doesn’t feel tired anymore, but Steve doesn’t ask him again. ‘Wait,’ Tony says as Steve gets up to leave, ‘we should talk.’ But Steve has already left Tony alone with his thoughts in the darkness.
Tony want to say it’s fine, but there’s a sting of loneliness, of betrayal, the taunt of their last moment together lingering and festering in his brain and feeling more and more like a delusion with every passing second.
Steve is breathless, sweat slick shoulders shining in the iridescent lights. He lays on top of Tony as Tony tugs at the bonds around his wrists, reaching, so close to touching Steve. He trusts him, doesn’t feel the same background buzz of fear he’d feel with anyone else.
Tony hasn't been safe in a long time, he's always been balanced on a cliff edge and waiting to be pushed, to fall, to pretend it was inevitable.
The TV plays quietly in the background. Tony grabs the remote and switches it off and that’s enough to stir Steve from his sleep.
Privacy is the last thing in the world he wants. He'd like the entire world to see him and judge him and spit on his grave. Let him lay down and rot and never once be mourned.
Steve removes the blindfold sometimes, claims he likes to see Tony’s eyes, gets all poetic about the colour of the sky. Today is one of those days. Steve sits at his bedside, pulls a book from his satchel. Its dust cover is neat and shiny, and Tony can hear the pages crinkle as Steve opens it. Hydra: A History Retold is printed in bold across the cover.
‘I guess I fucked up following you out here.’ Tony reaches for the bike and uprights it. ‘Go find yourself, Cap. I’ll be around if you ever decide we can still be...’ he hesitates, and a barrage of emotions run across his face like he’s been plunged into a pool of them, ‘friends or something.’
Steve pulls his finger back, looks at the blood on it, his face remains neutral. Tony’s seen his blood on Steve’s hands before. It’s different, but not so different. It’s right he thinks, that Steve should hurt him here too; hurt his body like he’s hurting his heart.
Steve pulls back from the kiss and smiles a butcher’s smile. There’s blood in his teeth, and Tony wonders why he didn’t taste of it. He feels the wetness dripping down his own lip.
He thinks of those early days, how quickly Steve adapted and made the modern world his own. It can’t have been so long, Tony’s looks at his hands but his skin is still young. He thinks of the past few years and the breakneck speed their lives now run at. It could have been a week and he might’ve missed just as much.
‘Then you’d better pray he turns out brighter than you.’ Steve pulls out a pistol and shoots the guy between the eyes. Blood flies as he falls and splashes of it land on Tony’s face and gown, painting him with a violence unlike any he’s seen from Steve before.
Tony stands and strips his shirt off. With the TV off the only light in the room comes form the hall light peeking in beneath the door. It’s enough to get by; not enough to see bruises.
He imagines another life when he has forgotten all this - nights where Steve calls him in to witness the suffering of traitors, to paint a smile on his face and take Steve’s hand willingly and act like this is a kindness, a joy to be shared, like an evening at the opera. To hear screams reverberating through the room with the faint unspoken threat that, ‘this could be you, if you step out of line.’
The world melts away as the ground shifts once more. Taking him deeper, he thinks at first, until it bulges and burps and pushes him away with a physical force that feels almost human. The pillowy grass becomes brittle and harsh, no longer a comfort. He finds himself on his feet, shaking slightly but undamaged, whole. Alive.
'Are you...' Steve stops, pauses, starts over. 'Don't do anything stupid, Tony, please.' Tony recognises fear in the record pin stagger of Steve's voice. Tony has done a million stupid things in his life, dying will be far from the stupidest. But Steve thinks he has a choice, that he is standing on that cliff edge now and waiting to jump. Steve always sees choices where there are none. No compromises, you just have to try harder and a solution will come.
‘More than I trust myself.’ He’s shook by his own words. If Steve suggested they turn away now, he would. Let them bury whatever secret’s he’s keeping behind that locked door, go to bed, fuck until the memory is trivial, and only bring it up as a joke ten years down the line when it has become as unimportant to what their lives will be, as that mix up with that shapeshifter is to what their lives are now.
‘Anything,’ Tony says, and means it more than he should. Steve smiles, kisses him again, releases his hand and let’s Tony touch him.
Maybe if this were different, they’d be lying together, home, comfortable. It’s quick and desperate, and Tony hears between Steve’s ragged breathing the low sound of his voice. ‘You’re alive,’ he says, ‘you’re mine and you’re alive and you trust me and everything will be alright this time.’ And the words aren’t really meant for him, but Tony understands and won’t deny him, because he’s dreamed of this and now he knows, Steve has too.
‘Can you smell it, Tony?’ Steve asks and Tony is baffled for a moment. There’s a bowl in Steve’s hands, steam wafting from hot soup. He thinks of their early days in the mansion, drinking Steve’s homemade soup through a straw during Avengers lunch breaks, because Steve’s home cooking was too good to pass up. ‘Come on Tony, what do you smell?’
The future is bright and ugly and remote, and Tony gave him this and Steve is choosing his own loneliness and pride. He wants to be the kind of man he once was, when he wore this helmet. When he remembered how to be happy, instead of angry and sad and scared.
‘You’ve been sleeping a long time.’ Steve averts his eyes for a moment. ‘You know, Tony, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking while you were out.’
Steve begins to pace. The urge to hop back on the bike and drive away from Tony as far as he can is almost overpowering, but he can’t walk away. Tony doesn’t get it. The gravity of what was done in Steve’s name. The things the world knows and this horrible secret between Tony and he.
Tony can hear his heart beating, it’s louder than it ought to be, thrumming in his ears like a heavy drum beat in the otherwise silence. Maybe it’s just a moment, but it stretches out thin and long like taffy being pulled and it doesn’t break until Steve speaks again.
'I guess the truth is, I've always tried to do what I thought was right, but when you died I realised how fucking stupid I'd been. I realised none of it was worth losing you for. And now I'm stuck out here and this fucking planet is killing me and I just need to tell you - I love you, Steve. I fucking love you.'
Steve smiles a hunter’s smile and Tony wonders for a moment if he is the pray, but it’s there and gone in a moment and perhaps he imagined it, perhaps his brain won’t let him have happy moments untainted.
“Let’s get that room,” he tells the woman when the whisky has him far enough from sober that his body feels in his control again.
Steve shakes him and Tony’s eyes flutter open. ‘Too much coke,’ he slurs when he says it, but there’s a smile in his voice like he thinks this is funny.  His eyes drift closed again.
‘There’s a lot of context you need to understand. You see, this was a long time coming, but we were all too blinded by the idea that we were the good guys, the heroes.’
“They took him south-west of here just a few miles off. If we move fast and quick we should make it to them in time before...before whatever they might do to Tony hopefully,” Steve responded. The rest nodded in unison and finished getting ready. Bucky soon joined too and gave Steve a worried but supportive look as he tied his hair back.
After Jarvis finished cleaning him up Tony lay face forward onto his bed. Slowly Jarvis covered his bottom half with a blanket and handed Tony his own self-made Captain America plushy. He loved cuddling and the Captain was the perfect cuddling partner. He made him to his exact liking, of course.
Tony stared at him before nodding in understanding. This was the first sign of communication that Steve got from Tony and he was so happy. At least now he got Tony to communicate with him in some form. He was glad with having just a nod or a shake for now. It was great progress from before.
“This is the first time someone has given me something for me,” Tony spoke softly, “always given things so that other people could get what they wanted. It’s...it’s...this is amazing.”
“How annoying,” Clint muttered just loud enough for Steve’s sensitive ears to catch. With that thankfully over with, Steve wondered where the rest were. Probably hunting for some food for tonight or doing some pet projects in their tents. Steve hoped the rest would like Tony. It was crucial for them to like him. He was not going to make them put up with an unwelcome guest but Steve was determined to help the harpy so if he had to go sadly Steve would too. Tony was his responsibility now.
“Next time once you demonstrate how those gloves work you can come along,” Steve whispered into Tony’s ear. Tony just nodded without turning to him but Steve could see the little smirk playing on his face.
Steve enjoyed the rest of his run with Sam until the sun moved higher in the sky and the market has opened for business. He bid Sam a quick goodbye before heading towards the market plaza to get Tony’s gift. As he approached the already growing crowd of the marketplace, Steve lifted up the hoodie of his cloak to stay hidden from the rest of the townsfolk. He did not like sneaking around his hometown but he did not want to be sidetracked by all the people wanting to talk to him.
The smell of the place was atrocious and the amount of noise amplified once he was inside, Steve knew instantly that they use silencing spells with those flaps to make sure that they don’t disturb potential buyers. Still what Steve saw was sickening, creatures stuck in cages, some too small, and many looked to be beaten and harvested for ingredients. If he could he would save them all but he steeled himself and focused on the small sobbing noise that seemed to come from the back of the caged labyrinth. This was wrong but in Nework it was legal to sell captured creatures on the street like garbage and no matter how hard Steve worked to help them it still amounted to very little change for their rights.
It was bright. That was the first thing Steve felt when he woke up. It was bright and his chest felt heavy. He opens his eyes and the first thing he sees is red and gold. It takes him a moment to realize it’s Tony’s wings spread a bit over his head. He follows the wings with his eyes and looks down to see Tony sleeping balled up on his chest holding onto his left arm pretty tightly. It was cute but also a very confusing sight to see. Tony should be out there with his people and be helping them come to terms with what happened not in here with him. Tony should be with his family even if Steve desperately wanted to be a part of that family.
It took a few seconds but Steve heard a soft tapping against metal inside the tent and Steve knew it was Tony responding to Steve. It made him happy to hear the harpy actually giving Steve a more positive response. He turned and sat with the rest of the team who sat around the fire a few feet away humming old tunes that they used to sing in the village where they grew up.
Steve rushed back to camp hoping that he made it in time to save Tony's wings. He had not intended to take as long as he did but he encountered some issues on the road that took some time away from him getting back.
“I never had enough money to buy anything like that for Tony growing up,” Rhodey said, “and when I finally got the money…well…anyway, what I am trying to say is thank you for getting this dumbass some tools to work with. You will soon learn though that once he starts to play it's almost impossible to pull him away,” Rhodey replied giving Tony a playful shoulder shove. Tony pretended to look hurt but the happiness in his eyes gave him away.
“Thank you,” Tony said holding back the sob that threatened to pour out. Papa Rhodes squeezed Tony’s arm one more time before letting go and nodded for Tony to continue to show the way.
They walked in silence each in their own thoughts and neither wanting to break the silence in fear of somehow ruining this chance with each other. Steve was not expecting to ever really run into Tony again after that day he walked away from him eight years ago. He had kept tabs on him through what he could get through the media and gossip but he never dared dream that Tony would give him the time of day now that he was the CEO of his own company. Even after all this time, it felt natural to walk beside him. Steve even felt the itch to grab Tony’s hand and intertwine it with his own. He refrained though. It wasn’t his place...
There is description of abuse in this chapter. Sorry I had to put this in there. I have added the tags. Again so sorry! Please read, comment and kudos. I love hearing what people have to say.
“I hate this,” Clint grumbles as he walks away angrily. Bucky followed after him leaving Steve and Thor behind to get the artifact out of the forest and back to the client. Steve looked towards Thor who looked like he wanted to follow where Clint disappeared towards but stayed put. It was not good to separate but Clint sometimes does things without thinking things through. It was alright though because Bucky had gone after him so he wasn't really alone.
“Deal,” Steve answered knowing full well that he was never going to give the harpy back to this man. Ever.
The bridge to the castle was empty with guards standing at attention at each opening. Tony's nerves were on fire and seemed to blaze against his skin with every step. Though he sure would not let it show as he held his head high and walked with purpose and determination. He passed the first set of guards without incident but the second set seemed to study him a second longer. Tony locked his gaze with one of the guards who just smiled cheekily at him. Tony rolled his eyes playfully before turning around dramatically and heading towards the slave masters. They usually passed the palace to make sure that none of the slaves were wanted by the king .
“Harpies,” Steve gave a short reply before moving towards the closest tree and climbing up to attempt to locate the group of flying harpies who had taken Tony. It was a slim chance but Steve took it anyway climbing over the trees and seeing the horizon from above. Steve was thankful that the trees in this forest were abnormally tall and reached almost unnatural heights.
“Aih,” Thor stood in holding Mjolnir tightly in his grasp. It seemed that no matter what Steve would have to say something and that the team was going to come along even if he did not want them to. It was faster with him alone.
Steve frowned angrily as he stood up wanting nothing more than to punch the man in the face and free the harpy and all the other creatures from his grasp but instead replied, “I might be.”
Steve was starting to feel the heat of the forges against his skin indicating he was really close to the mechanic booths. They were also one of the busiest areas in town since many travelers and townsfolk came to get something fixed or made. He spotted large men wearing protective leather and simple clothing working hard and talking to customers at the same time. These men were the mechanics and smithies of Brook.  They were just as busy as Steve remembered them to be. It was nice to see that some things never changed.
“There is another reason we went looking for you,” Pepper started as she came into view from behind a set of trees to their right. They all turned to look at her as she eloquently sat across from them. Steve felt a presence of easy elegance about her that made a person want to listen. “Stane is dismantling our way of life and structure so he could rule indefinitely without consequence or resistance. His new regime is cruel and he is using your tarnished image to get it done. I have put myself in a good position with him and he trusts me to a point but even that is fickle. I was able to learn that he plans on furthering war and tension between our people and others so he can profit off of weaponry and combative equipment. There are a few tribes that do not believe the story of the runaway prince and will not bow down to anyone but the rightful king of our people. Which is why it is important that you come back…you know how much I dislike putting yourself in harm's way and it is hypocritical that I ask this of you but please. For the sake of our kind, will you help us?”
“You look kind of like him but I am guessin’ you look more like yer ma,” Rogers suddenly spoke as Tony rushed to leave stopping Tony in his tracks.
Steve was now alone in with his thoughts. They weighed heavily on him. The idea of having to cut Tony’s wings off horrified and saddened him beyond measure. He never wanted to put Tony through that kind of pain or horror. He did not deserve it. No one did. The harpy has already been through enough. Though Steve will make sure that Tony gets fully recovered, wings intact.
“We will get our little fire-bird back,” Natasha commented as they made headway and Steve thought he really loved the nickname, fire-bird. It really fit who Tony was to them. Their little fire-bird.
He was glad to do what little he could to repay the only family that ever treated him with love and kindness.
So the butler did what he could. He stayed by Tony’s side. He was careful. He never let Mr. Stark know how much he cared for the boy because if that man got even a whiff of it you were out the door. There had been some occasions when Mr. Stark had tried to fire him but Mrs. Stark always stepped in to alleviate the situation.
Steve just gave Tony one last smile before leaving the harpy to play with his new toys. He exited the apartment and headed to get them food. Things were starting to fall into place and Tony was finally opening up to him.
“Steven Grant Rogers!” a loud familiar voice boomed from the dark depths of the mechanics’ tent. Steve jumped a bit but smiled wide as Dum Dum Dugan stepped out into the fresh air with arms wide open demanding a hug. Steve could not deny the man anything since he did save his life many years back when they had teamed together before Dum Dum decided to retire. The hug was long and strong and Steve loved the contact. He missed the full body hugs Dum Dum gave.
“Live,” Steve blurred out and Tony's eyes snapped to his, “live. See the world that your Pepper wanted you to see. Greet the people who looked up to you for so long. Re-reunite with old friends who have missed you. Even if you decide later to...to terminate at least you got a glimpse of the world before saying your true goodbye.”
It wasn’t until someone broke through them that either of them moved. It was like a small spell had broke and they were moving this time towards Happy. Steve got to the fallen harpy first and checked to him to find any and all major wounds. There was a large gash on his left abdomen but it didn’t seem too deep and Steve was sure if they got him to Bruce they could patch him up well enough. Tony came up next to him and checked for Happy’s pulse frantically shaking quite badly. Tony looked about ready to cry as he looked over Happy and noticed the same gash Steve did. Steve needed to calm Tony down desperately.
“Did you get my very important stuff?” Clint came up to him and draped an arm around his shoulder. Steve just rolled his eyes and moved out of Clint’s hold. He hoped he could avoid Clint’s whines for just a little longer but he figured it was not meant to be.
“I got you something,” Steve suddenly spoke up as they began to move again and he could see Tony stop and freeze in place. Steve really needed to stop talking and ruining the moment for the newly freed harpy. Steve knew Tony was probably going to leave soon so he thought he should at least have something that did not swallow his whole body or make it hard for Tony to move. Tony stayed where he was watching Steve carefully as Steve pulled out a fold-over vest for Tony to wear. He held it out for Tony to take and waited until Tony took it from his hands before he stepped away to let Tony examine it on his own.
“Yeah all those sleepless nights spent running on those treadmills finally did me some good,” Steve replied trying to keep the atmosphere light until they got to the diner. He didn’t want Tony running away just yet.
Watching Bruce and Tony interact made Steve feel more and more bitter. Tony actually smiled at the other man as he checked on him. Bruce seemed to take a liking to Tony as well and just talked about things Steve was not sure he understood but from the way Tony was looking at Bruce he knew the harpy did. It made Steve itch to grab a book on medicine and learn all about the science of healing if it meant getting that smile directed at him. Steve really was quick to get attached and quick to get offended sometimes.
“Ha, man no one gets any sense of privacy with those two nosey assholes,” Sam pointed at Bucky and Clint and Steve wholeheartedly agreed.
Steve felt his cheeks burn a bit like he has been caught outside of his room past curfew. There wasn’t anything really to be embarrassed about but still couldn’t really help it. “Well, it was either this or come naked because I don’t have much else to show off.”
One of the girls wrapped her ugly arms around his naked waist pressing her bare chest against his back. Repulsed, he pushed her away, threw on some pants and ran out after his lover. He knew he waited too long and it would be hard to find him but he swore at that moment he would. He would look forever. He would hold him in his arms until his very last breath. The prince was going to love the man who he knew, even after this, still loves him.
Steve pulled away, having replaced his pout with a happy contented smile. Tony drank up this image in his mind, wanting to memorize every minute detail he could. After one last peck on the lips, Steve dived back down Tony’s body playing with his nipples a bit, giving each a good suck. Tony whined, moving to dig his fingers into Steve’s long hair as he felt Steve’s teeth abuse each nipple. It took a bit for him to be fully satisfied with his work on Tony’s nipples but by the end of it, Tony felt both were utterly sensitive and pleasantly throbbing. If Tony was not already so hard, he would have been even more turned on than he already was.
Once alone in his room, Tony pulled out the one thing he carried with him everywhere even though he had sworn to himself that he didn’t need it, Steve’s flip phone. Tony flipped open the lip of the phone with shaky fingers and dialed the only number in the contacts.
“Drink,” she urged. Steve took a large sip of the drink offered. He let the warmness of the milk comfort him. It emptied too soon for his liking and grudgingly let it fall from his lips and onto the nightstand.
“Who-EEP!” Steve heard a cry coming from within the camp knowing full well who was the source of that cry. Tony was the only one within the tent-circle at the moment as the rest were spread around trying to get last minute chores done before dinner time. Steve rushed forward in desperation wanting to get to Tony quick and save him from the intruders but a moment later as Steve jumped into the inner circle of their tents he saw Tony disappearing into the trees with a group of other Harpies looking disoriented. Steve was too late. Tony was gone. Taken. And Steve had no real clue who took him except they were harpies just like Tony.
She looked at him and gave a small smile before turning around and letting the Colonel take over the introduction. Steve listened to every word. Drank it all in. He was proud to have made it here. Not even the questioning look the Colonel gave him could make him waver. He was going to be a soldier. Fight in the war. Make a difference.
They had agreed on a mutual meeting point near Central Park and what color shirts they were to wear. So here he was standing in his blue shirt waiting for his mystery date to appear. They were late but Steve didn’t mind as it was a little warmer today. But Steve kept a sharp eye looking around constantly to check if anyone looked like they were looking for him too.
“I ran out of money,” Steve just said walking as fast away as possible but Clint followed close behind starting on his complaining campaign. This was not going to end any time soon and Steve learned to tune most of Clint’s whines out. Steve spotted Tony turning to look in his direction wondering who was talking but lost interest real fast at hearing Clint constant whining. Steve never felt like he could relate to someone so much in one movement but Tony somehow understood not to get involved with Clint’s little whining sessions.
“You don’t even have to ask punk,” Bucky punched Steve in the arm, “just...go get what he needs okay. No matter what.”
“Alright man,” Sam smiled and winked at him making Steve groan. This was not going to be easy. Still neither of them brought up the subject after and for that Steve was grateful.
Steve read the email a few times almost sure he wasn’t going to sign up for the raffle to win a date. He was single and a bit lonely but he wasn’t that desperate...at least not yet. Still, he couldn’t get the raffle out of his mind even when he went to lunch with his best friend at his favorite place.
“Hey,” a familiar female British voice spoke up behind him making him turn his head to see a smiling Peggy looking over his shoulder at his dancing monkey that he had drawn.
Steve shook his head at them and just sat next to Bucky on the large stone pulling comfort from the familiar heat next to him. It made him feel like everything was going to be alright.
There was a kind of karmic justice to everything that happened in Afghanistan that made it easy to know what he had to do when it was all over.
Steve sits down at the edge of the bed, his hand rests over Tony’s. It shocks him in a way, because it’s intimate, perhaps more so than the kiss – he’s kissed a lot of people, far fewer have touched him like this.
Steve's heart speeds up. Did he hear everything? Were Steve's words the ones that got through to Tony? Did he hear him?
'Tell me where you are,' Steve says as if it's an answer. 'Tell me what the hell is going on? I'm not going to let you die without a fight.' The pitiful, lonely, delusional part of Tony pictures Steve racing across the country, the planet, the universe, to get to him on time. He imagines Steve here touching his face, holding his hand, not letting go until his body's gone cold.
But he can't. He is alone, face down in the soil of a world he doesn't know, which is killing him with a slow kindness and he wants, just for one last moment, to feel the comfort of home. A flesh and blood connection that he can't have. Extremis is giving him as close as he'll get.
He imagines Steve crying at his grave like Tony cried at his. It’s a pretty thought, a kind one. He likes to imagine that he still means something.
It's strange to be bleeding from a wound that doesn't exist. Though the natives had implied the wound was internal, the blood is seeping from his pores like sweat.
There are things he wouldn’t do, maybe, but he can’t think of them now. Steve is touching him. Steve is his anchor to the world right now and Tony thinks he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Steve tries his best to sit up. Bucky takes the cup of water from him and sits it back on the table. There's something in Bucky's eyes that Steve can't read that makes Steve uneasy. He needs to speak with Tony, no he needs to see him and make sure that everything is okay.
Steve is trying to call him back. He allows the line to connect because he is guilty and he owes this much to Steve, so many apologies he is not strong enough to give.
In the polished surface on Tony’s suit, Steve catches his own reflection. The face staring back at him is one he hasn’t seen in years; thinner, more angular. The way his uniform feels like it is sagging off his body tells him what it had been that the Infinity Stones had burnt through to get their power.
Steve gathers the bowl, turns off the bedside lamp, pulls the blanket high over Tony’s naked shoulders and does not release the restraints.
Tony's airways are getting clogged with blood and snot and he gags on it, chokes and sobs until he can manage more words. 'If I die, would you miss me?' He waits for Steve to speak this time.
He feels Steve getting closer, leaning in for his kiss, his breath ghosting Tony’s cheek. ‘Don’t fucking touch me.’ He never thought he’d be so repulsed by the thought of Steve kissing him.
‘You of all people should know that hiding things from each other is the quickest way to do that.’ Bringing up the war he only remembers from newspaper headlines and talk show clips is dirty, but Tony doesn’t want to lose Steve any more than Steve wants to lose him.
Jarvis lets him in, his fuzzy slippered feet shuffling on the floorboards, but bright eyed and sunny smiled like Steve isn’t selfish and stupid and
He watches the crack of light beneath the door, feels when Steve falls asleep beside him. He considers getting up, seeing the world that Steve is scared to show him. He would have once, perhaps, but Steve is gently snoring beside him and Tony is tired of facing the world alone. He rolls over to watch Steve, feel his heartbeat, his breathing, his body heat and indulge in the intimacy of it.
Steve swallows around the lump that forms in his throat at the sudden realisation. He chooses to ignore the ringing in his ears and finds it in him to instead look up at Tony and give him reassurance. He can deal with his shit later, Tony comes first.
He pauses for breath and Steve cuts in. 'Then don't let them. If there are things you want to say, then come say them to my face.'
“Yeah?” She is smiling and stroking his cock again. “My knight in shining armour? Are you going to protect me from all those awful guys out there?” She throws her head back and moans, then fingers her pussy. “You’ll save me, won’t you? They left me wanting it so bad.”
Tony will oblige, because everything is playing in his head like a symphony of regret, reminding him that he deserves Steve's anger.
‘I suppose I need to show you this,’ Steve says. ‘I hope you’ll take it as intended.’ He cups Tony’s cheek, kisses him briefly on the lips, then takes his hand and helps him up from the bed. ‘You are my Tony Stark. Don’t make me lose you again.’
The gurgling black cauldron of stupid that pulls the strings in the recesses of his mind still needs to say his dying words of choice. They stutter and die before the rest of him does.
“I don’t know. I lo—” Tony shakes his head, agony in his features. “I can’t say it right now. I'm sorry.”
‘It’s a different world now, Tony, sometimes tough choices have got to be made in the interest of the greater good. That’s something you once tried to teach me.’
‘I’m fine, Steve,’ Tony says, but he feels flat, steamrolled, like he’s made of something hollow and his body had been inflated with nothing but air. ‘Fine,’ he repeats, but a little less sure this time.
‘Well maybe it’s too late for that. Maybe I can’t be your friend anymore. Maybe I can’t look at you without wanting to be sick.’
The flickering lights of the distant alien metropolis are blurry now. He thinks for a moment that it’s a sign he's losing consciousness, before he feels the tears slide down his cheeks.
Steve watches Tony go, then kicks his fallen bike, lowers himself to the floor and buries his head in his hands.
He continues to talk, can't stop really, the string has been tugged and he's unravelling like a poorly sewn sweater. 'All I want now is for you to know how sorry I am. How I wish things could have been different. I don't need you to forgive me, I don't even think that's really possible, I just need you to know. God, Steve, I don't want all the things I should have told you to die with me.'
Tony doesn’t know what time it is. He can’t see the clock on the wall and the blackout blinds stop the sun coming through. No one comes or goes, nothing marks the time. He hears footsteps just beyond the door every few minutes and is never sure if his imagination is reaching or if whoever’s on the other side is ignoring him. His limbs are stiff and restless. He wants to move, he wants to breathe fresh air and see the open sky.
The ground is covered in old stains of booze and spunk and god knows what. Sweat and sex and marijuana smoke swamp the air in an almost tangible haze and sequined bras shine in the flashing half light.
There is a long silence then. Tony imagines Steve alone in his apartment, burning with rage and maybe that's why Tony called him in the first place. He isn't worth Steve's love and he needs that reminder to make dying easier.
The distant buzz of Extremis is still ever present in his mind, but it's faded, crackling, like the maddening hiss of a speaker that's been turned down so low that the noise is indecipherable. He feels the mud on his face and the buzz in his brain, thinks of Steve and feels like an idiot. Steve died without knowing how much Tony cares and now Tony will die without telling him. Tony is an idiot because he never learns from his mistakes.
He assesses, as the soldier in him always does. Just an overturned whiskey bottle seeping out across the carpet. Just the neat lines of white powder on the dresser. Just an almost empty bottle of unmarked pills. Just Tony, lying pale and still on top of satin bedsheets.
Maybe the world doesn’t hate him and maybe Tony doesn’t either, but there’s a stain there that can never fade away completely.
When his hands are free at last, Tony reaches for Steve, wants to feel his muscles moving as he breathes. Steve grabs his wrist, holds it just short of touching, stares at him, soft and lazy. ‘Tell me what you’re thinking, Tony.’
"Steve." Pepper's voice is small, calm but unwavering. She smiles nothing but sadness and it makes Steve think the worst. Is Tony okay?
Tony’s teeth dig into his lip so hard it looks painful. When he turns his attention back to Steve, it’s as though a heavy curtain has fallen over his features. Everything in Steve wants to pull back that curtain and beg Tony not to hide from him. “I waited for years to hear you say something like that, and you say it now when I’m married and have a kid. When I might be paralyzed. When I have absolutely
Is it only that determination to see something through, no matter the cost, or how long it takes? It would be a lot like Steve on the surface.
‘I’ll do as I like. See, I brought you back from that coma and I can return you to it any time I choose.’
Steve is breathless on the line now. 'What's going on, Tony? Can you be real with me for just two damn seconds?'
It’s all hands and sharp movements and the room is cold without his blanket, but Steve is warm and close and Tony is drawn into it. He feels like he is leaving his body behind. Giving himself over to Steve. It’s sloppy, unsure, Steve’s hands roaming up and down his body like he has to feel every part of him. A hand resting on his chest feelings his breath and the beat of his heart, as if to reassure himself, Tony is alive. He is alive and breathing unaided. He is alive and breathing and conscious and here beneath Steve.
After Siberia—after he thought he’d lost Tony and his friendship and his keen wit and his dark eyes that had always looked at Steve with such warmth—Steve had sent Tony a phone and a promise. He’d promised that if Tony needed him, he’d be there.
“God Steve, you - I...” Tony fumbles with his words, shaking his head. Before he finally seems to stop and settles on what to say. “We did it, Steve. We - we actually did it.” Tony brings his other hand around now, to encase his smaller one in both. The difference doesn’t seem to phase him, or maybe he doesn’t notice, but the attention makes Steve feel a rush of affection for the man nonetheless.
'I don't know what you expect me to say, Tony,' Steve says as the silence drags. There's a hint of loosely held anger in his voice and Tony finds he resents how it disturbs his newfound sense of acceptance. He wants to imagine that Steve's reaction doesn't matter, that now the words are out there, he can die in peace.
A changed man who sleeps with Captain America every night. A changed man who has no intention of ever telling his partner the truth.
She pulls away from his cock, wiping away a string of spit and shooting him a seething glare. “Darling, I’m trying my best. You need some blue pills not a better blowjob.”
When she hands it to him, he drinks straight from the bottle, indulging in the grotesqueness of it all. Get it in his system to forget what’s up and down. Allow him to enjoy this, just this one moment, just long enough to implode his life.
‘I didn’t want to have to show you this,’ Steve says with a softness Tony has heard countless times when Steve speaks to scared children and wounded civilians. It’s never been directed at him before. ‘I think you should sit down.’
And even though he feels ill at the prospect of food, he’s cant refuse Steve such a simple request. Tony nods. Steve spoons mouthful after mouthful of tasteless soup down Tony’s throat and Tony swallows without protest. It’s intimate, but not in the way Tony has always hoped for. He feels like a invalid, a child, a burden.
In spite of himself, Tony laughs. 'Real. Yeah.' He isn't sure what real is anymore. Maybe he never was. Maybe he's spent so much of his life living in a metal shell that he's forgotten what it's like to be human. Or he wishes that were the case. He knows the words
Gritting his teeth against the pain, Steve raises Tony’s hand and flattens it against his cheek. “And now maybe you’ll heal completely. Maybe you won’t. Maybe the old me, maybe this tired, sick body is the new me. Maybe it isn’t. Time will tell. But the world—the world we all saved together—still needs us. All those people who were gone for five years are back, alive, and that changes things. Changes families.” Steve pauses, remembering Dr. Erskine’s urgings to him to remain a good man, not a perfect soldier. “No matter what, we can still be useful. No matter what, I’m by your side. And I’m not asking you for anything but the chance to stay there, please. Will you let me do that?”
His body will waste away here, only ever seen by others who are destined to die. He recalls the day they laid Steve to rest, the outpouring of love and judgement and what it felt like to see how thoroughly he'd fucked up.
Steve is as silent as he was that day on the hellicarrier. Tony babbles on to fill the void of fear that Steve's silence carries. 'I missed you so fucking much, Steve. I didn't feel alive when you weren't. I was living on autopilot, people blamed me, hated me, but never as much as I blamed or hated myself. When I sat down next to your body, saw you so lifeless and empty, I realised I love you. I guess I've always loved you.' He'd tuned it out, found other people to love, to fuck, to fill the emptiness in him that always wanted more from people. More from Steve.
Steve jabs him in the shoulder and almost instantly Tony feels his consciousness drifting away. He’s stripped and gagged and all he can manage in protest is a twitch of his fingers.
'It's a bit late for that, Steve. I think when I was born someone wrote "you will make stupid choices" and stuck it in my fortune cookie.' Like he can bring levity to this. Steve doesn't laugh now but someday he will. Laugh. Cry. Remember how Tony was a friend once and laugh some more because it’s only when you can finally rest that you look back and realise how much the sack of sand on your shoulders was weighing you down.
The air is full of the smell of their come and Steve’s sweat, the window is closed and still blocked by the blind and Tony is filled with the sudden urge to be outside, to see the world he’s missed out on and yet it feels cruel to want it now, with Steve here. It would be like telling him he isn’t enough.
It doesn't comfort him like he'd hoped it would. His death won't ease Steve's pain. You can hate someone and love them at the same time. You can miss someone who was a toxin in your life.
‘Well,’ says Tony, with a bitter smile, and there’s an audible quiver in his voice, ‘I’ll see you around, I guess. Goodbye, Cap.’ And Tony turns away, heading back to the motel, leaving Steve alone with his motorcycle.
He feels a sudden urgency to warn Steve. A nurse, a doctor, a journalist, and one could have walked in on them like this and sold the story to the tabloids. ‘Someone’s at the door.’
to give you.” The sound of his laughter, when it comes, is jarring, jagged, and lacking any real amusement. Hearing it slices through something essential in Steve. “I mean, talk about bad timing.“
He looks for battle wounds, burns and bleeding. He can handle that, a lifetime of war has taught him how to stay calm and steady when he’s panicking inside. But the truth is, he already knows it isn’t that.
feet, his dick – he’s doing this. Choosing this. He starts to shake. Pushes hard to his feet and can’t stop the room spinning. Stop, stop, stop. His pants are tangled around his feet, stumble, strangle, can’t get free. Nothing, nothing, he has nothing left to take.
“Hey Steve, welcome to the land of the living,” Bucky calls out. Steve blinks up at the ceiling, then turns to his head to the side to see Bucky seated beside him.
Her voice chases him down the hall. “Fuck you! I know who you are, Tony Stark. I’m friends with an editor at the Bugle and you bet he’s going to hear about this.”
And as Steve says it, Tony feels it. His stagnated limbs shaking with the effort to stay standing, the aura of a migraine building, the stench of death adding to the roll of nausea in his gut. He’s one step away from passing out and landing in the guys leaking brain matter.
Steve is by his bedside again. Different clothes, hint of stubble. Soft warm light creeping in from the doorway and lighting him from behind. He looks fuzzy around the edges, like an illusion.
Steve wants to say those ill timed bedside words again. It seems masochistic now though. He's lost too much to lose this friendship to his desperate romanticism.
He doesn't like this. He doesn't want to just lay here while Tony is in the other room with Steve not knowing what was happening. If he was truly okay or not and Steve was not happy.
Sweat damp sheets, sticky with blood that isn’t his, dark with ash and dust and the lingering reminders of a battle barely won. Stuck to him like a layer of dried paint. He blinks into the darkness and feels more awake than he wants to. Remembers collapsing here only hours earlier and wishes he could sleep away the demons that live in his memories. Wishes he could tune out the sound of screams and dying breaths with the sitcoms and soap operas that distract him in the day.
“I will do it,” Tony spoke up after his long silence, “I will do it but no more of this monarchy bullshit. If we are to do this Pep I can’t take the throne. My people deserve someone who is committed to them and their well-being, who can stay and be there to support and guide them. They deserve someone who loves them just like their own, someone who is so immersed in our culture that it would be easy to find a new way of life without jeopardizing the old traditions. That is why you should take the place of the first leader of the new regime Pepper, not me. Stane wants to create a new system of order to benefits himself, I say we counter it with our own and create a new system that helps our people thrive and stay safe that is different than the old ways.”
“So you won?” Bucky asked Steve over the phone as Steve decided to go for an evening run to get his mind straight from the news. After receiving the email and finishing up his end, Steve was officially going on a blind date set up by his company.
“Thought you were going to come,” Steve said looking abashed as he slipped his gloves back onto his hands. He didn’t technically need them but Tony only ever wore his gear if Steve did as well.
“I…I just want to go back to sleep,” he said laying down instantly closing her out. He heard her sigh as he turned his back to her. For a moment he felt guilt for treating her so coldly but that feeling soon vanished and the aching sadness returned.
“Tony!” Steve spoke up suddenly sounding a bit mad and harsh making the harpy jump in surprise, “I'm so sorry! I'm not mad at you. I thought you knew but I guess I should have said this before. You are a free person Tony. I bought your freedom not to cage you back up. I'm not your master. You deserve to be free. I brought you back to my team so you could have a place to recuperate and get back your strength. Not...I would…”
Tony blinked a few times as if trying to find another bad explanation to paint himself as the bad guy but Steve could see that Tony knew Steve wouldn’t buy it. Steve was tired of being lied to. After all these years, after all that pain, Steve deserved the truth. The real truth.
Tony went into the tent and began to use healing ruins on Happy while Bruce whipped up some paste to close the wound and get it cleaned from any infections. The duo worked into the night as Steve sat outside the tent with the rest of the team that had come back over the course of the day. It was hard but Steve was so thankful that Happy was out cold that he did not feel any of the things that they needed to do to help him.
They had a son. A son. Tony wanted to cry. He took a few steps towards the image and picked it up to get a better look. Tony looked older in the photo with streaks of grey in his hair but it seemed that the stress that had constantly followed him around was no longer there. Steve looked almost the same but Tony could see the small changes time had for him. He too looked like all the troubles in the world was far away. Lastly, there was their son. Grinning wide, missing a tooth with dark brown hair and shining blue eyes. The perfect combo of them. And Tony could bet that their son was brilliant.
Tony was a talker. Steve listened intently as the harpy spoke almost a mile a minute about any and all subjects that interested him. It seemed like the moment he realized it was more than okay for him to talk he did not stop. Though Steve did not mind listening to everything Tony had to say.
“Relax doll,” Steve kissed Tony’s earlobe as he whispered the words into his ear, “let me help you forget those horrible dreams. It’s the least I can do for my lovely husband.”
“Ah, yes of course,” Steve cleared his throat as he let Tony down gently and detangled himself from Tony’s body. He almost regrets the loss of body heat as the harpy distanced himself a bit and straightened himself out.
His eyes shot open and he sat up on his bed drenched in sweat. Steve’s breath was labored and harsh. He looked around wildly trying to take in his surroundings. A part of him was looking for Bucky. He always came to his side and comforted him but that was when he remembered. Bucky was gone. Bucky was dead.
Tony did not respond just stared at him blankly not really acknowledging that Bucky was addressing him. Steve gave an apologetic look but Bucky just shrugged not really caring. After Bucky stepped away Tony came into Steve's space and quietly took the rest of the items out of his hands. Steve was so shocked by the contact that he did not react in time to stop Tony from taking them away. But just as quick as he was there he was gone. Steve just stood empty handed and alone with Tony already following Bucky to the small supply tent that they temporarily set up.
“Pepper, Rhodey-we have to get them out first!” Tony shot up heading for his armor but Steve grabbed his arm and hated that he had to stop him from doing that.
“We are not far,” Steve spoke up making Tony jump a bit in surprise and seemed to close himself off more. Steve hated that he was making Tony more on guard but he was just trying to keep Tony updated. He just internally sighed feeling a bit frustrated because he did not know how to make Tony more comfortable around him. Though it has only been a few hours but Steve was never very patient person and often got frustrated easily but he was quite determined. Deciding to ignore his irrational side, it was not fair to Tony or him.
“Red looks good on you,” Tony teased pointing at Steve’s cheeks making him blush harder. It was strange to feel this way. He had not felt like this since Peggy and he was never sure how exactly he felt about her completely. Still, the feelings arose again but this time they were for Tony instead.
So despite his fears about Tony’s reaction and despite the pain and the sheer, unfamiliar weakness that Steve feels everywhere like a second skin but hasn’t felt since before the serum, he wills himself to sit as straight as he can in the hard plastic chair that’s pressing uncomfortably against his now-bony backside and face Tony. Chin up, shoulders back, Steve shares a gaze with the man who gave him a home and who has held his heart in his calloused hands for years: across oceans, through betrayal, through trauma and heartbreak.
‘I’m going to make you mine. For tonight, in body only, but soon, in body and mind for the rest of our lives.’
As Tony rests, Steve scans himself, like he learned to after Project Rebirth made every injury feel inconsequential. His muscles hurt, dull throbbing aches scattered across his body, from his temples to his feet.
Steve smiles a little. Soft, warm, like Tony is a child who’s just said something cute. ‘Just try a little. It’s been a long time, we need to see if your stomach can handle it. Please.’
Steve takes his hand and leads him down the deserted hallway to a viewing room. The lights are dimmed, and the windows blanked out.
Steve is still silent, but he's stayed on the line, waiting for Tony to condemn himself further, perhaps.
‘The why?’ Steve laughs. He’s cracking with a familiar fury that energises him. He jumps from the bike and hardly notices as it hits the asphalt. ‘You want me to tell you
Steve steps over and looks down at the body. ‘Bastard,’ he says. Then with a venom that is nothing like the Steve Tony has always known, he stomps on the man’s skull and it splinters and collapses beneath his boot like fragile glass. ‘And it was going so well this time,’ he says with a sigh.
‘I want you to be a part of my life. No matter how many battles I win, or what I do to help the world, I need you to be complete.’
Tony has killed before. Tony has seen Steve kill before. The man lying at his feet wears a Hydra uniform and probably would have killed them both given the chance. Surely.
He feels himself numbing, his brain drifting away from him again. He fights it, like he always does but the pull of unconsciousness is too strong.
'Christ, Tony, don't you fucking do this to me,' Steve is speaking with a frantic, breathless fury, hissing with it like there's fire in his mouth and he needs to spit the words out to extinguish it. 'Don't you fucking dare, you selfish bastard. If you want to show me how sorry you are, you need to be around to do it. You come here and you look me in the eye and show me what an apology means to you. I will never forgive you if you die without giving me that much.'
Steve claims he doesn’t remember much. Tony claims the same. There's a halting awkwardness to the conversation that says they both know they’re lying, but neither probes the other deeper, content to let those demons rest.
Steve's lungs feel tight. The first sign of an oncoming asthma attack he's felt since Project Rebirth. He doesn't feel like a hero, he feels like the cripple he has forgotten how to be.
Steve looks shaken for a moment, then he steps closer, within arms reach. He leans close. ‘You’re right, Tony. I don’t want us to ever fight on different sides again. You don’t either, do you? ‘
Steve’s fingers creep up, rub against Tony’s dick above the blanket. It shouldn’t be like this, Tony thinks briefly, so many years culminating in a quick fling in a hospital bed, because they’re horny and neither of them know what it’s like to be functional in love. Tony wants it too much to care. ‘Steve.’ He gasps as Steve’s fingers pull away, but Steve laughs softly.
The taste of blood spoiled mud is real. The smell of oncoming rain. The feeling of his body shutting down and the ground melting around him. Steve's voice is real too, somewhere many worlds away, but here, in Tony's head, the connection is false. Bound by Extremis. Another result of Tony's insatiable need to be something better.
It’s not the familiar smell of Steve’s recipe, it’s something mass produced, tasteless probably. Unappetising at the best of times. ‘Peppers,’ Tony says. ‘I hate peppers.’
It makes Steve ache for what they have lost. In another life, maybe their love could have been the start of something, not the end of it.
‘What the fuck just happened? Why did you do that? Why are there Hydra soldiers here? Who was he talking to?’ It feels like his brain is in hyper drive, thoughts spiralling too quickly around him to grab a hold of. He’s losing his breath. He’s losing his mind.
‘Fucking hell.’ Tony sighs, rubs his brow and let’s Steve approach him. He’s not in any position to make demands.
“I want to fuck you,” he says and doesn’t sound like him or feel like him or look like him. He wants to know what it feels like to fuck someone who doesn’t want you. Walk a mile in that man’s shoes.
How some of it had been Thanos until Tony had taken the Infinity Gauntlet off of him and snapped his fingers and saved the world.
The man does so, he kneels in front of Steve and clasps his hands like he is praying. Tony can see the fire in Steve’s eyes and the fear from the Hydra soldier, it passes over him like mist, he sees and hears but does not absorb. It’s like nonsense speak, an abstract painting he can’t figure out.
Everything after that happens in blur. Too much movement, too fast, and all at once. In the peripheral of his vision he sees a brief flash of Sam and Bucky rushing towards them, before he flicks his eyes back to Tony. The last thing he sees is Tony’s look of alarm before his eyes roll back and he feels himself pass out.
There were times when the mess was unfolding that he crumbled, he'd stood on the balcony of his multi million dollar penthouse and wondered if Extremis would let him die if he told it to. There were many more times after the war was over. After Steve.
Steve can read him, of course. Tony has a lifetime of acting to back him up, but near Steve these days his emotional façade turns into a thin veneer.
He thinks of Tony. Always does when he wakes up like this. Rich man, known a life that Steve doesn’t understand. He wonders if Tony’s sleeping soundly tonight or if he too hears the screaming of the ones they didn’t save.
Tick, tick, tick. The clock across the room gets louder and louder. Counting the seconds because he’s not tired anymore, he can’t sleep, he can’t move. He can only wait and count and lose count and start over.
Time feels slow, his brain does too, like he’s wading through sludge to grasp at every thought. Tony twists his neck, a little painful, but he can see Steve. The line of his brow is softer now, like it used to be. He would have liked to see Steve like this before.
The noise twists into focus and with a flickering buzz like an old school dial tone, Tony hears Steve's voice, faint, groggy and flat. Steve hasn't spoken to him with the affection of a friend since he returned. Tony hasn't apologised. Steve hasn't forgotten.
Steve smiled against Tony’s bare skin and began to explore Tony’s body leisurely like he had all the time in the world. Tony wasn’t so sure he did. “Please,” Tony whispered not knowing exactly what he was asking for but needing Steve to do what he planned a lot faster.
Once Steve talked himself into getting up he looked over to find Tony still fast asleep on his bed. He was glad that the harpy had not woken up so soon since Tony rarely got enough sleep as it was. Steve quietly climbed off the couch and got dressed in a new set of commoner clothes since he probably did not need his armor to walk around Brook. The armor was heavy and often put people on edge but he did come back to grab his cloak though just to ward off the chilly morning air.
Anton is the Swedish origin of Anthony. I kind of envisioned their past lives originating from a place similar to the Vikings and the Nords in the old days. Maybe you can figure out what Steve's old name is ;)
“Meet me by the back gate,” Tony whispered to Papa Rhodes before feigning an order for him to get the horses ready. The prince watched Tony wheel around towards him and it made Tony nervous. To have the prince’s eyes on him as he stomped his way back to the courtyard was exhilarating but also terrifying because Tony was dressing above his station in front of the prince himself.
Steve studied them carefully handling the gloves that's t Tony was still wearing. They were dangerous but beautiful and Steve figured it was perfect for Tony. They have been struggling with figuring out a good weapon for Tony to use while they went on more dangerous missions that required combat. Though they more likely than not left Tony with Bruce to watch over the camp much to Tony's displeasure. Steve did not like the idea of Tony getting hurt or having no weapon to defend himself. It was not fun to watch Tony and his enemies at the same time.
He expected this Friday to be a slow day like most. Steve had forgotten about the raffle he had signed up for until he heard an email notification on his computer pulling him out of his work binge. He opened it quick wanting to get back to his art but what he read shocked him.
Tony looked around and stopped dead in his tracks. The man on the bed...he looked awfully, no it couldn't be, Captain America? Tony half hated and loved the man and studied his file enough to know that the person laying there really was Steven Grant Rogers. He looked peaceful and in deep slumber. Tony could tell by the small detail that he was too neatly tucked in for someone who was not in a comatose state. Seeing his hero in such a state made him a little sad.
“Twenty-three,” Steve replied inwardly grimacing. He did not want the harpy to think his worth was no less than a mountain of gold but Steve had to think about getting at least
The next morning came and Tony was still snuggled up to Steve but when Steve looked down he saw the harpy looking up at him curiously. His eyes were beautiful and even more so up close where you could see the detail of small different colors dot over the brown.
had not a slither of it. That the man saw Steve as nothing more than a teammate that he used to work with. Their relationship never recovered like Steve would like but he hoped that Tony would be willing to give him a chance. Steve wasn't the same man as he was all those centuries ago but he would understand if Tony...if Tony wanted nothing to do with him.
So he did what any rational genius with a few too many drinks would do, he cradled Rogers’ waist with his thighs and lent down and planted a solid kiss on the lips. At first, nothing happened, which was to be expected, but then suddenly Tony felt fingers snake into his hair and the kiss suddenly deepening. Tony felt a tongue glide across his bottom lip and in his shock, Tony let it in.
“Where is he?” Nat asked instantly as she watched Steve pull on his battle gear and following suit. Steve did not want to reply because the more time he spent explaining it to the team the more time spent not getting to hi-to Tony.
“You're looking distracted punk,” Bucky, Steve’s best friend, spoke up after the first few minutes of silence.
“I won't hurt you,” Steve tried again to reassure Tony letting his hand stay stretched out in hopes Tony will take it, “I just want to help you.”
Steve did not wait for his comrades to pull out their weapons as he charged into the forest heading straight for the first saber that came at them. Sabers were the largest wild cats that could match Steve in height if they stood on their hind legs and had long saber teeth that could tear the strongest of creatures in half. Still, they did not scare Steve as he collided with the saber head-on with his shield. The saber howled in pain signaling the rest to come to its aid. Steve did not care he attacked with a swift punch in the face knocking the saber out. Still, the victory was short-lived when another body came crashing into him a moment later when others sabers had crowded around them and began their assault.
Since Steve could not ignore it, he investigated. He followed the sound until it got him standing in front of a pair of tent flaps. Steve always believed that if a person hides behind a cloth then he is a dealer who works on the shady side of the market, the borderline illegal kind. If this were any other time, Steve would have turned away from the tent and headed back into the busy market place but instead he found himself lifting one of the flaps and stepping inside.
“Yeah you’re probably been singing praises that I have not been fightin’ on the front lines,” Steve shoved Bucky playfully.
Steve just looked into Tony’s eyes and saw the sadness anger and fear. It reminded Steve that no matter how long it has been for him and how much he has been able to move on
Tony stood waist deep in the water shirtless. He looked fuller and more healthy than before Steve noted to himself. Tony continued to bathe himself in the clean lake water unaware of being watched. The feathers on his head fluttered and preened as he raked water through them. As he did so he let his head fall back giving Tony’s back a beautiful arc and gave Steve a wonderful view of his soft skin. Tony was breathtaking to see. Steve was just in awe and felt a little happy at seeing Tony’s stubby wings look fuller and begin to what many dubbed refeather themselves. It was a sign that Tony felt safer and more healthy in this environment that Steve had given him. He had helped in making Tony better.
Tony looked like he wanted to argue but instead decided to keep the comments to himself. Steve did not know if that was a good or bad sign. For now, they all decided that maybe it was time to move on and get some rest. This day had been packed and stressful. They all deserved time alone to process, though Steve was not keen on leaving Tony alone but he watched him to walk up to Rhodey and knew that the other harpy had Tony taken care of.
“Hey there,” Steve whispered, “you want to join me on a little adventure?” The horse moved its head towards Steve's abdomen as if answering him with a yes.
He finally made it back to find his apartment full of people and he shooed them all away leaving only him and Tony. The harpy looked confused and flustered but relaxed the moment they were gone. He hoped that his teammates didn't let weird people who could harm Tony into the apartment.
“Very eager, I see. Promise me something Steve. Do your best. Show them that you are worthy of their time. Don't let anyone tell you different,” Peggy gave him a determined look. He did not know what to say so he just nodded. She smiled her smile and walked ahead of him into the cafeteria.
“You look so beautiful like this you know.” Steve stepped back to admire Tony’s naked and wanting body but did not move far enough to lose contact with him.“Marrying you was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I love you.”
“I peeped on Tony,” Steve replied and Bucky gave him an angry stare that Steve quickly responded to by saying, “not on purpose! I was looking for him and Clint said he might be near the lake so i went to look and there he was all beautiful and elegant and...he was just...I know I should have said something but I was so entranced that I slipped, broke a twig and watched Tony run away into the forest before I had time to even process anything.”
“Listen the safest bet is for them to stay put,” Steve told Tony as he kept a firm grip on Tony’s arm.
“I,” Tony took a large breath with a large smile adorning his face, “I am not half as good at anything as I am doing it next to you. I love you Steve and I don’t want to stop being an Avenger. Your team welcomed me like I was one of their own not caring for my race or origin. You saved me from my captors, gave me my first gift and showered me with kindness I don’t know if I will ever be able to repay but I want to travel with you. I want to save others like we saved my own people...I just wherever you go, Steve, that is where I go. Whatever you want I want to find a way to give you. We are meant to be a team. You are my Wyrde, my destiny.”
Tony thought to himself as he continued to stare at the ceiling listening to the sounds of the machines he was hooked up to.
Tony woke up slowly, taking his time opening his eyes in an attempt to shield himself from the bright light of the sun demanding he wakes up. But, as he opened his eyes and his mind began to focus, Tony realized that the place he woken up in was not the same place he had fallen asleep in. First, he was abundantly warm, almost too much so. Second, there were birds chirping close by as if he was stationed next to a tree. from what he remembered, he quite literally had been surrounded by nothing but concrete and salt water. Third, as he opened his eyes and adjusted to the light, Tony found himself in a bedroom, pressed against a large firm chest, and kept there by two very strong arms he knew did not belong to Pepper.
As Steve walked he could tell that the trees were beginning to thin and disperse leading up towards the lake. The trees closest to the lake stood tall and thick from getting plenty of water. Steve peered around the last row of trees to see a vast blue lake that shined against the sun. If Steve was not looking for Tony he would have went back and gotten his sketchbook to draw the scene before him. But Steve went back to the task at hand and began to look for Tony. Steve did not spot him for a while and started to worry that maybe the harpy had gotten lost. A moment later Steve notice something broke the surface of the lake. Steve was in open and utter awe.
“You dare-” “what did you just say fucker?” “insult our teammate and companion!” Both Steve and Thor roared at the same time making the man shrink back in fear. They both were ready to throw down as Steve grabbed the man’s shirt and Thor raised his hammer but was stopped when a small familiar hand wrapped around Steve’s wrist. Steve turned to see Tony standing there with a solemn look on his face and Steve knew that the harpy did not want them to result in violence.
At that moment Tony Stark hated Justin Hammer. Even his stupid tech piece had a lot of problems just by scanning it with his eyes.
Twelve hours. It took them twelve hours to fully get Happy stable and healing normally. The wounded harpy was now sitting in Bruce’s tent eating some soup that Sam had whipped up for him to eat. It seemed that Happy had a lot to say but Tony would hear none of it until Happy ate something first. So they all stood outside Bruce’s tent waiting patiently as Happy slurped up the soup.
“Do it,” Bucky said nonchalantly, “you got nothin’ to lose yeah? You win you go on a fun date. You don’t win and your back to having no plans for next week.”
Steve will never admit that he did not sleep much that night thinking about Tony and what they had just discovered. This was not going to be easy but Steve knew that in the end, he will always help Tony with whatever he needed. It was what friends do. It was what Avengers do.
“Sorry babe.” Tony smiled softly and pulled Steve up to an open mouth kiss, challenging Steve’s tongue in a playful game of dominance. He groaned into the kiss, loving the feeling of Steve’s beard rubbing against his skin. Steve tasted like apples and cinnamon which was kind of oddly addicting.
Tony gasped and writhed, tightening his grip in Steve’s hair in desperation to keep himself from exploding too early. He didn’t want this to end just as it started.
After their short tour and discussion, or more like a one-sided conversation, Steve spotted the rest of his team stumbling into camp. Bruce and Thor were carrying new firewood for tonight’s dinner, Clint who had left soon after meeting Tony was holding their latest game, Nat was checking her knives, and Sam was holding up a map studying it to make sure of markings and navigation points on there were correct for their trip. They were all back and now so Steve was able to finally introduce Tony to all the members of the ream properly.
Or…“you could take my tent tonight. I will just bunk with Sam or Bucky,” Steve rectified and suddenly the tension was gone and Tony looked up at Steve shocked. The harpy could not believe that he was giving him his tent and sleeping quarters over which was odd since they had nowhere else to put him.
Steve looked towards the direction of the lake in worry. Tony never liked to stray far from the group. He always seemed to like having the company of one of the Avengers, that was not Steve, by his side. Pushing down the worry, Steve moved towards the lake hoping that Tony was alright.
After a seemingly long search, Steve found the most the source of the small noise he had come attached to. In the cage in front of him was the gorgeous creature of them all. The creature was hunched over exposing his excessively scarred back and wings...oh god his poor wings were almost plucked to the bone. Steve stepped closer and realized that he was looking at a badly abused male harpy. Why would anyone try and lock up such a beautiful and intelligent race! Steve wanted to kill the traders but he knew it was treason to do so. Instead he got close enough to examine the harpy further to try and assess his situation more closely.
“Well of course! I can’t have you out on the front lines without any back-up. You made me promise not to finish the war without you,” Bucky smiled before turning to look in front. Steve saw his friend’s smile fade away in an instant. It hurt to see him this way.
Steve had not seen a real result of those small transactions until two months into their groundwork. Steve had gone into the capital cloaked to find an item Tony needed for his growing armor that he was building. He spotted a small group standing outside a pub talking about Tony, well the prince who happened to be Tony. They were talking about how the story of his disappearance didn't add up and that they heard from someone else that it was a cover story for one that was a lot crueler and sinister. They debated for a bit as Steve stood a bit farther off to listen but most listening began to add their own inconsistencies out there and that confusion would eventually lead to the disbelief of those stories. It was all Steve needed. It was all the Avengers needed to get the momentum started.
“Morning sunshine,” Bucky smiled laughing when he got a pillow in the face as a reply. Steve sat up giving some space for Bucky to sit down.
They made it back to the marketplace and to Pepper’s hideout without being spotted by Tony’s family who were still out shopping. Pepper rushed pulling Tony into a tight hug before turning to papa Rhodes and doing the same with him. She checked them over before taking the robes back from Tony and ushered them out the door and to Rhodey’s location.
“Friend Tony?” Thor looked happy to hear the news that he was no longer the only prince in the group. Thor always loved having shared connections with them and it made him so happy when he found something they could talk about together. It has been interesting watching Thor figure out how to better connect with each of them. He really did try hard.
“I will do no such-” “it's for my dad,” Rhodey finally cut in speaking up. He looked hopeful at her, “all we are asking is three hours. Please.”
“No! Of course not! And if you hurt one feather on his head you backstabbing avenger stealing-” but before he could finish his sentence, Steve felt a hand rest onto his chest and looked down to see Tony standing there. The small golden red harpy smiled warmly at Steve calming him down instantly.
Once everyone was settled down around the newly lit fire, Steve asked Bruce if he would be willing to check on Tony. Bruce sighed a bit and grumbled how ‘he was not that kind of doctor’ but moved to check Tony out. The harpy watched Bruce approach him standing as stiff as possible. Bruce noticed the tension and quickly slowed his pace and softened his features and Steve could see the instant change in Tony’s body. It bugged him that Tony would easily get along with Bruce within seconds but have a hard time getting comfortable with Steve after hours of traveling together. Steve forced himself to look past those feelings knowing full well it will get him nowhere but a part of him was stubborn and refused to let it go.
He found the stables easy. The only thing standing in his way was a fifteen year old kid which he probably could get past without too much of a fuss. As quietly as he could Steve snuck into the nearest stall from the open door he had come through. He spotted a large black horse with a white streak running down the length of his face. Steve found the horse beautiful and almost felt bad for having to take it.
“It wasn’t really a raffle was it?” Steve sighed realizing that his friends probably had something to do with this. A part of him wanted to be anywhere but here but another part of him, a bigger part, wanted to stay and give this a chance.
Now that they were back they were free to celebrate. Papa Rhodes walked with almost a skip in his step if it were not for his stiff leg that forced him to limp along. Tony watched as Rhodey walked besides his dad talking with him while supporting a part of papa Rhodes’ weight to allow him to move faster than he could on his own. They were both excited to see mama Rhodes. Having him sold off to the crown was a sickening act done by his stepmother in an attempt to blame papa Rhodes for the recent disappearances of treasured items around the home. It was cruel to separate a mated pair from one another like his stepmother tried to do if Tony had been unsuccessful in saving him from that fate.
Steve was nervous as he sat in the back of the big truck to take him to his camp. They had somehow ran out of room on the bus though Steve could obviously see empty seats and was forced to sit with the ammunition boxes. If Steve was not so lost in thought he probably would have put up a fight. But here he sat. Staring at the boxes and crates wondering what they had in them. Wondered if he was going to use any of it. Steve doubted it. The stuff he could see was too fancy for him to touch.
The tongue played around in his mouth feeling, tasting, nudging. This was not something a comatose patient should be able to do. Still, Tony found himself responding playing around with the other tongue with his own until he could have no more.
It rung a few times and each one made Tony’s resolve waver but just as he was about to hang up he paused as he heard the line get picked up. Tony stayed silent waiting as if trying to reassure himself that it was the one person he wanted to hear on the other end.
Tony stepped up next to him and took a moment to take in Steve’s new body and look. He furrowed his brows a moment as if thinking about something but quickly replaced it with a playful yet little cold grin. “Gymming did you well,” Tony commented as they finally began to walk. Steve knew that Tony knew that it wasn’t really the gym that gave him this body.
It was Steve's turn to clamp Thor's shoulder in support. He gave the other man a small smile who returned it. They didn't speak again as they faced the creatures of the forest except to speak jabs and teases about the enemies they faced. Steve always had the easiest time with the Asgardian and they worked quite well together on the field.
Suddenly Steve felt a hard thomp on his forehead that pushed his head back and snapped him out of his thoughts, “you’re thinking too hard punk.” Bucky stood in front of Steve with a large smile on his face.
In sync, the whole team slowed down as to not startle the kidnappers. They all feared that if they startled them it could result in more harm. Came close enough to see a bunch of harpies huddled closely together with Tony nowhere in sight. Dread began to seep in as he crawled closer to the huddled group. They seemed to be fighting something and it was at that moment that Steve realized that the harpies were all surrounding Tony pinning him down.
“This is Tony,” Steve replied smiling sheepishly as he rubbed his neck, “uh I bo-saved him from some traders in town.”
“Ton-” Steve was cut off by a pair of lips crashing onto his. He began to kiss back at first before pulling away reluctantly. Steve wrapped his hands around Tony's wrist and slowly pulled back to look into Tony's eyes. The harpy looked confused at being denied and Steve half-wanted to just give back in and go back to kissing. Instead he guided Tony to sit on his mattress so he could recollect his thoughts.
After taking a long look at the image trying to memorize every detail, Tony moved on to search his nightstand. Tony opened the drawer with vigor feeling his heart race and hands sweat as he glanced inside nervously. There were a bunch of things that didn’t matter like crumpled papers, small pieces of tech he seemed to be working on. But it was the abundance of photos that littered between the miscellaneous items that drew Tony’s attention. He grabbed at as many as he could before leaning back and sitting more comfortably on the bed.
“Hello,” Tony replied, trying to sound indifferent when he was, in fact, ecstatic. He got up and put the plate down on the nearest table and walked over to the other boy in the room. The kid introduced himself as Justin Hammer sticking his hand out for a shake. Tony looked at the hand skeptically but shook it anyway. All of a sudden Tony was bored again and lost again. This kid was trying too hard to act like the adults in the room, so
“Don’t you have like some girl to pick up,” Steve smiled wider at his best friend. Bucky smiled back as he ruffled his hair.
“My wife,” Tony pressed one more time finally getting a look at himself through a reflection on one of the glass planes. He was young, and looked a lot like himself but not really, his eyes were blue to start.
“I am sorry Mr. Stark,” Anita began placing a tentative hand on his shoulder, “she had waited until you passed to make her decision to take out her name from our listing. I am afraid that Virginia Potts has passed on permanently.”
Steve just carried Tony back to his tent but when the harpy refused to let go Steve found himself climbing onto Tony’s small mattress and pulling the other closer to him. This is probably a bad idea but he was not willing to risk using strength and waking Tony up. He knew how hard it was for Tony to fall asleep. Tony had been spotted by many of the members sitting on rocks or tree stumps at night and often would pretend he gotten more sleep than he had.
Steve set out on foot looking for the nearest stable. He figured there would be one in the town a few miles away. It was easy distance for him so he headed out towards the town. Like he predicted it took him just over an hour to get there. It was smaller than its neighboring towns but he knew they would have a lot of horses to make up for its isolation.
Tony turned to look at the Prince who seemed to be looking at him in amusement. The look caught Tony completely off guard before sputtering out, “Servants are not thieves and those who are...well they do it out of necessity to live, uh, sire.”
“How long have you felt this way Stevie?” Buck asked quietly. His friend did not want to drive him away.
The gates opened and all the saved soldiers and stolen machinery poured in and mingled with the remaining surviving soldiers and pals. Cheers had erupted and it seemed like the anger and stress of the ordeal faded away. People were glad to be alive. People were glad to have their friends and battle mates back. It made Steve smile. It was never about him even as Bucky called out for a round of applause. It was never about him even as the Colonel came up to him thanking him. It was about the men behind him. They were the true warriors. They were the real Captain Americas.
“Because if there is a small chance of saving Rhodey’s dad you would do it,” Tony replied slipping on the second shoe. He came out from behind the wall and Pepper just gaped before smiling at him.
“Yeah, yeah for sure,” Tony shrugged pulling his tool bag closer to his person. The harpy didn’t look particularly happy at being left behind but he seemed okay with the alternative. Steve locked eyes with Tony and smiled reassuringly.
“First tell me why in the gods' names were you anywhere near that explosion Happy?” Tony growled balling his fists in an attempt to calm himself down. Steve reached his hand out and placed it on Tony’s shoulder for reassurance.
Tony opened the bag and pulled out metal armor gloves. These looked a bit different than the ones Steve has come across. They looked more like they were made for offensive than defense which was not what most armor gloves were made for. Tony slipped them onto his hands and they fit him perfectly, even painted red and gold like his feathers that were slowly growing back. Steve gasped a bit when Tony revealed the palms to show glowing centers on each glove with magic specific ruins that Steve recognized as the blasting kind.
“We will do it all together,” Steve whispered back placing his face into Tony’s feathers. Steve has been making small brave movements for a while and Tony seemed to enjoy his little touches of affection.
They have been traveling a bit the last week getting simple odd jobs to get some coin before they get to the next city. The jobs they did ranged from tracking down lost items to getting evidence on a crooked official. It was what they were famous for other than chasing down Hydra fractions and tearing them down from the inside out.
“Tony,” Steve called looking for the harpy but could not find him. The team had set up camp in a new area near a lake that was a bit far from any human town. Steve always did a head count and checks on all his teammates whenever they made camp. It was one of his paranoia tics that he had to do to reassure himself that everything was great.
“Sorry,” Steve apologized sheepishly, “it was harder than I thought it would be to not give into the curse.”
“So that was her name,” Bucky rubbed his chin playfully. They smiled at each other. Bucky always had a way to cheer Steve up even a little.
“I am sure I recognize your face. You hit me with that apple!” the prince said and Tony began to panic. This was not going to end well.
Still Tony wanted to show Steve in these stolen moments of his life as a young harpy. Steve followed dutifully using the opportunity to talk to others and spread doubt about the false story spread about Tony. It was hard since often times Steve would get worked up when someone blatantly insulted Tony to his face but never got physical only because Tony was there to stop him. Steve would have met any and all of them in the back alley for a few rounds with their fists. Some listened though and Steve could see the gears turning in their minds and that was all he needed. Plant the seeds and have that idea spread.
Steve just gaped flabbergasted at watching Tony speak to him for the first time. He didn't really know what to do or say so he just sat there looking like a drowning fish opening and closing his mouth. Still, even in his shock, Steve could feel the elation build up and soon a wide smile crossed his face instead.
“Did you get some rest today Tony?” Steve asked studying the harpy for any signs of discomfort. The harpy just nodded but gave Steve a small smile which made his insides melt just a little more. It always made him happy to see Tony smiling at him so openly.
“Okay,” Tony heard himself reply and felt his tense body begin to relax into the other man’s hold. If this was his only chance to be with Steve he would try to make the most of it.
“The 107th, why? Do you know someone in this unit?” Peggy asked but Steve was not listening. All he could think about was the fact that Bucky was not there. That his best friend was somehow gone. Does this mean he’s.-he’s dead? No. No. No.
Pepper studied them both ands replied, “fine. I will take one of his robes to the cleaners but I will give it to you before. You know you guys owe me big time. It's going to be a hassle to convince the cleaners to finish the job in a much shorter time.”
He forced himself to take a breath. Freaking out on Steve was probably the worst thing he could do right now. If he wanted to find a way back...back to the suck that was his life...he needed to stay composed. A part of him wanted to stay. To give up and give in and stay, but this was not his reality,
Steve reluctantly let the man go and watched him run away as fast as he could. If it were not for Tony, Steve would have given the man a good piece of his mind or well fist. Instead, he focused back on Tony who looked relieved. Tony should not have to hear such blasphemous words coming out of anyone’s mouth. He should stand up for himself! He is an amazing person that Steve is so glad he got to know and helped save him from the assholes who locked him in a cage and plucked out his wings.
“Not causing too much disturbance are we?” Steve asked with a soft smile as he joined the two on the ground. Turns out Sam was working on redwing using some guides that Tony had drawn up for him and Bucky had decided to keep him company.
“Punk!” Bucky spotted them first and stepped up towards Steve to give him a hug before he noticed Tony sliding up behind him. The two studied each other for a moment but it did not take long for Bucky to introduce himself but Tony just looked at Steve as if asking him to do the honor of introducing him.
“His name is Tony,” the merchant sneered at the cage, “or at least that was what the people who sold him to me called him.”
“They are miniaturized magic tools,” Dum Dum clarified picking up one of the tools that looked like a screwdriver with a pointy end though Steve highly doubted it was, “like this is a magic blow torch. The flame is not as strong as a normal manual one but it does a pretty bang up job if ya know how to use it right and I am assumin’ that yer pal does. They’re all marked in the pouch and just incase for some odd reason yer friend don’t know the tool symbols I slipped in a short guide in the material bag I will show ya next.”
“What did you bu-oh,” Clint stopped dead in his tracks when he spotted Tony who was putting things away with the help of Bucky. The man instantly turned to glare at Steve knowing full well what Steve had done but there was no heat behind that glare, Steve could tell, since he too had been a similar situation a few years back. It took them quite a while to get Clint to feel like they actually cared for him and hopefully they can do the same for Tony. Steve just gave a small smile at Clint knowing full well that Clint was willing to go without some of his supplies for a bit longer if it meant saving someone from that hellhole.
Tony had to bite his lips hard to keep himself from coming right then and there. Hearing Steve say those three words felt like a rush of endorphins through his body. He needed it like he needed air.
The pit in the bottom of his stomach churned more causing Steve to feel nauseous and horrified. He could not let that happen. A harpy losing his wings is one of the worst things that could happen to them. Wings are a part of their identity, who they are and to lose that has a major impact on their well being.
Bruce just smiled softly at him and patted him on the shoulder in thanks before moving towards his tent to start on the remedy. Steve felt relief flood him when he knew that Tony's wings were no longer in danger. Still, Steve looked at the group but could not spot the feathered head of the harpy anywhere. Maybe he was tired and in his tent.
“Figured you would be the one I had to meet for this blind date,” Tony grumbled pulling Steve out of his thoughts and back into reality. What did he-oh damn. Tony was his blind date. He was sure because no one else would dare wear such bright red pants and not only get away with it but make them look dashingly good.
“You found yourself a good pet,” a man came up to him after Tony’s outburst. Steve and Thor stopped in their tracks and both stared openly at the man who did not know why either of the two looked so outrageously insulted.
Tony froze completely. He knew that voice, but he was utterly confused as to why it’s owner was not only within such close proximity but that Tony felt strangely relieved it was him. The last person Tony expected to be in his bed, spooning him was Steven Grant Rogers.
The room was dark but he could hear sounds of medical machines running. He stood still letting his eyes adjust to the dark looking around a bit seeing the monitor with different readings that would probably mean something if he were a doctor which he could probably figure out but he didn't really want to. It wasn't until he took a step forward and the small room lit up. Motion sensors? That was pretty technologically advanced for a government-run facility.
“Dive, Steffan,” the man said as they stood in front of a pool of water, “you are ready to see the truth.”
“Sleeping beauty? HEY WAI-” Tony didn’t hear the rest of the man’s words as it was blocked by the wind crashing against his ears as he jumped. It was a dangerous height but he has done these kinds of jumps before and knew how to land safely.
“The shoes are too big,” Tony whined shifting a bit in his spot trying to get them to stay on. Pepper let out a soft huff of a laugh. Tony poured a bit and played with the robes in nervousness.
Steve knew Bucky and lot of the men were angry. He knew that they felt abandoned even if they understood the protocol and the risk. It did not matter. They still felt like they have been left to die and many of them are probably thinking that they did not expect to be here today or ever. It made Steve feel somewhat sad.
“Sorry Buck,” Steve answered sheepishly picking up his burger to take his first bite, “got somethin’ on my mind is’all.”
“You’re thinking too hard sweetheart,” Steve pouted, pulling Tony from his thoughts and making Tony laugh. It had been a while since he found something even remotely funny and he wasn’t sure why he thought this was endearingly cute.
Steve never felt like his small stature was something to feel bad about until he stood next to the other army recruits waiting for further instruction. Dark thoughts began to swirl in his mind but he had long since learned how to swallow them down. He may be small but he had the courage and will to fight like the rest of them. Even more so.
He hit the front desk hard as he entered not slowing down his momentum causing the reception desk to dent a bit at the impact. Steve did not care. The receptionist blinked in surprise before spotting Steve and putting things together. She smiled at him and told him where to go. Steve didn't wait until she finished before he began to move down the hall towards the designated elevators.
It was raining hard on the walls of the sheds the people of the land called homes. The sat huddled in the back corners hoping that their gods would forgive them. It always rained when the gods were angry. There was always a home struck by light causing it to go aflame killing those within it. They all prayed that today was not their day. Well, all except one, the arrogant prince who was heir to their throne. The soon to be a chieftain, was having a wild night with multiple women at once. He lost himself uncaring of who was watching. Their screams of pleasure were drowned out by the rain allowing him this small escape. The prince cared not for the gods or his people. All he cared about was having undeterred fun.
And so he ran. Ran faster than he thought possible. Steve needed to get there. Needed to see his face. The face of the one he refused to forget. The one he made sure to always remember. That was everyone’s last wish. That he remembered them. It is what they all deserved for saving their universe. Tony most of all. The world remembers what he has done. Steve fought for them to remember, to cherish what they have for what they gave.
He spotted one of his bunk mates standing at one of the corners and asked him for a round. The first time Steve asked the man scoffed but now it was routine. Steve knew that he got at least one of his recruit mates’ respect. Having one was a base. He just end needed to continue and get the others on board too. They’ll see. He’ll be just as good as them. Somehow.
“Hey! I’m not judgin’ if you had not come I think I would have probably be left for dead,” Bucky laughed patting Steve on the shoulder.
“Like you had a choice,” Steve could hear Sam’s voice on the other end say, “like they’d enjoy themselves knowing you were sulking at home alone.”
“Come I want to show you something!” Hammer smiled at Tony cutting him off midsentence. Tony held back a wince. He hated being cut off, his father did that to him enough already he did not need a pipsqueak to do the same.
He ran into the rain looking around trying to find his lover. The rain was thick making it hard to see. Still, he pushed forward following a barely noticeable trail of footprints that lead out of his home and deep into the village. His breath struck. His lover’s father lived near the town square. He was abusive and if he discovered his lover in such a state he would kill him. The prince’s heart began to race in fear as he sprinted faster weaving between the buildings.
Steve was surprised when Tony had shown up for their training session. He had just been ready to pack up his small workout bag when Tony appeared from behind a tree. The harpy prince looked nervous as he stood there shuffling in place. Tony had come. Steve felt himself smile wide and threw his extra pair of protective gear in Tony’s direction catching the harpy off-guard earning Steve a small squawk in return.
Tony wrapped his hand around Peppers and gave it a gentle squeeze. It was a soft intimate moment between the two. Steve just silently gave them a moment as he let himself wrap the idea around Tony being the runaway prince.
Tony sat silently staring at Rhodey seemingly unphased by his words. The silence went on for a long moment before Tony whispered, “he planned on having me killed, didn't he? Make a martyr out of me but since he didn't have a body he decided to tarnish my reputation and leave me to a fate worse than death.”
Tony gave the prince a quick thank you and a polite smile before beginning to rush his way out. Tony was a few feet from the bridge that separated the royals from the commoners when Tony felt a hand grab at his arm. Tony turned to give a rude comment only to see the prince standing there with a large smile on his face. Why was this alpha so fucking breathtaking?
It was Steve’s turn to go into the market and buy food and other miscellaneous supplies for the team. He was in no hurry since it was not often that he got some alone time away from his team. Steve loved them but traveling with the same people for awhile gets tiring and a bit socially exhausting. So Steve was totally fine with going into town by himself.
“I am trying to buy a gift for a friend who loves to build and fix things,” Steve started as they sat down on small stools, “I was thinking a traveling toolset he could use whenever he wants and a small materials bag that I see some of ya carrying around?”
“I really hope it goes well man,” Sam said before both he and Bucky said goodbye leaving Steve alone in his thoughts again.
Steve flew off the ground and instantly began to quickly but stealthily make his way towards the noise. He did not have to look around or behind him to know that Bucky and Sam had followed suit circling the camp to make sure the intruders had no escape. Steve kept his eyes searching and vigilant wanting to be aware of any oncoming attack.
“Yeah it’s quite the looker,” Clint rolled his eyes snatching the satchel with the artifact inside it. A soft gasp escaped him and Steve knew that it was the artifact. Clint had always been sensitive to curses and magic of the mind ever since Loki attacked them a few years back. It was not pretty to watch and Steve did not want Clint to face any more heartache from such magic.
“Soon Steffen,” the familiar male voice spoke up in his ear grabbing Steve’s attention away from Dr. Erskine, “we shall be together and you will come back to your former glory. Not that I would not love you as you are but you will need the extra strength to survive the journey.”
“We were having a conversation about Barnes’ disastrous hair,” Sam informed Steve who raised his eyebrow at Bucky who pouted back.
Steve felt like he was living a double life. Every time he stepped out onto the training field he seemed to flash into a different world only to be brought back to the present by his trainer calling his name. Still, he did not let the delusions affect him. He put his best foot forward and tried his best at everything they threw at him. He was not crazy. He knew that he was weak. That he was small. That he was slow. But if he could train to be a decent soldier than he could go out there and help them fight the big fight.
“Yeah uh huh okay. Let me know when you’re ready to share buttercup,” Sam answered rolling his eyes as Steve went back to just thinking about how he could have missed the signs and how much he was thankful for being able to have met Tony at all.
Tony paused turned to look at him paused and replied, “Arno Carbonell.” It was his brother’s name who had died at sea a long time ago with his mom but the prince could never know that.
The camp got closer and Steve could feel that he was gaining more and more momentum thrusting himself forward at a faster pace in an attempt to get back early enough for some shut eye. No one talked. Not Bucky. Not the saved men who he decided were the true heroes of war. It was dead quiet. The silence was necessary though. A lot of the men were still mourning the loss of their friends who had just gone down in battle. It bothered Steve but he knew he could not save everyone but he wish he could.
Steve took Tony to his apartment and the harpy looked around the small space picking up and poking some objects before finding the small bed at the other side of the room. Steve just watched in amusement as Tony jumped on the bed and made a little happy noise as he got comfortable. Ever since they had become superheroes to this city the people of Brook had been donating a lot of items to them and one of them had been a new bed for Steve. The old one was too small and frail and often creaked and groaned if you moved even an inch. This one was big and fluffy which seemed to please Tony who was now rolling on top of the covers.
Steve took Tony's hand in his and led him back to camp. He did not comment on how hard Tony's grip was in his.
“I was thinking about grabbing some food,” Steve turned to look at Tony, “would you like to come with me?”
“Hey, Rogers!” Shit! Darcy was walking towards his cubicle, in a swift movement Steve clicked the send button and exed out of the tab as fast as he could. Guess that was it. His decision made. Though knowing his luck he would probably not win. It took him five tries to get into the Erskine project, so for all, he knew he could bet that Steven Grant Rogers will still be dateless as he is now on Valentine’s Day.
Rocking, rocking. The world beneath him like a shadow. Okay, okay, okay; like it’s the only word he can remember. Okay, okay, okay. Just flesh and blood. Just bone and blood and flesh and - fuck, fuck, fuck.
‘We’re both here now.’ Steve is still holding his hand, like he can’t let go or they’ll lose each other all over again. ‘A lot has changed since you fell into that coma, Tony,’ he says. ‘You showed me a new world once, now it’s my turn to show one to you.’
He imagines Tony here alone, while Steve slept. Dwelling. Drowning his pain, numbing himself to it. Not numb enough. He steadies himself, buries Steve Rogers behind the soldier he has learned to be, and remembers how to move.
When Tony gets up to leave, he kisses Steve on the cheek. ‘I'm fine, old boy,’ he says and sounds anything but. ‘I’m fine.’
'I'm a fucking coward, Steve.' Breathless and broken, he finds room for the words, because he needs Steve to know he's not dead yet. 'I never should have called you. I'm not going to kill myself, I promise.' Maybe Steve doesn't need to know the rest of it. Maybe Tony can slip away into obscurity and no one need know about his last moments, because he could be alive out there, a hermit living the peaceful life in the mountains of an alien planet somewhere. It doesn't work like that though.
