“Stamford!” the man exclaimed, smiling and holding out his hand in greeting. “Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together.”
Sherlock took that as his cue to move, and he ushered John to where he had stood beside the corpse, squatting down beside it. John followed the best he could, his leg twinging in protest as he awkwardly lowered himself onto one knee, using his cane to support himself the best he could.
“It’s murder!” Sherlock expressed, gripping the railing. “All of them. I don’t know how, but they’re not suicides, they’re killings —
He’d had the blog for over a month now and had written barely a handful of times, nothing more than four sentences at a time. Ella said that he should be writing in his blog more often, to which he had agreed absentmindedly without any real intention to carry through with her request. She remained insistent, so on Monday John had posted about getting drinks with the rugby lads. He posted yesterday too, about those strange suicides that he’d heard about on the radio, so could probably get away with not writing for another couple of days. Any more than that and Ella would be on his case again.
Thirty-seven minutes later he was on the tube. Twenty minutes after that he was back in Ella’s chair. He hated that chair.
The line was filled with static, and a man’s steely voice spoke to him. “There is a security camera on the building to your left,” it said. “Do you see it?”
The park was nice enough. It was quiet—surprisingly so, considering it was nearing midday. Only the distant murmur of London traffic was audible some number of streets away. Still, it was too much, the echo too oppressive, so John started counting his footsteps.
Sighing, John turned away from the scene and began to limp down the street in the direction of the main road. It wasn’t too long before he came to a telephone box, which began to ring as he passed it. John stopped and looked at it for a few seconds, wondering if he should answer it, but decided against it and continued down the road. The phone stopped ringing.
The café was small and crowded, so Stamford offered to buy their coffee while John waited outside. Had it been anyone else, John would have suspected that the gesture was out of some twisted moral obligation that probably had something to do with his cane, but John had known Stamford well enough while they were studying at Bart’s to know that it was the same gesture of kindness that he would show anyone, limp or not, just because he was a good bloke with his heart in the right place.
John looked over to Sherlock, and was surprised to see that, as he stared at the corpse, his face was twisted with regret. The three of them stood in silence, all focused on the body of Jennifer Wilson, before Sherlock whipped his head to look at Lestrade.
“Friend of mine,” Sherlock smiled back, before pausing to revaluate. “Well,” he continued, “when I say ‘friend’…”
He smiled in a way that was either mocking or teasing, but John found that he couldn’t tell the difference. He looked blankly at the man before turning to Stamford for answers.
John laughed and shook his head, and Sherlock chuckled along with him before turning to gaze out of the cab window.
John glanced at the clock. He had just under an hour until his appointment. Sighing, he drained the rest of his coffee, closed his laptop, and decided against eating the apple before reaching once more for his cane and continuing with his morning routine.
Sherlock’s head whipped around to look at him, and he stared at John so intently that he wondered if he’d said something wrong. For the first time since they’d met, Sherlock Holmes appeared to be struck dumb.
He picked up his coat and scarf headed for the kitchen, not sparing John a second glance. John supposed that he had been right all along: Sherlock Holmes was barking mad.
“We’re here,” he said, the cab slowing down and stopping a few hundred feet away from a road barricaded by police tape. The street was illuminated by the red and blue flashing lights from both the police cars and an ambulance, and Sherlock thanked and paid the cabbie before leaping out, bounding around the back of the cab, and opening the door for John before he could even reach for his cane.
His head somewhat clearer, John closed his laptop and placed it back in the drawer, ready to prepare himself a cup of tea before bed. John closed the drawer, and didn’t give his gun a second glance.
Sherlock looked between the two of them, baffled. “Dear God, what is it like inside your funny little brains? It must be so
John said nothing and raised an eyebrow, still not convinced of Sherlock’s honesty on the blog. Sherlock’s face fell into a frown.
“Hmm?” John glanced from Sherlock to the body, then from the body to Lestrade, silently seeking his permission to comply with Sherlock’s request.
.” He strode up the path to the front door of the house, his eyes wide and innocent. “I’m sure Sally came ‘round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over. And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.”
Sherlock smiled and breathed what John was class as a small sigh of relief, had it been anyone else. “Yes. Yes, my thoughts precisely.”
“Are you sure?” John asked, gripping the handle of his cane and standing, minding his bad leg. “I mean, well—you know, I don’t really exactly get on with people very well anymore. Not since—”
“Here,” Stamford said, holding out a takeaway coffee cup. “I couldn’t remember how you liked it so I asked for it with no sugar and brought some packets instead.”
A black car pulled up at the kerbside by the telephone box. It was clean and sleek and expensive and obviously well looked after. John’s grip on the phone loosened as the driver got out and opened the door to the back seat.
John followed Sherlock out onto Baker Street and closed the door to 221B behind them. Sherlock hailed a taxi and the two got in, the air between them thick with anticipation. John, still feeling uncomfortable staring at Sherlock for too long, divided his attention between the busy roads outside the cab window and Sherlock, who was studying his smartphone intently.
“Thanks,” John smiled curtly, ducking under the tape. He was about to walk away when Donovan spoke again.
John thanked him again and the two sat down on a nearby bench. Wondering how to continue the conversation, John glanced around the park and took a swig of his coffee before turning back to Stamford, who didn’t look nearly as uncomfortable as John felt.
John moved to protest but Sherlock, with his back to him, didn’t notice. Instead, John watched as Sherlock moved in a haste of billowing coats, taking a small pile of unopened envelopes from the coffee table on one side of the room over to the fireplace on the other, before placing them on the mantelpiece and stabbing them through with a penknife. Next to the mutilated letters, John noticed something else.
John looked around the living room and nodded to himself. It was more spacious than he had expected, with tall bookshelves framing either side of a large fireplace, in front of which sat two large armchairs. Opposite the fireplace on the other side of the room was a large couch and coffee table, and separating the two was a hardwood desk. Above the desk, a strange animal skull was mounted to the wall between two grand windows. John turned around to take in the rest of the flat, first its odd wallpaper, and then the snug kitchen that branched off the near side of the living room, and then of course the monumental amount of clutter that really had to be sorted. Despite its eccentricities, John liked it.
John thought about it for a moment. Sherlock was a strange man, and not the type of person John would have previously considered as a potential flatmate at all. But, still, there was something about this man, something that had latched itself onto the back of John’s mind, and he found that despite their strange encounter, he really did want to go meet with him. It felt strange—almost indulgent.
“What about these suicides then, Sherlock?” Mrs. Hudson came back into the living room, this time holding today’s newspaper. “I thought that’d be right up your street.
“But you’re not his friend,” she stated, and John turned back to her, confused. “He doesn’t have friends. So who
He didn’t elaborate, and John didn’t question further. “Come on,” Stamford said, standing up and gesturing in the direction of the hospital, “I’ll introduce you.”
“No, no.” John shook his head and tried to sound convincing. Stamford, however, didn’t seem to mind.
“Harry and me don’t get on,” John admitted. “Never have. Harry and Clara split up three months ago and they’re getting a divorce. Harry’s a drinker.”
“Your phone.” Sherlock held out his hand and John fished it out of his coat, handing it to him. “It’s expensive. E-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you’re looking for flatshare; you wouldn’t waste money on this. It’s a gift, then.”
“My deodorant?” Anderson took a step toward Sherlock and crossed his arms, his glare never once wavering.
“But you’re the more sitting down type,” she continued, turning toward the kitchen. “I can tell. I’ll get you that cuppa and you rest your leg.”
Anything John might have asked about Sherlock’s ‘friend’ was cut off by Mrs. Hudson, who had come up the stairs behind them.
John turned to source the unfamiliar voice when his eyes landed on a man a few tables down, back straight and delicately holding a pipette filled with… something. He was dressed in a suit that looked much more expensive than any John had ever owned, and he had delicate, pale features that were framed by a dark mass of curls. He contrasted greatly with Stamford’s rounder, red-faced complexion, and John’s own more golden hair and skin, bleached and tanned by the Afghan sun.
Just when the silence was becoming almost unbearable, Sherlock lowered his phone and turned to John. “Okay, you’ve got questions.”
“Oh, don’t worry about that,” Stamford interrupted, smiling. “I have a feeling he’ll like you just fine.”
John frowned at him and looked over to Stamford, who smiled knowingly at him. The man continued to type.
A short walk later and John found himself back in the familiar corridors of Bart’s. Stamford took a left toward the labs and John followed him until they stopped in front of the last door on the right. Stamford peered in through the window, smiled, and gave a brief knock before opening the door. He entered the lab and held the door for John, who nodded appreciatively and followed, glancing around the room.
“Suitcase, yes,” he continued, distractedly moving about the room, his coat flouncing behind him in a dark wave. “She’s been married at least ten years, but not happily. She’s had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married.”
“I’m here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Sherlock said, his voice cool and scarily monotonous. It struck John that this was Sherlock being professional.
Sherlock shrugged, nonchalant. “Not much,” he admitted. He peeled off the gloves, reached into his coat pocket to retrieve his phone, and began typing.
“When I met you for the first time yesterday I asked you ‘Afghanistan or Iraq’,” Sherlock stated. “You looked surprised.”
He walked firmly past another telephone box determined not to look at it, but it too began to ring. Mystified, John stared at the phone and wondered whether or not he should answer it. Curiosity got the better of him, it always did, as he pulled open the door and picked up the phone.
He failed. He woke up on the floor, very disoriented, unsettling taste on his mouth, cold, a slept arm trapped under his chest and a pain of his neck from the sleeping pose.
Then he jumped onto the gun, and held it with all the strenght and weight he had at the moment. It was not much.
The second one starting from the right stood tall and firm. He moved his head in a bit of a herratic motion, but his eyes were stuck to the camera. He had that expression Sherlock knew very well.
That one. The ‘I can’t believe you are considering this, and I’m waiting for you to make a counclusion I will react to quite amusingly no mater wich one is it’
He hadn't read it jet when the door busted open, nearly kicked off its place, and three agents dressed in black jumped on him to hold him still.
The dog stood at the edge of the rock, barking at the man who had just fallen, as the police team secured him and picked him up of the bushes.
“No. Don’t go near the lab to bother my co-workers. I want you out of this place alltogether. ‘till the results come, you’re banned”
“The track divides: here’s probably were they dispersed. Don’t worry that’s why we got five dogs: one for each missing target”
But John had not been poisoned. There were no results of poison in the tests, and he had been smoking… no. John didn’t smoke. He had skinned his knucles but he didn’t smoke, and the knuckles were no longer skined and he smelt like… the baby. Got to protect Rosie. Poor little thing, so small, so simple, and yet left without its mother and father. She was just a meaningless mind, she would not remember what was happening… but right now she must feel so lost, and so lonely, and scared, and hurt.
He seemed happy to be here, now, excited, even, like a kid who loved pirates and found himself suddenly in an actual pirate ship.
John looked at him, and then arround, and cleared his throat, and opened his mout, and closed it, and then sighed
He started filling the downfall of his high… and his brilliant mind collapsed little by little, like a rollercoaster getting to the higest part of the trip and slowing painfully before a quick fall.
“Yes I did! John and Mary shared their life together with me. They would pass out in exaustion in my couch, and I was left alone to take care of the baby… and we did fine! Wonderfull, even. I can do it”
.”  Mycroft simply walked in with no invitation issued, leaning casually on his trusty umbrella for what John always assumed was dramatic effect.
“So I’m to leave him with you?  A middle aged divorcee, and father of two whom he never visits as he spends so much of his time in a
He would run himself ragged, and still stay up, listening to Sherlock explain whatever mad experiment he was running, or he’d listen to him play the violin for hours on end, just to avoid the inevitable.
?”  Mrs. Hudson was wiping the tears from her face.  Sherlock looked at John, his face was drained of color, there was sweat on his forehead, his brow was furrowed.  Even sedated he looked panicked. But at least he was asleep for a change.
“John?”  frantic footsteps were running up the stairs, his door flew open.  Sherlock was wide-eyed and peering around the room.  His violin was in hand, but the bow was nowhere to be seen.
“He doesn’t take it.  It makes him lethargic which only makes things worse.”  The few times John had taken the Benzodiazapam, he had laid in bed four days straight.  No food, barely any liquids.  By the time the medication had worn off he was dangerously dehydrated.
“Nothing I can say.  Keep and eye out for Sherlock.  Moriarty will work to break him in more ways than one.”
“Baker Street.” John rasped, nodding his head.  He knew.  Sherlock was there, he knew he wasn’t in Afghanistan.
As he resumed his walk to Ella’s office, John looked at the people around him, a young woman with a screaming baby in her lap, looked about ready to cry, her eyes were red rimmed with deep purplish bags just below them.
“The thing is, John.  I am almost positive that this was murder.  And there is every possibility that this case, and yours might be connected!”
“We were speaking about a event that occurred shortly before he was shot, and he began to suffer the most vicious attack I’ve ever seen.”
“Pad Thai, Duck Curry?”  The hostess held out a paper bag to Sherlock who took it, with a nod.  Offering John his other hand, Sherlock pulled his flatmate to his feet, and keeping a steady hand on his shoulder, walked him out the the cab.
John made his way up the steps and into the flat, he heard Mrs. Hudson below busting about, clearly making tea based on the sounds of clinking china.  He hoped she wouldn’t come up.  He’s already lashed out at Sherlock, he would only hate himself more if he did so with Mrs. Hudson.
John’s face turned beet red, he sputtered angrily, having no words.  This infuriating bastard never knew when to shut the fuck up.  Had John been a lesser man, he might have thrown a punch.
“It’s only that you always tell me that I should sleep more.  And you’ve not slept anymore than I have.”
“He’s roughly six foot, three - 320 pounds.  Preferred a beard, despite rules about facial hair.  He spent most of him time peering through a rifle scope.  It wasn’t hard to get away with.”
I'm thrilled with the response to the story thus far, and I'm really glad you seem to like it.  As I'm writing I feel like it's just getting better and better, despite the copious amounts of angst.
.  Unfortunately, you injured yourself during your panic attack.  The Doctor thought it would be best, at least for now, to keep your restrained.”
Before the words were even out of Sherlock’s mouth, John had grabbed his coat and threw it on.  “I’ll get us a cab.”
Sherlock stood by the front window, playing something on his violin that John had never heard.  He stopped occasionally and marked a note on a sheet of music.
The questioning, and mild flattery abruptly ended when Sherlock’s phone chirped.  “Lestrade’s ID’d all the victims.  The big guy, Daniel Ferguson was active on leave, the house belonged to he and his wife Lacey… Lacey Mitchell-Ferguson.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and shrugged, allowing John the rest of the trip back to 221B to ponder in silence.
Everything else was a blur.  He was all limbs and eyes, and cheekbones, and dark curly hair that seemed to have a mind of it’s own.   And despite being ever so slightly afraid of him, John couldn’t be bothered to look away, he didn’t even hear himself argue the point that they didn’t know one another, and suddenly they were moving in.
“So.  Not good?” Sherlock asked.  He had taken to this inquiry when he was questioning himself, or his actions.
“These two as well.” John muttered.  “All three men of military persuasion.”  Stoically, John rose, ripped off his latex gloves and glanced quickly at Sherlock.
Sherlock, gestured to the cabby to stick around before walking into Thai Garden.  The hostess groaned at the sight of him.
“When I was told there was nothing to be done about Moran’s abusive disposition, I spoke with the General.  He did not care for what he considered my insubordination, in questioning Moran’s usefulness.”
“Anderson, of course.  Trace amounts of what appears to be teflon… but I won’t know unless I take samples.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, he kept playing the short piece again and again, a different note here, or there, then he’d stop and mark his changes.
Read the head line.  John didn’t read the speculation regarding the case.  He knew what happened.  Instead he turned to Arts & Leisure
“Yes.  Of course.  I’m sorry.  The skateboard… just…”  He couldn’t articulate, but the older man nodded, a knowing look in his eye.
.  But I’d rather be sure of what we’re looking for than just assume.  Looks about the same as an adder venom response to me.”  Anderson announced.
The kettle clicked off and John quickly made tea for both himself and his flatmate.  Sherlock was clearly too stuck in his own mind to thank John for the tea, which was quietly placed on the table by his left arm.
“Multiple cuts, and stab wounds to the face and chest, looks like cigarette burns to hands and arms.  These men were tortured.”  John crouched down, looking closer at the victims, and their injuries.  “This one bled out via a stab wound to the subclavian artery.  The other a punctured lung.”
The nightmares and anxiety attacks had not stopped.  John found the more time he and Sherlock spent around a body, the worse the nightmares would be.
“You think Moran was responsible?”  Sherlock was on his feet now, John was collapsing in on himself, his breathing was becoming erratic, his eyes wide, he’d spilled what was left of his tea.
has ceased his appointments with a therapist and he isn’t taking his medications as prescribed.  If the medication was not working, he should have been placed on something else.  By not taking it, and not talking about it,  he created something like an emotional bottle neck.  It built up until until it had no choice but to break.”
It had been a particularly fascinating case, four bodies, one room.  There was no carbon monoxide leak, no injury,  just bodies.  Sherlock flitted around each one, looking at every angle, seeing every detail.  John was on sparkling form, noting certain physical characteristics to the texture of each victim’s skin.  “It’s snake venom.”  He had stated.  Sherlock took a set of gloves and carefully cut the forearm of each person and squeezed.  A thick coagulated almost black substance was pushed out.
He clicked the phone off and glanced dejectedly at the inscription on the back.  Under any other circumstances, he might have called Harry, but right now, she was the last thing he needed.  He shoved the phone back into his pocket, and looked around, wondering where the nearest cup of tea was.
And to add insult to injury, my car now needs a new catalytic converter, making it problematic for me to get to work to make the money required to pay for all this broken crap.  (Excuses, excuses)
“Collateral damage, I’m afraid. Clearly our intruder or intruders, were after these three men, if for no other reason than they were in fact soldiers.”
Despite his desire to not let problems affect the work, a second case crops up, looking more and more like Moran's handiwork.
“So I assume you’re asking me to look into recent discharges who served at the same time you did, is this correct, Doctor Watson?”
“It’s okay John, it was just a dream.  Everything is fine, I swear!  You’re home.  London, Baker Street!”
It seemed odd at the time, that John found Sherlock’s case behavior almost relaxing.  He could count on the small noises, and often, a small violin concert.
John frowned, “Not exactly, there were six fractures found above the maxillary region.  The parietal bone bore the most damage, but nothing breached the blood-brain barrier…  The blow the the left temporal bone and the zygomatic process could have been the most devastating.  All I know is that upon discharge, he was deaf in his left ear.”
“Sherlock Holmes, you will allow this man to do his job and help John.”  Mycroft stood directly behind Sherlock now.  “Dr. Evans, I hope you’ll forgive my little brother, he is rather attached to Doctor Watson.  These are his medical files, I hope they prove useful.”
“You’re tachycardic, your breathing is inconsistent, your pupils are dilated… this is a stress response.”
On the floor immediately inside the door was a woman, gun shot wound directly between her eyes.  Sherlock knelt down and looked her over.  “Nothing much to see, the killer didn’t waste any time on her after gaining access into the house.  No exit wound.  Through the door and into her skull?  The round will have
The police team a few feet down and scatered irregularily around spoke on the radio and comunicated wih the helicopter that still floated above the trees, too thick to see throu.
The dogs started getting restless when reaching a large rock covered in moss and surrounded by thick bushes and trees. Sherlock couldn’t see what was on the top, but the dogs jumped up the rock and suddenly the air was struck by the sound of a gunshot, and dog whining.
And Greg jumped like a rabbit. Turned around and saw him. He was there, he seemed calm… but Greg could tell he was eager.
“I… I did to cope with John’s death! And then turns out he’s not. And more people keeps dying… with his face! And Sherlock…”
Sherlock was so in love. He loved it. The video that provided him with clues to find John, to see him alive and in good use of his capacities, the fact that John knew him and sent this to him… and the man on the chair glaring at him.
Mycroft sighed through his nose with closed eyes before he checked the data he had already requested, on the tablet.
Two days later, he had estimated a posible number of implicates, together with the material they may be using, and the kind of place they could be stated in...
He embraced Sally and Lestrade, and promissed him to invite him at the bar very soon, jumped into the car and borrowed a phone to call his mother.
There was not much anymore to see there, and it was not fully reliable after days, but he needed to check it once more, this time, as a kidnap scenario.
“I will not leave my job for your… issues. I will do my job even if you insist on waisting all of our time and I refuse to let you get to me anymore!”
Sherlock nearly threw it down the toilet, but then remembered he would need it tomorrow, and kept it, just under the couch matress, and kept playing the violin higher and higher.
Doc shouted histeracly as the four copies advanced up hill among the trees, terrified of him. Dog, by his side, walked slowly, his body feeling heaby with the drugs.
No one dared to question. Nor speak. Someone reestarted the video and they all contamplated to Sherlock writing whatever on it, passing page after page, and writing more, without taking his eyes from the screen.
The baby beamed at him and took a hand out of her own mouth to try and touch his face, and pull at his hair.
They had to give him a gentle push so that he would notice that it all was about to end, and it was his time to give a speech, and throw a handful of sand in there.
"...the killer wants us to have the sensation that no one is safe. They will keep doing this while we keep guessing. They don't even need to find victims who look like John. It can be anyone"
That is, for now. It was just a matter of time ‘till he would run out of patience… or grow used to it like Lestrade.
Lestrade got up. Sherlock recogniced signs of anger on his expression and body languaje, tough he was obviously restraining himself
It was ovbious it was a lie, but he didn’t want to complicate more things by getting Sherlock into jail. Whatever he was doing, it had o be part of the case. It had to be.
Sherlock looked at him with a rock cold-sad expresion, and didn’t calculate the weight of his words.
She certainly had. After Molly’s death, John had fallen back into depression, and he hadn’t been capable of taking care of a child, so he had given her up temporaly.
Sherlock found him sitting on his chair, sipping some tea and contempling the clotes he had been wearing wich burn in the fire place with what seemed like delight.
She spoke too fast to be honest in any way. It didn’t help that, behind her, the boy had sticked out his large phone, and was flashing at him at the moment.
“…so traumatic, I had time enough to make some firm decisions, and one thing on my list was to make sure I told you about this. My feelings. For you. …And to learn the consecuences”
Mrs. Watson felt uneasy with how he managed the baby: like it was any other day to day tool, like the phone or a notebook. Casually, naturally. And she wasn’t sure if it was a good or a bad thing…
And the sound of it, the way it came out, John’s expresion with eyes fixed on his, it was one thousand times the climax of a drugs shot.
He had been there from the moment she had been born. Earlier, even. During the pregnacy… and babies colect sounds while in the womb, so they can recognice familiar voices after birdth…
He took off hi shoe, peeled off the template, and lifted the piece of plastic there, under wich, there was a tiny bag of white powder.
Sherlock shut the door on her face, for a second they could still hear the sentence being ended on the other side.
…Oh right. Lestrade was on vacations, for John’s funeral, and John couldn’t help him, cause he was dead, and it didn’t really matter how hard he worked on solving it, this was still hapening.
“You were convinced you needed that baby and then you found is for the best to let her go. Just… take a few days to let the burial sink in and… maybe the… substances you’ve been taking to wash off”
Doc shouted in desspair, kikced Dog and finally got to point the gun and shot... And the bullets went missing in between the trees and the distance.
Some may argue agains't it but I am one of those exhausted and offended by the abuse of queer baiting.
Before it was served, someone with a familiar voice sat next to him and announced he would pay that drink and another one.
Soon, there came a moment when his body and his brain decided they had had enough chemicals and excercise and not enough rest, and he collapsed.
Lestrade started babbling “It is a risky move, the bridge thing, there has to…” But Sherlock had crouched closer and carefully whispered on his ear.
Sherlock run up the rock, sliping in the moss and climbing frantically, stood in the way of the handler and held the hysterical animal by the leash.
Sherlock knew how the traking dogs worked, but he was still annoyed at the sight of them being slowed down by their handlers, who at all times held them with a long leash.
He assured her he was in perfect conditions (exagerating a little here, with the obvious intention to calm her down) and told her to come visit for dinner.
Molly didn’t need to. She was quite used to death, it was not the first time she worked with the corpse of a known person of hers… but it was still harsh.
But whenever he had been moved arround he had been drugged to aboid struggle, so he had had plenty of rest, too much, really.
Greg tried to calculate how far he could get, and he knew he was going too far but he couldn’t help it. He had to say
“why do you think he dropped of the case? Its all over the newspapers. ‘Sherlock Holmes quits the case of the many murdered Watsons’ uh… quite dramatic… you know why?”
She turned away from him and kept working for the rest of her turn silent, firm, proffesianaly, and without looking at his eyes not even once for the next 24 hours.
John did just as he said he would, and then put on his usual clotes, wich were now a bit baggy on him. No big deal: he planned on refilling them soon.
His phone started ringing, and he run away muttering “Make sure to make that dental test. I want it…”
John’s doctor stated that he should be back in shape before he took his daughter back. John felt outraged, but it didn’t really make much difference: he reincorpored to the routine, including his blog entries, and gained his weight very easily and quick.
What could he do? Was it really his fault? Was there anything he could have done? With all the cameras and micros and… and Sherlock? What could he do with him?
“Mycroft. Brother. You know John helped me. She could help me. We could take care of one another. I… need her”
The older Holmes asked silently for a glass of water and placed it on front of the agent, who, after a few seconds of struggle, took it eagerly.
“I am already going to expend the next week at the edge of a nerve wreck waiting for my phone to ring and wondering what it means every second that it does not. I am not a cold genious like you, Sherlock. Most of us, aren’t”
The one on the left was crying his eyes out, barely even looking at the camera, crouched as low as the ropes would allow it.
He had been so careless. Shouting around ‘he’s alive’ like that at his working space, when it was the most probable place for the killer to be lurking, waiting for his reaction.
This last bit of information finally seemed to produce a reaction on Sherlock. He blinked and shook a bit his head and then he asked
Mycroft was so shocked by this outburst he just carefully wiped out a drop of saliva from his face ad listened to whatever Greg had to say.
“I am not going to use my contacts to take an infant from her family, so that you can have a new toy!”
“Of course. I… just hope there is still space in your… routine, for me. Even if you, perhaps, just need help with the child?”
The co pilot of the flying machine descrived the situation: someone got off the co-pilot's place, went to the back of the truck and got five hostages out.
Sherlock was not made of stone, as much as he had evolved into apearing so. He didn’t know it, but he wanted to run, and break into werever the baby was, and wrap her tight into his coat, against his chest, and run and run and shield her from the danger that was there and take her back to her dad… John.
“Even if he is feeling a bit unsure of taking you back in so soon, don’t worry, I’ll talk him into it… don’t tell him I said that. How could you?”
Of course he would want to! It's just that… she had been told of his drastic reaction (he didn't even make it back to the crime scene before they removed the body) and, being already an impresive one, what to expect when he was on drugs?
Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore. He crouched behind driver’s seat and pulled out a bit of cocaine. It was just a bit but he needed it like water on the desert. He even wished it was a syngerine…
“I know John’s alive… but I can’t help to think of him being dead, with all the burial and his dead face again and again and with Sherlock behaving like this…!”
Things like that and the scratch on the knucles were clues to consider… but not defnitive. The DNA test was”
She stood a moment in shock at Sherlock snapping at her. He just rolled his eyes and uncovered a bit more in order to access John’s hand.
He wanted that. He wanted to be with John and tell him what a crazy week it wad been. And how sorry he was for the stupid salad…
That was John. He had been kidnapped, beaten, held in poor conditions, his face copied to those of diying victims… and he still would fight, and he would still sit calm, and glare at him throu a camera, and try to send a message.
The dog next to him barked and tried to advance. Its handler held it firmly by the collar, front paws scratching the air.
They persecuted him like flys to shit, and for once he did not mind: he had the theory that the murder may be involved with the press, and whatever people may say of them, it was not as important as John's life.
“I worked for him. I learned of him as much as my average mind was capable of. He was the new step for humanity. Supirior. Necesary in this world. And you…”
And while doing so he had to ignore an abalanch of texts and missed calls from reporters who wanted to question him and fans who offered themselves for taking John’s bacant as his blogger.
She didn’t smell like John anymore… but that was only logical, why was it so upsetting? John himself didn’t smell anymore like…
Molly saw him come in like it was some short of reborn war hero, and sheepesly walked up to him. Sherlock was very patient (his still half-numb state helped) while she tried to find words.
“Fuck the press. I haven’t given up on the child jet and!” Sherlock crouched over the table, closer to Mycroft’s face “I have proof that we need that body to take more proof from it. We have no dna, we need…”
After a while looking at John’s pale, still face, he looked around, not really taking any details in.
Doc pushed the panic bottom. A siren echoed throu the tunnels, and his mates started running. Doc run out the stairs and started the engine of the truck. The others oppened the door of the big room, and hearded the copies up the stairs like sheep. They were terrified and high and didn't even atempt to disobey.
“Yes, and even so, you seemed to be suspicious of the first body, but you did let them bury it. And you were fighting with Dog’s family over Dog’s family already, hum?”
Lestrade directed his men firm and passionate like it was the academy, and Sherlock let them follow him, once again, to the crime scene.
Sherlock insisted on participating in order to fasten the process, but he did not work there. The samples had to be sent to somewhere else, where they would be tested propperly (and painfully slowly) before the results would arrive.
“You were insistent, but you let us burry him before you got him back. It can not be stuborness, there must have been clues. How did you know? How could you possibly see past… the dead body, and the case, and all of the evidence…”
Soon they encountered one of the victims: he had Watson’s face, but an extranger’s expresion of terror.
Had someone called John’s sister? Someone probably should. Did John’s parents already know? And Rosie…
He had spent the last weeks in a small room, lying on a dirty matress, chained to the wall, when he was not chained to a chair for Doc to poke at his face and war scars.
“I don’t believe you. You have pretended to fail before, and every time you’ve come out on top. And you will not be less now that John's life is at stake”
“Becouse I can’t find the solution, and no matter what I do it just keeps getting worse. I’ve decided I can’t keep up with the stress and frustration nor can I do anything to remedy it… but find a distraction”
Sherlock turned for the door, the corpse meaning nothing to him anymore, as it was no longer John, but one more dead extranger that happened to look like him…
As fast as Sherlock steped into the mourge, Molly walked up to him in large, fast, firm steps and slaped him across the face.
On his way he walked past Harry. She had been watching and there was a silent discussion there: who would keep Rosie?
It was him. Still, paler than ever. Same clothes he left with, a large pool of half dried blood spilled from what seemed like a shot to his chest.
He looked around, and after a moment of considering, grasped the coffee table and smashed it violently against the floor, and then threw it away.
He was sleeping when the siren started and one of his captors entered the room on a hurry. Any tiny failure on their plan could earn him time or clues for Sherlock, so withou thinking, he impused resistance: when the other crouched down to uncuff him, he kicked him on the face.
Molly puffed like a horse and rolled her eyes but concentrated on her job, willing to get over with it and have John’s already rotting carcass off her working space.
“But why the other murders?” Sherlock intentionaly ignored the dialoge over the baby, as he didn’t want Rosie into any of this
Lestrade didn’t know if he was having a nerve atack or just about to, but his face hurt, he was confused, he felt a preassure on his chest and he had just lied to the agent who had come with him.
Sherlock could read so many details off him: the probable self-defense wounds on his hands and use of soft drugs to make him easier to handle, a fresh hit to the head that had produced a small cut, and a houndred other tiny details that spelled lack of propper conditions such as hygiene and nourishment. Together with daily dosis of severe stress.
He pointed it up to the face of the young man, managing a second of stiff peace. Then, with a shift motion, used it to push him unceremoniously towards the door, where the girl still made a last attempt at recording something.
Sherlock stopped typing and looked at his eyes. Behind him, still on the door, Mrs Hudson made a gasping sound.
If the results were positive, then… he would have to acept John’s death. If they weren’t possitive… then he wouldn’t need this anymore.
Sherlock was already on his way. The driver got a phone call, noded, changed course and passed the phone to Sherlock.
The day after is when he broke into the mourge showering Molly with his aura of ‘I own this place give me what I want’
It had on similar clothes to those John had when he was missing, and which had been found on the fake John.
Sherlock knew it was highly unlikely that he could be with his sister or any of his exes, so he checked his blog before his next move.
John crossed his arms and changed weight from one foot to the other, like he was holding back something and breathed deep. He did not answer.
And so the searching party divided: one agent and his dog backed up by two officers went in each direction, scept the one heading up and front, as it seemed to be the stronger scented track, and most likely to include their criminal, it was follow by two dogs, with theyr workers, sherlock side by side and Lestrade and the rest of the team falling a bit behind, perhaps due to the dificult landscape, or the many donuts.
“You must have an opinion or you wouldn’t have ended up fighting now… why do you think he did that?”
Lestrade called the next morning, early. Sherlock waited patiently for half a second and interrupted his silence.
The rest of the flat was more of a mess than usual, too… but Mycroft’s eyes went directly to the box of syringes in the coffee table.
“John managed to blow your little game, but who Moriarty wanted was always me. Its me who he shot his brilliant brains out for”
Soon, Sherlock noticed he had run out of work to do here, and he was just making excuses. He wanted to be there. He was ansious for the results…
It had taken a whole lot to deal with an addict, difficult brother just to have a decent relationship with him, let alone get him clean. Now he was back in there…
This time, however, we already know the trick so the details are not so important anymore. …They just do this to see our reaction. Like telling you you can not eat sugar, and then hanging candy on your face”
He folded the paper as much as he could and stuck it behind the WC. Then, pushed the ledder, got out, and took his phone.
“No!” She had to insist in order to interrupt him “No, there was nothing, it was just a stupid swap”
John argued with him, he left home. Got a Cab. The driver knew him (or Sherlock, or worked for someone) and was smoking and… no. It didn’t smell like that. or yes?
As a character and story creator and all in all writer, I consider these two a "thing" If you'd like to call it so even if it is just in my headcanon.
He got home with his hyperactive brain on hiatus: it was like one of those days traffic collapsed roads.
“…But John… somehow, did it. He did it again and again, no matter how far Sherlock went or what he did, John just… followed. He knew exactly what to say, and when he didn’t know he would just… trust him. How did he do it?”
There was Mrs. Hudson, of course, and Mike, who seemed to feel a pang of regret for something… and Little Rosie, on someone’s arms… Lestrad, and even Sally, and John’s sister, who had been late, and looked more or less like him.
“…I can not know for sure. I suspect that it is not, but that could be infundated by my personal wish”
Sherlock demanded silence with a hiss, and concentrated on the pages: ripped them off, extendd them on the table in order, and worked on the possible meanings of the messyly delivered letters. It was easy, really.
“Look at the bright side” Said John when dividing the kitchen and installing a baby door, at one point when Sherlock seemed in panic.
Hours later, when he started noticing his absence, Sherlock realized he had been distracted up to ungodly hours in the night…
He wanted to shut the entire world down like it was a light and walk out the room, close the door, and forget it all, but instead he shook his head and muttered
He breathed deeply again, and his breath came out shaggy… and he decided he needed a drink. So he stopped at the closest place and ordered something…
He was babbling so much Sherlock couldn’t help but to walk up to him, slap him across that fake face of his and shout at him.
Then, out of nowere, Mrs. Hudson was there. She said some reasuring words he did not understand, and Sherlock just let her guide him throu his nightmares and pay the poor driver.
Sherlock breathed deeply. The chances that this was not John but jet another fake one rose and trembled like in a wicked game of bets.
The kidnappers of John and the other victims, and killers of some of them don’t deserve much mentioning, but for the satisfaction of the reader it will be stated that John and the other survivors made very easy their identification.
Perhaps Mycroft was right. He did care for the kid. He had bonded with her, but the main reason he wanted her was she was John’s.
“They are all negative. We have check and double check and even the dental test… is all negative. All wrong… that man, as much as he looks like him, is not John Watson”
The one on the right was still. Docile, in a terrified bunny kind of way, and looked at the camera like hoping something good could possibly come out of it.
It was a phone ringing. His phone. He preferred texting, but given his state he just crawled a bit and palmed the floor for it.
But he still did in one condition: he would visit Rosi every day in hopes that she would get used to him and not make a fuss when she was finally translated.
It had John's face, and was wearing similar clothes, but as soon as they were removed there was no doubth.
“Sherlock, you can not automatically involve me. There is a high chance that the poor doctor finally lost his patience”
“I can not use my contacts to give you a child that is not yours AND take from the grave her father’s body, which was buried just today!” Mycroft breathed deeply “Sherlock. All the press is behind you…”
“I have reasons to believe your father happened to be an old-fashioned, very exigent man, situation in wich influences your sister, who is not only alchoolic, but lesbian”
“why were you so dessperate to seek a reaction on me? So many murders so close one after the other each one so obvious, each one diferent, why? Why you want my desspair?”
Sherlock fell to his knees, hands right to his neck… cold, stiff flesh and no breathing, nor heartbeat.
Mrs. Watson was, oh so slowly fighting depression. She was a strong lady, but she was also old. Still, she had to stay strong for her granddaughter.
“Oh but what’s the diference? You want him right? There may be many other like him but you want this one”
Sherlock would listen no more. He was restless and demanding as only he would get the entire two minutes that the police took to set into action a small team of General Purpose malinose dogs wich inmediatly got the scent and run up the hill with the whole team runing close behind.
“I may be annoying but you, fat prick have cameras all around my street. You tell me where’s John or I will tell Mommy”
He wanted to be closer to her. He really did. No idea why. Maybe it was the fact that she reminded him of a happier time in his life? Or the fact that she was John’s and he was the only one who could really tell her of him…?
“The difficult and exigent situation within your family, specially in your jouth must have been quite the pressure, and it explains you being protective of your family and at the time resentfull, understanding and still shy and many, many facets of your personality and little gestures that show a typical…”
John stopped and read the message.  He stood still so long, Sherlock felt certain he probably couldn’t even see the words.
John sighed, at this point the mask was off, he knew what was happening, and things were about to get worse.  “Two days after I spoke with the General, Moran had returned from whatever god forsaken stretch of desert he had been monitoring.  He debriefed the superiors, as was to be expected.  Told them about a possible insurgent uprising in Kandahar.  That night was the night of the poisoning. Five days later, we were deployed to the Kandahar Skirmish, and I was shot.  I never saw my assailant, Sherlock.  No one did.”
.”  John shook his head.  “It always surprised me, each new case provided by that man.  I wondered how he lasted as long as he did.  There’s something more to this, more to him.”
A pair a swift heavy footfalls were approaching, Sherlock abruptly ended his deductions to sneer at the sound, accompanied by the tap of something that was not a cane.
John awoke, his vision blurry, and his head pounding.  The familiar antiseptic smell surrounding him led him to believe he was in the hospital, but he didn’t know why.  “Sherl’k?” his throat and mouth were painfully dry.  He attempted to focus, looking around the small room.
He wasn’t going anywhere in particular.  Just meandering.  He stopped occasionally and stared blankly into a window display for few minutes before carrying on.
, is not a danger to himself.  He had a bad moment.  He’s perfectly capable of controlling himself!”
John Watson walked quietly through Hyde park.  The sun peeking out from behind the clouds warmed the air slightly.
After a few moments of waiting, and listening to Sherlock, he realized that he must be composing.  The music started slow, quiet, almost morose, before swelling into something exciting and dark.  The last few notes held some kind of unexplained emotion, but without more to go on, John really couldn’t tell.
“Dammit, John.”  He muttered, his arms were growing tired, he was short of breath himself from the effort.  The moment the paramedics entered the flat, two of them took over.  One held a ventilation mask over John’s now pallid face as the other continued compressions in Sherlock’s place.  The third was asking question after stupid question to Mrs. Hudson who looked like she was ready to cry.
“I don't appear to be trying to hurt myself now.  I would suggest, as a professional, that maybe tying down a patient with PTSD when they don’t know where they are, might not be the best of ideas. Not if your intention is to keep them calm.”
“Enough, she wasn’t here.”  Sherlock protested.  He gently led Mrs. Hudson to the kitchen table and offered her a glass of water.
“He was a marksman.  What reason would a sniper have to resort to something as petty as poison?”  Sherlock’s voice rang out, loud enough to be heard over his violin.  It was clear from his tone that he found the matter to be entirely ridiculous.
“Of course she is!” Sherlock yelled.  “Look at her, you think the average neighbor would be this distressed?  No!  She’s his mother, and I’m his…”  There was nothing Sherlock could say.  There was no way he could be related by blood, they were far too different physically.  Just being a flat-mate would get him nowhere.  Though he was loathe to do so, he finished.  “I’m his partner.”
“I think sometimes, Sherlock, I need to be pushed.  If I hadn’t gone walking, I wouldn’t have realized how well and truly knackered I am.”
He glanced around, moving his head in slow increments, trying not to cause anymore stress on his throbbing head.  There was a call button, but it was out of reach.  He couldn’t even move his arms.  Upon closer inspection, John noticed his wrists were held in place by restraints.  Fear was beginning to creep throughout his body.  Why was he being held down?  Where was Sherlock?  Why was his head pounding?
Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off John, and either didn’t hear, or didn’t deign to respond to Anderson’s stupidity.
“It’s not like you could just administer a blanket anti-venom, John.  I’m sure you did everything you could.”
Doctors at the A&E declared the Acute Onset Panic Disorder, not uncommon to PTSD patients.  The severity of the attack was such that John had clawed holes through his jumper and shirt, and right into the skin of his throat and chest.  The words involuntary psychiatric hold were bandied about, while Sherlock argued, and Mrs. Hudson cried, tightly grasping the hand of a heavily sedated John.
“He isn’t exactly a man of principal, Sherlock.  I had a patient come in to the infirmary with a cracked skull, courtesy of Moran’s
“Archer told him…” he gasped, grasping and tugging at the neckline of his jumper as if it was strangling him.
“It appears Lacey, Stan and Sarah, the other woman were all siblings.  The third man was Alfred Moore.  It appears he also served same time and company and you, Stan, and Moran.”
Sherlock was watching John carefully. At face value, he appeared to be calm, discussing the deaths of fellow soldiers, men he knew, as if it was just another day at the office.  He quickly hid any evidence that would betray the mask he donned.  Lestrade hadn’t caught on, nor had any of the others.  Sherlock was well practiced with the art of hiding behind a mask, and instantly recognized the signs.
“You have your skull beat in, a doctor can plate it.  You have holes in your face, a doctor can suture them.  You get an infection, a doctor can prescribe antibiotics.”
“You’re correct again, Doctor Watson.  Sebastian Moran is a known associate of vast criminal circuit.  He’s been in contact with certain members, not to be named.”
He glared crossly at his flatmate before ripping his arm out of Sherlock’s grip.  “Because it happens, Sherlock.  It’s a problem, and I can handle it.  Now go back to your crime scene, I’m going home.”
His love and adoration for Mrs. Hudson could not be matched.  She was the only person allowed to touch Sherlock, but more than that, Sherlock touched her. He often swept her into ecstatic hugs, kissed her cheeks, or draped a lanky arm around her shoulders.  There was no doubt in his action or his eyes. This woman was protected by Sherlock Holmes.  And god help anyone who would dare harm her.
“We have not directly discussed your sleeping patterns, John, and if you’ll forgive my belligerence, you’re not handling it either.”
John balked.  Moran had more or less been the top of the list.  He was known as an expert marksman, but shared no compassion for his fellow servicemen.  He’d been the cause for more sutures than most insurgent attacks during John’s time.
“Doctor John Watson is fairly recently returned from service in Afghanistan, he suffers from PTSD and frequent anxiety attacks.”  It seemed important that this idiot know that John was not just
The door inched open slowly and a pretty young woman with red hair entered to room.  “Everything is fine Mr. Watson, You’re at St. Bartholomew’s in the psychiatric department.”
“No, Sherlock - this time we have to do it by the book.  Especially if we’re involving your brother.  This could be very bad news for everyone, especially the Army.  One slight miscalculation could be very very bad.”
“It’s not like she doesn’t live for moonlighting.  Give her the bodies, she could tell more in one look than Anderson did all night.”
“I understand your concern Mr. Holmes, but Mr. Watson is presently a danger to himself.  It it his his best interest that we place him on involuntary hold.”
After two months living at 221B, John’s physical pain only flared up in the morning, and after the odd take down of a suspect.  It wasn’t anything his couldn’t handle with a couple paracetemol.
John was shaking.  The nightmares hadn’t been as bad as he expected, but he’d still only had a few hours of sleep.  Sherlock was in the sitting room, playing the violin as softly as was possible.  John lay on back and listened.
He had seemed to know everything about John from the moment he looked up from the microscope.  “Afghanistan or Iraq.”
“What happened?”  Sherlock asked “Based on your reaction, and diagnosis, I’m guessing you saw something similar in Afghanistan.”
The wind had picked up that night, causing the house to creak and groan around them.  John had been laying in bed, fighting the urge to fall asleep, listening to the sounds outside his room.  Sherlock was lurking below, John heard the sounds of glass slides clicking into the microscope, a whirring noise he couldn’t identify, and the occasional mumble.
John’s eye’s widened.  “Sherlock, if these cases are connected, then there’s a \ soldier out there killing his own.”
Sherlock.”  John said calmly.  He had no more desire to speak to Mycroft than Sherlock at this point.
The rest of the day and been a fast whirl of strange and unexpected coincidences.  Meeting Mike Stamford, as he raced as quickly as he could for a cuppa.
“Private Stan Mitchell.  He was new to the company, young.  Hadn’t quite gotten over the hero complex that the young ones have when they’re first deployed.”
John shrugged and made his way to the kitchen, he filled and turned on the kettle, still listening the the strains of music from the sitting room.  Knowing better, but not caring, he pulled two cups from the cupboard, before seeking out the latest hiding spot for the tea.
ability to make tea that you’ll drink before it gets cold.”  John nodded to the cup on the table, changing the subject.
There are lots of pages in my notebook ready to be typed up and edited, I've got myself a little help-mate for one scene, but this brings me to my bad news. I know I promised some Molstrade, but I think it's going to have to wait for the next fic, which is already swimming around my brain.
“Had a neighbor with an old Ford that would idle and backfire right outside my house when I came home.”  The older man stretched out a weathered hand, John grabbed his cane, and between the two of them, he managed to get up off the ground.  “As I said son, it’ll get better.”  He smiled kindly and walked away with a small salute and a wave.
He pulled out the phone Harry had given him when he got home and called Ella’s office.  He was already late, to sit and not talk to her.  “Dr. Thompson’s Office.”  said a sweet voice on the other end.
Moriarty paid him, to kill those four people.  Had he succeeded in killing Sherlock that night, I think he would have been set.”  John was wringing his fingers.
“I’ll take that as a yes.  Three months ago Moran was court-marshaled for behavior unfitting of an officer in Her Majesty’s Royal Army, after an argument broke out regarding
He was so obstinately unobservant, that Sherlock felt certain John wouldn’t notice him even if he yelled his name.
Four teenage boys with skateboards rushed around him, calling one another names and giving John himself a rather scathing look for daring walk on the sidewalk.  One boy’s front wheel caught a stone and threw him.  A tumultuous crack resounded as the skate flew out and hit the ground.  Before, John would have run to check the boy, make sure nothing was broken, suggested the A&E, but this instinct was sorely dulled by the sudden rise in his heart rate, he began to have trouble breathing, the hand on his cane was gripped so tight, he had begun to lose feeling in his fingers.
Also please lend a hand to those in need for a small price, and get to know one of the single most amazing people who ever graced my life.
“Ah, is that his name?  We don’t know much, to be honest.  The cabby, Geoff Hope.  He mentioned the name Moriarty.  Stating that he was Sherlock’s
Sherlock looked up to praise John’s deduction, and saw that he was tugging at the bottom of his coat almost obsessively, his brow furrowed, and his breathing  rapid and uneven.
“Two men, two soldiers.  Came into the infirmary, screaming like they’d lost their legs. No injury, no puncture wounds, but their blood was coagulating at a rapid pace.  We didn’t have the necessary equipment to find what venom was affecting them, we couldn’t find a single creature near or in the barracks.  By half three in the morning both men were dead.  I did nothing.”
John lost consciousness shortly before the ambulance arrived.  Sherlock had yelled for Mrs. Hudson to let Emergency Services in, he struggled with chest compressions, trying to keep oxygen flowing.
This wasn’t Sherlock.  Sherlock would tell him to stop being an idiot, of course he could have sent samples off to a local siege hospital for testing.
“Colonel Sebastian Moran, we served in the same company.  Not exactly the most even tempered, bit of a psychopath.  Marksman.  Considered an asset to some, a danger to others.  If he didn’t like the way you looked at a smudge on his shoes and he’d have you in infirmary faster than you could blink.”  John’s left hand had begun to shake, he quickly hid it in the pocket of his coat.
“Take Mrs. Hudson home.  I’m going to the morgue.”  Sherlock ripped his shoulder from his brother’s hand, gently kissed Mrs. Hudson’s cheek and stalked off.”
“No wounds, no puncture marks, toxins congealing blood and tissue.  The only way that venom could have entered the bodies what for them to have digested it!  Four person dinner party, take out in the kitchen…”
“Yes, he would have had to.  Too many components in this case.  Someone would have had to incapacitate that one, “ Sherlock gestured to the asphyxiated woman, “and tied up those two, while the other fought the solider.”
He knew Sherlock liked to tell people he was a sociopath, but John knew better.  There were small things that only those who spent time with him could see.  His concern for his friends’ well-being was never to be overlooked.  He wasn’t able to express it as concern, but it was that.
The house was small, but well kept.  Lestrade was waiting impatiently.  The front door, made of reinforced oak had a single bullet hole at eye level.  “The striations and burn marks on the wood suggest the gun was held directly against the surface. There appears to be small traces of metal within the burn pattern.  But to go through the entire door unimpeded… that’s a trick.”  Sherlock pulled his magnifier from his coat pocket. “Has forensics picked at this?”
“If it’s at all possible.  I have a short list of names.  Those whom I recall being a little less than brothers in arms, not really team players.”
Sherlock continued, rather annoyingly to play his violin and stare out the window, leaving it to John to fill Mycroft in on the happening with the venom, both cases.
“Wa’er?” He closed his eyes as the  fluorescent lights began to feel like they were burning holes through his brain.
Sherlock had mused that perhaps Moran’s escapades in Afghanistan had been a selling point for Moriarty.  Perhaps Moran was a new hit man like Geoff Hope.
“And the women?”  Lestrade was taking notes, a habit he had formed in the early days of working with Sherlock.
Sherlock’s keen eyes looked him over once, his mouth told him everything John already knew about himself.
“This is John Watson.  I have an appointment at three.  I’m going to have to go ahead and cancel it.”  Ella was a nice enough woman, and her staff was always painfully sympathetic, but John felt he wasn’t being helped with platitudes of “Things will get better.” and “How’s the blog?”
“Listen, Sherlock, believe me when I tell you, I’d rather listen to Molly Hooper than Anderson nine times out of ten, but it’s just not possible.  The MET needs to finish their crime scene analysis, before we can hand the bodies over for autopsy.  Then and only then can we give her the keys.”  Even over the loud speaker on Sherlock’s phone, John could tell that Greg was worn out, Sherlock’s continued arguments wouldn’t make much difference at this point.
The three boys still standing laughed and helped their mate up, his skateboard, well and truly totaled.  But none of this mattered to John, he was suddenly back in his own head, rushing to the side of a soldier hit in hail fire.
“Mr. Holmes, please.  This is not a matter up for discussion.  You can sit in the waiting area as long as you like, but unfortunately we cannot allow you in the ward.”  The doctor brushed his fingers through his graying hair.  His exasperation was pissing Sherlock off.
Sherlock’s eyes darted to John’s as he scoffed, loudly.  “Not a miracle John.  He had a good doctor, obviously. A good doctor and a fighting spirit will keep you alive seven times in ten.”
He stared at the scene in silent panic. In a moment, the man who had been holding the gun stopped strugling, lost his foot and fell backwards, slipping from the top of the rock and falling onto the bushes behing it, in front of the police ring, which hurried to close over him.
“…Im planing to retrieve Rosi. If that is okay with you. I will also have to discuss it with Mrs. Hudson, but, eh… she is my daughter and I am getting her back and that is not negotiable”
He found himself trapped in a kind of brain collapse, thinking again of the last things he said to him and the look of him in the cold, dirty, bloody…
She was one of the only persons who got to share her life with Sherlock Holmes, and knew that, actually, thou he may not look like it, thou he may rarely express them, he had feelings.
Said Molly. And Sally walked out of the place. She didn't have to say it: Sherlock was intelligent enough to know exactly what she was thinking.
Sherlock made a series of wrongly restrained expressions and then left, interrupting Lestrade’s next line.
“Mrs. Watson?” She looked at him. She recogniced him from the newspapers or tv, and John’s stories, but still, Sherlock behaved. If not, he wouldn’t get to hold Rosie.
Sherlock went throu the rest of the ceremony like an automat, and was going to leave without another word… but he saw Rosie.
He tried to distract himself with internet cases, then, run into the stupid press bitching still about John’s death, and why, and Sherlock’s involvement, and Sherlock’s moves…
Sherlock made that gesture with his head, like when he wondered why he was alone in a world of ignorants
It was somewhere in the caos of the flat. He had been trying to locate it since he was flashed by the bastard with the phone.
He needed a fix. He didn’t even make it to the cab: Just hid behind a tree and… and oh shit there was a papparazzi already hiding there.
Sherlock leaned in and held him in a tight embrace, like he needed to feel him breathing against his chest, and both stood like that for what could seem like hours, even if the would would wreck around them.
“No, no, he skinned them. He still compulsively caressed them when he was uncomfortable, before he left…”
John emited a quiet, breathy laught and Sherlock guessed he had not been the only one repeating those words within his head.
‘Let’s put Rosie and the murder at the same level of concern, just not to offend John’ he thoug. You know, propperly.
“What do you mean miscalculation? You don’t miscalculate dna, you read it. Did you read it wrong? What could possibly go wrong?”
He opened his mouth, but he could say nothing as Greg’s shoulders combulsed and he fought to breath in strangled ghasps, as silently as possible, rivers flowing from his eyes and dripping off his chin.
It was his subconscious, always working mind, or just coincidence, that it went through the glass of the window, and into the street.
Imagine that a pair of birds nested near your window and you got to see them come and go as the chicks grow. Or that a mama cat had a litter under your house, and you got to feed them and see the cute kittens come and go and play…
He bought a shovel, and a stone drill, together with working googles, and he… put it in a bag, and went for a coffee, to make some time before nightfall, when the graveyard would be desolate.
So he expent that day at home, high, looking throu possible misteries he didn’t plan to solve becouse he was just distracting his brain from what was really cooking in there.
And five minutes later, greg Lestrade got back to his car limping a bit and holding his brushied chin, with a broken lip and a black eye.
He did look at John’s face. It was him. No possible way out. Sherlock let go of his hand, what somehow took him a large effort, thou not as much as to walk away.
“How dare you” She spilled at him with poison on her voice “How dare you not only to come back here, but do it with…it”
There was nothing he could do. The time of death had been probably hours ago. And even if he solved this murder…
When shouting around “he is alive” after the results had come, Lestrade had nearly crashed into Sherlock on purpose. He tripped over his words apologizing and thanking him and asking what to do in order to find John, and fiery assured him he was at his service.
…more precisely, a certain someone, whoever was responsible for taking John from them, and not content with that, killing someone else to give them as a joke.
Wait. Fuck perhaps. Sherlock’s brain overloaded. The walls of his mind castle vibrated with the sound of a fire alarm aparently instaled by John without his consentiment.
And John would shout at him like wenever he lost his patience, and tell him to “get me out of here you idiot so I can type in my sodding stupid blog and give me my baby!” and sherlock would try, but could not see John. John was gone and even if he was not, Sherlock did not have the baby, and he was alone.
It was an old woman. Mrs. Watson, aparently. Widow. Unconfortable with the baby, but with a firm wrip. She didn’t think she should be doing this, but was determined to take care of her gradchild…
Sherlock had no idea where to go nor what to do to calm his rage, and he was not used to confusion… so he went home, and locked himself away…
I was starting to look rather disgusting. His fluids were starting to dry and his flesh was turning flat agains’t his skull bones, eyes sunk deeper into it, skin less and less livid…
All in all, Rosie had been away for a few moths… and infants grow really fast. She was now close to one year old, with longer, blonde locks and considerably larger...
She gestured as to hit again, and this time Sherlock backed off, but not far enough to get out the door.
“Uh… yes!” he snifed a bit “Just… dizzy… don’t stop driving, just get me home… no wait, wait! To the new scotland yards building…”
“The murderer is a prankster. He prepares a little play for us to react to. For me, specially. He wants to see us dessperate in public, the news, the papers… by not reacting to his little show, I made him starve” Sherlock stopped in front of the screen while someone put the thing on.
Sherlock’s brain reminded him of how wonderfull, how usefull a dose of cocaine would be now, to celebrate (what?) or just to work better throu the case… but he didn’t really need it. He knew were to go now, and he felt high already.
The truk kept on, and the co-pilot walked into the woods with his hostages. The pilot of the helicopter didn't know what to do.
Having it removed, and lying on the ground in front of them, Lestrade nervously clenched and unclenched his fists, looking at the dead and Sherlock one at a time.
He shook this thoughts away, for later. Had to think fast. Had to be strong. Got to get the naloxone... And somehow give it to Sherlock
“He was not drudged, nor did he try to defend himself. Maybe he was talking to the aggressor, thinking he could… maybe the shot was accidental…”
But annoying was not the proper world: it was upsetting, terrifying, disgusting, unnerving, infuriating…
Mrs. Hudson didn’t bother him when he rushed to lock himself in and did not come out. She found out thanks to Lestrade, who was having his own hard time.
“You… you are smart, aren’t you? I am no doctor but I know, you know… you can not be healthy without friends”
“inspector Lestrade. You are responsible of the case. You have always responded for My brother’s implication on your work. Tell me is there something that… could’ve got him… upset or whatnot?”
And it took him mere seconds to notice the only thing odd was the way John was moving his head. And it seemed herratic, but it was not. It had purpose.
It had been fascinating and adorable, seeing this two boys fitting so well together and going and coming and …
“Your father is alive, Rosie, well, that’s my deduction. And I barely am wrong. I’m going to find him, and you’ll live with him again very soon, I promise”
It may have seemed casual nerviousness to the captor or anyone else, but John was looking straight to the camera, to Sherlock.
“You are high and depressed and mourning and so you see imaginary clues everywere even thou you’ve seen and touched his corpse!”
Mycroft checked his watch while the other let flow all of the situation thoug his ragged breath, until Greg noticed this was not helping or whatever.
“…John I am not the most social person. I barely understand some… things. Things just happen and keep happening and I ignore them and just enjoy them. I…”
From the moment his mother came in, he wouldn’t stop paying attention to the infant, holding her, complaining with horror for how fast she’d grown, trying to make her react, wondering how far did she remember him…
“Oh, no I can not know for sure but basing myself on the percentage the posibilities offer I am deducing the real John is probably alive! He is alive!”
Sherlock had lifted one hand. He seemed paniqued at the sight of John, alive, on camera. And another one, and another one, and a third one, plus a fourth.
Sally jumped to his side with a small notebook and a pen. He ripped them off her hands with the ferocity of a rabid dog and without noticing her and demanded
Whenver asked about it, he would remind them that he worked and lived with Sherlock Holmes. “Plus, I got a blog” (He firmly refused to descrive too much of his traumatic expirience, thou)
“The first months, and the first years of a persons life are crucial for cominication and social skills. Even from the womb, they recognice voices. So, even if you expent a long time without her, she must still have something of you in her, after the important, also long time you spent with her”
Back in Sherlock’s head, there was loud ringing, like another fire alarm set on his mind-castle, so strong that it made the walls tremble and his tympani bleed, the certain knolege that he was alive.
But he owned this place. More than ever, like it was his house. In a swift motion, he uncovered John’s head.
Sherlock snickered, and they both laughted it off akwardly on the back of the car. It was oddly familiar.
“You… you just… you can’t leave John and the rest of us rest in peace? I was on vacation for this! And the day I come back, that day you…!”
At the feet of the rock, the police team struggled to form a circle not too wide around the spot. The injured dog’s handler explained the situation and Lestrade panicked, looking around for a solution.
“You may not want to recognice it becouse you are used to the closet or you trully fooled yourself into not recognicing it but you did”
His body ached for food and water, but his brain and nervious sistem claimed chemical substances. He held it all down in an atempt to keep it together. He did believe the best was to eat something… but he doubted his stomach could keep it down.
“… they are playing with us. The first time, they wanted to fool us: see how we would act, with a dead John on our hands. But, probably, without really killing the real one…
But Sherlock knew what he meant: he said it in a comical tone and he was smirking. He had killed John!
After, Sherlock was in a similar state of shock to the time John had asked him to be his best man. But with his mouth a bit open. John suspected it could all end up in another fight.
He left him a text, and waited, and distracted himself looking for possible cases on the internet, and checked the phone…
Was this all worth it? Should he forget John like he had never been there and cope with the loneliness? Should he stop investigating alltogether? Shall he let go of Rosie at all or just visit her from time to time?
John shook his head, and deliveratly invaded Sherlock’s personal space, to hold his face firmly and kiss him fully on the lips. Well, kiss is a way to call it. It was not very romantic nor charming. It lacked the litlest bit of erotism and it was still and forcefull.
“Then just eat another donut and forget I am here and what I got on that lab and If turns out John’s alive I will just call you”
"The first corpse was so carefully copied that we didn't distinguish them. The second and the third one no longer had John's war scar, but still looked very much alike, clothes and all. This one has less care on the clothes... And keeps her breasts. They didn't even hold them, they just let the clothes cover them..."
Sherlock walked quite fast (the way he always does) out the door and only remembered to say “Thank you Mycroft” While closing it. His brother noticed that he had said it nonetheless.
He felt like he had not much air left, and he looked at the faces in front of him… but it was just a second. He could not hold much longer and he just scatered between the others, gibing an end to his speech.
Rosie’s grandmother saw this and nodded, passing the child to him. And Sherlock truly had to readjust his balance.
When it was time for Mrs. Watson to leave, he refused to let her part with the baby, and it was needed a lot of resoning to get him to.
Sherlock followed a close by path, (the closest variation of scenery) and, up not too far, there was an abandoned building.
“Sherlock. I want to believe you. I really do. I… believe on you, as your work is brilliant… but… I can not… I can’t do this. Is upirior to my forces”
Sherlock stood tall, and stumbled. Just centimeters from his shoes lay the lifeless body of John Watson.
Sherlock didn’t say a word. He walked up to him and snatched it right off its owner’s hands. The paparazzi tried to complain, but Sherlock was taller. And claimed to have it confiscated.
He could take one last shot, just to go throu the wait, for the results that would either put his life back together, or crash the reminding pieces.
“Is it your sister? She wrestled me over the baby’s custody, she may have had plans to fix her problem in other to take her in in the future”
Sherlock barely spent any time at home during the days before the burial. He spent this time continously runing back and forth to the crime scene, and the place where the cab was kept and the mourge, collecting possible pieces of information, asking questions and blaming the whole of humanity for being useless and pitifull.
Sherlock wondered how much awake and capable she was now. It would be interesting (perhaps even fun!) to make a couple of tests with her... And, did she really remembered him or he just seemed familiar to her, and so, she liked his face, and the sound of his voice.
This was the afternoon on the same day the results arrived. Sherlock had wanted to make good use of time after wasting half the day asleep.
He run up to John, helped him into a kneeling position a bit away from the edge, and firmly ripped the gag of his mouth.
There was an odd silence, in wich it was balanced if what he had just said was more reassuring or not. Oh well.
“What was I supposed to do? Wait, arms crossed for nothing to happen? Drug myself to unconsciousness? I need that dni!”
John was dead and he needed a fix and John was dead and he had to know what happened because there was smoke and alcohol but why and the knuckles and his brother and he needed a fix and he had to fix this already but even if he did john was dead…
Sherlock didn’t mind. He kissed the little hand and then held her closer. Breathed deeply throu his nose.
He knew it was not her, It was the entire world, the sounds of the street, the light dropping from the sun on him and the mere presence of humanity
Sherlock thoug of a way out. He had to buy time. He had to keep him speaking. Maybe beg for John’s life? No, that could make a sudden shot so satisfactory…
“Drive!!” He shouted, and he must have startled the driver becouse he made a sharp turn, nearly scratching the car parked in front.
He had been holding it for a while without noticing and he was no longer capable. One tear managed to scape his tightly closed eyes and now an army of traitors run down his cheeks. He was silently, ovbiously, crying.
“What if John is not resting in peace? What if he is somewere, locked away, tormented, and we could be looking for him instead of… mourning?”
He stood in the spot. And he could visualize clear as day, John Watson standing next to him… giving him one of his looks.
“You did loose time with her, but it is more important the upbringing. Even if Rosie was an adopted child you had never met before, you plan on raising her and from now on she would still be your child”
“I am no longer working in that case… and I doon’t care how many more dead John’s you find, nor how did they die”
Mycroft looked around unconfortable and thoug of his possibilities… what to do with a crying man? …he decided the easiest thing to do was to hand over a hadechief.
He couldn’t take much bedsides the detail that he had a high level of vanity and was probably obsesive-compulsive, or just very obsesive and very compulsive all throug his daily routine.
In between them, Lestrade nerviously looked back and forth from Sherlock, to the new corpse, on the table.
“…closet case. I am just shocked that you finally came out ot me. Thou I knew some kind of shock would be necessary in orther to break the cicle”
Like a couple arguing across the table with mere glares. Like they were playing a game of guess and Watson was saying ‘you better don’t fuck this up like you did with my salad’ without words.
“That is, what you think about it, and if I should put some distance and leave with my daughter and maybe… keep working together in a… strictly proffesional way?”
“…When john asked me to give a speech on his wedding, I was…well, quite lost. I had no idea how to do it and even thou I tried for days I still messed it up somehow…
Her world had become unbalanced, between depressing silence and confusing emptiness, and the chaos of a new baby to care for…
'The press is out of control. How many corpses do you have? People tend to pánic over things like this. Keep me informed'
Lestrade took a second to react, but he pushed down whatever he was munching with one last glup of coffee and he ran past Molly demanding
“The clothes are not the same, thou similar to the ones on the first one. Actually they seem to be new. Also, the first time, the body was left somewhere it would take time for us to find it. But this is the opposite: the killers (it has to be more than one, probably a small, very dedicated group) they took a great risk just so that we would have it on our faces instantly. The killer had changed their course of action…”
(sight) “you see, I ah” John wringled his hands and just kept it going the way he usually did: akward, but firm “I have… I… -I love you. There’s no other word for it, not anymore. I’ve been for a long time now. And while I was in…”
From time to time he played the violín or conducted a couple little experiments. He exchanged many texts with Lestrade, and only one with Mycroft.
The phone stopped ringing in the time it took him to reach it. But he didn’t need to catch the call:
“Oh, I’m intelligent. My plan fooled brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes, and threw him into depresion! Dog here was kind of worried, even”
He breathed deeply, backened one step and then forwards, hands claping in front of his mouth, crouching down onto her.
He had his hands tied and was gagged, dressed in dirty clothes that looked even bigger size than his due to the fact that he was so much skinnier. There was dark shadows below his eyes but that hopefull, worried stare he was gibing Sherlock and only him was all so his, so familiar.
“Well, thats very true… I still feel like I lost some very important time with her, and I hope I can get it back”
“No. Mrs. Hudson is actually happy with the idea of babysitting and I have already planned experiments regarding the developement of an infant’s psique for the next two years”
“Yes. Yes I don’t know what is your plan, becouse I am not as smart as you but I know you care for him, even if you pretend you don’t. I know you will not let him die, like you left the six others to be picked up by my men”
Lestrade had barely managed to walk in, phone in hand, but not talking, his other hand to his mouth.
“John, I am terribly sorry for that time I made you believe I was dead, for now I am learning what a monstruosity it was. I am sorry. …And I wish… I could say it to your… face…”
But those were unprobable cases. His instinct, his entire brain vibrated with the name of John Watson.
Sherlock finished writing, and he repeated the video just to make sure he hadn’t miss anything. His flooding mind caught on every detail, again: John seemed underfed, filty, stressed. He had a bruise on the side of his face and marks on his hands.
He wouldn’t waist his trip: he got to the mourge. He coulnd’t see John there anymore… but his brain wanted to try.
He took his sweet time to, slowly, get up and onto his feet, and then took a shower, carefully, not to die in the atempt.
He trashed around the place, tried to concentrate. Made a proto-schelude for his next course of action regarding the events… and then tried to razonate about John’s case.
“Please, the poor man has had enough of…” Mrs. Hudson tried to put peace, but the girl reporter ignored her abruptly.
“…The… I, really…” Sherlock turned slightly, facing the coffin. And spoke openly, like in a dream, like John could hear him.
Suddenly, Dog stopped moving. He stood still, listening avobe the trees, over Doc's shouting, the helicopter.
Have you ever seen a human hung by the neck? His tongue hung of his mouth, and his neck was in quite an unnatural angle.
It was necesary three men and a syngerine to drag him up the stairs and into the truck with the others.
It was to no avail: it seemed like the thing ringed continously within his brain, and John was somewere in the flat shouting at him to behave like a normal man and pick it up…
In the middle of the room, just a few meters over there, there was something large lying on the floor.
Sherlock walked off, nearly run to the cab, being chased by the other making annoying questions. When he finally sat inside, he was flashed by the cameras. There were more paparazzis now. He didn't really care that much for the photos. This would just add to all the others he kept finding everyday, everywhere, specially since John had died, with quotes like "Detective too depressed to go back to work" Or "Detective's blogger vacant not up... why" and stupid theories as for why John had been killed...
Greg took it eagerly and wiped his face desperatly, to no avail. He kept dehidrating at a fast peace throu his eyes, and spoiling the handechief beyond posibility of Mycroft asking for it back. Ever.
“I am not high! For the first time in a long while, I’ve found a huge clue and a path to follow in this case, if you just gave me his… head”
Now this is more or less how Mrs. Hudson had felt when Sherlock, excentric and messy, like a big child had started living with her. And when John had moved in.
He did this while walking down stairs and texting Dimmock, who was in charge during Lestrade’s little vacations.
He retreated home were he stood still on his chair, looking at nothing, right in front of John's empty chair.
In the back seat of the cab, he managed his aching head, reduced to a trembling tight ball in a corner, and the driver asked him if he was allright.
He wondered if this is how John kept seeing Mary after her death, and he ignored the ghost of a memory caused by his high… and kept thinking of rational, propper things.
He took another cab, while texting Lestrade. The inspector wasted no time on leaving what he was doing to follow him to the exact place were the stolen cab had been found.
As he had it on his hand, and directed it to his veins… he had an idea. And it was stupid, but it was worth a try.
The video was on. And it was a few seconds of blank panic before anyone could understad what was on screen. What it all meant.
The expression he made when Sherlock had consumed all of his patience. Or when he could just jump to the face of the criminal who had particularily struck his nerves. Or when he was very concentrated on something that should be scary.
“Inspector Lestrade. When you went to see him, did you notice something… odd? …like…signals of possible… efects of drugs?”
Sherlock checked the phone again, and seeing the absence of texts he went for the closest possibilities:
At the very least, Sherlock made sure several samples would be taken just to double check… and ordered a dental check. For good measure.
Lestrade went still, and instinctively looked around, like the killer would be at plain sight. Sherlock walked away, already texting.
Sherlock held John’s hand on his, cold, non responsive… in search for possible clues of shelf defense attempt… and found something that called his attention even further.
