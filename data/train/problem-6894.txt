Tony threw the weapon at them, which did nothing to intimidate them, of course. Without paying any attention to the man he had shot, who was now lying face down in the snow, they grabbed Tony. No matter how much he kicked and thrashed, there was no getting out of this one.
Steve wasn’t completely on board with her having so much involvement but James had made it clear that Natalia wasn’t just invested because of how important Clint was to her but that she would also be a huge help. She had the physical skills to be useful as well as good connections.
Dugan turned the store's plate from ‘open’ to ‘closed’ and let down the door’s blinds. Pepper chuckled and greeted them in Gaelic. One look from Mr Rogers and Dugan opened the store again. Tony watched from where he was standing and greeted them.
“I wish we could make it into a safe place for others like us. If they don’t know where to go they can get in touch with someone there, whether it’s for a new home or to get out of town. I know James and you support others but Clint told me about his bar. Something like that but nearby.” He put the plates on one tray and the cups of tea on another, indicating for Steve to follow him to the living room.
He woke up with the wool blanket on him, a pillow under his head and the curtains closed. The fact that he managed to sleep through all that scared him more than he was willing to admit. Never before had he been a heavy sleeper and now he didn’t notice someone putting a pillow under his head? If he wasn’t careful he would lose all his survival instincts he had developed over the years.
If it hadn’t been for Steve holding him, Tony wouldn’t have been able to dance, let alone stand. He was so close to Steve, feeling his warmth, his breath tickling on his ear and neck. Maybe it was okay to dream a little dream. Enjoy the moment and allow himself to be excited about it. And maybe there was a reason why people loved to dance. Or maybe it was just the feeling he got from dancing with Steve.
Clint got ready to stand, brushing against Tony accidentally and he felt Tony’s hand tremble. He stopped and grabbed the hand, giving it a squeeze.
about implying that what happened was in any way your fault, Clint. Okay?” Clint nodded and James waited for verbal confirmation.
James had one arm wrapped around Clint’s middle, Clint’s back pressed against his chest and his head dropped onto his shoulder as he stared up at the night sky.
, I’m here.”
So he was in love. Apparently had been for some time. Just because he now had a name for what he had been feeling didn’t mean it would change anything. Nothing needed changing. Benni and he were in a good place. A place where he wanted to stay. Not only for the obvious selfish reasons—he didn’t have to run a store, run a household, take care of his brother, be scared of being beaten or insulted or steal money from his own register in order to run away—but also because he felt like he finally belonged somewhere. There was no way he was going to risk that for something as ridiculous as feelings.
“Excuse me, sir. I require immediate attention.” Tony kept his voice low so that only Steve would hear him.
Thank you so much to everyone for reading, leaving kudos, leaving comments and just being so loyal and sticking with us for the past 17 weeks. This has been such a blast to write and post and your feedback has really kept Redhead_Robin and I going! 💙
Tony considered that for a moment but he wasn’t convinced just yet. Rhodey could be pretty damn scary when he wanted to be.
if it’s worth knowing or important.” He managed to stay focused until he felt Steve’s lips on his forehead and damn him for knowing how nice it felt to Tony. “No, it’s acceptable.”
When the car pulled up in front of Delmonico’s, Clint felt his stomach churn nervously. He wasn’t even sure why. Honestly there were so many reasons but none of them really mattered when he thought about it. He wasn’t going in there as a gay man in a gay relationship. He was entering as a straight-passing man alongside his legal straight-passing wife. They had the rings to prove it.
Back at home and in a familiar setting he knew to be safe, Clint improved but only marginally. His mobility was extremely limited. For the most part, he used crutches. They were bulky and hard to get used to at first but he was getting the hang of them. Going up and down the stairs was his biggest issue. Thankfully, there was a bathroom on the ground floor but getting to bed every night and down in the morning was a feat usually done with a lot of swearing and self-deprecation.
Steve nodded, processing. He eyed the tea James had and then picked it up, bringing it up to his nose and inhaling. “Thought you said this was tea?”
There was still his paranoia that Clint wasn’t who he said he was but how else would he know about the coffee machine, James’ cooking, and Dugan and Dmitri?
Once inside, Tony took Maria’s favorite book off of the shelf and hugged it tightly. How he missed his mother. That night he dreamt of her and his sister smiling at him.
Clint nodded. He didn’t have time to hold grudges, especially not against people who would be in his life for the foreseeable future.
“Though maybe you’d be willing to go so far as
“And once you’re back from your vacation, we’ll work on that too, hm?” She smiled as she held onto him.
“I’m sorry I didn’t come visit. Every time I wanted to go outside, I froze.” He looked into the cup.
Steve kicked off his shoes and unbuttoned his shirt sleeves, rolling them up to his elbows as he climbed into the oversized hospital bed with Tony, pulling him onto his chest.
“Your mother was an impressive cook,” Sarah said and James’ smile remained on his face as he cut a slice for each plate Steve handed him.
“What’s going on, pet?”
“I thought it would be better for you two to stay together,” James said pointing to the bed.
“I am. Also a little nervous because I don’t know what I should be expecting.” He hinted once again that he wanted more information, but he didn’t really mean it. If there was one thing he was sure of, it was that Steve had planned everything and that they would be safe.
There he was. Looking tired and very stern. But there was Steve. Sarah spoke to him in Gaelic, pointing to the kitchen once but Steve shook his head. He looked right at Tony and Tony looked away for whatever reason.
“How so?”
“Ah, yes. But that’s business, pet. Don’t mistake that for who he is. He’s a good lad Jimmy,” she said. They continued to work in silence while Tony thought about the new information. The man who invited him into his home, gave Tony and his brother a home, the leader of the Irish mob, was friends with the leader of the Russian mob and Tony was standing in the kitchen drying the dishes after having a casual dinner with them.
“Love?” Steve said at the same time that James said, “Solnyshko?”
He stared at Steve, then at his hands and without thinking about it he reached one hand out to him.
“The Tiffany.”
try? Seeing as they were even weaker than before and, not to mention, injured, it seemed impossible to plan anything. And what were their options now that there were more guards who made sure to knock on their door every now and then to remind them that they were out there?
? And to a rival at that… Now, lad, I can’t just look the other way.” The kid was quivering under Cap’s grasp.
“There’s a tattoo on his wrist. A Japanese symbol.”
“You’re a natural,” Clint told him.
“Even if I’ve got nothing to offer? To give?” Why did he feel so out of breath? Why was his heart beating even faster? Why was he hoping so desperately that Steve would tell him he was wrong?
Clint followed him, Lucky at his heels, and James got him set up in his favorite seat at the table, made him another warm drink, and got started on a nice, filling comfort meal. He decided to make Clint’s favorite—just baked chicken and mashed potatoes with a mushroom cream sauce, some vegetables on the side and another homemade bread Sarah had dropped off yesterday.
“Yes but his hair is black and I used up my black crayon drawing night time,” he said in the most adult way those words could be said and held up the drawing in question. It was a starry night sky with lots of planets too but mostly sky and some stars, some shooting some just twinkling. And then he pulled the focus back to his current picture, “So yeah, Jones has no hair and he’s smoking ‘cus he always smoking and then Falsworth with the pointy nose and the fancy hair.” Steve chuckled.
Sarah headed back downstairs to give James her love and say goodbye. It was going on 1am but he needed to be back in the morning. He had some business that required him specifically though normally on weekends he took personal time.
any of them.
,” he said and ran his fingers over his mother’s name.
Tony tilted his head to one side as Clint spoke. “Steve gave me his tags too. I left them in the last location for him to find.” He squeezed Clint’s hand in his. “I’m still grateful for the time I got with him. Even if it was only a few months. That’s more than I had before.”
“Interesting,” Steve observed, grabbing the bottle and making quick work of the packaging around the top. The sound of the cork popping out was like music to his ears and the smell that came from it made his mouth water.
“Neither did I.”
“You’re the same age as me, right?” Steve asked and Rhodey nodded, so done with this entire interaction.
“What are you thinking about?” Tony asked, tilting his head up to look at Steve.
“Bad day?” Tony asked softly, still holding Steve’s hand. “Anything I can do for you,
“You hungry?” James asked, knowing better than to dwell on Clint’s confessions right now. He knew he should wait a little bit, give Clint a breather and then double back if Clint wanted to discuss anything he had said in more detail.
Sarah looked at him with a loving gaze and reached out to touch Tony’s cheek. He did move away a little but managed not to flinch.
“That you like ‘em both ways,” she stated as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “Is that what this is about?”
He looked over at Benni drawing and craned his neck up to see the picture but it was out of his sight. He figured he would show it to him when it was done like he had the others he’d drawn.
After a while of Tony saying nothing, Clint looked away and then after a few more minutes he got up and went back to his mattress, taking his bread roll and water with him. If Tony was done talking, so was Clint. He was tired, his older sibling instincts had run out and he just wanted James.
Tony sat up straight, his brows furrowed in confusion. “He what now?”
He pulled out his pocket watch and read 5:27pm. He’d gotten there sometime around two in the afternoon. It was Sunday evening and he spent quite a few Sunday evenings with unconscious Tony, periodically getting up to check his pulse and breathing himself.
“Ugh, you’re so old,” Bucky groaned, rolling his eyes. Steve huffed, making Bucky laugh. “So anyway, Stark. He seems… like a good way to get back out there. Relationship material… not sure I’d go that far but he was hot.”
“Well, I mostly asked him what he liked about you. Turns out you have a likable side.”
about that. For a time. Now… I’m not so sure.”
Steve nodded gravely. The horn of the fire truck sounded loudly and Steve startled, whipping his head around though he couldn’t see the truck from the office.
He was glad Steve didn’t mention his reaction. The moment was too nice to ruin by talking about things like that.
Tony repeated with a scoff. “What is this? Canada?” He nudged Steve and grinned. “That’s all you’re going to give me, right? I’ll just have to wait a whole month before I get to see it?”
“Yes,” was all he managed to say, lying on his stomach and trying to catch his breath. He was sore but absolutely satisfied and happy that he was able to give Steve that. If his body allowed he’d continue but even Steve seemed to have reached his limits. He loved to see him exhausted like that, the sweat rolling down his chest and his forehead. There was nothing more beautiful to Tony. “Steve?” He smiled. “I love you.”
“Hey,” he greeted them softly, not wanting to disturb anyone. “Do you need anything? Are you okay?”
Steve looked up at the way Tony said his name, the unusual tone catching his attention and he wished he could see those eyes but turning on the light would take away the freedom the dark gave him. Or at least, the freedom he felt he had to just relax and speak openly. “Well, I still hope you got more than four hours tonight.” Against his will, he yawned and it was so deep it made his eyes water. “You know I sleep,” he said, remembering Tony coming to wake him at noon. “Sometimes more ‘an I oughtta, just not today.”
James ground his jaw angrily and beside him Steve did the same.
“Thank you,” he smiled, appreciating how supportive Steve was of anything he needed. “Anything?” he asked, challenging, now grinning a little. “What if I asked for a car?”
“Let’s go,” James said. “I think I know someone who can help more than this idiot.”
“After everything, do you expect me to call him ‘sir’ or ‘Mr Rogers’?”
“It’s nice that he feels so comfortable,” James said, his hand rested on Clint’s knee.
James looked over at them, immediately going to get Clint who was trying to stand on his own.
“Straight-laced Jim Rhodes rooms with this human disaster?” Bucky asked, laughing. “No offense.”
Steve nodded towards his book. “Whatcha reading?” Tony’s new clothes also hadn’t escaped his notice but he figured getting into a conversation over Sarah buying him wardrobes worth of expensive clothing would just be more tiring. They could have that talk tomorrow.
Steve turned to Tony, saw the obvious discomfort and removed his hand, not entirely sure what had come over him to behave like that not only in front of guests, but his mother. Maybe he should’ve given Tony what he wanted the other day, saved himself from wanting it so badly now. He cleared his throat and ate the serving Tony had given him.
“Look at you, making my night easier one roast at a time,” Tony said with a grin, grabbing the shirt and starting to change. “And as for the date, it’s a secret. The only thing I know is that I’m supposed to meet him at his place.”
When the meeting was over, it was almost midnight and the six most powerful and dangerous people on the east coast all left the same place and headed to their respective territories. Some happier when they left, others—mainly Don Fisk—frustrated.
“So you said to choose something I enjoy,” Steve started, “well, I may not know many recipes but I know a few and I like to cook. I’m also a little old-fashioned. So I wanted to cook for you.”
“Love, you alright?”
“Oh, really?” Clint asked, and could the pain in his leg please pass already? “Well, if you remember it, I’d love to hear it. Do you have a favorite planet? Mine’s Saturn because of the rings. Like donuts.”
Steve woke up as soon as the door closed. Tony didn’t need lights to know that.
“I won’t leave here if you don’t want me to,” Tony promised.
Steve and James watched from behind, wishing they’d done more, hurt him more so he couldn’t even speak. How he found the strength, the will, to talk to that boy like that when he knew his torturers were five feet away and more than willing to let him have it was beyond them.
“So.”
“Steve...” He gasped, arching his back off the bed. Before he could find the words to say what he wanted to, he came moaning Steve’s name. He was still coming down, feeling Steve’s hand stroking him slowly and noticing how he was pulling out of him. “Don’t… stop.”
“It’s something old, new, borrowed, and blue. The first ones I have.”
a literal hero? I draw the line there, Rogers,” Tony said, grinning as he swirled his wine.
“Come now, Falsworth,” he said, passing under a streetlight, casting shadows on his face, making the places where his eyes should’ve been black holes. He smiled at Falsworth. “Turn, let me get my knife, make this a fair fight.”
“You didn’t strike me as the type to be late,” Tony said but he was smiling.
Tony had to swallow several times to get rid of the lump in his throat. “I’ve heard of you. Not much.” He realized that Clint didn’t need to actually hear words. It was enough for him to read Tony’s lips. And so he formed silent words. “Are you okay?”
Finally finished with all of his gift shopping (for now), James and Dmitri headed out of the department store and back to the car. The watch would be ready for pickup in two days. James hoped Clint would like it. He wanted to get him something that could be for Clint what the dog tags were for James—a reminder of his love, that he was there for him even when he couldn’t physically be, that they were always connected even when apart.
“I just already wasn’t having the best morning when it happened,” he admitted, his voice low. “It reminded me of
“I don’t do inactivity well,” he said, leaning his head back. The doctors said he had another four weeks. When he tried to protest, Sarah had all but threatened him so he shut up. “Four weeks is an awfully long time to do nothing.”
“Gotcha.” He turned. “Tony!” he yelled and a moment later a door upstairs clicked open and a man came out with his head down, looking at a tablet.
“He didn’t say a word. Came in, said you’d been shot and that you were at the hospital. Pet, he didn’t even say what happened.”
“Really?” Bucky asked and Tony nodded.
“Out,” James said and Tony turned to look at him. So they were taking care of this? How did they even let this happen? Tony sat down in the chair next to Sarah and kept holding her hand. There was nothing for them to do but sit and wait.
“There’s still risk involved in that. No matter what, if we decide to inspect either of these buildings next, we run the risk of being outed again,” James countered.
Clint inhaled sharply, caught between just letting everything out or getting his shit together because he was sure James must have been busy and he’d come all the way here from wherever he had been because Clint couldn’t wait to have his breakdown at home. Or just not have one altogether.
Now heading through the hallway again, he started loosening his tie, unbuttoning his waistcoat. By the time he reached the ground floor he could hear the soft jazz wafting his way and he followed it into the library where he found his mother and Tony, each with their own books.
“Okay, sweetheart,” Clint said, happily taking the coffee Tony offered him. Once James was out of earshot, Clint asked, “You sure your hands are up to the task of cooking? I’m perfectly happy with cereal.”
Before he could get lost in his thoughts, he remembered that Clint said something else. “Ah, yes. She wants to see me soon, so you might meet her.”
“And?”
Steve tossed him on the bed and tugged Tony’s pants off, then his shirt, and then kicked off his own into a corner, shutting the door. They were both grateful Rhodey was on a date with Captain Danvers from Firehouse 21 so they had the whole place to themselves.
“Did you hang up on him?” Steve asked, the corner of his mouth lifting.
“Mm, probably steak and potatoes. Basic.”
“Oh, fuck.
“So you invite him for lunch?”
James, probably owing to his upbringing, was just the right amount of quiet and refined for her tastes.
But all in all it wasn’t so bad being back home again. Tony called from time to time and Clint called Tony, especially when James was working and he was home alone. It kept him from missing him too much and helped on the days when he was feeling a little under the weather. He was happy to hear that Tony seemed to be doing alright too.
James agreed because really all that mattered was that Clint was safe. He had him back and he would

“You’re more important,” he said, kissing his cheek and getting up with him. On their way up he told Benni in Italian to help Sarah with dishes before going to bed himself.
James left strategizing to Steve, it was his specialty and something for which he had earned his rank during the war.
“Why do you ask?” James wondered, lowering his paper again to give Clint his full attention.
“I would if I could but I think between dinner and dessert, I’m going to be out soon,” Clint said softly. “
“She’s helping me today,” he said and Pepper with her charming ways introduced herself and had them smiling at her in no time and they let them in. Jones still patted Tony down when he came in and Tony had gotten used to it.
“Pet, look at me,” Sarah said calmly, a hand on top of his. “Sit down. Let me take care of this.”
“There are more than enough books in my room for now. As soon as I’m done there, I’ll come back to you.” He wanted to ask about Steve’s favorite, books he could recommend and books he didn’t like but Tony didn’t.
“Come on,” James said to the pup who jumped up onto the couch and laid himself across Clint’s legs, resting his face on his thighs and staring up at him. James had already grown attached to Lucky but seeing the way Lucky also cared for Clint made him love the dog even more.
Steve laughed. “
He couldn’t wait to show Tony Ireland. Show him all the places he’d gone as a child with Sarah. Show him Belfast as well. Perhaps a few days in the city to show Tony the place where he was born. Maybe even stop by the house they had there as well. It was exciting.
“He’s never been a fan of our plan to coexist and he’s certainly never liked that as far as the balance of power is concerned, the scales tip heavily in my and James’ direction,” Steve added, deciding there was no point in fighting Natalia’s involvement anymore. If James said she could help, he would let her help. His energy was needed elsewhere and he just wanted Tony back safe and sound in his arms.
When Steve broke the kiss he dropped his forehead against Tony’s and he laughed. “I never thought this would happen. I feel like the luckiest man in the world.” There were things they’d need to talk about—Benni, how the relationship would work exactly, boundaries (where it was safe to be themselves, when and with whom)—but they could get to that another day when things could get serious again. Right then and there Steve just wanted to kiss Tony and revel in the fact that he loved him back.
“Wilson, Barton, you guys free?” Lieutenant Rhodes called over his radio, watching the house go up in flames.
“These past weeks you kept him safe, stayed by his side and found the people who were a threat. That’s not nothing, Dugan.” Tony said sincerely. Though he knew where this came from, Tony wanted him to know that he did everything he could. “Winter is Winter. But you’re you. And there’s a reason I asked you,” he said, looking around the room. It was a nice room not that he expected any less of James.
With a bright smile on his lips he turned to Steve, staring into those blue eyes he loved so much.
And then it just became a vicious cycle eating him up because with that, he understood how James felt though he was sure that James hurt even worse. He had suppressed it longer and been tempted more. He had watched Steve be with many others and fall in love with someone else. And it all just made Steve sick. Why couldn’t he be everything that everyone needed him to be all the time? Why did he have to hurt the people for whom he cared most?
, she thought to herself.
There was some stinging pain on his thigh from where Steve had slapped him and a sore spot where his nail had dug into Tony’s skin, not to mention that he felt every muscle in his lower back burn. But he felt absolutely amazing. “So good,” he repeated and closed his eyes again.
“No, not really. I’m thirty-three, you?”
A part of Clint hated that he was going to leave the pup again so soon. Despite not really having a say in the matter, he’d been gone for so long already last year and left Lucky probably thinking he’d been abandoned by him.
“Yes, but... more. Please,” he mumbled.
By the time they were all done with the main course and Tony was whisking the whipped cream, Benni excused himself to listen to his crime show in the living room. Sarah accompanied him because she was just as invested. Plus, she enjoyed being able to talk with Benni about it.
“They call me Jones, and you are?”
were that person. One day.
Steve laughed but covered it with a cough and said, “I did have some photos of Ballycastle I could show you. They’re in my desk drawer. In our room.”
Tony nodded. “Poorly but yes.”
Steve slowed his breathing, trying to calm himself, trying to listen to Tony. Tony who he loved more than life itself and would do anything to protect. He dragged a hand across his face over his wet eyes and cleared his throat, saying quietly but firmly, “I’ll kill him with my bare hands before I let anything happen to you.” He pressed kisses to Tony’s hands and up his forearms. “I won’t let anything happen to me. You’re not losing me. Not on account of some ignorant fucks.” He channeled the hurt into anger, something he had mastered over the years.
“Because you kiss?”
They had stumbled their way to his bedroom, leaving a trail of clothing behind them and probably earning themselves a few bruises that didn’t have anything to do with having a good time but if Steve wasn’t satisfied after dinner, he sure as hell was now.
and the little one. You and me just sitting here talking.”
Clint was eating his dinner while James simply watched him. It was almost uncomfortable until Clint turned to meet his eyes and James blew him a kiss, his expression so incredibly soft and in love.
He kicked them open and all three of them dashed through and out into an alleyway. It was empty but there was a trail of trash that looked like it had been piled up before someone ran right through it. Jessica took off in that direction and Bucky followed, Steve went around the other side.
Tony scoffed. “Deal with it,” he gave back with a grin. “Pepper worked at the deli with me a few days a week. My mom had an Italian deli. Me and my sister helped out but… at the end it was just me and Pepper.” He looked down for a second. Even though it had been such a long time since then it still hurt. Did Steve ever sell the building? Let someone else move in?
. Have you seen
“I know,” Steve replied, his voice a strange mix of pain, fear and disgust. “It looks just like when Howard got to him. It makes me
“He is stupid, isn’t he?” Tony said with a laugh and Sam chuckled. Tony leaned over and hugged Rhodey tight, his hands clutching at the fabric of his hospital gown and Rhodey swallowed hard.
. When he got back to James’ face, James smirked, his lips so kissable that Clint almost tried to stand up.
“A little,” James said, shaking the blood off his fist, watching the droplets hit the ground with a cruel smile on his face. He closed his eyes, cracking his neck, and exhaled slowly, looking over at Steve. “If you want a go, I’d wait a bit or else he’ll black out.”
“I’m okay, it’s okay, baby,” Steve said, holding out his arm for Tony to hug him. Tony stood, leaning down carefully to hug him and then he pressed a kiss to Steve’s jaw, then his chin and finally his lips.
“In the safest hands in all of New York,” he replied without hesitation.
“Kissing is disgusting, eh? I’ll remind you of that when you have your first steady.” Tony grinned and pinched his brother playfully, making him squeal and giggle. “Or, you know, a boy steady. Your feelings are your feelings. And I’ll tell you what
Benni got up as soon as he heard Sarah and headed straight to her for a hug. Tony barely even noticed as he was distracted by Steve and his voice so close to his ear.
“Let’s go see Loki,” James said.
“You’re right. I apologize,” he told him instead. He tapped the bar twice with two fingers and seconds later a new drink came his way, a double of Powers, neat.
“Alright.” He hung up and an hour later, he relayed the information to Steve.
“Waking you up.”
wrong.” He pressed another kiss onto him, this time into his hair and Clint let out another shaky sigh and held onto James tighter, his fist clenching around a handful of James’ shirt as a shudder ripped through him.
She headed upstairs when she didn’t find him anywhere else and she pushed the door open to see him sleeping. She didn’t bother him, happy he was finally resting despite knowing full well if he was in his right frame of mind he wouldn’t still be asleep at three in the afternoon.
Steve sighed. “It
“I love you, ma. Even when I didn’t tell you, there was never a time I didn’t,” he told her. She smiled a little. “But da? I knew if he ever found out he’d kill me himself. So I was careful about saying it or being it in the house, but not because of you.” She didn’t say anything because she knew he was right about his father.
Tony froze in place until he saw the shadows of the men getting bigger and bigger. Too late he convinced his cold and stiff body to move and run. The men recognized him, immediately started yelling and coming after him. One man grabbed him by his wrist but he managed to wiggle out of his grip and kicked the man blindly. He stumbled and fell into the snow but was quick to get up again, immediately starting to run again.
Steve looked confused when he asked that. Maybe his reputation didn’t reach as far as he thought. “I’m not known to be particularly… caring,” he explained. “I’m happy to hear it.” Steve didn’t know what to do now. Tony was awake and he was still awake and this was so far the best part of his evening—or early morning, rather—but he knew Tony needed to sleep.
When the boys left, Steve turned to Sarah and she spoke.
“You bet,” Steve said just as there was a knock on the door.
He continued to explain how a man in a dark suit had sat at his table one day while he was drinking his coffee, it was a short while after Loki had spoken to James about becoming mayor.
disclaimer: neither I nor Blanket pretend to be experts in handling PTSD or anything else, we're just going by what we know and research we've done. Also, don't forget this is 1949.
“We’re back!” Benni announced, “and lookit, we brought Jimmy.”
Now he had a frenzy on his hands.
“I love you
Steve didn’t return the pleasantries, still trying to work out where exactly James had brought him.
“He said he didn’t want to go back to our home. Something must have scared him, I guess.” Tony gently pulled his brother in his arms. “I’ve tried to keep him as safe as I could. I really did. But I didn’t realize he still got hurt this bad,” he mumbled.
After they finished their cake, Sarah and Benni headed out to do some grocery shopping for a ‘special dinner’, as she had called it. She shooed Benni upstairs, chasing him with threats of tickles, to get dressed and not long after they headed out, leaving Steve and Tony in the kitchen.
“Sorry. I don’t mean to keep harping on it. I’m sure you can understand it doesn’t happen all that often. And even less so do I go on dates with the person in question,” Steve countered, chuckling.
James said, dismissing Nikolai, his bookkeeper, along with Vitaly who would also be taking on more responsibility in James’ absence.
On the couch were three people he didn’t know and then at the table were faces he recognized, so he grinned and headed for them. Bucky and Sam were at the table with Wanda, Thor, and Val, short for Valkyrie, drinking coffee and chatting. On the couch were Clint, Pietro, and Wade watching Jeopardy (and losing terribly), and in the kitchen Natasha and Okoye stood holding hands and talking about their weekend plans.
“Hey, love,” Steve said, smiling at Tony as he entered and went to the fireplace to warm up his hands before he sat down beside him, not wanting to touch him with cold fingers.

She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned lightly against James’ side. He was surprised, figuring that her roughness with him must not have been anything negative. Maybe she was nice to Steve because she
Steve stopped immediately at Tony’s words and dropped his hands to stare at him. He collapsed back onto the couch, a hand falling casually onto Tony’s leg. He was looking at him in slight shock and definite awe. He shook his head. “You being so calm about this is going to take some getting used to and I don’t think I ever thanked you. I know, I know, ‘no need for thanks’ but nonetheless.”
“Sadly, I have to cut this short,” he told him. “Insubordination never sleeps.”
“It hasn’t been this quiet at the table since you two broke Mr Reynolds’ window and didn’t want to tell me,” Sarah commented. James chuckled and then it turned into a full on laugh.
There was a lot for Tony to learn about shooting in general and also with his goal in mind. He wanted to focus and he managed to do so but there was also Steve standing impossibly close to him and Tony couldn't help but remember seeing him sleep topless. Steve’s muscles were prominent through the layers of clothing, his firm body so big that Tony would most likely be invisible. That thought was oddly comforting to Tony. He could disappear in Steve’s arms. In the warmth of his embrace, while his strong arms were wrapped around him. When his mind was going places it really shouldn’t go to, Tony pushed the thoughts down. He had to focus.
Steve thought about it for a few minutes. He could, he might even get a yes judging solely by how Tony was looking at him while he waited for Rhodey to show. He was good-looking and had been entertaining. Steve wasn’t really one for blackout drunken nights and all-night parties—he was thirty-three, just
The meeting had gone off without a hitch, Dmitri performed excellently as James knew he would and now he had a much better feel of how to conduct the room should he need to. There would not be another group meeting like that—having all of them in one place was dangerous and even they knew that—unless there was an absolute necessity for it and in all of James’ years of doing this job, there never had been.
James’ idea of a good time.
“Don’t let him hear that because that doesn’t sound like stealing your dog would ever have consequences.” He sat down at the table next to Clint. Slowly he was starting to get worried about Sarah and where she was. “That’s nice. I want to get to know Natalia. We should invite her here too.”
Clint and James excused themselves first, wishing everyone a goodnight and making their way upstairs. It took a little effort to help Clint up the stairs and to the room but they made it and James collapsed onto the bed, Clint beside him after they’d both cleaned themselves up a bit.
Sarah takes the boys shopping, James and Steve visit Howard (gross), and Steve's proper grammar goes flying out the window when he's tired.
“Good choice. I think it’ll look lovely. Very extravagant.”
“Yes, exactly. Did you think about my question?” Tony fixed his hair. Those locks were more stubborn than his own and were in desperate need of a trim.
Loki gestured towards the stairs.
“Antonio, actually,” he answered.
Seeing Steve this small and sad hurt Tony and he kissed him lovingly. “
“I—I don’t know. I haven’t heard from him since the election.”
Tony melted against Steve. He was so close to ignoring everyone else, locking the door and letting Steve have his way with him then and there. Instead he took a few deep breaths and nodded. If that was what he wanted, he would get it.
Tony thought a lot about what James said, not even caring that he was now alone in the kitchen. He preferred to be alone and have time to process things. Though it didn’t seem that it would be the case for this. He tucked in Benni a bit earlier than usual and told him he would be back very late and he should go to Sarah if he was scared or anything.
He was alone.
like him, which made Tony wonder when he had managed to actually smell him. And who did that anyway? What was wrong with him lately?
He let go of Tony’s hand and slowly laid down, keeping his hands under his pillow, facing away from Tony because what he felt right then was too much. His chest aching and every breath hurt but not from his physical wounds. “Okay,” he said quietly, keeping his voice low so it wouldn’t crack.
He picked up one of the papers on which Tony had circled the name at the top and read it over. “Fucking hell,” he cursed, furious. “Separate the accounts with the discrepancies from the others and put them on my desk. I’ll be right back.” He turned to leave and then added, “And calculate as well the total amount that’s unaccounted for.”
“I’m going to pick you up,” James said to Clint who watched his lips and then went to his eyes, being flooded with happiness, and he nodded. James lifted Clint the same way Steve had Tony, cradling him in his arms.
“We won’t be,” James said, indicating with his chin over to Clint and Tony. “Don’t think I could keep them apart now even if I wanted to. Besides, someone has to come around and put you in your place every now and then.”
He waited for Tony to nod and then continued. “All the rooms are individual beds, so sharing shouldn’t raise any suspicion but we will dine occasionally in the dining hall. Room service is an option, though, I’d rather not raise attention by never leaving our rooms, alright?”
“I was in the neighborhood,” he said, slamming Howard forcefully against the wall when he dared to make a sound.
When the movie ended, they were the first to head out through a way shown to them by one of the ushers.
“Apparently not as much as I thought we had,” he confessed.
“You’re so madly in love. You don’t know how happy it makes me to see it.”
The jarring sound of James’ phone ringing cut Steve’s sentence short and both of their heads snapped around to look at it. Was it Maria? Had someone accidentally called another of Bakuto’s buildings? They had stopped that tactic after the first success because they didn’t want him catching on to what they had been doing. Was Bakuto ready to make more demands of which Steve and James had zero intent of fulfilling? Most likely.
“Who are you?”
Later, still mostly naked and both very satisfied, they were laying on the couch, a blanket underneath them and another draped across them. Tony was lying on Steve, one of Steve’s legs dangling off onto the floor and his arm around Tony. The arm around Tony was slowly drawing designs onto his soft, bare back, his other one tucked behind his head to prop him up so he could look down at his beautiful fella.
“No, but it shouldn’t be that way. You make James happy. If you weren’t here, there’s a very good chance he wouldn’t be either.” He paused. “I have a lot to be thankful for when it comes to you, you know. I just have an awful way of showing it.”
“You did a lot today. Do you feel better?”
Steve nearly choked on the coffee he was drinking, turning to Tony, both eyebrows raised and he laughed. “So you can say that but I can’t compliment your looks?” He wiped his handkerchief across his mouth and then said, “‘Course I will. But slowly. There’s no rush, love.”
“No, I want you to go eat dinner and be a good boy,” Tony said more firmly. He was running out of energy again. Benni gave him a small kiss and headed downstairs. Once he was gone Tony laid back down and closed his eyes again, hoping he could sleep some more. Of course he couldn’t, but giving his body rest also helped. Not with his feelings or the things he saw and remembered. But it was something. Probably.
“Hi, pet, I wasn’t expecting a call from you. Everything alright?”
“I told Tony but it’s not necessary for you to get us anything, even though I appreciate it,” she told Steve politely. Tony had noticed that she always avoided saying his name one way or another.
“I got it, Cap,” Clint told him, getting out to start refueling.
James nodded, looking into Tony’s room with a smile as he answered. “His leg hurts but he was alright enough to ask for jello. How are you doing?”
" James mumbled in Russian and Tony looked at him.
Clint snorted, smiling. “I love you.”
Tony playfully snapped at Steve’s finger, which was when he remembered that they weren’t alone in the room. “Maybe a little of both?”
” Steve said, a vein in his forehead extending. He was mad at himself for not having seen this coming. He should’ve known anyone James would fall for had to be a resourceful person.
Was this Rhodey’s boyfriend? But Rhodey was straight last they all checked. Not that they routinely checked but Steve was about ninety-nine percent sure Rhodey was straight.
“Can you tell me what happened? Did you bring me here?” He asked slowly. He had a right to know, didn’t he? Then why did it feel wrong to ask?
And now Steve told him he had several hundred dollars in an account for himself. And he didn’t have to lift a finger. Didn’t risk a beating. While he could sleep comfortably and had time to read books and do things with his brother, Pepper, and Steve.
Steve gave Tony a reassuring smile and said, looking only at Tony, “It seems like you two do pretty well together.” He looked briefly at Clint and then went back to Tony. “We were thinking maybe you two would like to spend some more time together. Seems like it might help.”
“I wanted to get him something that will last. It’s not a single use item, it’s not something he can’t use everyday. I want him to be able to look at his wrist and be reminded of me and that I love him. Especially since I’m not always there,” he said simply, trying to control the somewhat goofy smile the words ‘I love him’ threatened to put on his face. Natalia still caught it and smiled in return. “I’m getting it engraved, which is why I don’t have it now. I thought that might add an extra personal touch.”
Dmitri came in and stood behind his boss’ usual chair, hands clasped in front of him.
Bucky shrugged, leaning his chair back. “You’ve been having a dry spell lately. I mean, there was that girl from Human Resources—Lilian or whatever—but that barely lasted a month. Before that was, uh… damn, a while ago, huh? I can’t even remember.”
Benni smiled at James who waved at him, a smile on his own face.
He didn’t blame Tony for it. For anything. He blamed himself for letting his guard down, for wanting something he had no right to and then he just wanted to go get a drink and vent to James about it but he couldn’t. His mother didn’t understand, his best friend had cut off all communication and headed five thousand miles east and the only other person he even considered talking to about anything he
,” he said in Japanese.
“But you won’t
Sarah sighed, the thought of that man making her blood boil. Steve tilted his head to the side. “Did you need anything, ma? I’d rather not bore you with the details.”
After Clint moved in with him, he got to see it up close. It didn’t happen for at least a solid month after Clint moved in and then when it did, it hit hard and James couldn’t help but wonder if that was because Clint had spent all that time fighting it so James wouldn’t see it; wearing himself out until it finally overcame him when he had nothing left with which to fight it.
“Steve said he wants to be my last.” Just the thought of the conversation made Tony’s stomach and heart flutter. “He said he’s going to get me a ring even if we can’t get married for real. For a second I wondered if that was the right thing to do but I am selfish and said yes. I don’t want anyone else.”
Tony hummed, feeling guilty about not wanting to go. “Her family is big and so is his. Everyone and their dog are invited. I get overwhelmed with James and Clint here.” He kept his voice low, as if that made any difference. “Does that make me a bad friend?”
“Hi, love. Thank you, Dugan.” Dugan nodded and closed the door behind him, leaving Tony and Steve alone. Steve came around the desk to sit on the couch, patting the cushion beside him.
“And when we have them, we’re going to torture that fucker and burn everything he loves to the ground while he watches,” James said.
“Yeah.” Again Benni sounded disgusted and shook his head.
“Like you said, it’s barely nine-thirty, why should I start making lunch now?” She responded, pulling his ear playfully as she passed him.
“You didn’t make me sad,
, was something Maria had always told Tony and he found those words to be true, especially with Steve.
“More,” he moaned, grabbing the sheets under him.
“Do you want to play with me?”
Natalia and Steve still had not formally met. When he came in, she was already there and he went straight for James, angry and stressed, to try and figure out what happened and it almost turned into a fight. Both of them were angry and hurting and scared even if they didn’t own up to it and Steve stormed in and shoved James who was just as distraught as Steve, demanding answers. Clint might have had a good ten years on Tony but that didn’t mean he didn’t have other disadvantages that Tony didn’t have.
“And you’re, what? Twenty-seven? You’re pushin’ thirty, laddie.” He didn’t comment more and his mother realized she’d hit a sore spot without him ever having to tell her. She grabbed her own meal and settled down on the couch beside him, eating and talking about some nonsense from her last visit back to Ireland.
“You got him to sleep,” James said, in a mix of awe and appreciation. “Thank you.” Clint only thought he had been sneaky about his nights spent wide awake but James had been awake most of that time as well, waiting in case Clint felt like talking.
Clint’s head rolled slowly to the side, his eyes opening. There was that beautiful dark blue James loved so much. He leaned forward to press a kiss right between his eyebrows and then another to his cheekbone and finally one to Clint’s lips.
Tony made himself comfortable and listened closely to what Steve was saying. “It was a long day for you,” Tony said softly and pulled the much taller and more muscular man to lay down on his chest so he could play with his hair softly. “Tell me as much or as little as you want to,
Steve tried his best not to smile and failed. He laughed. James knew him too well. “Dark-haired, tough, eyes to die for,” he said, remembering the way Tony had watched him the first time he’d visited the deli. This was one of the only places James and he discussed such things. Their men were loyal but not all were as loyal as the two with them now. Some would definitely choose to report them over support them.
“I did and I will. Whatever you want. Or whatever you want for Pepper,” he agreed, pinching Tony’s thigh playfully.
,” James said, knowing Steve knew what he meant, “one of my men spotted him this morning at the pharmacy buying burn ointment. He approached him but he would not talk.” Steve wanted to roll his eyes because of course Tony wasn’t about to talk to some random Russian at the pharmacy asking about his private life. “He reported it to me just a few minutes ago.” As he added the last sentence, he wiped his knuckles off on a handkerchief in his pocket, blood on them.
Tony’s voice was low when he finally managed to find words again. “Does it ever stop?”
“How are you going to keep this up?” He asked with a smile and picked up his jacket, putting it back on. “Thanks, Steve. For trusting me this much.”
friend and even though I’m sure he’s the reason I’m balding prematurely, I would do
Again Tony had spent a night wide awake, unable to sleep. Whenever he closed his eyes he could see Howard— memories from when he was younger, when Maria was still alive, then when he started drinking, started hurting Tony on a daily basis and finally when Tony had shot him in the face. Benni’s anxiety about having to go back had amplified Tony’s own feelings. He remembered very well what Steve had told him and maybe it was time to talk about it?
be hungry—he hadn’t eaten since that morning—but at the same time the thought of food made him nauseous. His stomach was in a tight, anxious knot and a good dose of self-loathing was tied in there too for being so
Clint ate the food offered and then said, “For introducing me to your family.”
“Is he alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
James sat his glass down and ran his hands through his hair, sighing deeply though it came out jagged and strained. Steve downed his drink and poured another.
it!” He dragged a hand down his face, still looking around. “God, this is so sweet.”
“I know.
Tony said and moved to sit on Steve’s bed, carefully taking his hand. “Are you safe now? Not here. I know here it is safe for you. But… when you go home. And go back to work?”
“No, yours?”
he greeted her, leaning in to kiss her cheek.
Clint chuckled this time and then turned towards him as much as he could without jostling his leg. How he wished this thing would heal in the next few days. “Think you’ll sleep tonight?”
“Sir,” Tony mumbled.
“‘Course! Who hasn’t been!” She laughed until she noticed the look on Tony’s face. “What? Never?” He shook his head. “That’s jus’ plain sad. We need to find ya a nice bird. I have a friend I think ya’d like her. Do ya want me to bring her next time?”
“Bruce? Remember what I said about understanding social cues? This is your cue to leave,” Tony said, giving him a pointed look.
“Ya cracked your ribs,” Dugan told him and he finally looked over at Dugan and Tony, giving them a small smile but he winced and the smile faded completely as he remembered.
“He does,” she agreed, going back to sit in her chair. “But don’t put it off forever.”
, Tony said. That was good to know.
James had told Steve to wait outside. Gao liked James, he knew she did and, as he had said before, after Steve she was also James’ favorite. However, she didn’t care much for Steve. She found him abrasive and demanding. And young.
James felt the relief wash over him like a wave but he maintained his serious demeanor. “Thank you.”
“You know what, Romanoff,” Steve said warningly and Clint high-fived her. They had a competition going to see which of them could get scolded by him first on a non-job related issue.
Clint looked up, a lopsided grin on his lips. “
Dugan and Dmitri had been promoted, in a sense, and now handled a lot more than before, so Jones and Vitaly took on protection detail for Steve and James.
“Oh. That’s really nice,” he said, definitely not expecting that answer but at least he didn’t feel like he needed to worry about her if that’s where she had been.
He wanted everyone to be absolutely crystal clear on their roles and responsibilities far ahead of time and he wanted to make sure everything was already operating smoothly before he left. He didn’t want to leave Dmitri with problems to fix, although he completely trusted him to make any necessary spontaneous decisions without needing to contact James. He was only to contact him in the event of an emergency.
Tony took Steve’s hand and watched him stare at the wall as if all the answers to every question ever was there.
James sauntered over—honestly, could the man not walk non-sexily and do Clint some favors?—and leaned on the chair beside Clint’s. Clint looked him up and down. It had been a
Tony tensed hearing Steve’s words. Not that. Anything but that. “Not yet,” he said and hid his face against Steve’s side. He’d rather hear more about a country he’d probably never see.
“What? Of course, sweetheart.”
Sarah sat back and hummed, thinking. She chewed her bottom lip like Steve did when he was deep in thought. James smiled at the similarity.
after Russian.”
Steve laughed, momentarily forgetting all about his troubles. “Is it?” He kissed him again. “Hadn’t noticed. Let me just—” Another kiss “—confirm that.” Two more kisses. “He may have a point, ya know, but I’ll need a lot more test trials to be sure.” He grinned down at him but looked towards the clock on the wall that chimed. “We should probably get down for dinner before ma comes burstin’ in here. I haven’t spoken to her yet.”
Steve nodded. “Let’s get back to the targets. Try to recreate how I had you a moment ago.” He watched as Tony did his best to recreate it and was impressed when he saw only a few mistakes. Steve tried not to end up so close to Tony again because when had he began to smell so nice?
“So, when ya lookin’ at boilin’ bubblin’ water, it’s hot, right? When you’re in love it’s the same. Ya don’t need no confirmation. It just makes sense ‘cus it’s a given.”
Sarah thought about this, chewing her lip, and then asked, “When did you tell Dugan?”
Tony took his time running his fingers between Steve’s eyebrows until the worry lines were gone. Once that was achieved he moved on to run his fingers through his pretty, blond hair.
That being said, Clint still wanted to reassure him. To provide him with the confirmation that no matter what he had gone through, his love for James never dissipated; it was as strong and as sure as ever.
As slowly and silently as possible he made his way out of their bed and the room too. He would sneak back in before it was time for Steve to get up but for now he needed to walk around and give his restlessness some satisfaction. Without thinking about it he ended up in the living room where the rest of last night’s fire was still lingering. Tony added a few pieces of wood to get it going so he could watch the flames dance and not think about anything.
kicked his ass?
Steve made an angry noise and said firmly, “I wasn’t about to let that happen.” It disgusted him and it hurt him to think back to the dread he’d felt sprinting down those freezing blocks wondering if Tony was still going to be alive by the time he got there. “He’ll never lay another hand on you. Or anyone else for that matter.”
Steve put a hand on James’ shoulder, sensing that he had had just about enough from Bakuto.
She came over and pressed another kiss to his forehead.
And then Steve called back.
He pulled him back in, swaying again. “You’re a natural.”
Steve stepped back and made his way for the door, pausing with his hand on the handle when Tony called out to him.
So Natalia had explained that a material gift was fine but a sentimental one was better. Something with a large amount of love rather than a large amount of zeros. And if it was both, that was fine too but the most important part was that there was reason and emotion and love behind it.
what he said,” Tony offered.
The whole situation seemed somewhat ridiculous to Tony at that point.
“Of course, anything.”
He jerked awake, picking it up, apologizing to Sarah, and he was just about to clean up the mess when Lucky beat him to it.
James gave her a smile. “Thank you, Maria.”
“What do you do in the bar apart from serving drinks? What is there to do?” He was genuinely curious since he had never set foot in a bar and also didn’t understand how going out for a drink was considered a form of entertainment.
Why did Tony feel disappointed? Because he was actually given a choice? “My mom’s dead. That place is… if I don’t have to, I’d rather not go back there.” But that was all he had. The store and his few belongings in the apartment above it.
“That’s probably because I didn’t say I would be here,” James answered casually, picking up a different watch and comparing it to one of the others.
“Shh!” Benni hissed, making Lucky perk up for a second.
“Ah, yeah. The filthy heathen,” Clint sighed, wiggling his leg. “Doc said I’ve got another few weeks now, though. So I’d be good then.”
“Yeah. Just need to lie down.”
“It was nice, Pep. I’ll see you around?” Tony asked and she nodded. They hugged before Tony and Benni went inside. Tony was taking the long way back to the house, not knowing if it would be a good idea to use the front door. It was unusual for him to head out without Steve or Sarah and he should probably talk to one of them about what to say and how to behave.
Mo dhia (Gaelic) - My god
Clint didn’t dwell on Tony’s mention of his sister. He had talked about her before briefly but it didn’t seem like a topic he wanted to delve deeper into. “Well, a friend of Tony’s, is a friend of mine,” he said easily, drinking his coffee.
Steve followed Tony to their room to find out what had happened.
“Thanks,” he said, so completely devoid of emotion that it caught Steve off-guard. “Anyway, I should probably get there and open it before I can’t afford to keep it.”
Dmitri turned to Tony. “Of course.” He told Dugan to eat all his food before he got back and Dugan just laughed and asked for a hot pie from the place near James’ house. Dmitri nodded and left.
Tony opened his mouth, ready to make a joke but then he closed it and reconsidered. This wasn’t the time.
“To being needed. I guess.” Tony gave him a weak smile and drank his water slowly. The little physical contact did a lot to comfort him and ease his pain.
“I can’t be involved in what doesn’t exist, Rogers. I’m trying to
“You’re… I’ve… never... good god—" He was so nervous and scared but also full of love and in need of a lot more. “You’re the first fella I’ve had these kind of feelings for that I noticed. But looking back, I was relieved when Tommy told me how he felt. And I think my mom saw it in me too.”
Dugan took out a notebook from his suit pocket and thumbed through the pages, shaking his head after a moment.
Sometimes it hit him. It always happened at the strangest moments too with seemingly no trigger other than Clint’s very existence. That horrible, nauseating dread that he had felt when he first realized Clint was taken. The same awful feeling that had kept him up at night during the hours when he was reminded of Bakuto’s insanity and found himself praying that Bakuto not kill them, not his Clint. Not Tony either but, dammit, not his Clint.
“Maybe it’s not the worst thing ever,” Natalia said, her finger moving around the rim of her martini glass, a small, private smile on her lips. Clint knew that smile.
Tony looked down at the phone on the table, the napkin it was resting on muffling the vibration. He snatched it up and then looked up at Rhodey who rolled his eyes and motioned for him to answer it.
“Thank you, love,” Steve said, still thinking about what Tony had said. He was right and wrong. While Steve had no problem doing business with others like himself, he wasn’t as open about having contacts like James was. He had too many people to risk putting in harm's way. James, on the other hand, did not. Maybe now he did, but Clint and Natalia could more than take care of themselves. But Tony? Sarah?
James and Steve came in slowly, first turning on the light switch that was located outside the room. It was suddenly too bright and Clint and Tony winced but didn’t look away from Steve and James.
Tony felt someone touch him, which was something that would always wake him immediately no matter how much pain he was in. Everything hurt and he felt cold but when he looked up and saw Clint, albeit blurry and only for one second, he nearly smiled.
Tony took Steve’s hand to get up but stopped him from going straight to the door.
He knew he missed Tony more than words could say but could he really not control himself? Maybe this level of perversion wasn’t right. Maybe he
No one mentioned his distant behavior and Tony was foolish enough to hope that maybe they hadn’t noticed. One look into Steve’s eyes told him that that was not the case.
Clint fell silent. He turned to James, opened his mouth and closed it again. He frowned, staring down at his feet under the blankets and then sighed, laying back down and holding the paper up over him to read it.
“I said that you have no idea what you mean to me. And that I wouldn’t have anything left if you weren’t here. You’re my whole world,” he translated. “
Benni was upset that he was disturbed while practically glued to the radio but there was no way that Tony was letting him eat while laying on his stomach on the carpet. Before he settled on the couch with Steve, he poured him a glass of whiskey. It was part of their evening routine.
Steve sighed, not planning on answering, so James just punched him in the arm. “
“You relax,” Steve said with a shrug and finished his plate. “And get ready for us to head out.”
“Exactly. And he’s never much liked us.”
,” Tony whispered, running his hand over the counter. He wouldn’t go back there, not if he could help it. He was about to get back into the car where the others were waiting for him when someone yelled his name.
felt like an infatuated high schooler.
“Hello,” Benni said, looking down and then up at Sarah. “We’re making soup. Do you want soup?”
Tony wanted to make a joke about how strong Steve was and about how much he loved that but it didn’t feel right. There was a lot for both of them to work through but he didn’t want to do it separate from each other.
Steve sat up, leaning on the desk, watching James carefully. “James,” he began and James knew that tone. That worried, knowing tone. “Yesterday when you said you shouldn’t have bothered Clint at all. What’d you mean by that?” Steve had the feeling that James was suffering a lot more than he was letting on.
While James cooked, Clint played with Lucky, talking to the dog and occasionally looking over at the man by the stove.
“You two were so good together back in the day.”
Clint sat back. He had been afraid of that response. He could understand being hesitant but it still frustrated him, though he did his best not to show it.
“You’ll see when you do.”
If someone had told Tony that kisses could say more than words, he wouldn’t have believed it. Until Steve kissed him. It was difficult to focus on words once Steve stopped. The sudden loss of Steve’s lips and tongue was awful, making him whine ever so slightly.
Steve knew he liked women and men but he also knew that within that he still had a preference and he was damn tired of not being able to have with a man what he was allowed with a woman.
He had been up and down a lot lately, more downs than ups unfortunately. He knew James was probably getting tired of it even if he would never say that or even let it show on his face. He had to have been! Who
“I do. If you’re looking to move up, what better way than to kill your sexually deviant boss?” Sarah gave him a look but he was too upset to back down or retract his statement.
Tony couldn’t bring himself to remind Steve that Benni would be at school until early in the afternoon. So he simply smiled and went to the kitchen with him, preparing coffee for them. Somehow he wasn’t in the mood for breakfast. The fluttering that usually only lasted a few moments didn’t want to stop or so it seemed, making it impossible to even consider eating anything.
Seeing as this was his place of business and not his home, he had no personal belongings or paraphernalia. She knew in his home office that he had a whole row dedicated to his parents and another for Sarah and Steve. Not here. James might not be someone many—or any—wanted to challenge but while the Russians took loyalty to a whole new level, they did the same of volatility.
“Steve,” he said softly, his voice still shaky. “Wake up. It’s noon.” He moved to open the curtains the rest of the way, effectively waking him up, and then Steve rolled onto his back, one arm covering his eyes and now showing off his
Clint shook his head. “If I had just listened—”
“Sir, I—” Cap pulled the trigger. A moment later Dugan and Falseworth came in and dragged him out. Jones came in afterwards to do cleanup. Cap cleaned his gun again and put it away, closing the drawer. He stood, checking his pocket watch. It was about time for his weekly drink.
Clint hummed, nothing to add to that. James hadn’t spoiled him, he was just a prideful dumbass sometimes who should learn to be taken care of.
“No, you’ll take one now. I won’t have you stinkin’ up my kitchen.” He thought about arguing that it was
“Most are mine. Some I bought new.”
It was so casual, so normal. Steve got up without hesitation, not having to fear for Tony and then right there was James too. “I’m okay,” Tony answered. “Clint is a great guy, James.”
“I…” He hesitated. The sex was great, fantastic, best Tony had had in who knows how long but Steve was also just sweet and polite and funny. “I don’t know but it’s—I don’t think this is a one and done kind of thing. I mean, he asked for a second date.”
“I don’t think I’ve seen you this shaken up before,
“I always wondered what happened to him. The family claimed he’d died,” Steve said. “Real nice of your ma. She sounds lovely.”
James greeted Sarah and nodded to Tony and Benni before showing them to their rooms. Sarah seemed exhausted and she excused herself.
She came back into the room with two of James’ men each carrying a hospital food tray. They sat them down on the table, she thanked them and they left, smiling. Who couldn’t Sarah Rogers charm?
,” Tony said softly and pulled him in his arms. “
“Just another day in the life of a mob boss,” he said somewhat bitterly. He knew this was the life he chose, which meant he chose the problems that came with it, but that didn’t mean he had to like it. “Someone is after James, trying to take him down. Everyone in our world,” he said, referring to the organized crime world, “knows we work together. So if they’re after him, they’re after me.”
James laughed. “Maybe. I’ll never tell.”
Pepper raised her eyebrows at his rambling but he just shrugged and moved on to another topic.
“Really?” Steve asked, sounding even more surprised. “Huh.” Steve wasn’t much around kids but he liked them. He knew
“So far we’ve narrowed it down to seven warehouses,” Natalia said, coming into James’ office where Dmitri was at his desk scratching off numbers and putting an X over locations on the map that were still in business and therefore not the restoration company they were looking for.
Clint was a million miles away in his own thoughts but brought back to the here and now by Tony’s voice. “Hm? Oh, yeah, of course. I’m gonna sit for a little while longer.” He moved his arm so Tony could get up more easily. Lucky perked up at the movement, his ears raising slightly.
Steve nodded, taking in the information. He watched Tony reach for his own coffee, not using the hand Steve hand come to assume was his dominant one. Steve frowned again. “Something the matter with your wrist still?”
Clint went out into the bar, hands on his hips, and looked around. It was clean and orderly and ready to go. There was literally nothing else for him to do but open
Steve still couldn’t get his eyebrows to completely unfurl after hearing Tony in pain but he did his best. “I’m alright. A little tired but nothing serious,” he told him, careful about where he placed his hands on Tony, not wanting to hit a sore spot. He tilted his head up some to look at Tony, trying to memorize every inch of his face just because. “You?”
Bucky inhaled deeply, mirroring Steve’s stance. “Seems that way. This is the fourth diner in almost as many months. Pathological arsonists can be very ritualistic: same type of place, time of day, same materials set up in the same way—this person turns the gas on and leaves the ovens open. Using a timing device connected to wire cutters which are positioned over an electrical wire, when the device goes off, the room is full of gas, the cutters snip the wire causing a spark and boom. The whole place goes up in flames,” he explained.
“It’s perfect. Thank you.”
“I’m surprised he told you about that. He seemed annoyed that I did it.”
“Hi. James and Nat have both told me you’re the coolest person in the house,” Clint said, putting on a friendly smile. “I’ll eat anything but concrete and even then a little ketchup could change my mind.” He winked at Benni and James chuckled beside him.
“I just want you as safe as possible. If there’s anything I can do to ensure that, tell me,” Tony said.
They were tipsy, warm, and a little giddy for no reason, both excited to see their fellas after a long, exhausting day. The alcohol in their systems helped alleviate the weight of their earlier discussion but they hadn’t forgotten their resolutions—to talk to Clint and Tony, to explain a little about what they were feeling and the worries they had.
remembered the night, but he didn’t remember falling asleep. When he woke up, James was lying beside him, an arm curled around him protectively like it always was, and Clint’s leg elevated carefully on a special pillow. His ribs were pretty much healed already.
Even Clint was tired of himself feeling this way.
Steve threw his hands in the air, exasperated. It had been so long since he and James had had a one-on-one like this that he’d almost forgotten they were pretty evenly matched in the hardheadedness department.
,” Tony said when she came into the room. “Welcome home. Dinner is cooking, I’m going to check in with Steve. Benni is in the kitchen with Clint.” He kissed her cheek and helped with her coat. His politeness won over his need to check up on Steve.
“Oh,” Steve said with a laugh and Tony gave him a quizzical look. “I think that was mostly for me.” Tony’s expression grew more confused.
He knew that arson was a difficult catch and next to impossible to prove without DNA but this was infuriating.
“If I misread this, don’t stress, you can say n—”
“Oh, yeah, so I live in 234. It’s the exact same apartment down the street. My roommate got tired of me banging relentlessly on the door when I go out for drinks so we have a system. I climb the fire escape and he leaves the window unlocked. It’s also his failsafe that I don’t get too drunk or else my ass is screwed,” he said with a laugh, looking for his phone.
Tony stopped and looked at Steve, who waited for him to say something.
Benni thought about it while he put everything away neatly and then turned to Tony and shrugged. “I just like learning.”
They ate meals together, sometimes inviting Natalia and Maria over. Dugan, Jones and Dmitri would pick up Benni after school some days and take him for ice cream or some treat before bringing him home. Tony still didn’t want to go outside but Clint didn’t mind because trying to navigate the world on crutches was annoying anyway and it was too cold for it still. Besides, James really didn’t like the combination of crutches and icy ground and even though he never said it, Clint understood and respected his concern.
They had passed the warehouse in question and parked two blocks away, leaving the ambulance in an alley where it wouldn’t draw attention. It was too dark and cold for anyone to be out anyway.
James wasn’t scared. Only one thing scared him and that was losing his loved ones, not his own life. And honestly, that wasn’t the reason for his hesitation now. It was a different concern, one he would not normally have.
“So what was all of that about with Bucky?” Tony asked when Steve came over to search for a snack with him.
Not long after they arrived back at James’ office and were going over the documents gifted to them by Gao, the phone rang. Dmitri answered, immediately tensing and looking over at James.
Loads of times, doesn’t that count for anything?”
Instinctively, Tony curled his fingers around Clint’s. He tried to say something, or at least move his lips for Clint to read, but he didn’t have an ounce of strength left and passed out again.
He asked, his brain too foggy for English. He knew he was in a hospital but he wasn’t sure which one. “
“Benni,” Tony called after his brother had already left the kitchen, “
“Save that for Steve. Speaking of, you never did tell me what he has planned for tonight and please, if it’s x-rated, don’t tell me.”
There was more silence and then, “I’m deaf, you stupid fuck. What do you want—”
after him? James, I—”
From where Tony was sitting he looked at Steve, his brows furrowed, feeling more frustrated than he cared to admit. “What is? The fake account for me to notice? Some kind of test to see how long it would take me?”
“Rest your head,” he told him, gently guiding it back down onto his shoulder and then taking his hand. “Since I’ve been back, I only take these out to shower. The silence is… too much.” He sighed again and carried on. “It’ll make him feel better if you talk to him, though. We both know that. For now you can talk to me. If you want.” He squeezed Tony’s hand lightly.
Clint raised an arm to rest over James’, tapping it and James raised his head enough to see Clint sign ‘are you okay?’
“She did?” He put a blanket on his lap. “Well, let me get you coffee.” Despite what he said he didn’t move away. It had been too long since he had seen Clint. Eventually he managed to turn away and make coffee for them both, bringing cookies that Sarah and Benni made yesterday.
Dmitri tensed before James did. “I… where?”
Clint turned his head at a strange sound and then realization dawned on him and Lucky poked his head around the corner, looking for Clint. He wagged his tail when he spotted him and came into the room to curl up at Clint’s feet in front of the fire.
“I missed you too. So much, all the time,” Steve said, tilting Tony’s chin up to kiss him before he answered. “They’re fine, both of them and eager to see you too. Whenever you’d like and Dugan or Jones can go pick them up.”
Steve inspected it for a moment and then smiled and nodded. “Looks a charm, Pinky. Cheers. What do I owe you?”
“It’s alright. It’s made for an interesting morning. Don’t stress. See you soon.” He gave it back and Rhodey said something brief to Tony and hung up.
“I’m glad you’re back,” he sighed and helped Clint sit up. “For a minute I thought I’d never see you again. And would you believe that all I could think about was how I’ll never get to see you clean-shaven and in decent clothes?”
“Good morning, Ms Rogers.” She gave him a look and he corrected himself. “Good morning, Sarah.” She saw no need for formality with those whom she considered close to her and her son.
“I…” Steve could count the number of people on the planet who had ever seen him blush on one hand. Tony was one of those people as now Steve’s cheeks went a deep crimson. “I saw someone else do it. Made me wonder if you might want mine.” It wasn’t a lie but it wasn’t the
“Going on a month now.”
“He’s smart.”
“Mornin’,” Steve called and James paused and turned around. “He okay?”
“That’s real sweet of you.” Steve reached out to take Tony’s hand and press a kiss onto the back of it.
“It doesn’t matter where it started. You could have gone with what you had. But instead you made improvements and helped people.” He looked at him again despite the feeling of embarrassment and shame about the money on the floor, next to the two pieces of paper Steve had given him. He had seen that. Why did that thought make Tony’s eyes fill with tears? “I’m stubborn like that. It was giving up or stealing and saving whatever I could.” He leaned back against Steve and took a shaky breath.
“Do you… do you want this?” Steve asked, kissing him again too. “Please don’t just do this to make me happy or because you feel bad for me. I need you to want this too or I don’t want it.”
Benni pouted, he wanted to go with Steve and Tony but he had school. Steve laughed and told him that if he ever wanted to come to work with Tony and Steve he would
He turned to Tony and said, “Benni told me to ask you how you really slept since I’m… the biggest… brother.” Steve tried his hardest to think of another way to put it and then he turned to Benni to answer his question himself and stop this madness. “He slept, alright. Didn’t even hear me come in to play music.” Which was not a lie.
