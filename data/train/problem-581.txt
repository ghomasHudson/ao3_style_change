John already had a hand hovering at his side in case he needed to shoot whomever he found inside, but once entered the presence of the current occupant was unnerving enough to cause him to again pause in the motion of defense.
to be worth I suppose.” Sherlock replied back, mockingly.
After the last board, Lestrade placed his hands behind his back to allow himself a stretch that easily popped a few bones before he turned around to notice that John had been watching him. Blinking those oddly yellow-gold looking eyes, he then turned an award winning smirk on and ran his fingers back through his silver and pepper colored hair.
Feeling guilty, John heaved himself to standing, looking over to where Sherlock was now standing next to Sarah in the dark. Barely able to tell that the taller Familiar was leaning over and attempting to softly pet her shoulder. Noticing John’s look, Sherlock turned his head from the sobbing woman to regard John for a mere second before looking down the now empty stone alleyway, where both ears slowly perked from dark curls in a wistful expression, the woman was long gone.
“She has pretty handwriting.” John mentioned as an afterthought.
John mentally tossed in the towel.
When John had taken that moment for himself to enjoy his tea, he looked over the top of his mug to watch the detective on the couch. Sherlock was laid out with his head still leaning against the armrest, folded hands on his bare chest,for a portion of his gown had fallen down and was barely brushing against the floor. His tail was slung back over the backside of the couch again, with the tip out of view, but John could mentally see it twitching in thought. Pulling his gaze back up, John watched both ears gently flicking atop the dark curls.
“Dave, its going to be alright, we are going to make it through this.” He said, ushering up enough courage to give the dying man a lopsided smile, even as the blood continued to gush through his fingers.
I love you all for taking your time, for reading my little AU.
“We need to go to the bank.” Sherlock suddenly stated in mid-turn, and was already throwing his coat on.
“Pity. I haven’t mentioned a figure.”
With a sigh and a shake of his head John simply moved deeper into the room and over to one of the unoccupied chairs, with a fluff of the pillow adorning it he flopped down, and instinctively went to rub over his knee while looking back up to Sherlock whom had apparently went back to his ‘dusting’ and was currently brushing a hand over the curtains of the main window. With all the good that would actually do.
“The police don’t consult amateurs.”
Concade didn't say anything at first, continuing to watch John’s reaction and appeared to be mentally deciding on the next course of words as to believe if what his patient was saying was true or not. Finally, he looked down to his clipboard while putting the fork back into his pocket. After, he grabbed a pen that had been clipped on the side and began writing down quick notes.
“Really Sherlock, you know I adore your violin….most of the time anyways, but must you really play at all hours of the night? Even an old woman like me needs her beauty sleep!”
“Do you want to look at my tail, after?”
“Or, how much it
“Exactly.” Sherlock had pointed in John’s direction after with the same happy look, both ears twisting forwards at the sound of his voice. “That is why I already moved in.”
With that said, and before John could defend his sexuality further she had already stepped into the kitchen with a slightly muffled ‘Oh Sherlock! The mess in here...’, and the sound of scattering glassware could be heard.
No response. What did he really expect?
Sherlock answered him by giving a single flick of his tail that thumped softly against the couch. Not quite as dramatic as his other form, but very similar.
“Tea.” Sherlock replied.
“Experiment.”
But I couldn't help myself with at least adding a little bit of dark to the end. Heh.
Twisting the phone in those long digits, Sherlock turned the back of the phone in John’s direction, as if he didn't know what was already engraved there.
Sarah on the other hand, had backed herself as close to the opposite wall once he’d been let free, one hand over her mouth as she stared shockingly at John, and she was not the only one.
Thank you again my few readers, you mean the world to me!
“This one did.”
Sherlock turned while continuing to play, having opened his eyes and was now watching John. The two of them met each other with similar gazes, during that earlier line of the song.
“Oh! Sorry, sorry.” John muttered, while still looking up at both ears that were turned and had both curved insides pointed directly at him, though now they seemed to be twitching, just barely.
“Whittington Hospital.”
Instantly the pistol was nearly thrown to the side as the woman darted her entire body around to aim, and fire at both the sound and the shadowed figure directly straight at the end of the alleyway. Sherlock threw his body to the side of the wall to dodge and quickly hid himself among the shadows.
In their candle lit refuge John found himself laughing along with Sherlock, and when John’s dinner arrived shortly after he found himself feeling rather warm and cozy in Sherlock’s presence as the younger man simply sipped from the single water he had ordered. The meal was rather good actually, whatever it was that Sherlock had ordered for him. The darker portions of the day were forgotten amongst the light conversation of deduction tactics that Sherlock was more than happy to inform him of, and John drank them in like a dying man back from the desert in search of water.
have started, and instead he was pulling himself up from the bed, grabbing a change of clothes, and heading out to the small hallway that connected his room to the stairwell. There was really no need to be quiet now anyways, so when John stepped into the empty living room, he turned his head down the hallway that connected to the kitchen.
As John was mouthing the words ‘
After, he simply rounded a palm out towards the table in front of him where two bottles sat. A small pill sat inside each tiny glass prison.
The taller gentleman slowly leaned back, the smirk finally removed without violence and gave the smallest huff of impatience.
“Well, who was the first then?”
“S-sorry...please. Continue.” John found himself stammering, leaning forwards to put his tea on the table and hoping the movement would hide the blush that he felt from the warmth in his face when he’d been heard.
“And that is?” John pulled his laptop from his lap to place it on the table, leaning forwards closer to Sherlock in his interest.
“Hm. Thank you?”
“This is my friend, John Watson.”
” Sherlock stated again as if his word were complete law.
John sighed and gave a small shake of his head while Sherlock stamped his way back to the couch. Before the Familiar had a chance to re-enter his sulk though, John made sure to at least give the conversation a second chance. He was interested after all.
“Piss off!” Sherlock replied, with a clear laugh.
Speaking of easily annoyed, though…
“You have got to be kidding me…” Lestrade muttered shortly after, letting out a deep sigh afterwards, and turning back to look at Sherlock and John.
“I happen to know of a nice little place in London…” With a smirk, he looked up from his phone and in John’s direction. “I believe we should be able to afford it together.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can also tell you about your military career with your one leg, face, and hands. Also, your brother’s drinking habits with your phone.” Challenge accepted.
Sherlock gave a hissed growl, a sound that startled John with the animalistic quality the angered sound made. Twisting, he charged back out of the room and was enveloped into the dark of the building, leaving John and Soo Lin without as much as a look.
He rolled his eyes at the memory of the fight he had with the scissors he had used to do so, having to wear a pair of the gloves to even allow himself to make the other pairs more comfortable without shocking himself in the process. There had been cursing involved in the act.
Propped up on his elbows with the covers of his bed twisted about him, John gave a small sigh to the quiet walls of his current bedsit. Closing his eyes he took a moment to attempt to deal with the quiet the room gave him, how it etched itself into the detailed lines of his current situation. It was a defining factor that John wished wouldn't remind him of well...anything.
John awoke what felt like minutes later to the vibration of his phone going off in his pocket. Nearly jumping out of his seat he found Sherlock having found his way back to the couch, clicking through his own phone. The Familiar raised his gaze just slightly to peer at John’s erratic movement before he looked back down, the white glow from the cellphone making his eyes flicker oddly.
, normal. It changed
Sherlock was softly drawing out the tones across his violin, his body having begun to sway at some point, along with his tail. The black furred appendage was carefully swishing back and forth in tune with the melody that Sherlock was doing his best to draw out from memory.
“Today just keeps getting better, and better…” Sherlock muttered darkly before turning away from his brother and head over to his couch, only to pause and glare down at Lestrade. “Off.”
John knew better than to run, if he wasn't going to get shot by the damn bird hybrid then his attempt to flee to a better position was just going to get him shot by someone,
John lay slumped halfway over his chair, breathing heavily as he stared at the body he had attacked. It was only Sherlock’s hand suddenly thumping down onto his shoulder from which the detective used to hoist himself up and off the floor did John even remember that Sherlock had been mere inches from death, because of him.
Instead, Sherlock was savagely interrupted by the second figure from before. The man jumped from the shadows with a unrestrained cry as he attempted to tackle Sherlock.
“What about you though?” Mike leaned forwards and gave John a sideways questioning glance. “Are you staying in town, then? Just until you get sorted?”
John liked to think he was a brave man, but even he flinched on opening the fridge door.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is that what?” He asked, seeming to do his best now to try to simplify his tone.
“Well you are just out of luck, I left it in my coat.” Mike responded after a few pats to his empty pockets.
Giving a mental shrug, John also turned towards his own window and was taking the quiet moment to go over the day’s events while the lights of the city flashed over his vision when the cab took to the streets. It was easy enough to get lost in the flashbacks of following Sherlock around during the day. The murder, meeting Lestrade, and so forth. It was only when his thoughts deepened into the dark halls of the college, only to follow up with the white glare of his gunshot did John frown and lower his vision to the street itself running past. John could understand why he had done it, well, mostly. How, was another matter entirely. John was used to running on instinct, but this entire situation was different in a way that he wasn't quite sure he was comfortable with.
“Oh! Yes.” John started at the change of conversation. “You saw that?”
“Sherlock? Do you know something we don't?”
“Fine, and please, language John. We are in public.” Sherlock nodded with a small wave of his hand at the others in the room before sweeping past John to move towards Sarah and their seats they had purchased. “I am hoping though, that this show will speak for itself.”
” He muttered softly to himself.
“You’re not haunted by the war, Doctor Watson ... you miss it.” The smirk from before turned into a normal smile. Well, as normal as this man could muster.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It...it wasn't really working out for me.”
“Obvious. Research.” Sherlock let his grin fall, and gave John his usual
A coughed giggle through clenched teeth was all he got at first. The other Familiar was quickly dying, the still smoking hole in his chest leaving burned scorch marks into the surrounding flesh where the cloth covering it had burned back on impact. Jeff Hope’s eyes had rolled back into his head, his cap having been lost in the attack to let the black streaks from his eyes slide all the way back through his white hair in the obvious marks of his other form. A hiss through his teeth was the last breath he got to take before he made his exit off his own mortal coil’s stage.
Briefly the other man paused in his clicking to look up at John under a few fallen curls with that same blue gaze from before. For some reason, John suddenly felt the urge to swallow, but…
“It...it was just here!” John flustered, flashlight again pointed at the now very blank brick wall.
“Maybe not too obvious to the simple folk in the room.” John replied sarcastically.
“The engraving?” John asked, already knowing the answer though. Was he grinning? Yep, he was.
Sherlock had indeed removed his clothes, and they were neatly placed folded on the end of the couch. In the middle of the couch though, was something that John had not been expecting at all.
John squared his shoulders back against the brick and frowned up into that gaze with one of his own. All earlier thoughts forgotten.
“No, not at all.” Concade quickly replied. “As a late-bloomer of your age,” John winced at this. “we will be needing to make sure that you are able to function at the best of your ability. We can't simply let you out without you sorting out every electrical device you stroll past can we?”
“I...I just thought...you...me…” John stuttered, unable to form a proper sentence.
The two of them found themselves looking at one another silent for a pause after John’s answer. It wasn't as if there was a better reply to that question other than simply stating the fact, and while John glanced downwards awkwardly after, Mike cleared his throat.
“On one condition.”
Sherlock on the other hand, was having none of it. Refusing to look back, the feline stopped at his closed bedroom door and head-butted a section of the bottom wood. John realized very quickly amidst his tear-stained gaze that Sherlock had a some point built himself a small and unnoticeable cat door to his room. A piece of wood swung open into the room, and Sherlock pounced inside as quickly as possible.
“And what smell would that be?” Ignoring the fact that Sherlock had well, sort of said that he smelled alright.
John glared up at the fire escape ladder that Sherlock had jumped to as if the piece of rust covered metal was the source of all the current issues that John was currently having mentally to this situation. He was not about to admit even to himself that a part of his pride had been wounded when the Familiar had jumped and caught hold of the ladder as if he was just as easily reaching up to grab a tea cup off a high shelf.
“Going to stand precisely there all morning, are we John?” Came the baritone voice from the couch.
” Was his again, muffled answer. At least he was able to hear it this time.
“Sherlock!” Came a man’s pleased sounding voice inside.
“Going to try to make the head talk by pushing air up through its neck and moving the tongue around?” John mentioned, offhandedly. Withholding the sigh he wanted to emit, because by this point one must press on into the eye of the storm, he thought.
“I don't believe I will be taking away your friend, little brother. At least, not tonight..”
“Right.” Sherlock mimicked, not taking his eyes off John.
While John watched Sherlock re-put the folders exactly where they had originally been after the half hearted dusting, he picked up some envelopes that had been sitting near by and walked over to the fireplace, grabbing a small knife that had been placed there to stab the offending envelopes down. At this, John noticed something else, and he lifted to point the end of his cane at it towards the mantle.
“How about a cuppa? You just rest your leg, dear.” With that she attempted to turn back to the kitchen.
, are going to show up Tuesday, and tell them the bag was
The woman gave him a sudden fiery filled glare before John found himself with a pistol being drawn near his temple. Where the hell had she drawn that from?!
” in their direction. Normally, John would have instantly apologized, but with the lack of sleep and his previous ideas of how the date would end being completely ruined now, he glared back at the irritated audience and silently dared anyone say anything else.
And where was Sherlock now? That...
“When you were brought to our location,” Concade continued after writing. “We had to do our best to deal with your situation without bringing further complications to your position. We even had to find a non-metal needle to get that in.” He pointed with his pen to the IV line that was coming out of John’s right arm. “Our facility is normally prepared for the differing situations with patients of the magical persuasive, but even yours was a more complicated case.”
“Dare it be me that attempts to prove you wrong. But yes, I have a date, tonight actually.” John grinned over at his flatmate in what he figured was his own show-off moment.
“Hardly, I made sure it happened.” Sherlock was giving him what could be almost described as a sweet smile now. If that wasn't creepy, John wasn't sure what was.
Giving another mental look over the notes he had found from earlier, now mentally stashed away with his other musical scores, Sherlock let his body straighten, closed his eyes, and carefully drew the bow across the strings to begin to play.
Even in his shock, John’s brain did catch up to the Chinese woman’s words though.
There was one other slightly guilty pleasure John had…and to bloody hell with it.
“Sherlock!” John yelled while snatching his hand back, only to find the detective himself had been thrown back into the couch with such force that the entire thing had fallen over backwards, with Sherlock included, now with his feet pointed at the ceiling.
“Oi yourself!” The cab driver called from the front driver’s seat with a scowl into his rear-view window.
Somewhere else, even farther from there, a hissing laugh could have easily been heard shortly after.
“Oh no need to worry about that dear, all sorts around here.” She mentioned, though paused before actually moving into the kitchen to look at him, lowering her voice to a scandalous whisper. “Mrs. Turner next-door has
John was done playing this game until he had a nice hot cuppa in his grasp though. Maybe something to eat along with it, and so he opened the fridge to browse its intake.
Needless to say, he used John’s gun to point at the wall, to John’s stunned disbelief.
"A what?". Taking his eyes away from the curve of John's lips is always a struggle.
‘I’m not the man you thought I was. I’m not that guy. I never could be.’
‘Hey, if you changed your mind…’ You don’t finish. I have plunged myself at you from the first word. Clingy. Great. My nose in your hair, near your ear, fingers gripping at your well-tailored suit. I’ll crumble it. Mustn’t. Not good. I pull back with a shaky breath, not meeting your eyes but hearing the surprise in the small gasp that leaves your lips.
Sherlock's POV
“Dunno”
John turns to look at him, then, shifting a little to lie on his side and prop his head on his elbow. Sherlock is annoyed, but not at all surprised, to find his breath catching. It is not the first, or the last time, when John is this close.
“So?”
‘I know. Neither am I.’ It’s a little consolation really. I know there’s not a ‘mind’ to be changed. The decision was taken years ago. We just waited patiently to finally officiate it. Still, my mind and heart feel more at ease with those words coming out of your lips, formed vowels and consonants, clear and true. Spoken. Will the doubts ever go away? Look at me, I’m pathetic. More than five years have passed since our first kiss and I’m still losing myself over fleeting doubts that you’d leave me, you won’t want me anymore. That’s absurd. You deserve so much more than that. I need to have faith in you.
Ah, amazing. You know what, John Watson? Piss off.
You. Still. Do.
‘Happy Birthday.’
John nodded. His jaw had clenched.
“But last night I knew… I knew that me not voicing them was selfish. The thought of never having said them, of losing every opportunity to paralyzed me. You have been through impossible situations, John, and yet you chose to be here, with me. The notion of me not giving you enough, not giving you what you deserve… I don’t want to feel it again”
Sherlock's POV
‘Did I…?’ I couldn’t go on… Had I blacked out? Had I hurt you? I observed your face and your lips, your eyes and neck and whatever was showing from the few unbuttoned inches of your shirt, begging for a sign. Nothing. Yet I didn’t rejoice. Marks could be left in far more private and dangerous places. Bruises that marked far more humiliating possession than the one that was shone right to your face by a cut on the lip or a nipple on a shoulder. Marks deliberately placed in places of absolute secrecy. Wounds that indicated bluntly how someone was never touched lovingly anywhere but brutally only in the places needed like an animal and then left to heed and heal its own wounds alone.
“What?”, John’s groggy voice sounded genuinely confused.
“When I asked to split up…”
‘I know.’ My head leans to one side and I smirk playfully, myself again.
‘I’m not changing my mind.’ Dear God, I sound like a petulant child. Your smile grows. How do you do that? After all those years and you just…
Of course, when he had managed to come around, he had denied any shock to John. He had said he had been mildly surprised, and that his mind palace had done that thing again, where he
‘Of course, love. But I know she’ll be fine, you know why?’
“Say what?”
Sherlock winced, and the lip he was worrying between his teeth tore and bled. “Yes”
‘Looking forward to it.’ I’d really like to see you. Yes. Maybe. But the irony creeps up. Keep it up, Holmes. Anger is all I have.
‘Mm?’ I prompt with a slight eyeroll. You know it’s affectionate.
Sherlock does. Reluctantly.
Clothes had been removed somewhere along the way. And a number of other things had ensued.
‘Never knew when your birthday was.’
Sherlock bit his lip again.
Now it feels empty. It gnaws on me and eats me from inside. You vowed to be with a woman for the rest of your life. You want that. A family life. Quiet. Peaceful. Straightforward. You don’t want me there. This honour now feels hollow. You wanted me here as a goodbye. To look at me in the eye when you say the words and crush every bit of me into tiny pieces. You wanted to make sure, I understand and stay away. It must be that. That’s what you wanted. Didn’t you? But you didn’t know. You weren’t cruel. You never knew. What I’m thinking is unfair. No, maybe it’s not. You should know. You should observe. If you didn’t know, it’s because you didn’t want to.
Sherlock nodded, what was bound to be a very goofy smile permanently etched onto his lips.
‘Um… Can you grab some orange juice for the little one, please?’ I semi-shouted towards the phone so you can hear me. Apparently, you caught my uneasiness as always but what you didn’t understand was that I had you on speaker so you continued cheerfully.
, to say it, admit it, shout it from the rooftops if he had to (on second thought, no, better no rooftops for his love declaration to John Watson). It crowded the breath in his lungs, clung onto his tongue, burned his palate. Nothing. Nothing. He simply couldn’t.
“I just started to the melody of your intonation. Every time you would say it to me. I suppose I wanted to catch the words in my hands, somehow. And then it just… It became easier. It became a way. I was afraid to tell you”
After I wrote this, my beloved partner in crime and beta reader xALx, pointed out to me that the relationship I am portraying between Sherlock and John at the moment is quite toxic and with a slight hint of abuse (of course! he beat him up at a morgue just some weeks before. that's not right AT ALL). However, since I added my own little twists as you see from chapter 5, even if I don't state exactly what was going on -yet- (slightly lighter than what John's thoughts suggest), the relationship will need loads of work in order to be considered healthy and able to move forward.
“You know you can tell me anyway you choose, right? Like I told you… I feel you tell me with everything you do, and it counts. But if you want a specific thing to mean that, to mean I love you between us, and only the two of us will know, then go ahead”
You. Still. Do.
“And is… is what I am… enough?”
"Um. There's... room. You could...", Sherlock's voice trails off.
some cute fluffy nerves before our boys wedding
… It will become a mantra eventually, I believe. You should know. You already know. You think you made it clear that because she died, we’re over. Your promise is over even if it was a promise of forever. You think you have been relieved from that duty. That vow. And it hurts like hell.
Hoarse voice. Just a tad. Always brings me down. You mean it. You mean it and I’m the idiot now. No, wait. I deserve to be angry about it. You promised. I thought I won’t lose you again but I did. Because you pushed me away after everything and I-
The quiet bliss was interrupted by thermoregulation issues. It was too warm beneath the covers. Enough to warrant that Sherlock kick at them until his feet could be free from their constrains, toes flexing with bliss in the cool air, like the paws of a cat.
I didn’t have your experience. But I could still hear it, see it, experience it. In my brain and in the real world.
Shit. Absolute, terrible, damned, fucking shit. I’m swearing more than I have in my whole life. Because those words aren’t meant for me. Not addressed to me. Not ever. Two simple words and we’ve both fucked them up. My lips twitch almost into a snarl which I hope can pass as a smile because I can’t handle it. I can’t. How can I still believe the world is swirling around us? How can I still hope your world is focused on me? Selfish prick. No, we are not just the two of us against the rest of the world anymore.
When finally standing -ribs protesting again- I find that I am, in fact, nervous. My gaze falls on you and my breath hitches. Your arms seem lifeless and that’s about the only part of this that actually helps me move forward. You won’t hurt me. I hope. There is electricity tingling in my fingertips. What I am about to do is beyond me. Calm down. Breathe. Relax. John is in pain. Focus. No, how could I? How can I focus? You’re my focal point. You always were. The anchor, pulling my back from the edge of the world. Preventing me to fall in the eternal abyss. That illusion is long gone now.
“What if… What if I can never say it?”, Sherlock murmured into the warmth of John’s palm as he kissed it.
"Can't get comfortable", Sherlock retorts snappishly, and tries to shift, only to end up with a leg dangling off the constricted space. He admits defeat with a whined growl.
“So… If you tap three times, it means ‘I love you’”, he said, decidedly. Sherlock was eager to tap again in reply. Their very own Morse Code.
Sherlock’s eyes shone at that, sunrays peeking through the barrier of grey cotton-clouds.
“Do you want to tell me why?”, John tried, rubbing his palm up and down Sherlock’s spine. He could feel each vertebra, a series of knuckles poking through the skin.
The rainfall continued outside, drowning the engines of the vehicles passing by, of the radiator gurgling, of Mrs. Hudson’s hoovering downstairs.
No. You’re alive in front of me.
You were angry at me. Your eyes seemed to dart flames and lightning. You were angry at me.
‘O-okay… I’d better get back to cooking.’ I managed, slightly disappointed without meaning to be. I shouldn’t crave for more really, I had some cooking to do and your sister and daughter where just behind the door.
“Yes”
I just want to say here that with this fic, I DO NOT in any way want to romanticize or portray any kind of abusing relationship as appealing. I will do my best to fix every little bit of baggage our boys carry with them and I want to make John face what he's done properly (and I want to stop hurting little Sherlock gay babe >.<). Also, I want Sherlock to stand up for himself.
‘Yes.’ I whisper and in just a moment you have kissed me again and energetically let me go at the same time.
Two words. A journey to the past.
"Oh".
"I almost bloody lost you. I am not going to lose you again". John murmurs, and cups Sherlock's cheek in a roughened, but warm, palm. The detective forgets how to breathe, and his eyes widen almost out of his skull.
“You brilliant man of mine. Do you know how amazing you are?”
But that all just take a moment of time inside my brain. The next, I’m shoved into reality. My eyes fixed at the coffee table beside me. My hand almost trembling, leaves my tea mug there without my mind’s permission. I’m standing up. Slowly. Another moment. I’m fully aware of what is about to transpire now. The moment after the next. I’m going to comfort you. Or try to. Whichever you choose to describe it with afterwards, I guess.
John stayed still as the storm grew.
John turned his body sideways, so he could see him better and smiled. “I love you”
‘No…’ my voice was almost silent. I was afraid. You knew I was and you knew why.
‘Are you okay?’ A chuckle. No. You weren’t gone. Damn it. I can’t help but look at you this time. My anger’s gone. Why now? Why should this happen now? Anger is the only thing keeping me standing. I’ve reached a new high of self-resentment and loathing. Anger is all I have. Bottled up. Hidden. Much like yours. Freed when I was high on
‘Dada, Papa!’
Breathe. It was too much effort. I had gathered up courage. Explained the case. Laid my pains bare for you. You didn’t even seem phased by it.
‘Really?’ You almost purr in anticipation. ‘Doesn’t seem like it.’
Well, if you want a goodbye, you have it all wrong. All I want is your happiness and if I convince myself that this way you are truly happy… then there’s nothing else to say. I will always feel like shit. I will sometimes look you in the eye without my walls up because you have destroyed them. I will look at you with despair like I did when I told you she was pregnant with your child, which now I know with a little bit of foresight. I won’t be able to help it. But I will stay away. Protecting you from as far as I can manage. The only bit of hope that will be kept in my heart would be the hope of avoiding humiliation. The hope that those fleeting moments I won’t be able to control, will pass by you like they mean nothing. Absolutely nothing. Don’t observe me, John. Not anymore. Take your eyes away from me forever.
‘I cheated on her.’ Awake again.
You were out of the car in milliseconds, following her wonderful small voice granting me with the deduction that you might actually be more worried that you let me know. I smiled and got out to greet our little girl, which judging by her tone she was just fine.
‘Okay.’ See that? Piss. Off. ‘Though I should mention, that it is possible for any given text alert to become randomly attached to-’
I turned surprised to hear you speak after half a day of silence.
‘Come on. Got to show you something!’ I grabbed you by the wrist leading you out of the building and, after some walking, out of the small city. You were looking at me like I was going crazy but you hadn’t objected up to know. We both enjoyed the comfortable silence that was settling between us when we felt the grass under our feet and I could see your sulking for not returning home was long gone. It seemed to me that in the end this place had come into your liking and I smiled realising I was still holding your hand and you hadn’t pulled away.
Sherlock swallowed. “I was. I am”. He felt exposed lying down, then, being naked under John’s scrutiny. He sat up, pulled the sheet around his middle. He had found that some conversation could simply not be had in nothing but flesh, needing the distance and hiding place the peel clothing could provide.
John was looking at him eagerly.
‘Of course, love! Whatever my blushed dazzling prince wishes.’
The humour had surprised John not because Sherlock was incapable of it. On the contrary, he had a good flavor for it, if not in a cruel or too sulky mood where it turned more dripping viper’s fang than his usual phlegmatic one-liners. But this was light-hearted and not self-deprecating. It was instead honest in a blunt way John was not used to; Sherlock admitting to having monsters. They had come a long way from the barricade of ‘I’m a high-functioning sociopath’. A long way from John ever thinking for a second, even the most troublesome, impossible, infuriating one, that Sherlock was a machine. They had rather entered the territory of ‘I have spent my entire life under the premise of being a freak and I am currently a little lost, please help me?’.
"Mmm?!"
‘I never meant to make you so angry again…’ I said in a tight whisper, my throat contracting tensed.
"How about a blanket fort?"
the twitching of fingers into a gentle palm’s grip.
Understood. My tea is cold. Think of something. Don’t be vulnerable. You’re a psychopath. A machine. Focus. Fix it. You already knew nothing was okay. Why didn’t you just leave it alone? Why did you have to ask? Desperation.
But whatever fears had crept up for him having ruined the moment and become decisively undeserving of such declarations ever again where hushed when John did not stop saying it. On the contrary. John would say it again and again, during the months to come. When they’d be having breakfast, lunch, dinner. When waking up or going to sleep. When Sherlock spoke, when Sherlock had not said a word. When Sherlock was being exceptionally good, when Sherlock was being frustrating. When making love, when just cuddling. In any and every occasion, John had said ‘I love you’.  And every time, it was like a tiny silver arrow piercing his heart, like the thorn of a rose prickling his palm. It
Sherlock wouldn't dare admit it, he didn't even like admitting it to himself, but given the nature of his species’s decision he was still a victim of some baser urges. He had spent years attempting to reign in a level of control that would put these nuisances of character into their place. If only he could delete his species flaws in general, but instead he had attempted to lock them away in his mind palace. Sadly, he knew how to pick locks, which meant they did too, something to that effect he supposed.
John let out a slow sigh, thrusting his hands into his pockets. Sherlock was currently too busy sniffing at a spray can they had found along the railway line, causing John to wince in sympathy to Sherlock’s brain cells. Well, the genius had enough of them to go around the city he supposed. Not that the doctor in him didn't want to smack away the can and glower at the unsuspecting Familiar. He had a feeling though, that it would be a bit not good. So instead, he decided to wander and try to put himself to better use.
John felt his eyes narrow as the night’s proceedings echoed inside his head in a jumble of sounds and emotions. Lifting his left hand he very slowly pulled at the leather covered fingers of his right, and removed the leather glove to let it flop onto the bed beside him. Slowly turning his now exposed right palm up he wiggled his fingers experimentally. Of course though, nothing untold happened from this.
John was slowly running on mere fumes by the time they made it back to the Museum. He had no idea what time it was anymore. It’d been dark hours ago it seemed after they had left the Museum the first time. After spending time at the flat with the pictures he’d taken blown up to full array, John’s body was desperately trying to tell him to sleep with every ache and yawn he fought back.
“You know that Anderson will not work with me.” Sherlock gave a grimace as if saying the very name left a bad taste in his mouth.
Behind the thin framed glasses was the only aspect that named this other Familiar as non-human, and with a hand brought up to re-perch the eye-wear correctly on his nose, it only pointed out the darkened hue of black skin covering both his eyes and reaching upwards to his brow. It could have been a tattoo of course, even if an odd one, but the hue blended near perfectly even into the aging skin of the old man as it faded to a more natural tone when the mask broke away.
“Wait a minute…
“Phone.” He stated.
With a very similar movement, and pointedly not taking the offered check from Sebastian, Sherlock had removed himself from the room with that flurry of his coat tail behind him.
Sherlock simply lifted his head out of the hidden tomb of the folder to give Mycroft a sarcastic smirk.
don't particularly smell, your personal aroma is not offending. It is the
Of course, she started to laugh almost instantly after.
John on the other hand was taking up a corner of her patient’s couch. Front legs drawn together with his cane leaning against them, both gloved hands propped up on the top of the offending crutch. The last few weeks John had learned to mostly keep his actual thoughts to himself, for he found that his attitude since the incident had leaned more towards the darker turn that life had directed him to.
Mycroft only gave a small sigh, before placing both hands back atop his umbrella and straightening his stance.
“No, what? Sherlock?” John tried calling back.
No wonder Sherlock had got angry over the milk incident.
Before he reached over to the cane propped against his bed though, he first reached over to the small bedside table where little else stayed besides the black pair of gloves had laid from the night before where he had sat them. Holding the soft material up to his face he gave the extra cloth a slight glower before he took the few moments to slip the offending pair onto both of his hands, tugging at the cut-away edge on his wrists. He remembered shredding most of the material once he had been given a box of the gloves, for they could have easily been pulled up to his elbows before. John didn't like the extra constricting feeling, and had taken matters into his own hands to shred most of the pairs down to his wrists.
” Absolutely insane. There was just...no way. “I got shot in the shoulder and I’m just now waking up and your telling me I have been out of it for an entire two months?!” Yeah, humility all but forgotten.
John found himself looking forwards to it.
“I would also suggest, that you do try to be less noticeable in the future, John, if you are going to be following around my brother. There is only so much even I can do to keep your freedom. Just a word of advice.”
John’s inner soldier was not reacting well to gunshots, and while he visibly cringed with being closer to the sound, he still was able to sling himself forwards and grab onto Sherlock’s hand that held the gun out. Luckily, he still had his gloves on.
“Of course.” John answered with a firm nod.
“Probably reading more drivel about Familiars from Non-Familiars that have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.” Sherlock droned in answer for John.
” He suddenly yelled, more to himself rather than to Sherlock’s benefit. Lifting his hand and wiggling his hands into the air dramatically, he dropped his tone to an very obvious faked version of the Familiar that was currently ignoring him.
John quickly snapped the laptop closed on hearing Mrs. Hudson’s voice downstairs, which just as quickly was only the opening act to Sherlock’s dramatic entrance into their flat with the smaller woman following on behind him. She narrowing missed getting hit with his coat as Sherlock slung the heavy material behind him and directly onto the coat hangers. From the look on his face, Sherlock was doing his best to ignore her complaint.
...” Soo Lin huffed as she did her best to keep up with John, who was still nearly dragging her.
His earlier bad mood had been erased with the development of the day, meeting Mike and the fellow named Sherlock who was supposedly meeting him later to look at a flat. A flat that they were suddenly going to be sharing together. That alone was a lot to think about, on top of the fact that apparently Mike had completely left out in their earlier conversation that the particular person also looking for a flat-share didn't happen to be all-that human.
“You did just kill a man.”
“But, couldn't Harry help at all?” Mike eventually asked more softly.
“Yes, John.” Honestly, did John forget things so easily? He was going to get rather annoyed, rather quick if he was going to have to end up repeating everything all the time, Sherlock grumbled. “I said, you could take a closer look, and that I believed it would make you more comfortable in our living conditions.”
” If John hadn't already lost his patience before…
Sherlock was already flinging himself back down onto the couch, and attempting to put the strange moment out of his mind as John’s singing had turned into quiet humming instead.
Stretching himself out along his couch, Sherlock got himself comfortable, perching both hands under his chin as he regarded the ceiling with a thoughtful glance before closing his eyes and letting out a soft sigh.
“Um...what now?” John turned back to whom he had been addressed by, only to find that the man had moved back over to the table he had been working on before, and was currently tapping away at a laptop that now adorned the table itself.
“Sherlock dear! What in the world have you done to your poor
Sherlock did not reply at first, waiting till after John had left the room and the sound of a closing door allowed Sherlock to believe his flatmate was out of earshot.
At least the situation was proving to be one that kept most of his lack of sleep in waiting. Standing behind Sherlock he leaned slowly out to look at the person huddled in the barest of light within the room. Soo Lin was similar to Sherlock in that she also appeared to have a set of feline ears atop her head. The main difference being though, that while one right ear had the same almost black hue of her hair, the other left was brilliantly colored in a flash of fire orange. John could almost make out the barest slivers of darker burnt orange stripes before the appendage folded back against her skull.
seem to be missing from the room itself.
It was hard not to when every single curl on Sherlock’s head had stuck out into a massive fringe, as if he had stuck his finger into a light socket. Just like out of the cartoons that John used to watch when he was younger. You couldn't even see his ears in the huge poof ball his hair had turned into.
“What…?”
‘Hming to himself, John shrugged and turned to step down the hallway, this gave John with a room on his left, and a room directly in front of him, which meant that the door at the end of the hall had to be Sherlock’s room.
Thank you all and now you can read on my sweeties <3
I was deadpanned. Childishly, I brought my legs up the seat to curl at my chest. My eyes were almost hurting by looking at you; wide. That couldn’t be true. It shouldn’t and must certainly not be true. Yet, you gave me a once over look with your eyes gleaming and I knew. That sentiment I had grown to understand, to see and realise and make myself believe that it truly was there. You were being affectionate, but she couldn’t be like me at all. She was only your-
The silence after a long fought and well lost battle will follow me everywhere. My life will be filled with it. I will keep finding dead bodies around my mind. I will keep burying them away. I won’t interfere in another war. The air will whistle between the leaves of the oak tree above my fake grave that will soon be filled. The flags, bloodied and torn will sag weakly over their posts. The canon holes will never be filled with new ground. All will be black. No crops will grow here anymore. Nothing new will be ever built. The fires will just slowly go out and leave this. My soul. The battlefield. Empty. Void.
he was speaking out loud, but it would turn out he wasn’t.
Wrong. I knew you wouldn’t come. I wanted to die but then I didn’t and I was scared and then you saved me and it’s all mixed up. Wrong. She just wanted to hurt me. I won’t be able to keep this up if you continue to say such bullshit, John.
‘Would complete you as a human being.’ Oh, fuck with the intonation intensity, dear. You’re ruining it.
“No. Well, maybe”
“And I’m bored”, Sherlock replied flippantly, trudging back to the bedroom with a sleepy gait, like a disoriented puppy. “I feel like staying in bed and doing skincare today. Coming?”
You’re pacing towards me and it takes all my willpower not to flinch. Not to pull away. Curl into myself and shout at you with the fury that I feel bubbling up inside me. The only chance I ever had was your promise. Oh, you’re jealous. You are jealous yet you don’t want this. You’re jealous and all you do is push me away. Or you don’t care. Not anymore. Which is more logical? The second? Yes. Agreed.
Sherlock tapped back.
In a moment, a palm was at my bicep. I straightened up, not flinching, but visibly pulling back. My fingers fidgety pretended to press the suit-collar down straight. There was no denying it. I was nervous.
Sherlock’s cheeks had been pale, not the usual flush they flared on with the chase, his black curls wild atop his head. He had said nothing but had rushed to John’s side. He had taken his hand, and held tight, the black leather of his glove gluing to his palm with heat and sweat. John had squeezed. Sherlock had squeezed back.
‘Hey, there sweetie!’ you took her in your arms, lifting her up and I stood there adoring you both while you threw her in the air and hugged her once more giggling. That was definitely something she got from you. Her laugh. Clear as crystal.
“You were safe. Weren’t you? You had promised me”
and me leaving
John’s eyebrows drew closer together, and worry lines sprang in a previously smooth forehead. “What about yesterday?”
‘Never took you for the superstitious type.’ You smiled. I could hear it in your voice even if my eyes looked down.
"You big git", John rolls his eyes and sets the mugs on the coffee table, before staring down at him, hands on slim hips. "Two heart attacks -back to back, mind you-, one open heart surgery, and one month in ICU with infectious fever, and you act like a grounded toddler".
"Oh, come on. I know you like that stuff; you had made a pillowfort once on that case in the country, because you couldn't think, remember?"
“Thai”
‘Talk about what?’ I flinch.
“Okay”, John smiled, brushing a hand over Sherlock’s curls. “Chinese or Thai?”
"I said we don't need to discuss it all now. Or ever, if you feel there is nothing else to discuss", John soothes, brushing his hand through the short curls at the back of Sherlock's neck. Oh, how wrong he is, indeed, Sherlock thinks, and his chest expands as if he had swallowed a balloon. "I just wanted to let you know... I am going nowhere. Okay?". Sherlock slowly nods again, almost like a broken doll. His brain is a mess of fireworks, and the gallop of his heartbeat in his skull -his pulse is elevated, oh- is too loud.
“I knew it”
‘Hey, what is wrong today?’ I whispered leaning close to place a soft kiss at the base of your neck. You shivered. I smiled.
I was always blushing when you were calling me names. Years might pass but I’m sure I will never grow used to this. It was even more embarrassing when I wasn’t expecting it. This time I was cooking our daughter’s favourite new specialty and so I had you on speaker while she was playing with her new chemistry set. She wasn’t big enough to understand all your name-calling completely but hearing this particular one she turned her little head to look me in the eye with almost a smug face someone could say. I shook the sensation off but it returned immediately afterwards when I realised what I was missing. Her aunt was here for dinner tonight and I was pretty sure she had never heard you sweat-talk like that before because when I turned around to put a bowl on the table she was right there looking at me with utter disbelief written all over her.
“Of course I do. You show me -you
John rolled his eyes. “Why did you give me coffee if you only wanted us to get back to bed? Why get us up in the first place? Couldn’t that mind of yours have decided earlier?”, he ranted, but he did not truly mean it. His voice was whiny and soft, conspiratorial in its mock accusations. Trying to make him laugh.
It had been fairly easy for you to finally catch our guy. In fact, you were done by the end of the day! I could see you were nervous and somewhat off. I suggested to look for a place to stay but one look at you and I knew. You wanted to go back home immediately. I managed to convince you to follow me back to an inn I had seen earlier and settled us in a room. You were standing by the window looking at the stars. I approached softly and brushed your arm.
You don’t smile when the question is posed. You don’t look at her. You didn’t even propose to her. Not really. I interrupted. Maybe I should interrupt now? No, the time for objections is passed. I didn’t speak, so why should I do it now? Drama queen. Your eyes flicker to me and you are serious. Deadly serious. At your own wedding. Excuse me if that does twist the knife a little more. Excuse me if my cracked heart clenches. Excuse me if I want to let go and faint, disappear. Because she is a choice. You had a choice. I came back and you chose her, even when it doesn’t seem as if you truly love her. A choice. A choice to avoid… Me? How can I be so selfish? After everything… to still believe-
“There is something”
‘What?’ you said while a blush crept on your cheeks.
Silence stretched over them, punctured by the pitter-patter of rain as it met with the windows and the old walls of 221B.
‘I know.’ I smiled at you, although you couldn’t see. When had I grown so overprotective and I hadn’t noticed? I sighed placing a hand above yours for a while before letting you drive properly once more. ‘I just… aren’t you worried?’
"What are you doing there, trying to break your spine?", he huffs, but there is an undercurrent of a chuckle in his tone.
Index and middle fingers drumming silently on the scratched wood of the kitchen table.
John had not been surprised when Sherlock did not say ‘I love you’ back. The first time. Or the next. And the next. He figured his genius had his reasons, and frankly, he was okay with it.  He knew Sherlock’s emotions reached deep, like water-hungry roots. And he felt them through every caress and smile, every utterance of his name, and every time Sherlock would let him have his way.
In truth, John is the one who mostly works to make the blanket fort, because Sherlock cannot carry much more than the pillows. The blankets at its base are heavy. John sets them up between their armchairs, in front of the fireplace. Sherlock mainly watches. But he has to admit he is happy to buzz around John, like a curious bee drawn to the nectar of a new type of flower. It is not that he and John did not do things together before. They would play Cluedo, and watch telly, and solve crosswords, even -that was dull-, and solved cases, of course. But a blanket fort is... different. It is cozy, and homely, and childish. It is something that makes him want to share things with John, but all are things he is not allowed to share -like he and Redbeard would play when he was little, or what his dreams used to be, or how he has always been curious if lips truly tasted like honey.
“Want to order or make something?”, John whispered against Sherlock’s neck.
There was only one way for Sherlock to love John; overwhelmingly. Immensely.
“You’ve been doing this for a while, haven’t you?”
He recognized Sherlock’s love when he saw it -or he hoped he did, more often than not. It was often subtle enough to miss, and Sherlock himself often presented it as an afterthought, or something selfish. But John knew better; what lived inside Sherlock was not a difficulty to accept his humanity for pride’s sake, or for the Work’s sake. Sherlock was not incapable of love; for crying out loud, he flushed and preened every time John told him he loved him, or called him love or dear or sweetheart, but never dared return any such word back. Sherlock had been told that he was incapable, as he had been told that he was many other things he wasn’t. And he had taken it to heart and turned it both into pain for himself and an impenetrable wall to keep others out.
Your sister’s eyes grew wide and I had to leave everything on the table and grab the phone in panic feeling the heat grow on my cheeks, almost not able to breathe anymore.
But it hurt in a
You were here. I wasn’t delusional. This wasn’t a drug-fuelled fantasy. You were here. Sitting opposite me in your usual armchair. Black shirt. Tight jeans. Dark blue. More like black as well. I bit my lip. My eyes couldn’t exactly focus on the colours. My head was spinning.
We were driving to get Rosie from school. We hadn’t moved from Baker Street of course, but we had chosen Rosie’s school to be in a friendly neighbourhood in the suburbs of London. We wanted as much freedom for her as possible, she also loved trees and playgrounds so anything else just wouldn’t do at all for our little princess. With the traffic the ride could be quite long sometimes but since it’s her first year, she wouldn’t need an extreme amount of time to study. She should be returning with the bus for the rest of the year, except if we are close by to pick her up and she loves long bus rides anyway. Besides it would serve as a nice break before actually studying. Today though, is the first day and all of us were quite anxious on how it would go. Mrs Hudson even let us borrow her car in case the little one needed cheering up.
‘John?’ It’s not a carefully constructed façade. It’s not a front. I’m almost gone. I’m almost showing you how broken I am. The anger’s gone again and I don’t have a shield or an armour to cover myself from what’s clearly coming my way. You have no right to be like this. I have given you no right. Or have I? I’m not sure… I’m never sure… Not with you…
‘But that’s the point.’
‘I love you’
Sherlock pulled the covers down to his shoulders. His eyes were slits, he could barely open them more. He held the edge of the covers with one hand and lifted it as invitation for John to crawl underneath and join him.
‘Sherlock?’ I took a step closer worriedly reaching for your other hand. Your eyes had something burning inside them, I could see. The darkness made them glitter dark blue with stars in them sparkling. You were a miracle.
of the two of us need comfort? How could you be the one entitled to it? Why do you let me be the stronger one when I am clearly not? When you owe me so many apologies and I have begged for a forgiveness I didn’t even know I needed to obtain?
“John?”
"Mmhhmm", Sherlock replies. And it is. He can finally stretch his legs, or curl up, in a place other than his bed -and so this place now seems more comfortable than his bed.
Sherlock whined in protest and threw both arms around John’s waist to stop him. They could get up and eat, face the world, buy milk (they were running out, again, and no chance he’d go to the store to buy more on his own, with all that rain). But it could wait. It could all wait.
By the time we got back into the car she was blabbing like crazy about how the teacher let them play even after the break and how she had managed to get her first honorary sticker for her drawings and she was getting around talking about all her new friends, when the first day’s exhaustion overtook her in the back seat. I turned to see her, sliding slowly into the leather with a small yawn. Your smile was something to be written permanently in history and I smirked giving you a small kiss to the cheek.
‘I’ve mean to say… always, and I never have…’ I could hear the tremble of your lips and my heart almost broke at the familiar words. All those years ago, you had tried so much… You had lost so much for my sake…  I turned on my side and tucked you into my arms. It still seemed so new. We hadn’t said the words but we had slowly converted ourselves into what we really were. And now…
John found Sherlock curled up under the covers, only a handful of inky curls showing against the pillow, like an untamed, overgrown shrub. It was a habit of his madman to burrow himself until he was almost entirely invisible. ‘Afraid of the monster under the bed?’, he had asked once; they had been watching a film, or rather John had, laptop on his thighs with Sherlock a mass of comforter, blanket, sheet beneath him. A grumpy consulting boulder. ‘No, mine lives in the closet’, Sherlock had retorted with a snort. ‘And it’s probably a skeleton’.
There was a pause. Sherlock broke free from John’s hold and looked straight ahead, toward the window. The curtain was pulled back, giving them the view of a full-bellied pale sky.
‘I mean, how does it work?’
Sherlock nodded, a small whimper ringing in his throat. There was nothing but silence and the rhythmic marching of rain for some moments.
“No”, Sherlock admitted, his shoulders sagging.
‘No. She can’t.’ I finally said.
They had taken a cab home, barely made it up the stairs in order to collapse in bed.
“Did you know?”
‘No.’
‘…again?’
‘It’s gone. It’s done. It’s not your fault.’
"I meant that, you know".
"You okay?", he asks in a small, reluctant voice, after some moments pass and John is still there.
‘Sorry’
That’s it. The last straw. You’re such an idiot. If I knew you’d react like this I would wish you never found the DVD. She’s the reason you are backing out. She’s the reason you’re ignoring all this. Us.
‘I’m sorry…’ I managed to choke out. For everything that I was.
I’m worthless. I don’t deserve anything. From anyone. Much less you. I bring your eyes in my mind, soft and translucent as you look at me with fondness. Nobody had ever acknowledged me as anything personally close to them. Nobody ever before you. Maybe it was pity. But there was a tremor in your voice and you almost said you love me, broadly speaking.
Sherlock’s lip broke free to join a smile. The clouds that had begun to find a way through the windows and over his eyes scattered.
Neither of them moved, both sets of eyes fixed on that tiny movement.
‘That’s the whole point.’ Why are you doing this…? You’re falling apart, John. Please. Not for me. I don’t-
“I need to tell you something”
"A blanket fort. You must be sick of lying in bed, and you can't get comfortable enough in the chair, or the sofa, so how about we provide an alternative for a while?"
“Mmm…”
Back when you first moved in with me, there were times I wish you would talk to me instead of letting me guess the things you wanted to say. As the time passed I started to recognise what was bothering you each time. I knew when you were suffering, I knew when you were haunted by the past. I knew when you needed me, I knew when you were trying to hide your screams into your pillows. There were nights I lay in bed looking up the ceiling wishing it didn’t separate us. There were nights I could hear your muffled cries and I had memorised the sounds of your bed when you were dreaming. There were things you said but you said them too quietly for me to hear. Your words were never meant for me. Your love was never meant for me. I just happened to pass by.
You. Still. Do.
I was thinking the worst when I looked into your sky-blue eyes and they were swimming with tears… of joy? Of anger? Of hurt? You never cried for any of the last two and I finally managed to realise you were shaking your head negatively. Your tears were of relief… maybe joy but that could be underestimating my drinking habits so relief it was.
‘Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I’ve known many people in this world, but made few friends and I can safely say-’
Sherlock makes a small sound that cannot be interpreted in any reliable way. Exhales. Nods, unsure. Fix what?
Sherlock rubbed the back of his neck, yawning, his jaw crackling with the force of it, his arms stretching above his head, elbows curving that tiny bit inwards, giving the entire movement a soft arch like a cat’s spine.
John sighed. He edged closer, until he could bring an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and guide the taller man to lean his weight against him. “Sherlock… I
, John!”
‘I’ll be home soon, sweetheart.’
Indecipherable a hum to everyone except one man, the one it was given to.
The church is quiet. The priest is reading the respective vows. The world sways to the side and I am afraid of falling apart right in front of you, begging you to stop this, as my heart splits in half. No. Not ‘splits’. Split implies quick work. If I know one thing in life is that my heart, which always belonged to you as I have realised, wasn’t split quickly, in a second, with the respective sound implied by the verb, painfully but healing right after. No. My heart was cracked. Slowly, methodically, as if by the hands of a clever surgeon. How fitting, isn’t it? Doctor Watson. It took years. Me licking my wounds or you mending them, pulling me together only to crack it a bit more right after. Or. Or waiting for me to inflict this pain upon both of us. No. Not surgeon. Jailor. Torturer, better yet. Not you. Not your fault. You just didn’t observe. You just didn’t know. It was me.
John cupped his face, guiding his stubborn man to look at him. “Then we’ll work on that. Sherlock… you are the one for me and I will not stop telling you until you believe it”
Sherlock’s breaths were punched from his chest way too fast.
“Mmmaybe?”, Sherlock’s voice twinkled.
fluff!!!
‘How does
I was drunk. I was so damn drunk. I came to your apartment in a haze. Seeking for help? Release? Safety? Even I didn’t fully know. I was drunk and I was angry and scared. I was sure if I went back home I could hit the end. I was sure I was capable of it. Of shouting at her, ruining her… If I managed to black out I could certainly hit her. I knew this rage was brewing and she didn’t have anything to do with it. She was just an innocent. Just a child. I was scared that if no one was around I could kill her and then realise and kill myself. Or better still, someone would find me the next morning drunk almost to death and I would be kept alive to suffer the consequences for the rest of my life. You would keep me alive without meaning to hurt me but it would hurt. It would be well-deserved torture.
‘Nightmare?’
“You utter madman”, John called after him with a chuckle.
‘It’s alright…’ I whispered into your ear. One hand was ruffling through your curls with adoration. You were always such a child no matter the years, no matter the sadness, no matter your incredible intelligence… I always loved that about you even when I was rebuking you for it. I wanted you to know that now. I wanted you to know so desperately. In the end, we both took in shaky breaths and spoke the words together.
I purse my lips. You come closer and the rebuke is already at the tip of my tongue but you shave it off with a soft peck. My lips prickle with energy now. Tingles. I feel them curl just a tad upwards. Yours do the same. Beautiful.
You don’t even notice, then. You get up. My chest heaves slightly. A knife reaching deeper than before. I’m hopeless. Pathetic. We had started something. You had promised something else.
Sherlock grinned at him under the covers.
“I think I will never be enough, John”, Sherlock whispered, his naturally bass voice even lower.
“John”, Sherlock rebuked softly, but John would not let him go, even though he must have turned an unflattering crimson. Consulting tomato.
John smiled. Sherlock was intending to kiss his nose, but what took place was a lick instead.
Silence. It echoes. It is what it is. And what is that? For me? Shit for you but for me it’s… Nothing. I do not know how to spend it because I don’t want to spend it at all. Not like this. Pick this up, if you can, Doctor. You promised. I’m angry. I swallow it. I’m just broken now. Again. My jaw clenches. I need the anger. Please, don’t let it slip away again. Don’t let me feel the pain.
I was pushed against the closed door of the bedroom unable to move.
I woke up the next day in our bed -no, your bed, into which I had forced my way in so many sleepless nights. There was fresh tea on the bedside table. I didn’t deserve to be here. Not even for a moment. I deserved your care and affections much less. Yet, you have never said no or tried to stop me. You never said anything. Especially on those nights. I fluttered my eyelids and you were there, looking at me with that small smile you always managed on the cold mornings.
‘What noise?’ Lower register tone. Damn it, what is wrong with me? You should know what that noise is. You should know that it doesn’t matter. You should know that my only chance ever was with-…
The grip tightened with worry. He was trembling and he couldn’t hide it anymore. Soft hushed whispers where spoken in his ear and the arms around him rubbed his skin in reassurance guiding him back to lie down under warm covers.
‘Because she’s so much like you.’
It had taken a while for John to understand that. But now that he did, he tried to help as their life together matured and grew. But the one thing he did not do, was wait. If Sherlock wanted, he would blurt it out whenever he felt like it. If he did not want, then John would say it enough times for the both of them, he would say it as many times as it took for Sherlock to believe that he was worthy of love. John did not need to hear the words back to be happy. He heard them in a million other ways every day.
“Me too”, John soothed, pressing his lips onto Sherlock’s. One, two, three pecks. “Alright?”
Instead of speaking, you basically cuddled me and kissed me as if kissing a child’s wounds well. You took care of me as always. That evening we made love as we hadn’t done since our first time and it was the first of many nights to come… I did my best to take care of you and my daughter -ours, from some point on- ever since and I kept all my promises since that day to try and make you both happy. Sometimes I wish you never let me start what I had started all those years ago when I first came home to you drunk. I wish you had objected and knocked me out of it. I wish you had spoken words that you even leave unspoken now. Sometimes old fears creep up on me, nightmares of old memories are renewed regularly. But through it all you both seem happy and your happiness makes me happy too… Maybe happier than I deserve.
Maybe that was it. Maybe you had given me such a promise and I had given it back, without realising. That night or the other. The pool where we decided to die together. Death wouldn’t do us part then, it would take us both. Maybe it was then. Sealed not in paper or in jewellery or tokens but in a simple look. The look you had in your eyes when you looked at me afterwards. Every time. The look I had myself when I watched you for months, trying to decide how you’d take it. My death. My fake death. It did do us part then. Because you couldn’t follow. Or you could. Or rather… you could go somewhere, I couldn’t follow. Thank God, that hadn’t happened. But it was close. Pretty close. Many times. I knew it, had seen the footage, had heard the rants of my brother for stealing it or hacking it halfway around the globe. Discoverable, he said. In danger, he said. When he couldn’t even bloody keep you safe for me. He had one job. One job that he conveniently gave away to… the love of your life? I don’t know. I know nothing anymore.
Turning, both Sherlock’s ears had lifted again at John’s statement. Looking between him and the mantle to the already mentioned skull, and giving the bone decoration a small confirming nod.
Softly humming to himself between sips of tea, John gave the blog’s comments a few quick browses over before telling himself he’ll try and answer some of the more interesting comments later. A small reply to his league of followers allowed him to let his viewers know-so. Pausing afterwards, he looked around the empty flat. Without Sherlock around, the flat just seemed really quiet.
“Come on!” John whisper-yelled and grabbed for the female Familiar’s hand, giving her barely enough time to put down her teapot before she was yanked out of the room and down the hallway in what John hoped was the opposite direction that Sherlock had headed.
“Ugh, fine.” Sherlock sighed. “I got it from Bart’s.”
Currently, he was making his way down the steps of the National Antiquities Museum lost in whirling thoughts that were flinging today’s events around in a jumbled pattern that only Sherlock would have recognized. If thoughts could be manifested into physical format.
“Our security cameras monitor every single door in this entire building. If something opens, it would have been recorded. A closet, a bathroom door, anything. Nothing got opened last night.”
After a small walk across a slightly crowded trade room, they had stopped before a door, and Sebastian was already motioning to it with a slight bow of his head.
“I will have you know, that my idea had nothing to do with the head in the first place. But, I am now curious to know what decomposition does to the actual use of the vocal cords, how he would sound different…Interesting.” Sherlock slowly muttered off, with a hand tapping his chin thoughtfully before swooping into the direction of the kitchen.
The ears were instantly back. Darting up from Sherlock’s head in furry pointed surprise before they just as quickly darted back into dark curls to disappear again, Sherlock very clearly giving John a look after. John swallowed nervously.
Letting out a huff of slightly annoyed-at-himself breath, John eventually did pull his cellphone out to flick it open with only a small sleep deprived struggle. One new text appeared, and with a click of a key it opened.
John let out quick breath that he did not even realize he had been holding.
uninteresting activities he just must perform, John found himself taking a stroll through Russel Square Park. With
“---But, my presence here is more of the business sort.” Mycroft continued, ignoring his younger brother’s antics. Lifting one arm to give a small shrug, before giving John a small smile, condescendingly
“Fine then. Bugger it.”
And….nothing. Franticly John waved the item over again, and again, and
“I didn't say anything at all.” John was starting to feel a bit off about that grin…
“Fine, close your eyes.” Sherlock responded with a small hand wave in John’s direction before he moved to stand.
“Find anything interesting?” Sherlock mentioned without turning to look at him, though the ears had definitely twisted about in his direction. That was something that John was seriously going to have to get used to.
As he flipped off his roommate in a equally silent reply, his phone vibrated again.
“But I ain't about to step into someone else’s territory if you get my meaning.” Lestrade gave a small jerk of his head into hallway’s direction where Sherlock’s room was located.
“Well…” Trailing off, John shuffled his shoes against the sidewalk, looking down at them for a single moment before raising his head to look back up at his current companion with a bit more confidence, squaring his shoulders. “He wasn't a very nice man.”
“Yes, yes. Mrs. Hudson, John. John, Mrs. Hudson. Rest assured you two have met before.”
“You thought that me being a Familiar would have made me uncomfortable in your presence because you were not entirely human?
“Really, John?” The box was filled with an array of old CD cases. Most had long since lost their covers, and the plastic was left scratched with a cloudy white hue. Rolling his eyes, Sherlock used the same foot to flip through a few of them. Nothing catching his eye of course,
. He was in mid-snicker of his own internal joke when he noticed his door to his room was open. John paused, hadn't he closed it last night?
And the random body parts in the fridge, he mentally added with an physical eye roll.
…..What.
“Gone before we got here.” Lestrade lifted his right shoulder in a shrug. “That cabbie could have had enemies I suppose in his line of work but, sadly nothing else to go on.”
But to those of you who do follow this story, and read my work, I just want to say...
“That’s not what people normally say.”
Just as he was about to read further so that maybe he would have a chance to catch up with whatever was going on, the door suddenly opened, and Sherlock was peeking his head inside in a single darted movement. Causing John to startle and nearly drop the paper he had been holding.
Um....Hi.
“Oh, hello!” They were suddenly interrupted when the door had decided to open.
John was left in a hazy half-dark void behind his eyelids with only the sound of moving cloth to interrupt. It did not take long before even that noise was gone, and John twisted his head about a few times in the sudden silence as if he could pinpoint exactly where Sherlock was at.
“Sherlock!”
The door was cracked open, just barely.
But, John remembered that Sherlock had mentioned that she had been wrong in her conclusion and he should fire her. Did that mean something was actually wrong with his leg? Oddly enough, he found he was comforted by this thought. He rather actually be in pain rather than some lady he had only known in the last few months tell him that he was loony in the head.
, the only one,
liar, doc.” David simply laughed, which again ended up simply causing him to cough while his eyes rolled about in their sockets. He was having trouble keeping focused. “John, you need to…”
“No. I did not murder someone, John.” Sherlock responded slowly, as if speaking slower would actually help in the understanding process. “Besides, what fun would that be? I need someone else to do the murdering so I can do the solving. That is how
It wasn't like he didn't need a shower after having slept in all his clothes. Where was the shower anyways?
?!” She half-screeched in her frantic giggles.
I figured a little fluffy was needed after all the drama chapters!
“I dislike having to repeat myself, John.”
Lestrade and John look at one another with questioning glances, while Sherlock remained completely engrossed in the phone itself, clicking to find the picture and quickly opening it. After taking a moment to look at it himself, he turns the phone around so that both John and Lestrade could see the picture itself.
Now why in the hell would John want to do that? John still felt himself swallow though, and his stomach felt like it was attempting to tie itself into knots. Having seen the man deduce before had been an enlightening experience for John, but when he found himself laid bare rather than simply prodded at, well...not right now.
Just like that, they were left alone. Well, alone at a table just the two of them with the candle letting shivers of gold light sweep back and forth over the two of them as it quivered. John was looking back and forth across the table, realizing that just as if he were on a first date, he wasn't quite sure how to start a proper conversation between the two of them. Sherlock on the other hand was content to peer out the window.
Yes yes...I know I do take forever to write.
” noise during.
Sherlock couldn't help from lightly tapping the table with his fingers, looking down at the appendage as if it were betraying him.
John had been enjoying some quiet time in front of his computer, finally trying to get through as many replies on his blog so that he did not seem rude, but the gunshots from their downstairs living room was just not having any of it. In a single smooth movement, John thrust back away from his desk, sprung out of chair, and thumped his way downstairs to skid to a stop at the landing, only slightly out of breath from the quick movement.
“Afghanistan, or Iraq?” The deeper tone of the dark man’s voice seemed to bring John back around as he blinked and attempted to lean forwards to see exactly what was being done to his phone. The bloody thing even barely worked when he wanted to, but the other man seemed to be handling the older piece of equipment just fine. After, he spared a quick look to Mike to find the man grinning again with that same smug look from before, giving a slight twitch to his hand to prompt John to answer.
“I don’t know.” John murmured as he slipped into the taxi, Sherlock following in beside him. “He was a toff.”
“Aw, Sherlock! I really am sorry!” John was finally able to get out without laughing, though he was now very out of breath. Scooting himself up to the door, he reached forwards and through the cat-door after his friend’s retreat, as if that was actually going to do any good.
“Please tell me you haven’t murdered someone, Sherlock.” John was actually starting to look concerned now.
On their way back to Baker street, it was oddly quiet in the back of their cab. Unusual that they had spent the last few hours in a driven conversation only to go mute on the way back to their home. John did not voice this opinion though, as his brain was already attempting to wind down after the long day and the sound of wheels on pavement and cars passing by on semi-wet pavement was a calming feature of living in London. So, instead of striking a conversation to the quiet man across the seat, he leaned his head against the glass of his window and closed his eyes.
And suddenly, Sherlock couldn't help that side of him that wanted to tear this little cretin into tiny itty bitty bits from showing its face a little.
“Goodnight, John.”
“You can smell him on me? Oh, right. Of course
“And that is?” It was John’s turn to raise a brow.
“Ah! Molly, coffee. Excellent.”
For those of you whom have read this far, I at least should be telling you thank you. Ive had these chapters written up for awhile now, and was honestly worried about posting them publicly. For the chosen few Ive allowed to read these, they told me they really seemed to enjoy the story so far, and I have been fighting back my worry on actually releasing it completely to the public.
“Bit of trouble too, I bet?” One brow quirked above the other, and John could swear that Sherlock was just barely ghosting a grin.
The two men brought Sarah’s chair around to the front, sitting it nearer to the woman as she slowly turned her gun onto Sarah. Placing it under her chin and forcing her to sit more properly even as she struggled. Using her free hand the woman gently patted one of the men’s shoulders, whom turned to his leader and flicked out a small forked tongue at her before he followed his companion back into the dark.
John paused in his sweeping to close his eyes and give a small shake of his head. There was still glass on the floor and John was not quite sure he’d ever get the entire mess cleaned up properly. He would have to be careful walking around barefoot for weeks now.
Slowly Sherlock pulled himself to a more forwards stature, placing both hands on top of the table. Eventually, the look turned into a small smirk. Challenge excepted.
” John cried out, twisting in his seat to see what was happening.
“Hm…” John merely replied, dipping his head forwards towards his cup held in two hands, peering down into the dark liquid as if it was going to tell him all the answers instead.
“Wait.” John snapped his fingers, and pointed at the small device. “We’ve seen that before, the last case. Didn't that dead woman like the color pink?”
Shrugging, John turned and headed into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
“Brave. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?” Finally the man moved a step towards him, causing John to grip tighter on his cane he had been given and keeping it between the two of them. This seemed to be completely unnoticed though, as those grey eyes tilted along with the man’s head as he gave John a more curious look. “What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?”
“Mundane is good sometimes.”
“Zhi Zhu…
“Mm.” Sherlock hummed lightly, taking his sweet time before casually letting his head roll back to peer at John. “Of course.”
In the back of John’s mind, a woman reminded him.
“Welcome home, you are back in London.”
“So, how is your blog going, John?”
Soon after, with jam covered toast safely tucked between his teeth, tea in one free hand, and the other grabbing his laptop off the table, John got comfortably seated within his chair. With laptop balanced atop his knees, the toast was easily devoured with a few bites. While enjoying his still warm tea, John opened up the laptop to find that his blog had well over 153 new replies to his longest entry yet, “A Study in Pink”.
After a few minutes of shuffling around inside the bag, he found it. Drawing up his prize in front of his face, a pair of dog tags dangled from his fingers. Blinking he brought them closer to his face to twist and turn them in the light with a scattering of dust particles.
“Let’s test that theory.”
With a knowing wink, he was back out the door, and out of sight.
“W-what do you mean?” John couldn't help but stammer, slightly.
Turning to his taller flatmate, John regarded Sherlock with a confused air. Not that he had been scared of the more powerful man, for in any other aspect John would have left full knowing he had killed a man in cold blood, defense or not. But there was the fact that this Familiar was more than keen to stand up against his own family in regards to his welfare, despite what occurrences may happen under Mycroft’s influence.
John faltered slightly as he was presented with Sherlock’s sudden attention, along with the ears having re-formed atop his head. Clearing his throat quickly he went back to glancing about, trying to cover up his unnerved state.
John was left sitting alone on the couch, and had absolutely no idea what to do with his hands. So he sat them in his lap, and looked up at his flatmate curiously.
John just barely overheard Sherlock’s small sigh, before the Familiar was already up and following, leaving John to quickly get up from his seat and continue to play catch up as he was doing before.
“Okay, just...lets just...
John had honestly thought he was alone in the flat, so after a small struggle with getting the water started, removal of clothes, he’d gotten into the shower and hovered under the blasting shower-head. He was reminded that he had made sure to be wearing both gloves, not wanting to electrocute anything with the metal piping, when his hands felt even more constricted in the wet heat the shower provided. With a sigh, he shook out his head, water splashing against the curtain in turn.
“Nice to meet you too.” John answered after leaning slightly to the side to take some of the pressure off his leg, he gave the older woman a smile, and this seemed to brighten her even further.
I took of the wall.”
“That. Is a skull.”
, back to the bank, Scotland Yard, Chinatown, and so forth, John found his way here. Being left behind as the crazy Familiar had decided he was just going to break in, if no one was around to actually let him into the flat. On a mental side note, John found that wasn't entirely surprising.
It had been a few months since their first “case” together, and John had slowly been enveloped into the atmosphere of living with Sherlock like a small planet finding its rightful spot orbiting around a dark, but furiously burning sun.
“One more time I will ask you, Mr. Holmes. Where is the hairpin?”
“Y-Your….British Shorthair….right?” John stammered, damn it all, he was not going to laugh.
Finally, he found it. He violently tapped the area of the map he wanted, piercing the paper with a sharp nail. Twisting his head around he then surveyed the empty flat.
John was really not in the mood to converse about ‘old times’, but he was also polite enough to at least grasp the hand that Mike struck out in his direction, giving it a firm shake.
flair.
John knew, the other doctor hadn't needed to ask. Even though John was human, (
But now, the color was even brighter amongst the dark fur, that much more brilliant and intelligent looking on the cat that any other color would have given it.
After he waited for what John figured was a polite enough time for Sherlock to respond, he eventually gave a shrug and worked his way up the stairs so he could put his dirty laundry in his room. He would take care of cleaning later. When he did make it back down to the living room, Sherlock was still perched on the couch unmoving and John found that this was hardly surprising. Pausing by the doorway to the kitchen he laid his gloved hand against the frame and looked back to his flatmate.
“Great…” John sighed, letting his body slump back against the bed. Wincing when he realized that that too, was a horrible idea, and all he could do was simply groan his frustration to the white walls.
Sherlock still hadn't moved to access his tea, but at this point John was simply pleased to have his own.
But it was already becoming too much for the younger, and John couldn't bring himself to lie again to the man. If there was anything a dying man deserved, it was a little bit of honesty in the end. So what did John say in his defense? Not a bloody thing. He did notice the very last chance that David had to focus his vision despite the current pain he was in, and it wasn't John that he was looking at, but above them.
“I don't have to.” Mycroft replied back with a much more calmer air, slowly he turned back to John, to give him that same smile from before, like oil on water. “Isn't that right, John? I will be seeing you
Instantly, Sherlock glared daggers towards John’s side of the cab.
John opened his mouth to reply, but only ended up stuttering as he realized the full intentions that Mrs. Hudson was trying to portray to him, he shook his head quickly.
“Nothing to worry about, the landlady is giving me a nice deal. Her husband was sentenced to death in Florida a few years ago, and now she owes me a favor for helping her out.”
You are awesome.
“Not a thing! But, they did leave a sort of message.” During his explanation, Sebastian already had a card slipped out of his pocket, and was sliding it through the card reader that locked the door. Inside, all the had to do was flip a light to show the message that he had been mentioning.
“I can't really afford London on a army pension…” John muttered a reply, the laughter all but forgotten in the span of a question that only reminded him of life’s current events.
. I need you to remember. Do you see it? The symbols on the wall?”
“John,” Well at least he was being acknowledged again at least “Do not wait up, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home!” Grabbing a small pouch from the kitchen table as he went, he was already halfway down the stairs with the door banging shut behind him.
, like he was being given a light head massage. Was that what one felt like? He’d never let anyone touch his ears in such a manner, and was suddenly questioning exactly why had he decided that it was okay for John to do so? It had seemed like a good plan at the time, but now he was fighting with those stupid bodily urges not to preen against the feeling. Sherlock Holmes was
If you are interested enough in wanting to beta for me, do please leave me a message. Ive got a few people that have looked over this a few times, though I could always use the extra help. I have mild dyslexia, and it is a struggle to even get anything this clean. This also causes me to write fairly slow, as I find it hard to burst out a chapter without the proper inspiration. So, if your wanting a chapter every week, I'll have to apologize. With my work/life schedule, I'm really only able to write when I can. But do know that I don't intend to abandon this. Ive worked too hard at it.
“John!” Sherlock announced louder than before.
expression. It's what he would be expecting, afterall. “For ‘The Work’.”
Mrs Hudson simply rolled her eyes as she turned and made her way into the kitchen, with a slight shake of her hand in John’s direction as if waving his defense off.
“Sorry about that….” John tried to brush off the embarrassed feeling in his stomach as quickly as possible. “Your voice is sounding a bit rough.”
Silence. Mrs. Hudson slowly looked over to John, eyebrow raised questioningly.
“Of course, John.” Sherlock replied, before slipping back down onto the couch on his back, ears laying back against the cushioned seat as he got comfortable again, tail curling about mildly at the tip, an inch above the floor.
Startled, John nearly dropped his handful of future laundry. Twisting his head about, he looked back down the hallway he had come to find that sure enough, the ending room’s door was wide open. Sherlock had been here the entire time.
was the mood killer right there. Someone having gone through his private things. His
“Go play with your head and leave me be. I’m done with the fucking cutlery.”
Suddenly, the man looked back up directly into John’s eyes, the gray piercing into his blue as if it could read every single aspect of John’s character with simply that look, and it was everything that John could do not to shiver in the feeling while he was being studied.
, John thought for the moment.
“Lets meet there tomorrow at seven...Oh!” The man quickly re-pocketed his cellphone and made his way around John to the door. “Gotta run, I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
Nothing of such happened.
A gas leak. Sure, whatever.
“What is so funny?” He asked darkly, and John was left to start a series of coughing as he was slowly failing keeping from laughing.
Flinging himself onto his couch, Sherlock only made it back to his earlier position just in time for John to open their flat’s door. He was already calling it their flat, wasn't he just thinking earlier that this was his flat? The thought was perfectly timed to keep him in a thinking position on the couch as John slung his coat back on the rack, only to look over to Sherlock’s stretched out form.
, he allow himself to lower to the monotonous IQ of the commonwealth.
The older gentleman raised a brow with an almost primal smirk, the cabby Familiar whom Sherlock had found to be named Jeff Hope slowly slid the two bottles in his direction.
“What the fuck are you playing at?”
Andy, of course, had been just as much as an imbecile as Sherlock had expected.
His mind was screaming at him, as he dove through another doorway in frantic pace. He had lost his cane somewhere along the way, he faintly remembered something clanging down a hallway, but apparently hadn't stopped to retrieve it.
“I thought Lestrade had told you…” But the lack of anger on John’s part could only be interpreted as ignorance.
I will put major warnings for some chapters later on which you can always pass without reading and focus on the cute ones since this story is written in fragments that you can read as one-shots.
John shifted, straightening his back against the pillows, and place the book on the bedside table.
“Oh you git!”, John giggled, pretending to be bothered, and then grabbed Sherlock’s hips and pushed him on his back, using the motion to roll on top of him. “Insufferable” he blew a raspberry on Sherlock’s collarbone. “-git”, another onto his sternum, “you”, one more onto the pale slim belly. Sherlock had burst in laughter, long legs wrapped around John’s thighs as his body squirmed and thrashed, hands onto John’s ribs, shoulder-blades, fluttering tapping breathlessly.
‘As I think I have explained to you many times before; romantic entanglement while fulfilling for other people-’
‘In saving my life, she conferred a value on it.’ Deep breath. There. Not so difficult, was it? Cracked ribs. Pain. Yes, that should remind you of what you’ve lost. Keep it that way. Go on. ‘It is a currency, I do not know how to spend.’
I freeze. Do you really think I’ve not had my full of lost chances already? Angelo’s. The pool. After the Woman. Moriarty’s trial. Bart’s rooftop. Stag night. Tarmac. And that’s just scratching the surface of the most important ones I lost. The one time I finally took the chance… One time. It will never happen again because what I am seeing now, in your eyes, is the result. You’ll never want to take a chance like that again. Ever. I can’t look at you anymore. I just can’t. Vulnerable, stupid Sherlock Holmes… Filled with sentiment. Even when angry. Anger is a sentiment. You fill yourself with it just to avoid the other ones. Painful ones. That’s what you did and that’s what I’m doing -or trying to do- now.
You never mind that I don’t drive. In fact, you never mind how many things I don’t do or don’t like to do that are normal and expected. That’s a quality I grew to worship about you, although it took me some time to realise how much you have to endure from me. Before you, I didn’t even know how to recognise that something I’ve done was ‘not good’. I always tried to be better for you but even if you shouted at me, you never really meant it. You always try to ignore the worst in me, while I try to improve them but you never demanded or asked me to do it and that let me free to realise for myself. Still, even after years, you insist on driving every single time. I can probably deduce that you don’t want to risk me driving for more than ten minutes, in case I get bored and let my head wander to cases or deductions or my mind palace and in that case, you’re probably right, I shouldn’t be driving at all.
Sherlock could see impatience and fear stir inside him, crowd behind his darkening eyes.
died and we fell right into hell. Wasn’t your fault, really. I should have known. Everything’s fucked up, isn’t it?
. I breathe in sharply. My gaze slowly moves. My polished shoes, then the floor, then your leather brown ones, your blue trousers, your thighs -maybe those trousers where a bit much tight indeed-, your belt, the securely fitted light blue shirt… oh, God… what am I even doing?
‘Well, now you do.’ Angry. Yes. Yet again. Dark tone. Yes. See it. Feel it, John, because I’m angry with you. You made me like that.
I could see myself self-loathing turn to hate towards you. You didn’t deserve this. You deserved better. But I could feel it in my drunken self. I despised… you? No. I never despised you. It was wrong. I despised something and that was mainly myself but how dare you look at me with that knowing glance full of commitment? You didn’t say anything. You just left the door open for me and passed through, making your way downstairs. Oh, of course. Of course, you knew I had left her alone. You knew and being so kind and understanding like a proper human being your first concern was to find someone to send to her. Someone specific. The only someone that you knew would be able to witness what was about to happen when you would come back up the stairs. And you were just so kind as to spare me the humiliation and send that someone back to my place to take care of the daughter I left behind alone, not able to control my temper enough to be confident that I wouldn’t hurt her.
It never worked, and Sherlock could not stop feeling like a failure -or that his head would explode with the need, visceral, primitive, urgent
John walks in only to find him curled -not exactly, or it could turn painful quite soon, but contorted enough- into the small space of his armchair. Doesn't seem phased by his grumpy expression, or the petulant pout, when he laughs at hearing that Sherlock is 'bored'. "Cuppa and telly?", he just asks over his shoulder, seemingly otherwise ignoring the detective, as one might ignore a five-year-old acting up. Sherlock gives a noncommittal grunt, hugging his knees as best he can. So of course John is forced to notice him again, on the way from the kitchen with two mugs in hand.
He has no idea if John ever believed him.
‘Sorry.’ I worry my lower lip between my teeth not caring about blooding it all over again as I did half an hour earlier.
"Yeah. Would never have believed I'd be doing this, but yeah". It sounds casual. Calm.
“I love you”, John said again, more slowly. Sherlock’s tapping followed the rhythm of his voice. “I love you”, John said again, and excitement rolled like a wave in his tone. Again, Sherlock tapped in time.
It felt like more than that. So much more, at the time.
‘Seriously, we’re not gonna talk about this?’ Jesus, are you playing with your luck? Is this your type of game with me?
He memorized the tiniest detail about him. The most miniscule quirk and habit, preference and dislike. The ways John laughed replaced his study in tobacco ash. John’s body was his temple of worship. John’s safety had his constant vigilance. John’s happiness his every effort.
It has been a while since I last left my armor behind to enter a situation unfavourable to me. I will have to now. For you. My dear Watson. My clean-shaven Doctor. My blogger. I’d be lost without you. I am lost already. But I must keep it to myself, be by your side, manage this one last miracle for you.
Sherlock looked towards him. Slouched shoulders. John never slouched. Head propped up on a fist resting against his cheek, so that it gathered the skin of it up against his cheekbone. Dried lips. The lower one was cut in the middle, a small red line. It was not bleeding now, but it had been last night. Two small grey pebbles of dark circles beneath sunken-in eyes and two-day stubble peppered on cheeks and chin and jaw. Skin that had turned ashen with lack of rest, and food, and sleep. He had a cowlick, and some tufts flying rampant over his eyes, and he could only keep only one eye at a time open.
work?’ Stop it. It hurts and I can’t feel it anymore. You know it doesn’t actually work. You’re ignoring what we started. You’re ignoring everything.
"I..."
“Are you ready to?”
No. No, because what I’m saying is true but what you are about to say is most certainly not.
“Mmm?”
‘Was that really you, dear brother?!’ she had sneaked closer to me and tried to take the phone from my fingers but I retreated quickly trying to make my way to the bedroom or the bathroom at least. Thank god, I was taller than the both of you.
"You were wrong", John says after a minute pause. He doesn't clarify about what. "And I was wrong, too. I am tired of being wrong, Sherlock. I am tired of everything being my fault".
You’re John. John Watson. The man I met seven years ago. Not with a limp this time but broken all the same. The Doctor that wished me to be alive, then punched me in the face when his wish became true. The man that wishes to be something better but doesn’t know how to go about it. Consumed by misplaced guilt and anger. By addiction. Blaming me for mine. For the pulse inside me saying that I need it. I need the drug, the hallucination, the relief, the impasse. I need it to dull the pain just as he needs his liquor. I need it to pass out before I die. Just as he needs his liquor. Only that doesn’t dull the pain. It makes it worse. I need it because the pain is not mine. Shouldn’t be mine. He needs it because he wants to inflict more pain. To himself. Because he wants and needs to be punished.
John stared at him, for a long while. He held his chin up with one hand, enough so that their gazes could remain locked together.
Sherlock nodded, and lay his head onto John’s shoulder, his limbs loosening up, drawn to curling towards John like sunflowers to their sun.
A small seductive whistle. That’s all it took for me to turn around distraught. Heartbeat elevated.
Sherlock’s index onto John’s knee.
‘Just wait ‘till tonight and I’ll deal with you too…’
“John. Coffee”, Sherlock mumbled as he took his seat across the table and placed a steaming mug in front of him.
Pause.
‘Shouldn’t be here, it’s bad luck.’ Scrambled, came the words out of me.
on the sweaty, bare skin on John’s belly this time.
there's a bit of pain in those first ones but it gets good soon ;)
I’m not. I’m not lucky. You don’t even acknowledge what we’ve been through. I am not lucky at all. Good. Want to play hide and seek? I’ll ignore everything too. Let’s go back to the beginning then.
‘John’
“Say it”, Sherlock said, and his cheeks were naked flames.
‘Yes, of course. Rosie.’
“I love you”, John affirmed, taking one of Sherlock’s hands in his own and kissing the bony knuckles. “I love you”
‘I heard that…’ you replied in a lower tone that made me hiss through gritted teeth to avoid a gasp. ‘I see she can’t hear me now, can she? Neither can she hear you, right?’ I almost heard you smirk.
"What she did", John starts again, in a strained voice. Has to stop and clear his throat before he continues. "What she did was horrible. Inexcusable. She should have known how much your death cost me. She should have -she was supposed to know. That's why I married her".
But you don’t keep me right anymore. I didn’t do this because your dead wife asked me to. That’s absurd for you to believe. You know it.
Sherlock can feel his pulse thrumming in his throat.
‘Yes, yes.’ Impatient. You are so far away. ‘Sorry, wasn’t-… thinking about Rosie.’ Liar. Liar. Liar. Shut up. Her name almost leaves a taste in my mouth. Hope. The taste of hope. She’s the reason we started what now is being destroyed little by little. I’m in pieces. No dignity left. No strength. I don’t care. There’s only last thing to do.
Into battle.
‘Good. My post then. See ya.’ The military salute is almost poetic as I shake my head with fondness and raise two fingers at a silent goodbye. Of course, I’ll see you in just ten minutes from now, but it still leaves me raw every time I have to leave your side. After so many years… who’d have thought?
Hesitation. Indifference. Gaze frozen. You know what’s going on. You won’t allow it. Thank you. You are actively ripping me apart. Aggressively. That’s just great. But she’s beautiful… my mind strays. Stupid. Focus. The case. That’s right. Oh. You were almost gone. I stopped you from leaving. Stupid. Should have let you. I don’t need this.
“Oh, right”
But though the practical and physical ways of love he mastered and showed and craved, the three little words clogged up his throat and had to be choked down with cowardice and shame. He had even practiced saying it back, alone, in front of a mirror. ‘I love you, I love you, I love
‘Don’t you understand? I had to do it!’ I begged.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Before this fix-it hug-scene chapter from TLD, I'd like to point out some serious warnings for this fic in general.
"Me?", John says, a little too quickly. Surprised.
Sherlock picked up his cup of tea, forgotten until then, and stood. “Lestrade can wrap it up”, he said, waving a dismissive hand.
‘Come on. Let’s lie down…’ I whispered and guided you into the grass. It was soft but also wet from the last rainy days of spring. You didn’t object but you refused to let my hand go. I squeezed your fingers reassuringly and slowly we were both on our back watching the stars…
Here was where he normally excelled, but today was not turning into one of those good days where everybody went back to camp with hardy back slaps and laughter about a job well done. Instead he found himself crouched under a sand dune with a bleeding soldier that John already knew was way too far gone to be saved today. He wasn't about to tell him that though.
Concade took the moment to reach down into a pocket of his white coat, pulling out a thick blue rubber glove, and of all things, a metal fork. John leaned slightly in his direction, looking at the two objects in scrutiny. Concade slipped the glove on and held the fork with his now gloved hand while using his free one to make sure the glove was snuggly fit by pulling on the edge near his wrist. After, he pointed the forked end of the utensil in John’s direction and gave it a small twitch to indicate he wanted John to take it.
in the process!
you will be needing it.” The older woman giving him a insanely obvious wink while she grasped both hands together in front of her, pleased.
By the time John had caught up, the taller Familiar was standing in front of an opposing office door, looking up at the name tag slid into the card holder in the middle. Taking a quick single glance behind him, Sherlock snatched up the little plastic name sign, and pocket it while turning, hardly giving a glance in John’s direction as he worked.
“Got, or stole?” John crossed his arms in front of his chest, every bit the disapproving parent in this situation.
“Wait,
Sherlock was again attempting to keep his attention, and damn it if it wasn't hard to give it. John pulled a hand from his pocket when he turned back to look at him, pointing at himself.
“Stop that now! Do you want people to call the police?!” He snarled up at his flatmate.
“You know what? Just ignore me.”
Sherlock could only sit there and blink as he was left with hands hovering awkwardly in front of him. After a second he slung a dark look at John’s retreating form before following him and flinging his body back onto the couch, though this time he positioned himself sitting up so that he could steeple both hands under his chin. Just to make sure John got a full broad on look of displeasure of having been deprived from the computer.
Sherlock, whom while had many events in his life where he was yelled at for whatever reason, still did not react very well to the raised tone. One would think the Familiar would be used to it by this time in his life, but with a quick glare and a whip of his tail, Sherlock had already flung the gun’s direction back towards the wall.
incentive,
Oh gods. Sherlock had known from the start that John was a magical user. Apparently, Familiars could actually smell magic-users.
“Its a shock blanket, Sherlock.”
John couldn't help the sarcastic harsh laugh that escaped him at the very thought of Harry helping him.
“Well, go on then.
“Or it might even hit your friends.
Somehow, during the events of finding Van Coon’s body, the origami flower, a man named Lukis’s flat,
With that single name muttered, he fled the flat once more. Leaving the map to slowly slide down the wall with the knife softly screeching along the paper in a raspy wail before it finally fell to the floor.
John felt a mimicked thump against the door, though slightly higher up than his own head. Sherlock must have moved to sit down against the door in a similar manner as he had.
“Sherlock.”
Everything was just dandy in John’s mind as he went back to re-reach for the box under his bed. A few failed grabs, but he eventually found it and yanked it out to join him. Laying back down he let the box lay on his chest as he slipped the lid up and off, tilting it up towards his face so he could look at the contents. All he would really need is one of his magazines…
“Sherlock what in the hell!” John attempted to pull away from the sudden touch. He had been actively avoiding his skin touching anyone for months now, and with the sudden skin to skin contact he felt his breath hitch. Waiting to see if Sherlock would only yank back at the sudden bite of electric current that John was sure was going to emit itself in sudden shock.
“Huh. I wouldn't have taken you for a fellow that likes pink.” Lestrade mentioned.
Turning his head sharply around he found himself almost nose to nose with Sherlock, whom had leaned over into his personal space. John stared dumbly back at Sherlock’s lighter blue eyes before finally he leaned back into his own seat on the left side of the cab, giving a hard huff through his nose.
“Exactly who are you?” A quick retort, and a squaring of his own shoulders.
That was how John found himself suddenly being led into a impressive building named Shad Sanderson Bank. Sherlock had already made his way through the revolving door and John had barely enough time to step onto the escalator with him. At first, he had been looking around the insides of the impressive building, but now was noticing how Sherlock had thrust his hands into his coat pockets and was rapidly grazing areas of the building over with flickering blue glances. He looked almost, uncomfortable. Both ears kept firmly out of sight, per the usual, including the tail.
It was too bad for him, that Sherlock had just been able to get one of John’s hands almost free.
“Morning, Sherlock!”
“I'm sorry?” John eventually found a answer to the question in the form of another, he had absolutely no idea what was going on here.
Looking at the thick plastic, he knew why the doctors had helped him pick the case out for it, old phone or not. That thought was kind of aggravating, and he knew the industrial line of phone case was mostly meant in hopes that if he did accidentally handle it without his gloves on then he had a better chance of not shorting it completely out. Just another daily handicap he had to deal with of his new lifestyle.
“Had it all my life, if you are curious.”
See you all next time!
John removed his right hand from his coffee and lowered it down to rub at his knee, not that he actually noticed doing so though. Instead, he was left pondering Mike’s sentence with a comparison between then and now.
“I thought that was you, John Watson.” Mike was pulling himself up from a bench and heading in his direction with a welcoming smile of remembrance. “We were at Bart’s together, remember?”
Sherlock quite suddenly thrust his head towards John’s direction in a snapping motion.
nothing to do and no where to be he was attempting to hold a brisk pace, as much as a limping old man could hold with his dignity dying with every half shuffled step, but by bloody damn if John was going to let anyone see him as weak. Regardless of how he currently felt.
Frequently John found himself wondered if living in 221B was either frantic, interesting, or downright frustrating. Maybe a little from all three. But, it was never boring, and that was certainly a plus.
Sherlock loved when everything went according to plan. Reaching for a sheet of paper to his side he slowly leaned forwards and slipped it down where John would see it being handed to him. Slowly John grabbed the piece of paper with his free hand and lifted it further so he could see it properly.
Slamming the door back open, John was left with the sight he already knew that was coming. It didn't keep him from letting out a groan of despair and leaning his body weight against the frame of the door. Head bowed as she squinted his eyes shut at the scene, willing it to be anything different than what it was.
With a slight narrowed brow, John stepped inside after Sherlock to find him standing near a shorter gentleman while his hand was being shaken between both of the other man’s own.
“Four?” John asked quickly, at the last statement.
“Sherlock, are you going to come or not?” The man simply ignored his outburst.
“But...as it may. You did do so in the act of both what would be seen as self defense, and might I add in the defense of my only brother. This, has not gone without proper speculation.”
, was that he had only been half right about Sherlock’s sleeping habits.
A gunshot was nothing compared to the sound that suddenly drove into Sherlock’s ears like nails driven through his own skull with the speed that seemed to rival light itself.
“Always dashing about, my husband was very much the same.”
“I want that Albino’s liver.”
” Sherlock softly mentioned beside the two of them.
“Any plans of where the two of you might go?” Sherlock asked, casually. Keeping his eyes on John, and slowly letting both his ears slide back into their normal comfortable positions. Acting as if all the world was fine with the current mundane round of conversation.
“Why not?” Sherlock gave John the most interesting grin he could come up with, giving a slight wave to his hand as to indicate the aloofness he was portraying with the conversation. “Or you could just take her to the cinema, out to dinner, all that rubbish. Dull
Sherlock opened his mouth we a retort to John’s suddenly aloofness, but quickly closed in on realizing he did not really want John to leave again, or even permanently, if Sherlock kept the current act up. Instead, he figured he would attempt to derail whatever argument they were silently having.
Inside was an older looking lady with a mop of silvery aged brown hair that was giving the both of them a wide grin upon realizing whom was at the door. She nodded to John before looking to Sherlock as she back-stepped to allow them room inside.
Much love to everyone, and anyone, that takes time out of their day to wander through my little edge of AU. <3
More silence.
“Doctor.” John quickly corrected. John didn't like this, the man held a very clear stature of importance even in this awkward introduction. The posh figure raised a brow slightly at the abrupt correction over what looked to be a set of dark gray-hued eyes. Casually he lifted a hand from his cane and grazed it back from a temple through his short hair, a color John wasn't able to completely tell in the shaded light as he had forgotten to hit the switch. John did have a perfectly good reason for forgetting though, because it wasn't only the man’s presence in his flat that he did not like. Another thing to dislike, was the fact that
,” a wild swing of the room with a hand “,whole thing works.”
He found some soap, thankfully. Even if it did smell rather bland, if not a bit sweet, and John wasn't going to be picky about it. He could just buy his own soap later. Lifting his head up away from the spray, he lathered himself up to wash. John brought to mind an older song that he had enjoyed the lyrics from years ago. He remembered the lyrics seemed rather informative to his life.
“Are we done?” Because John was very done with this entire conversation.
“Sherlock!” Raz grinned, raising a hand and thrusting his thumb towards himself in a pointing gesture while puffing out his chest proudly, completely ignoring John’s presence. “Guess who found something you’d like.”
“Oh, Sherlock!” Suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Hudson from behind him, looking oddly at the rear-end of his gown, her face having gone slightly red from laughing.
The door banged against the wall and John was left looking at the most well dressed thief he’d ever seen.
John let his card slip through the slot of the chip-and-PIN machine with a well worn sigh. Minus one head of lettuce, he had finally got everything scanned.
John was only an instant through that thought, and his one gloved hand already half-unclasping his jeans before he suddenly realized. His box was right where he had left it, correct. But that had been in his
The man seemed to take a moment to stretch, giving a slight roll to his shoulders before moving back to the strict posture that continued to lord over John’s.
“Not just a criminal organization; it’s a cult. Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders.” Sherlock had said.
“But it’s only just past mid-day…” Mrs. Hudson attempted before Sherlock had her completely out their door.
“Your a
“Okay! Okay! Yes! I can see it!” Finally John answered, giving another shake of his head between those two palms to try to remove them. Where in the hell had his thoughts gone there?
“Yes, four. I assume you know the numbered system we have to indicate magical awareness?”
“Okay. Honestly, Sherlock. I really am sorry. I promised not to laugh, and I did. That is entirely my fault…”
John raised an eyebrow, refusing to say anything.
Sherlock laughed at that, another win for John.
He remembered re-gloving both hands after the
...and he was already gone. Sighing, John rubbed a hand across his face before quickly snatching his coat and trying to catch up to the rapidly mood changing Familiar.
She felt it was time to leave. Now, to be precise.
“Where are you going?”
Mycroft gave John an almost curious look, slight tilt given to his head as he regarded his brother’s new associate with the usual cool gaze that he portrayed to the common folk.
“You are not allowed to laugh.”
The map on Sherlock’s laptop had said the phone was here, and that meant that Sherlock had to be here somewhere. He hadn't had much of a choice though, and had been forced to finally make a decision. Time was not a factor that he had in his favor.
Here’s his chance, Sherlock gave his best I-can-solve-this-problem smile and flung his fingers out towards their kitchen.
.”A smirk was given, at his own attempt at humor.
“Sure.” John answered back casually, pulling himself up from the chair just in time to follow behind the coat tail of Sherlock as they made their way towards the outside of the building. Home sounded good right about now, and once again, the thought did not cross his mind how the flat had so quickly been thought of as such only after a single night of sleeping there.
“John look at me.”
brilliant, Sherlock!” John hissed now, giving his flatmate’s arm a small shake. “How am I supposed to have a proper date with you hanging around?!”
“You mean to say that you had no prior knowledge of such a reaction before the incident?” Concade was leaning closer now, watching John for what he suspected was an act to defend himself at the accusation. “The army believed you had lied on your forms about your magical level, and hid it until the accident brought about the inability to do so.”
Well, whatever that meant.
, for a short period of time. Maybe even longer if he was lucky.
“What about it?” John asked, while he pulled the device from his pocket and sat it on top of the table and sliding it in Sherlock’s direction.
John finally opened his eyes, looking up to his partner, the words having come more easily the longer the music went on. He was left watching Sherlock softly swaying just as he had before, but now with the lights outside coming from outside, it enveloped Sherlock in a soft halo of white that was only interrupted with a swish of his tail.
you bollocks for brains!” John finally cracked, slinging the head of lettuce down.
“Mrs. Hudson, this is Doctor John Watson. John, Mrs. Hudson.” He nodded in John’s direction as he was carefully stepping other the threshold.
Which only made Mrs. Hudson to giggle even harder into her palms that she now held up against her face to try and hold them in. Sherlock came whirling back down the hallway to point at John’s still laughing form in only the most dramatic fashion, with his gown billowing out from behind him.
Sherlock’s eyes grew almost as wide as Mrs. Hudson’s had been, and he instantly whirled himself down their hallway to their bathroom. It was where the closet mirror in the flat was located. In the mean-time, John had completely lost it. Falling back in his chair he had to hold both arms at his sides as he laughed.
Well, Mycroft was nothing if not precise. It was as if John had been staying here for months.
“So for right now, please accept my gratitude in such that you should not be bothered further by tonight’s events. I will have the situation cleaned up by the proper channels.”
Soon as he was gone, Mrs. Hudson was looking back to John’s slightly wide eyed look with a comforting fond one of her’s. Giving a slight tilt to her head and letting out a content sigh.
“Right?” Sebastian had already turned back to Sherlock, trying to keep himself from rubbing his hand by simply putting it into a pocket. Sherlock did little to reply, from which Sebastian nodded with what one must figure as understanding. “Right.”
Bullet holes lined inside the yellow paint as best as someone who had

With a frustrated huff, Sherlock turned away from John and curled up with his back to him.

could have.
“So uh...you are still at Bart’s?” John eventually asked after another of the many graceless pauses he had found himself in as far as conversation went these days.
“Taking the two aspects of your previous job positions, Doctor,” Pausing, Sherlock stuck out his finger of his right hand. “and army.” A second finger joined the first. “The first would have given you at least slight medical knowledge of Familiars, but then you changed your training. A change that would have put you with a mostly, if not all, human troop in the army because you are not a Familiar yourself. Your medical training would have changed to suit the needs you would need in that position and thus, any more knowledge about Familiars would have have been a mute point after the first lessons that you had to take to even get into the medical practice in the first place. You, John, are not very used to being around Familiars at all. This isn't even including the knowledge of your all-human family.”
“Because, John. I do not think it is quite enjoyable to suddenly find myself in a set of clothing that is no longer suited for the form I am currently in, and thus must remove myself from them. I am assured that you do not wish for me to undress in front of you, correct?”
In reality, John did not wait too long when he was suddenly met with a low-pitched sound.
“Sherlock! Always a pleasure, always a pleasure! And whom do we have here,
Dropping the boot back into the bag haphazardly, he was about to kick the clothes back into the closet, except for that last second he was sure he had heard something metallic rattle in the bag. Slowly he turned his body back to the closet, both ears twitched forwards and he took a moment to considered what it may be. Finally he dropped to his knees and thrust both hands into the duffel bag to find it, tail whipping behind him to cause his gown to sling back and forth.
“Where?” Sherlock simply asked the new man.
“...What?” John blinked, tilting his body slightly from behind Sherlock to give the Inspector a surprised expression.
Okay, that was the end of John’s patience right there.
Sherlock was currently digging through John’s closet where most of his larger clothes had been hung, or had hung, if the case may be. Most had been yanked out and thrown onto the floor behind him to scatter across the room. Except for a certain jumper he had found that had been a hideous pea-green and off-red color, causing his tail to bristle in disgust. No, I do not think so, not in his flat. That particular monstrosity had been tossed out the window with an extravagant flourish of limbs and a yelling of: “Begone, loathsome creature, and trouble us no more!”
….what was that?
“And you are trying to change the subject.” John smirked.
“So!” Mrs. Hudson was quick to recover, ignoring the child-detective to turn to John and give him another one of her welcoming smiles. “What have you been up to today, John?”
If a story about John H. Watson were to exist, or a biography rather, he would be the first to tell you that you might as well skip a major portion of his earlier life. Born to a normal human family, a normal human mother and father, a normal if not aggravating older sister, and to say much else would be a feat of strength at best.
associates, in their words, you
“Hm.” Rising back to his usual arrogant stature he motioned towards the hallway with a flippant twist of his hand.. “Home?”
“This is not a game of ‘I showed you mine, now you show me yours.’, Sherlock.” John mentioned, though the harshness of his tone had lowered. “I don’t want to accidently hurt you.”
Because, Sherlock was a feline type right? The ears and tail were dead giveaways, John thought.
It also didn't include the fact that during the last few hours, Sherlock had somehow got him a
That restless feeling never did leave, no matter how much John attempted to ignore it. So after much thought, and a rather heated conversation with both his parents and his sister, John found himself deployed to Afghanistan after he had signed up for the British Army. Trained at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, he could use his medical skills while attempting to fill that personal useless void. London was full of its own doctors, so why not use his skills where they were needed most? It might very well be dangerous, almost certainly so.
At least the duffel bag had proved to be a little more interesting. He had to lean over to unzip it, and found what he already figured he would, a jumbled mess of army related belongings. A few shirts stuffed in, what looked to be a map of some sort that barely got a two second glance, a pair of boots that he found still had some sand in them. Grabbing one of the boots he drew it up and wiggled in mid-air to allow some of the rock particles to fall into his other open palm.
“Jumped in-front of a train?” Lestrade mentioned off-handedly shortly after his spying.
Slowly, as if he were dealing with a wild animal, Doctor Concade made his way around the bed to the far side of the room where a window was located. Its white curtains had been closed this entire time, so John had not taken much notice, but now as the doctor pulled on their string to have the curtains open in a soft swishing of heavily clothed fabric he indicated outside with a slight tilt of his head.
Slowly, the bow moved, and the tone was drawn out once again into the air around them. Yes, John knew this one. Embarrassingly he knew it, but it was a little too late to say no now. Taking a breath, John closed his eyes, and tried to pretend that he did not have an audience. It was just like any other time that he sang to himself, alone, where no one else could hear him.
“Landlady, dear. Not your housekeeper.” She lifted a hand to point and tap her finger in the air at him.
“Even we can only handle so much that goes on, and besides, you did find the treasure did you not? I doubt that Van Coon’s P.A. would mind handing it over once she realizes how much of a crucial part of history it happens to be.”
“You are perfectly stable now though, once we had dealt with the problications. While you were under, what tests we were able to perform has listed you as a level four warlock.”
Sherlock’s blinking slowly quickened as his mind caught up with his body, and he found him slowly looking over to John, with that same curious expression.
.” Mycroft finally glared over to his brother Familiar, his patience slowly growing thinner by the minute. But, that wasn't very unusual when dealing with the Familiar in question.
“You haven't moved an inch since I left, you could always go yourself.”
It all took place in a matter of seconds before the world returned to normal, except for the faint sizzled sound and the smell of burnt everything enveloping the room. Darting forwards to skid on his knees, Sherlock knew he had maybe a chance the man hadn't instantly died from whatever had hit him, snatching onto the man’s shirt and yanking him up with a shake.
ones.” Adding in a small giggle afterwards.
“According to my more
John woke up in a startled fashion that most would have been lead to believe he had been having a nightmare about his time in the war. Sadly that wasn't the case this time around, and John was more disgusted by the fact he had been startled awake simply by a dream that had been replaying his earlier memories of returning to London. Even if his nightmares of the war turned into phantom yelling in the middle of the night, to be awaken and disturbed by something so mundane was far more embarrassing in the ex-soldier's mind.
“Someone doesn't want me to see it…”
Till next time! And there will be a next time, I promise!
“Bored!”
John had only taken a few more minutes to browse the rest of the small bedsit, even everything in his tiny kitchen had been taken. Not only that, the place had been cleaned. Well, the landlord was certainly going to enjoy that. John though, was still currently stuck in his current semi-dirty clothes and was adding that fact to his list of things that were not good.
“Damn it Sherlock, you fluffy little tosser.” John suddenly found himself giggling.
In a similar movement from before, except three pairs of eyes this time and not two, found them looking towards the doorway to find Mycroft standing, as if he had been there the entire time. Leaning slightly on that umbrella he always seemed to be carrying around. Dressed in his usual business attire.
John did little else but blink.
“That is enough for me to go on, yes?” That grin, despite how smug it looked on the taller man’s features, looked rather authentic now at least. With that, he twirled himself around with a flutter of that coat of his and made his way to the door again, slipping out of the room quickly.
“Oh god, yes.”
Everything was starting to slowly make sense to John. Even though he was no way near as brilliant as Sherlock, it was clear enough to him with only a few sentences exactly why this Familiar had distanced herself, and then gone missing completely.
” John snarled after her, without even realizing it. Causing the helpless Mrs. Hudson to twist back around towards him in shock with a hand raised to her chest and mouth open.
John closed his eyes and took a second to hope that somewhere, he hoped that Soo Lin could forgive him for this second mistake. After a moment, he opened them so that he could in turn close her brother’s eyes. What might have been an act of attempting to put the Familiar’s soul to sleep, was more done in the fact that John could barely stand the accusing dead glare the body was giving him.
Before Soo Lin could reply, her light went out. John heard the distinctive electrical click and hiss of everything else in the building having shut down, it seemed surprisingly loud amidst the stonework of the walls and building itself.
Grabbing the mugs, John stepped out to the living room and placed Sherlock’s tea on the table close enough for him to grab it if he wished, and took his own place in the chair he had sat in the day before. Shifting his body against the union pillow to get comfortable before swirling around his own tea to strengthen it and taking a sip. The day was looking better with the warmth and caffeine added to it.
John found himself growling under his breath again as he stuttered his way over to the counter to thrust the bags onto. Turning around, he huffed loudly in Sherlock’s direction with both hands back on his hips.
“Oh no mate, I think you’ve gone a bit too far to the left there----No. You know what. I am not even playing this game. What the
With that, John had enough of the current debate, and he intended on ending it his way. Slinging a hand out he snapped the top of the laptop down, barely avoiding Sherlock’s fingers as the Familiar snatched both his hands away at the last second. Shaking a finger in Sherlock’s face, John used his other arm to sweep across the table and latch onto his laptop, putting it under one arm and headed into the living room, completely ignoring that he hadn't put any of the shopping away.
“John!”  Sherlock whined. Actually whined at him! “If we are going to be living together, like we have already mentioned before, it is important that we are comfortable with one another. It was the whole reason behind letting you look over my ears in the first place. Now it’s my turn.”
John felt his blood go cold.
“I would request you take a seat, though as the case may be…” The man then pulled his hand away from his hair and lightly gestured to the very empty room. “Though I am sure this might be of some use to you.” With the free hand placed back atop his hip, the other that held the cane lifted it into the air and let it slide down across his fingers so that he could hold it out towards John to take.
‘Oh, okay, that’s good.’ Piss off. Piss off. Piss off. I hope it shows in my face because I want to be angry again but I can’t and you’ll reduce me to pieces with no reason. Is that how people feel when I do that to them?
‘Oh, for God’s sakes, I don’t text her back.’ Yes. Anger. Just for a moment, I thought you were going to see us as we were, see her as she is and remember… Remember your promise. But you didn’t. Obviously. As expected. How stupid of me. And now you’re giggling and telling me what to do. I don’t want to do anything. Only thing I can do is fix my eyes on you, let the anger fall down and show you once again what I feel with the hope you’ll get it. You won’t. So, I am not about to do it. Even though, I might be doing it unconsciously because I do, in fact, look at you with pain.
“But it’s an 8”, John’s eyebrows raised.
Sherlock shoots him a murderous glance. They are not supposed to talk about all that. That can only mean John is being serious, and the smile on his lips now is not the 'I'm happy' smile, but the 'snap out of it or I'll chin you', smile. Sherlock doesn't like the latter, so he slowly unfolds his body, sitting properly onto the chair. As properly as he can anyway. His expression must have been so miserable that John laughed. Truly laughed this time, crinkling eyes and thrown back head and all. John looks beautiful when he laughs like that. Short and sweet, vibrant pizzicato.
‘No.’ I am trembling. Imperceptibly but I am. Look at us. Two broken men with no hopes and no dreams anymore. What are we? What is this?
You just looked at me incredulously. Questions were formed and deformed in your head and I could see it. How could I risk it all for nothing? How could I break my promise to you? I had risked my life one more time today without you knowing and I returned home with blood in my hands and clothes. I had risked my life by choice and didn’t let you protect me because I was afraid. I was afraid you’d get hurt. I was afraid you wouldn’t allow me to finish this. The ground seemed to come closer and before I knew it I was on my knees in front of you. Crying.
Of course, he had attempted to rationalize this. Multiple times, and insistently. Did three little words matter so much, after all? Was everything else that he was enthusiastically and eagerly and genuinely doing for John not enough, in the grand scheme of things? The answers were always ‘yes’, and ‘no’ respectively. Hoorah for consistency, and woe to him.
Nothing happens for a few moments. Sherlock's eyes are glued on John's sock-clad feet. Swaying, like reeds in soft wind. And then not swaying anymore. Rooting to the spot, and staying there.
Something cracked and I felt your steady palms on my shoulders. There was pain at my knees. I must have collapsed to the floor and you supported me. I looked into your eyes and the rage almost woke once more but you leaned encouragingly close whispering for me to let go and that it was okay. How could you even say that? No! If I was capable to hold myself conscious until I came to our flat -your flat- every time, then I could damn well keep my senses through this and stop hurting you.
