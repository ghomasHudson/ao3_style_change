And then she would take Waverly. Then she would take the child far away, with or without Jim’s permission.
Sherlock was saved by the doorbell ringing. John went for the door but Mrs. Hudson got to the stairs first. “You finish the peas, I’ll let everyone in.”
Moriarty had been quiet, there were enough cases to keep them busy but not too busy, still plenty of time for candlelit dinners at Angelo’s and afternoons looking over cold cases, and they’d even
“As soon as I get over the walls,” Ireni replied. She exited the carriage, took a quick look around, and started to shift into a bird. She was wearing a blue dress the time, and the giant blue wings were almost invisible in the growing darkness. She nodded at them, and took off, sailing towards the Castle.
“I loved you long before we had those dreams,” John said firmly, holding Sherlock’s face between his hands. “I loved you a lot longer than I ever knew. It was probably the first time we met, I just—I just didn’t realize. And I’m going to be here for as long as you want me.”
When Maria was twenty-five, having crossed several countries walking through nights and sleeping from dawn to just before noon, she was forced to admit that it was very hard indeed. Ten years was a long time. What if the six fingered man had sailed across the ocean?
“And she’ll make a wonderful mother.” Sherlock was quiet for a minute, playing with John’s fingers. “So if she has the courage—”
“When did that happen?” John snapped. He drew his healer’s pouch from his bag. “Damn it, say something next time.”
Grezzik fell to his knees. The burns on his arms and legs were bad, but nothing compared to the agony in his heart.
Stan smiled. He looked up at Sherlock, suddenly looking a bit shy. "I've heard...I've read everything on your blog, Dr. Watson. That's why I wanted to be a detective."
John’s cry of pain snapped Sherlock into action. He leapt to his feet and aimed a swift kick at the rodent. It dislodged the rat from John’s shoulder, which was good, but then it leapt at Sherlock, which was Not Good.
“Enough.” Mycroft felt something dangerous in the air. Something was threatening them beyond what they anticipated.
It wasn’t even seven minutes later, after several awful double entendres exchanged (apparently Greg had been coaching Mycroft), they’d all agreed to never discuss walking in on each other again.
Sherlock had left to find Molly. Molly, with Mike's help (now that was a couple John hadn't seen coming) were going to smuggle a body nearly perfectly Sherlock's match out of Bart's and into an abandoned house not far from the Study in Pink house. Sherlock was going to call Moriarty there, Moriarty would take the bait and tell Sherlock to commit suicide for the price of restoring his name, and Sherlock would set the house on fire, disappearing through a trapdoor into a cellar Mike had built on a weekend off.
"Child, there are many wonderful things about being old. And in a way, this is one of them." Watson's eyes were glistening with tears. "You will understand when you get there. It is painful to say goodbye, but we need rest. Do you understand?"
“You can’t do that forever,” Molly snarled. “And we will follow you forever for that child. You must know this.”
“Then why do you drink it?” Grezzik asked. He was looking for food, and found some stew that tasted somewhat fresh. It had meat and vegetables in it, so he dished up a bowl.
“No one can guarantee the safety of a woman and child in labour,” Max said bluntly. “No one ever has. Oh, there’s been improvements, there’s been medicine and healing…but it is still the hardest act a body can go through, and little things can turn into huge problems. It is not possible yet to make that pain worth it every single time. I’ve delivered dozens of living babies, and I’ve buried many dead ones, and many dead mothers. I buried yours, actually.”
John covered Sherlock’s hand with his own. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I shouldn’t yell, but Philip…take this from a man who left his love behind. Don’t let misunderstandings come between you.”
“I promise I won’t kill you until you reach the top.” Of course she wouldn’t, that wouldn’t be fair.
Sherlock shooed the twins off his knee. "Bring your biscuits in to Kitty," he instructed. His smile faded as the two rejoined Kitty under the cushions. "We don't have much time."
Once she becomes Mrs. Hopkins, Kitty quickly makes friends with the other policemen’s wives. They’d been cold to her before her marriage, worried that a woman in the station would steal their husband’s attentions. Stan was quietly, vindictively happy to find out that one of the worst, Mrs. Riley, discovered her husband in bed with their maid. (He does eventually become ashamed of that).
Part of Sherlock wanted to rush out the door and see his brother and the rest of their family, and part of him wanted to take John back to their room and test out David's last advice, but part of him, maybe the same part that loved Watson even though he wasn't exactly John, who understood Holmes so well, knew what he really wanted to do right now. "Why don't we sit down and have a chat?" he asked, taking John's hand. "I want to know about your lives."
The Count lunged again, but this time Maria parried, sent back a blow of her own. She stepped away from the wall, and attacked. It was weak, but the Count had to deflect, and he took a step back to do so.
“So I put down my sword and you put down your rock and we’ll try and kill each other like civilized people?”
Holmes looked up through glassy eyes, the needle steady in his hand. “I believe today’s events warrant some kind of exception, Watson.”
I'm curious to see what people think of this vision of the afterlife, it's something I'm starting to develop for an original project. And yes, don't you worry, when the others die they'll get there too.
“Don’t be stupid,” Jamiarty said. He had to make a decision, and make it fast. “You can’t resign. I will need you when I’ve conquered Guilder.”
Waverly flushed. “I didn’t really curse them. The curse wasn’t a real one, and I’ve no magic. But for a minute I…I felt like I did, and it made me brave. And when he stumbled and fell…well. I was free. I didn’t really care how it happened.”
It was Cerise. Sally didn’t stop—couldn’t stop—but she didn’t have to. Her aunt’s arms were swathed in bandages, but there was fire in her eyes.
Ireni leapt to her feet. Sherlock craned his neck. There was only a little moon, but it was enough to see a ship not far beyond, cutting silently through the water. There was a man at the helm, dressed all in black.
“And mine to yours,” John answered, before he was pulled back into the dark, dank room with the leaky faucet. But he was resting in Sherlock’s shaking arms, and Kitty was sobbing “Dad, Dad, Dad!” over and over again. Perhaps it wasn’t such a terrible place after all.
Mary had practiced her signature many times since accepting John’s ring, but she still couldn’t quite believe that it was about to become her permanent name.
“But this is not the only way to promise!” Kitty slammed the cup down. “I’ve already promised him everything I can give, I shouldn’t need a dress and a ring and flowers to show that!”
Mycroft’s gaze softened. “I am glad to hear you say so, but what you said before was untrue. We would all miss you very much if you were gone.”
“Not at all.” Chessa’s teeth gleamed in the torchlight. “We want a safe escort for the new Princess. If there is to be fighting…we will not start it. Is that sufficient.”
“No! I’m not—I have no idea where she would go. I didn’t know about her relationship with the spy. Jamiarty must have.”
Then a dream awakened the song in full, and for the first time it was played openly, each part coming together into an exquisite, triumphant melody that dared the world to bring in minor chords. Nothing was forgotten, but new notes crowded in every day until the darkest, most atonal parts were mere measures in a symphony of contentment.
So rejoice, because it is going to be every day updates! I also apologize in advance for the quality of the duel; I'm not great at writing action scenes.
It was a late night, and no one would be watching them, but the listener drew the curtains before taking the master's ringed hand, pulling him to his feet.
John helped Sherlock down from his horse. His legs were wobbling madly and the world was a bit shakier than usual, but he was lucid and his heart was pumping normally, though it skipped a beat when he saw two elderly people leaving the boat.
But she’d known better. Known that letting Anderson love his daughter, know her as a tiny person, would make it so much worse for him when she finally did take the child.
He never could stand his own injuries. The old fear came back, the one that had grown in the war—that a wounded doctor was worthless.
“Thank you, Jamiarty.” To his own surprise, Sherlock found himself kissing Jamiarty’s cheek, and letting his ex-fiancé hold him for a moment. “I’ll go write that letter.”
Watson reached under his shirt and pulled out the ring Holmes had given him nearly twenty years before. He put it on, sliding it perfectly into place. He reached out and took Holmes’ hand.
“And what if you died on your black-ops mission?” John whispered, voice breaking as he put his hand over Sherlock's. “Would that be Mycroft's job? 'Sorry, Sherlock's dead for real this time, and he never explained his plan to your face'.”
"My old room," John replied. He hesitated. "It might be a bit tricky for you to get up with your ankle."
“Of course, Jim.” And of course Riley could. She’d controlled herself the night the child was born, hadn’t she? She’d swallowed her hurt and her pride and let the child be born, even when she could have done nothing. Could have let her die.
Sally's gone into labour, but childbirth isn't easy, and she's going to need all the help she can get. Meanwhile, Grezzik gets invaded.
. And he's right, because when you're in love with him you believe anything he says, because he must be right." Kitty clenched her fists. "And he's taking her out and rubbing her in my face and I'm dancing in costume, in fucking white-face so I doubt she'd recognize me even if she looked at me properly."
“Hello, my name is Maria Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!” And now her voice was stronger, and the pain was meaningless, and she was standing tall.
New Scotland Yard was bracing itself. All the files were triple checked, open cases were worked on with feverish intensity, and all the coffee had disappeared. Some of the people in the holding cells were infected by the mood too, insisting on confessing.
“Clever Princess. Thank you for not giving me away.” The man in black handed Sherlock a few pieces of cheese. “Eat. You’re going to need your strength.”
The fifth floor was simply entitled “Nemesis”. It was empty, but Prince Jamiarty was sure he would find something someday. Or maybe someone.
It was a simple ring, a gold band with a small diamond set into the ring so it wouldn’t catch on anything. John thought it was beautiful.
Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five that have been rated the most passionate, the most pure, and the most pure. Well, this one, in the back of a carriage at sunrise between a pirate and a Princess, left them all far behind.
Sherlock grabbed Blackwater by the shoulders, shutting up the hissing crowd. "Be quiet," he ordered. "Leave the boy alone."
Three people came out from behind a tree. One was a Spaniard woman, bright hair cut short. The second was, quite simply, a giant: he was nearly as tall as Sherlock was on the horse. The third was a woman, quite as beautiful as Sherlock himself, for those who noticed those things.
"But what about the other girls?" Molly asked, eyes worried. "It's all well and good to say you'll hide Kitty here, but he has two of them on hand. What if..."
It was Grandfather John that met Billy at the station in the pouring rain. The old man—that troubled Billy, since when did he think of Grandpa John as an old man?—was beaming, holding his coat over his head. He pulled Billy into a tight hug and then grabbed his suitcase and hustled them into a small carriage. “How was the train?” he asked, once they were both settled.
“She couldn’t be.” Stam shook his head. “Are you that loyal, cousin? That you would stand behind a child murderer, a kinslayer?”
“Is that any of your business?” his brother replied. But he looked at Lestrade, and John saw a story there, a story that had never gotten past the first sentence.
She fell to her knees, slumping against the wall, pain throbbing through her body. This type of wound could be fatal. Would be fatal.
“Mummy and Daddy will keep you company,” Rachel promised as she danced in front of the group. “Grandfather John, will you tell us a story?”
So they did, one by one. But once they were on the ground, Sherlock didn’t want to let go of John. “I’ll ride with you. We can take an extra horse.” Then Sherlock looked around.
He was gone before he had a chance to cry out, slipping through the sand and falling, drifting down and down. It felt like a supremely itchy cloud, and Sherlock extended his arms and legs and held his breath. He felt absurdly calm. There was nothing he could do right now; the one survivor’s account of the Snow Sand had explained that. Either John could save him, or he would die.
“Sorry we startled you,” the shorter (was it he who spoke?) said. “We’re not looking for any trouble."
“If we start something insane, it’ll go absolutely mad. We won’t have a chance. The only advantage we have is that he doesn’t know where we are.”
"This is none of your business," John hissed. No one was watching them, but he felt his face grow hot. Thank god for ridiculously loud music.
“Oh. Oh, Sherlock.” John held him as tightly as he could, and silently cursed as his husband shook in his hold. “Darling, I won’t let him take you.”
“The Crown calls its first witness,” the King said. “Myself.” He stood up and, amidst the muttering of the crowd, sat in a chair in the no-man’s-land between the royals and the prisoner. “My name is Lotharon, King of Florin. After my first wife died I became despondent. I laid with a member of the Carrier family, Cerise Donovan. She bore me a child, who I named Carla. Three years later, I wanted another child, but Cerise wanted to wed within the Carriers. I agreed to this, and laid with her sister instead, Abigail Donovan. She bore me Sally Donovan, but sadly died in childbirth. When Carla was seven, she went on a trip with myself and Prince Jamiarty. Jamiarty knew that Carla was his sister, though I never made it clear whether she could inherit.”
I've got another request coming up next week--apologies for the delay, but I've been sick the last week or so.
“Delightful.” Mycroft stepped back as Grampy threw down the gangplank. “And Anderson, it’s good to see you. I’m delighted your mission was a success.”
John couldn’t speak until they were out of the block of flats. Then, in as normal a tone as he could manage: “didn’t think Greg would top.”
“Really?” John couldn’t stop the smile that spread across his face. “That’s wonderful! So what’s the prob—oh.”
The collector's room was on the second floor but there was a handy shed under two of the three windows. Sherlock didn't even have to climb the tree next to it. He chose the window in the middle, which allowed him to see most of the room.
She thought Sherlock Holmes was a good man, a good friend to John despite what everyone said, and he’d been nothing less than courteous to her. She was happy to have him in her life.
“No, you bastard. I won't leave him, not willingly. I promised.” John slipped into a fighting stance. “You want me dead? You kill me.” Maybe, just maybe he had a chance. If he could push Moriarty off the side…
They were at dinner, all of them, to celebrate Mycroft actually becoming mayor. It was a village of fifty-eight people, but Sherlock’s parents only had dominion over Watson, six cows, two chickens and a pig. It was an accomplishment.
Once they were upstairs, they broke into a run without speaking, dashing through the halls and secret passages until they were outside once more. Sherlock didn’t stop until they reached the trees, and then he slumped against a tall one, hand on his chest.
The first steps they took in, hand in hand, were tentative and careful. The light dimmed quickly, and when Sherlock looked up he could see only tangled branches and vines. John, looking up the other way, noticed a flicker of movement, and he kept his sword ready. Even in his offhand, he hoped to be quicker than the lurking beast.
Mycroft shook his head nearly imperceptibly. “Why don’t you two get settled aboard? We’re nearly ready to cast off.”
The mourners took comfort in that as they scattered the mingled ashes, half at the beautiful cottage that belonged to Kitty and Stan now, and half through the streets of London.
Sherlock caught the desperate flash of pain in Sally’s eyes. “Why doesn’t Sally take care of them? She will have a biological link to them.”
Maria was so shocked by the Count’s flight she took a second to react. Then she was gone, after him like lightning, dashing down the palace hallways. She could always see a flash of blue as she approached each corner, she had him…
"I'll keep that in mind," John said sincerely, privately thinking that his own migraines left him too nauseous to drink. He'd see how Sherlock felt.
"Sherlock, dear, if I've learned anything from the last twelve years, it's that you are not to be trusted when completing paperwork."
Grezzik laid the man in black on the miracle man’s table. Miracle Max poked his chest a few times, and bent his head and listened.
"Yes. We went walking there early in our courtship, Jamiarty and I. It's going to be a bit of a run."
The very next morning, Count Magnussen came in for his regular visit. But this time, he brought the albino with him. They were pulling a strange contraption with them.
Watson walked forward a few more steps, stopping when he was within arms’ reach. “Sherlock, you told me this was for thinking, making things more clear. Why…in God’s name,
"We'll do it, if you want," John said firmly. "Why don't we mingle for a while and then pretend we've got some write-ups to do? Then we can go home."
But when they stopped for lunch and Sally fed Waverly, Ireni felt a tug on non-existent heartstrings.
Stam hesitated. He didn’t want to give the wrong answer, but this wasn’t the kind of woman you lied to. “He’s dead.”
Sherlock knelt beside him again. “Lie still.” He filled a needle and injected it just below the wound. An icy coolness began to spread up his side. “I don’t know. You spoke to John that night, not me. Shouldn’t you be with him?”
Sherlock clearly didn’t want to discuss it any further. John didn’t press, but he made a mental note to get Mycroft alone and quietly remind him that he was family, and family looked out for each other.
“He told me about the man he loved, gorgeous beyond compare and enduringly faithful. I assume that was you?”
“Because I wanted to get married,” Sherlock said simply. “There were probably, oh, a couple dozen reasons for it, but it all added up to the same. I wanted to get married, so I asked John, and as luck would have it, so did he. That’s part of being in love with someone; your wants do dovetail sometimes. And when they do, why not indulge? Honestly, it’s the most logical part of love, I don’t understand why people have so much trouble with it.”
"He's meeting with one of his informants," John replied. He started up the stove again—omelettes were something he could cook really well, and Kitty looked like she could use some protein.
“No it’s bloody not,” John agreed. “I’ve left you, and you sent me away. We’ve already had those moments, and we can stay together now.”
Enter the albino! By the way, feel free to blame him for wanting to be a character, because that's why it took so long to post this story.
Mike was in the cellar, checking the trap door, raising it and lowering it to make sure that it would be easy to lift no matter how tired or injured Sherlock might be. He didn't expect Moriarty to become physical, of course, but there was always that possibility. There could be some damage from the fire, as well.
“My problem is that I don’t…well, I don’t feel the way other people do. My mother used to tell me someone had stolen my heart when I was a baby. I searched for years for a spell that could do that, to try and reverse it. But it was only a story, a metaphor for my lack of conscience. I used to feel badly about that, but I don’t anymore.”
“And how did it end?” Count Magnussen asked. He was riding, as were the sixteen men the Prince had summoned to chase after the Princess. They’d had to go around the Cliffs, but they’d made up some time.
“Hello, Miss Winter,” I said. “I am glad to see you uninjured, though I must admit that my partner has told me nothing of why you’re here.”
And Sherlock understood. He saw, for the first time ever, two masks shift. He caught a glimpse of something truly terrifying; a man with beating heart without a soul, without conscience, without mercy.
When Molly Hooper was thirty-three, she heard that Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were together at last. There was a queer ache in her chest that morning—something seemed to have gone wrong—but when she saw them together she realized that she’d very quietly gotten over Sherlock Holmes. Mike was ecstatic about ‘Johnlock’, and when he offered to take her to dinner to celebrate she accepted.
Well, this marks the end of this story, which makes me a little bit sad; it was fun to write, and fun to see everyone react, especially to cliffhangers :) If you're interested in the Supernatural fandom, I'll be starting a new story on Saturday. I will come back to Sherlock, though it'll be a few months most likely. I'm also open to writing oneshots in this verse, and who knows? I might write another story if I can figure out a good plot.
"I suppose loving minds think alike," Sherlock replied, practically dragging John inside. "I've got one too."
They were ringing so badly he didn’t hear the giant until he was right in front of him and there was a blade at his throat.
“Why do you want to promise the man you love that you’ll be with him forever?” Sherlock asked. “I think that’s fairly obvious.”
“Yes, Father.” Sally looked at Queen Bella. “I’d…I’d be proud to call you Mother. I never knew mine.”
The Royal Road went through London for a mile to the north, and they headed that way. Waverly was quiet, tucked against her mother’s chest, and none of the adults spoke either. It was a dull way to ride, but they had no choice. Once they were on the Road they were under Jamiarty’s jurisdiction once again. Disguise was useless for Grezzik, but a touch of magic made him seem just tall, rather than gigantic. The three women were wrapped in thick cloaks. It would have to be enough.
Thanks to everyone again for reading and commenting, it's made everything lovely, and a lot of things possible.
“I'm sorry,” Sherlock whispered. “I wanted—well, when this plan was made, I thought you wouldn't care.”
Greg grinned at John. “Absolutely. Though you might have to put up with me shouting at the television. The sheer amount of shoddy police work…”
The fog became even thicker, far too quickly to be natural, and Holmes drew Watson down the path. When they looked back a moment later, the fog was beginning to clear, the lamplight was normal and their strange meeting was over.
John stepped back, closed his eyes. His left hand was trembling.  He turned around and walked up the stairs to his old room. A few seconds later, Sherlock heard the door slam.
“Grezzik, row quickly. I can take Waverly.” Molly tucked the baby into her arms. Waverly cooed up at her, and Molly couldn’t help but smile. Holding this child that wasn’t her own, she wondered if maybe she was ready to be a mother at last. She couldn’t fathom the idea when she was looking for Count Rugen, because she was a failure as a daughter. But Janine wanted kids (and needed them, for the throne)…perhaps they could have a child now.
Moriarty chuckled. “Known about what? Your fuckbuddy's little plan to make me dance to his tune, to make me think I'd won then bang! Snatch the game away?”
John leaned back against Sherlock. "You do realize you're sending them to the British Inquisition for Dating, right?"
“The letter, I mean. Jamiarty killed Carla, so he must have written the letter or got someone else to do so, but he doesn’t want to be King. He told me so when he hired me to kidnap Sherlock.”
That was certainly true. These people were all around Sally’s age or Male. They were looking for a Female, man or woman.
"No, a detective case," Grandad John explained. "We're detectives, you see, when we're not being grandfathers."
Whatever they were doing, Holmes and Watson and Sherlock and John were finally safe, finally able to enjoy themselves and be happy without the scars of the past and without fear of discovery.
Lestrade gave them a watery smile. “You both know that now; you’ve promised that today, and I know you’ve promised it for life. So let’s raise our glasses to the newlyweds, and let them have their first dance as husbands.”
The old hands were shaking, but they were stronger than Sally remembered. “Father, you look well.” She blushed—it was such a change of subject, but something had occurred to her. “Have you been healing?”
“Huge, black. Its eyes were glowing.” Sherlock’s eyes were wild. “Once you’ve eliminated everything possible—”
Sherlock flexed his hands and stepped a bit closer to John. “I used to think that it was a chemical defect, one that proper training could overcome. All it did was make you weak, and that was hardly useful. So I decided I didn’t need it. Then you came along and proved me right—violently right, because work was no longer enough. I couldn’t sleep with you having nightmares, I forced myself to eat to stop the worry in your eyes, and I felt fear for the first time since childhood when you were threatened. And of course, I thought you didn’t feel anything for me, and I was wasting my time. In short, love made me a fool, a weak one.”
“After you helped the Princess escape, Jamiarty took me to his room. There was a book there, a diary full of his crimes. He asked me to read it, and tell me where I stopped. He wouldn’t blame me for stopping.” His cousin still wouldn’t meet his eyes. “I finished the whole book, and told him I was still his. That’s loyalty, Stamford.”
John pulled Sherlock down and leaned his forehead against his, closing his eyes as he took a deep, desperate breath. “I don't want you to go.”
Moriarty was Holmes’ equal in one important way; he never fully understood that the doctor loved the detective just as fiercely.
“Sherlock?” John sounded tired and…sore, the way he sounded after a long day of work and chasing criminals. Sherlock’s heart ached in response.
"I AM HIM!" Moriarty's howl split the morning quiet. "He is me, I am him—we're two freaks against the entire world, dancing in the same hellfire! He should never have thought about anyone else. But you, you were the player I didn't anticipate. The third wheel. We were supposed to destroy each other, Watson. Now I'll watch you destroy him."
Kitty stared at him and then threw her head back and laughed, setting her mug on the table. "Wow, Doctor, you're surprisingly non-judgmental. But that's not my problem, I could have gotten out of that years ago. I just don't know what else to do, you see. I'm good at this."
Seb was pacing again when Stam came down. He didn’t look up when Stam slid the tray through the small opening in the door.
He clubbed her head, and the last thing Maria felt was someone laying her gently on the ground. “Good luck, Molly.”
They popped the corks out on the balcony, sending them soaring onto the beach. According to Sherlock's calculations, they could go down to the beach tomorrow and pick them up just under one of the palm trees, well out of anyone's way. John just smiled and sipped the champagne.
As the four of them made their way through the halls, Maria heard footsteps. “They’re coming,” she warned. “Give John his sword.”
Janine looked insulted. “We’re pretending to be worshippers of the Lady of Spring! She is my patron, after all.”
"It's the one that's real to me. It's not my name right now, but my name right now doesn't belong to me. By rights I don't belong to me."
“It was my throne!” Jamiarty burst out. “They would never have it, never! It was mine!” Then he went still. For a long moment he was silent, and then he started to laugh, long and horrible. “Oh, I’ve done it now, haven’t I? Alright, I did it. I murdered that little bitch, and if I’d known Sally was alive, I would have killed her too. What can you do to me, really? Kill me?”
Labour had taken a major toll on her body, and she still felt the soreness. Walking was getting easier, but she was reminded of her daughter with every step.
Now there were definitely people staring. John swallowed and lowered his gaze. "Of course you'll get bored of me."
“We would have had two more years together,” John whispered. “And my foolish pride…I couldn’t even go and check. If I’d seen you…”
Raz shook his head. “They still need their trial, and the King isn’t back yet. Jamiarty has sent for him. What’s…” he looked around. “What’s happening, Princess?”
It was strangely, wonderfully perfect, then, that all Sherlock wanted to say back was “I love you, too.”
“Her sister,” Moran replied. “Sally’s child is fine. She is safe with her mother. But the dead girl…that was unfair.”
Watson took his hand in his, stroking the long fingers tenderly. “I…yes,  I think that would be lovely. I will be your husband, and I don’t care if only we know it.”
“But if—if he says that—if he had you, and he told me if I came back you could live…I don’t know if I’m brave enough to say no.”
“Are you sure?” John asked. There was something strange in his voice, something Sherlock had rarely heard. It was fear and pain, all mixed up.
“Fair enough. The first night you agreed to work for me sober, I promised you a boon. You never asked me for anything, though.”
Mycroft’s carriage was deep black, and the driver wore a mask. She tied the white horses to the back, and the whites stood patiently and let her do it.
"If that's what you want to do, you should talk it over with Marge," John answered. He'd no children, of course, but he could understand the love in Bradstreet's eyes. "If she agrees...you're a brilliant policeman, Bradstreet, and it'd be a shame if you left, but this is about what's best for you and your family."
“So he never wrote about it until later,” Stam mused. “Perhaps he thought he was out of danger by then.”
“I don’t mean that.” John cast his mind around, desperate to reassure Sherlock. “For example, are you sure that it was a real dog? Could it be an animatronic?”
Grezzik went to look too, bringing Sherlock with him. The man in black was hanging onto the cliff, clinging for dear life, and as Sherlock watched he began to climb.
“Meanwhile,” Philip said loudly, “I think Princess Janine and Duke Mycroft ought to stay here with the delegates and determine the best international options for dealing with this problem.”
The white horses Jamiarty was so proud of were now a dull brown. It was a special paint, the only way that they could cover the needed distance without showing the world, “hey, we have the Prince’s whites!”
Greg clapped him on the shoulder. "Well, you take care of your girl, you two. I've got to say, whoever did it, it was a masterful defenestration."
Greg whistled cheerfully as he came into work that Wednesday morning. He waved to Dimmock, sorted his paperwork without the usual groaning, and was pleasant to everyone who spoke to him, even Anderson.
Those furthest out in the country saw the messengers last, and by then they were weary of describing the beauty of the Princess. Those slightly closer to the capital heard stories of a man beautiful beyond compare, and those closer still actually saw a sketch (most of the sketches were torn to pieces before they got past the first town).
John swallowed hard. The sun was coming up now, and he could see that they were alone on the rooftop. Not that that was really much help; his gun, after all, was in Moriarty's hand, and even his army training was unlikely to save him if he attacked Moriarty head on. Best to play along.
The sound of a speeding car drew John's attention. Mike's old car was coming down the road. John's breath caught in his throat. When he turned back it was a second too late; Moriarty had the gun drawn now.
He did. Watson could feel his wedding ring pressing against his heart under his shirt as he held Holmes.
“Thank you, Grandfather John.” Billy walked to the other side of the bed and wound his arms around Holmes’ neck. “Thank you for everything you’ve taught me. Everything…I love you both so much…”
“I love you too, Sherlock.” Watson reached up and took his hand, held it close, fingers brushing over the wedding band.
The song was worked upon constantly, and for the first time written down, music into ink, heart into paper. Each note was slaved upon as the master tried to place the music that had so long been at his fingertips into permanent record. His listener had words; he had notes. This was his gift, and it needed to be the best.
Kitty fumed, but she eventually gave in, helped along by Mycroft agreeing to step in. She spent most of her maternity leave at Molly’s, looking after the children. Stan painted the spare bedroom a bright, cheerful jungle, with animals peeking out from the trees.
. John agrees (though he doesn’t need it that often at all). They make it just over a week before they’re both too exhausted and cranky to cuddle, let alone have sex. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, they both laugh about it and from then on they make love only when they both want to. There’s plenty of other things to do, after all.
“You know, those mundane little habits that people pick up in childhood and never get rid of?” Sherlock ached to watch his lover’s face, but he knew that wasn’t a good idea.
And Sherlock, who had climbed up every flight of stairs at St. Bart's to personally inspect the corpse of his worst enemy, who had fallen in love with a man who'd killed for him twenty-four hours after they met, did.
“Well, it was a stormy night over twenty years ago, and we’d just come home from a supper with our clients…”
John groaned as they made their way through Scotland Yard. "Why did you have to solve so many cases while I was ill?"
The cases referenced in this story are 'The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle', 'The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax' and 'The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone' (I couldn't resist when I saw the page's name was Billy).
Billy wasn't quite sure why Mummy laughed or Granddad Sherlock scowled, but he smiled anyways. "That's good, Grandad! Daddy says you should always keep learning!"
The song was banished, coming out only in feeble, weak moments and movements, a nostalgic push for a past that wasn't real, a future that never would be. The master despised himself, but there were times that the song was the only way to keep from going insane, from abandoning any and all logic that kept him alive. So he played.
Right now all she could think about was making sure that in this time of sickness, her fathers could still be together, without anyone finding out what they meant to each other. She and her little family would protect them.
“Compared to those,” Watson whispered, “this fear is nothing at all. And so I enjoy my life far more.”
King Lotharon bowed his head as his son was dragged from the room. Cerise approached the table, and gave the King her hand. “Our daughter has justice now, at least.”
Sherlock’s long limbs wrapped around him as tightly as they could, and John hugged him back as tightly as he could. “It’s alright, love. You’re safe as anything, I promise. I’m not going anywhere.”
The moment she told the other’s her suspicions, they accepted it. Immediately. “Everything you said makes sense,” Sherlock told her, a rare compliment.
She needed to eat to keep her strength up, to make sure she had enough milk for Waverly. But what if it took days for Grezzik and Molly to return? Or weeks?
The group in the South returns to the capital, Molly decides on her favour, and some unexpected company sparks the beginning of the end for Jamiarty.
“You do not decide that. Only the Prince decides our names. And so we are whores.” The woman closed her eyes. “You are a liar, and you will hear nothing from me but the words of a common whore, and what are they worth?”
Sherlock hesitated, then patted the bed next to him. John came over slowly, sitting carefully on the edge of the bed. Sherlock held out his hand and John took it.
“Tell me a story, Grandfather?” Billy asked hopefully. That was what he missed most about Grandfather John—his endless supply of adventures.
Well, that wraps up this part of Kitty's story--don't worry, there'll be more to come down the road (cough Stan cough). Just to be clear, it's hard to adopt a 24 year old girl without a birth certificate, but having the British Government as your older brother does have some nice perks.
Sebastian finally met Stam’s gaze with empty eyes. “Cousin, my hands aren’t clean either. I’m a spymaster. There are parts of that job that …well, they were no worse than anything in that diary.”
If some of you think Ireni's method of resurrection is familiar, that's because it is. I borrowed it from Supernatural.
"I know the theory," Holmes interrupted. Watson raised his eyebrows, and Holmes blushed. "I was...researching."
And now she had no one to fight; she beat every master she came across. There was nothing more to work for. There was nothing left.
They were all waiting for Mycroft to return, and when he did a shudder ran through them all. He’d only been gone ten minutes. That wasn’t a good sign.
“Thank you.” Sally waited for Grezzik to help her down, so she caught the interested look between Kate and Ireni. Shame there wasn’t time for that. Kate might be up for that challenge.
“I thought Regents Park,” Holmes said, undeterred by Watson’s grumpy tone. “Do come, London’s lovely by night.”
That next day was a difficult one for Mycroft. The strains of running the British Government were more noticeable when you were nearing seventy two, and Mycroft found himself wondering, for the first time, whether it might be time to retire.
Sherlock helped her to a chair. “Sit, your Highness. You know that they’ll bring Waverly as fast as they can.”
“Agreed. The only matter of any difficulty is the first dance. Sherlock insisted upon that tradition, but he seems rather stuck.”
“That is not my choice, Highness. I do not like to kill the innocent. But I promise you that Ireni will keep her word. You will not die in pain.”
John and Roger Dimmock stood for Stan, and Molly, Lily and Jacob were in Kitty’s party. Mike had been persuaded to officiate again, and Mycroft oversaw directing people to their seats, a bit tricky when so many of the guests hadn’t seen each other in years. Trauma has a way of creating bonds that can stand the test of time, and the bride-to-be had spent her doe night catching up with her former co-workers.
When Mary Morstan was six,  Father fell down the stairs. If there was anything suspicious at all about his death, none of the neighbours said a word. Mummy had to talk to some policemen, but they said that no one was in trouble. It might be best, one of the lady police added, to move somewhere else, where there were flowers and nice people. They moved the next day, and Mary was much happier, because she didn’t have to be afraid anymore, and Mummy was home more, and the two of them planted a garden.
“Quite.” Sukiv’s voice was almost as musical as Riley’s. “And right now it looks as though Jamiarty is inviting conflict. Is the child alright, Princess?”
Next week is the first multi-part story, which shares a certain...theme, shall we say? with this one. Thanks for reading!
Moran left, and before he did Sherlock had moved across the room. There were daggers on the Prince’s desk.
"Trying to get some information out of his contacts, see if he can find any weaknesses with Gruner. If at all possible we want to do this without violence—Gruner's powerful, and any little slip could cause a lot of trouble for far too many people."
But as John pulled him out, and he took his first breath, the cave overflowed. Too much emotion had been hidden, and his heart was stitched back together but it still ached, and Sherlock started to scream. Long, drawn out screams that echoed around the Fire Swamp.
Miracle Max nodded, looking weary. “The year Jamiarty was ten, I was travelling in the fall. I went to…well.” He looked at John. “Your Grandmother and I went to visit your parents.”
"Idiot," he said fondly. "Tell you what, as much as I love showing you off, if you don't really want to stay we can leave. We can go for drinks with Dimmock and Greg some other time, you know."
Maria's not giving up on John, and Stam the albino offers a solution at a little cottage deep in the woods...
Sherlock thought back to the marks he’d seen on John’s back, his shoulders. He’d known they were too old to be from war, too deliberate to be from rugby accidents…but he hadn’t asked.
John had plenty of reasons to curse Moriarty—kidnapped children, really? If he had to blame them for something, that was truly the worst he could do—but he was too winded from running to lay out proper damnations. They were running roughly in the direction of Kitty Riley's flat: there, Sherlock assured him, Moriarty would be hiding under a fake name. John knew they had to get there as quickly as possible, that Sherlock's life depended on him keeping one step ahead of Moriarty, but he needed a rest.
The song did play again at last, but it was wistful now, humbled into melancholy remembrance of pain caused and pain suffered. Late at night, quiet to keep anyone from waking, delicate, slow pizzicato plucked on heartstrings wrung nearly dry of tears.
Watson wasn’t much fun to torment, but Sherlock did the best he could. “Watson, clean Skull. Watson go and fetch me some of the flowers that open at midnight. Think of a name for them. Watson, can’t you hurry up?”
"No." Rachel wiped her eyes and lifted her chin. "But I'll...I'll try." Her lips trembled. "Goodbye Grandfather John." She kissed Holmes' cheek. "Goodbye, Grandfather Sherlock. I'll be the best dancer ever, I promise." She got off the bed and ran out of the room.
Lestrade waited for a reply nearly two weeks. At first he was merely concerned, but it had turned to outright panic by the time a parcel appeared, addressed in shaky writing.
“You’re wrong about the first,” Moran said. “But there is no reason that people have to believe either story.”
There was a time in his life where Holmes was naive enough to believe that his brother was growing less irritating with age. He firmly stomped down the voice which suggested that perhaps he had become more tolerant, and honestly thought that he and his brother might be able to be...well...brothers.
“I would be honoured to be related to a girl—no, a woman of such bravery and strength,” I said firmly. “Welcome to the family, Miss Kate Watson.”
Molly thought the same thing when she fell asleep next to Janine. But the next morning she woke up to see Stam looking down at them, and knew there was more to be done.
“Don't make this kind of decision without me again. Please, dear, I can't bear thinking we're safe, that we've got no secrets and then find out something like this.”
The woman's husband, by far the most innocent of the four, was wracked with remorse for the pain he was putting his wife through. She'd wanted this as much as he, but he wasn't the one upstairs, he wasn't the one who was risking everything to bring a child into the world. Could he ever make it up to her? Only, he figured, by being the best father he could be, and that wasn't an easy thought, having never known a father.
“And Sherlock didn't do it? What a surprise. Don't bother with apologies, we're going to prove it if it's the last thing I do.”
Sherlock startled, and the crowd fell silent. The woman was old, bent with age, and her face was twisted with hate.
Then, as luck would have it, Sherlock came in the door. Mycroft and Greg were with him, hand in hand. The room went completely silent.
John took a deep breath, forbidding himself to throw his phone across the room or shout; anything that might frighten Sherlock. He knew about dozens of hallucinogens and their varieties, but this was…this was something different. This was just for fear, a horrible, maddening fear. Henry was just a kid, for fuck’s sake, barely twenty two. John was going to find the monster who thought that was okay, and he was going to dose the fucker with his own poison and tie him up in a room with an endless loop of horror films in the background.
“I’ll create some magical distractions within the Castle grounds,” Ireni explained. “Chessa, Sukiv and the Hudsons will stay here to keep the villagers from coming to the Castle.”
Watson’s nerves were now thoroughly upset, and he couldn’t restrain a quiet yelp of shock as two figures, a couple hand in hand, emerged from the fog. Their shapes were indistinct; all Watson could tell was that one was quite taller than the other. The light from the strange lamp did little to clear things up.
“It’s weird that way,” Ireni muttered. She wasn’t sweating—the sun didn’t bother her. But she was sure Waverly needed to cool off.                 S
Even through the closed door he could hear for himself that Kitty and Stan were still arguing furiously.
Sherlock craned his neck. The man in black’s ship was now at the base, but the man wasn’t in it. To Sherlock’s shock, the man was…
Sherlock tried to grab the giant’s hand, but it closed around his neck gently and pressed against the side, sending him into darkness.
King Jamiarty gave his consent, and Sherlock went down. The crowd parted for him, and he walked in his long coronation robe…
John did as he asked, his eyes fixed on the Count, who was now resting his hand on a lever. It was currently resting at 0, but the scale went up to 50. He closed his eyes. He didn’t need to see what was going to happen. He needed to focus on the techniques Murray had coached him in, how to shield your mind from pain no matter how terrible…Sherlock stood beside him…
"You'll have to show me, then," Watson smiled. "Dear heart, if we try and it does not work, then it does not work. But it is worth a try, so why not? We will learn together."
Holmes brushed Watson’s words away. “Come along, get dressed and be quiet about it,” he said. “We mustn’t wake Mrs. Hudson.”
Sherlock helped him over, and John fell into Nana and Grampy’s arms. “I can’t believe it,” he whispered. “You’re alive, you’re here…”
"Of course, of course," Hopkins babbled. He dashed up the stairs. Watson watched him with gentle eyes.
“That depends on what you’re controlling. I can ensure that the child will be healthy, but other parts need more time. What are you thinking?”
The next day they rode out together and found Sherlock in the woods, tending to a patch of strange flowers.
John kept quiet as Count Magnussen began attaching suction cups to his chest, his arms, his legs, his hands and feet, and either side of his head.
“Nothing.” John wished his hands were free, but they couldn't spare the lock-picking time. “I'm just...I want this over.”
And it was that simple. That was the one part of being the Dread Pirate Roberts John actually missed; the instinctive way people followed the orders of their leaders. It was clear from the near instantaneous clear up that the inhabitants of the castle loved their King as much as they hated their Prince. A few protested, and they were put in the dungeons as well, but everyone else pitched in to clean up the mess, tend to the wounded, and took themselves off to bed without a murmur.
Ireni was on the shore, busily ripping at a red cloak. She attached it to the Princess’ horse. “It’s fabric from a Guilder soldier’s uniform.”
John swallowed his nausea. It had been his idea to include Greg, his insistence that the DI was their friend and he deserved to know at least part of the plan. They'd told him late at night, near one in the morning. He had thought Donovan had left with Anderson. His mistake.
“No, Jamiarty. Looks like I’ve found my limit at last.” Moran cleared his throat. “Jamiarty mentioned a poison called eliswhite. It fills the lungs with dust, causing the victim to cough and their head to burn with fever. Its telltale sign is the remarkable pallor of the skin of the victims, no matter their colour in life.”
John woke with a groan. He sat up gingerly, putting a hand to his head. It was sore, dried blood coming away onto his fingers. He was cold, his whole body stiff, though whether that part was from temperature or from lying on the concrete he couldn't tell.
After a few arguments in the kitchen (Molly had to intervene about the proper wine to have with the potatoes), they all gathered together at the table. Well, John allowed as he sat down, it was actually three tables jammed together, one from Mike and Molly’s, one Mycroft had delivered, and one that was actually a night table from the room upstairs.
Sherlock put his laptop down. “If it was just dropping in, then why didn’t they just do it? They’re home now, they live just down the road. No, something’s up.”
“He definitely would have.” Sherlock was on his feet now, pacing. “If he called her a friend, that meant she actually spoke with him in confidence. Which means that even if this wasn’t the plan, he won’t be shocked. He’ll just go after her, hunt her down with the child.”
John thought it over. “She’s gonna ask him to marry her now and get it over with. He won’t let it slip until morning.”
“We will.” They said that as one, and Sherlock beamed. Maybe John was right. Maybe they were done being apart forever. After all, they’d just promised.
The Count stared at her curiously. “Are you…are you that little Spanish bitch I taught a lesson to all those years ago?”
“On the contrary,” Watson bowed, hoping they could see. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. Again,” he dared to add, hoping that was not against some hidden rule.
"Just like it's something I never thought that I would want," Sherlock answered. He added quickly "and I do want it, John, of course I do."
“Well, yes, that's the idea.” Moriarty shrugged, his eyes going cold. “It's the personal touch, you see. Coming from me it would just be an act of war—this? This is an act of love, desperate, painful love! It will haunt him forever. I'm really going to enjoy watching that. Shame you won't see it.”
“Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something.” The man in black paused. “Actually, I think I might remember your farm boy. He was a cabin boy. I could tell you about our meeting. Would it bother you to hear?”
“He’s beaten Molly!” Grezzik whispered. His heart ached; Molly was his only friend. The Princess peered at the man in surprise.
Upstairs? Watson looked around. The room was incredibly messy, clothes askew everywhere and piles of commonplace books teetered on every table.
“Of course you wouldn’t understand that.” John had a sword at his side, and he tilted the blade. “I’ll explain, and I’ll use small words so that your small mind may understand.”
John was holding him, and the screams turned to sobs and shaking all over, and Sherlock clung to John as tightly as he could. As the shaking began to die down at last, Sherlock realized John was covered in sand too.
Jamiarty's boredom had disappeared, and his eyes darted wildly between Cerise and his father. “You can’t mean it. The punishment for a traitor is death!”
Sherlock didn’t sleep that night. He paced his tiny room (17 steps around the bed exactly) and tried to unravel it. There was no way on earth that the strong, blonde farm boy would love him. Why, he was cruel to him! He ordered him about, constantly, even when they were both children and sometimes Watson would cry for his parents. He never cried now, his eyes like the sea after a storm calm and patient as he listened for Sherlock’s commands.
“No,” Kitty said vehemently. “God, everyone thinks all we do is have rows, you must all be bloody shocked that we’re together at all!” Her hands clenched around the teacup.
Lestrade was happily married (to a woman who was mistress to six different men) with one daughter (who moved to Scotland to get married and rarely came to visit due to financial difficulties though she did write to her father faithfully), and never once thought that there might be another kind of happiness.
“Got taken for treason, remember?” The man’s skin was as dark as Sally’s. “S’all right, Alissa. Jamiarty’s gone off his rocker.”
anniversary of Florin, which was when they would be married. It was the first time in the three years they’d known one another that they had proper conversations, and Sherlock found that he enjoyed them. There was more to running a kingdom than he thought, and learning about it from Jamiarty, who did know what he was talking about, was enjoyable.
Also, I'm not sure if 'holocaust cloak' is still okay, or whether it was ever okay, but William Goldman is Jewish, it was always lower-case h, and the word once just meant 'destruction caused by fire'. If anyone has any comments on that, please tell me, I'd like to know more.
Sherlock didn’t speak, just buried his face in John’s neck and cried. He didn’t make a sound—rarely did when he cried. He just shook and breathed in John’s scent, because John was still here and that was
“Well, what my plan has been from the beginning, Johnny!” Moriarty smiled brightly. “Come on, walk with me.”
When they got to their room, John started to take Sherlock's clothes off. "It'll help you sleep more comfortably," he said as Sherlock protested. "Eyes closed, dear." When Sherlock was in boxers John laid him down on the bed. Sherlock didn't have a fever so he tucked him under the blankets, then released his hand.
Footsteps came from down the hall, and Watson tensed. A tall, pale man clothed in a strange robe walked in and did a double-take. “Who are you?”
John stood in front of him, hands in his pockets. His eyes looked funny, though they weren’t red. He’d probably not been blinking enough, Sherlock deduced—John did that when he was upset, it was one of his tells.
He fought twenty, thirty, forty people at once, but it wasn’t enough. And the crowd began to boo again. Grezzik was now over seven feet tall, several hundred pounds, and he was so strong that he could…well, climb the Cliffs of Insanity using only his arms.
Molly had never seen a room transform from a trial for child murder to a party quite so quickly. Gone was the prisoner’s chair, the witness chair, the table for the royals, gone was the solemn crowd. The huge curtains were drawn back, revealing quite a nice big ballroom, and by the time the luncheon feast was served, there was music and everyone was dancing.
Grezzik brought his hands up, trying to shake the man’s grip, but he was having trouble getting his hands up. In fact, he was starting to have trouble seeing.
"I'm alright." Kitty's voice was gruff and John wondered whether she was embarrassed about the night before. He wanted to reassure her, but he wasn't quite sure how.
“I want to,” she said frankly. “It’s my home, Hell or not, and with a new face I might be able to find another start.”
John laughed. “Yes, indeed. Murray was the third in the line. The real Roberts lives in Patagonia like a king. Anyways, he wanted to pass the title on to me. And I asked him to let me go instead, if he didn’t mind, because I had to get back to you. But he told me with a couple of good raids, I’d have enough money to take you anywhere in the world, and we could travel without care of money. And I thought…well, what was a little more time? I wasn’t worth much to you otherwise.”
This time it was dreamless until he woke in Holmes’ room at Baker Street to bandaged ribs, a sleep-deprived husband and a saint of a landlady who could provide a spectacular breakfast at a moment’s notice.
“I don’t think I can…really process talk,” John admitted, surprised by how tired he suddenly felt. “Just…this is nice.”
What is the mystery song? Will the wedding go well? Tune in next time for the answer to one of those questions, and the time after for the other! (I swear it makes sense). Cheers!
“You’re no such thing,” John said sternly. “You know better than that.” He waited for Sherlock to chime in, but when he turned to look at his husband, he was smiling.
"Yes." The word was forced out through barely open lips. Sherlock's forehead was covered in a thin sheen of sweat.
Miss Winters laughed. “Of course he didn’t! Goodness, you two are funny.” Her eyes no longer sparked with fury and pain; they glinted with spirit instead. “Well, Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes has offered to help me disappear, hence the change of appearance. I do believe dark hair suits me, don’t you?”
“I know a little about healing,” Watson answered. “My…my mother was a healer. She learned it from her father. This is his book.”
“I’m afraid that simply won’t do,” he answered, looking Mycroft in the eye. “If I do that, then we will both become lonely. We will suffer from lack of interaction, and might end up doing something desperate that will certainly give us away. We are satisfied with what we have now, though it is not what we want.”
