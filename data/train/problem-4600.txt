got his wallet from his jacket pocket. Castiel sat there a moment before getting up and walking off, disappearing from the area entirely.
He watched as Cas and Nut booped noses and he thought his heart was going to wave a white flag and keel over dead in his chest. This was it, this was fucking happiness.
They talked for over an hour before Cas was ready for something much stronger than coffee, especially to stay awake talking to
With a mischievous grin, Dean bites the skin and lifts Cas up off the ground to move faster. “You ready, Cas? If you want me to hit the brakes, I will. Last chance to keep ‘im in the cage.”
Dean didn’t miss the change in Cas’ voice. “I know you don’t have a damn reason to trust me on this, but use it if you need it. I’ll stop.” He slid off the bed and got undressed, then climbed back up between Cas’ legs with a bottle of lube and a knife. His voice took on a steel tone as he raked his nails up Cas’ thighs. “Seems you need a reminder of who you belong to, angel. I’m not gonna make you beg for my cock ‘cause I know you won’t, but I
“No? Why not? Guy like you must have a boyfriend or something.” He flashed a flirty grin.
He nodded, sending her off and then heading into the bedroom. Yet again, he had the same damn internal struggle over what to do with his clothes but decided once again to just strip. He wrapped the blindfold around his head and secured it so no matter how he tilted his head, he wouldn't catch a glimpse... and then used the last couple of minutes he had to stroke himself. Dean made an effort to not think about Cas' voice, his stubble, that hand or that damn tongue... but he failed miserably, and by the time he heard the front door shut, he was harder than hell. He dropped his hand and tried to control the wild beating of his heart.
“It wasn’t stupid. It’s okay to be curious about it. Especially after a dude sucked your cock. Just don’t pressure yourself to choose. I’m gay, because a chick couldn’t get my dick hard if she had a buzz cut and a strap-on. But that is just me. I can’t tell you what you are.” Cas actually sounded completely non-judgmental that time, and there was no laughter involved.
Cas let Dean climb in first and then Cas climbed back. And laid on his chest. Yeah, it wasn’t the most comfortable but Cas hoped it brought Dean comfort the way it brought him comfort. “We need to disappear, Dean,” Cas spoke in a whisper.
Dean had to take a moment again. Things were getting… flirtatious. Not that,
After a moment, Cas licks his lips. “I... haven’t gotten off in a while. Not since we...”
was enough that Dean loved every wretched second of it. He’d never known anything but violence and this felt right at home for him. Dean’s entire being was engulfed in bittersweet flames and he didn’t know how much more he could honestly stand; Cas felt a lot fucking bigger buried in his tight ass than he
Another annoying thing was his ability to suddenly find Dean - no matter how crowded the room was. He didn’t know why, but he somehow stood out in the sea of hormones, regardless of what he was doing. Sometimes, he was just sitting there doing homework or stuffing his face like he might never see food again. Cas wasn’t even looking for him, his eyes just somehow found him.
Cas choked on his beer and looked over at her with wide eyes. “What?”
Cas cried out again. “Sorry,
Top was in purple, bottom was in orange, straight was in red and vers — aka switch — was in black. “Go figure all these tops keep coming at me, Cas... I’m a damn top.”
Dean saw the grin on Cas’ face and knew exactly what
and Cas treated him as though he was no more than the cows that used to hang there. “Dammit David.” Cas shook his head. “Let me help you out.”
Dean was laid out, pants around his ankles, t-shirt rucked up near his neck. He stared dazedly at the come that was cooling on him.
“That was when I learned to stick to whiskey and not vodka.” He walked over and handed Dean a beer. “I felt so guilty about it.“
fallen for Cas. He couldn’t deny it anymore, not that he even had the strength to. Once again, Dean was alone. He walked over to Cas’ bed and climbed inside, smiling sadly, surrounded by Cas’ scent.
Dean ran his hands over his angels body, his eyes darkening with lust. “It’s all of you, Cas. You know that.” He grabbed a handful of Cas’ hair and tugged back, exposing his neck. “Every inch of you is perfect, and every fucking centimeter is
Somehow, looking around him, he doesn’t doubt it. That feeling only intensifies when the door opens for a final time and a tall, insanely gorgeous god walks through the door. A couple of people yell out: “Dean!” which only confirms Cas' suspicion, and suddenly… he's starting to regret choosing to sit things out.
He could feel his orgasm looming, but the quiet pleas and whimpers coming from Cas were so intoxicating that he couldn’t bring himself to stop. Dean could feel Cas’ pace quickening rapidly, and his own sped up in response.
He spent about eight seconds thinking about Cas’ mouth and that perfect ass, and the blood rushing to his dick was answer enough.
Dean almost forgets this is fake, and he grins back at him. “Yet, huh?” He can’t help but flirt, had they met under different circumstances, Dean would be hitting on Cas in a heartbeat. “I use words. Just not as much as he wants. I say things when I feel it’s necessary.”
Dean shivered from the unexpected intensity and broke the kiss, resting his forehead against Cas’ chest and curling his fingers against his angel’s back. He was overwhelmed by how normal he felt, how
“Yeah, course. You’re not leavin’ already, right?” For a split second, Dean looked worried.
“No, I swear. He was runni—” Castiel swings his arm to point in the direction he saw a cow running down the street, but when he does he hits a man in the head so hard he makes an

He took a moment to breath, he was about to call some stranger, simply because he needed to hear the voice that went with this strange sense of humor.

“Not yet, Cas. Waited too damn long for this.” He strokes himself as he stares down at Cas’ shaking, flushed body. “And if you think Cap doesn’t tease the shit outta Bucky in bed, you haven’t been watchin’ the same movies I have.”
Every so often, a passing thought would cross his mind. He would realize how wrong this is, how dangerous. But he always used protection... okay not
“I know you don’t handle compliments well, I don’t expect you to say anything. I ju-” Dean paused when Cas walked closer, surprised when he didn't stop at a reasonable distance. “Cas, personal space.” Dean waved a finger in the mere inches of space between them.
“Dean, are you okay? Let’s go inside. Nice cup, I had no idea.” Dean nodded and followed her inside.

“Yeah, well, this way we are close, maybe we can be roommates.” Dean blushed when Cas sat back up to stare at him.
He groaned when Dean bit him and didn’t pull away in the slightest, nearly coming the second Dean’s hand wrapped around his throat. “Dunno Sir, no one’s ever got me to beg,” Cas grunted out. He suddenly wondered if Dean could get him to do the one thing he said he’d never do.
“Uh huh. That’s a new one.

Dean turned on the tv and sat down, angling the remote to try and get a better look at the controls. He could count on one hand the amount of times he’d ever watched tv in his life, but he assumed it couldn’t be

Dean, as if Cas needed any more reminders.
“Sorry, that was too much information.”
Dean sighed and took another swig of beer. “He’s also doing Oxy, from what he tells his brother it isn’t much but I don’t know if I believe it.” Charlie sat up and raised her eyebrows.

Cas shook his head. “Nope. Do you know mine?” He asked in a doubtful tone.
” Dean asked, Nick nodded hesitantly. “Okay, thanks. You won’t regret this, alright.” Dean patted Nick on the arm. He turned to leave but decided to ask, “Why did you call him disgusting?” Dean asked slightly amused but weary his questions would make Nick close off again.
Cas laughed. “Ever thought you’d have a...

His fingers hesitated over the keys for way too long, but he eventually sent one last text.

, but he wasn’t some deviant that couldn’t take a hint. If Dean truly wasn’t interested, Cas would back off.
“Hells yeah!” Charlie said excitedly. “Kevin can’t make it, but Cas and I will be there. Right, Cas?”
“Shh,” Cas says, kissing gently over the same spot. “Spread your legs for me, Dean.” Dean bites his lips and spreads his legs, embarrassed when his body starts to tremble. “Hey, hey...” Cas keeps kissing him gently all over his thighs. “We don’t have to do this if you’re not ready, Dean. I’d wait forever.”
Cas walked forward and shoved it in without pause. “Ouch. It was dry enough.” He pulled it out and slammed it in once more, his cock twitching at the man’s screams.
Cas was silent for a while, because Dean was right. He royally fucked up. Dean had never yelled at him like this, he planned to
He sent it.
“Shut up.” He rolled his eyes and looked away to hide his smile.
He knew Cas could be an ass sometimes, but he never in a million years imagined hitting him. Dean went to the room to plug in the phone and came back out, “Okay, I’m going to need the entire story, please tell me you got some punches in.”
Looking at Cas’ cock, he wasn’t entirely sure he was, but he was too far gone to care. His body would get on board quickly enough anyway and hell, he liked a little bit of pain mixed with his pleasure. “If you don’t get inside of me in the next 5 seconds, I’m flipping us over and taking it myself. That answer your question?”
part of this evening.”
“Fuck... say my name again, Cas.” He’s so into it he doesn’t even think before speaking, and truthfully, he wouldn’t be able to control his mouth if he tried.
In no place to argue, Dean let Cas have control in getting him fed, and before long they were back on the couch with a beer. “I didn’t ruin any New Year's Eve plans for tomorrow, right? You can leave me here if you were goin’ out with that one dude or somethin’.”
“Get in loser, we’re going shopping.” Cas joked as she approached his car.
When he got to school, Cas wondered how much of their conversation Dean would remember. Would he remember Cas asking what pan was? Would he remember asking Cas to feed him skittles? Would he remember he called at all? Cas feared the latter.
Dean called an uber to take him back to his car and did the
It makes Cas’ pupils blow and his cock thicken. He pushes his finger deeper, twisting it and pulling it back, twisting in, pulling back… “Take your shirt off and get in the car. You need to wait just a little longer, sweetheart.”
Cas threw one last punch and backed away, blood from the gash on his forehead dripped blood onto the floor and he grabbed his head to try to stop the bleeding, but it was too late. His DNA was in this bar. He cussed and turned to leave with Dean right behind him, he knew he was in trouble.
Cas just smiled. “You look good.” Flirting, as usual.
killer and next time I’ll fucking tie you up and ride you.”
, Cas came.
Cas looked into Dean’s green eyes and instantly knew his answer.
Whether he wants to admit it or not, giving over the control feels good. Really good, and Cas lets himself go pliant as Dean takes what he needs. When he spills down his throat, Cas can feel his legs shaking and his head slamming against the door. “Fuck, Castiel. That— fuck.”
All of that had Dean hard as a rock and he thrust up against Cas. “Yeah? Maybe I changed my mind then, I wouldn’t say no to being your first.” He thought maybe they should stick with what they knew for the first time, but he’d take Cas however he could get him.
“You never saw the way he looked at him, Charles. And I get it, I mean, it’s
“No complaints here. Feels kinda good to hear, actually.” Dean puts an arm around him and licks his lips. “Most people think I’m annoying, but... you’ll get used to my singing and shit.”

that was his best friend. His hair had blue streaks in it… which was weird; Cas definitely didn’t have those in the time they’d been friends. But maybe this was before they met?
For the first time, Cas realized that was what this was.
Cas grunted something Dean couldn’t understand as he came harder than he had in months - since his last time with Dean. Only
Cas was completely fucked out and he hadn’t even come yet. He bared his neck again, completely at Dean’s mercy.
He closed his eyes, and within a couple of short minutes, they were both asleep.
“Good. We’ll take a real shower in the morning.” Cas’ eyes were already closed and he mumbled something before dozing off completely. He didn’t even realize, he just tried to say
The sting from his cut, the assault on his hole and his oxygen being cut off, it was all just...
“We can. But I kinda want see all their faces when we tell them.” Dean grins, kissing Cas three more times and then down his face to his neck.
*******************************************************
It hadn’t taken him long to figure out how to steal electricity from the nearest business. As long as he didn’t use too much, it shouldn’t be noticed - just a shower here, a flush of a toilet there. He used the stove for heat and he was deep enough underground that an air conditioner likely wouldn’t be necessary. There was a ratty old mattress in the corner that he slept on, when he actually did sleep. Sometimes he’d be up for days at a time, the voices devouring him whole as he rocked back and forth with his knees to his chest. It wasn’t pretty, but anyone that was around to witness it died before they ever had a chance to tell the tale.
Dean was too curious to let that go, “no, ask me. What were you gonna ask?”
He does, and Benny cleans the ball as Dean takes his shot and makes it. “Oof. Roll back, thirsty boys.” His competitive side awakens as they get the balls back but when Lisa makes it again, Dean decides to go easy on Cas. He locks eyes with him and shoots, then looks down to see himself miss. “Well, fuck. Those eyes are just too pretty.”
The music could be heard a block away, but on the high class side of town, no one would complain. Cas wasn’t sure which football player’s house this was, but whoever it was, their parents were loaded. The walkway to the house alone was larger than his front yard and Cas thought
“No. No, not that at all. Nick, where does he normally go on nights out?” Dean switched to officer mode,
The bed moved again and then their bedroom door closed, and a second later, Carmen leaned over and pulled off the mask. “Hey, there.”
Their first kiss was much more heated than Cas ever imagined it could be. Dean was on his lap in seconds, and all of Cas' senses were overtaken. It felt so incredibly right that he didn’t understand how they had lived across the way for eight months and never once noticed the palpable sexual tension between them.
She motioned over to where Cas is standing with a girl Dean believes is Meg but isn’t completely sure and a few other guys. Cas was laughing at something, looking completely carefree and genuinely happy. Dean had to admit, “No, he doesn’t.” Running a hand down his face, Dean continues, “But that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t try. He may not realize he has a problem yet but he does, his own
Dean rolled his eyes but on the inside, he was glad Cas was getting back to his sassy self. The truth he didn’t want to admit was that he had been terrified until the moment Cas started shamelessly flirting again. He cared more for him than he could ever allow himself to show.
worth waking up to?

“Shit, dunno but you’re welcome to it anytime you want.” Dean rocked his hips up and groaned at the tight squeeze of Cas’ throat. “Fuck, bet you look damn good with my cock in your mouth, whoever the hell you are.”
“Fuck, not gonna take much. Carmen doesn’t... doesn’t do any of this shit.”
Cas didn’t respond, he just got out of the car and walked in, nodded at the waiter he’d fucked a few times and sat in a booth. He knew it wasn’t a date, he always sat there. “Bacon cheeseburger for me and a double for a... friend.” He didn’t even wait for Dean to come in and sit, he already knew what he wanted so he ordered it for him. “Wait, some water too.”
“Ah. Well, sure. We’ve probably got enough room for one more, if you’re looking’ for a place to crash.” Benny paused for a moment and then chuckled quietly, adding, “if you don’t mind stayin’ in a house full of horny dudes, that is.”
Dean shook his head. The asshole was high as a kite and
Powerful. I craved it, and pretty soon it didn’t matter who was under my knife. Blood is blood, Cas. Everybody bleeds it, and ain’t
"Funny." Dean deadpanned, walking over and forcing Cas down to his knees.
She wasn’t what Dean wanted. He wanted a guy.
Nodding, Cas strokes Dean as he hammers up into him. “Look at me, Dean.” The moment Dean’s eyes meet Cas’, Cas squeezes tighter. “You're mine. Do you understand? Mine.” He slams into him, hitting just the right spot, and Dean cries out in pleasure as he comes. The possessive look in Cas’ eyes shoves him over so quickly he can’t even warn him.
He contemplated a moment before answering, “like I’m worth a damn. Like all this work I’ve done to make my dad proud has paid off. I mean, I’m not stoppin’ here. I want to make him proud every damn day. But… it feels good, Cas. Like I’m lighter.”
“What did you give him?”
." He gazed back a long moment, "Consider it as you owe me one.
“Not at all, Cas. This is what I was hoping for. A-Are you?” Dean asks, the fear evident on his face as he averts his gaze.
person. And yet, Cas still felt violated. As he approached the door, he convinced himself he wasn’t normal and things were just better this way. Why would Dean want to be with someone like him? Especially when there are perfectly normal people as options. The man not only had the face and build of a damn demigod, he was also the most amazing man Cas had ever had the pleasure to talk to, let alone fuck. So why did he want Cas?
Not one single person turned to look at him. He pinched his own arm and lightly tapped his face, wondering if he was either dreaming or fucking invisible. Dean loudly closed the front door and walked in, circling around the back of the couch until he was in Benny’s view.
Carmen grinned. “We can blindfold you, I’ll be there to touch you and kiss you, it’s just... not my mouth. Dean, he gives the best blowjobs. Obviously I’ve never gotten one, but I know people that have and they all say the same thing.”
Cas nodded with Dean’s cock in his throat and slid back, quickly shoving him down again as he came. The taste had Cas releasing into his fist with a series of needy grunts as he swallowed Dean’s delicious come.
by 8am. I have a class to teach.” And with that, he closed the door, leaning back against it and wondering why the hell he was letting that hickish little shit get under his skin.
“No, no... I’ve been drooling over that ass for months, Dean. I want to be inside of you so bad, it hurts.”
Once they were back inside, he thought about how much in his life had changed just in the few short hours since he’d been there last. “Weird how shit just...
“Castiel. But you can call me Cas.”
“I…” Cas paused, not sure how to explain it. “I thought I was doing you a favor.”
Dean tilted his head, curious for the first time. “You ever fucked anybody, Cas?”
“Castiel!” Benny yelled, not caring who could hear anymore. “You need to chill the fuck out!”
“What were you thinking? Did you have to get

his jaw hit the floor.
“Yeah, I know.” She eyed him with a knowing look, but before he could ask about it, a teacher walked over to see who they were planning on walking with because the groups have to be four people or more. “Dean and Cole.” Charlie said without hesitation and then smiled as the teacher wrote it down, handing them four whistles and moving on.
He toyed with the waistband of his jeans, hoping the movement would trigger Dean’s memory of the original tequila story and distract him.
Cas shook his head, not trusting his voice. He
Dean caught Cas by the hair. “No. Sit up straight and open your mouth, I decide how much of me you get.”
For the first time, the last thing on Dean’s mind was getting off. He wanted to savor every second of being inside of Cas, so his thrusts were measured and patient. Dean fought against Cas’ insistent legs, forcing himself to keep his steady rhythm.
“Hey, we were alone when we started. Not our fault.” Dean gripped his ass and smiled like the lovestruck idiot he is. “I love you.”
He didn’t hear the room door close, instead he instantly felt the bed move, making him wonder if Cas was just as eager for this as he was.
Dean slid his hand down his chest and wrapped it around Cas’. “You liked havin’ me tied up, huh? Having control over a fucking killer?” His words were low and sultry, just a gentle reminder of all Dean was capable of with the hand now helping him jerk off.
Cas coughed a couple times before laughing, “You thought you were in control tonight, huh?” He tilted his head, a playful glint in his eyes and then he looked at the blood on his thumb and picked at it curiously.
“I don’t care. Get your perfect, tight, beautiful ass in that uniform. How are we going to win without the costume? You know Charlie wouldn’t let us.”
for a bad decision.
He shrugged and followed.
Dean clicked his tongue. If he lost, that would drain them of basically every penny they had... and he also knew Anthony was full of shit. They were only betting $5 each before he got over there, but his bravado told Dean that Anthony was confident he’d be able to win - and confidence often led to mistakes. He pretended to mull it over and then nodded. “Fuck it, it’s only twenty bucks, right? Not like it’s gonna break the bank.”
Cas noticed Dean was grinning when he closed his bedroom door and he honestly didn’t care about any present.
terms. "Do you trust me?"
hurt so much?
"Two years—"
A few hours later, they were getting out of Baby and heading into a bar in a new town. Dean was nervous, there was a restlessness in the air that only seemed to happen during a full moon, but they were down to their last $30 and were just about out of gas. They needed to hustle, they shouldn’t even have waited as long as they did.
ready. Hit the showers.” He waved them off - after poking Dean between the 1’s on his jersey -  and they were all fucking grateful to be free. One more bleacher run, and Dean would have absolutely puked his lunch all over the field.
me? Really Dean? Too bad Dean is too all-American for me to google you without a last name.”
“Dunno about popcorn, but I got candy.” Cas nearly jumped out of his seat at Dean’s voice and sure enough, when he looked over at him, his hands were full of candy. “Didn’t mean to scare you. Are you hiding in here?”
“Proud? By not being straight?”
Unfortunately for him, Dean never showed up at school. He made it to his last class of the day before he reached out himself.
“Fuck you, didn’t know we were calling the cops on each other now,
Cas complied and washed his hands before motioning for Dean to lead the way.
In all honesty, Cas couldn’t be sure. Either way, Alec should leave. “Nah, it’s not. I’ll see you soon, Alec.”
wasn’t you. So, I was punished and whipped. Then fucked dry with a dildo and when I bled, he tossed me aside.”
“Which part?”
Cas was almost disappointed, but only because he’s never really had that. Not that he wanted it, right? “Yeah, I have enough food. Follow my car.” He jumped in the car and led Dean to his studio.
Cas frowned. “You think so?” He looked back at the wall. It was by far the best thing he’d ever done. “You know, some of your

“Put your phone on speaker and lube up your cock, I’ll do the same and we’ll be able to hear it and match our strokes.” Dean could tell Cas was doing exactly that, and quickly followed.
the fire simmering barely contained under Castiel‘s skin and surfacing at the most surprising times.
“Fucking hell... good. Feels like...” Dean growls and has to rush his hand to grip the base of his cock to keep from coming. He mumbles a bunch of words, but none of them make sense, he’s so close his hand has to tighten again. “Fuck... Cas... I can’t... tell me I can come!”
Dean’s brain immediately short-circuited.
Dean gripped his cock and groaned from the sudden loss of Cas’ mouth, then stood up and followed him to the bedroom, pulling his shirt off along the way. He closed the door and glanced around for a moment to get his bearings. “That was rude, y’know that, right? How many times have you said
Dean sighed, “Cas are you drunk?” He put his flashlight away and walked over.

see him.
Dean gallic shrugged, pulling Cas in for a kiss. “We could, actually.”
letting his mouth fall open as he waited for that delicious thick leaking cock to touch his tongue.
“I work about fifteen minutes from here, but it only takes that long because of the traffic. I’m going to clean up, can you hold on?”
Dean — compassionate and selfless almost to a fault, with a streak of self-loathing almost as deep as his ingrained desire to please those he cares for.
He opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue, and he doesn’t wait long for what he’s after. “Dean,” Cas grunts, spurting hot, delicious come exactly where he wanted it. Cas’ movements get erratic as he empties fully but keeps moving, gasping as his thighs start to shake.
He rolled his eyes. “Yes, but I still consider giving you shit to be my top priority. You’re mopey and it’s annoying.”
It's enough to distract him for a moment, but his hand finds its way to Dean’s and he toys with the ring he’d just slid on it last night. “Hm. You drive a hard bargain. We can go for a little and then come home after the games? I want to sleep in our bed tonight, and I don't particularly want them to hear all the things I have in store for you.”
Jo smiled fondly, “Enjoy your sword fighting.”
Cas cut the words off with a passionate kiss, and Dean immediately opened for him. He would have been content to fuck Cas - or hell, they’d started switching a while ago, he’d let Cas fuck
“No, it wasn’t. Honestly, it was some of your best work.” Nick leaned against the table and crossed his arms. “I’ve been telling you to use more colors for years, I’m glad to see you’re finally doing it.”
Dean let go of Cas’ throat and dug his nails into his hip as he grunted and came hard, filling up his angel in the middle of the church that was once going to be his murder scene. When he was empty, he pulled Cas’ hand from his throat and gasped for air, his vision spotting. “For fuck’s sake…”
of those things. He stood up, pulling on his boxers and jeans but leaving his shirt off. He stashed the bag in the basement of the church and doubled back to meet Cas outside. They stayed out of sight as they made their way back to the hotel parking lot and Dean drove them back to Cas’.
He could have spent the rest of his life there kissing Dean. It felt so right. But unfortunately, he wasn’t the only one with Dean’s attention, and someone knocked on the door.
“Shit... no deal-breakin’ now, Bumblebee. You signed the contract with a kiss.” Dean kisses him again and then pulls back a little nervous. “I actually do talk in my sleep…”
“Would be a boring party then, wouldn’t it?” Cas asks breathlessly. “No, I want you to fuck me and send me back out there to play games filled with your come.”
He opened his messages and dialed his phone number, changing just the last digit to a four.
Cas considered that for a moment. “Wizard. Being a Jedi comes with too much responsibility.”
A soft, promising smile spreads across Cas’ face as he slowly slides off of him and reaches out to help him off the bed. “Then let’s not waste a second of it.”
Are you guys ready for the end? Only one more chapter 😭
The command had Dean’s dick pulsing and leaking as he bit down on Cas’ neck, then sucked a bruise he knew would leave a mark. He let out a whimper and joined his hand with a Cas’, stroking them both and making sure Cas didn’t stop this time. “Gonna come all over my dick, baby?”
It’s tempting, and he almost does it, but he’d rather have more room than this so he shakes his head. “Nah… let’s go get Baby.”
at this point and slipped back outside to pick at his sandwich and stare at the wall. He forced himself to eat half, it was delicious but he didn’t really have an appetite. Cas took the time to stare at the wall again, he really
Cas grinned, “Not too bad. You just typed it as if you were moaning my name, which makes perfect sense seeing as how that
“Why are
“Um…” he looked down at Dean’s R2D2 pants and huffed a laugh, “right back at you.”
“I’m not going anywhere without you! Wash your hands and let’s just fucking go.” Cas meant it, if Dean didn’t move, he wouldn’t either. “Either we go or we stay. But it’s
“Shit! Cas...” Dean scratches down his back and lifts his knees higher. One of Cas’ hands slides down his thigh and lifts it up, and the shift drives him a little deeper. It’s almost agonizingly slow, the way he takes him. Cas kisses him gently and trails his lips across Dean’s jaw.
. Fancy meeting you here.”
Dean smiled, running his hand through Cas’ hair as he slid into his open, eager mouth. He groaned when Cas’ hot, wet tongue flicked over the sensitive skin of his cockhead and pushed in deeper.
Cas was
“A small amount? What are we using as measurements, Dean? Actual liquid? Or are we going full American and using random items to explain something more complicated than necessary?” Cas was full on grinning now.
Dean gladly accepted the invitation and closed his teeth around the sensitive, delicious skin of Cas’ neck. He bit and sucked with every intention of marking Cas as
Cas nodded, “Of course, and how I’m not entitled to think anyone’s personal feelings are unwarranted.”
As soon as
“Stickler for the rules huh?” Cas continued to stare. “Your beauty is very distracting for me, I can hardly focus on my work.”
“Yes, very much.”
Dean took a shaky breath and did as told. “Come on, Cas. I’m leaking over here.”
ass. Never felt somethin’ so good.”
“Charlie, towel. Now. These tights aren’t made for boners.”
Cole groaned and covered his head with a pillow and unfortunately, Cas couldn’t see Dean with Charlie in the way, but he heard him hum and mumble, “bacon” in a voice so thick with sleep that Cas felt bad for waking him.
He nodded his head down to Cas’ hard cock. “You said you were gonna take care of that.”
felt like this was Cas’ hand.
Dean scrambles over and straddles Cas with a grin, trying to sink down on his cock but Cas holds him steady and clicks his tongue. "Not yet." He guides him down to sit normally, then wraps his hand around both their lengths and rolls his hips, sighing happily as they slide together. "If I only get you once, I want a taste of everything."
She squeals and throws her arms around both of their necks, pulling them in. “So… are you guys playing tonight? One more time before you get hitched?”
His parents shared a look but continued smiling. “Well, good to see you again, Dean. I hope you like steak.” Rob gestured to the table.
He ordered them pizza to pay Cas back for all the help and they got a lot done. Cas actually had no intentions on returning, he helped, that was enough to feel good about himself for awhile but unfortunately, he forgot to check in with Dean after he initially arrived.
had been different. He lost himself in that daydream until he felt his angel stir.
“Yeah, you’re telling me. I’ve honestly always wanted to do that, I just never did. But I was thinking about it more and more; I would have ended up doing it and then fucking it up and going to prison. I won’t go to prison, I’d rather die.” Cas stripped down and pulled out a black bag for their clothes. “Come shower with me.”
He could. Something deep down told him that he could. But why was it so damn hard?
this morning. He really thought
weeks this time? There are too many things he wanted to do, too many ways he wanted to mark
Cas’ ridiculously blue eyes locked on his mouth and he had the nerve to lick his lips.
Cas looked over at Dean and touched his beautiful face. “My handsome Devil.” He whispered.
“How did you get my password?” He asked curiously.
The mention of Dean’s initials being carved in his chest pushed him over and after, all he felt was shame. “Oh fuck! I’m sorry... I’m sorry.” He whispered, completely breathless.
Dean averted his eyes and shook his hands to get the water off as he searched for a paper towel. “Not in the ass.”
Dean swore loudly, his hand tightening around Cas’ cock. “Now, Cas. Come for me
He muttered to himself, “How the hell am I gonna get you home?”
The game ends up being more fun than either of them expected, and Dean’s almost tempted to stay for another one, but he can tell everyone’s getting restless so they say their goodbyes. Once they’re back in the warm car, Dean kisses Cas’ hand.
Dean thrust in deep once with a moan, pulling out slowly inch by inch until just the head of his cock was trapped inside that tight ring. “C’mon, Cas. Fuck yourself on my cock.”
“Thank you, Dean.” It felt so fucking pathetic to say, but he was still struggling with words. “Can you move them out of my sight please? Don’t tell me what you do with them, I’ll go shower.” Dean nodded and he turned to make his way to the bathroom. Cas could already feel the withdrawals and hoped a cold shower would help.
David eyed
feelings for the guy and the way Dean beamed every time he spoke to Cas told her it was already, too late.
Cas was still smiling, he knew deep down Dean would never leave him.
Luckily for all of them, Charlie sees the desperation and giggles at them. “Just go, you two. You won’t be able to function, anyway.”
Also, if you haven’t heard it, the song is Angeles by Steve Carlson and Jensen Ackles.
When they finally got back to Dean’s, Castiel was completely flustered. “Jesus Dean, I can’t fucking breath with you up my ass! Can we get some damn lube at least?!”
a man of action. Not being able to meet Dean’s eyes had nothing to do with Dean, and all to do with Castiel’s shame.
.” They both laughed at that, Charlie was basically how Dean was in high school. A hoe.
“I’m not telling you, you’ll want discounts and shit.” Nick teased. Cas shrugged and pulled out his burger to take a bite.
“Oh, I haven’t noticed.” Cas shrugged and looked down at his phone.
“I know how to get us some money fast. But you won’t like it.”
Cas walked to the door and knocked, fidgeting nervously for what Dean was really about to do. But he also felt so fucking
With a playful, narrowed gaze, Dean corners him against the wall and runs his hands down Cas’ sides to his hips. “Deal. But you need to kiss me at least 31 more times tonight. Y’know, since it’s Halloween and all.”
He nods quickly as he pulls his own length out. “Yes. I... I think I liked your voice better than the porn.”
me to do to you?
Cas poked the blade right between David’s asscheeks but didn’t push in. “Say you’re sorrrry...” He said in a sing song voice.
I have questions. Who the fuck is this Garth Brooks on meth with an eyebrow ring hanging on by a pubic hair, Joe Exotic? And he got TWO straight guys to marry him just with tigers and
Cas rolled his eyes. “Pussy.” He turned to Sam. “Look, I was never holding a can of blue paint so I'm 100% positive
Cas groaned and began to slowly slide up and down, staring into Dean’s eyes. “You feel so good.” He sat back and picked up speed, his throbbing cock bouncing on Dean’s stomach.
businesses interested in
Dean had received a text not long after Cas left with an address. He knew he’d be gone a while because he was a helpful little shit, but when dinner time rolled around and he hadn’t heard from Cas again, he got worried. He tried calling twice but it went straight to voicemail both times. The hair on the back of Dean’s neck stood on end and he had a
“Cas wants to know if he should come over Sunday again.” Carmen popped a chip in her mouth and leaned against the arm of the chair, watching him with unsuspecting eyes.
He’s happy to see Dean squirm and pull a throw pillow onto his lap. “I like gangbangs and frottage, too. That... really feel as good as it looks?”
Dean eyed the container, leery about taking pity from Cas. But beggars couldn't be choosers, and the truth was... Dean
Dean smiled a little despite himself.
Dean made mental notes of everything he saw but quickly moved to the kitchen. His hours long search for Cas had left him starving, and he needed strength when it came to
Dean stepped into the bar and immediately, his eyes landed on Castiel. Something wound up in his chest loosened.
was his present.
“Bend over the hood. Pull your jeans down, nothing else.”
Dean clenched his jaw and looked for another way out but there was none, and if they turned around it would be even more suspicious. He squeezed Cas’ hand and looked at him. “You listen to me. If we get busted here, you tell them I fucking kidnapped you. Run with the story they ran in the paper. I kidnapped you and it was all me, you got that? This isn’t a fucking request, Cas.”
“I think…” Cas paused to lick his lips. “I think I knew.” He reached for Dean’s face. ”Why couldn’t you?”
“You okay, angel?” Dean’s voice was wrecked with lust but at least he asked. “Remember your safeword?”
“You can’t make those noises, Cas.” He felt his cheeks heat up,
The implication wasn’t lost on Dean as he twisted his finger to drive it deeper. “Yeah? You wanted this yesterday, huh? Shoulda said so, I’d have fucked you the minute you walked in the door.”
Cas glanced over at Dean and had to palm himself to keep from coming at the sight. “Fuck, you’re so fucking hot.” Cas continued to brutally shove the toy into the man with his eyes on Dean.
“Well first of all, your chin can cut down a tree and second, you’re fucking
Cas crawled over and pulled at Dean’s pants, fumbling with his zipper.

What did that even mean? Was he just embarrassed about it, or inexperienced, and wouldn’t want the audience? Was it just him being possessive in that specific situation, meaning he’d want privacy with
two together is so bad for your heart.” Charlie can see how worried Dean is and tried to change the subject, “Okay, we’ll talk about this another time. We’re here for you to forget about Cas for the night. There’s this guy, his back is facing us now but from your description he might be close enough to be a substitute
share well.
The problem was, Dean didn’t do so hot when he felt cornered. “How about sex in general? All you ever seem to want is me to lick your pussy, which - far be it from me to complain, but sometimes... yeah, I wanna have actual sex with my girlfriend.”
He didn’t leave the house for nearly a week. It made him realize he hadn’t went a week without fucking someone in years, his ass deserved the break. But alas, he needed to eat. So, he got dressed, and made his way back out in the world.
Cas grunted when his face slammed against the wall so hard it definitely cut him, but he smiled, pushing back against Dean’s iron grip. “Didn’t see anyone stopping me.” He pushed further. “How about you let go and stop pretending you’re about to do something here in this bathroom.”
“You’re very welcome! Hi, Dean.” Cas turned around and flushed even darker as Dean walked up.
“Yup. I’m dragging Cas to both
He can feel Dean is close when his hips begin to stutter. He moans Cas’ name over and over like a prayer and then slams inside, filling him up with the sexiest grunt Cas has ever heard.

is important, because fucking was definitely in the plans.
“Is this my punishment for stealing your favorite shirt again?” Ares asks, shrugging off the shirt and throwing it at Jask with an amused grin.
Cas had no idea how intense this would be, it was as if they were both drugged on the sight of blood.
Trying to drag a body out of an apartment building unseen would be a nightmare. “Slight change of plans. You said you’re named after an angel, yeah? You ever been bent over an alter?”
Danny laughed obnoxiously. “Well, you’re not Michael Scott, so I definitely don’t answer to you. He’ll sleep it off.”
“Dean, just let me do it.” Cas exclaimed after he over-poured once again. “The measurements are exact. We can’t have more than 15ml of vinegar.”
so after a bathroom stop, he grabs his shield and jumps into Baby.
Dean grunted, but at least it was something. “None of my damn business what the two of you plan.”
His eyes dart around the room before they land on his hands in his lap and start picking on a nonexistent hangnail. “Yeah... I don’t remember what I said exactly, but —” Dean meets his eyes again as a blush spreads across his freckle-kissed nose. “I like dude porn. So if I said that... I meant it.”
When they do, they all look like they expect him to say something profound before their toast but really, he only has one thing to cheers to tonight. “To Cas having the best ass I ever fucked, and to him agreeing that this isn’t a one-time thing.”
Dean crossed the distance in an instant, shoving Cas roughly against the thick beam and pressing against him with a growl. He normally preferred when his victims

It wasn’t quite the response Cas had been hoping for, but at least Dean wasn’t judging him. He nodded dumbly, changing his mind about that tequila. “Thank you. I’m going... to go get my drink.”
“I’ll be right back, just gotta find someone sober enough to drive. Because I’m like three Skittles too drunk to drive.” He winked and wandered off.
The idea of Cas getting high with some chick made Dean slightly nauseous. He realized he doesn’t even know exactly how gay Cas even is, maybe he’s bi too?
Charlie was really excited about this party. Yeah, Dean didn’t go to college with her, but he was still her best friend. Not to mention, he needed to get laid. In high school, he was a huge flirt and always had a girl to fuck. Dean didn’t do relationships and Charlie always told him it would get old one day, but she didn’t realize it would get old for him by twenty. Her once life-of-the-party best friend was
“You will. Once we finish the last two Avengers, it’s time for Hogwarts.”

But he left the last part unspoken. As much as he wanted Dean, wanted
The man’s scream echoed through the steel mill and Dean stuck his finger in his ear, wiggling it and making a face. “Fuck, that was irritating.”
louder.  “Y’know, I think we waited too long. His ass is so covered in blood from his ankles that nothin’ about this is gonna be dry.” He ran his palm over his bulge and nodded to Cas. “Go ahead.”
Dean can tell Cas felt defensive and decided to tread lightly, “No, Cas. Not uncomfortable, just worried about you.”
“Kinda. You zoned out on me, are you okay?” She plopped her phone on the counter and touched his face.
Cas was fucking leaking with every bite and when Dean broke the skin, Cas sighed as if it was the best feeling in the world. “Fuck,” he whispered. “There’s no one like you.”
Dean slowly licked his lip and drummed his fingers on the table. “Sounds more like a saint than a sinner, Cas. Thought we were going after the dregs of humanity these days? What is it about
Cas glanced over. He actually hadn’t slept well since they’d left that warehouse. They weren’t careful that day. Cas was sure they would be caught at any time, and it would be
After another bratty smirk, he opened and instantly leaned forward to lap at Cas’ leaking tip. It took about thirty seconds for Cas to realize what a

submit? You feel as if you lose a part of yourself. I didn’t want you to see me that way.”
On their second date, Dean took it a little further. Not only kissing him, but lifting him up against the wall, rutting against him so Cas could feel his huge hard member against his own. And then again, nothing.
end up regretting.” He smiled just enough to show Cas he understood why this was happening and that he supported him in the only way he knew how... silently, and with an attitude.
Dean held his hand until they reached the door, but let go before he opened it. “I told them a friend was here for dinner because I knew no matter what, you would be open to food.”
he goes out with her. She never takes no as an answer but it just so happens Dean is up for it this week, anything to forget Cas, even if just for the night.
Cas licked his lips and then smiled, “Do you really want Nick? Because I have to tell you, he’s straight.”
The man opened the door and grinned. ”Back for more, pretty boy?” The man instantly grabbed Cas and pulled him inside, closing the door behind him. He slammed Castiel against the door, locked it and started kissing on his neck, making Cas feel disgusting. “Back up! I gotta piss first,” he lied, unlocking the door the second the man turned away.
Cas rolled his eyes and bit back a smile. “Our first date?” He laughed. They definitely did this backwards. He had Dean’s initials carved into his body and they were about to have a first date. Which reminded him, “Dean, what’s the
—————
Cas chuckled and pulled off. “Want to sit at the edge for a better view?”
Jask trips as Dean drives him back a little too far and knocks over one of the dining room chairs trying to catch himself, and by that point, they're laughing too hard to do much of anything — but when the theme song starts over, Jask lets out a battle cry and charges again.
He hisses, his leg tensing as he visibly fights the urge to take what he wants, and Cas almost wishes he would. “Fuck, you look so damn good down there, Cas.”
“Oh... have you seen my dick yet?” he asks curiously. “I’ve seen yours a few times. Tequila makes you strip... in case you don’t remember.”
Dean finally pulled into the motel and Cas was waiting outside. Cas tossed the bags in the car and slid in, and Dean had taken off again before he’d even had the door completely shut.
Cas slumped onto the ground when Dean fucked his way through his own orgasm and there was a ringing in his ears as Dean came back into focus and he laughed. Actually,
Dean played rock music from a bluetooth speaker that seemed to perk everyone up, he hummed to the music while putting garbage in bags and syringes in a bio waste box.
There was no way they were going to make full days at school without touching each other inappropriately, but then again, Cas didn’t plan on trying.
“So good— close.” Dean’s too far gone to be embarrassed by how fast he’s teetering the edge, but from Cas’ moans he’s right there with him.
“At least.” Cas kisses him again, rougher this time, but Charlie knocks louder to remind them they need to get out.
Cas frowned, “Who are you watching?” He asked in a knowing tone. He could tell Dean was distracted and there was only one thing that would distract him from Cas: a
but he felt he should go easy on Dean.
Dean smiles and takes another drink. He can’t seem to keep his hands off Cas so he starts playing with his hair. “What if you have a test the next morning and I won’t stop singing Crazy Train in my sleep?”
He cuddled as close as possible to Cas without making physical contact and spoke as clearly as he dared. “I still want this, Castiel.”
type, let alone a
Yes, we know... sorry. But this was necessary.
When Cas returned from his own apartment with lube and a condom, Dean was on his knees, but he wasn’t naked. He was wearing some pink satin panties, and everything about him looked delicious.
“You like the real deal, huh? My imagination is alright, but it still doesn’t compare to this. I get what you mean now... about the come. It’s fucking hot.”
“Hello, Cas.” Charlie’s aunt smiled warmly. “Hope you’re hungry.”
“Right back at you, handsome devil.” Castiel rutted against Dean and bit his neck, craving more.
“Yeah... you’re right. I felt pretty guilty after.” Cas looked down and then remembered he had a fucking plug inside his ass. “Make yourself comfortable, I’ll be right back.” He disappeared into his room to take it out and wipe up.
Cas pulled off, stroking him painfully slow. “Yes, Dean. You may come.” He swallowed him down again and started that magical pace that had Dean right at the edge in seconds.
Charlie pulled on his arm just as John Winchester walked in the door. “Alright kids, break it up! Go home before I call your parents. Michael Daniels!” He barked out in his booming voice. “Where’s my son?”
“Uh... Yeah. Definitely.” Dean chuckled and moved side. “Tequila just makes you wanna be naked, huh?” Cas took his turn and did slightly better, but not by much; and on Dean’s next turn, he sunk the ball.
He made a fake moaning sound.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had no clue what to expect from Dean and after about ten minutes, he realized he shouldn’t have expected anything. Dean was drunk, he probably completely forgot they even spoke. With the bitchiest eye roll Cas could muster, he left the kitchen and explored the ridiculously giant house. Charlie was in the middle of a beer pong match against two football players, but Cas didn’t care to watch. He offered her a “kick their ass” and then made his way towards the hallway.
Dean licks his swollen lips happily and then gets up, walking to the bed and dropping on his hands and knees. “Don’t make me wait, Cas. Fuck, I need it... need
Cordelia smiles softly while tracing her finger lightly over her pen. “Those are lovely things to say about each other. It’s already clear that whatever has brought you into my office, it’s not a lack of attraction.” She leans forward slightly and makes eye contact with each in turn. “Could you share what
“So… what? This changes nothing.” Cas leans forward to brace on the side of the tub and winks at Charlie, but he’s not sure she notices him thanks to the eyepatch. “Director Fury!” he calls, and Charlie turns quickly.
Dean shuddered with his hands braced on either side of the infuriating, dangerous man at the first mention of
Dean switched channels with a scowl. “We’re not even anywhere near there. And what am I gonna do, go out and crucify someone wearing hot dog pajama pants?” He took a frustrated bite of his sandwich and kept changing stations.
But no, he really,
Castiel hardly slept. He stayed on the phone, listening to Dean’s mumbles for far too long before he realized he should have hung up an hour prior. He couldn’t help but feel slightly worried - since Dean was ridiculously intoxicated - but hearing that he was asleep was at least promising. “Well you look like a steamy bag of doodoo, baby bro.” Cas’ brother stood in his doorway.
for it?” He ran a hand through Dean’s hair lovingly. “You’d tear my ass up so bad I would walk funny.”
my good boy.” Dean released Cas and slid off the bed, his cock bouncing with every movement. He bent over and rummaged around in the zipper compartment of his bag until he found a razor and quickly dismantled it, pulling out a single blade. He stood up, admiring the flash of light off the cold metal.
Instead of “moping” around, Cas got up and decided to go get some more art supplies - since Nick is paying. He still loved walking and talking to random old people, that never changed. Cas has always liked old people. People his age just didn’t get his company. It was probably his favorite thing about Dean. There was no rush, no push to be fun or exciting.
didn’t, you really
Dean started dancing, not caring who was laughing at him and it was actually pretty endearing.
Dean’s leg twitched when Cas licked him and for the first time in his life, he wondered what it would be like to have a true partner. Nothing scared Castiel, nothing turned him off. If he could ever take someone, mold them into his image... it was Cas. It was his angel. Whoever interrupted them left, and Dean pulled Cas to his feet and kissed him hard. Not in the possessive way he usually did, but in a way that would convey without words that what just happened fucking
Dean grinned and quickly texted back.
Cas’ smile was infectious and Dean couldn’t stop himself from returning it. He turned his gaze back on the open road in front of them and had to laugh. “Who knows, maybe the cops will give us a break for doing the world a favor.”
“Fucking yes! God, I missed this cock!” He bottomed out and rolled his hips.
“Good thing I’m not wearin’ one then, huh?” Dean grinned cheekily, nudging Cas.
Anyone else just 🥵 over this Dom!Dean?
“Nothin’ just… proud of you. You’re so strong, Cas.”
“Dean. I am a very specific dom. I will not scene with you until you trust me. Fully and completely. I also want to trust you. We need to go over hard no’s before we ever decide to take that course.” Cas explained, happy to see Dean wasn’t instantly shutting down at the rejection.
getting sucked off by Benny and Cole, although Gadreel and Balthazar had joined in too. He wasn’t paying close enough attention to figure out whose mouths were where, but the sudden attention to Dean irritated him.
This morning though, he worries about Cas. It seemed unlike him that he wouldn’t say goodbye since he
If Cas wasn’t completely fucked out, he would have gotten hard at the sight above him, It was fucking
“Okay... Whatever it is, I’m here for you, Cas.” Dean reached out a nervous hand, sliding his fingers between Cas’. “Talk to me.”
Cas makes a soft sound and grabs Dean’s face by the chin, pulling him into a kiss. He doesn't care that they just met or that they're supposed to be doing something specific here — this man deserves to be kissed, to be held and praised and not to ever feel the way he seems to be feeling. After a moment, Cas seems to realize that all the air has been sucked out of the room, and pulls back from the kiss with a blush. "Um... sorry."
“They weren’t worthy of

Dean hesitated but nodded, not seeing a reason not to. “Absolutely, but there better be pie afterward.” He winked at Cas and left the bathroom, walking with a little bit of a swagger in his step because he hadn’t felt that good in a long ass time.
Three months of therapy worked wonders. Dean pulling him in for a spontaneous kiss never made him tense anymore and actually began to enjoy them immensely.
He considered putting it back without opening just so

“Just…” He cleared his throat. “Sounded hot.”
zoned out in his painting, it was as if no one below that ladder existed. Dean had never seen that level of concentration on Cas, in fact, the
Cas had moved closer so he could hear the conversations and with each passing moment he became angrier. He was no longer talking or even trying to pickpocket anymore, something was stirring inside of him and he wanted to see Rose at the end of his blade.
“Yeah? Next time I want you to do something about it.” Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s throat. “Don’t let anyone touch
The fact that Cas gets this for the rest of his life has him floating, enjoying every second and kissing him greedily as he rocks up to take him deeper, his own length heavy and sated.
Cas tossed his head back and came with a groan, squeezing Dean’s neck tighter as he painted his chest white. “Fuck…” He whispered before leaning forward to lick Dean clean.
Cas nodded, muting the TV and not bothering to hide his grin. “Oh? What’s happening right now then? Don’t look.”
I had hoped they would.” He looked over at Dean. “Can I answer this one baby?” Cas asked with an excited glint in his eyes.

“Light of your life? I’m your downfall. You should have killed me!” Cas gripped Dean’s shirt tightly. “I won’t go to prison, Dean. I’m not cut out for prison, I’d rather die.”

Dean made his way over and put multiple pieces on two paper plates, bringing Cole some so he didn’t have to attempt to walk. “Actually, Dad, we’re gonna hang at Benny’s tonight, but we’ll be home by midnight.”
Judging by the shiver that races down Cas’ spine, he feels it too, but getting both costumes off is a bitch. “Is it sad the sex will probably take less time than that did?” Cas asks as he kicks off the last piece of clothing. “They should’ve put a fly in those tights.”
He smiled, repeating something he’d said long ago. “Your light is mine to put out, and... mine is now yours.”

rape again with one slice.
Dean let out a quiet noise way closer to a whine than anything else, gaining confidence as he barreled into Cas until the sound of his hips smacking against that beautiful ass was echoing around that dingy bathroom.
Dean threw his head back and laughed. “Even better. I’ll take her.” He received an awkward nod in response and a few minutes later, Dean was holding a plastic ball with an animal inside of it and staring at his passenger seat.
“I missed you too. Facetime isn’t cutting it, angel.” Dean kissed him again and cupped his chin, “Those eyes still take my breath away.”
Dean, his lips were much too large. He ran his thumb across them anyway, letting fake Dean know what he wanted. “You have a car?” Cas asked, straight up.
He watched his angel retreat to the bathroom and smiled to himself, following and leaving a trail of clothing in his wake before joining Cas in the shower. “I’m here. Speak.”
There are times he stares at Dean and he still can’t believe he is his. Their world is billions of years old and has billions of people, yet he was lucky enough to be born during the time Dean Winchester was alive. Even more than that, Dean chose him. Of all the people in all the years, he chose Castiel to spend his life with. The word ‘luck’ doesn’t seem to do it justice — no word could. The life they’ve lived has been a good one. Yes, over the years they have had their share of pain, it wasn’t perfect — even if his brain has already begun to convince him that it was. He doesn’t argue with his brain anymore; he knows the good things are what he needs to hang onto, they are what keep him going. Especially when Dean can’t be right there to hold his hand.
Cas didn’t respond right away, but Dean wasn’t surprised when he just walked outside and climbed in the car.
Cas almost laughs, but studies Dean as he contemplates his own response. “I really enjoy how he walks around shirtless all the time. And… how surprisingly thoughtful he is.”
Dean’s hands snaked around Cas’ waist and his eyes drifted to the photo. “Do you know how many people died because of that picture? How many times I tried to recreate that without you, and how many times I failed?”
“Most people just instinctively know to stay away from me. And the ones that don’t end up learning the hard way that they should’ve. I don’t think you gotta worry about it, especially because I’m probably just gonna sleep.” He rolled a little to get comfortable. “It’s been awhile since it’s been quiet up here. You need the car?”
Ain't it funny how the night moves?
Cas’ eyes fluttered closed at the sting. “I’ll be good, I’ll be good.” But he wanted more, that sting of the knife sliding down his thigh had his cock swelling.
Cas nodded, his heart beating loudly in his chest. “Yup. He’s more than willing to meet up.
They lived in the house they grew up in, even though it was still in their late father's name. All their bills were paid but they knew their living situation was temporary.
Dean met his eyes, trying to understand why he was proud.
“You got it.” Dean leaves his cock out and drives to a nearby field, parking in some grass. “Remember the first time we came out here? After that bullshit with Ramiel?”
If he waited any longer, Dean was going to come without even fucking his angel. His fingers left Cas empty for only a moment until he slicked his cock with warm blood and slid into him, snapping his hips. “Come for me, Castiel.

“Just for that,

time.” Dean chuckled. “Alright, I’ll go over.”
Cas’ stomach flipped as Dean helped him to his feet before they cleaned up and got dressed. Now that the first time was out of the way, Cas wasn’t sure how they were ever going to stop - not that he particularly had any interest in that.
Cas wasn’t in the mood for banter.
“Of course I do, Cas, but it makes way more sense for me than it does for you. I’ve killed every good thing in your life, and now... thanks to me losing my shit over a kiss you didn’t even reciprocate, we’re gonna end up dead or in jail.” Dean shifted slightly to angle his body more toward Cas, pulling him even closer.
“Call him. Now. Find out where he is. Say whatever the fuck you need to say.” His jaw was set and the path before them was clear in his mind. He knew he should be more careful than this, but the thought of having an extra body - someone Dean could actually kill - was a strong enough motivator that he didn’t care how risky it was. It had been
Cas doesn't know if it's too soon or not — or if it'll matter at all in the long run. But for now, all he knows is that this is new and wonderful, and he wants to enjoy it every second of every day. “Dean, we started
When they finally had the future talk and Dean told Cas to pick their college, he was completely in shock. It was like he didn’t believe Dean would actually follow him. “Where else am I gonna go, baby?”
“Eww. No wanking it in my bathroom. Aunt Dot made breakfast and I’m starving.” She stood up and giggled at the bulge. “Was it someone we know or someone famous? Wait! Clowns or midgets?”
“For me to contact him? Should we get two so you and I can communicate?” Cas asked as he slid on some more briefs. “And we need to do laundry so I can get back in my panties for you.”
After what felt like a while, Cas sighed. “That was decidedly the best orgasm I’ve had years, and I'm counting two
