If Sherlock had looked up at that exact moment, he would have seen the soft, affectionate gaze that John had briefly turned upon him. He was much too occupied for that right now though.
John ran his hand through Sherlock's curls and curved his hand down to lift his chin to meet his eyes.
John's eyes crossed for a moment as he panted and desperately drew Sherlock's attention to what he now had in his hand.
“Tell him it's the heaviest I have,“ she smiled merrily and patted his hand as she guided him back up on his way.
Sherlock actually cleaned away the dinner dishes and leftovers and then claimed the remaining tiramisu as his reward. He took the container and his spoon to the sofa to ruminate on the disconnected bits of information that he had gathered thus far. He rolled the creamy concoction around his mouth thoughtfully and softly smiled at his fondness for these sorts of desserts.
As it turns out, once Sherlock had given up on texting John, he resorted to talking to him as if he were in the room for about an hour before he got home. He was quite vexed that John had not brought the container of 40 volume hairdresser’s bleach, level 8 hair colour, boar's hair brushes, and saccharine packets he had texted AND so politely asked the doctor for (according to Sherlock).
John had never felt like a bigger jerk. He saw the hurt and the anguish permeating throughout Sherlock's entire body and rushed in for triage.
“'Morning, Sarah,” he carefully returned. Their relationship had been a tad strained after the events of their ill-fated date a while back. Almost getting a girl run through with a Chinese death escape device wasn't exactly the way to encourage future romantic endeavours. Well, at least not for
“We go in, love,” John answered simply. He took out his key, unlocked the door and held it open.  Sherlock followed a bit hesitantly.
When he returned, the sitting room seemed a bit less stifling. A fire danced merrily in the fireplace and shadows flitted coyly across the Victorian wallpaper. On the negative side, it now contained a very confusing, lanky detective. Just sitting there. Or rather lying there on the couch, arms folded across his chest, hands together as if in prayer under his chin, a piece of folded paper held between them. John was paralyzed with a sudden realization. Sherlock had used his computer last night AND this morning, as the evidence of the tabs suggested. Had he SEEN the letter?
John was uncomfortable all day. His pants felt particularly tight after what seemed to be a meger lunch and he kept having to tug at the collars on his sleeves to keep them from riding up.
John watched as a long limb pulsed, a keen nose lifted and twitched as if to scent the the air. A quick flick of a clever tongue wetted that perfectly shaped mouth…
John dressed without even taking a shower or brushing his teeth. He flung himself down both sets of stairs, forced out a cursory goodbye and got all the way to the clinic before he realized he hadn't even gotten breakfast.
Hold on. Go back. How did Sherlock know John was thinking about bodies pressing others against walls..?
God. Even THAT was a siren call to him now. John squirmed uncomfortably in his seat.  If he was perfectly honest with himself, it always had been. It lured him in, pulling him alongside the perpetually moving whirlwind known as Sherlock Holmes into impossible situations of his own volition. John pinched the bridge of his nose dejectedly and shook his head. This was going to be hopeless. He wouldn't be able to stand it, now that he knew- being so close, and yet so far from Sherlock. He was going to have to move out to distance himself from all this. Just the idea of that made him actually feel nauseated.
“I am SO, so sorry Sherlock,” he began, releasing one of his hands gripping Sherlock's shoulders frantically to rub his eyes in angry frustration. “You caught me so off balance, I couldn't even think.”
John was torn from his miserable reverie when out of nowhere, Sherlock's body startled, then flinched, and his eyes flew open.
“Great!” Hamish danced away, his arms full of charts. “I'll probably beat you there. I’ll save you a seat at the bar.” Another wink was thrown at John as he bounced down the hall.
John stopped himself, realising that he had gone a bit shrill. He felt his face pale and he unfolded his arms nervously and looked down at them in his lap.
John would surely give the case a ridiculously sensational name in his blog. He shuddered at the depths that his flatmate might go to with this one.
John was unprepared for the ramifications of that shift in motion and tipped his head back in startled sensation. They both groaned mightily as two enshrouded erections met briefly and slid across the other, scalding hot in intensity.
John flailed for some sort of control of this situation. This was his dream, dammit, he should be some sort of guiding force.
He pressed their mouths together again ruthlessly and with his long bodied weight behind it. John thrust his hands into Sherlock's curls, closed his fingers around a fistful and tugged at them reflexively.
“ I pilfered the letterhead paper and a pen from his desk for her, and she tucked it in the bag when she was done, “ Vida beamed. "She loves Dr. Watson's accounts of your work. It is quite apparent that he cares about you a great deal. It comes across in his words."
Sherlock attempted to stand to berate John a bit more for his inattention, when his legs gave out and it was only the doctor's quick intervention that prevented him from hitting the floor. John hauled him up, wrapped his arms around the immobilized detective, dragged him over to his leather chair, and gently sat him down. He bent to his own knees and began carefully palpating Sherlock's numb thighs and calves.
Sherlock did the one thing John had always wanted to see him do with those fingers. He wrapped them around both of their cocks, enclosing them tightly and
No, that wasn't it. He struggled to think harder. He cringed at the thought of years ago when he had signed up for online dating after coming home from a pub crawl. That had been horrifying. Full stop horrifying.
Blondie fidgeted wildly and stage-whispered to Hamish. “There's people out here - did anyone hear that?” She looked around nervously at the two or three early appointment patients.
John was, of course, fatally embarrassed at this dreadful faux pas. All the same, right in the middle of that muddled, shamed guilt, John felt a bizarre twinge of heated jealousy. Possessiveness. He twisted his mouth ruefully and huffed out an exasperated sigh.
had made the mess. The cushions were askew and John's plaid blanket was a twisted and rumpled wadded-up ball on the floor. He scooped it up, gave it a flick of his wrists to straighten it, and then froze upon inspection.
John was floored. HE himself had left it and left it in the most convenient place for the one person who NEVER should have seen his pathetic ramblings. He dropped heavily back into the chair. That would be that, he mournfully lamented. He again hung his head, both hands foolishly hiding his eyes from Sherlock's.
Sherlock continued to appraise him searchingly. “I found it in my violin case this morning,” he countered calmly.
But how did it morph into the languid and almost sensual tone the letter took? John didn't see the his flatmate like that. How could he? This was Sherlock, for Christ’s sake. Good lord, DID he? John knew their relationship was more than a simple friendship. It always had been. Sherlock was his best friend, flatmate, the one that understood how he ticked, pushed his buttons, the life in his life. There wasn't anything John wouldn't or hadn't already done for him. In addition, the man looked revoltingly gorgeous in the modish clothes he swanned about in. The coat, the cheekbones.  Even HE had to admit that.
Sherlock objected to the loss of that hand in his hair and retaliated by grabbing John's arse cheeks and ground himself up onto John.
Sherlock dropped his head and let it rest heavily into John's shoulder. John held him tightly for a moment and then broke the embrace.
Syllabub. They had the pudding at the picnic, he recalled. He had fed John some from his spoon, just like he had nearly done tonight with the tiramisu and John was very appreciative, if memory served.
The detective opened the cabinet and handed the bottle to his rather agitated flatmate. John grabbed a glass, poured two fingers into the tumbler, and knocked it back ruthlessly. Sherlock winced in sympathetic pain as John spluttered a bit before he marched right in front of him and stopped to glare up at his face.
“You didn't hear? We had quite an incident earlier - the police had to be involved. John is fine. We all had a fright, but as a group, we decided to push through today. Stiff upper lip and all that.” Sarah tittered at her own joke.
“Oh, no. No, no,” the dark haired man chuckled. “Just me and you. Thought it would be good for us to get away from everything and just talk, be comfortable. Without distraction.” Hamish leaned in a bit with that last statement. “Don't know if that part is working though.You are even more distracting now than at the clinic.” He leaned in a even further towards John till their shoulders met for a moment before he pushed playfully away.
“You know where The Volunteer is right at the Baker Street station? Let's head there, you get a table, and I'll get clean shoes and meet you back.”
The American was taller, had a chin cleft Kirk Douglas would envy, had thinner lips, and lacked Sherlock's warm, spicy beguiling smell.
“H-hamish, huh? Um, I'm a Hamish too. Family name,” the doctor stammered out a little too helpfully and ran a hand quickly through the close-cropped hair at the nape of his neck.
The flat, upon entering, was dark and strangely still. John stopped to sigh and breathe in the comforting smell of home. Whiffs of formaldehyde, tea, Indian takeaway, rosin, burnt toast, and a hint of rosemary and soft musk all assaulted him like an over-eager fifteen year old boy with a can of pheromone body spray.
“Maybe I'm your cock, John,” he breathed into John's mouth, so close, their lips nearly brushed as he said it. “The part that wants this so badly.”
“Mr. Lopez?” She looked around expectantly. “Mr. Lopez?” She leaned over the maths hating assistant’s shoulder to check the scheduling screen.
Sherlock squeaked at the touches to his lips and tried to rigidly weather this downright tactile assault from John as dignified as he could. They stared at each other for the eternity of a few seconds. Sherlock then quickly excused himself for the night, all but ran to his room, and slammed the door.
“A most cryptic, although flowery message. We cannot weather another 'fan’ like I was burdened with. That would never do for my faithful blogger to be put into danger.” He dragged his focus from the computer for a brief moment to lock his penetrating verdigris gaze on John's.
!!!!” John’s cock went completely rigid and his eyes screwed shut as he convulsed wildly and pulsed ribbon after ribbon of hot release onto Sherlock's stomach.
Sherlock awoke with a jolt. John's delicious weight had suddenly stiffened and he knew what that meant. John was also awake and aware.
Hamish let go of the coat and gave Sherlock a quick up and down assessment. He bent to pick up the papers, and stood staring appraisingly.
The stairs passed mostly unnoticed under their feet. They both hung up coats and found themselves facing one another in the warm, familiar walls of the sitting room.
Hamish opened the door, ushered Sherlock inside and effectively negated that brief respite Sarah had been enjoying.
Sarah left that whole statement hanging to see what response it would elicit. She glanced at Sherlock covertly and caught him making the most petulant, horrified face possible for a grown man, yet one that was filing away information and still managed to hold a degree of worry.
He had been edgy and manic and hadn't wanted to meet Sherlock's eye. He curtailed his usual morning ablutions and left hardly uttering a word. Fascinating.
The next morning found Sherlock draped listlessly across whatever piece of furniture he was on like a swooning Regency wallflower. John had stayed out late for him on a work night (1 o'clock) and went straight to his room. Sherlock pretended not notice his return (slightly flushed, probably from the couple of glasses of wine with his dinner and a general reluctance to meet Sherlock's eyes). He was strangely disappointed at the short, “G'nite, Sherlock,” as John climbed the stairs. Sherlock sighed in annoyance with himself.
“Make me what? What am I in this?” John demanded as soberly as he could with a lap full of writhing, aroused Sherlock.
“Well??” barked Sherlock. “What does it say?” He had that jumpy, ill at ease quality about him now that he had been forced to wait.
It was definitely time for him to be getting some sleep. John rubbed his eyes with a measure of aggravation and turned to grab the blanket from his chair to cover Sherlock when it happened.
Then in English.” You hold a lives, no, um, life in your hands. Water, tend and care for it, and love will be the fruit.” He faltered. “Love? That can't be right. She must have slipped this in my bag while I was out checking the results of her x-ray. But why, Sherlock? I'm a doctor, I suppose I do that, in an abstract way, sort of, tending, minding...” John started and trailed off uncertainly. “Love and fruit? What the hell is THAT about?” He looked up inquiringly to the taller man, but was too late.  No answer would be immediately forthcoming. Sherlock was the proverbial shark scenting blood on the water as he eagerly commandeered John's laptop and flopped himself in that elegant way he did, onto the sofa, fingers already flying across the keys.
He MUST have inadvertently fallen asleep on the sofa after all. Sherlock was still faintly puzzled as to how he felt so agreeable now after waking in such an awkward position.
“Well, it can't be Dr. Rowe or Dr. Watson - they already have patients now, so it must be Dr. Sawyer, Mr. uh, Lopez,” she squinted at the bookings again and nodded.
Sherlock ran his nails up the inside opposite leg right up to the testicles and John's skin broke out into a battalion of gooseflesh.
Sherlock took a deep breath into his lungs and threw his arms over his head in a graceful yet careless fashion. He arched his long, sinuous spine and hummed low and deep.
John could physically feel the confusion on his own face as he helplessly goggled with his mouth hanging slightly open.
“Let's go home.” John reached for Sherlock's hand and Sherlock quietly slid his fingers into John's. They turned to look at each other, which morphed into the complete inability to tear their eyes away. They both realized at the same time that this was
John made his way cautiously across the room, hands out in front of him like a game of Blind Man's Bluff.
The front door opened carefully and it became apparent that the police had arrived. An Armed Response Unit member walked slowly in, his hands raised and cautiously pointing to the ceiling. He made an obvious display of being empty-handed. He called out to Mr. Chamberlain that he was going to help him, he just needed him to put the knife down and stay where he was. No one would hurt him, he just needed to take a deep breath and…
“You wanted firelight, it is lit and roaring,” (An open mouthed bite across John's strap-like sternocleidomastoid muscle.) “The table, the give and take.” (A suck and a tantalizing swirl to the skin along the carotid artery.) “All of it, yes. Why did it take you so long?” Sherlock growled again, low and menacing, as John tipped his head back helplessly to give him further access.
John took a quick breath and slid his own mouth down that exquisitely alabaster neck, sucking and lightly biting along the way. Sherlock bucked in heady response.
Sherlock's eyes bolted open almost painfully and with a thumping of a nearly tachycardic heartbeat in his chest.
John halted in his tracks. He realised that he was aware that he was dreaming, but it was the most vivid dream he had had in quite some time. Everything seemed very saturated and intense and gave him the weirdest sense of foreboding.
“With my tea bags??? Damn it all! That's FOOD, Sherlock! And not only that, but food that is MINE!!”
He regarded Sarah with a look of stupefaction as she spun on her heel and stalked away from him without another word.
When John returned home that evening, he was laden with bags. He had felt vaguely guilty for his rude exit from the flat this morning and very foolish at his body's own rogue reaction to last night's events.
Make it stop. Stop. Leave me ALONE! “ He rubbed wildly at the skin of his arm and swung the hand holding the knife around frantically.  “Give me the pills and I can sleep. I can't take anymore. NOW!!! It's trying to kill me! Please just give me the pills…please...” He whined and cried at them.
Sherlock set his face very blandly. “I think her note was quite thought-provoking actually, he flatly commented, not looking at John directly as he spoke. That set John's alarm bells ringing again. He bent at the waist and handed the paper from the floor to Sherlock cautiously.
Sherlock worked into the night. The message the old woman had given John perplexed him. Around 3:30 a.m., he discovered something potentially important. He had scanned the note and had a translation done directly from words on the paper. It gave him a slightly different translation than what John had. Where John had said 'life’, the word was actually ‘heart’.  “You hold a heart in your hands. Water and tend and care for it with your own, (John had left that part out) and love will be your fruit.” What sort of dull sentiment was this? Whose heart was John holding? Was this woman a threat to John? A stalker? Sherlock lay on the sofa placing his palms together across his chest, fingers gently resting underneath his chin. This required further study. An hour or so passed before he realized how much better he thought when John was nearby and touching him. Like tonight. The doctor's short, sturdy fingers tracing patterns on his thigh idly, as he watched the telly and Sherlock worked. It made things seem clearer. Brighter even.
Sherlock rolled his body wantonly again and drew one arm across his t-shirt clad chest with a feathery touch.
Sherlock, still stunned at what he read in John's eyes, instinctively reached up and pulled John down and brushed his mouth across John's bottom lip.
John stole a glance over to the Study in Concentration. Sherlock's eyes were closed and John took a moment to gaze at him appraisingly without his knowledge. Shit. He sighed almost wistfully. Why this now? He had been comfortable here. It was home. He finally belonged somewhere. John slumped further down into his chair and hung his head in abject resignation. The letter was true and he now knew it. He wanted Sherlock. That sounded so foreign in his head, but it was real. One thing was for certain - it would ruin everything.
Sarah, to her credit, hadn't ostracized him completely, but that spark was definitely gone that she may have had for him. They had worked back up to congenial colleagues who could occasionally share a joke, a gentle smile, and a passive aggressive potshot at each other once in awhile.
John's eyes widened in alarm. There was no doubt that he had walked on his flatmate in the midst of a scorching-hot sex dream.
Hamish walked on towards the restaurant at a slower pace. He found an unoccupied bench along the sidewalk and got out his phone.
“I was trying to get you to understand something I have observed about the two of us,” he started again.
he had packed it in his bag after yesterday. He's been tearing the place apart this morning, just in case and had been nearly inconsolable about misplacing it. His parents gave it to him when he graduated from Bart's, you know. He was so worried that he had left it at the retirement home yesterday or on the Tube somehow. He even called the home to see if they had it.”
“Really, John. The fuss you are making,” Sherlock scoffed. “You would think that I had done it to YOU.”
John raced up the stairs at 221B and quietly and fervently willed Sherlock not to be home. Sitting room - empty. Same emptiness in the kitchen. He continued up to his room, not quite believing his luck. Opening his closet, he pondered his shoe choices and a maybe shirt change. It was not like he was hiding anything from Sherlock, he sanctimoniously told himself. He just really didn't want to have to explain that he was having dinner with a gregarious, playful, and even affectionate version of his flatmate, TO his flatmate.
John ceased to breathe. His mind went staggeringly blank and with an inhuman grunt, he tried to haul Sherlock up on top of him and lunged for his mouth.
Sherlock frowned at that. He had pilfered the stethoscope from John's medical bag last night when he got home, before he had gone back out to meet the wretched Hamish. Sherlock felt an unexpected pang of remorse and regret for making John worry about the loss of what he had thought was just a simple tool of John's work. He had no idea John had such an attachment to the device and wished belatedly that he had nicked something more emotionally neutral to forward his plan.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock pulled him close and wrapped his arms around his waist. “Only you would argue with your subconscious and cast me as the role of your cock. I should almost be flattered.”
“It's funny. Rosemary is supposed to be for remembrance - my gran always said that,” John mused. “Well, I for one won't ever forget this, you magnificent git.”
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat to force the image to dissipate. “I hadn't realized it had been so long. I was working at the table with the hair swatches,and a draft blew them on the floor. I suppose I got, erm, d-distracted picking them up.”
“ANYway,” John continued, “I did an Xray - nothing broken, thankfully, bandaged her up,  gave her anti inflammatories, and sent them on their way. Was a bit embarrassing though. She didn’t speak much English, so I tried out my Pashto on her. I hope I didn’t muck it up TOO badly. It’s been awhile,” he apologetically pondered. She HAD looked at him rather oddly at times. "I got that she had been her village's healer when she was in her younger days."
Sherlock turned his own, albeit fake, dazzling smile on the interloper. Time to get back to business.
Sherlock bounded up the stairs about an hour later. John was reading the paper in his chair and feeling the satisfied heavy sleepiness of a man content in his domain.
? John, I've been yours from the very beginning. Even before I was aware of it. I always belittled the thought of a relationship with anyone. How it would interfere with the Work, how I had
“They've been locked in a careful orbit around each other for years, I think. If something was going to happen, it would have by now. Either that or they are just
Sherlock's lips now dragged a light trail up the side of John neck and the tip of his tongue stole a quick taste of John's heated skin. John moaned helplessly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's back, trying to bring him closer.
He stirred again and was rewarded with the warm, heavy weight of his blankets as they  resettled themselves around him amidst the comforting presence. John sighed after a deep inhale and drifted back into sleep.
How did he DO that? Fuck. He felt his stomach flip a little involuntarily and his cock twitch ever so slightly to the Siren's call that was Sherlock's voice.
Launching himself from his chair, Sherlock grabs his coat. “Come on, John, the case is practically solved but I’d like to take a look at his flat to confirm my suspicions.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow at his tone, but his lips quirk. “Alright, off out, then.” He flies down the stairs, John careening after him, pausing only long enough to grab his wallet and gun, checking the magazine for silver bullets.
Sherlock continued to frown, looking troubled, but then she got a text and flew off the bed and out of the bedroom, making a racket as she searched through the mess of papers in the sitting room.
His route takes twice as long as usual, a circuitous path that avoids the CCTV cameras. Something of his mental state must show on his face, because people dodge out of his way as he strides along the pavement. He doesn’t know with whom he is angrier: himself, for missing the signs; Mycroft (
By the time they arrive, John is hunched in his seat, head bowed and hands gripping his hair. Sherlock slams to a stop at the edge of the trees, yanks out the key, and they launch themselves from the car, John practically falling out.
Gasping into John’s mouth, Sherlock writhed under John’s possessive touches, rocking John onto her thigh with a hand at the small of her back. Breaking away from the kiss, Sherlock’s lips took John’s earlobe prisoner, lipping and nipping at the delicate flesh while slowly slipping a hand up John’s bare thigh, tucking her fingertips under the hem of her dress. Eyes closed and mouth dropping open, John panted into Sherlock’s ear, feeling hot and desperate, a throbbing ball of heat between her legs that spiked and flared like the sun.
John freezes and looks to Sherlock, only to find his partner looking back at him, equally unsure. Sherlock, unsure?
Heart pounding with her own daring, John ducked to press a line of kisses down Sherlock’s throat, over her collarbone, down her heaving sternum. Maybe she was drunk enough after all. She couldn’t deny the thrill that accompanied the thought of what she was about to do.
“You almost died last night because of him,” Mycroft hisses, looking at their linked hands in distaste. “I was informed this morning of a minor calibration error in our tracking system only to discover that there was no error – you never quite made it to your
Eyes narrowed, Sherlock gets up and disappears into their room and emerges moments later with a dingy black bag. “I use it for my homeless disguise,” Sherlock mutters in response to John’s questioning look.
“Shh,” Sherlock whispered into her skin, nudging her legs apart with a foot. “Someone might hear you.”
John’s fingers slip free and Sherlock nearly whines. “Hold on, love,” John murmurs, getting up. “I’m just going behind you.” The bed shifts as he rearranges himself so he can lie along Sherlock’s back without Sherlock putting pressure on his stitches, then immediately wraps an arm around his waist to tuck them together. There’s a click from the lube bottle and Sherlock arches his back in preparation.
With a long blink, Sherlock steps back, forcefully expelling his self-indulgent thoughts. This is no lovers’ game and Sherlock’s never been one to shy from the truth.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but accepts another kiss, humming in surprise when John straddles him on the couch. He fists John’s jumper in his hands, tilting his head back to better meet John’s lips, all thoughts of his brother flying from his mind. It’s hours later that he manages to pick up his phone to make the call.
Things are going well – they’re following a lead, the solution within sight – until John manages to get his head bashed in with a crowbar. He loses consciousness for about thirty seconds, during which time Sherlock convinces Lestrade not to call an ambulance. The following five minutes after John has gotten up are spent convincing him that, no, that cracking sound wasn’t John’s skull splitting open. There’s blood matted in John’s hair and trickling down his neck, which doesn’t help their cause as John insists that he’s fine, with nothing more than a cut and a mild concussion. Unavoidably, Lestrade sends them home after that, still looking dubious and bewildered.
“Christ, I knew he cracked his skull open that one time,” he mutters, elbows on his knees. “Why are you telling me all this?”
John nearly laughs. His gun is still in Sherlock’s coat and this little weasel has a knife. It’s practically an invitation.
“So, what are you two working on today? Anything I can help with? I’m a trainer here,” Jared says to Sherlock, as if it weren’t obvious.
“Why are you here? No one died so it’s not your division.” Lestrade opens his mouth but Sherlock cuts him off, practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. “Actually, I don’t care. Know what I realized? After John’s…attack, my brother sent us a package of things to help me, but nothing to help John.”
John groans, his hands on Sherlock tightening. “Roll over,” he urges, shifting them to lie facing each other, Sherlock on his good side. He pulls Sherlock’s leg over his own and Sherlock delves back into a kiss, grunting in disapproval when John turns away. “Hold on,” John says, twisting to reach into the nightstand drawer. “Just let me – got it.” He turns back and kisses Sherlock enthusiastically, his now slicked fingers returning between Sherlock’s legs.
Silver knife in hand, Sherlock watches John with apprehension. “I don’t think I like this experiment.”
“How did you…? Oh.” Jared smiles and approaches the drawing that caught Sherlock’s eye. “This is from my oldest, Natalie. She figures herself a ninja, but the missus won’t let her start training until she’s six,” Jared says with a wink. His smile fades as he considers the drawing. “I struggled with a lot of anger when I was sent home. I was furious that I’d lost my leg, angry that I’d lost my career, I was even angry with my family for being so accepting of me when I felt like I didn’t deserve it. I tried to bottle it up, but then I’d just explode over the smallest things. It got to the point where Natalie would shy away from me if I so much as raised my voice – that’s when I knew I needed help.”
He groaned dismally as the pounding in his head was accompanied by the slamming of a door on its hinges, and the crass slap of feet on linoleum as someone stumbled to the bathroom. He pulled himself upright just as the culprit heaved, and he couldn't help but grimace at the sound of puke hitting the sides of the loo. Someone hadn't had a good night.
And then suddenly, it had all become clear. The drug habit – something that had been considered nothing more than a quirk to everyone other than Watson himself – could be the only explanation. Such prolonged use could only have weakened him, made him more susceptible to this plague, and now, acted as a catalyst, rushing the poor man into an early grave.
Sherlock woke up two days later, disorientated and weak - John had the tube removed from his throat and fed him sips of water as a friend, and always a friend. He left the medicine up to the consulting physician, who told Sherlock he would have to remain on dialysis until further notice - both heard the carefully unspoken: "Probably for a long while - former addicts tend not to be high up on the donor list."
"Ms. Hooper," he whispered, reaching down and gently grasping her shoulder. She shifted, stretching out her legs and squinting up at him. "Hi," he continued on quietly, "I've come to check up on you both."
"I merely explained that although you've had the vaccine, perhaps if would be best if you stayed in quarantine with Sherlock. But –" he held up a mask. "You have to wear this."
Sherlock opened his mouth incredulously to protest, but was interrupted by more hacking coughs, not anticipating the way the dusty air would scrape the back of his throat. John gripped onto his arm, fingers massaging a soothing pattern into his skin. The fit can't have lasted more than a minute or so, but it felt like hours, and soon Sherlock was slumped forward and lifting his inhaler with trembling fingers, breathless.
John woke up to harsh coughing a few weeks before Christmas, and lay in bed, unable to do anything but listen, for far too long. He could hear the way his friend's breath was rattling from all the way upstairs; could hear the repetitive hiss of his inhaler, and the short, quick gasps. Eventually, John made his way downstairs, pausing in Sherlock's doorway.
Sherlock hardly reacted to John's ministrations. He just stared, chest rising and falling in time with his heart rate.
"However," he continued, "I want you to remain vigilant. SCLC has always been difficult to detect, and so I'd like to perform one more course of radiation on your skull. This is both preventative and cautionary – I want to make sure the cancer cells have not, and will not, spread to your brain.
"Not good, not good mate," John said, squeezing his hand tighter so that his flatmate had something to ground him. "Slow it right down. Now."
Suddenly, Sherlock stumbles. As if still pretending to be the victim, he falls unceremoniously against the sofa, one hand gripping the fabric while the other reaches up to shield his eyes. Anderson shouts in surprise before waving his hands about in desperation. "Don't touch anything! You're contaminating the crime scene!"
"Sherlock!" John snapped authoritatively, and the detective stilled, looking up at him dazedly. The doctor turned back to the white coat, jaw set. "What do you plan to do?"
Sherlock blinked wearily, leaning into John's touch. His gut churned nastily, emitting a loud gurgle. "'M gonna be sick," was the only warning John had before Sherlock lunged for the toilet again. John half-held him upright as he burped wetly, bringing up nothing but spittle.
"Not the time for dramatics," he said, bending and lifting his friend from under the arms. Sherlock moaned, long and low, before falling sideways into the doorway, breathing heavy, measured breaths.
"He's sleeping," Molly told him as she shuffled in, sitting at the table. He nodded, opening the fridge.
He found Molly in the upstairs bedroom. She looked drawn, curled into the spare bedsheets with one hand twisted into the mattress and the other warmed against her cheek. Her under-eyes were dark, her hair limp and unwashed. He was loath to wake her.
There was a collective sigh. "Sherlock," John said, putting his hand on his arm, "It's six thirty AM. No ones out there yet."
"Neither." John looked tired, and Greg wasn't surprised - he'd been up all day and night caring for his sick best friend. And Sherlock was no ordinary patient.
"Oh Sherlock," John said, putting the bucket down and using the cloth to wipe his mouth. He hated seeing his best friend this way - he was always so strong and arrogant, so smart and annoying. The sympathy John was experiencing for the detective right now was almost overwhelming.
"Dr. Watson, please." The good doctor glanced up from his book – a red thing, lined with a gauzy gold leaf – and lifted his greying brow. "My contemplative state is already hindered, by the oppressiveness of this unusual British summertime. I would appreciate your – how should I put this – sympathetic
John picked up the discarded syringe from beside his friend. "What's this? What have you given him?" He leaned in closer, watching as Sherlock blinked dozily. "Sherlock?"
"His recovery went smoothly eighteen months ago, but the drugs left somewhat permanent damage. It was only a matter of time before they gave out. I'm sorry, Dr. Watson."
"Sherlock? Sherlock. I need you to stay with me." The brunette squinted at him. "Do you have a headache?"
Mycroft kept the knowledge of Sherlock's absence seizure to himself for the following week - partially wanting to be sure of his conclusions, and partially hoping he was mistaken. He kept a close eye on the toddler as he pottered about the garden with his wooden sword and paper hat, watching for any signs that his mind may have left him, but as the days went on, it appeared more and more like the event had been a singularity. That was, until Saturday evening came to pass.
Except, despite only knowing Sherlock for a week, he felt he had formed a bond with him. During Fresher's Week, meaningless conversation after meaningless conversation had left him exhausted and lonely. His mingling had been a hopeless endeavour – and then Sherlock had waltzed in wearing nothing but a towel; and John wasn't so scared about this big thing called
The ambulance arrived two minutes later, earlier than predicted, and took Sherlock away on a stretcher. When asked if he was family, John replied within a heartbeat - yes, he was his fiancé, and he would sit in the ambulance with him, goddammit.
It's agonisingly long before the results show up, even though everyone present knows barely a minute can have passed. When they do show, both doctor and detective inspector wince. "One point two," Lestrade hisses, and John feels sick. "Lift his head, I'll see if I can wake him up. I need to get this down him." He holds up the juice carton, grimacing. "It may be warm, but it will have to do."
"I said, that was amazing." John looked about the hall, as if profiling another case study for Sherlock's gift. "Can you do it again?"
John's head snapped round, mouth open and prepared to shriek every profanity, but the elder Holmes had already left, the tapping of his umbrella a ghostly echo on the floor. He croaked, and then choked, knees buckling as he slumped into the bedside chair.
Once the cannula was fitted, he cleared his throat desperately, until John dutifully fed him sips of water. He shook with only the effort of lifting his head, and had to resist crying in front of his friend – he did not want to look more pathetic than he already felt.
The detective released the breath he didn't realise he'd been holding and did as he was told. He had never been here during a crisis, only when Sherlock had either been sleeping or sitting quietly in the living room, and he struggled to control his trembling hands as he drew his friend a glass of water. For a minute he just stood, gasping a little, unable to turn around, until he heard Molly call him from the bathroom amidst some other, frightful noises.
"Sure." John took in his flat mates appearance and shook his head. Sherlock's mouth said he wasn't sick, but the pallor of his face, the sheen of sweat on his forehead and the involuntary shudders that passed through his body said otherwise. Not to mention the now vomit-filled basin John held in his hands. "If you're not sick, then I'm not an adrenaline junkie." He wandered to the kitchen and filled a glass by the tap, placing it more gently on the table before Sherlock in order to avoid another hurling episode. "Open," John ordered as he thrust a thermometer in Sherlock's direction. The detective glared but obeyed, his bowed lips snapping over the mercury and glass.
"He's right," John agrees, but his voice holds more anger. Massaging his shoulder out of habit, he stares at Sherlock head on. "You could've been in some real danger there Sherlock. If you know you are diabetic, why would you risk skipping a meal that could stop something like this happening?" In reality, John knew why. Sherlock was an idiot who couldn't care less about his health - that would never change. But what John was really angry about, was that Sherlock had never told him. Him, John Watson, a doctor, living under the same roof, and he had been completely unaware about the whole thing.
"I –" his voice broke, the words stuck. He blinked, shook his head, and blinked again. "I'm fine," he croaked, though nobody had asked. "When do I start?"
When he did awake, Sherlock's first reaction was panic. They had not removed the ventilator, and so the young man had weakly fumbled with the machine, BP increasing in tempo as he watched John with wide, fearful eyes. The other student hushed him, whispering soothing words and taking his hands away from the equipment. He massaged Sherlock's palms with his own, shaking fingers.
Mycroft huffed heavily as Sherlock stilled, consoled by his even breathing and lightly flickering eyelids. Since that Christmas, Sherlock had been put on a more aggressive treatment, and it was rare for any of his tonic-clonic seizures to become too serious anymore. The elder Holmes rubbed the detective's shoulder soothingly as he came to, smiling slightly when those blue eyes finally met his own.
With a final sniffle, John lifts his head for a kiss that is heartbreaking for its relief. God, Sherlock loves this man. He’s been too blind by his own guilt and insecurities to clearly see John’s.
“Your wife and kids surely appreciate that,” Sherlock says distractedly, eyes sweeping the room, noting a child’s drawing of a colourful, grimacing monster taped to one of the targets.
Sherlock purchased two drinks – a beer for John and a rum and coke for herself – and John raised an eyebrow, lifting on her tiptoes to place her lips near her girlfriend’s ear. “You could just get a coke you know,” John pointed out, accepting her sweating glass. Sherlock didn’t like to drink while on a case – alcohol compromised her focus.
Under John’s appreciative gaze, a knowing smirk had tugged at the corner of Sherlock’s red-tinted lips. She slouched against the door frame, accentuating the curve of her hip under the perfectly tailored fabric. “I made dinner. Hurry up and we can eat before we go.”
“No. Neither of us wanted them,” he says easily. “The strongroom is this way if you’d like to see it.”
“I’ve never asked you to ignore a case for me,” he continues, voice rough, “but if you could at least spare a
He doesn’t know if he should tell John what he found, if that would just prompt John to replace the pill. He doesn’t know how to tell John that without him, he doesn’t know if he could survive. He’s tempted to call his brother and scream at him.
It had been late, John had had a few drinks with dinner, and they’d decided to do a video call over their laptops. Sherlock had just solved the case John had abandoned and was especially pleased with herself. John had been enamoured of her self-satisfied preening and had decided to reward her with a bit of a strip show. She’d half meant it as a joke until she realized Sherlock was quite seriously interested.
“Aren’t you curious,” John asks, retrieving his medical bag, “what my body is capable of? I am. I want to know what my limits are, what I can expect.” He pulls out his case of scalpels. “I think seeing it will help you understand that I’m not as delicate as I used to be.” Supplies ready, John washes his hands and sits at the table, arms exposed by his t-shirt.
Lying on the bed, Sherlock presses his palms together and brings his trembling fingertips to his lips. “Presumptuous of you to assume you can help.”
Blushing, self-conscious, John resisted the urge to duck her head and hunch her shoulders while they quickly washed their hands, staying close to Sherlock’s side as they walked past the other women to leave the loo.
“I know you love to play dress-up, but I’m not your doll,” John grumbles as he spins with his arms out, feeling like an idiot even though no one’s paying them any attention.
“I’m not ashamed,” John says quietly. “I’d be more than happy to tell Greg about us. In fact, I can text him right now.” He retrieves his mobile from his pocket. Sherlock leans over to watch as he types:
With an eyeroll, Sherlock downed the rest of her drink in three swallows. John watched her throat work. “Let’s dance.”
“I’m curious,” Sherlock drawls, crawling onto the bed and straddling John’s legs. It’s a Pavlovian response, the way John’s hands settle on Sherlock’s leanly muscled waist. “Which bodily fluids are the unquestionable ones?” He places one hand on John’s coat-clad shoulder and the other slips into John’s hair, his nimble fingers massaging John’s scalp.
A couple days before the next full moon, when John’s mood plummets and Sherlock stands helplessly on the other side of John’s closed bedroom door, he texts Lestrade. They meet in a public park, the same one Sherlock and John sat in after eating chips, and Sherlock tells him an abridged version of the truth. It goes about as well as expected, with an awful lot of disbelief and spluttering until Sherlock brings up a clip of John’s first transformation on his mobile.
John braces himself, fully expecting Sherlock to forget himself and burst into his room, unconcerned with the werewolf prepared to launch itself at any intruders. Fortunately, John does not have to resort to mauling him, as Sherlock comes to a standstill outside his door. By the shadows of his big feet, the man is poised with his nose nearly pressed to the door.
John snorts in disbelief. He flicks on the telly and starts pulling out the food containers, a clear dismissal.
“Well, I’m a writer, but times have been tough recently. Then a friend texted me about this job posting, a modeling company looking for red-headed men.”
In case it wasn't already obvious, I know next to nothing of London geography. The settings are entirely made up.
With a smile, John grabs his coat, stuffs his wallet – which Sherlock does not stare at – and mobile in his pockets, and they’re on their way.
John tucks one hand into Sherlock’s tangled mess of curls and sweeps the other down Sherlock’s back, Sherlock’s skin singing with the contact. He hums into John’s mouth in approval, nipping his bottom lip when that strong, skilled hand begins massaging his arse and upper thigh. Eyes closed, they continue kissing, relearning each other by touch, as their lips grow swollen and sensitive and their cocks increasingly eager. When John’s hand begins moving with more intent, fingers sliding between his cheeks, Sherlock breaks away from the kiss and presses their foreheads together, panting with anticipation. He nudges his leg up encouragingly, flexing his thigh against John’s impressive erection. He loves how big John is, and with his fingertips teasing his hole, Sherlock feels himself throb against John’s hip.
“Could have fooled me,” he says to Sherlock’s offended expression. “For example, if I were to do this –” John fluidly sidesteps Sherlock and wraps an arm around his neck, pulling him backwards and off his centre of gravity in one move. Sherlock yelps a bit and stumbles back, hands automatically grasping at John’s arm. John keeps his body back and dodges Sherlock’s ineffectively waving hands, keeping Sherlock’s back awkwardly arched so that he can’t get his feet under him. He’s not exerting any pressure on Sherlock’s neck, simply holding him in this position, where John’s shorter stature is actually an advantage. “What do you do now, hm?” John asks.
Chest tight, John squeezed Sherlock’s hand encouragingly, that pang blossoming into a warm ache. “You want what?”
He has never felt this combination of emotions before – doesn’t know how to process it, his mind a numb blankness of horror. With careful movements, he cleans and puts away his beakers and chemicals. He flushes the remnants of the pill. He puts John’s wallet back exactly where he found it. He finds his own wallet in the bedroom and leaves the flat.
The sound that rips from John’s throat is pure desire and alpha aggression, and he bites Sherlock’s shoulder to smother the sound at the same time that he wraps a hand around Sherlock’s cock.
“Saved you from your stupidity,” Sherlock spits, hands shaking. “And myself from the sight of my partner committing suicide in front of me.”
John felt hyperaware, despite the buzz of alcohol in her system. She could feel Sherlock’s breasts pressing against the bare skin of her back. She could hear the woman relieving herself in the next stall. She could smell their sex over the stench of the loo. She could feel Sherlock’s breaths tickling the hairs on her neck and the heat of her fingers hovering over her aching clit.
“Shit!” John scrambles up and out of Sherlock’s arms. “My shift is in an hour,” he exclaims and heads straight for the shower.
John flashes a smile that’s more menace than pleasure and Sherlock swallows hard. He wants to step up behind his partner and press himself to John’s back, wants to feel every quiver of muscle as John takes his shot.
The music changed to something deep and sultry, the rhythm overpowering, guiding their bodies with intent. Sherlock was too tall to comfortably grind against John’s thigh, so John pressed her hip bone forward instead, circling her hips slowly. The hand on her thigh clenched and slipped higher. Eyelids heavy, John undid a button on Sherlock’s shirt and pressed her lips to newly exposed skin, hot and flushed under her mouth. The hand at the small of her back shifted to grab at her waist, thumb digging into the flexing muscles of her stomach. She undid another button. More skin, sweat, heat. She licked, feeling Sherlock’s pulse race under her tongue. The hand on her upper thigh slid back, fingers squeezing her bum – she hadn’t bothered to wear shorts under her dress. Sherlock shuddered against her, rubbing against her hip bone.
John accepts the excuse gratefully and Sherlock follows suit, shaking hands with the trainer again before retreating to the change room. John is silent and distracted as they leave, and climbs into the cab Sherlock hails without protest.
John laughs, sounding more like himself, and gently lowers them to lie down again. There’s a brief struggle as Sherlock decides to rid himself of all his clothes, and again with the sheets, but they manage to settle into a comfortable embrace in their little cocoon. With the sun rising, they drift into slumber.
They don’t sleep much the rest of the night, and when John gets up at five Sherlock doesn’t protest.
Pressing a final kiss to John’s scarred shoulder, Sherlock gets up and heads for the small shower. “Come on, we’d best go save Scotland Yard from their own ineptitude.”
John’s eyes widen and then crinkle with his smile. They rearrange so they can face each other and John grasps Sherlock’s hand between their chests. “I love you, too.”
“I’m not even fucking human! How could you forget that? You’re practically terrified of me, but step in the way of a bullet –” Sherlock is pale and John is not helping. With a curse he shuts himself up. He needs to leave, but the thought of going for a walk and braving the sounds and scents of London makes him nauseated. “There’s ibuprofen over the sink,” he mutters, heading for the stairs to his room. “I’ll be down in a bit.”
“Anything?” the DI asks, standing off to the side. The alley is cordoned off by police, but there’s a small crowd gawking on the street and Greg shuffles his feet, trying to block sight of the body with his own. They haven’t seen Greg in a while, and the man looks tired. John notices his wedding band is missing.
“I know I’m not the most handsome of men, Mr. Holmes, but I did some acting as a child and I figured, no harm in trying, right? So I sent in my photo and application –”
, Sherlock thinks. The photos may have made him nostalgic, but nostalgia hadn’t persuaded him to retrieve them in the first place. He had been upset after seeing Jared.
Lowering his hands, Lestrade turns to face him more fully, eyebrows raised. “You needed to tell me John is a werewolf in order to ask for relationship advice?”
He can’t deny that, but he will not let the matter lie either. “You’ve been training me to defend myself – then let me defend myself! I’m more capable than you think.”
Somewhere deep within Sherlock Holmes, a sleepy, shadowy beast stirred. It had not had its slumber disturbed in quite a while now. The ill-tempered projection lifted its head and scented the air. It smelled blood.
John cursed aloud in frustration and frankly scared a few passers-bys. He helplessly folded his arms over his head and sucked in a muffled whine.
“John has helped me endeavor to deserve that respect. He is truly a remarkable man.” Sherlock spoke quietly and then stopped to wait for entrance at the staff kitchen door.
“Yes, Grandmother, I did just as you would have.” Vida murmured. She shook her head ruefully and walked over to kiss her grandmother's cheek dotingly. The old woman snorted softly.
Sherlock could disrupt anything he damned well chose, but heaven forbid if John prevented the free-flow of Sherlock’s own brand of chaotic entropy.
. Tell them we have a disturbed and possibly violent drug addict and we need assistance. YOU, Hamish Waugh, will get the people here in the waiting area outside as well as Nurse Nan. Quietly. Make something up. Gas leak, whatever. We can't have a potential hostage situation. I'm going to lock down the lab staff. Dr. Rowe isn't here yet, is she?”
His ejaculate sped the way for Sherlock and with another two pumps, he was there - soaring as he spent all over John's chest and stomach.
“Is Dr. Watson home?” The young woman countered, pushing her way inside and peering around. Sherlock was taken aback by the woman's assertiveness and allowed her to enter.
Sherlock's eyes closed of their own volition and a tiny shiver chased it's way down his spine. John's breath in his ear and his strong emotion had started a chain reaction of response that he was nearly helpless to slow its reckless course through his body. John had a tendency of doing that to him at quite random and infuriating intervals. Sherlock took a deep breath and as haughtily as he could muster, rolled a snarky “Obviously,” from his lips.
Sherlock dipped back down to gently lap with the tip of his tongue at the sensitive spot behind John's ear he had discovered on the journey downwards to the heat of John's open shirt.
“You see, I do admit that I neglected to label that specimen. I'm conducting an experiment on the direct effect of concentrated beta carotene on the human cornea in relation to ocular functionality and encroching presbyopia.
It was a tedious work day that certainly wasn't improved by his lingering hangover. Case after case of stomach flus, allergies, screaming babies with earaches, and the occasional self diagnosed alarmist. John shuffled home, up the stairs, and collapsed onto the sofa. He let his head fall heavily on the back of the padded upholstery and took a few deep breaths in and out. He gingerly sat back up after a bit and immediately saw his laptop. On the coffee table. Dammit. Sherlock must have used it. AGAIN. He just left it there to hibernate or to damn well run down to nothing on the battery, the rude git. Why did he even bother changing his password, he grumpily mused, savagely pounding it out onto the keys.
One of Sherlock's latest web tabs popped up to grotesque life. Oh, dear God. THAT was going to take a few nights to scrub from his nightmares. Medieval torture. Right. Note to self - Never suggest a Google search to a tall, infuriating arsehole when he doesn't GET a Monty Python sketch. That was just stupid on his own part. He should have just left to meet up with Lestrade instead of encouraging the berk to watch it with him before he headed out last night. It WAS rather miraculous that Sherlock had actually taken his suggestion, though.
“Ah. So the groom today, hmm?” Sherlock brushed a bit of imaginary fluff from his trousers idly. John's eyes couldn't help but trail down the impossibly long legs to follow the motion of those nimble fingers. Dammit. He was doing that on purpose.
“How did we get here, Sherlock? It's a bloody miracle, honestly, “John softly mused. “You know I love you too, right? I think I always have.”
He pulled Sherlock's face up between his hands and crushed their mouths together. Sherlock melted into his body and dropped his weight completely into John's lap.
Sherlock scrambled up as well as he could, tangling his legs in his pajamas on the way. John pulled his face roughly in, teeth clashing slightly, and Sherlock felt utterly consumed by John.
The essence of rosemary and tea, and the smell of...well, home. Or rather, his flatmate and best friend.
But that letter was about need. And want. Softness. Desire. Is that what his drunken lizard brain was trying to get him to see?
John never forgot that one, though. He told Sherlock about it as they lay in bed, sweaty and panting and replete one night. Sherlock laughed uproariously.
John had rolled into his side and propped his head up on his hand via a bent elbow. He toyed with Sherlock's curls around his face and then buried his hand into his scalp and tugged gently.
“No, I, well, NO. It was cruel of you. Really it was. Toying with him like that,” John stammered embarrassingly. He felt his tongue swipe quickly over his lower lip of its own volition. Sherlock's eyes followed it and his own cupid-bowed mouth parted like he wanted to join it.
“Me? What do you mean?” John stuttered a bit with that last statement (neatly avoiding the first) and slid a quick look at his shoes before he met Sarah's gaze again.
to send John into panic. The bag of supplies they took yesterday is still in his office. He brought them back this morning. I know he looked in it briefly in his search today, but I bet I could come up with a reason for him to look again and find it there.”
Sherlock nodded his understanding and spun around and took a seat with a good view of the inside of the clinic. One optimally away from the front desk. He huffed a small breath at his luck. The silly girl could have asked for his name before she tried to figure out which doctor he would be seeing. That would have meant less intel gleaned about what the other doctors were doing.
“You,” Sherlock said, eyes wide, guileless. “I want you forever, and it was only from missing you that I realized what I had to lose.”
Sherlock smiled, face flushed. “Good deduction.” She pulled John closer again, her hair tickling John’s cheek. “Except mine’s a double.” She swiftly finished her drink and handed off her empty glass to someone’s waiting hand. Considering her two beers, John opted to pace herself. She wasn’t as much of a lightweight as Sherlock, but they were both going to be feeling that soon enough.
The case is not without points of interest, but is ultimately disappointing – a crime of passion disguised as a satanic ritual. They find the culprit hiding out at a friend’s house and the arrest is conducted without resistance.
Still sprawled in the dirt, Sherlock shakes his head mutely, stuffing the gun in his pocket. Cold dread fills his stomach as he rummages his other pocket. The car key is missing.
The pounding of footsteps precedes the appearance of Mr. Amberley, wild-eyed and holding a rifle. “You can’t do that!” he wails and aims the weapon at John, who is closest to him.
Bowing her head, John bit her lip as she realized how audacious their new position was. There was someone on the other side of the stall wall John was leaning on. In her peripheral vision, she could see a woman washing her hands through the gap along the stall door. She burned, arched into Sherlock’s hold, spread her legs for the hand slipping up her inner thigh. Breath hot on the back of her neck, Sherlock chuckled, pressed her pelvis to John’s bum.
He barely hesitates after reading Lestrade’s text – he’s stalking out of the cottage and through the trees before he can change his mind. He jumps into the car and reaches the crime scene in just over an hour.
“No sugar. Definitely no sugar.” John's eyebrows furrowed briefly as he recalled the one time Sherlock had given him sugared coffee. “I like just about anything, except having to mince about with ungrateful pensioners who accuse us of shooting them full of sedatives and mind control substances instead of flu shots.”
‘It’s like a curse,’ he thought, sighing wearily. He was exhausted and felt dirty in a cloying and tooth-rotting sort of way. A shower was definitely in order.
He needed to stop doing that - making himself second guess the nature of his relationship with Sherlock. There wasn't anything there like that. Hadn't he told everyone within earshot, again and again, that he wasn't gay? That they weren't a couple? Everyone seemed to assume along those lines. Sherlock never seemed to correct anyone on that assumption, oddly enough. He would correct everyone on any other bloody thing, but not that. Why the hell not?
“You got distracted and stayed on the floor so long you compressed nerves and mucked up your circulation? Who is the idiot now?” He shook his head and went back to the task of heating the water for the bottle.
Sherlock takes out his frustration on Mr. Wilson. “Honestly, no wonder you’re out of work. I can’t imagine you’ve ever written anything worth reading in your entire life.”
The stubbornness fades away as John’s eyes flick over him, his shoulders hunching. “The fact that you’re here, that we’re both here, proves that,” he allows, stroking a thumb over a tender spot on Sherlock’s temple. He pulls away. “I’m cleaning those cuts.”
“SHERLOCK!” John bellowed. “What the bloody hell did you do to the tea bags, you insufferable git? If I wanted to buy loose leaf tea, I would have done that in the first place!!”
Message? Sherlock taken briefly aback by that statement. The note wasn't for John? Think. It was in the bag of lab supplies, but who would know it was not intended for John's use, John a doctor, bag on HIS desk...
John brought both of the steaming mugs into the sitting room and placed one in front of the other man. The paper that Sherlock had been holding between his palms was now unfolded on the coffee table. John picked it up and carelessly inspected it.
“Hey, at least you didn't get your shoes pissed on by one of the resident’s contraband cats,” John countered.
John hardly noticed. He sank into his chair and tried to find a little island of solace in the sea of chaos that was his mind right now. How had he mistaken Hamish for Sherlock really? Yes, the dark curly hair and the general tallness threw him immediately, as well as the similarly rounded posteriors.
John gasped as if he had been nearly burned. Sherlock's hand felt so fucking good, sliding a blistering path up and down his shaft. Squeezing it and sending little bursts of woody aroma trails of rosemary-scented slickness up to their brains and effectively making them cease to function properly.
Sherlock was actually FIXING this? Well. That certainly called for a celebratory cup of morning tea.
“I've been following Dr. Watson's blog. The adventures seem like something from a James Bond movie sometimes. I didn't know people could really be like that! He lives for that, doesn't he? He has a great deal of respect for you, you know. You can tell in his writing.”
Sherlock was dressed in one of his ridiculously fitted suits, sans jacket, just lounging there on the dream sofa, buttons nearly groaning in their buttonholes. The black silky fabric that was tautly pulled across his chest, rippled with every inhalation or really any movement Sherlock made at all. He was staring at John, eyes at half mast. Intense and intimate, like a great cat, feigning sleep to survey his hunting grounds before him, prey already targeted.
“Jaaawn...” Sherlock breathed into his mouth. It was all Sherlock could seemingly manage as he clutched and grappled with a savagely tight grip. John maneuvered his own arms around the taut lengthy flanks, pushing him into the alley wall, his lips teasing Sherlock's open until he was finally inside, tasting him. He was warm, wet, and sweet with the tang of juniper from his drink at the bar. John sucked soft, little helpless moans of response from Sherlock’s now pliant mouth. Sherlock felt himself sinking irrevocably under the spell of John's intoxicating words and the deliciously hot response to the way John was making his body
John stirred in his sleep uneasily as he became blearily half aware of an intrusion from the waking world. He could almost sense something. Nothing that required his immediate action like smoke or the acrid waft of chemicals from a dangerous experiment downstairs. But something that was just a bit out of place, but good. It seemed familiar - but just not in the usual context, here in his bedroom in the middle of the night...
Blondie took a cursory look around the waiting area, then shrugged, and mouthed to the nurse, “Dunno. He was here before.” The nurse sighed and walked away, presumably to tell Dr. Sawyer she had a little free time now.
yes. Holy shit, do it... Just, go slow. Whatever you want. Everything we've done so far has driven me crazy, you know. Because it's you. I'm getting close just thinking about it now…”
Sherlock settled back into the sitting room upon the sofa and proceeded to stare at John. It was unnerving. He could never REALLY tell if it was him being stared at or just in John's general direction.
“Sherlock, at the risk of jumping in feet first, which I'm REALLY trying not to do, I have to be honest. You showing up here kind of forces the point. You mean more to me than anyone I've ever meet. Ever. And I'm damned serious  about that. You are a home I've never known and we fit. We just do. I can't imagine my life without you in it. I'm asking you now if you'd want to take that further?”
John shook his head and went on to the next patient. Was that just an American thing? The exuberance? The loquaciousness?  It sure as hell wasn't British.
With a huff of irritation, Sherlock lunged down right into that face, grabbed his shoulders roughly, and with no finesse whatsoever, crushed his lips to John's. John, startled beyond belief, reared back and Sherlock chased and followed, towering over him, effectively pinning him to the chair.
. Two words that Sherlock had both written and spoken to John. Two words that would change their lives and hopefully take hold and flourish...
Sherlock raised his nose as John and the tall, dark haired man in the Burberry coat left. Yves Saint Laurent. Rive Gauche. It was the same person John had been with last night. Sherlock shuddered with disgust and then in a fit of pique, started his walk back to the flat.
you LEFT it somewhere? You've had that thing forever and literally trained yourself to keep it at your fingertips. Did you dump the supply bag out completely? It's a rather large one, you know.”
“Mrs. Greene in #2 needs her nappy bag. She said you put it up for her. Go get it, if you would, luv?” the woman gestured in the direction of the mentioned examination room.
His entire body blossomed and soared with heat. His fingers itched for a stronger purchase on the tweed coat and he grappled Sherlock closer. John felt him release a painfully held breath into his mouth and finally began to respond in John's arms.
Sherlock sat uncomfortably in his chair at Baker Street. He had a lot to consider before deciding his next move. He couldn't help the low level of dread that had been building in him since his conversation with Dr. Sawyer. Could he have missed his opportunity? The interloper was now a part of the balance and it was difficult to fully predict what he might do. The shadowy beast paced behind his heart menacingly and flexed its claws. He pulled out his mobile for a rare call.
John stomped up, poured himself the last of the wine and met Sherlock's eyes for the first time with a proud glare.
Sarah was clearly astounded by Sherlock's confession. This wasn't the sociopath she had seen manipulate and coerce without care except for furthering his own causes. He was actually concerned that John was distressed and repentant of his part in causing that. She had never seen Sherlock like this - so human and even caring about John’s feelings. She actually felt bad for him, even though he had brought this upon himself. She was tempted to just tell him to man up and give it back to John and take his punishment. But something in Sarah had shifted. She saw Sherlock in a way she hadn't before and right there, she decided she would help him.
“Tell me about your clients today, John, “ he sharply inquired as he pinned John with one of his interrogative glares.
John’s day started off rather badly. He  awoke at an awkward angle at the kitchen table -  face down on his laptop keyboard, his arms making for a poor excuse for a pillow. “What the hell…?” he blearily questioned his own sanity as to why he had fallen asleep at the computer in the first place.
“He seems to save all his winks for you. Besides, Sherlock wouldn't approve. You know he doesn't share.” Sarah gathered her notebook and pens, and pushed her chair under the computer desk. She started make her way to her next patient, a pointed smirk hurled in John's direction.
“Forgive me John, but I am feeling the most peculiar sense of deja vu,” Sherlock stopped, spoon poised at John's mouth.
“Is that the REAL reason, John? Somehow, I think we haven't gotten to the real heart of the matter.” Sherlock's eyes narrowed to slits as he appraised John from a few inches away.
I didn't usually crane my neck that much. Lemme see your mouth.” John swiped his thumb across Sherlock's Cupid’s bow and then to the impossibly fuller lower lip in turn.
After a moment, John shook his head muzzily and looked up at Sherlock who seemed to be closer to him than he was when he first started talking. “What was that about a needing the right conditions  to grow a date palm? Is that what she wrote? You really are talking rubbish, I see...” The last syllable became a bit stuck in John’s throat as incredibly, he felt Sherlock's fingers graze his cheek gently before settling there. It was warm and comforting and yet almost electric. Oddly, there were no clanging alarm bells going off. John felt like it belonged there somehow. He looked up, confused, into Sherlock's eyes that seemed to be asking an unspoken question.
The meal went down beautifully. The pasta was lovely and the wine complemented everything with its simplicity. John felt mellow and much more content with the world in general afterwards. Sherlock actually ate a good portion of his meal and most of the bread. John rose to grab the last box that he had kept hidden from Sherlock.
“Why are you doing this? This isn't like you, Sherlock,” he leaned his head back away from the looming one in front of him. “Why would you care about my thoughts about how you manipulate people for your own gain?”
He loved Sherlock. He always had. It didn't matter if he was gay, or bi, or whatever - it was whatever people called themselves that simply loved each other.
“Bolani! Oh, I loved these things over there.” John eagerly reached to select a portion, but his hand was suddenly arrested by the sound of paper hitting the floor. He must have disturbed it when he opened the top of the tray. “Another note?” he tiredly sighed. “What did she write to send you off on a wild goose chase THIS time? There was nothing sinister about that last one you know, just some silly twaddle about fruit and lives from a sweet but lonely old woman." It was his turn to roll his eyes heavenward, and he enjoyed it.
John had absolutely no objections when Sherlock tried the same area with his mouth. A hand to John's stomach soothed him enough to continue, though John breathing was becoming very erratic.
“I got us dinner, Sherlock,” John called out as he entered the flat and crossed into the kitchen to set everything down on the counter. “Wash up and I'll open this bottle to have with.”
Upon opening the box, John was suddenly enveloped in a cloud of dust and dried leaves. Tea dust and leaves to be exact. Every single tea bag had been stripped of its filter paper pouch and was now just a sad heap of dried plant matter at the bottom of the box.
'Yeah, I kinda noticed that a while back,” John entoned, his voice silky and low.” It does things to me. Has for awhile, if I'm honest. Especially on you. ”
“Dr. Sawyer, tell me more about Dr. Watson's flatmate. He seems almost unreal, you know. I know he's insanely smart and all that, but he's so intense and all Mr. Darcey and broody. How are they even friends?”
John tilted his face up to touch his lips gently to Sherlock's. Sherlock leaned into the touch and responded with a slide of his hands into the short blonde strands of John's hair and a soft, rapturous moan into his mouth. They kissed just for the pleasure of feeling their bodies close and warm for a few languorous moments.
It had been a few weeks and he was back. The first appointment of the day, Seven fucking o’clock in the morning. John had been irritated to have the early shift that morning, but what can you do? Same complaints, but now with a definite edge to them and to the patient. John watched the man for a few moments as he took notes.
Hmm. Had he put on some weight? The front of the garment didn't seem to cross as much over his chest and middle as he remembered.
Sherlock's heart raced frantically. He may have whined a bit plaintively before he could cover his eager expression.
Sherlock was playing the dutiful son - albeit in a mad scientist sort of way, but nevertheless, a boy looking after his mother.
With that, the young woman smiled knowingly at Sherlock. “My grandmother thanks you both for the enjoyment of reading your adventures and for Dr. Watson's attendance of her injury. She hopes you both will give this matter due consideration.” She turned and walked down the stairs, shutting the front door quietly behind her.
Sherlock vaulted over the arm of his chair and strode quickly to the bathroom. He snatched the bottle from the shelf in the shower and flipped open the lid and inhaled.
“Oh, I'm so sorry,” Hamish grabbed Sherlock's shoulders to steady him. “Are you alright? I was a little distracted there. I'm a bit unsteady today, I'm afraid.” He laughed self deprecatingly.
This is my third foray into the delightful Johnlock authorship, so my feet are still just getting damp. Believe me - I want to get soaked to the bone. Till next time, lovies! ;)
Unfortunately, he ALSO saw Hamish, creeping back into the clinic on a collision course with the raving, unstable man's line of sight. He tried to motion his palm downwards at Hamish to get him to stop and take cover, but Hamish just stood and looked at him blankly. Too late he realized what John was trying to say. Mr. Chamberlain was startled by the additional person suddenly looming there. He screamed at Hamish, going on about how, no one would listen, and that he wouldn't let them hurt him. His hands curled spastically into fists and he reached one into his trouser pocket.
involuntarily rocking his entire body into the man beneath him. Sherlock's obvious enthusiasm elicited a wicked chuckle from John.
Hamish? That was curious, seeing how that was John's name as well. Sherlock could make out a bit more of the conversation before “Hamish” rose to stand in the queue at the bakery counter. “Sugar", “Kensington”, “pensioners”, and “22 to 25 gauge needles” were words he caught that he could identify. “Hamish” was also being a bit handsy. Sherlock bristled at that.
Those long, flexible fingers that John had seen, just last night, being pulled into Sherlock's lush and hungry mouth and sucked and licked…
He shook his head to a bit, cleared his throat, which had gone a bit dry, and turned to the slyly smirking man on his left.
John grinned slowly. It was an evil sort of grin and it made Sherlock's hair stand on end. John slid the hand that had been tangled in curls down his neck and gently across the narrow expanse of Sherlock's clavicle towards his sternum.
“Tell you what. I'm starving and I know you are too. Dinner's on me, wherever you want to go,” Hamish countered. “Besides, it'll help you get your mind off of bad pussy.” Hamish could hardly contain his glee with that wretched line.
John took in a deep breath and slowly released it. It was something he employed quite frequently in Sherlock's company. It kept him from actions he might later regret against his flatmate; his messy murder or perhaps pushing him hard against one of the Victorian papered walls, crowding his body up against Sherlock's, pulling his face down to meet his, lips fleetingly touching…
John spotted Sarah later on as she was entering some notes into the computer system. He could see Hamish at the end of the hallway, laughing with one of the older patients as she was leaving.
“Y-yours, John?” Sherlock adorably stammered again. John rather liked him like this. He'd have to remember this tactic.
“Thanks for the cream, mate,” John chirped over the edge of the folded paper. “Really hit the spot.”
It wasn't a quiet night at 221B. It rarely was anymore. Mrs. Hudson had sound-dampening insulation put in as a Christmas gift to all of the Baker Street inhabitants. Sleep was had eventually and dreams were usually good ones.
John headed into the clinic that morning just as he had countless mornings before. He endured the usual hustle and bustle in the Tube, a bit of spilled coffee on his coat as he plodded his way up the stairs, and then the short walk up to the clinic doors. There was a bit more chaos than the norm at the front waiting area today as he breezed by, but it was rather trial by fire here for new front desk personnel. Kill or be killed, keep order with the waiting queue, or be trampled by the masses. John somewhat uncharitably reflected that he was glad he got the crowd one at a time, in a timely fashion, instead of the lemming-like onslaught in which they arrived.
Sherlock was nearly non-verbal with confusion. His mouth had dropped open and had stayed there. It was such a delicious looking mouth too, John distractedly mused.
Sherlock was almost glad John had rushed away. The feel of his strong, competant hands on him, even innocently, was almost too intense. Almost. In his own defense, innocence could be debated at the end there perhaps. John had slowed the massaging to a virtual crawl until his hands had just rested warmly on the sensitive tops of Sherlock's thighs, fingers caressing them softly. He had mentally pleaded with John to trail his hands up just a little bit higher and then bring them together to meet each other right over the growing tightness in his trousers...
Sherlock rummaged carefully in the messenger bag and pulled out John's stethoscope. Sarah's face immediately changed. She look relieved and immensely pleased.
Sherlock shifted on the sofa onto his side, head supported by a hand in those thick, luxurious curls. He really shouldn't have. It was sort of gilding the lily in that position. John groaned quietly to himself.
“Alright, fine. The groom.” John walked to the table in front of the sofa and carefully sat on the flat surface. He tried to objectively view the gorgeous man all but artfully posed in front of him.
He was walking through the door of the restaurant when he got a text. He started to open it when the hostess greeted him and he asked for the direction to the bar. She pointed him the way and he glanced down to read the screen. It was from Hamish.
John keened long and low as Sherlock rubbed a circle onto his exposed cock with his flat stomach. Sherlock peeled back, eager to see and touch for himself.
Sherlock pulled John into a fierce embrace. He took his turn lifting his head towards the stars before meeting John's dark, colour-rimmed eyes.
Sherlock smirked, though the effect was slightly ruined by his kiss-swollen lips and look of lust-haze about him.
That irked Sherlock. There weren't any scissors in that ridiculous board game - only a dagger. John wouldn't care though. Details be damned. That was the Watson Way.
“Ah, of course. She is a reader of his blog so she knows about my experiments and therefore, those items must have been intended for my use, so quite obviously, he would not notice an addition to them. Clever. “
Sherlock peeled himself up and planted his hands on John's shoulders. He leaned in to nip at John's earlobe and fleetingly drew it into his mouth for a quick suck. John's head thunked back against the wall bonelessly.
“I know JOHN is busy now, but would Sarah, I mean, DR. SAWYER, be free for just a moment? I just have something brief I need to discuss with her.”
John wasn't fooled for an instant, but he was enjoying this little game too much already to abandon it just yet. With Sherlock self-governing his own arms, John leaned closer, hovered his mouth whisper-close to those finely wrought cheekbones.
Hadn't John come in to check on him when he got home? He felt as though he vaguely remembered hearing him crash about a bit before retiring. He had wanted to tell John to stop disturbing him but then felt a brief pang of guilt at recalling waking up with a blanket around him that he hadn't procured himself. John must have kindly put it on him. He really had gotten it tangled around himself as well - he had managed to wrap it around his chest and legs in such a way that it had partially pulled his pajamas right off of him and rucked his sleep shirt up into his armpits.
“Thank you, Dr. Sawyer. I do appreciate your efforts on my behalf, ” Sherlock honestly intoned. “I apologise for adding to your strenuous day. Your nurse had indicated that  it had been a particularly arduous one thus far.”
John tore across the street, nearly got himself mown down by a bus and two taxis, their horns blaring angrily. Sherlock's head whipped up at the cacophony and spotted John barrelling towards him. The outright panic was written all over Sherlock's face, but John staunchly pressed on, closing in on him.
He breathed in deeply and attempted to stretch a bit when he realized his legs were a bit tangled up. With another pair of legs.
Sherlock cried out this time shamelessly and loud enough to elicit comment from Mrs. Hudson later. He flung his now free-range arms across the backs of John's shoulder blades and grappled him closer.
“I've had the most peculiar dreams of late, John. I do believe a picnic was the feature in one I experienced last night,” Sherlock started monologuing then stopped abruptly.
had to be the one to bridge the gap, to stop acting like a blind, scared idiot. I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I can say that now. Say that to you, and mean it so much. Please forgive everything it took to get me here. But I'm here now and I hope you can be too.”
A movement caught his eye across the street. A tall, familiar shadow stalked away from a newsagent's. The figure ripped open the small package gripped in both hands and was fumbling with a pack of matches.
A weird sense of premonition swept over John, not unlike the certainty he used to feel right before a bomb raid. In his mind's eye, he almost saw the Swiss Army knife before the agitated man pulled it from his pocket and flicked it open to the largest blade.
John could detect a brief snatch of Hamish’s cologne as the man pulled back. It was dark and earthy, yet with a powdery finish. He could almost taste it slightly on the roof of his mouth. Sherlock never wore anything as aggressively scented like that. His tastes ran more subtle in that arena (perhaps the only area he was less than blazingly upfront). He favored light, spicy, slightly smoky, or musk inspired scents for himself. John found himself reflexively breathing in deeply to catch a whiff of Sherlock's familiar smell and felt a brief pang of disappointment at its absence.
Without an observation window between them, the creature is free to track Sherlock with its eyes. Without speakers to buffer the sound, its deep growls penetrate Sherlock’s very soul. In that moment, with only metal bars between them, Sherlock is incredibly grateful for the gun in his pocket and the silver knife at his ankle.
her to puke all over your shoes?” Sherlock countered, slipping in after John and locking the door behind them.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “With my not inconsiderable powers of deduction I have come to the conclusion that you wish for me to take part in combat training.” His words are snooty but he looks interested, so John simply smiles.
“We’re still a mile out,” John argues, voice rough. His eyes are sad but his jaw is determined and it turns Sherlock’s stomach.
“Her suitcase and clothes are gone and she took our emergency cash,” he says plaintively, and John feels a pang of sympathy for the man. “She’s run off with Ray, I’m sure of it, but I just want to know she’s okay.”
“I missed you, too.” She looked down at their clasped hands, a sweet pang in her chest. “Every time I was bored, I’d imagine you there, deducing everyone and berating the speakers.” She laughed.
Bewildered, Amberley nods. “Yes. Some of the paintings are very valuable. They’re stored in the strongroom.”
Sherlock had hummed, giving her bare waist an appreciative squeeze before whirling away. “Don’t dawdle!”
“Oh, honestly. He took her purse but left the jewelry, so what did he want? What’s missing from the body? You said it yourself – her I.D.”
. It’s two thirty and he wonders if he should follow the spirit or the letter of John’s earlier request. Granted, they’ve had several all-nighters in the past week, so it’s no wonder John was grumpy and unwilling to correct Sherlock’s faux pas. If he’s careful, Sherlock reckons he can slip into bed without waking his partner up.
“All you had to do was text Mycroft or Mina. You could have hidden the keys somewhere – either one of them could have come and let me out.” He pushes off the wall, stalking towards him. He’s stopped short by the chains pinning him to the wall, like a dog caught by its leash. “I respected your neurotic need for control and secrecy, I didn’t give anyone else a key, didn’t tell your brother about this place, though I’m sure he knows about it.” He jerks against the chains, teeth bared. The keys rattle in Sherlock’s shaking hand. “I put myself in your hands and you can’t even commit to me for one night!”
The next time he slams into the door, he stumbles as one of the hinges gives way, the door groaning loudly and bending. With renewed desperation, he shoves and pushes until there is a gap large enough to slip through, then forces his way out into the open. He’s nearly hyperventilating as Sherlock follows suit, pale and wide-eyed.
“You’ve been doing some house renovations, Mr. Amberley?” Sherlock asks and John peers at the client more closely, trying to see what Sherlock noticed. There must be a splotch of paint on his clothes somewhere.
