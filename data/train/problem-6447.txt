“A.. ball?” he surmised, and took Mrs Dugan’s excited squeal as confirmation he was correct.
He was glowing.
“Other than me losing everything I’ve ever had, you mean, my lord? What could possibly be worse than that?” he asked, bitterness colouring his voice.
“Congratulations, my lord,” Tony said, after a few moments of awkward silence. “You’ve accomplished quite a feat today.”
“I missed you, all morning,” he said, finally. Tony turned to look at him, a frown marring his handsome features.
If Jarvis knew the extent of Tony’s service to the man he’d have an apoplexy.
He was standing beside the bed, in the nude, one foot on the bed, while the other stood firmly on the floor. He was half turned, and his hand was reaching behind him, to the tempting soft curve of his buttocks, where his fingers disappeared inside his hungry hole. His eyes were shut, fluttering, and he was biting down on his lip as if to keep himself from letting out soft cries of pleasure.
Steve’s fists clenched, remembering the taste of those very lips on his own just hours ago. What was Stark doing, flirting shamelessly with a lady of Steve’s acquaintance? And in front of an audience, no less?
They chatted in a genial manner for a little while. Mr Coulson was eager to hear some of Steve’s war stories, while Steve found himself asking about the church’s charitable efforts in the area. He was deeply affected when he learned of the shelter Mr Coulson was running, a safe haven for widows and unwed mothers. As the child of a widow, Steve was very aware of their struggle, and he could only imagine how much harder his mother’s life -and consequently his own- would have been had she and his father not been married before his death. It was an admirable cause, and he readily expressed interest in giving his patronage to the place.
“What
He felt a hand grabbing at the back of his head. Relaxing his mouth, he let himself be completely at Steve’s control just as Steve started bucking his hips, fucking his dick deeper into Tony’s willing throat.
“I,” he began, unable to form words. Steve raised a -rather dashing, if somewhat questioning- brow at him.
I really hope you guys enjoyed it. Please let me know your thoughts.
“That little miscreant!”
Maybe Steve was finally finding it in him to forgive Tony? Maybe he was leaving behind the picture he’d constructed of Tony as an amoral libertine, unworthy of the respect of men better than him, and was willing to get to know him once more?
now, really- hunting dogs while the young lad charged with their care watched from the sidelines, occasionally bursting into laughter when one of the dogs would playfully bite at Sir Barton’s backside.
“Thank you, my lord. A nice contraption, isn’t it? It needs but the barest amount of effort to lift a full bucket of water. Even a child as young as five could do it.”
?” he replied, trying to keep his tone casual. Instead of sitting down, he planted his feet on the floor, refusing to obey orders from someone
Anything to keep Tony safely away from that horrible man.
If anything Steve should be the one to be pitied. To have loved someone so deeply, to have been brokenhearted for so long only to finally learn that he had fallen for a traitor, a liar and now a whore. He steeled himself before he turned and sure enough, there was Anthony Stark, his
“From my recollection, Lord Howard was a fairly generous man,” he said. After all, it was the elder Lord Stark that had paid for Steve’s army commission. Even though he had always seemed distant and aloof, and Tony had always complained about his father ‘not being fair’, Lord Howard had always seemed like an average man of the peerage to Steve.
“Yes, well… let us see those samples you’ve brought us, Mr Smith.”
Tony’s cheeks reddened at that. Not giving him time to splutter an excuse, Steve turned to the actual contractor with newfound determination.
Tony secretly feared that Barnes’ coldness was due to him being privy to more of Steve’s secrets than the rest of their group of friends. It made him wonder which of Steve’s and his secrets Barnes knew. Was it the past? Or the even more humiliating present? His always careful -almost clinical- inspection of Tony every morning at the breakfast table certainly was telling enough. The thought of Steve discussing such things with Barnes… well, it wasn’t a pleasurable thought, that was certain.
When Tony came back around, the doctor and nurses had gone and only Steve remained at his side. He was trying to hide his own sobs as he tucked a nice, warm blanket around Tony. Tony blinked up as his fiancé and reached up to grab his hand. Steve quickly saw that Tony was awake and took his hand while returning to the seat at his side. He brought Tony’s hand up to his lips and kissed the knuckles. Despite the situation, kisses from Steve never failed to make Tony’s heart flutter.
“Be careful Tony. We don’t know if Doom has hidden anything around the area. We just took out the last bot. We’ll be at your location in five minutes after we scout the area.” Replied Steve, his voice sounded worried but this was all part of the job.
“Not just your brain. You’ve got a great ass too.” Joked back, Steve. It was nice to fall back into their normal teasing banter after so long in medical.
“Tony, you’re not useless. You’re injured.”
“Hey, Tony. is everything alright?” asked Steve as he opened the door and got a good look at Tony’s exhausted face.
“Steve, of fuck. I’m gonna cum.” Whined Tony and Steve bent down and bit gently at his neck before whispering in his ear.
Steve couldn’t wait to marry him.
Fury didn’t get his report that night. He got it the next afternoon. Steve and Tony had more important things to deal with that night.
The jet sped off back to the tower the second Bruce had Tony securely started down to the tiny medical bed they had there. He was still loosely holding Steve’s hands and was beginning to nod off. Tony’s voice was slurred and It was a battle to keep him awake.
Some had to do with the fact that, mentally, in his first months of service, he’d been in a fairly dark place. He had dared to imagine a life with Tony Stark, and to have that taken from him - and in such cruel a manner, too - it had been a hard blow to take.
Hey, guys... I'm back!
Steve always thought that vegetable gardens had a special, useful kind of beauty. To someone who had experienced hunger, a place that grew food when properly tended was almost magical. It had been one of Steve’s favourite chores, back when he was still working for the Starks, to help Anna tend to her vegetable garden.
“... I can’t ask Steve to have him
Steve had never before felt hunger like he felt for this man. He’d always taken pride in the strength of his willpower, but there was no way even the strongest of men could resist this.
Some of it, though, was just that war hit Steve hard. It had been a difficult lesson for someone of Steve’s persistent character to learn that there were things he couldn’t control, people he couldn’t save and battles he couldn’t win, no matter how valiantly he fought.
Her eyes widened in shock. “Do you actually listen to yourself? Who are you and what have you done to my friend Steve Rogers? He would never have stood for such behaviour!” she asked, her voice devoid of mirth.
What Tony didn’t understand was why Steve Rogers kept hanging around him. It had been months since the Avengers had settled into life at the tower and they’d gone on a few missions together but that didn’t explain why Rogers would come down to his lab armed with snacks and ask him all sorts of questions about his tech.
Nobody was really surprised when Steve offered to be the one to return the stones to their places in the timeline. Hank Pym had been gracious in offering up some Pym Particles for the trip. More than enough for if Steve made a mistake and had to backtrack. Bruce, Scott, and Rocket had managed to get Tony’s time machine rebuilt and running so all Steve needed to do was return the stones without issue.
“I’m just happy. I didn’t think I could ever be this happy. I’m glad I have you, Tony. You make me happy. I’m happy I get to spend the rest of my life with you.
So with the wedding colours sorted, it came down to the nit-picky things. Tony actually asked Pepper to help them figure out everything. She was the queen of planning and organization and was more than happy to help out.
To say that Tony was distressed at the news was an understatement. Losing an eye was a big deal. This was not only major surgery but also a major life change. So not only was Tony not feeling well, but he was also panicking at the thought of surgery. Tony had had surgery a few times now. He hated it. The uncertainty made him feel faint.
“Hey, you’re up. You should have said something Tony.” smiled Steve once he spotted that Tony was up. He walked over with Harley in his arms. That was when Tony started to feel nervous.
“Make sure that you wash your hands and put on a mask before you go into his room. Mr. Stark is in a delicate condition and we don’t want to introduce any kind of infection.”
Natasha sat off to the side and got out her phone to pass the time. She knew that Tony would be in surgery for a long time if he were to survive this. Although they may have had a very rocky start, Tony and Natasha had grown close over the years. She really hoped that one of her best friends wasn’t dead on the operating table. Natasha also posted the situation to the Avengers' Twitter account. They had some PR rules that had to follow since they became a full-on organization and keeping the public informed on importing happenings was one of them. This was what the post read.
It took a little bit of pressing, but eventually Tony told Steve why he thought the things he did and why he was the way he way. The stories Tony told painted a horrific picture of abuse and gaslighting done by some of the people Tony was closest to. Steve’s heart broke as he listened. He let Tony pour his heart out while he offered his support.
The second Steve was done prepping Tony, Tony had flipped them around so that Steve was laying down and Tony was on top of him. Tony sent Steve a sly smile before he was sinking down onto Steve’s considerable length.
“Cap? What was Tony’s last name?” asked Bruce skeptically.
So, Tony decided to let his actions speak louder than his words. He reached out and took Steve’s hand in his and just held it. He was still nervous and completely unsure of himself, but Tony wasn’t fool enough to pass up the opportunity to hold Steve’s hand.
“I should be the one asking you that. You make everything better Tony. You make it all worthwhile.”
As the night wound down and their friends went off to bed, it was time for Tony and Steve to leave for their honeymoon. They were heading to a private island Tony owned. They had been there a few times with the team just to vacation, but this time, it was just them. They had packed their bags and loaded them onto the jet earlier so they didn’t have to worry about forgetting anything as they said goodbye to their friends and boarded the jet.
They had JARVIS take the controls and the two cuddled up together for the flight. There was some light kissing but nothing more. They wanted to save the main event for when they arrived at their destination.
“I know you’re scared. I am too. But you’ll be alright baby.”
Tony road Steve long and hard. He managed to draw two orgasms out of Steve before he finished himself. By the end, Tony felt like he was floating on a cloud while Steve cleaned them up and they curled up under the covers.
Mr Coulson’s smile grew larger. “A very warm welcome back, then, my lord.”
Steve’s utter desperation when faced with Tony’s cruel rejection still haunted Tony to this day. He had never seen such dejection, such utter desolate disappointment and sadness in any man ever before, or since.
“Your win, yet again,” Bucky exclaimed, laying the white king down to Steve’s bishop.
After introductions and a short tour of the place, Steve found himself walking through the cottage’s vegetable garden in the company of Mr Coulson, while the rest of his company had scattered to explore the grounds.
“Have you heard about the ball?” he asked.
It took a moment for it to register. Did Steve just…?
The first woman, as if unwilling to be surpassed, hurried to add, “Well,
mistress
Steve had been too preoccupied with musing over Fury’s letter to realise how late it was, certainly later than the usual time Tony made his appearance, until he heard the muted sound of a cry, followed by the muffled thump of something falling. Remembering Tony’s earlier injury, he didn’t hesitate, jumping to his feet and making his way through the adjoining study to Tony’s room, scared of what he might find there.
obsession with love.”
He raked his mind trying to figure out what it could be.
When he was packing his meagre belongings to leave for the war front, Steve had left behind everything that he associated with Tony, anything that would remind him of the man who broke his heart. Everything but that wooden box.
His heart, that damn traitorous heart of his is starting to beat too fast again, too erratically. He can’t do anything but pray it doesn’t fail him, pray he doesn’t end up dead right
that Stark works for him.”
“Steve…” he started, breath catching as Steve’s hands shot to his waist. He didn’t get a chance to finish. Steve was quick to claim Tony’s lips with his own, demanding entrance to his mouth with a probing tongue. Tony could only grant his wish with a contented sigh, forgetting all previous protest.
an invitation. He felt so foolish, now, for ever entertaining the thought.
Steve nodded, satisfied.
Still facing away from the door, towards the lavishly- almost
Tony could see himself in Peter, he always had. He was as impulsive as Tony had been at his age, and just as bright. They even looked like they could be related too, with their dark curly hair and almond-shaped eyes. It had caused quite a bit of a gossip at the village some years ago, when Peter had first arrived with his aunt. People had claimed he was Tony’s illegitimate heir, invited there to be raised as a Stark. Thankfully, May had cleared things up quickly.
“As you wish, my lord,” he replied coldly and turned away, heading back down the trail they’d just come from.
From the first night they spent together, Steve was constantly aware of Tony. Always so close to him and so far away at the same time. His siren call was ever persistent and Steve often found himself drawn to its melody, his heart beating to its strange rhythm.
Steve withdrew to his rooms earlier than usual. Locking himself in his study, Steve sat at the desk, having made up his mind to make his own inquiries on the matter. He knew exactly who to contact, too.
The ladies of the company giggled.
, it can’t be helping, for either of you! It’s not healthy,” he finished, panting. He was pleading with Steve to understand him.
“It’s for Lord Stone, my lord. He asked for tea to be served in his rooms,” Jarvis explained. A hint of irritation coloured his normally impassive voice. It would seem that even the cool and collected Jarvis wasn’t overly fond of this particular guest and Steve couldn’t agree more.
” leaving his lips as he came, and Tony was utterly lost.
Of course, that would probably also hurt Tony’s already battered reputation as much as it would Stone’s, if not more so. So Steve really needed to avoid that. In a few more hours, the deal would be signed and after that, it would be only a few days before he would be gone.
That meant that unfortunately, this story was far from a priority. But I promise all of you, I will definitely finish this story. It might take some time, and the next two months the updates will most likely be scarce, but I will not abandon this fic.
Tony’s interest was piqued.
Steve lowered his head.
“I owe you nothing”, he says to Tony, his voice low now, almost intimate, still broken beyond repair. “And you are nothing to me. Thank you for curing me of my
for imported marble? At this day and age, with this economy? It’s absurd! Anyway, what is wrong with using a local stone?” he exclaimed rather dramatically. He saw Steve roll his eyes at Tony’s antics.
That would have to do for now. Steve knew not to expect anything else from a man as proud and conceited as Tiberius Stone.
“Ahem,” he cleared his throat, forcing the two apart. He glared at the bewilderment written on both of their faces.
Natalia huffed in disbelief. “Unseemly? Ha! You are unbelievable.”
I'm back! And this time, it didn't take me six whole months to finish one damned chapter! YAY!!!🥳🥳🥳
Some things are best kept secret.
It was one thing for him to admit to himself that he had behaved shamefully towards Tony; it was an entirely different matter for a man such as Stone to be rubbing Steve’s own failings in his face.
“See? Now you’re thinking. Ha, I’m always right, boy,” Tony laughed, bringing his hand to playfully flick at Peter’s nose. It left them both giggling, mood lighter than before.
Steve, of course, had dressed accordingly, ever the military man, while Tony had only donned a light riding coat on his way to the stables, perhaps subconsciously refusing to leave behind the summer for the dreary autumn, just like his stubborn heart refused to let Steve go, while Steve had long ago grown out of his love with him.
“Argh!” Tony yelped. Peter rushed to help him get up, while Steve ran to the scene.
my lord,
Tony wasn’t sure if it was the absence of other company that drove Steve to seek him out more and more during the day. Be it loneliness or perhaps nostalgia for their forgotten childhood friendship, these past few days Steve had definitely mellowed his ways where Tony was concerned.
“Oh, I am sure it would be a terrible bother, Beatrice,” Sharon said, shyly, and not at all helpful.
Mood sober once again, Tony felt haunted by things he could never speak of.
“An excellent shot, my lord,” the man, Hogan, said, panting as he made his way to Steve. He was holding the rest of their game, another duck and a pheasant, as well as the rest of Steve’s gear. Steve hummed in agreement.
Through the gaps in the forest, he could just make out the ruins of the old chapel that marked the property’s west border. Tony loved that small clearing. He used to spend hours playing amongst those very ruins as a child, most of them with Steve as his companion.
They had wandered off the path towards a small patch of woods, seeking cover from the midday heat under the cool shade of the trees.
Sensing his master was done with him, Jarvis spoke up. “Indeed, my lord. I shall speak to the cook and arrange for provisions. I will also inform Miss Potts the guest rooms are to be readied.”
“I don’t understand what…” Tony started, his tone flippant. He seemed determined to refuse to acknowledge that anything had been amiss. It rattled Steve to his core, how Tony replied while avoiding his eyes, and how he’d automatically exuded an air of aloofness that would have fooled him once, but now he could clearly recognize it as a mask.
It was only then, in the darkest hour of the night, after having spent hours basking in the pleasure of Tony’s body, that Steve finally allowed himself to admit he may have been blindsided by his tempestuous feelings for the man, after all.
Stone huffed. “Or else what?” he asked, laughing at the fury written on Steve’s face. “As if I would want anything to do with him, Rogers. He’s spoiled goods. No better than a
Little drawings of Tony that Steve had drawn and couldn’t throw away, most of them made during moments of weakness when Steve, being at the war front, thought he wouldn’t live to see another day and ached to just see Tony’s face one last time.
“I am listening, my lord,” Jarvis replied, stoically, though Steve thought he detected disapproval in the older man’s features.
'Good, he should be', Steve thought.
Now, this chapter comes with an update to the tags and the added warning of a very brief mention of past attempted noncon, definitely not between Tony and Steve.
Things were getting better. After that first night, when Tony’s quiet resolve and ever-burning desire for Steve had been the only things keeping him from completely falling apart when faced with Steve’s icy words and his endless hunger for Tony’s body, Steve had become calmer, almost careful in his treatment of Tony. If Tony was one to fool himself he would say Steve was starting to forget his resentment for him, his love for his lost wife, and was once more developing those dangerous feelings he had long past left behind.
written on that letter?
“Well, I heard from my cousin -he works for the butcher, as you know and he was at and has been on the estate just yesterday- that the
“It’s
Steve felt a burning rage upon hearing Stone speaking so flippantly about the things that he held so dear, of all his efforts to keep the Stark estate from ruin. At the same time, he knew that Stone raised a very true point. Too much was at stake over this deal.
let your best friend walk out of your life,” he finished with an encouraging nod.
Stark Manor was as splendid as the last time Steve had seen it, a lifetime ago. Of course, back then there was little chance that he'd end up invited at one of their dinner parties, let alone be the host.
Steve thought, dazed.
Minutes passed and they were both still panting, Steve seated on his chair with Tony kneeling between his parted legs, resting a tired forehead on Steve’s inner thigh. Tony wished he didn’t ever have to move. He dosed off.
. Please check it out and enjoy the chapter! -Shadows
Tony was having a bad day. He was no stranger to bad days, but he’d been having a lot of them since the accident. Tony was about to have the bandages taken off of his face and neck for good. And while Tony was excited about the prospect of no longer looking like a mummy, the thought of showing his eyeless face and scared up neck to the world filled Tony with dread.
Tony lifted his left hand a bit to feel at his neck. There was a hard case around it. A neck brace! There were also bandages all over his right eye. That must be why he couldn’t open it.
Steve pretty much barged into Tony’s lab and plonked down on the sofa and just sat there learning.
But even so, Tony was still nervous.
“Deal.”
“You’ve got this Tones. Just be yourself and hope that Steve can accurately translate your sass.” Encouraged Rhodey and Tony smiled. No matter what happened, Tony knew that the team would have his back. It had taken him a long time to learn that, but he knew now. The Avengers were his family.
When Tony was called to SHIELD when Loki stole their glowing cube and mind fucked a whole bunch of agents, Tony wasn’t expecting what happened to happen. He was expecting to be yelled at by various agents, Fury very much included. He was expecting to do some pretty neat science with Dr. Bruce Banner who Tony very much wanted to be friends with. He was expecting to feel like shit every time he was in a room with Captain America because of the way his father used to use the ma against Tony when he still alive.
To say Tony was pissed when he was brought back to the compound and told he needed surgery was an understatement.
“Well, you sure know how to treat a man.” Smiled Tony as Steve took him by the arm and the two walked in and took their seats.
Steve pulled Tony into his arms and smiled when Tony smiled up at him. He loved holding Tony and Tony loved being held. They fit perfectly together. They really were made for each other.
Steve left Tony there to sleep off his injury for a little bit. He deserved some rest. In the meantime, Steve had to sort out his own emotions so that he could figure out a way to best show Tony that he cared.
“I… I never thought… I didn’t think… I thought I was all alone…” stuttered Tony his voice barely rising more than a whisper.
Sam turned around and saw what Bucky did. And Sam, being a smart man, knew exactly what had happened. The two walked together towards the lake and the log bench nearby where the figure sat. As they got closer, Bucky stopped walking and encouraged Sam to go talk to the man. So, Sam pressed forward and got his first good look at the figure. Although age had marred his features it was undeniably Steve sitting there by the lake.
But the thing was, after Tony’s heat broke and he’d passed out from exhaustion, Steve didn’t leave. When Tony woke up the Alpha was there with water and snacks. Naturally, Tony thanked him and the two parted ways a few hours after that.
Steve trudged through the funeral and Tony’s last message. There were tears in his eyes as he watched the hologram of Tony say goodbye to his daughter. He hated that Morgan would grow up without her father. He hated that Peter had to lose another father figure. He hated that Pepper was a widow and that Rhodey and Happy had lost a brother. He hated that the Avengers were hurting from losing Natasha and Tony.
“It’ll be touch and go for a while, but for now he’s stable. Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rhodes, if you’d like to follow me. As Mr. Stark’s medical proxies we have some more information for you.”
Towards the end of their meal, while the two lovers were sharing some gelato, Tony felt a hand snaking across his thigh. A shiver ran down his spine and Tony very quickly realized that they should probably get going before either of them got charged with public indecency. Tony didn’t think that the media would take too kindly to Tony being defiled by an all-American icon.
Tony didn’t like thinking of those moments.
Another short one here guys. School is ramping up and that’s my priority. But it’s still a good one so at least there’s that. I hope you enjoy this one. Don’t forget to drop a comment if you want to. -Shadows
And so Steve dug. He dug and dug and asked JARVIS all sorts of questions and he quickly learned that Tony was so much more than the media painted him as. He learned that Tony and Howard didn’t get along and from certain pictures and interviews Steve pieced together that Tony didn’t have a very happy childhood. He regretted ever trying to compare Tony to his late father pretty quickly.
Three weeks after sharing his heat with Steve, Tony started to feel sick. He was throwing up often and he felt dizzy. That… that wasn’t good. Initially Tony just thought it was a stomach bug or food poisoning from Clint’s cooking. But when it didn’t go away Tony knew that there was a problem.
Tony melted into the kiss and moved around a bit to get comfortable. It felt so good to be back home. He’d missed moments like this. Moments where the pain seemed to melt away and all that remained was Steve and the love he gave him. Moments where everything was alright and nothing more could hurt him.
Steve just smiled and hissed his forehead. He knew that Tony didn’t really handle pain well so he excused his grouchiness.
“You’re just saying that.” mumbled Tony as he tried to hide in Steve’s arms.
As the pain meds did their job Tony began to feel a little bit better and was in a better frame of mind to listen to the doctor.
“And returning in 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.”
“Maybe I’ll just have to wrap you up in bubble wrap.” Smirked Steve before his eyes went dark. “Or maybe I could just keep you in bed forever. Keep you here and happy and full of me.”
“What’s on your mind?” asked Steve as he saw Tony’s hands fidgeting. Tony also wasn’t looking at him and that was a huge red flag that something was wrong. The nervous energy that permeated the room was also a big giveaway.
Tony signed back.
One of the things that Tony had always clung too even in his darkest moments, was that he was attractive. Tony Stark always knew that he was attractive, and not in a self-obsessed way. Tony’s looks were often one of the only things Tony got genuinely nice compliments on. His looks were what the public liked. Hell, he’d even gotten sexiest man alive two years in a row.
The day after Tony’s little realization, he was introduced to a therapist named Josie McClaire. She was an expert in long-term trauma and also happened to be fluent in ASL. That was a huge plus. Hopefully now Tony could start to figure out how to cope with the aftermath of everything. From his first kidnapping to losing his eye and voice, Tony had a lot to unpack.
“I’m not leaving you, Tony. I love you so much. You mean everything to me. I’m not letting you go. You’re amazing Tony. You’re so good. You’re going to be an amazing parent. He’s yours, Tony. I gave him your last name you know.” Spoke Steve as he held Tony in his arms. Tony looked up at Steve incredulously and Steve leant down to kiss his forehead.
“Tony?” worried Steve and Tony shook his head.
By the end of Tony’s little tirade, he was shaking like a leaf while a steady stream of tears fell from his eye. Steve instantly held Tony closer and rested his head against Tony’s He hated seeing the love of his life so sad.
Everything went smoothly that day until one of the bombs went off even after tony had disabled it. Thank fuck no hostages were near.
While they laid there, Tony got to thinking. He trusted Steve. Trusted him with his life. Steve was smart and sweet and a damn good Alpha. He trusted him. And if what Steve said was true, then Tony knew he could trust Steve with some of his darkest secrets. What’s the worst that could happen?
“Ow… everything hurts.” Complained Tony as his eyes scrunched up in pain. His chest was on fire.
And that’s when it happened. Steve, who had removed his gloves a few moments ago, lifted his right hand to brush off Tony’s left. Exactly where their skin touched lit up in beautiful rainbows. But with everyone arguing, nobody seemed to notice. Well, nobody except Tony.
Tony had a long road of recovery ahead of him. He was lucky to have Steve at his side and amazing friends who had his back. When Tony was a kid he never thought that he’d have anything resembling a family of his own. He thought he’d be alone forever.
“Harley?” asked Tony and Steve smiled sadly at him.
Because of Tony’s past history, Steve was allowed to stay with Tony the next morning when they were putting Tony under. That morning was stressful. Neither of them was really dealing with the situation very well, but Steve put on a brave face for Tony.
“Sweetheart? Are you alright?” worried Steve as he sat next to Tony. Tony had his eyes screwed shut as he tried to breathe through the contraction.
“Come on sweetheart, let’s get going.”
It was finally happening.
“Congratulations! It’s a baby boy!” announced the ultrasound technician and Tony watched as Steve cheered and cried over the fact that he was going to have a healthy son. Tony knew that Steve had been worried that the baby would pick up all his old ailments and illnesses, but so far the baby was perfectly healthy.
Tony just nodded and allowed himself to be lead out of the lab. Cuddles and a nap did sound nice.
It was silent for a few moments as Steve held Tony in his arms. The silence stretched on for eons as the two sat there. The only sounds were the beeping of various machines and baby Harley snoring away in his cot. The entire time Tony just laid there in Steve’s arms and allowed himself a moment of comfort.
“Is this OUR broken femur? No! It’s mine and I’ll be a fucking baby about it if I want.” Panted out Tony as Bruce went about splinting his leg. Tony was in so much pain that he didn’t even register that he had Steve’s hand in a vice grip.
The second Tony and Steve set their suitcases down in their room, their hands were all over each other. They were kissing like mad as Steve lead Tony over to the bed. He sat down on the edge and pulled Tony into his lap. Tony couldn’t help but grind down on his husband.
“Than cum. Cum for me baby.”
Because Tony was only just beginning to wake up and was drugged to the gills, he was only allowed one visitor at the moment. Steve was pretty happy when the team decided that he should go check in on Tony. He was worried sick and he had a feeling seeing that Tony was alive would help. So, Steve allowed himself to be lead back to Tony’s room where he saw the genus laying in the bed.
And that should have been the end of it. Steve would go back to tolerating Tony and Tony would go back to not socializing with the team and hiding in his lab. Steve had only offered to help because he wanted to be a gentleman anyway. And sure, very frequently, Steve would take Tony out for dinner or a movie (and often kiss his cheeks), but he was just being nice. Tony could have said no and that would have been the end of it.
“No Tony, I’m not. I thought you knew that. We’ve… we’ve been going out on dates for months. I’ve kissed you awake every morning. You’re everything to me Sweet thing.”
That hope was what kept him going through Afghanistan, through becoming Iron Man, through Stane and his betrayal, through the palladium poisoning. It kept him alive. The hope that maybe, just maybe, there was somebody out there for him. If Tony ever let go of that hope, he knew he wouldn’t make it.
“J, put me on a private line to Steve.” Spoke Tony, his voice oddly level for what he was about to do.
“Try it on.” Smiled Steve and Sam looked on apprehensively. He wasn’t Captain America and yet Steve was trying to give him the shield! He looked at Steve and hesitated. He didn’t know if this was the right thing to do. Sam looked back at where Bucky stood for any kind of confirmation. Bucky nodded so Sam took that as the go-ahead to put on the shield.
Steve took his sweet time opening Tony up. He drew out every little sound from Tony until his lover was pliant under his touch. Steve loved how submissive Tony often was for him. Tony had always liked being more submissive in bed. He just didn’t get to indulge in it as much. Not until he got with Steve.
Steve was a nervous wreck as the doctors and nurses took Tony off of the sedation. He just needed to know that Tony was alright and he was getting incredibly impatient. Surprisingly in their relationship, Tony was more patient than Steve was. Not by much though.
“Oh shit!”
Tony screamed and nearly passed out when the team helped move him onto a stretcher so that they could carry him to the jet and back to the tower. Clint went off ahead with half of the armour pieces to go bring the jet closer while Natasha took the other pieces with her. It was down to Steve and Bruce to carry Tony back to the jet and they had to move fast. Tony was in shock and honestly not doing great. The sooner they got him to medical the better.
“Dearly beloved,” began Sam with a smile to his friends, “We are gathered here today to witness the marriage between our dear friends Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Today, we watch as our friends, who have been through hardship after hardship, finally get a break to just be together. Now, Tony and Steve have decided to write their own vows so this makes my job easier,” the room snickered. “So, Steve, take it away.”
But, while things were on track for the wedding of the century, things weren’t so well when it came to Tony’s emotions.
So, with Tony’s permission, Steve posted the picture with the following caption.
“Worth it.”
As Tony entered his sixth month of pregnancy, his ever-growing discomfort and insecurity over the entire situation were not helped by Steve continuously waiting to figure out a name for his baby.
There was always talk about the baby. Baby this and baby that. Steve hardly ever shut up about the baby. He also had a hand on Tony’s ever-growing bump whenever he could. So, with the way Tony’s non-existent self-esteem worked, it was no wonder that Tony came to the wrong conclusion about what was going on.
“You’re staying here in medical Tony. I’m not going to let you hide in that lab of yours and inevitably hurt yourself. Pepper will understand if you can’t build things right now. And as for us, we can wait. You’ve made sure that we have enough gear.” Spoke Steve as he tried to coax Tony into understanding that he could take a break to heal.
“Tony, people are going to find out about your eye sooner or later. It’s better to just get it over with instead of having rumours spread.” Spoke Steve. Tony liked how Steve often just ripped off the band-aid when it came to sharing information.
“He’s not going to change his mind.” Huffed Rhodey as he pulled Tony to his side.
“I love you, Steve. So fucking much.” Smiled Tony as his eyes began to droop.
He made sure Tony knew he was loved because that’s what mattered most.
Tony stood there in shock. His hands were shaking and he was at a loss for words. All he could do was nod his head as a few start tears fell from his eyes. Steve smiled brightly as a few tears of his won formed. He slid the ring onto Tony’s finger and stood up to pull his now fiancé into his arms. The two instantly fell into a passionate kiss as Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and Steve’s hands rested on Tony’s waist.
“No. none of that. You are not old. If you’re old then what does that make me?” that got a small smile out of Tony. “And your scars? They’re proof that you’re alive and here in my arms. And I don’t care if you can’t speak anymore, you can still communicate. And all your trauma? It doesn’t faze me. Tony, you will never be able to scare me off. I love you so damn much. I wake up every day and know that life is worth living because you’re here with me. I look at you and all I see is my entire universe. I love you, Tony. I will always love you.”
The entire time they were all together, Steve couldn’t stop looking at Tony. Although all of his bandages had been removed and his scars were now visible to the world, he was still Steve’s Tony. Steve could tell that some of the others were a little bit unnerved by Tony’s lack of eye. Hell, even Steve was himself. Seeing scared skin pulled over the now packed and closed eye socket was unnerving. Steve didn’t blame anyone for being a bit unnerved. Just as long as they didn’t make Tony feel any more self-conscious of it than he already was.
“Look Cap, I’ll cut right to the chase because this is a big deal and I have absolutely no idea who you’ll respond.” started Tony as he picked at the skin around his nails.
This worried Steve. They were supposed to be a team on and off the field. Sure he knew that Tony was a busy man, but it seemed as if he were intentionally isolating himself from everyone else.
“I Hate Fucking Board Meeting!” announced Tony as he plopped down on the couch in his and Steve’s room. Steve was standing nearby in their little private kitchen making himself a cup of tea and a cup of coffee for Tony.
Three hours later, Tony began to take up.
Soon enough they were both naked and wanting. Steve pushed Tony down onto the bed and covered his husband with his body. They kissed each other senseless while they ground their bodies together. It was as if they were trying to become one body. One love. One life.
“Fuck, I love you so much.” Gasped Steve as his hands slid up to take Tony’s shirt off. Tony pressed the sign for I love you over Steve’s heart before the two methodically ripped their clothes off.
The two swayed back and forth to the music JARVIS played for them. As they danced arm in arm, Steve began to feel nervous. He had to stop himself from reaching into his pocket to check that the ring he’d picked out was still there. As they continued to dance, Steve knew it was time to ask. Tony was happy and in his arms, it was perfect.
Steve was probably just nice. Well, he was always nice. He hoped that Steve would find a nice Omega to settle down with after the baby was born. He deserved someone good. Someone who wasn’t Tony.
But Tony didn’t stir. He didn’t breathe. He was gone. And Steve, well he didn’t know what to do. He’d only just met his soulmate. Sure, they’d argued, but everyone in that room was arguing earlier. They should have had time to work things out. To get to know each other. They should have had more time. Tears fell from Steve’s eyes and he leant down and gave Tony a small kiss on the forehead. It was the only kiss he was ever going to get.
Three weeks and multiple appointments later, Steve came home with a massive sleeve covering the entirety of his left arm. The sleeve was populated with a bouquet of flowers. A large sunflower occupied the back of his hand and over his shoulder. Red roses and yellow daisies popped like sunbursts across his skin while sweet-peas and forget-me-nots filled in the spaces in between like a soothing balm. It was an amazing work of art. Steve had worked with his artist to design it and everyone absolutely loved it. Especially Tony.
signed Tony, his hands shaking as more tears fell.
Tony stood there in shock. He turned his hand around in front of him and marvel at the rainbows he never thought he’d ever get to see. His breathing sped up a little as he watched the colours grow over his thumb, pointer finger, and down towards his wrist. Time seemed to stand still and all Tony could focus on were the colours.
And it didn’t stop the top brass at SHIELD from sending a nuke towards New York.
They deserved this.
And Steve knew.
signed Tony as Steve helped him tie his tie. Tony had been having trouble with his depth perception since losing his eye and he needed the help.
“Hey, hey baby doll. Shh. Shh. It’s ok. Just stay still Tony. You’re safe. I’ve got you.” Soothed Steve and once Tony recognized the voice he sank back into the blankets around him. Steve was there! He’d make sure he was alright.
“Tony, you’ll be fine. So what if you have to sit out for a few months. At least you’re alive.” Spoke Steve as he sat next to Tony on his hospital bed while he was waiting for surgery.
They took separate cars to the club, touched base with the owner, who was a retired SHIELD agent and close friend of Fury’s and got ready for the night. Once they were in place, all they needed to do was wait for the HYDRA agents to show up so they could start gathering intel. They’d bugged the place earlier so hopefully, they’d get something. Plus, with Steve getting to check their ID’s they’d have some intel into names they were using.
Tony had a rough childhood. Howard Stark used to beat him, yell at him, and make him drink which lead to a drinking problem. Howard would always go off about the good captain and Tony learned things. So, Tony grew to both love and fear Steve Rogers because of what Howard Stark had become in his absence. Being threatened with the Captain was enough to make any child fear for their life sometimes.
“He’s alive.”
The Avengers were responding to a call out about giant robotic chickens in Illinois courtesy of Doctor Doom. It was a normal call out and everything went perfectly smooth. They were able to take down six of the robots without much of a problem. It was the last one that was the cause of all the issues. Doom was controlling it directly and a well set off EMP was able to take out Tony’s suit, sending him plummeting through the abandoned building they were fighting beside. Now normally the suit could take a lot of damage, but Tony was using an older model while he fixed up his newest suit. So, when Tony went to try and brace his fall, he broke his right arm. And it wasn’t a pretty break. No, it was the kind of break that needed surgery to fix before he was stuck in a cast for months on end.
They just laid there together, arm in arm, while they came down from their highs. Tony had his head pillowed on Steve’s chest and one of Steve’s hand were buried in Tony’s hair while the other rested on his ass. It was a moment of pure contentment. A moment of no worries. A moment of freedom. After all that had happened to them, they could finally take a break.
Luckily seeing the internet implode when Tony and Steve shared the pictures they took together was enough to put a smile on Tony’s face. And sure, the majority of the comments were people thirsting over Steve, but to Tony’s surprise, he had quite a few people commenting about him. And in a positive way no less.
When Tony was five months along he had another ultrasound to determine the gender of the baby. Personally, Tony thought that the over gendering of things, especially children’s things, was stupid and he didn’t care if the baby was a boy or a girl. But Steve was excited so Tony went along with it. Plus they wouldn’t find out the secondary gender until birth so a little excitement over something so mundane was alright.
Tony’s problems with the Captain probably weren’t helped by the fact that Tony had had a crush on the man since he hit puberty. Let's just say that Captain America awakened something in Tony that Howard Stark hated.
Always a consultant. Never an Avengers. So, Tony tried to keep his distance. Sure Tony would be there for call-outs. He knew he could help. But he wasn’t an Avengers so he knew he had no place at their team bonding things. Sure, he showed up every once in a while, but he never lingered. He didn’t want to see everyone being a happy team together while all Tony ever got from others were little scraps of happiness.
“If I wasn’t breathing I’d be dead.” snarked Tony as he huffed through another contraction.
Tony always enjoyed date night. Ever since he and Steve had gotten together after SHIELD fell, they’d made it a thing to go out every Wednesday night, just the two of them. It was their one constant in an ever-changing world.
Bucky and Sam tried their best to help Steve through his grief but to no avail. He’d been through too much in the last five years for the comfort of friends to do much. They tried though so Steve had to give them that.
Hey guys! Who’s ready for a new chapter? I’m so excited about this one! I took some inspiration from Pineapplebread’s Tattoo AU but added my own twist. But seriously, check out her art. Here are the links to her
“Iron Man? Iron Man come in.” shouted Steve over the coms. All he got was static.
As Tony’s pregnancy progressed and he grew closer and closer to his due date, Steve grew more and more protective. Tony chalked it up to Steve’s own instincts and hormones. He wouldn’t let any Alphas near Tony and the baby. He mostly kept Tony sequestered to their room. And it was their room at this point. They’d been sharing a bed for months now.
They were interrupted when one of the nurses came into the room. She checked Tony over to make sure he was alright before she gave him some more medication. She didn’t ask questions about the tears in both Tony and Steve’s eyes. Once she left, Steve checked on Harley and then crawled into bed with Tony and held him close. Tony melted into the touch. He never said it, but Tony loved to be held. Hell, he loved to be touched. He hadn’t received nearly enough positive touch.
“I love you too. Can’t imagine life without you. You make everything better.”
So, while sequestered away, Tony found ways to keep his mind occupied when Steve was bundling him up to watch a movie together or to give Tony a back rub. Tony was never going to complain about the back rubs. Steve’s hands were heaven.
And so Tony started going to his therapist more often. Steve thought nothing of it when he noticed. He knew that Tony needed to do what he needed to do to heal. Steve often cared about Tony’s health and happiness more than his own. That was it’s own problem to dissect, but at least Tony was seeking help. Steve was so proud of his fiancé. Tony had finally broken the cycle of shame that Howard Stark had started. Tony was a better man than his father could have ever dreamed to be. Tony was good.
He wasn’t expecting for his whole world to change.
But once Tony met the man he had a whole new set of problems. He could tell the second they’d met that Steve Rogers hated him for not being Howard. He could smell the disappointment and hated off of the man. He must have read Romanov’s profile on him and based his decision off of that before even meeting him.
“I’ll see about getting you a snack, but you’re staying here.”
No sound came out except for a little garbled noise.
“Tony, no. You are far from useless because you can’t work at the moment. You don’t need to earn your place on this team by building things. The only thing you need to do is rest. You are not useless. Would I lie to you?” asked Steve as he leant his head over Tony’s.
“So, what do you think?” asked Steve as he stood there shirtless in his and Tony’s room.
“So, where are we going?” asked Tony as he finished changing out of his suit and into some old jeans, a band t-shirt, and a well-loved leather jacket.
“Love You Steve.”
And that phrase sent Steve through a loop. It shook something inside of him. Just how many times had Tony put his life on the line for others? Seeing what Tony had just done made him feel absolutely horrible for the jab he’d taken at Tony about not laying down on the wire. He remembered reading something in Tony’s file about palladium poisoning and acting erratically while he was dying but also not seeking help. It made him worried.
Sam paused and looked at Steve for a moment. He saw his friend's eyes shining with happiness and that was enough for Sam. He always liked seeing his friends happy.
Sam reached out and shook Steve’s withered hands. Steve placed his left over top of them and Sam instantly spotted the ring sitting proudly on his finger.
A few days after the infection was discovered, Steve had to write out a statement to the press over what had happened. He didn’t want to, but the world was growing restless without any news on what was going on. So Steve composed the statement at Tony’s bedside while he slept and handed it off to Sam when he came to visit.
“Fuck, Steve.”
“I can close it! Can anyone hear me? I can close it.” Spoke Natasha over the coms and Steve sighed in relief.
Then there was also the fact that Steve was talking about their wedding again. Normally, talking about their wedding plans gave Tony hope. Not that day. That day, talking about their up-and-coming nuptials filled Tony with a sort of dread. Not because he didn’t want to get married. No, Tony very much wanted to marry Steve. No, it was more to do with Tony’s new appearance as well as his lack of words.
What made things worse was that a day into the new treatment Tony’s fever spiked and he started to throw up. Throwing up was absolutely horrible for Tony’s healing neck and that set him back even further. There were a few times where Tony almost went septic but he didn’t. Thank fuck for that.
It felt good to be home.
It took a while to calm Tony down. Thankfully, Harley just slept the whole time and they weren’t interrupted by doctors. No doubt they would soon but for now, it was just the two of them. The entire time Steve just helped Tony in his arms and kept him safe and warm. But eventually, Tony did calm down and they needed to talk.
Tony and Steve didn’t keep secrets from each other. Steve told Tony about Bucky and what he did to his parents once he had all the information. Tony was rightfully upset about his Mom, but Steve gave him the comfort and space he needed to process what happened. It made things easier when they found Bucky and Brought him to the tower. Tony even made him a new arm.
Tony passed out not long before they landed back at the tower and Steve began to panic.
But this wasn’t a fun call out. No, this call out would turn out to have very serious consequences.
Tony never expected to end up married and a hero.
IT’S WEDDING DAY! Who's excited? Get ready for fluff and smut and all that good stuff. There’s only one more chapter after this one so hang in there. I hope you enjoy this one and don’t forget to drop a comment if you want. Enjoy! -Shadows
It took a while for Tony to reply to anything. He just sat there contemplating everything. He was going into a downward spiral and he didn’t like where it was going. All his insecurities were bubbling to the surface, visible in the pools of tears starting to form in his eye.
“I can’t keep my baby.” whispered Tony and Steve looked confused.
“How are you feeling doll?” Everything alright?” asked Steve as he got Tony’s attention.
“I’m ok…” sighed Tony. He was feeling tired. “Go… go be with Harley. Needs his dad.”
He and Bucky talked it out for a bit but Steve didn’t change his mind. He loved Bucky and Sam and everybody there, but he just couldn’t deal with it all anymore. He needed a chance to make things better. Maybe if he went back far enough he could fix some things. He just needed a good place to start.
Turns out that Tony strutting around in nothing but gold booty shorts was an insane distraction for Steve. Luckily, he’d already done his part and was free to ogle at his boyfriend as he managed to gather just a little bit more intel including the location of HYDRA’s next target.
“Alright. Going quantum in 3. 2. 1.” Spoke Bruce as he flipped some switches and started the sequence. Steve smiled as he shrank. He knew everything would be alright.
Tony was finally healing and He’d never felt more supported and protected.
It didn’t take long before the two had ripped off their pants and resumed their kissing on the couch like horny teenagers. Steve was quick and thorough as he opened Tony up for him. Neither wanted to wait very long but Steve also didn’t want to hurt Tony, so he made sure to prep Tony well. Quickly, but well.
After calming down some, Tony felt exhausted. Steve made sure he was comfortable in his arms before Tony slipped off to sleep. He needed the rest. There had been a lot of big emotions and no doubt he’d be having a meeting with his therapist the next day. She really was a good therapist.
But once everyone was there, minus Thor who had returned to Asgard, Tony quickly realized that he was the outsider. He was the one to pay for everything. He was the one to do all the work on their weapons and gear without proper thanks. Tony worked alone while everyone else became a team.
“Fuck yeah I do.” Smiled Tony as he got up and swung his legs over so that he was firmly situated on Steve’s lap. They sat face to face as Tony ground down against Steve’s growing erection.
“So I take it your meeting didn’t go well today?”
When Steve slid inside Tony, Tony practically screamed out Steve’s name. Steve just smiled and started thrusting in hard. He always loved how loud and talkative Tony was in bed. Half the time it just made Steve want to kiss all the noises right out of him.
“Oh, Tony.” Sighed Steve as he saw the tears begin to form. He took Tony into his arms and rested his head against Tony’s.
“Come on Tony, surely there’s a name that you like.” fretted Steve one afternoon. The two were sitting in Tony’s lab. Tony was on the couch working on some designs while Steve read through a baby naming book.
“You’re doing so well, doll. Just hang in there. Just hold on for me.” worried Steve as he saw Tony starting to lose his focus and bearings.
“Stark?” asked Steve and Tony looked up for just a second before looking back at his hand.
“Seems like you need to de-stress after all of that.” Husked Steve as he looked down at Tony.
Tony fell back asleep pretty quickly after that.
“I so fucking useless.” Sighed Tony as he rested his forehead on Steve’s chest.
The comment about Pepper actually got Tony to smile. Steve loved when he smiled.
Things were a little weird between Tony and Steve for a few days after the baby name conversation. Tony didn’t know what was going on. Not only was Steve hovering more, but he was also showering Tony in gifts, praise, and gushy nicknames. Tony was called sweetheart, doll, sweet thing, baby, sugar, pretty much every name in the book. Tony didn’t know how he was supposed to feel about this. Sure, the treatment made him blush and his tummy flutter, but Tony was confused.
And they were absolutely right. Pretty much the second Tony woke up he was trying to escape medical. It was only Steve pretty much sitting on him that Kept Tony there long enough for the doctors to give the all clear to leave with strict instructions to take it easy even though they knew it was futile. Tony was always on the move. Getting him to take it easy just wasn’t going to happen.
It was now three days without Tony and Steve just felt numb. It was his funeral that afternoon and Steve felt like throwing up as he put on the suit that he’d had stashed away in his place in Brooklyn. He’d moved there part-time after the Decimation. The suit had originally be bought on the off chance he needed to dress nice for an event or date. He never thought he’d be wearing it to a funeral, let alone Tony’s funeral.
They had been on a few missions together after the Avengers had moved into the tower and the team was getting increasingly closer. Well, they all were except for Tony. That… well that worried Steve a little. Sure he’s read in Tony’s file that he wasn’t a team player and didn’t work well with others, but all evidence pointed to the contrary. Tony worked great with the team and with others. The man just had no patience for bullshit. And well, Steve couldn’t really blame him. Steve had no patience for it either.
“Thought you were just being nice for the baby.”
Steve hated undercover missions. He much preferred to do his fighting out in the open. Plus, he was easily recognizable. So, he hated them. Like really hated them. So, when Fury called him and Tony in to do an undercover op to smoke out some known HYDRA agents, he really wasn’t thrilled.
"Why did you do that Tony? Why? You should've been more careful.” Asked Steve. It wasn’t meant to be a reprimand but in Steve’s tired and stressed-out state his words sounded harsher than he meant.
Not long after Natasha sent the post, the other Avengers arrived and took their seats. Rhodey took up residence on Steve’s other side as they all anxiously waited for any news on Tony. Any news at all would be better than the deafening silence that permeated the hallway they were all crowded in. At one point Sam went to go bring everyone some much-needed drinks and snacks.
“Love… You… Steve…” rasped out Tony as blood sputtered from his mouth and the wound in his neck.
“How so?” asked Bucky as he turned to his friend.
In the interest of Tony being a shit disturber, they took a few photos together showing off their tattoos. Tony wore deep black sunglasses in the pictures. Although the world had seen the scars on his face where his eye used to be, Tony still didn’t like people seeing the area. He didn’t like the stares he got nor the pitying looks he got from some of the employees at SI and the compound. The looks made him think of the numerous times that Howard had called him weak and pathetic growing up.
As the night got underway patrons started to arrive. There would be a drag show as well as pole dancers and the atmosphere was ripe with excitement. Steve, to his credit, kept focus on the job at hand. He was already amassing a list of names with six known hydra agents already in the bar. He kept his eyes on them and was very happy when the agents made their way into a private booth near the back that Steve had bugged earlier. He really hoped they’d get some good intel. But he knew the best was only yet to come.
“MOTHERFUCKER!” screamed Tony over the coms as he was throw down through 20 stories of concrete and rebar.
Tony was mostly in and out of consciousness while the doctors waited to see if the treatment would do anything. Steve stayed by his side the entire time and updated everyone else on Tony’s condition. Needless to say, everyone was worried sick.
“Sorry. Sorry.” Worried Steve and Tony just squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head.
They were happy. Very, very happy. Tony couldn’t ever remember being this happy. Neither could Steve. They were together. They had good friends and family. They were happy.
“Fuck…” swore Tony and Steve didn’t know what to do. No amount of first aid and military training had prepared him for seeing his crush laying on the floor with a broken femur after an explosion.
“I’m not good. He’s not mine to keep. He’s yours. I’m not good for him. He’s yours. I can’t… I can’t have either of you. Want that so bad... I’m not good. I’m not…” Tears were falling once more from Tony’s eyes and Steve felt his heart break. Where on Earth did Tony get these ideas about himself?
But…that was, apparently, incorrect.
Tony’s gaze was burning when it settled on him, studying. After a moment of consideration, he finally answered, “I did. I do”.
It had been clear from the start that these people thought of Steve as a victim of Tony’s schemes. They had even been doubtful that Tony was actually working for him, oblivious in their gleeful contempt for the man, and it was little relief that there seemed to be no word of him serving as Steve’s mistress in addition to his secretary.
Of course, with time, he learned to adjust. Having Bucky around had helped considerably. He managed to become a constant presence in Steve’s life in a very short time, and then he met Peggy. In his late wife, Steve had finally found someone who could keep him grounded and sane.
The handkerchief that hid his lock of hair.
“I can’t find Mr Johnson’s latest report,” Tony said, apparently to no avail, since Steve was too absorbed in whatever he was reading to respond to him.
“You think I don’t know why you’re doing this, my lord? You just want to have a place to spend
Tony remained silent. Looking up Steve thought he looked shamefaced.
The guests were soon guided by Jarvis to the dining room for lunch, with only Tony remaining behind, gathering his notes and papers from the transaction.
“Don’t be absurd, Lord Rogers. Sit down. Or have you forgotten that I have yet to sign your precious little deal, hmm?” he replied drily, and Steve once more stopped in his tracks.
But then again, Tony had looked alarmed, scared even. He looked far from enjoying himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
It came as a surprise to Steve how little Mr Coulson had actually changed in all the years that had passed. His hair was a bit thinner, perhaps a little greyer too, but nothing more obvious than that. He was still stoically delivering the word of God to his faithful flock, like the good and proper shepherd he was.
This chapter was betaed by the amazing EachPeachPearPlum and the spectacular Lacrimula_Falsa.
, that it would have been impossible for him to simply walk away. When he thought of what Tony had said, though, he was left puzzled, alarmed, even. Tony had obviously arranged to meet someone, a man, under Steve’s nose. That name,
Watching the way Tony’s frame all but swayed, struggling to stay upright, Steve decided it couldn’t be so. He might have acted a fool more than once in regards to his behaviour towards Tony Stark, but
“Maybe Robinson Crusoe? If you like a novel? Or maybe something different. The Age of Reason, by Thomas Pain?”
Well, he wasn’t laughing now.
Unfortunately, paying attention proved to be a surprisingly difficult task for Steve to accomplish. Throughout the entire service, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was the only one listening to the vicar. By the end, he was convinced that everyone else was watching him instead.
“Come in.”
The signing of the railway agreement took place in the library, so that every interested party, from the representatives and members of the Midland Railway Company to Steve’s own solicitor and even the ladies of their company, could attend. Tony had presented them with the finalised document - and two spare copies - which everyone took turns to inspect.  After Steve had laid down his signature, both Mister Carruthers and Lord Stone needed to do so on behalf of the Company’s board of directors for the document to be valid. Then, it was done. The people gathered clapped politely, the notary collected the copies to be taken back to his office for filling, and Steve could finally breathe again.
“Please. Was he… was he being... indecent?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It had taken almost a month of constant, private correspondence for them to agree to Steve’s preliminary proposal.
Perhaps the most important detail in his plan had been managing to persuade the right person to purchase it.
Steve lowered his eyes, ashamed. “Please don’t… don’t thank me. Not for that. Not you, at least.”
Perhaps some of the older onlookers recognized his face, connecting Lord Rogers to the lanky son of the widow Sarah Rogers, and a former servant of the Stark household.
The image of Steve that first night, flushed from wine and standing shyly in Tony’s quarters, reciting slowly but passionately words written just for him, comes to Tony unwittingly. He remembers it all at once, all their stolen moments. The curve of Steve’s powerful back when he lay sprawled in Tony’s bed, the concentrated frown on his face when inspiration stroke and he just
Steve felt his blood boil at Stone’s implications. He stood up, barely containing himself from charging at the other man.
Who was this man Rhodes to Tony? Why was he so important? Steve’s heart sank the more he mulled over it. The love in Tony’s voice had been evident. If only Tony sounded like that when talking about
Tony sighed, happily, as he turned into Steve’s arms, his body pressing closer to Steve’s. They had made love one more time, slower, almost leisurely, looking into each other’s eyes the entire time, and Tony had ended up falling asleep not long after.
- regard them calmly, apparently having just arrived, ready for the ride.
“My word!”
“Well, you are hiding something from me, I can tell that much,” Steve persisted, getting a little worried.
All through dinner, Steve raked his mind for a way to keep Lord Stone away from Tony. As much as he hated it, he still needed Lord Stone to sign the final agreement. Losing the railway deal at this point would mean that all the hard work of these past weeks would go to waste, and the Stark Estate finances would be back to square one. As well off as Steve was, he still had ended up spending a rather large sum of money paying off the property’s mortgage, and he needed the estate to start making some real profit soon, or it would leave him basically incapable of supporting it in the long run.
drawing the beauty of mother nature, don’t you deny it! You thought I wouldn’t notice, but nothing gets past me.” Steve grinned at him, and Tony just had to add, “You always
“Just as I know you never spend the night in your own bed anymore.”
Bucky had clearly decided he was going to speak his mind though, because he persisted despite the warning. “He has always been your weakness, Steve! I’ve known you for, what, nearly ten years now? All this time, you never did manage to move past him. I know he’s caused you a lot of hurt, Steve. But
Lord Rogers. He says it’s all a front, and that he has forced Rogers to pay him a salary and everything! That way he is free to continue with his life of debauchery…”
Troubled by the track his thoughts were taking him down, Steve opted to take his next meal alone, leaving Tony to his own devices. He next saw the man when he met him in the library. They chatted absently about work, Tony giving him worried looks, but not commenting on anything.
So, there it was again, back in his chest, that clenching, burning sensation of pure rage and desperation, the urge to strike back, to hurt those who hurt him. It flared into life when Steve saw Lord Stone’s hands on Tony’s delicate frame, even though it was for just a few moments, before his presence forced the man to take a step back. He didn’t look at all happy with the interruption.
“You tell Betsy to mind her own business, alright?”
“You are your own man, Steve. I pray to God you know what you’re doing.” He got up, walking up to Steve to place a conciliatory hand on his shoulder. A moment later he withdrew.
Of course Tony had prepared for this. That was what whores do, after all.
He pursed his lips, deciding to ignore it. “I need you to make preparations for a visiting party. Six, maybe eight people, the number has yet to be finalised.”
He had already decided that he would not allow himself to feel remorse for what was about to happen. In this room he wouldn’t need to be a gentleman, he would not be Lord Rogers. Here he was allowed to be who he wanted and to do as he desired. To take what he had paid for.
“You will stay away from him,” Steve stated, voice hard and emotionless, tired of playing Stone’s games.
Steve hadn’t forgotten that; on the contrary, after spending more time with him, Steve couldn’t help but be constantly reminded of their time together in the distant past. It was as if a candle had been lit and now shone upon the darkest corners of his soul.
He went back to his study, listened carefully to the faint sounds of Jarvis serving Stone his tea that came from the room beside his own, and waited.
, not three feet away from him.
“How do you always manage to get yourself into situations like this, Steve?” Bucky said, shaking his head. “I should never have left you here on your own. You’ve never thought clearly when it came to Stark.”
Still a courtesan, but also heartbroken and dying. Though, frankly, he’s not giving a shit about that last part.
“I wondered about it, too. Fury thinks there must have been interference from someone of a higher rank. There was a case of treason, selling weapons to the enemy. The public needed to see someone pay. Even with the official charges being dropped, Stark was the scapegoat. He got off light, really. He could have very easily lost his head.”
, he thought.
Still, despite all that, Tony’s effect on him was maddening. Steve had tried to ignore Tony in their everyday dealings, for the most part. He had tried, and at times even succeeded to separate Tony the temptation from Tony the servant. It was a dangerous game to play, especially for his vulnerable -already thoroughly broken- heart, and every day that passed, it was getting harder and harder to keep it all up.
Steve decidedly avoided thinking about the Tony Stark of his past, who was ridiculous and smart, and charming and warm-hearted. Well… most of the time. Steve had struggled for years to move past the events of that day, the day that marked the real end of his youth. He had gone to Tony that day a green boy full of hope, and had left him a man, with his heart shattered to pieces.
For one torturous moment, Steve wondered if Tony had suggested them becoming lovers out of sheer desperation alone, and the thought ate away at his soul.
Oh my god, you guys, thank you so much for the amazing response!
He rose to his knees, using Tony’s legs to keep balance. His own dick was aching as he tugged himself free. He felt oddly powerful, situated between Tony’s spread legs, still dressed while Tony was completely bare, like he was once again stating the difference between them, that he was now Tony’s better.
“Agh…Steve, please!” Tony cried, his entire body shaking after Steve shoved a third finger deep inside him, his eyes rolling as the pleasure got too much for him to deal with.
