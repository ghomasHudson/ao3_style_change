“She’s fast as hell,” he observed aloud, “but her powers aren’t particularly well-controlled yet. And look, back up about thirty seconds. She’s not just paying homage to Carol, she’s mimicking a bunch of her moves—some others too. Shit.”
“Well that’s a fucking first.” He remembered another Strange, raising a single finger in the air, confirming the worst of Tony’s fears about the path forward. He’d been sympathetic too, all the bravado he’d had about sacrificing anyone to save the time stone vanished. Much more than the reminder of what he’d said about there only being one future where the team triumphed over Thanos, it had been seeing that look on Strange’s face that had made Tony sure of what was coming.
“I don’t know why he’s insisting on holding the press conference beforehand. I keep telling him that we might as well use the goodwill that will be garnered by a free event with lots of famous people and lots of booze to announce that his own company is claiming he’s not who he says he is, but he’s being stubborn. Even moreso than usual.”
Steve had hoped, maybe even been sure enough of it to assume, that with enough time and mentorship Talia would reach this level of confidence and comfort in her own skin within SHIELD. And perhaps that was still true. Would it be worth the struggle and distress it would almost assuredly cause Talia when there was an option that seemed so much more organic and simple for her, though?
“Please touch me, Bruce. I need it, I’ve been good, right, you said—”
“Maybe I should just head back home. If Peter’s there I’m betting he’s pretty upset—”
“And how do you expect to form any kind of relationship with any version of Tony Stark when you have yet to grieve the loss of the first?” Steve sputtered angrily. How
He sticks around just laughing and catching up with Rhodes longer than he really intended. Rhodey tells him all about his work with SWORD, the planets he’s visited, the various alien races he’s had the chance to work with. It would be easy for him to make Sam feel small in the fact of that, but Rhodes asks plenty of questions. He’s particularly interested in the work Sam has been doing with folks who have been displaced by efforts to shut down borders and find housing for the Returned.
The longer it went on, the more MJ’s defiant fury melted away into concern, and then outright alarm.
The offer of sleep medication had been tempting, damn tempting. Before this it had been months of deliberate deprivation, the team resting in shifts just long enough to prevent their bodies from entirely shutting down. Even Steve, who had the lowest sleep requirements of all of them, had been ragged and drawn as they pushed the serum beyond its limits. Now here Tony was, not just alive and safe enough to sleep, but somehow in the Tower in his own bed (well not quite—it was a touch firmer than his old mattress had been, but it was damn close) for the first time in years.
“How exactly would you
He considered apologizing, then, for bringing them somewhere that might have been painful, but decided against it. Tony couldn’t keep being sorry for not being someone else; it was hard enough to stop screwing up on his own merits. He opted instead for pulling Bruce’s cool feet into his lap, holding them between his sun-warmed thighs as he took another bite of parfait. The absence of their usual routines still made Tony feel itchy and anxious, but Bruce clearly was not in any hurry to get away from him, and he was quiet in a way that suited Tony’s reflective mood, and eased his adjustment back to speaking after a night of silence. He was also terribly ticklish on his feet, which Tony couldn’t help playing with a couple of times once he made the happy discovery.
Banner and Rogers are likely currently unaware of what they each suspect about Stark’s experiences with starvation, and perhaps are hoping to be proved wrong so that they never have to voice their thoughts to the rest of their teammates.
“On average, response time is seven minutes longer during school hours. I have also taken the liberty of accounting for other commitments, including common hours for religious observances, and found similar patterns.”
Steve appreciated on some level that she didn’t bother with introductions or softball questions designed to put him at ease. Domen was being frank about her goals, and about the fact that this was a standardized process. To her, Steve wasn’t special; his loss was not unique. After years of journalists and strangers and coworkers calling Tony’s death things like unimaginable and incomprehensible, it was oddly comforting to think that there was a set of rules for how to deal with this.
to adore the guy, but he was also somewhat of an expert at dodging Phil when the situation called for it. (Typically it involved the words ‘okay, this looks bad.’) He could figure this one out.
This one is more spoilery, so skip if you have no triggers and want to maintain the surprise: in the last section of the chapter, Tony and Bucky visit Mark 2's parents' graves on the anniversary of their death. Howard's stone has been defaced (which Tony already knew in advance) by people responding to the news of his cover-up. This scene was outline before recent events involving the deliberate damaging and removal of monuments dedicated to those who have perpetrated various forms of violence and oppression. I happily support all such efforts, but wanted to be clear that this scene was not written as a response to that context, nor as an attempt to draw some kind of 1:1 connection between Howard Stark and perpetrators of real life violences.
“If we pick off too many at once they’re gonna retreat or call in backup” Steve explained as he pointed at a portion of the digital projection of the Tower he was manipulating. “But each of these should take out around 3 or 4 of ‘em at once, enough to thin the heard and distract them from realizing we’re essentially directing them through the Tower exactly the way we want.”
“I heard back from our personal legal staff last night,” Pepper said, opening several windows on the table’s holoscreen and fanning them out. (It was such a little thing, but it would never get old for Tony how comfortable everyone in this universe was with his tech.) “As we expected, it’s complicated. Trying to prove that someone didn’t know something is way more complicated than proving that they did. And there’s of course the added wrinkle known only to us of the fact that you didn’t grow up here or in any universe with orientation, so anything Howard did or didn’t say which would have hinted at the existence of this project is going to be guesswork on our part.”
Ah, this week is such a treat! So many compelling scientific inquiries. Again, in order:
It was awkward, still. The first thing Tony did once everyone was settled back in the living room was find his purple kneeler. It was habit, by now, to get it and set it at Steve’s feet. What wasn’t habit was the way Steve winced and shut his eyes for a moment like the sight wounded him.
. Actually empty. Everyone we’d ever put away, on solo missions or as a team…one of ‘em made it through the breastplate my uniform, I remember because Tony had just upgraded it and I was thinking about how angry he was gonna be. How I’d probably have to dig him out of the shop—he always took it so hard when our tech or our suits didn’t hold up in a fight. He wanted to protect everyone…he used to go to hospitals and cuddle the babies, you know.”
Ah, a sensible question about things that matter like how to sort and categorize things. Excellent. Let’s get to it.
“Alright. But we should get the others, maybe. It’s not just you who deserves to know, and I don’t think I can bear going through this more than once.”
saying that!”
A part of Steve felt bad for thinking it when he remembered how hard Tony had fought to separate himself from Iron Man. But the other, far more selfish aspect of his psyche that had been on edge for days now was undeniably relieved. (Tony would be ready, always, to face any threat that came at them. And unlike before, when the arc had meant he wore his heart on the outside, vulnerable and exposed, now it meant the armour would be with him, forever protecting the heart that lay beating beneath it.) Steve’s Dominance was viciously satisfied, stopping just short of roaring in triumph to see his submissive so well-protected.
Wakanda’s workplace orientation and cross-training models have vocal and well-funded critics, but are they the way forward in a world where most of the population is simply not getting what they need?
So the last couple weeks I sort of wondered if the Doctor would be getting any more questions as the story wound down, so colour me absolutely delighted to have gotten such amazing prompts! Thanks, team!
“You’ll tell them,” she said confidently. “You’ll tell them when you’re ready, and when it’s right. Until then I can help you carry this, just like I promised. And Tony?” He looked up at Pepper, finding her far more blurry than she’d been just a few minutes ago. (The adrenaline was finally wearing off. Shit.) “It doesn’t matter how you came to be. You’re not something someone made. You’re not his prize or his property or some living monument to his ego. You weren’t destined to save the world because of him; you chose it, because you are a kind and decent and incredibly brave man. It’s okay to rest now.”
“It’s illegal to publish pictures, video, or even written accounts of anything that happens at Clayton Park,” Steve explained in a quiet voice, gesturing to a statue of a young woman situated in the very centre of the park. “Keera Clayton saved the life of a submissive in severe deprivation by Dominating him in a public space. It was illegal back then, for people of colour to Dom white folks, and someone took a picture that resulted in her arrest. When the sentence was vacated and she was freed nearly twenty years later, she declined all compensation. She asked that the money be put towards a sanctuary for all Dominants and submissives instead, so that everyone would have somewhere to go to practice their orientation in the light of day without risk of harm or exposure.”
Thanks for being patient with the brief disruption in my posting schedule. I try really hard to keep things regular, but the last few weeks have just been an extra level of bananas, as those of you who follow me on Tumblr have seen me rant about at length. Thanks for sticking with me, and for your wonderful comments, kudos, and #AskStrange questions!
“What, Tony, no—”
“Not to mention that I’m sure that kid is in pretty severe Dom-dep,” Natasha added. Steve had gotten a similar sense from Peter himself, but he still groaned aloud at receiving what was essentially confirmation. According to his file, Peter was a Dominance-inclined Switch. It wasn’t entirely uncommon for kids his age to end up in dep on the Dominance end of things, simply because minors had fewer natural opportunities to take on Dominant roles; healthy parent/child relationships, and even the bonds some kids shared with teachers and other caretakers and mentors were often enough to satisfy non-sexual submissive needs for things like care and guidance, but Dominance was harder to come by—especially for kids like Peter who didn’t seem to have much in the way of friends or partners.
think about it.”
He and Dr. Domen had covered this numerous times by now, but it still hurt to admit it aloud to someone beyond the team. Still, if his apology was to be more than words, they needed to start by letting Pepper (and to a lesser extent Rhodes) in.
Being fucked this way, in a position that should have afforded Tony so much control and was instead showcasing Steve’s endless strength and precision, it was so much more devastating than if Steve had crawled on top of him or held him down. It was honestly fortunate that neither of them lasted a particularly long time, because the orgasm building in the pit of Tony's stomach didn't feel like something he knew for certain he would survive.  When Steve’s huge hand wound around his cock, he shook his head and whimpered.
“Mr. Parker, as I have told you several times, the donation was anonymous. But there has not been a mistake; your bill for this visit, as well as all outstanding fees from previous trips to the emergency room, have been paid in full.” Peter’s nurse, a tall blonde man who stood with his hands on his hips, sounded exasperated. This was somewhat unsurprising given the fact that their current conversation was clearly a repeat. What was rather more alarming was Peter. Tony had been prepared for the heavy cast that went all the way up to his mid-thigh, and for the bruising on his face that hadn’t yet been taken care of by the kid’s healing factor. But he hadn’t been ready for a version of Peter that was so angry and tired. There were lines on his face that would have been more fitting of a man in his thirties, and he spoke with none of the over-politeness that had always been so wonderfully out of place on a teenager.
“God as my witness I will yeet you across the room if you don’t stop beeping,” he threatened. For some reason, this worked. Peter was momentarily impressed by the fact that he could inspire terror in inanimate objects. This was when the first memory of the night before came back to him: MJ seizing his phone after his 14th text to Harley, telling Peter that he would be thankful later.
“I’ll do it,” he said, unsure even as he rose to his feet and wiped his eyes if he’d actually be able to manage the task. After a brief, critical glance at Steve, Tony seemed to come to the same conclusion. He shook his head, already in the process of turning on his heel to go do the job himself. Then he stopped and looked back at Steve, something vulnerable and full of a fragile hope Steve hadn’t seen so nakedly clear since before the Civil War.
, but they never let Steve live it down.)
Did I mention that you all are some of the kindest, most thoughtful and fun readers ever? Because you are. Your comments and kudos make every chance I have to open the file for this story a joy.
Content Warnings: Steve alludes briefly to past and somewhat ongoing tensions between himself and Bucky about the latter's increased need for high levels of pain in his scenes following his time with HYDRA. Steve has reacted badly to this in the past, but (and he reflects on this directly) it's not a matter of wanting to shame anyone for their kinks and more about mourning who Bucky was, and struggling with seeing HYDRA's effects on him in such an intimate setting. If you want to avoid this, skip the paragraph that begins "And that was...rather a kind understatement", as well as the paragraph after it. (It will, however, be a sub-plot that comes up again since Steve and Bucky's relationship is still healing from those issues.)
My beta, lou2, is always amazing. But I want to say an especially huge thanks for her work with this chapter. She gets Steve in a way I am only aspire to, and her comments and critique made everything involving him SO much better.
War hero. Genius. Philanthropist. For decades, the legend of Howard Stark has been used as a yardstick by which American ingenuity, innovation and business-savvy have been measured. Even Stark’s critics have been willing to concede that his alleged personal failings were far outweighed by the numerous and substantial legacies he left behind. How, after all, could the man who gave us Captain America as well as aiding in the country’s decisive victory in the Second World War, truly be anything but a hero?
this house.” For Tony, whose tastes and interests had never been as well-reflected by a space as they were by the Malibu house, this was at least as good as a declaration of love to himself. Maybe even more meaningful in some ways, because Malibu was everything people tended not to like about Tony: opulent, excessive, luxurious, brash and unashamed. He wrapped his arms around Clint’s neck and kissed him, letting the shoes and socks he’d carried back to the house fall to the floor with a wet squelch. Clint met every touch with no hint of the awkwardness that had existed between Tony and just about everyone after the news about Peter had dropped.
“You too, Hawkeye.”
For all the work and anticipation that had gone into getting them there, Tony and Rhodey’s entrance into the mansion was somewhat anticlimactic. Tony waved at the team, threw a grouchy glare over his shoulder at his friend, and stumbled immediately toward the kitchen in search of coffee. Steve arched a brow at Rhodes, concerned, but the other man laughed and rolled his eyes.
Clint reached over and squeezed his hand. The pattern of calluses and small burns on his lover’s hand was familiar and comforting, and Phil returned the pressure gratefully.
“But I can give you that,” Steve pleaded, not caring how desperate he must sound. It would be one thing if Tony didn’t want him, if he just wasn’t interested or felt too burned by Steve’s earlier mistakes with him. But he couldn’t lose Tony to nothing but misunderstandings and the ghosts that lay between them, he just couldn’t. “I can’t promise you I wouldn’t make mistakes, but I’m not him. I would never hurt you in ways like that, that don’t heal. And I know you’re tired sweetheart, I know you are, but I could give you the rest you need. It doesn’t have to be a choice like that, you don’t have to pick one and sacrifice the other. I want to help you rest, more than just about anything that’s what I want.”
It was a sight Tony had, of course, witnessed once before, but it couldn’t have been more different. When Steve had knelt then it had been meaningless to Tony except as a first stomach-dropping indication of the whole world of differences that stood between them. He knew, now, what it cost Steve to go against all his natural instincts, how badly he must want to make this gesture. Gesture wasn’t even the right word, though…a gesture had been what it was before, when the kneeling had been all about ritual. Steve had gone to his knees with grace, then, a smooth, flowing and soundless motion. Today he crashed loudly to the floor, knees colliding harshly with unforgiving hardwood. Steve didn’t seem to care one way or the other about how much that had to hurt, but whether because he knew how unnatural a position this was for Steve, or just because he hated seeing him bring himself more pain, Tony couldn’t stand it. He went to his knees too, slipping his hands under Steve’s kneecaps with his palms up, forming a protective barrier. (For all his anxiety about kneeling in front of the team rather than during secret shame sessions, suddenly Tony felt like he was the graceful one in this pose, the one to whom it felt almost disturbingly natural.)
“Them to see you like this?” Phil suggested idly, like what he was saying didn’t send fucking electricity all up and down Tony’s spine. “Want them to see you—what did you say earlier,  basking in me? Want them to see Tony Stark stripped down, begging for a cock in his mouth?” Tony made a short, jerky motion that could have been construed as a nod, but that wasn’t enough for his Dominant. “Say yes, Sir.”
This turned out to be a fortuitous choice, because while he would have sought his partner out on his own floor, JARVIS took him to the level containing the media room. Gone were the cartoons and sugar cereal that had featured so prominently during his recent date with Tony, however. The room was dark, lit only by grainy security footage projected on the screen.
“Sorry ‘bout him. You know he loves you, right? Even if you were supposed to wait on our floor this morning and not break into the penthouse.” Without even giving Tony a second to digest the startling news that Tony’s bot apparently hangs out on his and Rogers’ floor, Barnes turned to Tony next. His face and his eyes still bore hints of the traumas he’d endured as the Winter Soldier. But this universe had been decidedly kinder to this Barnes than to his counterpart in Tony’s universe; he definitely had way more laugh and smile lines, not to mention a metal arm that did not look Wakandan. It looked like Tony’s own work, actually, which was more than a touch disconcerting. (Had other-Tony known what the Winter Soldier had done to his parents with the old one when he’d replaced it?) “That damned idiot was chomping at the bit to give this to you all morning and then—’m not making excuses or apologies on his behalf, but he’s been a real mess since…y’know. And that was our Tony’s favourite shirt. But the damn punk never shoulda used
“There’s kind of a few ways we can go about this, and since you and I don’t know one another very well in this capacity I don’t want to make any assumptions about which will be the best option for you. Your access history indicates you’ve already familiarized yourself with the team’s suits and weaponry, so you’re welcome to continue on with that and I’ll provide any feedback I can from the perspective of their handler. You could also spend some time catching up on past and active missions assigned to the Avengers Initiative; this would serve the dual purpose of also helping avoiding awkward questions about why you don’t know some of these things once your presence in this universe goes public.” Coulson gestured to a nested set of holoscreens, which Tony could see now were comprised mostly of after-action reports. He pointed at another stack of screens, the front image of which bore a symbol Tony didn’t recognize.
He should have been desperate to get downstairs. The labs? With Bruce, and a whole new realm of science to conquer? And did he mention the Bruce of it all? But then that was rather the problem. Until now, Tony had been able to tell himself that his departure from the Tower was imminent. He could never go back to his home dimension, sure, not without risking undoing all the team had done to put things right. But neither had he intended to stay here, surrounded by a team that wasn’t his, and who wanted so
“What’d he say?”
“You’re right. I…I’ll back off, this is your business to handle.”
Now he would have to live up to it. The second Natasha exited his office, he was staring back at the information they had collected with renewed focus. (What the hell happened to you, Tony?)
Peter had in fact given both questions a great deal of thought over the past few weeks and months. If it were just some sense of misplaced guilt about Tony’s death the way he’d first assumed, he thought it probably would have worn off by now. Perhaps Steve looked at it like a kind of mentoring thing, the way it had seemed Peter’s relationship with Tony had originally been developing before it had started to morph into something more parental. Except Steve didn’t seem overly interested in Spider-Man except when Peter specifically requested his help. But what, then, did that leave?
“Everyone
“I mean, my counterpart died. Or worse, he didn’t and he went along with some kind of long-con undoubtedly thought up by Fury. So either way, I think I got the worst end of things here.” Clint took issue with this, claiming the fate of ending up on a farm with a secret wife and kids worse than death, and the more they bickered and complained about their alternative selves, the more they drank.
“Technically she does technically still own 12% of the place,” Steve mused. The weak joke was as much for his own sake as it was Clint’s, because now that he had context for some of Tony’s behaviour (the blanket, the way he was seated closer to Pepper than they would usually have done), Steve could easily have kicked her out of the Tower himself. Clint flipped him off and dumped an entire bag of dill pickle chips (Steve’s least favourite snack of all time) into a bowl. Then he dug his hand in, grabbed a handful of chips and began eating. Loudly. With his mouth open. “Okay, okay, sorry. Look, it’s awful timing, it really is. And one day when things aren’t so new and tenuous with you all, you can maybe set up some boundaries around who and what is permitted to interrupt any portion of a scene including the aftercare. But if you didn’t do that ahead of time then you can’t fairly be pissed at either of them.”
“That’s really considerate, thank you. I mean—no, I don’t actually want the captions on, you’ve inflicted this movie on us enough that I can practically talk along—but you’re kind to think of that and offer, Tony.” This time Rhodey hummed in agreement and petted Tony’s hair. Curiouser and curiouser.
Bruce settled them across from one another on adjacent cushions on the living room couch. For a moment Tony considered offering to kneel for this little exercise (it honestly seemed like the more natural way to do this), but decided that would be giving rather too much away. A few seconds later, Bruce held out one of the garlic-stuffed green olives. Tony opened his mouth, and then bit down on the olive and Bruce’s fingers hard enough that the latter yelped and drew his hand back.
“Aww Sugar Cookie. You got no idea what’s coming. I feel both jealous and kinda sorry for you.”
Steve could not, would not, survive losing Tony a second time.
“Three days,” Rhodey said once she had taken off to the labs. “Plenty of time to freak out about your date with Captain America in the meantime, right?”
“I forgot it’s not really public knowledge for most people in this world. His sister was Wanda Maximoff. You would have known her as the Scarlet Witch.”
1. Submissives are the only ones who tend to wear collars full-time; even they tend to have daywear and nightwear or scene versions, simply because wearing thick leather around one’s neck all the time can be quite warm, and can negatively impact the skin.
The 24 hours that followed the Avenger’s return to the Tower were awful. Tony hadn’t thought there could be anything worse than the cold dark of radio silence, but at least there was still some degree of hope to be found in ignorance.
. Tony had wanted to get churros with the kid and teach him to drive and help him study for his first set of finals at MIT. He’d wanted to hug Peter for real, and teach him how to up his dating game (because damn did the kid really need some help there), and trade off good cop/bad cop with May when Peter inevitably made everyday young adult mistakes like getting wasted and running through the MIT quad naked. Instead, Tony had followed in his own father’s footsteps yet again, leaving his—the kid to (metaphorically) bury him before Peter even turned 18.
No, he’d wait this one out in the shop with all the liquor in the Tower, every project he could get his hands on, and the loudest music that JARVIS would permit.
The others were quiet too. Bruce refreshed the snacks and turned on a movie just for some noise, but no one was really watching it. Phil and Bucky were both settled on a kneeling pillow at Steve’s feet. It was bigger than Tony’s…than the purple one, and clearly intended for multiple people. Thor, wearing the wrist cuffs Tony recognized from days earlier, had an arm around Clint, who was idly toying with strands of Thor’s long blonde hair. Natasha was somewhere near the elevator, meeting someone Tony assumed was delivering take-out.
Natasha assented to the instructions, promised to text with any meaningful news, and then hung up. Not trusting himself to heed her warning about returning to New York if he spent much time alone, Steve quickly made his way to the front of the plane. They were about to cross the boundary of Wakanda and Talia was quite literally on the edge of her seat. Less than two minutes later, the quiet pastoral scene in front of them gave way to a glittering metropolis. Steve expected a whoop or a series of enthusiastic curses, but Talia greeted transformation with silence except for a single, awed,
“…huh. So you’re—alright then. I mean, if my brain was going to generate some kind of between-state guide I guess you’d be a decent one, though if you threaten to taze me again I might rethink that. The rest of you though…” He turned and surveyed the room, holding his hands up in a slightly mocking surrender when Natasha and Bucky both raised their weapons again. He stopped dead when his eyes (finally finally) fell on Steve. And oh Christ, it was really him. There were parts of the man that were just slightly off, like Steve’s Tony had been taken apart and put together not quite correctly (the arc reactor looked…odd, and there was something about the man’s left hand…). But there was no one else in the world who could make Steve feel like he was being stripped utterly just by the intensity of their attention.
“That doesn’t sound ominous at all. I swear to Thor if you’re about to make me read a self-help book, Coulson—”
“She’s a llama,” Tony corrected absently. “And she probably wants your wristwatch, the little thief. Drama, c’mere. If you can sit still for half an hour I’ll let you run wild with the silverware later.”
She still carried the small vase with her most everywhere. For the most part Natasha had learned to accept the fact of having a home; she no longer insisted on bringing her entire arsenal of weapons with her wherever she went (just most of it), and she’d purchased more than one kitchen item for the Tower that the Natasha of ten years ago would have deemed ludicrously frivolous. She was settled. But the vase…it was different, the last remnant of a childhood that had never really been one to begin with.
Peter huffed, filled with a dual sense of embarrassment and amusement. He’d had Ned back in his life as a friend for less than 24 hours. Why was he so determined to make himself miserable by turning it into something else entirely?
“I’m ready. I’ll go suit up.”
“This,” Pepper said, jabbing an accusing thumb toward the suit, “showed up in my office this morning and it won’t leave me alone. Tony won’t take my calls, and JARVIS says he’s instituted some kind of lockdown on the shop that even my access codes aren’t able to override. Someone had better start talking.”
“I turn my back on you for five seconds…it is nice to see you again, Dr. Stark.”
“Phil,” Tony whispered. But it wasn’t over, not yet.
“Don’t you fucking dare stop.”
“Want to do it now?” Tony blinked. Then blinked again. If this entire day had been a particularly elaborate dream, he was going to be really pissed. He’d finally figured out the quickest route between the admin floors of SHIELD and the cafeteria, and if the whole thing had been a dream he was never going to find the actual place.
With the abrupt release from that particular burden truly beginning to sink in, combined with the experience of witnessing Phil and Natasha interact in subspace…it had been as close as Tony would probably ever get (sorry, Bruce) to anything resembling meditation. The four of them—well, mostly three, Phil had mostly been pretty quiet—had talked and joked through several soap operas, the local news, a kid’s movie (which had been a great chance to witness how the non-sexual aspects of orientation were represented in this universe), plus a beer commercial that had triggered a detour through several other memorable ads on YouTube. Tony hadn’t been brave enough to ask any more questions about the team’s dynamic directly, but he’d learned a lot from the low-pressure task of just watching. Far from the usual hell it was to try to draw information out of either of them, Natasha and Clint had been free with their explanations and encouragement. Even when Tony had managed to completely misread things—like when he’d been sure the switch on a soap opera would end up being a villain simply for displaying both Dom and subbish traits—they’d been gentle in their corrections, and genuinely interested in where some of his assumptions came from.
“These are pretty heavy. When was your last orgasm?”
“Hey!”
No warnings, I don't think, necessary for these responses. As always, let me know if you disagree, or have questions/concerns regarding tagging.
Getting back in the armour for real had been less traumatic than Tony had imagined, but he hadn’t seen that much consecutive action since the Infinity War. He was tired. He was thoroughly annoyed. And he did not want to spend the morning completing more training, regardless of how helpful it might be for Steve’s anxiety. So he played it just slightly dirty, sliding to the edge of the bed and hooking his legs around Steve’s absurdly narrow hips and burying his face against Steve’s neck.
“After you what?” Natasha prompted from the shadows.
An alert flashed at the top of the screen, and Coulson’s smile vanished into a more familiar, business-like expression as he clicked it and scanned the small text-box that emerged:
Natasha, meanwhile, sat beside Clint on one of the bar stools. She was devoid of make-up, hair loose and wavy around her shoulders the way it only got when she showered and let it air-dry. Tony had been in the same room as the other version of her when they’d both been changing on more than one occasion, and yet this was by far the most naked he’d ever seen Natasha. She didn’t make any attempt to help Clint as he collected food for all of them on three separate plates, she just leaned lazily against Coulson when he sidled up next to her to drop a kiss on the top of her head.
“You have to understand. Our Tony, he wasn’t just a submissive, he was…well, it’s called a True orientation. It means a sub at level 1 or a Dom at level 10. There’s a lot of…well, mythos, for lack of a better term, around Trues. It’s partly because they’re rare, but it’s also because they’re special. Their bodies and their brains
Tony arrived in front of the home he knew to contain Dr. Stephen Strange distracted by the annoyingly persistent urge to rub the sting out of his ass. Rhodey, he’d learned that morning, could pack a wallop when he wanted to, and he had no issue with turning all his trademark focus on turning Tony’s ass red when he felt it was warranted.
“Well, in my estimation, you're owed both a punishment and a reward. You might not have known all the causes, but you knew enough to realize you weren’t feeling right. And you should have spoken to one of us about that Tony, that’s what your Dominants are here for. That’s a huge part of the reason these check-ins exist at all; it’s not just your physical well-being I’m concerned with. However, you were also so very good and dedicated to hold yourself back for this long, waiting for us to allow you pleasure. Now, it’s still important to me for sex not to become a part of our check-ins. So if you choose option one, I’ll decide on and implement a punishment for you, and then you can seek out a sexual reward from anyone else on the team, a temporary lift on the no-sex rule to recognize how hard you’ve been working for us.”
“I feel awesome,” Tony volunteered before Bruce could even ask. His Dom had started his exam with Tony’s legs today, carefully prodding at the places where he’d been tied to the spanking bench. It was a relief and a disappointment to not be touched where the pain was the worst, but this was at least a comforting reminder of everything that had happened the day before. Bruce chuckled again, and this time he wasn’t alone.
it, can we maybe skip to the part where you tell us if anything actually happened?” There was the dull thud of a hand colliding with clothed skin, and then Clint added a muttered, “Sorry, Steve.”
.” She spat the last word like it was something a little bit dirty, and everyone in the room laughed. “Truly though. I’ve never…even once the team had found each other, I think some part of me always felt like I didn’t deserve this, could never really wipe out enough red to earn being happy. But the most elemental forces of the universe aligned to bring you here, give you to us. Who am I to argue in the face of something like that?”
It was a step, and further than Steve had dared hoped they’d get first thing that morning.
“Who says I’m trying to talk you out of it, Stark?”
“I like her,” declared Shuri’s voice over the video-chat, just as youthful and irreverent as Steve remembered. “Brother, may I keep her?” T”Challa said something off-screen that made Shuri roll her eyes and mutter something about broken white boys. “Keep talking, snarky white girl.” Talia grinned.
Still, Tony took his time drinking the tea Steve had made them both. It was lemon, and while herbal wasn’t usually Tony’s…well, cup of tea, Steve had put some kind of rose flavoured honey in it that tasted amazing, especially paired with the delicate little cookies that were laid out on the coffee table.
He called a reluctant halt to the kneeling the second he felt the slightest twinge, and barely held back a sigh when JARVIS announced he had only managed to stay there twelve minutes longer than his average back at the Tower. Hulk helped him to his feet and leaned down to place a sweetly delicate kiss on his cheek.
“Couldn’t have done this like six hours ago? I swear I thought I was imagining the vibe.” The other man grinned and blew him a kiss.
“That makes BARF sound positively eloquent.”
“You’re going to have to tell me what it is you’ve figured out. Also stop snarking at JARVIS and wasting our questions man!”
Tony reacts to the news of Ultron's alternative trajectory. With a little help from Steve, Talia and Masdee begin thinking about their future.
“They know.”
“Just tired I guess.”
“I should have kept him here longer. He might not be ready, and he’ll never forgive me if he drops in public, or—” Bruce wrapped two heavy arms around her waist, leaning down to brush a kiss against the back of her neck.
“Aww can it, old man. Not all of us are hopped up on state-sanctioned steroids.” For a few glorious seconds, it was as if no time had passed at all. Steve was back in a DC townhouse, exchanging quips with Sam while he cooked Natasha and Steve breakfast. They’d been running for their lives, and yet it had been one of the happiest periods in Steve’s life after he’d woken up. Sam was kind and smart and capable, and unlike Tony whose presence back then had often left Steve confused and wrong-footed, he’d always known where he stood with Sam.
“Not really. I’m, my head’s too frantic right now. I could go down to the shop for a while unless that violates any vacation laws.”
“College applications,” Steve invents. He doesn’t even feel that guilty about the lie. Peter is, after all, an incredibly conscientious kid. If he isn’t currently working on the applications, he’s probably catching up on homework or something equally studious.
“Sure, sugar cookie. You just get settled back at my feet next to Thor the way we discussed and I’d be happy to feed you.”
“Good. Then we can get started.”
Hearing about the twelve foot high memorial had been enough to make Tony already feel like he was watching the aftermath of his own funeral. This was a sensation only enhanced by stepping off the elevator and into the penthouse to find the Avengers huddled together in the living room. There were none of that morning’s gentle smiles or soft encouragement, not even a hint of cheer about them; even Thor looked like he belonged far more in the universe Tony had came from than their present one as he leaned against the window, staring blankly at the New York skyline.
“I’ll get my own coffee.”
As for what's next: the Peter-centric spin-off will start up in a few weeks. In the meantime, I'm also going to deal with some outstanding AskStrange questions, and I'm strongly considering writing for Marvel Trumps Hate this year as well. You can keep up with any of those developments, plus my other ramblings, through my
With pain dancing across his legs, and then his feet, and even on his nipples a couple of times (and the control it must take for Steve to aim the way he did, avoiding entirely the parts of Tony’s chest that were more fragile from years of harsh treatment), the next dildos were easier to bear. By the fourth, which was ribbed all over and and at least as wide as the average cock, he was harder than he’d ever been in his life. Every hit to his prostate was shattering.
“Talia may not be the only one of our agents who would benefit from this approach. If you’re interested, Masdee, I would like you to run a pilot program through SHIELD. You’d screen potential applicants, both Doms and subs, you’d train them in whatever ways you deem suitable. The program would be entirely under your direction. And I want to stress that while I don’t pretend to be disinterested in yours or Agent Avelino’s potential to gain personally from this arrangement, my aims are larger than that. The world has more to learn from Wakanda than advanced technology.”
There was a period of silence after that. It felt agonizingly long, though a glance at his watch revealed it took close to two minutes.
You remain the best readers anyone could ask for. It's a highlight of my week to chat with you and share new chapters of this verse. Thank you!
Then there had been four call-outs in three days. Compared to Thanos it was minor stuff, really, but always weird or serious enough that local law enforcement requested enhanced backup. One day the contents of some kind of inter-galactic zoo had been let loose in Central Park; Thor had managed to be both their biggest hindrance and their best source of intel for that one, vacillating between gleefully pointing out his childhood favourites and offering useful and often counter-intuitive advice about how to contain them. (Who would have guessed that a giant message-delivering squirrel would turn out to be a huge gossip, easily distracted by the wonders of Tumblr and Reddit?) Another mission had involved the recovery of several stolen pieces of technology from a civilization Coulson had called the Kree. (The stuff had been impressive as hell; Tony was still studying it, and was more grateful very day that the group that had been using it had seemed unaware of half of what it was capable of.)
Tony was still shouting outraged protests about the value of the unexpected in the scientific process by the time Steve was stepping back into the elevator and pressing the button for the garage.
“Anything you want to talk about or ask me?” They were still in bed, though Clint had changed the sheets and added a comforter after the massage. Now that he knew what he was looking for, Tony could feel the edge of the drop, but it was a faint and distant thing compared to what it had been after his disastrous first scene with Bruce. Clint had him wrapped in several thick blankets, and held him close as he tipped a bottle of juice periodically into Tony’s mouth. He’d left the leather cuffs on, too, which Tony was finding he really, really liked. It was concrete proof that this had happened, and that Clint wasn’t trying to run or erase the evidence in the immediate aftermath.
was usually enough to get Bruce riled and ranting about how he looked
Thank you all so much as always for your wonderful comments, kudos, and questions. I love and appreciate hearing from you in any and all forms.
“Stop.”
May exchanged hugs with several of the others, and an especially long one with Steve. Tony seemed as surprised by this as Peter felt, though nothing came of it until midway through dinner.
“Alright, Tones. I can see we’re not going to manage to avoid a punishment in these next few days. Which shouldn’t surprise me, really, I’m a new Dominant for you and you’re under intense stress plus doing the usual boundary-testing stuff, and—alright. C’mere buddy.” Tony had heard the words Rhodey was saying, but they hasn’t really sunk in until his friend had sat down on his bed and patted his lap, the expectation clear. That was around the time Tony had realized he was really, really screwed, because Rhodey had never been the type to decide on something and not follow through. Which hadn’t stopped Tony from trying to persuade him otherwise, but Rhodey was as immovable as ever, and eventually the tension and anticipation of what was coming grew worse than Tony had imagined any punishment could be, so he’d laid himself across Rhodey’s lap. “Pants off and underwear down, Tony.” They’d specifically negotiated punishment protocols when Rhodey had taken over his care, but he'd still whined in embarrassment and fear. Rhodey helped, though, reaching down to undo Tony’s belt and assist him with sliding both them and his pants down to his knees. It hadn’t felt as weird as it should have felt to be bare in front of Rhodey, and when he’d started bringing his hand down on Tony’s ass, all thoughts were pretty much emptied out of his head.
done something out of care brought comfort to Peter. (So like the other Tony again, the way he’d shied away for so long from comfort and affection if it was offered too directly. It was almost eerie.) The kid gaped, his mouth hanging open as the snow in his hair slowly began to melt and drip onto the floor underneath him. Steve wanted to offer a towel, or some of the ample leftovers from their dinner. Hell, there was a hundred things he wanted to do for someone Tony considered his own, but he stayed silent just like the rest of the team, not pretending to be ignorant to the scene in the room but too afraid of stepping in and shattering the thin, shaky ice Tony and this version of his child stood on.
need—”
“I want…” he started and then trailed off, unsure how to verbalize the immensity of what he felt for her, for all of them. She smiled, warm, and barbed with something dangerous, and when she reached out and pressed a hand to his shoulder, he followed the cue and sank gratefully to his knees. Natasha still wore the light, flowing dress she’d had on all afternoon, but she guided him underneath it, allowing his head to press for a moment against her bare legs.The dress was basically sheer at the bottom, but it was enough that he could pretend, just for a moment, that if he couldn’t see the others than they couldn’t see him either. He rested his head against Natasha’s thighs and just breathed in the scent of her. It felt natural after a while to let his mouth wander, finding the green satin of her underwear and licking at her clit. She allowed it to happen for close to a minute, making no noise or movement to either encourage or discourage Tony’s actions, but eventually she tugged him away by the hair. He emerged from the cocoon of her dress calmer and more settled, at least until she directed his gaze to Bucky, who stood a few feet to Tony’s right holding what looked like some kind of sleeve. There was no place for something like that to go but onto Tony’s cock, and still his mind blanked, an attempted retreat from what that would mean.
“Not that. The thing. The D/s thing. I know it was supposed to be with someone else, but I’d like it if you did it.”
If Tony thought regular sceneing involved a lot of negotiation, that was nothing to how much discussion there was before Natasha finally had the paddle in her hand. He was sprawled out with his lower body firmly in her lap, the rest of him draped across the bed. Bruce had taken up a kneeling position by Tony’s head, and he reached out to stroke Tony’s hair as Tony’s body thrummed with a whole host of feelings he was unable to parse.
“Yeah, alright,” he sighed. “Hit me with all the ways this is a terrible idea.” He had zero intention of actually stopping regardless of what his therapist said, but if she needed to outline all the risks and potential downsides to his involvement with Tony just to be able to say she’d done it, Steve would listen.
“Right now I’m focusing on currying favour with some of the lesser systems. I managed to get control over the lights yesterday night, but it was sadly short-lived.”
He arrived home from practice tired but buzzing with the kind of energy he hadn’t felt since—hell, maybe since the bite. Definitely not since Ben had died, when it had felt like accepting his responsibility meant turning away from everything else in his life. Right now he felt, well, like a kid. And even the crappy parts of that, like having no idea what the hell he was doing with his love life, felt kind of awesome, because at least no one lived and died by whether or not Peter ever managed to land a date. For once, he was having the same kind of problems that everyone else was having.
“In his case I’m betting they’re a bit too connected for that.” This, at least, was news to Steve. He wished suddenly that he hadn’t drank the last of the Asgardian mead Thor had on Earth during their vacation. “I think part of the reason he’s clinging to superheroing so hard even though it’s practically tearing his life apart is that it’s the only outlet he’s getting for his Dominant urges. He doesn’t have a sub or a Switch to care for, so he’s taken on a whole borough.”
Bucky hadn’t let himself fully into Dominant headspace at any point that day, but he also hadn’t tried to force himself down to match Tony’s submission, which Steve could recognize now he’d been doing for weeks. It was almost frustratingly obvious in hindsight; Bucky had rarely been around Tony except as a fellow sub, when he’d been certain he posed no threat. If he hadn’t been able to get himself there, he’d made his excuses and left, or stayed out of direct contact with Tony as much as possible.
He tried to keep his support on the silent side, not wanting to overstep in the very first scene they were allowing him to be involved in. And truly, this wasn’t a punishment Rhodey wanted or needed to have a major role in. Unlike the team, Tony had let James be involved in the process of unravelling his orientation. He owed Rhodey nothing in the way of apologies or atonement, which meant that Rhodey could just be there to anchor and protect his friend as he’d always tried to do.
“Just..team never did that stuff with me before. Still getting used to having people. S’nice though.”
“Natasha!”
She opened her eyes, unable to resist such an absurd claim, and found chaos. Natasha had long ago reached a point in her career where she thought every battlefield looked pretty much identical; swap in different baddies, maybe a new weapon or two, sure, but the mayhem and the screams and the smells of fear and death and blood were usually interchangeable to her at this point.
by the throat?” A cold prickle shot down Steve’s spine. In lieu of breaking anything, he began pacing the length of T’Challa’s sitting room.
“Where there was an altercation that left Tony more wounded than I had realized until our check-in the other day. His Steve’s shield partially collapsed his sternum, which had been artificially reconstructed following the surgery to remove the arc reactor. It’s fine,” he rushed to assure the suddenly terrified, “I’ll run follow up scans if and when he’s willing, but other than being cautious with the entire area the same as we were with the other Tony’s reactor, I don’t see any lasting physical damage.”
Today, though, he’s too excited to wait. Tony has recently received a substantial shipment of vibranium from Wakanda, and he’s invited Peter to help reinforce the Tower’s walls and windows with it. Even if Peter still felt as wary toward Tony as he had in the beginning, he thinks he couldn’t have passed up such an opportunity. When Peter had told Ned about it at lunch today, he had been slack-jawed and speechless for close to seven minutes. (In Ned time, this was definitely a world record.)
“This is perhaps a good moment to cover the first item on the agenda,” Phil added. He gestured to Rhodes who was sitting next to him, leaning forward in his seat as if preparing to leave the room at any time. Thor, seated on Rhodes’ other side, inched closer so that their knees were pressed together. (And Thor certainly had the right idea there, Steve thought. If they decided to move forward with James they should really have some kind of welcome event, to make it clear that this change in their relationship was both a wanted and a happy one.) “Tony, we spoke with James last night, and if it’s something you would be interested in, he is open to being included as one of your Dominants, and as a member of this relationship. We realize that the two of you don’t have romantic or sexual interest in one another, but we thought that might actually be reassuring to you in some ways, to know that your right and ability to receive care from a Dominant isn’t in any way conditional on that kind of bond. That would still be true of us, too, of course, but especially given your complicated history with your version of the Avengers, we assumed—”
“…he was boring.”
“General Zabu, may I interrupt?” Much like Coulson, Masdee always gave her full attention to anything or anyone she regarded as worth it, to the point where it was almost unnerving. It took effort, and reliance on his military training, for Steve not to squirm under the weight of her assessment. “Princess Shuri, as well as her brother and the nation of Wakanda, have always been fierce and valuable allies to SHIELD and the Avengers. With your permission, I would like for myself and my agent to accompany your forces back to Wakanda to see this thing through. We would, of course, be under your command and abide by your orders.”
“Do. You. Understand. Me?” Rhodey punctuated each world with a smack, and Tony could feel his skin going from warm pink towards a darker red. The next blow was lower down, closer to his thigh than his ass, and fuck Tony remembered how much thighs stung. Rhodey’s hands might not be as brutal as Natasha’s paddle, but they were hard and unyielding and so much more personal, and Tony was sobbing before he’d even had time to draw a breath.
Despite Natasha’s optimism, Steve’s nightmares grew worse.
“Captain Rogers.”
“It’s only a couple days, buddy. You be good for me in the meantime, yeah? I wanna come back to a healthy, happy sub.” It felt comforting to be reminded that Rhodey would be back, and that he’d still care about Tony’s behaviour in the meantime, though Tony still pouted his way through lunch, at least until Rhodey reached out to flick lightly at his bottom lip. “Put that away and gimme a hug goodbye, brat.”
traditionally been your motto, Mr. Stark.”
“I know, I just…God, Steve, he was so fucking sweet when he went under for me. Just as responsive as Bruce said—the way he reacts to praise especially is just unreal. It’s enough to break your heart and make you want to…” Even Steve had limits, and hearing in detail about exactly what praising Tony made Clint want to do would have been dancing right on the edge of that boundary. He cleared his throat, loudly, and Clint flushed. “I wanted—needed to take care of him. That’s all.”
“Okay, so Tony'll be able to get there within say four hours; we both have permission to use hospital helipads to land. I’ll be a couple hours behind him. You lot will have to do some of the same nonsense you did on the way here to keep the press in the dark, but—”
“I told you we’re good, Brucie. You don’t have to—well, whatever this is.” His ’s’ sounds came out muffled and clumsy from the lollipop, which just gave this whole thing a new level of absurdity.
Office: Stark Tower, Workshop Level B-21
“And you seriously use these any time you have sex?”
He had permission from Coulson to be doing this, now so it wasn’t the team’s privacy it felt like he was breaching, but rather Mark II’s. The signs of his love for them were achingly palpable in the documents. It spread through his notes (
Content Notes: Tony's recapping of his scene with Bucky includes some sexual content. If you are sex-repulsed or just want to give that a miss, skip the second section in italics, as well as the first regular-font paragraph afterward (in which Tony also mentions some of the other things the team got up to during the period we skimmed over.)
Finally, after Tony (who abhorred using honorofics outside scenes) called Phil ‘Sir’ at breakfast only to rush out of the kitchen without finishing his breakfast, Steve felt he had no choice but to intervene. He cornered his submissive in the workshop. To his credit, Tony didn’t pretend to be ignorant of Steve’s motivations for seeking him out.
Tony’s mouth snapped shut, and he quickly reached out and investigated Thor’s arms as he’d been instructed. Steve grinned; for all his worries about being Dominant around Tony, Bucky’s tendency to be a fair but demanding teacher was winning out by a mile. This was going to be fun.
Then Barnes made his sudden, unexpected escape from the room, and Rhodey knew that all of it had been for nothing. Distracting Tony, especially when he was concerned for a loved one, was a damn near impossible task. But Steve handled that too, picked up the strap with steady hands and let none of the concern or distress that had blanketed his expression when Barnes had left enter his voice as he soothed Tony, brought him back to where he needed to be, and finished the punishment off.
He turned his eyes from the screen as the footage rewound and started to play again, focusing his attention instead on Steve. His partner’s eyes never left the image in front of him, not even when Phil sat down and put a hand against his thigh. Phil wasn’t entirely confident Steve realized he was there at all until he spoke.
“I had members of the Iron Legion automatically set to deploy in certain situations. I wasn’t keeping watch on you specifically, I had made an algorithm that determined the best conditions under which to take Toomes in with minimal risk and public attention. Tonight was it.”
He felt nauseous by the time he finally made it through them all. Of course he was glad that Tony and the team had been able to find a balance that allowed Tony the submission he needed without sacrificing any of the wonderful things that made him who he was. But did people seriously believe that if Tony had decided to pursue another option, rejecting his submission while remaining physically and mentally well, Steve would have tried to stop him? Sure he would have been heartbroken, but it wasn’t his decision to make for Tony or for anyone.
“I know you know what take-out is called you troll.”
“Mmm. You like that sweetheart?” Tony nodded, but Steve made a little tutting noise. “Nope. You want it, you’ll ask for it. Just because I’m helping you out a bit doesn’t mean you’re not participating here just like I told you you would be. Say ‘more, please Sir’ if you want the crop again.” Tony tried for a matter of seconds to resist it, tried to just focus on the toy and on being good for Steve, but it was a doomed effort. He begged just as Steve told him to, and felt the immediate lick of the crop on his other thigh.
For the most part, for logistical reasons, the team tends to sleep separately in the Tower. There are certain patterns to those arrangements (Agents Coulson, Romanov and Barton often end up on the same floor, for instance, as do Thor Odinson and Bruce Banner; prior to the other Tony’s death, Steve Rogers most often slept with him, or James Barnes, or both), but there are also many instances where those routines are disturbed for one reason or another. Stark’s bedframe, which he of course designed, does extend and allow for magnetized additions to the mattress for the occasions where most or all members of the team desires to sleep together; they do not do so constantly, in part because the bed takes up almost the entire room, but it does occasionally prove useful.
“It’s awesome to have you involved. Those sketches you forwarded about the new quiver look fantastic.” Tony shifted uncomfortably in his seat as several of the others echoed Clint. Phil went on about how helpful Tony’s input had been for so long that Natasha eventually teased,
“Part of the reason I was so angry last night, Tony, was that you were not only making decisions on all of our behalf, but your explanations were all based on how you assumed we were thinking and feeling. Those assumptions were just so wrong, so against everything we’ve worked so hard to tell you and show you, and that kind of ignorance just isn’t like you. It made me feel…I don’t know, like you hadn’t bothered really listening at all, like everything we’d said and done together meant nothing to you. The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized you were probably talkin’ about yourself and your feelings sort of…through us. Projection, I think my therapist calls it.” It was probably a mark of Tony’s regret and fear that he didn’t take the golden opportunity to mock Steve for trying to psychoanalyze him. Instead, he leaned slightly towards Rhodes as if bracing himself, and Rhodes wrapped a shielding arm around his shoulders. The sight made Steve’s whole body want to wince, even though he knew he’d be counting on their dynamic for his plan to work. “You told me that you’re concerned about the effect on us of having to pretend that you’re the other Tony. You told me that you’re worried we won’t be able to grieve him the way we should. But it isn’t us who hasn’t had much of a chance to really grieve, is it? You had a whole
Hearing it now when it had already been so long was almost his undoing. They’d kept their distance from one another, he and the other Pep, after their breakup. And when he’d seen her after the Snap Pepper had taken to wearing sneakers almost exclusively, always prepared to run or hide or rush to assist a member of the team or a civilian. (She’d worn her Suit, too, and she was just as amazing and incandescent as Rescue as he’d long thought she would be. But Tony would have traded that, would have traded just about anything, to see her in a crisp suit and a towering pair of heels again.)
Tony’s skin was still a hypersensitive wall when Clint abruptly shoved into the bed behind him. It was the first time he’d been able to feel more than the other man’s hand since the whole thing had started, and Tony pressed backward gratefully, making needy, whining sounds that were raw and wrecked even to his own ears.
“Wait, is this one of those in-elevator dates? Because I gotta tell you, while I don’t have a history of claustrophobia, that might be a little bit too much togetherness for me.”
“Captain Rogers. Agent Avelino. Follow me.”
Polyamorous relationships are more common in this world than in our own. There are many instances where a dynamic simply requires more than two people in order for it to function in a healthy and fulfilling way for all participants. As such, these relationships do enjoy more legal and social recognitions.
“Get up.”
“I want hourly updates.”
“There’s a cloaking shield on the glass. They can’t hear or see us,” Rhodey explained, gesturing to the heavily populated lab in front of them where people did indeed appear to be working entirely undisturbed by their dead boss’s presence. “Our Tony found that as soon as the younger techs saw him wandering around, they either got shy and quiet, or they tried to prove themselves and ended up blowing shit up. Sometimes he’d do it intentionally to test them, but when they were doing really delicate work he liked to be able to observe without the risk of disturbing anyone.”
Tony was not only calling Steve, he was seeking Steve out, asking for his help and his company. Steve was grinning like a jackal even as he shoved his arm in the wrong sleeve of his jacket. (Domen was pretty clearly trying not to laugh now, and that didn’t bring his spirits down either. Tony had
, Bruce completed all his usual checks. The next sound Tony heard was the snap of nitrite gloves. None of the team used protection or barriers with one another, and he craned his neck to glare inquiringly back at Bruce.
“Hate. Strong, enduring, passionate hate, Tony.”
That second response also contains some Endgame spoilers and some super crucial divergences from that movie, as well as a stretching of some of the rules the movie establishes surrounding how the Soul Stone works.
Tony jumped. Which meant he had been extremely focused on what he was watching, because JARVIS always announced incoming arrivals to the Tower. (Was it weird if Peter was jealous? He didn’t always like having the full force of Tony’s attention on him, but he also wasn’t wild about the idea of having to fight a whole bunch of other kids for it.)
“Agh, Natalia. We could so use you here—alright, alright, don’t hit me again you beautiful little monstress. My employer wanted the most up-to-date intel about the Avenger’s methods and styles. So that when they send us in for the real target, my troops will be prepared. How is Stark, anyway? Did he miss me?”
“Right now? Just one.”
“No, we shouldn’t, but to be honest I strongly doubt it’ll be an issue. He ranked almost every behaviour associated with Domination as something he wasn’t interested in trying. Some of that might be him trying to please us, so I think giving him a shot at Switching sometime down the road wouldn’t be a bad idea. But he seems to know a lot more about what he doesn’t want than what he does. The document contains very few notes, he mostly stuck to just checking the boxes boxes, but there were several cases, like delivering pain, where he wrote that he didn’t think he could even try being on the Dominant side of the equation.” Bruce frowned thoughtfully.
“Okay? Good to know.”
“We do,” Domen agreed. She tactfully did not point out the slight whine in Steve’s voice, which was probably the best he could have hoped for.
“Sometimes I really don’t like you.” This was not, perhaps, the most appropriate thing to say to a woman who had just submitted for him so recently, but Natasha threw her head back and laughed all the same.
The first half the chapter also features Bucky wearing some visible marks from an entirely consensual scene with Clint and Natasha.
he suddenly remembered Phil asking, and felt his gut clench with equal parts anticipation and a fearful kind of longing.
.) Instead, AIs will complete a capstone project involving an annotated bibliography, a written report about a case study, and a mock security scenario presentation in which the AI will have to respond in real-time to a pre-determined situation relevant to their research.
Oh gosh I'm nervous posting this one. I know so many of you have had strong hopes and feelings about how the bloodwork would go, and I hope that even if this wasn't exactly what you imagined, it still lives up.
“Pretty much right after, I guess.” Steve nodded.
“You gotta eat something, Tones. They’re already freaking out about your weight, and I don’t entirely blame ‘em. Can you pick just one thing for me, one thing that feels the least un-appealing?”
The check-in that Rhodey hustled him downstairs for was, at least, familiar, though Bruce’s punishment was really starting to get to him. Halfway through the process, he grew irritated enough with being treated as untrustworthy that he stopped bothering to answer Bruce at all.
Anyway, they’d made it through that horrible episode, and then it had been Clint, Phil and Natasha’s time to shine as they’d trained Tony to match his posture, body language, and expressions to those of Mark II, right down to the last raise of an eyebrow. (Mark II, apparently, had usually cocked his left while Tony tended to lift his right.)
“Tony, today I had to convince someone that they could not in fact have cured their HPV with a magnet they bought off of Etsy. Believe me when I tell you that whatever you have to say is not going to phase me.”
He liked Steve’s apartments, Tony realized the more he looked around. It had the same general footprint as the floor he had made for his own Steve, but the evidence that Steve actually lived here and thought of it as a home was everywhere. There was an eclectic mix of art on the walls, and surprisingly dainty flatware in the kitchen. A huge easel sat in front of the living room windows next to a set of storage bins that was spilling over with various art supplies. There was also a Nintendo Switch out there, which Tony definitely had questions about. He walked around and snooped, sipping as at his tea as slowly as he could manage until Steve’s replies grew shorter, his voice sounding increasingly clipped. Finally, just as Tony was about to offer to make himself scarce, Steve got to his feet. He started to pace the room, rubbing the back of his neck the way Tony had only seen him do when he was really agitated.
(See the end of the chapter for
AVENGERS ANNOUNCE LEAVE OF ABSENCE
“I…what?” Phil shrugged and leaned over to kiss Steve’s cheek.
“Gonna get yourself spanked if you don’t watch out,” Steve said. “Snarking on Phil about communication? Really?” Tony didn’t response beyond a snicker and a sloppy kiss pressed against the column of Steve’s neck. Steve, meanwhile, focused on attempting to control both his hands and his racing thoughts. He wanted to wait until their upcoming date, wanted so badly to do things right, but God Tony was testing him today. Steve had seen him post-scene before, of course, but the combination of getting regular time in headspace and bonding with another submissive had Tony loose and playful in a way Steve had never seen before. Tony, he realized with a delighted start, was learning to accept his headspace enough that he didn’t mentally check-out or fall asleep once a scene was over. And while non-verbal, dozy Tony had his own charms, this…this was on another level.
The movement of Steve’s hips slowed instead, and even Tony had been alarmed to find himself nearly sobbing. Steve, of course, was almost inconsolable. But at that point, at least, he’d been frantic to give Tony whatever he needed, which included not discussing the matter any more that night. He’d held Tony close and let him sob, stroking his hair and murmuring soothing nonsense.
“Ugggh Dummy if this is some kind of bizarre punishment on your part, believe me I have already learned my lesson and then some, alright? You can stop with the Mary Poppins routine.” Confirming that he was awake, it transpired, was the worst thing Tony could have done. Upon receiving signs of life from Tony, the bot’s noise and activity levels both tripled, and he wheeled gleefully over to Tony and ripped away his covers. “Okay, seriously what is it with you and taking my blankets? Do you have something against my comfort? Oh god Dummy that noise is so much louder right next to my head. JARVIIIIIIS.”
He looked at them, and at the statue of Keera Clayton that sat fifty yards or so away. And he knew.
His head was still spinning from that nearly an hour later when a young woman sprinted toward them. She was both short and lithe, but projected the same sense of carefully-contained power that Tony associated with Natasha. Her long curly hair was tied with a band made of colourful, brightly woven fabrics he recognized to be Wakandan, and she wore a black collar around her neck that his gaze kept  falling on without his permission.

An interesting question which is catching a significant omission on Stark’s part. The events relating to Aldrich Killian and Extremis which occurred in his universe took an extremely different course in the D/s universe. While being extremely candid about other aspects of his background, Stark has not yet shared anything about this period of his life with the team (with the exception of his slip regarding not wanting to fail Ms. Potts ‘again.’)
If Tony had seemed surprised and almost greedy to take in Coulson’s presence, his reaction to Jarvis trumped that by several magnitudes. He wavered on his feet (leading Steve to really realize for the first time that the other man was bleeding from at least one gash on his face, and perhaps elsewhere judging from the awkwardness of his stance) and made this…sound. If asked before today Steve would have confidently claimed to be familiar with every sound Tony Stark was capable of making: the almost beatific joy his tone took on when he monologued to himself (or Bruce) about science, his moans and cries and pleas during sex, the very specific belly-laughter that only his and Clint’s silly inside jokes could seem to coax out of him. He’d heard Tony rage and beg and fight and fuck, and he’d never heard anything like the noise that his own AI’s voice wrenched from the man in front of him.
“Just please go,” he’d grunted. The hopeless depression of Stage Three had seemed best carried out alone. MJ had not agreed.
Content Notes for this chapter: Steve encounters a submissive whose continued employment is conditional on her acceptance of some degree of submission in her private life. (We're not given a specific reason for her rejection of her headspace, but we do know that she's not fully comfortable with it, and is being forced per the terms of a mandatory wellness policy to find some kind of an outlet because prolonged sub/dom deprivation can seriously impact one's overall health in this universe. The same would be expected of a dom in a similar situation, as we sort of saw with Steve last chapter.) This is mainly a world-building scene, though there are some parallels with the now-deceased version of Tony. So if you wan to skip it, stop reading at the paragraph beginning "Talia. What
“There’s a couple trends here, and while I didn’t think they were related at first, I’m starting to believe otherwise. The first is that you’re increasingly seeking out correction in the form of punishment. Since I know punishment is something you have mixed feelings about—”
!” Steve shouted. His voice echoed through the cavernous living room, his own anger and hurt and fearful hope bouncing off the walls and furniture and back at Steve. Perhaps he was a terrible pseudo-parent for being unable to put his own reactions aside. It certainly wouldn’t be the first mistake he’d made with the kid. But he couldn’t move a single foot away from his spot until he knew for sure just what this meant.
“Have you eaten?” Peter whirled in surprise, as if he’d been entirely unaware of Steve’s presence. (That was oddly reassuring. The kid clearly wasn’t flustered by the fame and mythos that surrounded Steve or the rest of the team. The risk that he’d end up bonding more closely with someone besides Tony appeared to be irrelevant.) Natasha was already in motion as they spoke, gathering a heaping plate full of leftovers from dinner; luckily, it had been Tony’s night to help cook, so the meal of steak, green beans, potatoes and salad was more nutritious than the standard take-out that the team relied on for sustenance far too often. Peter’s wide, slightly wary eyes never left Steve’s face, but Steve could see the way he began to orient himself toward the living room’s low table in anticipation of the meal. (Yeah, the kid was definitely hungry. Steve wondered how often he’d eaten enough to actually be full after his transformation. If his metabolism was even half of what Steve or Bucky’s was, probably never.)
(See the end of the chapter for
“’s fine. Just…again, Pep, please.” She frowned, pursing her lips in an expression that felt distinct from the numerous versions of disapproval he’d seen in his own world. (But then, Pepper and Tony had never been romantically involved in this universe. Perhaps this was what Pepper looked like when Tony screwed up relationships that didn’t involve her—all the sadness, but none of the anger and disappointment that came up when it was her he was hurting.) Eventually, she sighed and began her explanation again from the beginning.
“Tony was never trained to be ashamed of his submission,” Bucky had said early on in the process. “He can be conflicted about particular scenes or tools sometimes, but that’s not ultimately about the submission itself. He’s…if anything, his biggest fear is people being ashamed or reluctant to love him. The worst thing we could do is make the collar small and easy to hide.”
“There were bombs onboard,” he snapped.
“Moritifed,” Steve grinned, unable to help himself. Because even despite his embarrassment, which was no doubt very much sincere, Tony was practically alight with the pleasure that only a submissive who knew right down into their bones that they had pleased their Dominant (or Dominants, in this case) could exude. Even if his mind was still catching up and would likely be working through it for some time, some part of Tony had already accepted what had happened enough to take pride in himself.
“How’re your breathing and the chest pain today?”
to you then we don’t have to—”
“Oh yeah? What about?”
As the third ball found a space next to its mates, Steve’s shoulders slumped. His body pitched forward, colliding with Phil’s with too much strength and too little control. Phil staggered under his weight, but quickly adjusted his bearing so that he could grip Steve around the shoulders in a fierce hug, the kind that would have left bruises were it not Captain America in his arms.
A heaviness settled on Tony. It wasn’t learning that Howard had chose him over Steve and immediately regretted it; that was actually a relief. Tony had been doomed to disappoint Howard Stark before he had ever even been born. It was nothing he could ever have controlled or fixed if he’d just said or done something different. For once, Tony’s Daddy issues were not even close to his biggest problem.
“I’m sure I speak for everyone here when I say we’re just so thrilled to have you back Mr. Stark—Tony, if I may,” Fletcher said. Tony nodded his head again. “Truthfully, we are so grateful for your return; your legacy is one we treat with gravity and care, but I must confess we didn’t always agree on the best methods of going about securing it.” He ‘confessed’ to
in the in the simpering, honeyed tones of an adult playing at being a guilty child, and Tony’s teeth felt like they were about to start rotting in his gums. Idly, he wondered whether this long-game thing was really the way to go when there were so many excellent assassins in the Tower.
“I do, I swear, but the timing was not any of our first choices. Circumstances took that aspect of it out of our hands.”
MJ was a good bro. She wanted this noted in the annals of superhero history not only because women in those stories still tended to get reduced to flat, single-dimensional damsels in distress, but also because it was true, damn it! She had never gotten on Peter’s case about his spider-related extracurriculars, and never forced him to manage her own complex feelings about the likelihood of her then-boyfriend’s short, trauma-filled lifespan. Furthermore, she had spent the majority of the night holding her ex as he alternated between sobbing for Tony Stark and vomiting. Spectacularly. Repeatedly. And, one time, all over her shoes.
“Tony knows?”
“You made that?” Natasha nodded tightly.
me. Said I wasn’t the only one ‘cursed with knowledge.”
“He is,” Bruce agreed. The air of slightly distant remove that he tended to play at was noticeably undermined by the almost strained sound in his voice.
“Will you stay? And maybe can we—I mean this bed is fine for a short term stay, but three days on it has been a little much.” Thor hoisted Tony so easily into his arms that it would undoubtedly have been embarrassing if he hadn’t been almost asleep already by the time he was set down on the larger mattress in the centre of the room.
“Thank you for listening to me. I know that must have been frustrating—”
Peter delayed long enough to pick up the sound of an incoming Quinjet and then began webbing his way toward Avengers Tower. Tony kept the line open between them, but he wasn’t speaking to Peter. He appeared to be doing about five other things at once, including preparations for locking down Stark Industries and Avengers Tower, doubling security at the hospital where May worked, speaking to a man Peter thought might be the director of the CIA, and making real-time adjustments to the tech the SHIELD team at the scene was using. Figuring the last thing Tony needed was another distraction, Peter had offered to hang up, but Tony had cut CIA guy off mid-sentence to growl,“Don’t you
It had been a good long while since Steve had actually been present for one of Bruce's check-ins. He’d been there for most of Bucky’s at the beginning, before Bucky trusted himself to be alone with any members of the team without Steve present, but generally they were something private Bruce shared with the team’s sub and Switches. Steve had forgotten how beautiful it was to witness, the evidence of comfort and routine saturating every careful touch. And as Steve had long suspected, Tony eased to it beautifully. Despite the numerous and committed protests he had made about his positive responses to check-ins, the evidence of this morning’s upset was already bleeding away under Bruce’s initial pass at his neck, shoulders and upper back.
deserve to have their legs almost torn off.” Talia just smirked and lounged extravagantly in her seat.
So when upwards of two hundred messages were sitting in his highest priority inbox, the one typically reserved for Avengers-level threats, Steve knew his morning was going to take a turn for the worse. He took a long gulp of coffee, sat back in his chair and opened the most recent one.
He’d thought that was what he wanted today when he’d sought Clint out after a particularly frustrating day at SI. And when Clint had started a scene pretty clearly designed to play with Tony’s complex but intense humiliation kink, it had seemed like the right choice. At least until Clint had implied that he’d probably use a dildo on himself rather than ride Tony the way he’d promised.
Tony fell asleep to JARVIS’s voice in his ear, and woke to a sharp piece of metal jabbing roughly at his left forearm.
“I. I have his exploratory contract, and the combined notes we’ve made about his submission so far. It’s—well, it’s a lot, even with all of the sexual material blacked out. Please call or text if you have questions or if you need
With JARVIS’s help, creating the actual system turned out to be the easy part. What Phil hadn’t anticipated about this plan was the fact that it effectively turned him into the team’s priest/therapist/confidante as it pertained to all things regarding Tony Stark’s other (far inferior, they had universally decided) team.
“Well, I suppose we could both eat ‘em then, and I’ll answer your questions as long as the muffins hold out. I’m not getting a pissed off Bruce
Sam let the silence between them linger, his gradually slowing breathing on the other end the only indication he hadn’t just disconnected the call entirely. Not so long ago Steve wouldn’t have been able to sit in it, he would have pressed and prodded until Sam either forgave him or exploded. It was still hard, and patience would never be his strong suit, but it was impossible to argue with the results when giving Tony the space he’d asked for had ended so positively for both of them just a few hours prior.
Even through his slight annoyance and frustration, Steve felt a sense of deep satisfaction. The park had been one of the only places in the city Steve actually liked when he’d first woken up, and now Tony seemed to have grown attached in much the same way. He spared a longing thought for saying yes, but between the amount of reading he still had to do plus his whole plan to cut down on his time with Tony until he felt only friendly things toward the guy…it would be a terrible idea.
After nearly two years of self-neglect and denial, the instinct to deny JARVIS’s description of the situation was strong. Surely this wasn’t top-drop, Steve was just a bit foggy this morning, that’s all, and maybe he should have eaten a bit more before he went to bed. His eyes found the arc reactor again, the memory of Tony handing it to him with so much trust and bravery just as powerful as it had been then. (Tony trusted Steve. He couldn’t betray that now by lying, not even if the thought of waking his peacefully sleeping lover made Steve ache all over with shame and regret.)
“Oh, hi Steve, you’re early.”
“Every four weeks, Dummy, You, and Butterfingers receive comprehensive maintenance.” There was a damn lot that JARVIS wasn’t saying, but J had always been a bit of a withholding diva when he was mad at Tony, and a part of Tony was still so thrilled by the fact that there was a JARVIS around in this universe to be pissed at him that he didn’t bother arguing. (And, given that it took him two tries to remember where on his body socks belonged, he didn’t feel it was a battle of wits he was likely to win anyway.)
that? Are you…you’re not, like, collecting powered kids or something, right? Because that would be messed up.”
“You did seem to very genuinely enjoy the bondage—the ritual, the technique, all of that seemed right up your alley.” Tony nodded. Playing with the rope had been fun, and he was already excited to learn to do more advanced stuff with it. “At times, though, it felt almost like you were offering it to Thor, and to Bucky to a lesser extent, more as an act of service than one of Domination.”
It was frightening, and entirely unfair, how quickly Sam could switch gears from goofy pal to terrifyingly insightful former therapist. Had he not just been in the middle of a fight over the remote control?
being fed and Bruce had just—Natasha silenced him with a look, but he still allowed himself a single discontented grumble.
“I think it’s a bit too late for that,” Peter sighed. (Tony was going to stamp that hopelessness out of the kid if it was the very last thing he did.)
“Or we could both stay.”
“Sir, lockdown of the workshop has been temporarily overridden. Shall I—” Tony had been sprawled across the floor of the workshop for what must have been close to three hours, or so the pain in his muscles as he scrambled abruptly to his feet suggested. His sense of time had gone a little bit sideways since the…episode with Rogers.
“Is it, though? I mean, this stuff,” he gestures at the sodden pile of documents on the desk with ink-covered hands, “this is all my life is going to be from now on. I’m Spider-Man. I’ll live that way. I’ll die that way, probably young and tragically. I won’t do anything else in between, because everyone knows who I am, so that means finishing high school’s out. College too, by the way, to answer your question. The only places who want to take me now are just using me. Some for my name, some for Tony’s. Some of them for both. So forgive me if spilling energy drink on the only semblance of a future I—HEY!”
Oh team. This was a tough and emotional one to write. I truly hope a good read even when it might have hurt.
As always, if you have any questions or concerns before or after reading, feel free to let me know.
It had been..weird to be on the other side of all of it. Thor had been so incredibly sweet and responsive, the best submissive a first-timer could have asked for, and there had been something heady and exciting about having someone that powerful under his control, happy to be moved and touched and denied all at Tony’s leisure. But Tony spent a lot of the scene with the uneasy feeling of someone sneaking a glance at an opposing team’s playbook during the big game.
He was still grinning to himself when he stepped into the conference room. Pepper was already there, dressed down in a pair of jeans and a long-sleeved salmon shirt. She absolutely refused to abide by popular advice to avoid pink with her hair colour, and she fucking rocked the shade every time. She had already cleared a path for Dummy around the table, too; he’d gotten himself good and trapped in a corner the last time he’d followed Tony up here for one of their meetings. They hugged while the bot settled himself smugly at the head of the table like the damn chairman of the board.
Bruce didn’t immediately jump into diagnosing or questioning Tony, though. He began moving through the quiet, familiar motions of making himself a cup of tea; Tony watched, comforted by the routine, and embarrassingly eager to prepare for being able to make Bruce’s tea for him one day with the same precision that the others could make Tony’s coffee. He got the sense that Bruce was still observing him even through this, but he didn’t speak again until he was sitting down at the table across from Tony, a steaming cup of Kashmiri Chai in his hand.
He aimed a sideways grin at Bruce and held out the wooden spoon in his hand.
And for the record, I am both willfully obtuse and sadistic.
Dr. Strange replied:
Content Notes: CNOW (the not-so-friendly-neighbourhood bigots who are against trans-orientations and everything but an embrace of 'natural' orientation) are featured in this chapter. We don't hear directly from anyone in the organization, but it still might be worth skipping if this is a trigger area for you.
“It…from everything I saw, it sounds like it was fast. Maybe even painless. I’ve seen Wanda’s magic up close—”
For seconds that felt like hours, he watched Peter writhe on the floor. Steve imagined how the sight would have devastated Tony, what the man he loved would have given to cradle his child, soothe his tears and his pain. But it wasn’t just Tony he saw in Peter now. In the boy’s misdirected anger, his sorrow, his inability to even comprehend the scale of his own loss, Steve could see himself reflected just as clearly as when he’d actually battled his younger counterpart. Tony would never have wanted that for Peter, would never have wished for all the worst parts of Steve to take over his son.
For so long, SHIELD HQ had been the stuff of Peter’s nightmares. He’d always assumed that if he ended up here he would be facing hours of interrogation, maybe even disappearing off into the Fridge or one of the other prisons for enhanced people, never to be heard from again. In his mind, it had been a cold, sterile space full of stuffy people in suits who all resembled the version of Captain America Peter had grown up knowing from gym PSAs.
, his brain working the way it could when unencumbered by fear or self-hatred or anything. When a hand he recognized immediately as Bruce’s trailed lazily up Tony’s calf, Tony tipped his head back and sighed blissfully.
“Cap—err, is it Major?” Steve had had slightly higher hopes for Jordan, he really had. No one had anything but absolutely glowing praise for the man, a six foot three category eight dominant from Kansas who was looking to enlist with SHIELD straight out of college. But this was why he agreed whole-heartedly with the HR people that it was important he be here for at least a part of the intake interviews: it wasn’t always easy to predict who would suddenly turn overtly fannish when confronted with Steve.
Guest Speaker: Dr. Helen Cho
“Make sure to have it sent in multiple shipments, and have some of them mislabelled. We don’t know how far into SI Fletcher’s people have infiltrated and we don’t want to raise any flags that don’t have to be raised,” Steve added.
Peter rocked back on his heels. He’d expected a lot of things from Tony in this conversation. Platitudes about his age, definitely, paired with not-so-subtle reminders that Tony had already faced the loss of another version of him. Just as it had months before when Tony had baldly announced he was not from this universe, his willingness to lay it all out in front of Peter was enough to stop him cold. If Tony was willing to treat him like a peer, someone who deserved explanation and justification, how could Peter continue to respond by acting like the child he had just been insisting he didn’t deserve to be treated as? (It was as calming as it was annoying.)
“What’s…what’s option two?”
The first portion of the contract focused on things that weren’t even sexual, and which required a level of honesty and vulnerability that Tony didn’t know if he’d ever be able to just offer up on a plate. It asked about things like recent injuries, chronic pain, triggers, and also about his preferences with non-sexual, daily kinds of things like whether or not Tony was okay with being touched without warning or using the washroom in view of another person. He hadn’t filled any of that out yet, and didn’t know if he ever would.
“It’s okay if you’re not ready for this. I can still go get Bruce or Nat or basically anyone else, really. No hard feelings.”
“The journalling isn’t designed to get you to work through your problems all on your own, Steve; otherwise you’d have no need for me. It’s just a place to start, and an opportunity to push past some of the initial temptation to resist or sabotage the process that you seem to experience when asked something you aren’t expecting.”
After the other Tony had died, Steve had had vivid fantasies about exactly this scene: the chance to lay in bed and watch his lover for just a little longer, commit even more of his mannerisms and expressions to his already encyclopedic memory of all things Tony. Dr. Domen, though, had worked hard to make him see that the sharpness of his memories of Tony, their refusal to fade, was not just a product of the serum. It had been another symptom of Steve’s unconscious efforts to structure the very counters of his mind around the fantasy of being able to keep Tony alive and present.
“Good. Yes. Hi. Kente cloth was developed by which cultural group?” Peter waited a few seconds for the multiple-choice options. The girl grinned. Undoubtedly she wanted to make him look like an idiot, and she would more than likely succeed. However, he was pretty sure he knew this one, so at least he’d have some dignity left when this was over.
“Hulk sit on Tony until he give answers?”
Ah, excellent factual inquiries. (Well, at least to start.) The D/s universe is nearing the second anniversary of the death of their Tony Stark.
Bucky knew what Steve was planning. Maybe he wasn’t clear on all the details, but outside of his Winter Soldier persona, Bucky wasn’t a subtle man. His disapproval had been just as easy to spot as the signs of his recent and extremely happy reunion with Sam. (Bucky wanted a future, a life here. He didn’t need Steve anymore, didn’t deserve to be weighted down by Steve’s stagnant refusal to move forward.)
He was still careful with Clint, of course; Steve was a lot of things he could barely recognize these days, but negligent had never been one of them. He prepped Clint with care, cautious of the impact his size and strength even as Clint gave every signal that he was ready, working his hips to rock back into the dildo and clawing at the sheets. When he finally pushed his way into Clint, he murmured all of the things he knew Clint needed to hear, a gentle medley of guidance and encouragement and praise. (Tony would have hated it. At least until he was far down enough to be receptive; then, like the flick of a switch, he’d be so desperate for approval that it broke Steve’s fucking heart. Every time.) When the time came for aftercare, he bathed the lax, content body of his teammate, hand fed him, and carefully tended to minor abrasions, most of which were leftover from battle, not their scene. Then he tucked Clint into Steve’s own bed. Clint fell asleep warm, secure and likely completely unaware that Steve’s arms still ached to hold someone else entirely.
“Taskmaster appears to be unconscious. His team has blown a hole in the side of the building and escaped with him on—ugh, I think they have cloned copies of our sky cycles, Coulson. Avengers emerging now…Black Widow is signalling for a med-evac. Green team, move in.”
Tony returns to Malibu, and finds some unexpected ways to work through his still-conflicted feelings.
Tony’s knees twinged for the fourth time in the last hour, and he groaned in frustration, bending down to try to rub some of the soreness out and vowing that he would take some time off from experimenting with this whole submissive kneeling thing. The others made it look so easy, staying in the same position for hours at a time. But however else Tony might be considering adapting to the orientational dynamics here (maybe, possibly), the pain was an important reminder that the distinctions between he and the people in this universe still occasionally had a very material impact on what submission could look like.
denotes dominants (with 10 representing someone exclusively inclined toward domination)
In the twenty or so minutes it took for the team to break and then agree on teams and an objective for the exercise, Tony had mastered the obstacle course program and was already drooling over the possibilities.
He’d gotten kind of carried away, he supposed. Very little tended to stop Tony’s mind from its constant replay of his every mistake and anxiety, and while the kneeling wasn’t a magical cure in that regard, it did tend to take the flow of such thoughts from a sea of steady, crashing waves to more of an occasional trickle. The most recent time he’d actually managed to fall asleep kneeling, which was how he’d ended up staying in the position for far too long and limping his way through the next several days.
Last night with Bruce, even to some extent with Rhodey, he’d struggled not to hide from this kind of scrutiny. Tony didn’t want to think very hard about the stories etched on his skin. The large and barely-healed scar from Thanos stabbing him with a piece of his own damn suit was still a vivid, angry red in some places; he’d ripped his stitches and flirted with infection frequently after the Snap. The marks from the impact of Steve’s shield in Siberia were higher, and more faded, but still clearly visible. Higher still was the neat incision from the surgery to extract the shrapnel and the original arc reactor; underneath, the cluster of jagged, colourless blemishes, evidence of Yinsen’s frantic efforts to save Tony’s life. And that was just his chest.
“Please what?” Bruce gritted out. His grip on the table intensified, while the other hesitated in mid-air before landing in Tony’s hair, tightening almost immediately to pull at Tony’s curls. The hint of pain actually helped, made it somewhat easier to focus past the haze of desperation that had gripped him, at least enough to ask for what he wanted.
“If you don’t stop trying to rub off on that bench I’ll be taking the decision out of your hands Tony, and I assure you that you will not be wildly fond of the option I select.” Immediately, he stilled his hips, panting slightly. “Good. Now what’s it going to be? Milking now, or punishment and orgasm later?”
“I’ve only woken up seventy years in the future once, Dr. Domen,” he volleyed back, genuinely confused by the observation. She paused midway through a sip of water she’d been taking, almost like she was choking back a laugh.
Steve had been back at SHIELD HQ for less than two hours, and he was already wishing he had done as Natasha had suggested and taken an official leave. The first forty minutes or so, which he’d spent checking in with his deputies and watching an elaborate training exercise Phil, Clint and Natasha had designed for the new agents, were fine. It was a damn relief to be out of the Tower, to be thinking of something other than Tony and therapy and all the ways that the new version of the man was already changing everything.
Tony, which—” Bucky growled, low and guttural, an echo of the ugly feeling that that message had left churning in Phil’s gut. And when Bucky spoked, the clipped, harsh tone of his voice suggested hints of the Solider.
While I hesitate to immerse myself too deeply in Stark’s psyche, I would suggest that all current evidence indicates that not only does Stark take joy in this, but there is nothing quiet about it.
“I want the device Taskmaster had cloned from Obie. I don’t want it held by SHIELD. I want to destroy it by my own hands.” Coulson inclined his head, the defensive response Tony had anticipated about this version of SHIELD being different from his own never passing his lips. “And I…I need someone else to handle Steve tonight.” Coulson rose to his full height, and Tony winced at how that must have sounded. “No, it’s not…he didn’t do anything wrong or-or pressure me or something. But he had to watch me fake-die today, and I can tell how much it fucked with him. He…even I can feel how much he needs his headspace, and while I would have no real problem with going down for him right now,” understatement of the century, “he would be upset about it later. He’s been very clear about wanting a date before we scene, especially if it involves anything sexual.”
“Come on Sugar Cookie. I bet we can talk Rhodes here into making us one of those big breakfasts you’ve said he’s famous for. Everything will look a little better after some food, I promise.”
“Sir—Sirrrr, please, more, that can’t be all, you can’t—”
Thank you as always for the comments, kudos, and questions, and please keep them coming! Talking to all of you about this verse is such a delight and a huge motivation to keep scribbling away.
So to say that Steve was surprised when his eyes fell upon his agent and found a delicate blush painting the tips of her cheekbones…that would be rather an understatement.
In a matter of hours, Tony and Talia were thick as thieves. Masdee feigned annoyance at the frequent absence of her partner over the days that followed, but Steve knew her well enough by now to be able to recognize the joy and pride as she watched her submissive bond so quickly and easily with another sub. Not so long ago Talia likely would have rejected a friendship with Tony as a reflex, too afraid of seeing any of herself reflected back in someone who shared her orientation. Now they were damn near giggling over some shared joke and swapping tools with the ease of people who had known each other for years rather than a matter of days. Steve watched from the window and, after a moment of hesitation, glanced at Masdee.
He’d been absolutely foolish to let it get this bad. Masdee had warned him, had tried to send him home days ago, but then the Ssenjovu brothers had broken the perimeter of the palace. They’d gotten nowhere near Shuri, but T’Challa’s rage had been nearly beyond reason. It had taken Steve and several members of the dora to prevent him from ripping the men apart in their holding cells. And then there had been the details of the exchange program to finalize, and several meetings with other Wakandan officials that the government had asked Steve to take in exchange for promises to fast-track said program. Steve hadn’t fully realized just how severe the dep had gotten until Talia had stormed into his rooms and begun throwing his belongings haphazardly into his duffle bag.
“If there was, it was not concentrated enough to be measurable. This suggests that Mr. Stark is or will eventually be, like his counterpart, a low-ranked submissive. However, it is possible that his body has just been delayed in its production of Dominin, or that it is rising at a slower rate.” Rhodey nodded thoughtfully, and Chimva seemed to struggle with herself for a moment before speaking again. “At this point my real concern is the cortisol. His body is under significant stress. It is attempting to balance the demands of two unique physiologies, one of which is going through what is essentially a slower and less intensive form of puberty. I realize that Mr. Stark’s decision to leave his Dominants in the dark is his own, and I would not violate doctor-patient confidentiality unless matters grew far more dire, but he will likely require focused and dedicated care while his body and mind adjust. I do not believe his partners will be capable of providing what he needs without matters being fully explained to them.”

“So, just to recap.” Clint was drawling in that way that most people read as amused or even callous, but which the team had long ago learned meant he was attempting to mask the strength of an emotional response (usually anger, but sometimes fear made Clint sound this way too.) “Tony was accidentally taken into some version headspace, maybe for the first time in his life, and then promptly abandoned. He immediately proceeded to drop, as did Bruce I can only assume.” Bruce nodded tightly, all the muscles at his jaw clenched. “Phil kind of accidentally brought Tony out of the drop a bit, but he’s still upset enough by the whole thing that he’s hiding from all of us. Oh and he may or may not have been experimenting with other forms of submission for days now, without anyone but Nat figuring it out.”
And there it was. The real cause behind Tony’s resistance, the very thing Clint had been digging for. He let Tony stew for a good half minute as he retrieved the bag of food from Steve’s  feet, plated the sandwiches and handed one of the plates to Steve himself.
