“See, that’s just weird,” Dean said. “Why would you name your kids after angels when you don’t go to church?”
Bobby was still in the workshop on Sunday, Dean wandering down to see if there was anything he could do to help. Bobby had chased him back out and told him to make the most of his day off. From a glance Dean could see that Bobby was near completing the Cadillac. Dean was definitely going to have to make Bobby something nice to celebrate when he finished. He wondered how often Bobby got big jobs like this and if it would be a regular occurrence.
“And what is that reason?” Castiel asked.
“We’ve had customers drop entire trays of drinks,” Kali said.
“No, I don’t,” Bobby agreed. “I’m sorry you had to go through all that.”
“Trust me, you wouldn’t be able to move away far enough,” Bobby said. “They’ve got their claws in everywhere.”
“Not yet,” Dean said. “Meeting Cas at Benny’s. Gabriel kind of insisted we still go.”
“Lovely couple from my understanding,” Bobby said. “Childless though. The mother was a teacher at Anna’s school. Probably how she got into her head.”
“The host is not a threat,” Castiel said.
“Yeah, I can do that,” Sam said. “That’d work.”
she do?” Dean asked.
The first rush came and went, Dean keeping up with the orders without too much hassle. He was definitely getting faster at serving now although he still had to concentrate to make sure he was doing the right thing. He was looking at the cheat sheet a lot less now as he picked up on the terminology of the different sizes and strengths.
“Why did you run away?” Dean asked.
“Good?” Castiel asked.
“So what’s her new family like?” Dean asked. “Why’d she pick them?”
“Yeap,” Gabriel said. “Just keep doing what you’re doing. You’ll be fine.” He glanced at his watch, eyebrows rising. “And I better skedaddle otherwise the fire breathing goddess will be on
She nodded. “Special orders. I work the counter for pick up while Gabriel and the rest of the workers make the sweets. People have specific pick up times so it’s going to be fairly tight shifts.”
“So he said,” Dean said. “Wants to top his class and graduate with honours, then get his Masters and Doctorate.”
“Like you said – could be the same guy,” Dean said.
Dean nodded. “I figure it’s still a bit early.”
“No,” Dean answered, walking over to him and resting his hands on Castiel’s hips. “Not tonight.”
After he’d set up the tables and checked the supplies Kali beckoned him over.
“Be nice to have a college fund though,” Sam said. “Did you know Dad spent all of ours?”
“It’s just not on my priority list,” Dean said. “Right now I’m focussed on working.”
Castiel nodded and did so, Dean watching as he folded them and hooked them over the back of one of the chairs. Dean waited for him to say something as he removed his own shoes.
A truck passing the motel jerked Dean out of his slumber. He blinked the sleep from his eyes, taking in the light of the room and knowing it was morning. He paused for a moment as he realised he was wrapped around something warm, the memories of the night before coming back to him. He smiled, snuggling deeper against Castiel’s chest and feeling a hand come up to stroke his hair.
“I think we all do,” Gabriel said. “Anyway, I’ll start you on the easy drinks. Nothing too fancy for your first week.”
“And I thought I was working hard,” Dean said. “That sounds like a nightmare. Maybe we shouldn’t meet on Saturday’s if he’s schedule is so packed.”
“Cas took me to an awesome pie bakery,” Dean said. “They had a platter of samplers. It was Heaven. Then we caught a movie, had dinner, and then went back to the motel.”
“He seemed fine to me,” Dean said. “When we talked, I mean.”
“That is to be expected,” Castiel said. “I would welcome death.”
Dean’s toast popped up, distracting him. He glared at Sam as he went to retrieve it. Dean finished making his breakfast as Sam and Eileen joined them in the kitchen, Dean making himself and Castiel cups of coffee. He set the mug down in front of where Castiel was now seated at the table before taking the place next to him and going about eating his breakfast. Sam and Eileen soon joined them with their own breakfast and drinks, sitting across from them.
“How it works for a lot of people,” she said. “Anyway you better unlock the front door. It’s time to open.”
“That’s what money does to you,” Bobby said. “If I’ve got to give Gabriel and Castiel anything it’s that they’ve actually worked a hard day. Can’t say the same for most of the family.”
“No, he doesn’t,” Dean said. “He even changed his phone number.”
Sam dropped into a seat and rubbed his eyes, feeling the stubble on his face. He really needed to shave. He just hadn’t had the energy to do it. He knew he must look shaggy with a beard. Then again no one had seen him in a while. His entire time had been taken up with running the search for Metatron and Gadreel in an attempt to find Castiel’s grace. Sam hadn’t been hunting in months. Not since Dean had disappeared.
Dean shook his head, beginning to roll his hips as he moved in Castiel’s lap. The slick made the slide easy. Dean licked his lips again, running his fingers through Castiel’s hair. This wasn’t the way he had imagined their first time going but he wasn’t complaining. He began to ride Castiel in earnest, shifting until Castiel began brushing against the sweet spot inside him.
“I am,” Dean said.
Dean slid out of his seat, reaching into his back pocket and pulling out the little box he’d hidden there that morning. He’d been carrying it around in secret in his bag for some time now. He opened it, kneeling next to Castiel and holding it out. “Castiel, will you marry me?”
“I guess times change,” Dean said.
“I can imagine,” Dean said. “Were you allowed to play or did the house have to be quiet?”
Dean frowned.
“Do you remember Anton?” Crowley said. “Short guy. Glasses. About yay high.” He gestured with his hands at about Dean’s shoulder height.
“Whose?”
Dean gently put the cups down, flicking his gaze to Castiel as he pushed the buttons to open the till. The man threw a bag at him.
Gabriel sighed. “Okay, that’s reasonable. I’ll give you that one. But why did you keep meeting her?”
“Hopefully the way most alphas react when they go into rut,” Dean said. He pointed to his neck. “Should give me a little mark right here.”
Dena frowned. “Why?”
“As a spoilt brat,” Bobby countered.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “While Kali was here?”
“So the host dies either way,” Sam said. “It’s still not too late to terminate the pregnancy.”
“She says she’s worried about Hannah and Samandriel,” Dean said.
“I have to agree,” Castiel said. “It is quite pleasurable.”
“Yeah, I am,” Dean said. He stepped toward the door. “Anyway you should probably let Gabriel know I dropped that stuff in.”
“Dean,” Castiel said flatly.
It took Dean a week just to pick up a lead on the guy. Dean had started at the warehouse in Brooklyn, using the information he garnered there to pick up the trail. It had taken him across New York and to a few more warehouses before Dean began to realise how deep into the system this guy actually was.
“And you would know, wouldn’t you,” Dean said, glaring at him. “You took all those souls and proclaimed yourself God. Bit you in the ass, didn’t it.”
She nodded. “You’ve done it before.”
“Metatron is not leaving Heaven,” she said.
“Nice,” Dean said. “What they doing?”
Dean raised a brow. “If you had to pick a label what would it be?”
“Yeah,” Dean said. It was an obvious answer. There was no way in hell he was going anywhere with Castiel with his ear like that.
“It is tasty,” Castiel said. “What flavour is it?”
“Nice,” Dean said. “That’s one less thing to worry about.”
“Why?” Gabriel asked, eyes narrowing. “You offering?”
Castiel nodded. “I have a chapter I need to read before Monday.”
“You look bad,” Castiel said, eyeing him.
“How did Anna take it when you rejected her, anyway?” Gabriel asked.
“I can be very persuasive,” Dean said with a smirk.
“Gabriel is very business minded,” Kali said. “Even if it doesn’t appear that way at times.”
“Always,” she said. “Either way it’s a busy few weekends. And the extra business at the sweet shop means extra business at the coffee shop.”
“Nobody’s under my skin,” Dean said. “I’m just trying to get a lay of the land.”
“Turns out one of my people is double crossing me,” Crowley said. “Unfortunately they’ve gone to ground.”
“You were always walking down a dangerous road with him, Crowley,” Castiel said. “He wishes you dead.”
“How do I even know he’s still alive?” Sam asked. “You could be lying to me.”
“The First Blade,” Sam said. “With the Mark it’s corrupting him.”
“So he’s on the opposite end of the spectrum to myself,” Castiel said.
“Why are you telling me this?” The man said.
“Sick Juliet on them,” Crowley said. “She’s trained to get through most demon warding. Otherwise just burn the bloody house down.”
“Crowley wanted you dead on day one.”
“You mentioned you have a brother,” Kali said. “Any other family.”
“We should probably report the robbery, yes,” Castiel agreed.
Like the weekend before there wasn’t really any rushes, but rather an uneven stream of customers. They came in waves more than anything, particularly around certain times on the clock Dean noted. He wondered if it was connected to the pickup times at the Sugar Heaven. Nevertheless he kept working, taking advantage of the times when the store was empty to clean and restock.
“That’s my part done,” Crowley said. “I’ll leave you to it.”
“Trainee,” Dean reminded him as he walked up to the counter. “So who’s showing me the ropes?”
“Good genes,” Gabriel said with a smile. “Get them from my mother.”
“I still regret that,” Castiel admitted.
Dean sighed. He knew that Castiel was right but that still didn’t change things. It was his fault that things had happened the way they had. He was just lucky that they had convinced Jack to bring Castiel back. Boy Dean missed that kid. He still dropped in from time-to-time but it wasn’t the same. And then Castiel had told Jack to remove his grace so he could grow old with Dean. Yeap, Dean definitely blamed himself for that one.
“Gumdrop hearts, actually,” she said with a smile. “They were a Valentine’s Day special that he claims he made especially for me. He called them his ‘Kali Hearts’.”
“I know about a hundred different ways to make mac and cheese,” Dean said.
“You think he has the brains,” Castiel said.
“Nerd,” Dean teased.
“He wanted to save up enough money to be independent,” Anna said. “That’s why he worked at the coffee shop. He didn’t want to rely on our father’s money.”
“Well done.” Crowley pushed himself up out of his seat, coming to stand before Dean. “So now we know you can handle a vampire nest. What challenge do you feel like next?”
Bobby gave him a smile, looking back down at the paper. “You gonna call your dad and let him know?”
“Anna’s a whore?” Gabriel pulled a face, one mixed with disgust and surprise. “I didn’t realise she’d fallen that far.”
Sam frowned. “No, I haven’t.”
At the end of shift on Wednesday Dean had been cleaning the floor when Gabriel had wandered in with a lollypop in his mouth. Gabriel had watched him work for a while, keeping out of the way so that Dean could mop the floor.
Dean looked up at him. “What do you mean?”
“I can do that,” Anna said. “I can give you my number.”
“I do,” Castiel said. He looked up toward the sky. “I know I can never return to Heaven. I am no longer welcome.”
“You’re a good kid,” Bobby said. “So how have things been with you?”
“I imagine coffee is a lot easier than candy,” Dean guessed.
“It’s open,” he called.
“Is it you or is it the Mark that’s doing that?” Sam asked.
Dean nodded. Bobby then went about the process of changing out a carburettor before having Dean have a go himself. Once Bobby was sure Dean had the hang of it he had him practice a few more times while Bobby went back to the workshop to keep working. By the end of the day Dean had gotten good at changing it out, careful not to damage it.
“The answer is still no,” Castiel said.
“I know, right?” Dean relaxed into his bed. “It was stuff Dad taught me though so it wasn’t too hard.”
On the plus side he and Sam knew how to ‘cure’ a demon. Castiel knew he would need to find some way to get Dean out of Hell and back to the bunker. He gazed around the walls looking for something that could help him and coming up with a blank. For now he was completely at the mercy of the demons but would need to keep his wits about him.
“You are forgiven,” Castiel said.
“Apparently,” Sam said. “Oh yeah, and they want to kill Dean.”
“I can’t even walk down the street without people staring at me,” Anna said. “I just want to live my life and they won’t let me.”
“He comes in from time to time,” Gabriel said. “Mostly into the coffee shop though. He’s never had much of a sweet tooth.”
Castiel stared down at him, his eyes drifting down to Dean’s abdomen. He reached out with one hand and pressed it against Dean’s stomach. After a moment his eyes widened more than Dean thought possible. “Dean…”
He watched as she left. Dean slid the First Blade back onto his belt, then looked down at the bodies of the two angels. Their wings had been burned into the walls and floor of the motel room. Dean scowled. This was going to cost him extra. Pulling out his phone he dialled Crowley’s number to organise a clean-up crew.
“Feel free to add more names,” Dean said with a smirk.
“You did while you were in your rut,” Dean said. “You couldn’t get enough of me.”
Crowley had insisted that Dean keep him updated as he went. Dean felt like a teenager who had to keep checking in with his parent. He hated it. He knew that Crowley was probably just worried about his business though. It seemed to be an operation that made the King a lot of money and earned them a lot of deals. It made Dean wonder how many other ventures that Crowley had his claws in.
“Bet he had to run everything through Michael,” Benny said. “When it comes to the family’s finances everything goes through that man.”
Dean’s eyes were pitch black. Sam could feel the rage rolling off him as he fought against Castiel’s hold. Castiel’s eyes were glowing with grace as he held Dean close, his arms pinned down to his sides. Sam swallowed, stepping back and allowing them to enter. Castiel was practically dragging Dean forward and into the bunker, hurling him down the stairs.
“Oh my god,” Sam said again. “What the fuck, man.”
He turned and walked back toward the door, Castiel watching him go. When the door swung closed and the locks slid into place Castiel slumped back on the bed. He closed his eyes and let out a long breath. It seemed that Dean was going to leave him mostly alone today. He knew that Dean would be back though. It seemed that the urge for sex was as strong at the urge to kill, and it had been some time since Dean had had sex.
Dean dragged Castiel forward, sliding his own teeth over Castiel’s mating mark and biting down. Castiel yelped, Dean feeling another burst of pleasure wash over him. Dean could taste the blood on his tongue, feel it trickling down his neck where Castiel was biting him. As he came down from his high he reluctantly released the skin between his teeth and felt Castiel do the same.
Crowley seemed surprised by that. “You have no faith in him?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, staring into the blackness of his coffee. “Dad won’t touch him though.”
“Worried about me, are you?”
“I don’t believe any alphas that approached him survived,” Castiel said.
“Yeah, I’ve never heard anyone order them,” Dean said. “Why are they still on the list?”
a demon?” Sam said, feeling himself feel sick.
“I plan on it,” Dean said. “I’m seeing her Saturday and telling her we’re through.”
“And coffee,” Castiel guessed.
Dean looked at his own watch and saw the late hour. He raised his eyebrows. Time had certainly flown. “Yeah, I need to get home too. Bobby will start having kittens if I’m home too late.”
“Miss you too, kiddo,” Dean said softly.
“Then clearly you’re not looking hard enough,” Dean said. “Because right now I’m ecstatic.”
“Shit.”
“Your brother does not want rescuing,” Hannah reminded him. “And it will only be a matter of time before Castiel’s grace burns out and he dies with it.”
“That is a positive,” Castiel said. “The robber got away last time. There wasn’t enough to identify him.”
“No,” Dean said, pushing his own love for Castiel back through the bond. “It’s requited. I just didn’t think you could so I never…”
“Sure would have,” Benny said. “And run me right out of town.”
“Dean, we’ve been over this,” Castiel said. “I made the deal with the Empty. It was only a matter of time before it did.”
He had handed the head to his female translator, telling her to take it down to Crowley while Dean himself checked into a motel to clean himself up. Afterward he headed out to a diner to get himself a double bacon cheeseburger, finally satisfying a craving he’d been building up over recent weeks. The cravings had definitely started much to his displeasure, but he was still avoiding morning sickness. He wondered if it was because he was a Knight of Hell.
“It was only a small amount,” Castiel said. “Just enough for one.”
“Miss me, do you?” Crowley said. “I’ll be back when business is done. In the meantime you should be worrying about Moose. Word is he’s on the verge of discovering you’re a demon.”
“It is a bit that way,” Benny agreed. “They’re a mighty big family.”
-----O-----
The tone of his voice was enough to tell Dean his answer. Dean’s heart skipped a beat, a thrill running up his spine as his legs felt like jelly. Dean swallowed himself, feeling heat begin to flush across his face.
Dean’s scowl deepened as he looked down at Castiel. He seemed to be inspecting him for any foul play. Seeing none he looked back up at Crowley. “I think your minions were looking for you. Something about a fire in a warehouse in Brooklyn.”
Castiel let out a shuddering breath, the memory of Dean’s scent washing over him. He could still partially smell Dean on him. Dean hadn’t bothered to clean his cum off of Castiel’s chest, instead smearing it into the skin. It had long since dried and begun to flake off, leaving him itchy but unable to scratch. It was like Dean was marking him in his own way.
“Dean doesn’t trust you,” Castiel said. “Neither do I.”
“Fair enough.”
Sam blinked and straightened. “Hannah?”
“Why are you here?” Castiel asked.
“Yes we do,” Castiel agreed. “When we get back?”
“My dad would kill me, but I’m bi,” Dean said. “Had a couple of relationships with guys over the years but had to do it without my dad knowing. I could bring the girls home but not the guys.”
“We seek the Nephilim,” Hannah said. “Surely you sensed its creation.”
“Only when I’m cutting down,” Gabriel said. “Usually it’s seven.”
Dean shrugged it off.
Deciding he needed answers Crowley headed down to the dungeon. He growled to himself as he passed more bodies, knowing that his numbers had been severely thinned during Dean’s little tantrum. It meant Crowley was going to have to find new guards that were loyal to him. Strong and loyal alphas were a rare thing in Hell. He was going to have to make do with betas for the time being. Maybe he should mix things up with a few strong omegas. They could be quite vicious.
“Hey, Deano,” Gabriel said as they reached him. “You’re here early.”
“I’m fine, Dean,” Sam said. “Besides, Dad would just take it anyway and he’d be pissed if he found out it was from you.”
“So they’re afraid of her,” Dean said.
“Because I love pie,” Dean said. “Can’t get enough of it.”
He picked up the First Blade again and turned it over in his hands, inspecting it. He smiled as he saw that he had managed to clean all the blood off it. It was definitely the ugliest blade he had ever used, and also the most crude. But it did its job effectively and that’s what mattered in the end.
“Yeah, they did,” Dean said. “He went to rob the Sugar Heaven but there were cops inside.”
“Shh,” Dean said, frowning. “Don’t say that out loud.”
“Like that time I had to drop them off to you,” Dean said.
“How thick are the walls?” Dean asked.
“You don’t want them dead?”
Castiel pursed his lips, eyes narrowing as his head tilted. “Dean, open your bond to me.”
Instead Crowley stepped through the door, his coat flowing around him as he entered. Castiel frowned as he spotted familiar clothing in his arms.
Dean watched him, admiring Castiel. Honestly he was glad that Castiel was human now too. He had to admit it was for selfish reasons, like the fact that Castel now had to rely on him more. Dean liked being able to look after Castiel. And in return Castiel looked after him. It was a two way street and Dean liked the fact the playing field was even now.
Castiel felt his blood run cold at those words. “Did you just drug me?”
“He wooed you over chocolate?’ Dean asked.
Bobby narrowed his eyes. “Something wrong with his car?”
“Crowley!”
“Heya Sammy.”
“Well for one it would actually have to be a committed relationship. Long term,” Dean said. “No loving them and leaving them.”
“I am,” Castiel said. “Are you?”
“Like you said,” Bobby said. “Hard worker who picks things up quick.”
“If you require sleep I can watch over him,” Castiel said.
Dean shook his head. He knew it would only be a matter of time before he would have to make a decision about Sam though. Once Sam found out what Dean had become he would become single minded on trying to capture and cure Dean. He would also try and rescue Castiel once he knew what had happened to him. Crowley was right in saying the longer they delayed it the better.
“Well I really like him,” Castiel answered.
“I can sense him,” Dean said. “He’s pissed. And worried.”
“Technically it’s my room,” Crowley said. “All rooms around here are. Because I’m the King.”
“He hates it,” Dean said. “He told me that if I left to never bother contacting him again.”
Dean glanced at Kali and saw that she was busy, so Dean could only assume that the man that had come through had to be Gabriel’s brother. Sure enough the man emerged back out into the serving area wearing an apron, stepping over toward Dean. Dean blinked as he got a good look at the man, instantly drawn to the blue of his eyes. He knew he was staring when he saw the man frown at him.
“I’m getting there,” Dean said. “No real big mess ups yet.”
Dean’s mind was still buzzing as they wandered back to the car. The waitress had slipped Castiel her number before they had left, Castiel trying to hide it but Dean had noticed. He was surprised by his small pang of jealousy and protectiveness. He had pretended that he hadn’t seen anything.
Dean’s eyes widened. “Really?”
“I told them it would work,” Dean said. “They just had to do it right.”
“Your turn to make dinner,” Kali told him.
“They haven’t come for him yet,” Crowley said.
“Anyway I’ll leave you too it,” Sam said, ducking back out the door. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t.”
“I’ll make dinner for the next couple of weeks,” Dean said. “You won’t have to worry about that.”
“Yeah, it is,” Gabriel agreed. “I’ve tried to talk him into going to the movies with us but he won’t.”
Dean stiffened. She had him. One thing Sam had always called him on was the way he always bottled everything up until he just burst. “Am I that easy to read?”
“What the hell are you doing?” he heard John growl. “I thought I said not to contact us.”
“I’ve been with Gabriel long enough to smell the difference between some of the sweets,” she said. “He’s always bringing home ‘samples’ and trying new recipes in our kitchen.”
“Pretty much.”
“I’m good,” Dean assured him. “He’s just strong.”
“This going to take long?” Dean asked.
“It’s not our job to question,” Benny said. “It’s just our job to make sure we don’t end up the same way.”
“Yes and no,” she said. “On specific holidays – yes. Every other day of the week? Depends. Once you even things out both shops do roughly the same.”
“We’re not done for the day,” she told him. “Now we get to clean up.”
“So I heard,” Crowley said. “You even managed to spare my demons. Good work.”
“Demons do not love,” Castiel said flatly.
“That’s not correct,” Castiel said. “I have paid for my mistakes.”
“And you said no?” Dean said. “Cas, you’re missing out.”
Dean pulled a face. “Why would anyone want to live there?”
“Well she didn’t seem to notice anything,” Dean said. “Good thing too, otherwise I would have had to kill her.”
“If we simply destroy the Nephilim the angel and host may attempt to create another,” Hannah said. “They must be dealt with.”
“Yeah, they do,” Gabriel said. He shrugged it off. “But they’re my family. I make do.”
Sam felt sick. He knew it was going to be important for him to find Dean first and he didn’t even have the slightest of leads on him. Dean had made it clear that he didn’t want Sam to track him. Sam needed to find some way of letting Dean know that the angels were coming after him. Setting his jaw he knew he was going to have some decisions to make.
“No you didn’t,” Sam said. “You got an apprenticeship. You got a job. You got a stable place to live. You’re doing great.”
“They caught the guy,” Dean said.
“Whatever you are,” Sam said. “Just let Cas go.”
“Exactomundo.” Dean grinned. “You’re not going anywhere. You haven’t got the grace to escape anyway.”
“Expedite?” Dean stared at him. “Cas, did you walk in here intending to fuck me?”
“Well I guess we can agree to disagree,” Dean said, biting into his breakfast.
“I’m surprised she did not sense it already,” Castiel said, eyes dropping down toward Dean’s abdomen. “There is a bright spark in your darkness.”
Kali frowned. “What makes you say that?”
“Hey yourself,” Sam said. He reached out, taking hold of one of Dean’s hands and giving it a squeeze. “How are you feeling?”
“I think we’re heading East. Dad was talking about Chicago and a job at a warehouse on the lake.”
“You guys are acting like he’s some sort of alien,” Dean said. “He seemed perfectly normal to me.”
“Oh yeah,” Dean said, picking at his food. “He’s a regular nerd. Bookworm through and through.”
“That’s the lot,” she said, locking the till. There was no money in it, Dean knew, but she always locked it anyway. “You’re right to go.”
“Wow,” Dean said. “That sucks.”
“Yeah, I need to get home too,” Dean said. “Be seeing you.”
“With what?” Dean asked, gazing at him. “I don’t need any help.”
“Dean,” Sam said. “You don’t have to do that. I can just take out a loan.”
Castiel probed their bond but felt nothing like what Dean was claiming. He could feel the anger simmering through it, and the deep darkness that surrounded Dean’s soul. He could also feel hints of self-doubt. He latched onto them.
“So I’ve been thinking,” Bobby said as he took a drink from his cup. “I want you to pull that entire engine out of the junker and take it apart completely.”
“So that’s what this is about,” Castiel said. “You’re punishing me for my transgressions.”
“I don’t blame him,” Kali said. “When did he find out?”
“Yeah. Thanks for that.” Dean rested his elbows on his knees. “So you heard from Sam?”
“Dean,” Castiel said, stepping closer. “There are things going on that you don’t understand.”
“Oh no, he’s not,” Kali said. “He’s manipulative, conniving, and doesn’t like being told ‘no’. He always gets what he wants. That’s why he approved of giving Gabriel money in the first place – to bring him back to the family. Gabriel doesn’t trust him as far as he can throw him.”
“Kind of get it,” Dean said. “I’d rebuild Baby’s engine if I had to. I’d rebuild the whole damned car if I had too.”
“I don’t have access to the safe,” Castiel said.
“Well it sucks,” Dean said. “No wonder Castiel and Gabriel are trying to distance themselves from the family. And Anna.”
“I thought you didn’t deal with demons,” Dean said.
“Gabriel is pretty pissed off at you,” Dean said.
They had crossed back into America by the start of week five, Dean finally cornering their prey in San Antonio, Texas. Dean was furious by this point having been lead in such a long chase. The man had begged for his life, trying in vain a couple more spells and traps that Dean had just shrugged off. Crowley had given Dean a list of questions that he wanted answered so Dean had tortured his victim until he got them. Once Crowley was satisfied Dean had taken great pleasure in slicing his victims head clean from his body. Slowly.
“Gabriel mentioned it,” Dean said. “You got busted with weed so you lost it.”
Sam led the way through the bunker to the dungeon. They moved in silence aside from the grunts and growls of Dean struggling to break free. When they reached the dungeon Crowley stopped at the doorway, Castiel hurling Dean across the space and over to the chair in the middle of the room. He forced Dean down, Sam quickly strapping him into the seat.
“You were lucky enough to have other siblings to step in I guess,” Dean said. “It was just my brother and me. Dad was hardly ever around. He was either working or at the bar.”
Sam nodded. “I’ll do the next one. He still fighting them?”
“Does working on Saturdays cut into your studies?” Dean asked as he moved to set the chairs down from the tables.
“Clearly.” Dean blinked, his eyes going black as he grinned. “And you’re an angel.”
“I still fail to see why you are so determined to restore my grace,” Castiel said.
Bobby was all over Dean when he walked in the door. He grabbed him by the shoulders, looking him over before Dean could even take off his shoes and jacket. Dean sighed, trying to ease Bobby to back off.
Dean didn’t really sleep well that night. Every time he closed his eyes he saw the muzzle of the gun pointed at him. On the rare occasion that he did sleep he’d wake up in a cold sweat, his breath coming in short pants as he panicked. He’d climb out of bed and walk a few laps of the room to calm his nerves, eventually climbing back into bed and trying to get some more sleep.
Dean frowned. “How long’s the coffee shop been open?”
By the time the shop opened and the first few customers wandered in Dean had the hang of it, although he still felt daunted by it all. He took his time to make sure there were no mistakes but the customers seemed to be understanding toward him. A few of them tried to chat with him but he was concentrating too hard on his job so Gabriel had chimed in instead.
“So she thinks she’s forgotten,” Dean said.
-----O-----
“Don’t!” Castiel said.
“Just Castiel,” Anna said. “Ishim sometimes would but he got bored easily.”
“Your childhood must have sucked,” Dean said.
Castiel stared up at him, his jaw setting. “You want to keep it.”
“Yeah, I guess.” Dean finished putting the vegetables in the pot, then started cleaning up the scraps. “Hey Bobby, exactly how messed up is the Shurley family?”
“Yeap, you’re right,” Dean said, tapping his forehead. “I’d have to bleach my brain.”
“Then I need to buy us some time,” Crowley said.
“No,” she said, shaking her head. “They seem to get along fine.”
“Is Dean a demon?” Sam asked point blank.
“It’s not a competition,” Castiel told him.
“Ah, the golden child,” Bobby snorted.
“We must move quickly,” Hannah said. “While it is not a threat now as the Nephilim grows it will gain strength. Even in the womb it will be dangerous. It is essential that we find it as soon as possible.”
“I will always protect Dean Winchester,” Castiel said. “And by extension his brother.”
“That’s because I like it,” Dean said. “Although it has got one problem.”
“Breathe it in, Cas,” Dean said, pulling Castiel’s head into his neck. “Breathe in my omega. Gets you hard, doesn’t it.”
Dean slipped the apron on, noting that it fit perfectly. It was a royal blue with the shop logo and name etched in white onto the front. Dean made his way around the counter, taking in the machinery on the other side. He felt overwhelmed by all the dials and handles.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Dean said. “This is 100% me. I’ve been wanting to do this for a while. I just kept talking myself out of it.”
“Yeah,” Sam said. “Although I think we’re leaving next week.”
“No,” Dean said with a shake of his head. He wasn’t that lucky. “We work together and want to get to know each other better, that’s all.”
“I can’t, Dean,” she said, Dean seeing the tears in her eyes. “It’s not as simple as you make it sound.”
“Have you tried asking Metatron?”
“You seem to have plenty of time on weekends,” Kali commented.
“Yeah, tell me about it,” Dean said. “You know we’re not even allowed to mention her?”
“Got a good teacher,” Dean said.
“Welcome back,” he purred. “Have an enjoyable hunt?”
“Impressive,” Crowley commented. “A wee bit dramatic for my taste though.”
“So the school still looks bad,” Dean said.
Hannah gave him a strange look.
“Calm down,” Crowley said as he walked closer, plucking the First Blade from Dean’s hands. “You’ll hurt yourself.”
Eileen smiled, leaning across to Castiel. “He must really like you.”
For something to do Dean had found his battered copy of
“And he returns,” Crowley said as Dean strolled into the throne room. He looked him over, noting that Dean looked as sour as he had been when he had left. “Didn’t kill enough?”
Dean sipped his drink. “Have you?”
“He will if you stop him.”
“We’re going again next Saturday,” Dean said.
“Small mercies,” Castiel said. “Dean would be very upset with you if that happens.”
“We’re going to be all right, aren’t we,” Dean said.
Dean looked up. “Really?”
“But you must have student loans,” Dean guessed.
“If I didn’t he’d be dead,” Dean countered.
“That won’t stop them from trying,” Dean said. “Sammy’s going to be coming after me. He’s going to want to ‘cure’ me.”
“Plebs?”
Kali shrugged. “The older four eventually put their foot down after Samandrial and told their father that enough was enough. The older siblings were basically raising the younger siblings by that point.”
“I am,” Dean said. “Why?”
“He doesn’t complain that much,” Dean said. “Not in his nature.”
Letting out a steadying breath Dean reached up and unlocked the straps binding Castiel’s wrists. Castiel pulled free and practically pounced on him, pinning Dean to the ground. Dean laughed as Castiel buried his nose into his scent gland and breathed deep. Without so much as a warning Castiel was pushing Dean’s knees apart and burying his cock inside him.
Sam frowned, trying to place the voice. “Yes. Who’s this?”
They waited until Sam had left the room and closed the door behind him. Dean averted his eyes, trying to work out what to say. Castiel inched closer to the head of the bed.
Dean turned and headed out the door and made his way to the dungeon.
“Damned straight,” Bobby agreed.
Sam and Eileen exchanged a knowing look and smile, shrugging it off.
“You mind your manners, boy,” Bobby said, a small smile on his lips. “I’ve got plenty of other things in the shop that could do with a polish.”
“Hot white chocolate,” Dean said. “I’ve never had that.”
“Wait,” Dean said, reaching for his bedside table and opening the drawer. He pulled out a bottle of lube and a condom. “No slick anymore so we’re going to need this.”
“You just do,” Gabriel said. “By the way, most days you’ll be working with my girlfriend Kali. She can be a little bit handsy, but she means nothing by it. She’s also a bit of a fire breather when she gets mad.”
“I’d hoped he’d mate by instinct,” Dean said. “Truemates and all that.”
“That’s him,” Dean said as he finished putting the last chair down.
They ate for a while, Dean complementing Bobby on his cooking and getting it waved off. Dean still felt a little guilt over having come home late, the dinner being only lukewarm. He wanted to say that Bobby could have started eating without him but knew that Bobby would disagree.
“Angel grace is powerful,” Sam said. “Crowley could just be using you so he can get his hands on it.”
“I am a warrior,” Castiel reminded him.
Arriving in the throne room he found the place a mess. He raised his brows as he saw Crowley standing over a pile of bodies, an angel blade in his hands as he stared down the remaining demons in the room.
“Stop being such a drama queen,” Dean said. “Nobody’s going to die.”
“Huh,” Gabriel cocked his head. “Just on the cheek or…?”
There was a pause. “What?”
“I see we’ve been having a tantrum,” Crowley commented as he stopped in the middle of the room. “Pray tell why.”
“Thank you,” Castiel said. He tilted his head. “It is very late. Shouldn’t you be asleep?”
Dean nodded, frowning. “I don’t really talk about it much.”
“And how would they find out?” Dean asked. “You going to tell them?”
“And you can’t redirect the anger onto you,” Bobby guessed.
“Right.” Crowley studied him as he poured himself a drink. “Is the bond working?”
Dean snapped his mouth closed, walking over to a nearby chair and dropping into it. He pulled out his phone and began scanning through the headlines as he waited. Surprisingly there was reception in Hell. He’d asked Crowley to explain how that worked but the King had simply told him to not ask stupid questions so Dean had left it alone.
“You want him to torture him,” Castiel said. “The angels won’t allow Metatron out of Heaven.”
“What was it about?” Sam asked.
“Not happening,” Dean said. “Anyway, if he does escape now I can track him.”
“Dean,” she said, standing.
“Sam will not kill him,” Hannah said.
Gabriel pointed to the machine. “Named her after an ex. Hot, but very temperamental.”
“I promise,” Dean repeated, heading for the door.
“Was that his name?” Crowley shrugged. “Dean used him to keep Feathers alive, so I guess you should be thanking him for that as well.” He paused. “Mind you if we had Castiel’s actual grace then angels wouldn’t have to die.”
“Yeah, you said,” Dean said. “You can’t get a job.”
“So you’d go without gas before you’d go without food?” Dean asked.
“So we should expect to smell that today,” Kali guessed.
“So all different religions,” Dean guessed.
Sam felt his blood run cold at the sound of the voice. “Dean?”
“How do you know?” Dean said with a smile. “Would I lie to you?”
Dean felt a flash of guilt wash over him as he realised Gabriel meant Anna. He headed for his car, putting the bag in the passenger seat. Dean drove across town in the direction of home, pulling off as he came to the ugly apartment building. It was a hideous concrete slab building painted the colour of mud. Dean had often wondered what sort of person lived there and had always figured it was probably college students.
“Yeah,” Dean admitted. “Been a long day.”
“Tell me Dean,” Castiel said. “What type of father do you think Crowley’s going to be for our child?”
“He was working as a security guard at the museum,” Bobby said. “Let some guys in who stole some pricey pieces.”
“Have a good night,” she told him.
“I didn’t wish to mate with a demon,” Castiel clarified.
Castiel finished dressing, pulling his familiar trench coat onto his shoulders. It was a comforting weight, although wearing any clothing at all felt strange after he had been naked for so long. He smoothed his shirt down, absently missing his tie. He stepped forward and around Crowley, who looked over him with an appreciative glance.
“A lawyer.” Kali looked impressed. “And he’s thinking about this at 14?”
“Huh.” Dean frowned. “So he’s rich.”
Castiel,” Anna said, meeting his stare. “Did you know he’s a virgin? I offered to help him with that.”
“This is a bad idea,” Crowley said as soon as Dean answered.
“A Nephilim?” Sam ran through his mind what he knew of them. “They’re the offspring of humans and angels, right?”
“A note?”
“You okay?”
“You left the family, Anna
“Definitely full alpha,” Dean said. “Nice.”
Castiel frowned. “What do you mean?”
“I know, right?” Gabriel said. “School was enough for me. I travelled to learn the rest of it.”
“You’ll be making them today,” Kali told him. “You’ll find it’s mostly the school traffic that orders them. They’re two of our most popular drinks so you’ll be getting plenty of practice.”
“So Castiel does have some form of control over you,” she said, trying to look through him.
“You were strong enough to take me down,” Dean commented. “Good thing.”
“You’re already dead,” Crowley reminded him.
“Maybe,” she said as they began to walk toward the warehouse. “Earlier we were struck by a powerful force.”
“I don’t need to be ‘cured’,” Dean said. “I like this, this power. Gives me an edge. I can take out entire vampire nests without breaking a sweat.”
Anna nodded. “It’s been so much better since I left, although they still try to make things hard for me.”
Castiel pulled the car into the carpark, turning off the engine and gazing around. There was no one in sight much to his relief. He climbed out of the car and walked across the empty playground toward the sandpit. He stopped beside it, gazing down at the runes and clearing his throat. He closed his eyes and began to pray.
“Yeah. Chicago,” Dean said. He remembered the last time he’d been in the city. The hotel they’d stayed at hadn’t been great. “Provided Dad got the job he was going for.”
“Are you fucking insane!?” He said.
“I trust you, Castiel,” she said. “If you say it’s taken care of then I believe you.”
“Does your dad even know what you do?” Dean asked.
“Your ‘bad boy’ image sucked,” Sam said.
“No one dares to rob Kali,” Castiel agreed.
“Do they didn’t abuse her?”
“I’m bad luck,” she said. She looked down at the table. “You probably shouldn’t be talking to me.”
“Did you get the pie?”
Dean blinked. “You read the dictionary?”
“Good. This is good,” Sam said. “We can work with this.”
“Yeah, I saw what the weather did on Monday,” Dean said. “A little rain keeps a lot of people away.”
“You’re a bigger man than I am,” Dean said. “I’d hold a grudge.”
There was still hesitancy in Castiel’s kisses, Dean pushing back hard against him in an attempt to assure him that yes, this was indeed happening. Slowly Castiel became more sure with himself, kissing Dean back with equal fervour. Dean slid his hand behind Castiel’s neck as Castiel gripped his other hand tightly as if he were scared Dean would let go.
“I have most of the ingredients here,” Crowley said as he gestured to the room around them. “You’ll need to fetch me a few things though.”
“I was kind of hoping,” Sam said. “Although I’m not sure how given we’re so far apart.”
“As a matter of fact yes I can,” Dean said. “Because we’re both eternal beings now. We don’t die. So our mating really
Castiel frowned and did as he was told. Dean bit his lip as Castiel got closer to the spot but was still just missing it.
“It wasn’t you,” Sam repeated.
“Hey, I am capable to taking things slow,” Dean objected.
“He’s an omega,” the alpha said. “And he’s going into heat. We’re wondering what you’re going to do about that.”
“Being a god is not what it’s cut out to be,” Castiel commented.
“Wait, what do you mean ‘read about it,” Dean said, staring up at him. “Cas, have you been researching about having sex?”
“Cas. Cas!”
Dean blanched. “Six?”
“Yeah. It was a rough one,” Dean said as Castiel came to sit on the edge of the bed. “Nothing we couldn’t handle.”
Dean grabbed Castiel by the arms and pulled, dragging him down onto the bed on top of him. They wiggled up the bed until Dean’s head was on the pillows, stealing kisses as they went. Castiel slid between the space Dean made for him with his legs, holding himself up off Dean. Dean desperately needed body contact though and wrapped his arms around Castiel, dragging him down.
“I keep forgetting,” Castiel said. He pulled out his wallet and slid his portion of the meal onto the table with a tip. “I’ll see you on Wednesday.”
“Nope,” Dean said. “Sweet, savoury – I’ll take whatever pie I can get.”
“Like she turned on your family,” Dean said.
“Just remember this whole thing has conditions,” Bobby reminded him. “You’ve got to work hard and not slack off.”
Dean’s expression darkened. “What happened to it being a big secret?”
With a sigh Dean headed home, thoroughly exhausted.
“I’m just doing what I have to do,” Dean said. “Besides, it’s not that quick.”
He wasn’t quite as tired come Saturday, Dean deciding it was time for him to actually go get some proper clothing and shoes for the coffee shop. He had admired Castiel’s choice of clothing and noted that Kali herself wore neat casual, and Dean felt underdressed right now. Not to mention his shoes weren’t exactly the best for being on your feet all day.
“My apologies for not airing it out,” Castiel quipped. “Unfortunately there are no windows.”
To say he felt sick was an understatement. It was bad enough that Dean’s body had disappeared, but now Castiel too? They had been getting reported sightings from hunters and chasing them up, but every time they arrived Dean had been nowhere to be seen. It was like they were chasing a ghost.
“Sunday’s off,” Dean said. “Although I’ll probably spend it tinkering in the shop.”
He slid off Castiel’s lap and toed off his shoes, reaching for his belt. Castiel’s eyes flicked to him and watched what he was doing, widening in alarm. Dean flashed him a grin as he dropped his pants and removed his underwear, stepping out of them.
“Car this old still has a carburettor,” Bobby explained. “And a lot of the older models we work on here do, so you’re going to need to know how to replace one. First thing you should know is they’re hard to come by these days so you’ve either gotta find one in a wreck or order one custom. They’re not cheap so you’ve got to be careful with them. Understand?”
“That’s kind of messed up,” Dean said. He absolutely hated it in fact. It should matter who was in the right, not just who had the money and control. It was causing conflict in him and he didn’t like it.
“Anything,” Castiel said.
“Is that what they teach you in Bible school,” Crowley said. “You realise Dean might make a wonderful parent.”
“Why the hell did you let her do it?” Dean asked.
“Not his affection?”
“It sure is,” Benny agreed. “Some people complain about it, but I like waking up in the morning and knowing what the day is going to bring.”
He stopped by the counter and ordered some food for Bobby as well as some take out dessert for himself. Benny made him the meal and handed it to him in a takeout bag. Dean thanked him again, then headed back to the car. All the way he felt like he was being watched. He scanned the area and didn’t see anyone so he put it down to his paranoia.
“How so?” Dean asked.
“Maybe I should do it again,” Dean threatened. “That was some of the best sex I’ve ever had.”
“That coffee shop off Main Street?” Bobby asked. “Do you even know
“Just that she’s worried,” Dean said, deciding not to tell Gabriel that Anna had been watching them. He didn’t want her to get into any more trouble than she was already in. “About them still being at home with your dad.”
-----O-----
“One big happy family,” Dean said.
“Correct,” Castiel said. “It has quite a large yard so we had plenty of space. There were still issues, however. For example Lucifer was rather fond of playing loud music at all hours of the day and night.”
“Or better yet simply inject it straight into him,” Crowley said. “I take it you want me to make this potion.”
“No,” Sam said. “I miss you.”
“Which I will complete,” Castiel said.
“The birth of the Nephilim kills the host,” Crowley said. “You do know that.”
“We will not allow him to die in order for that to happen,” Castiel said. “Metatron was to blame for killing him.”
“I’m still useless without my grace,” Castiel said.
Isiah nodded. “He’s been interrogated but he hasn’t broken.”
“I think you’re right,” Dean agreed. “But we still need to say it.”
Dean could see a sad look wash over Bobby’s face that he had come to associate with talking about John. He knew that Bobby had never approved of the way that John had raised him and Sam, which was why Bobby had volunteered to watch them so often. He remembered when he was little overhearing a fight between his father and Bobby about him and Sam. He hadn’t really understood it back then but now he knew that Bobby had been looking out for the pair of them.
Gabriel kissed Kali gently on the cheek before stepping away from her, walking around Dean and heading to the Sugar Heaven. Kali watched him go with amusement before unlocking the door to the coffee shop and letting herself and Dean inside. Dean instantly went to start setting up the tables and chairs as Kali made her way behind the counter to start warming the machines.
Crowley huffed. “You know as well as I do that you’re not leaving this cell.”
“Changed my mind,” Bobby said. “Getting hands on is the only way you’re going to learn.”
“Never said there was,” Dean said. “Bookworms tend to graduate top of the class.”
“Could he be in Hell?”
Dean gestured back at himself. “About what?”
The afternoon rush kicked in and Dean once again found himself swamped. He remembered not to rush things, frowning when he heard a customer complaining about how slow he was. Kali shut them down quick smart, reminding them it was only Dean’s second day and threatening to kick them out of the store for their attitude. They quietened down after that.
Dean looked at her expectantly.
When Dean got home he found that Bobby already had dinner started. Dean took over the cooking, not commenting about his aching feet. He didn’t know why they were so sore today. There was really no reason for it. It did feel good to take his shoes off though, Dean padding around the flat in socked feet as he finished making dinner.
“Yes sir,” the demon said.
“I have no interest in becoming a god,” Castiel said.
He glanced up at the sound of distant footsteps, hearing them pass by his cell. No doubt some sort of guard. He swallowed, wondering how long Dean intended to leave him where he was. The room was almost silent and Castiel knew if left to his own thoughts he might go insane. He gazed around the room again, seeing no means of escape.
(See the end of the chapter for
When the last of the school rush headed out the door he noted that his feet were actually hurting. He frowned, rotating his ankles to relieve some of the pressure on them. He had thought he was getting used to being on his feet all day but it seemed that he wasn’t. He saw Kali watching him and gave her a reassuring smile.
“Yes,” Castiel said. “He was hesitant at first but did allow me.”
“And you’re not putting that earring back in,” Dean said.
“I ‘spose that car of yours does need a bit of work,” Bobby said. “Still can’t believe your dad gave it to you.”
He headed back out to the living room and the body, searching it for more clues. He could tell from the wound that the demon had been killed by an angel blade. Clearly Castiel had put up a fight. After one last look around Sam left the house and headed back outside to the Impala. He sat in it for a moment, fingers resting on the steering wheel and closing his eyes.
“Did you get what you want?”
“Dean…” Castiel growled.
“Are you intending on raping me again?” Castiel asked.
“No.” Dean pressed a hand against his abdomen protectively. He could almost see the light that Castiel had commented on now. It was cloaked in Dean’s murky darkness but Dean was starting to get worried that it might be visible to anyone who looked hard enough. “Any news from Sam?”
“Yes it is,” Castiel said.
“Well I’m not you,” Dean said.
“Good,” Crowley said. “I’ll get back to you when I have more information cause I’m guessing right now we’re all on the same page. Bupkiss.”
Dean shrugged. “Haven’t for a couple of years now, but when I was younger Valentine’s Day was my favourite holiday.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “It was awesome.”
“Bullocks.” Crowley ran a hand over his jaw, staring at a spot over Castiel’s shoulder as the wheels turned in his head. “So Dean is carrying a time bomb.”
They ripped the bag off of the other’s head, Castiel raising his eyes to look up. His blue eyes widened as he spotted Dean. He tried to say something but was muffled by the tape over his lips, and he tugged at the chains that bound him but to no avail. Dean grinned, leaning forward and gazing down at him.
Dean frowned. “You can’t do that.”
Dean shook the idea from his mind and pulled his shirt back up to hide the mark. He straightened his clothing and headed out the door of his room. He narrowed his eyes as he spotted the two guards that were out there. Crowley had been putting a guard on him these last couple of weeks. He had a feeling that Crowley didn’t trust him to stay put. Not that a guard would do much if Dean truly decided to leave Hell. Dean would just kill them and go.
“Oh shit!”
“Is it a trust thing or…”
“Not happening,” Dean said. “You’ve got to suffer like the rest of us.”
“Because they are her domain,” Castiel said. “She believes that having less people work them will reduce the likelihood of there being mistakes and oversights.”
“It’s little wonder he can’t hold down a job,” Dean said. That had always amazed him about his father. The fact that he was always drunk but never seemed to lose a job because of it. “You got enough to eat?”
“I’d be pissed,” Dean said. “They cheated you, man.”
“No,” Castiel said. “Our home was quite large. We each had our own room.”
“Gadreel,” Benny said. “Case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Castiel pushed himself up, standing and walking toward the door as far as his chains would allow. He tried to see what Dean was seeing but Dean had closed off his side of the bond. Whatever it was he didn’t want Castiel to know what he was up to. Castiel absently rubbed his neck where his mating mark was, the mark itching for a moment.
They made it through the rest of the day without incident, the rain having completely gone by the last rush of the day. Dean was glad when the last customer wandered out and he was able to close and lock the door. He glanced at where Kali had already started cleaning the machines, Dean grabbing the mop to give the floors one last wash.
“You’ve got him chained up,” Sam guessed. “He’s your prisoner.”
“Yeah, so?” Sam said. “You always find someone within the first week of being anywhere.”
“Sounds like Kali,” Dean said. “She runs things tight.”
There was a long pause as Castiel considered how to answer. “Enough.”
“Special menu tonight, gentlemen,” she said with a smile. “Two meals for the price of one.”
“This Saturday?” Dean said. “I can do the belt and see what else needs to be done.”
“I do intend to study,” Castiel said.
“We got robbed,” Dean said.
ass.”
“Place is practically dead now til closing time,” Gabriel said, pulling up a chair. “My assistant can handle things in the meantime.”
“And hot chocolate,” Gabriel said. “We’ll be adding that to the menu next week.”
“So they were no issue for you,” Castiel said.
“You think Kali said no?” Dean asked.
Castiel blinked for a moment before opening the door open wider. “Thank you, Dean.”
“I’m not,” Dean said quickly. He wasn’t, was he? “I’m just going with what I know.”
“It sounds like he is a good kid,” Castiel said.
Sensing movement Dean looked up as another customer entered. He frowned as he noted something was off about her, the way she walked full of hesitation. Her head was down and her red hair was wet around her face, Dean noting the wear on her clothing. He glanced at Kali and saw her expression darken as she saw her, Dean wondering if perhaps this was a homeless person.
Dean nursed his beer, opening his eyes and looking around the familiar interior of the bunker. It really was good to be home. He had never felt like he fit in in Hell. He had always been butting heads with Crowley, and there were always eyes on his back at all times. He actually felt peaceful here, able to relax for the first time in months.
“Nephilim births destroy angels,” Castiel said. “It will surely destroy you.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “And you’re Anna.”
“Yeah, he mentioned,” Dean said. “Thank you for that.”
they have to come from the lot. No brand new pieces. You get to decide if you charge for the man hours.”
“Sam isn’t a problem and I can take care of Cas,” Dean said.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel said. “Sam was telling me about your hunt.”
“Pleased to meet you,” Dean said, glancing quickly at the line of customers.
“Give me an hour,” Crowley said. “I’ll get you your list. Although I still fail to see why you’re wasting your time with him. He’s a liability and will be even more so when you’re mated to him.”
“I know a few of the kids ran away over the years,” Bobby said. “Their old man didn’t really give much of a shit. Said they were free to do what they want.”
“Alright, I’ll respect Castiel for that,” Bobby said. “He’s taking the hard path.”
“Be nice to have money to start a business,” Sam said. “Would you start your own mechanic shop if you did?”
Sam walked into the house with his gun drawn, fully alert as he moved his way from room to room. He set his jaw as he walked, checking every inch of the building. He frowned as he spotted a body slumped on the floor and moved over to it. He rolled it over and was relieved to find that it wasn’t Castiel.
“That sounds good,” Castiel said. “Are you sure it’s okay for you to drive me?”
“Good.” Dean pushed himself up so that he was leaning back against the headboard, running his gaze over Castiel. “So when did you get back?”
“Sounds like,” Sam said.
Dean finished his drink, glancing at the clock and noting how late it was getting. “Anyway I should probably shower and hit the hay. Early start tomorrow.”
“He just doesn’t think that sort of thing is necessary,” Kali said, leaning on the counter. “He’s not much of a conversationalist either.”
“I told you the angel was going to be a liability,” Crowley had said as Dean joined him in the throne room. “Loose ends always end up being used against you.”
“I said get out,” Gabriel repeated.
“That’s not quiet how mating works,” Crowley said.
“He just told us to sort it out,” Anna said. “He was always busy writing.”
“Why?”
“Shouldn’t that be my decision?” Dean said.
Castiel held his eye as Dean kept stroking him. Castiel forced himself to keep his breathing even despite the fact he once again felt his body betraying him. Dean gave him a sweet look as he continued to stroke him to full hardness, and then with a wink Dean lowered himself down and took Castiel’s cock into his mouth.
“That’s a pretty boring life,” Dean said.
“I could have taught you that,” John said.
“A bit deeper,” Dean said.
“None,” Crowley said. “We’ve narrowed it down to possibly being in a library, but there are hundreds of thousands of those around the world. We’re looking into whether Gadreel or Metatron visited any of them.”
“No sir,” the demon said. “A couple of people wanting to be famous, your usual trying to save their families, and one that made a similar deal to yours. No one that really stands out, at least not yet.”
“Just the basic ones to begin with,” Gabriel said. “Once you get the hang of them we’ll include a few more.”
“Yes.”
“Cool,” Dean said. “I’ll have to check the place out.”
“Um...” he heard the guilt.
Kali gave him a pointed look.
“Have you tried contacting the King of Hell?”
She narrowed her eyes. “So Dean Winchester was responsible for the death of Isiah.”
Dean hasn’t expected that. He wondered why. “So who used to work with you when Kali couldn’t?” Dean asked.
“Nothing to ‘cure’,” Dean said. “Get it Cas. I like this new me.”
“Still mad, huh?”
“You can’t just force friendships,” Dean reminded him.
“At least this one is respected,” Dean said.
Dean nodded. He was worried about Sam now. John was going to chew him out or worse, and Dean wasn’t going to be there to protect him. He felt a wave of guilt wash over him knowing that he was responsible for what happened. Bobby saw his look and pulled him into a hug.
“I’m guessing that Anna isn’t invited,” Dean said as he checked the stock.
“He’s still thinking pre-law,” Dean said. “He’d make an awesome lawyer. He can talk his way out of anything.”
“But that means there’s a kernel of truth,” Dean said.
Crowley had assured Dean that his scent hadn’t really changed to give away the fact he was expecting. The only real change was that Dean’s omega scent was apparently a lot less potent these days, but Crowley put that down more to the fact he was mated more than anything. Dean didn’t know if his scent would change the further he got along. He hoped not. The last thing he needed was anyone outside of Castiel and Crowley knowing.
Castiel didn’t answer, simply content with glaring at him.
“I guess I could,” Dean said. “Where does he live?”
“Right.” Dean worried his lower lip. “Kali’s already not talking to me you know.”
Dean nodded, rejoining her behind the counter. He hadn’t been there long when the first few customers wandered in, kick starting the lunch time rush. Dean settled in and began serving drinks, not really paying much attention to anything other than doing his job. He was definitely starting to fumble less and make fewer mistakes, Dean reminding himself not to get too overconfident lest he start making errors.
He lingered around outside people watching. There weren’t that many people up and around this early in the morning, Dean taking in the few that were. Most of them seemed to be workers for the neighbouring stores, including a couple that worked in the bakery a few doors down. Dean could already smell the bread so knew that had been up really early to start baking the day’s stock.
“It would be better for everyone involved if you did,” Castiel said.
“For your sake I hope so,” Crowley said as he left, Dean glaring after him.
Castiel slicked up his fingers, reaching down between Dean’s legs to his hole. He gently pushed a finger against it before breaching him. Dean relaxed, breathing deeply as Castiel began to slowly slide the finger in and out of him.
“No,” Castiel shook his head. “I learnt my lesson.”
“I’ll double check any work you do,” Bobby said. “But you’re the one who’s signing off on it. It won’t officially be a workshop job.”
“I’m perfectly adorable when I’m sick,” Gabriel said. “And the peak of masculinity.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. He still wasn’t sure about everything. He really needed to talk to Bobby about everything. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Do you look after them?” Dean asked.
“Okay. I get it,” Sam said coldly. “You don’t care about your brother. You’re just going to leave him to die. Well I can’t do that. I’m going to save them. I’m going to save them both.”
“Hey Dean-o,” Gabriel said. “Glad to see you.”
“We can make an exception,” she said. “If you help us find the Nephilim we will help you find Castiel’s grace.”
“We were unsure of his intentions,” Hannah admitted. “We were reluctant to allow him to have it.”
Dean could feel Castiel’s panic through their connection, Dean himself feeling a wave of protectiveness over the thing that had just sparked to life inside of him. He set his jaw. “Has there ever been a Nephilim born from a demon?”
“He was,” Dean confirmed.
“Goodbye Dean.”
“I would still be at college,” Castiel said. “But yes, it did set me back several years.”
“So more a hobby project,” Dean said. “Like the Impala.”
“Always happens,” Kali said. “Sugar Heaven will take a bigger hit than us.”
“Yeah, sure thing Notorious B.I.G,” Dean said.
Dean nodded, forcing himself to slow down. He managed to get through his unwritten list before the first of the school traffic began to come in. He headed back behind the counter and started serving, finding that it was getting easier to make the speciality drinks now. He still hadn’t learnt the whole menu yet and wondered when Kali would teach him the next drink.
“Yeah, he is a bit,” Dean said. “He raised us as soldiers. Even had us call him ‘sir’ rather than ‘dad’.”
“Okay, my ears are burning. What are you saying?” Dean asked.
Standing up Dean picked up the pregnancy test and threw it in the bin. After a moment he frowned, pulling it out again. He crushed it in his hands, effectively destroying it before throwing the pieces back into the bin. That way no one would find it and see what the results were. He needed to be careful after all.
“What happened to them?”
“I don’t understand that reference,” Castiel said.
By the time morning rolled around he was actually thankful for it. It meant he would be able to get up and do something rather than be left alone to his thoughts. He looked forward to his phone call with Sam, Dean climbing out of bed and having an early breakfast. It was still too early to call his brother so he hovered around, reading the newspaper that Bobby had left on the table the day before.
“What I figure,” Dean said.
“Sell your parent’s house and move out,” Dean said. “Go somewhere quiet.”
“You know the angels are going to kill the host, right?” Sam said. “And the angel.”
“That can be arranged,” Castiel said, his hand slowly tracing circles around the small of Dean’s back.
“You’ll see him this afternoon,” Kali said. “He’s the one you’re replacing.”
“Sounds like you had a rough time,” Dean said.
“No,” Gabriel said. “It cost Castiel a scholarship. That’s why he had to put off going to college for so long. Why he had to get a job.”
“Cas’ friend,” Dean said. “They were looking for Cas.”
“Thanks.”
“I’m afraid my car hasn’t been serviced in a while,” Castiel said. “I bought it three years ago.”
“You even got him to talk,” Kali said with amazement.
“With our education?” Sam said. “It’s not exactly been consistent Dean.”
“You are relatively easy to get along with,” Castiel said.
Castiel frowned. “Should I be worried?”
“It is long overdue for a service,” Kali said. She pulled out her phone. “Let me just check with him that it’s okay that I give it to you.”
“You get on the wrong side of the Shurley’s and you’ll have no future here,” Benny said. “And you know who else will pay for it? Bobby. They’ll run him out of town too.”
His new shoes were definitely a help so he was glad for the recommendation for them, although he was already starting to worry if they were going to last long. He spent his entire day on his feet and they were already starting to show some wear. He asked Kali about it and she had commented that it wasn’t unusual to go through a lot of shoes. It was simply a matter of finding what was comfortable for you to spend all day on your feet in.
“I heard about the excitement this afternoon,” Benny said. “You boys okay?”
So Dean had sensed that. Castiel averted his gaze. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Then what is it like?’ Dean asked. “Why did you pick me?”
Castiel remained silent.
“Which explains why he’s so pissed off at you,” Crowley said. “Did I or did I not tell you to use protection.”
They ordered their coffee, Dean skipping the cake this time and making sure his coffee was a takeaway. Anna didn’t seem to notice though, ordering the same as she had last week. Dean dropped heavily into his seat and watched her as she settled in. She looked relaxed and comfortable around him.
“That’s honourable of him,” Kali said.
The rest of the week passed by without incident, Dean soon finding that Saturday had rolled around quicker than he had expected. He was up early and out the door before Bobby was out of bed, Dean making sure to be quiet so not to wake him. He drove over to his usual parking spot and saw Castiel’s car not far away. He climbed out of his car and wandered down the street to the store, finding that Castiel had already unlocked the door and gone inside.
“Yeah, so Benny was saying,” Dean said. “I guess not much happens around here so everyone would be talking about it.”
“You forget my mother is sick,” Anna said. “She needs to be close to the city for treatment.”
“And for that I am sorry,” he said. “Another reason why I can never return.”
He could still sense Dean’s anger at him. He had also felt the flare of protectiveness as Dean had come to terms with the fact he had conceived. Castiel knew that Dean was intent on keeping it no matter what Castiel said to him. He wondered if Dean could sense his own worry through their bond. He had tried to send thoughts of his wish for Dean to terminate the pregnancy but he didn’t know how successful he had been.
“Yes, but it will incentivise the other angels to try and rescue him,” Crowley said. “You haven’t thought this through.”
“Yeap,” Dean said. “And that’s where you’re staying.”
“Something wrong?” Castiel asked.
Crowley looked down at him. “And if the angels find out?”
Castiel looked at him in confusion.
“Oh I see,” Crowley said as he returned to his own search. “You still don’t trust me.”
Castiel frowned for a moment, a thoughtful look on his face as he looked at Dean. “That would be nice.”
“Any reason?”
He could feel Castiel’s orgasm approaching and knew his own wasn’t far off. He wrapped his legs around Castiel’s waist which allowed the angel to thrust just a little bit deeper, his knot beginning to catch on Dean’s rim. Dean squeezed his eyes closed and titled his head back and to the side, Castiel’s teeth scraping over the mating mark near where the shoulder met the neck.
“Huh. How long has he been working here?”
Dean nodded again. “I’ve cut her off completely.”
“You don’t want to move away from your real family,” Dean realised. “Even after everything.”
“Zero,” Bobby said. “You know my stance on underage drinking.”
Dean shook his head, smiling tightly. “This is exactly how he said it would go.”
Either way Dean was now mated. He absently rubbed the mating bite on his neck that was right on his scent gland. You couldn’t see it unless Dean pulled his shirt collar down so the majority of demons didn’t know he even had it. Dean was still a little disappointed about the whole thing. He had expected the bond to be stronger than it was given they were truemates. He wondered if maybe Castiel was somehow repressing their bond from his end. He wouldn’t put it past the angel.
“I’m not in the best of moods today so don’t try my patience,” Crowley growled.
Stepping forward Dean reached out, touching his fingertips to the flesh. He traced the lines of the wings and had to admit that the artwork was impressive. Whoever had done it was definitely not a novice. It had to have taken hours to do the whole tattoo. Dean could just picture it – a shirtless Castiel face down on a tattoo table while the artists did his or her work.
“He’s lying,” Hannah said.
When Monday rolled around Dean had made sure that he was on time, rocking up to the shop a good five minutes before he was supposed to. Kali and Gabriel were nowhere in sight, the morning a little chilly. The street lights were still on and there was only the occasional car on the street, Dean leaning against the door and looking down the road to the bakery. He could already smell the bread.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Bobby’s going to show me how to change a carburettor.”
“Yes,” Castiel said simply.
Dean watched him. “Were any of them your truemate?”
“Why you so keen on defending him?” Bobby asked.
“Depends what it is,” Dean said as he leaned back against the counter, his coffee in his hand as his robe moved with him. “Need me to stash a body?”
“I doubt you’re just letting him just walk Hell freely,” Sam said. “Where is he?”
“The Windy City, eh?” Dean said. “Been a while since we were there.”
Sam nodded. “No deals.”
“Me too,” Bobby said. “Problem is Sam’s still a minor and your dad still has custody. Nothing we can do until he’s 18.”
“No it won’t, Dean,” Castiel said. “It will-“
“Okay, sorry,” Dean said. He paused. “Did you eat?”
Dean shifted from foot to foot as he waited, watching as the cars drove slowly along Main Street with their wipers going on full. He thought that at least his car was getting a decent wash in all this rain, and hoped that it didn’t start hailing. It was certainly cold enough for it. He wondered if maybe he should have found a tree to park under just to be on the safe side.
“I am aware of it, yes,” Castiel said. “What they fail to realise is that our father held me up to a higher standard meaning I had to work harder for his attention.”
“She gave me more information on the town than anyone,” Dean said. “And she’s the only person who’s ever taken the time out to talk to me.”
Castiel raised his eyes toward the roof and felt warmth spread through him. Sam knew he must be alive and still had enough faith in him to pray. Castiel smiled for the first time in a long time, silently thanking Sam. Even though he couldn’t hear the words that were being said just knowing that Sam was there was enough for Castiel. When he eventually escaped he would personally thank the younger Winchester. Knowing Sam was praying to him gave Castiel hope.
“It’s a Nephilim,” Castiel said. “They cannot exist.”
“Kind of all I’ve been thinking about,” Dean said.
“Did you ever have a mother?” Dean asked. “I mean, aside from your birth mom.”
“I’m guessing Gabriel rebelled,” Dean said.
“Mm-mm,” Dean said. He leaned forward and buried his face into Castiel’s neck, breathing in his scent and feeling his body scream ‘mate’.
“Perhaps you should try,” she said.
“You could say it is of mutual interest.”
Dean didn’t answer and simply kissed him again.
“Yeah,” Sam said. “They said there are classes you can take online so no matter where we go I can stay enrolled and get the credit.”
“We’ll find some way of getting rid of it,” Sam said. “I promise.”
“Tired, are you?” Bobby said.
The last rush started around work knock-off time, Dean settling in behind the counter and serving up drinks. He noticed that people during this time seemed to be more interested in basic drinks, while the school rush seemed to favour the speciality menu. There were a few odd little requests from people wanting their coffee darker or with extra cream but he could handle that.
“Yeap.” Bobby shrugged. “He used to do odd jobs around town until he saved up enough money to put a deposit down on this place. Was a mess back then. He restored it all himself.”
“So he really is a hermit,” Dean said.
Dean knew he wasn’t going to get anything else out of him. He glanced at his watch and saw how much time had passed. If he was too late home he knew that Bobby would start worrying about him. That is, of course, if Bobby had made his way out of the workshop yet. “I’ve got to go,” Dean said. “It’s been nice actually talking to you.”
“When you’re hungry you’re hungry,” Dean said. “Sometimes it was the only way to eat.”
“A couple of times,” Dean said. “Slap on the wrist and a couple of months in a boys home.”
Dean shrugged it off, checking the stock levels of the supplies out front and heading into the back to grab some more. He brought them back to the front and restocked the shelves, Kali putting new food out in the display case. Dean prepared himself for the lunchtime rush, going out and wiping down the tables and getting everything ready.
He let out a long breath and gazed at his reflection in the mirror. He blinked, his eyes flashing to black. He gave himself a wink and a grin. He couldn’t get over how much he was enjoying being a Knight of Hell. The sheer power that coursed through him was amazing. He could do all the things he had seen other demons do in the past. He could throw people back against walls with the flick of a wrist. He could force other demons out of their host’s bodies. All the things Sam had been able to do when juiced up on demon blood Dean could now do. He was beginning to understand why Sam had done it.
“It was for the best, Dean,” Castiel said. “Having the child would have killed you.”
“What were you talking about?” Dean asked. “And don’t lie to me.”
“I don’t think he does,” Dean said, sliding into his seat at the table and watching as Bobby sat across from him. “I get the impression there’s a bit of tension between him and his dad.”
Pushing himself up off the bed Sam headed deeper into the bunker to begin preparing the dungeon to house a demon.
“Right.” Crowley said. “And that’s more important than Castiel’s grace.”
“I wouldn’t know,” Bobby said. “But that doesn’t surprise me.”
“Does it get busy on Saturdays?” Dean asked as he leaned against the counter and watched the clock as it ticked down to opening time.
“He is very experienced,” Kali reminded him. “If he doesn’t talk to you don’t worry – that’s just how he is. Straight to business.”
“I just wanted to see Castiel,” she said.
“No,” Dean said, shaking his head. He looked over at Castiel. “That shouldn’t stop you if you want too.”
“Depends if you consider ramen ‘food’,” Castiel said, taking the bag and moving to the kitchen.
“Noted.” Dean headed for the door, pausing as Kali switched off the lights and joined him. Dean led the way outside and paused on the sidewalk. “See you tomorrow.”
“Then I would still be chained up in Hell,” Castiel said. “And Dean would still be trying to escape his room.”
“Because you don’t want this,” Dean said.
“It’s 100% me,” Dean said. “I’ve never felt better.”
“What do they do, anyway?” Dean asked.
“Would make life easier though,” Dean said.
The door to the cell opened, Castiel glancing up and seeing Sam stepping into the room. Castiel noticed that Sam had shaved and looked a lot more alert than he had before. Clearly he had managed to get some sleep while he was away. He was also wearing a fresh outfit, and his hair was still slightly damp from a shower.
“Had to buy up a heap of clothes for work,” Dean said. “Also been buying a few tools for the workshop. Bobby says I can use his but I kind of want my own stuff, you know?”
“You would never allow yourself to become a demon,” Castiel said. “You’d destroy yourself first.”
“It’s possible.”
“$20 and dinner at the Lakeside,” Kali said.
Castiel nodded again.
“You won’t,” Crowley said. “You need me.”
Lunch time turned out to be busy for the shop, Dean was run off his feet trying to keep up with the orders. Kali stayed focussed on making the speciality drinks as well as the food and money, Dean sticking with the easy beverages. By the end of the rush Dean was already starting to feel exhausted, his legs and feet hurting. He decided he needed to buy better shoes if he was going to keep it up.
“Sir,” the demon said. “He has already killed two alphas who approached him.”
“Money on the fact he wears it to college,” Gabriel said.
“Way bigger,” Bobby said.
“To make it scarce,” Dean guessed. “Only place you can get it is here.”
“Not if you don’t try to,” she countered. “Keep telling yourself that you will and you will.”
Dean swallowed. “Hello Dad.”
-----O-----
That was why Dean had gone off his own suppressants. He had been keen on mating Castiel and had hoped that being able to scent that Dean was an omega would wake up that part of Castiel and make him realise they were truemates. Dean had known they were for some time now but had been denying it to himself. Now he was a demon he had decided to just take what was his.
“Yeap,” Dean said. “One more week. We’re going out for dinner again after.”
Dean frowned. “So just a peck?”
“Yeah, well I’m bad luck too,” Dean said. “Just ask my dad.”
“I’m good,” Dean said. “You?”
“I was just telling him about Benny’s,” Kali said.
He scrubbed his hands over his face and settled in. He felt for the man that would be on the end of Dean’s questions. This was going to be unpleasant.
Castiel didn’t answer, instead taking a bite out of his club sandwich.
“Having a single father can be difficult,” Castiel said. “The older siblings tend to take on the role of caregiver to the younger.”
“In a manner of speaking,” Dean said. “I am only 18.”
Sam hung up the phone, letting it drop from his hands. He noticed they were shaking and clenched them into fists. He squeezed his eyes closed as he tried to keep his breathing even. Was Dean a demon? Was that possible? Had he taken Castiel and was killing angels to keep him alive? There was only one way to find out.
“Nevertheless I will cure him,” Sam said. “We’ll find Cas’ grace and then we’ll cure Dean.”
“Yeah.”
“He is too non-confrontational,” Kali said. “I can complain for him if he wants. As his boss, I mean.”
He glanced up as he saw a light begin to emit from the sand pit, Sam standing up and walking toward it. The sand swirled around for a moment before a figure appeared in the light, Sam squinting to see who it was. As the light dimmed he spotted Hannah, two other angels flanking her. Sam moved closer as she looked up at him.
Sam had discovered that there were more than 16,000 public libraries in the United States, and an untold number of private ones. He knew he was looking for a needle in a haystack but it was the best lead that he had. He used facial recognition technology to try and find any trace of Metatron and/or Gadreel but it was a very slow process. It didn’t help that he didn’t even have a real timestamp to try and latch onto.
“Something wrong?” Bobby asked. “I thought you were going to dinner with Castiel.”
“That’s a promise,” Dean sneered.
“Cause the guy’s broke and his car sounds bad,” Dean said. “I gave him a rough estimate on how much it would cost to fix the loose belt but my money’s on the fact that’s barely scratching the surface with what’s wrong with it.”
“I’ve been here twice before,” Castiel said. “I don’t eat out much.”
“I didn’t turn him into anything,” Crowley said.
“Yeah, I was thinking that,” Dean said. He filled the kettle and put it on the stove. “I guess I’ll have to owe you.”
“I’ve already been warned by Benny to stay away from her,” Dean said.
Dean broke the kiss to look over to the doorway, spotting Sam standing there with his mouth hanging open.
Castiel took the piece and tried it. “I like that one.”
“We can always lock the blade away if it gets too much.”
Sam knew that he could cure Dean. It was only going to be a matter of finding some way to trap him so that he could. He also knew that the chances of him being able to do that on his own were going to be slim. He really wished he had Castiel there to give him help, but Castiel was a prisoner. Sam didn’t even want to think about what was happening to the angel.
Dean gave him a wave and headed down to his car, driving to the mall. He felt slightly uneasy about the whole thing but knew what he had to do. He pulled into the parking lot and found a park near the entrance. He climbed out and made his way inside, heading straight for the coffee shop. He spotted Anna at their usual table, Anna grinning when she saw him.
“Very good, sir.”
During the lull Dean made his way out to clean up the shop a bit. The high schoolers were probably the messiest of the groups, especially the before school rush. He had to pick up a lot of extra trash during that time. He wiped down the tables without needing to be asked by Kali, and checking to make sure they had enough stock out front for the next rush.
“And you are,” Castiel said.
He stopped dead as he spotted them on the table. They were arranged almost haphazardly but there was some order to them. Little statues carved out of various types of rocks. Dean gently set his bags down and walked over to them, picking up one shaped like a squirrel and turning it over in his hand. He realised this was supposed to be him.
Castiel knew that wasn’t true. He had been in love with Dean for some time now. But that was human Dean, not the demon who sat before him now. Something must have shown on his face or through his bond because Dean smirked.
“Cas, it’s me again,” he said to the answering machine. “Please, if you get this message call me. I’m worried about you.”
“And I was wrong,” Castiel said. “As I often am.”
“Good,” Sam said, eyeing Dean. “We’re over half way now. Only three left.”
“I assume you mean torture,” Castiel said.
“I see,” Dean said. “Well like Kali said he doesn’t work in the shop Monday’s and Tuesday’s anymore.”
There was the sound of shuffling and yelling at the door, Dean straightening in his seat. The throne room doors were thrown open, a small group of lower demons entering. What caught Dean’s eye, however, was the present they had between them. He sucked in a deep breath, scenting the air and catching the familiar scent. Alpha.
“Why?”
“Yeah, a bit,” Dean said. “Not that I’d know.”
“Bloody hell, boy,” Bobby breathed. “Knifepoint or…”
“So you’ve already helped us,” Hannah said. “I trust you killed the host.”
“Nobody’s allowed to mention her,” Bobby said. “I mentioned her once and he damned near punched me for it.”
“I am,” Castiel said. “I’ve also begun saving to have my car repaired although I do not know how much I will need.”
“Is it bad that I’m here?”
“Doesn’t everybody do weed in high school?” Dean said.
“I’ve been trying to track his path,” Sam said. “Work out where he went and try and narrow it down.”
They opened the store, Dean finding no one outside waiting when he unlocked the door and flipped the open sign on. There was a line for the Sugar Heaven though, Dean impressed by the length of it. He wandered back behind the counter and waited, knowing that some of those waiting to pick up their sweets might wander in to get a coffee afterward.
“Mr Singer feeds you well?” Castiel asked.
“Why’s that?” Dean asked.
“I don’t like freebies,” Dean said.
“I mean it’s doing him good to socialise,” Kali said. “He’s never really had a friend.”
Dean’s scowl deepened. He sat up, sliding his phone into his pocket and looking across at Crowley. “You got anyone that needs killing, because I really need to kill something right now.”
“Don’t use ‘sir’ with me, Dean,” Bobby reminded him. “I’m not your daddy.”
“I’m good,” Dean said. “I already changed.”
“Good weather for coffee too,” Dean said.
“I damaged the family name,” Anna said. “You don’t do that. Even Lucifer didn’t do that.”
He stepped back, Sam frowning as he saw tears shimmering in Dean’s eyes as he looked over at Castiel.
“Hey, I got my GED,” Dean said. “I’m doing fabulously.”
Castiel finished unbuttoning his shirt, Dean looking over his chest and spotting nothing new. The tattoo on Castiel’s hip was unchanged, as was the anti-possession tattoo he’d gotten when he’d first became human after returning from the Empty. He paused for a moment before turning, removing his shirt from his shoulders.
“Nearly all of our angels are accounted for,” Hannah said. “We have had trouble contacting a few who refuse to return to Heaven. It is most likely one of them.”
“And eliminate them,” Crowley said. “As messily as possible.”
“And you’re an expert.”
“So basically your average college student,” Bobby said.
Sam picked up on the third ring. “Hey Dean.”
“Gabriel uses milk chocolate,” Kali said. “We did try a darker chocolate one year as well but people preferred the milk. Same the year we tried white chocolate.”
“Yeah, I know. He told me.” Dean shrugged. “He’s planning on easing me into it. Start with training in the workshop first and then ease me into the business side of things.”
“You’re not seeing the big picture here,” Crowley said. “They’re going to sense it. They may have already sensed it. It’s only going to be a matter of time before they work it out.”
“Likewise,” Dean said.
Sam nodded. He figured they wouldn’t drop that given how important it had seemed to them. “So you’re wanting to use me as a middle man again?”
“Understood,” Dean said. “Although I am supposed to meet her Saturday.”
“We will try and get that information,” Hannah said. “The demons have been continuing their own search for Castiel’s grace. And now they have promised to lend their resources to hunt for the Nephilim.”
“Leave me,” Castiel pleaded.
He found a park in the visitor parking and took the bag, heading into the building. He didn’t need to be buzzed in, instead finding an unlocked and open door. Not much security then. He stepped inside and noted that it wasn’t as trashy as he thought it would be, but it was plain and boring. He walked down the hallway, reading off the numbers until he came to apartment three and knocked.
“How did you get inside?”
“Leave me to write your list,” Crowley said. “And try not to break anything this time.”
-----O-----
“I’m fine,” Dean said. “They caught the guy. Cas and I tricked him into going next door where a couple of cops were.”
-----O-----
Dean frowned. “He has classes later than that?”
“We’re talking more than we’re eating,” Dean admitted.
Bobby sighed, shaking his head. “You boys and always looking out for each other.”
“How would you have me act, Dean?” Castiel asked. “Do you want me to lash out at you so that you will have an excuse to beat me?”
Swinging out of his chair Sam headed deeper into the bunker to begin gathering his things. Crowley was going to have a lot of questions to answer.
“Dean,” Anna said, reaching across the table and touching his arm. “You didn’t deserve it. You were just a child.”
Benny left them to it, Dean picking up his wrap and biting into it. He felt a little less guilty knowing it was one of the cheaper things on the menu, but he still didn’t like that he wasn’t going to pay. Then again he wasn’t one about to turn down free food, and he could see that Castiel was going through a similar struggle in his own head.
“Yes, I’ve heard,” Crowley said with a smile. “Making short work of it, aren’t you.”
“I serve no purpose,” Castiel said. “I am also a liability to you.”
“He does,” Dean said. “We tell each other everything.”
“You what!” Crowley slammed the bag down on the table and stared at Dean. “You recharged the angel we have in our dungeon? Are you mad?”
“Still, better sooner than later,” Bobby said.
Dean gave him a grin as he let his body sink down onto Castiel’s cock. He moaned as he was filled, closing his eyes and relishing the feel. He let his body take as much of Castiel as their seating arrangement would allow.
“You realise you guys were the ones who suggested I try and make friends with Castiel,” Dean said as he rejoined Kali.
“But you’re more human than angel,” Dean pointed out.
“I don’t know how you still have teeth,” Kali said.
“That’s messed up,” Dean said. “Is that why you wanted to talk to Castiel?”
“Nope,” Dean said, shaking his head. “We were his soldiers and he was our drill instructor. I think I’ve been hugged more times by Kali than by my father ever.”
“It’s less than he used to write,” Castiel said. “One year he wrote six books. We never saw him at all that year.”
“Dad would flip out,” Dean said.
“So tongue was involved,” Dean said.
“Yeap.” Dean patted his bag. “I got everything on the list.”
Arriving in the kitchen Dean dropped his bag on the table and glanced around. There was no sign of Sam and Eileen yet, Dean filling up and turning on the coffee machine. He dropped some bread into the toaster and pushed it down. Glancing up he spotted Castiel standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, seemingly unsure with what to do with himself.
“And I understand you took his advice.”
“It is… awkward eating alone in public,” Castiel said.
“My mother was my teacher,” Anna said. “When I told her about what it was like back home she offered to take me in. One day it just got too much and I ran away. They took me in and I haven’t looked back since.”
Glancing up at the door Crowley did feel a slight pang about being rejected by Dean. No one had ever rejected Crowley before, at least while he had been a demon. At least no one who had stayed alive. Rejection tended to have fatal consequences when it came to Crowley. Then again so did mating. Crowley had killed his prior mates in the past once they had ceased being useful.
“We suspect that was his intention,” Isiah said. “We’ve been trying to narrow down the location though. He refuses to do so.”
“It’s only rape if you don’t want it,” Dean teased.
“Easier than making coffee,” Gabriel said. “You’ll be wanting people to order hot chocolate it’s so easy."
,” Dean said. “
“No,” Castiel said. “It was during the Christmas rush so the till was full. He made off with a couple of grand.”
Kali smiled sweetly at him and began warming the machines.
“No,” Sam said flatly. “We’re going to cure you.”
“Warehouse jobs like you?” Dean asked. “I want to be a mechanic. Bobby’s training me. I’m good at it, too.”
“If he keeps using me like his attack dog I will have too,” Dean said. “I’m getting sick of running errands for him.”
“Cas,” Dean said softly. “I’m so sorry.”
“Neither was his,” Kali said. “But he understood.”
“I think you’d like this errand,” Crowley said. “A vampire alpha made a deal with me. They broke it.”
Dean didn’t answer but the look on his face was answer enough. Rage burned inside Crowley as he stared at him.
“Hey,” Dean said.
“Loki is a Norse trickster god,” Castiel said.
“Common folk,” Crowley explained. “Being an alpha gave you status. If you wanted to get anywhere it required it.”
Anna’s eyes softened. “Gabriel, please…”
“Then we’ll find something else,” Dean said. “I don’t know. I could set up something in purgatory if you’re that bothered.”
“No, they’re not.”
“I will have ham and cheese sandwiches,” Castiel said. “Followed by cake.”
Dean nodded.
“He is,” Castiel confirmed. “He has been cured. He is human again.”
“It takes a week just for the parts to get here,” Dean said.
Dean noticed that while Castiel smiled at the customers he wasn’t one to talk. He kept his head down and worked, making the drinks quickly and only interacting to state the cost and wish the person a good day. Dean had to admit to himself that he liked the sound of Castiel’s voice, the gruff little edge he had to it making Dean smile.
“Maybe he should be a politician then,” Bobby said.
“So it’s a routine thing,” Dean said.
Gabriel gave him a glare, then smiled brightly and shrugged. “Yeah, I am.”
“I get to decide that,” Dean said. He caught Castiel by the jaw, leaning in to press a soft kiss on the side of his face. “You have your uses.”
“Tomorrow,” Dean said. “Told Sammy I’d stay at a motel for the night.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, nodding. “Frankly I am.”
“Yeah. I remember Gabriel once saying not to make her mad,” Dean said.
“Same as the other. 24 hours,” Crowley said. “Let me reiterate that I think this is a bad idea.”
Letting out a long breath he resigned himself to his situation. There was nothing he could do about it now. All he could do is keep looking for a way out and take it should the opportunity present itself. All he could do for the moment is wait.
“That would be a miracle,” Castiel said.
“I always skipped the meat aisle when I was shopping for Sam and me,” Dean said. “I knew I couldn’t afford it so I never went near it.”
“So you can convince him to give you more money?” Gabriel said. “I told him to stop lending to you.”
“So you’re aiming to be fully independent,” Dean said. “I get it.”
Eventually he decided to just go with it and headed back toward the bed, climbing between the sheets and pulling them up over him to feign sleep. He was just in time too, because he thought he could hear the rumble of the Impala coming back up the street toward the motel. He closed his eyes and settled in to wait patiently, absently wondering if he should have gotten undressed again. Too late now.
“You’re not answering the question.”
“I’ve got better stuff than ramen and energy drinks in the package,” Gabriel said.
Dean nodded. “A couple of years we had even less.”
“Yeah,” Sam said. “I swear we got fleas.”
“That’s fine,” Dean said.
“What? No!” Bobby set the paper down, leaning forward. “You did not deserve to have a single finger laid on you, Dean.”
“I’m being realistic,” Crowley said. “If it were me I would destroy both of them.”
“I’ll pass.”
“Red, white and blue candy,” Kali said. “From the lollipops to the gumdrops. You’d be surprised how well they sell.”
“A very mature decision,” Castiel said.
“He’s working his butt off,” Dean said. “And he’s completely cut himself off from his dad’s money.”
Dean raised a brow. “Do they serve pie?”
Crowley levelled a look on him. “I want you to kill many people. Castiel happens to be on my list.”
“I see,” Castiel said. “That probably works best for me as I don’t have school or work, but I do tend to work on assignments on weekends.”
The blush on Castiel’s face told him his answer.
“Not yet,” Bobby said. “You’ve still got to earn your way off it.”
Dean frowned. “Why?”
“So everyone keeps saying,” Dean said. “I still say it’s messed up what your family did to her though.”
“I do have difficulty in social situations, yes,” Castiel said. “I tend to avoid them.”
“You don’t need my permission to contact your brother,” Bobby said. “Now let’s go.”
“It makes things slower but it could work,” Crowley said. He looked at Hannah. “Trust me, I don’t like the idea of working with angels but we have a common cause. And besides, you’d rather work with me than with Dean.”
“You’ll die in childbirth,” Castiel said. “And Crowley will kill me soon after leaving him to raise our child.”
“Does Gabriel and Kali pay you extra or…”
Dean raised a brow as he wondered if that had ever actually happened to Castiel. “He the one who taught you the ramen diet?”
“Yes Dad,” Dean teased, getting a sour look from Bobby. He bit into his burger, intent on finishing it off.
“Did Gadreel rebel?” Dean asked.
“I’d call this making up for past transgressions,” Gabriel said.
“Well if she could get a job maybe she wouldn’t need to ask for help,” Dean said.
Castiel seemed to emphasise with him. “Does he know what he wants to be?”
“That’s not going to happen,” Dean said, although he was starting to worry now.
“In exchange for money, yes,” Castiel said.
“Feeling better?” Castiel asked.
“A lot of it went to waste,” Kali said. “So Gabriel stopped making it.”
There was a growl, Castiel lifting his head slowly as Dean approached him. Most likely Castiel could scent the other alphas on him. Dean knelt down beside him, reaching out and capturing Castiel’s chin with his hand so that he could lift his head. He gazed into Castiel’s eyes and was pleased to see that there was almost no blue left in them. Castiel’s nose was twitching as he scented him, and he was pulling forward at his bonds.
They left, leaving Crowley to himself. He sighed, taking a longer drink from his glass. He really did hope Dean knew what he was doing. The last thing Crowley needed was an alpha slaughter on his hands. He just hoped Dean had the sense to lock himself in with the angel before his heat became so bad that the alphas were practically forcing themselves on him. Crowley hated having to clean blood up.
“Fine,” Dean said. “I’ll take him for a drive. We’ll both be out of your hair so you can pull your moves on Eileen.”
“They can wait until morning,” Dean said.
“Wipe them all out,” Crowley said. “I don’t care if you turn their pelts into a coat. I just want them dead.”
“You’re doing a suicide mission,” Sam said. “Please. Help me. Capture him and I can cure him.”
“I service their cars,” Bobby said. “A few of them like their classic vehicles.”
Dean never relented with his mocking. Castiel remained silent, standing silently by the table as he leaned back against the wall and stared at Dean. They had made their way through four more injections and Castiel couldn’t yet see any real sign of change in Dean. He could feel Dean’s pain after each injection through their bond, but when he couldn’t Dean had closed off his mind.
“The youngest two,” Dean said. He narrowed his eyes. “You don’t watch them go to school, do you?”
“She’ll learn if she has the police called on her,” Gabriel said. “It’s the only way to get through to her.”
“It goes well,” Castiel said. “Midterms are coming up.”
“Then you don’t know,” Dean said. “You’re guessing.”
“So they say.” Crowley looked him over. “How long have you been down there anyway?”
Dean eyed them both. “Has it ever occurred to you both that I don’t want to be fixed?”
“Right.” Crowley eyed him. “You realise Dean is intent on keeping it.”
“No, I’m good,” Dean said. “He didn’t get away with much.”
Castiel nodded. “It will take several years, but yes.”
“He worked hard for it,” Bobby said. “He’s been on the road his entire life.”
Gabriel narrowed his eyes. “Not instant, I hope.”
“He argues that it meets his requirement for socialising for the day,” Kali said.
“Honestly more than the car’s worth,” Bobby said. “But he’s set on fixing it.”
“So Saturday isn’t a common thing?”
“I love talking with you,” Sam said. “I miss you.”
“Nice,” Dean said. “Leftover meat loaf in mine.”
“I hope you didn’t kill anyone important,” Crowley said as he walked over to him. He eyed the bag. “Follow me.”
“No,” Castiel assured him. “It wasn’t some random alpha, Sam.”
Week three had seen him in Kansas. Dean had been almost tempted to take a side trip to Lebanon to say hello to Sam but had stuck to his guns. This time the man he was after had tried to trap him with witchcraft and devil’s traps but Dean had managed to escape them. By now he was getting angry though and had let Crowley know it. Crowley had been feeding him whatever information he could come across.
Dean stepped into the room, his eyes instantly finding Castiel. He frowned as he crossed the space toward him. “You look shit.”
“What about Sam and Eileen?” Castiel asked. “What do you think they’re planning on doing?”
“Why I got it,” Dean answered. “I say we eat, and then spend the rest of the day in bed.”
“Not everything,” Kali said. “Just a few of the staples. The rest they order in from a local wholesaler.”
“Why?” she asked.
“Sam,” he said. “Your brother is a demon. He needs to be saved. I’m not sure I can make it out of this alive so it’s up to you. Please help him.”
Dean glanced at Sam. “Sam, can I talk with Cas for a moment?”
“You know I could have stayed to help close up,” Dean said out loud.
Dean’s eyes widened. “I mean Castiel.”
“I offered to help her,” Dean said.
“I’ll take care of them when we get back,” Dean promised. And he meant it. He knew that he’d been shirking his duties a lot lately and Sam had been picking up the slack. He had no intention of doing it again. “Just leave them for me.”
“Ha-ha,” Dean said, nevertheless getting up and moving over to the stove to put the kettle on. “I start on Monday, by the way. No uniform, just neat casual and they’ll supply the apron.”
“Yeah, you can smell it,” Dean said. “You didn’t know I was an omega so you never really paid attention, did you. But I’ve smelt you for a while now. I’ve known for a while. Just never thought you’d be interested, being an angel.”
“If you don’t I’m going to dob you in,” Dean threatened.
“I’m finished for the day,” Castiel answered, slowly walking toward him. “We need to talk, Dean.”
“Because your boyfriend is fixated on it,” Crowley said. “I can’t imagine why.”
“We will contact you when we have any information,” Hannah said. “Farewell Sam.”
“You could say that,” Crowley said. He pulled an envelope out of his jacket and held it out. “Here are the details of his last known location. It will give you somewhere to start. Be aware that he seems to have a little band of followers that you will have to deal with.”
“When?” Dean asked. “You’re either working or you’re drunk.”
She looked toward Castiel. “How about you, handsome?”
He leaned forward, pressing a kiss to the corner of Castiel’s mouth. Dean abruptly stood, sliding the empty grace bottle back into his pocket. He gazed down at Castiel for a long moment before he made a small noise of frustration. Castiel watched as he headed toward the door and exited the cell, closing and locking it behind him and leaving Castiel to his own thoughts.
Castiel raised his brows and took another bite from his sandwich.
“I want you to ride me,” Dean said. “Trench coat on.”
Dean found Castiel leaning back against the trunk of his car when he pulled the Impala into the carpark of the diner. Castiel looked exhausted, Dean feeling his own tiredness wash over him at the sight of him. He pulled himself out of the car and made his way over to Castiel, the other man looking up at him as he approached.
Finding himself staring again at how attractive Castiel was Dean tore his eyes away and inched his way around the crowd to the door. It was time for him to head over to Bobby’s.
“I’m okay, Bobby, really,” he assured the older man.
“Fuck no,” Gabriel said. “I earn my way. I didn’t get where I am by licking daddy’s boots like some of the others.”
“He’s just hanging around,” Dean said, Sam almost about to hear his smirk.
“I’ll have you know-“
Bobby nodded. “Think that’s how they met. Benny’s got a boat of his own. You hear him talk about it sometimes.”
“Hm. Good question.” Dean stepped closer, dropping into Castiel’s lap and straddling him. He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s shoulders, narrowing his eyes as Castiel leaned back away from him as far as he could. “You know what, Cas, your alpha smell is stronger now I’m off my suppressants. I can really smell it. It’s like sunshine on a clear day with just a hint of a sea breeze.” He leaned forward, breathing in deep. “You smell good.”
“From what I’ve seen I’m guessing the former,” Dean said. “He comes across as the sort that would get into his study and lose track of time.”
“Much of it would be exaggeration,” Castiel said. “Many of the brothers she accused are narcissists, but they didn’t lay a hand on her.”
“I don’t like having Feathers in my dungeon,” Crowley said. “The sooner you kill him the better.”
“It is weird though, right?” Dean said. “16 kids. Who does that?”
“Right. The special order pickups,” Dean said.
“That must make it hard,” Dean said.
Dean looked up. “Why Ishim?”
“Because he can’t control you?” Dean guessed.
Sam waited in the park beside the sand pit, sitting on the swing set that was way too small for him. His hips were jammed into the space between the ropes almost painfully. He kept his eye on the sand pit, waiting for Hannah to return. She had gone back to Heaven after their meeting with Crowley and after a few days had called Sam to meet her there. She had briefly met him and told him to wait, but that had been hours ago.
“Is sending Dean to kill angels a favour?” Sam asked.
“Don’t do that, Cas,” Dean said, shaking his head. “Don’t just forgive me like that.”
“He did,” Castiel said. “It was always his dream to serve.”
“Probably trying to make himself look kind and compassionate,” Bobby said. “I’ve always questioned his motives for adopting so many children.”
“Apparently he has been double crossing me,” Crowley said. “I want you to find out with who.”
“It’s a comic book,” Dean said. “And movies.”
“At least someone cares about you,” Dean said. “With a family that big I would have thought more than one of them would check in.”
“Cas is going nowhere,” Dean repeated. “Just find his grace, Sammy.”
“Come on,” Bobby said, pulling away. “Let’s get back to looking at those cars. Found one I want your opinion on.”
“I’m still not killing him,” Dean said as he dropped into his seat.
His whole body had ached for a few days after the miscarriage, going about cleansing his body of all traces of his pregnancy. Sam had given him a hot water bottle and routinely checked to make sure it was still warm while Dean dealt with the cramps. He had kept a bucket in his room for the nausea, Sam even taking care of that. Dean was going to have to thank his brother somehow.
By the end of week four Dean was in Mexico City. He found it a bit annoying given his Spanish had never been very good so Crowley had organised him a translator. She was a feisty little demon who was more than willing to join in on a fight, and Dean had noted that she had been flirting with him from the start. He ignored it, sticking to his mission much to her dismay.
“Mark of Cain,” Sam said. “Got it.”
“Is he or is he not trying to find your grace,” Crowley said. “I still think he should kill you.”
“Nice.” Dean smiled. “We were getting low on a few things.”
When Dean had return to Hell he had found Crowley’s people setting up Anton’s body. Apparently while he had been gone Crowley had taken the liberty of getting what little information was left out of the demon before he had told his people to display the body in a prominent position to remind everyone not to double cross him. Anton’s guts were still spilling out of him, his throat slit where Crowley had placed the finally blow.
“They are annual holidays,’ Castiel pointed out.
“I thought you might be interested.”
“Why?” Isiah asked. “What do you want with me?”
“I’ll live,” Sam said. “I mean I’m mostly eating mac and cheese but its food, right?”
“I understand, sir,” Dean said.
Dean glared at him a moment before slipping out of his chair and heading for the throne room door. Crowley watched him go, studying him to see if there were any outward signs yet that Dean was compromised and seeing none. It would only be a matter of time though before it was clear that Dean was with child. Crowley had never been able to understand the omega mind, and it was clear he never would.
“He did,” Crowley said. “I’m surprised you got here so quickly.”
“What has happened to Castiel is regrettable,” Hannah said. “Unfortunately sacrifices must be made.”
“It is a bit,” Dean said. “Besides, I used protection every time. There was going to be no accidents on my watch.”
“You are the smart one, aren’t you,” Crowley said. “Shame your brother didn’t pick up as much in the brains department.”
“Famous for it,” Gabriel said with a shrug.
“I do not enjoy torture,” Castiel said.
“He did,” Dean said. “I was sure if I tried something he would have shot us.”
Kali shuddered as she put the food out. “I don’t even want to think about it.”
“Good,” Crowley said, his voice raising. “Now get out of my sight and take this trash with you!”
“Fine. Have it your way,
He could see Castiel pondering on that. The fact that he took so long to answer was answer enough for Dean. Chuck Shurley was most definitely a douchebag.
“Yeah, she is,” Gabriel said. “I kind of am too. But I get why you did it. You’re going to have to earn back your respect.”
“Not for an angel,” Castiel said. “Dean, this could kill me. It could kill
“Um…” Castiel frowned. “Two years ago I think.”
“So what they’re doing to her is fine?” Dean asked, feeling a flicker of anger. He couldn’t believe that Bobby would agree to something like that.
“So you want me to torture him?” Dean asked, still munching on the chips.
“Don’t be a brat,” she told him. “They have it just as bad next door, and they have to make the candy.”
Castiel smiled.
Dean laughed.
get pregnant. Then again Dean wasn’t a true demon; he was a Knight of Hell. Things must work differently for him.
Castiel thought for a moment. “I have kissed a girl, but I must admit I am mostly attracted to men.”
“I’ll work hard,” Dean promised.
“I see,” Castiel said, sliding his hand free. “I take it this is the part where we have intercourse.”
He had finally worn through one pair of shoes though. He had been halfway through a shift when one of his shoes had begun to pull away at the sole. It had meant a late night trip to the mall to find a new pair, Dean thankful that the shoe store kept late hours just for people like him. This time he had bought two pair, putting one pair aside just in case it happened to him again.
Dean had stuck with his work, finding that he was getting faster at serving the drinks. He was getting less complaints now about his speed, and he was actually starting to find it second nature to make some of the beverages. He was able to actually smile and exchange words with the customers without worrying about making mistakes, although he didn’t allow himself to get too complacent.
“I’m not going anywhere tonight, Dean,” Castiel said. “Except back to a motel with you.”
“Why?”
“True.”
“The waitress,” Dean said. “You seem to have a thing with waitresses.”
She studied him. “Perhaps we can make a deal.”
“Oh my god,” Sam said.
“Hey Cas,” Dean said. “Long time.”
“Hey Benny,” Dean said, glancing once more at the couple and seeing them look away again. “What’s got people chatting about me?”
“Had my first experience with a Karen,” Dean said. “She was going to throw her coffee at Cas but he grabbed it before she could.”
“Maternal instincts,” Castiel commented. “You wanted to protect it.”
“We’ve definitely got to tell Sam now,” Castiel said when he pulled back.
“Nah, he’s not enough of a scumbag,” Dean said with a smile. “He’s too nice.”
“Running a business is a lot of work,” she told him. “Hours of paperwork and having to keep up with inventory.”
“I am not,” Castiel said. “I have my faults but narcissism is not one of them.”
“I’ve had my guards keeping an eye on him, yes,” Crowley said. “Got to make sure the blighter doesn’t escape.”
“That’s none of your business,” Dean snapped. “And it will never be your business.”
“I never have that with Sam,” Dean said. “We’ve always had each other’s backs.”
“Only one way to know for sure,” Dean said. He glanced at his watch. “Show time.”
She nodded. “He manages.”
“Going to do it personally,” Gabriel said, picking up an apron and tossing it over to Dean. “Suit up and come around this side.”
“That’s what I figure,” Dean said. “Tell you what though, the guy that owns the place? He’s family is weird, man.”
“Anyone can dress poor,” Bobby said.
“Is that customary?” Castiel asked.
“I take it the torture was for Crowley,” Castiel said.
“Really now.” He sipped his coffee. “What? State fair awards or…”
He absently pressed a hand against his abdomen. Crowley had warned him. The King was going to be pissed when he found out. Dean knew that Castiel was already mad. He could still sense it through their bond. The most common emotion he could feel though was worry.
“Mate me, Cas!” Dean said. “Come on Alpha. Bite me! Make me yours!”
“Yeah, we did actually,” Dean said, sliding into the seat across from Bobby. “Sounds like his old man had little to do with him growing up. Little to do with any of them.”
“He always proclaimed his innocence,” Benny said. “His family left him out to dry though. Wouldn’t even buy him a lawyer. Ended up doing time as an accessory.”
“That settles it then,” Dean said, slapping his hand on the table. “After we finish here we’re going to find a cinema and see a movie together. Popcorn, drinks, candy, the works.”
Castiel picked up a flask of holy water off the table as Sam approached Dean. Dean snarled as Sam got near him, Castiel splashing the holy water onto him. Dean flinched back and gave Sam the perfect opportunity to stab the syringe into his arm. Sam quickly injected the blood into Dean and stepped back, waiting to see if anything happened.
Gabriel disappeared out the door, leaving Kali and Dean to finish cleaning up the shop. When he returned he had a tote bag filled with goodies, setting it on one of the tables with a piece of paper with the address. Gabriel helped them finish cleaning up, Dean getting the feeling that Gabriel and Kali were on the clock and needed to be out of there by a certain time.
“Umbrellas are for sissies.”
“So why open?”
“Hello brother,” Anna said, turning to face him.
“Go ahead.”
“Get over yourself, John,” Bobby said. “The life you made for these kids is toxic. I’m giving Dean a stable home and the training he wants. He’s got a roof over his head, clothes on his back, and he knows exactly where his next meal is coming from. That’s better than you ever did for them.”
Or it’s because I’m nice to them,” Sam said.
“You made the decision to walk away,” John argued.
Castiel’s eyes blinked open, Dean feeling his heart sink as with each blink more blue began to appear. Castiel was coming out of his rut. Castiel looked around, eyes wide. Dean watched as he began to panic, taking in their situation.
“Castiel is independent,” Dean said. “Not to mention he changed his name.”
“He can be impulsive,” Crowley said. “Slit your throat if the bloodlust gets too much.”
“Crowley back yet?” Dean asked.
“Like an entire vampire nest?”
“That’s him,” Gabriel said. “Decided to up and abandon me.”
“Lucky thing,” Benny said. “Whatever you boys want tonight is on the house.”
“Maybe next time run your choices by me first,” Bobby said. “Hell, even ask Benny. Or maybe Kali since she sounds like she has a good head on her shoulders.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “He snuck up on Sam.”
“I haven’t helped her yet,” Dean said. “I just offered.”
“That’s not going to happen, Dean,” Sam said. “We’re going to cure you, whether you want it or not.”
Dean nodded.
“Don’t know yet,” Sam said. “They’re just looking for expressions of interest.”
“Have you ever been in a long term relationship?” Sam asked.
It had taken him a few days to track down the vampire nest that Crowley wanted dealt with, and another couple of days to wipe them all out. It had been a fairly large nest. Normally Dean wouldn’t have stood a chance going up against such a large nest solo, but now he was a Knight of Hell with the Mark and the First Blade he was virtually unstoppable. He had relished their blood as he had slaughtered them, leaving nothing but bodies in his wake.
Castiel finished putting the money in the bag, sliding it back across the counter. The man grabbed it, glancing into the bag.
“Makes sense,” Dean said.
“Can we see him?”
“Why?”
“You mean like the moon,” Dean said.
Leaning back in his chair Dean stretched his legs out. Things were going to get a lot more complicated from here on out. The Mark on his arm burned causing him to scratch it. He could still feel the bloodlust even though he had killed so many over the last two weeks. He wondered what the Mark would do to the unborn child. He wondered if the Mark had had a role in him being able to conceive in the first place.
“Getting protective of your mate, are you?” Crowley mocked.
“I guess,” Dean said.
“Let’s just say you did a bigger service by taking Castiel out to dinner,” Kali said. “He was a lot more relaxed about what happened this time. He fretted last time.”
“You’re definitely certain of that,” Bobby said.
“I told him to register a complaint,” Gabriel said. “Knowing him he’ll just let it slide.”
Bobby appeared to have been pacing when Dean arrived back at the apartment above the workshop. Dean could see that dinner was ready and on the table although Bobby hadn’t touched his yet.
Dean practically dragged Castiel through the bunker, the former angel protesting a little but otherwise letting Dean lead him. When they reached Dean’s room he pushed the other man in front of him, then stepped inside and closed the door. He rounded on Castiel, fixing him with a firm glare that made the other man squirm.
“I think I brake an average amount,” Castiel said. “No more than anyone else.”
“So you want me to lie to Crowley,” Sam guessed.
“Yeah, I bet,” Dean said. “Worried I’d help her.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “How did you know he’d become a demon?”
“Not anymore,” Kali said. “You’d know that if you stayed in contact with the family.”
“I think everyone has read at least one of them,” Kali said. “They were all the rage about a decade ago. Chuck used to travel a lot and to research. He eventually settled down in town out on the East side.”
“Personally I think he should just let Feathers die,” Crowley said. “But he wants his grace which means technically we should be working together.”
“He’s never answered that,” Castiel said. “I begged him to kill me. He refused.”
“I do,” Castiel confirmed. “I imagine it will be sizeable by the time I finish.”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “He’s done that?”
“Is that a bad thing?” Dean asked innocently.
“Seriously Dean, you don’t have to,” Sam said. “That money is yours.”
“If you were my boy, I’d be telling you how proud I am,” Bobby said. “And I’m gonna tell you it anyway – I’m proud of you.”
“Perhaps,” Castiel said. “As I said – they took significantly more money last time. It is why we keep a minimum amount of money in the till.”
“No,” Castiel said, weakly shaking his head.
“I thought I had already made it clear that Dean is quite happy the way he is,” Crowley said.
-----O-----
“You know that I love it,” Castiel answered.
“What?” Dean mocked. “You think you can take me on? I’m a Knight of Hell.”
He let the body fall back, slipping out of the chair and heading for the door. An alpha tried to block his path but Dean threw him aside with the flick of his wrist. No one else tried to oppose him as he left the café and stepped out into the street. He hooked the angel blade back to his belt and straightened his shirt before he made his way back to Hell.
The next week proved to be uneventful, Dean breezing through it without any hassles. He was really starting to get the hang of the coffee shop now, Kali barely having to tell him what needed to be done for Dean to do it. Gabriel still teased him about him arriving early to the shop. Dean didn’t tell him that it was actually a struggle getting up that early and that before he got a cup of coffee into him he was a sloth.
“Well aren’t you?” Kali said with a sweet smile.
Dean whistled low as he climbed out of his car and took in Castiel’s. He was impressed by the size of it, frowning as he listened to the engine as Castiel switched it off. He waited as Castiel climbed out, Dean looking at the car.
“I mean I’m going home to Bobby,” Dean said. “You’re going home to no one.”
“That’s all there is,” Castiel said.
“I don’t think Castiel would let him,” Dean said. “He wants to be completely independent.”
“How can one family have so much influence you mean,” Bobby said. “One word: money.”
“I definitely don’t have access,” Dean said. “They don’t trust me with the money yet.”
Sam looked at him. “Cas, are you okay? You were gone a long time.”
“I do not have time,” Castiel admitted. “I spend all my free time studying.”
Dean finished his breakfast and sculled the last of his coffee, then washed up his dishes. As he wandered back to his room he looked over to see Bobby had moved to his computer and was no doubt looking for wrecks to purchase on there. Dean left him alone and pulled out his phone, texting Sam to check and see if it was safe to call. He didn’t even have to wait five minutes before Sam texted back that it was.
“Life on the road is difficult,” Castiel said. “When I was younger we moved around a lot. My father believed in finding inspiration on the road. It wasn’t until he adopted Samandriel that he decided to settle in one place.”
“You mean other than working all Wednesday?” Dean said.
“Exactly,” Crowley said.
“A little,” Castiel answered.
“I am nobody’s bitch,” Dean growled. “Not Crowley’s. Not yours. Nobody’s.”
“Sam will at least be proud of you,” Bobby said. “Even if your old man isn’t.”
“I have no interest in them,” Castiel said.
“Not that your brother really needs babysitting anymore,” Bobby said. “Your phone in your name now?”
“Castiel has been going through the same thing,” Kali told him. “He came to the same conclusions.”
Dean walked up the stairs to the flat above the workshop, his feet hurting from having spent the day walking. He put the key in the lock and opened the door, stepping inside. He grinned as he spotted Bobby sitting at the table reading a newspaper, a scowl on his face as he took in the news of the day.
“I earn the same amount as you,” Castiel said. “Plus tips.”
“Perhaps he burned down the kitchen,” Castiel said.
“It’s ‘Sam’,” Sam corrected. “No demon is going to call me ‘Sammy’.”
Hannah studied him. “Is Dean Winchester one of them?”
“Do you get many assignments?”
“Hey,” Gabriel objected. “I got where I am through hard work.”
“So I hear you’re running on borrowed angel juice,” Dean said, stalking around to Castiel’s front. He knelt down beside him, catching Castiel by the hair and pulling him up. “How’s that working out for you?”
“What are you doing to him, Dean?” Sam asked. “Just let him go. He can help find his grace.”
“Any word yet?” Crowley had asked as he found Dean in the library. “It’s been nearly two weeks.”
“One of those being mating?” Dean asked hopefully.
“Like I said – Cas likes you,” Dean said. “He’d be mad if I killed you.”
He knew he had to keep a low profile to prevent Sam from working out that Dean was a demon. Crowley had given Dean a stern talking to about preventing his brother from finding out what he really was now. Dean knew that Sam would insist on “curing” him if he ever found out. Dean had no intention of ever letting that happen.
Dean nodded, sipping from his drink. It was top shelf stuff. “Any leads on his actual grace?”
Dean grabbed a knife and began to make their sandwiches, having to admit that Castiel was very good at keeping secrets. He hadn’t known at all about Castiel and his rock carving. Dean wondered if maybe he should take up a hobby. Castiel had commented once that he loved Dean’s drawing. Maybe he should draw a picture for Castiel for his “becoming human” day. He just hoped he would be as good at keeping it a secret as Castiel was.
Dean looked up at the word ‘pie’. “I definitely need to check out Benny’s.”
Dean climbed into the car, his thoughts running at a million miles a minute as he waited for Castiel to join him. He turned the engine over and began heading in the direction of the motel he intended to stay at that evening.
He paused outside the door to Dean’s room and knocked. There was no response even though Crowley could sense that Dean was on the other side of the door. Given that he was the King and this was his domain Crowley threw caution to the wind and pushed the door open. When nothing charged at him he took a step inside.
“Great.” Crowley sighed. “So we’re stuck at square one.”
“We believe it was your brother.”
Castiel nodded. He tilted his head slightly. “Has she attempted to proposition you yet?”
“Should I let Castiel know she was here?”
“He’ll be fine,” the doctor said. “We want to keep him overnight just to be sure. He sustained a bit of blood loss.”
“Good morning,” Castiel said.
“Delusions of grandeur,” Gabriel said. “Can you believe he wants to become a Professor of Religion and teach at Colleges?”
“Then I guess I better avoid getting injured,” Dean said.
“Well I would, except you keep killing them,” Crowley shot back. “What is wrong with you? Tell me!”
“They can do what they want,” Benny said. “They own this here town. They can give you everything they want, or they can make your life miserable. You’ve got a good deal going with Gabriel. Don’t mess it up over one girl.”
Dean nodded. “Apparently Castiel was giving her money.”
