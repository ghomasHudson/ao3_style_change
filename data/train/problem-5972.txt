"Is zat so, sveethearrrt?" The man on the other side of the door said, amusement clear in his voice as he knocked on the door once more, before letting out a joyful laugh, causing Steve to flinch and back away from the door wondering what was going to happen to him now. "Just kome out, sveethearrrt, I prrromise I von't hurrrt you; I just vant to… talk," The man said, causing Steve to shake as he tried to back away from the door, fearing that the man may have a gun on his person.
." Steve whispered, wishing desperately that Tony would finally mark him as his.
"I did tell you, Jarvis, everyone leaves in the end; so this shouldn't be a surprising thing." Howard stated, waving goodbye to his raging friend who could only curse and slam his clipboard into the ground. Howard on the other side could only frown darkly as he continued his way; everyone leaves at the end that was the ultimate truth, no one will stay forever like they promise, because they are liars and good actors who always end up stabbing you in the back so they can leave. No one stays, that was the truth that Howard knew for decades, and will continue to believe in until the end of the time, no one stays, but maybe, just maybe…
Translation:
They were still kissing desperately when they entered their honeymoon suite heading straight toward the bedroom; Tony couldn't help but let happy noises every time Steve leaned his head for a breathtaking kiss. "Are you sure, sweetheart?" The words were spoken in a warm puff of breath against Tony's neck, followed by lazy, open-mouthed kisses over the bonding gland causing Tony to shiver in arousal when the beard scratched his sensitive skin and happiness at his husband being thoughtful and respecting his wishes.
Lauds — at 3 a.m. or at dawn
"Yes, I am, no thanks to you brother." Thor's brother stated, which made the thunder God take a step back, hurt coloring his face as he gazed at what Tony was going to dub as Thor2. "Do not worry mortals; I am going to leave as soon as I pay my debts," Thor2 stated with a raised nose, gazing at them with a grimace on his face, which was kind of rude if Tony had to say anything. "I wonder what he saw in you…" Thor2 muttered, which made Tony growl, finally getting feed up with Thor's arrogant brother.
The Alpha looked around the place and then give a small nod, which made the Omega smile happily, hope taking hold of his heart as he rushes to reheat the food, trying not to feel sad when the Alpha tensed, not taking his eyes off him when he stood up to reheat the food, the blond didn't comment on how the Alpha stood in the doorway, he didn't comment on the eyes that took every move he made, he didn't comment on the hard unsmiling face, he just accepted them as a fact as he hummed a little, returning the dishes to their original places after they start steaming.
When he finally managed to contain himself Tony turned toward Steve, only to see the man gazing at the little boy like he was a gift sent from the Gods, Sparkles were in his eyes and his face was stretched into a wide and creepy grin. "He… is… perfect!" Steve called out, a mad laugh leaving his lips as he picked the baby from Tony's arms, causing the baby to squeak and gurgle as Steve spin him around before bringing him to his chest for cuddles. "I am so sorry for thinking that you were a boring normal when you weren't!" Steve cooed to the baby getting giggles coos in return; the sickly sweet sight caused Tony to grin happily, letting out a sigh as he imagined what the future would be like raising a humanoid spider baby (Well, it was way cooler than vampires, they are too boring and common for Tony's taste, he bet no one had a spider baby before he and Steve got their hands on one.)
Since Hydra refused to show its true face Steven had to swallow his pride and wait a little longer, even if it meant smiling tightly at Pierce when the man starts kissing his ass and start digging to see if Steven was going to be on Hydra's side, Peggy and him had to make a full proved plan, Steven and her even discussed the idea of him going undercover, considering no one but the Avengers know about him or his life considering that he was from another universe, which gave him many advantages, especially considering that he wanted to infiltrate Hydra.
"Tony, you know what happened when you come with me, it happens every time!" Steve pouted, gaining a sigh from Tony who looked at him like a kicked puppy… unfortunately for Tony; Steve had mastered the art of defending himself against such a look, which meant he was immune... sorta. "Tony…" Steve said in a playful tone pushing Tony outside of the bathroom and closing the door, which got him a squeak of betrayal from Tony.
"Papa!" Peter's voice made the two of them freeze and pull away from each other, Tony cleared his throat as he closed the few buttons that he didn't know when Steve opened and looked at the flushed Alpha beside him who runs his hands through his hair before going to the guest bedroom when Peter fell asleep half an hour ago.
"You are alive and you a-re my…" Tony let his words trail, getting a nod from Steve, which made the Omega lean on his bed. "I saw my parents, they weren't dead, right?" Tony's voice cracked, he looked at Steve who paused and gives Tony the newspaper to read. The Omegas lips wobbled as he read about the Starks reappearance a year after their supposed death. By the end, tears were running down Tony's face, it made Steve tear up, suddenly Tony turn to him with fear. "My baby! Oh, God, where is my baby?" Tony nearly screamed, making Steve move fast to calm the Omega.
His husband surges against him with a particularly vicious thrust, but Tony feels nothing but love, love, love as Steve made him orgasm. Steve's knot slipped in and it's like a sigh of relief as Tony's body stretches to accommodate it, and when Steve bit his gland, Tony couldn't help but give a wake moan as another orgasm wracked him.
Reaching Steve's room, Tony had to take a deep breath, so deep, that when he kicked the door, he didn't feel like shit for trespassing. When the door opened, Tony gave a confused noise when he saw that instead of the door leading to Steve's room, it actually leads to stairs that go down and down with no visible end to them; it will be totally justified if Tony turned around and ignored this place, but his anger is far too strong for his fleet instincts to work.
"Nice to meet you, Harley…" Howard smiled as he said those words causing the little boy to give a fleeting smile before letting go of his hand, and that was only because he nearly got run over by Peter who pulled him into a tight hug and squealed happily that his friend was coming to live with them…
"Get out." Tony finally gathered enough courage to choke out, trying to stop shaking when Obadiah frowns darkly at him. "Get the fuck out!" Tony screamed, his heart pounding like a crazy bird in his chest.
' and '
Everyone in this mansion had unhealthy coping methods, Howard with him being a workaholic and always searching for his son, even when Maria and Peggy would beg him to stop, to let go, to leave Tony to rest in peace. Maria who either spent her days on anti-depressed meds, or out fighting for Omegas' right, who created a hospital just for Omegas in need, with support Alphas system, a new idea that shook the world, but helped every Omega to stand on their feet. Peggy who nearly followed Howard in his methods of being a workaholic, who couldn't handle Howard's begging, who adopted Natalia who was near Tony's age when he was kidnapped, just to stop the hollowed feeling inside of her. Angie, who was always emotional, screaming her mind without filter, not caring who she hurt, because she just wanted the hurt in her heart to stop, who was only ever calm when she was with Natasha, never with Peggy, for she thinks that it was her mate's fault that Tony was dead… and Jarvis, poor old Jarvis, who became a ghost, who punished himself daily every time he passed Tony's room, who accepted being ignored by Angie and screamed at just because he was too weak to stop what happened, Jarvis, who wanted Tony's happy memory to stay with everyone, but no one wants that to remember the pain, no matter how much Steve snapped at Angie to stop her pointless abuse, no matter how much Steve and everyone else reminded her that it wasn't Jarvis's fault, no matter how much Steve spent time with Jarvis to remember a loved person that was long gone, no matter how much Steve see the gratitude in Jarvis' tired eyes, he knows it wasn't enough… he knows that if Tony saw what Angie was doing to a person he cared about so much that he named one of his greatest creations after… the teen would be crushed…
"Overacting? Me? Of course, it is always me! Of course, it is me who is overacting when my son is going to die any day now!" That shut both Tony and Bucky making them freeze in their place when they saw the Omega's glassy eyes and only now they were able to catch the faded scent of pain and salt in the air informing them that Steve had been crying before they showed up. "It is always me! My fault for falling in love with a lair, my fault for falling pregnant, my fault for my son being sick, it is always me, isn't it? I spent eleven fucking years taking care of a child alone, trying desperately to make ends meet, but two months of him showing up and one mistake later and suddenly it is my fault, suddenly everyone starts overlooking his mistakes because he starts paying child support after years of fucking everything that walked with two legs and drinking himself to death, years of abandoning his child, years of me trying to keep our son alive working three jobs just to keep a roof over our heads… suddenly it is me who is overacting!" Steve's voice cracked, making Tony and Bucky watch in horror as tears start running down Steve's cheeks, the two Alphas were frozen in place unable to move and comfort the Omega who raised his hand and wiped his tears away, trying to regain his breath. "Why did you come back? Why couldn't you just stay dead? Why? Why did you have to break whatever left of our hearts, Tony? Why now?" Steve said tiredly as he looked at the Alpha, pleading with him to answer the Omega's questions, and Tony could do nothing but look at the Omega, his tears start running down his face as he saw Steve's tired and pained eyes looking at him with resignation, already knowing that the Alpha wouldn't answer these questions, that he couldn't answer them… because he has no answer of his own…
Tony didn't let Harley protest before he stood up and took his hand, being gentle with him as he steered the boy with him, his hand was firm not allowing Harley to escape from his grasp. "Mr. Stark! L… let go…" The last part of Harley's speech was a fearful whisper that Tony barely heard over the loud New York noises. Tony's heart clenched and he had to stop himself from breaking, he had to be strong.
"Stevie… sweetheart… I don't know what to say…" Peggy whispered after a short period of silence, her words caused Steve to sniffle as he tried to regain himself least he start crying again. "I… it's…it's not… this life you told me about… it's not real, Stevie…" Peggy whispered after a few failed attempts to speak, her words causing Steve to let out a confused noise and look at her with shock and betrayal in his eyes. "W-what you said… all of it… is not real. Stevie… today is October 10th, 2011. Seven years ago you and your husband James Buchanan Barnes were involved in a car accident, which ended up with you falling into a coma and losing the baby…" Steve froze at those words, looking at Peggy like she lost her mind; because what in the seven hells was Peggy talking about. 2011? That's not true, it's not true, it was 2015, last time he checked the date it was November 21st, 2015; that's aside, the most important question was, who the hell was James Buchanan Barnes?
"One day a couple showed up, claiming that they were on the run with nowhere else to go. They were both men, so we didn't doubt their claim, especially when… you know how the sixties and the seventies were to gay men if one of them wasn't a carrier." Tony hummed, nodding his head, already feeling like he wasn't going to like the story; not one a bit, and he was proven right when Natasha continued. "It turned out that they have heard about Rogers and the strange town that took the unwanted people, giving them a second chance. The two of them were sciences or something like that; needless to say, they were planning on capturing Rogers and dissecting him, wanting to know how he works and the source of his powers. We didn't know that at first, the two of them were just respected gentlemen, helping people around the town and making a life here. We didn't notice that something was amiss, not even when Rogers would refuse to show himself when the two of them visit the lake he lived in…" Natasha trailed off, probably not knowing what to say from the way she became pale like she was remembering a horrible memory.
Reaching his room, Steven froze a little because Tony was waiting for him near his door with a frown on his face when his eyes fell on Steven's form; it was making Steven a little bit uncomfortable because out of everyone, he didn't want Tony to look at him when he was like this. "Are you really OK? I know some good therapist if you are interested." Tony said gently which made Steven press his lips tightly.
"There is no mate." Steve ends up saying after an awkward period of silence which made Tony shuffle on his feet, and start walking once the Alpha regains his barrier and followed the Omega… this was awkward. It was just Tony's luck that his tongue became tied up now, where was his legendary sass when he needs it?
I know… I know… you all hate me for publishing another story…
Tony climbed into the backseat of the car, sitting between Pepper and Rhodey, catching up; Natasha drove out of town, along the winding narrow lane through the lakes. They arrive at the trail and Natasha parked alongside his house, letting the engine idle while Tony and his friends got out, Tony letting them take in the sights as Rhodey took of their stuff out of the trunk. Tony ended up leaning through the open window and kissed Natasha's cheek, and promises to be in touch soon before stepping back and giving a wave as she drives off down the road, Clint hanging out of the window as he waved goodbye.
Steve turns to the small slip of paper and took it, ignoring Sam who slammed his head on the bar and Bucky who plead with Loki for another drink, only to get water thrown at his face. Steve sighed at his friends' antics and turn to the paper, reading it and rereading it with a sad look on his face, it was such a sad thing, and Steve knows that if it was him instead of the Omega, he would have burned the world, because Peter was his world, and losing him, it meant that Steve was going to lose his sanity.
"I offered him the money, he was the one who refused it; I offered to take the child, and he refuses too, what do you want me to do? He is not my problem as much as my idiot son's." Howard huffed, turning his face away from the sight he was gazing at; already feeling more grumped than he did a few minutes ago.
"Yup, the one and only…" The Alpha said with a small grin which caused the boy to start hopping in his lap, ignoring that only a few minutes ago he was angry and sad that the Alpha didn't show up, and it caused the older man to laugh at that a little, at how his son ignored everything else if he felt that something important was coming up.
"Remind me again, the whereabouts of your staying?" Phillips asks curiously after Tony left the bathroom, which made Tony tense after he returned the kit, trying to be subtle in backing away, but knowing from the man's eyes that he wasn't at all, which made Tony swallow at that. "Didn't think there was anything on the market, not since the Jones' cabin was sold yesterday, it is just outside of Atlanta in Fairburn, someone by the name Stane bought it." The old man said after he took the kit from the teen and put it back in its place, and Tony froze at that, looking at the man with wide eyes, which made the man hum and nod his head at that. "Sorry kid seems that you are late." The man said in what Tony wanted to say was the least sympathetic voice he ever heard in his life.
"…do you think he is waiting for someone?" Tony finally dared to ask after a while of silence, his mind thinking about what Bucky and Peggy told him months and months ago about their '
It started as a normal morning, a good one too… Steve was the gentleman he always was, taking care of Tony and Peter making sure that the two of them got their breakfast and enjoy their time, he even took them out to the park, mainly for Peter so that the little boy will play with kids his age, while Tony and Steve sat in the back on one of the benches next to each other, talking and laughing, with Tony telling Steve about his plan of installing his Ai in the house as a security system.
"Actually… we are the Guardians of the Galaxy…" The man with the mask and goggles said, lowering his guns when Steve squeezed the rodent tightly that it gave a whimper; at the man's answer Steve's eyebrow gave a twitch and a growl left him.
Steve took his glass of water and took a sip from it, looking at the table deep in thought before he looked at the man with a tired look on his face, letting out a sigh when his eyes fell on Tony's pleading face. "You sound so certain that we could solve everything and make it alright…" Steve said as his eyes fell on his glass and he starts swirling the water inside. "Just so that you remember, this is a one chance offer only… you do something wrong or make Peter sad, we are over…" Steve said after he took another sip of his glass and put it down, looking at Tony who had a determined look on his face…
Steven hummed to himself as he walked toward the library, planning on searching for a few books to read to pass the time when he doesn't have anything else to do, he knows that Edith could prepare any book he wanted from the huge library downloaded in her system, but even then, Steven didn't want to exhaust Edith, even when the AI complained to him that she does nothing but sit still on his face since the start, doing nothing but hacking into Shield and other countries' database in search of any traces of Hydra and the Red Room.
"God no, she is on a romantic vacation with her husband, lucky…" Bruce grumbled, which ended with Tony laughing happily, causing Bruce to give a small smile, the two of them chatted for a few more minutes catching up before Bruce went over the tests results that Tony took. It was only a few moments before Tony was lying on the chair ready for his ultrasound, nervously shifting in his seat, gazing at an equal nervous Rhodey and Pepper.
"I really wanted to say, no, but this is the opportunity of a lifetime, Steve!" Anthony said breathlessly after he stopped beside the bed making Steve caress his right cheek, which made the Alpha sigh in content and blink his eyes. "I still can't believe that my father gave me this opportunity Steve, my father usually refuses for me to go and give presentations or even leave the labs… this is… I can't believe it… do you think I should cancel it? I mean I am not ready right?" Anthony asked with shaky hands.
"I… I ended up marrying an Addams…" Tony admits, his voice sounding distant even to his own ears, and Tony wondered if he really deserved the title genius when he so easily fell into Rogers trap. Just one date he said, it won't hurt he said, Tony can decide how it could go he said! It should have never ended up in marriage!
"Oh? Then tell me, dad, what do you think we should do? Because I am keeping the baby…" Tony said he could feel the room get colder after he said that, making him look at Howard who was making a good job of acting like a fish in the water.
It was just a stupid comic, Tony shouldn't get worked up because the names he read where the same names that were the reason for his life being destroyed like this, and Tony, he was tired, so, so tired of always getting his hopes up, only for them to dash away not a few seconds down the road.
"Why, thank you! Hearing this complement does nothing but boost my ego." Tony let out a happy sigh as he turned to the mirror once more to check his butt. "By the way, does my ass look fat?" Tony asked suddenly, making Rhodey choke on his breath for a second before he finally lost it and start laughing, looking at Tony like the genius was the one losing his mind.
Today at dinner, to Tony's unfortunate luck or fortunate depending on how you view it, everyone was sitting at the dinner table, eating, laughing, joking around, the only one who wasn't there was Steve, who was off on a S.H.I.E.L.D. mission; when Tony knew about this, you can say that Tony sulked fiercely, not that he will ever admit it if someone asks, but still…
"Steve…?" Peggy breathed the name getting a hum from the man that was lying on the bed, the man in question gave a little yawn and looked around the place.
"28…" She said after looking at Peggy with fear and confusion, which made Steven glare at her harshly, making her swallow and not moving her eyes from him again without his permission.
"Yeah, sorry about that, but you see, your crazy A.I. locked us in the workshops so…" Tony started giggling nervously, the noise made Steven zero on him with narrow eyes and tilted head a puzzled look pasting on his face, a movement that made Tony blink his eyes but soldier on, avoiding the fact that he just saw Steven kill more than a thousand people in the past three hours.
In 2008: The events of Iron Man 1, followed by Peter being diagnosed with Leukemia.
Steve walked inside of the bar looking around the place, hoping that he will spot his friend, Bucky was with him already complaining about his Ma trying to set him up with an Omega that apparently all of the neighborhood knows. Steve sighed at that and drag Bucky to the bar when he spotted their friend lying his head on the bar, Loki was humming and cleaning some glasses while listening to what the Beta was saying. Ever since Steve and Peter left the park, the Alpha had taken his pup to his Ma, knowing that the Alpha was waiting happily to see her grandson, his son was in a happy mood that day, showing his new toy to his grandma and telling her all about that Omega who was all alone in the park and gave him that toy because he was brave, when Sarah was told by Steve that the person Peter was talking about was an Omega, the Alpha was shocked because ever since the small pup turned five, he was deathly scared of Omegas, and him going to talk with one made the two of them confuse but hopeful, it was then that Bucky barged in their house and dragged Steve away nearly shouting at Steve that the two of them should elope from the country because Winnie was planning on sitting Bucky up with Steve… Sarah the saint that she was told Steve to have the night to himself and hopefully be able to calm Bucky who was frantically tugging on Steve's sleeve like a child looking around the place like his Ma was going to appear out of thin air any minute now, she promised to put Peter to bed. That's how the two of them ended up going to Loki's, their friend Sam had called Steve that morning and he sounded like shit like he really needed to talk about his day.
"So, what did Winnie do this…" Tony's words trailed when he opened the door, furrowing his eyebrow when he saw a strange woman standing on the other side of the door. The woman was familiar in a way that made Tony furrow his eyebrows, wondering where he saw the woman before. "Can I help you, Ma'am?" Tony asked when he saw the woman frown and a scowl nearly took over her face, causing Tony to tense.
"Do you wanna go inside for a coffee?" Steve asked and Bucky laughed at that nodding his head. "But first… I wanna introduce you to someone." Steve said with a mischievous look pulling Bucky to the house next to his and knocking on the door, a few seconds' later footsteps could be heard from the inside and the door was opened and Bucky had to focus to be able to see the small blur with the blue baseball hat rushing to hug Steve tightly.
Damn! I did a lot of research for this chapter, my head is spinning! Though it was fun learning so much about Vikings, if you will excuse me, I will return to my searching about Vikings' lives 😂
"Nay, little one, we were going to wake you up, but you seemed too tired, what about an ice-cream as a sorry from both of us?" Steve, sweet merciful Steve, smiled like an angel at Peter as he said those words, pushing Tony away and stood up and picking Peter and holding him in his embrace. The pout on Peter's lips disappeared, and a mischievous grin took over his small face, the same grin was on Steve's face, and Tony doesn't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing that those two were as thick as thieves.
"Does that… does that mean I have to go back to the clinic?" Harley asked, curling on himself as he tried to make himself smaller than he already was, he was probably afraid of going back to the clinic and being forced to get adopted by someone else, or maybe he was even thinking about his punishment for running away.
"Howard, what are you doing here?" Jarvis's confused voice made Tony turn his head to the side, to see his father leaning on the wall beside the door and frowning while looking at Steve, something that made the hair on Tony's body to rise, and a raging growl nearly left his throat, if it wasn't for the sob of pain Steve let out, which shifted Tony's attention to his mate once more.
"What about the eloping? What was Stark's plan? Did he ever plan on telling us of his genius if his plan worked by a miracle?" Bucky snapped as he couldn't take this anymore, Steve could be out there, no, Steve was out there, he knows that punk and he knows that the Omega will refuse to die and will give Howard a hell before he did, but the Omega was out there, with a kid! A kid that he was probably struggling to feed and clothe, why didn't Steve go to his family for help, why didn't he sent a letter, Bucky would have left just to be with Steve, did the Omega trust him so little?
"You… you are an idiot…" Tony murmured gazing at their hands, with a tired look on his face, and Gods above how much does Steve want to wipe that look away, he wanted to return, back before the mansion was destroyed, where Tony would invite him to his workshop and the two of them will talk about the many sciences that are to be found across the universe, back when everything was simple.
Tony gazed at the house in front of him, not getting out of the car, blinking his eyes in tiredness as his breath hitched now and then as he tried to calm himself down, not wanting a repeat of the meltdown that happened this morning in the Stark tower's underground garage. A hitched sob get stuck in Tony's throat, as he wiped his eyes with his sleeve not wanting his tears to fall again, trying to get his shit together lest he starts screaming because there was no way… no way…
It was tiring, to take care of a baby, and work ten hours on top of that, but they had a roof over their heads and food on their table, so Steve was grateful and never complained. Steve also met a few of his neighbors, when he first came to live in the modest and cozy home that the kind doctor gave to him, the Parkers were the kindest, Ben and May their names, they took a shining to him and his baby, they were a newlywed and moved here from Brooklyn too, May adore Peter, and will always babysit him when Steve had to go to work as she was a housewife, the little boy loved her and Ben calling the two of them uncle and aunt which made the two very happy.
As much as Tony wanted to run away from this town, as much as Tony wanted to pack everything and go with his friends in the middle of the night like how the Rogers family did, Tony simply couldn't. Even with Howard being in Malibu, there was still the danger of him and his spies hovering around Rhodey and Pepper's home, not to forget the chance of Tony running into Morgan's biological father, the man was crazy enough to force himself on Tony in the Stark's own mansion, Tony can't shake the feeling of that crazy man keep taps on him and stalking him too, Tony was sure of that. Also Tony can't just rip Morgan of her life from here, even if she was a few weeks old and wouldn't remember a thing, Tony can't.
Why did you do this Tony?
… Tony's mind could only chant as he tried to reach the lake, hoping that everything would turn out fine if he asked for Rogers's help once more. "Found you." A voice hissed behind Tony and before he managed to do anything Tony could only cry in pain as Howard managed to grape him by his hair and kick his left leg hard, causing Tony to lose his footing and crash on his knees. "For a useless, bitch, you are good at running away." Howard sneered as he shook Tony by his hair, making Tony whine and huff, gazing at the lake that was so close and so far at the same time. "Now that you are here, it is time to go; I hope you said your goodbyes to the pest upstairs." Howard huff in annoyance, pulling Tony harshly by his hair to a different direction than the house, causing Tony's heart to drop to his stomach; the thought of him leaving his baby alone in that room was terrifying…
So what do you think?
"Because you wanted to spend the rest of the day lazing around so that you wouldn't come and practice... lazy couch potato." Steve said which made Tony pout and stick his tongue at Steve, as he walked around the Alpha with head held high, which made Peggy shook her head at the two of them, but caused Peter to giggle and snuggle into his mother…
"You know, you sound like a foolish parrot repeating the same Sentence only to get the same answer." Steven mocked back, and he can feel the shock coming from the advisors behind the king, just as the man's face turned dark and his eyes murderous while he was looking at Steven, glaring harshly at him hoping that the Omega will take his words back, which only made the Omega hum and raise his head, looking at the Alpha with the corner of his eyes… the picture of arrogance, which only made the Alpha glower at him and thrust the door open ordering him with a harsh voice to get out, that made Steven lower himself to raise his son in his arms and walked out of the cell, only to feel a tight hold on his right arm making him wince, especially when the king starts dragging him as he walked out of the cellar to the ship and then off of the ship to the land, all the while Steven was keeping a careful eye on his friends who were being led by the advisors behind the king and Steven.
Fury stayed silent, looking at his coffee mug with a thoughtful look as if he was trying to string his thoughts in one line, trying to separate them to get the right answers for the questions Tony was throwing back and forth. "I don't really know what to say… thirty years have passed, and I think nearly everyone here forgot the real Steven Rogers and replaced his ideals with that…
Dr. Banner smiled sympathetically when he discovered the fear on Tony's face; he shook his head, which made Tony let out a relieving sigh. "Nothing is wrong, Tony, it's entirely reasonable for your body to go through so many changes, specifically when you are approaching heat for the first time in two years." Dr. Banner assured; Tony's eyes though they widen comically at the doctor's assurances, his mouth dropped a little, the term 'Heat' echoed over and over in his mind like a mantra that he didn't hold the concept of it still.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence, a near character's death, Tony not helping while being a little shit, and Steve screams his head off! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Tony smiled as he starts singing, slow dancing with his daughter who seemed to calm down and look around trying to find the source of the music. The two spent a few more minutes Tony singing under his breath as he moved, smiling happily when Morgan calmed down and leaned her head on Tony's shoulder. "Ah, so you love Daddy's favorite song, don't you sweetie?" Tony asked pulling his head to gaze at his daughter who was cooing and snuggling in his embrace, Tony chuckled a little bit before he ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to replay the song once more before Morgan was finally asleep. "Goodnight, baby, sweet dreams," Tony whispered as he put his daughter in her crib before kissing her forehead, smiling at her one last time before covering her with her blankie... tonight seemed colder than Tony expected.

If only Tony can leave this place and accept Rhodey and Pepper's offer; Tony though, knows that if he showed his face anywhere near his friends or near anyone who knows his father it will be the end. Not only will Howard lock Tony away for the rest of his life to marry him to the next person who will pay more than Stane, but he will also get rid of Morgan, in the most painful way possible while making Tony watch (Tony still remembered the cat he owned when he was just a kid; he still remember how Howard run it over when he disobeyed him) And if Howard knew about his Mom involvement in helping him escape, God's only know what he will do to her.
"Oh, can you tell me more about them, I am pretty confident I know where they departed to, I know a lot of stars." Steven said making the young boy look at him with wide disbelieving eyes as if asking him 'Really?' which made Steven melt a little at that expression. "Really, you know why?" That earned him a headshake, and a grin fluttered on Steven's lips. "Because I'm a star…" Steven winked, which led Peter to squawk and bolt out of his father's embrace. His eyes couldn't get any wider than they were now.

When the time to leave came, Anthony's heart was pounding, he wanted to cancel this madness and stay here with Steve, he wanted to be with the Omega so the two of them will be able to plan their eloping together, but in the end, Steve caress his face and told him that he can do it, that he was Anthony Carbonell. When it was finally time and Anthony was in the car he made sure to wave to Steve until the Omega was out of his sight…
"All is well, young prince." Heimdall assured the look in his eyes soften even further before he let out a sigh and tilted his head, looking like he was listening to something far away. "Though you should hurry, my prince, your father is waiting for you in the throne room." Heimdall stated before giving Thor a nod, returning back to his posture with a frown; Thor watched Heimdall narrowing his eyes as if he was trying to see farther away than anyone can, an action that filled Thor with nostalgia.
"We agreed on Morgan, I like that name." Tony finally said leaning on Steve after a while, a big smile on his face as he looked at his family laughing and cheering, his mother taking his daughter carefully as everyone went close to look at the new addition to the Stark family, happiness fluttering inside of Tony at the sight, maybe Steve was right in the end…
The older man just smiled and shrugged his shoulders, Steve was told that day that he inherits the doctor's house in Queens, New York, it had made Steve jaw fell a little, he tried over and over to tell the man that he was wrong that the doctor's children or grandchildren will be better at getting the house, Steve was scared that this was all dream that he will wake up from it soon, but the older man insist that everything was as it was said in the will, that the will specifically mention Steve and that if the Omega refused the house it will go to his pup, it was all surreal that Steve felt like he was half asleep when the older Beta put the keys to the house in his hand.
It wasn't until the doctor left that both Steve and Tony managed to snap out of their stupor, the two of them looking at each other before Tony went to set on the bed, his legs became too weak to hold him up. "Are you OK?" Steve asked after a few minutes, coming to sit beside Tony who leaned on him, his nose scrunched in deep thoughts. "What do you think?" Steve prompted Tony once more, trying to make him talk; his action only got him a blink from Tony before the Omega let a tired sigh.
"Are we there, yet?" Natasha asked for the millionth time making Steve sigh and glance at the twenty years old female, which was playing with his phone while chewing gum.
(See the end of the chapter for
Poor Peter! I made him cry! And I also made Tony cry, but oh, well…
"No Sir, I don't fight using a Shield, I mostly fight with knives and guns." Steven said and he can hear some people in the back gasps like they were told that whatever the hell they believed in was not true, because Captain America without a Shield? That was a sin! And Steven wondered how his eyes didn't jump out of their sockets at how much he rolled them at the questions he received, he wondered if Hydra will take mercy on him and crash this stupid conference.
So what do you think?
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of angst, near-death situations, hunting and animal's death, Steve being protective AF, and Tony having inappropriate thoughts about Steve!!! All reviews are appreciated.
"Tony." Steve said with a small smile, making the Omega's heart flutter, and Tony's out to check his heart with a doctor because his heart always does this fluttery thing around Steve. "Here…" Steve said awkwardly as he gave Tony a box of chocolate which made the Omega's heart flutter at that for a bit.
"Goddammit, enough!" Tony snapped as he tried to pull Steven off, which thankfully the man followed him without breaking from his hold, probably didn't have it in him to be rough with Tony when he knew that Tony was already in a delicate state. "Natasha, take Rogers to Bruce, or better, taking him out of the mansion until Steven calm down." Tony ordered, causing Natasha and Clint to rush toward Rogers and helping him to stand before rushing him out of Steven's sight before the man loses it. "And you, come with me!" Tony hissed as he dragged Steven back to his workshop, ignoring how Peggy starts following them with a dark look of her own.
After all, Steve was crazy, a crazy and coward person, with a dead mate that decided to take his revenge on Steve by driving him more insane… he hated himself for losing the will to live day, after day, after day… Steve raised his head, and looked around the place…
"Oh, well, you see, this is Pepper's!" Tony panicked as he said those words hoping that Steven will believe his excuse even if it wasn't believable at all, and it seemed that Steven didn't buy it because he narrows his eyes and gazes at Tony with that look he mastered, the one that made you feel like Steven was gazing at your soul and uncovering the darkest secret you have.
By the end of the day, Steve was so exhausted that he couldn't keep his eyes open even if he tried; Tony was still on his phone, talking with God knows who and ignoring how Steve was in danger of sleeping while he was standing up. "Maybe you should go and sleep." It was Bucky who seemed to notice that Steve was dropping off to sleep, trying to lead Steve to his bedroom before he dozed up leaning on the wall like the Omega planned.
"For you and other people out there, you may seem like you have recovered, but to us broken people on the inside, we knew that no matter how much we try we never really recover, that there will always be a scar deep down that refuses to be healed." Steve chided the Omega gently as he caressed his right cheek, wiping the tears that started falling on the Omega's face. "It's just like how you never forgave your father, just like how you refused to touch any baby you came in contact with. The only children you interact with are children older than two years, and Baby, this is not healthy, killing yourself like this." Steve pulled the Omega in his embrace when the Omega started shaking uncontrollably and Steve hated himself for making his lover cry.
"I can't… I can't…" Steve whimpered feeling Tony wiping the tears that fell from his eyes. "I can't make promises I can't keep…" Steve's breath hitches making Tony swipe his hair away from his forehead, usually, Steve kept his slightly long hair slicked back, a look he dons after the snap, but know, his hair was all over the place, making him look like a mess.
"Of course, Tony, I'm here." Steve said in a choked voice like he was about to cry too, like seeing Tony cry and clinch to him like a scared child was enough to give Steve the strength to hold it in and comfort Tony. "I'm here, I'm fine, I'm not going anywhere; you know how stubborn I am." Steve let out a wet laugh, causing Tony to sniffle like a baby and hide his face in Steve's neck, taking in his scent, letting out a shuddered breath now and then.
Matins — late at night or at midnight
"Angie! How many times I have to tell you! I eat my food! Even that extra food you send my way by Clint and Nat, which is sweet but unnecessary, you and Peggy are practically stuffing me full of food!" Tony whine which made the old woman raise an eyebrow at him, reaching over and poking Tony gently in the stomach with a frown.
Just looking at his mother glowing like this was enough to make the fear and doubts vanish from Thor's mind; the look his mother was sending him was enough to fill Thor with the strength that even Mjolnir couldn't. The door to the throne room opened and Thor unconsciously straightened himself even more if that was possible; the sight of his father, his friends, and his father's advisors was enough to give Thor the strength to stand tall and walk into the room.
"What… other i-information you have?" Tony whispered as he closed the file, his legs were wobbling that Tony feared he was going to fall any minute now.
causing Steve to give a small smile of his own before sitting on his chair while looking at his beaming son who was vibrating in his seat. "Peter…" Steve called out gently making the pup look at the Omega with a smile, and the Omega bites his lips to stop a smile that wanted to leave him at how happy his baby looked at this moment. "Mr. Stark and I… had a little talk last night, and he was wondering if you wanted to spend today with him, considering that he couldn't take you out yesterday." Steve asked the pup gently, causing the boy's eyes to sparkle, and Steve gave a small smile already knowing the answer.
"Tony? What are you doing here?" Tony didn't know who spoke those words, maybe it was Steve, the Omega didn't know, because, for one, he was shaking like a leaf. He wanted to run to Steve and hide behind him while begging silently to the Alpha to protect him from Stane, but Stane's eyes refused to turn away from him, mocking him like he was taking pleasure in the way Tony was acting around him, which made the Omega tense.
"Go away, Sir, we are doing our job." He said barking at the nurse to sedate Tony, who was crying and thrashing around, pleading with them to let him go.
"Wait, wait, wait! Don't take it on me! I am innocent!" Bucky gulp as he backed away from Steve who looked a minute away from exploding, and maybe Steve was, he was not backing down from this fight! He will at least master one dance even if he had to stay for the whole night with Bucky. "Why don't you dance with Peggy? She is better than me at this, she will teach you how to dance flawlessly I promise!" Bucky laughed nervously only to grimace when Steve ignores his words.
And then he runs… not caring about wearing only a pajama pants, he run, nor caring that he left his team but not really his team worried, he run, hoping that horrible image will vanish from his mind, he runs, begging the God to stop torturing him, he runs, hoping to feel normal by the end of his quest, he runs, not caring that it starts storming and the rain was falling on him, that it so cold that it could have been needles.
"Harley, wake up, baby!" Tony shook Harley after entering the room and locking the door behind, being thankful that Peter and Harley decided on a sleepover in Harley's room tonight of all nights; the sleepy mumble of his name caused Tony to sigh shakily, as he saw Peter finally waking up after Harley shook him. "Stay quiet and follow me…" Tony whispered, causing both the boys to be alerted, sleepiness leaving their eyes as they finally noticed how scared Tony seemed to be.
Steve didn't know what to do at that time, as he just sat on the sofa after the woman left, shaking, where would he go? Anthony was his only family, Bucky has already enlisted in the army a long time ago, and the Barnes family had moved back to Georgia after Bucky left, Steve didn't have that many friends, no one wanted to befriend a feisty, small, and sickly Omega who didn't know when to keep his mouth shut, in the end after a lot of going back and forth, Steve packed a small bag with only the necessity he needed, and he brought a small box for his stuff that he brought with him from his old home when he was still living with his mother, Steve really wanted to laugh at the irony, all of his life fit perfectly in the small box.
Grinning to himself, Steve put the letter back in the envelope, his heart pounding more wildly in his chest as he turned the key, making the engine give a loud purr as it came to life. Tony was nice enough to extend an olive branch in Steve's way, it was only the right that Steve do the same; this was Tony, after all, when the Alpha knows he did something wrong, he will desperately try to make it right.
"I know, I know, I shouldn't be doing this when I'm seven months pregnant and it's the middle of winter, so don't worry I won't, I don't think I can get on the boat tonight even if I try." Tony grins as he gazes at the lake with an exciting look shining in his eyes. "I just came here to tell you that I finally decided on a name…" Tony stated proudly, raising his hands toward his face as he warmed them with his breath, a content smile crossing his face as he gazes at the moon's reflection in the lake. "Today Bucky was going on and on about his childhood best friend who left the town with his family years ago. And one of the names that Bucky's best friend loved and repeated was 'Morgan' and gosh, it was like it clicked! I never felt connected toward a name as I felt when Bucky said that name, and I couldn't help but decided that this will be my baby's name." a shy smile take over Tony's face, and he tried to ignore the flush of embarrassment that wanted to consume him at the silly thought of him rushing home just to talk to the lake, but it was an action that Tony found comforting in the past two months, calming him when he gets worked up. "I came home straight away to tell you, wanting you to be the first to know, just two more months until Morgan is here…" A happy sigh left Tony at the thought of holding his baby in his arms, just two more months until his baby is in his arms where he will love her to death and spoil her rotten, his little Morgan. "Goodnight!" Tony called out as he turned toward his house humming happily as he opened the door and get inside.
"Hey, don't blame me, blame that fucking shooting star that dragged me with it here, by the way, is there any close loony bin so we can drop my friend at, I am sure he missed his friends." The man… Steven was going to call him a man, said while pointing at him, which made Steven glare at him hard enough that everyone seemed to shift in discomfort.
"Why don't you come with me, Pete? We can prepare the cakes and tea while Tony puts Harley in your room." Steve smiled, kissing Tony's left cheek before he guided Peter to the kitchen, giving Tony a nod as he dragged a protesting Peter so they would prepare the tea.
So what do you think?
"Oh, Tony, here you… what the hell happened?!" Pepper smiled brightly before horror took over her face as her gaze fell on Tony, taking his messy appearance, his hair that goes in all directions, the dirt, and the blood all over his suit and body. Tony could only twitch at Pepper's high-pitched voice, taking a deep breath to help calm his fried self.
The shouts of his baby as he screamed made Steve's heart pound in panic as he slashed at the man's hand that was holding the gun with his small knife, making the man snarl as blood starts trickling down his hand as he let go of the gun, which Steve ran to but the man was faster as he runs at Steve slamming into him making the Omega lose his breath, it was a few seconds before the Alpha was standing over him as he growled, trying to choke Steve when he finally was able to get a hold of the Omega's neck with his bloodied hands.
"Steve, you two don't know what you are throwing yourselves in; raising Peter is not like raising Harley." Betty tried to reason, but seeing the stubborn look on Tony and Steve's, Betty couldn't help but curse and glare at the two of them. "You are newlyweds; do you even know what that means? It means that you two have years to live before start thinking about children; if you are that desperate for a child then think about having them not adopting. Harley needs a stable home, not being adopted and then brought back into the clinic because you two couldn't handle him, this will break him." Betty stated in the last offer to stop Steve and Tony from making a mistake.
"Only for you." Tony's breath hitched as he panted and scrabbled for a decent hold on Steve's shoulders, feeling himself slipping as he was claimed by his mate over and over again. Steve moaned into the hollow of Tony's throat, and Tony felt his mate let go then, the steady precision of his thrusts dissolving into a barely restrained pace. Steve doesn't draw all the way out of Tony anymore, instead rutting, in short, quick thrusts aimed to work his cock deep, deeper, and eventually his knot.
It didn't mean that Steve and Tony never left their bed since arriving here, that would have been disgusted with the ruined sheets and the smell; no. Some days Steve and Tony liked to spent their time in the vast property of the Carbonell villa, going to swim in the pool or enjoying a walk in the gardens, sometimes even daring to venter into the grape vineyard in the back of the villa. Most of their time in this villa was magical, and both Tony and Steve promised that the next time they were going to come here, Peter was coming with them; both of them couldn't get the idea of Peter running around this place laughing out of their minds, and secretly, Tony couldn't help the thought of small pair of feet chasing the Peter around.
"Well, I think Thor's words are true, after all, Steven did explain to me that he saw me two thousand years ago and that I am a reincarnation of the Anton fella he always speaks about." Tony said as he crossed his arms, trying to stop his pout that wanted to widen, instead, he acted pettily and told them about what Steven told him a week ago, about reincarnation and the two thousand years ago meeting, which was cool when Tony think about it.
"Can I help you, Sir?" Hearing that voice behind him sounding so tired, it made Bucky turns fast, probably scaring the Omega, but Bucky couldn't help but look at the Omega in front of him taking him in, Steve had changed so much, he got more beautiful as the years passes, more beautiful and tired, the Omega tilted his head in confusion, than his eyes widen and his jaw to drop. "Bucky…?" Steve choked out which made the Alpha run toward the Omega pulling him in a tight hug, shaking all the while as he felt the Omega chanted his name and pulling him tightly sobbing on his chest. "You are alive! You made me so worried about you, you jerk!" Steve said punching him on the chest when he let go, which only made Bucky laugh a little and look at the Omega that was smiling happily at him.
"Hello boys, I hope Peter wasn't that rough Harley." Steve smiled when the two pups stopped in front of them; at Steve's question, Harley just lowered his head and shrugged, an embarrassed flush on his face, causing Steve to narrow his eyes. "Peter…" Steve said in a low voice causing the boy to laugh nervously and run to hide behind Tony.
Steve sighed as he sat up, too drained and too tired but unable to sleep, maybe a little snack would be good to take his mind off things. It hurts, Steve's heart hurt so much after he was forced to see the reality that he ignored for so long. Steve thought that Howard's hatred would shimmer down as the years passed, he thought that he managed to gain his husband's love, that Tony would always choose him if things went south, he thought that Tony's close friendship with Pepper Potts was just that… friendship… Steve should have known that this was just a desperate wish he had.
Steve felt the nervousness coming from the Omega and the Alpha, both of them avoiding looking in each other's eyes as they didn't know what to say, that made the smile on his face to slip a little and to think of something fast. "So Natasha, how is it going with you courting Clint?" Steve said which made Natasha looked at him fast with eyes widen in shock, the betrayal shining in her eyes as she heard Angie chocked out a 'What?' Peggy, on the other hand, realized what Steve was doing turned to Natasha who was avoiding Peggy and Angie, the news wasn't that shocking to Peggy as she felt like there was something going on between these two.
"Yours what?" Tony was sure he shrieked these words as he gazed at the woman with wide eyes. "You are an Addams too?" Tony was defiantly shrieking, he was so sure he was going to have a heart attack; it wasn't enough that he has one crazy Addams in his hands, the universe decided to send him another. "Oh hell to the no, no! One Addams is enough I don't need another! Shoo! Whoever you are crazy Steve's cousin whom I'm sure is the witch he talks with pride about, shoo!" Tony shooed the woman, hoping that she will leave him alone, and he was 3000% sure that the woman is that 'Wednesday' that Steve always goes on and on about, he was even sure that she cursed him with bad luck just now.
"Brat…" Steve sighed as he said that word, poking the small boy behind the ear, a gentle smile on his face. "Is that any way to talk to Tony's father?" The Alpha questioned, causing the small pup's eyes to widen, and Howard had to smile behind his teacup when the boy's wide eyes turned toward him.
"Easy for you to say that you are not the one who fell into this nastiness, Brother Steven!" Thor snapped as he tried to stand up only to slip and fall face-first into the vomit which made him scream on top of his lungs as he throws himself away from the puddle on the ground. "Curse you, Brother Clint! Curse you!" Thor's screams made Steven press his lips tightly, especially when he heard Tony snickers beside him, and Clint start laughing while groaning in pain.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry to say that, kid, but you are out of luck," Tony stated in a bored voice as he raised his finger to poke the baby's cheek, mainly to annoy the kid and cause it to cry nothing out of affection or anything. "Ouch! What the hell?" Tony squeaked when the kid held his fingers in a strong fist (Stronger than any baby that wasn't the hulk's) before biting his finger.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Papa is waiting for us downstairs, baby, so let's hurry and brush our teeth." Tony said after he washed his and Peter's face, brushing his teeth fast then turning to Peter, who was standing on a stool to reach the sink, brushing his teeth with his strawberry paste. After freshening up, Tony carried his now awaken pup, hearing the boy chattering excitedly about yesterday, which made the Omega's smile widen even more at that as he nodded his head with a serious expression on his face, causing his baby to go on and own about his want of going to the zoo once again.
"OK, enough! That's it, no one has the right to choose any movie, and not when you broke so many essential rules tonight!" Tony huffed, causing everyone to groan, whining about how unfair Tony was, which the shorter man ignore. "Steve." Tony called out, causing the confused and overwhelmed man who was sitting on the love seat to raise his head, looking like a dear caught in a headlight. "Considering that this is the first movie night you experience and the first movie night we host in months, you have the right to choose any movie you like, just keep it PG." Tony stated, glaring at everyone, daring them to say otherwise, which thankfully they didn't, they just grumbled and went back to their seats as they waited for the movie that Steve will choose.
7-Brenndu staðinn til jarðar. -Burn the place to the ground.
"Do Parks open at night?" Steve asked curiously and only then did Tony realize that Steve falls asleep every time the sun comes up. Steve practically turn into a puppet that had its strings cut when the sun touches him, something that freaked Thor (And everyone really) the first time they saw him collapse when the sunrise the first day he was with them. After that everyone made sure that Steve is in his room before the sun rose, no one wanted a repeat of that day, especially in front of Peter.
"Oh, nothing sweetie, me and your father were just playing pillow fight; he is a sower loser though." Steven let out a nervous laugh hoping that the boy will believe him, it was only a few seconds before the boy was joined with Thor and his friends, which made Steven grimace but he kept the smile on his face.
Though the year 2008, brought unwanted heartaches and pain to Steve, it all starts with the Omega returning back home from work only to see that his baby was crying, with May trying to calm him down, when he rushed to his son, he saw the news, Tony Stark was taking a hostage after the terrorist group attacked and killed the soldiers that were with him, it had made Steve shake but what made him break down and cry uncontrollably was the picture of Bucky Barnes one of the soldiers that was assigned to escort Tony Stark, had been declared dead after they found his arm. Steve had cried that day holding his son tightly, May didn't know what to do but stay with the two of them that night, Steve still couldn't believe what he heard or saw, but the truth was there… his best friend died protecting Tony Stark…
That made Steve's mouth drop a little, no; this was not his Anthony… Anthony wanted to change the world for better, he wanted to save people's lives, make it better, he wanted to invent and for his invents to use for good, like Dummy and JARVIS, this… this was not him, that was a cruel man, that was… it made Steve shiver at the laughter he heard coming from the TV, it made him turn away from the screen and change the channel… it seems that his Anthony was dead, or never exist it the first place.
A small weight slammed into Fury's legs, making the man twitch and frown, looking down with a glare at the child who dared to slam into him. When the child raised his head, Fury's breath left him when familiar blue eyes caught him, the child backed away before tilting his head, and a cheerful smile took over his face when he pointed at Fury and said. "Eye patch!" With a cheerful and unafraid tone; when Fury closed his eye he swore he was thrown back in time, 26 years ago when an annoying blond child ran between his legs just to annoy him and try to bring a smile to Fury's lips.
Just as Steve's hand touched the handle, ready to thrust the door open, he felt a hand taking hold of his right hand that was holding the bottle which made the Omega let out a shriek and whirl around ready to fight, only to hear the sound of laughter, which made him pout, especially when he realized that the person who was laughing was his husband.
"I… I hate you…" Steve whispered after a while hitting the armor with his fist ignoring the pain. "I hate you… hate you so much." Hearing Steve said that only made Tony shudder and for his tears to fall harder as the Omega repeated the words over and over again hitting his armor over and over again. "Why now? Where were you when we needed you?" Steve whispered trying to push Tony away, and when the Alpha let go of the Omega, Steve backed away looking at the Alpha with tired and cold eyes making Tony shudder.
Huffing, Steve slowly lowered himself and start picking up the clothes on the floor, at least then Bucky would be back to a semi-normal room without him feeling bad about destroying his bedroom. "Stupid Alphas, and their stupid hormones, and their destructive nature…" Steve muttered to himself as he started to fold the clothes in his arms, going to the closet and grumbling to himself about having a long conversation with Bucky about how to take care of himself and not burn the house when Steve leaves.
Opening the box with a large grin, Tony nearly let out a coo when his eyes landed on the ring; it was an elegant engagement ring with a blue sapphire in the middle, surrounded by smaller ones. “Well, aren’t you gonna but a ring on it?” Tony teased as he gazed at Steve with an eager look on his face, making a smile to flutter on Steve’s lips, a few moments later the Alpha walked toward him, standing in front of Tony gazing at his eyes before accepting the box from Tony.
So sorry for taking months before finally updating my story, but as you know, life happened, which ended with me putting this story on hiatus until I finish one or more of my ongoing fics.
"That's good; we still have three hours before we go to the clinic," Steve stated with a smile, causing Tony to bite his lip to contain the wide smile that wanted to break over his face. Just a few more hours, just a little more time and Harley would finally be home!
After that, he never forget the star, he made sure to know everything there was about astronomy, he was a fan of space and future before, but because of Howard he never had that much time in studying what he loved; but after proving over and over to him, that his star is actually a lucky one, he couldn't be happier, he decided to know everything there is about his lucky star; he knew that his lucky star was an amazing neutron star, he also knew that it was a thousand of years old, and not millions, so it always made him wonder how it was faint before it even reached its 1 million years old, because neutron stars are detected with technology before reaching 1 million years old, but his lucky star in particle was so faint that no one can see or observe it even when he hacked NASA and saw the Hubble Space Telescope ducoments and pictures he couldn't catch it from how faint it was; but Tony could perfectly see it with his naked eye and a normal telescope, hell even his son later on told him he could see it, which made him the only one after  Tony, for not one of his family other than his son told him they could see it, not even Thor.
It was a mistake… As soon as the door was closed and locked, Steve gave him a dark and smug smile, and his once lovely appearance… it melts away showing him his worst nightmares… Steve or what's left of him anyway screamed loudly, so loud that Clint thought his head was going to explode! He opened his eyes; he didn't know when he had closed…He saw a demon in front of him, smirking dangerously.
"I understood," Steve said, making Howard sniff at that and lean on the wall behind him. "I promised you, Howard, I promise you on my mother's honor, I will protect them both to my dying day." That made Howard sighs and nods his head and straightens himself.
"You think you can order me around when you have nothing to trade to save your people, who are you fooling, my queen?" The Alpha said mockingly which made the Omega grip the bars tightly, nearly throwing himself at the Alpha once again to catch the foolish king and kill him this second.
"Because he is a family, and a family protects each other; if given the chance, Nicolaus would even protect our friends." James tilted his head at those words, blinking a few times as he seemed to try and wrap his mind around Steven's logic; thankfully, his son didn't take a long time before he nodded his head, accepting Steven's orders with a happy smile.
"Why?" The pup asked once again looking at Tony with a curiosity which made Tony laugh a little at that.
"And then! And then, the music started and Mama started walking with Grandpa down the aisle, and Mama was so pretty in the white suit! Uncle Bucky had to hide though because Grandma Winnie was still angry that he didn't get married before Papa!" Peter exclaimed from inside the room, causing Steve who was outside to stop, eavesdropping was wrong Steve knows that, but he couldn't help wanting to hear what those two were talking about. "I told Mama and Papa to bring you with us, but they said they couldn't and that Aunt Betty said you were… uh, I don't remember but I was sad and didn't want to talk with Aunt Betty because of it." Steve couldn't help but snort at that explanation deciding that it was enough.
"Does he love you?" Steven asked gently which the Omega nodded his head at that and fast as if he was trying to convince Steven that Rogers was really in love with him, sadly Steven doubt that. "I talked with Peggy…" Steven ended up saying which made Tony swallow and clench his fists. "And I have to tell you, she wasn't happy, me too, Tony, not after I learned you were twenty." That made Tony bites his lower lip.
Awkward silence took over the place, and Tony swallowed, holding Peter tightly in his arms before he stood up, his mind already made up. "Come on Steve, let's get you to a room; you look like you are going to drop dead." Tony started herding Steve when he stood up, planning on giving Steve one of the rooms beside his and Peter's.
Like all good things in life, Tony should have known that everything good was going to blow up in his face, it always does that, life with him never just stopped and let him rest for a few short years, let him regroup with himself, let him truly heal. No, life just took one look at Tony before it shook its head and decided that there wasn't enough tragedy in his life, and God, it made Tony so furious, so angry, because why now of all times, why now when he was finally making process and getting better, just why?
And Steve, Steve couldn't handle the madness he lived in the middle of, he couldn't handle seeing Peggy and Howard become ghosts of their past selves, he couldn't handle seeing Howard's Omega mate, swallow another anti-depressed med, he couldn't handle Angie always excusing him of being the reason that
The sound of the AI made everyone blink at that and when it clicked everyone looked at Tony who was turning redder by the second. "So, 'J.A.R.V.I.S', huh?" Peggy asked as she leans on the table with an amused look on her face, she could see the human Jarvis was trying hard to stop himself from snickering at the young master; Anna was going to have an amusing day hearing about this.
"Of course, come in!" The man offered with a gentle smile, opening the door for Sarah, causing the woman's breath to stutter at the thought of going inside the house after all these years that passed, it was only the gentle understanding look the young man offered her selflessly made Sarah brave enough to take the first step inside the house, followed by another, and another, until she was inside, her eyes were wide at the changes she was seeing. "My name is Tony Rogers, Ma'am." Hearing that name, caused Sarah to take a shocked breath and turn to the young man who led her to the kitchen, where there was a kettle on the stove. "I must say I have been excited to meet the person my husband always talks about." Tony, smiled as he went to prepare tea, causing Sarah to tilt her head, her eyes tearing up as she finally placed where she saw the young man before.
The AI's clipped voice made everyone flinch as they looked at Bucky who stepped inside the lab once the door opened, stepping inside, the door was closed behind him fast which made Bucky feel a little bit of claustrophobic, but the Alpha marched on hoping to see Stark. When he saw the other Alpha, Bucky was divided between feeling pity for the man with bloodshot eyes that was sitting on the floor in his rumpled suit or anger for what Howard did to Steve and his pup and to an extend Tony.
"You always love your acronyms," Steve said looking at his husband, who was looking at Steve with a concentrate look like he was trying to print Steve's face into his memory.
Steve called them after they finished lunch to ask about Peter, which the young pup took as a chance to chatter the Alpha's ear off about what he and Tony did in the lab, going about how he helped Tony with the engine, and that Mr. Stark wanted to talk with the Alpha about teaching Peter a little bit of engineering (The small pup begged him to give him lessons until the Omega accepts) it ended up with Tony talking with the Alpha about today's event, smiling a little when the Alpha promise to come for Peter at six PM… Tony wondered secretly if this is what it would have been like if he was mated and his baby survived, it end up with a sad smile as the Omega shook his head trying to banish these thoughts out of his head.
"Alright calm the fuck down!" Steven snapped as he helped Peggy and Tony up, the Alpha was the first to recover so she stood gracefully like she wasn't just thrown in a wormhole and thrown into another world nothing and she looked at Thor who was hissing and shrieking every time he tried to stand up and end up slipping, Tony, on the other hand, was shaking a little, but he didn't make any fuss just leaned on Steven to regain his barriers which made Steven's heart skip a beat.
"T-thanks…" Muttered the Omega as he took the baggage with his left hand, his right hand was holding the envelope toward his chest tightly, Tony rushed away after that never looking back at the Beta who was looking at the Omega with a sad look.
The sound of the door opening and closing made Steve look up hopefully, only to let out a sigh when he saw that it was only James, but the Omega smiled as he looked at the man who frozen in the doorway after he spotted Steve. "Do you want dinner? I am sure I can reheat it…" Steve said with a gentle smile, looking at the table trying to hide his grimace at how much food there was, he really wanted to check on the Alpha and make sure he was OK after what took a place this morning, but knows that the man won't appreciate it, just like he knows that deep down James will just retreat into his room, leaving Steve alone, which made Steve's smile slip for a second.
“Nah, he is still grumpy that he had to wake up at 4 a.m. to investigate the disturbance that took place last night, you just missed his speech in the town hall, when he warned every teenager with spending the next three months in a cell if they don’t confess.” Natasha shook her head, delight twinkling in her eyes, causing Tony’s lips to twitch up.
"Of course! Who else would I give the roses for other than my best guy?" Steve teased gently making Tony chuckle happily at that, Steve gave a happy smile as he saw Tony looking at the roses. One of the most heartbreaking things Steve learned in his life, what broke him on the inside, was when his love was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2045 it had been a rough five years for both of them, it was like Peggy all over again. Sometimes Tony would remember him and would be even happy to see him, the two of them will spend that day sitting in their room or taking a stroll in the gardens, talking about the past, what they were going to do next, or just whispers love confessions over and over again. Sometimes Tony would wake up thinking that he was still married to Pepper, he will ask about Morgan and why his daughter and wife weren't there with him, on these days Steve didn't know what to say, he will just take Tony to the gardens, how does he tell the love of his life that his daughter was 33 years old woman with a husband and two children and that his wife was still out there managing SI, locking Tony out of his company because of her want for revenge because she thinks Tony was the reason Happy was dead? Sometimes things were worse, the times when Tony woke up thinking that Thanos was out there and that they were about to do the Time Heist, he will beg Steve to come with him, to help him and the team, Steve always says they are handling it. But what broke Steve was when Tony will wake up remembering the Civil War, he would scream and scream when he sees Steve near him, because he will always remember Steve thrusting his Shield into the Arc-Reactor… Steve never regrets anything in his life as much as he regrets the pain he caused Tony.
"How dare you say I will do of such a sinister act?" Thor snarled, only to decide to calm himself when Steven throws him an alarming glance, requesting of him to quit this right now. "To answer your questions…" Thor sends a deadly glare at Clint who frets at being exposed to such an expression from a friend. "Stars are the grandest and the most powerful being in the universe, no one can match or dream of acquiring magic like theirs, they are also the realms keepers who recorded the history since the dawn of time, every act performed since the dawn of the universe are recorded in their archives. Because of their divine magic, evil forces tried everything in their capacity to gain their powers, but it is futile to best the stars when they are in their true form or their astral forms. Because of that, a number of spells, curses, and enchantments were created to bound the stars in frail bodies, like Midgardian, to be able to best them. Out of all the spells only one worked, and it bounded the star in a body that suppressed their magic and capabilities, that way, the caster of the spell can overpower the stars, with that, it's simply the matter of ripping the heart and consuming it. My father made certain to wipe out every spell or enchantment that work in an identical way, not only stars' magic should remain as theirs, but those who dare to obtain it in such a loathsome way shall be burdened with madness for the rest of their long life, the last star that fell was six thousand years ago, and ever since then Asgard took it as our duty to protect the Ancient one from such a destiny, I dread how the Witch of Scarlet got her hand on an enchantment that bound the Ancient One in this body, I am certain that my mother and father were already warned by Heimdall, it's merely the matter of time before they discover a means to Midgard." Thor gives an encouraging smile to Steven, overlooking how wide everyone's eyes were at the knowledge they obtained, Mrs. Carter though had a decided expression on her face, as if she was bracing to go in a battle for him which made Steven feel a little sad for her.
The gentle hand that ran along his back as they rise toward his head and removed the pillow, the different scent that wasn't his mother but meant a family, all the same, the soft and calm voice that shushed him as it crooned to him, made Peter let out a whine at that, turning to see the Alpha that he has been waiting for the whole night, sitting on the edge of his bed, looking at the pup with a tired smile. "… You didn't come…" Peter's voice cracked as he said those words, causing the Alpha to give a sad smile, his eyes were glassy.
This amazing Moodboard was made by the amazing!
Something I am surprised by, to be honest.
"Was that Peter?" Steve asked as came to the living room with slow steps, the grocery bags in his arms as he made his way slowly to Tony, who took half of the bags in Steve's hands, getting a kiss on the cheek as a thank you. Steve always had the bad habit of bringing all of the grocery bags in one trip, which was the main reason why Tony needed to be careful or the bags would end on the floor.
"Are you ok, sir?" A small accented voice asked him, it made Tony raise his head to look at the person who spoke, a pup with a dark brown hair, brown eyes, and pale skin, Tony wondered if he was losing his mind as he let out another sob and curl on himself, trying to will his mind to stop this nightmare.
Be assured though, that this is not the end of this story. I still need to write the story in Steve's POV and let's not forget that the prologue is still in the process of being written… so two more chapters to go! But if you like, this is the official ending for the story, so you can stop here.
Tony would have asked Peggy and Bucky to tell him the truth; if only they would have told him the truth. Hell, Tony probably would have even helped them hide the monster in the lake and keep it a secret if their goal from the start was to protect the monster from outsiders and nothing else. Tony wouldn't have minded having a strange neighbor who lives deep in the lake if it meant that Tony or his daughter will never get hurt. Tony wouldn't have minded keeping the secrets that this town kept if it meant his daughter would have a happy life; Tony wouldn't mind the ghost in his house living with his family if he didn't hurt Morgan. Unfortunately, though, no one in the town seemed to trust him enough to tell him the truth, and that was their mistake because when it comes to the safety of his daughter, no one is to stand in front of Tony Stark or they will pay dearly.
"We are here…" Tony said which made the Omega hum at that and look at the hospital in front of him, sighing as he unclasps his seatbelt and gets out of the car, opening the backseat for his pup and smiling when the pup's sparkling eyes fell on him, the three of them walked toward the receptionist where the woman looked at them, smiling happily when Tony asked about Anna's whereabouts, dragging Peter and Steve with him when they were done.
"Shhh… It is alright, little Omega, I am here." Steve said softly he held him gently and drove into him even more, making Tony whine and whimper unable to control the volume of his voice; the only thing he was thankful for was that Peter was not here and that Howard accepted babysitting their son with a happy smile. Tony couldn't help but let out a sudden gasp as his back arched when his mate brushed his prostate one last time making him released without a warning. Tony couldn't help but give a whimper of desire as he spurred his Alpha to press the knot inside; Tony made a squawking noise as his Alpha finally answered his demands and knot him. Steve could only grunt as he cum, holding Tony tightly to his chest. Tony could only cling tightly to his Alpha with a choked whimper as a second release was ripped off him.
It's the end! Finally! I never thought we will reach it!
Steve grips Tony's hips tight enough to bruise and worked himself back up to a steady pace, until he's fucking into Tony with thrusts that rock Tony back into their bed of pillows, eliciting a lewd, wet sound each time his hips slap into the back of Tony's thighs. Tony feels himself clench again as his body produced another gush of slick, trickling out of his stretched rim while Steve's pulling out. "Oh, fuck…" Tony breathes, sounding as ruined as he was feeling.
Tony laughed uncomfortably. "Well, I've never been in this situation before..." The Omega swallowed as he visibly tried to keep himself together; Steve's heart skipped a beat worrying that Tony and him were rushing things. But the only thing that Tony did was drew his hands out of his pockets and looked Steve straight in the eyes. "I want you to be my Alpha if you will have me." Those words were said with such determined and sureness.
"Enough! Enough of your lies, enough! If he was really dead I would have felt it! I know he was alive out there, all these years..." Sobbed Tony too tired and drained after what he heard, he wobbles to the door. "God, you are no better than Stane, and to think I trusted you…" Tony sobbed looking at his father for the last time, ignoring the tears in his father's eye. "Goodbye… Howard." Tony said with a hard voice wiping his tears away and wore his sunglasses ignoring his father's weak calls as he runs out of the hospital.
"P-Peter…" Steve breathed in disbelief, taking a step toward the boy only for the said boy to flinch and back away from him. At that, tears that Steve had tried desperately to hold in since this madness started slid down his face, though Steve only allowed a few tears before he reigned them back in, ignoring the shaky breath that Tony let out.
At least Tony hoped the town's people didn't do something stupid like selling his house, not when he was sure he left a letter to Peggy telling her about him returning back when the time right. And the time was finally right for him to return to his home.
"Not at all, Steve, the boy was an angel as usual, so who is your friend?" The Beta asked looking at Bucky with narrow eyes making the Alpha shiver a little at the suspicious look he was at the end of, but the woman gains his respect for being protective of Steve, God knows what the punk would have thrown himself into if she wasn't there.
"Do you like it, Mr. Stark? I told Papa to buy them because you said you love chocolate!" Peter peeped which made Tony laugh a little at that and take the chocolate from Steve's hands with a small smile taking over his lips, a flush decorated his face prettily.
Tired… the only thing Steve could feel was the tiredness that burdens on pain coursing through his body; slowly, too slow for Steve's liking, the Omega managed to open his eyes, blinking the few times against the blurriness. When his sight finally cleared, Steve let out a confused noise when he saw the white ceiling greeting him; the annoying beeping beside him informed Steve that his suspicion was true and that in fact, he was in a hospital. Part of Steve wondered if Tony had found him and stopped Bucky from taking him away; another part wondered if Bucky was around here somewhere and this place was a cell he was in.
Tony nearly let out a sigh of relief as he crossed the hallway to his room, only to let out a huff when his body hit a solid object that wasn't in his path a few Nano-seconds ago. Raising his head Tony's eyes widen when he saw Steve grinning happily with blood covering him from head to toe…
A pained smile took over Steve's face and he seemed lost in thoughts like he was trying to remember a sad memory, and the Omega turned to her with a sad smile. "I was sick… after what Howard did… I fell sick, and I didn't know the reason, one day my neighbor ended up calling the ambulance because apparently I caused enough rackets that she thought I was under attack when I passed out… I met him at the hospital, he was the one who informed me that I was pregnant with my son… he was kind, and always tried to cheer me up when he saw I didn't have anyone to come to visit me back then, I only knew him for two weeks before I was discharged… I guess somehow he knew I was alone with no one to take care of me or the baby… that's why after my baby was born, his lawyer came to my house, informing me that Dr. Erskine had given me this house in his will." Steve explained which made the woman give a tired chuckle… that was Erskine alright.
So what do you think?
Tony hummed as he went through his list once more only to see that he had finished the list, which meant he can either go to the register… or it will give him free rein to buy what he wants! It's not like he doesn't have the money for it, and Tony admits that the only reason for him to have the list is because of Steve; usually, when Tony goes shopping by himself he will throw everything that he fancies in his car without a second thought about it being healthy or not. But ever since Peter and Steve start living with him, his life took a turn to the healthy road, to both Pepper and Rhodey's disbelieve who made fun of him for that; it doesn't mean that Tony's house stopped being the candy wonderland it is!
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, so much sadness, violence! All reviews are appreciated.
Tony's eyes should stay on the future, they should stay on Steve, the loving and caring Alpha who always stood by his side even when he didn't need to stay with a broken and useless Omega who always runs and leaves him at the mention of a dead pup. His eyes should stay on Peter, the sweet child who always looked up to him, holding into Tony tightly and not letting go, because for the small pup Tony is the only family he needed besides his father and grandmother.
It took only a few seconds before Steve remembered where he had seen that raccoon before, and when he did all the tension left his body and his lips twitched down. "Cool! Steve, look! A talking raccoon! Can I keep it?" Peter asked, his eyes sparkling as they fell on the raccoon holding a gun, ignoring the fact that they were the target of the raccoon with the gun… kids.
Reaching the Stark's mansion was like a dream came true to Tony as he got out of the car. It was hours later that he was able to gain the courage and go to Steve to talk with him; the Alpha was in the gym pummeling a punching bag to death. Tony watched the Alpha from afar, jumping when the chain broke and the bag sailed toward the wall hitting it hard. "Tony?" Steve gives a questioning sound as he unwrapped his bandaged hands, and Tony had to contain his jealousy about how the Alpha didn't break into a sweat.
"I am sorry, sweetheart." Steve sighed as he came and held Tony tightly, scenting the Omega and causing him to purr. "But Fury is hounding to come tonight and finish the next chapter of Iron Man, he promised me the week off if I finish it tonight, so I might be late." Steve huffed, which gained an amused smile from Tony who accepted the fact that his husband no doubt agreed to finish the chapter of the comic tonight for the promise of a week off; a week he needed after Peggy throw a dark threat to both of them.
Finally some fluff!
Jamti though just rolled his eyes at Anton, letting out a sigh at the way his friend was acting like. It wasn't that Jamti didn't share the same sentiment as Anton; he knew what it would mean if their guests didn't show up, or worse show up. "Anton…" Jamti finally spoke clearing his throat when his friend turns his gaze from the metal he was forging toward him, making Jamti feel a little bit uncomfortable, especially with the news that Jamti was going to speak. "Anton… as much as I hate to say this, but the elders decided that this year will be your last." Jamti stated, trying not to wince at the dark look that took over Anton's face; it was promising death.
"I wish I could, but you know, I have honey bear's birthday, and not forget preparing for the… you know…" Tony pout when he saw Steve's grin widen even more at the bashful look Tony was sporting, the Omega didn't have it in himself to scold the Alpha, he is just so happy about today that Tony decided to let it slide this time, but it doesn't mean that Steve won't pay for it the next time, with kisses and foot-massage that is.
"My king, what irks you on this fine morning? You seem really mad about something; I can be of help if you want." Tyber, finally noticing that Jamti and Anton stopped talking, came between them, causing Anton and Jamti to let out a grumble and move their horses away from the Beta.
… Steve had whispered one day. Realizing who he was talking to, made Tony relax, his fear was replaced by the feeling of being safe... this was Steve's mother, Tony was safe.
"He is alive…" She sobbed, and lean on Howard, Howard who was frozen, who was looking at the phone like he saw a ghost, Howard who had tears running down his face without him noticing… "Tony is alive…" She repeats once more…
It was a couple of eventful months; Tony could admit that. Between him and Steve going over their wedding plans, preparing for their month-long vacation, taking care of Peter, and mending their broken relationships with family and absent friends, and doing their jobs; there wasn't that much free time in their schedule. Tony will admit that it was stressful and he felt tired half of the time, but Tony won't replace any minute of it no matter what, especially when things were finally looking up.
"Mr. Stark!" The voice that hunted Tony since earlier this year squeal happily and Tony turns to look at the small pup, who stopped in front of him gasping, and Tony had to stop himself from pulling the pup in his arms and never letting go because his baby looked tired and pale. "You are alive! I thought you got hurt after the aliens attack, I was so worried-" Peter was cut from his ramble by Tony finally kneeling and pulling the pup in his arms, holding the pup tightly and nuzzling his cheek, which made the pup purr a little and sniffs Tony's neck, relaxing at the scent of family.
Steven knew when they reached the shore, after all, the energy was buzzing inside of the ship, everyone was in high spirit, even the guard, the only one who has a grim look on their faces were the Hydra servants, especially because reaching the shore meant that they will possibly lose their Queen, especially with the Iron King being involved, something that no one wanted to think about, someone that everyone fear will use and hurt their queen like Johann did, which was in the realm of possibility considering the northerners' reputation, that left nothing to be desired.
It was strange; so strange that Tony acted this spontaneously with Steve after everything happened between them. It was true that Steve had warmed up to him, just like he had warmed up to Peggy, Bucky, and Peter, but it was never to this extent, even if someone was to call them friends, they weren't close enough to be in this level of closeness yet, but still, Tony didn't care, he thinks it was time that he can finally take the title of Steve's best friend without fear of Steve flipping out on him like he used to before they had that heart to heart months ago.
His dark blue eyes were glowing with an unearthly glow, freezing everyone who was foolish enough to look at them. His body was full of scars and slashes, informing Tony of heavy beating and murder attempts, the bullets that Tony saw decorating Rogers's torso did nothing but confirm it. Last but not least… there was something dancing behind Rogers, it was too transparent to give Tony any visual, but gazing too long at it made terror crawl inside Tony, urging him to run and run.
"Yeah, I do." Rhodey said then took a step forward. "Why?" Rhodey asked as he saw the hope and sadness in Maria's eyes, Peggy was looking at him like a hawk as she walked around her office.
"If you say so…" Tony mumbled, returning to the stew, ignoring how his father starts humming happily like he was pleased with himself, and he should be, he managed to calm Tony down from burning the food. "Well, the stew is nearly done…" Tony hummed only to freeze when he heard the front door opening informing Tony that Steve was back with Harley.
Antonette husband was a monster, and this was a light word coming from his mouth, the man deserves to rot in Helheim for all eternity for what he did to his beloved, he hurt her so much, used her so much, made her cry, humiliated her, locked her up in a tower, like she was a prisoner, and she was a prisoner in her own house, she spent her days trying to act like the perfect wife, as for her nights, Antonette will always look at the sky from her window in her room when her husband force himself upon her and left her alone, she will always look at the stars and her eyes will fall on him with a sad smile. "When can I finally be with you, darling?" She would ask and he will close his eyes at that wondering when her words will be true.
"'m fine…" Harley swallowed, his lips trembling like he was a second away from crying, an action that pulled at Tony's heartstrings, making him steel himself and not do something rash like pulling the kid in his embrace and not letting go. It was a few seconds later that Harley raised his head to glare at Tony, as if daring him to do something or say something, Harley's jaw was sit in the same stubborn scowl that Steve had, which made Tony's lips twitched up… Steve and Harley did have a special bond, which made Tony wonder if Harley had come to Steve but couldn't find him; maybe he did, the boy certainly didn't seem to know that Steve and Tony had married last month or he wouldn't have called Tony by his maiden name.
"And I will! You just wait!" Harley called out, walking inside the kitchen and toweling his hair, having finally finished his shower, and getting rid of all the cream that covered his face, hair, and body. "I already told Steve, and he said you are so grounded for three weeks!" Harley huffed, glaring at Peter who squeaked from his seat near the dining table and turned his wide eyes at Tony, pleading with him to save him.
"I will say this one last time, Dad, so please listen well. I am not wasting my life, I am finally happy, can't you see that? Can't you see that the only reason I wanted to be recognized was so that you will finally look at me so that you will finally notice me? Can't you see that I am finally letting the company go to care for my baby? Away from the war, and killing, and bombs, and guns can't you see?" Tony questioned, making Howard look at his son with a strange look.
Maria and Steve then spent the time leading Tony to the clinic, once they were inside Tony sighed to himself and looked at Peter who was clutching his shirt tightly, making Tony give a sad smile and kiss his forehead. He never wanted his son to see this, to be forced to give his privacy because some idiot reporters/paparazzi couldn't respect others' privacy and life. The sound of the camera and the flash made Tony freeze and look up to see a reporter looking at Tony and his son with dropped jaw, it made Tony's heart drop in his stomach when he saw the reporter raise the camera to get a better picture of Peter who was whimpering and hiding his face in Tony's chest.
"But you didn't deny that he is hot~" She sing-song at that, which got her a glare from Tony causing her to laugh happily at that. "Tell me is he single? If he is, then why aren't you taping that? I know I would like to ride him." Darcy said with a whistle which got a growl from Tony, the thought of this fellow Omega stealing the Alpha and the pup but him on edge! The smirk on Darcy's face made him realize what he just did and his glare increased.
"Silly old man… it's enough for me if you loved me for the rest of my life." Tony said looking at his wrinkly hand that was held gentle between Steve's bigger ones, that made Steve look up at Tony's sad, so sad, and understanding eyes. It made Steve let out a small 'Oh' and tears start gathering in his eyes… how did he forget, how did he forget that his love was dying, that any day now the Arc-Reactor would give up, or worse, Tony's body will give up, how did he forget that he would lose his love any day now, how did he forget that…
"Well, Mr. Rogers it seems that the child has imprinted on you, which I considered strange, coming from the environment he was in…" The doctor said, making silence fall on the group.
"…A chance…" Tony finally said as he looked at the Omega with a pleading look hoping that the younger man will understand... that he wouldn't leave him alone in here and leave this place angry at Tony. "To make new memories… happy ones…" Tony left it at that because he can't say anything anymore, he knows that if he opened his mouth now he will probably chock on his breath.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness, a little bit of violence, sad Steve! And we will meet surprising characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
The phone's ringing made Steve look at the screen and smile after seeing that it was Cassie. "Hey, Cassie… Cassie! calm down, what's going on?" Steve called out trying to make the woman that was crying hysterically on the other line calm down. What Steve heard made his heart stop, he didn't realize that everything he bought was now lying on the floor, that he let it go from the shock, it was a few seconds later that Steve starts running in top speed, hoping to reach the hospital before it's too late…
? They don't serve it unless you ask them at the bar." Tony asked letting the French roll from him in a purr, looking at Steve from his eyelashes, hoping that the man will fall for it and will leave him for a few precious minutes to gather his bearers.
It was a while before the walls of the Hydra's palace melted down, and in its place, there were the walls of the Iron King's house; the changes were so sudden that Steven nearly fainted, his mind refusing to be of use anymore. "James… where is my James?" Steven's ordered (Plea) when the person holding him melted from Johann's shadow to show him the Iron King, gazing at him with wide eyes.
"You know damn well Sir, that taking pictures in this clinic if forbidden and that you will get sue, and this is not the first time I saw you here." Steve snapped at the man, looking through the films and frowning all the while at the kind of photos he saw. "Take him to the police station, and search him well, confiscate all of his possessions, and burn this damn film!" Steve ordered as he gave the film to the female agent when she nodded her head, everyone wince as the Beta reporter was dragged away cursing and threating that he will sue them, which only caused Steve to roll his eyes at that and nod his head to the nurses which made them return back to their work.
"And you are nothing if not a foolish Omega but we covered that the first time we met, have we not?" The Alpha asked getting a snort from the Omega who took his lose long blond hair and start braiding it, making the Alpha pause and look at the Omega who was busy looking at the fire while trying to fix his hair… "You and your brat can go and see your people, some of my men will escort you to their house… and cut your hair, you are not a guest." The Alpha said as he stood up, putting the cup near the Omega, getting an eye roll at his words, any master would have backhanded the Omega for such a public disrespect, but for Starkad he just let out an annoying noise and walked away, only to stop at the Omega's next words.
Today Tony agreed that he was going to talk with Mrs. Rogers; Tony know that no matter what it looked like, Mrs. Rogers will be the first one to oppose his marriage with Steve, something that even now, the Omega didn’t know the reason for, and it hurt him, how Mrs. Rogers, the woman that once told Tony to call her ‘Sarah’ became cold to him, just because he was dating her son now.
Tony would have liked to say that nothing between him and Steve had changed after the proposal, but in truth everything has; things that he used to do with Steve before that were normal to him caused him to flush, even if they were silly, kisses stole his breath, every kiss was like the first time they did it, leaving Tony breathless and wanting, and the most important for Tony was, being engaged to Steve cemented his relationship with Peter as a potential parent, though both Steve and Tony agreed to wait a little longer before telling Peter about the engagement, which was actually Tony’s idea, for he wanted to be sure that him and Steve will work 300% before breaking the news to Peter.
And he could only gaze at Midgard with amazement in his eyes; the realm was beautiful… its forests, rivers, mountains, people, the things they created, and he strained his ears to hear about some of their knowledge, it was breathtaking and he couldn't stop gazing at it, it was then that he saw him! The most beautiful being his eyes ever fell on.
"Do not worry, love, we shall enjoy every scream of pain tonight, we shall bath in our enemy's blood as we rip his heart out!" Steve grinned, being too cheerful for someone who was going to be Satan and torture some poor souls on this fine evening. Tony couldn't help but pity Stane, even with the man being a dick, no one deserves to be a target of the Addams family.
"To teach that foolish Omega a lesson…" Starkad hissed which made the man furrow his brows, already planning on asking Nattalegg or Klint about what took a place, feeling that Starkad was too worked up to tell him the real story of why he decided to take slaves or in this case
It seems that Steve not answering made the hopeful smile on the boy's face fell, but the doorbell ringing made the boy run to open the door, leaving Steve to regain his barriers, he stood up from his place and went to the door when he heard Peter squealing happily when he saw his friends and their parents in the doorway, Steve just past a smile on his face and went to greet the guests, hoping that nothing wrong was showing on his face.
"I didn't lie to you…" Tony said in a small voice that got him a snort from the Omega, it made Tony swallow and took a step back before he got his barrier together. "I never lied to you, everything I said was true, the only thing I changed was my name, I just wanted to be normal for once, gaining your love because I deserve it, not because I was a rich fucker, I just wanted you to see me for me!" Tony ends up shouting, which made Steve stop at that and turn to Tony.
It was two years since Tony was back, his heart breaking to millions of pieces as he took in his tired mother, who looked more worn out and stressed as the days passed. His mother looked like she went through hell, but at least she got out of it with strength that she didn't possess back then, with confidence in her steps that Tony never saw before. Tony could only cry as he had held his mother, letting her comfort him as he told her what happened ever since he left home, he told her about the strange town, and its strange people, and the strange monster in the lake that saved and protected Tony and Morgan many, many times over the past two years since Tony was away.
"If you want, we can tell them after dinner time, knowing both of them won't eat that well if we tell them the news before dinner," Steve mumbled, leaning down to kiss the top of Tony's head, which made Tony purr happily and snuggle into his mate.
"Darling, a piece of advice, stop overthinking everything and let's give them some privacy." Winnie said already knowing the trail of thoughts Sarah was heading to, and the Alpha didn't really blame her friend, but if she babied her son and grandson like this she will suffocate the two of them without giving them the chance to recover, so Winnie pulled her friend away from the tree heading to the house, smiling all the while when Tony smiled and laughed with the Alpha and his pup when was the last time she saw Tony this happy? The only time she could remember was his pregnancy, when he glows and was so happy…
(See the end of the chapter for
The rest of the Avengers were all sitting in different places, bickering about whose turn it was to choose the movie, so far the fight was a tie between Bucky and Peggy, the later wanted to watch a romantic movie, while as usually Bucky was all about action, explosions, and guns, the rest of the Avengers were cheering them on causing Tony to groan at how uncaring his friends and family were, letting Tony and poor Peter handling all the food relating issues.
Steve stayed quiet for a little time before letting out a small laugh. "Do you know how to kill someone without killing them?" Steve asked Fury, getting a confused look from the young man, it made Steve give a sad smile. "You drive them crazy…" Steve said making Fury pause at that before he was able to question the Alpha what he meant the door opened showing Stane being dragged by some of Shield agents. Fury shut his mouth, feeling that he already got his answer, an answer that he didn't know and sure as hell wouldn't like.
Wanda screamed in rage as she runs at him, trying to tackle him into the ground and beat him for what he did; fortunately for Steve, she didn't manage to reach him, especially when Tony raised one of his repulsors and fired, hitting the witch and slamming her into the floor which rends the witch unconscious. "Steve…" Tony's relieved look turned into one of horror, and when Steve turned behind him to see why he could only stumble back when he saw Nebula standing behind him, the guardians were unconscious but Gamora was the worse of them because of her broken legs and broken right arm.
They eat their breakfast while making small conversation, talking about this and that, and Peter was the most energetic, talking about what they should do this summer vacation considering that schools will be over in two weeks. Peter though was hopping in his own seat, trying to convince Tony and Steve to bring one of his friends in the clinic with them, a boy that Peter befriended half a year when he arrived at the orphanage in the clinic.
It was a few minutes before the words made sense to Steve's sleepy mind, and when they did, Steve let out a sigh and sat up. "I'm awake aren't I?" Steve answered, a little grumbly, mixed with a little tiredness, and a lot of sleepiness, causing everyone to feel a little guilty for keeping Steve awake when he needs the sleep. "I was never really asleep when the Stone was in control; my body may be, but I was wide awake, and I finally broke the stone's hold, which means I'm as free as I can be from its hold on my consciousness." Hitched breathes were heard as the realization of what Steve informed them made sense… Steve was awake this whole time, just not with his body.
If someone told Tony that he will fight aliens by the end of 2010, he would have laughed his asses off and walked away from them, but if someone told him that he will end up fighting aliens with a team made of the brother of that specific alien that wanted to rule them, a giant green rage monster, two superspies, and Bucky Barnes who became a Shield agent, under the leadership of Peggy Carter AKA Captain America, Tony would have given that person the number of his shrink and pat him on the back walking away while instructing JARVIS to put him on the blacklist.
