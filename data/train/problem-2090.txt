John sighed, and put aside the letter. He started to tick off on his fingers. “You could clean under the sink where those gelatinous compounds leaked, you could scrub the beakers where you were storing spider venom, you could sort the fingernails into an actual useable collection or you could try the diversions of us ordinary mortals and read a book or watch telly. ” Sherlock gave him a scathing look.
John nodded to himself and kept on. “The last time we were at your parents’, do you remember, you were so irritated when your mum brought out the photo albums. You know what I remember about them? How many of them were of Mycroft with you in his arms when you were a baby or his arm around you as a kid, or standing next to you when you got older. Looking as proud of you as if you’d already won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. My guess is you were never easy, but he was always there, wasn’t he? Yeah. He doesn’t know when to back off and he meddles when he shouldn’t, probably,” (Sherlock snorted), “but I imagine it’s a hard habit to break, trying to watch out for his baby brother, especially since you haven’t gotten any better at watching out for yourself. It certainly would be easier for him to leave you to your own self-destructive ways wouldn’t it? Especially in his position. He could just wash his hands of you. It would certainly be easy for him to disavow all responsibility for you, wouldn’t it?”
As you no doubt already know, I have been ordered to write you a letter of apology. It has proven to be quite difficult as you can imagine.
When he caught his breath, he said, “What do you want?” John cleared his throat and said, “It’s your show, Sherlock. Tell me what to do” After a grounding, the arrangement specified that Sherlock could dictate the terms of the reconciliation sex. He was the one who had suffered most through the drought. It was a tease, being bare-arsed over John’s lap, struggling to avoid arousal, at least at the beginning of the spanking. Sherlock was strictly hands-off; John had still had the shower, after all. And it was a relief for him to let Sherlock take charge after days of emotionally draining decision-making. It was a balancing act; trying to help Sherlock understand the facts of the punishment, to help him accept it, learn from it and to keep him stable. Caring for him afterward. The physical aspects were taxing as well. He was ready for a break and willing to follow Sherlock’s lead.
Sherlock made to pull his hand away, but John wouldn’t let him. “Ugh,” he said in revulsion, “Why do I need to tell you if you already know? It serves no purpose, John!”
After a few minutes on the heavy bag, Sherlock beckoned John over to the locker room. As they went through the heavy grey door, John felt like he had entered one of the shaky, amateur, gay porn videos he had been forced, totally against his will of course, to watch at uni. The locker room was as barebones as the rest of the building, harshly lit, grey, bare, and steamy. Standard layout, with 5 showerheads on one side, a sink and some toilet stalls, a wall of lockers and benches, two massage tables, and some cabinets holding towels on the other. One man was finishing up in the shower. John could tell this because the showers were open, as in without stalls or curtains, meaning that anyone taking a shower, and was naked, which Sherlock was about to be, was completely visible to anyone else in the room, including his Sherlock. Whose arse was about to be visible. And his other bits. Naked.
John whispered, “I’m going to make sure you don’t forget that I’m right there with you, wherever you are,” and he sucked hard on Sherlock’s skin, “You’ll have marks all over you, to remind you while we’re apart.” He moved his mouth lower and bit down just hard enough to leave a bruise. He sucked and scraped with his teeth. Sherlock writhed underneath him, moaning, “Yes, yes, I want to remember, I need to remember. Harder, more. Put it in the mind palace.”
“And never a thought to helping with Ma when she got battered, then sick. Not coming home for the funeral. She didn’t even show up for what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. She couldn’t even get herself together enough to come to my wedding.”
When John asked him why he was being punished, his responses had been “I was bad,” or “Because you’re angry.” John had to teach him that the answer was, “I misbehaved,” or “I broke the rules.” He would then have to lead him step by step through his actions, helping him to fill in the gaps where his rational brain missed the emotional stepping-stones between action and consequence. It had taken a very long time, and Sherlock hated it. He still wasn’t very good at it. They’d barely started the work of recognizing the impact on others. This answer was something radically new: a detour, straight to the fallout, the effect of his behavior on another person. Specifically, in this particular instance, the one about to spank his arse. Sherlock had just taken a quantum leap and John wasn’t sure how to proceed.
Sherock groaned and stretched and then clutched John fiercely to him. He rolled them over so that he was now on top. He said, “I can’t break away from these chains, John. They’re yours.I don’t want to break them. Bad habit for me to get into.” And he kissed him.
I did not anticipate that yours would be the hardest letter to write. Upon my initial consideration, I planned to overwhelm you with sweet sentiment, knowing how susceptible you are to such manipulation. But, damn you, the discipline of forcing my thoughts onto paper has deprived me of my exceptional gift for dissembling. It is second-nature for me to deceive in the moment, sometimes, even without intending to. You know this of course, and though you have had some little success in reforming these tendencies in me, I find that in the quiet reflection of writing you a letter, I cannot be other than honest and, to my disgust, sincere.
John smiled and turned away to put his jacket on. The wet spots triggered another wince. “This is disgusting.”
John lifted Sherlock’s wrist a little higher and he twisted, trying to keep the pressure off his shoulder.
B. I regret the distractions caused by my less than adequate regard for my own physical safety and well-being.
II. I would recommend that you convey your gratitude to my spouse for the following realizations on my part:
“This is only for us. You sign and I will present to the court my guarantee that the matter will be concluded in a manner agreeable to all. Your compliance with the contract will satisfy all parties.” Sherlock looked questioningly at him, but John only said, “You’re going to have to trust me on that. That’s my responsibility.” He waited until Sherlock’s eyes dropped and head nodded.
John looked positively gleeful. “You see, Sherlock? You’re always complaining about Mycroft’s interference. He can be quite helpful on occasion.”
He continued to tease, wanting to get Sherlock to a place where he would be open and undefended, not confident and invulnerable. He knew how Sherlock’s aloof attitude and solitary nature had protected him during the horrible lonely years when he was tormented and bullied as a freak, but there was no need for it now, especially not when he was at risk of sliding back into his reliance on chemical defenses. He needed to let the people who loved him help. He needed to remember how good it was to receive.
John drawled in a scholarly tone. “In my professional opinion, you should be shaggable in another 24-36 hours.”
“Did you have tea?” He picked up the mug and held it to Sherlock’s lips. He glared and drank. “Did you take your paracetamol?”
John said, “If you get uncomfortable, a cramp, or an itch, or if you don’t like what’s happening, anything at all, you can break it, just like that.” He snapped his fingers for effect. “Ok?”
John did recon. The alley was lit by a single meagre bulb. The others had all been broken off in their sockets. There were two skips on one side and three on the other, with bins in between them. The arrangement would leave them almost completely sheltered from the street. John was weak with relief, as walking was quickly becoming impossible. They had to weave in between the obstructions and he pulled Sherlock towards the back of the alcove and stopped in his tracks. There were concrete stairs flush against the wall leading up to a door, held shut with a lock and chain. There was a handrail made of pipe on the other side. The top step was just about waist high. Sherlock’s waist high. John turned to him with a conspiratorial smile. “You knew exactly what you were doing. How long have you been plotting this, you sly fox?"
Sherlock gave him a lascivious grin and said, “Are you going to rub my bum at New Scotland Yard, Doctor?”
And so it continued, John interspersing questions with spanks from the paddle that noisily punctuated his words. He worked Sherlock through a timeline of the events again, this time highlighting his choices, their results, and the alternate paths he might have taken. When he began to review Sherlock’s history with Lestrade, the defenses began to come down. His bum had gone past pink and was red by now. Sherlock had begun to grunt and squirm after each swat. John steadied him with a palm on his back.
“Hiding was selfish and may have seemed funny from your point of view, but from Greg’s perspective it was potentially devastating.” He tried again to wipe his face, but Sherlock was too deep in his misery to worry about a messy face. He wasn’t even trying to protect his arse from the pressure of John’s lap. Sherlock wouldn’t feel that pain until he had processed the emotional pain. John let him cry himself out. He was anticipating his own aching muscles from the unusual exercise, so, eventually, he manoeuvred Sherlock into standing up. He helped him step out of his bottoms and pulled him to the side of the bed. He held his hand while he pulled the duvet and sheets down and drew the dressing gown off his shoulders. Sherlock was swaying on his feet and John turned him so he could kneel on the mattress and lower himself with assistance to lie flat on his front. He was still taking shaky breaths but seemed stable, so John said, “I’m going to get the gel, all right? I’ll just be a moment.”
John was startled out of his reverie when the shower started to run cold. Time to stop thinking. He had a record breaking speed-wank to be sure his body wouldn’t be confused about the purpose of the evening’s main event. This was not going to be spanking as foreplay. He didn’t want to run the risk of undermining Sherlock’s punishment with his own arousal. The man could sense weakness like a shark could sense blood in the water. John couldn’t afford to send him any mixed messages. He toweled off and put on a sturdy, sober pair of pyjamas. He grabbed a flannel and to further clarify the boundaries, he brought a straight-backed chair into the bedroom with him. Starting off on the bed was too ambiguous.
This was a far more elaborate set of consequences than he’d ever had to impose before. Of course, it was a more serious breach of trust and the potential repercussions of the failure of the dissuasive aspect of the punishment were unbearable to contemplate. But would it destroy the delicate balance they had built between themselves as lovers? Sherlock needed John’s firm presence and stability. He held him safely at anchor and transfused his self-control into Sherlock’s bloodstream as needed. Would Sherlock resent him for serving as an external boundary on his internal demons? He was childish, but he was not a child. Did he need a parent regardless? John had taken on aspects of the role. Mycroft, certainly. Father Greg had thought he needed it at one time. John had never asked if their relationship had crossed categories. He’d suspected so, based on the level of trust Sherlock placed in Lestrade. It hadn’t broken their bond, just changed its nature. John liked what they had established between themselves. Could it bear up?
John complied, driven by the building tension in his bollocks and the lingering (thrilling?) fear of someone happening upon them. He pinioned Sherlock with one hand on his back, the other clutching his hipbone, and he thrust wildly, in and out. The sound echoing around the alley now was that of John’s hips smacking into Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock moaned at the lewdness of it: the sound of being fucked in an alley. He shivered.
Greg and John smiled at each other and John asked, “Do you want a cab, Sherlock, or should Greg take us?”
Sherlock reopened his eyes, said, “Yes, John,” in a voice hushed with excitement. John grabbed one of the pillows and handed it to him. Sherlock slid it under John’s hips as he lifted himself up. He spread his legs and gave Sherlock a stern look. “I’m knackered, so if you want this, you’re going to have to do all the work. And once you’re done with that, you can have your way with me,” He teased and waggled his eyebrows.
“If you’re quite finished fantasising over my coveralls and excluding me from the marital benefits to which I am legally entitled, I’d like to have a piss.”
It was all fine; they were still playing. “Oh, all right. Bossy.” Sherlock devoted his laser-like attention to John’s arsehole, dripping more lube onto his hand and reestablishing his first finger quickly. He sped up when he was able to slide the second inside along the first and John gave him a lovely moan as encouragement. He twisted them and began scissoring slowly drawing the fingers out to stretch the rim. When they had relaxed sufficiently, Sherlock added a third finger, triangulating them to simulate the width of the cock that would be entering soon. John groaned, “That’s it, I’m ready. Go ahead. Use your cock now. I want you inside me. God, hurry up!”
He was having trouble getting the words out now, trying to keep still and failing. “Ow, I… I’ll…call you.”
John’s omelet, toast, jam, and coffee were all on the table. He’d laid a place for Sherlock at the side table where he could stand comfortably, and although the discretion was appreciated, it couldn’t keep a lovely blush from rising up from his throat and onto his cheeks when he walked through the sliding doors. “Oh, God.” He covered his face in embarrassment. John rubbed his shoulder as he passed by and said, “Never mind, it’s just me.”
Tiny, fluttery kisses were next, then nips and licks and nibbles and sucks until John had covered every inch of it with the affection it deserved. The moaning it brought out of Sherlock gave John’s cock a boost and he figured he’d better get serious about preparing its ultimate destination. He pulled those glorious mounds apart and sent his tongue on a journey up and down all that new territory. It was so delicious, Sherlock rose up on his knees and stretched his legs further, offering more access. The pillow became redundant. Happy for the offering, John zeroed in on the tiny bud of an entrance with the tip of his tongue, loosening and slicking it up.
“Another reason to wake up. I want to take care of it. Go wash up and when you finish, I’ll cool you off.”
“No, not worse. But definitely going to be uncomfortable. Let me get the ointment. And an icepack. Even a few minutes will help.”
When he got home, John was expecting stroppy Sherlock. He was quite capable of reinstating a sulk at the drop of a hat, but John was afraid that the boredom might have sent him into a full-on black mood. To John’s surprise, he was positively cheerful. For him, in any case.
He searched for John, hopping from side-to-side and clapping his gloves together. When he found his eyes, he grinned with an open smile and John headed towards him, schooling his face, determined not to spoil this moment of joy for him. He stepped close, intending to hug him, but Sherlock held him at arm’s length. “You don’t want to embrace me, now, John. I’m dripping sweat.”
Sherlock shot him a skeptical look. “That hardly seems in the spirit of the thing, John. Is that allowed?”
Sherlock turned to give John his ‘you’re so vacant’ look. “What kind of expression is that? If her goal is sexual intercourse, why would she want to knock him dead? Is it some kind of play on words, to do with her work in the morgue? Is that some kind of code for necrophi…”
Sherlock flushed an even brighter red and buried his face into John’s shoulder, trying to hide at the thought of the coming shame. He moaned, “Oh, no. I won’t be able to look her in the eye.” John laughed harder.
After 8 chapters of having his ass whupped, poor Sherlock wants to top because anything else is gonna hurt. Also, John is happy to switch because he's exhausted, so skip this chapter if it's not your thing. Sherlock will be back on the bottom next time.
John said, “Exactly. Slide over.” Sherlock moved gingerly off to the side while John lifted Sherlock’s arm from his chest. He wiggled out from under his leg and finally free, he drew the sheet up over his back.
Sherlock knelt on the bed and laid down on his front, groaning from the pain. John went around to the other side of the bed and slid in beside him sitting with his back against the headboard, waiting for Sherlock to allow himself to ask for what he wanted. Eventually, he tugged on John’s shirt to get him to slide down until he was flat on his back. Sherlock threw an arm and a leg over him and crept imperceptibly across the bed until he was stretched full-length on top of him.
He draped Sherlock’s arm across his shoulder and helped him around the railing so he could sit on the steps. As he sat, Sherlock grimaced and grunted out an unhappy sound. John winced in sympathy and brushed the hair from his forehead and kissed him. "Sorry, love. You ok? I got carried away."
Sherlock braced himself up on his hands raked his eyes over John, the flush on his cheeks, neck, and chest, the sheen of sweat across his brow, lips open, tinted red from fiery kisses. He sat back and slid his fingers down over his ribs and the still firm muscles of his stomach. When he was sitting between his knees, Sherlock pushed his ankles up and John let his knees drop open. Sherlock took hold of his cock to make sure he was slick enough to pick up where he left off.
The next week was far more interesting in terms of cases, and far too busy to consider a session at the ring. John was looking forward to a domestic weekend, to make up for Sherlock’s complete disinterest in food, sleep, and/or sex. On Saturday morning, Mrs. Hudson called up the stairs, “Ooh-hoo, boys. Package.”
“I can’t believe after all this time you continue to ask questions to which the answer is obvious. I’m right where you left me. Although most everyone else seems to have gone,” he said in a voice that sounded the slightest bit intrigued.
He enjoyed a blissful few hours of quiet, reading the papers and working on the blog. He edited the letter to Lestrade a little more thoroughly, but overall was pleased by the portions that weren’t snarky or condescending. The insults seemed pro forma rather than intentionally hurtful. “In my defense, I was inadequately supervised.” “My transgressions might prove beneficial at a later date, incorporated into a training activity to improve surveillance protocols, for example.” Lestrade would expect nothing less.
“I was careful, Sherlock. I knew minefields before I ever got near a warzone. I never needed to be rescued from anything, but you know who did? Harry. Over and over again. Drunk and stuck, drunk and lost, drunk and beat up, drunk and in lockup. Even after she left home, she would still call me wanting me to bail her out. And I did,” he admitted bitterly.
John nodded back with satisfaction and brought the plates and mugs to the table. He fed Sherlock while he was distracted by the newspapers. Attempting to broach the subject casually, he said, “You know, you still have one more letter to deliver.”
Sherlock moved to kneel in front of him, but John stopped him. “I have one question, before we start, and I’d like to know the truth. It won’t change anything, either way.” Sherlock gnawed on his lower lip, then nodded his head. “Were you really trying to escape the room? Or were you pleased with your cleverness?”
They ate in quiet and since it had begun to rain, the day’s walk was canceled. John printed out some emails from the website with cases that looked to be the least boring for Sherlock to flip through. He read those, then the papers, spread out on the sitting room floor, did some virtual composing and paced restlessly. He worked on the letter intermittently, still scratching out more than he left on the paper. The afternoon wound down into evening and John was still deliberating over the nature of the night’s punishment.
Sherlock sighed in resignation. “I guess I don’t have a choice then.” He groaned and stretched and John retrieved the gym bag. As they walked through the maze of bins, Sherlock looked back wistfully and said, “I’m sorry to lose that plug.”
I want to thank all of you who have commented so far. It's beyond encouraging. Most of all, a humongous, ginormous, crate-load of thanks to tiaoconnell for her above and beyond support. And being a beta! All hail tiaoconnell!
John dropped his head and laid his cheek on Sherlock’s hair. “Love, no, look at me. It’s all right, it’s ok, it’s not hurt crying, it’s love crying. Happy crying.” He stroked him and kissed the back of his head. “The letter is perfect.” Sherlock lifted his eyes, slowly, afraid of what he might see. John held him with his hands on the side of his face and wiped the tears away with his thumbs. “Look, see? Not sad. Proud of you, how insightful you are. There’s a word I’d never thought I’d use about you. The letter is brilliant. I know you’re telling the truth. It’s perfectly you.”
Sherlock turned to him with a look of such practiced innocence that John knew he was being punished. The message was, ‘see what you’re going to be missing out on because of your boring insistence on working at that intolerable surgery?’ He responded to the unspoken rebuke. “Can’t be helped Sherlock. Come eat your toast like a good boy. The later I arrive, the later I’ll have to stay.” He waited long enough to watch Sherlock finish at least a half a slice of toast, then proceeded to his own five minute shower and in another five they were in a cab on the way to New Scotland Yard. Accompanying him would make John that much later, but the risk of Sherlock absconding was too great. Not that he would necessarily be on his way to find a dealer. Everyone was quite hopeful about Sherlock’s progress so far. But he would do anything to escape a day of forced inactivity.
John said, “Figure it out, genius. In the meanwhile, how long will it take you to finish that letter so we can eat?” He began moving toward the kitchen.
She didn’t take any guff. “It’s not your bum, I’d worry about if I were you, young man. It’s your ego. Now go behave yourself properly and I’ll see you Monday.”
“All right. Show me. Impress me with your patience. I’m going to undress now. Close your eyes. Keep them closed. If you’re quiet, you can deduce what I’m taking off.”
Sherlock ignored him and continued to complain. “I hate breakfast. And I won’t even be able to sit through it.” He started to move himself gingerly onto all fours and John quickly looked away, not wanting to risk the temptation of the sight of Sherlock on all fours, naked below the waist, perfectly round, pink cheeks... Right. He retrieved the dressing gown from the floor and as Sherlock backed off the bed and put his feet on the floor, John slid the robe onto his shoulders. Sherlock hissed when the silky material slid against his aching rear.
John pointed his finger at him. “Not another word, or I’ll add back the hour I so magnanimously deleted a moment ago. And depriving you of sleep is like trying to drown a fish. No wonder they couldn’t break you down.” He lowered his hands to Sherlock’s arse and gave a two-handed squeeze, causing Sherlock to whine and push his hips up against John’s. He stepped away quickly. The electricity between them was immediate. “If they’d known all they needed to do was redden your bottom, you’d have given up all of Mycroft’s secrets and brought the British Empire to its knees.”
“Well then, you have my permission to stand up and walk to Lestrade’s desk. Sit in his chair and wait for me to ring his desk phone, then pick it up.”
Sure enough, as John was toweling off, Sherlock crashed through the door and then into the loo, flushed with his exercise, still wearing his trunks and peering into the mirror with one eye and judging the level of John’s concern with the other. “I was slow tonight. Mickey caught me on the cheek with a jab and he swears he didn’t hit me in the clinch, but I think there might be a bruise coming up over my kidney.” He looked at John with his innocent face, still believing it was effective on him after all these years, and said, “Do you think you could, uh, take a look at it for me? I’m sure it’s not serious, but kidney, you know.”
Sherlock arranged himself, pulling up his dressing gown, prepared for inspection. John noted with satisfaction that the redness and bruising was much reduced. The satisfaction dissipated as he tightened his grip on the handle of the cane.
The anger dissipated, leaving John spent. He desperately wanted the weekend to be over. He walked over to Sherlock and put his arms around him. Sherlock laid his head against his chest.
He turned back to Sherlock and closed the distance he’d put between them, ratcheting back up the tension in the room, but he merely grabbed Sherlock in a crushing hug and muttered in his ear, “Day 47. Good on you, you nerve-racking little prick.”
He rang off before John could say another word. He handed the dressing gown to Sherlock and said, “At least it’s not both of them.”
) and gave him a hug, which Sherlock didn’t return, which Jack didn’t seem to mind. When Sherlock turned away, Jack slapped him on the arse. The arse. His hand touched. Sherlock’s. Arse. John stood up and squared his shoulders, trying to ignore the testosterone flooding his system.
Sherlock through the door open with his usual flair, although John recognized it for the bravado it was.
John picked up his head and looked at him, puzzled. “I don’t have to let you loose. I’m not restraining you, Sherlock, remember? Pull yourself loose.”
“Shut up Mycroft, it’s not about the money, you know that. Sarah is my friend. And I want to keep my hand in. And you know better than anyone, if I don’t have time away from him, I’m liable to kill him.”
John was irritated with the simplistic answer. He let number four fall a little heavier, below the last. Sherlock jumped enough for John to have to grab him a little tighter. “Ow! Ow, ow. Four!”
Lestrade watched the exchange and came around to the front of the desk. He spoke directly to Sherlock now. “All right then, let me tell you what grateful looks like. You stay where I put you, you don’t pick any fights with anybody and no experimenting. And you,” poking his finger into John’s chest, “one minute after 4, and he’s in the cage. Oh,” he leaned over and grabbed a notepad from the desk, reading from it, “and a check-in on the half-hour and take-away for the division. Only the ones who didn’t volunteer to go out on patrol, which is half of ‘em,” looking pointedly at Sherlock, who attempted an innocent face. Lestrade continued. “You’re gonna sit at the desk up against the glass where somebody’s gonna be able to see you at all times. You can pace around the perimeter we set up but if you gotta use the loo, somebody goes with you.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but to John, they sounded like well thought out precautions. John was impressed once again with Lestrade’s attention to detail, even if Sherlock wasn’t.
Sherlock adamantly insisted, “NO! Of course I’m not enjoying it! You’ve seen my arse—I’m not going to be able to move normally for days as it is. Another one tonight is going to leave me crippled for a week. You don’t understand.” He shook his head in exasperation. “You must follow through. Don’t you see? The letter was true. I wrote it from ‘the heart’,” he said mockingly with gestured quotation marks around “heart”. “It was in no way calculated to influence my punishment. If you reward me, I won’t be able to trust my intentions in the future!” Confusion furrowed John’s brow and Sherlock gripped his knees.
“Stop it right now,” said John as he crawled right up over him and caged him in. He uncovered Sherlock’s face and mussed up his hair roughly with his fingertips. “You know that’s not true and it’s not kind to say so. You’re trying to make me feel guilty and that’s not fair.” He cleared his throat meaningfully.
Thoughtfully, with a somewhat surprised look on his face, Sherlock said, “You lied, John. You texted that you weren’t angry.”
John added just a touch of severity to his voice. “Not the way it works, Sherlock. I decide when the comforting is over. Up you get and to the bed.” He held on to his upper arm as he helped him up. Sometimes Sherlock was unsteady on his feet after a spanking, whether it was from the soreness or his wobbly frame of mind, wasn’t easy to tell. Whatever it was, he’d come close to falling once, and John wasn’t taking any chances. Sure enough, he swayed a bit and John stepped behind him and grabbed both arms. He didn’t point out that, in fact, Sherlock was
He got home an hour later replete with hackneyed Valentine’s Day accessories: chocolate covered strawberries, pink candles, champagne, flowers, a frilly greeting card and a small rectangular package wrapped in red paper and a lacy doily, tied up with a pink satin ribbon. He dumped everything on the table and bustled about the kitchen, retrieving a vase and putting up a pot of water for pasta. Sherlock rolled his eyes but reached for the package. John grabbed it first and held it behind his back, grinning. “No you don’t. Eight o’clock, remember? And no deducing before then!” The stern look was accompanied by a finger poking into Sherlock’s chest.
John froze immediately and sat down next to him, concern all over his face. “What? What is it, love? Are you ok? I’m stopping.”
Sherlock gave him a little push with his foot and rolled over onto his side, propping up his head on his elbow. From under half-closed lids, he looked John up and down appraisingly. John could practically hear the furious sorting of “Sex with John” data going on in the Mind Palace. As his eyes flitted all over him, John slid his robe off his shoulders and awaited the results of the survey. A lift of the eyebrow, a twitch of the lip and the declaration was made. “I can’t lie down, and I can’t sit. I can kneel and I can stand. Let’s start with standing.” John’s tongue poked out and he scraped his lower lip with his teeth. Sherlock sidled over to the edge of the mattress and stood up. He winced a little and stretched his head and arms back.
“Berk, I couldn’t take my eyes off you out there and I’m sorry I haven’t come sooner. But hurry anyway. I’m…hungry.”
John tried to take hold of himself but Sherlock grabbed his wrist and place his hand back on the bed. He leaned over John’s back and said, “This time, it’s my turn. Please?” He dragged the tips of his fingers lightly over the skin of John’s arms, tickling over his ribs, across his belly and then wrapping his fingers around his cock gently himself, still pushing in and out, but now giving his finger a little twist. The double stimulus brought out a gasp from John.
“In addition, spanking every night, enough that you’ll be sleeping on your front for a week. That’s for Greg. He’ll recognize the signs.”
“Oh, I’m gonna touch you. I’m gonna touch you wherever the fuck I want.” He stepped forward and cupped Sherlock’s exposed groin. Growling, he said, “Everywhere.” Sherlock sucked in a breath that ruffled John’s hair. John stepped back to look at the gym door, up and down the street again and said, “But where? Sherlock, where can we go? We’re going to need time.” With a slight squeeze of his hand, he stepped into Sherlock and said, “Not a lot, but enough to get the job done properly.” He clutched a fistful of Sherlock’s hair and pulled his head back. He watched his Adam’s apple rise and fall as he swallowed.
“That was last Tuesday. I’m keeping a calendar, so no one can accuse me of cheating.” John stated firmly. “It’s been more than a week.” Time to switch tactics.
“Oh, John. You can’t. Doesn’t matter what he’s told you or how he’s behaved, whatever you told him you were going to do, you’ve got to do. You have to finish it out to the bitter end. He knows it too, that’s why he sent the text. We’ve all been through this together, a dozen times and it just doesn’t work otherwise. Ask Mycroft.”
“Well. You could just let her cry. Just stand there and be with her while she cries. So she knows that you know that she’s…whatever she is. She might cry because she’s happy that you’re safe, or because your letter makes her sad, or she might just feel like crying. Sometimes you don’t know why. Just be brave enough to be with her if she cries.”
John smiled at him fondly and Sherlock closed his eyes again and let his head drop onto the back of the chair. John set about kissing everything he could reach and undoing a few buttons so he could reach a little more. In between the kisses, he kept speaking, but the words were registering only intermittently for Sherlock.
Molly sent a long email, which John saved to read during Sherlock’s corner time. A decent dinner, Sherlock did some virtual composing, John read journal articles and then crap telly till bedtime. Showers and then the corner again, hands on head this time. John had to keep things unpredictable, otherwise Sherlock would become habituated to the ritual and distance himself from it. John sat with him while he did the time, reading Molly’s email and when it was up, John called him over.
“Come on up here. There you go. I’ve got you.” He helped him up to sitting, making sure his arse was hanging over the edge of his lap and pulling his face into his shoulder. He rubbed his fingers through his hair and held him tight, murmuring meaningless sounds and comforting words while Sherlock cried. “It’s all right now, it’s all over and you were very brave. Go ahead and cry yourself out. As long as you need. I’m here and I’m not going anywhere.”
John told himself he was being unreasonable and sat on the bench in front of the lockers. Sherlock sat down beside him and said, “I’m really… that is…I--you know…” John rescued him.
Sherlock looked slightly nervous. “I, uh, didn’t want to wake you to ask if you would consider this an experiment, but I’m trying to write some music without actually hearing it. A melody came to me and I didn’t want to lose it, but…grounded, no violin, oh, you know…. It won’t be the same, but I was curious to see if I could capture it without actually hearing it. Is that…I mean, it’s not actually a real scientific…more of a musical exercise, if you think about it…”
Sherlock gave him an obligatory scowl to disguise his shy smile. John came up behind him to give him a hug, from the waist up, trying to maintain a safe distance between their hips.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him. “I’m tougher than the thread, John, get on with it.” His sarcasm was undermined a little by his open-mouthed panting.
“What does that tell you about your brother, that without a moment’s hesitation, he is willing to use all of the considerable resources at his disposal, to try and keep you from hurting yourself?"
John grinned ruefully and was starting to think they might just make it all the way through, when at 2:46, he felt his stomach slide. It was the call alert for Lestrade’s number. Not the text alert. He apologized to Mrs. Winslow, a regular on the third Wednesday of the month when the Senior Center was closed for staff meetings, and stepped into the hall.
Sherlock shook his head and pointed downwards toward his feet with his finger, careful not to pull on the thread. John twisted around and saw Sherlock’s cock standing at half-mast and swelling quickly. He looked back at Sherlock, breathing rather heavily himself, and gave him a fierce kiss, sweeping his tongue deep into his mouth and then tugging on his lower lip with his teeth. He growled at him. “God, you’re perfect. I can’t be this lucky.” He bit the side of his neck, sucking hard enough to bring a whimper from Sherlock, then then kissed him again. He went back to work. He fixed Sherlock’s left arm to match the right and let him wiggle around testing his range of motion.
Sherlock checked his watch and sighed with irritation. “So it is.” He gestured toward the sitting room. “If we must,” and they made their way to their chairs.
Sherlock came out of the ring glowing: sweaty and flushed with adrenaline, pink blotches rising up on a few areas of his otherwise white skin, where his sparring partner had made contact. A few of the fellows thumped him on the shoulder as he stepped down.
He thought he understood the signs, but he didn’t understand the meaning. That wasn’t the kind of question a brother-in-law would be asking and he shrugged in confusion.
The cabby gave him a face-splitting grin. “She already asked.” MI6 was always looking for drivers with nerves of steel. Somebody’d be profiting off the chaos of the day at least, John’s infernal optimism noted, always a silver lining.
All he got in return was “Hmm,” but John saw the ghost of a smile flicker across his face and knew he was pleased. He ate the entire sandwich, minus the crusts. Even helped with the washing up, without a word spoken. John thought, Mission accomplished. Sherlock was as addicted to praise and admiration as he had been to coke and heroin. John was happy to feed that habit. Most of the time he deserved it anyway.
The thrill of the chase lit in Sherlock’s eyes and John licked his lips at the sight of his hunter. Sherlock hefted it, trying to gauge the weight. A gram for the box, maybe two for the contents? What could possibly be so light? Couldn’t be any type of jewelry; wasn’t a typical shape anyway. John smirked. His brilliant detective was puzzled already. He shook it, but obviously, John had thought far enough ahead to wrap whatever it was in tissue and the sound was indistinct at best. Sherlock’s nose crinkled in frustration. Next he sniffed. Nothing. He held it up to the light.
Sherlock suddenly arched his back and stiffened and then he was coming all over John’s fist and jacket. When he finally went limp and finished shuddering, John returned to his two-handed hold of Sherlock’s hips, and his onslaught, panting and pumping, chasing the orgasm that was coiled tight in his belly, collecting itself at the base of his groin. Sherlock groaned in overstimulation as John found his prostate, and the knowledge that he had wrung him dry, sent John spinning into a funnel of sensation. He came with a groan and collapsed on top of Sherlock, unable to move, both from physical exhaustion and the strength of his climax. He rode it out and recovered slowly. Eventually, his concern over their precarious position and his lover’s likely discomfort roused him.
Still hoping for the tired, manageable version of Sherlock, for Lestrade’s sake, John lowered his hips and started to move them in very small circles, encouraging the stirrings of the erection that had wilted in the wake of Sherlock’s anxiety.
Sherlock flipped his hand over and kissed the back of the hand holding his own. John heard him whisper thank you, but it sounded very much like it was just to prove a point. No matter. He whispered back, “You’re welcome.”
All of Sherlock’s bravado left him and he stuttered, “Could we…” He looked away. “I’d like to…if it’s ok…I was kind of looking forward…maybe, you know if it’s all right…to… ”
Sherlock buried his hands in his arms and groaned while John drew himself up and for Sherlock’s benefit, said, with a straight face, “That will be quite enough Mrs. Hudson! We’ll replace the table and there’s an end to it!”
Sherlock’s skin was crawling with need and he was moving restlessly, searching for contact. “Shut up and touch me.” The pent-up tension roughened his voice.
The curly-haired head was bent over the microscope, but John thought two feet was close enough to stand to infiltrate his concentration. Perhaps not. He flicked off the light under the slide tray and was rewarded. Sherlock lifted his face then turned with a frown, as if noticing John’s presence for the first time.
“Go on and get ready. I’ll be there in a moment.” Sherlock heaved himself off John’s lap and the sofa and dragged his feet to the loo. No corner time was necessary to prepare for a caning. It prepared you all by itself. John was more worried about preparing himself. He had never experienced the cane himself but had seen it used enough at school to know its effectiveness. He’d used it on Sherlock only when he’d considered him to have endangered himself recklessly and unnecessarily. It would serve for Mycroft’s punishment.
“Oh, hush. I’ll warm you up in a second.” When he finished, John tossed it into the loo and crawled in beside him. He was wrapped up in Sherlock’s limbs in a moment and they fell asleep.
John needed to put himself back into the mindset of disciplinarian. It was going to take time and although he hated to do it, he had to put Sherlock back in the corner. The bickering with Mycroft would have upset Sherlock’s headspace as well. John held onto his hand and walked him very slowly towards the spot. After a few steps, when he realized where they were headed, Sherlock balked. “Wait, that’s not fair, John, I’ve already done more time than usual!”
Through gritted teeth, Sherlock said, “Isn’t teasing punishment, John? I thought we were through with that.”
“No need. Thank Molly when you see her.” Sherlock took a deep shuddering sigh and carefully maneuvered himself off John’s lap. In a slightly nervous voice he asked, “Are you still going to…take care of my…me?”  almost as if he weren’t sure it was worth a reprieve from spanking if it meant he wouldn’t be cuddled afterwards.
John froze and forgot himself. “Sherlock!” He was bombarded with hisses and glares from the regulars who were sitting nearby. Even Sherlock was scandalised and gave him an indignant look. John grabbed his hand and pulled, but Sherlock resisted and pointed to the chair opposite him. John tugged again, to no effect, then tightened his lips and searched his meager mind cottage for the vocabulary he knew he lacked. Finally he outlined a child’s drawing of a house with his fingers, but Sherlock stretched out his legs and gestured to indicate that he was relieved and in no hurry. John jerked his thumb towards the door, and Sherlock stuck out his chin, silently refusing. At the end of his tether, John held out both hands, cupping them in the universal gesture for a luscious arse.
John kissed the back of his neck and said, “Whichever you like.” John pulled the shapeless, faded thing out of the wardrobe and helped Sherlock wiggle into it. He sighed at the coziness and John proceeded with his doctoring.
Sherlock started to tick off on his fingers. “So first, I thought of the headphones. I could have turned up the music and it might have helped cut out the noise of those brutes coming back to the office. I could have tried looking out the window. I could have tried to get Lestrade’s attention. I could have texted you again and asked to you to speak to me, or asked Molly if she could talk to me. Then, when it started getting to be too much, I might have asked to use the loo, or go into Lestrade’s office. And although it’s a completely theoretical solution, I could have attempted to text a minor official the British government. A minor official, of course.”
The thought of entering the lion’s den by himself was enough to unsettle Sherlock entirely. He snapped, “Just eat already, will you?”
Sherlock turned from hanging his coat and shouted, “I never left the room! I was in my mind palace.”
“I was the judge and executioner before. Now I’m your doctor. And when the punishment is over, it’s over. That’s the catharsis part, silly.” He took the jar from the medicine chest and was back on his side of the bed. If Sherlock hadn’t been grounded, John would have straddled him and let the soothing and stroking take its course toward reconciliation sex, but he wasn’t going to soften. Or harden, as it were. He slid in next to Sherlock and pulled his shoulder down so he was on his front again. John lifted the bottom of his robe and sighed. Sherlock’s bum was pink, bright red in a few spots where the paddle had doubled over. “I recommend you keep your reservations about minimizing the effects of punishment to yourself this go round. You’re going to need all the help you can get.”
Pretending to be calm, John Captain-said, “I’ll tell you when I want you to lie down.” He ground himself up against him and Sherlock responded in kind. Fondling,
Sherlock stretched up his neck trying to feel John’s breath, but he was too quick for him and John took a step back. Sherlock reached out his hand, but John tsk’ed at him, “That’s cheating. Hands down.” Sherlock giggled the tiniest bit and gripped the pillow.
“Yes, believe it or not, you’re going to want to go and apologize to Mrs. Hudson, instead of feeling like it’s some meaningless chore I’ve given you to do.” Sherlock nodded quickly.
He turned back to John and said, "You better make sure he sees the error of his ways. If he doesn’t regret it, we’ll be living through this torture again soon enough.”
Sherlock was sitting there, waiting for him and John asked, “Are you ready?” He paused a moment before answering, “Yes, sir,” in a low, steady, voice. John set the chair so that Sherlock would be able to rest his torso on the bed, while his long legs hung off John’s lap. He sat down and Sherlock came around to stand in front of him in his dressing gown and pyjama bottoms.
John cut off a laugh and gave him another. His cheeks were springing back under the blows despite the abuse being laid on them.
In his mind’s eye, in a split second, John had Sherlock in a leotard and tights. Tights that went on for miles, clinging to the skin on his round arse, looking like a marble statue. He saw him bending over the barre, stretching out his back and arching…He licked his lips and took a breath to make a suggestion, but was preempted.
“You were brilliant. Now. Go. Shower. I expect you at the table,” he looked at his watch, “in 12 minutes.”
John pointed his finger at him and raised his voice. “No. Put it out of your head. I draw the line. You are not leaving this flat without trousers. I don’t care how sore your arse is.”
He rose off Sherlock’s back and came around on his side and pulled him up to standing. John reached for his jacket and searched the pockets for tissues. He gave a handful to Sherlock and then took a closer look at the jacket. He held it away from him in disgust “Ugh. This is going to have to go to the cleaners.” He wiped at the smears with some more tissues. The temperature had dropped and he was going to need it. Sherlock was still standing, tissues in hand when John turned back around and John laughed at his faraway expression. “Need a hand?”
Sherlock flashed him a hostile look and John pointedly watched himself pouring the tea and succeeded in keeping a straight face. He fixed Sherlock a cup also, just to give him something to do with his hands, and delivered each one. Sherlock shook his head at his, but John left it on the mantel. On his way back to his chair, he casually picked up Mycroft’s letter and put it on his side table. He sat in his chair with his cup and asked, “What’s this all about then?”
John stiffened and turned to look daggers at Sherlock who was suddenly regretting his insistence. John gripped the front edge of the bench. Time to give up the game. Sherlock leaned over and gripped the back of John’s head. With his other hand, he tugged up his shirt in back, then slid it down into his trousers. He gave him a kiss which left no doubt where his priorities were. After a lovely few seconds, he whispered in John’s ear, “Jealous yet?” He pulled away and looked at John with a wicked grin.
Sherlock turned and spoke to the window. “He’d say forty and I’d break after fifteen and he’d quit at thirty. I instinctually taught myself to break more quickly. I'm convinced it was not deliberate. In fact, I believe it was contrary to my own best interests and sincere desire, but I couldn’t convince him to remain firm. He was overly sentimental.”
Dinner was indeed done when Sherlock returned, resplendent in a blue silk dressing gown and purple boxers. The table was set, candles were lit and all accoutrements in place. They flirted all through dinner, twirling their arms to drink their champagne, feeding each other strawberries and chocolate cake and trading innuendoes. Eventually, John looked theatrically at his watch and said, “Oh, quarter of eight! You have somewhere to be, don’t you? Don’t want to be late.” Sherlock froze, then started to rise. John grabbed his wrist and said, “You should open your gift first, though.” He handed the small box to him.
Thwarted once too many times now, Sherlock burst out in frustration. “No, no, no, now. I want to feel it. Feel you. Really feel you.” He whined. Writhed.
John was thrilled to be able to feast his eyes on the naked entirety of him: the endless arms and legs, white skin, pink nipples, ribcage a little less prominent after days of regular meals. It had been an exercise in self-discipline to keep their interactions chaste, for both of their sakes. Now he ran his thumb over his lower lip and asked, “Where do you want me?”
Sherlock shifted from one foot to the other and said quickly, “Yes, yes sir, six is more than enough!”
“No, mother.” He couldn’t see it, but John was pretty sure there was an eyeroll accompanying his statement. He’d expect nothing less and he smiled to himself. When Sherlock finished, John took the glass and set it aside.
He laid the last as low as he could and Sherlock cried out, now stamping both feet alternately and crying into the pillow. He nodded his head and John slid the cane under the bed.
John let the tone go unremarked. He bustled about and brought two tablets, a glass of water, a cool, wet flannel, and the jar of ointment to the bedside. He sat on the edge.
John rumbled, “Now. Now.” He grabbed the lapels of the coat and dragged Sherlock to the steps. He took off his own jacket and laid it on the top step, trying to cover the concrete to spare the tender expanse of Sherlock’s pale chest. There were already pink scrapes on him from the gloves that had hit him during the bout and John wasn’t planning on being gentle. Sherlock had been goading him all night and had had a goal in mind: it wasn’t lovemaking. The least he could do was spare his skin. He stepped back to release his rock hard cock and Sherlock pushed past him to stand in front of the steps. The coat began to slip off his shoulders as he grabbed the lapels to remove it.
“Oh, right, uh, let’s see. Featherweight is one of the lowest weight classes in boxing. You can only have a true bout between fighters in the same weight class. It’s like a jockey on a horse. If you don’t make the weight, the fight is off. We’d schedule bouts for Sherlock and he’d come in half a stone under, looking like a walking stick. Or, sometimes, worse, hyped up.” John tilted his head.
, although in fact, Kasseem kept turning his head around to chat with John. “What did you think of the bout? You’ve never seen him before, have you? He’s light on his feet, isn’t he?”
Sherlock was wearing chaps. Nothing but a pair of chaps. Made of black leather. They were basically a pair of leather trouser legs attached on either side of his hips to a belt. They hugged his thighs like…ballet tights. The top of each leg was cut off on the diagonal, leaving a perfect triangle of Sherlock's pelvis completely bare. His white skin positively glowed in the blue security light from the building, the dark curls trailing down from his navel and running below the belt, looking jet black, not their true chestnut. He flapped the coat shut again and looked around the corner to check the door of the gym. In a low gruff voice, he asked, “Do you wanna touch? Do you wanna touch me*…” He pulled the coat open again. “There?”*
Through clenched jaw, John said, “Christ. You’re a menace.” His legs dropped open and he grabbed the seat of the chair. Leaning towards him, Sherlock closed his eyes and inhaled deeply through his nose, taking in the smell of him: the lingering scent of his own expensive cedarwood body wash (stolen), the sweat of the days work, the sharp medical smell of alcohol and underneath, the man’s musky arousal. His cheeks rubbed back and forth and up and down, encouraging the increasing pressure in his trousers.
Sherlock froze and stared at him with widened eyes. John shouted at him. John tried very hard not to shout at him, he hardly ever did anymore, only when Sherlock was pretty sure in advance that he’d be yelling about something he’d decided to do anyway, but he was yelling now, so something must be wrong. For the life of him, he couldn’t think what it might be. He stood up and looked around for some forbidden substance he might have forgotten to clean up. No alarms. Nothing burning. Or leaking. Or visibly structurally compromised. He looked back mystified. “What is it? What did I do?”
John truly was surprised. He thought it would be a last minute, pushing the boundaries, Sherlock delaying forever weekend. This would open all sorts of interesting possibilities. “NOOoooo. I can’t believe it. Tell me.” He looked at his watch. “Quick.”
Sherlock watched him with the realization that while it might be a thrill to poke a bear with a stick, you'd better know when to stop.
Sherlock lifted his eyelids up a bit and in his little voice, said, “Can I have the ugly oatmeal one?”
Mrs. Hudson was the usual go-to person on days like these, but Wednesdays were bridge days and they were sacrosanct. He wouldn’t even dare to ask.
Sherlock was writhing, twisting his arse into the sheet in frustration at not being able to touch John, touch himself, touch something. Struggling to bring in enough air to form the words, he said, “Good. Take your bloody clothes off already.”
Sherlock nodded his head with certainty this time and said, “A six isn’t so bad. I can handle a six. For Molly. Seeing as how…”
Sherlock shook his head, sighed and dropped back into John’s lap. John tried again. “What are you doing? There’s no reason we have to have the last round of spanking. I’m declaring you officially pardoned.”
Sherlock smiled halfway and stuck his hand out for a shake. “My arse is in your hands. I can’t believe I’m agreeing to my own thrashing,” he said, shaking his head ruefully. John snorted and replied, “Me neither.”
He leaned down and kissed each side of John’s lower back and the dimples below. Sherlock held the curve of his arse and relished the feel of it filling his hand, his fingers reaching just to the top of John’s thigh. The fine hair tickled the palm of his hand. The firm muscles resisted the pressure of his fingers, but he squeezed anyway. With his fingertip he traced the trail of lube. Deciding John wasn’t slicked up enough, he slathered more on top of it. John started moving his hips, chasing his fingers, but Sherlock laughed and kept them just out of reach. The mischief was a pleasure of its own, but Sherlock still had inhibitions he struggled to overcome. John may have resisted acknowledging his homosexuality, but Sherlock still had trouble acknowledging any sexuality at all.
“Do you want some—“ He cut himself off, knowing he’d get no answer and made toast for the both of them. When breakfast was ready, he waited for a break in the serenade, took the bow from Sherlock’s hand and laid it on the music stand. He got a glowering for his trouble, but followed through, saying, “Come and eat.” Sherlock put the violin in the case reluctantly. John grabbed a cushion from the sofa and took Sherlock by the hand. He wanted him to have at least one slice so he opened the bidding: “Two slices of toast.”
He thought, ‘Come on, Sherlock, 46 days. Don’t waste them.’ They had been good days, everyone agreed. Sherlock seemed to thrive on the predictability of a schedule. He had even toughed it through a sudden change when Mrs. Hudson had run a fever on one of her shifts and Sherlock had insisted (!) on taking her to the surgery for John to check her over. He’d gone home by himself after dropping her off at Mrs. Turner’s for her to fuss over, and he’d spent the afternoon composing. Positively domestic. They’d celebrated with Chinese takeaway and an epic night of shagging. Since Mrs. Hudson had spent the night, they’d exceeded all previous records for volume. John had had to order a new black silk blindfold after they’d discovered that somehow during the festivities they’d shredded the old one. John smiled dreamily. Good times.
When they entered the office Lestrade was already elbow deep in files, and Sherlock gave John a smug look. Lestrade looked pointedly at Sherlock, pointed to a chair and ordered, “Have a seat.” Sherlock blushed all the way to the tops of his ears and tightened his lips. “No.” John pinched his bottome and the blush deepened. Sherlock flinched. He stuck out his chin, closed his eyes, and corrected himself. “No, thank you,” he said. It put John in mind of himself as a first year French student, rolling words around his mouth, trying to make them fit.
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” He sounded genuinely reverent. “You got yourself ready.” John pulled back to stare at him with widened eyes, black pupils crowding out the blue, with the low light and pure lust.
Mickey looked slightly impressed that John seemed to know a little jargon. He pointed toward a man in the center ring, kneeling in front of a short stool. “Jack’s on. Doug’s got a date. Might be getting serious.”
“I might subconsciously try to influence your future decisions and you won’t be able to tell if I’m being sincere or not! No, you
John replied agreeably, “You’re right. We’ll have to revise our terms in future. Designated meals? Standard? Traditional? You choose.”
John licked his lips and relaxed his shoulders. Target acquired. Of course, Sherlock was telling only a partial truth. He’d found some of her proclivities thoroughly intriguing. He pouted as a diversionary tactic. “I’m somewhat disappointed that you are still threatened by a,” he waved his hand around vaguely and made a mental note to encrypt The Woman’s contact info on his mobile, “non-entity who was never any threat to your complete possession of my heart. And other… assorted parts.”
Sherlock pushed back against the tickling wetness, trying to draw John further inside of him. John hummed and Sherlock’s hips started to move in no discernible pattern, making it difficult for John to focus his lingual attentions, so he resorted to broad, flat swipes, which Sherlock had no objections to. When John’s tongue wore out, he pulled away and Sherlock whined in complaint. John gave him a swat and said, “Patience, you greedy thing.” In response, Sherlock waggled his arse as alluringly as he knew how, which was unnecessary, because anything he did with his arse sent John’s blood coursing southward.
“Well it’s not possible. I am meeting with the representative of the…a very important person and there are protocols that must be maintained. I don’t even have anywhere to lock him up! My whole staff is on call. You’ve got to get someone else. You will get someone else, won’t you?”
Mrs. Hudson was not pleased, but honestly, it had been worth it. She had been at her sister’s for the weekend and they’d thought they’d try to make up a plausible story, but a woman who knows where you keep your handcuffs is not easy to fool. She went on and on about how she’d had that table since she’d moved back from Florida and that she was very fond of it, etc. but there were, no doubt, elements of teasing in her questions about how they possibly could have split it down the middle. After John had apologized about seven times and Sherlock had insisted that it couldn’t possibly make any difference how the table had broken, she said, “Well, boys, I’ve been around the block a time or two and if you don’t want to explain what happened, I’ll just draw my own conclusions. But even if I’m not going to get the whole story, could you answer just one question?”
John pulled his head down and kissed his forehead. He wiped his face with the flannel and said, “Of course I am. Git. Now lay down.” The bruising on Sherlock’s arse had faded and the doctor in John regretted having to bring it back up tomorrow, but was pleased that his ministrations had succeeded. Sherlock didn’t react as strongly to the application of the gel and sighed in contentment. Or as close as he could get with a sore arse and two more spankings to go.
Sherlock took another look at him for reassurance that he was content and then dedicated himself to his own gratification. He picked up John’s other leg and scrambled forward so both of them were hanging over his shoulders. The rhythm he began was slow and deep and allowed him the thrill of breaching John over and over again. Then, his pent up desire overwhelmed him and he jerked back and snapped forward, his hips slapping against John’s arse. John rocked in sync with him, offering no resistance, welcoming the waves washing over him, happy to let Sherlock take him along for the ride. He crooned, “Oh, yes, aah…” and it liberated Sherlock to chase his pleasure, fast and hard. He had satisfied his lover and had nothing to prove.
“Oh, sorry, yeah,” John said, and took a darting look at the floor, snapping his eyes back to Sherlock, as soon as he had it in hand. He dropped it on the bed properly this time and started on the rest of his clothing.
John’s tongue slid out of his mouth and drew back over his bottom lip. “What’s this, then?” Sherlock looked like a siren and he felt like a sailor about to crash on the rocks. He had a feeling he wouldn’t regret it in the slightest.
“I’m afraid I’ve smeared…fluids all over the pillows. And you.” He attempted a chuckle that ended with a few shaky breaths.
“It’s a case, John! You barely have time for a shower. If you didn’t stink, I’d make you skip it. Hurry up and eat your toast.”
Sherlock sighed and started to roll off, but he froze when the pain registered. “Ow.” He looked indignantly at John as if it were his fault.
It was a delicious breakfast. Sherlock cooked so seldomly, that it was easy to forget that he was a chemist, in and out of the kitchen. His arse had cooled off enough that John was able to coax him to sit gingerly on a sofa cushion at the table. He knew that after this evening, it would be at least a couple of more days before he’d be able to manage it again, and John thought he should take advantage of the opportunity while he could. They cleaned up together after the meal and John asked him, “Would you prefer to walk now or later, love?”
They settled on curry and although Sherlock stalled brilliantly, he ate a plateful, and a few teaspoons of coconut rice pudding. They cleaned up together and Sherlock started to fidget. John knew he’d ordinarily be reaching for his violin or laptop. He checked the time and said. “You’ve got a couple of hours before the…” He stumbled then recovered, “we get ready for bed. You could start one of your letters.” Sherlock let his head drop back and stared at the ceiling. “Sooner begun, sooner done?” he said encouragingly. Sherlock dragged himself dramatically to the desk and made a production of paper rustling and pen seeking. John schooled his expression, which threatened to break into full-on smiling. “Who’s first?” he asked.
Sherlock took the position over John’s lap again, but his erection was decidedly gone this time. John took a deep breath and said, “Five by paddle Sherlock, then twenty by hand. I want you to know that’s off by five from what I was planning on before and that’s what it will be. That’s only to set off the caning. I’m not cutting back because of your letter or because you were honest about the, you know, reprieve thing. We’ll figure out another way to reward you for making that decision.” Sherlock looked around at him with a soft face and nodded. John cupped his cheek with his hand for a moment.
He took one look at Sherlock’s face and said, “Option 1 then.” He sat in the chair next to him and began writing.
“You’re muddled. Teasing is part of the reward.” John ghosted his fingers over the tender skin of his arse, bringing up chills all over the rest of him. He continued to provoke. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like a nap? Rest might be the best thing for you and your arse right now, you know. Speaking as your doctor.”
The side of John’s mouth quirked into a half smile and he said, “Funny how you only think so when it’s agreeable to you. Not when I tell you it’s time to eat or sleep.” He grabbed some lotion from the night table and warmed it up in his hands. He straddled Sherlock’s legs and started with light strokes on the backs of his thighs. He gradually increased the pressure until he was kneading the muscles. When he found a knot he focused on it, sliding his thumbs over it and around it, until he could feel it start to soften and break up. When the hamstrings were loose, he ran his palms over Sherlock’s sharp hipbones and skipped over the bruises. They made him feel guilty, despite knowing their necessity. He dug his thumbs into the cords of his lower back on either side of his spine but Sherlock started up with a gasp.
Sherlock led the way to the dining room. When Mycroft saw them, he was surprised and placed his napkin on the table. He stood and beckoned toward his private office, where they could speak freely, but Sherlock shook his head and pointed to the library; there would be fewer people there at dinnertime but silence was still mandatory. Mycroft’s surprise turned to suspicion.
Sherlock rumbled, “I’d like to practice some technique of my own, if you don’t mind. Wouldn’t want to get rusty.”
They ran through the litany of questions and answers and Sherlock flinched and squirmed through a spanking that under ordinary circumstances, he might not have even noticed. But with his bum already tingling and as the dialogue became more intimate, he began to hear the cracks in Sherlock’s voice.
John answered quietly, “Sarah didn’t call yesterday Mycroft. She called today. I need a sitter today.”
“I know, I know. I haven’t argued, have I?” Sherlock heard the guilt John was trying to outrun. “You were very just. And it all makes perfect sense. I’d be happy to avoid all of it of course, but I’m willing to accept it. I hope it will sink in. I…”
John gave him his death grin and said, “Never felt the need. Always been able to handle trouble without any fancy technique.”
John nodded. “All right then. I haven’t worked out all the details yet, but close enough to start. Feels like a month has gone, but it’s still Wednesday. Consider yourself grounded through Sunday. Loss of all privileges.”
John just held him just like that for a while, until his shoulder went numb and he worried that Sherlock might actually fall asleep in that position. He repeated, “You’re alright now. You’re going to be fine. Come have a lie down on the bed, and I’ll take care of you.” Sherlock lifted his head and looked blearily at John, then turned so he could put his feet on the floor. John stood up after him and tugged him toward the head of the bed. He gave him a slight push onto the mattress and Sherlock went to his hands and knees and collapsed, sprawled diagonally. John grabbed the flannel and wrung it out in a bowl of water. “I’m going to try to cool you off a little bit.” He laid it gently across his bum and Sherlock startled off the bed, hissing at the sting. “Sorry, it will feel better in a moment.” Sherlock settled again and John rubbed circles into Sherlock’s lower back until he felt that the coolness had gone out of the flannel and he repeated the procedure until Sherlock was tolerating the contact. On this night, John used aloe gel to cool the sting, less concerned about bruising.
John was genuinely pleased for her and walked towards Sherlock, saying, “That’s great, did you hear that Sherlock?” He patted him on the arse and he looked up indignantly and John repeated the essential data with a significant look.
The mound shuffled itself towards the center of the mattress and he sat. He tugged the cover down and tried to comb the tangled curls into some kind of order.
“I haven’t even touched you yet and look how hard you are.” Sherlock looked and looked back at John with pleading eyes. “You’re going to have to breathe though. Deep breaths, remember?”
Molly said, “You're going to find somebody, though right? He’s doing so well, you’re not going to leave him alone?”
The only words Sherlock could push out were, “John, John, John,” and then he was arching his back and coming onto his chest. The sight sent John spiraling over the edge after him. Sherlock could feel John’s release inside himself and he shuddered through aftershocks. When John finished, he collapsed, boneless, and they lay chest to chest, circulating their breaths into one another. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and hummed. The rumble vibrated into John and he smiled. He wiggled as his cock, soft enough, now, finally slipped out of Sherlock and there was stickiness everywhere.
“You’ve kept yourself clean. We’ve just been helping. You’re going to spend the day with Lestrade,” Sherlock rolled his eyes and groaned, while John kept talking, “and there’s no way he’s going to let you slip away. He’s better than all of us at keeping his eye on you. He’s certainly the most experienced. And you’re NOT to take that as some kind of challenge.” He removed the pillow again and gave him a very stern look. Sherlock sighed, accepting that he was beaten. For the moment.
Mycroft closed his eyes, lifted his chin toward the ceiling and gritted his teeth. He gave Sherlock a stern look and straining to keep his voice calm, said, “Capacity, Sherlock, and intent. You were impaired at the time of the signing of all contracts and you did not enter into the agreement in good faith. It’s irrelevant.” He took a deep breath. “Tell us how Detective Inspector Lestrade failed you.”
Sherlock squirmed and fidgeted, but John let it pass. Greg hmmphed, choked back a laugh, glared at Sherlock at one point and finished the letter. He placed it on the desk and flipped to a new page in the notepad lying there and scribbled something. Sliding his finger down the letter, he paused then wrote something else on the pad. He folded it thoughtfully and returned it to the envelope. He stood for a moment then turned to his filing cabinet. He shuffled through the drawer and pulled a bulging folder out partway, then slipped the envelope inside. He looked at Sherlock and said, “Right then.” He looked at John next and they nodded at one another.
To John, Mycroft said, “I gave him parole. He didn’t last a week.” He turned back to Sherlock, “Would you say that the facilities were similar in their failure to keep to best practices?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked at him like he was being even more dense than he’d been the moment before. “Obviously, again. Try to keep up, John. And I never did, feel like that, before I met you.” Sherlock paused for a moment, another realization washing over him. He looked accusingly at him. “It’s your fault, isn’t it?”
“Back to the question: discomfort and embarrassment? Tell me how they’re correlated to the positive emotions. Why didn’t you feel those things before?”
Teasing, he said, “I don’t want you sore again, Sherlock. I don’t want to have to wait to be able to have you again when I want you. Maybe we should keep at it a little while longer.”
John switched off the phone and picked up a scone. He chewed thoughtfully as Sherlock twitched his foot and played imaginary scales on his thigh, glancing every few seconds at John, who was now glancing occasionally at Sherlock over the rim of his mug. Sherlock watched him talking quietly to himself, “…best served... cold… justice… mercy…” He was not comforted. The longer John ignored him, the twitchier he got. When he couldn’t hold himself still any longer, he stood, tentatively. John said, “Sit.” He sat. After what felt to Sherlock to be an eternal 30 minutes of shifting, shuffling, tapping, and twisting, John finally beckoned him to the table with a single finger. He flew, then waited to be directed. John spoke. “Is there paper and a pen there?” pointing to the table across from him. Sherlock looked and nodded.
Sherlock did so and they agreed that they could be trusted to shield him from public almost-nudity. As he pulled them over his bare arse, John had to turn away and remind himself that the drought was in effect for three more nights. “Sherlock, if you’re ever at a loss for an appropriate birthday or Christmas gift for me, I’d be quite happy to take you on a naked coverall walk.”
John gave him a severe look. “I thought we’d established that you’re to stay covered in public. And besides, yours is not much better.” Sherlock looked startled and stood up, pulling the coat to the side to try to get a look at the lining, but John smacked his hand. “Button that up and leave it alone. We’ll take care of it when we get home.” To himself mostly, “Speaking of which, how are we going to get home? Not even you are going to be able to get a cab from here...Budge over.” John sat down next to him and Sherlock leaned his head onto his shoulder.
Mickey gave him the formal tour and John kept his eyes peeled for the fellows whose names he had engraved in his memory. He attempted a casual question. “So, Mickey, who’s the cornerman tonight?”
Sherlock spoke very briefly and handed her the letter. Her eyes flitted between him and the letter. John looked away when she caught him watching. He looked back and saw the flickering changes in her face: concern, confusion, surprise, affection, sympathy, amusement. Then John saw the quivering bottom lip and muttered, “Shit,” under his breath. Sherlock turned to look at him with panic, but John drew himself up and nodded at him with tight lips and a stern look. Sherlock nodded and took a deep breath. He looked back at her and braced himself. She looked up at him and said something. He gave a tiny nod and she approached him as if she were walking a tightrope. She stuck out her arms and he lifted his. She grabbed him gently around the waist and he managed to place one arm around her shoulders. They held their positions for a few seconds, then stepped away from each other and avoided eye contact. Then Molly opened the door and John heard Sherlock saying, “…never speak of this again.”
Mrs Hudson peeked through the chain on her door, wielding the just-in-case cricket bat they’d bought for her, just in case. “Oh, boys, try to give me a little notice next time if you can. Have fun.” They ignored her. She exchanged the cricket bat for the noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones they’d got her for Christmas and cranked up the ELO.
Sherlock, chin propped up on his fists, weighed the statistical probabilities. John stood waiting, hands on hips. Finally, Sherlock pronounced the verdict, “Necessary risk, John. Science. We need a self-printing camera for future…events. Of course the very existence of photos might cloud the results in the sense that the effects of the actual punishment may be conflated with the…”
“Lestrade.” Five smacks on the left. He moved his arms up and buried his face in them. John could see the muscles in his arms trembling.
They stood together in silence for a few moments, until Sherlock shook his head, to clear it, and said, “Don’t wait up.” John grabbed him for a kiss and he left with his usual flourish.
Day 3 of grounding was more of the same. For a man who hated to go to bed, Sherlock hated to get out of it. John finally woke him with a kiss for Day 49. After a meagre but acceptable breakfast, Sherlock wrote his letter to Molly, a bit more reserved than the others. Their past was more painful and unresolved, and although time had helped to heal the wounds, they were raw enough to require less probing of the past. Sherlock fell short on the word count, but John let it slide to preserve the present equilibrium.
Sherlock snuggled closer. “Can’t we just sleep here? Run your fingers through my hair,*” pouting, then demanding in turn.
Sherlock lifted only his eyes from a gelatinous, black mess. John thought the arachnid phase had ended with the Brazilian Wandering Spider.
John smiled. “You’re being punished, Sherlock, not shunned. I still love you. And I want to help you through this. I tried to have it make sense, not be just, I don’t know, random suffering.”
When Mrs Hudson finished her tandoori, John waved the envelope under Sherlock’s nose and ordered another naan wrap for himself. Sherlock grabbed it and then took Mrs Hudson by the arm. They walked to look out over the lock and after a little while he handed her the envelope. While she read the letter, he twitched and fidgeted. She tucked it in her pocketbook and then took his cheeks between her hands and tilted his forehead down to rest on hers. They communed for a moment and she let him go. They chatted, or Mrs. Hudson chatted, for a while and when John finished his meal, they strolled home leisurely.
Mycroft sighed deeply, and said, “I know, I know. And I hope you know how deeply grateful I am that you’ve taken on the task. I apologize if I’ve offended you. Text me if all else fails. I suppose we could put him on a plane for a few hours.”
He’s been afraid of being close to people, He hasn’t known how to have friends as long as I’ve known him and the way Mycroft talks about it, his whole life. I imagine he’s distanced himself to be safe from people who couldn’t know him and understand who he is. Tell him he’s safe now. Tell him we love him for who he is and that he can let us in now because we don’t want to control him. If he loves us, he’ll control himself because he knows it will make us happy and make us closer. It’s kind of a miracle that he wants to be closer now.
They came in time to view punishment as a kind of a reset button and it was usually followed by weeks and sometimes months of peace on Baker Street.
Billy didn’t answer, but that wasn’t unexpected. He rarely picked up straightaway. He didn’t bother leaving a message. Billy would recognize his number and in any case, there was only one reason John would be calling him and he would probably ignite the homeless network within minutes. Next was Molly. He knew she would blame herself and he dreaded making the call, but St. Bart’s was a safe place Sherlock might head to if he felt the craving drawing him off course. She picked up on the first ring.
And now John was truly impressed. “The Diogenes Club. You really are my brilliant boy, aren’t you?” He walked over to Sherlock, bent down and kissed him. “How clever are you!”
Sherlock closed his eyes and finally said, “I can’t think of any way for you to fuck me that wouldn’t hurt my arse. And I want to fuck you John. Please? Let me fuck you?”
John walked towards him and grabbed his hand, trying to keep him moving. “The penny drops. Now tell me where the discomfort and embarrassment comes from, my savant idiot.”
John answered rapid fire. “He’s had breakfast. You can offer him something for tea around 1,” and turned around to glare Sherlock into silence, “BUT he doesn’t have to eat it. I will be here by 4. If there’s traffic I’ll call you for a car with sirens to come get me, but I don’t expect any problems. He knows there will be severe consequences for ANY infractions,” another glare, “and he knows he should be grateful to you for helping him out this way.” He turned once more at Sherlock’s indignant inhalation and fixed him with his best, grim captainly face and said, “Don’t you, Sherlock” in a tone that was far from questioning. Sherlock closed his eyes and raised his chin. Through gritted teeth, he spoke directly to John. “Yes, I know.”
John looked down and smiled. “Sherlock, I’m going to walk out with Hudson. I want to pick up a few last minute things. You’ll be alright?”
It was a quiet day, Sherlock still cheerful and riding the wave of endorphins that the successful closing of a case brought him. John wrote up a first draft for the blog, asking Sherlock for details and prolonging the serenity by stroking his ego. The praise and admiration was well deserved. Sherlock tried to disguise his delight, but John knew the tells: a slight dipping of his head, the smile downturned at the corners, and an embarrassed little shrug of his shoulders. John cherished every one of them. It was so rare to see him enjoy himself like an ordinary person. He played his violin, stole John’s laptop when he could, and puttered around his microscope, sneaking petri dishes into the fridge when he thought John wasn’t looking. They watched the usual crap telly and went to bed.
Sherlock consciously attempted to relax, but John advised him, “Push back, love. It will make it easier for me to come in.” Sherlock did as he was told and the second finger slid in smooth as silk. Scissoring and stretching, John waited to hear the noises that told him Sherlock was ready for the third, a soft sigh. “What do you think, Sherlock, are you ready for another? Are you loose enough for my cock?”
John shook his head at him. “You’ll never learn, will you, to keep your mouth shut.” He gave him a pinch on one of the spots that had returned to its original color. “You’re absolutely right, as usual.” He was pleased that the bruises were fading into an awful greenish yellow and the welts were no longer quite such an ugly red as they had been even a day earlier. Their swelling had gone down as well. Sherlock still inhaled sharply when he initially rubbed arnica onto them but he settled quickly and purred when John worked it into the bruised areas.
John puffed out “God, you’re cruel, stop messing about.” and lowered his head to the bed and wagged his arse in circles, trying to entice Sherlock into entering him. He growled, “Come on. Come on. You’re taking too long.”
John held his finger in front of Sherlock’s mouth until Sherlock realized what he wanted and opened up. “Suck.” The word sent Sherlock’s Adam’s apple up and down his throat. As Sherlock sucked, John watched it intently. “That’s it. You’ll want it nice and wet.” A squeak leaked out around Sherlock’s lips. John pulled his finger out with a pop and said, “Good boy.”
Sherlock shook his head quickly. “No…no…fast…fast as you can…I want it to be over. Quickly… please.”
“Save it. You know you earned it.” John continued to rub gently, eliciting peevish sounds when he hit a particularly sensitive spot. “Sorry, love, but it will help. Are you cold? I don’t think you're going to enjoy covering up your bottom. When I finish I’ll get you a shirt.”
John felt a twinge of guilt and had to remind himself that the man had been shot and stabbed and would survive a sore arse. He reminded himself,
Sherlock looked up at him and opened his mouth to argue, but John merely quirked an eyebrow at him and he closed his mouth and sucked in his lips. He bit down on them to keep in the words that were threatening to push themselves out. He eased himself off the sofa sideways to avoid any pressure on his rear and dragged himself to the loo. John watched his back, pleased at his compliance and self-control. When he heard that he had finished in the bathroom, John took his turn and changed into thick joggers for the event.
John walked over and put his arms around Sherlock’s waist. He tilted his head up to place a chaste kiss on his lips. “It would be tragic for the world to lose a melody of yours, love, and I think it was an elegant solution to the dilemma. Can’t wait to hear it. And good for you figuring out a way to keep from getting bored. I might just shorten the drought by an hour for that.” John felt the tension leave Sherlock’s body as he turned his head away, trying to hide his pleasure at the praise to no avail. John pulled him back and gave him another kiss. “How much work did you get work done on the letter?”
“But John, we don’t need the money! We had so many cases last month, we can afford to take it easy for a while!”
John knew that the stretch, an initial burn, was a sensation that Sherlock relished. John didn’t indulge him—or himself, often.
John gave him a filthy look. “You sure? I rather enjoyed it this evening.” He reached behind him and gave his bum a swat.
“No games, Sherlock. I’m going to call everyone off, so if you’re not there when we get back, so help me…”
Sherlock gave him a suspicious look. “In that case, I withdraw my offer.” He ostensibly returned to his article, but the combination of curiosity and anxiety rendered him incapable of reading.
Sherlock rolled over unconsciously and cried out as his rear hit the mattress. “Why are you waking me up to face my misery? Let me sleep. My arse hurts.”
John checked his watch. “Agreed. Very sensible.” He stuck his hand out towards Lestrade and they shook on the gentlemen’s agreement. He shoved Sherlock towards Lestrade and said, “Sherlock? Sherlock. Agreed?” He gave him another little shove. Sherlock uncrossed his arms and clenched his fists. He tightened his lips and stuck his hand out reluctantly. Lestrade grabbed it and pulled him in tight. Sherlock was caught off balance and Lestrade grabbed his head to whisper in his ear. “It’s for your own good you mad bastard. We’re not gonna let you slip away from us this time.” He shoved him away and turned back toward his desk to give Sherlock a moment to recover from his affectionate assault.
“Ah.” John pulled the top of the newspaper again ignoring Sherlock’s growl. “I think I’m going to impose a deadline. That will help.” He expected an outburst and he was not surprised.
John said, “Ok. One more thing. I want to show you about being in charge.” He snapped the thread off the spool. “See? I’m not going to be restraining you. You’re going to be restraining yourself. But only if you want to. See?” He snapped another length of thread off. “Do you understand?””
“Naah, really, he’s a welterweight, where he should be now, thank god, but there have been times he hasn’t been able make weight for a bout. Forget about the days you could have knocked him over with a feather. The nickname stuck though.” Mickey shook his head. “The bad old days.”
Sherlock did as he was told, faster, more, and their eyes met again. Love and longing combined to tear through John, overwhelming him and he had to look away. Sherlock practically buzzed around him and John’s legs started to tremble. Sherlock brought his lips all the way up and nuzzled at the head, ending with a lick at the slit. John pushed Sherlock’s head back down, fucking his mouth and John thrust his hips up. Louder now, “Again, aaah, I’m gonna come, that’s it, that’s it--” and Sherlock sucked. John stiffened and thrust one more time. He shouted, “AAaaaaah, fuck, Sherl—“ and he came as Sherlock swallowed, staring up into John’s eyes, black pupils crowding out the blue. He slid up and down, drawing out every drop and licking every last bit up. The sight of it made John dizzy. He finally pulled him off, panting and flinching at the overstimulation.
John stopped in the middle of the message and phoned. When Sherlock picked up, he said, “John, you know I prefer to text.”
John frowned and gave a disapproving, “Hmmm.” He looked up at him. “Again? Something wrong with my technique?”
“John, I assure you, I am here.” he cleared his throat again, “I…I never left the room. I swear it.”
Shit. Whenever John was in charge, Sherlock considered it a day free from odious tasks like waking up, going outside and the other mundane activities, to which the ordinary human was subject. And he was right. They had talked about it last night. John always prepared Sherlock for the coming day. He did not handle surprises well (unless it was a new case), which was why John was hoping to move him closer to his pliant, sated, obedient self before he had to break the news to him. Shit. Oh well. Best laid plans, into the breach and all that. John rolled off of him and propped his head up, leaning on his elbow.
John laughed and said, “Not your suffering, idiot. Having you eat 3 times a day. Sitting down to a meal with you. More or less.” He tried to hide a smile and failed. “And, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, despite the weekend of trauma, your mood has been much more stable than it is when you’re trying to function on a scrap of toast every 36 hours. You might want to consider a few experiments with those variables,” he said, nonchalantly, hoping he could interest Sherlock in a little transport research.
“Shut up. Not a sound. Don’t even think. Your mind palace is the safest place for you right now, Sherlock, so I suggest you go there and lock yourself in.”
Sherlock was lying on the sofa, his sore arse still keeping him on his belly, and stayed there through the putting away of groceries, the making of sandwiches and the boiling of the kettle. When he was finished, John called, “Oy. Lunch.” He called twice more, then walked to the sofa and gave him a swat.
the cheeks of his arse, John squeezed and pulled them apart gently, then pressed them back together. Sherlock shifted and squirmed, feeling the indignity of being opened fuel his desire. He wanted John, wanted to show himself, display himself to the man that loved every last little bit of him, even the parts he once thought were filthy.
Sherlock took off on his thesis once again. John congratulated himself on his bedside manner with an internal smirk. As the heat of Sherlock’s skin leached the coolness from the cloth, he refreshed it from the basin and kept on until he judged that it was at least a few degrees cooler than before. He was treating the damage as a burn and didn’t want the gel to trap any heat that could interfere with the healing. He laid a whispery kiss on each cheek and resisted the temptation to cup them in his hands.
Sherlock smiled to himself and John reached out a hand from behind the shower curtain and gave him a pinch on his bum. Sherlock twisted away from the fingers, crying “Ow! Must you?” John stepped out of the shower and dried himself from head to foot with a towel. “Sometimes, you leave me no choice, Sherlock. And sometimes I think you like it.” He reached out and slid his fingers feather-light across Sherlock’s tender skin, feeling him skitter his hips away in fear that John might pinch him again, then move back to increase the pressure. It was a move remarkably similar to that of the virtual Sherlock’s and John smiled congratulating himself that his fantasy approached film verite.
Still whiny, he said, “What time is it? There’s a pub, 8 blocks down. We can probably catch one there.”
Sherlock was now facing front and John addressed him. “I’m going to let go of you now, IF you promise not to make a run for it.”
“No reason to. Didn’t care what anybody thought of me before. Other people’s opinions were irrelevant.”
“No, leave it on,” John ordered him. Sherlock obeyed and looked over his shoulder at him. He tilted up his chin and lay himself slowly over the spread-out jacket, head turning to the side on his crossed arms. John took another look toward the street and then moved on him, sweeping the coat to one side, over Sherlock’s hip. With one arm he grabbed him around the waist, using the other to rub the bit of skin on the inside of his thighs that was left exposed by the leather of the chaps. The back of his hand nudged up against Sherlock’s bollocks and he spread his legs wider, hoping to give John more access.
“Over my lap is not a good place for you to be smart, idiot.” John let loose with three sharp slaps in a row, and said sardonically, “There, now we’re even.”
“Exactly my point! You know nothing about one of my dearest pastimes, you don’t know any of the people I have--some type of social interaction with, not even what they look like.” He glanced back at John disapprovingly.
John untangled himself from the sheets and gracelessly managed to find the floor with his feet. He was feeling very warm suddenly and stripped off his shirt, leaving it on the floor. Sherlock made a clicking noise and said chidingly, “Not very tidy, John.” He was rolling his neck and shoulders now.
Sherlock finally met John’s gaze. He somehow looked very small. A fist gripped John’s heart but he tried not to let it show. “You know no one is trying to debase you. That’s exactly what Molly was afraid of. So listen.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Oh. Right. Of course. Of course. I’ve learned my lesson. But maybe we should take photos anyway, just to remind me,” he said innocently. Sherlock found the idea of his sore arse very erotic. Not at the time of the actual soreness of the arse, but later it could be quite intriguing: remembering the sexual tension surrounding the event, knowing it was John who’d made it sore, that no one else would see this part of him, of them, that it didn’t always have to hurt quite so much... He locked eyes with John for a few fraught seconds.
John frowned and said, “’Fraid so. Worst ever. Should we start taking photos so you can compare data?” He was joking, but Sherlock perked up a bit at the thought. John gave him a frustrated look and said, “No, idiot, you’re supposed to say, ‘Not necessary, Captain, this will be the last time I ever need a thrashing because I’m going to be on my best behavior from now on. I’ve learned my lesson.’”
Sherlock ignored him. When they entered the library, Mycroft took one of three seats next to a window and he and John sat down. Sherlock declined, but John wasn’t sure if it was because of his arse or for strategic advantage. This was Mycroft’s home field and Sherlock would want to be able to move around or make a quick getaway if necessary. In any case, John sat back to watch the match. Sherlock pressed forward quickly. He held his hand out to John who passed the letter to him and he passed it to Mycroft whose face now displayed an expression rarely seen there: confusion. He stared uncomprehendingly at Sherlock, then at John, who pointed back at Sherlock, who once again attempted to disguise his anxiety with exasperation by shifting and rolling his eyes. If it were possible to shout while signing, he did.
He pulled his fingers out and Sherlock whined to be so empty. John chastised him. “Uh-uh. You said you would be patient. That doesn’t sound patient.”
Sherlock still marveled that he, he, could bring John to the edge. That his attention could take his breath away. “Mmm. It’s been a while, you know. I want to be sure you’re really ready. I wouldn’t want you to wind up with a sore arse or anything.” He let go and gave John’s ass a swat, and then a pinch. John jerked away at the sensation and Sherlock’s finger popped out. “Oh no! We’ll have to start again!”
“And, most pertinent to the current dilemma facing us, what did we determine to be the causal factor in the failures?”
John took his hand and squeezed gently, then let go. “Listen.” He undid the button on his trousers quickly knowing the sound would be negligible, then slowly, slowly, drew down the zipper on his flies. He saw Sherlock’s tongue poke out and a little breathlessly he said, “Trousers. Those are the…flies…on your…” His lips tightened and he sucked them inside his mouth. “Trousers.” John bent down and whispered in his ear, “Good boy.”
John smiled fondly at him from behind his back. “How much longer here? Mrs Hudson will be wanting dinner soon.”
Raul walked over greet John but he had to wait while the man stared at Sherlock unbelievingly. Coming back to himself, he grinned back at him and said, “You wanker.”
It's time for reconciliation. John makes Sherlock hand-deliver all his letters of apology, which is far more difficult than enduring physical torture, but better for the soul.
Sherlock watched him just as intently, sighing in pleasure as his bottoms revealed him to be just as hard as he was. He catalogued his John: compact figure, well-defined muscles of his thighs, gold and silver hair on his chest…
Sherlock looked up at him again and said in a dejected voice, “Once again, John, you see, but you do not observe. You cannot give me a reprieve. As much as I am desperate to avoid more…” he hesitated over the embarrassing word again, swallowing, “…spanking, you have to proceed as planned.”
“Come on back to the bedroom. I want to do some maintenance on you. It’ll be easier if you’re lying flat.” Sherlock allowed himself to be pulled into the bedroom and laid down on the duvet. He rested his hands on his folded arms. “You can lower your pants for me.”
He squeezed a generous amount of gel onto each round, pink, pillowy globe. With a feather-light touch he spread the gel out to the edges of the discolored skin, while Sherlock took deep breaths and made whining noises. When John had finished admiring the color, he replaced the cloth and said, “I’m going to massage around it now. If we can increase the blood flow, it’ll speed the healing and reduce the swelling.”
John grabbed him around the waist and kissed the hollow of his throat. He opened another of his shirt buttons and stroked his chest, making sure to run the pad of his index finger over Sherlock’s right nipple. “Do you trust me?”
He intertwined his fingers with Sherlock’s and Sherlock was twitching and trembling, like a piece of paper curling up in a flame. John ground himself down on top of him, trying to put out the fire, trying to drive down through him to the other side, just in case it was possible. Sherlock was doing his best pushing up against him on the other side. The friction between them finally drove John to pull away. “I can’t… I don’t want to finish yet, Sherlock. I wanna see you.”
“No, no, Angelo, not that kind of sick, just a little…sore. Too much painting,” he said indicating the coveralls.
John recognized this strategy as well. Sherlock had an atomic clock in his head and was fully capable of judging when his time would be up within five seconds, keeping his mind occupied with anything other than the fact that he was standing in a corner with a naked, red bum like a naughty child. John wanted him focused on the reason he was standing there. “Not your concern. I want you thinking about the last four days and what you’ll do differently in the future.”
John looked at Sherlock as he headed down the stairs and asked, “Were you expecting something?” He ignored him, which John deciphered as “No.”
There was a period of silence that John was not pleased with and he brought the cane down, lower yet again, getting closer to the sensitive skin over Sherlock’s sit spots, without him having answered. He was clearly unprepared and let out a yelp that ruined his attempts at stoicism. “Ow-ow-ow-ow-he-he worries about me?”
Having had enough warm and fuzzy, Mickey blustered on. “Come sit ringside, watch your boy dance when he’s finished his warm-up.” He dragged up two battered metal chairs to the middle of the side of the ring opposite what would be Sherlock’s corner, where Jack had been working. They sat down together. Following the sound of the speed bag, he found Sherlock intensely focused, punching in a quick rhythm. John watched his fists flying, smoothly and gracefully and thought once again of ballet. The sight was riveting and John felt soothed and excited simultaneously.
“As a side note, have you ever wondered how much that costs, Sherlock? Scrambling special op units, helicopters? And how much it costs Mycroft personally, with his staff? Of course not…” He felt silly having brought it up.
Sherlock got up reluctantly and John said, “Go and shower, then corner time. To put you in the right headspace.” Sherlock’s shoulders sagged and John felt a little sympathy, but reminded himself that Sherlock’s mindset was far more important than anything his body might be experiencing. He gave him a shove and said, “Quit stalling.”
John fretted about him for quarter of an hour, then luxuriated in the quiet and stillness of the flat, reading a trashy spy novel that Sherlock hadn’t ruined for him yet, and then taking a bath without anyone at all barging in and demanding attention. He ended the bath according to some internal clock that alerted him that Sherlock would be arriving shortly, insisting that he didn’t need any overprotective doctors cleaning up this rather serious scratch that might scar or worrying over that bruised rib, that you never could tell, might be broken. Why the stupid genius couldn’t just ask for what he wanted was something they were still working on.
Sherlock lifted his fingertips to his temples, and then waved his hands around his head, grimacing in pain. “Augh. It’s… It…It makes me feel so…small. Childish. And stupid.”
“Stupid?” John was confused, but teased anyway. “But we all know you’re the second most brilliant person in the world.”
John unscrewed the top of the jar and took a hefty scoop of the cooling gel onto his fingers. He dropped a dollop on one cheek and started to spread what remained onto the other. Sherlock jerked his head around from the pillow at the first touch and looked over his shoulder to give John a reproachful look.
“That I’d gone back, because she’s seen me…” He mumbled something that John couldn’t make out. A series of quick, sharp blows, all at the rising crest and alternated on each side. He lowered his pitch and said, “Speak up Sherlock. You ought to be ashamed of your behavior, but you need to say it out loud.” John kept the up the barrage, lighter than before but steady now, with no relief.
Sherlock took two steps back and quickly said, “You know, it’s just that it’s his job and… he gets paid by the massage and he can really use the money and the tip I usually give him. It won’t take long, I promise.”
Lestrade gave John a wink and John nodded. He checked his watch again. “Right. That’s sorted then,” and walked around behind the chair. Sherlock had taken the first file from the stack and was flipping through the pages. A couple of words jumped out from the page as John looked over his shoulder: 70-year-old woman, assault, ligature marks. He shook his head to clear it and then grabbed Sherlock’s chin, tilting his head up so he could kiss his forehead. Sherlock’s eyes stayed fixed on the page in front of him until John tightened his grip around his throat and said, “Oi.” Sherlock frowned and lifted his eyes. “Behave. Or else.” Sherlock grunted. John planted another kiss and then left for the easy part of his day.
John shook his head with a little smile. “I should have known you’d outsmart me.” He allowed Sherlock a moment of smugness, then took him down a peg again. “But the letter has to be delivered before Monday. As in, by Sunday night.” Sherlock deflated again. John raised his eyebrows and waited expectantly.
As soon as the door closed behind them, John took hold of Sherlock, dragged him around the corner of the building and pushed him up against the wall. He had a dangerous smile on his face. “What were you playing at, Sherlock? Trying to fire me up. Letting everybody put their hands on you, flashing your bits for them? Letting them touch you?”
“Would yours? Honestly, Sherlock, would your life be easier without Mycroft saving your arse, your life, when you really need it? Would you be here at all?”
John gave as good as he got. “Hmm.” But he smiled wickedly as he removed the petri dish of tarantula bits from the crisper and binned it.
Sherlock shook his head and said, “You still don’t understand, or more likely I don’t know how to explain it properly.” He scratched his head, then came to a decision. “It might be easier for you to understand if it comes from someone on the other side. May I use your phone?” John tilted his head. Phones were off limits during grounding. “I just have to send a text—I’ll show it to you.”
With a deep breath, John tried to relax his shoulders and rumbled, “Let’s see that it doesn’t. I’m hungry, remember?” He gave him the look Sherlock imagined a bear would give upon being poked.
A more typical expression returned to Mycroft’s face: he scowled. John scrubbed his eyes and wondered if the two of them could have a screaming match in complete silence.
John saw Sherlock swipe quickly at his eyes and knew he was reaching his breakthrough point. He was having a little trouble catching his breath and the balls of his feet were bouncing up and down off the floor.
John lifted his eyebrows and said, “If you can’t think of anything, I can just keep on—” and he stuck out his tongue like he was trying to catch a falling snowflake.
John laughed at him again. “Let’s worry about what to call them later. We’re not going home until you figure out why it’s so hard for you to talk about what makes you so twitchy about discussing your punishments.”
Sherlock sneered. “You should have pressed for settlement with all of them, for breach of contract. Their stipulations were based on the ‘satisfactory response of client to intervention.’" He waved his hand airily. “If you said the right thing to your ‘counselor’, they increased your level of privilege. By the end, I had talked my way out by eight weeks. You were blue with rage the last time, Mycroft.” Sherlock looked delighted.
