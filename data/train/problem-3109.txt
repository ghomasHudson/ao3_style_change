“Hello, sweetheart,” comes the reply, just as low and gruff.
Day Three: Rainbows
"Did you make breakfast?" The deep voice gently says, rising up in admiration at the end.
Dean took a page from Cas' book and learned to work the ground. They've spent the last few months with the same morning routine: go outside together after Dean supplies Cas with enough coffee to get him out of bed, and Cas sluggishly puts on clothes, gives Dean a peck on the cheek, and then grumbles his way into the day.
Taking a deep breath, Dean says, "so I guess that wasn't my mind who I just confessed to?" A nervous chuckle escapes his lips.
The glare off the knife is blinding and when the gleam subsides, a needle emerges and starts to stitch the skin together.
“Men!” she exclaims. “Good thing I can live without them.”
"He's God! He can eat anything he wants!" Dean mockingly exclaims. He puts a hand up next to his mouth and loudly whispers to Jack, " I left you some on the top shelf."
No, Cas wants to smile at many things, lately, and he thinks about things he didn’t used to, things he probably shouldn’t, and all of it has to do with Dean.
The thing is, he wasn’t totally lying to Jo.
He’s not alone in his bed.
Dean lies there in the dark, Cas breathing softly against him, and wonders.
“I see. And Castiel, do you feel like Dean treats you the same as he treats Sam?”
before?”
“Somehow I doubt you told him that, but ew.”
Rachel turns back to her textbook with a huff.
Then he reaches up, catching Cas’s chin and gently guiding his face fully into view.
But he thinks he’s lied to Claire enough.
He doesn’t think twice. He shifts back a little, grabbing Dean’s hands, and uses his leverage to shove Dean onto his back.
“Really, though — what brand is it?” He pauses. “It’s just — if I ever get to visit the store again, I’d like to buy this kind.”
“Cas! I’m so glad you made it, Dean was really worried you wouldn’t come.”
about it.
Cas just squints at him, and if Dean had to attach words to that expression, his best bet would be ‘you’re being an idiot, Dean.’
“But I thought we decided I shouldn’t have lied.”
and how all his cool t-shirts manage to be a little too big and yet do nothing to disguise those crazy hips, and also how everything he’s ever heard about Cas’s, uh, extracurriculars, suggests that if for some reason Cas
“I’m not a fucking hedgehog—”
“Alright. Is it time to leave?”
“A letter?” He blinks. “For — me?”
And then Cas feels his hands, smoothing over his back, up toward his shoulders, down across his biceps, and a moment later, Dean’s chest presses against it as he leans forward, the line of his body practically tracing Cas’s, solid and warm as it blankets him.
“Fine,” he sighs. “We got into it over his lesbian porn.”
“Oh. Yes, please.” Cas nods firmly, a smile tugging at his mouth, just as a drop of water tumbles from his hair to his upper lip. Dean turns away from the sight, telling him he’ll leave them by the door, and when he knocks on his return to let Cas know they’re there, he hears a happy hum from inside.
Has Dean
Reassured, Cas sits back a little, searching Dean’s face for an answer.
“No, I’m full.”
!” she shouts, and Crowley sets down his chalice.
. You, me, Sam - we’re just spectators tomorrow, keep the attention off Jack, Rowena and Adam long enough for… I don’t know.”
“I know. And if we make it through all of this we’re gonna figure that out.” Dean says it like a promise, and maybe that is as close as they can get to anything right now, with Dean still on a razor edge of uncertainty about everything in his life. “You should sleep too, right?” When Castiel nods hesitantly, Dean says, “Turn out the light, shut the door, and come here.”
Dean’s thrown a little bit because he wasn’t so much taking a break as losing all track of time passing, but sure, if that’s what you want to call it.
die trying. That’s fine too.
Castiel shrugs. “It takes...energy to maintain my clothes and my vess..my body. Not much. Usually it’s almost instinctive, background. But I exhausted enough of my strength that this was much easier. You don’t mind?” He doesn’t add that he couldn’t have done it with grace if he’d wanted to. There wasn’t even enough left for that tonight.
“No,” he swallows hard against the lump in his throat and closes his eyes, “it was the Empty. It took out Billie too. She had us, and Cas knew the Empty was the only thing that could stop her.”
“Retired doesn’t mean out of the loop. We’re still mostly in touch with the Mexico hunter community, but New Mexico has some weird shit and people pass through. There have been quite the rumors about the Winchesters over the last few years. Is all that true?”
Who somehow never saw what was right in front of him. Not that Cas did either.  And now Dean’s the one who has to live with it. It is tragically,
He stands at the rift with Cas at his back, and then steps through, hoping that there’s daylight on the other side.
Dean just wishes he had a better idea of how the fuck to do that.
Cas quirks a smile, but there’s no humor in it. “My grace.” He closes his eyes, briefly, and when he opens them again, there’s fire there. “It’s like an amputation,” he says, fiercely.
Dean breathes out harshly; that’s where he was afraid this was going, but his body still goes hot and shocky. The anger wants to rise, but he pushes it down and breathes through it; at its core is the screaming fear he tries to never let out. Purgatory, the Mark, this. That’s three times he’s nearly lost Cas in two days. The hits keep coming. “The Winchester special. Jesus, you really are one of us,” he says. “That was over a year ago.”
- stomach the idea of Cas going back there alone.
“It’s okay,” Dean finally says. It’s not, and Cas knows that, but it’s where they are. “We’ll figure it out,” Dean promises. And he knows he can’t promise that because he
Jack keeps asking him if he needs anything anytime they’re in the room together, which isn’t often. Rowena keeps bringing him tea that smells like ass and tastes worse, but does help the pain. Eileen keeps sneaking him comfort food. Sam keeps taking
He pours two glasses of whiskey. When he looks up, Cas is eyeing him warily, but he reaches out and takes one of the glasses, easing down onto the side of the bed facing Dean. He’s not making any sudden movements, like he’s afraid Dean will startle. It’s a little insulting. It’s also fair.
Cas is studying Dean, intently, like he’s willing him to understand; he put a subtle emphasis on the word ‘you’ and squeezed Dean’s hands just that little bit tighter. And through the fear and the racing of his heart, and yes, the anger, there and percolating, Dean is picking up what Cas is putting down. He’s saying
“No, and he’s not answering. Neither is Eileen.”
“That was eight years ago, Dean.”
“No,” Dean says, and he doesn’t correct the pronouns, but he’s thinking about Nick. Dean had been so fragile at the time, and Nick had been an offer of everything he wanted.
decompose eventually. We collide with place, which
They stare at each other for another few minutes before Cas says, “You’re dead on your feet. You have to sleep,” but he doesn’t make a move to get up or untangle himself from Dean. Dean doesn’t remember the last time he was this tired, but he still doesn’t want to be alone, or let Cas out of his sight.
“We already did that, Cas,” Charlie patiently replies. “We are doing a dexterity check. You’re second.”
Cas makes his way back to his seat next to Dean. Still grinning, Dean leans over and plants a kiss on Cas' cheek.
“As could I, Tweetie-Pie, as could I!” Rowena responds.
“You’ll want to avoid the bottom shelf,” Dean says.
As Cas watches these two shows crossover and the characters interact, Cas finds himself looking over at Dean again. Cas thinks about how closely both of these shows are mirrored in Cas and Dean’s situation: Cas, the out-of-time angel who doesn’t quite fit into society but as he spent more time on Earth, learning and growing from humans, he found that the Winchesters and their extended found family have accepted him into the fold. Dean, the man ruled by overwhelming emotions and a need to save others even through the violence that is required of him to achieve this.
"Yes, I meant it," he says, and he can't look at Cas, he can't look at him when he's about to be rejected. "And I understand if that makes you feel uncomfortable. I know you don't feel the same, you can't, so if you want to leave that's fine. Just make sure you say bye to Sam."
Cas knows when an important part is coming because Dean will drag his eyes from the screen to make sure Cas is looking. Oftentimes, Dean will raise his eyebrows in surprise at finding Cas staring at him instead of the screen. He smiles softly and gently touches his fingers to turn Cas’ cheek. Cas lets him, leaning into the slight pressure.
"Oh, come on, Cas! You looked hot in that hat!"
“I haven’t met him yet,” Dean replies. “But I’m working the night shift tomorrow.”
"Do adults dress up when they hand out candy?" Cas asks.
When he enters the bedroom, Cas is still asleep, he's hugging Dean's pillow in the human's absence. Dean stands there and smiles, feeling like the luckiest man in the world. He takes in the sight of Cas' relaxed body, mostly hidden by the bounds of blankets keeping him snug, a ray of sun has peeked through the blinds and seeked out the man's face, making his skin seemingly glow from the inside, just like when he was an angel.
“Halloween is more than just children getting candy and adults dressing up in scandalous versions of normal jobs and getting drunk.
"Ok, Cas, so we fill up this bowl with candy, turn on the porch light, and then hand out the candy to children. They'll be wearing costumes and...," Dean pauses for embellishment, "I thought we could wear our cowboy hats from that case we had in Dodge City!"
In no easy feat, the knife cuts straight through bone, leaving the body shattered, broken.
“I know you’re not real, just what my dying brain conjured up in my last moments, but I need to tell you. I’ve kept it hidden for so long, from you, from Sammy, from myself. But you are so important to me, Cas. And I know you don’t feel the same way, you can’t feel the same way, but I am so into you. I need you. And not just need you to help us fight evil but I need you, need you. My life feels lonely and empty without you.” Dean chokes out the last words, feels blood in his mouth and his eyesight darkens around the edges. He knows this is it and he reaches out to touch the imaginary Cas’ face. He waits for the reaper to take him away.
“Cas, you’re the one. You’ve always been the one”
"Nope, I got something even better."
Dean responds by stepping forward, lifting Cas' chin, and kissing the end of his nose. The kiss moves to his mouth and deepens into a make out session that is interrupted by the first doorbell ring of the day.
Cas just nods and when Dean goes silent as he remembers the time when Sam and he tried to stop a seal from breaking during the first apocalypse to stop Samhain, and how they failed, Cas kisses the frowns from his face.
But this body language is different and Dean’s heart sinks as recognition reverberates through his body.
“I have died numerous times, Jack. And each time I have been brought back. This last one was on me. I chose it. I chose to save Dean. To save you. To save Sam. I have chosen to embrace my free will.”
The warmth and musk of Dean’s skin and the leather of his jacket against his neck is all Cas can smell. Their bodies pressed together at the front, the soft press at the back of the neck as Dean made soft circles in Cas’ hair, Dean’s heartbeat so steady and welcoming, and the softness of a kiss on his head is all Cas can feel. He reaches around and feels the top of Dean’s jeans.
"You can look at Cas' true nature, both of you can," he says through a mouthful of cereal.
They spend the night cuddling on the couch watching David Yeager slasher films. Cas still doesn't understand why watching people get killed is something Dean likes so much and when he questions Dean as they take a break to make hot chocolate cause Dean says fall isn't complete without it, Dean simply states, "I like movies where I know the bad guy is going to lose."
Cas loves watching Dean watch television and movies.
“Shoo, little darling!” Rowena says softly, a flash of purple in her eyes.
A glow starts radiating out of Cas again and Dean looks up marveled at the blue coming out of Cas' eyes and the slight glow of his skin. The widest smile Dean has ever seen on Cas' face has taken over.
Oh no, Dean thinks. I’m in trouble.
The words twist like a knife in the wound, cutting tendons, tearing muscles from bones.
As he looks deeper into Castiel’s eyes, shining impossibly bright, Dean’s smile spreads into a goofy grin. He knows his life is about to change.
It smells wonderful.
"This one would be a good one, Cas, it's long and has this flat side, which would be perfect for carving. Oh, oh, oh, what about this one? It's super round and would be perfect for a wide grin. What do you think? You get to choose first," he says, speaking so fast the words trip out of his mouth.
Dean scoffs and looks at Cas for help but he just shrugs and smiles, winking at Claire, who bursts out laughing. Her laughter becomes infectious and soon all three beings around the table are bent over, faces red, seeking oxygen, happy.
"Howdy partner," Dean flirts, "I heard about this handsome cowboy with a deep voice and deep set blue eyes. That wouldn't be you, would it?"
Unsurprisingly, Dean has already eaten an entire pizza by himself, a funnel cake, and a packet of half-eaten peanut M&Ms currently sits in front of him. Cas even joined in, eating several peanut butter and jelly - not jam- sandwiches.
Cas, sensing this, or maybe the lack of a coffee cup in his hand, opens his eyes and blinks slowly till his eyes focus on Dean.
Suptober2021
Cas thinks about how he gained a human family, learned to feel and identify emotions that he wasn’t even supposed to have. How he learned that love - in all of its various forms - has changed him - only for the better. The faithless man falling for an angel who fell for the faithless man. Them finding their faith in each other and their family. Sounds like compelling television. But their story wasn’t television, it was real, it was right here, Dean was right next to him, stuffing his face with popcorn and turning to Cas to show off his trademark shit-eating grin even with his mouth full.
"Yes, I have felt it for some time." Cas says. "But the feeling always eluded me. It took me a while to sort out what it meant. But now I know it's love. I love you"
Suptober21
"Jack, you know you're not supposed to have any sugary cereal," Sam grumbles.
"What do they look like?" Sam asks, turning his attention back to Cas after giving the stink eye to Dean.
"That's my man," he says affectionately, his body vibrating with pride. Cas blushes, and even that color looks amazing on him.
“And I said, I said to the wee lad, you really are a bastard, aren’t you?”
Dean feels his face flush as blood rushes in two directions at once. Hopefully it’s dark enough for the man to not notice.
The four humans and one angel around the table smile at each other and stand to clink their glasses.
“That deserves another round of shots.” Rowena says.
Cas then throws himself at Dean, kissing him like there is nothing else that matters, running his hands through his hair, and pressing their bodies together till there is no space between them. And Dean cherishes these moments. He cherishes them even more on the mornings when instead of Cas regretfully pulling away and them working their respective gardens, Cas pushes Dean back inside to properly greet him.
Tonight’s selection is a weird but somehow perfect choice in Cas’ opinion. It is a crossover between the show Bones and Sleepy Hollow. Cas and Dean have been going through the whole series of both. At first, Dean said it was to help Cas with investigating cases but as Cas watched he saw so much more under the surface.
Cas squints his eyes and stares at Dean who just keeps smirking at him. When Cas adds a side head cock with his confusion, Dean's face breaks out into a wide grin, the corners of his eyes crinkling. He winks at Cas, clicks his tongue, and points to the pizza box.
"Are you going to tell me or surprise me?" He asks.
Cas smiles and continues, “Jack, I can’t live in nostalgia, I have to live in the present day, this moment. Do you remember what else I said when you asked what was the point of being a cosmic being if everyone you care about leaves?”
Day Eight: Leather and Lace
“Jack,” Cas says, “I hope you are not regretting saving me from the Empty.”
Suptober 2021
Day Ten: Crossover
He sees a look of shock and confusion on their faces. But now that he said it the words come tumbling out.
"I have," Dean says smugly, teasing his younger brother in a way only siblings can.
He raises his hand and pushes it between their bodies, pressing against Dean’s chest. Dean’s heartbeat is elevated but as time goes by it slows down.
Dean grins at Cas. He turns his head first to Jack, who's still eating the cereal, unimpressed, and then he turns to Sam. Sam's mouth is slack jaw, his eyes huge and round, his face aglow with all the colors of Cas' form reflecting. Dean sees his brother's face grow harsh, every line and shadow etched in a red tint, then smoothed out in yellow, then blue, giving an ethereal glow.
Suptober 21
He won't let Cas touch or care for the pumpkins he has growing in the backyard, claiming it's because Cas has enough going on with his own garden but it is actually because Dean wants to do this part by himself - Cas should only experience the fun parts of the day.
Suptober2021
He rips his eyes from the light at the open door to Cas face, which is still producing its own small light.
The sounds stop for a second and Cas knows that Dean is ready for the next step. Cas sighs and is just about to force his eyes open and push himself off the side of the counter where he’s leaning when a new smell invades his nostrils.
“Get out of here! No men allowed!” Eileen playfully signs to him.
"No."
Dean's stomach squeezes again as the smell of rotten flesh, chemicals, and animal feces combine with the rust from the still bleeding break. Dean bends over and after the acidic bile of his stomach vacates its home, he dry heaves, tears stinging his eyes.
suptober2021
The slight graze on his face moves to the back of his neck and lazily into his hair. His clothes press into his skin and send shivers down his spine. Goosebumps rise on his arms as his whole front feels pressure as his body is flush from hip through chest with another.
"Enough," Sam mutters, "no one's gonna take him away from you."
The faint glow in Cas' eyes goes out. His body no longer has a soft light under the skin. Dean drops his eyes away, embarrassed.
Cas leans up and brushes his lips against Dean’s, not yet making it a kiss.
“Where is Belphegor?” Dean asks, taking in Cas’ body language. It is turned inward, not the stoic, stock-still style Cas usually projects. As his time with Cas has grown, Dean’s noticed that Cas has taken on more human traits, tossing keys as he walks, sitting a bit more loungy when he's low on angel juice. He’s even noticed Cas mirroring his own body language, folding his arms or covering his face when irritated.
The table bursts out laughing again, Eileen is even rolling on the floor, gasping for breath from laughing so hard. The bunker has never witnessed such happiness as this moment and it soaks it in and reverberates it back out. This home that has seen so much evil, death, destruction, and tragedy, is full of love and laughter and the beings in it are at peace.
“And are you okay with being human?”
Sam throws his hands up in surrender but keeps moving to the refrigerator. He opens it, takes out a six-pack of beer and some food, slowly turns and holds them up in lieu of an explanation. He gives his puppy dog stare to the three women watching his every move.
"It is about sitting with friends and family outside around a bonfire. Laughing while you roast marshmallows to make smores. Swapping scary stories in the dark, the flickering firelight creating dancing shadows that enhance the creepy atmosphere.
“Jack, I get to spend more time with you, with Dean, with Sam, with the people I love. And yes, my time will be shortened again, but it’s worth it. Just being with the people I love is enough.”
Castiel reaches his hand out. Dean swallows hard and not taking his eyes off the set of blue in front of him, he clasps the man’s hand. A sudden spark of warmth shoots through Dean’s body, causing the blush to deepen. Castiel moves his other hand over both of theirs and smiles. His hands are as warm as his eyes and smile.
Everything reverses. The blood becomes liquid, the bones fuse into solid marrow.
Dean continues, "only I can call him breathtaking." He leans over and gives Cas a proper kiss on the mouth.
"Huh," Dean responds through a mouthful of pizza. "I didn't realize you had such a sentimental soft side, kid."
“Hello, Dean,” he says gruffly against Dean’s lips.
"Apple cider. Drink it after you finish your coffee, I would tell you before, but I rather like where my head is," he says with a shit-eating grin. Cas just glares, but his eyes suggest otherwise.
Dean keeps looking into those blue eyes, staring into his soul. He reads so much behind them, concern, stubbornness, and is that  … love? Well, he was dying, so why not tell the Cas his mind came up with the truth. Even if that Cas was accompanied by a Sam sporting the same face of concern. The two people he loves most in the world.
Both Sam and Dean turn to Cas, expectantly. He cocks his head at them and quirks his brow up.
"Shut up and stop hogging all the pizza old man," she responds, scowling at Dean, grabbing a slice of pie, and turning her attention back to Cas.
He stands grinning, that boyish charm radiating off of him, and takes Cas by the hand, dragging him to each one.
“Roll for initiative?” Cas asks.
"Thank you. He must really have thought we were the classic case of the Bechdel Test, huh?" Eileen adds.
Cas never really saw the point of the modern American Halloween tradition: children dressing up in costumes and going door to door asking strangers for candy? Seems ill-advised to him.
Dean just shrugs and gives a small smirk.
Claire stops, her facing turning red as she realizes how much she just said.
“He’s just quiet,” Sam tries to mediate.
Day Fourteen: Stardust
An awkward hush fills the room as everyone remembers what happened to Pamela when she spied on Cas' true form. The silence stretches, getting louder, filling the void with regret and bad memories.
"I mentioned that my true form is a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent the size of the Chrysler building," Cas starts to say.
Cas' eyes are shining and slowly his human vessel is gone and only a beam of rainbow light can be seen. It ripples like the surface of the water, drawing the eyes in.
He tells Claire and Dean that as they make their way back to the kitchen table, just-delivered pizza in hand. After a rather startled look, Claire takes a deep breath, leans her head in to make sure Cas is looking, and lets him have it.
“You did not! Rowena!,” Charlie blurts out in between spurts of laughter.
Cas seems to sense the change in his demeanor, though, and shifts toward him, touching Dean on his forearm, just below where his sleeve is rolled to the elbow.  Cas’ hand is hot on his skin.
“Yeah, there’s no way I’m sleeping tonight either,” Dean says. Silence falls between them - Castiel can hear the generator and the beat of his own heart. It’s not an uncomfortable silence, but it’s a loaded one - cocked and waiting.
The portal comes into view, gaping like an open wound and bleeding harsh red light into the darkness. There’s a crowd of shadowy figures gathered around it, and Dean stops Castiel with a hand on his arm, just behind the tree line.
They lie there for a moment in the silence, and then Dean says, “I meant it. So there’s never any confusion, I need you to hear me - I want you here.”
“Cas,” Dean starts, and then stops because he doesn’t actually fucking know where to go from there.
“I’ve been thinking,” Cas says, “since what you said in Purgatory. There’s something else I need to tell you.”
Dean comes to a stop right in front of him, just past the edge of the portal, and Castiel has to step abruptly to the side to avoid colliding with him. His shoulder brushes against Dean’s when he passes and they both stiffen briefly.
“Hey.  Why are there baby hunters staking dummy vamps in the basement?”
Cas drops his head and lets out a scoffing laugh that sounds closer to a sob. “Never do that again,” he says, and Dean is reminded of standing over a human Cas, slumped in that desk chair, all those years ago. He’s reminded of sitting with Jack in the dark of the bunker a few months ago, waiting to see if Cas would wake up.
Dean lets out a wet laugh. “Yeah, no shit. Trust me, I get that now. Me either, and we’re both stupid. Come here.”  He tugs Castiel to his feet and back into his arms.  It’s not quite the desperation from their reunion in the Empty, but there’s something in it that’s fierce and possessive. This close Castiel can feel that Dean’s shaking a little too, a trembling that eases when Castiel runs his hand along the line of Dean’s spine.
Dean huffs a laugh and takes a sip of his beer. “Believe me. It is far from the weirdest part of the story.”
, and that palpable excitement is enough for Cas to relax enough and let it go.
The sky is clear. The sun is bright and doesn’t threaten to trigger the aching pain behind his eyes. Dean rolls down the window to breathe in the dust of the road. Sam keeps shooting glances at him out of the corner of his eye.
Dean cut a swathe through Purgatory before. Castiel had taken down every Leviathan that came for him, and that was before whatever destruction Naomi and the other angels wrought when they dragged him out. They’re both strategists; they should have known they were walking into an entire world that wanted revenge. That’s the worst part. But Chuck, and the immediacy of the need, it clouds everything.
Castiel has always been a flawed angel in that regard, and over the years, he's come to understand human emotions more directly. That's been an asset in helping him understand humanity (in general), his friends (specifically), and Dean Winchester (in particular).
Everything was so deceptively simple here the first time, back when he still thought penance was the same thing as atonement or forgiveness. In hindsight, it was a typically angelic failure to grasp nuance.
“Yeah,” Dean says, finally breaking his brother’s gaze and looking down.
them if they didn't try.
“Yes and no. I don’t mind the general experience of humanity. I like being able to appreciate the full flavor profile of burgers.” Dean huffs a weak laugh and Cas continues. “You know if I’d been in Jack’s place, or Rowena’s, or Michael’s, I’d have given it up, there wouldn’t have even been a question. And it created a loophole in the Empty Deal, so I’m grateful for that, but the way it happened, ripped from me like that. It still feels like a wound.”
“Billie wants to reap God.”
“All good?” Dean tries.
“No, it's okay. We’ll be fine.” Sam hesitates, and then - “I am going to take Jack, though. But you need to stay here, so that Cas will stay here.”
Cas narrows his eyes, searching, and Dean drops his gaze so they don’t end up in a staring contest he knows he can’t win.
Cas pushes his chair back and stands, brushing by Dean out of the library; as he passes, he drags his hand up Dean’s arm to his shoulder and squeezes. Dean feels the flicker of Cas’ grace spark and settle.
“Overrated? Are you sure you’re doing it right?” he asks, and winces a little the second it leaves his mouth. It’s supposed to be a joke, the way he’d tease Sam, but it comes out dismissive, and more than a little sleazy.
Dean is way too in his head for that to work, though, and at about hour two, he turns the music up loud enough to cut out all casual conversation and let the Rolling Stones carry them through. At hour four, he can’t take the pressure-cooker vibe of the car anymore and makes the executive decision to stop for lunch.
Rowena shrugs, and looks at him out of the corner of her eye. “Those who can’t do, teach,” she says, self-deprecating and sardonic.
“Yeah, ok.”
During the day, it was easy enough not to stop moving. He pushed himself to exhaustion, because that was the mission, but also because then when he had to sleep, he could pass out quickly and, with any luck, it would be dreamless. He pushed
The nurse shrugs. He looks as bewildered as Dean feels. “The doctor asked for you.”
Tomorrow they’ll do the next thing. Whatever that is - find Chuck, or let him find them.
“But…” Sam starts
don’t
Alone again, he drops his head back into his hands and cries.
Hunters are a gossipy lot. He knows the broad strokes of what everyone says about him and Cas. He’s known for years. People have said enough of it to his face. But he wonders, not for the first time, exactly how that plays out in the wider Winchester mythology. What do they say about him, in between talking about God and Lucifer and walking through worlds?
Dean doesn’t totally understand the rules, but gathers it has a component of poker, and a component of truth or dare, and teenagers will be teenagers, and living through near literal hell may just make them feel even more reckless and invincible.
Dean draws in a shaky breath, and deflates a little at whatever he sees on Castiel’s face before sinking back against the table and nodding as he passes a hand over his face. “Fine. I'll keep it to myself. For now.”
Not that it matters. They know he’s there.
“I’ve never seen it like this.” Cas hesitates. “Is it strange that everything feels more sacred now? I feel time passing like I never did before. There’s an urgency to it. And something precious in the transience. The ocean looks the same, but it feels bigger than me now, timeless when I’m not. Do all humans feel like this?”
“It’s okay, Dean,” Cas says. He shifts so that their fingers catch and he can curl his hand over Dean’s and squeeze. “I tried, in the beginning. To retain what I could. But I can’t, and that’s okay.”
And that’s where Sam and Jack find him, bent over the books on the library table, bottle of whiskey at his elbow (push through the pain, bury it deep, drink until his hands stop shaking).
“You know that’s not what I meant. It’s got to be weird without…” he gestures to indicate
“Human.”
“I always worry.”
Dean does get up off the floor, eventually. He’s not sure how long it takes, but eventually the ringing in his ears recedes and he pulls together enough of his shattered pieces to move again, to do whatever the next thing is, because if he thinks more than one step ahead, he won’t be able to do anything at all.
He finds Dean steps from a river.  It's a different one than where Dean found him all those years ago, but still. It makes Castiel wonder and worry, a little, about narrative and symmetry and the foundation of all of Dean’s fears.
That night Dean decides it’s movie night. They’ve done sci-fi. They’ve done cowboys.  They have not done slasher flicks from the 70’s and 80’s. Dean has fallen down on his pop culture education job. Luckily, Dean picked up a bunch at sale at the used CD/DVD/bookstore in town awhile back. Cas narrows his eyes, studying the back cover of
, which Dean is not going to do, but he has learned that it’s best to just make vague, noncommittal noises. (“TBI can make depression worse,” Sams says, like a random observation he’s sharing about the weather, and not something Dean has received and ignored several medical opinions about by this point. Dean wishes someone would take away
Dean doesn’t remember anything about a haunting in Virginia, but it may not have been one that originated with Sam. Eileen’s been working as much as she can, trying to keep busy.
Castiel looks down at Dean’s hand, clutching at the material of his trench coat, and then up at Dean’s face, desperate and open, and gives in to that desire to touch. He reaches out with his other hand to grab Dean’s other arm and reels him in until he can slide his hand up Dean’s shoulder and around the back of his neck, pulling him into a hug.  Dean stiffens for a moment in Castiel’s arms, and then relaxes, letting go of his grip on the trench coat and sliding his arm around Castiel’s waist.
. Maybe all of their cards aren’t on the table, but this is an acknowledgement that they both know what kind of hand the other is holding.
“Yeah, I know. But sirens get in your head and twist everything around, so you don’t even know what’s real, and…” Dean trails off and gives a wry laugh, no humor in it. “The kid’s had enough of that.”
“I’m alive. So, thank you.”
Dean squeezes his shoulder. “You’re not alone, Cas, never again.”
, and he’s not thinking about that tonight.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Ok, so I’ll be back in a week.” Maybe that’s exactly what he needs - Baby and the radio; long, hypnotic stretches of highway and a good adrenaline rush at the end of the line to jolt some sense of momentum back into him and clear out the restless buzzing under his skin.
, Cas. Hunting ghosts. Exploring battlefields. Playing third wheel to Sam and Eileen. He’s having fun. I think Sam’s the fun dad. I don’t know how to feel about that or how it happened, but I think that’s where we are.”
They’ll get their friends back, because they have to. Because this can’t be how all of this ends.
He doesn’t mind the easy hunts, really. They wrap up quickly, people are grateful, and he doesn’t have to think too hard about anything other than the investigation. Sam can pretend he’s sending them on cakewalks for Cas’s sake, while he gets his sealegs, and Dean can pretend Cas doesn’t call Sam to debrief on Dean’s mental state when he thinks Dean isn’t paying attention. Everything is fine.
“No,” Dean says, sharply. His eyes meet Castiel’s and there’s something wild there. “No,” he says more quietly. “I’m going to talk now. And yes, I do have to say something.” He swallows hard. “Apparently I have to say a lot.”
“Right.” Dean sighs, and passes a hand over his face.
“I am sorry,” Dean says, and it’s the best he can do here in the dark with the pain building behind his eyes and Cas staring at him, gaze heavy with everything they haven’t said.
“Sam’s back home. He’s a little more on the administrative side now. He got married.”
He’s surprised when the words come through clearly.
Cas is looking at him questioningly. The little cat has followed him into the house, crying shrilly at his heels for more pets. Jesse smiles at her indulgently. “I see you’ve met Llorona. We named her that because she makes that noise.” Llorona shrieks in response. “Cesar!” Jesse calls, “come look what the cat dragged in.”
like her either, and maybe that meant something too. Dean’s not sure coincidence even exists anymore. “You know why I didn’t even bother with you, right?” she hissed in a whisper, “People pining like you are? You’re no fun. It’s too much work to get close enough for the kiss. You don’t want anything but what you have, even when you’re miserable. You can’t even see anybody else.” She’d cast her eyes toward Cas and giggled.
But there’s still a tension between them, more now, that the siren came along to raise more questions. They’ve had things unsaid between them for years, maybe from the beginning; that’s not new. But Dean feels like something is
for that. They don’t have time for him to unpack even half of what Cas just dumped on him. He’s not sure what enough time to do that would even look like. So Dean takes a deep breath, shoves it all down with long nights of doubt and confessional prayers and all the rest of the Purgatory shit they never talked about, and makes a decision.
Dean remembers his gut tightening, the flush of fear and relief and anger and stupid
“Yeah. I meant what I said to Sam. If what Chuck showed him was bad enough that he didn’t think it was worth the risk, I trust that. I think...we just have to trust each other." And he knows that's maybe not the approach he would have taken last year, or even last week, but something shifted in Purgatory. They do have to trust each other, or they're not getting out of this. And he desperately, desperately wants there to be another way. "Listen," he says, "the Mark, I lived with it. Hell, I died with it.”
“Where are you going?  If you’re afraid…” Dean trails off, doesn’t say
They spend the next week in Rhinelander, resting and pumping Cas full of antibiotics. They move to a different motel with a kitchenette so they can eat something other than diner burgers and Dean can make sure Cas stays hydrated.
“Who?”
“Fallen angel, huh? That always seemed like the most far fetched part of the story. I thought my life was weird.”
He doesn’t say
Sirens are fucked up for a lot of reasons, but one of the big ones is motivation. They don’t feed.  It’s not about survival. They’re cruel and they just get bored. This one clocked them as hunters and was just having
“Haven’t we all,” Cas says, one eyebrow cocked, and there’s an opening, if Dean is willing to take it.
Dean starts when Cas knocks on the connecting door, and then pushes it open without waiting for an answer. If it was locked, it would probably be locked from the other side. Cas is down to his shirtsleeves, and he looks tired in the lamp light, older than he should, and Dean is struck, not for the first time, by how he seems to be aging right along with them.  He hasn’t been able to bring himself to ask about it.
, but he feels something after weeks of trying to drown it all. So there’s that.
(They’re staying at a nicer hotel than usual because Eileen wanted to. There’s this fancy coffee shop that has a tasting room - why would a coffee shop have a tasting room, Dean doesn’t ask - and Jack loves it. They burned another body and there are still apparitions, which means at least three ghosts. Jack is doing great. Seeing Eilleen is great. Sam is really, really happy to be there with her. Sam doesn’t say that last one, but Dean can tell. He may tell them to take another few days after the case wraps up. Stick Jack in a separate room for a night or two. Let him play tourist for awhile and explore Revolutionary War history and fancy coffee shops while Sam and Eileen catch up.)
because while those are both pertinent questions, they’re not really the point at this exact moment.
Sam goes to bed, and Dean knows he should too. He’s been awake for approaching forty-eight hours and he’s shaking with exhaustion and the adrenaline crash. The whiskey isn’t helping much either, but it soothes his still jangling nerves and slows the racing in his head.
Dean can’t sleep and he lies awake for hours, just watching the shadows on the walls of his bedroom, and telling himself they don’t look like anything.
Sirens are

to exhaustion, and Benny was undead twice over.
“It’s not like that. It’s a tricky case; she burned one body, but it hasn’t stopped. There’s more than one spirit, and it’s an old town with a lot of Revolutionary War history. She just needs another set of eyes on things.”
And no, it can’t be, but the reports of black eyes, people bleeding from their eyes and turning on their friends, the gruesomeness of the murders, the
Dean’s waiting for the catch.
“Sure, but these aren’t real monsters. And you know they’ll die at the end.”
Despite the lack of leads, they’re all in agreement that Chuck has to be the priority. Sam falls back into his role of hunter coordinator, handing off any cases he identifies to the others - Jody, Donna, Bobby, Eileen. He’s even got Charlie and Garth on call if needed. They’re all working the phones, and every other day one of them is pretending to be an FBI assistant director or a department director from the CDC. They have a network, and enough friends and allies that it’s handled. Dean feels a little guilty that they’re not out there in the day-to-day, even though it was at his insistence, but when he thinks about it, he is still a little stunned at the family they’ve built.  Ten years ago, he wouldn’t have thought such a thing would be possible. Ten years ago, even a home base felt like a pipe dream. It makes him even more determined not to let Chuck take it all down.
Dean sighs and drops down in the chair next to Cas, taking the last sip out of the whiskey glass sitting at Cas’s elbow before reaching for the decanter to refill it.
The pieces fall like dominoes, the boundaries of their history redrawing themselves against this new backdrop, all of Dean’s actions cast in the light of his self-doubt colliding with Castiel’s own self-loathing, and Castiel is stunned. This is a very human physiological reaction, he thinks, distantly, the way the blood has all rushed to his head, and he can’t feel his face or his hands. It’s shock maybe; it’s also clearly true happiness, but the flip side of the calm he felt before. He might shake out of his skin. He also can’t form words enough to respond.
They haven’t run into any Leviathan either, and that’s worrying.
Sam still doesn’t look happy. Eileen puts her hand on his forearm. “Things are quiet here,” she says. “Why don’t you go too? Might be a good break.” They share a Look. Dean hates being fucking
He follows it as well he can, but it’s faint, like static stuttering in and out. He tells himself that’s just because his grace is weaker, not because Dean is.
Cas held up a hand. “That was years ago, Dean. We’ve changed. I just have to figure out how to do it now.”
They haven’t run into werewolves or vampires or Djinn, and Castiel wonders if Dean’s reputation from the last time he was here lingers.
He’s impressed by this, though, the way Cesar and Jesse have built a new life from the raw materials of their old one. He wants to ask if they ever felt this unmoored and isn’t sure how.
“For what I said. Before. For putting it on you like that. It wasn’t fair. It was the only way, but still. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have done that if there had been another choice.”
She continues, “Mostly, I just called you back to really emphasize to both of you the importance of serious antibiotics if you’re going to be running around out in the woods. Hodags aren’t venomous, but their saliva’s chock full of some fun bacteria. Your friend’s lucky.  You get a bite right on a joint - I’ve seen people lose mobility. I’ve seen people lose
Castiel nods and turns away. He turns back once, at the base of the stairs and their eyes catch and hold. Dean gives him a hesitant smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.
Cas downs his drink in one swallow and eyes the glass thoughtfully when he sets it down. “Silver lining, though, I might be weak enough that drinking will actually do something.”
“Do you miss it?” Dean asks, and holds his breath. Maybe this is why they haven’t talked about it. He’s not sure he wants to know, but if Cas needs to talk, he’ll try.
When he comes back into the room in worn sweatpants and old t-shirt (he may be too old for grave digging, but he’s definitely too old to sleep in his jeans), Cas hasn’t moved, and God, Dean is tired and he

He feels like there’s some kind of gentle tether holding him here, next to Cas in comfortable but charged silence with their knees pressed together under the table. He’s afraid that any kind of sudden shift will break the moment, and he doesn’t want to be alone. They haven’t talked much since Purgatory; everything after that was utilitarian. Get the spell together, do the spell, whatever you do
So they don’t go back to the bunker. Sam is Displeased about this decision, but he sends them another file, and another after that, mostly keeping them to hauntings that are simple and straightforward, one of which ends up being a hoax. Sam swears he didn’t know and that it was worth checking out. Dean magnanimously doesn’t point out that that’s also what Sam said about hodags.
“You don’t know, do you?”  He asks, sounding fully stunned. “You actually don’t know.”
kissed
Cas glared. “
But now there’s nothing, and uncertainty crawls up his spine. Castiel watches Dean’s throat work as he swallows, then turns away to scan the trees.
It's sudden and impulsive, but not surprising. They decide that morning, standing in the kitchen over coffee, but Dean’s been waiting for it, or something like it. Sam was always the better of the two of them at envisioning a future.
.  What does that look like, five years from now, ten years from now. If they survive all of this, what does it mean for Cas to love him, for them to love each other?  He’s been terrified of that question for a long time, but he thinks he’s finally more scared of not answering it.
“Do you want to go back to the bunker?”
Castiel looks at Dean then - really looks at him, the tension in his face, the shadows under his eyes, the bottle of whiskey behind him on the counter, sans glass. None of it looks good.
Dean drops his head against Castiel's shoulder and lets himself be tugged to his feet.
“I’m fine,” Cas says. He looks down at his hands. “I just forgot back there. For a minute.”
eat him out, even without the issue of pandemics and a total lack of attraction to Cas, and he takes savage pleasure in imagining fantasy-Dean licking his lips and sliding his hands even lower, spreading Cas open and eagerly ducking his head down to press a hot, wet kiss to Cas’s hole.
“Uh. Sam went after him ‘bout ten minutes ago.”
“But — Meg — I’d like to have this conversation privately, if possible—”
Couldn’t stand to think about it — not that it stopped him — because he was so fucking jealous of every single person Cas picked over Dean.

idea what to say to that, but Cas sighs, continuing.
“How’d Clarence’s calculator end up with you, Deano?”
Then he hangs up and wonders why he bothered calling in the first place.
He tries to remind himself to be cautious, that there may exist a bedchamber that doesn’t really deserve the title, that they may still keep him in awful conditions — but Dean said it would be somewhere near his own.
“Peachy,” he says shortly. “How ‘bout you?”
Dean’s hand is warm, and holding it feels nice. Cas wonders, if he lied about his hands being cold, then maybe Dean wouldn’t make him let go.
“There was,” she counters bluntly, and sighs. “You’ll understand when Claire is older.”
This time, Dean presses down, dragging slowly, and Cas sucks in a breath when it slides
The cloth slides a little lower, and Cas presses against the back of the tub, heart racing.
“I didn’t have that. I never have. It’s always been – ‘Well, this is happening, and it’s nice. It feels good, let’s go with it.’”
Maybe it’s not such bad advice after all.
“Of course he wants to be here. The only thing stopping him is
(Maybe he should see if Pam can make a new one for Cas.)
“I’m not a dumbass, so I’ll be fine.”
Cas turns his face slightly, kissing Dean’s temple, tempted to try rocking his hips, to feel that tug at his opening again, Dean mysteriously locked inside.
“At whatever time such a person appeared,” Cas adds quickly, eyes straight ahead.
“You’re probably right. I’m getting very sleepy.”
His phone pings, and he pulls it out of the stiff zippered pocket on his jacket.
Dean drifts back upstairs, once Cas’s car has disappeared down the ramp toward the exit (and Dean’s pointedly ignored the smirk-y look the punk behind the glass at the valet station gives him), and he hovers by the entrance to the hotel’s ballroom, not quite sure what to do with himself. Honestly, he’s still back in the garage, Cas pressed up against him, warm and sweet and everything Dean had kind of got used to thinking he’d imagined.

stuff.”
He flattens his palm against Dean’s back as he pets over it more firmly, attempting to soothe, but if anything, Dean’s body tenses even further.
They all graduate, Crowley and Bela flying off to England to settle in, and Cas mostly hides in his house until summer ends and he can finally escape to school, to a place where hardly anyone knows him and there are no reminders of the horrible things he’s done.
But if they haven’t worked it out by the end of the week, she’s locking them in a closet together and yelling their feelings through the door.
“Uh. Yeah. Yeah, no, it — it took some persuading.”
Cas is silent for a moment, something strange in his eyes, and Dean smiles at him.
“Oh, hey, your shirt is inside out.”
“Do I, man? I’m not even sure. Of course,” he adds, calming a little. “I guess I’ll have to take your word for it, since you seem to be an expert on cats. Which pretty much proves my point.”
“I don’t know that that will happen.”
But then, maybe that’s only if the other person were

Dean swallows.
“Seriously, don’t worry about it, Cas.” He keeps moving toward the hallway, then calls over his shoulder, “You’ve got plenty of practice, after all.”
They’re all very lonely thoughts, and nothing more is said before Cas finally turns out the light and falls asleep.
“I — what?”
He draws back a little, away from Cas’s frantic kisses, though soft palms remain fixed to his cheeks.
“He’s like, imprinted on you, Dean. It’s weird as shit.”

Dean’s shock is nearly palpable, and Cas waits, stomach in his shoes.
He sighs.
Cas swallows.
“Good God, Anna, what are you doing up?”
“Who the fuck told you?”
The words dry up in his mouth.
Desperate not to think or feel anything about his fucked up situation with Dean, Cas threw his usual end-of-semester party at the apartment, committed to getting wasted in every sense of the word and forgetting about all of it, if only for the night.
“Mine or yours,” Dean demands, hands working up under Cas’s t-shirt, and Cas nearly responds with ‘backseat’ because it is literally

He had Cas get a glass and fill it a few times last night as practice, though by the third time, he sensed Cas growing impatient. Certainly, the dirty look he threw Dean every time he had to pause their show and visit the bathroom conveyed as much as it was meant to.
Not that anyone probably would have told him why Dean was behaving strangely.
He’s happy to find that the relaxed, pleasant mood follows them home, and though Cas is a little quiet during therapy, like he always is when they don’t have anything to fight about, he seems — happier. Dean’s not sure, and maybe it’s his imagination, but for the entire week, things are — really,
“That’s new,” he remarks.
“Really?”
He got so confused that he could not stop thinking about the thing that he saw, about this newfound knowledge of what Cas looked like when — when he — and then Dean started to slowly go out of his mind with jealousy over all the people that came over to smoke and drink and fuck, and it made him so tense and quiet that suddenly he and Cas were hardly hanging out at all and by the time December rolled around Dean felt like he was genuinely starting to lose his grip on himself and his whole reality.

“Cas. How plenty is plenty?”
“Turn the TV back on, Dean.” He hesitates. “And — may I please be the little spoon, next time?”
“Yeah,” Dean says faintly. “It, uh. It does mean intercourse.”
“Yes.” It’s frustrating, not knowing if Dean is all there with him, if Cas could be anyone, if Dean just pities him too much to say no.
But Cas

“Hmm. You think so?”
Dean is very quiet the rest of the day, but he doesn’t seem to be upset or avoiding Cas, the way he was at breakfast, and a part of Cas is a little hopeful that he’s considering Cas’s offer.
“Alright, then,” he says, neutral. “How about some insane butt blasting?”
Dean makes a face, at which George looks even more affronted, then quickly nods.
Dean doesn’t think Cas is capable of blushing, but if the lights were on, he’d check just to be sure, because Cas sounds almost miserable with embarrassment.
it was a fluke. Up to this point, they’ve leaned against car doors and bedroom walls, but they’ve never gotten remotely horizontal, and the only bare skin Cas’s hands have touched have been above the collarbone, if you don’t count arms, which he doesn’t. Cas has been diligent about this, and it hasn’t even been difficult; they usually just sit side by side and make out, and even if it’s not actually the most comfortable position for that and his neck tends to become a little sore by the end of it, it’s still
All shit that doesn’t mean anything to kids.
“I think, if someone can care for me that way — someone like Dean, even — then it should be very easy for someone to care for you. Because you’re also perfect.” He hesitates. “We might spend a long time in places where people tell us we’re nothing, but — it’s clear to me, after meeting Dean, after meeting all of you — that that doesn’t mean they’re right.”
“I don’t know,” he finally says. “It was just — different.”
“Oh — uh, hey. Good morning,” he says, smile awkward, but eyes bright. There’s a weird energy about him, and Claire’s not really sure what it is until they get to the kitchen and find Valencia in her nightshirt, sitting on the counter with a cup of coffee and humming while she works on a crossword.
Cas stays put, waiting at the door while Dean gets into Baby and backs out onto the street, and as Dean drives away—
Dean is quiet, almost sullen as he picks at his sandwich, and Cas worries, for a moment, that he might refuse to acknowledge it at all.
Dean’s shoulders drop.
“Thank you,” he mutters stiffly, sitting up. She offers him the teacup, first, and he stares at it for a moment, resentful. Tea is for colds or anxious moods, first and foremost, and after that, it’s for evenings, when they’ve finished in the garden and eaten dinner and for some reason, Dean still stays.
“Dude,” he coughs. “You — shit, you should have told me.”
“Aw, gee, Castiel. You better get him outta here, Dean, before you gotta worry about competition,” he teases, and Dean hefts Cas forward somewhat ungently, gritting his teeth.
“Do you think he’d be willing to marry me?”
"Yeah. Maybe.”
“No. Not at all.”
this very day, should the occasion call for it, this great unknown that’s suddenly been presented to him is . . .
“Perhaps briefly.” Cas pauses. “But — it was understandable, to be hurt. To lash out. I think you would have come around, though.”
Cas frowns at him, color in his cheeks, lips red and swollen from Dean’s kisses and hair hopelessly mussed from the pillows behind him, and Dean doesn’t bother fighting a grin at the sight.
it’s laughable compared to now.
“I found Dean’s soulmate.”
“Uh.”
“Okay. I’ll do that. Feel better, man.”
Next to him, Cas’s fork froze, and he looked up with wide eyes.
After this many months, they must be used to his absence, but still — it’s very nice to hear.
“I thought her name was Isabela.”
“He did something he shouldn’t, shortly after he presented,” he finally answers, quiet. “The, um. The girl he meant to mate — she didn’t survive her punishment. And though he did, he — he’s suffered ever since.”
“No, Dean,” he interrupts gently, reaching out to put a hand over the one curled tight around the bedspread. “Because I

Only when his door opens again, sun streaming in bright, does he really wake, still groggy from the strange schedule.
Sam Looking at him, but there’s coffee to be drunk and it’s too early to deal with it, so he ignores it.
“I’m not sure I believe that.”
“Why the hell are you wearing a dress?”
Cas spasms so hard his hand slips right off of himself.
Cas is looking a little red, but then, the streetlights have a distinctly orange cast, so maybe it’s just an illusion.
“Don’t — don’t thank me. I — if I’d known, I would have done something sooner.”
This thing Cas does the next couple of weeks? It feels a lot like
To the proof that this thing with Cas is totally and completely fucking with his head, because he’s been so caught up in it, he actually managed to forget.
Two hours in he was sitting, drunk off his ass on the just-vacated sofa, when Cas came and plopped down next to him.
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Of course not. Good night, Dean. Be there at one tomorrow.”
“Good. Then let’s just — be happy together. Sound good?”
As soon as he says it, Dean wants to smack himself, because
She looks up at the question, studying him.
And that’s a hard one; Dean’s an adult and he’s figured out, by now, that the way he loves people sometimes includes trying to interfere under the basis that he thinks he knows what’s best for them, and that it’s his job to make that happen — but in the end, he also knows he has to let them be.

“O-okay. Yeah.”
“Oh, dear,” he sighs, and Susan nods.

“Don’t worry,” he whispers. “Even if I’m makin’ shady phone calls, don’t worry. I — I love you.”
Of course it spilled. It wasn’t zipped all the way, and it had been shoved into the footwell as one of the first casualties of Dean’s lewd crusade.

at least – and, well . . . you catch more spectacular orgasms with honey, as they say.
Of course, after that, the good mood is gone, dead and salted and burned on a pyre of resentment and fury, and within a week, Dean breaks.
“Then it’s just like I promised. None others. Not ever.” He crowds back in, eyes dark. “Just you.”
“Well, the answer is ‘no
Cas is certainly one of those, and Pam smiles, bright and smug, like she can read his mind. (He’s pretty sure she can; her and Missouri both.)
“Are you going to bite me again, Dean?”
He’s so
if you want, I really don’t care how that happens, but it kinda needs to, and then, uh. Well, I’m probably gonna kiss you some more, sorry—" Cas perks up, baffled as to why Dean would be
she’d gotten another one, and sabotaging his treasured friendship someone else seems like overkill for payback, doesn’t it?
Naturally, things don’t go according to plan.
- Echos.
Unexpectedly, Dean looks horrified.
Anyway, Dean figures Cas is due for another bath, sitting around the apartment or not, and to his relief, Cas seems to know what he’s talking about this time. It’s a little awkward to turn around from filling the tub to find Cas stripping down to his boxers, and it’s even more awkward to explain that Cas should remove said boxers and wash the, uh,
Understandably, Pamela’s not impressed.
And yeah, okay, Dean can’t argue with that, but —
Unfortunately, some of them jeer.
Dean shudders.
“You sound like you’ve decided.”
He seethes quietly behind the post as Kevin advances to a cartwheel, like he’s a goddamn eight-year-old, moving right into a handstand, and his stupid friends applaud enthusiastically.
wouldn’t let anything happen,” he mutters, and she snorts.
Cas is quiet as they walk over, although the way he keeps glancing around them suggests he’s preoccupied with making sure they’re not caught. Dean feels a little bad, but not enough to suggest he just go back to his own room and stop by tomorrow.
” he sighs when they stop for breath, and Dean presses their cheeks together, relishing the feel of Cas’s skin on his, of the scent of him underneath that of their shared coconut body wash.
“I expect to be there for a friend.”
“I like going into town,” he admits. “It’s interesting. But I don’t want to make you go.”
You can’t just comment on it!”
But then, maybe if Sam’s gonna get all judgey and lecture him anyway, Dean might as well earn it.
Cas tilts his head, squinting, and then reaches up, massaging his own fingers through his hair in a clear pantomime of shampooing.
“Uh. Cas. Is everything okay?” Anna asks, and Cas blinks, taking a deep breath.
Cas wonders if he’s allowed to yank Dean closer, take the whole, delicious weight of him and wrap his legs around Dean like he’s a watermelon in need of crushing so he has no choice but to stay in bed making out with Cas all day.
which pair he wants Dean in and where to find them.
“Anyway,” he continues. “When he took me to town, Dean said — he said, even if I didn’t need something now, I might want to need it someday. I believe it’s — an act of faith. That the future may give you the things you want, after all.”
him. It used to be like a thorough, if occasionally suspicious, study, a general pursuit of understanding, but now it seems more like Dean’s after something specific.
“W-what?”
Dean startles on his way into the library, figuring he’d fumble around a computer for a few minutes looking up potential hits. It’d probably be easier to just power through whatever insane results google spat back at him, but he doesn’t want anyone at the station catching him, and if he does it at home, he doesn’t want to risk tipping Cas off.
Although, there are some downsides. By the time Dean sets aside the towel and presses his fingers to Cas’s scalp, lightly massaging, Cas is about ready to fall asleep.
“The audits nothing, you asshole. So somebody goes around a few times a year and just
Bobby let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head.
“You’ve got work today, right?”
Meg finds him when he enters the lunch room and throws an arm around him with an amused smirk.
“Jerk. Let’s go find somewhere to stay.”
yeah, but it’s fine.”
She said she was expecting ‘sonnets’ or ‘something dirty.’”
“Dean!”
“Dean,” she says, a note of steel in her tone. “What did you do?”
Which — besides being his best friend, Cas is his
“It’s private. I tried to friend request him, but nothing.” Sam sighs. “With our luck, he’s like Dean.”
have a preference for them?
” Cas mutters, and then shifts a little closer, subtly tilting his head toward Dean before tapping the spacebar with his foot. “Now be quiet.”
Cas gives him an oddly calculating look, one that’s unexpectedly-but-unsurprisingly enticing, even in Dean’s overtaxed, aggressively butt-blasted state.
talk, he wouldn’t be, right now.
“Sure,” Cas says calmly, heart flailing wildly in his chest, and picks up a fruit chew. “I’m looking forward to it.”
“Fuck,” Dean chokes out, reaching for him, but Cas beats him to it, palms slipping greedily over Dean’s warm, solid flesh, deeply satisfying, but leaving him wanting nonetheless. He lets go reluctantly, knocking aside Dean’s desperate hands to undo his trouser ties, and after a beat, Dean moves to help him, harsh breaths mingling in the air between them as their hands brush together and by some collaborative miracle, send the trousers sliding down Dean’s legs.
” He throws the next piece in his mouth. “Uh mah gov. Uh-
Cas starts looking him in the eye when he says good-morning again, and sometimes they even make polite, stilted conversation over meals; Cas still lets Dean make him those meals, still lets Dean drive him places, still lets Dean fix him tea and read all his baby books, when he’s done with them, and once — just once — Cas even falls asleep on his shoulder during after-dinner television, like he used to.
“You just let me know, Cas.”
“I — maybe? When you
“Dean—”
Of course, it doesn’t matter, because in the next moment, Cas is rolling them, bracing a palm against Dean’s chest with a smile as his ass settles right there in the vee of Dean’s hips.
“What year are you?”
“What?”
my family,” he tries to explain, a little desperate, though really, it’s too late. The boxes are already packed, already in the car, and Cas signed a mortgage without him.
Anna then points out that he went to the opposite extreme after that, referencing his apparent lack of interest in dating/sex, and though Cas protests that he still did occasionally, he agrees that since it failed as an escape and there was nothing to prove with it, he mostly did just stop.
and he also remembers a distinct stab of envy when Jimmy explained.
“They can’t promise, but they believe she’ll be alright.”
“How about I do both?” he offers, voice low and rough in that way, the way that always has heat pooling at the base of Cas’s spine, has his heart tripping inside his chest. “C’mere, Cas.”
“The boy you helped,” Dean clarifies, though he doesn’t look up. “On the way here.”
Cas nods.
Dean smirks.

He slumps, nodding slowly.
“I’m not sure what it was, but — just, the whole thing is
“It — it’s not against the rules,” he says quickly, and the other brow goes up.
“Sam and I are fine.”
Layla laughs and returns the embrace.
They wait in silence, and Cas wishes they’d gone mini-golfing again instead.
But then a pair of arms reaches up and circles him, tentative and barely there until they gradually tighten around him. Dean waits patiently, letting Cas feel it out, and after a minute, Cas shifts a little, turning his face back into Dean’s neck, breath warm where he sighs against it.
Claire settles down quickly enough, but her blue eyes stay open, blinking sleepily at him, and Dean makes himself comfortable in the rocking chair, holding her a little longer just in case.

“Um, well, I guess I thought — you know, since Dad was gonna be gone and since Jess wanted me to come over, you guys would probably do
Cas doesn’t understand.
“Yes. We hung out in high school. Anyway, we’re just going to his house to watch Harry Potter, like we used to.”
“Of course not, Inias,” she says, smoothing her hair. “I’m just saying
technically a promise—
In the end, Dean’s pretty sure Cas doesn’t end up getting whatever it is he was looking for, with the dress.
“An erection, Cas,” Dean mutters into his hair, and suddenly several overheard conversations make a little more sense.
Of course, he gets no response.
They have a surprisingly pleasant conversation over the remainder of breakfast, and Cas feels a little disappointed when Dean glances at the clock and gets up.
Then she coughs, clasping her hands together in her lap.
“It’s beautiful, too. I spend hours sitting on the beach.” Daphne has her colored pencils today, and while she talks, she draws him one of her favorite views, sketching close-ups of seashells along the side of the page. “I think — why don’t you visit, Castiel? I could show you all the things we’ve talked about.”
for years.”
She smirks, opening her mouth —
“Okay, then. Later, buddy,” he says, reaching for the door.
Cas squints, exasperation clear.
Cas hesitates, then looks reluctantly curious.

A carriage is stopped in the circle drive, and in front of it—
“I’m not trying—” he protests, and she rolls her eyes.
“Better?” Dean whispers, the word tickling against the back of Cas’s neck, and Cas shivers.
Dean stares hard at the road ahead, unable to bring himself to respond.
“No, but it’s
“Sorry. Castiel.”
Dean?” Cas insists, clearly impatient, but he’s gonna have to sit tight, because if Dean didn’t know any better, he’d swear Cas just said -
“Nothing,” she says quickly. “Anyway — do you have any idea, at all, about what you’re going to say?”
“You — you’re joking.”

Still, it’s worth it.
Cas smiles slightly.

“Until you ruin it on purpose. I, on the other hand, see things through once I commit to them.”
Which he probably is. Even from thirty yards, Dean can see his squinty, disgruntled I’m-going-to-talk-to-you-about-this face, and he doesn’t kid himself that he can put it off.
“Yeah. Just, uh. You should know — objectively speaking, I mean, if you do this with a partner, somewhere down the road — they’re gonna think you’re really hot like this.”
Cas hums.
doesn’t even really get what you did to him. And if you think for a moment you’re helping him by just — passively going along with this? You’re lying to yourself.”
Cas smiles.
He trails off, tilting his head, eyes huge in his face where they’re still pinning Dean to the spot.
“I knew I was right to tell you to come back home.”
“Well, they’re nothing special—" Cas argues halfheartedly, and Dean’s hold tightens, pushing him down a little.
“Wow, Cas. You’re high as a fuckin’ kite right now, aren’t you?”
“Ah, I forgot that about you. Flannel on the inside, shall we say?”
Dean abruptly quiets, looking down, and Cas tilts his head, fascinated by the discomfort in his expression.
“I don’t know, and as far as she needed to know, I did explain.” Cas slides the tray onto the bed. “Are we going to talk now?”
She lifts a brow.
Sam is a wreck, and it is fucking
There’s an impatient huff.

“Okay. So — it’s just — you know. Letting people know you . . . care. And, uh. That you think well of them. Believe in ‘em. Making sure they know . . . I don’t know. The good stuff you think about them. You know?”
And then her stomach growls.
“They — they’ll probably revisit it, later. But I’ll think of something,” Dean adds hastily. “I don’t — obviously, I don’t want to marry Bela.”
too, and Dean’s afraid Cas is still waiting on him, even if he should know better.
“Look — ideally, you wouldn’t have had to talk about that until you had a better idea of how the council was going to react, but — he knows how you feel, now. And he wants to be with you, too, right?
“I can’t.”
Cas tilts his head.
“I was sulking in the library after we broke up. ‘S’where he first found me, you know. I guess I was hoping he’d come looking. Anyway, he didn’t, and I had to pretend to be busy, so I found myself with a copy of Dickinson in my hands and, uh. It wasn’t half-bad.”
Dean gives him a speculative look, running a hand down his side.
“Yes, and I had no idea what I was doing. That’s not a — an
“Hm?” he mumbles, lips just barely moving, and Dean clears his throat, trying for as much nonchalance as he can manage.
much time talking to all these people (and addressing groups of them in the parlor, as he’s overheard a few nights). It’s made her conversation far less straightforward.
Cas swallows.
Jo hums.
“My point exa—"
“Can I talk to you, Dean?”
“That wasn’t his choice. And you have my letters. He was kind to me.”
“Yes, well, the last two months can attest to that.”
Dean can’t.
“I wasn’t suggesting you were.”
Dean may have kissed him first, but Cas is confident he does not feel all these things that Cas does. Every day, Cas marvels that they don’t just tear him apart; Dean, for all his bluster over Cas’s antics, remains remarkably intact, and he has ten times as many other things to pull at him.
“Aw, you’re just mad I won that debate.”
“I’m sure it’s all bluster, then,” Cas offers, probably meaning to be reassuring, but also clearly not understanding how crazy Ruby is.
And then she quickly shuffles to one side, freeing the heavy velvet curtain, before doing the same on the other.
“Dean’s got a flower crown?”

him again? What if Dean isn’t ready to try and produce an heir, but they lock him up with a noblewoman and force him to spend the unnatural rut with her? What if they forbid him from leaving until she’s birthed it?
Anna glances back to find her brother looking as unimpressed as she’s ever seen him.

issue to deal with.
– his stomach’s pulling tight and his toes are curling and the band on his boxers is keeping Dean perfectly on course, keeping him high and close and Cas is pushing up with his knees now, desperate to get him even closer, to feel it where he really wants it, to do whatever it takes to somehow finally
“Dean?”
Upstairs, he tells himself. As soon as they’re upstairs — Cas can look his fill and try to figure out Dean’s strange mood.
“Maybe. I’m glad you’re coming home with me, at any rate. It would have been a shame to return, and still not — for things to be different.”
Anyway, Dean’s feeling commensurately pissy himself, by the time the toilet flushes and Cas saunters defiantly out into the common area, and when Cas doesn’t even glance over to where Dean is perched pointedly on the sofa, instead going right for the kettle without so much as a disinterested grunt in greeting—
“You aren’t,” Bela assures him smoothly, and Gabe and Crowley both shake their heads.
“Take your time,” he says awkwardly, once Dean’s standing by the tub.
The Crowleys own
“I don’t know, man, she’s been here all week with no problems. You really think she’ll bother us?”
“Me, too. I wish you could be here all the time.”
“Then I sure as hell wouldn’t say no to being inside you.”
“Fuck off.”
His stomach lurches.
for you. Hell, when we’re finished, you’re gonna be wondering why you haven’t been at the bars every goddamn weekend looking for a face to ride.” Dean pauses. “Before quarantine, I mean.”
Dean freezes, swallowing.
Until you factor in Cas’s ginormous crush on Sam, of course, which Dean is definitely doing, now.
They both wait, Cas trying not to hold his breath or do anything that might reveal how completely full of it he is, and eventually Dean looks down and shrugs.
Pamela hesitates.
Bela studies her for a moment, then nods.
“What? No, I just — I — was — dumb joke.” Dean sounds frustrated, and Cas can feel his smile creeping back. It’s nice to know he’s missed. “Anyway, you’re right, I should — get back to it.”
No, he’s not sure

! I — this goddamn rut, it’s melting my brain, I know better, I should never have—“ He takes a deep breath, pressing his face into his hands. “You need to go, Cas.”
Sam confirms this before he has a chance.
“Whatever. Maybe you should’ve thought about
“Oh.” Cas nods, leaning into him a little more. “I look forward to it, then.”
Claire shoots her a disbelieving look.

“’Cause it’s got food in it.”
“Alright. That’s . . . good. I always wanted to be a knight, but even when I thought I would be an alpha, I had no expectations of — of power, or anything.”
but he couldn’t help it, was just so pent up and desperate and reeling from making Cas come, from getting a hand on him and watching him fall apart, and he thought as long as he didn’t do anything to
Dean shifts to his knees, straightening, and leans up to kiss him.
There’s a hum, and then carefully, Dean starts pushing inside.
Of course, as soon as Dean does, Sam always —
Sam shakes his head.
She’s quiet for a few seconds.

body cream, Dean.”
“That’s not it. Well, it is, but it isn’t. I’m not worried you won’t be committed to me, Castiel. I’m worried you won’t be happy.”
Cas’s hackles rise instantly, the voice and tone as obnoxious as it is familiar, and to his irritation, it continues.
Charlie’s eyes go big.

And then he deserves to find out how it feels when it all goes up in flames, and he’s left feeling broken and worthless and like he’s just stupid enough to have deserved it.
It takes him a while to drift off, keyed up as he is and painfully conscious of the person lying beside him (not to mention what ‘time with you before Claire gets home’ could

Dean bites his lip, refuses to make the obvious joke.
Dean’s glad it’s dark in here.
“I dunno. I just don’t feel good. It was too cold last night.” Ellen frowned, about to say something, but Dean wasn’t finished. “But Cas had my spare blanket.”
Dean nods slowly.
Lucy looks incredulous.
Cas smiles.
“I’ve had difficulties adjusting. Unlike An- unlike your original sacrifice, I had no expectations of this.”
For Cas, though — Dean just makes everything worse.
“I was caught off-guard. And then I – I didn’t have good leverage.”
Cas just wants it to last forever.
Cas shudders, giving him a heated look.
And if Lisa’s willing to give him that . . .
Cas just smiles.
“Oh, my god,” Claire mutters, making a face. “I’m gonna be sick.”
“You guys have been synced for a while.”

“I’m sorry I yelled. That wasn’t fair.” He hesitates. “I — I wasn’t angry with you, not really. That is, you can’t go wandering around town by yourself, for any reason, but — I was — I didn’t say anything I meant to.”
“Me, either,” Kevin agrees, nodding as he glances around. “That’s so cool. I didn’t know Mr. W was okay with that.”
“It’s too early for this,” he thinks he hears her mutter, and then she clears her throat. “What’s this about — being afraid of you?”
Bobby follows suit, and Naomi folds her arms.
“She loves sports cars, too, so you know.”
“He had to leave,” Cas sighs. “But — he’ll be back.”
He frowns at the man, puzzled.
Cas bites back a sob.
“I see. You invited me for coffee, but what you really meant was ‘pie.’”
“Because no one gives a damn about sheet corners!”
Cas has the guilty thought that watching Dean is, in some ways, a little more fun than practice, though it makes him long for the day Dean will face him in combat without holding back.
Dean perks up.
And then, after a moment:
Dean grimaces.
“No?” he said eventually, uncertain in a way that only made Dean feel worse, because Cas had his
He takes a moment to process it, every part of him taut and trembling, and then, with a shaky breath, he returns his hand to his penis.

Cas squints, though Dean swears his cheek presses a little harder into Dean’s palm, stubble a soft scratch against the skin.
stomach going back there with Cas.
Cas nods; when he looks at Dean his eyes are searching. “We will find another way.”
“I don’t know if I believe you,” Cas says, quietly. Dean squeezes his hand because it’s all he can do, and he knows that feeling too. Cas sits with him until he drifts off again.
The harm, of course, is that Castiel is a hypocrite.  He’s the one who taught Jack how much it’s acceptable to sacrifice for your family, after all, and Jack’s not above calling him on it. Not out of spite, but because he doesn’t know why he should keep Castiel’s secret if Castiel won’t keep his. Jack won't understand that parents sacrifice for their children, and it’s not supposed to work the other way around.
He takes another swig from his glass and watches the light from the lamp flicker in the frosted tumbler. So he is not unhappy and he is human and he is free - of Heaven and the Empty.  All of that is true. He is also lost and wary of the future. Humanity was a mixed bag the first time around.
Sam shrugs. “Yeah, I can wrap this up.  We’ll leave in the morning?”
“We’re idiots,” Dean says.
Castiel is trembling, dragged under by memories of lonely Purgatory nights and a year of unanswered prayers, when Dean’s voice in his head fades out after that. He presses one hand against a tree to steady himself, and focuses in on the longing pulling at him, clearer now and shining like a beacon.
There’s still so much unsaid between them. There are things he doesn’t know how to say, and there’s pain on both sides he doesn’t know how to heal. There have been times over the last month when Castiel has selfishly hated Chuck more for the wedge driven between himself and Dean than for any of the other horrors, and he knows there’s a tempest on the horizon, coming for them, ready or not. But he’ll take this in the eye of the storm.
, he means, which Cas knows because he rolls his eyes.
Dean just blinks at him. “But you don’t.”
“I know. I am too. And Cas did learn to hover overprotectively from the best - “
and knowing what that means. When I say angels feel differently, I mean nothing in a millenia has compared to the friendships I’ve formed in the last ten years on earth, and I have never felt about anyone or anything the way I feel about you. I’m not afraid I feel less than you do. I’m afraid I feel more.”
“Yeah,” Cas says, a little bitterly, looking down, to where their knees are still touching.
and everybody lives?  No way it’s that easy.
“Okay,” Cas says softly, eyeing Dean over the top of his coffee mug.
Dean takes one step backward, hands held up in surrender. “I wasn’t. But woah.”
“And?” Dean says.
This, then - this conversation and the tiptoeing around landmines it's going to require, is exactly why he’d planned to leave.  Call in the morning. Say...something. Try not to picture Dean’s face in the silence on the other end of the line.
“He’s a little overprotective right now. Jack’s feeling a little...I don’t want to say smothered, but maybe a little confined.”
about the implications of the spell, get to Sam. And now, in the silence, after nothing played out like he hoped it would and he’s a guiltily relieved about that more than anything, he doesn’t totally know what to say.
Cas takes a sip of his coffee and gazes out at the water. “I’ve seen the ocean in a million forms,” he says, quietly. “I remember when there was one continent and the water just spread out forever.”
Once he hears Dean head back to his room, Castiel goes to shower off the muck of Purgatory. There’s something about the scalding water and the physical act of scrubbing himself clean that’s grounding and feels like the only way to get the scent of blood off of his hands.
do you want, Cas?” he says, and he doesn’t mean for it to come out desperate, but Cas just stares.
“Okay. We both go. But I need you to listen to me when I say we stay together. Promise me. No separating. No splitting up to cover more ground. No leading Leviathans on a wild goose chase, do you hear me?”
. I love Sam and Jack too, of course. And Claire, and others, but can we please just talk about what we’re actually talking about?”
And Dean had time to sober up, and time to think, and time to decide that they can’t go on like this. They need an answer, whatever that answer is. Also, sobriety was not a good call, and liquid courage never hurt anyone, so he gets the whiskey, takes a shot, and goes to find Cas.
“I know. Did you ever go this long with
It’s a little over a seven hour drive from northern New Mexico back to the bunker. Jack spends the drive curled up against the door, looking out the window, and Cas is quiet too, casting concerned looks at Jack and periodically meeting Dean’s eyes in the rearview before looking away. Sam is in the best shape of all of them; he’s been gentle with Jack all morning, but also aggressively normal with Dean and Cas, well practiced at operating as a buffer.
“ I don’t really get what’s entertaining about watching serial killers slice up teenagers.”
The physicality of sense memory is such a human thing, but he’s struck all the same by the way that Purgatory smells like rot, and guilt, and sacrifice.
Maybe Dean does have a right to feel betrayed; he just doesn’t know why yet.
They get burgers on the way back to the motel, and Cas sits at the rickety table by the window picking at his while Dean claims first shower. He turns it up to scalding and stands under the spray a little longer than usual, hoping the stinging heat will ease some of the ache in his muscles, and only gets out when he does so there’s some hot water left for Cas. He can be considerate.
.” Cas stalks off down the hall, and Stevie and Dean duck back into the room to look for a hex bag.
“Hey,” Dean says, voice rough as he comes into the room.  He claps one hand on Castiel’s shoulder, initially strong and sure, but then lets it trail down his arm, as if reluctant to break the contact.
He’s not looking away now.  And Castiel doesn’t know how he missed so much.
Okay, Sam has always been pretty good at identifying Dean’s anxieties.
They’ve been moving slowly, in expanding circles, so they’re maybe an hour walk back, but they don’t get far.
.” Dean’s eyes meet his, searching, and Castiel looks back, steady and determined
Dean stops in a clearing, turning to dig a water bottle out of his duffle bag. They’re better prepared than they were last time. They have water, a few extra weapons, Borax, a flashlight. They’d needed more time to plan and strategize, but they hadn’t had it and had figured it didn't really matter. The Leviathan would come for them immediately, like always, and either they’d make it back in time or they wouldn’t. If they didn’t, they would have bigger problems than running out of batteries.
Sometimes the bunker feels small and claustrophobic, like he’s tripping over the others every time he enters a room, trapped underground with a bunch of uncivilized packrats who can’t even
Stevie sighs. “What does Hunter HQ say?”
At first his prayers were tactical, a recap of where he’d been and what he’d killed or seen evidence of, landmarks if he had them - anything to help Cas find him. Then they turned angry. By the time he fell in with Benny they were a pleading for any kind of sign.
“Can you come with me, please?”
They’re on the outskirts of Las Cruces, so it’s not the prettiest part of the state, flat and still hot, in the dying edges of summer, but at least it’s chile season and the food is good.
Sam hovers in the kitchen and asks if he’s feeling better, suspicious and concerned in a way that makes Dean itch. Dean should be asking him that; Sam’s the one who almost died, apparently, while Dean was off...well.
As predicted, Cas does not love the idea of Jack going off to hunt ghosts with Sam and Eileen, but he also clearly doesn’t want to be too visibly against it for fear of insinuating he doesn’t trust Sam to take care of Jack. He eyes Dean suspiciously when they tell him the plan, but Dean shrugs and shakes his head, trying to use wide eyes and a neutral expression to indicate his innocence.
unfair, but what else is new? And he owes this to Cas too, to be gentle with Jack in this moment.
for the Empty deal to come to light now, on top of everything. They can’t afford the distraction.
“Really? We can drag Dean over here and I’ll get a ride out of here in his arm. We’ll get this done however we need.”
Sam looks up, a little startled, and looking a little disappointed when he sees Dean’s face.  “What?”
Cas sits forward on the chair, looking at the wall. “Our lives are long. We see...so much. Being human myself, even briefly, made my emotions sharper, I think it made me understand better, but it didn’t change that. That time span has different implications.”
“Where?”
Patience and Alex come down by themselves to work with Rowena on harnessing Patience’s natural power and learning cures for supernatural afflictions that they don’t teach in medical school. They’re up all night in the garden on the full moon, and in the morning Dean finds them in the kitchen grinding herbs Rowena swears will speed the healing of any supernatural wound. She’s leaning against the counter sipping her tea and watching them with quiet pride over the rim of her mug.
They kiss for what could be minutes, what could be hours. It’s a slow, slow build, every touch almost
He masters navigating the kitchen on crutches, and throws himself into making dinner for whoever is in the bunker that day. Jack, Sam, Eileen, Cas, Dean, Rowena, and, apparently, Shawn actually live there, but there are usually at least four or five others passing through. Krissy swings by, and Other Charlie, who it still hurts a little to look at, and sometimes people he doesn’t even know, but he smiles and makes pancakes.
until around 3 am when he hears the heavy echo of the bunker door slam closed.
“You’re not very good at sitting on the sidelines.”
Jody, Donna, Claire, that witchy Shawn kid they liberated from Georgia, whoever else happens to be hanging around on any given day, they all hover around him, ready to pull out a chair or grab his arm if he’s the least bit unsteady.
He says, “What happened to Mom. What happened with Jack. We all saw it. I should have known. I think I did. It wasn’t your fault.”
. He’s just not sure what it is he’s supposed to do.
hurt. It’s embarrassing, which is another emotion angels aren’t really supposed to feel, and that has only made him angrier.
Well, that’s not news.
“Yes, asshole. I thought you
When Dean asks for another case, Sam sighs and sends them to Wisconsin on a wild hodag chase. When Dean points out that
They sit there in silence for a moment before Dean moves to the other side of the table to finish his own food, and Cas heads for the shower to wash off the cemetery grime.
“Me? No. Just the aftermath. I’ve seen a hunter, though. You’re not the first through here. For awhile my sister dated…” she cuts herself off, “You know what, it doesn’t matter. Not my first hunters, not my first hodag bite, not my first rodeo. Did you at least kill it?”
Cas’ eyes flash. “I remember.”
“I feel fine,” he says over dinner one night, rolling his shoulder as if to demonstrate the full range of movement. “We can move on.”
species,” Cas acknowledges with a nod of concession. “And it was fine. She was kind and it was enjoyable and I didn’t get stabbed afterward.” Dean flinches at that, but if Cas catches it, he doesn’t let on.
It’s quiet, in the aftermath.
“Fuck, Cas. What did we walk into?” Castiel doesn’t answer and Dean sighs. “There’s always something bigger and badder waiting for us. Awesome. I love being Purgatory’s most wanted.”
“Still. I didn’t think you wanted this.”
Dean just nods. “Yeah, okay.”
Out of words, Dean just nods.
Fine is not really the word Dean would use, but Cas is definitely more with it after Dean gets him patched up and to bed. He drops off quickly.  Once Dean is sure Cas is asleep and breathing easy, he goes out to scrub out the car, working in the light of the dashboard and the guttering street lamp as he wipes Cass’ blood off the upholstery, thinking
“Okay,” he says again. “It’s fine, Cas.  It just surprised me too; we just weren’t expecting it to go after you like that. At least we learned some valuable intel about siren venom.”
“Well, it’s not possession,” Cas says, and turns to get the server's attention for more coffee.
Dean winces, and Castiel looks away.
Cas raises one shoulder in a half-shrug. “A little better this morning. He’s been through worse than this, Dean.” And that stings, though Cas probably doesn’t mean for it to.
“Okay,” he says. “Okay. I’m tired. I’m drunk. I’m going to bed.” Then they can either pretend this didn’t happen or Dean can at least deal with it when he’s not so many beers in.
“That we know of,” Dean says.
The kids make Dean feel so old.
Sam does look up at him then, putting his pen down on the notebook and curling his fingers over the edge of it. “Did we stop?”
“It means I am not going vampire hunting with you.”
When they get to the room, Cas is standing next to the exam table in just a t-shirt, and Dean can see he’s bandaged from shoulder to elbow. The doctor is standing against the sink, making notes in a folder.
When he thought about it later, which he mostly didn’t, since it was easier to shove it down and bury it under years of equally traumatic baggage, those were the memories that would catch him off guard and leave him shaking in bed or reaching for the whiskey to feel some kind of warmth. It was the darkness, the cold, the loneliness like a physical ache that could still knock his legs out - the barbs that dug under his skin and only hurt worse once he was out and realized Sam hadn’t looked for him at all, that Cas had heard his prayers and
It’s so easy to get lost in this -  the slide of their mouths together, the press of Dean’s hand on his skin, lighting up his sense - it doesn’t feel raw anymore, but the intensity isn’t lessened, just shifted from pain to a pleasure that still almost aches. They end up shifting around so Castiel is standing between Dean’s legs as they kiss, Dean halfway to sitting on the table.
They end up in Castiel’s room. He’s never made much use of it, and he’s not sure now he’ll ever have cause to know. He won’t need it, not with the way Dean is pressed up against him, still murmuring promises into his skin.
“He surprised me; that’s all,” Cas continues, gently - too gently for the conversation they’re having, probably.
“It’s not…” he starts, and breaks off. Turmoil isn’t the word he’d use for it. He just feels tender, like his emotions are an exhausted muscle or a bruise that aches when he prods at it. “I’m fine.” He says, but that’s not quite right either, and Cas looks at him like he knows it. Dean takes another sip of his whiskey for something to with his hands and tries again. “I don’t know if any of us are okay. I’m a
Fucking plot twists.
Sam’s a smart kid.  He knows his brother, and his best friend, and Dean sees when he gets it, or something close to it, gets enough that Dean doesn’t have to
(He lies in bed until noon. He keeps a bottle of whiskey next to the bed).
“I know,” Cas says again. “Me too.” Dean doesn’t know if Cas means he’s sorry for what happened with Sam while Dean was gone, or for Mom or Jack, or if he, also, is just sorry that Dean’s such a fuckup.
And he knows the fear Sam and Cas are feeling, of course he does. He’s been on the other side of this hospital bed.
And that has to be good enough, doesn’t it?  All any of them have control over are the things they can choose.
, he’s keeping it together because he has to, because the only way out is through, until he meets Jack’s eyes, wide and shocky where Jack is hovering behind Sam’s chair.
Dean closed his eyes against the guilt, like a raised scar he could run his fingers across, and wished that wasn’t Cas’s takeaway.
“Are you okay?” That's not the right question.
.  We talked about it. He doesn’t feel like he can just pick and get a job or go to college, or whatever; if this gives him a purpose, I don’t…” he trails off, then adds, “We’re all just feeling our way through this, right?”
“I don’t need the sex talk,” Jack says. “I have the internet.”
Sam also thinks he should talk to Mia or
He wonders if this is how Dean felt in the dungeon, watching their history rewritten and illuminated. Only for him, that new possibility was immediately snuffed out. The thought makes him ache; there’s a little thread of guilt running through it, but that’s not important now. What’s important now is the time they have, here, together.
“You seemed pretty confident when you left.”
“Dean...he can’t control us. Maybe he can manipulate situations if he can… I don’t know. See us again. But if this was him, it still didn’t go how he wanted. Neither of us got infected. I’m assuming that was his play. I mean
Having your knee cap removed sucks. Post-concussion syndrome sucks more. The rest of the occupants of the bunker looking at him like he’s going to snap if they breathe on him wrong sucks the most.
“I just did,” Cas says, and kisses him.
“Yeah?” Dean says, just as softly, not to break the spell.
It’s just after 10 when Jesse says, “If I know how hunters operate, then what we’ve got here is more comfortable than whatever roach motel you’re holed up in. You guys are welcome to stay the night. We’ve got the room. I think only one guest bed is made up right now, but we can make up another, or…” he looks back and forth between them, questioning, and Dean guesses there’s one more part of the rumors they’re not sure of the truth of.
It’s also so much more than Dean deserves or can even quite process in this moment. He was so unprepared for this. He knew that, but he figured he was unprepared in the other direction. Dean opens his eyes and they just stare at each other, stunned, both breathing hard.
Dean knocks on the door and there’s a clattering from inside the house. He has his badge up, ready to go, but his normal spiel dies on his lips when he comes face-to-face with Jesse Cuevas.
“Of course,” Cas says, and Dean hears the
When Dean unlocks the car, Cas slings his duffle into the back seat and slides into the passenger side. “Sam says there’s a haunting in Montana?”
fine. Dean knows that too. This kind of thing is just part of the hunter life. Cas’s humanity may throw a new wrinkle in the mix, but they’ll both get used to that too. Even Rebecca (who has deigned to let them call her Rebecca) says everything is fine; there’s no damage to the joint, and Cas can go back to “whatever stupidity you all get up to” as soon as the antibiotics run their course.
“Dean,” Cas starts again, blinking through the shock. Dean shakes his head and lifts his hand to cup Castiel’s face and run one thumb over his cheek bone.
but then, look at where that got all of them, and there’s nothing there anyway. It’s like something has been extinguished in his chest. There’s that roaring in his ears again, like white noise threatening to drown out the conversation. Dean drops his eyes.
He is happy, of course. But Dean keeps shooting him these glances, heavy with guilt and sadness, despite the way he stuck by Castiel’s side, kept his hands on Castiel’s shoulder, his back, his elbow, like if they stopped touching for an instant, Castiel would disappear. Castiel understands that uncertainty, after everything; he knows that Dean needed that reassurance of his family together and whole. It still made him feel exposed, Dean’s hands on him like pressure on a raw nerve, Dean’s eyes stripping him bare.
are gone, and he’s been trying to figure out what to do with himself. He’s relieved and free and completely directionless and a little bit baffled that Sam can just...go on.
Dean comes first, gasping into the hollow of Cas’ throat. Then he gets one hand between them and it doesn’t take much before Cas is shaking against him.
“Which way?” Dean asks. Their eyes meet and hold when he turns his head. This is a truce, then, whatever he’s feeling about what Castiel admitted before they left the bunker.
Cas nods, and brings up with his other hand and reaching out for Dean, who takes it so that they’re holding both hands across the table, staring at each other. “Yes,” Cas says. “It didn’t want me then. It said it would wait until I was
“Okay?” Cas is looking at him again, wary.
Apparently, what Cas told the paramedics was as close to the truth as he could get. He and his husband are ghost hunters, they snuck into an abandoned building, Dean lost his balance and fell. He was a little defensive about the “my husband” lie, eyes flashing like he was daring Dean to question it, quick to specify that claiming to be immediate family was the only way they’d let him stay.
gesture toward Cas over his coffee and Cas rolls his eyes.
, and the nights didn’t get any better.
Dean had looked at him and said, with a hitch to his breath, “Cas,
“We’re asking a lot. Of Jack, and Rowena, and Michael.”
; it still sets him on edge that he feels like he doesn’t totally understand the extent of that. “I don’t think it would have changed anything.”
They have quite a few beers, and several helpings of Cesar’s enchiladas as the sun starts to sink over the horizon, stripping the sky in gold and orange. Turns out Jesse and Cesar have been running something of a hunter roadside hostel - not hunting themselves, but gathering and passing on information, leaving the lights on for anyone passing through. Apparently they met Bobby briefly a few years ago.
That’s how they end up working a case with Stevie in Savannah. Admittedly, the case is a weird one.
There are rumors of chupacabras wreaking havoc in southern New Mexico, so they head that way. It’s another “gimme” from Sam; chupacabras are pretty straightforward - fast, but not too big or bright, easy to find if you know what you’re looking for, and relatively easy to put down.
something Cas wants, some slice of human normalcy in all of this.
, then it feels disloyal, almost
“We’ll remember that,” Dean says, weakly.
He wakes up in a hospital bed, blinking against the brightness of the light until Sam comes waveringly into focus.
Dean draws in a shuddering breath, light-headed and stunned. He doesn’t know how to resond t that, so what comes out is, “Did you just compare me to original sin?”
It is a happy ending.  Chuck is not dead but neutralized through his connection with Amara and her newfound love of creation (it was Jack who got through to her, who helped her take control and reset the clock, bring them all back. It was Jack who saved it all, like Castiel always knew he would).
He’s so tired. Humanity is exhausting. He’d forgotten that, or repressed it. But now his eyes ache and his hands shake and the whiskey burns his throat going down. He thinks he understands now, the numbness Dean chases at the bottom of the bottle. That burn can calm his racing thoughts and slow the zinging of his nerves. It tempers, a little bit, the way he swears he can feel the blood flowing in his veins.
Dean lies awake that night listening to Cas’s breathing from the other bed, debating what’s better for him and for Cas. Do they go back? Selfishly, he wants to keep moving. The rock of a mattress notwithstanding, he’s slept better these last few nights than he has at the bunker lately, which is a little strange. He usually sleeps better at the bunker than anywhere. He’s gotten used to a routine and a familiar space, somewhere where he doesn’t have to sleep with a knife under the bed or the gun under the pillow, somewhere he can fall asleep without facing the door.
Cas looked at him out of the corner, of his eye, something unreadable on his face. “They all made a choice. Real choice, power freely given, without resentment or coercion, that’s the catch.” Then, more quietly, “We’ve all made sacrifices for the people we love, Dean.”
Cas just looks at him. “Do
Dean gets a washcloth to clean them both up, and then crawls back into the bed still naked. Cas pulls him against his chest.
Dean is unconscious and breathing, but shallowly. He’s right, the wound in his side is deep, and there’s a lot of blood. It makes Castiel's breath catch in his throat, and it soaks into the knees of his pants when he falls at Dean’s side with a choked out sob of fear.
There are bad days. There are days when the light slanting under his door from the hallway is too much, and the everyday noises of the bunker echo in his skull. He lies in the dark with an ice pack over his eyes because he needs the pressure, the numbing chill, the complete dark, to fight back the nausea from the pounding in his head.
“You think it’ll work?”
“Forgot?”
When Donatello called to ask what the fuck they’d done - why everything in his head and just gone
“That we know of,” Stevie agrees.
“You can’t get through the portal,” Castiel says. And Dick, who died on Earth, can’t, even if Castiel isn’t sure about some of the Leviathan who have been here since Purgatory was sealed.
Dean took a deep breath. There were moments like this sometimes, the two of them alone in the dark, in the quiet of the bunker when time seemed to stretch and catch, tension between them drawn taut.
, in the library in the middle of the night, pointedly not looking up from his book to where Dean is frozen in the doorway.

“Okay, you’re going to want just a fourth of a cup of the batter.  Scoop it on the griddle, and we’re going to flip it when we see the bubbles start to form in the top.” Jack smiles up at him, hopefully, and then holds the spatula ready, intently watching the stove. Dean’s reminded of the easy companionship of the day they want fishing. He loves this kid, and he’s a little afraid of him, and he still doesn’t know how to balance all of that, or quite what to say.
