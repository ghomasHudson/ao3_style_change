“Fuck sweetheart, way you feel wrapped around my dick right now, think I could fuck you all night and it still not be enough.” Tony flushed with the praise from Bucky and began to want to drive the other man as crazy as he felt. Tony began to squeeze his muscles down around the cock inside him making Barnes moan lose his rhythm. Bucky’s hips began to stutter quickening their pace slightly as he moaned out, “Oh fuck baby, I’m gonna come again already. You feel to fucking good... Ah hell, Uhhh....”
Even if it was true now, by the end of the week, Bucky would own Tony’s heart just as much as his owned his body.
. Even made me aware of a few I didn’t know I had like this one.” Tony Began rolling his ass, movements hidden beneath throw Bucky wrapped around his shoulders, and groaned not bothering to hide how good it felt. When Bucky pulled his own hips back before pushing down Tony’s shoulder ramming back in, Tony gasped, “Umm, Yeah, right there Bucky. Lot of… Uh, tension there, fuck… keep pushing, like that… Ahhh, yeah, feels really good….” Tony threw a devilish smirk to Steve saying, “You’re not careful, I may have to exclusively use Bucky’s hands from now on.”
Tony stared back into Bucky’s eyes roaming over him possessively as best he could. “Does it matter baby, does it matter that he can hear that I’m fucking wrecking you? That I’m breaking your ass in so good sugar, it’s jerking all over my dick,” Tony shuddered, eyes fluttering realizing his ass was twitching wildly, almost shaking with the movement, “Doesn’t matter does baby, because I fucking ruined you for anyone else. Stevie will never be able to satisfy you again, if he even could before. Ain’t that right Tony baby, unless you’re getting fucked within an inch of your life by a dick that can hit the back of your throat through your ass, you’ll never be able to cum. You know it, and I know it.”
Tony had been avoiding Bucky. He wasn’t lying to Steve, he really didn’t blame the man for what Hydra had him do, but Tony didn’t know if that would hold up once the soldier was in front of him. At night after Steve and Tony finished making love, Steve would give Tony updates on what was going on in the compound. It had come up that Bucky felt Tony blamed him for his parents’ death but Tony didn’t want to deal with it yet. He chose to evade the issue never realizing how much time had passed without meeting Steve’s best friend. Resolving to make it up to him, Tony determined he needed to make Bucky feel as comfortable as possible while he was here.
Bucky’s hand kept moving as he smirked down at Tony. “Other than the obvious, same thing I’ve been doing for the past two days, thinking about you.”
Using one arm to hold him to his chest, Bucky pushed Tony up so far he had to look down at Bucky’s face. His other arm reached down to point his leaking erection towards Tony as he lowered him back down on his cock. Tony had slapped both hands on his shoulders, gripping them tightly in surprise as Bucky had maneuvered him around so quickly. He slowly lowered Tony onto his dick, relishing in the tightness around him, watching Tony begin to shake his head and speak through a hooded lustful gaze.
Tony only lasted another 3 or 4 minutes, Bucky’s assault inside Tony drove him over the edge yelling, “Yes Bucky, Ah. God yes... I’m yours.” Tony felt like he’d been struck lightning as he came, feeling a shock wave through his entire body.  Exhausted at the impact of his release, Tony body became limp in Bucky’s arms.
Steve snorted out a laugh as he said, “Stick to your day job Stark, actin ain’t it. I met Sam in D.C. on that mission with Nat, he helped us out when we couldn’t call you guys in.”
These last few years had been great for Steve. He had his best friend and his boyfriend by his side, giving him a joy he hadn’t felt in years. As he made it to his room he sat the apple they’d received from Thor down on the dresser before he collapsed on the bed. Bucky had worked him over nearly the entire plane ride back. Even after all these years he would still feel guilty every time he was with Bucky, knowing he was lying to Tony about it. Steve just couldn’t help it, no matter how much he resolved not to Bucky seemed to always know exactly what to say to get his compliance. He was grateful when he saw the message from Tony saying he’d be in the lab all night just before they landed. Steve had already showered off the evidence before they arrived back home just in case, but didn’t want to face Tony after what he’d done yet again. He knew he’d have to tell Tony at some point; Steve hated having this secret or any secret from him.
Even with all this in mind, Steve wanted some time before this happened between his lovers again. He wanted to be able to coax these reactions from them before he’d feel comfortable with them continuing down this path. Tony was able to not only take Bucky’s entire dick in his ass but in his mouth as well. Steve wanted to be able to do that for his partner, wanted to make Bucky look at him with the admiration Steve saw on his face from the bathroom doorway.
Tony had been wary of seeing Bucky again, afraid the man might stir up the same feelings he did before in front of Steve. He had been stiff as a board at dinner but had begun to relax as time progressed and nothing happened.  He was even able to watch a movie with the two men, laughing at Bucky throwing popcorn at him and Steve until the latter switched it to something he enjoyed.
Steve opened his eyes to stare guiltily down at Tony before they rose to meet Bucky’s, “Well, if uh, neither one of you minds, maybe Bucky could take you until I’m ready to go again.”
Tony just shrugged as he snuggled closer into Steve’s chest, he’d deal with it later… Maybe. As his mind cleared, he ran through all the ways he could avoid the master spy twin couple for a few weeks. The band in Tony’s head began to quiet more and more as Steve finished feeding him the fruit and sausage he’d brought as well as the toast. By the time he placed the coffee cup in Tony’s hand, he was beginning to feel like a person again instead of a zombie.
Smiling brightly Steve beamed down at him. “I told you he’s fine Bucky. He really doesn’t blame you for what happened. I’m really excited for my two favorite people to meet.”
Breaking him from his thoughts, Steve smiled as he heard Tony challenge Bucky. Steve slapped a hand over his face and shook his head. Bucky was going to shatter Tony to pieces, but Steve knew from experience he’d enjoy every second of it.
He gave Nat a look of resentment. Who did she think she was, his mother? Huffing out a condescending laugh he said, “I think you’re mistaking me for Clint because, last time I checked, I’m not your Sub he is. I don’t have to kiss your ass or do what you say. I don’t have a keeper and can do whatever the fuck I want. If I say, I’m going to the bar to get another drink, there isn’t fuck all you can do about it. Now we got that cleared up, this is me saying, ‘I’m going to the bar to get another drink’ and you not doing shit about it.” As he got up to leave he threw Thor a slightly less murdering expression. “Can take care of myself big guy, know exactly how much I can take before I pass out.”
“No problem Buck, just let me know,” Tony heard from behind Bucky as Steve began punching at the bag again.
But of course, no one wants someone they have to convince to have sex with them all the time. Of course Steve wanted a boyfriend that would just look at him and not be able to keep from climbing him like a tree. All of which Steve now got in spades with Bucky. The distance between Tony and Steve happened gradually. The first couple of weeks Steve managed to split his time between the two men pretty well when they weren’t all together. It was fairly easy with Bucky now staying in the penthouse of the Tower with them. The first time Tony saw Steve slipping through his fingers was when Bucky came up from the gym, still sweaty from his work out and gazed heatedly at Steve before licking his lips. Steve flushed beside where he and Tony were cuddling on the sofa. He barely kissed Tony goodbye tripping over himself to follow Bucky after the soldier announced he was going to shower.
After a few tries Tony finally managed to moan out, “Fuck me, please, need it… God I’m so close, just, just fuck me already and stop being a dick.”
Bucky was lying naked against the headboard, hair still wet from his shower, stroking his cock as he watched Tony. Flushing a bright red, Tony stuttered out the first thing that came to mind. “What… What are you doing?”
Making a sound of disapproval Steve said, “Tony, so help me I will drag you away from that lab finished or not. Listen to Bucky, and please for the love of God do what he says.”
Bucky looked so distraught Tony didn’t know if this was an act or if he was seriously upset. “I forgot our swim trunks upstairs. Not even sure where I left them at…”
Bucky groaned with Tony’s actions saying, “Mmmmkay, I, uh, need to focus on working Tony now. He’s been performing really well, taking every last bit,” Bucky thrusted all the way into his throat hard punctuating each his last words with the motion, “I shove down his throat. Only fair I start eating through my portion, since Tony’s swallowed his.” Bucky was still thrusting into Tony’s mouth when he felt Bucky’s Tongue began licking his sensitive center outside before pushing all the way in. He repeated pushing, stretching the opening as Tony’s noises were muffled by the appendage in his mouth sliding back and forth. Bucky ate him open until Tony’s legs were twitching with each dip of Bucky’s tongue, and his whimpers had increased loud cries of frustration.
This gave Tony a front row view to Bucky leaning back on his hands before he began launching his cock straight up to fill Tony again and again. The hard assault sent an inferno of pleasure rolling through Tony’s body, pushing him racing towards completion. When Tony’s yells reached their apex, bouncing off the walls to echo through the room, he heard Bucky laughing as he said, “Damn Tony, do I feel that good pounding into your ass sweetheart? I’m sure they can hear you on the street. I know I’m wrecking my way through these barriers, and sliding so far down I’m splitting his ass wide open banging into every muscle, but God Stevie have you ever heard him yell like this?”
Steve was conflicted since he wanted them to go on but also wanted them to stop and was happy when Tony came, now he wouldn’t have to make that choice. He was about to get up and go to Bucky, aching and wanting nothing but to feel the man fuck him through the mattress at this point, when Steve realized Tony came untouched. He’d always told Steve it wasn’t possible for him and that no one had ever made him come without help. Both of his boyfriends were driving each other to higher heights of pleasure Steve had never managed for either of them.
Tony would deny the needy high pitched whimper escaping from his throat to his grave. At the sound, Steve’s hands clenched harder around Tony’s wrists. The action caused his back to arch, rubbing their groin and chests together as he moaned against Steve’s lips. A growling sound rumbled from Steve as he repeated Tony’s action, rolling his hips down to slide their lengths together.
This would have all been hilarious if Tony hadn’t felt the prickle of jealousy role up his spine. Any amusement he would normally feel at Clint’s pain was drowned out by all the emotions one statement made him feel. He tamped them down quickly, giving Steve his biggest press smile. “I knew it; no one in the world could be as wholesome as you were making out to be. Good for you…”
The night after listening to Tony and Steve have sex, or at least what they thought was sex, Bucky’s resolve to have Tony was pretty much cemented. Once Steve came about 5 seconds within having Tony’s mouth on his dick and left Tony prep himself, Bucky considered himself to be doing those two a favor. One of the reasons he listened was because Bucky knew Tony would be dying for it after the tease he put the smaller man through in the lab. Knowing this would be one of their better sessions in the bedroom, Bucky wanted to get some insight into what Tony was already getting.
As Bucky stopped holding back and began to pound into the bundle of nerves inside Tony, he began to lose all reason. When Bucky used the hand holding his cock to rub his perineum, Tony’s vision began to black out as he felt another dry orgasm beginning to emerge. He managed to give a cracked sob of, “Yes… Love it, love it more…” right before Bucky released his grip. He’d never felt a release so powerful, it drown Tony’s senses until he lost touch with anything and everything. Unlike most of Tony’s orgasms that pulsated out and began to die down as it flowed, this one felt like it originated from every cell of his body. It caused Tony’s back to bow completely as his legs quaked wildly, not a sound leaving his open mouth after his initial choked gasp. Tony couldn’t say how long it lasted though it felt like hours, or how long before he was able to breathe again.
“He’ll probably need something to hold onto so just have him wrap his arms around your waist.” Tony did as instructed which brought Bucky’s long hard erection rubbing his face. “Alright Tony try to open up as wide as you can for me.” Knowing Bucky meant his mouth and not his legs, Tony opened as he felt the head slide down his chin, passing his lips to push into Tony’s mouth as Bucky moved his hips. “Ok Stevie, I think we’re good now to start working him loose. The key to all the exercises we’re doing today is constant force back and forth, easing your way in,” Tony moan was muffled around Bucky’s cock plunging into his mouth as he felt a tongue circle around his wrinkled center, “and then easing out. You get all that Steve?”
Bucky dropped his head shaking it; Tony had been getting mediocre/bad sex for 3 years. “Christ Steve, you been sleeping with him for three years and that’s as crazy as you’ve gotten with him? You haven’t tried tying each other up, using toys, or, hell even fucking him outside in like… the pool or something?” Steve looked embarrassed again as he shook his head no. Well Damn, Bucky was surprised it took as long as it did for Tony to fall on his dick, when something even crazier occurred to Bucky. “Stevie… Was Tony your first?”
It was then Tony realized Bucky had not gone soft, like at all. Even Steve had to coax himself back to hardness before he could go again, but here Bucky was still as hard if not harder than he was before. “I’m not sure if I’m impressed or a little jealous of you at the moment. Damn you soldiers and your amazing refractory periods but since it’s benefiting me at the moment could please just get back to it, I’d like to come before next year preferably.”
Already primed and on edge, when Tony felt the tongue sliding around his opening his body shook hard as he let out a loud moaned, “Oh God, Steve…” If Tony thought Steve was driving him crazy before, now he was sure of it. The Dom licked him open for what seemed like hours, it may have even been that long. Tony begged for release, and cursed Steve every time he pulled back when Tony was close.
Tony shivered, eyes rolling back. He knew exactly why Bucky set this little scene together. Tony clenched even tighter around the hardness penetrating deep within. He shuddered at the fact Bucky was trying to appease his jealous, letting Tony know he may have fucked Steve but there were still things only Tony could do for him. “Please Bucky, Mmm… Baby, need it harder.” Eyes regaining focus, Tony pinned Bucky in his gaze above him as he the filthiest smile Bucky had ever seen on anyone. “You know how I like honey, now fuck me like you own me… Ahh yeah,” His words had caused Bucky to slam forward once, drawing a moan from Tony. Once he caught his breath again he finished saying, “Because we both know exactly how much you do.”
When Bucky saw Tony give Steve an expression of loving adoration before it became a veiled look of guilt he knew he needed focus Tony back on him. “Alright you two, first I need to talk to you both one on one to figure out your likes and dislikes.”
Only Steve’s eyes showed the surprise he felt at Tony’s words, it was there for just a second before Tony saw it disappear. “Alright, I’ll handle it.” Holding his hand out to Tony again, he gave him a challenging stare. “You gonna trust me to take care of you Tony?”
Some sort of realization dawned on Clint as he stopped laughing suddenly. He straightened up as he looked at Tony fully before throwing up his arms in disappointment and crossing them. “Ah man… Damn it Tony, I was really looking forward to seeing what Dom Steve with a sub was going to be like.” His voice had lowered when he muttered childishly, “Always ruining stuff… Never gonna see Dom Steve…” as said man walked into the room.
Steve blushed bright red as he met Tony’s eyes and then ran them down to see Tony’s abs and dick covered in cum. “Uh, that’s a, no problem. I guess I’ll go get him showered.”
Steve just smiled back at him as Tony drifted off, unable to complete his words or thoughts. “What they said was partly true, Level 10 Sub’s will never willingly give up enough control to submit fully or go into subspace.” As Steve spoke his next words, the look on his face changed to something astonishingly commanding. “In order for it to happen, your Dom has to be strong enough to
Bruce was a switch, having overlapping traits between his level 6 Sub and level 5 Dom orientations. This made him the perfect friend for Tony. He could sympathize with some of the trials Tony faced as a Sub running a company, as well as give him guidance as a Dom when he felt unbalanced. With Rhodey gone off with the military most of the time, when he and Pepper broke up, Bruce had been there to give him the support he needed without trying to assert influence over him like other Dom’s would.
Bucky’s hand unwrapped from his hair to cup Tony’s cheek, thumb tracing across his lips before invading Tony’s mouth. “Mhmmm, you look so good on your knees for me baby. Show me how much you want my cock and I might let you have it.” Tony saw Bucky’s eyes blaze when he began to suck on the thumb Bucky had put in his mouth. He flicked his tongue over the tip before wrapping it around Bucky’s thumb sucking hard. Removing the finger from Tony’s mouth to rest both hands on the counter above him, Bucky’s head came up to stare over the bar and leaned to the side as if listening. Bringing his focus back down, Bucky gave Tony a smirk. “Since you asked so pretty, I’ll make a deal with you, sugar. Steve is headed this way right now. You can either get up and pretending nothing happened, or you can stay down and risk getting caught with my dick in your mouth.”
Looking back at it now, he could definitely see why she’d be pissed even though he hadn’t meant it that way. Clint was his friend, his very annoying friend, but a close friend regardless. He’d never demoralize him in any way, not even to piss off Nat. Steve was right, it was the surest way to piss off any Dom but Tony would never stoop that low. There were to many other ways to piss off annoying Dom’s and Tony would never have listed that as an option.
Steve comes to Bucky for advice, Bucky tells Steve about Tony’s newest ‘muscle’ problem, and Tony sets a scene up with Steve at Bucky’s request.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony letting the man drift further into his arms. “Bucky gives the best foot massages. Promise you’ll feel 10 times better once he’s done.”
Licking his lips, Tony made his way over to stand between Bucky’s legs. “Last time I checked, you still owe me for being nice to you yesterday.”
As Bucky leaned back over to Tony giving a small thrust, Tony thought he heard a squeaky gasping noise. All thoughts were driven away as Bucky began driving into him again saying, “Okay Stevie, no problem,” making Tony’s eyes roll and mouth to drop as he gasped, back arching off the bed. “Here, lay on top of Stevie for me sweetheart,” Bucky directed as he pulled Tony forward turning around to face Steve. Bucky’s eyes roved possessively as he pushed Tony back leaning between the two soldiers. “Hold him up for me Steve,” Tony felt hands on his back supporting him as Bucky continued giving Tony a hungry smirk, “Gonna try to finish up quick so I don’t cum all over him.”
Rolling his eyes Tony repeated the safeword he’d told Steve days ago when they had their “safe, sane, consensual” conversation. “Clint,” Tony bantered back with a smile, recalling how he told Steve if he ever said the archer’s name in bed something was very, very wrong.
Tony’s hand began to play with the screw drivers he had near, trying to keep himself grounded enough to talk to Steve. He didn’t even get a chance to answer when Jarvis began spouting his secrets through the lab. “It’s been 3 days, 7 hours, and 36 minutes since Mr. Stark has eaten anything substantial or slept. He did however have a protein shake 26 hours ago.”
Looking a Steve confused, Tony wondered what he was about to ask. “No problem Steve, you know you can ask me anything.”
“… Not sure Nat appreciated it much. How are things going back there, Bucky’s behaving himself I hope?”
Bucky smirked shifting his hips, causing Tony’s lips to part as his eye’s fluttered. “Should probably lay you down if we’re going to be banging into
Tony’s eyes widened and he fought the effort to start jumping for joy. Trying to seem hesitant, as if this was a hard decision, Tony waited a moment before he replied. “Bucky’s your best friend Steve, I get you want to make sure he’s okay.” Giving Steve a sarcastic sigh he continued saying, “I’ll miss sleeping naked but I guess for you I’ll suffer through it.”
“Yeah, hmmm… I, uh, Damn, Ahh, I don’t know where he learned those moves… But, Uhh, know it wasn’t from you.” Bucky chuckled out darkly, “The way kept popping his ass up on me every time he went down is definitely not something you’d have thought of. Nah, something tells me he’s only moved around like that for me. Is that right Tony, you ever use those moves on Steve?”
His voice was rough and coarse as he pleaded with Bucky. “Please Bucky… Need you. Don’t make me wait anymore, please…”
Just as he began to slide into the darkness of sleep, a light rhythmic thumping and tiny nearly inaudible moans broke through Steve’s consciousness. Sleep had ended up consuming him before he could think of it further…
In actuality, Tony didn’t want a repeat of last night. He needed some time to figure out how to make sure Bucky didn’t make him lose his mind again.
He continued his motions until Steve was hard again, Bucky let out frustrated sound as he saw Steve’s breathing increase again to labored pants. Pulling out of Tony he stood saying, “Guys sorry, this isn’t working. I can’t move in Tony like he needs me to with these pants on.” Bending over Bucky took off his pants and lifted back up to fold them, placing them on the coffee table. He moved slowly through the motions wanting to give each man a long hard look at his arousal, sticking straight out beneath his shirt.
As Steve’s orgasm rolled over him, he felt bad that he didn’t even try to hold back. Steve knew he could have staved off the climax, but Tony’s mouth suckling around him always felt like a heaven Steve was nowhere near saint enough to deny. Usually he’d have to wait a few moments to get himself back together before taking care of Tony, so Steve was grateful he had Bucky there to help Tony as he basked in the glow of his orgasm. Still shaking slightly he bent down to kiss Tony’s mouth, tasting a little of his release there when he did. “I’m sorry baby, I love your lips around me too much. I just couldn’t make myself pull back.” Looking up to where Bucky had stilled inside of Tony and looked to him in question, Steve kissed Tony’s forehead before he continued to say, “Bucky’s gonna take care of you though. You both look so beautiful together and I would love to see him make you cum. Is that okay honey?”
After regaling him about Pepper, Bucky told Tony of a man he liked and thought he could love. When he asked what happened Bucky shrugged, “I needed some things in bed he couldn’t handle.” Tony knew it wasn’t intentional but the way Bucky turned to face him to explain further, the soldier’s breath caressed Tony’s ear with every word. It made it feel like Bucky was whispering to Tony, describing everything he wanted to do to him.
Chasing the companionship and all consuming satisfaction, Tony began to seeking out Bucky. The first time he did, Bucky smiled brightly as he pulled Tony to him. Having had a nightmare when he fell asleep at his lab table, he went to find Bucky not wanting to be alone. Kissing him, Bucky voiced he was so happy Tony wanted to be taken care of by him. Apparently wanting to show Tony exactly how happy, Bucky tried to suck out Tony’s brain through his dick before fucking him against the living room wall. Bucky relentlessly went at him until Tony came 3 times. After the second, Tony was in tears confused at if  he wanted Bucky to stop or continue at the intense pain/pleasure. Unable to get his legs to work or stop shaking, Bucky had to carry Tony to lie down once they were done. After that, Tony didn’t hesitate to come to the man when he needed anything.
“We can’t… We’re not supposed, Oh God…” When he finally bottomed out, he didn’t waste any time as he held Tony in place, hammering him with deep hard thrusts. “Steve said…  Ah, fuck Bucky… You know, can’t… Mhmm, always so fucking deep, yeah baby… Oh God don’t stop, so full. Fuck me hard, just like that.”
Tony didn’t know exactly how to feel about the current events unfolding, but he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t rock hard thinking of Bucky trying to teach Steve a few things. When Steve had come to him asking if it would be ok to invite Bucky to watch them so he could learn how to please Tony better, the genius was shocked. How Bucky had coerced this along Tony wasn’t sure, but the subsequent guilt was too much to handle. At best, Bucky would teach Steve how to make Tony feel the way he felt every time Bucky slid inside him but he’d still be unsatisfied with Steve’s size not meeting Bucky’s. At worse, and this was much more likely to be Bucky’s primary motivation, Bucky would just fuck Tony three ways to Sunday showing Steve he was better at it. He couldn’t let that happen and betray Steve even worse than he already had. Even though it may take time to appear, his detour from weapons manufacturing proved that at some point, even Tony Stark would show a conscious.
“What!? I…” Steve all but stammered but at them indignantly. “I’m not a virgin… Of course I’ve… For Christ sake Peggy and I were dating the entire time I was overseas!”
Tony shivered lightly at the words. “We can still go… Can still ride with the others. They probably haven’t left, or, or got that far.”
Turning to Clint he leveled him with the same angry gaze. “You… You helped him didn’t you? You gave him sleeping pills or, or something, and helped him knock me out.” Tony gasped loudly as he gave Clint a look of disbelief. “Was this so you could beat my score in Mario Kart you Hawk-assed cheater?”
He then walked off; whistling for the other Avenger’s to gather up so they could practice. Tony yelled at his back, “Why the hell are you going to the store anyway? We’re superheroes and I’m rich, we have people to do that for us…”
Finally letting go of the iron grip he had on Tony, Steve pulled back. He brought their heads back together as he cupped Tony’s cheeks in both hands staring into his eyes. “The day I came down to your lab, I told you I knew all the ways you wanted to give in, and all the ways to get you there. I’ve never lied to you Tony, every word I’ve ever told you is true. I would never have told you I could get you there if there was ever any doubt that I could.”
to tell me. From the day I met you, even in pictures of you going years back, I see you carrying heavy secrets. Even if you think it won’t matter, will you let me hold on to them for you? Give them to me and I’ll help you carry them.”
Snickering at Tony as he rounded the sofa Steve said, “You’ll live I promise, and hey,” Steve paused pointing to Bucky as he backed out into the hallway, “I’m sure if you ask nicely Bucky will show you attention until I get back.
Bucky eyes slid back to Tony’s as he raised his eyebrows in question, leaving the decision up to him. Tony shrugged as he smirked saying, “I’m always up for a challenge.”
Steve’s speech was interrupted as Bucky moaned and grip the sheets beneath him to ground himself at the pleasure he was feeling. To the surprise of both super soldiers, Tony had started to roll back and forth on Bucky’s dick again. Wanting to stop before they got too worked up again, Bucky’s hand came back to Tony’s waist again to still his movements. Only able to make small shallow thrust now, Tony began to groan in frustration. He looked down at Bucky pleadingly, still completely unaware of much outside of Bucky’s dick inside him but no longer moving. “God Bucky please don’t stop… Uhm, feel so good. Don’t stop, don’t ever stop, keep fucking me till you can’t come anymore.” Bucky couldn’t help the small thrust of his hips at Tony pleas, causing the man above him to quiver around his dick. “Wanna be good for you, Mmm… Please Bucky, make me come again… Feels so good when I come for you.”
Tony looked down between his folded knees at Steve licking around the sensitive opening and prodding a finger in feeling nothing but shame. After feeling the confident overwhelming sparks Bucky gave him daily, Steve’s uncoordinated flicks of his tongue just weren’t doing anything for him. Tony even started to give him instructions since Steve hardly ever licked him open, but this just served to frustrate them both more. Finally, when Steve’s fingers began their descent inside Tony to press softly at his prostate, Tony moaned lightly feeling the familiar tiny sparks of pleasure briefly. The soft flesh between his legs began to harden again as Tony began to enjoy Steve’s fingers moving inside him. Bucky halted their movements a little while later.
Though his hand moved quickly to grab Tony’s making the other man jump slightly, Bucky was surprisingly gentle grabbed Tony’s finger as he stretched the others out to hold them in his metal fist. His Thumb grazed across Tony’s knuckles as he stared into the engineer’s eyes considering his next words. “Alright Tony, if that’s how you feel then I’ll leave you both alone.” Tony’s jerked back slightly in surprise at Bucky’s words. “We won’t be together anymore; I won’t touch you at all. Once you finish fixing up my arm I’ll stay away completely and leave to go back to the compound. Is that what you want baby?”
Tony’s jerked in Bucky’s arms wanting his every show of ownership. Every muscle in his body began shaking violently as he came thinking of Bucky covering him in his. Tony loved how possessive Bucky was, how he was constantly doing things to stake a claim. It was the hottest thing he’d ever felt and Tony never felt someone wanting him so expressively before. As Tony contracted and pulsed around him, Bucky gave a throaty moaned growl coming deep in Tony’s ass before pulling out to paint over his ass, stomach, and still pulsing dick, mixing with what Tony had already released. Laying Tony next to Steve, Bucky called his friends name to get his attention. Steve looked up at him disoriented, obviously still coming down from his orgasm he thought no one knew of.
“I’m good, just came as a surprise. We can still head downstairs.” Eyes coming down to watch Tony tuck him back in his pants, Bucky gave a smirk and said, “I’m definitely in the mood to pound that ass of yours into the floor.”
Next chapter will have Bucky’s “lessons” begin with Steve and Tony. Unless I get carried away with one of the scenes, this will be the ending solidifying Bucky’s control over everyone.
Steve seemed overwhelmed with all the information. “I uh, didn’t know there was… how I would even do hip rolling… Bucky what the hell am I gonna do?” Steve asked, voice growing higher and panicked with each word.
Keeping “ch. 3/help” up since I’ll probably revisit this type of fic a few more times, probably Tony/Stephen Strange and Thor/Tony while he’s dating Clint, Bruce, or Steve again. Same format, no hurt feelings though the endgames will differ. If you have any ideas or scenarios you want to see can comment there.
Tony’s legs extended slightly around Bucky’s waist as Tony felt him slip out slowly before ramming back forward. “Uhh, Yes Bucky. Do whatever, Nnmm… so good, you need me to.”
“No one makes Tony Stark beg.” Tony’s snort after his response was cut off as both Bucky’s hands settled on Tony’s hips. He began pulling Tony into his lap, slowly sliding him further and further up his dick. Tony still felt the slight burn as Bucky pushed inside even though Steve had just fucked him, though it wasn’t painful just uncomfortable. It seemed to take forever for Bucky finish moving forward, when he finally had Tony released the breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. He opened his eyes that had fallen shut at Bucky’s initial press to gaze up after the man hadn’t moved for a few moments. Giving him a condescending look Tony asked, “You gonna move soldier, or is your dick only for show?”
Walking on silent feet to the bed on Tony’s side, Bucky uncovered the smaller man bringing his body into view. His hand reached to run over the briefs that were clinging to Tony’s ass, the rest of his body nude. Bucky pulled the fabric down uncovering the treasure beneath. Grinning at what he was about to do, Bucky slipped in beside Tony as he took his cock out to give his lover a surprise.
Tony’s high pitched whines were coming with more frequency at Bucky’s pace, his eyes focusing up on Steve. “God Steve, he’s, uhhh… didn’t think I could… Oh God, yes, feel this good… He’s working in there…” Tony quivered as his arousal barreling forward lighting across his skin as he sobbed, “Uhh, oh my God, oh my god, fuck I, I, stretching… so… Uhhh wide… Please, Bucky, Uhhh, never want to stop.”
“Okay… How long has it been since you had sex together? What were you guys doing before and what have you tried?”
, he didn’t miss one spot. Well, that’s not completely true, much to Tony’s chagrin he missed several inches but Tony was pretty sure that was on purpose. By the time he made it to Tony’s chest after his tour down Tony’s arms, he was no longer able to hold back the light gasps from slipping from his lips as Steve paused to torment and tease Tony’s nipples. When he continued on to Tony’s hips, tongue delving into the small indentations of skin at his abdomen, tiny moans began to seep between his gasps. As he reached Tony’s feet, suckling at the skin on Tony’s toes, small shivers had begun to rack Tony’s body.
Tony gave Bucky a heated glare as he gripped the other man’s shoulders. “In order to get me to come twice you have to do it a first time. Now stop treating me like glass and fuck me Barnes, you fucked Steve way harder. Let go of all that control, even that last little but you hold back for Steve. I can take it.”
Looking red faced and embarrassed Steve stammered, “Uh, I was wanting to, um, get your advice about something but its, um… kinda, uh… damnit Buck,” Steve paused throwing up his hands then running one of them over his face. “I’m not even sure where to start…”
Steve began stopping in his motions as they neared throwing a smile over to the pair. “Hey you two, coming down to get your work out in?”
”Mostly?” Tony asked before he thought better. He needed to get Steve off the phone quickly and this would not help.
Leaning down Bucky whispered to Tony, “You’ve been so good for me baby, so good. Gonna let you come for me now. Because…” Bucky kissed and suckled at Tony’s lips sweetly, completely at odds with his next words, “We both know you love my dick more than him. Ain’t that right baby? When it comes down to it, you’d do anything to for it.” Tony shook his head, not willing to confirm Bucky’s words. “It’s ok sugar, you don’t have to agree. We both already know, if it was a choice between having Steve the rest of your life or my dick inside you 30 minutes a day, you know which one you’d choose.”
Feeling his face heat up, along with other body parts, Tony self-consciously licked his lips uncertain of his own response.  Shaking his head slightly to clear it, Tony rolled his chair away breaking Bucky’s grasp to grab another tool from his lab table. He cleared his throat before speaking as he returned back to his place although his voice still came out breathily. “I still say proximity is going to cause too many complications. Blow dart to the ass is the best way to go in my book.”
Clint gave him an incredulous expression saying, “I would never…” before he couldn’t hold back his laughter, “Ok yeah, I totally would, thanks for the idea.” When Tony took a menacing step forward the archer threw up his hands in innocence. “But I didn’t, I swear… I am just an innocent bystander to whatever Steve did… You should totally be mad at him, not me, I’ll be mad to… Steve, we’re mad at you, not sure why but we are very angry.”
Bucky leaned down to pressing a quick kiss to Steve’s forehead. “Ever since you became Captain America, everyone has been telling you how perfect you are. The perfect soldier, the perfect leader, the perfect gentlemen, of course you’d get tired of that weight. Makes sense you’d get off on finally not having to be perfect, on seeing someone you trust being the perfect one so you don’t have to be. I understand sweetheart, and next time I want you to trust that I’ll understand. No matter how crazy what you want sounds in your head, Tony and I will never look down on you for wanting the things you do. We’ll only be hurt by you not telling us.”
Tony let out an exaggerated moan feeling himself starting to relax. “You’re the best honey bunches. Knew I kept you around here for something.
Any longer and Tony was going come, he was so close the smallest brush across him would have done it. Because of this, he was simultaneously grateful and angry at the interruption when the Avengers alarm sounded. Steve jumped, rising marginally to lean over and grab his phone from the coffee table. Tony followed after him at a slower pace, his movements slightly uncoordinated because of his arousal.
It took nearly 20 minutes, but Bucky finally drilled down until all his cock pierced through. Once there, he groaned out a low growl as he grinded forward, eyes growing heated when he heard Tony’s whimper as he held his place.  “Knew you’d be able to take all of me.”
Sorry for the wait everyone, the last chapter always takes the longest because I’m trying to tie up loose ends.  Should be posted tomorrow or Friday.
Grip closing minutely on the flesh in his grasp, Steve’s mouth parted slightly he cleared his throat. Voice somewhat higher than it normally would be, Steve said, “Um, yeah Buck, this is a, uh, that’s a great idea. Should try this for a while, and, uh, see if it works.”
What Tony had not expected, and in hindsight probably should have, is that to get to know Steve Rogers, he’d actually get to
Tony’s eyes rolled as he began to see black spots around them through his tears. His body was shaking from his climax rapidly approaching when Tony sobbed shouting, voice cracking from being ashamed to admit each word, “Ahhh, God, I can’t, I need you… Uh, God, can’t cum… Uhhh, Bucky please, fuck, why… Huhm, can’t cum with Steve, fuck, MMmmm, just you, God Bucky just you.”
He knew Steve was about to tell them he didn’t feel comfortable with Bucky and Tony sleeping together. With the way Tony moaned and cried out for him, Bucky honestly wasn’t sure if he could that. Wasn’t sure he could ever stop being with Tony now that he’d felt how good it was breaking him open on his dick.
He probably should have paid more attention to the conversation that followed, but he just felt too good. As Steve spoke, Tony found himself drifting in and out, losing his focus on Steve to the complete satiation he felt. Normally Tony would have been able to do both and invent something new at the same time, but his mind was still a little fuzzy and hadn’t completely flipped back on. He did manage to get the basics of what Steve wanted and was able to give him a murmured, “Ok baby, no problem.”
Steve shook his head sitting down on the edge of the hot tub. “It’s no problem Buck, I want to help out anyway I can.”
He was only vaguely aware of Steve moving toward them, pressing soft kisses against Tony’s face as well before standing. “Need you to suck me baby, want us to come together while I’m making love to you.”
Bucky gripped Steve’s chin in hand, steering his attention from the panic attack he was working up. “Stevie calm down, I know what we can do.” Steve’s expression turned hopeful and Bucky smiled patting his cheek. “Only way I can let you know what to do is if I’m around while you’re trying different things. That way I’d even be able to show you how to position and move without trying to explain it.” Bucky did his best to make his expression as innocent as possible when he said, “If he’s ok with it, I can even demonstrate on Tony to you so you know exactly what to do, maybe try out a few things till we see what works best. That sound like a plan?”
Depressing right? But Tony’s known this fact since he was 17 years old. His most guarded secret that anyone with a library card could figure out. No matter how many dates he went on, how many people he slept with, or how long they stayed, in the end Tony knew it was always temporary. To really understand, he’d have to go back to the beginning…
Tony was a mess of shivers and moans as he begged, “Oh god, Bucky please, Umm… I need more, can’t take it… Please just, Aahh…”
Steve grew impossibly redder as he nodded, “Yeah, uh… that. When I asked him about it he said he’s been having a hard time, you know… climaxing.” His next words were rushed defending Tony’s honor. “Now, he said he still loves me and doesn’t want to break up or anything, but that it hasn’t been the best so he’s not, uh… really in the mood anymore.”
They were in Tony’s pool when he spotted Steve coming through the Balcony doors. Tony told Bucky only to have the man penetrate his ass harder than he had been. He had Tony against the side of the pool, hand holding the ankles of each leg spreading them wide. Tony could feel his thighs touching the pool wall each time Bucky slammed home. Leaning to whisper in his ear Bucky asked, “Do you want me to stop baby?” Moaning as Bucky kept up his assault on Tony’s prostate, sending spikes of pleasure surging at each thrust, he shook his head no. “I didn’t think so.”
Kneeling above Tony now, he knew he had the other man exactly where he needed him to be. His glassy unfocused gaze let Bucky know how deep he had pushed him into subspace, where his barriers between what was right and wrong would be buried under the cloud of need he was currently feeling.
Tony clenched around him like a vice making earsplitting moans as he came. “God Bucky yes, so fucking good… So deep baby, yes, please… Ahh, God don’t stop, fuck me Bucky, fuck me, fuck me, Uhhh…”
Tony lay on his bed face down as Steve pushed inside of him. Wrapping Tony is his arms Steve began to move giving Tony his full weight. He was whispering endearments in Tony’s ear kissing his neck, and Tony was lying underneath sincerely trying to enjoy it. So far, almost everyone pant and moan coming from him was faked. The reason they were in the position was so that Steve wouldn’t see Tony’s initially half hard cock go completely soft and ask questions.
Tony could barely think, for the past six days he had been edged beyond belief by Bucky. He yelled around hardness in his mouth, causing Steve to grab Tony’s hair and moan as a Tony felt another dry orgasm rake over him. His shudder ran through every limb as Bucky continued to drive in and out of him, still keeping the sluggish pace he had before. Tony was still no closer to a decision when Steve gave a gentle tug on his hair, signaling Tony to release him now that he was fully hard.
Bucky pressed into Tony, stretching him wider than he’d ever been. Tony felt as if electric currents traveled his skin at Bucky’s slow glide into him. When he finally bottomed out, Tony arched moaning at the feeling. Bucky was igniting Tony in places he’d never felt, filling him in ways he never experienced before. When he began to moderately pace in and out, Tony felt each stoke all over his body. Sliding across his prostrate with every glide, Tony’s moans began to fill the room growing louder with each thrust. Bucky’s chatter was a constant stream in Tony’s ear, saying things like
From what Tony could feel at the moment, he was pretty sure the dick that had gave him the best sex of his life was still splitting him open. Tony shivered at the feeling before nudging Barnes and trying to wiggle his way from underneath him. The man gave an unintelligible mumble as rolled to the side still completely asleep. Finally freed, Tony tried to make his way out of the bed but was stopped as Bucky’s arm wrapped around him and pulled the smaller man to spoon against him. Try as he might Tony couldn’t unwrap the arm holding him hostage from around his waist.
Tony came to consciousness slowly, feeling fully sated and relaxed in ways he hadn’t ever had before. After making Tony come for the last time, Bucky had sweet-talked him through the aftermath of what happened. Still seated deep inside, he murmured praises of how Tony had done so well with his lips beside Tony’s ear. His hands roved up and down Tony’s body soothingly as he slowly came back to full coherence. He’d known all about subspace, even had the pleasure of seeing a few lovers go there for him, but had never felt the effects himself before.
Steve’s eyes attentively scanned through the short message detailing what he was needed for. “It doesn’t look to serious. Fury wants me to do Recon with Nat, I should be back in a couple days but I’ll call you if it runs longer.” He gave Tony a brief kiss goodbye before he rose and began to make his way to the Quinjet. Waving absentmindedly to Bucky as he left, gaze still locked on his phone, Steve called out to him saying, “See you later Buck, take care of Tony for me while I’m gone.”
The route they made to Steve’s rooms was uneventful, or at least Tony thinks so. He was being distracted by one Steve Rogers in all his Dom glory at the time so whether or not that’s true is still up in the air. What Tony can say with complete certainty is between kisses and gropes to each other’s flesh, that they did make it at some point.
The next month with Bucky and Steve living in the penthouse passed quickly. After the day in the living room, Bucky pretty much did whatever he wanted to Tony whenever he wanted it. Not that Tony was complaining, he loved even second of it. Tony didn’t know when he began spending every night with the man, it just became routine because they were constantly all over each other. The 2-3 nights Bucky didn’t wake Tony up getting into his bed from a “nightmare”, Bucky was fucking Tony in any other room of the house then sending him to bed just before morning.
Bucky’s gaze over Tony at his words should have set the room on fire, though it did still burn through every inch of Tony’s skin. “So fucking pretty baby, Mmmm… Gonna take you apart every fucking second of everyday. Best fucking part of breaking you… Ah yeah baby, best part is Stevie… been too busy coming from riding my ass... to notice you screaming how much you love my dick…” Tony body locked momentarily all over hearing a dark chuckled moan saying, “Mmmm Tony, I’m 12 inches deep, about to make his boyfriend cum on my dick, and he had to rub against me to cum. Uumm, fuck, and now I’m about to cover you in cum, marking you all over you. Just to show him how much you’re fucking mine, baby.”
The first time Bucky came and was still hard made Steve pause, since it was the first time he had ever seen it happen. Usually he’d have to give Bucky some help to go again quickly if they wanted to, but he had stayed hard not once but twice after coming inside Tony. The first time made the first stirring of arousal streak across him, the second was like putting a match to gasoline inside Steve with a small touch of jealousy.
Tony felt Bucky kiss his neck as he was gliding so deep yet so slow. “I know baby. Missed me filling you up like this. Know how bad you need it,” Tony arched back into Bucky, pushing him in further. “It’s ok sweetheart, gonna fuck you like this all night.” Biting his lip so he wouldn’t moan too loudly, Tony’s leg clenched around Steve’s where it lay. “Gonna fuck you slow until morning, making you feel every inch.”
Steve climbed into bed later, spouting apologies which Tony waved off, before holding Tony in those massive arms and asking about his day. They talked for about half an hour before Tony began to drift off, thinking maybe the painful display had been worth it if this is what he got afterwards. Of course time proved him wrong. He barely was asleep a few moments before he felt Steve slip out the bed. Tony stayed awake till morning lying in bed alone, hearing the moans off and on through the night. He pretended to still be asleep when Steve slipped back into bed that morning around 6 and promptly went to sleep.
He was pulled out of his daze, cock still hard in his hand as he heard Tony moaning to Bucky not to stop. Steve began stroking himself again as he heard Bucky ask, “Not gonna stop sweetheart. Gonna be inside this perfect ass for the rest of the night. You’re gonna fall sleep to me inside you and wake up to me fucking you again… Make you come all night for me baby.” Bucky lay Tony back on the bed, kissing the smaller man directly across Steve now. He could now see every inch of Bucky pounding into Tony, stretching the man so wide Steve was sure Tony wouldn’t even feel him if tried to fuck him right now.
Without beating around the bush Bucky said, “Tell me what’s wrong, sugar. Is this about me fucking Stevie?” Feigning ignorance, Tony gave halfhearted ‘What are you talking about’ words and gestures before Bucky closed the space between them. Putting a finger beneath Tony’s jaw forcing the man’s eyes to his own, Bucky smirked and pecked a kiss on Tony’s lips. “What, or should I say who exactly are you jealous of Tony?”
Still looking embarrassed but slightly more at ease Steve nodded. “I know, you’re right, I can tell you anything… you’ve always been there for me.” Bucky gave him a smile of encouragement as he continued after taking a deep breath. “Tony and I haven’t been having, um… you know… We, uh, haven’t been…” Steve broke off waving his hand in the air.
Bucky looked at Steve hovering right there at the edge, looking as if he would die if he didn’t touch his cock in the next 30 seconds. “Wouldn’t make any difference though would it baby? You’ll never be able to give it to him the way he needs it because your cock will never be able to fuck him as deep as I can. He’ll only ever scream like this for me, because I’ve owned Tony since the first time I fucked him. From now on, your place is going to be in that fucking chair, watching me shatter Tony apart as he takes me the way you never did. Watching while fuck each other all the ways wanted but could never get from you. The only place you ever going to come again, is on yourself.”
Tony was so far gone, he looked confused at Steve’s words, it was as if he knew he was being told to wait but was trying to wrap his head around why. Wanting to clear up Tony’s confusion first, Bucky brought his hand to the other man’s chin saying, “Eyes on me sweet thing.” When he had Tony’s focus back he continued, “Told you what I wanted you to do honey, not get that sweet little ass up here and sit it on my dick.”
Steve’s face turned a purplish shade of red as he stammered, “NO, I, uh… I didn’t think you were or anything. Just didn’t know if you, uh, if you wanted us to see that.”
When he was led to lie down on Steve’s couch, feet in Steve’s lap as he gently massaged them, Tony continued on. He didn’t even know where he was in his story when his eyes closed; sleep finally overtaking him before he awoke in his own bed 16 hours later.
The team scattered quickly, saying their goodbyes with chuckles as they exited. Tony squeaked out a sound he thought would never come from his mouth as Steve wrapped the chain in his fist, pulling Tony closer. Breathing hard with arousal and a tiny bit a fear, Tony voice shook as he said, “Uh, look Steve… I’m, I ah, probably should have asked before I, um… You should blame Nat, this is her fault.”
It was safe to say that when all three men sat down to watch a movie after all this, Tony was already extremely sexually frustrated. Letting Bucky continue with pulling Tony’s feet into his lap and massaging them was the very last thing Tony needed.
Tony noticed Bucky’s eyes traveling the length of him briefly with his next words. “Nah, I didn’t mind. I’d do the same if I had a gorgeous thing like you to myself to.”
Turning a shade of pink, Steve averted his gaze before answering. “At first, I was too caught up in it being the first time I’d seen you together. It wasn’t until the second time that I figured out why I was so turned on. It seemed… Wrong, I guess. To like that you do that for each other and I can’t.”
Steve didn’t even lift his eyes from what he was working on as he acknowledged Tony’s agitation. “What’s wrong?”
Bucky Chuckled, “Sorry baby, not just yet.” Tony gave a moaned whine opening his eyes as Bucky yelled, “Hey Stevie, can you come here a sec. This is one our positions you should really get a look at.” Tony saw Steve’s approach through the lights dancing across his eyes, as short low grunts escaped his parted lips each time Bucky slammed in. Tony looked to see him stand directly in front of them. Steve could only see Bucky’s shoulders and head while viewing Tony’s body to where it leaned diagonally, disappearing in the water below his abdomen. “Sorry to cut into your work out, but I really need you to see this.”
Turning back to man he was with, Tony was about to let him down gently when Steve’s gruff tone interrupted from behind him. “It’s time to go Tony, we’re leaving.”
All Tony/Bucky chapter with Steve sprinkled as background. Was going to put ch 2 & 3 together but this got to long. So unfortunately you’ll have to wait to get the threesome next chapter. Heads up, it will be a threesome fairly similar to what you’re seeing here in this chapter...
Tony turned to curl his body into Steve’s as he snorted saying, “We’ll live, pretty sure no one’s died from blue balls yet.” When Steve’s face came up from hiding and looked at Tony, his expression was curious before it became very red and embarrassed. “What?” Tony asked wanting to know what brought about those looks.
When Tony had cornered Bucky in the kitchen 3 days prior asking when they’d get a chance to be together again, Bucky had told him, “Whenever you figure out how to make it happen.”
Tony heard Steve behind him saying, “Jesus Christ Tony,” as he dropped his head down to his desk groaning loudly. “You are the biggest snitch in the world J, why have I not decommissioned you yet? Your treachery knows no bounds Brutus…”
As Tony thought through it he saw more pros than cons to agreeing. With Bucky not rattling off porn phrases to Steve, Tony might not only enjoy this but he could also cement to Steve this 3 way thing might work if he chose to continue down his insane path. He could at least try; if Tony hated it he could always stop him. So Tony looked up to Bucky as he shrugged and said, “Why not.”
To say that Tony was avoiding Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, would be a gross exaggeration in his book. He wasn’t avoiding the other man per se, he was just…
Bucky hadn’t been anywhere near to coming yet, but at Tony’s words his orgasm surged through him making his breath catch in surprise. When he felt Steve’s muscles tighten around him as Steve’s body went rigid, Bucky knew he wasn’t the only one who had come. With that awareness, Bucky didn’t fight the wild possessiveness surging through him as he pulled out of Steve. He had grabbed Tony in his arms before he was even finished with his orgasm, cock still spilling cum down onto Steve’s thighs. Settling the other man’s legs around his waist, Bucky knew he had to look completely crazed from the shocked gazes he was getting.
But none of that mattered, he didn’t care what Steve was doing. He didn’t care about the Sub’s that kept vying for Steve’s attention. It never crossed Tony’s mind that one of these Sub’s could be the next Steve brought home but didn’t parade around. It irked Tony that he’d never even know if it was that prissy blonde female Sub or that red haired male, or any of the others here for that matter.
It’s also how Tony knew he’d never find a partner, no Dom wanted to deal with a Sub they couldn’t drop or assert authority over. Angry at Steve for touching the rawest nerve Tony had so nonchalantly, he bit back at him through gritted teeth, “Why are you here, I don’t need to be watched… Don’t you have something better to do? I’m not your damn sub… I’m not your responsibility… Why the hell are you here?”
”wheniwasyourage” - thank you so much for the sparring idea, was able to come up with a scene around that! Lol but they don’t actually ever get to the sparring.
Tony’s glances to his bicep every time he flexed with movement told Bucky that Tony got off on show of strength. The heat that filled Tony’s eyes every time Bucky gave the other man a compliment gave him an easy way of tormenting the man. It also led to him finding out how much dirty talk and a show of confidence made Tony instantly hard. So when the smaller man straddled him, poking Bucky’s inner Beast out of hiding, he knew exactly what buttons to push to make Tony squirm.
Tony was able to cry out the affirmative around the moaned cries Bucky kept dragging from him with every thrust. “God yes, Bucky please… Love this so much, let me… Uhhh please, please, please…”
Things had started out fine. Bucky had come up from the training room to find Tony on his knees, Steve’s dick pumping in and out of his mouth. Instead of joining them like Tony, and probably Steve had assumed he would, Bucky had removed his clothes to sit in the lounge chair across from their bed. When Steve gave him a questioning look, Tony could feel the heat of Bucky’s eyes roaming over his skin when he said, “I want to watch you two together.” Tony watch, head still bobbing up and down Steve, as Bucky began to stroke himself. “Damn if that isn’t a pretty picture. Keep going Stevie, fuck his mouth and then fuck his ass."
Tony gaze turned heated and guilty as he shivered staring up at Bucky. “I think you may be the devil.”
As he began to slip into wakefulness a couple hours later, he started to comprehend the sounds permeating in the room as well as the low murmured voices. Tony could feel the bed moving rhythmically, making what was happening beside him obvious if he hadn’t already caught on. He blinked his eyes opened and was slowly able to make out Bucky and Steve together as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. Both men were laying on their sides as Bucky held one of Steve’s legs up giving Tony full visual of his cock’s slow glide into Steve. Though he could hear Bucky’s low muffled grunts, he couldn’t see his face from where it was buried in the back of Steve’s neck.
Tony was in a pissy mood. When Steve said he was going out to the bar tonight with Sam, for the third time this week, Tony decided it should be a team outing instead. Clint had grumbled the entire way asking Nat why they had to skip cuddling because Tony wouldn’t take his head out of his ass. She on the other hand only looked amused about tonight’s excursion. He encouraged Thor to drone on about the ‘revels’ he’d have on Asgard to drown out Clints whining.
They all sat in silence for a moment just taking in everything that was said. Steve was the one to finally break it as he sat up to look at them both. “We never talked about what we wanted. I was so happy that Tony said I could be with Bucky to that I never stopped to figure out what you both wanted, or what I wanted for that matter. We should think about what we want from each other and from our relationships, then sit down and make sure it’s what everyone else wants to. I love you both and I want you to be happy. Sound okay?”
Bucky fucked Tony throughout the rest of the night, never letting up. Tony’s screams could be heard filling the penthouse as Bucky wreaked havoc on Tony’s senses, putting him in every position on every surface he had available.  Tony’s voice was hoarse, coming out in cracked sobs as he came for the last time, painstakingly overstimulated yet unwilling to stop the pleasure Bucky inflicted. Bucky had come in and all over Tony so many times, painting Tony’s skin until he was satisfied. When he finally was carried to his room to climb on shaky sore legs into bed next to Steve, Tony was still covered with it all over. Bucky had told Tony he couldn’t wash it away until after he slept, to remind Tony who he belonged to.
All of this coincided with Bucky’s cock pounding into the bundle of nerves inside Tony. He drove into Tony with the exact amount of force he loved, that point where it was almost too much sensation but was so good you didn’t want to stop. Using his hips Bucky pushed Tony up and down the huge length breaking him apart, making his head lull back as his body melted into Bucky’s. Tony had no sense of anything, it was too much and not enough at the same time. He lost track of the world around him and couldn’t tell you anything happening out side of the inferno ripping though him.
Though the words were spoken softly in Tony’s ear, he jerked in Steve’s arms as if they’d been shouted. After trying to pull back twice but unable to go against the super soldiers hold, Tony stopped trying and just gasped out, “What… I don’t, what do you mean?”
Bucky raised his hand to Tony’s chin, lifting the other man’s face and eyes to his own. He gave Tony a sincere smile as he said, “Of course I understand sugar, and I don’t want to hurt Stevie either. You were just…” Bucky gave him a bashful look that made Tony smile, anger draining away, “You’re hard to resist sweetheart.” Bucky began leaning into Tony, eyes growing heated, “Once I had you, all I wanted was to make you mine.” Tony shuddered as Bucky’s breath fanned across his lips and his hand gripped the back of his neck. “I wanted to own every inch of you, until everyone you met would know that somewhere out there, someone had already laid claim to you.” Bucky stepped back out of Tony’s space, wanting to laugh a little at Tony’s near face plant as he unconsciously tried to follow him. “But you’re right, I understand and I’ll respect your decision. So,” Bucky paused as he plopped down on the sofa bringing his legs up to rest on the table in front of it, “What do you want to do about what Stevie wants from me?”
Tony stared up in confusion, he knew he’d had what felt like one of his smaller more quickie induced orgasms, but for some reason still felt the burning need to come. When Bucky gaze traveled down Tony’s body to his groin, Tony’s eyes followed the movement to see Bucky’s left arm had moved. The hand that was previously holding Bucky’s weight now circled around Tony’s cock at his base. Bucky had cut off Tony from full completion instead giving him a dry orgasm. Realizing Bucky was going to draw this out caused Tony to moan and give a pulsating clench around Bucky as his eyes rolled back.
Tony was sitting in front of the chair Bucky was occupying. He had to move in front of the man, legs open with his knees touching Bucky’s about mid-thigh, so he could reach tricky area’s on the inside of Bucky arm. They had been arguing about the best way to incapacitate someone for the last ten minutes or so. Shaking his head Tony gave Bucky a look a disbelief saying, “There is no way that would work. Even if it was possible, you’d have to get to close or the surprise person.”
Chuckling Bucky’s eyes darkened. “I’m just making sure that’s the only uncomfortableness you feel before I make you scream for me.” Bucky barely slid out an inch before pushing back in, testing to make sure Tony was ready for him. Tony wanted to roll his eyes again at Bucky treating him with such kid gloves. This must have come across his face because Bucky laughed softly again before leaning over, hand bringing Tony’s above their heads and trapping them there. Arousal coursed through Tony at the action causing him to flush slightly. The cocky smile told him that Bucky definitely noticed the reaction and planned to use it against Tony.
Tony scoffed through a laugh before his expression changed to one of surprise when Steve turned Tony’s chair around to face him. He’d obviously not thought of what to do after that since he just stared at Tony for a moment, as if trying to work out a puzzle. Once he seemed to finally come to a plan in his head, Tony watched as Steve straightened to his full height. His gaze was still worried but now exuding that confidence Tony knew so well from the battlefield. Tony had to clench his fist, digging his fingernails into the skin of his palm to distract himself; the urge of wanting to melt at the other man’s feet was nearly overwhelming.
