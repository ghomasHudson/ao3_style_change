Tony laughed too loudly as he slapped Bruce on the back, but Bruce barely budged from the impact.
Loki sat back in his chair, tapping on the table as he pondered the idea. Some minutes passed as Thor waited calmly for Loki and Loki fought with himself internally.
Instead of responding right away, Steve only stared back at her, too shocked to elaborate.
“Okay, so we need to use the codes to generate this thing to open the door. Think you can handle that, Rogers?” Tony teased.
Yet, later that evening when he was getting ready for bed, Steve couldn’t stop thinking about whatever was bothering Tony to upset him like that. He knew he would just have to learn to adjust; that was the only way. He had already learned a lot working on the project and with Tony. He wasn’t going to let one misunderstanding or other future ones ruin this opportunity.
Pepper and Tony looked at each other again as Natasha walked further into the office. She perched herself against one of the bookshelves, holding a manila envelope in one hand.
Steve didn’t mind the office. Actually, the medium-sized, wall-offed office surrounded by a few cubicles was nice. The office space was also not too far away from his apartment in Brooklyn, so Steve would often ride his bike to work.
Sam straightened out his jacket. “All right, tech nerd.”
Tony swallowed again, remaining still. He waited once more before answering.
Steve continued to moan with unrestrained pleasure as he turned more into the mattress. Tony turned with him, spreading his ass cheeks even further apart as he pushed downward in Steve. Steve felt Tony place a hand on the small of his back and both legs on either side of his body.
Peter nodded quickly, making a move to exit the room, but Tony jumped off the bed to catch him before he could leave.
Tony chuckled. “I’m beginning to think that we’re spending too much time together, but honestly it’s about Synergy.”
Steve turned the chip around in the palm of his hand. “Okay, thank you for the confidence, Tony.” He smiled to convey that he was sincere.
, baby. Just call it a robot.” Tony interjected, waving his hand around.
Bruce smiled as he leaned forward.  “Just ask Steve. I’m pretty sure he’ll go with you.”
However, as he sat in his car, trying to start the engine, a flood of tears rushed out and Tony sat, beside himself, angry for ruining his only chance with Steve.
than once.”
“…uh…” Tony just stared at Steve.
“Even
awkward.”
Tony smiled as he waited a moment, thankful that he had found someone like Steve. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right.” He teased as he rejoined Steve in the bed with the sheet of paper.
Steve nodded slowly. He leaned up against the back of the bed, clearly trying to remember what happened.
“I’ve been looking through the footage from the last couple incidents related to the Synergy device…” Natasha leaned forward to drop the envelope onto Tony’s desk.
Tony closed his eyes and breathed deeply. “Thanks, J.A.R.V.I.S.” He answered back with a hint of annoyance in his voice. He gave himself another moment before walking to the foyer to greet Steve at the elevator.
Tony sighed as he continued walking, sensing that Bruce wasn’t tolerating his defeatist attitude again.
Peter blushed, his body shrinking into the couch cushion between Steve and Tony. “Tony…”
“Sorry.” Tony offered as he kissed Steve.
Tony gasped a few times, rubbing his chest. He felt like his heart was about to explode again. Steve turned onto his side to rub Tony's chest.
Both Steve and the principal frowned at Tony. “Actually…” the principal began after a second, “there’s something you can do, Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers…”
“Well, I hope I’ll be an effective member in this endeavor.” Steve answered as Tony smiled at him. Something about the smile felt half warm and half fake as if Tony were smiling during a press conference.
Jotunheim?”
“I’m all right with that. But I’ll probably end up embarrassing Steve.”
“…so it was fine…?” He asked.
Tony chuckled. “Thanks, Cap.” He ruffled Peter’s hair once more with a grin before motioning for Steve to follow him to the fridge.
Without thinking twice, Tony nodded as he accepted Steve’s hand before rising from his seat. He let Steve guide him to the space designated for dancing, taking a moment before holding onto each other as they swayed to the music.
Steve chuckled before returning to unlock the door. “If you want, maybe I can give you a ride some time.”
Tony chuckled. “Don’t question my methods, Rogers.”
“How was the simulation, Sir?” J.A.R.V.I.S. asked as soon as Tony entered the lab.
The lights flickered on as Tony walked into his home office.
He pretended to study a section of the device as he fiddled, when in reality he was still mulling over his actions from a few days ago. He really didn’t feel like talking about it, especially now since he was in the process of repairing his working relationship with Steve. He also had hoped everyone would just let it go.
“Steve Rogers, right?” Steve’s eyes widened as he heard his name called from behind.
Tony tried again as he joked with Steve before sitting down at their table.
Tony snorted. “My closest? When did this happen?” He joked, but knew his friend was still annoyed about his press answer regarding the safety of Synergy.
Pepper laughed cheerfully. “You’re going to have to talk to him about that.”
“Commence simulation.”
“…he said something about poor performance…” Pepper looked around the room as if someone was listening in on their conversation.
“Good morning, Peter.” Steve greeted as he reached downward to give Peter a hug.
Earlier that morning, Steve hadn’t felt anxious about his first day, but as the elevator zoomed past each floor in the tower, Steve felt his heart beat even louder. He exhaled deeply as the elevator arrived at his destination. He stepped out, looking each way down a long corridor. He took another deep breath; the moment had finally arrived.
“Whatcha got there, Cap?”
Clint nodded. Tony then indicated Bruce and Shuri.
Tony turned to face Bruce, realizing that he had stopped himself, dead center in the lab, clutching his chest.
“Good work, Parker.” He smiled to show that he was genuinely proud that Peter had finally figured out how to parallel park.
“Hey, Tone.” Rhodey patted Tony on the back as he handed him a new drink. Tony grimaced as he tried smiling again to acknowledge his friend, but it was beginning to hurt trying to convince himself that he could make things work with Steve.
“They’re so made for each other but are too dumb to even notice.” Clint sighed to himself, groaning as he tried to make sense of the task he was given.
“That was so fucking hot…” Tony breathed out.
“You’re going to do great.” He whispered, smiling.
Tony barely answered as he turned away from Steve but allowed him to hug his body against his own. He had trouble trying to formulate a sentence as the feeling in his chest started to make his eyes water unexpectedly.
“Okay, gang. Here’s the real deal. Everyone’s suits are in their labs. The material should shield us from whatever this virus is.”
“Of course, Sam. And I’m not. I mean…” Steve shifted on his feet a bit before looking away from Sam.
Our next meeting is scheduled for Monday, the 30
Steve nodded slowly, strangely feeling half relieved, yet half frustrated.
Fury stepped forward to join Tony who was now standing closer to the table. “Our first real run with the device—a decidedly serious one—demonstrates the positive capabilities of the device.” Fury pulled out his own clicker to show the parts of the machine the team had replicated to save the ambassador.
“What, Rogers?” Tony said as he grinned, resting his hands on his hips, “
capable of, to be more precise."
Steve let out a groan as he finally pushed himself up to sit up in the bed, but he made faces from how sore his body felt. Tony sighed as he picked up Steve’s recovery instructions from the bed.
Tony nodded back, looking a little relieved, but Steve told himself not to read into it.
Tony shrugged as if it weren’t a big deal. He really liked Sam and could tell he was a straight shooter, but he was really trying to win points with Steve.
“Oh well, you’ve been patient with me, so that helps.” Steve acknowledged with a cute grin.
(May 2021)
“Steve, are you serious? You said that the interview went really well. Or that you thought so anyway. And you got a call from—what was her name again? Ms. Potts? She called you the other day. Why would the CEO of Stark Industries take the time to call someone they weren’t planning to accept into the program?” Sam had poured himself a drink, taken a quick picture of Steve with his phone then the two of them together by the time he refuted Steve’s unnecessary worry.
“I thought I was responsible for that, Rogers?” Tony retorted.
“Sounds good. Night, Steve.” Tony sounded exhausted, but Steve could sense that he was grateful for the invite.
“Any of you heard of the Synergy device?”
Sam patted Bucky on the back a couple times. “You also gotta make things right with Tony. You know how serious they are…”
J.A.R.V.I.S. shuffled through a few playlists until the computer landed on one that Tony played the most frequently. Tony sat in silence, brooding over his misery.
He paused for a few seconds, hanging his head before looking back up at the group again, “…that doesn’t mean much if there’s something counteracting it in the first place…especially with whatever Thanos is trying to accomplish.”
“I would love to see you in person, if possible…but I understand if you don’t want to see me…”
Pepper reached over to give Tony a hug as the doors to the elevator popped open. She stopped short before entering the elevator to address Tony again.
Tony swore in his head. He felt Steve hold onto him even tighter.
“That’s not making me feel any better…” Steve responded, letting his trepidation be known.
Hammer shook his head, leaning back into his chair. “We managed to stop it before he got far…there was something about the core of the weapon that made it unstable—”
Steve nodded again as he waited before turning to the leave the balcony, stopping for a second, thinking he should say more, before walking inside. He continued inside anyway, telling himself that he needed to give himself and Tony some space.
Bruce and the rest of the team had crowded around Clint who was looking out along the water with a pair of binoculars. Clint scanned the area until he spotted two heads bobbing up and down in the water.
the best it will be at the moment,” Tony responded mid eye-roll, “I’d rather stay positive about the project than sow seeds of doubt.” He then looked around himself to indicate to Rhodey that he was referring to Obadiah who was in deep conversation with some board members and Fury.
Steve made a small noise before clearing his throat again.
Tony’s breath hitched as placed both hands on Steve’s hips, guiding his motion back and forth along his body. Steve sat up a bit to rock his hips against Tony, moaning loudly as he placed one hand on Tony’s chest, moving it along to pinch Tony’s nipples as he rocked forward.
“I had a really nice time tonight, Tony. Peter’s great.” Steve said as he watched Tony approach him before pulling him into a hug.
Steve placed his mug on the table next to him as he showed Tony his shortcut. Tony made a few pleasant-sounding noises as Steve worked.
Tony groaned, loud enough for Strange to recoil. “I think you’re older than me, Strange.”
“Please prepare for departure.” The voice had appeared once more.
As was mentioned before, it had been a while since Steve had been in a relationship or gone out on a date. However, he found himself easily flirting back with Tony whenever prompted—if that was what his lab partner was doing, of course. Again, Steve couldn’t be entirely sure; Tony acted like this with everyone else.
Steve nodded with a laugh. “You did, multiple times in fact.”
The team stepped back to let the doctors hook the ambassador up to the machine. Without a minute to spare, the ambassador’s vital signs immediately returned to stable. All the doctors and nurses present in the room audibly sighed with relief and gratitude.
“Look me up when you finish here.”
think I would do something like this?” He crossed his arms against his body as Tony felt like crawling into a small, dank hole.
Steve shook his head again as he slowly rose from his stool at the island. He walked toward Tony but stopped short.
Tony cocked his head to the side, smiling as he leaned up against the wall behind him. Steve could feel himself losing control over his emotions, which was rare for him. He realized that he and Tony were trying to work through some things but thought Tony would have put aside the argument over the diary to talk about Synergy.
Steve’s face twisted a bit as he laughed. “The ‘what’?”
Tony nodded. “After you, Rogers.” He waited for Steve to walk ahead of him further before following, ascending the stairs before entering the cabin.
Steve barely winced, but inside he was a little perplexed by the offer. “The face?” He asked.
Tony nodded as he patted Steve’s hand before freeing himself. “Yep.” He kept his back facing Steve.
Tony nodded as he reached for his coffee, still not sure what he wanted. “Thanks for the advice, Rhodes…”
Dr. Selvig fidgeted some more before walking briskly toward the entrance of his lab. He looked around anxiously before motioning for Natasha to following him to one of the consoles nearest to the back of the lab.
Having Steve agree to dinner with him had begun to subside any weird feeling he had about Steve practically rejecting him over the weekend, but now Tony was even more baffled than before with how Steve was currently acting. Tony told himself to push through it in order not to make a scene.
“Tony, just talk to him. I don’t know Steve as well as you do, but I can tell he really cares about you…”
Steve laughed quietly before turning Tony over some more to kiss him. “Yeah, I think it looks good on me, too.”
“Ugh, I’m just going to say it.” Steve said quickly, already embarrassed.
Steve scrunched up his face causing Tony to roll his eyes again. “You’ve heard of hyperbole before right, Rogers?”
Tony and Steve barely waited half a second as the vault door clicked as soon as Shuri reassembled the codes. The vault door opened slowly, but instead of revealing the team’s next objective, a gruff-looking Fury appeared with his arms crossed.
“What’s this material resource?” Clint asked as he crossed his arms.
Tony carefully jumped over some debris from the glass façade to get into his lab.
Rhodey and Pepper were dancing near the front next to Sam and Shuri. Bucky was laughing at Steve as he awkwardly danced with his friend and Clint was near the back of the balcony trying to get his wife Laura to dance, but he was too excitable while dancing.
Clint nearly jumped out of shoes as Natasha rolled her eyes. “I’m game!” Clint nearly exclaimed.
difference. Trust me.” He pointed to himself.
“As much as I would love to play spy with you, Rogers, I can’t ask you do to that.” Tony had appreciated the offer, well more than appreciated it, actually. But there was no way the board and Fury would be happy if they found out that he had dragged a fellow Synergy team member across the country to help him sabotage Obadiah.
“Right away, Sir.”
As soon as Steve opened the door to the apartment, Sam was in the middle of making coffee for himself in the kitchen. He turned around to face Steve, snickering as he cooled down his coffee.
Steve laughed as he patted his friend on the back.
Tony sighed as he moved his eyeglasses to pinch the bridge of his nose. “No, Steve. Don’t say that. I had a great time with you. I just…” Tony finally removed his eyeglasses before setting them down on a table next to him. He exhaled before scooting his chair closer toward Steve, who appeared both guilty himself, yet somber.
Tony, now trying to keep a straight face, shook his head as he stepped away from the bed to examine how much damage Steve had done to his face.
Pepper nodded, but she looked perplexed.
Tony thought to himself.
“I wasn’t playing with my phone. Important Stark Industries business, mind you.” Tony shoveled some food into his mouth to avoid talking any further.
“Tony, this is Bucky. Steve’s friend from when they were kids.” Sam motioned toward Bucky with his hand still on Tony’s back. Tony grinned, reaching out his hand to shake Bucky’s, but Bucky appeared hesitant.
Everyone shuffled around to find their lab buddy. Bruce clapped a hand onto Steve’s shoulder as he started asking him questions about any lab experience he might have had in the past. Steve did his best to answer, but besides not having any lab experience, he was still a tad overwhelmed by the magnitude of Synergy.
Tony appeared to be on the edge as well because his body began to shake as he rubbed himself before coming on himself and Steve. Steve leaned forward, holding onto Tony as he came inside, his movements sped up before they slowed down. He laid on top of Tony before sliding to the side, panting.
works.” He smiled widely, referring to the prototype Howard had made of the Synergy device.
Steve nodded before pointing to a file on the projected desktop above the console. “What’s this, Tony?”
“After you…” He offered clumsily.
Tony nodded as he felt Steve come inside of him before feeling himself come all over his chest. “Fuck,” Tony moaned as soon as his mouth was free, “I love you, too, Steve.”
“Is everyone talking about me? Am I really that obvious?” He tried for a playful tone, but he was sure he also sounded a little irritate, especially after being reminded that he was terrible when it came to relationships.
Fury had debriefed the team at S.H.I.E.L.D.’s headquarters. He had reassured the team that their good work with the Synergy device would be highlighted against the lab explosion, and that they were required to surrender their company materials and sensitive project information.
Tony didn’t think it was possible for his eyes to get any bigger. “Banner, if you weren’t a crucial member on this fucking team, I would fucking murder you. No scratch that, on second thought, I
Steve nodded, standing still for a moment as he watched the car drive away. He sighed to himself as he took the time to regain his composure before heading upstairs to his apartment. He knew Sam was never going to let this go.
Tony watched Steve eye him as if he didn’t believe him, but finally he nodded back. “I’m sorry…I guess I’m just trying to get use to this…” Steve responded quietly.
“Fine.” He answered, agonizingly, drawing out the word with anguish.
“Tony! It’s morning!”
There had to be something going on and now Tony was sure of it. He just wished Steve would be honest with him.
But as he approached, he stopped for a moment, suddenly realizing what all of this could mean.
Tony’s already practiced PR grin grew even wider as he waved. “I might have to get a new partner, Rogers. You’re upstaging me.”
He remembered that Tony’s lab was on the eastern side of the tower and headed in that direction. His nervousness dissipated as he imperceptibly continued breathing deeply. He knew by the time he reached the lab’s glass doors he would be at his A-game. Why many of the labs had glass faces was beyond Steve, but he didn’t know too much about lab design, so maybe it served a purpose.
Tony moved his hand on Steve’s waist to caress his face. Steve sighed. “I feel comfortable with you, though, Tony…”
his free time with Tony…and I don’t think he realizes that it’s annoying the shit out of me…”
Stark?” Clint clarified with a smirk.
In one of the nicer conference rooms, the team listened to Thor explain his brother’s possible whereabouts. Thor was standing at the front while everyone else was sitting in a chair surrounding the conference table.
Tony scoffed. “I don’t know, Bruce. When are you going to ask Natasha out on a proper date?” He sneered as soon as Bruce turned red from the comment.
“Someone at your party…” Steve looked downward at his shoes, “…well…basically…in a conversation during the party…ugh—someone, who was at the party, thinks we’re sleeping together.”
Steve thought as he watched Tony punch in some numbers on the screen to create the procedure, humming to himself quietly.
Tony weighed the possibility; he felt like talking but he feared that he might have a panic attack. He rubbed his chest as he looked away from Steve, just waiting for the pain to appear out of nowhere.
“Yeah, Cap. That’s rough…” Sam added.
above their pay grade.”
Tony smiled back, albeit not as wide as Steve, before shaking his head. “No, but thank you…”
Steve laughed as he let go of Tony. He rubbed Tony’s arms before limping to the other side of the kitchen.
Steve thought, although he trusted that whatever was bothering Tony wouldn’t affect the simulation.
Tony patted Steve on the shoulder. “This particular creation has been giving us trouble lately, but Peter managed to figure out how to get it to move. It’s science, Rogers!”
Steve laughed quietly. “I meant that mostly for myself…” He turned the device around and around in his hand before feeling his face as if it had already transformed.
As he entered the main cabin, Tony glanced around the space, taking in the scene before following Steve to their seats.
“Okay,” Tony fished a tablet out of his work bag, tapping a few times until he found the stolen files, “there are two buyers Obie’s been in contact with that we’ll meet at the event. I sent them a message after we took off to tell them to meet us there.”
Steve hung his head as he moved away from Tony, but he kept his hands on either side of his body.
Tony contorted his face, steeped in suspicion. “That’s not exactly what I meant, and you know it…” He stopped himself, relaxing his face before trying again,” you didn’t have to kiss me…
Tony grinned before answering. “I did. You?”
Sam appeared to be considering the proposal. “Only if you think you need to.”
Ever since he received the letter, Tony had convinced himself that Steve should have called him to apologize.
few, but they’re positive, nonetheless.” He leered at Thor then at Steve.
“What is that?” Steve asked as Tony walked up to the device.
“Wr400COS, delph23, epsilon2TAG…” J.A.R.V.I.S. began reading a series of random numbers and functions, but they had no logical order that Tony could understand right away.
Hey, Rogers. Meet me in the lab at 8am tomorrow. Looking forward to our first day.
“My goodness, Rogers. You’re an artist, a chef, and now
“Romanov and Barton?” Tony called.
“Fuck, Steve. I think I’m close…” Tony moaned.
Tony turned to look at Steve watching everyone else. “Uh, you know, you might be right, Rogers.” He acquiesced.
Tony stared at Steve’s back, thankful that the conversation hadn’t take an ugly turn, but was confused by Steve’s behavior. He would have thought by now that Steve would have said something about the way their relationship ended.
Tony held up a hand to get Hammer to stop talking. “Wait a minute. The core?”
Tony nodded as he readjusted his position. He understood where Bucky was coming from; before seeing Steve, Tony thought he was going to die alone while his friends met their soulmates.
“Why did I come with you to the store if you’re just going to be all weird and secretive?” Bucky joked.
“You did a great job today, baby. Especially in that press pool.” Tony whispered to Steve, holding tight against his body.
“Uh…okay…?”
Peter shook Steve’s hand as best as he could. “Nice to meet you too, Steve.”
Tony thought again, almost saying it out loud.
Steve scrunched up his face. He felt so miserable as he chewed over Obadiah’s accusation.
Tony scooted up the bed, hugging Steve against his body. “Besides the fact that I couldn’t really tell, it doesn’t matter, if you think I’ll be weird about it.”
Obadiah rocked back and forth on his heels as Thanos returned to his work. He waited patiently for the scientist to address him any further.
“It’s James Taylor.” Tony sneered, burying his head into Steve’s neck.
P.S. This chapter contains references to post-traumatic stress disorder and childhood neglect.
“Nothing.” Sam continued to grin as he pushed himself away from the counter.
Steve furrowed his brow. “The accident wasn’t Tony’s fault and you know that, Mr. Stane.” He glared at Obadiah who tried to reciprocate, but Steve was staring him down too intensely and it was obvious that Obadiah was becoming uneasy by it.
Loki whistled to himself as he emerged from his bathroom, heading to his kitchen to make something to eat. He continued to hum loudly as he whipped together a sandwich before hearing a ping from his tablet, signaling that he had received an email. The tablet was sitting on top of the table in the small area he had partitioned off for eating.
Steve stopped before turning to look at Tony. “Of course not, Tony. This is a top priority.”
“Well, I don’t mind talking to you Tony until you feel tired…” Steve offered, “actually…if you want…you can come over and we can talk in person…or I can come to you? I think I need the company, too…or whatever is fine…I just know how difficult it is for you to sleep sometimes, so I’m sure everything that’s happening is only making it worse…”
Steve nodded; it was obvious that Tony was attempting to open up to him more.
“You did
“I don’t think no is an option.” Steve answered in a cool, yet serious tone. He turned around to face Tony.
“I’m really sorry about you and Tony, Steve…” he paused, “…we should rally for Sam…”
"It's nothing I can't handle. I'll see you at the event tonight, okay?"
Tony could feel the temperature in his body raise, but he tried to remain calm in order not to get into it with one of his dearest friends.
“…fuck…okay…I
“…Tony…” Steve whispered, clenching the side of a pillow.
“Virginia? Tomorrow, I’ll be at the press event at Stark Tower before flying back to the conference to give a presentation on Anthony’s face thing…”
During the entire meal, Tony seemed wholly unbothered by his behavior that morning, chatting with Steve as if he didn’t just have an emotional break down a few hours earlier. Steve listened, trying to play along because he didn’t want to upset Tony again.
Steve nodded as he waited for Tony. Tony looked away again before looking back up at Steve.
Steve blushed. He shuffled around a little before answering. “Aw, well. Thank you, Tony.” He grew suddenly quiet as he tried to process this interaction.
Steve smiled at him again before continuing to eat and Tony’s heart nearly exploded.
Subject: CONFIDENTIAL
Tony moved his head slightly away to address Steve. “You wanna go to bed now?” He asked, although he didn’t sound as confident as he typically did.
Tony squirted some lube into the palm of his hand. “Also, let me know when or if you want to stop. It feels weird at first, but trust me, if you like it, you’ll be begging me to touch you like this always.”
“Look on the bright side, Rogers. It could have been
“That wasn’t too bad, wasn’t it?” Tony grinned at Steve.
Steve nodded. “When do you think we should leave?”
“She always gave me really good advice…but that time she told me that I need to listen as much as possible…sometimes I struggle with that…” He admitted; his expression was stern, but he was trying to smile.
“Steve,
“Hey, there’s our star player! Banner just told me you were up all night?” Tony greeted Shuri as she walked up to a coffee maker on a table in the corner of the space.
Tony finally smiled back, absent-mindedly looking in the direction of his bedroom. “Uh,” he laughed to himself as he ran a hand through his hair a couple times, “we could—wait sorry, are you hungry?”
Tony grinned. “Okay, good. We’re taking the newest jet which is in an undisclosed area in Queens. I haven’t installed the GPS tracker in it yet, but let’s try
“Is that it? Jesus, I thought you were going to tell me someone died.” Tony picked up the device again before spinning around to face one of the consoles. He chuckled a bit more before sighing to himself from laughing so hard.
They kissed each other for some time; taking their time, moving slowly. Tony moaned as he bit Steve’s bottom lip before using the opportunity to feel every inch of Steve’s lips. Steve squeezed him tighter, and Tony could feel him trying to hold onto him as gently as possibly, but it also felt like Steve would never let him go. Or possibly never leave him. He never felt this vulnerable with someone before.
Rhodes, I have no clue what’s going on with Steve. We slept together last night, like in the same bed. Help?
“Yeah, I’m down.” Tony offered casually as he unhooked himself from Steve to slide his hands into his pants pockets.
“Okay, I just need a final head count before sending the guest list to T’Challa for the bridal party thing…”
“Sorry, I’m really tired…” Tony tried.
Bucky sighed as he motioned toward the room. “Sam, he almost killed Steve. You can’t be okay with that.”
Tony grinned at Steve, but his internal turmoil turned his expression into a half grimace. “And risk you falling on your face in front of everyone—wait actually that might be really entertaining.”
The three of them worked quickly to disassemble the robot before wheeling it to the entrance of the gymnasium. As soon as they entered, they found the auditorium teeming with busy students, their parents, and the teachers. The group found a space for the robot in an unoccupied corner. Peter and Ned worked to reassemble their robot as Steve and Tony watched from the side.
Pepper shrugged again. “Okay. And did he say he ever was?”
Steve smiled. Something about this piece of information seemed to be the most private thing Tony had ever offered to share with him. He thought maybe he could take advantage of the intimacy.
Tony was taken aback. He remembered that there had been some fiasco related to planning that day, but he had forgotten that it had something to do with Pepper’s birthday. Yet, that couldn’t have been the reason why Pepper left. But before he could say anything Pepper continued.
“Oh man! Sorry, Mr. Stark, I gotta go!” She handed Tony the chip back.
“What the hell? Why does he always do this?” Clint folded his arms.
Steve watched Tony rush out of the room. He wasn’t sure if he should follow him or if he should leave the party. He sighed heavily as he sat down on the edge of the bed, hanging his head low, admonishing himself for not being straightforward with Tony.
“Wait, time out,” Tony physically crossed his hands to mime a time-out sign as he interrupted Steve, “you think it’s because I’m
“I think you look great.” Steve had turned to see that Tony was trying to keep a straight face.
“You know...you can be that way with me, Steve...” Tony practically whispered. His voice was shaking a little. He was anxious that Steve might reject him again, but for some reason he felt overly confident in the moment.
“Is this about your ex?” Sharon interrupted, but she sounded calm.
Tony slowly withdrew his hand from the back of Steve’s chair before accepting the map. Steve mentally exhaled with relief.
Steve walked into the foyer as the doors opened. He walked through the suite until he found Tony standing out on the balcony, sipping from a glass of water. Steve took in two deep breaths before walking out onto the balcony, stopping short at the entrance.
As soon as the elevator reached the lobby, the doors popped open with Bruce walking out ahead of Tony.
Tony punched the button to open the doors, nearly tripping and taking Steve down with him as they entered the corridor. As their kiss grew even more passionate, Steve made it difficult for them to get to the private elevator which was just on the other side of the corridor, but Tony didn’t mind. They made out for a minute or so outside of the elevator before Tony managed to drag them inside. Steve was all over him as Tony struggled to open up the fingerprint scanner for the tech to confirm his identity. He managed to get the print scanned as he pried himself away before returning to Steve.
“…he’s escalating…” Loki began to explain, “…only the people closest to him would have this information…if they sent
Needless to say, Tony was annoyed that he had to meet with Hammer; it seemed as if Hammer Industries' business model was to copy everything Stark Industries produced so it wasn’t a surprise to him that a fired Stark Industries employee had went to work for Hammer.
“Come in!” Tony yelled, more annoyed with Obadiah than anything else.
Bucky laughed. “I’m always right, Steve.” He half hugged Steve with his free hand.
“Virginia, please. You’re not
“I’m going to divide the team up. Two-person mini teams to a lab.” Fury pointed to Clint then to Natasha. “Barton, you’re with Romanov.” Clint smirked at Natasha who returned the expression.
“Can you please send me these?” Tony tapped on the phone after returning it to Pepper’s desk. He hopped out of the chair to exit Pepper’s office, stopping at the doorway to look back at her.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Rhodes needs to chill more often. Besides all the shit that’s happened so far, the device is
Tony shook his head, stopping on the other side of the room with his hands on his hips. He then spun around with an outstretched arm, pointing to the door.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked as he watched Tony stretch.
Steve laughed as he looked over at Peter who was tinkering with the robot. His eyes then scanned the entire lab: it looked as if Tony and Peter had been camping out in the space for days. Steve crossed his arms as he glared at Tony who was too busy chomping on a cookie while scrolling through data on a tablet.
Steve made a small noise of strained agreement which prompted Tony to turn around somewhat.
“I-I…Steve…” Tony reached out toward Steve before shrinking back into the couch, “…I’m sorry, I just thought—”
Tony laughed as he rummaged through the drawer to find the thing he was looking for. He produced a small tube, but his hand was covering the label. Tony returned to straddling Steve, grinning as he popped open the cap.
“And where did you receive
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat; he had never seen Tony this exhausted. Steve knew he needed to apologize for calling his lab partner reckless and questioning his loyalty to the team.
“Then, we’ll celebrate again when I’m back in town for your graduation.” Bucky motioned toward Steve and winked before he gave the waitress the same order from before.
Tony patted Peter on the back a few more times which caused the teenager to wince from the extended attention that made him feel like a little kid again.
“And don’t run, please! Or I’ll sell that robot you made for parts!” Tony called after.
Tony had acknowledged him once or twice while in the group. Something about it still felt timid, but Steve thought it was more related to Tony’s personality than anything else. Honestly, he was looking forward to getting the chance to work in Tony’s lab. Their short encounter together provided Steve with enough information to figure out a strategy to effectively engage Tony and any of his quirks.
every day to learn a new thing. Today I had to learn five.”
kidding me, Steve?” Tony instantly became angry as he marched toward Steve, snatching the diary out of his hands, “I told you to get rid of this!”
“Please slow down. I’m also making dinner later tonight, so pace yourselves.” Steve huffed as he watched his family ignore him.
“I know that’s not true. You talk about Steve all the time. And I see the way you look at him.”
He stuck out his hand for Peter to shake. “Nice to meet you, Peter.”
“You’re going to scratch up my car inching back and forth like this.” Tony sighed just as loudly as Peter had done as he leaned up against the window. His body jerked with the movement of the car.
“Steve, it’s really okay if you don’t want to do this.” Tony whispered.
“Steve, it’s all right,” Sharon laughed quietly to herself, but to Steve she didn’t seem upset, “I don’t know if he said anything to you…but Bucky said something to me about him…just how close you guys were before you broke up…I think he just wanted me to be aware…”
Tony eyed him before answering. “What? T’Challa’s too cheap to have food at this party?” He teased.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Excuse me.” Steve said politely to the hurried individual, but he didn’t respond as Steve watched the man jog down the sidewalk.
Something about Tony’s expression still had its usual flare for the press, yet something about it suggested something else. Steve wasn’t quite sure what it entirely meant, but he wasn’t turned off by it at all. Actually, he found himself drawn to it and, by extension, Tony.
“Rogers, it might be best to start a pile of shit I’m definitely throwing out and things to keep. Maybe a pile to reassess items…” Tony was calling for Steve from the other side of the kitchen.
Steve then limped to the tub, turning the water on, running it for a while until it reached the desired temperature. He then steadied himself before emerging his entire body underneath the water, letting out a relaxed exhale as he sank to the bottom. Steve closed his eyes, letting the warm water soothe his muscles.
“Come on, Rogers.” Tony whispered, as he looped an arm around Steve’s, “we’re going to be late.”
“…uh…yeah…” Tony managed, “…I guess that makes sense…”
Tony shook his head before trying to counter. “I’m not self-sabotaging, Pep. I’m being cautious.”
cute about it, Banner…”
The door narrowly propped open; Steve’s head poked into the room. He looked concerned. Tony exhaled to himself as he realized it was only Steve.
Tony glanced at Pepper, thinking back to what Obadiah had inferred about their failed relationship. He couldn't bring himself to discuss it with her, especially since it had taken him forever to be comfortable around Pepper again before he started dating Steve. Tony eventually shook his head as the elevator door opened.
started seeing each other…” Tony croaked out, rolling his eyes in the process. Steve nodded; he was close enough to Tony’s neck so that the latter could feel him.
“Hey, I’m just glad we managed to get Steve out to celebrate.” Sam smiled at Steve as he raised his glass toward his friend who returned the gesture.
Bruce shook his head. “Tony? Destroy it? But we can use it—”
Thank you for inviting me. Peter probably needed the break from me anyway🤪
“Well, it literally looks like a bomb went off…” Tony placed his head in his hands.
Bruce shrugged. “Nothing…I’m just worried about you, that’s all.” He barely missed a beat as he returned to his work.
Steve nodded before following Bucky out onto the balcony where a table and a few chairs were set up for their brunch.
“My team is experienced. What do you have that they don’t?” The officer inquired with her arms crossed again. She tapped her sunglasses against her folded arm.
However, during a good part of the week before the board presentation, Tony had noticed that Steve was basically ignoring him. He had been going back and forth with himself, thinking that he probably shouldn’t ask Steve out for dinner. This mental entanglement was the reason why Tony thought he had trouble with the calculations during the simulation. Thankfully, Steve had been quick enough to keep the device from shaking uncontrollably while also covering his ass.
“Actually, this one is
“Hey, Tony.” Buck offered quietly as he crossed his arms, leaning against the doorframe, “Steve isn’t here by the way.”
“Well…,” Steve started as he studied the sequences before looking over at Tony who was grinning at him, “I’m not entirely sure, but I think the sequence you chose Peter probably works best.”
Steve nodded with a smile. “Yeah, of course.”
Tony turned around, thankful that Shuri was there to prevent any serious relationship conversations that could inevitably ruin the entire day.
“You’ll be fine. Also don’t talk about work. It’s cute sometimes, but not all the time.” Tony wagged a finger at his friend before turning to face a console.
Tony wondered.
Suddenly a loud thud nearly caused Steve to jump out of his shoes. He inched closer toward the glass, gazing through to see what had made that horrible noise.
“So, I’ll probably have you stationed over at this console, but I may move you after learning more about the device after we test it a few more times.” Bruce shuffled around Steve, moving back and forth between various-sized consoles. He picked up a few gadgets, turned them over and over, before setting them down in different locations.
Tony nodded, moving one finger to tap on the tablet he was holding but he stopped, “hold on,” Tony ran toward the robot, producing a tool to fix some wiring Peter had missed on his first scan.
“Tony, why are you doing this?” Steve followed Tony to the door.
Sounds good! Looking forward to it also.
Steve nodded. He was crossing his arms now and Tony could tell he was waiting patiently for him to continue.
Tony perked up. He finally realized that Bruce and Peter were staring at him while he was drafting messages to Steve on his phone.
“I’m impressed that she managed to comprehend some of my dad’s more esoteric notes. I’ve been pouring over those for a year now.”
“Open brackets: Six, nine, hundred, delta, epsilon, seventy-eight, hundred, closed brackets.” Tony was relentless. Steve fumbled as he punched in the code from the second set. He had never felt so nervous in his entire life, which included serving in the military. He wished they had practice learning the keys on the device first before trying it out in the simulation.
“Virginia? Excuse me, you can see that I’m in the middle of something…”
mentor. You’re aware of my past relationship with the tabloids, right?” Tony tried to free himself from Fury’s grasp, but it proved to be too much of an effort. He settled on leaning into it, just enough to maybe make Fury feel a little uncomfortable.
Mr. Beck shook his head, seemingly unaware that he was upsetting Tony. “No. Peter’s one of my better students and he’s a really good kid. I never had behavioral issues with him. So, I’m going to let him retake the test.”
Tony chuckled as he walked around Steve to look at him from behind. “But you did such a great job last time.”
Tony motioned with his hands again. “I made up a fake name for myself and Steve…and I used this thing I invented to change our genetic makeup…,” Pepper groaned loudly with a curt “Tony!”, yet Tony pressed on, “but, I think they knew we were going to meet them. The transaction seemed too abrupt.”
“Just that Tony Stark seems as much of a jerk as his celebrity personae.” Bucky scoffed. Steve had told his friend over the phone how unapproachable Tony had appeared during the interview. And of course, Bucky had been more annoyed than Steve.
“Uh, oh wow…uh…1958?” Tony attempted.
Steve nodded. “I think we’re better at conversation than that, Tony.” Tony laughed as he let Steve walk ahead of him into the café.
Pepper sniffled. She wiped her eye before smiling. “Tony, it’s okay. I’ve accepted that you weren’t comfortable discussing it with me.”
Steve stared at Tony, not entirely sure what he could add to the conversation, while still trying to wrap his head around the possibility of experiencing multiple orgasms.
Steve cleared his throat. “My graduation ceremony is next weekend. I have an extra ticket.”
No wonder Tony was so attached to Peter; his relationship with his own father had been the mirror opposite. Steve thought about keeping the diary away from Tony; he couldn’t let it be destroyed. Part of him thought that maybe if he showed Tony how much his father tried, maybe Tony would find some peace.
“Okay, Tone,” Rhodey was pointing behind himself as Tony looked around anxiously, “Pep’s going to get everyone’s attention before you go up…”
“Well, yeah I guess it’s nice having
Tony’s eyes widened from the unexpected provocation, clearly surprised by Steve’s forwardness. Without further delay, Tony quickly removed his clothes before jumping in the tub, but before he stepped in, he turned around to ran back to the bathroom door.
“Are you sure?”
Steve nodded again, making sure Tony was stable before jumping up to run over to the device. The device was shaking wildly, more so than it had ever done in the past. Steve searched around until he found the slot for the chip, inserting it as firmly as possible. After a few seconds, the device stopped shaking, but it continued glowing an assortment of colors to indicate that it was compromised.
“I am
Tony’s eyes widened. He slowly placed the device on the table in front of him as he rose out of his chair.
Sam smirked. “Okay, that’s how you do it nowadays.”
Steve walked over to the couch as Tony was loudly explaining his latest project to Bruce. As he sat down, Tony immediately turned around, pulling him into a half hug. Steve half hugged him back.
Tony looked up at the sink before rising slowly. He walked up to the counter, looking at himself in the mirror before running some water to splash onto his face.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Ton—”
"Actually, Anthony…" Obadiah placed his sandwich down on his plate before wiping his hands off with a napkin, "I'm glad I have you here alone—”
Steve stopped short of the threshold.
Steve yanked away from Tony, feeling himself losing his temper as he tried to get out of the shower. He felt Tony grab his arm, but Steve yanked away from him again, angry with himself and Tony.
“Yeah, Buck!” Sam called back as he walked toward his seat next to Bucky, “just don’t get too crazy. We have several days to get through.
“Jesus Christ…” Was all Tony could manage.
Steve shook his head. “I know I’m not an expert when it comes to dating but that’s what this sounds like.” At this point, Steve was close to the middle of the bed. Tony had scooted closer toward him, albeit cautiously.
Steve then took a firm hold of Tony before flipping them over so that Tony was now lying on his back. Tony scooted around in the bed so that they were lying lengthwise, wrestling with his shirt before yanking Steve’s off his body.
He walked past one of the Synergy labs and peered inside. There, he saw Natasha and Clint talking to one another, both holding a cup of coffee. They waved at him before continuing their conversation. Steve waved back and pressed on toward his own lab—or Tony’s lab.
“This is incredible.”
“Rogers, take this.” Tony handed Steve the device as they both rushed out of the lab. Steve hesitated a moment; although he was now comfortable with the controls, he wasn’t sure he should be the one handling such a delicate device on their first outing.
Hey! Trying to get myself to engage more than just posting and leaving it. :p So my apologies...I'm nervous about being annoying! But I also wanted to thank everyone who's been reading so far, you all make my day :)
“Very funny, Buck.” Steve rolled his eyes as his friends continued to laugh at his expense.
The board member looked back and forth between Rhodey and Tony before cracking a slight smile. He then began to laugh hysterically.
“Jesus, Banner,” Tony slapped a hand to his forehead, “I was having sex with Steve. We were fucking, not eating. You’re so nosy.”
“Hey! I think that’s Tony Stark!”
“I’m really glad we decided to do this, baby…” Tony whispered tilting his head upward for another kiss, “…we were always great together in bed and we can avoid all the stupid relationship drama…”
It had been like this for the last few days. Whatever tension that had settled between them before had returned and Tony feared it was getting worse.
Steve nodded as he watched Tony climb into the bed, taking a moment before sliding back to his side. Tony turned onto his side away from Steve, trying to settle. He felt Steve wrap a hand around his waist to draw him close against his body. Tony counted to himself to calm down, fearing that Steve would say something. Instead, Steve remained silent as he held Tony against his body.
Steve inhaled then exhaled deeply. He turned slightly away from Tony. “If you hadn’t stopped us, we probably would have had sex. Don’t tell me you don’t remember that.”
Steve took his time approaching him. “Tony…we just saw him. He knows you went on a trip for a couple days…”
too much with Rhodey one night while relaxing with a beer or two, which explains why Rhodey already knew Steve’s hair color.
“…if I come all over you like that, then it was more than okay.”
Steve nodded in Natasha’s direction which was returned with a steady nod, but it was accompanied with a kind smile that was a bit on the sly side.
But before Riri could explain, her phone rang Beyoncé’s “I Miss You” on the loudest volume possible. Riri took her phone out of her coat pocket before tapping on it a few times.
If Steve hadn’t already been embarrassed, he definitely felt like crawling in a hole for the rest of his life now. Sam slumped down next to his friend, handing him the coffee mug, laughing lightly as he leaned against the couch. Steve looked at his friend; he could tell Sam was just kidding, but he was still mortified.
“Okay gang,” Steve stopped the car right in front of the school’s gymnasium behind the truck Tony drove to transport the robot to the school’s fair, “let’s roll out.”
Tony looked curiously at Steve. “Keep track of me?”
Tony twisted his neck to glare at Steve. He was already annoyed that he was right that his employees, and possibly Obadiah, were trying to sabotage Synergy, but for some reason his annoyance and Steve’s otherwise innocent statement reminded him of the argument over the failsafe.
“Then what is it?” Before Tony could formulate his reasonings, Steve jumped in, “I know we had our rough periods, especially the issue with the weapons manufacturing thing and going behind your back with your dad’s diary, but I thought this was…is serious…” His voice trailed off.
The accusation made Steve’s face wrinkle. “Me? I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Only for your benefit, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. responded.
Tony took a moment, trying to suppress his irritation, before motioning for Steve to hand him the bag containing the Synergy device.
Tony’s body suddenly went still before he slowly turned around to face Steve. He looked solemn now; the cocky expression on his face had become stern.
“Yeah, well…” Tony threw his hands up into the air as he started pacing again.
“Sorry…” Steve breathed out. He held still before sliding his hand away from Tony’s back to lean up against the side of the elevator.
“Mondays. Am I right?” Tony added.
“Hey, Banner.” Tony greeted as he entered the main space. The set up wasn’t as luxurious as the labs at Stark Tower, but the space was equipped with all of the basic amenities that would come with working in a Stark Industries lab.
Steve licked him some more before moving down his stomach, kissing Tony until he stopped at his hardening cock. Steve looked up at Tony, smiling before pushing down the fabric of his boxers. He rubbed Tony for some time, feeling him all over with one hand before replacing his hand with his mouth.
“That’s wonderful, Tony!” Pepper nearly exclaimed, although Tony knew she was already aware of his relationship with Steve.
Tony thought.
“Radio!” Tony called.
“Sir, your readings appear to show that you are fatigued. Would you like for me to turn the lights off now?” J.A.R.V.I.S. asked.
Steve nodded slowly but his face betrayed his puzzlement.
“That’s because Steve likes me better.” Peter joked as he motioned for Tony to resume their positions underneath the robot.
Tony’s body violently jerked him awake. He sat up panting, sweating, clenching his chest as if his heart would burst into a million little pieces at any moment. Reminding himself to inhale then exhale deeply, Tony looked over to other side of his bed, which was empty of course.
Bruce motioned with his hands. “Okay, okay. I get it. But I’m here if you want to talk, okay?”
“Steve…” Tony started, wringing his hands, “I should have told you this instead of giving you a hard time about Bucky…”
“So, I was talking to Bruce the other day and he let me go through the archived Synergy files from a few years ago, and I found this…” Peter slid the square object across the table toward Steve and Tony. Both looked at each other before Tony picked up the thing and unwrapped it. As he slowly revealed the gift, both he and Steve made the most surprised reactions.
Tony rolled his eyes. “The charge on the new Stark X is terrible. I need to hang out at Steve’s a bit longer then I’ll probably call a car.”
“Don’t make it too obvious.” Steve added. At first his tone was lighthearted, but then it regressed.
“Oh yeah. Sam complains about the charge on this all the time. I think he has an extra charger. Hold on.”
“Okay, I’ll see you on Monday then…” He answered, his voice lowering.
And Steve. Tony groaned. What was it about this whole thing with Steve that was driving him senseless? Okay, so at the dinner, Steve seemed into whatever vibe Tony had picked up toward the end. They went home together, even if it was for some cake. Steve brought up Bucky—Tony groaned again. But Steve
Steve criticized himself. He quickly replied to Sam to let him know that he’ll be home a little later and that the trip was fine. And of course, it hadn’t been; Tony would barely speak to him the entire trip back. To Steve, it almost felt as if his partner was struggling with beginning a conversation but Steve figured that their relationship had so deteriorated from his antics at the event that now they could hardly communicate on small talk terms. Steve no longer felt the camaraderie he used to feel with Tony, and it was making him feel terrible.
Both friends were leaning up against the railing. Bucky was holding a half-empty bottle of beer, while Steve was drinking a glass of water. After hanging out at the informal graduation party at the bar with Tony, the three friends went back to the apartment in Brooklyn to capitalize on Bucky’s visit before he left in the morning to finish the rest of his tour.
Tony held his hands up in halting position. “Sorry, everyone. I’m not here to give a speech. But,” he pointed to the exits, “I do need everyone to calmly walk out of the space. We have reason to believe that this place is rigged with a highly unstable explosive…”
Steve looked directly at Bucky who was expressing his sincerity.
Steve smiled to himself—just another innocent opportunity to get to know your lab mate better, right?—before following the rest of his team down the hallway.
Tony stared down at Steve’s hand, not entirely sure what to do. But after a moment, he finally reached out, taking a hold of Steve’s hand. They held hands for some time before their waiter appeared with their food.
Steve’s face contorted a few times as he tried to process the moment. “…you can’t be serious, Tony…” He thought he had mumbled his response to himself, but it was obvious that Tony had heard him; Tony’s otherwise cheerful disposition quickly faded.
Steve opened the door to his bedroom before sitting on the edge of his bed. As soon as he sat down, he hung his head low with a sigh. He found his phone in his pocket, staring at it as he seriously considered cancelling dinner plans.
Before responding, Tony sat back in the booth once more; he had been sure that the moment he heard Pepper had started seeing someone else, the idea would destroy him, but now it barely fazed him. Actually, the more he thought about it, as he felt his face morph into a sincere smile, the idea made him happy for both of his friends.
“Steve, just call him.”
“Uh,” Tony shrugged, “how was the rest of the trip?” He asked as he crossed his arms.
“Whoa! Time-out. No one said anything about assault.” Tony held up a “time-out” sign before wrapping his hands around Steve’s waist with a grin.
“Uh, sorry…” Bruce muttered, readjusting his glasses as he held out a hand, indicating that Natasha could pass in front of him.
Tony turned his head slowly to glare at Obadiah. "Fuck you, Obie."
“…um, yes…” Steve finally answered, “but—”
“Hi, Tony!” Peter walked into the bedroom before sitting on the edge of the bed.
They walked past a huge group of nicely dressed people gathered near the front of the mansion where valets were ushering people inside. Tony took a moment to observe his surroundings, just to see if anyone else he knew had been invited to the party. Strangely, he didn’t recognize any of Stark Industries’ usual competitors, which signaled to him that maybe Obadiah was dealing with either a new buyer or someone working on the black market.
Steve eyed his friends before rising from the table. “Could you send me the details for the party so I can send them to Tony, Sam?”
Pepper motioned with her hands for Tony to keep his voice down. “Everything Obadiah said about the termination and the arrest checked out. Loki’s lab hadn’t been producing anything substantial, and he stole some equipment…that’s why Obadiah had him arrested…”
Steve could tell from the sound in Tony’s voice that he was grinning downward at him. He inhaled deeply as he nodded, still feeling his body rock into the bed. He felt Tony rocking on top of him before squeezing his ass which caused Steve to suck in an air of breath.
Bucky snickered as Tony chuckled. They quickly glanced at each other before facing Sam.
“Sorry it took me so long. I had to run the sequences again…” Tony continued to shout, thinking Steve and Peter could hear him from wherever they were in the penthouse. He shed his jacket before walking toward the kitchen.
“Okay, you can come in now.” The doctor motioned for them to enter.
“Please don’t tell me there’s nothing else.” Fury interrupted.
Bruce chuckled. “So, what do you think of Steve, Tony?” Tony knew Bruce had picked up on his interest in their newest team member early on that day, especially when Tony was trying to talk to Steve as casually as possible, yet he sounded strangely inept at the same time. Bruce had also caught Tony staring at Steve once or twice.
Tony glanced over at Steve again. He mouthed the words “I’m sorry” at Steve who shook his head, mouthing back “it’s okay”.
Tony crossed his arms, waiting behind Steve before joining him closer to the center.
Tony had been working on the suits for some years now, but he never had the opportunity to test them out in the field; instead, he had been testing the suits out in the simulation suite.
Loki scoffed as he leaned inward slowly, grinning slightly. “Oh yeah? If you’re
“Look,” Loki tried shifting his body weight to get more comfortable, but the restraints holding his arms to the table were making it difficult for him to move, “I don’t know how many times I have to tell you people, but that’s all I know!”
“I…was in an ad…thing once for the military.” Steve answered reluctantly, hoping that would satisfy Tony.
Steve sighed. “I woke up in Tony’s bed this morning…” He began.
Shuri nodded, tapping on her earpiece to connect to the rest of the group.
Rhodey laughed, but his gaze lingered on Tony. “Tone, don’t fight it. Steve’s good for you and vice versa.”
Bucky perked up. “He came to your graduation today. Also, Sam said something about the two of you sleeping together—”
Steve flinched with excitement coupled with a dash of annoyance.
“First this swarm and then the next at a sit down. You think you handle it, Rogers?” Tony teased.
Tony moved his head to the side as Steve continued to kiss him, now moving to Tony’s neck then the underside of his chin.
“You can’t be okay with this.” Gamora responded.
Steve sucked in a breath of air, biting his bottom lip as he turned to face a smiling Tony again. He noted to himself the change intimacy as he resettled. He scooted closer toward Tony who did the same, looking at each faintly for a second or so before moving closer, so close that their faces were only an inch away. Tony breathed deeply before reaching out a hand to caress the back of Steve’s neck. Steve closed his eyes as he accepted a kiss from Tony.
“I like the one above!” Peter exclaimed, “what do you think, Steve?”
Tony tried to smile back, thinking back to when he became emotional after being with Steve. He coughed a few times, shuffling back and forth on his feet.
Tony hustled as quickly as possible toward his office without making a scene but was soon stopped by a hand tenderly squeezing his shoulder.
“Hey, what’s so funny?” Sam had appeared out on the balcony.
But as Steve filed through the memory of his past actions, Tony ended up scooting closer toward him instead, slowly closing the gap.
Clint smiled weakly at her. “Nat…it’s good seeing you…” He squeaked out.
Gamora removed her goggles, feeling the weight of the ramifications associated with letting her father get too far with his super weapon.
“Cool…uh, let’s try to finish something today, shall we?” Tony teased halfheartedly.
He straightened up suddenly as he continued. “I woke up thinking about Tony, you know…,” Steve made a few gestures with his hands as if that explained he had woken up to humping Tony’s mattress, “J.A.R.V.I.S. is also programmed in his room. Ugh. J.A.R.V.I.S., Sam?! I’m so embarrassed.”
spoil Steve, but he wanted to make sure Steve got to know him before being showered mercilessly with gifts.
Strange chuckled. “Like I said, it’ll be a while before you’re back on your feet, Stark.”
“Peter,” Tony turned over on his other side, “are you aware of the time?” He had just fallen asleep only an hour ago.
Tony tapped on his earpiece. “Okay, great. We just generated the S.H.I.E.L.D. tracker…” he motioned for Shuri and Bruce to set up the tracking device.
“I would say as soon as we break. And just for a couple hours.” Fury circled their destination before rolling up the map to hand to Tony.
“You need to keep that to yourself, Banner!”
“Wanna have dinner tonight? I had promised Peter I would stop by when back in town.” Rhodey continued to examine Steve’s file. He made a few pleased-sounding noises as he flipped through page after page.
Fury looked at Agent Hill before looking at the projection, his expression changing quickly as he read the data.
Steve’s mind dwelled on the memories until he was interrupted by a soft knock at his door. He flailed around trying to delicately hide the chip in the desk again before answering the knock.
“Hey,” Tony’s voice interrupted Steve’s concentration, “you wanna get out of here?”
Alternative universe set several years after the main events of
Bruce took a moment before putting his glasses back on. “I get why would you say that, but Steve, Tony’s been more open with you than he has with any of his friends, and that’s including me and Rhodey and he’s known Rhodey since college."
“It’s okay. Stay as long as you want.” He rushed out of the room toward his home office, leaving Steve in a state of frustration and confusion.
Steve smiled and waved as he approached the car. Tony was standing next to it with the door open, looking shocked that Steve had followed him outside.
Tony chuckled, but it didn’t sound as jovial as usual. He glanced quickly at Steve before returning to his work.
Tony wasn’t sure how to articulate how he was feeling without further ruining his relationship with Steve. Tony could feel them growing distant, but he had trouble trying to be honest with himself. He did love Steve and he didn’t want to lose him.
Both women nodded at the other before Whoberis rounded the desk to grab a tablet, seemingly ignoring Steve and Tony’s overt antics.
“Do you have enough room, Tony?” Steve whispered softly, but it was clear after a minute or so of total silence that Tony had already drifted off to sleep.
“See, naughty Steve.”
Steve winced; he had been sure that the only people who knew about Clint was himself and the rest of the team who had just learned about it that morning.
“Um…” Steve started.
“Shit!” Bruce tapped on the tablet, “the device….it…the reactionary blast…”
Tony had been more than annoyed that he had to let Dr. Selvig go; the scientist had been one of his best, but Tony couldn’t allow him to work at Stark Industries after possibly putting innocents in danger when he tampered with the device. Tony had hoped that questioning Dr. Selvig had led to incriminating Obadiah somehow, but any evidence of Obadiah’s involvement was barely circumstantial. Besides what Pepper had managed to find out about the buyers and Loki’s termination, Tony still didn’t have enough proof to fire his former mentor.
episode. He had no idea that Stark Industries had the technology to create actual simulations.
As he felt the pain in his chest again, Tony spun around to face the counter once more. He kept counting in his head as he plated dinner, taking his time before turning around again to settled next to Steve at the island.
“From the beginning…” Steve began again, “Tony’s been cautious about the team’s safety. He wanted to end the program after Clint’s attack…” He motioned toward Clint who attempted to physically shrink away in his chair from the heated debate between Steve and Obadiah.
“…fuck…” Tony let out as he stopped fingering himself to place both hands on Steve’s chest.
Tony chuckled again. “Let me hold you a bit longer then we can clean up before going to bed…” He whispered.
Tony’s body went rigid as he pushed himself up and away from Steve, practically jumping off the bed.
“Ha, it appears that the details of the project are still under wraps, yet we can tell you that it looks like we’ll be hearing more about the Synergy device in the future.”
“Uh,” Tony told himself he just needed to focus on Steve, “…I’m glad my original plan of blaming your recovery to avoid this event is finally paying off so we can leave early.”
Natasha shook her head as she looked at Shuri who also looked spent. “Nothing. If someone doctored the tapes, they did a much better job this time around.”
Bruce held a finger to his lips, nodding toward Tony to get Peter to play along with him. The nine-year old quickly caught on.
“You know, Tony. You should really relax. I’m better with kids than you think.” Tony appreciated Rhodey’s levity, but he could also feel his chest constricting with panic.
Tony paused before nodding wordlessly, now feeling ridiculous although he knew Bruce was only trying to help.
Fury sighed as he crossed his arms again. “We don’t know the full details yet. He’s at Mount Liberty, though. Strange is his main doctor and I’ve been told his vitals are great and he’ll be okay…”
Tony nodded as he sat up more in the bed. “Yeah,” he smiled a little, “he also said he wouldn’t mind having you over for breakfast, so it might be easier for you to just stay…”
Tony cringed before letting out a weird cough, shuffling around meaninglessly before he answered Steve.
Steve sighed. “No, things aren’t working out…we talked last night…so we’re not seeing each other anymore…”
“But I’ll leave it alone. I’ll see you in a few hours.”
Steve let Tony pull his face to look at him directly. He told himself it wasn’t a big deal, finding it easier to do so from Tony’s energy. He nodded back to indicate that he understood.
Tony laughed as he pushed down harder into Steve, moaning loudly. Steve could feel himself coming to the brink, arriving there faster than he had ever before. Something about the suddenness of feeling Tony against him underneath water was driving him wild.
“How long was I asleep?” He asked, still dazed.
Tony shook his head again as he crossed his arms; he was close to tears. “You should’ve told me when I invited you.”
After the press event, Steve had surprised Tony by actually following through with the two of them spending more time together to work on their friendship. They had made plans one afternoon while working at Stark Enterprises, but Tony was still conflicted: although he felt that maybe somehow he could get Steve back, it seemed as if during their conversation Steve was truly looking for a friendship and that maybe his relationship with Sharon was leaning more toward the serious side than anything causal.
“Okay, okay,” Tony waved a hand around, “we get
Steve kissed Tony on the lips before moving his head to kiss him on his neck. He moved all Tony’s shoulder before moving downward, stopping to feel his chest, taking his time as he then leaned in more to lick Tony’s nipples. Tony’s breath hitched as soon as Steve’s tongue made contact with his hard nipples, pushing upward more as he held onto Steve.
“Jesus, I should have introduced you as my no-nonsense bodyguard.” Tony snorted.
"Let's check on the food."
Tony laughed louder as he patted Steve on the back a little too hard. “Like if I go into a coma or,” he drew a finger across his throat, contorting his face as if someone had strangled him to death.
Thor was standing at the front of a smaller conference room facing Tony, Steve, Clint, Bruce, and Shuri. Tony had informed the rest of the team that Loki was responsible for planting the explosive the day of the explosion at the police precinct, and Thor had been ranting about the update ever since.
Steve wondered to himself as his ears strained even more without making it obvious he was eavesdropping.
Steve’s face flushed as he jogged to the front of the store, but Bucky took his time following him, laughing all the way up to the register, out the store, and back to their apartment, while also giving Steve flack for keeping him in the dark about his evolving sex life.
Tony patted Bruce on the shoulder. “Okay, let’s wait for the rest of the team to get here. In the meantime, let’s figure what we need to get people off this island.”
Steve had barely sent the text before Sam fired back a reply.
Tony straightened up before shuffling downward to get off the bed. He took a moment before rising to face Steve.
Steve smiled as best as he could. He pushed his body into Tony, pulling him closer toward his chest.
“Mr. Stark! It’s nice to see you. How’s your evening?” The guard asked enthusiastically.
“Would you…” Steve started, “like to get out of here?”
“During this test,” Mr. Beck pointed to the one with the “F”, “I caught Peter cheating.”
“See, this is why I keep you around, Parker. Is Rhodey here yet?” Tony asked, making sure Peter didn’t see him looking distastefully at the stripped shirt as he straighten up to study it.
Bruce waited before rising out of his chair. He smiled downward at Tony. “I know you don’t want to hear this, but you’re stronger than you think, Tony. And I think having Steve with you will only help.”
“As you all know, Project Synergy was abandoned over a year ago. However, if you know anything about Tony Stark, you should expect the unexpected…”
Tony laughed loudly. “Don’t worry about it, Rogers. It was hot.” Tony closed his eyes as he moved in closer for another kiss. Steve let him kiss his bottom lip before he kissed Tony back.
Steve didn’t wait to find out what the others thought. He promptly marched out of the space before anyone could stop him.
Tony took a moment before clearing his throat. “So, uh, I’m planning to get dinner with Pepper next weekend…” He started as he placed his fork next to his plate before clasping his hands together, looking over at Steve.
nerve about being honest, Captain Rogers.” He crossed his arms again.
Clint shrugged. “Nat, I know you don’t want to hear this, but you’re probably going to have to make the first move.” Although his statement was earnest, his voice shook from fatigue.
Tony rolled his eyes as he slid his phone into the breast pocket of his jacket. "And what about it? I'm taking Steve."
Peter began detailing another one of his adventures with Ned until Tony found a moment to talk about the upcoming promotional tour.
Dr. Selvig’s eyes widened. “I did, but…” his voice trailed off before he could explain further.
“…he stopped moving…” Bruce’s voice cracked, “I…don’t think…he’s going to make it…”
Obadiah seized the moment as he grinned at Tony. “Speaking of Mr. Rogers. Part of the board’s decision is resting on the fact that
Tony had been more than supportive as they readied themselves before making their way to the space connecting the backstage to the main stage which was facing a huge crowd of people waiting to hear about the device. Steve had never seen anything like it; he had never attended a design expo, let alone one on this magnitude. It was both simultaneously thrilling and jarring.
Tony groaned. “Rogers, just relax and let me do the heavy lifting.”
Steve winced. “Sorry…” He knew Tony was joking but he didn’t want him to think he wasn’t taking the situation seriously.
And Steve. Tony groaned; Steve was so understanding but Tony knew he was too much of a mess to handle.
Tony’s eyes widened as he suddenly remembered firing several employees a while back who had been trading company secrets with rival companies.
Tony thought to himself as he followed Steve inside. Surprisingly, something about the thought didn’t freak Tony out this time; having Steve over the last week or so had been easy and wonderful. It felt like the three of them were really a family.
Obadiah’s eyes widened as he looked back and forth between Nebula and Thanos again. “What? But, uh, what if…it explodes on the way there? You can’t possibly think that’s a good idea…”
“I’m doing better than I was the other day and when they put me under, I guess.” He sneered.
…Steve thought to himself as he looked around the area.
“I know, Tony. I don’t trust him either. But I don’t think that’s a possibility.” She looked down at her hands, which were clenched together, before looking back up at Tony.
Steve jumped in after Tony and strapped in. He could feel his heart pounding out of his chest, but it was a good feeling. He looked over at Tony who winked at him before putting his sunglasses on. His lab partner then ginned before pressing a few buttons on the console. The helicopter jerked a little as Tony easily maneuvered the controls, immediately impressing Steve.
Tony winced, waving Bruce off. “Steve isn’t going to want to deal with me blubbering over my lost childhood.”
Tony clenched his jaw as he leaned forward. “Oh wow…the year?”
The doctor looked at the pieces than back at Tony and Steve before looking back at the pieces again. She appeared extremely baffled. “How does this even work?”
Steve nodded slowly, watching Tony before reaching for the serving plate.
Steve groaned loudly, using the pillow that had been underneath his body to hide his face. Tony kept laughing as he laid down next to Steve to hug his body.
Tony waited for J.A.R.V.I.S. to save the sequence before exiting the lab, holding the door to the lab open for a moment, before leaving.
“Cap, just say that to him in person. I’m getting the feeling that’s all he wants…definitely sounds like he’s willing to listen now…”
Steve sulked some more. “…I can feel things getting more serious between us, so I thought reading the diary would help me better understand where Tony was coming from…I had no idea he would react the way he did…”

“It’s now a quarter after six, Sir.” Tony nearly jumped as J.A.R.V.I.S.’s impassive voice interrupted his mental gymnastics.
Tony watched them from above before patting Steve on the shoulder, turning to leave the balcony. Tony led them down a hallway before taking the back stairs to the first floor, walking down another hallway before reaching a restroom where they had stashed the Synergy device and a tablet in a waste bin before the event that evening.
Tony chuckled, but he didn’t sound as jovial as usual. “Uh, yes. Definitely. I’ll check with May if she can take Peter a few extra days before the wedding, but yeah, that should work out.”
“Uh…” Tony started, “I think I might just take a shower instead…” he quickly hopped off the bed before walking into the bathroom, “feel free to sleep here.” He added before disappearing.
“I like the beard, by the way.” Tony smiled widely at Steve as he pointed to his face, “well, I like the old look, too. But this really suits you.”
Riri held her hands up and smiled nervously. “Hey, Mr. Stark…”
Loki snorted as he placed the cap on Obadiah’s desk. He set the package next to it, shedding his coveralls before opening the package to find another disguise and his tool kit.
Tony wanted to be honest with Steve, but to what extent now, he wasn’t sure. He cared so much for him, but the thought of getting close again and then possibility losing everything scared him. Steve was so different than anyone he had ever been with, but Tony had been dragging his feet the most with him. When he was dating Pepper, Tony had told her on their third date that they were probably going to get married.
After rubbing Steve’s arm, Tony retrieved his phone from a console. “I just need to put you on the school’s list for pickups, because you know, stranger danger.” He shrugged with a grin before rapidly typing in Peter’s school’s number for maybe the hundredth time.
“Beautiful...” Steve murmured, backing away an inch or two to get a better look at the sight.
group of whiners in my entire life!”
Tony’s face twisted into a look of confusion. “What? There’s no way. You’re so handsome
Tony crouched down next to Steve, laughing as soon as he realized that Steve hadn’t seriously injured himself. He helped Steve to the bed who groused all the way up.
“No problem,” Strange crossed his arms, “I want to keep you in the hospital for a few more days just to watch that arm, but then after that, you’ll be free to go,” Strange smiled downward at Tony, “glad to see you're more or less your normal self, Tony.” He winked at Tony before saying goodbye and exiting the room.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., hold up for a second.” He called as the numbers before him stopped running up the projection.
Tony smirked as he turned to close the fridge. “You want Pamplemousse instead?” He walked back over to Peter to make sure he wasn’t splashing more food all over the place.
“Hey, Pep. May I speak with you for a quick second?” Tony motioned for Pepper to join him at the front of the room as everyone else made their way out. Obadiah glanced back at them, lingering a bit before engaging in a conversation with a reluctant-looking Fury.
“Jesus, Captain Rogers. Pretend this is a top-secret military combat mission or something. I can’t have you being all loosey goosey on me.” Tony smiled upward at Steve, now holding on to him with his hands on Steve’s hips.
Although a little late, Tony fulfilled his promise in picking up Peter who was more than excited to see him earlier than expected. As Tony drove, he kept playing over and over how he would bring up the subject of having Steve over for dinner, mindful of sounding as causal as possible.
Thor exited the vehicle and Steve followed him. A previous plan had included Tony, but he couldn’t find anyone to watch Peter at the last minute, so Steve and Thor planned to nab Loki before bringing him back to Stark Tower to be interrogated by the team afterword.
Tony laughed as he let go of Steve. “Well, I guess I was right…it’s difficult to resist this face.” He reached up to caress Steve’s face.
Steve sighed as he crossed his arms. “I feel like this one is too tight.” He could feel himself becoming even more uncomfortable as the suit even more accentuated his build every time he moved.
“What couple suite fiasco?” Sam placed a hand on Bucky’s shoulder as the latter began laughing again.
“I didn’t think I would get a chance to work with you, Mr. Stark.” Steve hoped the statement didn’t sound offensive.
Bucky rolled his eyes as he settled, but as he took his time responding, Sam interjected.
Tony nodded as he thought back to his interaction with Tiberius. “…Pep, I’m afraid I’m going to lose Steve…” He sighed loudly once more, “…I ran into Ty at the fucking event…” He let out before placing his head into his hands again.
like him.”
Tony tried to move, but a wave of pain shot throughout his body as he realized that his right arm had been mangled from the blast.
Tony rubbed his forehead with a sigh. “Okay,
“…I guess I got caught up in the moment…just playing the part like we agreed, right?” Steve added, attempting a half shrug coupled with a weak smile.
Eventually, Tony nestled himself back onto Steve’s chest, wrapping a hand around his waist. Steve held Tony with one hand, kissing the top of his head. Tony smiled to himself, rubbing his body against Steve’s until he found himself succumbing from the exhaustion brought on from not only being with Steve for the first time in a long time but also from the back and forth over their relationship. He closed his eyes, feeling Steve, his body finally relaxing until he ultimately fell asleep.
Tony squeezed himself in between Steve and Sam before wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist, pulling him tight. He led them through the foyer, through a giant kitchen until they were outside on an equally large balcony where most of the party took place. Steve glanced around: he saw Clint and Natasha talking to Thor and Fury along with some other people; Bruce speaking to Pepper and another man he didn’t recognize; and Obadiah chatting with a group of people who looked to be members of the Stark Industries board. Tony waved toward Bruce as he let go of Steve.
“I discussed this with Bruce last night. He thinks it’s probably best to test the limits on how much vibranium the device can handle beyond the already established quantity.” Tony flipped through some numbers on the image before turning slightly toward Steve.
Pepper nodded, still horrified that she had admitted to peeping through company files. Tony sat back in his chair, arm on the rest, hand stroking his chin.
“Oh my god, Steve…I think I’m close…” Tony murmured, pulling the hand Steve hand on his body tight with each gasp.
Bucky nodded again as Sam motioned for them to reenter the room. Tony had stayed in his chair next to the bed, trying to do work, but mostly watching Steve.
Steve let out a satisfied sigh as he walked away from the stove. He had finally finished cleaning up the kitchen from making dinner for his family and Ned. Usually, Tony would help Steve out with the cleaning, but the former had been working later than typical. Steve didn’t mind; he had gotten used to Tony’s working schedule ever since he moved in before they were married.
Tony grinned at Steve mostly to disguise how hurt he felt inside. Steve smiled back, seemingly unaware of the number he was doing on Tony’s sanity.
Natasha nodded. “Someone posted his bail, but he’s been missing ever since…”
Steve sighed heavily before moving away from the balcony. “There was a reason why I said that to you, Tony…” he paused, “…you brought up the night we almost slept together for first time…”
It took some convincing, but Thor had persuaded Tony to let Loki meet with the team. Thor and Clint had blind folded Loki about an hour ago before escorting him to the premises so he was unaware of the location of the new lab.
“Could I be on the…” Steve winced because he knew he was going to sound awkward, “…the, uh,
“I’ll see you on Monday.” Tony said with a kind smile before sliding into the backseat.
Steve nodded to indicate that he was listening.
Tony shook his head as he motioned for Bruce to take a seat in front of his desk.
“Sam went out on a date—”
Obadiah thought to himself, managing to project ease while Gamora and Nebula grilled each other.
Steve grinned back before a reporter almost dodged past Happy, holding out a tape recorder over his shoulder.
Loki gulped before answering, looking back and forth between Tony and Natasha.
Tony tapped on his earpiece, as he backed away from the microphone. “Romanov, Barton, and Thor, please be on the lookout for a herd of panicked nerds coming your way.” He then motioned for Steve to follow him off the stage, jogging back toward the conference room.
“Okay. Well, when you want to talk about it, I’m here.” It was now obvious that Bruce was referring to Tony’s other issues beyond the botched simulation.
“Dr. Selvig?”
“…I really was a mess after she left…” Tony sighed again, “…which is why I’m trying my best to do things differently now…so I guess this is a long way of me saying that you don’t really have anything to worry about when it comes to past relationships, Steve. No one’s
“…I can’t, Tony…I’m sorry…” Steve ultimately admitted.
“Thanks, Tony. Your place is great by the way.” He offered, albeit timidly.
Tony sighed as he rubbed his forehead. “Why would you do this? Even if you don’t care about Synergy, you put people’s lives in danger, including your brother’s.”
A disgruntled sound caused both Steve and Bruce to turn around abruptly. They laid their eyes on a sullen-looking Tony making his way from the entrance of the lab to the other side.
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but he couldn’t. After a moment of trying to prevent himself from unleashing on Bruce everything that had happened between him and Tony since they started speaking again, Steve only nodded.
Shuri watched Steve leave before turning toward Tony. “I’m sure everyone’s been giving you their own opinion about this, Tony, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m pulling for you and Steve. I really hope everything works out.”
Steve smiled as he walked around the car to get into the driver’s seat. “Okay, then. Tell me what we should make, and we’ll get what we need for him.” He asked as soon as he closed the door and started the engine.
P.S. I feel like I have two types of friends: the one who is overly supportive (Sam) and the one who is just a little suspicious because they don't want you to get hurt (Bucky).
Bruce sighed as he rolled his eyes. “Yeah it doesn’t look good.”
Steve ended up having a better night out than he had expected, although he finally felt exhaustion hit him a couple hours later.
“You caught me.” Tony grinned, “I started a new job just this past week.”
Steve laughed back, but it was subdued. He looked downward and away from Tony. “Thank you…”
Steve nodded without a word as he followed Tony to the basement, using building plans that had been uploaded to his tablet. Tony tapped a few times on his earpiece before decreasing his pacing.
Steve accepted it. He turned the mug around in his hand until he met the handle, shyly smiling back at Tony.
As his conversation with the board member continued on, Steve felt a hand squeeze his shoulder. He turned to see that Bucky was now standing next to him.
“Maybe you’re right.” Steve sighed.
Tony trained his eyes on Bruce who also looked shocked.
Tony sat at the island in the middle of his kitchen, sulking as he tried to get some work done, but was still too hung up on the fight he was having with Steve. He was also trying to eat a dinner he had made for himself, but for some reason he couldn’t quite balance the flavors like Steve usually did whenever he cooked which made him feel even more depressed.
Thor walked over to Tony and clapped his shoulder with such a force it nearly toppled him over. Tony flinched as he rubbed the area after pulling away, but the move proved futile as Thor clapped him on the shoulder again, pulling him in close toward his body for a weird half hug.
Steve sighed. “I’m trying to do that more, and I want you to be able to talk to me. I…can tell it’s difficult…and believe me, it took me a while to open up…especially after I left the military…”
