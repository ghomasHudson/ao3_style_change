They continued down the staircase. Steve went slowly, his attention on the sleeping boy in his arms. Stark matched his pace, saying nothing, his eyes distant and far away. The flight suit was finally still. Content, perhaps; for now.
Maybe Tony felt it too. Maybe he was here to ask for his number. Steve’s heart started to hammer again.
‘So,’ Lily guy said, inspecting his name tag. ‘Steve. I’m Tony. And now we know each other, do you have any flowers that say
, it was his mouth, and Stark was saying 'Sheriff!' in alarm, but he was slipping away, washed away in the flood of all the thoughts and memories that were both him and not him, and as he fell, he heard the words whispered.
Jarvis began to search without another word. He had not approved of Tony's choices in the last few years, and so Tony had turned off most of the Artificial Intelligence aspects of the system, effectively stripping it of any personality or opinions. Tony didn't know what he had been thinking in the first place, letting a computer program run so much of his household. He didn't miss it. He didn't need it.
and Steve still didn't really know what it meant), that Iron Man must be a Good Guy. Even if all the Bad Guys in question had done as shoplift $20 worth of cigarettes from a convenience store and happened to catch Iron Man's eye.
'Will you come back?' Something in his expression made her ask. He hesitated, but nodded, so she let go and watched him walk out of the house.
'It's Rhodes,' Steve said, looking at the caller ID and holding it out to him with apologetic eyes. 'You told them only to call if it was an end-of-the-world scenario.'
There, hidden in the vents, was a mass of wires and motherboards, covered in pulsing fibre optic cables.
They made their way out. If they were supposed to pay, no-one asked them too. Nobody said anything to them at all as Steve was ushered back to the car. Stark drove him back to his building in silence, blinking very rapidly the whole time. He was a bomb, Steve thought, about to go off. The second Stark pulled up, before he had even stopped the engine, Steve was trying the door.
A little way away, Stark lay on the floor, wearing nothing but a plain cotton t-shirt and some boxers, looking somehow younger, or smaller, or in some way diminished. His skin was chalk-white, his hair mussed, his eyes closed.
his blood was different now, Mr Stark had probably put a load of different drugs in it. Besides, his blood would have more oxygen in it now than it ever had before, that would make it look different from before, too. He couldn't blame his dad for not getting it – Steve was good at playing, hugging and sports, but not science – but the doctor should have understood.
The duties were easy enough, too, comprising everything from mopping floors and wiping down tables to setting up chairs and tables for meetings and putting them away again. Nothing too difficult, but enough to keep him busy, keep him out of his room and, more importantly out of his head for a few hours a day. That was all Steve wanted for now.
'Well, I'd call that a good morning's work, Thor,' Tony said. 'Stopped a bad guy, saved the child, back in time for lunch. Congrats.'
And that was a bridge too far. Steve punched him, hard as he could, right in the nose. The surprise made Ty let go of him, but as usual Steve's punch had done more damage to his hand than to Ty's face, and Ty shoved him away with both hands. Steve's knees gave way as he fell and he twisted awkwardly, winding himself on landing, just in time for Ty's foot to stamp down on his face. There went his nose. Steve held up his hands, trying to shield himself from a second blow; but of course Bucky had appeared by then and was hauling Ty away, quickly followed by two of the bouncers and The Diva herself. Steve sat up.
. I'm happy Dale's doing so well for himself, but if this keeps up he's going to need to move to bigger premises.'
'We aren't letting you and Venom within two hundred feet of each other,' He said. 'And we're not asking for weapons. My psychologists were annoyingly insistent on that; they think you're 'unstable' and could 'kill us all' if I leave you in a room full of sabotage-able weapons. Open your file.'
But Tony had called him – him! – beautiful. It was just a turn of phrase, Steve knew, a flippant moment, but still. Still.
'Why? Because it's not true?!' Tony took a deep breath, working his eyelids with his fingertips. 'I can't imagine being with anyone else ever again. You can. That's the bottom line here.'
in it. In some countries on the other side of the world, it still was. 'We're not breaking any laws, Sheriff,' Tony would say, every time Steve reluctantly shifted away from his too-far-out-of-the-ordinary caresses.
'And Tony, let me tell you an even less known fact about Steve Rogers, he is also clearly a bisexual! Evidence for this includes his
. So they'd come here, to Italy, and Tony had found them this place, right on the shores of Lake Garda. It wasn't tourist season yet, so it was relatively secluded. At night, nestled in the mountains, looking at the moonlight and the lights from the lodge reflected in the water, it was easy to believe it was just them. Steve was sitting on the wooden bench out on the decking, looking out at the lake and the mountain and stars. He was sketching, charcoal all over his fingers and the knees of his trousers, hands moving quickly, his eyes so intense but his mouth curved up in a smile. The only word for it was rapture. Tony loved to see it, loved how Steve could find such beauty in the world. The only thing he looked at that way was Steve.
Steve was looking at her with so much emotion it was hard to think, to work out what she was feeling herself. She hooked her arms around his back, standing up to hug him.
‘The recipient and the self,’ Tony nodded his understanding. ‘And it’s pink roses for beauty, right?’
It wasn't exactly hard to track them. Peter walked down the street, following the trail of people crying or screaming, smashed-up stuff and overturned cars. Before long he caught up with the handful of Shield agents that had made it from the house and was worried they would catch him, but they didn't even notice, too busy trying to stop everyone from panicking and running into each other. Everyone was talking about 'the monster', the sighting of someone in a Captain America outfit, but no-one seemed to know what to do.
A few minutes later Katherine's hair was as neat as it was ever going to be (not very), and Steve had chased Enoch and Edward back out, and they'd found Jane in the bedroom and persuaded her to put down her book and put on her shoes, and eventually had waved the whole gaggle of them off, ignoring the tuts and huffs of the other parents on the street. So the Barnes kids weren't the best turned out, and yes, maybe brushing Katherine's hair in the front garden had been a little odd even for them, but they were loved, and they were good and kind, and Bucky wouldn't have changed a thing about any of them.
Peter's voice was getting quieter and quieter, and Tony didn't like the sound of it. He turned away from Steve slightly, putting his back between Cap and the kid.
Steve looked at him. Pepper must have seen something in his expression that Tony didn't because she sighed deeply, rubbing her temples.
'I'm calling 911,' Steve said, hauling himself up on the wall, because that was definitely enough to cause alcohol poisoning; but he was stopped by Barnaby grabbing his trousers.
'What have you done now, Stone?' Steve asked, drawing his attention away from Tony as Thor shoved him in. 'Been going where you're not supposed to be again?'
Stark didn't answer him. Steve noticed the flight suit was spreading at his wrists as well, the strange tentacles tumbling down over one another, covering his watch, his wrists, his hands, spreading over his fingers. He laid his hand, now as black and slick as if it had been coated with tar, over Peter's chest. A second later, Peter bucked and jerked as if he had been shocked. Stark did it again. Peter twitched violently. Coming back to himself, Steve shoved Stark away.
Fury nodded. 'Well then, Widow, get me some evidence. Find out what Stark has to do with this. And someone get me a status update on Peter Parker!'
Steve almost felt like sighing. He started to walk forward. 'You know,' he said, conversationally, 'I feel like I'm always coming across monsters who claim to be the evil-inside-man. But I fought the Nazis. I've seen the evil in mankind, and it isn't you.'
full of concern, because how could Tony be mad at him if he seemed to care so much, how could he have done it if he cared -
Silence fell. He was waiting for Tony to react, to say something. Tony was waiting too. For the words to sink in, to be replaced with disbelief or anger, conviction that his dad was lying,
'I just wanted to check you're okay. I mean, I don't know how long... uh, how long these things take, but it's been a while and I heard crying-'
Except for once a month, when Mother Nature came calling and here she was, sobbing in the bathroom, desperately throwing things out of the cupboard in the hope that a solitary tampon could be found. She couldn't go to the store bleeding everywhere, everyone would know. Even Jarvis' best orders wouldn't come through until at least tomorrow- no, it was already night, they wouldn't get the order until the morning and it wouldn't arrive until the following day. She was going to be trapped here in the bathroom, bleeding, constantly showering to try and avoid any of the grossness getting onto her skin-
As far as Steve was concerned, though, he still had two arms, one good and one serviceable, and that was one more than the surgeon would have left him with. It was all thanks to Tony, and Steve loved him all the more for it, even if, on occasion, he'd catch Tony eyeing it with heavy guilt. The man was a perfectionist. He couldn't see that it was only thanks to him that Steve had an arm at all. He only saw it's shortcomings. Tony wore that expression now.
In his high chair Peter squawked indignantly and Tony remembered they hadn't finished breakfast. He went back to feeding Peter, carefully filling each spoonful and holding it up to his son's mouth. Behind him, Clint took the phone off speaker and left the room. When he came back, his eyes were glassy.
Pepper smiles fondly at him as she passes him a cup of hot chocolate. She notices Steve's jacket immediately and the fondness transforms into a knowing smirk, her sharp eyes roving over the looping script that spells Rogers atop his breast. She and Natasha exchange secretive looks.
The kiss starts slow and soft before Tony groans as Steve slides his hand into his curls, pulling him closer and they deepen the kiss. Steve’s tongue traces along the seam of Tony’s lips and he opens obediently, gasping softly as their tongues slide together wet and messy. His hand clenches in the fabric at Steve’s chest, and his other raises to trace along Steve’s jaw, the rough hairs of his beard just barely registering with the sensors in his prosthetic. The air between them grows heated and charged, and Tony can feel the warmth pool low in his belly as he presses up against Steve, leaning in until they’re aligned from chest to feet.
Tony takes another deep breath, grateful for his best friend’s steadying hand on his shoulder. He doesn’t know why he’s so nervous. This is something he’s wanted for a long, long time. “I’ve been ready.”
“Anyways,” Jarvis continues, “I don't think I shall ever be able to capture exactly those things, but I'll be happy to spend the rest of my life trying. I do look forward to drawing and painting again.”
“That's me,” Rhodey says wetly, pulling Tony and Pepper into a tight group hug. “I'll see you both soon. You be good,” he directs this at Tony.
The drive to Thor’s passes in a blur, admittedly because Tony is far too busy trying to climb inside of Steve via his mouth to notice anything else. Sometime during the drive, Happy puts up the privacy screen. In one moment of clarity, Tony thinks they should probably talk about this and what it means for the contract, but then Steve hooks his fingers through his belt loops to pull him in for another kiss and Tony forgets everything that's not Steve.
It’s minutes to midnight on New Year’s Eve and Tony is still working, eyeballs deep in fine tuning the lines of his latest code while Queen blares from his speakers. He’s deep in concentration staring at his screen, arranging and rearranging what he already has, but the damn thing still won’t work properly. He’s nodding along to the music, staring critically at a line that simply will not cooperate when he feels the hairs on the back of his neck prickle up, and before he can turn, huge arms wind around his waist and pull him snug against a broad chest behind him.
His fingers are singed from soldering, his nail beds blackened with grease. Everytime he reaches up to run frustrated hands over his hair and face, more grime gets smeared onto his skin. He's sure he looks a frightful mess, probably enough to summon a Sullen Steve Stare followed by a lot of fussing.
Tony shrugs. “Sure,” he says, polishing off the last of his sandwich. He sticks his thumb in his mouth to get the last of the sauce. “Gotta keep up the charade, right? Just in case the vultures start catching on. There’ve barely been any tweets about us in the past couple of days.”
Pepper rubs a soothing hand across his shoulder, pulling him close for a loose hug. “I know, Tony,” she sighs. “But you still have to sleep. Steve says you've been down here all week. I'm surprised the school hasn't kicked you out yet.”
Steve tries to slow Tony down with a tighter grip on his thigh but that only encourages him to play dirty. When Steve is momentarily distracted by Tony sucking on his tongue, Tony reaches a hand down to take them both in his grip.
Steve takes Tony's hand in his and raises it to his lips, pressing a kiss to the rings he put there. “That’s Steve Stark-Rogers to you,” he says and watches as a flash of heat lights in Tony's eyes.
Tony sighs, knowing the battle is lost, and goes for broke. He rises on his tiptoes as they stop at Steve's locker, and with everyone watching, he presses a kiss to Steve's cheek. He grins wide, paparazzi bright before walking away with a coy, “see ya later, big guy.”
Tony is gorgeously responsive. He gasps against Steve’s mouth, his little pants of breath warm against Steve’s lips as their hips meet, and Steve can feel Tony’s hardness against his own. His hand trails from Tony’s nipple where he had been rubbing and teasing until Tony is bucking up against him, down to the crest of his hip and lower still to grip the curve of his ass to bring them closer, their erections sliding together.
They spend the summer sneaking off into the woods together to swim in the forbidden sinkhole and lay spread out on the grass at night to map the stars. They swap stories of how much their parents suck, the new secretary Janet's dad is fucking that week and the new project at SI that Howard doesn't know how to finish. They make a promise with glass shard cut palms in front of the campfire that they will never become their parents.
From the corner of his eye, he can see Natasha frowning. “I’m not nice to you just because you’re sad.”
It clicks suddenly for Steve as he holds Tony in his arms. The quiet sadness when Tony looks at his own reflection and picks at his grey hairs and old scars. The uncertainty and melancholy in Tony’s eyes when he looks at himself. The silent frowns and quickening steps when he nears the glass. Tony doesn't hate the mirror. He hates the way he looks.
Sarah makes him feel right at home, gets him to help with slicing the bread for the beef stew and shredding lettuce for the salad, simple little things just to make him feel included. She’s warm and bright and kind, genuine affection shining from her eyes whenever she looks at her son. That same affection curves the lines of her lips whenever she smiles at Tony and he is weak-kneed with gratitude, warm to the core with how easily Sarah Rogers accepts him.
There, Steve stands military straight dressed in white and silk, the colorful hints of his tattoos peeking from beneath the cuffs of his sleeves. Tony barely registers the cut of his suit and the intricate vest tucked underneath. He focuses only on the gleam of Steve’s wobbly smile before his own vision blurs and everything shifts out of focus.
The jukebox is still perched in the corner by the long sprawling counter, quietly humming away as a slow ballad plays from the tinny crackling speakers. He makes a quick stop to drop a quarter into the machine, flicking through the selection until he finds The Supremes.
They end up bribing the diner they love to deliver them pies and burgers, and they spread out the bounty on a free space they clear up on Tony's floor. Tony feels the knot in his chest loosen for the first time since Rhodey left as he eats soggy fries and greasy burgers with his friends amongst piles of dirty clothes and computer parts. Afterwards, he snuggles up against Natasha as she fingercombs his hair and puts his feet in Loki’s lap. He feeds Natasha fries and calls Loki every affectionate nickname he can can think of to make up for his earlier transgression.
“Wait,” Tony says, his mouth feeling numb. “You just stormed in here, did a whole villain monologue, slammed everything on the table and used the big L word, and now you're saying ‘like’ again. I'm getting some mixed signals here, Rogers—”
Rhodey is standing next to him, a soft smile on his face as he looks back at Tony. He’s dressed in his sharp Air Force blues, his many medals decorating his chest. He reaches out and smooths down the line of Tony’s jacket, and Tony nearly sobs at seeing Rhodey’s misty eyed expression mirroring his own.
Tony grins as he leans in to mouth along the length of Steve’s cock. He lightly nips at the skin as he strokes the head lightly with his hand, trailing a wet path down to the base. He licks back up to suck at the head, pressing his tongue against the underside as Steve moans and his hand in Tony's hair tightens slightly.
The brunet closed the next door behind him, locking it and covering the small window that allowed limited visual access into the room with a laminated poster of a pumpkin and a pitcher of lemonade held with a few strips of masking tape on the edges.
Steve had stared at him in confusion, then with mounting horror as he had realised what Tony was saying. He thought this was – he thought this was because Steve had
He realised then that Tony was speaking. Steve’s guilt spiral had momentarily drowned him out, and now he had no idea what Tony had lied about and no idea how to react.
Stark glanced at it, then snorted in amusement before going back to his phone. 'He doesn't have a future as an artist, does he?' He laughed.
Steve knew he ought to say no. Every ounce of pride and sense he had was telling him to say no. This was a bad idea. He needed to say no.
'Sure,' Tony said, glancing at the screen he had pulled up before flopping down on the couch to listen. Behind him, a small blinking dot flashed over the hospital on the on-screen map, telling Tony exactly where he could find Peter's new phone.
‘Okay, can I borrow this real quick? You can have it back after.’ Peter nodded. ‘Good boy. Finish your toast.’ Steve flipped the TV onto a random kids’ channel and made his way into the kitchen.
'No, I'm not that talented. The boss' PA picked out the sculptures, then they got a landscape artist to do the rest.'
'Of course,' Tony continued, 'You know what helps the brain work faster? Exercise. And you look like you could use a break. You know what's both physically exerting and mentally refreshing?'
'Or you could spend three days converting more of this place so that you don't have to room next to Thor.' Judging from experience, they weren't going to get back to sleep any time soon so Steve slid out of bed and starting searching for his shirt. Tony groaned but followed suit.
The piece of paper had been crumpled up into a tight ball, and he had unscrunched it to see if it was another work of art. When he saw instead it was a list, he would have thrown it away again except – except a word had accidentally caught his eye. Steve's handwriting. It said 'prettiest'. As in,
Steve,' he said, trying to keep the teasing delight out of his tone. 'Are you trying to tell me this list is about
The words were so high pitched and so fast that Peter had never been able to work them out, no matter how many times they had the playlist on. He always sung along to it with dees and das, and it always made Steve laugh.
Steve was unpacking the groceries on the kitchen counter, and put down a box of tampons in his 'bathroom' pile without giving them a second glance. Natasha couldn't help but smile at her husband when she saw them. A lot had changed since the first time she had sent him out to buy them. For one thing, he knew what brand to get her now. He always brought pads, too, for night time. These days she didn't even have to ask. A few months after her breakdown, and a few months after they had started dating, he had asked her if she'd thought about other forms of contraception, and it had turned out he'd been reading up about them. Without any embarrassment at all, they'd talked through the different options and the pros and cons, but she was still finding her period a bit difficult to handle at that point, and sticking with what she knew had seemed easiest; even if Steve was usually the one reminding her to take it. She'd come a long way since then, too. It was time for the next step.
Laughing weakly into her cushion, Natasha decided she had never been more humiliated in her life. Before Afghanistan, she would have said that men ought to educate themselves, that women had no reason to be embarrassed about a normal bodily function, but now,
'Yeah, it'll really make a difference when I'm trying to make small talk at the graduation ceremony for your seventh PhD,' Steve started to roll his eyes, but Tony kissed him feather-light between them, before planting one firmly on his mouth, pulling him close.
'No, no,' he said. 'We don't romanticise jealousy, Cap. That's a short cut to an unhealthy relationship.'
'The whole thing came down, Steve! Like it was never there! It was a downright miracle you survived, and I didn't know you had! Not for
'Yeah? Like what?' Steve demanded. 'Because I can't think of it, and I'm guessing you haven't been able to either. Come on, Buck, I thought when you helped with the profile you were on board with this.'
He was about ten or fifteen feet up when Jarvis spoke to him again. 'You are intruding. Please desist or action will be taken.'
The girls laughed like this was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Steve did not laugh. It was widely known that Stark
'Go see where he is,' Howard eventually snapped at Ms Potts, who had been waiting unobtrusively by the door. She nodded and went out into the hall, and Steve heard her climbing the stairs. If Steve was asked to guess, they had probably collected a hungover Barnaby earlier, and he had collapsed back into bed on reaching the mansion. Steve was trying to keep an open mind about that – everyone he knew got drunk sometimes – but something about Tony drinking alone in the dark of his apartment, about his dad saying there was a family history of alcoholism... Steve wasn't so blinded by love that he didn't see there might be a problem. It hurt him, to see Tony in so much pain. But they would work on it, they would handle it together. He was sure they could.
‘I’m so glad you’re open,’ he said, practically crashing into the counter. ‘This is an emergency. A floral emergency. What flowers express deep, deep sorrow?’
. It was very basic maths, but, in Steve's eyes at least, it showed the innate understanding of concept that Peter had been displaying since he was 18 months old, far before he'd had any formal teaching. Not that he'd had any now; nursery was not practically possible. But Peter had an inquisitive mind, begged to learn, and was well on his way to being able to read for himself. He could also count (Steve was not sure how high, he had once let Peter get all the way to 500 before he stopped him) and add and subtract numbers up to ten; basically anything he could use his fingers for. He definitely understood the idea of multiplication and division, too, but hadn't yet found a way to do this on his hands. Steve was almost relieved. Talent was one thing, something he could be proud of, but
But to Peter, Iron Man was a hero who saved the day, and Steve couldn't take that away from him. Not now. And while six months ago he would never have endorsed anything that perpetuated that image, if an Iron Man duvet cover from Redbubble meant Peter would sleep at night, Steve would buy him a damn Iron Man duvet cover. If a red-and-gold paint job meant Peter would let him connect the oxygen tank at night, Steve would paint it red-and-gold. Steve had been forced to learn the hard way over the last few years that principles were a luxury. He would never have considered coming to a place like this, otherwise.
Mr Osborn pushed Peter so hard that Peter fell to the floor, and Mr Osborn slammed the door shut behind them, locking it. Peter sat up, feeling a little dazed. He'd landed on his shoulder and now it hurt, and he didn't understand this room. It had one long bench running down the middle, and lots of science stuff around the walls, a computer in the corner. It was definitely a lab, but from what Peter had seen they were in a super fancy house or a hotel, and on an upper floor. Who put a lab at the top of their house?
He sat up so quickly he nearly knocked the water over, wondering how he had missed something so obvious. If he couldn't leave the bed, and there was nothing fun in the bed, he would just have to
Despite his chosen topic of torment, Osborn was neither much older nor much bigger than Tony, barely more than 6 inches and 18 months between them. Before Tony came, Osborn had been the smartest in the school, and hadn't taken kindly to being knocked off his pedestal. Admittedly Tony had not exactly helped the situation by rubbing Osborn's face in it at every opportunity, but still. He wasn't worried about Osborn, he could take Osborn. The goons, however, were a different story. They were all close to graduating, 17 or 18 years old, and twice his size. Tony didn't think they would
'Cap, people have been saying that since I was two years old.' Tony put his foot down on the accelerator. He might as well embrace the image.
Oh, hell, was the Captain going to start crying in his car? Tony had a strict no-tears policy within a radius of several feet around him. He had no interest whatsoever in dealing with anyone else's drama. Anyone who cried was immediately put out on the kerb. Thankfully, Steve's eyes remained dry.
He ruffled Peter's hair, wanting to say more, but knowing there wasn't time. He would just have to make sure he came back. From somewhere down the hill, car alarms started to sound. Steve ran towards them, not looking back, because if he did, he might stop.
Sometimes, the natives of the planet – humans – came to the cave and tried to kill it, to hurt it, to cast it out with fire and knives and shouts. The creature did not like that. The creature defended itself. The creature killed them. And because of the way it killed them, with a short, sharp shock like a poisonous sting that didn't leave a single mark, the locals had started calling it
'I'm fine, thanks,' Steve said, because that was the answer that would get people to leave him alone and let him get on with his life. The last of the fever had broken over a week ago, but it had left him feeling listless and empty, removed from everything. It was as if during the months he had lain unconscious, his life had been dipped in oil, and now everything just rolled off him without leaving a mark. He felt bereft, disconnected, and odd; but sitting around at home or in the hospital wasn't going to fix that. He had been sick, alternately delirious or unconscious, for the best part of three months; and the three or four months before that were a hazy blur in his memory, not quite clear. The loss of half a year was enough to screw anyone up, he figured. Either the feeling would pass with time or it wouldn't, but either way he had made up his mind to get on with it.
that he couldn't help laughing; and once he had started he couldn't stop, and then Tony was laughing too, and they were kissing and kissing and kissing, and Steve didn't give a damn if it was cheesy, he didn't want this ever to end. Not for the rest of their lives.
'No,' Tony protested again, but Steve had taken him by the shoulders and was gently-but-firmly pushing him into one of the seats around the table. He was only using one hand, splayed so wide that it spilt across Tony's shoulder and collarbone, palm on Tony's chest, where Tony was sure he would be able to feel his heart starting to pound; but if Steve noticed he said nothing, instead using his free hand to deftly scoop up another orange and place it resolutely down on the chopping board, squarely in front of Tony.
. Finding a pay phone in New York these days was nearly impossible, and he was pretty sure the Skrulls had taken his cash along with his cell. But he had to call the Avengers, get them out here to deal with the ship, to take him home. To let him see Tony.
'Yeah, and the carpet was all sticky and stank when it was dry, so we had to get a new one,' he finished. 'It wasn't my best idea.'
Because he didn't want to be this Steve. He didn't want to be the version of him where things had gone so wrong. He didn't want a dead Tony. He didn't want any of the other worlds he'd glimpsed either. He wanted his. And that meant he couldn't let himself be diluted down, driven mad. It meant he needed to get himself off the table.
Steve coloured and tipped his hat to her, moving quickly on. There was no way she could have mistaken him for Tony, not with a foot of height between them. She was just making a point about him being there so early in the morning, staying there.
He was in their lounge, standing by the crowded mantlepiece, looking at the photographs displayed there. There was their wedding photo and Bucky's, a picture of Steve's Commandos team, an old portrait of Steve's father in his uniform in a shared frame with a very similar one of Peggy's brother, photographs of their families, of memories, of special days and events, of VE day, VJ day, and all the rest. Steve always looked at them when he needed to be cheered up, but it obviously hasn't worked this time. He glanced at her with eyes that were blood red and sore, puffed up with crying, then looked down at the floor, saying nothing.
'I've told you before,' Ty took one hand off Steve's collar to shove Barnaby away. 'I don't care what you say, you're mine.'
later, Tony was at the front and the barista (?) was eyeing him slightly suspiciously. Tony tried to smile reassuringly. The barista (?) did not seem reassured.
Shield scientists and researchers came and explained the Venom symbiote and the effect they believed it would have on someone. Tony wondered why they were being so unusually forthcoming, but the only person he could ask was Steve, who didn't understand the question, quite happy to believe that Shield had no ulterior motive other than helping. Tony, however, knew this was valuable intel, and that normally they would have been quite happy to leave him in a deep dark pit in order to keep their secrets. Unfortunately, there was no way to know what they were up to, so he filed the question in the back of his mind and tried to just focus on what was going on in the trial.
But Tony did not want to just throw himself on the mercy of Captain America like some lost little kid. This would take some finesse and cunning.
‘Riiiight,’ Tony drawled, raising his eyebrows. ‘Well, excuse me for interrupting your “alone time” but-’
He set Peter down on his feet, near the few remaining Shield Agents that had either recovered from the blow or had avoided it to begin with. 'Stay here,' he said.
'No,' Steve said, matter-of-factly. 'You won't do it again. I'll persuade you not to.' And he actually, seriously, honestly,
'Oh no,' Steve said, kissing Peter's hair. 'Look, you woke up Daddy. That's why you need to tell me quieter, bud.'
'It's...' Peter trailed off, worried, and Tony's brain began to throw out various panicky explanations.
Ignoring Thor's baffled look, Steve turned around and marched back the way he had come. There was no need to go and see Carol. He knew exactly who was behind this.
'I'm sorry,' he said, suddenly, and Natasha blinked at him because Steve had been great and she didn't have the least idea what he was talking about. But he carried on. 'I had no idea what it was like. I didn't want to know, I never even thought about it. But you're a member of my team, and if you have to go through this
It would have been a different story if he had been there alone, Tony knew. With Steve and Peter there, there was no chance to feel the solitude. It was almost like his fantasy, waking up with a family there every day, except that Steve was in the spare room, in a separate bed, and motivated by orders rather than any feelings.
'I'm fine.' Tony said. 'Last one there's a rotten Skrull.' With no further ado, he fired up the repulsors and flew away.
'Superstitious nonsense,' Tony said, without thinking, because if Steve listened to him, it was going to have the exact opposite effect to the one he wanted. He stepped forward slightly, gripping Steve's hand tighter, and hastily added, 'But I'd hate to break a tradition. Uh, assuming you don't want to.'
The principle had not believed him. Nobody believed him, even when he tried to argue that he knew what he was doing in the lab and wouldn't have caused a fire. His parents didn't believe him. Jarvis didn't believe him, and was on his way to pick him up right then. Tony was permanently and immediately excluded, and there might be a criminal investigation. Two newspapers had already phoned.
. He imagined his brain was like an old record player, jumping and skipping over the same spot again and again.
He couldn't help wondering, in the back of his mind, exactly what the recording contained. He knew about Steve and Peggy, of course. The one kiss. The date that never was. Back when he had first met Steve, Steve had still been getting over it; the relationship that had never had the chance to get started. Peggy was Steve's road not taken, and Tony had learnt to be okay with that, but still. Still. It was horrible of him, but he desperately wanted to know what the recording contained, what Steve had said. Had he told Peggy he loved her? At the same time, no, he definitely didn't want to hear it. He wavered in indecision.
They were woken by the sounds of banging from next door, Thor moaning with pleasure. Tony stirred reluctantly, groaned, and threw his pillow at the wall.
He was too distressed to speak, unable to tell her what was wrong, though between his gasping sobs she gathered it concerned someone called
'Please,' Peter said desperately, because he knew he couldn't get down in time and he was going to get shocked. 'This monster came out of his flight suit and swallowed him up, and it wants to kill my dad. Mr Stark likes my dad. It's not him. We have to
Steve was just about to reply when he heard more slithering next to him. He turned and saw Stark's flight suit was now in full flow, moving around and over him, like a snake coiling around prey. Stark made a little 'Oh' sound, and for a moment, Steve could see his eyes, full of fear and very, very human. Then his eyes were gone, swallowed up by the black tar that had climbed his neck, over the back of his head, up his chin, and was now oozing over his face, into his eyes and nose and mouth, until it consumed him completely.
He had just finished when Steve returned, his old-man bag full of groceries and what looked to be about 4 half-litre bottles of water. Tony was surprised to see them. Steve seemed very much like the
Not long after that came the whole mess with Fisk. Steve had saved Tony's life – part of the job, yes, but he would have done it anyway, he wasn't thinking about the badge when he'd waded in, he was thinking about Tony, and how he would fall apart if he lost him – and together, with assistance from Red Wolf, and Widow Barnes, and Dr Banner, they'd put a stop to Fisk's trouble making ways. But not, unfortunately, before Steve had taken a bad hit.
‘Ah, see, no can do,’ Stark said. ‘You see, Captain, I’ve decided I want you. I’m going to have you, and what’s more, you’re going to enjoy it. You’re going to beg for it.
Later, he would blame his preoccupation with the fight for what happened next. There were only ten Skrulls, a single rebellious landing party that wanted revenge on the Avengers for something or other (Steve wasn't the leader any more, he didn't have to listen), and usually it would have been a relatively simple matter to mop them up. Problem was, that meant Steve had time to think, and the more time he had to think, the more irritated he became.
Natasha tried to keep her focus on that, on what that might mean, all through the difficult appointment, to still her drumming fingers and tapping feet. Steve was happy they weren't dating. Very happy.
'Where are you going?' Steve had asked. He'd meant it to sound plaintive, but the whine had come out more like a growl. Stark had stared at him, frozen.
Over time, Thor had come to appreciate the usefulness of comm units during a battle. It was certainly easier then bellowing to your allies over the sounds of sword-crash and thunder-clap, and after some uneasy consideration Thor had concluded it probably didn't count as cowardice to
Beneath the table, Steve's leg was bouncing up and down anxiously, but it made his knee and ankle protest so he forced it to be still. He fished a pencil out of his pocket instead and began doodling on a napkin. He was barely thinking about what he was doing, but of course a sketch of Barnaby began to take shape.
There was one simple reason why, and the reason was Steve. Steve had thought he'd lost everyone when he woke up in the future, it was no wonder that he clung so tightly to his best friend after this miraculous reappearance. Bucky recovering would make Steve happy, and Tony wanted Steve to be happy; even if it stung a bit to know he would never be the friend to him that Bucky was. Even if the fact that they would never be more than friends stung even more. Still, if Steve was happy, Tony could deal with that too. He could deal with anything as long as Steve was happy.
We're nearly at the end! Thank you to everyone who has supported me and commented so far, it means the world. I'm determined to push through to the end; one more chapter after this and a decent-sized epilogue and we're there.
They were less than a block away, passing a coffee shop, when Venom suddenly veered off, a tentacle whipping out, smashing the glass, knocking aside tables and patrons, and sending what looked to be a supporting column crumbling before racing off much faster than before. It was to slow him down, Steve knew, but once again there was nothing he could do but play right into it. He ran inside, shouting at those customers not already moving to get out, racing to the column and doing his best to keep it upright. As soon as everyone was out, he dived out of the door, escaping just before the whole thing came crashing down.
'I know,' the Skrull said. 'It's flawed. That's why we need the Avengers. With Richards dead, the next best authority on the multiverse is your Tony Stark. We need the machine fixed. Then, once we can freely travel the multiverse, our empire will truly know no bounds.'
Tony laughed. Meredith was the best. He turned to go back to his experiment, but she waved a hand for his attention.
Eventually, he started to get control of himself, whispering apologies between shaking breaths. Peggy's already broken heart shattered again.
Tony buried himself in Steve's arms, and his world straightened out. Everything was right again. Of course, Steve was never leaving his sight ever again, but that was an argument for another day. For now he was content to ignore Steve's questions and apologies, and simply stay there, cuddled together with his son and his husband, enclosed in their own little perfect world.
Their eyes met. The plants rustled in the breeze, surrounding them with their sweet scent. It was enough to knock loose one of the sweetpea blossoms on the trellis above their bench, and the flower fell with enough force to make them jump. They both laughed, but the moment was gone, and it didn't matter because – because. Steve pulled his own thoughts up short. He wasn't going to spend the rest of his life with this man, kissing him, loving him. He was going to spend the rest of his life chained to Tony Stark.
Of course Tony had been upset, to put it mildly. Nor had he been particularly thrilled by Steve begging him to
going to sleep with you. That was, and is, just never going to happen. It's never been on the cards.'
'Shield assignment,' Steve said. 'They needed someone to keep an eye on you. Make sure you're alright. And... Captain America was seen on the streets of New York. I wanted to lie low a little.'
'That's not what I meant!' Steve huffed in frustration. 'Why do you always do this? You have to twist everything and make it all about you - '
'If you want to use the lab, Osborn, I'm happy to supervise you. Just don't touch anything without asking.' Tony knew from Osborn's face that he'd touched a nerve, and slid off his stool to his feet, just in case.
'What the hell is that?' he demanded. This year's theme was a kind of Scandinavian-esque winter wonderland, with pine everywhere and intricately knitted blankets, rugs and throws. Every door frame, alcove and banister in the place was festooned with garlands of evergreen leaves, glittering slightly or with LEDs tucked discreetly into them here and there to twinkle. Some had golden berries, some had a sprinkling of fake snow, some even had pine cones. What none of them had, what none of them would ever have, was
Tony wasn't sure what else he could say. It wasn't that he wanted to go to jail. Actually, he felt quite sick at the prospect. What was he going to do with himself? He couldn't fight, defend himself, without Venom or the armour. He was pretty sure there were no labs in jail. And how long would he be there? Ten, twenty years? Peter would be an adult when he got out. If he got out. They could give him life. It would only be fair, the amount of lives he had taken.
'You don't need to rush off, do you?' Stark asked, leaning over to prop his elbow against Steve's seat. 'And after we were having such a good time.' He reached out with his other hand and squeezed Steve's thigh. 'I wouldn't want to leave the evening unfinished.'
Ben apparently makes the best sandwiches north of East Eighty, and Steve hasn't been exaggerating one bit Tony realizes as soon as he bites into his chicken parm. They're sitting on the steps at the Met with the local lunch crowd and tourists alike, watching pigeons fight over crumbs as they tuck into their sandwiches, sharing the warm fries Ben gave them on the house.
“We have ‘date nights,’” Steve continues, actually makes air quotations by crooking his fingers. Tony doesn’t find that endearing. It’s downright dorky. “We use that time to learn about each other, so no one can tell we’re not actually dating.” Tony grimaces at the thought of having to spend time with Steve alone.
That creates a swell of anger in Tony. Sure, they haven’t spoken in the years before—before Everything, but Steve doesn’t get to look at him with that much sorrow. As though he wasn’t one half of the original divide. As though he didn’t drive his shield through Tony’s chest and left him in Siberia. He doesn’t get to look at Tony now like this, as though—as though he thought he would never see Tony again.
Afterwards when they’re laying in bed after Steve licks the come out of Tony before filling him again, Tony rolls over to lay on Steve’s chest. He smiles warmly at his husband, but completely ruins the soft moment when he says, “you liked the panties.”
Steve is a beast on the field, all controlled power and whipquick agility. His reflexes are lightning sharp, every move conservative and carefully calculated. Tony's eyes are trained on him every time he pulls back his arm with coiled strength in his shoulders, snapping the ball forward in a precise parabola. It's a thing of beauty.
For all of his grace on the field, Steve has two left feet when he dances. He steps on Tony's toes every couple of steps and Tony finds that he doesn't mind so much when Steve kisses him in apology each time.
“So, that was nice,” Tony says flippantly. “Thanks for that. But I uh, really gotta go. Dear old dad has something for me. Emergency Stark business. Important Stark Industries stuff. Yep. Super urgent SI thingamabob,” he adds before clamping his mouth shut against the rising urge to ramble. “I'll see you later, Rogers.”
“She’s beautiful,” Steve says when he’s done. Tony startles. It’s the first time Steve has spoken to him since his return.
He gets lost in the feeling of Steve surrounding him until he hears the soft inhalation of shock from Pepper when she finally sees them. There’s a slight pause and Tony refuses to lift his head, screwing his eyes shut and leans further into Steve until he hears the click of Pepper’s shoes as she quickly walks away.
He only stops when Tony is gasping for breath, wheezing laughter between pants for air. Steve holds him down with one large hand gripping both of Tony’s wrists pinned above his head and asks again, “Do you surrender? Last chance.”
The stadium where the championship game is held is huge and packed to the brim by the time Tony arrives. The fluorescent lights are blindingly bright overhead, washing everything cold and white. The seats are sectioned in a clear division of team loyalty, a sea of green and grey to the right clashing with an ocean of red and blue.
“I'm sure your driver will appreciate the day off,” Steve says as he pulls Tony further and further away from the correct direction. “I'm going to show you something I'm seventy-eight percent sure you've never seen before.”
thing,” Steve says. “You can't keep calling me by my last name. That's really weird for people who are dating. You need to start calling me by my actual name.”
Clint and Bucky sign back and forth with quick fluttering hands, arguing over the proper way to string popcorn together and Sam looks like he's a minute away from knocking their heads together. Natasha watches them with no small amount of amusement curling the edges of her lips as she sneaks handfuls of popcorn, and Bucky still hasn't realized why the bowl is emptying at such a rapid rate while Loki is arranging the other ornaments by color and bickering with Thor. Tony feels warm and comfortable and filled to the brim with contentment.
“It's okay, J,” Tony says. “It's nothing I shouldn't have seen coming. I knew all along that this would happen, and yet I was still stupid enough to let it go so far. Especially when I
Tony cannot believe that Rhodey hasn't even been enlisted yet and he's already cracking bad Air Force jokes. He takes a deep breath and bites back his pleas again. He doesn't guilt trip him by wailing that he will never survive senior year without him. He doesn't drop to his knees to cling to his leg. He was told, under no circumstances, are any of these things okay to do, especially not to Rhodey. Damnit, Pepper.
With a swell of pride expanding in his chest, Tony excitedly pushes open the door without remembering to knock and jogs giddily into the study. His father and uncle Obie are sitting at the enormous mahogany desk that fills nearly half the room, conversation interrupted by Tony's appearance.
Bruce sucks in a sharp inhale. His eyes become wild and panicked, darting from one corner of the room to the next. He doesn’t say anything for a long time, his eyes not quite meeting Tony’s as he chews on his bottom lip.
They start finding each other in the early hours of the morning. The first time it happens, Tony had just stumbled from his lab into the kitchen after tinkering with Mark LXXXV to make her better, perfecting her code. Steve is sitting at the counter with a plate of peanut butter sandwiches at his elbow as he scrolls through his tablet.
It lurches something in Tony’s stomach, wrenching and aching, and he can’t watch for any longer. Before he knows it, he’s walking again, heading down to the labs to find Bruce.
Why the fuck are they doing this when Happy is above ground probably still waiting for them? It makes no fucking sense. He plants his feet by the card machines and steadfastly refuses to move as travelers part around them, glaring in annoyance.
“Fine,” Steve finally mutters, his clenched jaw a strained line of tension. “We'll try this.” He drops a crumpled twenty on the table and leaves before Tony can say anything else.
“You know you’re both always welcome over with or without Rhodey home,” she says warmly. “Don’t be strangers now.”
It is honestly, a pretty good time. Eventually, they get some cleaning done, enough to make a sizeable dent in the amount of junk Tony hoards.
He's too scared to do anything like try to kiss her or hold her hand at camp, but he thinks of asking her on a date after they go home for the summer. He thinks they can work despite being on opposite sides of the country. He's in New York and she's in Malibu, but it's surely worth a try, because who else can understand him like Janet can? Maybe she loves him too. Probably.
Tony immediately pulls away from Steve, cold settling at the base of his spine when the gravity of what he's done sets in. “
Tony is gasping and desperate by the time Steve gently slides his fingers free and before Tony can feel empty for too long, he's guiding his slicked cock in, hard and thick, the girth of him stretching Tony much wider than the two fingers. There's still the remnants of lube and come in him from earlier, and even with the new slick, there's just the barest hint of burn on the first slide beneath the wide swath of pleasure. Tony relishes every dragging inch as Steve pushes in, his nerves singing like livewires dancing across his skin. They're both panting by the time Steve is rooted deep inside of him, and Tony trembles, overloaded on sensation.
The simultaneous feelings of jarring shock and gut wrenching panic leave him lightheaded. That letter should never have seen the light of day, it should be rotting at the back of his closet. It definitely should
“Nope,” Steve confirms. “She's probably going to be repeating this story even on our wedding day. Bucky is going to know soon too, I'm counting on it. I swear they exchange reports on me regularly. Ma probably tells Buck to keep an eye on me, like she thinks I deliberately get myself into trouble. Can you imagine?”
Their team wins, Tony thinks, but he isn't really sure in the end. There's talk of a party, and Loki is dying to go because Thor will be there, the other footballers will be there, the cheerleaders will be there, even the opposing team will be there.
“Never,” Tony says valiantly, before immediately succumbing to a fresh wave of giggles as Steve’s fingertips find his ribs anew.
Tony thinks of the open eye of space above New York years and years and a lifetime ago, the closing oculus that would’ve swallowed him alive. Almost did swallow him whole. He thinks of the guts of the alien ship that took him lightyears from home, and the orange planet that lives behind his eyelids late at night. He can still taste the grit of red sand, a metallic tang between his teeth. He thinks of the endless tapestry of space, and realizing after fearing it for so many years, it’s quite beautiful after all and maybe it won’t be so bad to die out there in the black.
“So then why did you let me believe it was fake?” Tony demands. “Why did you let me think it was only to make Peggy jealous?”
“Steve,” Tony says, feeling a little bit irritated himself. “You refused my nice comfortable car and driver so we can take the subway? Why?”
No on the Audemars tonight, too gaudy. No on the Chopard, too flashy. The Patek Philippe isn’t quite right with the jacket and turtleneck either. His eyes linger on the Jaeger Rendez-Vous Celestial Steve got him for his birthday the year before and dismisses that too. The new unreleased Stark Watch prototype? His lips quirk in one corner. Pepper would kill him. Maybe no watch at all for the night.
Tony wasn't sure whether the tone he had heard in Barnes’s voice was simply shock or if there was a hint of disdain as well, but he figured at the time it was far too early in the game to antagonize Steve's best friend. He had supposed Barnes wasn’t one for Twitter, or he would’ve seen the photos of their relationship by now.
Tony gets his first clue from Loki and he should've had the foresight to leave school then. Leave and run as far away as possible and never come back.
It takes Tony nearly a week to work up the nerve to try to talk to Steve. When Steve gets worried about his nervous frenetic energy, Tony hastily blames it on Howard and locks himself in the labs, doing breathing exercises with his hand pushing against his chest, once again berating himself for his weakness.
too much. The rest of them? They're all little better than sheep. Everything will be paved and paid by mommy and daddy and none of them will want to reach beyond what they're given.”
Tony can feel his heart squeezing tight in his chest when Steve holds up a blown glass bauble and asks if Tony thinks Nebula would like it, and he can’t help the warm feeling that gushes up from his belly and fills his chest. His face aches from smiling so much and he gently plucks the glass dolphin from Steve’s hand to pull him in for a soft kiss, uncaring of the people surrounding them and the paparazzo across the street who had been tailing them all day.
“Lucky me,” Steve agrees, his shaky inhale sounding a lot like a sigh of relief. His grin spreads slow and warm on his face, lighting up his eyes and it's the most beautiful sight Tony's ever seen.
“As I was telling you,” Rhodey is saying to Steve where they're chatting on the couch, cups of hot cocoa in hand, “Tones is delicate.”
Rhodey and Pepper had both ignore him. “Besides, I'll come back for winter break,” Rhodey says. “You'll see me again in just a couple of months. They'll fly by in no time.” He grins widely, looking very proud of himself. “Get it?
“Sure thing,” he replies mildly, still refusing to turn. “I'll pencil you in for Friday at three. Next year. Scratch that, maybe in fifty years. I'm super duper booked until then so if you'll excuse me—”
He looks into the mirror to watch the both of them as he strokes his hands down Tony’s sides. The familiar warm skin feels like home beneath his palms. He loves the way they look together, the contrast of Tony’s olive skin against his own paler beige, colored by the inks of their tattoos. The way his own bigger shoulders frame Tony’s smaller size like a frame to a painting, Tony slotting perfectly into the circle of his arms.
Inside, the furniture is mismatched and overstuffed, comfortable old things that Howard would deem below him to even touch, but Tony gleefully runs his hands over all the soft worn fabrics. The walls are wrapped with faded blue wallpaper splashed with gardenias and little yellow flowers that bring sprigs of cheer throughout the rooms.
The question guts Tony like a knife, resurfaces the months of arguments he had with Howard and Uncle Obie. He's stunned into silence and his feet fall to a leaden stop.
The gravity of the day settles in Tony's stomach sometime around seven in the evening, minutes before everything is set to begin. He’s standing in front of the mirror, tugging at the cuffs of his sleeves and adjusting his collar. He twists his cufflinks for the fiftieth time, and makes one last attempt to smooth down the little flyaways around his hairline. He takes another cursory look at his reflection, critically cataloguing his appearance.
Tony can’t help the quiet laugh that escapes. He holds up the two halves of the Cartier in his hand and the little gold screwdriver alongside them. “Help,” Tony pouts.
“Fine,” Steve sighs. “Since you have so many stipulations, I’d like to add my own. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.”
Steve is at the door again. Tony tells Jarvis to send him away. Jarvis tells him Steve sat on the stoop for four hours this time. Tony tells him he doesn't care.
“You should be,” Tony replies, stripping off his coat and scarf. “I had to wait for over half an hour for a downtown train and I didn't give in to the urge to call an Uber. Why the hell does
Tony spends all his time building one armor after the next. He pulls up the schematics for the Mark L and he almost cries the first time he sees her again. He reuses that same nanotech and builds armor after armor, trying to get it just right. Soon he has twenty nine new suits. None of them are right. He starts over again.
“Yes, Jarvis,” Sarah nods, as though it's perfectly normal for everyone to have a butler, and for them to negotiate detention on behalf of their absent parents. “Probably one of the nicest people I've ever met but you should've seen the way he fought to keep the situation fair. We both agreed that the two of you had every right to defend yourselves. He didn't budge an inch on trying to get what was right for you, and to get justice for those bullies who picked on you and Steve.”
“Then,” Steve repeats, rolling the word over his tongue as though he's tasting it and not liking the flavor he finds. “Of course I was scared then too, when I was skinny and weak.”
“And I like a challenge,” Tony adds, measuring the flavoring carefully. The last two times he tried this, his batter came out cloyingly sweet like the scented candles Sarah loves. He wonders if it's too late to just write a check for the student union and just make a donation so he can forget this baking nonsense altogether. But he knows Steve would frown at that and the thought of Steve frowning makes something twist in Tony's gut.
“It wasn't real, Jarvis,” Tony says, wincing at the empty timbre of his tone. “Steve and I were never dating to begin with, it was all fake.”
He can’t believe Steve bothers to take the time every day to walk twelve blocks just to get him breakfast. All to make sure Tony eats. He can’t help but wonder if Steve is treating him so nicely when they aren’t really dating, how could he have said he was a bad boyfriend to Peggy? It’s impossible to think someone like Steve would be anything but amazing and perfect to whoever holds his affection.
By the time fourth period lunch rolls around, Tony is frantically unloading his textbooks from his locker into his bag. He's going home before something else happens. He is
“I dreamed often of Captain America when I was young,” Tony says, his voice dipping low and turning serious, “but Steve Rogers is beyond my wildest dreams.” An echo of their wedding vows that immediately springs tears to Steve’s eyes.
Outside the mansion, snow is fluttering down from a steel grey sky that is darkening deep purple, fat white flakes drifting lazily down from the clouds gathered above. From the windows, they can see Fifth Avenue sprawling aglow in bright cheerful yellow, warm and hazy in the winter fog.
A dark haired sophomore who Steve greets jovially as Peter runs up to them to take photos for the school newspaper. Peter snaps their photo as Steve pulls Tony close, turning slightly to press his lips against Tony's cheek. Tony thinks he might be blushing beet red, and he can only hope the paper only prints in black and white.
Steve looks gobsmacked, but he regains himself quickly just as another snowball hits him on the side of his face. His head snaps to the side to see Thor grinning gleefully from a few yards away, another handful of snow at the ready. Tony watched as Steve’s look of betrayal melts into one of determination as Steve launches snow back at Thor. Everything devolves into a snowball fight after that, and soon, everyone abandons their skis to participate in all out war.
him, and he thought he could be okay with that. He thought he could pick himself up, move on from this, and eventually one day, the pain in his chest might disappear. But to have Steve confess all of this, to have everything he’s ever wanted—Tony is not used to getting what he wants.
Tony hums contentedly as he snuggles up against Steve’s side. “Almost. I can take a little break. What are you working on?” he asks, nodding at the paper on Steve's knee.
He can't help but wonder how it would feel to have Steve call him his for real, and not just for pretend. Not as part of something that is meant to bring Steve back to someone else, but a real relationship, one that even has hope for the future because they’re both destined for Boston. What are the chances?
Tony wrinkles his nose and pretends to be disappointed. “Only pretty, baby girl? I thought I at least looked beautiful today. Possibly an eleven.”
. Even years ago, when they could've been something called friends, sitting together in detention week after week, even then Steve's dad—he was sick. And his mother had struggled so much to take care of her husband and son.
Steve finally puts Tony down when the rest of the school floods the field to congratulate the team. They're surrounded by celebrants offering congratulations but no matter how many people come up to them, Steve's hand is a constant warm weight between Tony's fingers. Steve shakes hands with the other team captain using his left hand because he refuses to let go of Tony for a single second, and Tony can't help but preen just a little at that.
He’s bright smiles and elaborate stories with Morgan, always picking her up to hold her close even as she’s growing too big for him to do that easily now. He’s science talk and bright encouragement with Peter, looking a little lost sometimes as though he thinks Peter will dissipate before his very eyes again. He’s engineering ideas and gentle banter with Harley, slinging advice and comforting arms around his eldest.
For a while the whole world stops. Or maybe not. Maybe just the room. But Steve is holding his breath, and he thinks that Coulson beside him is too.
He is watching the women through a one-way mirror. Coulson is standing silently behind him, ready to give the woman's identity to Fury and everyone else who needs to know in case Steve recognizes her.
He trails of, and Steve mentally kicks himself. He can hear the end of the sentence, in Maria Stark voice,
Natasha stays still for a moment, but then stands up. But before she gets to the door Coulson walks in. Maria Stark starts to laugh, not a real one, and Steve who has heard Doctor Dooms evil maniac laugh, think that laugh is less frightening then the sound she is making.
Steve doesn't know why this is what Tony chose to ask her about, and why this is what he is thinking of, not anything to do with him or whether she ever loved her own son, but with Howard, but he still tries to answer.
It is the fifth time it has happened now. And SHIELD is already used to it. Reed Richards machine is predicting the where and when with a 98,7 % accuracy. They pick her up before she even knows what is happening, and now she is sitting in a conference room at the Hellicarrier. A room decorated for this exact purpose. The room is bare, except for a table and two chairs. Since they discovered what was happening, Steve has been waiting for Howard to show up. But this, this is somehow worse. They didn't recognize her, and she didn't say anything, didn't even ask where, or when, she is. That's probably why SHIELD didn't do a DNA test at first. They didn't want to show their hand. Show her what science can do know. Not when there are other options available.
"Happiness and love are delusions the average man and woman use to get them through life, they're not real."
For a moment Steve wonders if Tony is only dating him to spite his parents, but if he was, the fact that he is dating captain America would probably get their interest must more than the fact he is from Brooklyn. This is simply Tony, answering honestly what his mother wants to know.
implied that Tony intended to keep this acquaintance going. It was nothing, less than a scrap, a bread crumb of affection – but Steve treasured it anyway. He couldn’t help it.
Bucky looked at him in bemusement, then pointed back at the curtain where The Diva could just be seen ushering a group of female patrons inside. Steve felt his mouth fall open. All the years they'd been coming here, he'd never connected the fabulous African-American lady on the door with the quiet, studious boy that used to sit behind him in home room. If they'd taken a vote for
. The song had been Tony's choice of drunken serenade the first night Steve had stayed here. The nickname, though significantly less scandalous than some of the ones Tony used when they were alone, never failed to make Steve blush.
in turn, only to be disappointed when they let him down. And now, so had Steve. That much was obvious from his face.
Indulging the urge, Steve raised his arm to begin; but his hand was bad today, and the clawed shape of his damaged fingers made him flinch. Tony wouldn't want that anywhere near him.
Stark was the bigger problem right now. Not only did he apparently not care about his precious armour, which he had left discarded behind him, he had seemed practically gleeful about killing the guard. Steve was reminded, again, just what sort of person he was working with.
'Excuse me,' he said, trying not to sound nervous or sleazy. 'I need, um, I need tampons. For my friend.'
Tony blinked at it, then rounded furiously on Spiderman, who had hopped down to ground level to join them. 'I thought you said it was a
'James,' Barnaby said, his voice rough and sad and oh, Steve wished he had just used his real damn name, 'I...' he sighed, a noise of pain and frustration that made Steve's heart break.
I have been overwhelmed by the kind comments and kudos left on the last chapter; so much so that I felt too guilty not to at least try and throw something together. This is an unedited piece so please forgive the roughness- I thought you might all appreciate some back story. Thanks everyone! :)
They counted together, in and out, trying to get his breathing under control. When Steve was sure the episode had passed, he took the mask off. Peter was immediately talking as if nothing had happened.
'The evidence would suggest otherwise,' Steve replied, calmly. 'Widow reckoned you had a voice kink; guess now we know for sure.' He sipped unconcernedly at his juice.
'Close. The ship is right over there.' Steve nodded over his shoulder. 'But... how did you know I was gone? You had him.' He nodded at the Skrull unconscious on the ground behind them.
'Nearly 10 dollars for two drinks,' Steve grumbled, politely declining to notice how Tony snatched the drink away from him and slurped greedily at it. Tony barely noticed his words, drinking his bubble tea like his life depended on it, which it honestly might at this point. He sort of remembered the bots bringing him sandwiches and glasses of water and many, many cups of coffee over the last 6 days, but he couldn't remember how much he had actually eaten or drunk. Not much, from the looks of things.
Less than 48 hours ago, news broke that Tony Stark had at last been retrieved alive from his captivity after going missing in January this year. In a statement released at the time, Obediah Stane, who had been filling in for Mr Stark, asked journalists to respect Mr Stark's privacy and his need to rest following his ordeal. It seems, however, that Mr Stark had other ideas.
'I... I...' he got no further, falling into sobs so severe that it was better described as a wail of pain, hurt so deep that the sound of it broke Peggy's heart. She steered him onto the settee, holding him close, trying to hold him together. She had never seen him like this.
Peter loaded his spoon up as high as he could – he was not the sort of child who would have tried to cunningly pass a small mouthful off as a big one – and shoved it into his mouth. Steve forced his face to remain neutral so Peter wouldn't see him thinking
'Let him in,' Tony said, trying to finish the particular bit he was working on, knowing Steve would wait for him to be done before saying whatever he wanted to say. It turned out, however, that this wasn't a business call – Steve entered the room silently, smiling at Tony as the mechanic glanced up at him. He was bearing a plate of pasta and a mug of coffee, which probably meant he had missed dinner again. Tony grunted his thanks and directed his attention back to what he was doing before he lost his thread of thought. Steve wouldn't interrupt him just for small talk at times like this; he was good like that. Or maybe he just didn't want to yell over the still-loud music.
He put the apparently white roses into the correct bucket, and stared at the others. The reds were deeply saturated and easy to spot, but there was so little difference between pink and white. He squinted at them desperately, wishing he had never mentioned colours at all.
'Ssh, now, Stark, ssh.' Thor's voice came more urgently. 'I know, but not here. Come away, come now.'
'You sick son of a bitch,' Tony said, walking over to the cell bars. For once, he didn't veil his insult in sarcasm or wit, just said viciously, 'We ought to string you up.'
Naturally, this caused a huge delay and a major shift in national attention as, in order to make Steve's testimony credible, he and Shield had to prove that yes, it was really him, yes, he was the original and yes, he had really been frozen for 70 years (but no, he had sadly not punched the real Hitler), by which time hardly anyone could remember what he had been supposed to have been testifying about in the first place. But Steve pulled them back on track, and told them everything that had happened from the day they had met (deftly avoiding the fact a four year old had super powers now), and when Tony read the transcript he was surprised, because there was so much he didn't know Steve had noticed. Every time he had had a moment of doubt, every time his better self had fought against the nature exaggerated by Venom, Steve seemed to have noticed it.
Tony walks out of the walk-in closet and stops in his tracks to catch Steve, naked, bending over to adjust the bedding.
There’s a silence between the two of them. Tony is shocked, the determination laced all over Steve’s expression as they lock eyes.
“Dammit, Rogers,” Tony muttered under his breath. Steve was setting him up. This wasn’t fair to him at all. Nope. Not one bit.
Steve takes a little longer than usual to reply, the short extended silence making way for Tony to turn back towards to see Steve biting his bottom lip.
students most likely had a gap in their schedule, like a period for study hall, or maybe that gap was filled with an elective.
Tony, with Steve’s assistance, leans back at an angle. He was gonna get the most out of his ride so he participated more, driving himself higher and back down in longer strides, bringing himself on edge. Steve could see how much Tony was enjoying it and–
“I live here. I know my rights. I pay my taxes, too. Pretty sure I can enjoy the privacy and comfort of my abode half-clad.”
was neatly written on the name line at the top left of the page, and just above it was the title of the lesson. There was a typographical error in it.
Tony reaches up to capture Steve’s lips with his own. He takes Tony by surprise and pulls them closer, wanting to be as close as possible.
It was a treat for Tony, testing how much it took for Steve to break his angelic façade. Seeing Steve tip over the edge and bring out his dominant persona.
They kiss one more time before Steve proceeds to pack up for the day and head home. Tony walks back into his own classroom and puts his tablet back in the empty pocket of his bag.
“Nobody licks a spoon for that long. Plus, you had your suspicions and you thought it was a good idea to tease me about it. I’d never been so conflicted in my life.”
Tony feels his phone buzz in his pocket, mentally cursing at himself for not silencing it before administering the test. Usually it just lit up when a notification came through when it was on Silent Mode.
The halls are usually physically vacant in terms of bodies, except for the occasional occurrence of someone exiting a classroom, needing a bathroom break or grabbing a few copies of papers from the printer.
Tony used a set of patterns consisting of a sequence of tongue movements and sucking intensities. Sometimes they were calculated and planned, other times they were random. Tony could go slow and make Steve’s knees turn into jelly, or pick up the pace and make his husband’s body involuntarily jerk in desperation for an orgasm.
It was an opportunity for Tony to spam Steve with texts, but he knew Steve was dedicated to preparing his kids for the Spanish tests at the end of the year.
They may have semi-christened this specific table more than they could count on fingers and toes combined. Neither of them regret it.
Tony smiles to himself when he turns his head to see Steve squirm a little before facing him. The brunet cocks an eyebrow in satisfaction at his husband. The blue-eyed man squints at him, then diverts his attention to his phone, typing away at the screen.
“You’re not so talkative anymore, Tones,” Steve smirks, licking a stripe up Tony’s neck, a mess of vibrations from the sexual cheers rising out of him.
“…hush, Steven. No need to stammer. I’m just taking it all in. No judgment. If you wanna do some anal bead stuff on me, then sure. I’m down. First time for everything, right?”
They both eyed each other, Steve now joined in on Tony’s helpless moaning melodies, probably now alerting the neighbors.
“Nothing, Beefy. I’m just admiring you,” he lingers, slowly running a finger down the middle of Steve’s accented muscles toward his happy trail.
“Aha. We were living together in your apartment after we established our dating phase. My foreign studies class was coming home.”
“I can’t survive the whole day on fruit juice at three in the morning, Amor,” Steve chuckles, setting Tony down on the shower bench.
“I gave you…that name…Which…means, you’re…mine. Especially…this mouth,” Tony huffed frantically, after pulling away with a loud
This isn't comepletely smut, there's a decent portion of fluff and some foreplay along with dialogue. Don't worry, there's more to come in the next few chapters.
Both Steve and Tony had to stay in the school building for after-school hours. The foreign language teachers had to have their meetings of planning for their test days for the end of the year. Tony was in his room waiting for a few students from his classes and others to pile in his room, either for peer help or specific topics they may be stuck on that require his attention.
The shorter of the two turns around to face the other, resting his hands on the blond’s thighs, squeezing gently and rubbing up and down. Tony looks up into Steve’s blue eyes and softly says “Something about the phrase ‘wassup,’ I think” before leaning in to kiss Steve.
“Tony, there are kids in here. Have some dignity,” Steve blushed, nodding his head once over to the students on the other side of the room. Tony couldn’t help but smirk,
“It’s Rogers…hyphen…Stark…to you,” Rogers–Stark corrected, getting his tongue sucked out of his mouth in circular motions. He couldn’t help the moans escaping his own lips this time. It turned him on more that Tony was eating up his moans, knowing exactly how to get him riled up.
Steve hides his face from Tony’s view in a fit of flustering. He knows Tony is mentally congratulating himself for a win.
Steven, as modest and pure as he was in public (except for behind bedroom windows for neighbors to see), he only saved his sexual side for Tony behind closed doors.
“Well it’s not like you didn’t know what I was doing. You should’ve stayed in the bathroom and given me a helping hand instead of being weird for two weeks.”
“Did you just call me a gatekeeper? My gates are literally open and you’re not even taking advantage,” Tony pouts, wrapping a leg around Steve’s torso.
Tony really had nothing mandatory to do right now, turning Acadia High School into an almost-paperless educational facility was on the list of wants. He couldn’t leave the classroom unless it was to retrieve something important, like extra hard copies of material or a mandatory blank list of attendees to physically mark down in case of a fire drill. Not even to walk to the classroom across the hall to satisfy his craving for the blonde’s lips.
“That is so corny. Don’t ever say ‘cocky’ in that context again,” Steve laughs, squeezing the hand holding Tony’s.
“Yeah? What else?” Tony snickers, knowingly aware that Steve’s intended answer was overpowered by his bodily responses, slight jerking and writhing against the bed.
“Hey, hey. Don’t be shy, Stevie. We can talk about this later at home. I can freeze your account right now to prevent any further charges. How about that? Then we can talk about whatever sexual fantasy you’re hiding after dinner.”
“Do you remember that one time when you argued with that lady at the bank a few months after we got married?”
Tony’s body trembled, kindling a manner of coveting that not even his younger self could approach had he had the ability to reverse time.
In one swift move, Steve crouches down a little to run his hands down the undersides of Tony’s thighs before picking him up. Tony was able to catch on quickly and wrap his arms around Steve’s neck as he was carried to the back table.
Steve had pushed the curtains back as soon as Tony’s phone was provoked with an alarm. He was sweaty and panting a bit from his run on the treadmill, but that didn’t stop him from ambushing Tony’s sleep.
Tony saw a notification on his screen. He tapped on it and was brought to his thread of text messages with Steve.
“Practice makes perfect,” he smirks, “plus, you've been teasing me for the longest, I’m merely waiting to give you what you want.”
“Mmm, I know, babe. Thanks in advance for lunch,” he replies, giving Tony a kiss, “don’t think about it too much.”
Tony stood up on the tips of his toes to kiss Steve before Steve let go to head down to the laundry room.
Tony turned to the sound of the voice coming from his left. It was a student, not his, but definitely someone he recognized in the halls. He had a piece of paper and a pencil in his hand. Aiden or Andrew or something, Tony wasn’t sure.
“If you wanted to go through my phone, you simply could’ve asked. I’ve got lots of ass shots in there.”
“Mmm…what’s that…mean again…Rogers?” Tony manages to inquire in between their tonguing tango. Steve had managed to tuck his hands under Tony’s shirt, fanning his fingers over the soft but taught and smooth skin of the man above him.
Barnes was on the other side of the massive room, which held up around 200 students, give or take, on a daily basis. He was the other gym teacher, the more relaxed and chill type, always encouraging kids to stay healthy, both mentally and physically.
“Rhetorical question,” Steve chuckles as he rests his own hands on top of Tony’s, feeling Tony’s wedding ring under his own right hand.
Steve had no shame in exposing his nude and muscular form for his husband. He himself knew he was a good-looking guy, much to Tony’s consistent agreement and appraisal. With his workouts after getting done with work at home and before getting ready for work in the morning, it provided him a boost of self-confidence, better stamina, and longer performance activities.
Steve had tilted Tony’s chin to kiss him. He was horny and in love and just wanted to treat Tony to a much needed attitude adjustment. A nice weekend dicking and Tony would come crawling back for an encore, doing everything to get more until he decided to give up.
“First you bribe me for dick pics and now you want to model my ass to the world for ‘educational’ purposes? If that’s not prostitution, I don’t know what is at this point.”
“Sounds like some kind of quid pro quo you won’t tell me about until afterwards. What are you trying to get out of it?”
Tony loved everything about Steve’s dick. From the way it rested on Steve’s stomach when he laid on his back to the form it took when standing at full attention awaiting torturous pleasure.
I've added a new element at the beginning of the chapter. This will be a recurring occassion in future chapters, but not every future chapter.
Steve can’t help but let out a little chuckle. He wouldn’t admit it out loud, but he loves all of the nicknames Tony gives him. Especially
“Better not have, or else you and I would’ve had some problems. No calculator in the world could have been able to help you come to a solution.”
Tony takes Steve in all the way to the hilt; then all the way off, repeating the action for a couple more times as Steve starts to write against the bed a little. He sees a hand gripping the bedsheets and decides to grab it, interlacing his fingers with it while carrying on with his mouthy ministrations.
The thought of Tony putting these horny kids to shame about lusting after his husband made him silently moan. The other part that aroused him was Steve’s suggestion of one of Tony’s many kinks: exhibitionism.
The halls are frequently bright throughout school hours and beyond, always welcoming the rays of sunshine through its wide windows. They sometimes shined on some of the blue lockers that hid the doors of the classrooms and offices from a certain point of view.
Steve reaches over to grab the large squeeze tube of lube under the pillow he rests on, resting back on top of Tony and presenting it to him.
Steve retrieves Tony’s tablet from his classroom and comes back out. He shows Tony a screen that displays the recent charges on his credit account. Tony takes the tablet and looks it over.
He searches the drawers of Steve’s nightstand for the lube. When he sees there is none in sight, he checks the walk-in closet containing Steve’s smaller belongings for any hope.
Tony grabs onto Steve’s arms as his lean figure are pulled into the multitude of clothed abs and pecs, the arms that could hold for hours on end and long legs that could amaze even the straightest of men.
This chapter and the next are for getting BB & TT to 2000 hits, something I never anticipated to happen in 30 days.
Tony simply smiled. The kid was probably only a freshman or a sophomore, and probably didn’t even know him that well. A simple prefix mistake wasn’t going to bother him.
“Look here, Mister, if you think you can boss me around by telling me to do what I’m already doing, then why don’t you make me–
“Yeah, but it was weird for me. Seeing you like that was just, I don’t know…it felt new and unknown. I felt like I was getting lured into porn.”
“Mmm, I love it when you talk numbers,” Tony purred, pulling at Steve’s shirt, wanting to get it off. He didn’t care if it ripped off, he always had spares for situations like this. Plus, he thought it would be enticing to see how hard Steve would try to stay professional and composed in front of a bunch of high schoolers while shirtless.
“I want to. Plus, that whole First Amendment slash HR thing kinda turned me on,” Tony replies, waking closer to the sink next to Steve.
! or a combination or variant of the two that Tony could only pronounce. Every other time it was incoherent or just a tune Steve liked to hear coming from Tony.
“Can’t do that if you don’t give me your full and undivided attention,” Steve coos, laying next to Tony on the bed as he swipes Tony’s phone out of his hand.
“Fucking tease,” Tony muttered under his breath. He couldn’t believe Steve didn’t even spare him any details. The multilingual man shot him a glance, earning an eye roll from the math wizard.
“The lube. I couldn’t find any other tubes in your nightstand so I’m in the closet to see if you have any extra in here.”
Steve didn’t answer back, just glared some more. Tony was getting anxious, waiting for a change in reaction or a reply. He finally got one when Steve stood up, tablet in hand, and walked across the hall into his own classroom. He opened the door and glided in, turning behind him and lifting his shirt a little before closing the door.
“Imagining me shirtless again?” Steve teased, removing his right hand from Tony’s back to intertwine his fingers with those of Tony's left hand.
“You told me not to use ‘cocky’ in that context and now you're breaking your own rules. Jesus never broke his own rules,” Tony pouted.
“I know the numbers are more your department, but I got an alert on my phone about a purchase that was made with my card. I compared the list on the app there with the list I personally made and the numbers don’t match up. Then I looked over the list on the app again, and I found a purchase for…”
The bell signifying the end of 5th Period was going to ring soon, and then students would be racing down the halls and stairs to their next destinations.
Tony runs his hand up Steve’s chest, circling his hands on Steve’s pecs as his palms continually graze the nipples, earning a soft moan from the blond.
I should have gone with "Tony the Tapper & Steve the Sapper" now that I think of it, but it's not the only thing I'm writing about. If anyone wants to use that title for a tale of oral excursions, go on ahead lmao, just make sure you mention me.
Tony looks up and sees Steve standing tense, tightly gripping the door frame with a worried look on his face.
“You didn’t notice the giant festive box with Christmas colors in the recycling bin at all this week?”
“Might have to take another shower to make sure they’re all gone. I can help you check, if you’re into that kind of thing.”
“I see. A lot of students have a slightly difficult time wrapping their head around this topic, you’re not alone. They’re both forms of combining, so what you want to do with these kinds of things is to watch your signs. Adding variables changes the coefficient, multiplying variables changes the exponent. It’s one of the reasons why your previous math teachers in middle school ditched ‘x’ as an indication to multiply, now you have dots and parentheses to do the exact same thing, just a cleaner setup with variables involved.”
“You drifted off there. Are you alright?” Steve inquires, rubbing up and down Tony’s back and sides, his eyebrows inched towards each other in a look of concern.
