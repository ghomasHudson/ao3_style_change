it's technically only half a date, really, but I wanted each of the two very important things that are happening here to have their own chapter to stand out in.
He showed the picture to a few of the locals who were waiting for transit buses. He struck gold 10 minutes in.
Most days he rushed right through the area, but today he felt his steps slow of their own volition, and before he was even aware that he was doing it, he was turning his head this way and that, looking for it. Something sounded funny. He followed the sound to a bus that was loading. The sign by the door said it was headed to Cleveland. Leaving in 10 minutes, if it was on schedule.
“That’s an expensive costume. That – that didn’t come out of some cheap Halloween party store, Charlie.”
“I was your shield, first. Then your tool. Your friend. Your family. Everything I am now… everything I’ll ever be, is somehow connected to you.”
“You can tell me to mind my own, Dean. I can respect that, just like I always did, even when we were attached at the hip. But don’t insult my intelligence. Say what you mean.”
In the morning, he went to fuel up his vehicle and saw a help wanted sign in the window. They wanted someone to fill in for a couple of weeks to cover the night shift guy’s vacation. And Cas figured, why not? He could sleep in the car, and there was a truck stop around back where he could get a cheap shower and a solid meal, if he got tired of living on snacks and leftover pizza slices. Since it was only a couple of weeks, they were glad to just pay him in cash, and that would keep him on this road trip much longer.
Dean leaned back against the wall. He had not seen this coming at all. Cas wanted to kiss some other guy. He probably didn’t even drive anything that could compare to the Impala. Slowly, he made his way to his own room, wondering where he could find a Queen CD in the morning.
They showed him how to operate the mp3 player and the CD player and between that and picking out songs it was dinner time before Cas had any opportunity to even think about the Uber driver, much less contemplate the possibility of calling him. Dean made everyone burgers and home fries, while Sam fixed himself a nice side salad, and they ate in the sort of companionable peace they hadn’t enjoyed in a while.
“He’s… not doing well. Snake bite, about 10 hours ago. They’re not sure what kind of snake and he’s not responding to the limited treatments they have available there.”
“Meet Dean, Garth, Benny, and Kevin. Someday we’ll rock the local pumpkin festival and you’ll be able to say you knew us when.”
As soon as Dean was back, Castiel presented his badge, setting aside the niceties and getting down to the business of the opening formalities.
Normally Dean would say something about how when you go to college you’re supposed to go and get drunk on Friday nights or some such nonsense. He’d always wanted more than anything for Sam to be normal. Even in the somewhat unhealthy ways of normal people. But he was watching teens help a kid, and remembering all the times he (and Cas) had helped Sam figure out things. Riding a bike. Tying his shoes. Throwing a punch.
With Vader dealt with, Dean turned his attention to the surrounding area. There was a hallway leading to a number of conference rooms, but they’d checked the rooms already and they were too far for anything going on here to draw attention from. Booths. But those were manned and there was too much risk of discovery. No outside windows. No service doors. What had he said when he snickered?
It was too early to sleep and he knew that if he didn’t keep his mind busy he would fall apart. So he tinkered with his videos and ultimately decided that he needed to store them somewhere other than his phone. For starters, because what if he lost his phone? He didn’t like cloud storage, as a rule, and that had limits too, so it hardly seemed like much of an improvement. And also, because he always seemed to end up recording fairly long videos, and even if he did ultimately trim them down to a reasonable size, he needed the room to accommodate the initial recording. That’s how he ended up uploading them to YouTube and falling asleep while he waited for the slow, slow motel wifi to get it done.
“Y’all, I’d like to introduce you to Rock Covers Paper.” Castiel’s head briefly popped into the frame. “We literally just came up with that name. What do you think?”
Everyone glanced around at each other, looking for answers. It couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, but in that time, Dean’s agitation increased significantly.
Three more steps and Cas was reaching again. Dean lunged forward. Almost there. Then he heard a grunt, and before he knew what was happening he was pinned against the wall.
“You couldn’t identify it because it’s original. I’ve been sort of writing a song for years. And as it turns out I’ve joined a band and we’re going to make a classic rock version of it, so I thought, before it changes permanently, I’d sing it for you, just this once, the way I hear it in my head.”
That should be neutral enough, right? She nodded and seemed about to say something, but stopped herself, seemed to think better of it, and then sat on the bed, next to Dean.
“It’s a bomb, isn’t it?” Dean turned around to see that Charlie was finally off the phone and assisting Cas with the arrest. “You’re here to trigger it, probably. This place is huge, and it has a lot of security today but a couple of days ago, it would have been quiet. Much better time to plant a bomb. But where? And why didn’t you leave? Why stick around long enough to get caught?”
How bizarre was that? That the most we worried about now was getting his feelings hurt, or Sammy and Eileen not working out, or Claire or Donna or some other of their friends running into the sort of trouble everyone ran into? Normal, everyday stuff. He should be terrified but he’d beaten god. How terrifying could old age be? Taxes? And he could have all the things he’d never been able to have before to look forward to. He could get a pet without being afraid of not coming home to take care of it. He had a future now. A real one. He was going to get old. How terrifying could death be, when he knew in his bones he'd die of old age in his bed someday and then he’d wake up in Heaven and Cas would be there. Forever was a real thing for Dean Winchester and it was like a game he couldn’t lose, as long as Cas was there.
“You’re a mind reader, right? That’s how it works. You can read parts of my mind even I don’t know about.”
They started to get somewhere when Cas wanted to know why the boy wanted to hang out with the girl that made him sad and why he can’t see that clearly the girl next door is a better mate, even though he appears to return her feelings from the start, if the video Sam pulled up on his phone was anything to go by. That required an explanation of teenage hormones, and how miserable boys that age are willing to get if it has a chance of getting them laid.
Truth be told, if he thought they were just going to frighten the girl, he’d be less worried about it. He’d heard too much of their racist bull to be confident that was all they would do with an opportunity like this.
“Frankly, I thought she was the only one who would actually care. She was certainly the only one who called. My phone. Which I had with me the whole time.”
Castiel had been wrong before. What intelligent adult hadn’t? But he had never, ever been more wrong than he’d been at the door. Or any time he’d pondered the potentially beneficial uses of hypervigilance.
Slowly, he traced the flesh under his fingertips, found his way in, and felt the shudder that went through Dean when he did. He made himself explore for a moment, his fingers pulling Dean closer. Later he would try to figure out how he lost the last shred of reason. Was it Dean’s whimper? The hardness of Dean’s erection pressed into Castiel’s? The wetness around his fingers? He didn’t know, and he couldn’t bring himself to care.  He lost it, released Dean’s ass just long enough to undo his own pants, and then he was angling Dean’s hips and burying himself deep. All the way in. Dean’s legs locked around his hips, and without further ado, Castiel fucked him into next Tuesday, right there, against the wall.
He made his way back to the nurse’s station, and noticed a sort of supply room behind it, well stocked. And to his right, the first thing that seemed entirely out of place. Double doors. But not like hospital double doors. More like the sort of double doors you’d expect to see leading to a board room. He tested the doors and found them unlocked.
Having arranged everything exactly to his satisfaction, Cas smiled to himself and picked up a slice. After all the meticulous care, it seemed reasonable to expect that Cas would carefully select a piece, and nibble at it delicately. He did not. He picked up the piece nearest to him and stuck the whole thing in his mouth. Dean watched his lips close around it, the movement of his jaw as he chewed it, and the way his throat moved when he swallowed.
“I don’t know. I didn’t think he’d ever be back here after he just disappeared in the middle of the night,” he confessed. “I don’t know what to think.”
They moved away from the door then, converging on the pastries. It had been a long morning all around. There was no sense letting them go to waste.
Dean flipped the tape and looked at the cover. For side B there were no notes, only tracks. The first one was “The Impossible Dream”.
Walking up behind the sofa, Dean touched Castiel’s shoulder to let him know Dean was there, then gently started to rub his temples. Cas relaxed under his touch, almost curling into it. Dean could feel himself lean in, drawn closer despite his best intentions. When he finally moved away, Cas had dozed off again.
She hesitated, took a deep breath, and pulled out her notes. They’d been feeling their feelings for weeks now, dammit. Right now they needed to focus on doing something about it.
“Cas called me last night. Well, this morning, I guess,” she started. She felt Dean close up and added. “It was a drunk dial. He’s…”
Dean froze, afraid to touch anything or do anything before checking in with Cas. He made himself wait a couple of minutes, then walked out, and with an apologetic smile interrupted the woman again.
It took them a few minutes to approach, no doubt checking him out to make sure it was safe (was he alone? did he look suspicious? Who the hell knew what these morons were even looking for) but eventually they got their own slices of meat lovers pizza and sat down at Castiel’s table, commenting to each other how smart it was that they went with that for a signal because these days everyone was a vegan and “you can’t even say you like meat” anymore. (Some people are really desperate for attention, he’d found.)
“I found a teenage girl who died right here recently. She didn’t come up before because it wasn’t a mysterious death. She died of cancer.”
“We finished the song, and since you wanted to hear the new version, here it is. We hope you like it. Let us know in the comments. Everyone, I present to you, Rock Covers Paper’s first original song, No one to share it with.”
He might, just possibly, also have given himself permission to just look at the man for a moment in privacy and truly appreciate what he was looking at without creeping him out. What were the chances he was even into guys, anyway? And if he was, what were the chances he was potentially interested in Castiel? Assuming that once they were done here and went their separate ways Castiel would even try to reconnect on a personal level. Which was assuming a lot. His math was a bit rusty these days, but those were probably not great odds.
“That’s right, honey,” the older guy (Jones) replied, in the sort of tone that warned Castiel that he was up to something. "You wanna see my gun?"
Significant looks were shared all around, and they left, leaving Garth to keep them from coming to blows.
He grabbed all the cash he could get his hands on, debated taking the cards, then decided to take only his own debit card. He was going to try to do this without his dad’s cards. Like an adult. He’d just go until he ran out of money, and then he’d come back home and make some hard decisions.
“Did you think you could just waltz into a rebel base and blend in? What are you doing here?” Han paused a moment and then rephrased. “What did you do?”
“This is what it’s like, you know. You call it falling. Everyone calls it falling. But a fall is something that happens to you. It’s involuntary. It’s an accident. It’s quick and unexpected and out of your control.” Cas explained. “I suppose that’s Heaven’s way of controlling the narrative. It’s perfect up here. Nobody would want to leave. If an angel is now human, well, they didn’t mean it, it just happened, it couldn’t be helped. They didn’t know that wall was there and they just fell.”
They hadn’t made any grand announcements, but Sam was no idiot and he had eyes.  So for the next few days he gave them plenty of space, and did not ever ask himself what they were up to. Still, it was Dr. Sexy night again, and they were MIA. He was asking himself if he should go knock on a door and remind them when they came into the room, dressed to go out.
All the roaming lead to wiggling, which made all sort of small fires start up in all sorts of interesting places. Dean’s other leg went around Castiel’s other hip, Castiel’s arms locked into Dean’s shoulders as his mouth went to work on Dean’s neck, the arch he had to put into his back to reach it pushing his hips into Dean in the most delicious way.
“Remember about 5 months ago, when we were working on that drug ring case? Benny and I were on a stakeout, but I was alone in the car for a bit because Benny had to go use the bathroom or something. Anyway, it’s still pretty early in the evening and quiet, and suddenly this guy comes over and asks me to move the car. He gives me some lame excuse about needing the space, but he’s kinda antsy and when I explain I’m not moving, I have to wait for somebody. He tells me some crazy story about a bet with his girlfriend and begs me to just drive around the block once. He says he’ll wait right there and tell the guy I’m waiting for that I’ll be right back. I figure, this guy is distracting, and pushy, and he’s not going away, so easier if I just go around the block once and then if he doesn’t go away, Benny should be back and he can deal with it while I watch the building, right? I don’t want to pull out my badge, cause who knows what he’s going to do with that information, and if I call for someone to come get him, that will take a while, so-”
“We’re actually still working that out. We didn’t really want to make decisions until we had everyone.”
“We’re a couple of blocks away, Cas, and I can take care of myself. I’ll be fine. I’ll see you around.”
Dean took another wedge, and watched Cas finish his apple, the tension building between them as the song built as well.
“You can have this room. Or any of the others, I guess, if you prefer. This one is closer to me, so -”
And yep, sure enough, right on the stage was a life-size R2-D2 model, with LED lights in all the relevant places and rigged to make all the right noises. Dean bent over the model looking for some way to get into it.
“No. You’re here to talk about this,” and he slid a picture out of the folder and in front of Dean. A picture of an AR-15 on the floor of a movie theater.
“You said – You said you had things you needed to learn, and you wanted my help. I said I’d help, but then I didn’t. That was because in my head you were saying that so that you could pretend not to know what you were doing when you tried to hurt me at some later time. It’s not you. My brain just does that. With everyone. All the time. The truth is, there’s nothing you could have said or done that would have made a difference then.”
It had been rough, the first week. But if there was one thing Castiel was well used to, it was being hurt and left behind by the people he loved. He was a pro at compartmentalizing by this point in his life. A month in, this was really the only time Dean was inescapable. When he set up the phone to record and sat in the moment, holding the guitar he’d bought to play in the band he’d joined with Dean, wondering if Dean had been here when he travelled around with his father, wishing he was here now, thinking about showing him where he’d been since he’d left, he couldn’t shut Dean away.
“Come on, you must be starving,” Cas heard himself say as they settled back into the car. “It’s getting too late to keep going today, anyway. Dinner is on me. You earned it.”
The next track should need very little in the way of elaboration, so Cas strolled to the kitchen in search of a drink. Dean looked at the tape cover and smiled. It listed “When the going gets though,” the only annotation being “karaoke night”. That was enough. There had really only ever been one, and Dean remembered it clearly, though he had pretended to be too drunk to recall it.
“I don’t KNOW, Cas. But I hear the alarm loud and clear here, and we’re talking 4 alarm fire. Get her OUT.”
Detective Novak had been called in to the multiplex where, as far as he could tell, nothing worthy of his time had in fact happened.
What was he worried about now? He nosed reassuringly at Castiel’s scent gland and dropped a few gentle licks around it.
Dean nodded, pretty sure he wouldn’t be able to get any words through his clenched jaw, and disappeared into the bathroom.
Cas never had that experience with his own grandmother, but he’d heard it often enough to know what Dean was talking about so he nodded.
Sam sighed, looking at Dean as if he couldn’t quite convince himself that it was really a good idea to talk about this. It made him think of when Sammy couldn’t let go of the things he couldn’t remember and ended up breaking down the mental walls Cas has used to protect him. Yeah, this would probably not be pretty, but he needed to know. Maybe Sammy was thinking of it too because he finally seemed to make up his mind and went on.
They had to try it, of course. And so the comforter was produced, and arranged on the floor, and a few rounds later, laughing and breathing hard from exertion, they found the mood changing. In the blink of an eye, they were rolling around again, hands and lips all over each other, struggling for a different kind of control. Working to remove layers without sacrificing any more contact than they had to.
He felt the amusement that had been building in Cas since Michael came in fade fast, replaced with anger.
It dawned on Cas then that they were here to bring him home. Dean, and apparently Charlie and Ellen, had come to bring him home. That was the plan. He thought to himself that Dean always found a way to bring him home. His legs seemed to agree with his assessment because they allowed him to move again, and he found that he was advancing on Dean.
“Dean, all the questions just… faded away. You looked happier than I’d ever seen you, relaxed and at peace. Your fingers were drumming along to the beat on Baby’s steering wheel, the sun was playing across your face, spotlighting your freckles, adding highlights to your hair, and you looked –“
And indeed the gravity of his posture and tone indicated something far more serious than a random juvenile prank. Harry led the way to the theater room.
Should he check? He could just grab his phone, text Dean, and ask him to clarify what he’d meant. But that would be awkward, especially if he really meant a
Then he took a deep breath, letting the scent do the rest of the work. Confident, happy Cas was everything he’d ever needed, it seemed. He might have figured that out sooner if he’d done what he had agreed to do and helped Cas find his feet.
Nods all around, and everyone started packing their instruments. Not needing to pack anything, Cas made his way to the garage door, stopping just short of walking out and turning.
“Depending on how involved you want to be, you might need a PI license. But the idea is for it to be a lot like the work we’ve done together. Only of course, we’ll have to call the police to come do the arresting,” he droned on.
“What if the plan was never to blow up the mall at all, and they just wanted a building that could stand in for a convention center? What if that’s why they’re not here?”
“You really should be prouder of your kid. He knows how to get himself out of trouble. I know he didn’t learn that from you.”
Frank’s eyes widened, for a moment. He nodded and Dr Sexy scribbled his address on a prescription pad.
“Well, hot damn!” Dean made much of looking at the time. “What time is it? Is 4 am too early to call Bobby and quit my job?”
Suddenly it’s not just about Cas anymore. He feels… ravenous. In one smooth motion, he moves up and pulls Cas to meet him half-way. Dean settles over Castiel’s body, mouth closing on the pulse point in his neck, and Cas arches up to meet him. And now it’s Dean’s body that shudders, and it’s all he can do to keep some of his weight on his elbows with Cas grinding up into him. With both of them grinding into each other. It feels like a heartbeat later when Cas bucks and keens his name, and then Cas is reaching between them and sending Dean over the edge with him.
“Mr. Novak, Mrs. Novak. You are wanted in connection to several felonies in my jurisdiction. Be advised that if you are seen in the area you will be apprehended and held for questioning.”
Cas checked on him in the morning but didn’t stay long. The doctor was there to clear him medically. He was declared recovered from the effects of the bites but needing to rest and restore his strength for a few days. The monitors and IV were removed. This time he got eggs and toast. He was promised meat for dinner if his stomach handled breakfast and lunch well enough. He babied his stomach all morning and felt well enough to stand up and walk around without help by lunch time.
He should have greeted Cas. That was stupid, of course he should have greeted Cas. Dean ran his hand through his hair and tried again, turning around to face Cas.
Sam slumped into his chair, shaking his head. Why was everybody on his case all of a sudden? What the hell was going on here? Sam wasn’t helping, so he went after Cas. He was going to get some goddamn answers, and he was going to get them right now.
In the last few months, Castiel had abandoned all thought about what he was and wasn’t supposed to do. In fact, he did at least half a dozen things he wasn’t supposed to do on the daily now. He found it quite fulfilling and literally liberating. So as he drove up to the walls of Eden less than two hours later, he did not concern himself in the slightest that he was about to do something he was not supposed to do.
So he backed away, this time. Locked himself in his bedroom as if all the hounds of hell were on his tail, determined to stay there until he could figure this out.
The man moved, his coat coming open in the process, and the man moved as if to reach an inside pocket.
They’d been in some small town and headed for the only bar they could find after the hunt. Cas had lost his grace. If he remembered correctly, it was after he discovered sex (and coffee) but he was still struggling with sleep, going to bed only when he was completely exhausted, and sleeping even less than Dean. Sam had gone to bed. He’d said something about wanting to be up early for a jog before they hit the road. Dean was too hyped to sleep, and Cas had tagged along to keep him out of trouble. At least that was the idea. They’d both ended up getting trashed, though, now that he thought of it, neither one of them had much of a hangover the next day, so maybe they weren’t as drunk as they let on.
“It sounds really creepy, right? But it’s just that he’s trying to learn to identify smells. He never learned, I guess, growing up. He can pick out the big ones, you know. Fear, arousal, happiness… But the more subtle feelings he struggles with.”
“My delivery instructions say to leave it the basket just like this on his desk. Also, can you make sure that it’s clear of any papers or unvarnished wood or any kind of leather or-”
Dean took a break from enjoying the spectacle to glance at Cas. This was new. He was probably pissed. It was telling that Cas didn’t even seem surprised.
walked out of the bunker that day. And more than that, he had said that it was time to move on, and he found that he meant it. He was tired. He was tired of Dean’s shitty attitude, he was tired of pretending he didn’t know he was being jerked around, and he was tired of telling himself that Dean was just pissed and he had no coping skills. He may have, at one time, been an angel of the lord, but he was tired of turning the other cheek and being Dean’s metaphorical punching bag. More than anything, he was tired of waiting patiently for Dean to get his head out of his ass. While a few years hadn’t seemed like such a long time to wait when he had grace and the unlimited time it gave him, he was dangerously close to being just another human now, and time had become rather more significant than it used to be. He didn’t have any to waste anymore.
Dean smiled for a moment. Better than he’d felt in a long time. But he’d decided, back in Eden, sitting with his back to the warm rock, that if he had another shot at this, he wouldn’t push it. So he let the alpha’s familiar scent relax him, and coached himself to take it nice and easy. Let Cas set the tone, here.
He was exhausted, and he wanted nothing more than to curl up with Castiel’s warm body and drift off to sleep in his arms. But he had to clean up, and get back into a very large, very cold, very empty bed. He was a stupid, stupid omega.
He must have lit up like a Christmas tree, because he saw the smile spread from Castiel’s eyes to his entire face. He nudged Sammy with his elbow and reached for his beer, lifted it up, and waited until they raised theirs. Cas first, then Sammy, and Eileen a heartbeat behind. They looked at each other expectantly.
Cas woke up a few hours later feeling much better. He stretched, walked into the library and found Sam and Dean bent over a laptop, picking out songs. They looked up when he walked in.
It should be noted Dean had just been looking for an excuse to step away from the woman and her hostile vibes, and did not, in fact, need to use the bathroom. Which was fortunate, because as he closed the door and stood in front of the mirror, he promptly forgot the reason he was there. There were two toothbrushes. One of them was Captain America themed. A kid lived here. But she had said she lived alone.
Cas walked into his office, oblivious to the people waiting outside. He walked within a few feet of them, just on the other side of a very large window. Close enough that they were worried he might see them and derail the plan. But he moved like his perfectly tailored suit weighed a ton, his eyes on a phone they’d never seen before. He walked past his assistant, despite her attempts to get his attention, and closed the office door behind him with a thump.
Yeah, so this was a new thing that was happening since Cas came back. It’s like he hung out with the kids from the wrong side of town and picked up an attitude and a whole new vocabulary somehow. Dean was not too fond of surprises, and Cas had been a constant in his life long enough that he didn’t appreciate this kind of change.
When all the messages started coming in, his heart broke all over again. He waited for the phone to stop buzzing, the flash of the notifications before his eyes adding guilt to all that was already weighing him down. Charlie had clearly sent about a million texts, and before he got the chance to wonder why Dean hadn’t, he saw that there were dozens of voicemails. Resigning himself to having a killer hangover tomorrow (it was Saturday, he’d have time to sleep it off), he selected play all, and lifted the bottle to his lips again.
Side A of the tape is for some moments that make up Castiel's most significant memories. I didn't want this to just be a new spin on moments that were in the show. You already know those stories and can read between the lines as well as I can. So I made up some memories I feel fit neatly into the story line. Think of it maybe as scenes that didn't make the cut. Moments that didn't seem to be especially significant from the outside, but where important to Cas, internally, in his own emotional growth.  Just in case you're wondering why you don't remember this salt and burn.
“I think most people understand that sometimes sacrifices have to be made, but they don’t want to be the ones making them. So they worship the kinds of sacrifices that could never be asked of them because they’re not the son of god, or a billionaire, or some kind of special talent. Those who sacrifice things they themselves don’t have for sacrificing. But when the sacrifice is within their reach, well…”
“You’re not off the hook yet, but we’ll talk about it later. Right now I have a very important question for you, and I need you to answer me honestly. No matter what your answer is, you should know that I’m not leaving here without talking to Michael and Naomi. They can’t use me to hold you here against your will. I won’t stand for it. This deal you made is broken.”
Dean recognized the song immediately on hearing the first few notes. It was one of the most recognizable songs of his youth. He couldn’t remember paying much attention to the lyrics before, but what little he remembered was a natural fit for Cas and how he’d come to fall.
“Anyway, it was one of my last heats. I think I had 1 more after it happened. It had been so long since I'd had a heat I thought they were done, so I wasn’t ready. I wasn't taking the blockers every day anymore - you don't have to once you stop being fertile and your hormones change. I didn't even have any that I could take. That was careless of me. I was getting things ready to go to the clinic to ride it out when someone knocked on the door. I thought it was Jimmy, that he’d noticed some odd smell and decided to knock to let me know he was about to come in, so I didn’t worry. I didn’t worry when I heard the door open either, or the footsteps approaching. Turned out it was a newcomer. An alpha. He’d smelled the heat scent and… well…”
It took another couple of beers, but eventually Cas seemed to find something he wanted to sing, and he stepped up.
“He said this bus wasn’t safe to drive. I asked if he was a passenger and he said no, he was a mechanic. So I told him what we’re supposed to say, you know, if people ask about safety stuff. The buses are checked out between long trips, and so on. There’s like a little script that we kinda memorize. I can get it for you if you like. But anyway, I was just getting started when he just shook his head and went off again, down the road.”
So he’d given it the old college try, no pun intended, and he’d dropped out as soon as he reasonably could. He’d gone full time at the garage and picked up a gig and saved all he could to make sure Sammy would have all the time he needed to study and prepare to get into Stanford and a bit of money to take with him when he went.
But his voice was deeper than Dean had ever heard it, chocked up even, with what Dean hoped was the same sort of craving running through his own blood. He whimpered again, needy and impatient, and Castiel’s eyes flared. Slowly, he buried his nose in Dean’s neck, scenting deeply. He felt Dean’s shudder down to his toes and angled his head to press his lips where his nose had been. Slowly walked them up Dean’s neck, along his jawline and his lips lingered there until Dean shuddered again, moved his head and dove into a kiss.
He had no idea if Cas had cried. He hadn’t been able to make himself look at him. He’d kept his eyes on his own shoes, on the road, on his car. Anywhere but Cas.
What was he good at? It didn’t seem like they’d need a mechanic here, but he’d done plenty of running. He probably had some useful skills he could pass along. He made himself think critically. He had plenty of skills. But perhaps it would be easier to figure out how he could be useful if he had a better idea of what they might need. He should go check out the classes, discreetly. Just sorta walk down the hall and see what they were doing.
family. Neither one of them had any idea back then what they’d have to face or where it would bring them.
How could Dean not have fallen in love with him, head over heels? And Cas, well. He was as alone as they had been. He had a large family that was always off somewhere doing exciting things and he was here alone, and so starved for love that he had fallen (flown) into Dean’s arms without hesitation. They had been each other’s first love. Each other's first kiss. Each other’s first
“Well, I was checking because I found myself worrying about how you were doing without Sam. And, honestly, for my own sake too. You and Sam were the only ones who’d ever encouraged me to question and make my own choices. When the questions got too big to hold back, I popped over to check on you,” he shrugged. “I was invisible because I didn’t really have a good reason to be there and I was… well, embarrassed, about the way things had gone down.”
“It took some time, but I learned to be okay with the things I can’t control. I learned to deal with trying to help and failing. I learned to deal with not being able to even try. I learned to deal with having my help rejected. What I can’t deal with is being asked for help, and then left powerless. Being given some control over the situation, but not enough. I know that for you it’s just an invite to be part of a team. That nobody on the team calls the shots on their own, especially not on the basis of just their gut feelings. I know that it even helps you to diffuse responsibility like that. If it’s a team decision, it’s not your fault, right? But for me it’s like my dad just tied me to a chair and locked me in my room, then walked out the door yelling he was going to go hunt a werewolf and I should make sure Sammy doesn’t burn the house down.”
Here he turned to face the other way, interrupting himself with a shrill voice to indicate another person.
They slept on it. Then they mostly nodded at each other in passing all day. Dean found himself wandering in the direction of Castiel’s classroom a number of times, and getting a bit miffed by all the adoring looks he saw getting tossed at the man who was
“Mr. Castiel Novak. Actually, we’ll need to see Michael as well. Perhaps his brother could join us in Castiel’s office after a few minutes.”
He wondered at the time if Cas knew what he was singing. It was a catchy tune. That title didn’t give anything away either. Cas seemed hesitant, not quite sure of the tune, but he caught on once he hit the first chorus.
He shifted nervously in his chair, reminding himself that the word pie should not be any part of this.
“Say Saturday morning then? We can work on picking a band name and maybe picking some songs to start off.”
Cas made a hang on gesture, walked out and returned with the player Dean and Sam had gotten him, along with one of the CDs. He placed everything carefully, slid the CD into the player and selected the right track.
Their eyes locked. All the information that mattered right now was in the other set of eyes. They said it hurt, but it’ll heal.
So, it's been a few weeks, starting with crazy overtime and ending in the ER, so apologies for the late update and the less than inspiring formatting.  I'm told I have to take a few days off, so there should be another update in a day or three.
“Before anything else happens, there are two things you need to know,” Dean announced. “The first thing is that there is a bug in your office. Charlie and Ellen are listening in and they’re going to record everything that is about to go down in here. We’re going to try to make it good.”
Intrigued, if none the wiser, he went to the door, intending to get Sam, but as it turned out, Sam was on his way in with his own beer. He headed for a shelf, hunting around for a book he needed.
The first few visits were a bust, but they hit pay dirt about two hours in. Cas could tell it was going to be different the moment they walked up to the door and he saw that Dean hesitated before approaching the entrance. He seemed inordinately interested in the mat outside the door. It was certainly hideous enough to draw attention, he supposed, but once they were inside, he could see Dean had become considerably more uncomfortable than he had seen him yet – and he’d seen him cooling his heels in an interrogation room, so that was saying something.
“Who’s angry, who’s scared, mood changes, tension, body language. Or maybe hazards, things that are out of place, things that feel wrong. Threats.”
“No!” Sammy’s tone seemed to jeer at the idea, as if it was some silly thing only dopey kids did anyway. Dean’s eyebrow went up in the rearview mirror, and Sam blushed.
“It’s funny. It’s supposed to be a song about a delusional man, tilting at imaginary enemies. But how imaginary are they really? So many of the monsters we fight are ”imaginary”. I sometimes wonder what that old knight was fighting. Mostly I just think that most humans are… confusing… They worship sacrifice in one man and mock it in another.”
“I know. They lied. They took his phone and reset it, they’re screening his calls, and monitoring all his communications. The only way he was able to talk to me at all was that they didn’t know about the phone you gave him.”
He made himself put down the marker and opened up his social media. What were people saying about this online? Apparently, he decided after a couple of hours of searching various hashtags on 3 different platforms, a lot of ugly things. Somehow it has escaped the notice of a lot of people that there had always been messages in these stories. Messages they had ignored for decades. And when those messages had recently become more explicit, some people had lost their minds.
“You’re too good to be anyone’s punching bag. And you deserve a partner… someone who will fight with you, not against you. Please don’t ever let me do that to you again.”
Some cheerleaders had turned up dead, of apparent suicide. All in the same school. Small town, middle of nowhere. They’d been between major hunts and passing through, or close enough, and decided to stop and handle it. Cas had just started riding with them more on smaller hunts and between hunts, pretty much, on a regular basis. It took some doing but they finally figured out that what the girls all had in common was a sleepover.
“Probably doesn’t help that it’s a song written by your ex about the day you broke up and how alone he’s been without you,” Cas added.
“Kelly was right there, with her perfume and her voice and her arm. And Frank is all soft and delicate and -”
They ended up splitting the tiramisu Cas ordered. Meaning Deal stole “a taste” or 10 while continually comparing it to pies of all kinds. Cas let him, because yes, he was a detective, but he was also on a date and dammed if he was going to call his date out on such a cute lie
Dean was starting to sound frantic now, the anxiety Cas had sensed in him before ramped all the way up.
Cas walked right past the omega, as if he hadn’t even noticed there was a body there and addressed the watchman.
Dean looked at his hand, found the syrup, and cleaned his finger. In the movies this was always the sexy bit. He should have locked eyes with Cas, then fluttered his eyelashes or something and licked his finger like it was something else entirely. He couldn’t, though. It had always seemed so- fake.
Slowly, noises started coming from the next room. It must be about dinner time. Sammy and Eileen were clearly already preparing something. Cas and Dean didn’t move from the couch, but they let go a little, relaxed enough to look at each other and their surroundings. There was sadness in this song, but also hope. They exchanged small smiles, watched Sam and Eileen move in and out of their field of vision. It felt oddly nostalgic.
“Some of you have asked about this before, but I never really gave you an answer. I think it’s time. In many of my videos, I am playing something on the guitar. You’ve asked me what it is, and tried to identify it, but I never said.”
“And would you say, by any chance, that advanced aerobics might look, to suspicious eyes, a bit like, let’s say - boxing?”
Benny, of course, couldn’t believe the gall of the small thing showing up and interrupting his pitch, and soon everybody was talking at once, Benny and Donna making demands while Megan just tried to calm everyone down. To her credit, nobody came out of any office, so it was probably true that they were all in some meeting. The other assistant (Michael’s?) came to Megan’s rescue, leaving the rest of the lobby unattended.
Somewhere he picked up another drink. A beer this time. And then some bourbon. When he spotted Mike again, he was dancing with someone else, and Cas looked around for someone else to talk to. Why had he thought he wanted to be left alone? He had been alone far too long.
“Where is your mother?” Castiel asked, more harshly than he normally would, but he really didn’t want this kid standing around right now.
How early could you reasonably call people on a Saturday morning? Normally, Charlie wouldn’t call them on a Saturday morning at all. She’d wait until after lunch, like a civilized person. But this was an emergency. It was about 5 now, still too early. It was an emergency, but the kind that could wait until 8, probably. She’d have to ask everyone when they talked. She got another cup of coffee and reviewed the notes on her notepad. She couldn’t find all the information she needed in public records. Fortunately, Cas had been drunk enough she wouldn’t have to hack into anything the hard way. She hated using his log-in without his (sober) permission, but he’d understand, right? Even if he was pissed, initially, once he was back home, she’d work on it and he’d forgive her.
indeed. It wasn’t there yet, that early, he didn’t think. But soon after that. For a very long time before he could see it.
“You can go now,” Jody snarked over her shoulder. “We’ll show ourselves out when Cas is ready to go.”
Knowing he wasn’t likely to go back to sleep like this, he went to the bathroom and started going through his morning routine. This was stupid. It was early, he was still tired. He had thought after last night they were past this separate room nonsense.
Tired of the whole process, he suddenly stopped, slouched in the chair and just finished with a shrug and a move towards the door.
He’d only intended to grab a beer from the kitchen, at first. But once Cas had left the room he decided that actually, he needed some air. He went up the steps and out the bunker door. Where to? He looked around for a moment, and then headed off towards town. Lebanon was small, but it had a bar. That would do.
Once the pastries were gone and Cas had rifled through his desk for whatever he wanted to take with him, they headed out of the building, one big happy family. In the parking lot, they split up, Benny, Bobby, and Donna getting into the cruiser with Jody and heading out first. Ellen took a few minutes to hug Cas and tell him not to pull something like that again, and then dragged Sam into Charlie’s bug with her. Dean and Cas would follow after a quick stop at his apartment to pick up a few things.
She began to tell him all the reasons Dean should not be moved. He was hurt. He needed to rest. His vitals needed to be checked on every 30 minutes. Castiel sighed, raised his eyes to the ceiling.
“Everything is definitely NOT fine,” and now Dean’s voice was strained, like it was all he could do to keep it contained and level.
Cas looked at his shoes for a moment, Dean’s message hitting home, loud and clear. Had he messed up? He was so sure that this was the right thing to do that even now he couldn’t see how he could have done anything else, even if he understood Dean’s point. How could he not take the bullet for Dean? How could he just stand by and watch Dean get hurt?
And now here he was, talking about not going to college yet, so he could help Dean with Sammy and save up while Dean was still in high school. And then what? When Dean went to work to pay Sam’s tuition, he’d put off college again, or maybe go to the local community college part time? Would he put his future on hold along with Dean for 4 years until Sam was off to college? And for what? Some guy who would never be worth it? He was supposed to go out into the world now, meet new people who would love him the way he deserved to be loved. People who weren’t going to be a dead end in his life. People who had something to offer besides obligations and sacrifice. So he’d taken a deep breath and he’d done the only thing he could do. He had broken his heart. Truth be told, he’d broken both their hearts that day.
His eyes went back to the TV, and now that the crisis was over and everyone was going back to what they were doing before the alarms went off, Dr. Sexy was watching Frank walk away. And he looked confused. And his confusion was confusing the crap out of Dean.
He mentally crossed his fingers he wasn’t about to terrify this child even more as he walked right up to her, jogging the last few steps like someone who had been looking for her for some time now.
As soon as everyone was there, the silence became thicker than the syrup, which was all the encouragement Charlie needed to abandon her pancakes in favor of telling them what she’d learned.
He glanced at the clock again and jumped out of bed. Why couldn’t his brother just take one of the cars and drive? Sure, it was a long drive, take him a couple of days to get there, but if he’d set out a couple of days ago, when Dean was hinting he wanted some alone time with Cas, he’d be there now. But Sammy had the brilliant idea that instead of spending those two days behind the wheel, he wanted to spend more time with Cas because “he’s my friend too, Dean.” and then just fly to Eileen.
Dr. Sexy was casually returning some charts to the desk when the alarm went off two doors down. He found Frank frantically working over the patient, who had flatlined. There was a blur of activity, both of them working to get a pulse. When the monitor found a heartbeat, they glanced at each other for a moment, relief and adrenaline in their smiles. But as soon as their eyes met, they held. They sort of, swayed towards each other, and then a beep of the monitor brought them back to their patient, just before 3 other people rushed into the room.
“Sorry about that. If we’re going to do this, though, you should know this kind of thing just happens.”
There was a grove hiding most of the village and an area that had probably been meant for a garden but had turned into a beautiful meadow nobody wanted to disturb. There was a bird bath in the meadow, and on that first day he had stopped to look at the birds in it and imagine what they were saying to each other.
Sam and Eileen brought the plates and set them down on the table, exchanging knowing smiles at the sight of Dean and Cas, just now starting to move, reluctant to put space between them. They went back to the kitchen, leaving the other two alone for another minute by silent mutual agreement.
Dean stumbled back, unable to conjure a thought of any kind. This was – terrifying. A few minutes ago, his brain was demanding a do over, and now that he’d gotten the proper taste he wanted, he didn’t know what to do with it. It was life changing.
Dean watched Cas as he ate, wondering if this was when he pulled out his phone and called that Uber driver. He made himself stay cool. Wait. Cas ate, then stumbled over to the sofa, collapsed and closed his eyes against the light with a groan.
“Hi, everyone. I’m not anywhere interesting today, just my new apartment, so if you’re not interested in a bit of a personal update, feel free to go on to the next video right about now.”
He leaned in closer then, his hands shifting to Castiel’s waist. He hovered for a moment, the words brushing against Castiel’s skin, sweeter than the taste still lingering on their tongues.
“Kidnapping??” He objected. “Castiel came home to his job and his apartment on his own two feet. Nobody snatched him off the street and dragged him here.”
“This part is about how destructive love can be. David saw Bathsheba bathing from his roof and fell for her. A lot of horrible things happened because of that. They had an affair and she got pregnant. He got her husband killed to cover up their affair, and eventually married her. The child died. That was just the beginning. Her first husband was… a righteous man. David’s love for Bathsheba caused terrible things to happen to innocent people.”
Briefly, he told them about the incident with the child, and just as we was wrapping up, Charlie came back with a closeup of the man. His features were clear enough, he supposed. It didn’t capture the freckles, or the shocking green of his eyes, but –
Dean had been staring into the fridge as he said all this, as if he had forgotten what a beer looks like. Slowly, he rested his head against the freezer door.
He heard a huff, and looked up just in time to see Lisa heading to the door, more angry than she had been earlier in the day.
Their grips turned to iron together. “Don’t let go,” their hands said to each other, and then “I won’t if you don’t.”
That night even the cold shower didn’t help. What on earth had possessed him to insist for so long that he wanted a room of his own? He was a stupid, stupid omega.
Dean thought this was a freaking great time for an earthquake. It was an earthquake, right? Somehow, he couldn’t quite open his eyes. But he could feel the shaking. And he could definitely hear a low rumble in the background. He felt his body get tossed around a little, and what seemed like a hand adjusting something on his lap. Was he sitting up? He wasn’t supposed to be sitting up.
“Are you asking me to use my personal relationship with Dean to persuade him to do something he doesn’t want to and which could potentially be harmful to him?”
When he was finally satisfied that he had it right, or as right as he was going to get it, anyway, he carefully wrote out the track list on the cover, adding a note here or there as appropriate.
“I happen to find myself very interested in you and your welfare," he pointed out, in his best so-sue-me tone. "And in fact, in getting into your pants later. Which would definitely not be a possibility if I hadn’t taken care of Sam.”
Eventually, the sounds coming from Cas turn desperate, and Dean turns his attention to the cock in his hand. He’s never done this before, but he figures what he likes to have done to him is probably a good way to start. He teases at the slit with the tip of his tongue, then spirals out until he’s circling the head and Cas is a puddle of want. Dean’s entire focus narrows to the reactions of Castiel’s body, his own body moving on autopilot.
“She was cremated.” Sam deflated a little. “But get this. Her obituary mentions her best friend and how supportive he was through the worst of her illness. Dean, he lives right next door.”
He liked the garage he was working at now. Small place, nothing fancy, just basic repairs until he came in. He had more or less changed the game because he got bored one afternoon when there was no work, went looking through the junk yard, and found a decent vehicle to restore. She wasn’t a classic, like his Baby had been, but it kept him busy. When he’d finished with her, the garage had put her up for sale, and now it had a sort of secondhand car lot attached, which a few cars Dean had fixed up for sale.
Ellen had skipped the biscuits and gravy. She could make a lot of pancakes in a very short time, and she was going to be needed at the table, away from the kitchen. She didn’t know what this was about yet, but Charlie had said it was about Cas and Dean, and that meant it would get Ellen’s full attention. Something about the way Cas left had reeked to high heaven, and her boy was a pitiful sight these days.
“You’re not what Dean? A homophobe? Bi? Are you sure? Maybe you don’t want Dr. Sexy to be bi even though he’s clearly attracted to a man, because
Dean made himself remember the easy, delighted smile and just as it had before, it stopped the runaway thoughts in his mind.
He jumped when he felt Castiel’s hand on his shoulder and walked away without looking. Desperate to hang on to control, he made for the stairs. If he could make it to his room, he’d be fine. He could get his shit together while Cas finished cooking and then they’d have dinner and everything would be fine.
“Sir,” he started to say. But Cas didn’t even fully turn around, his posture and his tone dismissing the man entirely and daring him to continue to waste his time.
“Thank you. There was so much I was able to face because I know who I am now. Because I know where I fit in. I knew in the empty. At that Gas N Sip. In Heaven and Hell and Purgatory. In all the worlds we’ve been to. I wouldn’t be who I am without you.”
there are so many others. Feel free to share your own song ideas in the comments, I'll admit I'm wildly curious about what songs you would have chosen.
“No wind, no rain, no standard storm or normal weathering is going to shake this tree. Maybe it’s not as tall as all the other trees further out from the edge, and it’s not as full as they are. But it has survived things that the others can’t even imagine. It has strength they can’t match in any way.”
“You ever notice how people don’t really know what a kidnapping is?” she said, in an aside, to Bobby. “Maybe we should do an infomercial or something.”
Had Cas told them about what had happened between them? He found that he was suddenly mortified, but before he had time to examine that, she had continued.
“Fair enough,” Garth chimed in “but toss in some drums and other instruments – if you’ve got a good start, all you really need is the right arrangement.”
Unable to keep the snark out of her voice, the nurse informed him that he’d been sedated to stop him from moving. Castiel closed the passenger door carefully, walked around to the driver’s side and got in the car.
Cas stood as tall and still as he could, unintentionally looming over the desk, fire and brimstone in his eyes.
He went back to the red marker and traced out two blocks around the site of the shooting. Filled it in with the squiggly lines. Okay, that was the easy part. Now what?
Nobody heard the elevator ding when it stopped outside the executive offices again. Nobody heard much of anything for a full minute until Jody pushed her way into the group.
“Yes, I do believe we cover those. Among others. And things like removing scents from various surfaces, hiding scuff marks…”
Cas was standing under a tree, overlooking Lawrence. Dean recognized it immediately. It was a good place to think, up there on that small hill, just far enough out of town for peace and quiet.
“Have you figured out love yet? Cause I could use some pointers. I keep making lame jokes that anyone else would have dumped me for before our first kiss.”
They were mostly dry by the time they broke the kiss, and Cas let the towel drop from Dean’s shoulders, sliding it gently down his back until it reached his waistline. Then Castiel’s gentle smile turned hungry, his hands fisted in the towel and he pulled, bringing Dean’s body snuggly into his. Dean went, his lips poking at the hot coals in Castiel’s kiss.
Still, they had talked about it again with clearer heads and, a few phone calls later, they had everyone but the bass. They hadn’t picked a new band name yet, having decided to wait until the band was complete. They made phone calls, they put up flyers, they asked everyone they knew. No dice. They almost gave up. But then Kevin (keyboard) had suggested they put an add on the internet and hold auditions.
He found a restroom in the corner and realized he would rather like to use it but wasn’t sure how to get a nurse here to help him up. He cleared his throat, tested his voice a bit, but before he could call out, a head popped through the door.
Dean didn’t recognize the song when it started. Cas was looking kinda spaced out for the moment, so he grabbed the tape again to read. All it said was “Crash and Burn,” and “Sam” with no further notes.
“I’m hurt. I don’t know where they’re keeping me. Somewhere near water. I repeat, this is Officer Miller. I need help.”
“It has always been me against the world, Cas. I – the truth is, when you came in that day, I saw an opportunity to get out. I had been about to run off in the Impala when they arrived and was already planning how I would escape them if one of them succeeded in taking me home. I knew running away from you would be easier. I did everything I could to get you to help me. And after that -”
And just like that, Castiel’s hands found their way to Dean’s collar. Held on. Closed that last couple of inches between them. Slid their lips together in the gentlest kiss he could manage with his hands fisting on Dean’s coat. He almost lost it when Dean’s fingers slipped into his hair, increasing the pressure. For a moment, it felt so perfect he forgot to breathe.
He pulled Cas into his lap then, held him close. It hadn’t hit him until just now how close he’d come to fucking it all up beyond fixing. He felt his body start to shake at the thought and suddenly he had to say the words out loud.
Dean knew he was getting the bare bones here and was torn between making himself fill in the gaps and leaving it there. It was clear enough, right? He glanced over to Cas, who was watching them carefully. Sam made a move to leave, and Dean held him there another moment, not really knowing what to say, but feeling like he should say something.
Cas took shotgun, and immediately started touching things. Dean never let him touch things. He found the radio controls and started fiddling with them.
Cas started to step back, awkwardly, but Dean’s hand reached out to keep him there. To pull him just that much closer.
“Sir, our buses are checked out between every trip -” the man started to recite the usual spiel. Dean was pretty sure they rehearsed it at like weekly meetings. How to respond politely to this kind of thing. How to politely tell someone to fuck off, basically. He should have known he was wasting his time. He had eight minutes left. That was long enough.
Dean’s eyes were all over the feed. The intensity of his gaze was strong enough everyone in the mobile command center could feel it. But only Cas could see the way his body was increasingly tightening, bracing, locking up, preparing.
When Dean woke up, Cas was still clinging to his side like a limpet. For someone who never used to sleep, he had become a champ at it now that he was human. He seemed to have a slight snore that sounded more like a purr, and Dean allowed himself to stay in that not quite awake but not fully asleep state for a few minutes, enjoying the warmth of Castiel’s body. After a few minutes, though, he had to get up.
But his eyes were already scanning for the source of the noise. He couldn’t see anyone walking around in the area in front of him. He shuffled, accidentally tipping his popcorn. Not having been raised in a barn, he leaned down to clean up the mess, and if that allowed him a discreet way to look behind his seat for whatever was happening, well, that was entirely coincidental. Thank goodness for modern theaters with a dozen aisles and enough space between pairs of seats for teenagers to make out in privacy. Nothing. Nobody seemed to be standing. He could relax.
They ran towards the open area Miller had glanced at, leaving Cas to deal with the man in the Vader suit. No, not here. But just beyond was the main stage, so Dean headed for that.
They had a workable chorus after a while, the notes they’d gotten from Garth covered in layers of additional notes, crossed out lines, a different color for every draft until the notes were too messy to continue to be useful until they were cleaned up. Garth brought a box of donuts from where he’d stashed them in the kitchen, and everyone sat to touch base on where they were and where they were going.
But before he could find the words to finish that sentence, Cas beamed another smile at him and he forgot how to speak.
Carefully, he placed Dean in the passenger seat, buckled him in, and settled the IV bag on his lap, making sure the line was clear.
“The thing about being hypervigilant is, most of the time, I know everything you’re not saying. I can feel it blasting from you like it’s a song on the radio. I can feel the catch in your breath when you suddenly find that you’re standing too close and you don't know how or why. I can feel your eyes getting pulled to me, and how hard you’re trying not to show it. I can feel the attraction, and the awkwardness, and the caution, and the uncertainty coming off you in waves.”
“Well, all those eyes following me around felt uncomfortable. I mean, I know they’re just curious and not trying to be rude, but they made me…. itchy, just about. And I started trying to work out why. I…”
That’s when he saw it. The smirk already forming at the corner of Dean’s mouth. Some quip already taking shape. Dean was waiting for him to attempt to answer his question, so he could ridicule him for it. Call him naïve or mock him for taking the question seriously. Or maybe he meant to cut him off with some version of “see, I told you so” immediately on hearing that angels didn’t have sex organs in their true form.
from work? It was in the wrong direction, and he had thought that showing up there might make people think Dean was in trouble with the police, especially since he’d been going around showing people his picture and asking questions.
“People will notice and talk about that. That is a very good thing. We’ll have brand recognition.” Cas added.
They all snorted at that, Dean and Benny striking a pose and cracking each other up, and they really did look exactly like a group of old friends goofing around in their garage, having fun. The essential garage band.
“Michael is closer,” Cas added. “She might send Michael, if it doesn’t interfere with some important business, but she won’t be far behind.”
They squared off, and as soon as they started circling around each other, Dean found himself internally repeating “no touchy” as if it was his new mantra. He made no move against Cas, entirely focused on not letting Cas get his hands on him. Around and around they went, Cas lunging here and there and Dean gracefully dodging, ducking or otherwise generally avoiding Cas entirely.
He pulled up to the gate and rolled the window down. The old man who came out to talk to him looked only vaguely familiar, but he recognized Castiel, because he approached the window with the expression of a man who was about to tell him, as kindly as he possibly could, to fuck off.
“Charlie recognized him immediately. They were about to issue an Amber Alert. Extreme danger. The boy needs medication he didn’t have with him. And the mother had a restraining order against his father. He’s unstable and has been stalking her.”
“It is,” Cas agreed. “I see myself in his music often. It helps. It makes it easier to understand myself. And maybe, to explain myself to others.”
“All of the people we’ll be talking to have already been questioned, briefly, by the officers on the scene. Nobody saw anything. We’re here to determine if they have seen or heard something that might help but they didn’t realize was significant, or if any of them are lying. I’ll take the lead, but you let me know if anything seems odd, or if they say something that sounds significant to you.”
He’d hoped to see Castiel at lunch, but he didn’t show. Still, Dean ate, Dean rested, and Dean walked. He got a burger for dinner, but he was going to have to earn the bacon, cheese and fries another day. He was determined not to fall asleep this time, though. He wanted answers.
He smirked to himself and strolled on past the fake ID lessons and found what he didn’t know he’d been looking for. Cas was sort of hunched over, a determined look in his wide, unsettling eyes. His mouth was slightly open, his nostrils flaring, and he was moving, slowly, threateningly, circling an omega standing alone in the middle of the room. His full attention was on the omega, and Dean allowed himself to lean into the door frame to watch.
He really wished he had Sam’s bitchface proficiency at moments like this. Best he could do right now was glare.
He picked up the blue marker this time. Maybe he should mark potential targets. Areas where people were likely to congregate. Maybe blue for areas where people congregate in general, like the university or the malls. And green for areas where people congregate at specific times, like churches. He pulled out his phone to help him identify specific buildings, and in an hour he had marked a dozen blue targets, and 4 green ones.
“Because in December they’re made of love, Dean. Of snow days spent sledding with your best friend, and making snowmen in the yard, and snow forts. Of quiet memories and looking forward to a white Christmas. Of standing at a window with the ones you love, enjoying the beauty as it falls down around you, and freezing noses, and hot cocoa to warm them up. In February it’s just that annoying thing that’s going to make you late for work. It’s dangerous driving conditions, and damage to your paintjob, and mud under your boots.”
“My job here is very important. And in order to do it, I need to maintain a certain image. I’ll fill you in on all the details later, but what you need to know now is, nobody here knows that we know each other. For the time being, it would be best if they didn’t find out.”
Cas dropped a small kiss on his forehead and angled Dean’s head so he could look him square in the eye.
Her eyes jumped to him in what read suspiciously like concern, and she jumped up to produce the water.
She watched Benny and Donna sit down again, Donna going back to her Candy Crush. Then she pulled out her badge and turned to Megan.
Castiel’s smile got brighter, and he set down the fork he’d been about to lift to his mouth because he did that now. He didn’t have to, of course. It wasn’t even a matter of habit picked up during his time as a human. It was just a way to be closer to them, a family thing they did together. One small way he strengthened their bonds. Even if it all tasted like boring molecules.
It was more than a few minutes, but eventually, Cas disentangled himself and resumed the tape. When Dean heard the twang of a country song, he sat up straighter. He looked delighted. Stunned, maybe a little shocked, but definitely delighted.
And even through the voice modulator it was clear Cas was stunned when people moved to cut off Vader’s escape, closing a circle around Dean, Cas and Vader as they approached. A delighted, interested circle. Fans ready to enjoy a improv show.
Angels are certainly not encouraged to make decisions. Cas never had any illusions about free will. An endless life without free will, he shuddered. And then, how fleeting is a human lifetime when you live forever?
“My what?” she shrieked. “My son was not kidnapped, he got on an airplane and flew here on his own.”
“Not necessarily,” Dean had explained. “It’s rare, especially in teenagers, but you can fall in love with your best friend. It’s the best, when it works, but high risk.“
“But he knows it’s too late to avoid it. He’s lost. The flag on the arch, that’s the conquering army marking its territory. Love is not the ending people think it is. In the movies, in the books, the characters fall in love, maybe there’s a kiss, maybe there’s a wedding, and that’s the happily ever after. But love is not like that. It’s hard work, it’s heartbreak and compromise, it’s a fight you fight together, back-to-back against the world. It’s a beginning, not an end. If you start knowing how it ends, there’s no comfort or support in it. It’s barely more than an empty promise. And yet -”
Abandoning all thoughts of paperwork, Cas headed for his office, dropped the equipment he was still carrying and started looking for Dean. If the car was here, Dean was probably here too. Cas probably wouldn’t have found him if he hadn’t decided to take a shortcut by going to look at the security cams. Dean was on the roof.
The man had agreed to go down to the station to answer some questions. Several third degrees later, he left. The gun was untraceable. There were no prints on it that could be matched to the man. The closest thing they had to a witness was Dean, who did not actually see him draw it. They had absolutely nothing they could use to hold him or get a warrant to search his home.
His smile faltered, though, as he noticed the eyes more fully now that he didn’t have this pitch on his mind. They were mostly benign glances, to be fair. They were all probably picking up the change in his scent. Or maybe, after all that scenting earlier, it would be more accurate to say they were picking up Castiel’s scent on him.  They were curious, was all. Still, he couldn’t help it. It was making him restless.
When they joined Sam, they saw he had pulled up YouTube. They ended up watching Queen music videos instead of a movie, all three of them in awe of Freddie and what he could do. Sammy had more or less missed all of that, and Dean had heard the music, but never really seen the videos. They followed one music video to another and were surprised to find that they’d been at it for almost two hours when Cas finally got up, stretched, and excused himself, again thanking them profusely for his gifts.
He’d decided to go for a drive to clear his head. 50 miles later, the road had relaxed him enough to figure out a few things. He turned onto the interstate and headed for the nearest town, drove around until he found a music store and bought every Queen CD they had. Then he went to find a small stereo and an mp3 player.
He’s still riding high on that when they arrive, and he reminds himself he’s an adult now. He leads the way to the door and follows Dean to their table. They seat themselves because it’s that kind of place. Welcoming, like a giant kitchen with lots of kitchen tables and a grandma ready to stuff you full of her home-made cooking whenever you decide to drop by. Dean is immediately at ease, in a way Cas had never seen him before.
The brush of Castiel’s thumb against the back of his hand let him know it was ok now. He was ok now.
“He gives the music anyway, because it’s his special talent, it’s what he’s good at, it’s the best part of himself and it’s the very best thing he has to offer.”
“Yeah,” he seemed solemn, all of a sudden. “Someone was definitely going to get hurt if we didn’t leave. A lot of someones.”
Dean had dropped out of college two years ago. Thinking back, he wasn’t really sure why he’d even gone to college in the first place. He had made plans with - he’d made plans he’d known, deep down, he would never stick to. But he had decided to try. For old times’ sake.
“He wouldn’t follow me. He said I’m a stranger and the hallways were dark and it wasn’t smart. You’ve got a good kid, there.”
He was looking at security video now. Scanning the people walking into the room, stopping now and then to note the people that might be concealing a rifle. There weren’t many. This time of year most people were wearing light and cool clothing that might possibly conceal a handgun, but never a rifle. By the time the doors closed for the movie to start, he had three suspicious characters. Three suspects. That was the good news.
“I hear that. Bar’s closing, though. We’re about to head up to Hastings to keep the party going. You want a ride?”
She waved him down the hall without interrupting the dissertation she was on about her neighbor’s dog. Dean found his way to the bathroom easily enough. At the end of the hall was a laundry room. There were three doors, two across from each other, one of which was open to reveal the bathroom, and another further down.
Dean made a note to pick up a cat toy the next time he was out shopping. A quick look at the comments almost changed his mind. If the comments were anything to go by, Cas was going to need a second studio just to store all the toys people wanted to send him. At least a storage space. And there were no cute cat pics yet. Still, they were friends again. Or at least working on it. Maybe one of those automatic feeders?
Not a heartbeat later, he was leaning against the door again, this time intending to keep everyone out until he could figure out just how (and why) exactly Dean was sitting in his chair. Did they know he was here? Cas didn’t know how he could have made it this far undetected, but if they knew he was here they would have kept him away, surely? Unless they were calling the police to have Dean arrested right there, in his office? He had to get Dean out of here. He had to hold Dean and never let him go.
“The closest I had to a relationship was Lisa, and if I’m honest the only reason I did that was because Sammy made me promise and I thought he was gone. Like, gone gone. Forever, gone. I think I kinda loved her, but it was never going to work, and maybe that’s why I tried. She was a picket fence kinda person and she had the kid, and I’m-”
When he came back to awareness, he found himself sticky, his stomach covered in Dean’s cum, and he chuckled warmly. As it turned out, it seemed they had both been thoroughly claimed and marked. He touched his neck, where Dean’s teeth had cut him, a strange sense of wonder filling him up. Dean’s eyes were still closed, and he gently leaned closer, nudging Dean’s head into a better angle so Cas could tenderly lick the injury clean. When they could move again, they left the mess and went to bed.
“And yet you can’t help wanting every moment. Clinging to it, rejoicing in it. Being grateful for whatever you can get. Even though it’s broken, or maybe you’re breaking it, holding on too hard. Even though it’s not enough,” Dean finished the thought.
It's been a couple of months all week, so here's a short chapter (but a sweet one). Hopefully, there will be another (longer) one in a couple of days.
“Yeah?” Dan shifts, tilting his body to accommodate Castiel’s more comfortably in the limited space. “Comfy, isn’t it?”
“It was never because you weren’t exactly who you should be, Cas. You don’t have to be anyone but yourself to get everything I have to give. It was always my own shit. Thinking I had nothing to give anyone. That all I’d ever be is a killing machine who doesn’t deserve good things. Doesn’t have time for good things. That good things are something I get to look at for a bit, maybe, enjoy for a few hours, but I definitely don’t get to keep. That I’d probably die in the next hunt and nobody deserved to be left behind wondering what happened to me.”
He realized something unexpected was happening when Castiel’s movements started getting jerky and rash. Was he getting frustrated? Then he ducked under Castiel’s arm and got a hint of arousal. Dean couldn’t help himself. He’d always been a bit of a tease, if never in quite this way. Suddenly, the nature of the tension between them changed. Cas started trying harder, driven by a need to touch Dean. Dean continued to dodge and get out of the way as if his life depended on it, but now enjoying the changes in Castiel’s scent as he evaded every move. And then the inevitable moment of distraction, and Cas had him against the wall.
“You think it’s misdirection?” Okay, so it was nice to know Cas wasn’t the only one not taking it at face value.
“You wanted to clear the air yesterday, and I think that I need to do the same. And then maybe we need to sleep on it, before I move in. I don’t want to end up making the same mistakes twice.”
When he opened his eyes, the first thing he noticed was the world’s worst hangover had indeed arrived. He wanted to stay still there forever, but he had to move, because the next thing he noticed was that his pillow was wet and his phone was lying next to him. Dead, apparently. Moving very slowly, he plugged it into the charger and made his way into the bathroom. One glass of water and a couple of aspirin later, he shuffled into the kitchen to get some coffee started. It was when the smell of the brewing coffee hit him that a realization started to dawn. At some point, somewhere between listening to Dean’s messages and finishing off that bottle, he’d made a phone call. He’d drunk dialed someone.
“The boy has short light brown hair, and light eyes, probably gray or amber, but hard to tell. He’s wearing jeans and a Ninja Turtles t-shirt with a blue hoodie. He looks about 7, maybe.”
Slowly, he stood up, looming over Dean much as he had on the day they had first met, and left Dean to pick up his jaw with some privacy.
“I’d better save some of these for the next time I need some advice,” he chuckled. “Thanks, everyone. Thanks for being there for me. See you again soon.”
Cas pulled out his notebook and started taking notes. Date, time, location. What next? General description of the suspects?
Dean’s dry chuckle drew him back from his runaway thoughts. He slid off the hood of the Impala, walked around to the door, then turned to face Cas. Somehow, Cas was right there, as if there was anywhere else for Dean to go and Cas to follow. Too close. All up in Dean’s personal space.
And that was an honest to goodness wink. Castiel’s smile grew wider, as he turned to drive. He reminded himself to keep his eyes on the road. For different reasons this time. He needs to get them there safely. It’s a date. It’s a
“Why’s that, Dean? My choices are mine. At one point in time my decisions affected your life and because of that I cared about your opinion, but that changed, and not by my choice, I might add, so again, your hot take is now irrelevant.”
“V-” Dean tries to choke out, but Castiel’s lips finally picked a place to land, and they’re currently brushing ever so softly up his neck, stealing his breath and making goosebumps break out all over the place. Dean has to clear his throat and try again.
There was nothing brotherly about that kiss. He might not understand his feelings for Cas, but he understood his body’s reactions just fine. His body was entirely on board and buzzing with potential. He wanted to go back to Castiel’s metaphorical pie and stuff himself full. He wanted to dive in like he was at a pie eating contest.
Cas looked into Dean’s eyes, wanting him to know this was important. Real. That he meant every word.
Sam and Eileen came back with beer bottles, and they all sat down to eat. Dean found himself looking around the table and feeling… at peace, he supposed. As much disruption as their family had had to deal with over the years, losing loved ones, fighting, dying, Sam and Dean losing each other, both of them losing Cas, somehow they always seemed to make their way back to this. Which, this dead end he'd been stuck in with Cas notwithstanding, wasn't as bad as it could be.
A sketch of the man had been circulated throughout the town. He was declared a person of interest, wanted for questioning as a potential witness to a crime. So far, no trace of him at all. Castiel asked himself again if they wanted this guy enough to run that sketch to the media. The media would want to know details. He’d rather not do that if he could help it. It’s not like the man was a dangerous criminal. Who knows what people might come up with to fill in the blanks.
Dean’s eyes shifted to Castiel’s lips and he unconsciously leaned closer, breaths mingling for a moment.
In the background, he could hear the captain speaking to the officers, and officer Brown’s feed began to pan sideways, like she was slowly turning around.
When Castiel hadn’t arrived by 6, Dean started to wonder if he was going to show up at all. He felt restless, and decided maybe it was time that he took a stroll in the hallway. He stepped out, and looked around. Right in front of him there was a nurse’s station, much like any other he’d ever seen. To his left a long hallway was lined with several more rooms like the one he’d been in, plus an OR and and ICU at the end. All these rooms appeared to be empty at the moment. In fact, there didn’t seem to be anyone around at all. Not even the nurse.
to be. Because bi, in your mind, is like half gay and you’re a homophobe, now. You know what they say about homophobes, right?”
Dean was taking a late lunch today because he’d gotten caught up in the T-bird he was restoring. Truth be told, he’d still be under there now if Bobby hadn’t interrupted him and told him to stop being an idjit and go get some lunch, the car would still be there when he was done.
They headed for the door, discussing what they’d be having for dinner now that they couldn’t hit the food court. Eventually, as they walked out into an unexpectedly late afternoon, Cas decided on Mexican food, from his favorite restaurant.
They hadn’t been strangers in a while, but the moment you sink a blade into a guy only to watch him tilt his head at you like that was a quaint human peculiarity kinda sticks, he’d found. He’d been fearsome, Castiel, Angel of the Lord, with his booming voice and his wings flaring behind him. Or at least their shadow. He’d have to see if he could get a look at the real thing one of these days. If that was even possible. And here he was now, Cas Winchester, eating food he couldn’t really taste to bond with his family.
The good news was, she was a gossip at heart, and even though she tried valiantly to hold back, she forgot herself often and it was easy to keep her talking despite her best efforts to move them along. The bad news was, she wasn’t saying anything useful.
There was a moment of the sort of heavy silence you might find if you were metaphorically free diving into the Mariana Trench.
“I’ll wait. It’s” she smirked “kinda personal, if you catch my drift. I’m not supposed to deliver it to anyone else.”
“My friend is a policeman. He’s taking care of things now. We’re going to wait in here while he does his thing, alright?”
“Well, usually, if we detect by the omega’s demeanor that their alpha is not… satisfied with the usual cooking class... or maybe they burn themselves cooking a lot at home...  we interview the omega to determine if they would be a good fit.”
“Don’t need to read your mind when I have your body right here,” a sleepy Dean mumbled into his neck.
She took some time finding just the right place to sit and placed the basket just right on her lap. Trying to look bored, she glanced around getting the lay of the land, noting where security cameras were, who went into what office and eavesdropping on whatever conversations she could.
Dean gets that. The only one he’s ever given the best part of himself to (well, before Cas) was Sammy. And yeah, now that he was all grown up it sometimes was just like that. The best he had to give was not what Sam needed anymore. Or even what he wanted most times. Some of it was leftover habit from when they were kids and Dean was taking care of him. But he knew that all those times he cut deals with demons or Death or whoever would deal to get Sam back, he was doing something Sammy wouldn’t want. It did bother him a bit, to know his brother didn’t want his gift. But he gave it anyway, gladly, with no regrets.
All the cross streets had been closed to keep the traffic flowing through and give the pedestrians room to spread out a bit. Vendors were set up where normally there would be traffic, and Cas drank it all in, fascinated by the way the crowd lined up to watch the cars go by. They picked a particularly well decorated food truck, and decided they would eat there. Eventually, they reached the end of the event area, and turned down a side street to find a place to park.
That was also the point two days later, when Cas had worked through the files, finding only two potential cases of interest. The case they had been working on that led to the sting. And a case they had all worked independently before Miller and Brown had become partners. The domestic terrorist case he was working when he first met Dean, in fact. To be clear, everyone in the whole station who was not working on something more urgent had been pulled into that case at one time or another. The two men had been singing like birds by the time it was made clear to them that they were going away for a while and were going to lose their guns, they’d been ready to cut any kind of deal. A number of promising leads had come from that, and people had been pulled from less urgent cases all over the station to chase down those leads. Cas himself was not all that familiar with what had transpired after his involvement with it was over. But it seemed significant that Miller had requested a new partner a few days after Brown was pulled in to work this case. Had she found something? Something that could qualify as motive?
He registers the way Castiel’s whole body stutters when Dean swallows him down. The way he goes all pliant and needy when Dean pulls back, the seal of his lips generating suction as he moves. The way he moans Dean’s name as if he can’t help it anymore. Everything is a blur after that until Castiel’s hands close around his head, his fingers sink into Dean’s hair, and Dean finds that he’s grinding against the bed.
So he went while they looked over the schedule, just like dozens of others were doing right there in the entrance.
“It’s still warm,” Cas explained, as he reached into the basket and carefully lifted a bundle of cloth that turned out to be a large kitchen towel bundled into a suspiciously pieish shape. A hand that must have belonged to someone moved the empty basket out of the way and the bundle was set down where the basket had been.
It was probably fine to just think of him as Dean now, wasn’t it? He was practically a colleague now. As much as anyone who doesn’t actually work for the same employer or even in the same field can be, anyway. Dean would call him for help when he had these alarm moments, and in return Castiel would call on him in moments like this, when he needed a bit of special insight. He should ask, this afternoon, when he came over to the station after work. It was really rather fortunate that his employer had agreed to give him part of the afternoon off to assist in this. He didn’t want to wait until the weekend. People were less cooperative when you were interrupting their fun time.
Dean realized Cas meant to go home, with him. He felt his head shake, slowly, sadly, before he realized he couldn’t. Not until he said what he needed to say. Castiel’s smile faltered for a moment, then righted itself, waiting.
“I’m not a mechanic, but I know when something is about to go boom. And she was definitely primed to blow. It was way too hot under there, just for starters. It’s still too hot under there. We had to get creative with mirrors and extra gear to even check it out.”
Dean’s body was not nearly as confused as his mind, though. It shifted slightly, and feeling restrained by Castiel’s arms, shifted harder, trying to move his own arms where they belonged, to bring the warm body closer, to angle the head where he wanted it.
When Mike asked him if he wanted to dance, he followed willingly, if less gracefully than he normally would have. He liked dancing. Dancing was fun. Not unlike some of the more precise maneuvers of combat flying, he told Mike. Mike asked if he was a pilot, and Cas chuckled and danced away.
“Yes. Thank you for jumping in and getting the girl out of there. I was worried I was going to have to blow my cover.”
Dean had to clear his throat, his hands going to the edge of the towel as if they meant to just rest on his hips.
When they finally went up to their respective rooms, Dean had tried to settle down and go to sleep, but he was too ramped up. He paced until he was sure he was going to wake up Cas, and ended up going downstairs, sitting where Cas had sat earlier, and driving his nose into the chair cushion, hoping that what was left of his scent would help him relax into sleep.
He took a moment to arrange the wedges meticulously on the plate. Careful not to spill, Cas poured some of the caramel dipping sauce onto the apple pieces. He was so focused and precise Dean found himself wondering if Cas had at some point calculated the exact amount of caramel syrup that would produce the best results and experimented with different ways to dispense it until he had arrived at this method. It was such a Cas thing to do he couldn’t help staring.
He was still there at 4 a.m. when Cas stumbled down the steps, and landed at the bottom, laughing hysterically at his own lack of coordination. He appeared to be singing. And very, very drunk.
It was the longest 5 minutes of his life, but then Cas was escorting the bomb squad to their location, and one officer was lifting a model’s head off. Several other officers were coordinating the evacuation of the building so it could be swept for any additional threats. Dean was pretty sure they wouldn’t find any, but it couldn’t hurt to check it out. Comic Con would resume first thing in the morning as usual.
Shit. He was going to have to talk to Cas about this, wasn’t he? That was the rule, wasn’t it? Omega rule #2, agreed to just this morning. He groaned, and went to his room, to draw up plans and gather materials for his first class next week.
It's been at least twice as long as I normally take between chapters, but I've been busily sewing cloth masks for my friends. Enjoy, and apologies for the late posting.
“Come on in, Cas,” and his voice got huskier as he spoke, each word more seductive than the last. “Allow me to show you just how very wrong you are.”
Somehow, he was looking at security camera footage if the food court. He found the table he’d been sitting at, and skipped ahead to where the child showed up, and then followed her when the man grabbed her away. They had to switch cameras probably 6 or 7 times. What Charlie could pull off in a few minutes amazed even him sometimes.
Except he never quite ran out of money. He drove all that night and at daybreak, he found a good place to pull off the road and watch the sun rise. On impulse, he set his phone to record and propped it up on the windshield. He thought a moment, and grabbed his guitar from the back seat, where he’d left it after the last band practice. The sunrise would take a while, and this would keep his hands and his mind busy while he waited. He sat on the hood of his car, strumming on the guitar, as the sun rose, silhouetting him in the phone’s view. Finally, when the sun was over the horizon, he picked up the phone and turned off the video.
Apologies for the delay. Some storms knocked our internet service out for over a week, and I didn't want to do this on my phone.
“It was just… stupid, really,” Dean took a deep breath, resolving to just get it over with. He grabbed both their cups and went to the sink.
“As you can see, this place is a bit soulless right now, and it got me thinking. I’ve always wanted a pet. When I had a home with my parents, I wasn’t allowed a pet, and then I spent years hopping one international flight after another, so a pet wasn’t really an option. Honestly, it kinda still isn’t. I’m not done travelling yet, I don’t think. But I do have a solid base of operations now, and so I was thinking maybe I could foster for now, work my way up to a more permanent thing.”
Quickly, he rifled through the system looking for paperwork. These sorts of things usually required permits and security. What major events were going to be in the area in the next month?
Aziraphale and Crowley were perusing comics across the open area and beyond them was…. Beyond them was the food court. Good place for a bomb, really. It would be packed at certain times. Lots of trash cans you could walk right up to with a bundled-up bag of something and leave it without arousing suspicion. But no, that was too easy. What kind of message would that send?
But Dean couldn’t figure out what to say. Had Cas crossed a line? It hadn’t really felt like it then. Maybe because Dean himself wanted to vault over that line himself.
“There’s no truck. You just want to distract me so I can’t do what I’m here to do cause you’re one of them. I’m not going.”
“Shut up, it was great. I danced! Cher is fun, even if she’s wrong about kisses, and I found a song that sounds like flying.”
As soon as the coffee was ready, he dragged himself back to his phone as fast as he could go and turned it on again. There was just enough charge to show him that he had indeed called Charlie. They had apparently talked for over two hours. Probably until the phone went dead. He’d woken her up at 2 am. Ish. He wished he could remember. He could have used the comfort of her friendship right now. He turned to the coffee for comfort instead, and between the warmth of the coffee, the aspirin and the relief that he had not broken the terms of his agreement with his family, he slumped down on the bed, and drifted off into sleep again.
By noon he was feeling considerably better about his day. Sam had eaten the pancakes. They had spent a few hours looking for possible cases online, but things seemed to be pretty quiet at the moment. This afternoon, he’d devote a few hours to taking care of Baby, then he’d make his extra special burgers for dinner and after, he’d settle down for the latest Dr Sexy.
“When he was with us he got drunk. A lot. And when he was drunk, he rambled. I don’t know if it was trauma or brain damage or what. But he kept going on about demons and vampires and all kinds of things like that. And sometimes he’d think I was one of them. Never Sammy. Just me.”
When they pulled up to the house, it became pretty clear that it was empty. They checked out all the rooms, working their way up from the basement and came up empty, right up until they got to one of the upstairs bedrooms. It looked… untouched. Like the family hadn’t been able to clear out the room before they moved out. There was dust, but not too much. And the second they walked into the room, the radio came on, blasting Taylor Swift. This song, to be exact.
He noticed the man first. He told himself it was just because he was seriously the hottest guy he’d seen in a long time. Why he’d be wasting his time with those plastic G.I. Douchebags he was talking to was beyond Dean. But he saw that the man started looking around like he needed a way out, and that got his attention.
“Zep songs, uh? Did you know our dad gave our mom a mixtape of Zep songs before they got married? It’s practically a Winchester tradition.”
“Listen, I can see that you’re busy, and I’m sure Mr. Casteel is also quite occupied, but I have other deliveries to make. I really just need a second.”
Dean snatched the last piece like it was about to burn a hole through their amp. Cas ate the rest of his pie in contemplative silence, a small smile coming and going as he ate.
Dean gripped his toothbrush like it was a blade, turned around and marched across to Castiel’s bedroom like an avenging angel ready for battle. The sad and lonely scent that greeted him stopped him cold as soon as the door opened and he kicked himself yet again for all the times he’d insisted that he couldn’t feel happy and safe without his own room. Gods, he was an idiot.
With a flourish, Cas faded into the background and the video he’d taken on his phone of band practicing the new chorus took over. They played it through a couple of times, with minor adjustments, then they broke from that to make some notes. Castiel’s voice came on then, from behind the camera.
He spent rather more time thinking about Cas and all he’d learned about him since he arrived here. He didn’t pry. There was no need. He was Jimmy, and too many people were all too happy to tell him about his namesake. The kind of pup he’d been. Who he’d dated. How he did in school. Random stories of moments of kindness or rebellion that amused everyone. Nothing that seemed to indicate a murderous spirit.
“How many times have we done that, Cas? Fought some monster, back-to-back. You with your blade, me with the shotgun, or a catana, with armies of monsters coming at us?”
“Before I went to sleep it dawned on me that we are both atypical people. And therefore, it stands to reason a typical arrangement wouldn’t really suit us. It occurs to me, Dean, that it doesn’t matter what’s expected of us in general. Only what we expect of each other.”
He saw Castiel’s nostrils flare, his eyes close, as if he wanted to remember every detail of that smell. Then his eyes opened again, and there was a different sort of light in them. He bucked, and Dean didn’t even try to resist. He went down, and in the next heartbeat Castiel’s groin was pressing his into the mat, Dean’s legs still wide around Castiel’s hips. Castiel’s elbows held Dean’s arms down, and his hands were on Dean’s wrists. And Dean was whimpering helplessly, his head tossed back to expose his neck.
He saw a man stand up, then crouch to surface later a few seats down the aisle. He would put money on that being the guy they wanted. The other guy, the one that dropped his popcorn, he never got a very good look at. He had light colored hair, as far as he could tell. Average height, probably, though that was hard to judge while he was sitting down. He seemed fit, healthy. Alert. Restless. He seemed to be really focused on the movie. The kind of guy who came here to watch a movie and not to make a scene and ruin everyone’s evening. He must have seen something when he dropped the popcorn.
This was never a good way to start a conversation. Dean made himself take a deep breath. Was this the part where Cas finally let him have it for running away like he did? Running a con on him? He deserved it, he knew that. But he wasn’t sure he could take it right now.
“I suppose it wouldn’t help things if I said I didn’t actually do that. I didn’t say there was a bomb. I said the bus was gonna blow. Which it was. But yeah, I did make it sound like a bomb threat, because I wanted them to actually do something about it.”
“O, nothing. He seems to have gotten turned around. I gather he went to the bathroom, took a wrong turn on the way out, and somehow ended up in the back hallways that lead to the unloading dock.”
By the time Ellen had joined them with the pancakes, Benny was letting himself in the back door, with Charlie and Donna on his heels. Dean’s knock came as the syrup was getting passed around the table a minute later.
Cas. He’d never really needed anyone before. He’d never felt like he could. Needing things he could handle. Needing people? He had always been a loner, and content to be alone. In his own life, in his own bedroom, in his own bed. Not like he’d had a choice before. He had a choice now, though, and he was afraid.
Castiel spoke to the passengers, but he already knew there was no threat to anyone. It was pretty clear what had happened. Mystery guy tried to warn them about the engine. He got shut down. He stopped the bus the only way he could think of.
Dean had asked for the carnitas burrito, and even though Cas was more of a carne assada man, he got carnitas as well. Just for a change is all. No need to read too much into it. They ate in front of the TV that night, laughing at Knight Rider reruns, and if Miller didn’t come up, well. The point had been to be available to be asked, if Dean wanted to know.
“The second thing you need to know is that I’m a grown ass man,” Dean stood up, then, moved closer. “I made a choice and if there are consequences I’ll face them like a grown ass man. I don’t need you or anyone taking the bullet for me. And whenever there is a decision to be made that affects both of us, I expect my boyfriend to be completely honest with me and include me in the decision.”
Cas put the beer bottle down and buried his face in his hands. Dean looked at Sam for a clue. This was definitely not about pie, and he was pretty sure it wasn’t about Frank and Dr. Sexy anymore either. Sam looked a bit stabby, clearly wanting him to do something, but as that wasn’t especially helpful when Dean didn’t even know what they were talking about yet, he just gestured his confusion. Somewhere between an increasingly confused look and an epic bitchface, He felt Cas get up and run his hands through his hair.
It was three days and 4 videos later when he finally spent some money on anything other than gas. He needed a shower, and a good night’s sleep in a real bed. And a real meal. He’d been driving as the mood struck, winding his way in a generally eastward direction, sticking to side roads as much as he could. One of those led to a cheap motel, and he stopped there for the night.
“Even if you lose, you change the world by merely fighting. Who doesn’t want to make a difference?” Cas summed up.
Cas was perhaps, too amused by their reactions, but as he was bending over the bundle, unwrapping the pastry, and nobody was looking at his face, he didn’t try to hide it. The perfectly golden crust came into view, and the hand that had removed the basket, or one just like it, produced the pie server that had been tucked into it.
Everyone moved then. People started looking around, irritated, confused. The man was also looking, his eyes darting around, as if he wasn’t quite sure how to handle the disruption to his plans.
He turned the camera to a scrawny looking tree that couldn’t be more than 5 feet tall and was not full enough to cast a proper shade.
He wanted to feel like he could reach out and touch Dean without wondering if he was being tolerated because he was in charge in the situation they were in. Like he could hang out without having to keep things professional. Like he could stop hiding the way his eyes wanted to drift to Dean all the time. The way he wanted to get Dean talking about something he was passionate about and just bask in the attention.
“I know you rolled into town a man of the world at 14, and in many ways I must have seemed like an unbearable child to you. But I had been just as alone as you were since I was 5 and my parents signed me up for school and then went on with their lives without me. I was 5 the first time I made my own decisions, Dean. I made my own decisions for a decade without you. And I still made my own decisions while we were together. You didn’t change that. You
“But the pie will go sour, the crust will get soggy. It might have been the most delicious pie ever, and it won’t matter if he waits too long.”
With a goofy grin, Dean slipped a tape into the deck, turned up the volume, and headed West. Into the sunset.
It had never felt wonderful before. Sure, getting behind Baby’s wheel and hitting the road had its own special charm, and if they weren’t on the way to gank some monster, it was even a great thrill. But wonderful? All his life had been full of before was grief and battles and problems. There just might be wonder now, though. Sitting across from the table from him, smiling with those blue, blue eyes of his. Mouthing the words, even.
“People just – don’t believe me. And there’s not usually enough time to convince them that I’m not crazy. It’s easier to just… make something up.”
It was immediately clear that where before there had been focused energy, Dean was now mostly anxious. Which Cas shouldn’t find unusual, since this was the first sting Dean was involved with. But it was so unlike Dean that he couldn’t help becoming more than a bit nervous himself. Was he sensing something?
That’s when he saw it snap. Something in Castiel’s eyes just changed. His mouth pressed into the exposed neck and he held Dean against the wall with his body, releasing his hands to tug at Dean’s pants, yank them roughly down as far as he could get them, then up again to hold Dean’s head steady. All finesse forgotten for the moment, he nibbled hungrily at Dean’s lips, his feet nudging Dean’s legs apart, his knee sliding up Dean’s inner thigh as his foot looked for the pants and pushed them the rest of the way down. His right hand reached for Dean’s thigh, pulling his foot free of the pants and encouraging Dean to lock his leg around him.
The brothers shared another significant look, and for Charlie’s benefit, Dean tossed a “showtime” into the room.
“I could. Unfortunately, I left the house in a huff cause Dean was being a dick and I didn’t grab my wallet.”
He went back to his office, grabbed the papers all over his desk, and left. He had things to do. He should go to the venue and talk to the organizers. Look for potential hot spots where someone might hide, or where they might hide something. Like a bomb, or a gun. Familiarize himself with security procedures and personnel. Check out the layout of the building.
“It’s not, actually, at all. But lately a lot of people seemed to have decided it was. There are a lot of religious references, so I imagine a lot of people don’t understand the lyrics.”
It had been overwhelming pretty quickly though, trying to keep up with classes and a job and getting Sammy ready for college. Sammy, of course, had to go to college. For one thing, he wanted to. He’d make a great lawyer someday. He’d change the world, Dean just knew it. And he was going to get him there. Their father sure as hell wasn’t. Wherever he was hanging out these days.
So Cas was into guys. Or at least one guy. He wanted to catalogue all the men that Cas might have been involved in since the fall. He only knew about the one time Cas had had sex with a woman. Anyway, not his business, he made himself not go there. There was no point. But that did explain why Cas was so determined to ship Dr. Sexy and Frank. What do you even call that ship, anyway? Frexy? Drank? This whole idea was just too stupid. Dr. Sexy was – oh, oh, he cracked it now!
How would it have been if they’d met in some other way? If Dean had met Cas instead of Alex all those years ago, maybe? Or if Dean had made his clean get away in the Impala and just bumped into Cas somewhere down the road? He honestly didn’t know if he would have given Cas a second look. He was hot, sure. But naïve, in many ways. They might have hooked up. But most likely he never would have been more than a hookup or a mark.
A collective moan went through the room when everyone got a taste of the pie, and Cas finally dug into his slice. Nobody said another word for a few minutes as the pie steadily disappeared from the plates. Then a fork clattered onto a plate and everyone looked at Dean, who had finished his slice and was now eyeing the one slice left on the pie pan.
“You should never have been made to feel that way at all. I had no right to take my shit out on you.”
“I really don’t have a lot of time right now, I have to go back to work in a minute but…” Cas sat on the edge of his bed and faced him, squaring his shoulders.
He extricated himself from Cas and made his way to the bathroom. He made his way through his morning routine without giving anything much thought, until he went to brush his teeth and stopped, looking at Castiel’s toothbrush.
“I thought we were here to fight for freedom, not to scare little girls.” The detective tried again to deflect, leaning in to stage whisper it to Jones.
“I know, it sounds pretentious, but my followers started calling me that somewhere between Salem and the Grand Canyon and it stuck, so I decided I might as well embrace it.”
“Dean?” Ellen asked, and somehow managed to imbue that one word with a dozen questions. Where are you going? Are you okay? Do you want to do this? Should we drop it?
Dean made himself focus on Castiel’s eyes, on the love shining out of them. Was he holding his breath? Why was he holding his breath?
“I think this is my favorite spot,” he quietly asserted. “Of all the wonders here, this one speaks the loudest.”
“I also told him I was onto him and here with a cop, so he better use them to settle up and tip his waitress.”
He was staring at the feed from officer Miller’s cam. Or rather, he would be, except that his cam seemed to have gotten covered up somehow. They were looking at his coat lining.
He called the resident mechanic to check out the engine and called the station for an expert to come look at it as well. Then he made his way to where the passengers and the driver were waiting.
“Here, let me,” and Charlie walks right up like she’s got plans to R2-D2 in her back pocket, knocks gently on a couple of spots, and with a nod, goes to work on a hidden panel on the side of the droid.
Needing to break that gaze long enough to get his act together, he gestured in the general direction the car they’d be taking was parked, and Dean headed that way. It was fine. He made himself think about the case and the people they were going to interview. He could think about the rest of it in a few hours.
When they got back into the Impala, it was about 2 hours later. Cas was loaded up with both cotton candy *and* popcorn, and he’d somehow found a balloon in the shape of a car that looked vaguely like it was trying to be a T-bird, which was why they got into the Impala good naturedly arguing about which was the better car, with much (fake) outrage from Dean on Baby’s behalf, and more chuckles than either had indulged in for some time.
He froze the video in that critical spot. It was hard to be sure, but it seemed that popcorn guy would have had a great view of their shooter when he dropped the popcorn the second time. Maybe even when he dropped it the first time and cleaned up his mess.
He sat up straighter at that. Maybe it was because his life had always been about keeping people alive, or because he had died and returned so many times. So the concept of not wanting to live under any circumstances was foreign instinctively. But then he thought of how willingly he’d sacrificed his life for Sammy… He’d not wanted to die, of course. He wanted to live even as he walked into his doom. But humans must inevitably die sooner or later. And what if he didn’t have to die, but Sammy or – or Cas did. What would it be like to go on for eternity without them?
While Naomi sputtered, and Dean wondered if he should remind Naomi to call Legal (again), Jody instead changed tacks.
He snatched the child up, gave a perfunctory nod in the general direction of the men, and carried her away chattering on about ice cream flavors and different kinds of toppings before they could figure out what had just happened. He spotted Sammy, finally coming to meet them with their sundaes, and met him halfway, pulling him along inside the joint where they’d just bought the ice cream and to a table. The girl ended up eating Sam’s sundae, while Sam shared his own. With those military grade puppy dog eyes, he got the girl to tell him that her mom was in the hospital, and she was here with dad and his sister. They were going to be mad that she had wondered off.
But Cas was already out the passenger door, and in another moment, getting into the back seat and shoving the bags of treats into the front again.
“Also, I decided on cats for now. Thanks everyone for all the great advice on the other video. It really helped a lot. I have purchased the biggest cat tree I could find and ordered one of those self-contained litter boxes that cleans itself. Next, food and toys, and then sometime next week I should be ready to foster my first guest.”
He hated that he had to stop and think about that for a minute. There were a lot of things he needed, but he wasn’t used to being asked. What should he say? What was the right answer? The look on Castiel’s face told him he was taking too long, and probably overthinking this to death. He made himself breathe and keep it simple. That’s when he remembered Charlie, and how great it had been to feel useful again.
