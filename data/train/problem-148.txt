They continued this pushing, sinking, squeezing until Sherlock was impaled on John’s cock. Sherlock’s head was thrown back and John had his hands on Sherlock’s hips. “Ride me,” and he guided that gorgeous body up and down his cock. Sherlock leaned forward and rested his hands on John’s shoulders as he lifted his hips up and down, creating beautiful friction, meeting John thrust for thrust. “Harder, John, harder,” he panted. John planted his feet on the mattress and began to force his hips higher and higher, watching Sherlock’s wet, delicious cock bouncing between them. He pulled Sherlock forward a bit, adjusted his angle, and thrust. “JOHN!” Sherlock screamed as his prostate was suddenly slammed into.
John lifted his head and looked into Sherlock's eyes. He lifted his eyebrow's up in question. Sherlock tilted one side of his lips up in a devilish grin. "That, John, was ..." and threw his head back, trying to catch his breath. "I had no idea .."
John began by running his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides. He noticed how narrow Sherlock’s waist was and how silky the shirt felt against his skin. His fingers splayed wider and wider with each pass, causing Sherlock to sigh as callused hands brushed closely by his nipples.
“John ... ah .. ah ... don’t stop ..” Sherlock was shaking, his movements erratic as he chased his orgasm, feeling his prostate hit with every move. Finally, he felt the tight spring inside of him release as he came in one, two, three, four spurts over John’s chest, ejaculate dripping down John’s hand. “Don’t stop John, come inside me,” he pleaded.
“Holy shit, Sherlock, you’re so fucking tight ... aaaah ...,” he stuttered when Sherlock squeezed his muscles. “Oh yeah, do that again, make it tighter for me.” He pushed up more.
John took advantage of the neck exposed before him and started to nibble at it. "Yeah?" he said softly, "You liked that?"
“Ohhhhhhh,” they moaned in unison when John’s cock breached him. Sherlock let it slip inside him barely a centimeter or two and held still. It felt raw, full, amazing. John pushed up a bit, and Sherlock took the hint and slid down more.
“Yes, John, God yes, I don’t care!” and slid down the wall until his face was level with John’s. John looked up and they met in the middle with a clashing of teeth and licking of lips and tongues, battling for dominance. They continued as best they could while walking down the hallway into Sherlock’s bedroom, falling on the bed in a tangle, Sherlock on top of John. John’s rough jeans against Sherlock’s cock felt divine, but Sherlock wanted more.
“In the drawer, John. Use it. Open me up further,” Sherlock breathed into John’s ear and sucked and kissed his neck.
Suddenly John stood up and flipped Sherlock around and began to suck his left nipple, while pinching the one on the right. Sherlock held his head there with both hands. “Yeah?” John breathed into skin. “You liked that?”
“Bedroom. Go.” John ordered and Sherlock slowly walked through the kitchen, confident and sure. John tore off his jumper as he followed Sherlock, staring at his perfect bottom as Sherlock’s hips moved with each step. When they reached the hallway, John couldn’t wait another moment. “Stop,” he said. “Turn and put your arms on the wall.” Sherlock obeyed.
“John!!” Sherlock screamed and slapped a hand over the back of John’s head to hold him there and began to buck and moan. John was fucking his arse with his tongue and Sherlock knew his legs were going to give out any second. “I caaa...n’t ... stay up ... ohhhhhhhh ...” he groaned as John pulled his tongue out and spread it flat and wide as pushed and rubbed it on that sensitive spot, moaning himself. Sherlock was going to come any second.
John spun Sherlock around and looked into those verdigris eyes, dilated and glazed. “Are you ok?” he asked Sherlock, studying his face. Sherlock answered by grabbing the back of John's head and pulling it into his neck. John took his cue and sucked right above Sherlock’s collar bone and licked a line up his jaw. John was panting and devouring as much skin as he could. Sherlock moaned and grabbed John’s shoulders, pulling him closer and not letting go.
John groaned and began to thrust up, losing himself in the feeling of wet warmth and the suction of Sherlock's mouth. He was so close ... any minute he would explode down Sherlock's throat. "Stop, stop .. come up here ... I don't want to ... not yet.. "
With this thought, Sherlock sent out a call, his other servants awaiting him back home. His thoughts were firm and resolved.
with, Sherlock concluded. Claude would most likely be the easiest not only to get information out of but to handle, should things get out of hand. As it was, John seemed more interested in the
The Dragonling huffed, and with the noise a faint puff of smoke left her lips. She smiled in delight at John's obvious surprise at the act, grin curling mischievously. “Mrs Hudson will go spare if you set fire to anything.” She laughed at her Papa's gallows-expression, and responded by blowing a puff of smoke that was shaped impressively like a bunny rabbit. John had been sure to buy his daughter's winter coat several sizes too big, allowing for the child to tuck her wings tightly to her spine, hiding the bump just effectively enough that it was lost in the puffy padding. Buttoning it up to the chin, Elena wrinkled her nose in distaste.
And his heels dug gently into Soo Lin's side, and the Dragon took off like a coiled spring, Andy's form clutching to her as effortlessly the Chinese Dragon curled through the hole the English Dragon had left through only a moment before.
“The Dragon will still require care and watching, John. Even if you were to do it yourself without Sherlock, your Dragon would still be around the hormones the Dragon creates because they would leave imprints on your clothing and skin.”
The man lifts his chin defiantly, crossing his arms over his chest. His stance is wide, defensive for the moment instead of offensive. His voice doesn't tremble as he replies.
Warmth then filled them, and she was Aventurine in her mind once more, a mingling of the two Gems that had come together to create something new and
John felt a tug in his stomach then, something tight and warm. Lestrade was no longer staring into his teacup like it held the world’s answers, instead choosing to regard the man before him evenly. The Selkie’s dark eyes were kind, and his voice had a comforting lilt to it.
In the next instant he was sitting up, shrugging off the sleep-shirt he was wearing, slipping it over the egg even as Sherlock came running back to the bed, brandishing in his arms layers of jumpers. The Dragon's hands were trembling as he gathered the bed's comforter around the spherical container that held their would-be child, a panicked whimper wrenching itself from the detective's throat as he slipped John's ugly Christmas Jumper over the egg's surface. Sherlock then pressed himself over the egg, covering it with his body, the next second reaching out for John to drag him closer as well. Under his breath John's partner muttered in panicky syllables, something painful hitching his voice as he assessed the state of the egg between them.
. Shifting slowly back to his Human form, Sherlock stared at his hands. The strange, fleshy suit made of magic and biology was no different from any man's, if not for his collar he'd be indistinguishable from a mere mortal. Yet all of his life, he
Sarah watched the man she had only just met shrug on his clothes, pausing only to thank her for the night. He was surprisingly gentle as he touched her hand once with a brush of his knuckles, but his gaze was distant. She didn't stop him, her heart still pounding in her throat and her thoughts confused as she drew her blankets tighter about herself.
So this poor story has been going to neglect for some time and for that I apologize ^.^ that being said I hope you enjoy, as the next chapter we'll be looking more into the cases and moriarty :)
The young man reared up off of his back, fingers clawing into the silken sheets beneath him, shimmering blue like waves of water as his head whipped about, searching for clues as to where he'd been taken. John found memories coming back to him, all hazy and indistinct, but they did not serve to soothe but rather agitate him further, especially as he came to know that he was lying on a bed made for a king.
“As part of the contract for my… services I require security. I know what a lot of high-ranking individuals, both Human and Gem alike. If their position is unfavourable in the public eye, I could be put at risk.”
John didn't need to finish his thoughts, the detective seemed to understand. His features shuttered, and he set down his fork to drum his fingers nervously on his thighs. His voice was tight.
It wasn’t until a particular case occurred in which the murderer was particularly good at hiding the cause of death of his patients that Sherlock finally paid her any mind. Sherlock was brilliant at deduction, lethal with Chemistry, and his knowledge of dead bodies came only second to someone who had been formally trained in pathology. It frustrated him endlessly that the murderer seemed to be walking circles about both the Yard and himself, and even John began to wish that the case might be solved, if only so he could catch some sleep. He yawned, bracing himself against the lab table and trying not to doze off. Sherlock paced, frenetic and tugging at his inky curls as if he might like to yank them out.
The English Dragon paused, but did not succumb to John's placating words, his fists still clenched and his jaw still tight despite the fact that he swayed on his feet in nothing but his pants and the crisp white bandage splayed over his chest. John noted absently that the Dragon's arm should have been in a sling (to alleviate stress on the bone) even as he kept a wide stance, neither threatening nor moving.
If the neighbours saw Sebastian Wilked being flung from the second-story window of the young man’s flat, well… He was never exactly well liked in the neighbourhood to begin with.
That had been it, really. John had gone to school, taken his lessons. He had a snack when he got home, went to bed and closed his eyes. He had forgotten all about the radio report by the time he began to dream, nestled into the warmth and safety of his covers. He kissed his mum goodnight and he didn’t think much of it all, only a distant and hazy thought towards stars and rocketships. He went to sleep oblivious, peaceful in the knowledge that his mum and da were nearby, and that Harry was sound asleep across from him in her own bed.
He had no binder with him, having left his flat in a hurry. Sherlock did not even have a real coat on him.
It is nearly three hours later into the night when John Watson, looking for all the world like he's dead asleep in his bed, opens his eyes. In the dark, those irises gleam like quicksilver, cat-like and wary as slowly the man rises. Except one might be able to tell if they looked closely that the person that had overtaken the Doctor was most definitely
Told himself this even as tears filled his eyes, and soundlessly John cried into his stuffed animal, feeling the scar on his arm pulse once more desperately, tendril fingers slipping and breaking from him.
John caught the lines, the noise of it humming in his blood even as his feet carried him forward. It was a melody, a story he'd known since he was a very small boy. It was one of the first tunes he had ever been blessed to hear. A beautiful song, asking the local Water-Spirit for the precious liquid it could provide that the village always so sorely missed.
by now. You're a better man then I am, Mr. Holmes. I love classical music, but I always feel it's missing something. It's my hobby, transitioning classic pieces into rock. Fun hobby, a mix of new and old.”
, becoming immobile and staring calmly at his lap as he sat cross-legged against the back of the fridge.
John and Molly both had to comfort the man for nearly an hour afterwards, Mike’s sobbing only driving an iron spike further into all of their chests. John had expected military life to be challenging, cruel in a more distant sense. This, however, this felt personal. This felt… too real. Molly’s cry, the way her body had convulsed, he had felt Sherlock flinch minutely in response to it. The truth was, the Dragon was terrified, on some level. Terrified that he would only be next in this ordeal.
Sure enough, the Colonel was speaking, addressing the soldiers calmly and confidently. His gaze swept over John, resting instead on Murray, and his voice was a silky purr as he cocked his head to the side. No Morstan to call him out on his actions this time.
The people of the East celebrated the Water Gods that protected them, and sacrificed gifts to the specific spirits said to watch over their villages. Tonight, Sherlock would be offered a bride. Just like every year, a traditional practice. It was was considered an honour to the women of the village, if they were chosen to stand in the centre of the town, dressed in lavish robes and wearing the clay face-paint that would offer them up as a gift. No one took it too seriously, at least not any longer. After all, no one in the village had been taken in, well...
“If you do move into, um… …221B Baker Street, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
would you know about destructive tendencies?! An invalided army doctor, sent home from a war that he should be happy to be out of yet misses, a kicked
“I understand if you think my methods cruel. Believe me, I do. But I'd rather be seen as cruel than watch a boy that's only just moved away from everything he's ever known be shot down like cannon-fodder in a bloodbath. The fact remains that out of the two of you, the Dragon should always be the one with the instinct to protect. Even if I had shot Sherlock at point-blank range, he may very well have survived. His scales are strong enough to deflect bullets at a far enough distance, and at a close one they make it difficult to actually inflict damage to his insides.”
pride rumbled in disquiet at allowing John to face any potential threat of his own, especially within the lines of their own shared territory (for Sherlock had already begun to think of the flat as
He blinked angrily as he roughly shrugged off the person's arm who was trying to help him up off the floor, glaring about him as he struggled to make sense of exactly where he was. Because if he was awake, then surely there must be some kind of battle going on. Because Conrad wasn't allowed free reign unless The Body was in danger. That was an iron rule that he had willingly participated in, because to be honest Conrad
“Those things will kill you.” His friend had muttered by way of greeting, shivering even as snow fell about the two young men, drifting between them. Sherlock didn't answer, not the slightest bit cold, partly due to constitution and partly due to the fact that he was still running on the last dredges of a high. The creak of his ribs was a welcome blossom of pain as he shrugged, warm and tingling as he responded softly “Breathing is boring.”
A slow, lazy grin crawled across the man's face, and the ex-army doctor's blue eyes swam with a madness unleashed even as he sang
“Prat.” John muttered supportively, causing Sherlock’s mouth to twitch upwards in a small smile. The detective hummed in agreement, wrapping his arms more tightly about John’s frame. It felt good, all of this.
Sherlock seemed to pause and consider for a moment longer, weighing how much effort it would take to derail such a confrontation. Seeming to deem it not worth the trouble, he heaved upon a rather heavy beleaguered sigh. Slouching with his legs wider than that of an uncaring child he sat, pausing only to spread the towel at his feet onto the chair, lest he stain the material. They sat facing one another for an instant, Sherlock refusing stubbornly to meet John's gaze, the army doctor refusing to tear his eyes away from the detective's face. It stretched on painfully and awkwardly, like a string on a violin being wound too tightly, and Sherlock scowled under it and chafed like a little boy being told off for taking the last cookie in the jar. His hands twitched with it, drumming on the arm rests of his chair in unsteady rhythms, and he shifted under the steady glare of his friend like he longed to writhe away from it. The delicate turn of his mouth pursed with words that he seemed to be struggling to say.
Just when it seemed either Murray or the Colonel would spring to attack, there was an impatient sigh from the back of the line. Wilkes' head snapped reflectively about, and consequently so did everyone else's. John watched as the man's face turned from red with rage to pale with dread.
“We want to know about Sherlock's life. His childhood.” And then in an even softer voice that despite its kind tone sent a shiver of ice into the office like an overhanging deep freeze. He whispered the offer to his pact.
flight to survive this war, and he couldn't show up to the base without having at least one practice run in the city. The second fact was: the Dragon was
John could only assume by the current state he was in and the slightly manic look in his partner's eyes that he had gotten accidentally caught up in one of Sherlock's more obscure experiments. His sigh was one of long-suffering patience and sleepiness, and Sherlock didn't seem to even register it on his radar, so consumed as he was in creating a blanket cocoon.
At first, the Dragon wondered if maybe he had gone unconscious. But no, he could see the slow rise and fall of the Human's chest.
thought. Something that was growing increasingly apparent as he realised that his flatmate hadn't yet returned. Fidgeting in place, the detective bit his lower lip as he briefly debated just phoning John. However, he soon realised that the action was bordering on shy and cowardly, and Sherlock Holmes was not one to blush and stutter like some moronic schoolgirl. He didn't care about social norms, being normal was
(Not that he really believed in such things, though Dragon Gods seemed more sensible to him than the Human's version of a deity.)
His mother had smiled, her grin a slow, curling and sarcastic thing. Many said Sherlock's smile was much the same, though he often had little to smile about. Mummy would sigh in fond annoyance at her youngest son's sheer ridiculousness.
Like a true Dragon, it had been shown to John over time that his Draconian flatmate wasn't one to share.
To John’s surprise, it was Sherlock who knelt in the sand, answering for him. The Northern Dragon’s pale blue eyes looked into the stranger’s with an approximation of kindness, the kind that John had yet to see on his companion’s face.
“See, using that nickname on me is the exact reason why people often think we’re in a gay relationship, three way sometimes when your Molly is around.”
Weakness. Sentiment. Possessiveness. The amount of pride that demanded Sherlock present his Mate to the rest of his pod was all instinct, but it still hummed in his blood like fire.
There are times when even an average person; let alone a man like Sherlock Holmes, could read the killing intent in a man’s eyes even when it was carefully hidden by a mask of indifference. When said man’s gaze could strip you of your very flesh and leave you feeling exposed and fragile, your pulsing organs laid bare before him and quivering with vulnerability. The detective himself hadn’t ever exactly been a person to soften his gaze either, but for a moment he could understand the way John sometimes shifted uncomfortably underneath his harsh scrutiny. Why he would occasionally snap at him to
Sherlock had made a scoffing sound of dismissal at the mention of a gala, yet John noticed the way the man’s eyes sharpened upon his brother’s later admission. Rising from the floor, he could tell that the detective despite his false indifference was now properly paying attention.
Still, he quickly admitted to himself even as he marched down cold stone hallways that the palace was beautiful, in an austere and frightening way. Towering buttresses unfolded to John like a woman’s fan, revealing elaborately carved stonework that glittered with a strange mineral that John could not identify. The entire palace seemed to be made of it, and it went far above the torches that glowed luminescent blue at steady intervals. While John walked down what appeared to be a spiralling staircase, Molly kept up a steady stream of chatter behind him.
Sitting up abruptly, the Dragon looked at himself in the mirror. Milk-white skin laced with scars and blue-green eyes reflected an image to him. His image. The collar at his throat glinted, silver and electronic. Fingers brushed it carefully as a fire began to burn in the Dragon's mind, one made of ice.
“You might as well just kill me. I won’t listen to anything you want.” John’s voice came out harsh in the darkness, tight and stressed. His strength, no more powerful than a kitten to Sherlock made the Demon feel as if he were holding something infinitely fragile beneath him.
The way John’s gaze cast itself to the side was answer enough. Mycroft’s upper lip twitched in minute triumph, and he gestured the prone figure Sherlock made curled in the tub.
a fire Dragon. I’m allowed.” Molly laughed. Xavi grinned, unapologetic. He watched as Molly fiddled with the baby’s claws, playing with her snout and smiling when she snorted in laughter.
In the darkness of the cold water surrounding him, John felt a cold nose nuzzling possessively between his collarbone and neck. The feeling of it brought the memory of the young boy doing something similar, except then his voice hadn't been able to completely turn John into a wordless mannequin. The feeling of it also caused something to shudder through John, and he would call it terror, if it weren't for how hard he flinched when a pair of surprisingly gentle lips pressed against where his carotid artery thrummed with life.
It was in the way that John quickly had to realise just how hard it was to blend into the background when army fatigues identified you not as a protector, but a potentially dangerous threat.
like the horse from one of her favourite children's books, and with her brother temporarily forgotten, Cara found herself turning, taking a tentative step forward. The pony for its part seemed unafraid of her, whinnying softly at her approach. One hoof pawed the ground almost as if in greeting, and its ears were pricked forward, towards her.
Sherlock watched as John blinked slowly, seeming to absorb his words (or at least attempting). With microscopic movements, John’s gaze flicked towards his shoulder, the floor. Sherlock could see the soldier in the man cataloging the hardwood floor, as well as the lack of a wound. When John spoke again, it was a trembling sound that seemed to make the world freeze over.
She'd hiss at her as she'd help herself to a second slice of cake, complete with horrible blue frosting and white icing flowers. Her manicured hands had been rough as she'd cleaned the eight-year old's face, scowling the way she did when Shyla did something not-good or scandalous. Later in the car, she'd ask innocently “Did you eat well, dear?” And when Shyla replied with an enthusiastic “Yes!” She'd mutter “Sure looked like it.” Under her breath, hands tightening about the steering wheel.
His shoulder twinged with the weight of the bucket as he hoisted it up from the water. Later, the ex-army doctor would blame that physical pain as the reason why he didn’t notice the shadow of darker water slowly approaching him. John felt the hand snake around his ankle and had just enough time to suck in a startled breath before inhuman strength dragged him under, the pail still clutched reflexively in the man’s grip. The water was shallow enough that John’s head struck against stone as he was put on his back, and forgetting himself the man inhaled a pained breath, only to swallow saltwater into his burning lungs. John retched and coughed, struggling to gather his bearings even through the ringing in his head. Red painted his vision, adrenaline causing his heart to pound even as the shadowy hand dragged him forward, deeper into the ocean with brutal and unforgiving force.
Sherlock was discharged from the hospital a few days after being treated for a mild concussion and drowning. During those few days, the detective regained some of his strength, and no longer felt like a kitten that had been tossed into the Thames one time too many.
His eyelids and his limbs felt heavy, as if they hadn’t been used for some time. Like dragging through wet concrete, the Dragon struggled to move. Sherlock grunted with the effort, belatedly noting that at some point he had shifted into his Human form. His eyes opened painstakingly, and as his vision focused, the sight of white walls greeted him. There was an itching in his right eye, an ache that wasn’t leaving. He pressed his ring finger to the sensation, trying to blink it away. Slowly, Sherlock sat up.
And quickly, almost too compliantly the woman gripped her Dragon's spines and heaved herself into the dip between her wings, tears trailing down her cheeks while she pressed her face against the scales beneath her, muttering apologies. John watched as the Dragon shook, its pride completely shattered when the creature wearily rose back to their feet.
and then his previous call for back-up was there, but it wasn't a medic. It was Dodge and she was pulling him away, getting other nurses to care for the man as they loaded him onto a stretcher. For a moment John fought, the roaring in his ears too loud, the sound of his heartbeat humming-
When they opened their eyes, they were no longer Citrine, and no longer Tanzanite. Well, they were and they weren’t, a strange muddling that felt new and strange and not-quite-themselves.
While it was partly true that Sherlock wanted to watch the Human eventually faint if only for a cruel sense of justice; he wasn't pinning the soldier to the wall for no reason. Though he continued up his menacing air, his head pounded steadily with a drumming pain that made him feel like he was going to throw up.
Then all hell broke loose, and Sherlock's head snapped up as he heard John let out the most unearthly sound of terror that made the hair on the back of his arms stand up, and his body leapt itself to its feet before he even realised what he was doing. He was halfway up the stairs when the cry cut off, and at the door panting and peering into the darkness when he found who he was looking for.
of an ice cube being bitten into by sharp teeth. The young man had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from
As if to demonstrate, Dodge's fingers reached out in a rare display of affection towards her Dragon, resting her hand lightly upon his shoulder. Almost immediately, Cerioth sank to his knees. Completely unhesitant. One hundred percent trusting. Rewarding him, the lieutenant ran a hand through his short dark hair.
Harry's blonde hair fought to free itself from its clips as she ran ahead of her brother, eagerly searching through the crowd for hide or hair of her friend Clara. Her lips were pursed in concentration, and she all but vibrated in spot before she spun impatiently and urged John forward.
“I need you to listen to the sound of my voice.....You don't have to respond verbally, just listen....”
For a moment, Sherlock had just stood there blinking. Unable to quite connect the fact that John had not only become
For a creature that looked like it should be effortlessly graceful, John found the Dragon could be terribly clumsy at times, not unlike a colt still trying to get control of its overly long limbs. The thought made him have to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from smiling.
John liked to imagine that his grandmother's cottage was a pirate ship. An ageless thing, it creaked arthritically when the wind blew against it, much like its owner in that respect. The young boy could hear the sea whistling in the very hardwood, and he chased after it with padded sock feet as he searched the house for buried treasure of all sizes and shapes.
Raz's quiet voice inquired softly, and John froze as his parent's fell silent for too long, the lack of voices causing his chest to constrict painfully even as he halted in his movements. For a second, all John could hear was his own breath, much too fast, much too shallow to bear.
John was very careful, making sure that Sherlock did not know of these new urges. His flatmate was already stepping about him like he was a stranger, and John truthfully just wanted them to return to their original dynamic, this strange “something else” between them not quite a reality and so awkward and clumsy in its manifestation.
“My name is Colonel Sebastian Wilkes, and you will address me as Colonel Wilkes. Easy stuff to remember, but any intentional disrespect will get you laps around the compound.”
The sexual side of things came more slowly, as expected given John’s past. Truth be told in the first couple of months, neither of them were completely sure John would ever be truly comfortable in that kind of situation. The memories from his childhood would rear up at the most unexpected things, and half the time they left scars that made John’s hands tremble and bile rise up to the back of his throat.
Sherlock carefully and precisely pointed out the noticeable leaf attached to the fruit’s stem, blue eyes meeting John’s own. “There will be many different kinds of food at my mother’s celebration, both of your world and not. As my bride to be, it’s important you don’t accidentally eat something that might harm you.”
matter? You mentally retarded or something? Crying like a brat.... Family finally decide to “lose you” in the city?”
The maid found Shyla hours later, curled up back in her bathtub. The girl's comforter was wrapped about her tightly, seemingly the only thing holding her in place. In Shyla's hands was the family photo that normally sat bolstered against her wall. The darkly-curled girl was slowly cutting it into strips, watching the photograph sink into the water around her. To the maid's distressed inquiry, Shyla merely intoned a dull and distant “Experiment.”
And the other seals responded happily, chorusing with his barking melody until a symphony played in John's ears, stunning him and filling him until all that seemed to matter was
The Dragon’s pacing slowed but did not stop, Sherlock’s wings twitching from agitated dull orange to vivid red. His eyes were slitted with frustration, voice lashing out through his thoughts like wickedly sharp knives.
And John suddenly realised Dodge might be right, that his illusion of control over Sherlock was just that, an illusion.
So this chapter is a short one but an important one. ^.^ If you want to hear the song I imagined John listening to on the radio, it's right
John almost wished the Spirit would come to the chambers, if only so that he could beg for forgiveness. He’d grovel tonight, if he had to. Hell, he’d even make all of this fucking easier and just let the Water-Spirit have him if he wanted. If it could fix this, John would deal somehow. He wasn’t sure when he started sobbing, only that it was accompanied by violence, his hands suddenly coming up to tear at the silken canopy about the bed, tearing it to pieces.
“You were made when John was a child, then. Quite young.” At Blue’s nod, Sherlock felt something click in his brain. His murmur was impossibly soft, filled with rage as he fully took in just how small John must have been when the abuse began.
And he blinked and he was suddenly pressing bandages down on a young woman's thigh, stilling bleeding that wasn't nearly as bad as Barnes' had been. He slowly became aware of his own voice, rushing reassurances even as the woman cried out into her Dragon's lap, lips bitten and white as she resisted the snarling pain. The tone of his voice made John realise he had been talking for a long while, only just now recognising the sounds he was making were platitudes.
would always hold a small amount of sentiment in Sneak's heart, because it was the place where he had his first.
Daniel folded his hands together between his knees, eyebrows lowering in consideration of the man before asking his next question. His voice was low and measured, the rhythm of a person used to waiting patiently for action to come his way. The attitude of a sniper. Like the weapon, his questions struck at surprisingly lethal places.
Breaking away from John, Shyla sat up so quickly that she very nearly overbalanced, arms spreading out on either side of her before her gangly legs caught up. Like a cat targeting a mouse, the detective was now determined, a set goal in mind. Whirling upon John, she crushed her lips to her companion’s own, a manic kind of energy filling her as breathlessly she murmured “Give me an hour.” Before tearing off down towards her room, leaving behind a rather confused, and terribly turned on, John Watson. The army doctor listened to the thrum of his own heartbeat, feeling as exhilarated as he did when he was after the detective for chasing down seasoned killers.
John could, he found. Maybe he was just dizzy. Maybe it was something else, but Sherlock's voice had changed in his ears. It now held in it a power he couldn't identify, something heavy and comforting and thrumming and whole. It cradled John, made him feel instantly okay, despite the fact that he was disoriented and afraid. He wanted to go home, but he also could not imagine moving. Not when Sherlock pressed his lips gently to the boy's forehead, murmuring soft orders into the shell of his ear.
“You have something that is making you the target of several dangerous individuals.” Sherlock cut in then, apparently finding his voice. Irene’s smile wavered, and she back off a bit to go and take a seat in a dark leather chair. She crossed her arms over herself with practiced ease, putting on a business-like mask that made John wonder if she had planned to catch their interest from the start.
The soldier woke crying wordlessly out into the dark of his bedsit, jackknifing into sitting, clutching at his shoulder and clawing at the heat that burned him. It pulsed, alive and angry. John had barely enough time to realise that he was in a cold sweat before nausea washed over him and left his body trembling, and he lurched to his feet. He barely made it to the toilet before bile rose up in the back of his throat, and he found the sink in the end to spit into. It was heaving, gripping the sink white-knuckled, that John opened his eyes and saw his hands, his skin. He jerked backwards, staring in the mirror, letting out a shout before his hand came to clap over his mouth, stopping the instinctive shriek.
. What came from the gun was not a bullet, but an explosion of light that seemed to surge not from the weapon, but from John’s chest through his hands and into the metal. It shot as a beacon of light, brilliant as a star before it hit the Gem squarely in the chest. She barely had time to turn, knocked to the ground with the force of John’s power. There was a moment of silence as the Gem buckled under the force of it, shoved several feet back before howling in agony, corporeal for only an instant longer before abruptly erupting in a cloud of dust. The Gem lay in the long grass in the ensuing silence, until Sherlock finally broke the frigid atmosphere by stepping forward, reaching out to touch the polished stone. In his hands, John watched as a bubble formed about the Gem, sealing it effectively even as the detective straightened to face the Met inquiringly.
Beta is still in need of a break because of school work (plus she's editing a crap-tonne of other things at the moment) so please don't hesitate to point anything major out to me! ^_^ I will also be shifting the tags slightly, as I feel like I should probably add some tags to come...
She looked not unlike a Dragon herself, smoke leaving her lips in rings and trails before curling outside. The end of her light was a bright ember, red-orange and brilliant like magma. Cerioth looked at it instead of her eyes as he spoke, his tone carefully deferential and distant.
The cool length of one pointer finger traced the outline of the bruise on his face, and a voice as rich and unreadable as fog smoke from lips that were as strange as they were beautiful.
Sebastian’s smile seemed to only grow, and he cut off to cut an appraising look at John. His voice held in it a smirk as those brown eyes squinted slightly, picking out the soldier’s plain jumpers and unassuming manner.
His thoughts break off again as this time Mycroft's phone rings, humming in his pocket. His elder brother rolls his eyes and reaches into his pants, pulling out the phone and looking at faint surprise at the number. When he picked up, his voice was even.
After this we're back in London, my friends. It's been a ride and it will flip back and forth to other characters who are still very much in the thick of things, but. John and Sherlock now have a bit of a break? In theory :P
he might not be real. Does not look at him and see a freak, like his therapist did. Like people looked at him when they found out.
“You live here, don’t you?” John murmured, his hand trembling minutely. When he smiled, it held only the faintest trace of bitterness.
him, taking in the motley crew of creatures that now, free of their Human shells, stood crouching or hovering above their Master's and Mistresses', awaiting orders patiently. Like dolls. Terrifying, beautifully ornate dolls.
Humming, Sherlock’s voice dropped an octave even as he eyed the strawberries with hungry contemplation.
There was the unmistakable sound of waves lapping closer and closer, the tide coming in, stretching itself and making its way towards the cove. In a few hours, it would be submerged beneath the waves. The small rock-pool that John now stood by was testimony to that. The problem was, and it became more apparent as John's haze of anger and fear turned to sand in his mouth, that leaving Sherlock there on the sand, in a definitely
Because of all of the roaring, all of the smoke and all of the terrible beating of wings, John expected a hulking
to hear such a thing, or at least have gone quiet. Sherlock however appeared to do neither, grunting in affirmation and rising to his feet to pace the length of the kitchen in agitation.
Sherlock had been eighteen when against his mother's wishes, he had stopped trying to act like Shyla Holmes. It was the eve of which he found himself following his brother's footsteps and going to Eton, despite the fact that Sherlock at the time had not cared much for the idea of higher education. Truthfully he still didn't. But there had been a rather satisfying feeling of looking at his own personal documents, seeing for once
“He wasn’t the nicest of men, no. Although he was never physically abusive, he enjoyed being manipulative and often did not understand my… energy. Often he’d take away my experiments, my stimuli as punishment for some slight, claiming it would “improve my concentration” on other, more important matters. I would find myself bored out of my mind, with no way to express it safely. Often, I set fire to things just to ease the
“It must have been hard.” John murmured despite himself, imagining it almost against his will. Rania looked young now- but she would have been even younger at the time of her parent’s deaths. A small child, locked in a library with ancient textbooks and men that were possibly even older advising her on the “right” thing to do. It seemed like an impossible burden to place on a child, and the soldier cleared his throat before admitting “I wouldn’t have been able to do it, that’s for sure.” Rania took the sympathy well, chin lifting in the tiniest admittance of pride. Her voice took on the barest hint of flint.
The Human flinched away from his spidery and hesitant touch, mindlessly lashed out at him before seeming to realise who it was. Upon seeing Sherlock anguish crossed his blue eyes, and he pressed himself automatically against the Spirit’s leg, pressing his face against his thigh and begging numb forgiveness that tasted like ash on John’s tongue.
“Chemistry.” Sherlock murmured, ignoring the insidious whisper inside of his own mind. It wasn’t his Father’s fault, he didn’t know. It still didn’t stop the twisting feeling inside of his stomach.
Sherlock did not move. He stood half-turned, eyes strangely owlish as he blinked at John in what could probably be described as blank apprehension. His voice was decidedly cautious as he glanced down at the soldier's hands which did not tremble, as well as his leg that did not shake. Battle-ready.
John swallowed slowly, jaw clicking as he rose. He heard the Selkie let out a nearly imperceptible whine at his movement, a pale arm reaching out as if to drag the man back to his side. John ignored the action, although the childishness of it made something pitying twist in his chest at the sight. He moved from the bathroom with a determined tilt to his strides, the likes of which Sherlock watched through muzzy thoughts and fever-ridden agony.
“Still can't bring yourself to use my phone? I mean, finding these places has to be a waste of someone's time.”
With the introduction of the mysterious shadow that was Moriarty hitting the news, causing chaos and making the city of London shift in unease, Sherlock became increasingly restless. John woke to experiments left undone, with no real order to their nature or an end-goal except it seemed to make a mess in their shared living room. He also woke to his detective either lost in malaise or caught up in a manic energy in turn.
He was at times, deathly quiet. He slunk about John with a skittish sort of grace, just at the corner of the soldier's eyes. Incredibly agile and flexible, John sometimes found the Dragon went ridiculous lengths to avoid being in his direct line of sight, a common sulking place being atop the refrigerator, where the Dragon's impossibly long tail would curl and uncurl about the cool handle.
It wasn’t until the case that would later become The Blind Banker that things came to a head, and when they did they seemed to do so explosively. John knew little of Sherlock’s past, but he did know that the Gem seemed to have very few non-human friends besides John himself. Sherlock didn’t seem interested in other Gems, he barely at times seemed interested in humans, save for when he was in the midst of The Work. Often, John wondered if Sherlock had been part of the war at all- or if he had been made in the sparse few years that Britain had been at tentative peace with Gemkind.
Time seemed to slow, become as sluggish as honey dripping from a spoon. John's eyelids felt heavy, and yet he had never been more awake. Vaguely, he realised he was rising to his feet, stumbling forward. Pain stopped him only briefly, the ragged state of his hands protesting at the tightening of his fists. The blood dripped upon the sand, and the figure's head turned towards him.
Except Sneak's hands were suddenly at the buttons of his shirt, and like sunlight shattering an illusion, the detective pushed him gently away. Sherlock's eyes were pained, and he was panting softly, cheeks flushed scarlet. His gaze was unwavering, but it held in it only sorrow. Struggling to explain, scattered as his Mind-Palace struggled to come back online. To phrase things properly.
His voice was small, as if he was afraid that if he said the wrong thing, the offer might be taken away.
John tied the creature to the guest bed that Harry used to sleep in, its frame just small enough that he could tie the Selkie's ankles to the bed posts without straining the rest of the creature's limbs.
in interest at the new name. Sneak suddenly cooled in his tongue, eyes growing slightly distant and dreamy again as he sat cross-legged on the couch.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, because little more seemed able to be said. John smiled at him, a dopey, hazy approximation of a grin that showed he was still drugged half out of his mind. Sherlock tried not to panic when John’s eyes slipped closed again, lost to the world of sleep. It would take time, as Mycroft said. Still, the Dragon’s heart stuttered in his chest, a drum.
“Do you hear that?” John whispered, and turned reluctantly when Mike made a small confused sound in the back of his throat. The blonde boy felt as if eyes were glued to the back of his neck, burning him. Claiming.
The hands about his throat were as immovable as they were strong, and they did not hesitate to wrap around his wind-pipe even as John's knee came sharply upwards to make an aim for the detective's groin. A second too late Sherlock
The Water-Spirit knew from the beginning that to do this in many ways, was an act of self-satisfaction. Sherlock had never dealt well with the unknown, and John was in many ways a massive variable that he found himself pulled towards, again and again like a magnet.
“I guess so.” John shrugged. He scratched the back of his head, thinking. “But I’d also like someone who knows how
Apparently this Sherlock bloke was in a spot of trouble then. Not that Daniel particularly cares. It's not his job to go about protecting strangers. His only purpose was to defend himself and his comrades in arms. It was the reason he was born, blinking his eyes open for the first time and tasting his world of hot desert and flying shrapnel. He knew the feel of a gun in his hands before he even became aware of how a book spine could be cradled in his fingers. He thrived on the taste of fear as he stitched his friends back together, protecting them from further injury with his own body. He knew the mourning of when you had to use the dead as sandbags to keep from being shot to death alone in the sanded dunes.
“At ease, soldier.” Morstan murmured, blue eyes kind and warm as they swept over John. Her voice seemed so soft, but John knew that if pushed, it could rise to overtake even the most bullheaded, belligerent rookie. Now though, it was filled with care that felt genuine, and the young man as exhausted as he was felt temptation to lean into it.
“How?” Dodge interrupted smoothly, dark brow rising. Her face was stormy as she pointed to John's empty hands, their tension.
But Dodge wasn't excusing her actions. Rather, she seem unconcerned as to whether or not John judged her, letting him draw his own opinions and conclusions from the facts and facts alone.
John smiled, and it was a comforting, warm thing. He clicked the kettle off, leaving it for later. John could have tea at any time wished. This, however was something he'd likely not see everyday. From his pocket he drew a yellow wristband, made of silicone. The letters printed upon it were Sherlock's ticket to being allowed to fly in London, and as John stepped forward to slip the band on the creature's wrist, he read the words out for him.
With a snarl he dispelled the thought, refusing it continuation into something more even as he sat up, swaying slightly as the blood rushed quickly back into his extremities. His head pounded weakly, but he ignored its pleas even as he forced himself onto his feet, pacing in an agitated circle on the smooth hardwood floor. It was a disjointed oval, made crooked by as much his own weakness as his irritation.
Sherlock slowly sat up, finally giving his brother the attention he deserved. From the new position Mycroft could see just how haggard his brother appeared, tired despite his very recent feeding. There were dark circles under Sherlock’s eyes, and a minute trembling in his limbs: an addict suffering through withdrawal. His voice was hoarse, spitting out verbal abuse even as he demanded a straight answer.
in defence. Her teeth had become angular and pointed in rage, and her wings billowed behind her in great big
“You'll behave yourself and like it or we'll both be castrated. Dodge isn't someone to fuck around with, she means business. I'm not going to abandon you, so you're stuck with me and you'll have to tough it out. If she thinks for even a second that I'm not serious about looking after you and fighting in the war she'll have me sent home and you'll be sent...”
The question came from John's mouth automatically, and his hands tightened into fists on his knees even as he neutrally flicked his gaze to the floor. He had no idea who this “Molly” was, and it wouldn't surprise him to know that she was also instructed to “watch him” should he be rude or harbour plans of escape. Already his thoughts were humming with ideas for evacuation, and vaguely he wondered if the bolt about his leg was magically enforced. If it was just a simple lock pick, he might stand a chance.
“Tell me human, how is it that you came to find him? Did you hunt him? Take his coat? If you did I assure you, you will not live to see another sunrise. The night comes quickly here, and when it does, I won’t hesitate to drag you down the beach and throw you to the rocks.” He said the last bit almost pleasantly, a sharp grin lighting up his features. It was like a sharpened weapon. “Were you hoping to sell his coat for a sum? I assure you, it’s not worth your while.”
But even that, the Water-Spirit felt he was pushing for the best. An ideal as opposed to practicality. Chances were after tonight the mortal would wish nothing to do with him.
The width of Sebastian's smile flickered, but before it could fade, the man was already turning away. Feigning carelessness. John tried not to flinch as Sebastian presented his back to Rin,
John sat in the middle of the living room, sprawled rather unceremoniously in Sherlock's chair. It was such a un-John-like posture, that the detective had to blink to make sure what he was seeing was correct. The man lay so that his legs
Crimson eyes glittered as they looked upward; Moriarty’s power glowed from within even as he lifted his head from where it had been tucked against the human’s neck. The man - a soldier with sandy-silver hair - let out an unintelligible sob in his sleep, unconsciously trying to twist away from the punishing grip James had of his hair. Sherlock took into account the man’s face, eyes closed but expressive in his agony, obviously in the throes of a night terror. Beside him on the ground, a sprig of an ash tree lay snapped in half. Sherlock resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the sight of it. The Fae knew much about Demons, but sometimes their information was quite simply out of date. No Demon had feared ash since almost before mankind’s walk on Earth, not since the Faeries had lost much of their magical abilities due to human’s meddling with nature and the development of iron.
. Everything was suddenly too hot, too cloying for Claude to handle. She felt John stir inside and sucked breath through her teeth, attempting to stay calm. She had
I haven't updated in so long~~~ ah summer, how lazy you maketh me~~ also I've been in Canada for a while ^_^
It floated in front of him, virtually like the swell of the tide. John found he wasn't able to refuse responding, his name coming to his lips before he was even fully aware the sounds had formed.
And yet John couldn't escape the shivering in his body, and he clutched his arms about his middle, as if seeking comfort from something unknown. His thoughts were filled with sarcasm, heavy and contrite.
What was the most surprising, however, was that upon being sure that he had John’s attention the Selkie opened his mouth, and spoke.
“What is it?” The woman snapped, obviously annoyed and now second-guessing her decision of letting John take the Northern Dragon with him. Her Dragon didn't react to the sharp tone, but he flinched physically as the creature in the back snarled something acerbic and in distinct Dragon-Tongue in his direction. The servant addressed the wild Dragon in the back with elegant courtesy and a surprising amount of respect, given the fact that John was fairly certain the beast was foaming at the mouth it was so infuriated. In fact it was so respectful that he wondered if perhaps Cerioth wasn't being just a bit mocking in his tone. Though if he was it was well disguised.
He laughed then. It was a dry, raspy chuckle, the kind that made his shoulder twinge. He didn't realise his fingers traced the silver-purple ring of puckered flesh on the inside of his wrist when he finally met her gaze. His eyes were a deep, bitterly amused blue. His scarred wrist flexed even as his fingers tightened over the handle of his cane.
His voice spills harshly out of his chest, echoing across the room. An animalistic snarl that is edged in a borderline madness and driven determination.
For a moment, the Selkie didn’t reply, and John thought to himself that he had managed to ruin the moment after all. Yet after a second of thought, a humming sound filled the air, and John found himself smiling in surprised delight as the lyrics of the song were something recognisable. It seemed as if Sherlock did listen to the radio songs, he sometimes turned on, even if he acted as if they were distasteful.
with their needs?” His icy tone caused the elder brother to sigh and pinch the bridge of his nose. The older sibling's reply held the thin patience of an adult that had been pushed by a bratty child for just a hair longer than was recommended, and his voice crackled dangerously as he spoke.
It was without thinking that he shifted back to his more comfortable, doctorly form, the glow of his Gem receding and the weapon in his hand fading away to nothing. It was distractedly he noticed his own breathing had elevated, turning harsh against his lips and fogging outwards. From a distant point of view, John was somewhat aware that the sound of his own pulse rushing in his ears wasn’t normal, and that the look that Sherlock was now giving him even as he faded back to the detective everyone knew was concern masked by indifference. A panic attack, but over what John wasn’t quite sure. He’d had them before, especially during the first few weeks trapped in his bedsit. Yet this wasn’t the fear left over from a nightmare, this was a rush of seeing realisation that what he was habitually denying couldn’t be ignored. It was the prickling feeling of eyes upon him, friends turned to strangers in their wide-eyed stares.
He hoped that this holiday would be fun, and at the very least if it wasn't there was still the fact that his Grandma's cottage was perched right next to the beach.
However Sherlock stopped as a warm, cooking scent wafted past, causing him to pause in disbelief. It smelled like… well it smelled like
good, she didn't want to upset Mr. Holmes, but she didn't want to talk any more. The conflicting feelings must have been
This meant that he wasn’t entirely feeling charitable when a woman in a suit arrived at his office door with clearance he wasn’t even entirely certain he was supposed to
It was raining the night that he had been called in for a drugs bust that would introduce him to Sherlock Holmes. It would be a night that Lestrade wouldn’t easily forget, if only because it was December and he had been called in over his supposed Christmas holidays to handle the case. It would be the beginning of a chink between the bond he shared with his wife. Lestrade had stood outside the abandoned building with his hands deep in his pockets and his back braced against the chill droplets of rain, his coat doing little to shelter him from the downpour. The blue lights of his police car had been smeared beacons in the darkness, alighting the faces of his team as they prepared to barge their way into the string of flats before them.
The man that greeted Sherlock was unfamiliar, but by far not the worst-case scenario. Worst-case would be an enemy, and though Sherlock was not yet certain as to the intentions of this man, there was the possibility that said intentions were not negative.
He was woken rather abruptly, and it took John a moment to recognise the sound that had jostled him awake. It was a thumping noise, sharp and loud in the house, and it had roused him at nearly three o’clock in the afternoon.
It was why a moment later, the ex-army doctor tightened his hold on Sherlock’s hand, leaning upwards to kiss the underside of Sherlock’s jaw. His voice was rough with emotion, something that would likely make the man even more uncomfortable. John couldn’t really bring himself to care.
with it you fat fool! All of this building up to what you want to say to me and you can’t even tell that my head is
It was a promise, and one John didn’t completely understand. Still, the Chinese Dragon would say no more on the topic, and only continued to chatter away about the things he had seen and the places he’d travelled.
” The last part, mumbled into John's neck, was thick with heavy emotion. John, feeling a quiet rage build in him, rolled over to clutch Sherlock to him, allowing the man's black and red-streaked wings to spread, curl about them protectively. In the darkness, Sherlock trembled, warm but afraid against John. So very afraid. The doctor wondered, who could have hurt someone, been so
She then turned to her grandson and his new-found friend, a smile plastered on the old woman's lips. Harry looked away from it, eating the last spoonful of her eggs.
There was a moment in which all songs, all sound seemed to cut off, and both Selkie and man looked at each other, one with eyes filled with shock, the other with eyes filled with fear. John knelt in the sand inches from the water, hands gripping the grains tightly in his palms even as his entire body leant forward, bones seeming intent of bending and breaking their way towards the moonlit figure haloed in the water.
John smiled, aiming for lightness. Not many soldiers had really broken from their self-imposed shells as of yet, but with Benson's warmth he could sense people slowly relaxing, finding the elusive mannerisms required for social work. A woman looking to be in her early thirties patted John on the back in a friendly greeting. Her accent was decidedly American, dark freckles were smattered across her coffee-coloured cheeks and her brown eyes sparked with a fire brighter than her Dragon's scales.
John sat down stiffly to a veritable feast laid out before him, the likes of which was both colourful and somewhat unrecognisable. His eyes roved over the selection displayed, pastries that he did not know and meats that looked like they came from far away lands from strange animals. There was a tea that smelled a bit like the one Harriet would drink in the morning, and a wine that when Sherlock handed it to him from a silver goblet tasted like cinnamon and something spicier.
It is more of an order than a request. Needless to say, John didn't argue. Instead he kept quiet, mentally cataloguing what exactly he'd need to pack.
John tried to block out the voices, but they came at a faster rate, clawing at his thoughts and drinking from them greedily like leeches searching for blood. They tore at him, and if possible, he cried harder. Normally John wasn't afraid of anything, could smile cheerfully even during events that would make most small boys howl for their mothers. He rode the Waltzer at the fair with grace, finished his maths test early despite the multiplication questions, and didn't cry even when he had scraped his knee while chasing after Jerry Bates at school and tripped. Now however he couldn't seem to stop, and John knew it was because he thought he might truly die here, alone and cold and wet.
Then the mighty beast seemed to deflate, the fight draining out of his limbs as the weight of his own words hung heavily on him. His storm-blue eyes cooled to an ashen grey as his body instinctively tried to curl in on itself, his body crouching once more into a defensive ball as his wings hid the pain behind his false indifference. The old woman didn't know that she'd hit the exact nerve that Sherlock has been striking himself all day, the sensation raw and painful as he clutched at his wrists which bled sluggishly now and contemplated hiding back behind the sofa. He was surprised when after a beat of breath, the woman's soft voice called him from the barrier of his wings. He could make out the outline of her, curled hair and purple dress and arthritic hands. Soft edges and a hidden smile.
Greg had gone still, so still that Mycroft wondered if he’d been the one to turn to stone. The Dragon stared at him, the slits of his gold-red eyes wide. Scared but defiant, Mycroft slowly raised his chin. He forced the fear down, until the colour of his scales dulled to wintery blue, until he felt as if he’d constructed a wall of ice around his heart. Inside he was cold and terrified, but outside he kept his voice calm.
“You know nothing about us, our needs and our wants. How could you possibly think you could keep him like this? A pet or an experiment. Nothing more to you. And for him, you are… a relic of the past. A childhood curiosity that forced my brother to give up
“Prince Mycroft, is it? We’re all delighted to meet you.” Mycroft found a hand being stretched in greeting towards him, the boy that owned it wearing a toothy smile. His hair was dark, as were his eyes, and it caught and offset the gold and red of his clothes nicely. The gold sash that went from his shoulder to hip had a Dragon on it rearing back on its hind legs. It spat fire, leaving no question to who it was that was greeting him. “Lord Gregarian Lestrade the second. But please, call me Greg. The first name’s my father’s.”
, and John realised he was pressing much too hard on the wound, that his panic was making things worse. Swearing, John decided he couldn't wait to let Sherlock finish his plea. He had to act
“You’re going to regret doing that, Sherlock my dear,” he enunciated carefully, the sound little more than a hiss of pain. In response, “Sherlock” seemed to only smirk, his pale hand tightening on the thrumming organ in his grip. Though John couldn’t see the monster’s full expression, hidden as he was behind the other Demon, he could see the creature’s wings. Blood red graduating to deepest black, they were large enough to block out even the moonlight. Ice-blue eyes glinted, cold and monstrous.
, remember?!” They had agreed on it together, shortly after the Pool event, before Irene Adler and her mess (which was another story all on its own). “We agreed on a code word so we wouldn't keep on trying to sacrifice ourselves to save one another, but I can't
It was decided that as soon as the detective could stand, John would be dragging him outside for some mandatory fresh air. If he didn’t, the army doctor rather feared for the state of Mrs Hudson’s walls.
off with a rumbling that he felt from the base of his spine to the tips of his toes. It was a terrible noise, gut-wrenching and distinctly predatory, the kind that made a man's hair stand on end and his knees tremble. At least it would have, if John hadn't grown
“Embarrassed?” John echoed sceptically, and the DI nodded at him in affirmation even as Greg elaborated.
The Dragon’s hands tightened at his sides, feeling the weight of mixed feelings creep over him. Dodge had never exactly been a friend, not like John or Molly or Mike or even Xavi. Yet Sherlock didn’t think she deserved the loneliness that could set into a person in Afghanistan, on a compound without someone to trust or depend on. He grit his teeth, momentarily cursing the stubbornness of Humans before Mycroft quietly took his leave.
Mike eventually picked one out. A Yellow Card English. However from what John saw of her as Mike coaxed her out of her Kennel, she acted more like a White Card. Her name was Meriath, but his friend as he stroked her long red-brown hair seemed to have already given her a nickname.
Most of the time though it was enough just to touch the scars. Remember how far he'd worked himself to get to the point where most of the time, he was comfortable.
“Past… I am the past, Mister Holmes.” She corrected, and with the correction came a small nod, like she was reassuring herself. Sherlock felt something twist in him then, a peculiar kind of shuddering. His voice was soft, but driven to discover what it was that John was hiding hidden in layer upon layer of soft wool and fastidious smiles. Though a part of him was aware that the army doctor would rather he not know.
And the strange, eclectic roomate beamed at him, and for once in his life, the young man didn't quite know what to say. Because no one had thought him
*Whispers into the void* I am  S O   S O R R Y this took so long. *rolls into the void with all of my writing drafts in tow*
“Let me make this perfectly clear: Though the discipline of your Dragon is your duty, you must be made aware that others are allowed to give your Dragon orders if you are considered incapable of doing so. This is a unit, we are an army, but more than that, we're a brotherhood. A bonded group. I will not have fighting within our own troops, so any petty arguments you have-” Her gaze flicked to both Bill and Wilkes meaningfully “Are to be disregarded and forgiven, at least for the extent of your posting here. If I catch any physical confrontations during the times I do inspections, you will be suffering more from just laps around the compound. You are all grown adults, and should know how to treat each other with respect by now. You've made it this far as Wilkes has said, it means you must be good for something.”
could hear it, pounding away in their hearts as adrenaline. He couldn't make out much in terms of distinct shapes, but he could hear scales and skin shifting in the dark. Coiling, tightening for action. Predator's taking in prey that had somehow come out on top in the food chain. Enemies, expected to be treated as Masters.
or attack, a low growl rumbling in her chest as smoke drifted from between her gritted teeth. A soft, unfamiliar voice drifted to her, Human-Speak slow and deliberate, firm in its question. It took her a moment, but she understood what
Two, whoever had helped him was also completely sure that Sherlock would not attack him if given the chance (a foolish notion and one the Dragon bared his teeth at in derision).
The army doctor wasn't surprised when a moment later, Sherlock's head ducked down to his chest, and a shaking took his partner that made the bed tremble. John's hands were steadying forces as they stroked Sherlock's shoulder's, his own tears making it hard to see.
Sherlock listened with a sort of detached amusement as his betrothed cursed loudly enough to wake most of the street, shouts only breaking way to make room for sobs that didn't sound so much sad as hopelessly,
We're going to miss the festivities!” Harry squealed from the other side of the teen's bedroom door, pounding on its wooden surface impatiently as she struggled not to trip in the silken skirts of her elaborate dress. She danced in place, struggling with her hair ribbons self-consciously while hassling her brother to get moving.
The lanky man's eyes narrowed dangerously, and he enunciated his words as if he were speaking to a child.
Sherlock was nowhere to be found, his bedside cold, though John could not remember when in the night he had left. Molly offered no explanation to her Lord’s absence, and John didn’t ask. He was determined after his dream especially, not to show interest.
Sherlock had expected this really. Sebastian had been bitter for years over their less-than-perfect fallout, ever since Sherlock had ruined his string of affairs with various women by harshly deducing him in front of the entire cafeteria at Uni. Not that they had exactly gotten along to begin with, but that had kind of been the final blow on a long list of offenses.
“That's enough,” John repeated, softer now that the Selkie no longer seemed intent on tearing the bed from its frame.
Then his father came home late at night, waking the whole household with his stumbling, heavy footsteps. Then his mum began shouting.
He merely looked at the egg, refused to let it go. Refused to get up. He stared at the egg, and sometimes John... but mostly, he stared as if his thoughts were far away.
In all seriousness though, the next chapter will mark the end of John and Sherlock's war days, as well as a turn more towards the canon show. To get there though, I'm afraid some violence must occur ^_^
Wilkes wore an expression of almost boredom on his face, and his tone was dry even as he held down the button to the silver remote and watched in faint interest as his Dragon writhed and whined through his clenched teeth.
A few growled their assent, holding syringes in their hands and pressing them to the crooks of their elbows and the backs of their knees. At the name '
“I know.” Dodge said simply. It was such an easy admission that for a moment the young soldier paused, blinking in confusion and surprise. John scrambled to find some flaw in the statement, but his rage was quickly melting away in exasperation and befuddlement. He
The Book was hidden under his mattress, a dangerous window to an entire world that John had before only scratched the surface of. Like an addictive drug, he found that late at night his tired eyelids would peel themselves awake, forcing himself to read just one more chapter, just one more paragraph, just one more line. The very
Rising to his knees, John made as if to get to his feet, only to feel a sharp tug along one of his ankles. His eyes landed on the silver chain circling his heel, and his mouth fell dry even as his heart began to pound. It was just long enough to encircle him in glittering mockery, pooling to the floor only to be wrapped tightly about the foot of the bed. Gaze flitting wildly about, he took in the room before him, feeling as though he were trapped inside a polished, beautified hell.
But Sherlock turned without another word, leaping off the cloud and caught by another, hidden from view as it sailed impossibly fast towards the Banish Lands. Mycroft sighed at the retreating figure, shaking his head. His ice-blue eyes flared in thought as he looked down at the beaten up village, already prepared for the festivities. The sun was sinking low in the horizon like a great, blinking eye, but no one was sleeping below. The God could taste the excitement in the air, radiating in the streamers that hung from every house, in the colourful robes of children running in the dirt streets, giggling and clutching treats and sweetmeats in their fingers.
Blue didn't speak, blue eyes cast to the floor. She shifted nervously, an animal caught in a trap to which their was to escape. Like a wild animal, her gaze didn't settle for too long on anything exactly. She spoke quickly, quietly. Her voice was articulate but not particularly commanding. World's different from John's subtle tone of leadership.
Albert for his part sounded almost sheepish, a laugh that was callous and cruel uttering from his lips as he said ruefully “S'pose that's fair n' all. Still I wonder, Holmes. You said we must be bored of this, and that in't a lie... but the way you said it implied we're missun' something of interest.”
The Dragon immediately lunged upon the dessert viciously, swiping the plate so that the cake was jealously guarded by the great expanse of his wings and tail, tucked against his chest.
It wasn’t until John managed to wriggle free an arm, grab Sherlock’s chin and force the Dragon to look at him that John realised that Sherlock’s gaze was hurt, looking at John reproachfully as if he were some stranger, something lost and precious. John didn’t understand, not until the Dragon plaintively repeated “You let him touch you. But you’re mine.” It was then that the soldier realised that it was less something to do with a Dragon’s nature, and more to do with Sherlock’s own emotions. John privately suspected that it was as foreign to his friend as it was to John himself.
The fire Dragon he had been treating before the actual battle had vanished. His Mistress came to the tent, all but hyperventilating as she realised he had been lost in the chaos of battle. None of Andy's condolences seemed to assuage her, and John had listened from the edge of the tent as the women had torn a strip into the medical captain, snarling at him more harshly than a Dragon herself as she'd berated him. Sherlock to his credit remained silent, even when John flinched at the sound of two voices rising. It was too much like the fighting he had heard when he had been back home, and the young soldier soon fled, feeling as if his nerves were made of taught elastics drawn too far.
The detective huffed, rolling onto her side. She curled herself inwards, as if to make her figure as small as possible. It was all so ridiculous, these
“Was there for a while, base got taken down though. Too dangerous now. Though it makes sense why you wouldn't know, information's always hard to travel 'round these parts.”
Sherlock paced in his tent, the unaccounted for fluttering of nerves in his stomach both unwelcome and strange. It twisted inside of him, leaving him feeling both nauseated and off-balance. He couldn’t seem to make himself sit still, not without being completely sure of John’s safety, his instincts running unusually high.
“I don’t… Do I know you?” John tentatively asked, feeling like he should be polite even if he had no real idea what was going on. The woman before him seemed to radiate a kind of aura, a feeling of power, and it wouldn’t have surprised him if her wrath was something formidable to behold. As it was, he kept an inch of distance between him and her, wary of drawing too near. She smiled down at him, her lips a purple so deep they were nearly blue.
She said this with such conviction that John was for a moment brought short, his mouth left hanging open with unspoken objections rendered moot. Until that point, John wasn’t totally sure Dodge even liked him, and yet here she was recommending his services? What was more, what was a simple lieutenant
Deciding he had won this round, John acquiesced (if wholly unhappily) to taking a seat. It felt odd, to see Mycroft in this sort of public space. There was something nearly blasphemous about the action, and in truth John wondered what could be so important that the elder Holmes would make the trek into a public park to find him.
“I know you don't know me very well, and I can hardly claim to know you. But you need to understand something about me, and I need to set some things straight. I will
recognised him and called out his name. The army doctor's smile was about as forced as if it was being birthed, and his eyes were pained as with false politeness he responded to his childhood friend's greeting.
either. His instincts were beginning to take over, and they demanded that he view any protection as good protection.
” The sharp, rolling click on the “K” caused John to flinch minutely, but Sherlock barely noticed. His gaze was slitted in hatred. Fear rarely seen. “Our kind were hunted...
Blinking somewhat dazedly, he was surprised then when John's hands a moment later gently tugged his wrists, pulling Sherlock to kneel even as the army doctor crouched before him, having him lean once more against the wall even as the detective struggled to catch his breath. There was a certain grace to the movement, the detective thought, as if John were quite suddenly not so solid, something more ephemeral and vague. Yet that could be because of the state of his breathing, a harsh marching count, quick-time. Lack of oxygen in the brain.
John smiled upon as he turned and saw him, a hopelessly bright, toothy thing, and part of the detective melted just a little. He pretended it wasn’t the case, eyes narrowing in deductive reasoning. John was already dressed, and rather nicely at that. A clean, dark blue button-down and dark blue jeans offset the colour of his eyes, and his hair was combed (used the product Sherlock bought him in it, the scent was familiar and pleasing to the detective’s nose).
When John could speak again, he clutched at his side and grinned. It was a sickly thing, filled with shame and guilt.
“John Watson is a kind, loyal mask put together to keep the rest of his memories under lock and key. He, and all of his other Alters are coping mechanisms, and not real people. Tell me Sherlock, you pretend to know your friend, but are you really so blind as to not see that perhaps John was nudged into living with you, that his other personalities had some ulterior motives to know your every move? To get
He felt the pressure of bones creaking under his foot, his blow landing solidly. The creature’s grip momentarily loosened, a surprised bubble of air escaping the Selkie’s chest, and it was just enough that John could tear himself away, ankle trailing blood into the water that burned scarlet before dissolving into the water. Ignoring the pain and moving as fast as he was able to in the water, the ex-army doctor kicked frantically towards the surface, his head breaking water. John gulped frantic mouthfuls of air, realising blearily with a sinking feeling in his chest that he had been dragged several feet away from the shore into the deeper water. His feet couldn’t touch the rocky floor, and every breath was agony and a blessing to his burning lungs.
Still sad but reluctantly brightening a little, the girl crawls out from under the table, using John's memory to find the jar of biscuits on the top shelf, carefully avoiding the fridge lest she find some horror like frozen fingers or limbs. She sticks a jammy dodger in her mouth happily and begins her lithe journey back to John's room, making sure to check one more time to ensure that Mr. Holmes was still safely asleep and bared no threat. Nodding slightly at the sight of his eyes still being closed, Claude moved silently up the steps, oblivious to the crumbs that she left behind on the floor of the kitchen and living room that would have Sherlock Holmes wondering why flatmate had felt
You need to feed; without a life source you shall wither away and become little more than a shade. As it is you are far too thin, and considering that it’s
"So long! I mean you were merely a boy when I last saw you! And your grandma, bless her soul, was always going on about what a saint you were! I mean you were a little devil back then, too, at times, sneaking into my flour when I wasn't looking, but you were always so sweet about cleaning it up." She beamed up at him, the lines of her face gentle and inviting. Mike smiled behind her, noticing John slowly easing into the conversation. He quietly left to give the two time to catch up.
“Someone's got an attitude don't they?” John murmured, but got to work quickly. Once again faced with the sluggishly bleeding infection, the soldier found himself thinking that he had gotten to it just in time. It looked slightly red and inflamed, and John figured a bath would be in order again tonight before the two of them went to bed. Trying
The “little” layer of cake was topped with what smelled like rich vanilla icing, swirling in wave-like patterns to meet bright red strawberries glistening on top. It was the biggest dessert Sherlock had ever laid eyes on let alone eaten, and its smell was positively scrumptuous from five feet away where he was standing. He must have not looked quite as distant as he had wanted to, because John grinned like he had just won some kind of prize as he knelt and placed the dish upon the floor, pushing it across the tile until it rested at Sherlock's feet. All of a sudden, the Dragon realized just how strange this entire situation was. Someone treating him like he was something to be cared for, someone to ask about. Someone worth feeding, despite the fact he hadn't earned his keep in the slightest. It was like everything in his universe that had made sense had been turned on its ear, like a glass kettle smashed to pieces against a brick wall. And he couldn't reconcile it in his head, not without feeling his skin itch and his eyes burn strangely as he looked at the cake before him, given to him without a second thought.
John chose not to comment on how Sherlock's cold tail twisted itself possessively about his wrist. Soo Lin's smile was gracious as much as it was relieved.
As it turned out, Sherlock had not predicted the fact that being an art student, his roomate had an eye for figure. “Something in the shape of your hips told me. Not to mention that you're downright lazy in where you leave your binders.” He had admitted. After that, Sherlock was careful to walk differently, with a slightly wider gait.
“I don’t know who you’re talking about.” John stated, feeling a strange anger build within him from somewhere unknown. It was as if there was a blockage, a sliding of knowledge in his mind that made him unable to pinpoint where the anger stemmed from. Still it coursed through him, making him lift his chin defiantly and stand his ground. “I don’t know where I am or who you are,
As they sat on the metal bench of the supply truck, John found that the cacophony of ramblings and noise surrounding him bolstered him for what he had only caught a glimpse of before. In the midst of dust and sand, he came to look upon a kind of poverty that had been unusually dire, even to District Three. The pitiable sight affected all the soldiers, their voices faltering and eventually falling silent as they all peered outside the truck, straining to glimpse a remnant of life outside of army fatigues and roll call. What they saw was a clash of poverty sitting next to unimaginable wealth, and like two ugly colours, they came together and jarred the senses with warring sounds and sights and flavours.
“It's very late.” John sighed, but he was already sitting up, wriggling out of Sherlock's hold (the Dragon-man mumbled something unintelligible but vaguely tetchy in response to such movement). Elena fidgeted in place, staring at the book as if it contained her reasons for entering their room in the first place. John sat himself down on the cold hardwood, gathering his daughter into his arms. For the first time, he saw the tome in her hand.
The buzz in his head slowed to a stop. A whisper, a murmur that compared to its original screaming was nothing.
The Dragon felt a brief pang of something fierce warm through his chest, thawing his logical thought process and causing him to blink away pressure behind his eyes. No one.... Human or Dragon alike.... had
“Do it, John, harder,” Sherlock moaned. “Fuck me!” and Sherlock squeezed his arse around John’s cock one final time. With a scream, “Fuck, yes!!” John bit his lip and emptied himself inside Sherlock as he thrust his way through his orgasm.  Finished, he fell on top of Sherlock, melding their sweat and Sherlock's come between them.
Sherlock wrapped his hand around his cock, and began to pull. John pushed Sherlock’s hand away. “Nope. That’s mine now,” and with the hand still wet with lube, began to pull Sherlock’s cock in time with their thrusts.
The only sound in the room was hard breathing from both men. They both felt the aftershocks of John's cock still buried in Sherlock's arse and weren't in any rush to separate. Eventually they had to and John pulled off and tied the condom, dropping it to the floor.
Sherlock panted. John looked at him and grinned, “Yeah? You like that? More?” Sherlock just nodded rapidly, words lost, thrusting back onto that finger.
John slid his hands down and around two the perfect globes of Sherlock’s arse. He heard an intake of breath. John massaged those cheeks and pulled them open and closed as he breathed damply onto Sherlock’s back. The tight black trousers threatened to burst at the seams. Sherlock’s head hung low and his breaths quickened with every moment.
Sherlock always felt John’s eyes when they were staring at him. A few beers, dark outside the windows, fire going ... and his flatmate couldn’t hide the lust behind those eyes. John never realized, of course. But Sherlock made sure to bend just a little bit more, to stretch his neck to his best advantage, to make little moans that could be passed off as “thinking”.
When John’s fingers began to flick Sherlock's nipples, Sherlock couldn’t hold the sound back any longer. “Jooooooohhhnn,” he moaned. “Oh, oh ... don’t stop ...”
Sherlock pulled off and lay his weight on top of John and they both groaned when skin hit skin. Their cocks nestled with each other side by side and they looked into each other’s eyes.
, he thought - cock. Sitting higher, he moved up and reached back around to position John’s cock under him, and he slowly began to push down onto it.
John lifted Sherlock off him and threw him down on his back. He knelt between Sherlock’s thighs and pulled his ankles over his shoulders while sinking back inside without hesitation. He grabbed Sherlock’s hips and began to pump in and out, quickly and forcefully.
“Turn around.” John’s voice was low. Sherlock turned around. John walked two steps until he was standing behind him. He lifted one of Sherlock’s arms at a time and placed his hands on the fireplace mantle. Sherlock felt heat on his face.
“Or I could do this longer. I could do this for hours,” John teased, still pumping, “see how long you’d last, holding my hand still as you fucked yourself on my fingers. You’re doing so well at that now.” He gently bit Sherlock’s shoulder.
“No, John, now!” and he pushed himself up to straddle John’s middle. John’s fingers slipped out of Sherlock and he felt empty, he needed John’s cock in him immediately. He grabbed the condom laying on the bed, opened it, and slid it over John’s large -
John reached into the drawer, finding condoms and a tube of lube. He spread some onto his fingers and returned to his task, rubbing and circling until he felt his middle finger slip inside. “God, Sherlock, you’re pulling me in. It’s so tight ...,” and he began to pump his finger, twisting in and out.
John added another, again feeling the pull as they were sucked into Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock’s mouth was open, he was panting, sweat on his forehead. “Enough, John! Fuck me! Fuck me now!”
“This isn’t just one time, Sherlock. Not for me.” John said reverently, stroking his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides.
"Oh, I've created a monster ..." John laughed and worked his way down Sherlock's body, pulling the sheet over his head as he went.
John’s lust for Sherlock returned. “Yeah? You want that? You want me to finger your arse open until you’re gaping for my cock?” John let one of his hands trail down until he was rubbing Sherlock’s hole, so soft and ready from its previous activity.
“Mmmmmmm, yesssss,” John moaned and began to meet him thrust for thrust. What started out gentle became harder and harder as each man chased a feeling. John felt Sherlock’s arms sneak under his shoulders to grip for better purchase. Their mouths met again roughly and frantically. Licking, sucking, biting. The feeling of their cocks rutting together felt raw and amazing and Sherlock’s grunts matched his own, but John knew they’d need lube soon.
