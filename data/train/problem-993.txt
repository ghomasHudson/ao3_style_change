There is a hint of pink on his cheeks now, and for a moment Sherlock eye's water again, but from the incredible love and affection he feels for this man in front of him. He forgets everything else, almost as if it was easy to do so, and for once only lives in the present moment.
"I need my mind clear, no distractions," Sherlock murmurs, head turned away from him. He looks like he's sulking. Very much so, even. Like he's sulking and at the same time trying very hard not to show it.
He grabbed it and gave the glass tank all that he got, smashing against it with a growl. He tried it again. And again. The glass remained unimpressed. Angrily, he threw the bar against the nearest wall and kicked the glass with his iron boots. Nothing. He took out his gun and pulled the trigger. Click. Click, click. No more bullets.
"They are-" Mycroft began but was interrupted by a heavy shake that made everyone’s legs wobbly before it stabilised again.
They sat over two cups of tea and three books spread on the kitchen table. Sherlock made surprisingly good tea, but in retrospect that was hardly so surprising. He had not touched his own, as he could not actually drink it. He must have forgotten, as he did now and again. He explained to him the meaning of the energy that surrounded them, in the trees and plants and animals, and John was
Sherlock cracked a sad smile, and for a second he saw James Sholto. "Threatening the patient, Doctor? I don't think that's fair."
"Because thinking, my Doctor, should never be about the package which holds said thoughts together. Because thinking should not be tied to the origin or source of its owner. Thoughts are something to be influenced, to be comprehended, and would it not be contradictory, I wonder, if it was a must for the brain to be created by Nature herself or another thinking party? Should the value of a thought not be measured by its content instead of questioning if it was generated by something with the consistency of cold porridge or not?"
Armed with nothing more than the sharp senses of a former knight, John walked down the stairs into the darkness.
“Alright, you know what? It’s you. Okay? It’s your fault! You just make me so angry all the time. No, don’t- don’t look at me like that.”
few mistakes was not reading between the lines. Had he done so, he could have realised that with money and magic, trust is always built on fragile grounds."
"The way you hold yourself speaks for years of training in a knighthood – this is a fighting posture you stand in, defensive – your first reaction was to look for a weapon, so experience in battle. Still, you did not dare to grab for something to defend yourself, or even pick up the torch on the floor, because you could not be certain keeping an eye off the shadows was a good idea. Trained eyes, therefore, also used to dangers that hide in the dark, dangers of agile and deadly nature. You have enough confidence and trust in your own abilities to not try to run away. No, instead you were calculating the right moment to attack. Your bravery and obvious experience told me it could not have been the
"They are quite good, are they not?" He hesitated for a second but decided to act on his own curiosity after a while. "What is it they are so scared of? Is it the employer?"
Sherlock sits in his proclaimed chair in his thinking position for hours and hours straight. John has gone to bed a long time ago. He has walked off and made his way into Sherlock's bedroom as if it was the most normal thing in the world. As if he has done it a thousand times already. It is simply frustrating not to know what is going on around him. He feels knocked out. The ground has been taken apart from underneath his feet, and now he is falling and falling, caught inside this endless loop of nonsense.
The pure need to kiss him again becomes almost inexplicable, and as Sherlock growls one more time, he opens his eyes and finally realises that they moved. John has guided them through the door right into the hallway between bedroom and kitchen. Sherlock's body seems to know which of the two he'd rather prefer going to right now.
"Oh, isn't it?" She snapped, her voice almost a shriek. "If I recall correctly, it was Tessa who made Mary lose her balance, was it not?" Now looking at Tessa with vengeance.
. Now listen carefully. You will lead me out of this godforsaken place or I promise you I, as a trained doctor, will break every bone in your body while naming them."
) being very patient with him, until he thinks he has finally found the words to form a question that won't make him sound like he has gone completely nuts this time.
John's breathing was heavy but slowly the signals of pain in his hand and the sight of what he had done made him come to his senses. Sherlock was staring at him with his mouth agape. Speechlessness with him was always worrying. He should not have said that. He should not have done that. Shame crawled over his body but he was still panting too hard to acknowledge it.
The street had become quiet. The cyborgs had stopped moving and the vampyres stared at where Irene now sat, on a pile of corpses, joint by those they were fighting against. Their leader was gone. What was there left to fight for now? The world did not seem to know, so it stood still in silence.
Sherlock let out a long-suffering sigh. "Tomorrow you will go to work, to your clinic in the morning and to The Prof in the afternoon. Both are relatively close to Baker Street, closer than to what I assume the location of your cheap flat to be. So you will stay here overnight. My bedroom is free, I don't require sleep anymore. You can eat breakfast at the little coffee house next door. I wouldn't even mind joining you, though I also don't eat, but we could go over the schedule for tomorrow."
A wave of surprise washed over the maid's face and drained the colour out of her rosy cheeks. She looked like she was suddenly feeling unwell. As a doctor, John should have been more concerned, but again, curiosity only made it clear to him that the impact of his words confirmed what he had suspected.
The detective shook his head. "It doesn't matter. You ... Let me try to explain it like this. All of us are never that far from each other. The wheel keeps on turning. Nothing is ever new. We use and we are being used, but we cannot be more or less than nature gives to us. Is that understandable?"
"This should do," he claimed, holding the tube between his long middle finger and thumb, and he closed one eye to observe it closely.
Rosie giggles. She has taken the place between John’s legs in his chair again, and Sherlock is sitting on one of the armrests, with John wrapping an arm around his middle.
He was just about to give up hope, undress again and go to bed early when, as he was hanging his jacket over the nearest chair, he noticed something on his desk he couldn't remember putting there.
"Fine! I … apologise." It must have physically hurt Anderson to get this out. He began to make little and careful steps through the room, past Molly and Greg Lestrade. "I'm just going to sit over there now."
One morning Sherlock sits in front of his microscope on the kitchen table. He hasn’t moved for at least two hours. Nothing unusual. In fact, it is how they spend most of their Sundays now. John doesn’t really date anymore, and even if he did, he would not trade these days for anything. They have fallen into this pattern a while ago, the pattern of staying in on lazy Sundays, waking up later and waiting for the other to have breakfast together. Now Sherlock occupies himself with some experiment on maggots and fingers (John doesn’t even ask) and John is sitting in his chair. He is reading a novel about an incredibly clever and cunning explorer who kind of reminds him of Sherlock (he can’t help it, as much as he would like to). Being absorbed in the book, he is confused at first when Sherlock calls him from the kitchen.
Janine raised her head further and her gun with it. She pointed it right between his eyes. John didn't move, simply kept staring back.
John's voice rasps out the words and it sounds like they were crawling on sandpaper, and from there on they travel right down below Sherlock's gut. He presses another wet kiss to his neck and the arousal must be sensible between them like a fireball floating through the room.
"I mean, it was always irritating. You and all your weekly girlfriends back then. But now that I can finally have this, have
Just as Sherlock's breaks and he can't bring himself to care about his loss of control at all as he answers, "Please, John. Please."
So Sherlock gave in and obeyed. He wrapped his hands around John's middle and, not without a little sulk, told him to get it over with. John communicated to Silverblaze to gallop as fast as she could and they rode back into the fading smoke. He tried his best to hold his breath but his eyes burned painfully. Bodies were piling left and right, and his ears filled with screams of terror. Sherlock suddenly took the leash from him and the horse made a hard stop, throwing her hooves into the air as she cried out. They were just at the wall of a high building.
Sally Donovan hurried to help him up and support his weight. "Here," she gave him a kerchief against the bleeding.
But I swear, I HAD to skip that shower scene for now, that made me struggle for ages, omg. I know this is the next thing I'll have to write, though. Send help.
Thanks for reading this far if you did and I hope you liked where it went because I do. Comments, questions? Always feel free to leave them here or on my tumblr.
"New case?" he asks, apparently paying no attention to his mostly empty and weirdly constructed casewall at all, or otherwise he would have said something about it. This doesn't look like any of the cases he has ever worked on, because this isn't about a case. It's about the man standing behind him without the smallest breadth of distance, and the soldiness of him is currently the only thing that keeps Sherlock's legs from giving in. About now his brain also has the decency to remind him of the little
John had barely been able to take a seat when a grey-haired man, dressed in dark brown tweed, walked into the main hall with heavy but quick steps and an already exasperated look on his face. He skimmed the room until his dark pair of eyes settled on John, anticipating.
He was wandering towards the counter of the pub, ignoring the loud shreds of all the half-drunken conversations he passed by and sat down.
and he reconsiders his choice of words again. Being the one to be observed by Sherlock Holmes is far from new to John, of course - although they didn't get to stare at each other for a very long time now, it's either inappropriate with other people around, or just awkward, given the big, tangled
One was taller, had a full beard and held a trident in his hand. He had his eyes on another man who looked the other way, had a helmet on and held a sword up in the air. One piece of cloth was somehow covering them both from hipbones to the thighs. The whole statue had a dynamic to it, as if a wind of past times had threatened to blow them away before they had turned into stone.
John ignored the smell of violent death and decay as he came closer. He knelt down opposite Sherlock, both of him bent over guts, legs and leftovers. It reminded him of the war. Of the wounds of all those victims, of explosives, of bites and so much more than bites, of wicked fangs in flesh. He had seen men die like this. Die in the most dishonourable way a human life could end in. That was how he knew that this right here was not the work of an animal. Nor that of a vampyre.
Something else caught his attention. One staircase was leading up. But there was another, hidden in the shadow. It was leading downwards. A basement!
Sherlock closed the door behind them. The light of the warm, setting sun swept through the long curtains without demand, just a gentle guest. John felt a warmth spreading from his chest from standing in these rooms again, smelling of burnt wood and Sherlock Holmes. He was greeted by the same charming chaos he had felt so comfortable around, because it was lively, was a tell-tale of its owner's habits.
, thought John, glancing down at his chest. Slowly but surely he began to wonder if no one noticed the indicated outline in the form of an ear in his pocket. Apparently they didn't or decided not to question it. Nevertheless, he thought with a single ear missing from his mechanic body he would still count as
Sherlock finally raised his head out of his hands. "What are you doing here, Mycroft? I am fairly certain my reaction towards your entering should have told you to stick your fat nose into someone else's-"
"But women- oh, women! Dangerous, those women when they go a bit freelance. And we wouldn't want that for little Elizabeth, now would we? We wouldn't want her to become a...
as John wished they would be or could be. There were moments in which he hated that he was how he was. Everyone around them was beautiful, every woman stunning in their long dresses, their soft curls, their sweet laughter. But Sherlock … To him he was always better. Always more.
than Sherlock Holmes at this very moment. He stood there, in the doorframe. The light of mid-day hit him, and John's prior image of him twisted and rewrote itself. His dark brown curls were as wild as they were well-behaved enough to not fall into his stormy blue and gleaming eyes. His skin looked even paler, his clothes even more rummaged, but he looked, above all things, highly dangerous. His plush lips were a straight line, his focus solely on Irene's blemished body. It looked like there was a gun in his right hand, but at second glance he could see that the end of his hand
"Good afternoon," Sherlock greeted him. "My name is Sherlock Holmes and this is my intimate friend and colleague Dr John Watson. Everything you can say to me you may say to him."
He walks over to join Rosie in front of the laptop. Sherlock rolls his eyes in utter adoration. Then he joins them, too.
Someone came by with a tray full of champagne, and John took a glass. Who knew how long this evening would be?
"But just so you know, for that last line of yours I should've changed my mind at least two times by now."
. He was about to retreat and finally get dressed when Sherlock grabbed him by the end of his sleeve and drew his body and his attention back to him.
His head fell back and for long seconds he didn't move. Then, suddenly his head snapped up again. "I wish I could smoke, feel the nicotine entering my lungs. Why didn't I-" But he stopped himself before that sentence came to an end.
He cannot allow himself to moan out loud, so his desperation comes out in quiet whimpers that he tries as good as he can to
"When did you learn to play the violin?" he mumbled but did not get an answer. Maybe he was already dreaming, not speaking aloud at all. But falling asleep was so easy now. Now that he felt safe again, here at Baker Street, with him.
Mrs Hudson supported her orders with flying hands and distinct gestures as she walked in front of the stage, and then motioned to John and Mary that they should take one of the free seats. The women each walked in a different direction behind the stage, apparently positioning themselves to get ready to begin their performance. Only after John had sat down, he noticed the newspaper on the table. But when the lights on the stage went out and the curtains he had not seen closing parted again, he was too intrigued by the events in front of him to see anything else.
"What about- " he starts whispering, opening his eyes without knowing on what point he has closed them. "
Sherlock blinked, and if he could have, there might have been tears to be blinked away. Quickly, he pulled his hand back. "Why are we doing this now?"
The expression of Sherlock Holmes not only made him feel sympathy but also the undeniable desire for justice.
. Sherlock clings to the headboard to keep himself alive, but he also uses it to push back around John, almost hitting it, almost and-
The blasting noise of a gunshot resonated in John's ears. Sherlock had fired a shot. One of the General's men fell to the ground, revealing through the zipping wires in his head that he was a cyborg, about to shoot the General herself! Another shot echoed from the high ceiling simultaneously, and Sherlock clutched his arm, now smoking and twitching robotically and sparks flying from it.
"James is a bastard, born from the womb of a female that fell in love with a human. She was impregnated before he turned, but they had hope that the baby could live regardless. He did live. And his parents, clueless yet of what he was, gave the little boy a sister."
. There, he said it. In his head, of course, never out loud. But Sherlock, with his many frustrating qualities, of which many are outrageously attractive to John, is practically forcing him to feel provoked. Those feelings then lead to … petnames, apparently. He’s had stranger coping mechanisms before.
Oh, but he is so close already and it feels so good. It wouldn’t take a lot for him to snap. His mind already drifts off again, and he bites onto his finger so hard that it will surely leave a mark.
He told the final part of the story in a low voice. "I built this body. It was the golden thread drawing through my whole life, it was the accomplishment I couldn't help but crave for. He forced me to finish the work we had started, but when he threatened to make me into the first one of my kind … In that moment I saw him through the lens of a scientist. I saw the opportunity to truly overcome death.
They reached the end of the stairs and walked past Mrs Hudson's flat and out of the front door. Speedwells was literally no more than one stone's throw away and one minute later they were sitting inside the coffee shop and by the window, opposite each other. John ordered breakfast and a cup of tea, black, no sugar. They brought the tea in next to no time, and he almost burned his tongue on the steaming hot first sip that would hopefully bring him through the morning. He closed his eyes at the taste of bitterness and warmth on his lips and endured the pain the burn caused him. All this time he had not noticed that Sherlock would not take his eyes off him. Was he trying to picture how it tasted? Would he ask him again to let him drink a sip, like he had done with the wine? But the look on his face did not speak of wonder or longing as much as of … observation? Was he studying him? Or just making use of his
He rose from the back of the horse until he stood upright, pulling John up and demanding him to do the same. Feeling dizzy from the smoke and the smell, John stood on Silverblaze's back with wobbly legs. In the middle of a battle zone. Now more than ever, he felt caught in a dream. A nightmare, most likely. If he died now, he wondered, fell down and broke his neck or landed right at the feet of a thirsty monster, would he just wake up in his own bed and get back to a time in which he had never even met Sherlock Holmes? God, selfishly and horribly enough, he hoped not.
They went to the reception and Anthea started to talk with the man on the other side of the desk in sign language. Once they were allowed to go to the next room, John became nervous. He had fought it for the entirety of their trip, but it took more and more out of him to ignore it now. Who would await him in that room? Another madman? James Moriarty himself? This whole arrangement was just what he would do. Leaving John in the dark, giving him the soft layer of hope at having made it out, only to crush it after a long hour of suspense.
"Sherlock," he gasps out in a rough voice. It travels down Sherlock's spine to the base of it, makes the muscles in his thighs jerk and his legs fall open further.
"Well, you're talking about Irene Adler now. A part of his own abilities he gives to her to take control over her. But you don't seem to be affected by this. You are still yourself."
Finally, Sherlock turned to him and he could see his eyes. Could see how the blue sky resembled his eyes and how all the missing clouds from the sky were hiding behind them. He thought that, if he had the ability, his eyes would be filled with tears. That this was what it would look like if he were about to cry. Yes. It hurt him more than words ever could.
She simply smiled at him, then turned her back like this conversation wasn't one worth having with him. John knew he had liked Jane a lot in the beginning, but he began to think this wouldn't be the case with Janine now. Not that the way she acted around Sherlock had anything to do with that (is what he told himself).
"Yes, I've met. She was worried about you," he murmured, and gave a satisfied huff as the limb clinked in place.
They left the graveyard in conjoined silence and the dove flew off, letting herself be taken by the wind.
. And still not at all why there had come here. But another voice filled the room to interrupt their moment of … well, whatever one might call it.
– and from the moment he had first spoken of him, one of his hands had found the back of Moran's neck, which he now began to stroke, his eyes gleaming.
"Yes," said Sherlock. He did not even know what he was going to say before Sherlock did. Did it seem what? Cruel? Wrong? Dehumanising?
Somehow I think this is not nearly enough, but I won't put myself down because it doesn't help anyone... Excuses, excuses.
"No, I am impatient with you specifically, and- oh, you still look so tense at all times! Swing your hips a little more, or do look like you actually enjoy being here! Jane manages it, too, frankly, it cannot be that difficult!"
Then John thinks about what has just happened, trying to blink the confusion off his face before it finally clicks. "Wait a minute. Are you jealous?" Well, that is… surprising. That, as well as the possessive and excited flutter of arousal he feels at the concept of this. Sherlock is rarely ever jealous. At least not in a way John would recognise as jealousy. He knows he is a very jealous person himself. Various events in the past (hello Irene, Janine, Jim from IT) have made that more than clear to him. Additionally, during the last several months of them finally being them and together in
John’s eyes widen in shock and his heart jumps once in his chest and then stops, he thinks, just stops, and he wants to melt and become one with the floorboards. This is bad.
"'s alright," John replies in a throaty voice, but despite what he said his cock gives an obvious twitch as Sherlock's breath tickles the flesh where it's straining and hard against his belly.
He feels so limp and weak now. His body is not attached to him anymore, it clearly can't be, he must be floating on some cloud in heaven. Minutes pass by that feel like hours, and he thinks he could sleep for days on end. In a rough tone, he manages to breathe out, "Did you?"
“Oh, you have to? Why do you have to? Because they tell you to? Why are you always acting like you’re someone else’s little puppet?”
He hammered his fist against the glass in desperation. His anger faded in a heartbeat as the tears formed, turning his sight blurry. It was no use crying now. He opened his hands and pressed his palms against the cold pane, separating him from the only hope he had left. But the string of one last hope was thin, about to snap. It felt like he was dying with him. God, he hated this. The sadness. It wasn't for him. He liked anger. Anger he could control. But sorrow would only wash right over him like waves on a shore.
They long for each other, and their lips meet so hard it might leave bruises. John is all-consuming, is groaning and opening his mouth by opening his own first. Sherlock’s knees buckle at the sensation that is John’s tongue running over his bottom lip. If this is what it’s like to kiss John Watson, he should be put in chains because it’s dangerous. He walks him backwards, shoves him into the wall next to the kitchen. Sherlock’s trousers have dropped down to his ankles and he almost falls over them, held upright by the hard surface of the wall where he bumps his head into.
. For a few quiet minutes, he would have done anything to fall asleep and embrace death. Lying here with a cold body, it felt like the only right thing to do was to become a corpse himself, for someone to find them like this. Rotting away together. But soon, something began to feel... unsettling. Sherlock Holmes had just died. It felt so strange thinking it just like that. There was no weight to the statement. But there should be. There should be an unbearable weight to it that came at least close to what John was feeling. There should be acknowledgement. A sign in the sky that showed the world England's greatest man had fallen and everyone should bow their heads in mourning. The sun should not shine for at least a week, dipping the world in blackness. Instead, here they were. Alone.
He feared he would hear another apology from Sherlock. He didn’t need to hear more of them anymore. He had forgiven him a long, long time ago, and he hated that he still dreamed of Sherlock’s regrets and mistakes. It didn’t do any good to anyone, after all.
"Once we were both but two lost boys. Craving a very simple thing and finding hope in an almost utopian idea, and yet something that should never have landed in the hands of men. Now, I cannot look anyone in the eye and justify his actions. Nor my own actions. James Moriarty is, by all means, a criminal of the law and I would not put my hand in the fire to prove his sanity,
"Dr Watson and those who work at The Prof are obviously in the best position to keep an eye on Moriarty. Any clue can be helpful in finding out where he brings the bodies or from where he leads his criminal net."
Sherlock's face displayed no emotion. John's did so all the more. He was certain that every single thought of his must have shown on his face, and he didn't care.
There was a long pause between them. Sherlock's widened eyes narrowed and he was searching John's face, first in confusion, then in curiosity. "Yes," he said slowly. "I feared so."
He turned to leave the cab and open the door. John held him by the sleeve. "Sherlock, wait! I still don't think I understand everything you just told me."
Behind him there was a child, hardly older than fourteen, that almost stumbled over his bag when she got out. She didn't seem to mind as she ran towards a couple, that could only be her parents, with excitement and joy written all over her features and hugged them tightly. An elderly man stepped out after her, smiling warmly as he spoke.
They were finding themselves in the glass pane belly of the ship again, standing around the main table made of maple wood. The lamps around the room cast their faces in warm yellow light but the atmosphere was rather a mild one. Lestrade had acted quickly when the attacks had started shortly after their meeting at Scotland Yard, securing citizens and commanding his officers to do the same as quickly as possible. Furthermore, he had rushed to his house and taken Molly with him before the second airship was able to take them all on board.
John's panting is the only noise to perceive in those first moments of adrenaline and blood pumping. They don't do this anymore, he is a bit out of practice. What has surprised him a little is Sherlock's hard breathing, which the man tries to hide. Although he has the advantage of his height, he could never catch up with him this time. (And the long legs certainly are an unfair advantage, he had tried to argue with him about that once, the fact that Sherlock could always point out his friend's shortness but didn't bother to take a bit of a slower pace from time to time.
John clenched hands to fists. "You will have much more to lose if you put that plan of yours into operation."
John doesn’t hold anything back with him. He kisses him in every spot, he bites his lip and neck and,
I cannot believe that after aaaall this time and the struggles I had with this fic, we've come to an end now. This is officially the last chapter before the final epilogue. Thank you to everyone who bore with me. I know WIPs can be hard to follow, I know updates have taken their time. I'm just glad I kicked my ass enough to actually go through with this, bring my ideas to empty document pages and let them grow. That's the biggest challenge and best advice for becoming better at writing. Kick your own ass and do it even when it's hard! But don't be too hard on yourself when you can't bring yourself to do it one day either. See, that's some advice I should take more often!
"Poseidon," he explained. "He fell in love with a young nymph called Caenis. As a symbol of his affection, Poseidon promised to grant her any wish, so Caenis wished for a man's body. But the god gave her not only this, he also gave her impenetrable skin. This is how Caenis became Caeneus and turned into a great warrior due to Poseidon’s love for him."
John had read about him in the papers. That was why the name of the inspector had struck him as familiar. He just hadn't been sure about the pronounciation.
"Let me show you how much you mean to me," John whispers gently, tickles his skin. "I want to show you that I love you more than anything in this world."
Sherlock shushed him in the midst of his rant, a worried look on his face at the thought of who might be listening, not of who was speaking to him.
He blinks back at him, but stays otherwise silent. He listens more, yes. But when he actively keeps his own mouth shut, something is definitely not right.
Sherlock opened his mouth to object to that, and then he didn't. The look on his face now, dumbfounded for the first time, sent John into another fit of laughter until his stomach hurt. He heard Sherlock join in somewhere in between, his rich voice filling the space around them. John felt like a lunatic, high on adrenaline, and had to hold his breath to finally stop himself. A broad smile spread all over his face and his cheeks positively
"I believe Greg already showed you the door," Molly said, smiling, and Lestrade gladly held it open for him again.
Molly mounted the horse they had come with, and Moriarty was behind her with his hands cuffed to the saddle. The last thing they needed was the man getting stupid ideas from too much freedom. This time, Sherlock had no more strength to mind the horse and he let himself fall against John on Silverblaze.
alone!) grabs both of his thighs with such a determination that he could get bruises from it, covering his skin with open-mouthed kisses and starts licking closer to the area that would really be in need of a doctor very soon.
In the middle of the room, on a beige sofa with curved legs, lay a woman, dressed in hardly more than quite a translucent green dressing gown. She looked like she was either in agony or just extremely bored. When the woman, who could only be Ms Adler, looked up and made out her housemaid, her eyes seemed to instantly brighten.
The first creature fell with a shot, then the second and the third. But the more they killed, the more came out of the smoke clouds, and they were fast. They fired back but the knight's shields held the bullets. One had made its way to them and John drew his sword before the claws could meet his ribs. The vampyre's head landed in the dirt. The blood landed on John. Sherlock fired some headshots but they were rushing forward one after the other, climbing over the corpses of their own kind to get to them.
But Lestrade interrupted, "Donovan, please remove Sherlock Holmes from the list of missing persons."
Everything was falling into place as their lips met. They met like the two of them had. Unexpectedly but inevitable, two fates overlapping, growing intertwined forever. He deepened the kiss and kept on crying. But they were alright. Both crying and kissing. And finally, finally those blue eyes were allowed to cry again.
Sherlock makes a frustrated noise. "Ngh, for God's sake, I need- John, your cock. Please, I need to feel it. I need to know how huge and heavy it feels, I need your balls against my arse as I scream out your name, and please, I need to hear what you sound like when you come undone."
"I shot him." Seeing Tom as a walking corpse, empty eyed and broken, took all the willpower she had left in her to pull the trigger. But she had pulled the trigger. Saved Greg's life. "He can rest now."
His grip is strong, too eager almost, and he starts stroking with shaking fingers while the other arm is pressed against the wall to hold himself upright. With each stroke something electrifying is striking down his spine, making him lose his mind, but it is not enough. John is there again, so close in his head and has yet left him alone to resolve this problem. In his imagination John is sinking to his knees now, gently taking Sherlock's hand and putting it away from himself. He is humming, pushing his face against Sherlock's hip, and it's getting too much already.
Sherlock took the goggles from the instrument and placed them onto a pile of notes in a manner that could not exactly be described as careful. John almost chuckled at this, for the man and his contradictions still remained a mystery to him.
"I just have the feeling that you're not really with me this morning, is all. And I don't like this feeling."
At this, Sherlock huffed a laugh too, but there was no humour in it. "The Sherlock Holmes you know … You still believe that to be true."
There was a moment in which he thought she might break and cry. It did not come. In another moment he didn't believe one word she said. The turning point came when she mentioned Kate. John did not praise himself for being able to read people, but he had absolute trust in his gut feeling. This time, it told him that Irene Adler sounded like she knew love. And that was all he needed to know.
. It did not feel like it. Looking out of the window, it did not look like it. It looked like every other day in London. But the streets were empty. What was a city without its citizens? There was one question he really wanted to ask, though.
He looked up at him and found a pair of crystal blue eyes looking back, keenly, fascinated as they always were. He had missed those lively eyes. Oh, he felt pierced. Happily pierced by crystal blue, with two tiny freckles on the left, a shimmer of green whenever he blinked. John reached out to let his fingers sink into a mop of soft curls, closed the gap of distance. And kissed him. Kissed him in his bed, in his arms, in his very mind and soul.
." Sally and Sherlock spoke at the same time, and finally Lestrade acknowledged that there were others in the room as well. He turned his head in Sally's direction.
Sherlock snorted. "True. Though she stayed longer than we have." He looked at his own hands, before warmly meeting John's eyes again. "And I've got you."
like the sound of gunfire. It was maddening. What had once been a sign of enjoyment and praise was now the sound of submission. It finally ended when the man stood by Moriarty's side.
Sherlock was still staring at him. Moriarty was currently engaged in a cheerful conversation with a woman in a white dress. A few more minutes and he would have pierced daggers through him with his eyes only.
"Sorry," John muttered. He should try to distract her from the pain somehow. "So... How did you know I was a doctor? I haven't mentioned that to you, and neither has your maid. Still, you knew." He stumbled a bit over the word
The sounds were familiar and yet different. Laughter, the buzz of dozens of voices speaking at the same time, resembling the gentle hum of a bee swarm. Somewhere someone dropped a glass of champagne and it shattered on the tiles.
When he watches Sherlock complaining about dinner with people, watches him stating how all those people hate him, he smiles. Watches Sherlock ramble a little about how thinking up an excuse was worse than no excuse at all (
could easily belong to anyone. Why would he be known in a place like this? It was just a dirty pub and no one was supposed to know him here.
Sherlock honestly doesn't know what John is talking about, even though his cum smeared cheek is currently sticking to John's chest, the rest of their bodies drying with the mixture of sweat and semen. He doesn't think he has ever been more comfortable in his entire life. And never happier.
"Would you keep it in your coat pocket for the rest of the day until you need it? I have little desire to be a witness to all the tedious conversations with all these
"So very far from 'settled'," John heard Lestrade mumble next to him, but Sherlock either didn't hear or ignored it as he took out what appeared to be a huge map, all yellowed and dusty. He spread it out on the big table in the middle of the room, and everyone, curious as such groups were, gathered around it and watched as he blew off the dust. Lestrade coughed a little, which seemed ironic, considering he apparently smoked cigars, and Sherlock ordered two people (Wiggins and that awkward looking fellow) to hold down the ends for it to not roll up again. It turned out to be a map of the City of London.
Mrs Hudson burst into the room like the lively woman that she was. Eager to get her answer, she looked around the living room, hurrying on her little heels. At seeing John sitting on the table as though nothing had ever happened, her face lit with relief.
In three quick and calculated movements he held her by the waist, put her hand into his and pulled her closer. She let out a surprised gasp, hesitant to place her hand on his shoulder or to even look at him directly.
"Oh, but my emotions, Mr Holmes? Believe it or not, my emotions are the only thing right now saving you from actually getting your head kicked into the Thames. Those people died because of you. Because of you alone. Don't think a cyborg army would not have you killed for a mistake such as this. It'd be
A feeling that had evolved long before the man had saved his life. A feeling that was wrong, and he was wrong for feeling so right at being helpless to it. James had seen that. He had seen the way John looked at his face and would not notice the scars but his eyes instead. After saving his life a final time, John had never seen him again.
He looked back down to spot where Moran had almost been choked to death by a snake. He was gone. The snake was still there, dead. He raised his head and his eyes locked on Sherlock's form. He had grown his one hand back, the one that wasn't currently a colt, and fought James Moriarty with a sword. Moriarty was bleeding from his face and his clothes were dirty and badly torn. Sherlock didn't look much better, with the exception that he couldn't bleed. He could only wear the blood of the dead around. Every time metal met metal, the blades were screaming for mercy. Sherlock broke down first.
His hands both clenched around his chest. He scratched and gasped and kept searching with his hands and eyes. There was nothing there. Eurus had shot right through him, revealing the empty space, oh, so much empty space where no heart was pounding. The hole in him exposed the wheels turning and cogs spinning and some had flown out, continued to fall out of him. He could not speak. But he
Mrs Hudson knocked on the open door just after she entered, making the gesture quite unnecessary but charming. She looked at her two boys with little surprise and let out a sigh of her own that ended in a loving smile.
John sits back on his heels and lifts Sherlock up by the hips. With one smooth thrust he is buried inside of him from tip to shaft, balls deep. Overwhelmingly perfect. His mouth is hanging wide open and his eyes are closed in concentrating.
John knocked on the door with the two crystalline tigers and after a moment the door opened and a young man looked down at him. He was at least one head taller than John, had strikingly blue eyes and broad shoulders. He was wearing a dark suit and striped tie around his neck. The grin on his face was too forced and his eyes were too cold to save it.
With a bit of reluctance, he took a deep breath and rolled his shoulder like he was preparing for battle. Well, it was a battle of sorts. A battle of the unknown that would lie behind those walls. An entry of flat stairs led up to the big front door, and John walked up to knock and announce his arrival. His fingers tightened around the metallic handle of the door knocker; a black snake that wrapped its tail around the handle. The figure eyed him with suspicion and its tongue stuck out and mimicked the unspoken message it spread.
. Let alone something that could make the conscious decision to move to where it was needed most. (Was that not what Sherlock was trying to say?)
"I will tell her when the time has come. She has turned in already, so she is unaware that we are in the flat. I would prefer you to leave her in the dark about the activity in this household for a bit longer still."
The world was blurry. Blurry and defined by one constant sting at the back of his head. No, not constant. It let go of his nerve endings every time his heart paused between beats. Every throb that shot through his veins brought pain to his temples. It drowned every other sound for a while. Blink, blink, blink. John began to gain back his consciousness. He was sure he had opened his eyes, but his world was still covered in darkness. For a moment too long he worried that he might have lost his eyesight. A moment that made his heart stagger in his chest and brought another wave of pain to his head. He realised then, by looking around and blinking more, that his eyes weren't used to the dark yet.
He held the ear up now, close to his mouth. "Going to Scotland Yard now." Already feeling ridiculous enough, he almost bit his tongue to cut off the
Sherlock obeys willingly. There are only few occasions in which John is in charge, where his word becomes the command, where he gets to say what to do next. But when it comes to sex, Sherlock is ready to give him everything. And John is more than willing to take it all. Sherlock
They ended up pressed back to back, panting and shooting. Above them, the stars shone bright and clear out of the midnight blue ceiling of the night sky. Distantly, John could see beyond the next target and the muzzle of his gun. He saw Moriarty fist-fighting one vampyre after the other, blood dripping from his whole face and mouth. The fireworks had stopped, but the smoke was still hovering like a thick fog. Noise, screams, everywhere, but there was one distinct sound suddenly cancelling out everything else. John could hear it loud and clear but he didn’t see, yet it sounded like ... bloody hell, where did this
"I know these kind of bags," she continued, "This is your medical bag. I am injured. That implies: You are a doctor. Wasn't that difficult to conclude, frankly."
Sherlock is currently caught in a disturbingly realistic kind of dream and will be utterly shattered as soon as he wakes up.
His head only swims, absolutely lightheaded, as John opens one button after the other while he makes his way below his navel. He does it all so gently and painfully slowly that Sherlock has been reduced to a constant shivering of arousal and whimpers that should be out of his usual vocal range. John has sunken to the floor now, and takes up all the space between his legs. When he dips his tongue inside of his belly button, Sherlock wraps his legs instantly around John's upper body to pull him closer, closer still, get him where he so desperately wants him. But John has decided to tease only further. Pressing his cheek against the outline of the bulge in his trousers, he seeks another long moan from the depths of Sherlock's throat out into the open, quiet space of 221B.
"Well." That brought an end to their afternoon of just the two of them. Sherlock let go of John while his eyes told the story of what he wanted to do instead. But the little smile on his face gave the promise of a later.
He shot. The bullet disappeared into the skull, and the misshapen Irene Adler collapsed in a heap like a hot-air balloon with no air. John could finally move again, yet his limbs felt like they did not belong to him anymore. He could barely so much as stand up from his chair as Sherlock stepped over the corpse that was lying there like a fallen circus tent.
Sherlock presses his cheek against the bathroom tiles once more when he thinks he is just not capable of standing upright any longer. He starts seeing them now, whenever he closes his eyes. He sees John and him, in this very shower. Groping and kissing and rubbing, fucking and making love, too. It doesn't feel like daydreaming, it feels like remembering, however that can be, but he doesn't care.
I feel like I should talk to you more, tell you a bit more about what's happening. So, as you might have noticed, I'm struggling a little to bring this monster of a fic to an end. (I know it's not immensely long but it's not exactly short either.) Believe me, I've got it all planned out from here on. We're close. Does it feel like we're close? 'Cause I feel like it took me very long to set this story off and form a ground for the main plot, and yes, blabla I'm rambling. Just saying that this fanfiction has been with me for over one and a half years now and I've learned a lot from it and would change stuff if I started again now. Which I'm definitely not gonna do, ha..hah. Nope.
"Ladies and gentlemen-" They heard Moriarty say into a microphone, his voice even more metallic through the quiet echo in the background.
John steps right into his space. Sherlock can smell him. It does things to him, awful things to his heightened senses. It clouds them, but at the same time he is overly aware of naked skin and of John wearing way too many clothes.
John sits on the sofa with his glass of self-pity and liquilised courage in hand, watching the screen of his television. He can't believe he is activily doing this to himself. Seeing Sherlock again after all this time, not on pictures or bloody dry news reports ruining his reputation, fooling the world into believing he hadn't been the best and the wisest man London would ever get to know, is nothing he can stand without his new best friend.
John shifted closer to the window before the man could stop him to see if there was anyone – Sherlock, Lestrade, anyone! – who could help him if this really was a trap. His hand was on his gun. The man grabbed him by his sleeve.
In that moment, the vamp swung his gun and crashed it against his temple. John fell from the blow and the pain. His head felt like it had met a brick wall, blood pumping through it like shock waves. Before he could open his eyes, the hard sole of a black boot was pressed against his throat. It stank of death and leather. The muzzle of a rifle hit the bridge of his nose and John braced for the impact of metal breaking his skull.
“Do it, John,” he whispers. It’s sweet but it’s a challenge. He doesn’t break eye contact. His tongue sticks out to lick away another drop of pre-cum, and John gasps. “Fuck my mouth.”
There were a strange five metres of distance between them. No one moved. Sholto's sharp intake of breath signalled the world that it could spin again, the clocks could tick again and with them, a conversation that should never take place was just beginning.
"But what for?" John put his cup down before he could spill the tea and burn his lap. "What on earth would Moriarty need an army of cyborg soldiers for? What war is there for him that he is trying to win?"
In this moment, Rosie randomly punches the laptop and opens one of the recommended videos on the sidebar.
What was he even doing here? Following a strange woman he only knew for so little an amount of time –
"You know Mrs Hudson? Is she all right?" Sherlock asked, sounding so human for a second that it startled John.
Moriarty kept him at The Professor for some hours after he had signed the contract, but thankfully he didn't see Irene Adler again this day. Instead, he met Tessa who had somehow managed to twist her hand during a rehearsal a few hours ago. She let John have a look and his advice was cooling it, secretly thinking that maybe Kitty was not entirely wrong about treating her like a child – she could be quite clumsy when it came to … moving her body in general, he supposed. But then again, John knew nothing about dancing. And the more he thought about it, the more he questioned how much he actually knew about anything that was not a wounded body or a battlefield. But he knew that he wanted to know more. He wanted to know the person who could help him see more.
"First of all, Lestrade." He stepped closer to the painting and pointed at the stars below the frame. "Alexander Woodbridge's wife mentioned that he was obsessed with astronomy. I believe you were there as well, but I could have overestimated your powers of paying attention to the words of a woman."
Sherlock raised a brow and shrugged. "A little." Now even he could not repress a smile and John, obviously, joined in.
The salty taste of pre-cum floods his mouth and he absolutely loves it, hollows his cheeks around him, harder, just a bit more to-
One of Sherlock's hands, still too heavy for his weak limbs to heave, travels all the way up until his fingers close around his testicles. He gives them a slow massage and feels John breathing harder above him. From this perspective, being on eye level with it, his cock looks huge and it's almost overwhelming to look at it for too long. It's all flushed and thick, veins pressing against the skin and pulsate with every quick heartbeat, filling it with more arousal. The head of it is already slick with pre-cum, and Sherlock feels his own spent cock growing with renewed interest at the sight alone. When he presses one of his fingers into the skin just behind John's balls, he watches in fascination as it jumps once, twice, the pre-cum sticking to his skin like a twine.
But what was that odd feeling that was springing back to life and flickering like a relit candle? Could it be hope? A sense to be finally, fortunately arriving somewhere he could belong.
The boy handed him a telegram and ran off as soon as he had come and to wherever he had come from. John looked after him in wonder. He could not recall having seen him here before. Shaking his head, he held the piece of paper up to read it.
The short applause returned and died quickly. Moriarty's dark eyes pierced through the crowd to find Sherlock and pin him to the place. The way he looked down at him made John's blood run cold. If he was the spider, Sherlock was his fly.
Sherlock looked at him, almost offended by John's apparent stupidity. "I lived in a basement for weeks on end. When should I have had the time to study the blueprints of that bloody mansion?"
Sherlock's eyes widen like that of a helpless child. Rather disturbing a lot. "Mary? Mary, your ..."
He took a step forward and bent down to pick up one of the candles from the grave. The earth began to move and the sound of stone scraping on stone and dirt rippling down disturbing the peace of the dead. The opening in the ground uncovered a large staircase that into the darkness.
, pounding sound, and if this was not the most beautiful thing he had ever heard! A little spirited crow with white wings was flying around his head. It opened its beaker and out came the sound of life. The cut in Sherlock's skull closed itself, and John still marvelled at the crow flying around him in circles until it rushed right into the red glow. It breathed the life back into Sherlock from the inside out, lifting him inches from the ground before he fell back down. His eyes snapped open and he breathed it all into his lungs like a man saved from drowning. His limbs stretched out, desperately reaching for something, but John was here, he was here for him.
"I will waste my time trying to count every star of this night sky. But isn't it funny that I can't help but try?"
It made him wonder how he could not have heard it. He had the keen ears of a knight. Not waking from a noise at night could easily mean death for a troop.
Sherlock almost looked offended for a second, and John gulped. "You, uhm, you said that, uh, Moriarty stole your heart? What did he want with it?"
in his eyes. A flashback of a sudden convolution around his heart rushes through him, duller, but he still finds himself believing that it was a heart attack and the end of him.
Sherlock holds himself back before that sentence can come to an end. He is still careful sometimes because he doesn’t want to sound too harsh or too arrogant towards John. Even though he knows John will like him anyway, has, in fact, started to like him when he was far worse, but when he sometimes tends to be more careful around him it feels more like an old habit saying hello. A habit from times where John wouldn’t even speak to him and he would very, very careful to not upset him in any way.
But what he can see in the sky is more than a little unexpected. There are stars up there, yes, millions of stars he would usually never notice. Without John he would never care.
"I am seeing someone." Sherlock frowned at him, and the sad smile became a grin that made John's heart skip a beat.
"But you must have heard the stories, and you've read the paper, so this could hardly be anything new to you. Just ignore the wiggy old lady, dear," she said, trying to shrug off her visible attachment to the missing man with a laugh and a pat on John's hand.
"I learned a lot of James Moriarty's personal history before he enslaved my mind to his liking. As I did of yours, my dear," Irene began and opened a large map of London on the table they were all seated around. Sherlock, standing, had his hands on his hips in silent judgement, though he did not interrupt her. It was obvious the two of them had history. He respected her, treated her differently than most.
at times. But everyone has bad days, right?" She looked at him as if he simply had to agree with her, but, as seemed to be a habit of hers, she did so with the confidence of a cat watching its prey.
to make a wish. He would want a thousand wishes, slowly changing everything that has ever gone wrong. A thousand wishes from a thousand stars, because if there aren't a million up there, then he wants a thousand at least.
He feels an odd tickling on his neck, and his eyes snap open. John is leaning down behind him, resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder, and he can feel him smiling and calmly breathing through his nose.
"Alright, alright," Lestrade said then, "I believe you when you say that Sherlock Holmes has sent you. So would you be so kind as to follow me to my office, Mr Watson, and I am sure we can clear up this little misunderstanding, hm?"
"I visited Ms Adler to see after her, you remember? As a test for Moriarty to judge what I'm worth, probably. That's, erm. Yeah, that's where I met him."
John had learned as much about the soul. He knew it did not lay here buried. He knew it was long gone, off to the place where souls reunited above the clouds. Still, he had brought flowers. A bouquet of pink carnations, neatly bound together. Gently, he let it fall onto the soft earth as he bent down. All things said, he looked over the grave one final time. Nodding once. Breathing in. Breathing out.
"It's a blood sample," Sherlock murmured and John almost jumped at the sudden closeness of these lips to his neck and the voice in his ear.
"Well," Irene looked over to Sherlock, who urged her with her eyes to go on. "They can only strike at night. But with everything else … I fear my knowledge is exhausted."
was wearing a light grey, three-piece suit, his black leather gloves holding a cane with a golden tiger head. The slicked back hair was extremely dark against his skin, and the pair of hazelnut eyes was watching John far too keenly for his liking. There was something in them that spoke of more than just confidence and John could not be sure he wanted to find out what would make something in them snap and the man
His voice was on the verge of hysteria. He rarely ever saw him like this anymore – consumed by sentiment – because he rarely ever saw him at all.
"Well, about that. We are still … I guess you'll see for yourself. Just follow me. It's at the courtyard."
John couldn't believe this. What was Jane, the pretty dancer from Moriarty's club, doing down here, somewhere in the basement of Scotland Yard? She looked rather dressed for a fight instead of a show today.
"But he hasn't killed you yet," John continued. "If he keeps you down here, you must know a lot about this place, isn't that so? Thus, you can help me to get out of here!"
. Sherlock had not bothered with telling him the name of the place where they would meet. He entered without a second thought.
. Machines can only be programmed to work on behalf of logic and logic alone. But Sherlock did not act like a machine. The way his face revealed just the slightest bits of emotion, the sole fact that he even wanted to hide those emotions, that he thought he had to appear colder, contradicted the very act itself. John had seen him caress his violin. There was no logic in that, none at all.
A second later, Sherlock had disarmed John, pulled him up for all to see and pressed the gun to his head.
"A dogtag. Military days. Your own? No, the reminder of your soldier identity doesn't provide enough emotional value, it would meet with cynicism rather than sentiment, wouldn't it? Why would you still have them on you if they weren't from someone you cared about? Your posture suggests it was intimate, and your jaw clenches as if you were still uncomfortable to this day. So it was something you had to keep from most of your troop. Someone you wouldn't have been allowed to be seen with. Who was higher in rank. Or perhaps someone who wasn't... adequate?"
The man opened his arms as if to present himself to John and invite him to take closer looks. "What do you think I am?"
"It is just so difficult to imagine him gone. Not simply with the rent, it was not much that he was paying, frankly. Not that I would have wanted more. Hardly the best of tenants, he was. The way he treated the kitchen –
No one else was allowed to know of them. Of the existence of a race that was superior in battle, bestial and yet sharp. John had been able to live with the bearing of those secrets and he knew what was at stake at all times if he was anything other than ready for the next day full of life or death choices. He knew and everyone else knew, and that made them share something that was truly special in its own tragic way. They shared their losses and joys, secrets and traumas.
Hours later, close to the end of his shift, he was walking down the small hallway behind the stage, doctor's kit in hand, just about to turn around the corner and enter the main hall. But he stopped in his tracks. There was something off. His instincts told him so before he could even think it. He felt watched, suddenly, and swore he could hear the breath of whispers from somewhere in the darkness of the narrow hallway, yet close to him. As close as thoughts, as if he was just thinking to himself. But then someone got into his head and thought with him in a language he didn't understand. He knew he was a paranoid person. He
Sherlock took it and got up. Snakes were all around Moriarty's feet now. He tried shooting Eurus but she was too fast, everywhere and nowhere, every shot a miss. The snakes were trying to get to her, and she screamed as she stumbled over one of them and tripped. Moriarty took the chance to throw himself onto her.
Shoving the chair back that John had previously sat on, he tried to take up less space. But even Mrs Hudson sitting next to him didn't look amused. "Go on then, Holmes," he mumbled, "I'm all ears."
A loud growl woke him from his thoughts and the dizziness ebbed away. The next thing he saw was the points of a large hook boring into the vampyre's face and ripping his neck open. The impact from the hooks pulled him right off his feet and from the rooftop to certain death. John couldn't take Sherlock's hand this time, as there was none currently on him, but he managed to get on his feet by himself and pick up his sword. "Saved me again, did you?"
In his youth he might or might not have found himself within the walls of such a building on occasions, throwing the little money he had around, craving for the company of a faceless temptation.
Sherlock jumped up and rose to his full height again. Just as John thought he would just run off to Lestrade immediately, he felt a hand on his shoulder. Sherlock helped him to get off the ground and suddenly they were standing too close again.
Sherlock knew it, too. He stood up in defence even before the dark mistress was stepping out of the shadows. Her shoes stretching over her knees and black trousers were leathern as the corset over her white frill blouse. Her hair was neatly put up and her knowing smile finally shone red again.
The old man seemed to finally look him over and recognised his uniform. A chance for John to also look the man in the eye that was standing uncomfortably close to him for at least two minutes now. He wore a beard of dark blond to light grey hairs, covering almost all of his thin upper lip and a fair amount of his chin. His forehead looked almost unending, for his hair had fallen out in a way that left the remaining longer strands on the back of his head almost looking out of place. He smiled a smile that didn't reach his steel blue eyes, and he wore a monocle. If it had not been for the bits of his clothes that suggested higher class, he would have looked far more intimidating, even to John.
Their next turn brought them into a bright and otherwise empty room with one single painting on a wall. It was said to be the highlight of this month's exhibition. John remembered himself skimming through it in the papers recently. Up close he really couldn't see what would make it so special or significantly different from all the other pieces they had seen. Names, he supposed, might have been the most important factor in the process of this decision. As they were in so many other cases.
They are trying to figure out how to braid Rosie's hair, and Sherlock (since he has deleted braiding a while ago) suggested a video tutorial. Turns out John is terrible at those.
Again, applause. Somewhere in the crowd, a man in a black suit began to move. The big dresses and tall gentlemen switched positions like pawns on a chessboard, making room for him. A quiet rustle echoed through the room. The man stepped forward into the light.
, he wants to scream at him, scream it from all the rooftops of England, including the top of St. Paul's Cathedral, he himself sitting on the very tip. He must've given the tiniest of nods, and before he knew what was happening he has his lap full of John Watson, who is now tugging him by the collar of his halfway opened shirt and bringing their lips together almost violently.
More of their troop fell to the poison smoke and threw their arms over their faces. The first coughed so heavily that they sank to the ground. They needed to get out of there! John ran to lead the way until they arrived around the fountain at Piccadilly Circus.
Now he was once again in nearly complete darkness, except for the dim light of a little lamp, and he was feeling the beginnings of a headache creeping between his temples. Anthea was reading a book in a foreign language with one hand and held out a bottle of water for John with the other. John tossed down half of it in one big gulp, starting to feel feeling more alive. He tried to focus on that, the little, positive things, and tried to blend out the worry and anger nagging on the back of his head. Anger at being toyed with and thrown around like cats do with mice. Worry at the thought of Sherlock Holmes. The Woman had said he would be fine. Could he believe even one word she had said?
Sherlock looked over and their eyes locked. They had not lost a word of Janine Hawkins. Whether he had seen her striking him down with a smile on her face or deduced it later on, it did not matter much now.
"Personally, I mean. Have you ever met this..." And he hoped to get the name together correctly, "Sherlock Holmes?"
Sherlock feels so dramatic right now, he wants to peel off all his skin and leave his human shell, it's all too heavy. Let him die.
John continues to murmur into his soft skin. "You know, sometimes it still feels like absence when you're in that big head of yours. I know you're here with me, but it's always unsettling if I know you're not there when I call your name."
"One of my theories. The transfer of energy of an organic matter into a lifeless one." He stood with his hands on his hips. "Needless to say, it didn't work."
Sherlock let out the dramatic sigh of impatience. "Because I couldn't. There was a spell on the door, obviously, broken by you walking through it. Thanks for that, by the way." He glanced around the room. "But this is not the time. We have to be careful now. With any luck, they haven't heard us yet."
Pleasure pools in his lap, and he is harder than he can remember ever having been before, his skin so sensitive from the harsh material of John's jeans. He feels this strong urge building up inside him, leading him to think about ripping John's trousers off to feel his throbbing erection against his own, and
Him. Right there in front of him, and sometimes the detective is like an open book to him. That is all he needs to have.
John felt a bit stupid about it, but despite being fairly occupied with running around, being introduced to all the other dancers who were there today, dismissed this injury and that injury, for it was, in fact, just a broken nail or a mild bruise, his mind would always shift back to his mysterious detective and what he might be doing right now. Having some fun on his own? It was so odd to think that before yesterday he hadn't even heard of him, familiar with the name only because he had read it in a newspaper article. And now, one day later, he had freed him from the basement of a woman of witchcraft, something he had neither really believed nor not believed in, and worked at the same place as the detective's landlady. He, of all people in London, who had to know Sherlock Holmes far better than he did, was now the one to bear his darkest secret. It was unclear to him yet if this was honourable and if that meant he was somehow special, or if that marked the beginning of the end of him.
Running after him, he suddenly jumped backwards as Magnussen's body froze. Stopped right in his very movements, he looked like he was frozen in time. John wondered for a second if it was him who had lost his mind, but then he noticed a purple aura around the man, zipping like electric sparks through a lilac lens. His face looked horrified. The eyes were bulging out of their sockets and he made a strangled noise as if someone was trying to gag him. Then he collapsed to the floor. The clunking sound of metal echoed from the walls as the iron bar met the floor. John bent down to take the weapon back and be armed with at least something. Little pearls of sweat were tickling his temples. The warm air went straight to his head. When he straightened his back again, a silhouette was emerging from the shadows.
Sherlock sat opposite him with his long legs crossed, John had one leg stretched and the other bent while the flickering torch was resting between them, held upright by his hand.
But as much as John wanted to object, all the consulting detective had to do was to tilt his head in a certain way and furrow his brows, and already John was feeling foolish for having tried to object in the first place. He let out a long-suffering groan again, and the eye slid into his breast pocket with ease. Sherlock looked at him with satisfaction before he stepped back and held one hand over his other eye so that all you could see of him was a tall body with pale skin and a hollow eye socket. He seemed truly frightening then, half-hidden by the shadows, with a big black hole in his face, all black and white. He looked like a ghost. As mysterious and gorgeous as he looked simply horrifying.
Mrs Hudson seemed to have watched John was taking it all in and she was looking at him tenderly. "Quite impressive, is it not?"
"So how long did Sherlock hide you from us? He does that, you know. When he wants a thing all for himself. You can't really blame him. I blame it on his brother a bit. Difficult relationship with those two."
She just left them to these words and walked away to the fading sound of her heels. At first, John was angry. He thought this was about him and Mycroft. He thought this was about him keeping his distance from Sherlock. Then he opened the envelope.
The world kept spinning around. John tried to keep himself steady enough to finally gain back some focus, and when his glassy eyes stopped rolling back into his head, they focused on the figure that had crashed through the door.
"Sherlock, sorry. I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?" He hears John's soft, apologetic voice over the droning noises chasing each other in his head.
Sherlock led them through narrow alleys and over stone and buildings where people would call after them and swing their fists in fury. It was like being a young boy again, and forgotten was the real danger behind the chase. John could pretend it was the foolish game of running for his life without actually having anything real to fear. Nothing but to lose a race. Not once did Sherlock let go of his hand this time, as if they were chained to each other, but John found that he didn't mind. It felt like something solid. Something to rely on. Because Sherlock Holmes, as it turned out, knew London like a map was pinned to the back of his head. How the inside of the man's head might look like ...
John looked up at her, and finished securing the bandage around her foot blindly while he held the other hand out to her. "Sometimes I just go by John. Nice to meet you."
"He's a vampyre," the detective breathed like a man who couldn't deny to have seen the devil. "Moriarty is a vampyre."
The hot water is washing away the sweat he knows must be spreading all over his body by now, caused by the sheer thoughts of John's hands on him.
John has kissed him. John has kissed him on multiple occasions today, more times than would be acceptable to write off as a mistake or an accident. And Sherlock has kissed him, absolutely out of his own control. This should scare him more. They have been kissing –
Clouds were shoving one another in front of the sun, making the sky appear like a chaos of grey, blue and white. A weather almost as English as the storm that had accompanied him for the first part of his ride, and one John Watson could as well approve of. One could nearly conjecture where the famous outline of familiar London might have hidden behind dark clouds of the steam the train breathed out. Being back here at last always felt like coming home, even though home was rather associated more with people than places.
And when John speaks again, his voice is so calming, so smooth that Sherlock wants to declare every single person who would not feel the urge to drown themselves in this voice out of their mind. He listens very closely when John continues.
, the sensitive skin up, up his thighs. He whispers names into all of those spots, lets them sink into his flesh and travel to his chest where they can burn and glow and melt his insecurities with flickers of bliss.
He noticed how wide Sherlock's eyes had become once he looked up in shock over his volume. "Would you," he looked around, "keep your voice down a bit?" Despite the still lingering fear of being overheard a grin stole itself on John’s face.
What were the chances the door would not be locked? With his free hand John reached for the doorknob as his curiosity won him over once again. His fingers closed around the cold material, hesitating for a second. There was no turning back. The door whined quietly as he turned the knob and gave it a light push.
Not to value the gift that had been given to humanity, the gift of being healthy and loved. Suddenly, he wondered if one's mindset could only come to this conclusion when one did not know what it was like … Being valued, loved. Only knew what it was like to be alone. What that had to be like, not feeling alive? Not having flesh, nor bone, nor cells or a heart. Being an engine. But now John was reminded of something else.
She had to be burning internally, burning up with the desire to hurt him, kill him for what he had done. It was an act she mastered so well that John was almost willing to forget. And if she comforted him in the illusion that even her smile was innocent, she had to be truly dangerous.
He hesitated. With his head bowed it was hard to tell what he was thinking. Eventually, he did speak up, his voice smaller than before. "Why?"
Thanks for reading, as always. Feedback is appreciated (just like the solar system). How often can I bring that joke?
The grin never leaves John's face and he gives a nod towards the book laying on the living room table. He walks over to it, carefully lets his flat hand slide over the front to fully reveal the cover of the seemingly brand new book underneath a bunch of papers, letters and note sheets. "
"If you want to put it like that. He was certainly the most useful of the Yarders, given that this is not a particularly difficult art to master."
From one's capturing hands into the next pair, John thought bitterly. He seemed to have a gift for these sort of things. Looking back down the hole, a part of him hoped to see Irene climbing out of it. But there was no sign of her.
He does. Sherlock looks at him, reacts when John calls his name, and there is this pure seriousness in John's gaze that is like steel, but only if steel can be liquid and warm. Warm, hot, liquid steel, and he means it. And he wants it. And that is just too much for Sherlock. So he has to kiss him right now.
John's smile after this is honest and a little sad. He clearly tries to overplay the obvious anxiety that makes his Adam's apple bob as he swallows with amusement. "Well... I was hoping," he is gesturing between the two of them, "...you know?"
Only seconds later he wanted to punch himself for this. After swallowing this urge, John retreated from this scene as fast as he could.
Sherlock's eyes were wide open and blue. He was staring into a pair full of aquamarine water, one side sprinkled with two drops of amber. They hadn't been there before, the sprinkles and the tears. His replica had not captured him in all that he was. From then on he knew. He knew this was Sherlock Holmes,
After taking off her polished boots, she was slightly shorter than John himself. Her gaze was focused on him as if she was challenging him to look at her with the same interest that she herself was channeling through her eyes. John had a hard time trying not to furrow his brows. He wanted to appear professional here, and as a competent doctor one should not be confused by their patient. By the time she had shrugged off the red coat, there wasn't a lot she was wearing. It was a black, short dress, looking rather expensive. Something like silk wandered all the way around her waist, breaking into a black tutu. He had to have been staring now because Mary chuckled lightly before she sat down again.
John caught himself about to let out a laugh. "Working? Come on, I just moved back here. And look at me. Who would want me for an employee?"
Carefully but decisively Rosie is pressed against Sherlock’s chest, whose instinctive reaction it is to hold her to him and keep her safe. But he still only blinks back at John with insecurity behind his eyes. This is why he used to be more careful. So that he wouldn’t fuck this up again.
Drumrolls, everybody. The final chapter. It's fair to say it did not end exactly as I had planned it, and I absolutely love that about writing longer pieces. What you're about to read is the conclusion of a two-year project that I started out of a challenge with myself (aka NaNoWriMo) to let a vague idea come to life. While I wrote the first 50k words within one month, the rest of it was much slower. But I did it! Officially not a WIP anymore!!
Sherlock was behind him, shooting another vampyre that was trying to enter through the broken window. There were shots all around him as the woman who had just burst through the door and her troop of ten knights kept shooting the creatures.
"Apologise?" John looked at him with a frown. Sherlock was not an apologetic person, even if there was something to be sorry for. But this one came out of the blue for him.
John, no matter how much he hated it, saw his point very clearly. Come what will, even with Sherlock Holmes on his dying bed, there was no arguing with him. Every part of himself was telling him to go against it and he was giving him a sharp nod.
"First of all," he walked around his desk, on which notes and letters were already piling up, and poured himself a cup of coffee, "my name is not Graham. It's
John, or rather John's body, decided that for now it was the best option to trust the detective once more. "If she is not dead, then where is she?"
"I'm sorry, Dr Watson, you've come to us at the wrong time and got caught up in all this," Lestrade began his own apology when he suddenly looked up to Sherlock again, "And could you bloody acknowledge my full name for once?" He continued in a barely audible mumbling Sherlock used to talk over. "Knows every fact under the sun and can't even remember three bloody letters in the right order..."
A woman's voice from behind the counter startled him for a second, and he looked up into brown eyes. She did not exactly look like she was working here, her curly hair untamed and jumping whenever she moved her head, her clothes black and white.
"The point is if you're asking why I never came to you to let you know I was back, maybe you can answer that question for yourself."
Sherlock raised his arm high up in the air and out shot a hook with a rope long enough to reach from where Sherlock's hand had been to the edge of the roof above. He was holding John, pressing him closer and John was wrapping his arms around his shoulders.
Yes, I know, I know. No cheap excuses. (But I have been very stressed and not in the best of moods.)
"Alright, everyone!" Sally Donovan stepped forward, leaving the side of the inspector with whom she had stood by the door for the entire length of this chaotic reunion. "Jesus has risen from the grave, we are all very happy, can we move on now, and put our minds back to the major problems?"
They sat together like this for a few hours more. He always forgot the time in Sherlock's company, but he never forgot himself. It worked pure wonders on him. If he had looked back for a moment, he would see that he didn't know that man he had been a week ago. A total stranger, a dead man, resurrected with the help of something, someone who did not even have a heart anymore, was living on cogs and metal. This was what happened to him. And what did that sound like?
He can only barely open his mouth until John invades his personal space, still grinning smugly, getting Sherlock to lose his voice (which in itself is something to get admired for, to be honest) and tilts his head a little.
"He had me," she murmured, and then, louder, "Parts of me. I remember everything, but it was always a foreign substance that I felt my body shuddering against. I multiplied and multiplied to keep the bits of myself that were still clean, but it has left me weak."
They did as the inspector said. Walking down that same hall, standing in the same lift. Alone this time. The air was charged with something that was hard to define. John did not feel as tense today, and even the darkness had lost its gloominess. This was now known territory to him, it was something he had taken in once and now it belonged to him. Instead, what he felt when they were walking through the stone hall was excitement. He wanted to know all that Sherlock knew. Maybe now they would have a bit more time for him to ask. Sherlock had to have a reason to become what he became.
"You cannot even fathom all the things you do not know about," he said, making it sound like a threat. He was probably good at threatening people. Well, with John he would have to put in a little more effort.
"Holmes, there you are!" Lestrade greeted them, looking a bit impatient but genuinely glad to see them.
"Take one of my dressing gowns for the night. Wardrobe to the left. Fold your clothes for tomorrow. I have nothing tailored in your size here, so you will need your own clothes to look presentable."
"I am serious. This time you will sit in a hansom with me instead of driving it, you hear me? There are a few things you haven't told me yet."
"Look," John says, and he almost whispers, "Sherlock, I just- I'm just not sure where you are right now, and I know you can be confusing sometimes, but are you- is that about a case? Is Mary a client or a murderer or is she …someone you want to forget?"
Only now that he had the peace and quiet of a cab ride alone, he realised that he had not asked a lot of questions any rational man would have asked after being called
She pushed him back slightly, grip on both his shoulders. But unlike last time, her aura did not scream killer, and the thing that was most intimidating about this was not her but the bronze hammerhead closest to the glass. The tiny, lifeless eyes of a caught animal.
John could feel the excitement quietly tingling under his skin. He felt him wherever they touched, where they connected and his body was warm.
Sherlock, exhausted as he is now, almost lets himself fall into his arms and sighs a sigh of absolutely lightheaded relief. "I love you, too."
Before he decided to take Sherlock's offer from earlier and make his way into his bedroom to turn in for the night, somehow he remembered that he still wanted to clear up a matter before morning would break.
– but something about it calms and provokes him at the same time. He picks up the half-emptied mug of cold tea and thinks this over on his walk to the kitchen sink.
And so they ran. John trusted Sherlock to somehow get them out of here, following blindly, as a soldier would a leader. The front door was already covered with nasty spiders, so the only way was up, up the large spiral staircase. Then Sherlock tripped. John almost fell over him but caught himself and pulled him up in a single breath, as if they had done it a thousand times before. The first floor had too many rooms, door by door flying by, and Sherlock stopped. John almost bumped into him, Sherlock looked into a room and ran again. Once more, running, stopping, looking, running. Slowly but surely John got the feeling that maybe he should not have trusted him all that blindly.
Meanwhile, Sherlock Holmes was still playing the lone wolf, appearing to be daydreaming somewhere in the corner where no one would pay any attention to him. Only John knew better than to assume his thoughts had anything to do with dreaming at all. He walked up to him only to be ignored. Not like he had expected anything else.
He had probably been in the living room all night (playing the violin?) and made his plans. Probably grateful for some hours alone. He did not seem to be around people a lot. Or, perhaps, all this time he had been forced to suffer practically imprisoned needed to be made up for by some company. Now company was a room apart, sitting in his bed that felt like sleeping on clouds compared to John's own sloppy mattress. The thick blanket had kept him cosy and warm, and the silk linen was soft on his skin. He had fallen asleep within seconds. With the covers now slipping down and pooling in his lap, his torso was left bare and cold. He was only wearing his long white knickers and a dark red dressing gown of Sherlock’s. There was a very special smell to it that was not unpleasant at all.
He was leaning down to rest his forehead against John's. He was not warm and he was not cold. Yes, what was he?
John loves the winks, too, but he is too busy staring at that paused video in frustration to see it.
John is waiting in this charged air of silence, maybe having realised what he just said, maybe not. Sherlock tips his chin up and obeys.
“First of all,” he manages then, “I don’t think I want a wife and children, thank you very much. And maybe… maybe I’m not that serious when I call you things like that.”
her viewers. I followed every one of her damn steps, but so far instead of this," he points at the perfectly braided hair on the screen, "it looks more like a bird's nest if anything."
John hums, seemingly pleased with himself, as Sherlock's head falls back and a low groan escapes his throat. The twinge in his lower stomach grows stronger, and the wanting has long stopped scaring him.
"Yes," Sherlock said, a little too huskily. "Yes. I explained that … I explained that there was one significant weakness to him and his plans. He has to keep murdering or hire people to do it for him. Since we know that this is inevitable to create more subjects like me, we can find a way to prevent it and destroy his web before it's built."
"You tell me where you wanna go," his cranky voice told him through a set of yellow teeth, "I tell you when we arrive."
Sherlock's hand moved to his face to take the skin at the edge of his jawline between his fingers. He pulled the pale material upwards to reveal silver metal underneath. John knitted his brows in slight disgust, but the last thing he wanted to do was looking away as the man effectively skinned himself. Sherlock only stopped right below his cheekbone and then smoothed it down again until the illusion of a human face was adjusted.
