Cas rests his fingers against Dean’s brow, the touch lingering a moment longer than normal. When he pulls away, Dean doesn’t feel any different. His legs continue to visibly tremor, his vision blurring and beginning to fritz.
A few faces turn toward him, but Dean recognizes only one of them from the news. He breathes out relief. “Libby.”
“Yes, honey,” Sam says, giving her a peck on the cheek. Cas clears his throat, looking at Rowena, and Dean stares at him, wondering whether Cas’s really bothered by her and Sam’s fake affair.
Dean isn’t lonely. He could find a roommate, if he really wanted to. But it wouldn’t be the same. There’s something about Castiel that made these mundane actions all… achingly familiar. Comfortable in ways that rang harmonious with people Dean has loved and left in his past.
He finds Cas in the library, folded uncomfortably into one of its chairs, Sam’s laptop sitting open on the table in front of him. Dean can see his face as he approaches, see the way Cas has his eyes closed, his elbows perched on the arm rests. His hands are crossed over his waist.
Outside the car, the brothers are quietly arguing. Castiel cranes to listen, but he only picks out a partial phrase from Sam:
Dean angles his head back but it’s too late: this is happening. Garth leans in like a car crash, his lips moist and puckered, mouth slow-mo mashing into the matching spot on Dean’s face.
a failure, because he has no idea how to make his best employee realize his own value and importance to the team.
Cas’ hand envelopes his then, their fingers entwined, and Dean bucks on reflex, on the thought that Claire and Patience and the rest of them are within sight, that they might not know, that Claire might not like—
With the calendar now open, the five-minute warning pops up with a jaunty chime, its counter marking the minutes remaining to the meeting in red.
“Hey, Dean,” his boss begins over the phone line. “Just letting you know that Raph has decided to move Bart onto another project, effective immediately.”
The morning couples activities shunt Sam and Cas off to a yoga class together, while Dean ends up in a scrap-booking class with Garth. When the instructor asks for each couple to provide their own photos, Garth reaches beneath the table and pulls out a disturbingly elaborate photo album of he and Dean on their wedding day. Dean flips through the pages of the album, face pale as he surveys the stetson hats and matching fringed jackets Garth picked out for their would-be biggest day.
Dean was in the kitchen, making an omelette. He paused in his peppers chopping to frown at Cas. “What makes you think that?”
Castiel holds his breath and squeezes closed his eyes, waiting for the ache he feels to pass, that longing for everything he left behind on earth clenching his heart like a fist.
“The training site is on an acreage outside the city. By Bart’s instructions, we will be driven out there early morning and stay there through the afternoon.” Castiel’s brow lift. “Oh, good. Lunch will be supplied.”
“I don’t have a dog for a reason,” Dean grumbles, as he wraps the pot of daisies in newspaper and packs it carefully into a cardboard box for transport.
He was ready to write the whole thing off as a hallucination when a text came through, describing Cas’ address. Dean checked it out on a map app and found it surprisingly close by. That set off another wild rhythm in Dean’s chest, his heart hammering out of line at the thought of visiting Cas.
There’s a moment where the air between them hangs electric, where Dean forgets that he’s angry and he hangs on the cusp of a bright, involuntary smile. But then Dean’s brain kicks in and he remembers. His gut sinks, forcing the instinctive happiness down and far, far away.
Halfway through updating the testing instructions on the work order, Dean’s nose comes back online, drawing him away from the screen. He sniffs deeply, scenting garlic and onions and something acidic wafting from the kitchen. Leering back over his shoulder, Dean tries to spy what’s cooking from his poor vista in the living room. “Is that pasta sauce?”
“It’s Dijwar’s men,” the queen shouts at him, catching Dean up despite how his mind rebels against it. A companion drops back to arm her, passing the queen a scabbard adorned in rubies that glitter blood-red.
Dean trudges back through the ditch, aiming for Claire and the Impala. He spares a glance backward that he does not want to give, just enough to confirm that Cas isn’t following him, that Cas hasn’t been swayed.
“Shotgun shuts her pie hole,” Dean warns again, swatting Claire’s hand away from the tuner. “So long as I’m driving you’re not picking the tape.”
Dean fetches the corkscrew from the junk drawer and digs through the fridge for the jar of shakeable parmesan lodged in the back of the bottom shelf. Castiel handles the uncorking while Dean coats his pasta with an extra layer of cheese. With Castiel’s approval, he unpauses the television, and they both settle in to watch Dr. Sexy as they eat.
Castiel pauses with his mouth open. He then blurts: “I’m worried we’ll go back to fighting, now that we’re at the office again.”
“Well, no,” Donna admits. “Jody called for backup, something about getting some kids up on their feet again. But you all are following us back down to Sioux Falls, am I right? There’s still that barbeque I distinctly remember you reneging on.”
Jack shakes his head. “I’m sorry, Castiel. But Heaven will no longer interfere in the realm of humanity. Your help is needed here.”
“Alright.” Castiel said. “Just let me start a load of laundry. I’ll be with you in less than a minute.”
Castiel can sense the pride in Naomi and the others for their accomplishment, the flaws in this world skirted carefully over in favour of claiming a job well done.
The end of day comes. They exchange goodbyes, same as always, parting ways as though the fabric of the team hasn’t irrevocably changed. There’s little time spared on more meaningful farewells; everyone knew this day was coming, the loss of another legacy member, even if they weren’t certain when.
As Dean investigates the web services request, he finds it tied into some real old segments of code, stuff that he hasn’t looked at in a year or more. He has to really dig through the function dependencies to understand it, which of course means he gets so invested in said digging that he loses track of time. By the time Dean looks up from his desktop, his eyes stinging from staring so long at the screen, it’s dark outside and on the cubicle floor.
A sharp gasp ghosts Dean’s cheek and Cas then crumbles, the breath rushing out of him as he lands heavily atop Dean. Dean snakes a hand between them, and with a few rough tugs he finishes, come splashing beside Cas’ across the belly of his shirt.
Dean falters. He drags a finger over his chin, collecting a loose gush of ketchup off his face. “It doesn’t matter,” he says, once he’s swallowed.
“We’re good,” the queen agrees. To Cas, she says, “I will see you again should we need another sapling.” With a coquettish look to Dean, she adds, “Have fun with my husband, oh lover boy.”
Val drops her gaze back to the apples, long enough that she can finish facing the section and pack her emptied boxes onto the cart. She wheels by the front bakery instead of heading to the back, earning a scowl from her supervisor, Josh, over at the deli counter, but Val pays him no heed as she faces the displays on her way.
Behind him, along the length of his back, is the weight of another's body. Solid. Warm like a bonfire. A soft cheek rests against his shoulder, breath stirring the fine hairs along Dean’s neck.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean mutters. His gentle taps against Cas’ cheek work up into a fever pace, his fingers bringing a flush to Cas’ skin. “Wake up, wake up.”
Truthfully, Agent Doug-or-Douglas has been in here often enough that he shouldn’t rattle Ricky anymore, particularly because the guy tries his best to seem unassuming. Then again, anybody who had to stare up at a guy that tall would probably do a double-take too.
“Thanks.” Dean spits it out, sarcastic, although he really means it. If it weren’t for his coworkers, Dean doubts he would’ve lasted so long beneath the constant sting of rejection.
Sam smiles and then fiddles with a pitcher on the side table, passing him a small plastic cup of ice water. Castiel braces Sam’s hand with the one of his not currently wrapped up in tape.
They give Castiel back his belongings, shortly before he’s been discharged. An attendant hands over a clear bag containing his clothes, as well as a stack of care instructions that weigh as much as a small tome. Dean takes the papers, then takes off for the car. The bag rests on Castiel’s thighs as Sam wheels him out to the parking lot.
The sheets are wrong, too. Softer, maybe, with a higher thread count, in shades of cream and blue. There are also less pillows. A lighter comforter. Dean almost misses the comforting weight of his blankets at home, but the smell of these sheets abates it somewhat.
Dean hums, noncommittal. Cas isn’t dead and Jack’s still AWOL, so nothing’s keeping Dean here. He pushes off from the table, but Cas touches at his wrist before he can get away.
“Hey, Dean-o.” Bart’s voice is puddle-deep and beaming, ready to schmooze far too early in the day. “How’ve you been? Listen, I’ve been trying to get ahold of your new SA, but something doesn’t seem to be working. Is his extension set up in the system wrong? He’s not showing up in the address book.”
Alarmed, Castiel looks up to find Dean already crossed to his side of the desk. “Dean, are you okay? You look pale.”
Dean kept his shoulders lowered, his breathing calm, despite how it scared him to have an alpha beyond his line of sight. It was crazy, but Dean could feel the barest of breaths on the back of his neck. It set off a knee-jerk response inside of him, begging him to run for the door.
“Kurt,” Hank says baldly. “Son. All you need to know about ‘these Winchesters’ is they’ve earned their peace.” He snaps open a fresh page of his sudoku book, his knuckles running firmly down the crease. “This town knows all they need to know about them. Write this week’s opinion piece on something else.”
Cas watches him, quiet, caught in the same silence that had crowded in on them in the Impala, the air so tight with tension that Dean could barely breathe. Dean can’t stand the way Cas looks at him, so he tents his legs and folds his arms atop his knees, tucking away his face. He breathes loosely into the shadow of his arms, watching his vision spark while the tremors slowly fade.
And then Cas was flipping the script; he hooked his arms beneath Dean’s arms and hefted upward, pulling Dean back until he was seated upright on Cas’ cock.
“No, thank you,” Castiel murmurs absently, fixated on a back burner pot threatening to boil. “I’ve put in a lot of practice to get even halfway good at this. I’m not going to let some amateur come in and mess me up.”
They drive out in a trio of vehicles. Max and Cas use the rest of the team to approximate the location of any tokens, and together they manage to knock out an additional four by time they come across the distant field that should have held the aunt’s house.
Castiel closes his eyes. He doesn’t need to meet the man’s eyes; he has already memorized their shade of green. “Dean.”
Castiel blinks. “Um.” He buys time by reviewing the bouquet in question. “The office felt I deserved ‘a goddamn prize’ for convincing you to stay in bed for two days. Even when I pointed out that it wasn’t that difficult, and you did all the work.”
Dean merely moans around his forkful, tastebuds bursting like fireworks across his mouth. A private part of him thrills at the pink hue rising on Castiel’s cheeks in response to the noises he’s making, the same part of him that keeps chanting
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says again, though it’s too late to even try to make amends. Dean doesn’t need any more of the pittances he’d share.
“What, with that chicken wing?” Dean smiled and nudged Cas’ bad arm with his shoulder. “Just get in the car. I wouldn’t trust that two-dollar poncho to stand up much longer beneath this rain.”
“She’s right, Dean,” Sam says. “Now that I’m looking, you kinda seem a little ragged. Have you been getting enough sleep?” He pokes at the skin beneath his own eyes in emphasis, drawing his finger down.
The book slams shut, thumping to the war room table. Cas looks around, then above him, readying his scythe. He drops into a defensive position. “Prepare yourselves,” he announces.
Cas hums, kissing again at Dean’s shoulder. His hands rub soothing circles above Dean’s hips. “Feeling up for the game tonight?”
Castiel fails to see how he could possibly ‘not worry’ about it. He grunts with frustration. “How am I supposed to get over my ‘whole thing’ if half of my family is ignoring me for it?”
She increases the oxygen in his intubation and raises the head of his hospital bed. She encourages him to breathe while she describes what she is about to do. The tape around his mouth gets removed, ripping away with a healthy sprinkling of stubble. The pressure in his throat decreases and then increases, and with a deep breath the intubation is withdrawn, coughed through until his mouth is suctioned clean.
Dean’s fork bites into the dessert, the pie crust flaking into perfection. “Holy shit,” he says. “I take back everything I said.”
“Not interested,” Dean growled, annoyed that he had hobbled away from his heat bed for this. Especially since the instant of catching the man’s scent was only worsening his symptoms. Dean tightened his bathrobe over his chest, as if that would mask his current situation, hiding the overwarm skin Dean already had exposed and keeping his impromptu desire at bay.
In the garden that once was the throne room, Castiel sits in his favoured spot, contemplating. With his courage summoned, he bows his head and prays.
The SA they hired—if they hired one at all—must have gone to a more important project. Lord knows legacy is hardly a blip on the radar, these days.
“Cas,” Dean manages to shout, once Sam grabs him, Jack taking his other arm as they both haul him away. The gap between them grows too rapidly, Dean losing him again— “Cas!”
“Just saying,” says Miriam, gathering by the cubby the instant Dean slinks out to get some coffee, “if you’re not feeling great, you could always take a vacation day.”
“Uh, no actually—” Doug begins, though he backtracks as soon as he sees the color draining from Ricky’s face. “I mean, yes, I’ll take it, of course, thank you, but—well. I have to ask for something unusual this time.”
Without thinking too deeply about it, Dean tossed the tomato pots into passenger side wheel well, bowing their heads down to fit inside the vehicle.
Dean sighs heavily. “Yeah,” he says. He knows. It’s not enough that they averted a crisis; they have to justify wanting to avert it in the first place.
When Dean wakes up, his chronic headache is gone. For the first time in days, he hasn’t woken sore and strained, his heartbeat driving a dull throbbing behind his eyes.
In an instant, the two creatures on the porch come rushing for him. Mary and Sam steady their guns, but Cas flares one hand out at them, warning them off. “Don’t. Not yet.”
“Easy, easy,” says the man with long hair, soothing, at the same time the other man is telling him, “Pin his arms down, damnit, he’s gonna rip out the IV—”
“One last chance to bring your truck back,” Dean tells him idly, even though they’re already neck-deep into Oregon, with the Idaho border coming up a couple hours ahead.
The drive is quiet, the silence uneasy. Sam is researching something on his tablet, and glancing frequently at Castiel in the rear view mirror. Dean is glancing at him too, though his expression is far less friendly. Castiel suspects he’s still upset about the werewolf hunt gone wrong. One that apparently almost killed Castiel.
Dean blinks, pushing sleep from his eyes. He turns down the TV, dropping the room beneath the din of the storm outside, and then pushes up until he can crane his neck towards the laptop across the gap between their beds.
Three cancellations in a row counted as an emergency, right? Dean’s thumb hovered over the call button, ready to tumble down that rabbit hole.
Sure enough, Claire’s red car rounds the corner not long later, Sam’s F-150 following in her wake. Dean spies Kaia in Claire’s front seat, the two of them rolling their eyes and grinning over something being shared with Max and Alicia in the back. His gaze wanders to where Sam has parked, catching on Cas and Jack as they climb out.
Sam runs into him in the hall, brandishing a machete and massive bedhead. Without fully waking, Dean first greets him like an enemy, then course-corrects his blade’s lethal arc by a quarter inch and throws himself back against the door. Deafened by the alarms, Sam gives him a bewildered look instead of shout, to which Dean replies with an equally baffled expression. No better off from it, they rush together toward the main hall.
Some time later—Heaven does not experience time as it passes on Earth, so he cannot be certain when—Castiel catches snippets of another man’s voice echoing in his ears.
Dean glances between the two sides of the boardroom, gaze flickering between Castiel and their CEO, piecing together what his gut knows to be true.
Twenty-six families that have been left hanging, perpetually wondering what happened to that gap-tooth grin or bowl-cut that they used to tuck into bed. They’ll never know whether little Tommy ever really needed those braces they were trying to save for, or if Suzie ever grew into those ears. Answers will never come for these kids or their loved ones. Time got up and left them all behind.
“And look at you, fella.” Donna pulls up beside Cas and pinches his cheek. “Looking a little peaky at the edges, aren’t ‘cha?”
“He is,” Castiel says, smiling at Dean. “When Dean puts his mind to something, it’s going to be handled easily.”
That sets off the giggles inside Dean. He drops Cas’ hand, narrowing as stern a look as he can manage at Cas, under such conditions. “It’s a joke, Cas. Just messing around.”
Dean shakes his head. His fingers are numb, cold. “There’s gotta be something we can do. Some way we can keep you on legacy.”
Dean raps his knuckles one last time against the table. He then bucks himself up and takes out his keys, brusquely leaving the dining room. “C’mon, then. Let’s get your truck.”
They luck out and find Castiel’s truck where Dean abandoned it, on the day Castiel was killed. Dean had driven it up to the patch of forest he had cleared cutting wood for Castiel’s pyre. The truck had been pushed in past the stumps Dean had left, and covered with pine branches.
Somehow, while he waited, Dean’s heat wasn’t cresting in an overbearing wave, at least not in the way that had left him so broken the night before. Instead, he felt his heat building, slow and steady, into something that felt more akin to pleasure than distress. It still felt stupid, that Dean had frayed far enough to dare reach out to AS, but it no longer felt like a mistake.
Dean hummed noncommittally, skipping the sandwich and heading straight for the pastries. Two bites in and the strawberry tart was singing on his heightened tastebuds.
Dean nods, his eyes falling closed. He pushes himself upright and attempts to hold the glass and painkillers she feeds to him, his hands shaking throughout. He exhales on a heavy breath, and then settles again around Cas. “Jody here?”
As the day of the axe throwing encroaches, Dean checks in with Inias and Anael to ensure they are okay working with reduced staff that Friday. Both have already said they’re fine staying behind, but Dean doesn’t want to assume that they won’t change their minds.
“Yeah, well.” Dean gestured skyward, exposing his face to the onslaught of the storm. “What else would we expect.”
Tucking himself away from her attention, Castiel perches on the edge of a salt-limned dock, between a flat pole fishing rod and a tangle of fishing nets. His hands fold together as he stares down at the sparkling blue water, receding with the low tide. He has much to think about.
Dean draws back his hand, hiding it beneath the blankets. He watches Castiel calm himself, alone, all the warmth of his demeanor falling away.
They’re all tense with nerves, watching. Dean crowds up beside Cas, feeling his tension as he leans into Cas’ shoulder. Cas nudges back before leaning stiffly against him, his gaze trained on Jack’s retreating form.
Val raises her chin, angling out with confidence. “Back section, by the eggs and dairy.” She heads out, pointing them down the correct path to take.
“Hey, Bitch,” Dean says distractedly, shaking out a box of noodles into a pot of boiling water. He saves the packet of powdered sauce at the last minute, plucking it out from the roiling steam, and licks his fingers to stave off any burns he got during rescue and recovery.
The look of Cas now brought Dean back to that waiting room, to how Cas had looked beneath those flickering fluorescent lights: fragile and small, inconsolably human; ageless and endless and incapable of comprehending how any arm could be broken, let alone his.
But so long as he can keep it up for the short term, he can loosen the reins later. Things can go back to the way they were before BEAU and Castiel ever stepped foot into his life.
“Need to,” Dean mumbles. He rubs at his face, the corners his mouth downturned. “Fucked up the last time at P&I.”
Cas must sense this edge within him, though mercifully he doesn’t bring it attention. He merely tilts up Dean’s head and tucks his mouth against Dean’s temple, murmuring, “I love you, Dean. That will always, always be true.”
On one such day, when the hour slotted for a BEAU meeting enters into its third hour, and Miriam and Inias and
As badly as he wishes he could blame Bart for his leadership not working out, what Castiel feels most like right now is a failure. He
“I want you to watch this,” Garth chokes out, anguished, eyes glassy as he surveys the dearly gathered. “
she’s biting back. He nods to her, his brows lifted with contrition, the best he can do to say that he’s sorry for that too.
“Yeah. It’s great.” Claire rolls her eyes, glances aside. “Patience is still working through her correspondence courses. Told her to take the summer off, but she insists on doing them.”
Overhead, the mess hall speakers screech with an awakening microphone. Joyce’s sunshine voice falters briefly as she announces the arrival of another late guest. “Please help me give a big, warm welcome, to Mrs. MacLeod-Winchester!”
“I’ve tried,” Jack says, “and not just on Cas. But my powers can’t fix whatever the perimeter has done.”
“Anyways,” she says, brightening, “back to work. Don’t want to write you up as ‘chit-chatting frivolously’ in my fifteen minute block, boss.”
They talk until Dean’s meal has grown cold and he has to shuttle away the leftovers into a plastic container, maybe to be eaten tomorrow, maybe to grow stale like everything else in the fridge. Dean asks how their hunt for a new apartment is going, and they ask him when he plans on having a social life again outside of work. Dean laughs, but it’s the kind of joke that hits too close to home, and makes for a sour note to end on, considering it’s not long after that they wave their goodbyes and hang up for the night.
Castiel huffed angrily. Metal fragments exploded out from one of the library sconces. Sam scuttled away from the shrapnel with an armful of rare books in tow. From the hall, he shouted, “Whatever it is, can you take it outside?”
Dean waves his hand. “I mean it, Cas. I was… Y’know. An asshole. And you decided you’d had enough of it.”
The last thing Dean sees—from the peripheral of his eye, just as he turns off the bedside light—is Cas crouching like a cowering dog for the corner of Dean’s bed.
?” He squirms until the bottle is back within reach and squirts out a handful of his own, coaxing Cas down until he could take them both in his hand.
“S’fine.” Dean leans back against the cupboard, offside from the carafe of coffee. He watches as Castiel rinses out his mug and prepares a cup of hot water. “Not a coffee guy?”
Dean had driven out with a load of garbage to drop off at the dump. He noticed the plants for much the same reasons as he had noticed the pumpkins, the year before — bright red tomatoes hung ripe on bent vines. A total waste, in Dean’s opinion. At least pick the fruits off before throwing the plants away.
“I wasn’t,” Castiel lied, despite how steam yet clung to his clothes. He amended, “I was only interested in the mechanics of it.”
“Sam, Castiel begins awkwardly, shuffling by where Sam is vacuuming debris from the back seat of the Impala.
Dean exhales hard through his nose. He shuts his eyes and turns his head, evading the next kiss Castiel attempts to give. “Don’t know if I believe you.”
His pocket vibrates. Dean digs out his phone. “Anael’s signed off on the bug. We should be in the clear to finish before production happens.”
“Aren’t you gonna sit with us for lunch?” Miriam asks, after she catches Dean scurrying his sandwich from the break room fridge straight back to his office. She pins her hands to each side of the door frame, like she can physically block him from closing his office door.
Castiel sighed, having observed the same gesture performed by ancestors of Dean’s aeons ago. “I am aware of what you’re doing.”
But Garth just laughs, wiping a napkin across his mouth. “That son of a gun, what are we gonna do with him? But all’s well that ends well, amirite, kemosabes?”
The flat-faced grill of a ‘64 Greenbrier noses its way into the parking lot, rumbling like a brick being dragged between compact cars sixty years her junior. Dean knits his brow and watches blankly as Garth plunks the camper van down beside the Impala, the engine releasing a final, furious growl before being mercifully put down.
“I do,” Cas murmurs, moving his mouth closer. “And I will. Whatever I can have, whatever you can give, I take it all with joy.”
About Mary. About the hard path the brothers travelled to reunite with their mother. About another Charlie and another Bobby. About their own beautiful, imperfect Rowena, and the sacrifice she made.
“I mean, were we?” Pamela opted to be sighted today, and so she glances sidelong at Ash, who seems prickly yet for no discernable reason.
“Oh.” Dean thinks over their first introductions. “Here I was thinking your degree was in Engineering. Were you a teacher for long?”
By time Donnie’s staff has rolled in, the sound system is belting vintage rock, and the room has shaped up into what could almost pass for an off-center, crowdsourced party. The servers on shift give him and Dean’s people odd looks when they grab their aprons and name tags, but for the most part Donnie gets away without any of them prying too deeply into his mindset, keeping silent on the questions that he’d have no chance to reasonably explain.
But after a while, some of the humans grow bored by the constant perfection. Petty fights break out over what the backyard ought to look like. One human grows tired of the constant companionship and locks himself away so wholly that the angels whisk him back to his private heaven. The remaining humans then fuss over his absence, struggling to enjoy the peaks of human experience happening back to back without end.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend.” Castiel pauses beside him, now in front of the elevator. He smiles softly, glancing over at Dean. “I guess it makes sense, all things considered. I should have sensed it about you.”
Miriam whistles quietly as he approaches. From the corner of her mouth, she murmurs to Dean, “He can murder me anytime.”
They keep that pattern up until they’re well beyond the outskirts, Patience and Sam texting each other notes about the changing perimeter, Claire and Alicia parking on side streets and climbing down into ditches, trying to get a clearer idea of where the perimeter yet hangs. When the afternoon heat hits hardest, Dean sends out a group text wrangling them all onto a lunch break at a rundown sandwich chain nearby. Claire deems it too sketch to eat within, so they grab takeout and pile into the parking lot, kicking down the tailgate of Cas’ truck and clambering into the bed.
With a couple deep, gathering breaths, Castiel manages to stand stiffly, and push his chair back into place beneath the table. Dean hovers close by Castiel’s side. He’s not sure what he expects to happen, but Cas feels—fragile. Breakable. Like the wrong look at him might scatter Castiel to the wind.
A branch snaps beneath Dean’s foot, and Castiel darts a glance aside. The axe glides downward, thudding as it strikes the last of the wood pile. He faces Dean fully, his forearm wiped across his brow. His eyes rest on Dean like two chips of ice, bringing with them a deep sense of relief.
“Wait, you know what that is?” Claire makes a face. “Oh god, gross. Just go to the previous picture.”
Cas rounded his flashlight on Dean, likewise scrutinizing. Whatever he saw had him awkwardly transferring the tire iron beneath the poncho, and then reaching out for Dean with his good hand, his middle and index fingers extended.
Dean laughs, shaking his head. “Can probably relate to what I’m going through, with all the questions you get asked by patients.”
The sudden vested interest from Adler regarding legacy’s day to day, asking Dean for feedback regarding Castiel’s work performance in particular for the past couple months. Hard evidence and paper trails that might speak poorly about their soon-to-be ex-SA.
Sam walks over to the room threshold, to the bodies of the fallen, stomping out the last of the smoldering flames. “Let’s find out.”
“Exactly, thank you.” Miriam flaps her hand at him. “What’ll they even do if someone gets injured? There’s no way our insurance covers this.”
Cas drags his mouth across Dean’s and Dean’s breath gutters, the swell of his lip catching on the stubble around Cas’ pink lips, and Dean’s easy, he’s so easy—Cas could ask for his dying breath and Dean would give it to him gladly, would collapse beneath the weight of such a would-be kiss.
Castiel inhaled. Held his breath. The night sky around them seemed to crackle. Dean felt a charge building in the air.
Sighing heavily, Anael removes her luxury coat and spreads it out like a blanket, sitting beside him on the soft grass.
Jack ends up beating him down the stairs. He runs for Cas although he does not hug him. His smile beams bright enough for all of them. “Are you back?” Then, frowning: “How are you back?”
Dean even takes a break at coffee time, for once, grabbing a fresh cup around the same time as Inias and Anael are chatting at the cubby. He joins in their gossiping until he gets a message partway through break, his phone buzzing in his pocket as he refills his cup a second time.
The longer he dwells on it, the more Dean wonders: just how much of what Castiel reported was work that he took credit for? They were Bart’s queries, after all. Nothing fancy. Castiel is a glorified data entry worker, copying numbers from point A to point B. He didn’t deserve a pat on the back for
Hester and Uriel join them in the elevator, a floor up. Beyond exchanging idle pleasantries they all fall silent, nerves collectively kicking in as the elevator carries them upwards again.
Castiel looks away from the second storey of the cabin. He turns to where Dean is waiting for him in the dining room.
“So I’ll cancel my account,” Dean answered, wet against Cas’ neck. “I’ll get my phone right now, if you want me to.”
Finally, he’s had enough of the awkward silence. Smearing at his mouth with the back of his hand, Dean gets up, walks past Cas, and pulls open his door. With his other hand, he gestures broadly for Cas to leave.
Bart provides a cloud folder filled with hyper-polished PowerPoints that describe the benefits of the BEAU project four times over, all without actually saying anything meaningful about the day-to-day impact the project has on its members. Adler provides an even less helpful reply to Dean’s inquiry, advising him to contact Bart for details—like that wouldn’t be the first instinct Dean has while investigating this fresh shitstorm.
Castiel tightened his grip on the steering wheel, straining to keep from leaning into Dean’s touch. The blind need for physical sensation ebbed through him too, though not nearly as strong an impulse as it was in Dean.
Dean nods, hair ruffling against his cheek. He drags his fingers up the length of Castiel’s spine. Lets an ankle hook around a calf muscle here, a hand around a hip there. He feels the weight of Castiel’s body relax, increment by increment, into him, until they are merely two souls pressed together, embracing the comfort of each other in the night.
“Alrighty then,” he says, clapping his hands together. “Into the van with you, come on, come on. Fill up those back seats first.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, his face growing warm. He had tried hard not to think too deeply about it, ever since he made the changes. He scratched at his neck, fumbling for ways he might hide his growing shame.
Dean sobered a bit. He had to keep telling himself that Cas wasn’t his friend, not really. They only knew each other during the four or five days a season when Dean succumbed to a heat.
Castiel took the invitation and climbed into Dean’s lap, settling in with his cock rubbing against Dean’s. Dean groaned, touching his forehead to Castiel’s brow. His hand dropped from Castiel’s hair, taking up grip on Castiel’s cock instead.
Dean scrubs his knuckles into his eye. Scrapes a hand over his face. “S’just—a good job, Sammy. Good money. I like what I’m doing.” It feels dishonest as he says it, even though historically, most days it’s been true.
Heart pounding, Dean keeps his gun trained on the monster beside Jack, ready to fire despite Patience’s forewarning, but the creature seems docile, almost curious. It cranes its neck over Jack’s head, its humanoid face bowed close, sniffing. Dean slows down as they close in, his brain stuttering through its attempts to process the sight before him.
Dean responds to the question violently, muscles seemingly locking him in place. Castiel falls out from Dean’s tepid grip on his elbow, two steps down the hall beyond where Dean has paused. It takes a moment for his body to steady itself outside of Dean’s support. It takes a moment longer to regain the coordination to face Dean again.
“When we meet again,” Castiel reminds him, heart thumping erratically. “If you still want to. I want—I
He jostled his arms around Cas for emphasis, thrilling in the small noise Cas made as he settled in closer, his hands moved to play along the planes of Dean’s back. The warning prickle of his heat simmered low in his belly, a banked ember waiting to be stoked into a flame.
Ryan looks to Maggie, who seems as equally intrigued by the commotion. Together, they approach the source of the smoke gently wafting from the kitchen.
Rowena settles against Sam, draped like he’s a throne for her to luxuriate upon. She toes off her shoes and dumps her feet into Cas’s lap, earning a startled look on the angel’s face. Dean doesn’t think either of them seem put-out enough by the chaos Rowena summons in her wake.
Kurt sours at that, enough that it draws his expression back closer to his usual constipated self. The glare he fires Hank’s way feels familiar too, so Hank calls it a win and leaves it at that.
Once they finish, Patience pulls up the school’s directory and blueprints, and from there she determines the likely exit route from the cafeteria’s location. Sam hacks the traffic cameras nearby, though the footage he finds from the time period in question has been already wiped clean. There isn't even a chunk of video missing from the afternoon when Abbie was abducted.
Cas’ chest rises and falls beneath the covers. Dean pushes himself along the line of him, touching from shoulder to knee. With his body warmed by Cas, Dean lets himself drift.
Dean thinks over the evening, with Alicia and Claire coming together over Millers, all buddy-buddy on the couch, and Patience sidling up to Max in the kitchenette, her flirting lessons acting out in real time. Alicia had laughed and smiled the same as the rest of them, had even tried to pull Cas into the festivities despite his refusal to eat. She seems happy. Safe.
The calls to the courthouse and county office come easier now that they have an agent to collect paperwork in-person. Sam puts in a request for documentation involving missing persons cases in the county, and Cas comes back to the motel with armfuls of intel spanning the past forty years. Patience organizes the records in order of occurrence and begins building a spreadsheet of basic details, looking for any patterns that crop up between the victims in the past two, five, and twenty years.
Dean hums, noncommittal, and measures out a portion of milk for his pasta sauce. There’s not much more he can ask about Sam’s day without brushing up against his duty to maintain client privileges. It’s better if his brother sets the pace about what all he wants to say.
“Driving … ?” Donnie guesses, though he’s interrupted by the rapidfire knocking coming from the front entrance. He shuffles in place, torn between the bar and the rattling door, and settles for retreating to the bar for a notepad. “Can I take your number and call you back?”
His snivelling smile liquidates Dean’s legs, freezing him in place. Dean takes a suckerpunch and falls square over, only Alistair’s grip on the front of his shirt keeping him from hitting the ground.
He revisits the Braeden family home, watching himself watch Dean rake leaves. Thinking of the remorse and regret he felt in turning to Crowley for help instead of Dean.
Castiel’s reunions with the other angels go much the same. Raphael and he have bad blood that requires instantaneous aeons to navigate and bloodlet. With Dumah, Castiel apologizes for having been placed in the situation where he had to take her life. Then Anna, Hester, Hannah—Castiel spends time with each of them, as long as necessary to make amends.
Dean cleared his throat, fished around for something to say. “You did good, putting us on this case. A spirit like that could’ve turned nasty real quick.”
Dean spares Cas a quick nod and then rounds the corner of the farmhouse, coming across the rusting shell of a vintage truck. It sits on rotten tires in front of a covered porch, at the foot of which stands Jack, a tall figure standing beside him.
Dean bites his lip, trying to keep down the belch burning in his chest, the barrier working its way up through him.
“No, it’s good,” Dean said, far too quickly. “Been staving the fever off with aspirin so far. But—yeah. Soon.”
Val exhales deeply. “Extra bucks, definitely. I was working for the guys over at Ray’s farm for a while, but then the guys were, well,
Castiel removed his belt and unzipped his trousers, matching Dean’s pace as they both shuffled down their underwear. Castiel, having had this part down by rote, chose to watch Dean as he shimmied down his boxers and revealed his cock, which was half-hard already.
Dean himself has his face buried in his pillows, clutching for dear life at the bundles of fabric swept into his arms. The dog whimpers. Dean mumbles something, muscles twitching. Castiel senses his longing like a caress against his skin.
Castiel’s small smile fades, the longer Dean stands there without responding. He nods once, sharply, before reaching for the door, leaving the room as quietly as he had entered it.
Mary runs her hand up the back of his neck, scrubbing his hair. Her thumb flicks the tip of his ear. Dean leans into as much as he will allow it. His mom might have trouble showing it sometimes, but she cares enough to come through for them in the end.
“Oh.” Dean feels his thumb brush skin a moment before he drops his hands from Castiel’s hips, stepping back hurriedly. “Sorry. Yeah. Uh.” He scratches his head, clears his throat. His attention turns toward the rest of their team. “Next up.”
Sam nods, accepting the lukewarm attempt even as he side-steps away. “I keep coming back to something occult. The worshippers of a pagan deity? A witch? Golem, maybe?”
Still, Dean survives the day, and he bullies his way through the rest of the week in much the same manner. Each night his dreams fill up with stupid re-imaginings of Castiel in different situations—even one where Cas was throwing axes in a crop top, of all things—and each morning fills up with a frustrated blend of wanting to indulge his body’s cravings while also wishing he could report it to HR.
Outside the nest, the bedroom door shut quietly as Castiel returned. Dean felt the cold bottled beverage appear before Castiel himself arrived beneath the blanket. “Drink this, please,” Castiel said, so Dean dutifully drank down half the sports drink before Castiel allowed it to be set aside. The blanket lifted as Castiel reemerged inside, the scent of sex escaping with the gesture. Again, Dean felt horrified at what his body made him do to this poor man, who was only here because Dean was a charity case.
“In one motion,” Cain tells him, “move your arms forward and let go,” so Dean does as much, pushing up from his legs through his torso as he tosses the hatchet—
text dragging them to the hellscape known as Wisconsin, Dean’s barely-alert mind figures that even if he tried, Garth couldn’t make any less sense.
“How’s your first day back?” Castiel asks without preamble, twisting his chair to better focus on Dean. He seems normal almost, like the person Dean has grown accustomed to puttering around the apartment the past couple days. But his hands are folded together, rigid in their grip, and he has trouble meeting Dean's eye, which is unlike the Castiel he’s grown to know outside of work.
As if on cue, a melodic chime goes off in Dean’s peripheral. Freshly-learned instincts have Dean looking to the app for a new message from Castiel, even as old muscle memory has him reaching for his ringing desk phone instead.
“What’re you doing?” Dean asks, when her phone tapping comes too rapidly to relate to the trail app.
“It won’t,” Jack insists. “I know it. I’ll destroy the token and we’ll bring the Lynn sisters home safe.”
Donnie’s almost been lulled into complacency by time half a dozen phones chime out roughly at the same time. Sam tries to shout something from his table, but when the crowd doesn’t respond, Jody peals out a sharp whistle and calls loudly enough to bring them all to attention, shouting a no-nonsense,
Dean seems restful, the frown line between his brows finally smoothed, his breaths coming in soft bursts between gently parted lips. His pallor is better too, his eyelashes dark against his cheek, his freckles standing out in sharp relief. Castiel finally feels confident he can leave Dean on his own until the morning.
Max has barely thrown his jeep into park before he’s making a beeline for the house, keen to see the portals Dean had described in fumbling laymen terms. Alex, Kaia, and Patience opt to follow Alicia over to the kids raiding the woodpile with Claire.
Dean laughs, watching as Castiel pulls a generous pre-cut piece of cake and pie onto a paper plate. He ushers Dean over to the dining table, adding, “I hope I did okay,” as he hands Dean the cutlery, watching nervously as Dean tucks in for his first bite.
Castiel has yet to change out of work clothes; a pale blue apron is tied over his white button-down. His collar has been loosened, the tie lost somewhere to the apartment, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows. But he has doffed his suit jacket and so Dean follows suit, draping his leather jacket over the back of the nearest chair.
“Good.” Castiel picks up the damp cloth from where it fell and deposits it into the ensuite sink. After some finagling with the lighting—bedside lamp on, overhead off—Castiel situates himself in a chair offside from his bed. “Is it okay that I work here for a bit?” If Dean is this far out of it, some chaperoning in the short term might be worthwhile.
“Don’t go dripping on the upholstery,” Dean mock-groused as he turned the ignition, throwing a wink Cas failed to catch.
Ricky beams back his own relief. “Sure, it’s no family secret. Though I’d say pick up all the recommended toppings too, if you’re looking for the full experience. He like anything extra on his bun?”
Dean forces himself to be still and steady, his touch light as he curves an arm around Cas, his throat working dry as he returns Cas’ mumbled goodnight.
A lot comes out, now that they’re finally stuck in a car with one another, nothing to save them from each other except the landscape and a rotating tape deck. Castiel gets the cliffs notes version of what actually followed after the attack dog spell. Lucifer’s return — via Castiel’s possession — and his ultimate demise. Another Michael’s return — via Dean’s possession — and his ultimate demise as well.
Laying heavy on the gas, Dean arrives at city outskirts while the summer sun’s still dragging toward the horizon. He pulls over at a gas station before the outskirts, as Sam had instructed, feeling wrung out and exhausted but willing himself forward. He fills the tank and scans through his chat log, pausing again over the blurred messages, double-checking what Sam wants him to do next.
“Believe me, you’re better for it.” Hank flourishes his pencil, dropping a 7 down into the center sudoku square. “Now, have you settled yet on your editorial? Because you might want to consider something more close to home, not whether your subject’s gonna come with a Pulitzer Prize.”
The grip on Dean’s hips tightened, and before Dean could make much sense of it, Cas pressed a kiss into his lower back, lavishing the exposed skin with slow, desperate affection. He kept kissing up along Dean’s spine even as he pushed Dean’s underwear down, his sweats and heatbriefs briefly collecting in the crook of his knees. Cas steadied him through removing them, helping tug at the clothes until Dean was finally freed.
“Legacy,” Raphael begins, turning to Zach’s side of the conference table, “can you provide us with a breakdown regarding your product updates this month?”
Cas made a thoughtful noise, distracted by his usual routine. He tucked his coat away on the hook Dean leaves open for him; crossed to the kitchen to unpack his cooler into the space Dean had made for him in the fridge. Dean leaned back against the countertop, watching it all with a mug of hot water in hand.
Hannah tips her head side to side, a gesture they all recognize as meaning she’s trying to find a nice way to say something terrible.
Shuffling around, Dean turns onto his side, facing Cas. He feels like the type of sleepdrunk that makes confessions easier to give.
Dressed in sweats, swaddled by his bathrobe, Dean opened the door to find Cas standing there with a smile and his cooler of supplies. Dean reflexively smiled at the sight of him in his dampened trench coat, his hair faintly rumpled by the rain. “Heya, Cas.”
The dam bursts without warning. “So annoying! Jody stuck her in my room, so now I have to share with this loner who never sets a foot outside the bedroom. Add in a psychic who just
“Mmm.” He pushes his face into the pillow, muscles tensing as he stretches. He finds his body aches in a variety of pleasant ways.
Slowly, Dean fishes himself loose from the arm draped over his waist. He pushes himself out of bed. Stumbles around, foot caught in his bedsheets, twisting around in half-steps. He finds his sink after a meandering path past his dresser and desk, splashes cool water on his face until he feels more like himself.
Claire comes in sometime later, when the storm shows no sign of slowing and she’s clearly grown sick of research. She folds a leg beneath her and sits up against Cas’ headboard, gaze fixated on the laptop. A couple minutes pass, and then Claire pops Cas’ headphones out from the jack. The low din of a laugh track floods the room.
Through the high-pitched ringing flooding his ears, Dean hears the crowd roar as another scuffle breaks out further down the ice. Fists are being thrown, but the shouts of the refs and the deafening crowd cut through anything else Dean might glean.
The CAB team clears the room first, followed quickly by Hester, Uriel, and Anael. Dean watches them go, reluctant to join them in the hall. Just the thought of having to small talk with any of them after that shitshow grabs Dean’s guts and gives them an awful twist.
“Great.” Dean shakes his head. “So if the kid doesn’t exist anymore, and we can’t get into the city to investigate, tell me again why I’m here?”
The sunset flickers around them, retreating from navy into summer blues. The sun backpedals above them, illuminating the entire sky.
Castiel watches from where he is hidden, reviewing the woman’s response to the arrival of an angel. Time passes in instants and eternities. Anael hangs by Castiel’s side, likewise watching Akobel allow the human to set boundaries regarding her heartbreak; he merely waits in hopes she might someday air her grievances, encouraging her to approach him at her own pace.
Sighing, Dean shuffles around, slouching up against the headboard. He turns on the nightstand lamp, finds Sam already propped up against his headboard too.
As Dean wraps up, he notices the light still on in the corner office. The brightness makes his head throb alongside the revelation.
“Alright,” Castiel says slowly, except that Dean isn’t talking to him, and his memory is as solid as Swiss cheese, and it all makes him feel worse still.
Castiel nods but doesn’t acknowledge the compliment any further than that. “More?” he asks, standing. When Dean shakes his head, Castiel cleans up both mugs, running the tap over both before dropping them into the sink. He wipes his hand on a towel, then lifts his head. “Tea?”
It was a strange liminal space between them, the silence and separation between their bodies broken by the soft noises made from skin on skin. Dean’s pace began to quicken, and Castiel found himself lagging behind, the hardness of his cock seemingly unready for the heat that Dean was bringing his own.
. But Bart clearly does not share her worries, seeing how his pompous smile continues to ignore her concerns.
“I see it,” Dean said. His legs wouldn’t stop shaking. His stupid hindbrain was fixated on the fact that
“No one needs to say it. Just look at BEAU, and Bart’s email about decommissioning legacy.” Dean waves his spoon around, adding, “They’ve got you and Mir and Inias on the shiny new project, and I’m sitting in the corner, holding all the leftovers while you guys—”
Castiel spends a lot of time in his room, bored out of his mind, since he’s technically still recovering from surgery, but doesn’t actually feel like sleeping every hour of the day.
“Mm-hmm.” Castiel turns around, though his gaze drags along the floor, hanging far from reach. “Dean, I’m sorry for what’s happened with the BEAU project. I thought I was doing a good thing by highlighting your strengths as a manager.” Swallowing, he glances up. “I miscalculated how deeply it would affect you. That you weren’t involved on the ground level of development. The team layout decisions might have come from above me, but I should have pushed harder against them.”
Castiel knocks on the cabin door to find Mary, snug in an oversized cardigan, alone for now. Taking some time away from John, now that their missing histories have been exchanged. She smiles with Castiel when she sees him, beaming as she tries to usher him inside.
The patio curtains have been left open, and the gray patter of rain sizzles up from the concrete walk outside. The sliver of pool within view bubbles like it’s spawning season. Dean keeps the TV quiet on the news, his legs extended and crossed at the ankles, hands folded up in each other on his lap. He watches it without a thought in mind, his eyes closing the longer he listens to the rain.
She fires out ricochet-quick, lobbing a bag directly at Dean’s head. Dean’s lucky his reflexes have recovered enough to catch it, otherwise he would have enjoyed a greasy bag smashing into his face.
Dean chalks it up to the shaky circumstances under which Cas let go of his grace, compounded by the imperfect vial they found for keeping it safe. Cas is human now—disheveled and sweating and accepting painkillers only begrudgingly, scratching away at his borrowed henley and softly snoring in his sleep. No wonder he’d be miserable, adapting to humanity with the lot of them, at the mercy of their sorry life lessons.
It’s a good night, so far as Donnie’s seen of nights such as this one, but it’s not until he observes Dean hugging Claire in appreciation for her spearheading the evening that Donnie resolves that conclusion into something great. He takes a beat to take it all in, the network of people that Dean has gathered around him, the ragtag collective that calls themselves Dean’s family and friends. So different than the first few years Donnie had found Dean sidled up to his bar, drowning in some unnameable misery, a haunted look in his eyes.
And that… Dean’s had about enough of the bullshit Cas has coddled him from, the endless cycle of them never getting off easy. “Jesus, Cas, why d’you always—” He shuts up, scrubs hard at his face. His mouth turns flinty and thin. “What’s the fine print this time.”
Dean pulls out from dark dreams to the sound of his cell phone ringing. It takes two rings to clear his head, roll over and swing his legs over the edge of the bed; another four pass before he finds the damned device buried in a pair of discarded jeans. He groans, chin sinking down, hangover briefly getting the better of him. He swipes to answer. “What.”
Dean sighed and read through the document, found the situation Castiel had put his signature to was tailored entirely to Dean’s specifications. There was a clause indicating that the omega’s signature was given while their heat was already in progress, and a motley collection of subclauses explaining in detail how the circumstances affected the liability to which the alpha exposed the company, and how Dean could rescind the trial at any time.The service fee of $0.00 was typed into the document, not even a field that needed filling out.
Dean keeps his distance so that Claire and the other wayward women can build a rapport with the kids, maybe get the full story of how everybody got here. Libby at least seems willing to talk about how she came to the farmhouse, how her stepdad and her brother, Trent, never saw eye to eye, and so when Trent's girlfriend came into contact with the neniven, he jumped on the chance to leave with her. Two other kids share similar stories of their former homes, likewise skirting over the bleak parts in their lives.
Castiel’s brows are pinched, his eyes hooded and mournful. His words come out haltingly. “I wish it was better timing. That I didn’t have my brother looking at me like I’m…” He drops his gaze. “Maybe once this blows over, we could...?”
Hours later, after the laptop’s battery has died and both Kaia and Claire have dozed off, Cas crawls out from his bed and slides into the empty half of Dean’s without preamble, just taking the place like it belongs to him. Cas reaches across Dean and plucks up the remote, turning up the muted television. He keeps his arm where it’s settled across Dean, preferring to perch his chin against Dean’s shoulder and doze from that angle instead.
Uriel exhales heavily. Another long, intermediate moment stretches before he speaks again. “If God is here, then I am happy to know my purpose again. I will do as you ask.”
Dean has never worked with someone he wants to talk to when the work day is over, someone who inspires text messages about something he saw in traffic or during a show he’s watching, someone who has him researching which takeout joint he can suggest they order from next. Just random moments throughout his days where he thinks “Castiel would like that.”
“Maybe it’s like—the Darkness,” Sam says, frowning as he thinks. He looks at Jack. “Can you control it?”
Once inside Dean’s apartment, Castiel remains studious on his box of flowers, as if he might offend Dean by looking intently at his apartment’s layout. He casts subtle glances around, though, ones that Dean might have missed if he weren’t watching Castiel so closely.
As it is, he can’t talk about it with Cas. He can’t stomach the thought of reaching out to find Castiel is only wanting closure before he moves on.
Dean keeps his hand slung around Castiel’s waist, holding him near, even as the proximity means he has to switch hands in order to keep eating pie and cake. Castiel takes it all in stride, in that quiet way he has of observing Dean and enjoying him, even when Dean loads up a forkful of cake and insists Castiel take a bite.
That, and that Luanne better loosen the water heater’s manifold before he shows up at her door. “Can do, if you’re willing.”
“I know.” Dean might be heat-drunk, but he remembered the reasons why he added that rule in the first place. “I just wanna know. Bet you taste like fucking candy.”
“Do you want to... “ Castiel pauses, mulling. “But Heaven must allow you to continue making mistakes.”
“No foul,” Ricky says, shrugging. So they’re back to fresh. Beginner levels. He walks him through the chuck mixes they have on hand, the jalapeno cheddar pork patties, the pork and beef salsa, even the veggie patties they bring in custom for Peg Mussey. When none of them jump out to Doug as appealing, Ricky dials it back and thinks on it a moment, tapping a finger on the glass above the display. “Y’know, it’s a basic ground, sure, but if you’re up for it, this chuck would take to burgers beautifully.”
Michael appears in the corner of Dean’s bedroom, not too long into his fretful attempt at sleep—his thoughts on Purgatory, on the last time Dean had come close to cracking that chasm within him open, saying what’s never been said. Thinking about how Cas had stopped him before Dean could screw up and say the wrong thing.
On the screen is the side profile of a few unknown people, their arms angled above their heads, hands and elbows even heights to each other. In the background, large bullseyes are painted on sheets of plywood. In their hands are small, sharp hatchets.
Dean felt his heartbeat stutter, even as the fear began to seep back into his body, reacting to an alpha lying so close to him. He pushed through it though, allowing the fear to become part of the exhilaration of pulling his alpha—god, pulling
Cas shrugs, giving a sour look that Dean assumes is his new resting face. “Without my grace, I am… recovering, but it will be some time yet before I’m capable of accepting its return.”
Swiveling around, Dean stretches out his arm in a quick estimation of distance. He sidesteps to the door and, fumbling open the handle, takes a further three steps out into the hall.
“That’s what I said,” Anael replies. “So when that didn’t work, Bart gave this really awful performance review, just totally unprompted. Like that would somehow make them believe he wanted Cas back working for him?” She rolls her eyes. “What a shitshow.”
"Yeah. Okay, fine. I get it." Dean tucks the box into his elbow, and gestures for peace with his free hand. "Tell you what. How about you keep those for now, and we'll use them up some other night. Y'know. For pasta dinner sometime."
“So what time’s the birthday boy due?” Donnie asks, slapping a towel onto his shoulder. An hour has passed, and it seems like the rest of Dean’s people have sauntered in, the size of the crowd stabilizing somewhere around a couple dozen.
Dean turns back to his inbox and accepts the meeting invitation, leaving the response box empty in his reply.
Dean takes an age to bully himself through his headache, brushing his teeth and swilling with the hair of the dog that bit him, spending too much of the morning packing all of his shit into a well-worn duffel bag. He gathers his charger and phone, and gets as far as his thumb hovering over a text draft to Cas before he catches what he’s doing. Guilt and anger writhe in Dean’s gut. He shoves his cell into his back pocket instead.
Castiel takes a free parking spot two cars down from Dean’s usual stall, and unlocks his doors. They each fish out a box to take upstairs.
“I know,” Anael says. “But Raph will have to explain to the board why an emergency work order was logged and four people are expecting a night’s worth of OT to be paid.”
Dean smiles through the kiss, then drops his chin to his chest, succumbing to the full strength of his grin. He smooths a hand along Cas’ arm, briefly entertaining the thought, the reality, that he might have this again. Have it always, if only he could bring himself to believe.
“The puke perimeter,” Claire calls cheerfully. “Patience got to name it, since she upchucked first when we crossed it.”
Power surged in the war room, all remaining lights flaring catastrophically bright. Then all the bulbs shattered in unison, breaking just as the sirens went out.
A pathetic part of Dean thrilled at the sight of Cas’ profile image, his mussy hair and strong jaw. The sharp way Cas was staring at the camera, his blue eyes honed in on the photographer. A small smile twisting his mouth, softening his overall stoicism. Dean’s inner omega stretched like a cat in sunlight, purring at the sight of its alpha. But Dean’s inner omega was stupid; Cas wasn’t really his. The sooner he got over that, the better.
It should have been easy, packing up from Castiel's place. After all, it wasn't like Dean had meant to come here in the first place, and hadn’t exactly arrived with a duffel bag to repack. But once Dean decides he’s overstayed his welcome, he finds it harder to leave than it ought to be.
With the development portion of phase three completed, Miriam transfers back onto the regular legacy team, picking up the slack on the scheduled updates neither Inias nor Dean have had time to attend to yet. Legacy gets rolling again under its own steam, battle-weary but otherwise no worse for wear.
“This place suits you,” Dean tells Cas, after, when the final bell warns them the coffee shop is about to close, and they all dress up again for the cold hike back to campus.
The shower curtain caught the resulting spray, the plastic sheet rumbling with a tepid tapping pattern. Steam began to build the longer Castiel listened to the soft pattering against the curtain, the rhythm of which spoke to him like rain.
He throws himself out of bed on instinct, his consciousness playing catch-up to his hands and feet, which have already grabbed him a knife and carried him out his bedroom door.
Castiel would be leaving him—them. How was Dean supposed to respond to a thing like that? Especially when Cas doesn’t want anything from him—doesn’t even want to be
Even still, the couple days Dean spent as Castiel’s pseudo-roommate just shine a light on all the subtle shades of life missing from Dean’s usual routine. He doesn’t have somebody to discuss a show on TV or what to have for supper; somebody who might share an observation about something at work that tangents off into bouts of laughter; somebody to brush shoulders against, as they brush their teeth together at the bathroom sink, one last lingering round of company shared before retiring to their separate beds.
Castiel props his cheeseburger against his lips with his bandaged hand, and gnaws at it absently while his good hand thumbs through his cell phone records. Sesame seeds brush off his lips with every bump in the road.
As much as he was enjoying laying beside Cas, Dean sighed, wanting more. He wanted Cas’ hands on much more pressing places of his body.
Still. It was hard keeping that in mind when Cas wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulders, growing comfortable as the movie progressed, or when he rubbed his fingers through the short hairs at the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean was just thankful he had seen these movies enough times that he could recite them in his sleep, and could instead spend his time savouring the feel of Cas so close to him, the warmth of Cas’ body tucked in a tight line along his own.
Dean hums. “Tomorrow.” His fingers dig small circles into the back of Castiel’s neck, trying to relieve its tension. How he wishes today could stretch on forever.
Castiel stares down at his desk, eyes darting blankly as he thinks. “I’m sorry, Dean. I thought it was understood. Bart was moved onto special projects in order to kickstart BEAU. Raphael outlined his expectations for BEAU during my interview.”
Sam turns to Dean from where he was facing the sky, his eyes closed. Sam squints at him, asks, “So how was the drive? D’you two work things out?”
Dean keeps mumbling complaints, demanding in a limp voice that he should be going to work too, while Castiel makes several trips between the ensuite and kitchen, changing his clothes in one trip, bringing back a steaming cup of tea with him on the next. He brushes his teeth and pulls a comb through his hair a few times before deeming the gesture to be useless; he’ll just have to go into the office with a terrible case of sofa-bedhead.
“Most of the missing persons here don’t follow the same pattern as Abbie or Libby,” Sam begrudgingly admits, tossing aside another file. “There’ve been only two records of abductions by a stranger, and only one of those involved a victim in her teens. Everybody in the Lynn sisters’ age range presumably either ran away or were taken by a family member or friend.”
The act of undressing should have brought Castiel pleasure; he had seen how couples enjoyed teasing themselves by removing layers. Now faced with the necessity of dressing again, he found himself without patience. Castiel snapped a thought and made himself dry and clothed again, with only the lingering steam of the room betraying what had happened here.
. The boy must glean as much from it too, because he quickly adds, “But Claire’s recipe wasn’t working, even after six tries. It kept asking for eleven cups of flour, and we ran out of—”
Back in the living room, Castiel positions himself on the sofa with his laptop open. He pulls up the files last modified by Dean in the shared cloud and starts scanning the more recent of the two, looking for the point where its contents stop making sense.
“Hey.” Dean swivels his chair around, nudging Castiel’s leg with his socked foot. “It’s not that bad.”
“Anyways,” Miriam says, rocking back on her heels. “Just wanted to tell you you’re a dick. And to stop working so hard. And I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
On the nightstand is Castiel’s crumpled letter, the same place as it’s been since Dean tossed it there, weeks earlier. Tucked between the spare pens and empty bottles, a phone charger snaked beneath it.
Dean gazed down at his feet, scuffing his heel against the tile. “Nothing. It’s nothing. Just saw that, uh. You canceled me again.”
He can feel the high flush burning his cheeks, though it only makes Cas look more enamoured. Dean clears his throat, looking elsewhere in hopes of collecting himself. Now that the hard part has come he—he still doesn’t know whether he can do it. Whether he can say what… What he needs to...
The day of check-in, Dean drives out early, intending to scope out the location as much as he can without Garth hovering near. Sam insists on coming with him, expression clamped pointedly flat, although his mouth keeps slipping up at the corners, forcing Sam to bite back his grin. Cas likewise tags along for the ride, sitting sullen in the back seat of the Impala, his gaze swept out the side window, chin perched forlorn in hand.
Small blessings mean he doesn’t wait to wake up naturally, but is instead roused by a racket banging in the kitchen beyond the sofa.
. Beneath the higher tones of argument, and the short-haired cop’s aggressive attempts to soothe them, Hank picks out the ponytailed cop and the trench coat discussing where else in town they might feasibly gather a couple dozen of their kind.
It frightens him, to think that Cas is locked somewhere inside himself, somewhere where clouds are rolling in and Dean won’t be there to brush the dirt from his face.
Dean’s neck isn’t broken, thank god, but when his headache doesn’t clear after an hour they send him off to CTs, just to assess what kind of soup Dean’s made of his brain. His hearing clears up the longer he remains laying down on the gurney, although his balance is still staggered and his vision remains a little wobbly. All in all it’s part and parcel for a rough concussion, but then again, Dean expected much worse considering the severity of the hit.
With his cheek now mushed up against the carpet, Dean burbles, “What the hell?” He doesn’t remember falling, or Sam collapsing behind him, or Claire laughing so hard she’s slumped into the gap between the beds.
Dean slams his fist against the wheel, cursing. He climbs out of the cab in a huff, popping the hood once again.
A stray couple of demons drop down from the balcony, late to the party but still raring for a fight. They lunge for the figure, who swings a weapon straight for them—a scythe, slicing delicately through the air.
Dean dumped the glass into the sink, refilled it with cold water from the tap. The kitchen looked like it hadn’t been touched in days; the dishwasher was empty, the counters clean. Either Cas dutifully kept up on his chores even while sick, or he hadn’t been eating recently.
“Right,” Sam agrees. “But with this kind of magic, the witch builds the spell into a token based off an index, some element on these higher planes. Anyone that matches that element gets hit by the spell’s effects, depending on the radius built into the token.”
Dean trembles as if struck, his eyes squeezing shut. Something fierce thickens at the base of his throat, building until it all but closes off his breath.
Cas laughed, loud and bright, and it warmed Dean to hear it rumble through his otherwise empty apartment. “I’ll take Indiana Jones, as if you’ve really given me a choice.”
Castiel’s frown breaks fractionally at the sight of him, giving way to a crinkled smile that’s close enough to be captured in a kiss.
Castiel approaches the stairs, touches the banister. He looks up the stairwell, at the landing to the second storey up ahead.
Dean’s attention snaps over to him as Castiel touches him, fingers flexing on instinct. Castiel tightens his hold before loosening, allowing Dean the option to remove himself from Castiel’s grip.
“I think so.” Castiel nudges what’s left of his pie toward Dean, offering him the last few bites. “My record hasn’t been exemplary enough to justify keeping me, after I’m moved off legacy.” He laughs, humorless. “It’s not like I was trained to be an analyst.”
But Dean just buried himself deeper into Cas’ arms, into the smell that he was learning was safe because it came from Cas.
“You want every angel to accept that they and Heaven are imperfect?” Anael raises an eyebrow. “How blasphemous of you, Castiel.”
Dean fights down the instinct to flinch, knowing that odds are Sam already heard how he answered Mary’s call, that he’s been privy to years of the mewling desperation that creeps through Dean the moment he thinks Cas might be near.
The humidity is high in the meadow, the air sheltered on all sides by trees. Dean pulls at his shirt collar, wondering whether it would’ve been wise to bring a second t-shirt for when he inevitably sweats through his current attire.
Miles of gravel pass with neither of them speaking. Cas’ grace bottle rattles on the seat between them, rocking against the belt clasp with each bump in the road. Dean fans his fingers out along the steering wheel, pretending for the moment that he can touch the tension that has grown between them, this terrible gray space where they’ve made amends without actually making amends.
He ponders it a moment, then says decisively, “I’m going to check you over at my house and then decide whether you need the hospital. Is that okay, Dean?”
Dean made a show of grimacing at the mess adorning his chest. “You weren’t kidding about the not-walking thing, huh.”
Dean needs no further encouragement. He rakes his teeth along the tendon straining in Castiel’s neck, scraping up through stubble. Castiel breathes hotly into the side of Dean’s head, mouth close to his ear, tickling the short hairs there.
The grip Dean held on him broke alongside Dean’s reservations. His hand pushed roughly into Castiel’s hair, flexing once before forcing him down. Castiel took the pressure readily, opening his jaw and sucking Dean in further. He worked the muscles of his throat, kept his tongue moving in a velvet line. An extra flick and Dean choked on the combined sensations, his grip slackening enough for Castiel to resume his relentless bobbing pace.
“It’s beautiful,” Castiel says, eyeing the woods and neatly-tended flower beds around the farmhouse, his nose nearly smudging the window.
Cas takes the map from Dean, examining it closely. “These red lines, they’re the main roads?” Cas drags his long fingers up the bulk of Broadway. “I drove past there to get here, maybe half an hour ago.”
“So it’s settled,” Sam says, nodding. “We’ll convoy out there and be ready as backup the moment Jack takes down the token. All in favor?”
He found Castiel in the kitchen, as promised, rifling through a cooler brought in from the vehicle Castiel must have driven to get here. A plate of cold cut sandwiches and chips sat beside an electrolyte drink, all neatly organized around a single place setting.
His fingers tremble as he turns off his office light. He walks on wooden legs across the cubicle floor, stopping by the coffee cubby to grab his thermos from the drying rack.
Like a magic eye puzzle, the image flips, and suddenly a farmhouse and barn appear in the distance, surrounded by a thick shelterbelt of bushes and, within, neat rows of trees.
“Don’t be. It was my pleasure.” Castiel casts a surreptitious glance around, as if he’s only allowing himself to memorize the apartment now that he’s departing. Maybe he’s also scared about what Monday will be like, now that this bubble around them is about to pop.
“Your whole family is from around here?” the girl asks eventually, after sufficient time has passed for Val to calm down.
Cas hummed, regardless retrieving the electric kettle from its corner of the counter. He refilled it and plugged it in before fetching a spoon and a small tub of honey out from one of Dean’s cabinets, followed by a bottle of lemon juice pulled out from the fridge.
“If it pleases you, knowing you are there,” the djinn replies, saccharine-sweet. “Dijwar is more likely to attack in the dream, anyway. You could be useful, as a shield.”
Satisfied, Dean heads to the bathroom and scrubs down in the shower, stepping out after in a cloud of steam. He shaves off his five o’clock shadow and slaps on his nicest aftershave. He picks out his best cologne and dabs it beneath his jawline, then ruffles a hand through his artfully styled hair.
Castiel sighed to himself, seemingly below the roar of crackling electricity. Above it, he shouted, “This isn’t me.”
Dean shakes his head, stumbling back. “Yeah, no. I’m out.” He jogs on jelly-legs back outside the perimeter and plops down onto the curb a safe distance away, blinking rapidly as he waits for his head to clear. The streetlight beside him flickers on with the approaching dusk.
Castiel holds him steady, as he shakes apart. Dean parts his lips, chasing what they had only moments ago, and Castiel’s tongue plunges in beside his, ready for the taking.
Cas’ chuckle rumbles through him. “Don’t deny me this, Winchester,” he says, throat husky, following the demand with a sloppy press of lips.
Their usual routine, for one—dress as Feds, question the cops, visit the witnesses—is next to impossible thanks to the nausea-inducing barrier around the city. The only county office that lies outside the weird perimeter is Water Resources, with runner-up status going to the Highway Department. The latter sits close enough to the perimeter that Claire wagers they could visit there in-person, provided they only hang out inside for ten minutes or less. Not that the highway cops would have any useful information.
A month later, when Dean’s completed his physio and finally been given a clean bill of health, he and Cas break him in at their hotel room, filling the six hours they have before their next game against the Penguins with some much needed sexcapades.
They have a moment looking at each other, him leaning back on darling’s side. The overcast afternoon softens the edges of him, makes him younger than the mileage on him calls for. Then the station door burps open with its clanging chime, and the moment breaks with the siblings coming her way.
His use of finger-quotes makes Castiel laugh softly. “Thank you, Dean. Everyone has promised me you are the go-to guy for the legacy system.”
So Castiel closes his eyes and imagines Kansas. Lebanon. A parcel of land far from the outskirts of town. An old power plant that hides priceless secrets underground.
Anael drops her cutting gaze.“So there’s an email from Bart, saying we’re taking on this whole extra workload.”
Dean coughs out a laugh, the red eye of the cigarette flaring as he takes another hit. “Not sure when Novak decided he was my keeper. What’s his fucking problem anyway?”
And he means it; it’s enough to have felt the truck again beneath his hands. To have touched it and verified that it is what he remembers, in those few memories he has recovered.
Max shakes his head. He waits until he’s within distance before speaking again. “Can’t sense any other source of magic within this place. The token is just too strong.”
“Well isn’t that beautiful,” Rowena says in a voice that implies anything but. Wiping her eyes, she turns on Joyce’s dumbfounded expression, and asks cheerily, “So can we go now, dear?”
, just let it be peaceful. Whatever happens to Cas, just let him be at peace. Don’t let him be lost to torment for the sake of someone as worthless as Dean.
Emboldened, Dean said, “I’m right, aren’t I.” He threw a wink that was lost to the dark. “Tell me what’s bugging you, angel.”
Eyes closed, Castiel nods stiffly. “CEO.” He presses a hand to the middle of his brow, eyebrows pinched around the thumb rubbing at the crease between them.
Dean relaxed into the thought, trying it on for size. Maybe further time with Castiel could help him accept that.
It feels stupid, following dream logic in the real world, out where a very real battle is breaking around them. But still Dean brushes a palm against Cas’ cheek. Tucks his fingertips into the curls of Cas’ hair. Cups Cas’ chin and lilts up his mouth, all the better for Dean to press their lips together in a delicate kiss.
Sam’s mouth twists with one of his stupid, choked-back grins. “It’s not so bad. In fact, it’s kind of—”
The call from Sam connects while Dean is scrounging around the cupboards for food. His fridge is full of stale takeout boxes, with only a half-case of beer and a carton of milk comprising the ingredients not presently expired.
Cas’ jaw tightens, his mouth thinning to an unhappy line. Dean watches the gears turn in his head, waits to put voice to what they’re both thinking. “Not like we have any better options, Cas. Not just anybody can fill your shoes.”
The one he cares about. His best friend. Because he needs Cas alive if he’s gonna make it through any of this shit.
“I know what I’m doing,” Castiel growled. When Dean seemed insistent on arguing, Castiel reached over and grabbed Dean’s cock instead.
Dean’s face warms with the compliment. “Can be. But sometimes I can be a real dick.” He tugs at a loose thread on the comforter, twisting the strand between his fingers. His voice falters, but he manages to mumble, “Should’ve maybe been nicer to you. Back when you were starting out. It’s not your fault they hired you over me ”
The smell of woodsmoke catches as Dean crosses to the porch, drifting in on the lazy breeze that curls within the trees. Inside the house, he knows, Abbie Lynn and her brother are deep in discussion around the kitchen table, Sam and Mary using Cas and Jack as translators with the neniven. To the front yard, then, where Libby and the rest of the runaways are poking sticks into the fire and catching marshmallows aflame.
The Winchester family home is typically located down the road from Bobby’s and the Harvelle’s. Today, a second cabin has been crafted a quarter-mile out from the family homestead, with a small forest sprouting between.
“Bottom corner,” Cas called after his hasty exit. “There’s a box of… penne, I think,” he added, swallowing hard. “Pasta sauce should be close by.”
“Thank you,” Dean says instead, reaching for Castiel. He brushes a hand down Castiel’s sleeve, squeezing. Allows his hand to travel lower, seizing his palm in a tight grip, hoping it might say what all cannot be said. “Thank you.”
Dean tries to retain what Castiel is saying about legacy, but he’s hardly listening. His hands tremble beneath the conference table. He feels like a fool, and completely unnecessary to being here. Why the hell did they want him here if Castiel was already attending?
“Oh, good.” Adler breathes out a sigh, and Dean can hear the smile in what he says next, even as it makes Dean’s own grin disappear. “Thank you, Dean. Rest assured, it’s only temporary. The new SA will be starting right away, but without Bart there to train him, we’ll need you to step in—”
Without God’s presence the bunker is eerily quiet, not a soul beyond the three of them left panting harshly in this room.
Cas gives a low snarl, stepping closer. Dean allows himself to get wrapped up in his arms, nearly hauled up onto his tip-toes. “No.”
Cain nods stiffly, his mustache twitching with what Dean assumes is a smile. “Good. Will see you at the throwing cages.”
“It felt inevitable,” Uriel says—immediately or eventually, Castiel cannot clearly tell. “That Lucifer would rise. That humanity would fall. I felt—it was my duty to see through the apocalypse. It was the best course of action to take. To bring our Father back.”
“Well.” Joyce’s mouth purses together. “It is sure nice meeting you, Mr. and Mr. Fitzchester the Fourth! Hope to see you back on the green here real soon.” In a mock-whisper, she adds, “We’ll be playing Two Truths and A Lie to start us off.”
Dean kicks at a lump of shirts Sam left on the floor. “Dude, didn’t I teach you to clean up after yourself? Looks like Goodwill threw up in here.”
Dean opens his work’s messenger app on his phone, even though he shouldn’t. The compulsion to know what notifications he’s missing moves his hands before his head can stop them. Another stab of anger strikes when he notes that a bunch of unread pings have come in from Castiel since leaving the office. Dean won’t deign to respond to them tonight.
Castiel excuses himself from the chorus, stating, “I wish to gather insight from other sources.” With a flap of his wings, he seeks out those humans who have already subverted the construct of heaven once before.
“Dean,” Cas said again, this time steering both their bodies to the side. Dean flumped down into the pillows with a needful whine, rejection ramping up through him with the cold distance between their bodies. Then Cas was crowding over him, rolling Dean back to face him when he tried to shy away, burying his face into the bedsheets. He kissed Dean’s mouth, his cheek, his temple. His deep voice rumbled straight into Dean’s ear. “I’ll be right back. Just let me get a condom.”
Dean’s heat spiked sometime after Cas loaded Temple of Doom into the player. One moment Dean was admiring Indy, sprawled out and soaking wet in a yellow inflatable raft, then in the next Dean was being coaxed up off the couch by gentle hands tugging deftly on his bathrobe.
Something twisted in Dean’s belly, growing hot. He didn’t know what he wanted to do with this information, other than let his inner omega briefly preen. He found himself pulling at the blankets of Cas’ nest, trying to dig within.
“I don’t know,” Sam breathes, pushing back his hair. “I don’t know. I’m just grabbing all the information we can get before the wipe happens.”
Sam’s steps falter, tripping over nothing. The adrenaline rush that’s been carrying them both this long has spiked, crashing. They’re running out of steam.
Dean sighed heavily through his nose. He didn’t want to think about it, but there was no point in sugarcoating it. Castiel was a professional; Dean felt he should know what it’s like for the majority of them that can’t afford Alpha Services’ specialties.
Dean guesses this is Castiel’s other coworker, judging by the goatee. “Dean,” he says, holding out his hand.
The form of this heaven takes some time to settle. While Ellen is satisfied with summoning a new version of the Roadhouse, Bobby and Pamela’s minds go immediately to their respective homes as their places of comfort. What was one building quickly transforms into three, bunched close like rowhouses before settling out, spreading across a stretch of prairie that could be mistaken for South Dakota as easily as Nebraska.
Which is how Dean finds out that Garth apparently took an art class or two in the Japanese comic style, because his rendition of Dean involves a rugged jawline and stylized swooping haircut, Dean’s over-exaggerated anime eyes glowing a limpid green shade.
The door bangs shut behind him. Outside, he finds a small enclosed porch with a swing bench and a couple muskoka chairs, a small round table wobbling on the floorboards between them. Cain leans with his back toward them, arms braced against the porch rails, a chicken sandwich hanging from his hand, half-eaten.
Dean hums, noncommittal. Icing hangs from the corners of his mouth, twitching as he eats the cake without a hint of joy.
His phone returns to his pocket, nudging his leg into Castiel’s thigh again. They sit there, overly close. Ellen Piccolo sobs in a stairwell while the soundtrack swells dramatically, accentuating her despair.
Dean nods, though they both know they’re grasping at straws. He sets aside his empty, debates the merit of grabbing another. His head throbs with a phantom headache, like it’s warning him away. From the corner of his eye he can see Sam mulling something, the glances he tosses Dean’s way revealing more than Sam likely intends. A sixth sense tells Dean a blow is coming, even as Sam contemplates the best way to soften it.
“And that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Ash says, gesturing wildly with his beer. “Human beings are messy. Our relationships are messy. Take my mother, for example—I love her, God rest her, but there is
Cas cups his neck and lifts Dean up from where he’s trying, trying so desperately, to pretend that this might be real. His thumb soothes against Dean’s temple, coaxing him into opening his eyes. He leans in, cheek to cheek.
Dean nodded numbly, sliding forward along the comforter on his belly. His gut contracted as his face hit the pillow, Castiel’s scent strongest and most soothing, there.
Why would Castiel bring him to his apartment to recover? The guy hates him—well, no, Dean wouldn’t say Castiel
“What the hell did Garth think we were doing this weekend?” Dean asks, dazedly picking through the contraband. He almost misses the snap of the lube clicking open, Cas dolloping a hearty amount into his palm before wrapping it deftly around Dean’s dick.
Dean hummed, untucking his face from Cas’ pillow. He dug his knees harder into the mattress, bowing his back as he pressed his upper body down. All the better to present himself for his alpha.
of the place, and the bunker’s not so different than back home. Ryan still has a schedule, still has duties to keep. Still feels like an interloper, a lamb among soldiers in a war she never signed up for.
Dean chuckles. “Bound to be less than you. You got a real name for the puke perimeter even. Aggrotudinal?” Dean whistles. “Fancy.”
Miriam clucks her tongue. Her arms remain crossed, unimpressed. “Whatever you say, boss,” she says as she saunters away.
Dean locates his switchblade before he goes, laying open on a nearby shelf, and grabs it more slowly than he did his phone. He plucks it up almost mechanically, distantly noting the dried blood flaking along its edge.
It scares Dean now, though he knows better. His heart pounds as he comes up beside Cas. “Hey.” He thumps his knuckles into Cas’ chest. “Just because you’re dead to me doesn’t mean you get to die for good.”
“He okay?” Dean murmurs, his breath stirring the hair by Cas’ temples. Cas smells like sweat and stale shampoo, a deceptively earthy scent.
“I understand,” says Castiel, thinking of the other world’s Michael, who believed the same. “Our Father—Chuck made it necessary to guess at his true intentions. But now we no longer have to guess. In his absence, we are again honorbound to watch over his creations.”
“I dunno,” Sam says, “and I don’t have my laptop. But I texted a picture to Rowena to get her take on it.”
The company only uses contractors when the work they’re given is temporary. Castiel might not be kept on after the project is done.
Abbie probably looked out for her younger sister. Tried to make Libby’s life easier. She would’ve been there for every milestone, every knee scrape and heartache as they grew up together.
They meet at the girls’ motel room, where Sam and Claire already have the TV on and their laptops open. Dean swings the door in wildly, sending reams of handwritten notes fluttering around the room.
“Cas,” Dean began, but he didn’t know where to go with it. Already Castiel’s eyes were closed, his body turned away. When Castiel breathed in, the static charge of the grass around them rippled, leaping like electric fish.
How could that be the same guy Dean knows from legacy, someone too antisocial to leave his office if not to refill his coffee?
He is back at the farmhouse, standing in the shade of the covered porch, listening to the rhythmic chopping of woodcutting in the distance. A light breeze curls warmly around him, pulling him down the creaking porch steps and out onto a gravel path winding through the rustling trees.
Dean stumbles back beneath the strength of Castiel closing in on him, walking him backward. A breath punches out when his back hits the wall.
Joyce ushers the five of them discreetly into her office, pulling the blinds shut, the lights kept low. “Listen you lot,” she hisses, her sweet affectation turned sour, “I may be old but I’m not stupid. I’ve seen enough couples pass through here in my lifetime to know when we have pretenders in our midst!”
He blames this upward cant of his head as the reason why he finds Cas at all, his inattention resulting in him tripping over Cas’ body and sending Dean splaying. Dean catches himself roughly on one knee, saving himself from the full-body faceplant he was destined to make.
“Please.” Cas stubbornly avoided Dean’s eye until Sam dropped the key into his open hand, at which point Cas shot Dean a cold glare and climbed out without a further word.
Questions from the board come out as accusations, the meeting playing out as an interrogation of the legacy team. It’s little more than an excuse for Raphael to berate them—to berate Cas, specifically. As he continues to rake Cas over the coals, it becomes obvious that Dean and the rest of the team aren’t needed here, except maybe to bear witness to the humiliations being doled out.
Dean knows, intellectually, that defects are still coming in. That the implementations team is still passing them impromptu updates. That products is still scheduling more work than he and Miriam alone can bear. He knows this is all happening—he can sense how the rest of legacy thrums with life around him—
They never agreed that they should keep things strictly professional, but Dean doesn’t dare ask Castiel about it, not since so much time has passed since Cas basically said they’ll wait and see. But Dean’s noted the way Castiel keeps to himself lately, his office door closed, in the aftermath of being publicly lashed in front of half the team.
Sam curses, his arm shaking. Dean stands by his brother’s side, pushes his own weapon into Sam’s unsteady grip. Between the two of them, Dean would rather see his brother kill this fucker. Would rather have Sam stand a chance to survive.
Dean remembers the present. It’s still on the floor by the bed where Dean dropped it on his way to rescue Cas from the nightmare. Dean grabs it and hides it in the closet. Then he goes to bathroom to help Cas change his bandage. Dean checks the wound over. He’s okay. He didn’t reopen it or anything. Dean cleans the area around the wound and puts a new bandage on.
was cute, but he is endeared to know it warranted a text to Sam. Sam talks about the 2029 camping trip and
Dean closes his eyes and feels Cas gently run the cloth over and around his eyes. Then he feels Cas use another cloth on his face. This one is dry and rough, but Cas is gentle, and his hand is steady.
Castiel puts his hands on Dean’s face, gently tracing his jaw with his thumbs. Then he carefully pulls Dean towards him. Dean leans forward and presses their lips together.
“Yeah, no problem.” Dean presses a gentle kiss on Castiel’s forehead. “It’s only fair. You are my shelter from the storm.”
Cas smiles. There are tears in his eyes, and he’s smiling so friggin’ wide. He’s so happy right now. And then the Empty comes and takes him away.
“I’m so glad you’re back, man.” Dean can feel his eyes prick with tears. He presses kisses into Cas’s hair.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees as he carefully makes his way through the living room. Meg’s sleeping on the recliner. Sammy and Eileen are sleeping on the couch. Charlie’s sleeping in a chair. Jo’s curled up on the floor and Dean has to step around her to get to the kitchen’s entrance. Gabriel is lying on his back, sleeping on the table in the dining room just outside of the kitchen. Milton is curled up on Gabriel’s stomach.
“That was awesome, man! Did you see their faces when you won? They were so pissed!” Dean’s grinning from ear-to-ear.
“Oh, you want to save your family. How…pathetic.” The Empty says. “I bet they came just because they have a new problem for you to solve.”
Nobody says anything as Ellen stirs something or another. Dean doesn’t even know what they’re making. He
“It’s nice to know that Crowley would tie someone up in lawyer hell for our kids. And I like that Charlie, Gabriel, and Crowley see our kids as family too.” Cas tilts his head to the side. “I’m fairly certain that Meg, Benny, and Garth do as well. Although, it’s a good thing Meg wasn’t there. She probably would’ve actually let the air out of that guy’s tires.”
Cas pulls away a little. His hands are on Dean’s shoulders. Their faces are mere inches apart. Dean can feel Cas’s breath on his face. Cas’s cheeks are a little red and he’s smiling at Dean.
Castiel cannot help but chuckle when he realizes that Dean is going to enjoy having a cat just as much as Castiel is.
to. But he just couldn’t stay away from the dorky English major who loves bees and coffee and dancing.
As soon as he starts crying, he feels Cas turn around and hug him. Cas pulls Dean’s head onto his shoulder and grips him tight.
Castiel has to look away from Dean so Dean can’t see that he’s crying for an entirely new reason. If Castiel required evidence that Dean at least cared about him to some capacity, this is it.
“You’re safe. You’re in 2001, but you’re safe. I’ve got you.” Dean still doesn’t know what that could possibly mean to Cas, but he hopes it’s enough.
” Dean yells. “You left me with him! I was just a kid and you left me with him! How the hell is that fair?”
The teams are Dean, Charlie, and Benny AKA English and STEM against Meg, Crowley, and Castiel also known as Who The Fuck Knows?. Who The Fuck Knows? Is destroying English and STEM.
But his dad wanted them to hunt. He raised them to hunt. What would he say if Dean stopped hunting to what? Retire with Cas? Go run a restaurant and become the new Ellen? Take Jack with them and let him be normal? Or at least as normal as Jack can be.
Castiel doesn’t know how long he takes to calm down. He feels shame wash over him when he thinks about his actions.
Of course, this morning is a little different than usual. This morning is the morning of Christmas Eve and Jack is shaking Dean awake asking about Santa Claus.
Dean tries to ignore the way Cas’s voice makes his heart ache. He’s clearly just starved for affection. He can’t remember the last time someone said something nice to him without him paying them for it. And no one has ever looked at Dean the way Cas has been looking at him in the hours they’ve spent together.
“Castiel, you do not need to apologize for any of this. Of course, I’ll give you some money. I’ll send you an email with the info. Hang on just a sec.” Gabriel stops talking and Castiel can hear some typing. “Okay, you should get it.”
Castiel is being pulled into a sitting up position with his back pressed against Dean’s chest. Dean’s arms are wrapped around Castiel’s chest. Castiel doesn’t let go of his head. He can’t move. This probably makes trying to pull him up difficult for Dean, but Castiel’s worried that if he moves even a little, he will completely fall apart.
“Just leave it here. He wasn’t gonna come back for it anyway.” Dean picks up his bags and heads for the door. He opens the door and lets Cas pass through it first. Then he takes one last look, turns out the lights, and closes the door.
“We’re gonna get married.” Castiel whispers. The moment’s hitting him as well and he feels hot tears spill down his face. He buries his face in Dean’s shoulder. “I love you so fucking much, Dean Winchester.”
Cas’s eyes widen and he takes a step back. “Dean, you never have to go with me if you don’t want to.”
Castiel sighs and takes his clothes off. He folds his dirty trench-coat neatly on the bed. Then the suit jacket, the button-down shirt, the undershirt, and the pants. He carefully steps into the pajama pants, doing his best not to position his head the wrong way. His head hurts and it’s getting harder to ignore the pain. The t-shirt is harder to handle, but he manages to put it on without jostling his injury too much.
Being human is still a mixture of things. It’s still horrible nightmares but at least Dean’s in bed next to Castiel, holding him as he cries from pain and fear and anger. It’s sitting alone in the kitchen, feeling guilty about being taken care of by Dean. It’s the celebration that was held the day Sam and Eileen came back to the bunker. It’s that time when Castiel was sick for a week, and Dean and Sam and Eileen all took care of him. It’s visits with Jack that are too short but full of happiness.
of this was supposed to happen. But it did. And Dean is so glad it did because now he can’t imagine life without any of these people he loves so much.
“Yes, how dare he want to propose to the love of his life. What a horrible person.” Dean rolls his eyes.
Castiel puts his free hand over Dean’s and gives it a gentle squeeze. The pressure helped him in some way before.
Dean gently puts his hand on Cas’s face. “Yeah, this is nice.” He rubs his thumb over Cas’s cheek. “I would kiss you right now, but morning breath is truly the worst.”
But Cas doesn’t do that. Instead, he pulls Dean into a tight hug. Cas is still standing, and Dean is still sitting on the edge of the bed, so Cas tucks Dean’s head under his chin. Dean’s face is pressed against Cas’s chest.
Castiel holds the cat in his arms and says, “Hello new friend.” He stares into the cat’s brown eyes and smiles.
“Yes, I was.” Cas makes his way towards Dean. “But then I…annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back.”
In the middle of all that cooking and playing, Cas convinces everyone to change into the Christmas sweaters he bought them. They match. They’re red and green and gold and have a pattern of candy canes on them. A lot of pictures are taken. It’s cheesy, but Dean thinks they all deserve a day of cheesiness after everything they’ve been through.
Cas puts his hand back on the wheel and grins. “Do you want to hear “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen? You mentioned that you like that one.”
He’s back with his Dean with whom he shares a history. The Dean he always returns to because how can he not? How can Castiel stay away from his home forever?
“At least—at least he’s paying for my college. If he’s going to be an—an ass—ass—asshole, the least he can do is pay for my education so I can—so I can choose to remain on the other side of the country.” Cas shrugs, swiping at his eyes. “Like I said, it’s just—it’s just—it’s just—it’s just hard,” his voice falters, “when he’s here.”
. He hasn’t been able to fully calm himself down since he spoke to his father. He tried to go to sleep at 11PM, but after lying there, staring at the ceiling, thinking of all the reasons why his father believes that he is a failure, Castiel decided to go for a run. He was out of his dorm by 2AM on the dot. He made sure to dress for the weather. He’s wearing his favorite winter running outfit too. He calls it his bumblebee outfit. He’s wearing a striped yellow and black hoody with a bumblebee pin on it, a white thermal shirt under the hoody, black shorts, white leggings, and yellow and black running shoes. He’s glad he’s wearing all these layers because it’s
Castiel’s heart drops a little when he sees the tears spill down Dean’s face. Castiel understands why Dean’s crying and that he is shedding happy tears, but it’s almost physically painful to see Dean cry. He reaches out and takes one of Dean’s hands in his. Dean laces their fingers together.
Dean catches it and chuckles. “Man, I can’t believe we’re moving out.” Dean tosses a piece of popcorn at Cas as they walk over to the couch.
“Night Meg.” Cas mumbles. He leans more against Dean and the next thing Dean knows, they’re both on the floor.
“We should come out here together sometimes. It’s really beautiful in the mornings—especially now when it’s so warm outside and everything is in a layer of mist. We get a lot of bees and butterflies around here.” Castiel says.
Dean walks out of his dorm and waits for Cas near the bike racks. He listens to music on his phone. It took him forever to save up for this thing. He’s glad he’s able to pay for it with his library job. Working twenty-three hours a week needs to give Dean
Dean grabs the fire extinguisher out of the cabinet below the sink and stands in front of Castiel. “Watch out, Cas.” Dean aims the fire extinguisher and some kind of white foam sprays out of the can.
“I’m not Jack’s biological father.” Cas huffs as if that’s supposed to be obvious from what he has said.
Cas giggles and squirms away. “The kind who wanted to take a Romanticism class this semester.” Cas replies.
“Happy Birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Jack! Happy birthday to you!” Everyone sings and signs as Dean places the cake in front of Jack.
“Dean, I would never accuse you of that. I hadn’t even considered favoritism. You’re brilliant. I have no doubt that you earn your grades.” Cas says.
Cas nods and lets go of the wheel. He looks at his hands. Then at Dean. “What should I do?” he asks.
that Dean promises they will watch after the competition is finished. Dean creates a strange green creature and several colorfully clothed characters from something called
Eileen gets up and hugs Castiel. Castiel hugs his friend back. They pull away and Eileen signs, “I’m really glad you’re back. You’re the only rational adult here.”
A cool wave of…something…something gentle and soft but chilled rushes through Dean. Dean’s back is no longer bleeding, the hole is closed, the bruises and gashes he has accumulated from the fight are also gone. Dean’s heart feels like there’s barbed wire around it.
Dean wakes up to an empty space beside him in bed. He turns his light on and finds a big basket on his desk. The basket is full of colorful bath bombs, soaps, lotions, a fluffy blue towel, and a sponge. There’s a note at the bottom of the basket. It’s from Cas.
Hey everyone, online grad school's starting up again so I'm only going to be able to post maybe twice a week now. I think it'll be Tuesdays and Fridays. (Fridays for sure, but I'm not sure if it'll be Mondays or Tuesdays for the beginning of the week post).
Cas finishes getting dressed and Dean watches as Cas puts on bumblebee socks. The action should be endearing but it breaks Dean’s heart a little because he knows what bumblebees mean to Cas.
“Sam left. And,” Castiel’s not sure how to phrase this. Dean’s feelings about his father are complicated to say the least and he does not appreciate anyone saying anything negative about him.
Dean puts his hand over Cas’s hand—the one that’s touching his shoulder. He gives it a small squeeze—nothing to hurt Cas; never that—just enough for Cas to register a squeeze.
Dean looks at Cas who’s frowning with his head tilted to the side. As much as Dean loves Cas’s thinking face, he can’t focus on anything except the stuttering and loud beat of his own heart over the prospect of maybe living with Cas next year. Dean could get Cas that cat he wants to get him…it would be a perfect birthday present. But…Dean doesn’t need to live in an apartment with Cas to get Cas a cat. Cas just needs to live in an apartment.
see himself falling in love with someone who rolls his eyes with his entire body and is currently devouring his fourth cheeseburger.
“Aw, shit.” Dean puts his hamper on the floor, steps over it, and offers Castiel his hand. “We really need to stop meeting like this.”
“Uh, well, I’m an English major and a Creative Writing minor, so I’m taking a speculative fiction class and a poetry class. I’m pretty excited about the speculative fiction class. I’m hoping to sneak into a psych class for my science COL 200.” Dean shakes his head. “These general education classes are killing me. Um, I’m also taking that Milton class you mentioned for the single author requirement.”
Dean and Cas walk into Dean’s room and change into the pj’s. The pj’s have a red, green, gold, and silver galaxy print with Santa Claus in his sleigh being pulled by his reindeer.
“You are a child. You are questioning things that you are not meant to understand. Moreover, you are in no position to judge me, Castiel, when you are living in sin.”
Cas grins as he pulls away from Dean and says, “Yeah, we’re moving in together.” He grabs Dean’s hand and gives it a squeeze.
Dean shakes his head, trying to rid himself of thoughts of the blue-eyed-wonder, and checks his phone for the time. It’s nearly midnight.
television special. Castiel finds himself relating to Hermey, the misfit elf who wishes to become a dentist. That was essentially Castiel’s experience being in garrison after garrison…at least from what he can remember. It’s hard to put everything together after his memories have been so scattered. He just remembers a feeling of being on the outside. He was never a good enough angel. He was never a good enough anything until he met Dean Winchester…the Righteous Man. Castiel would have done anything for him. And the feeling scared him. Because Dean made him feel more than he had felt in his nearly infinite existence. Castiel was meant to serve Heaven and Heaven alone but the second he met Dean, that all fell to the wayside.
Cas nods and closes his eyes. He takes a deep breath. “I will need to cry about this later, so I would like a raincheck on that hug.” Cas says.
“That’s true, but you two need to put on some proper winter gear. It’s cold outside. You,” Dean points at Jack, “need to change because you are soaked and wearing a t-shirt. I don’t know if Nephilim can get sick from the cold, but let’s just be safe. Okay, Jack?”
They walk around for a few hours and sit together at the edge of the Sunken Garden and watch the sunrise. Castiel is sure that for the rest of his life, he is never going to forget the way the light slowly began to shine on Dean’s face. Castiel will never forget the relaxation across Dean’s features as he seemed to bask in the sunlight. Castiel will forever treasure this moment with Dean and sunlight.
Castiel sends Dean a text message, telling him he is going to do errands with Sam and then joins Sam in the garage.
Before he knows it, Dean’s pulling his keys and wallet out of his jacket pockets, jamming those into his jeans’ pockets, and taking off his jacket. He’s wearing a thick flannel underneath which is a lot better than the nothing that Castiel is wearing. Well…he’s wearing boxers. They have a pattern of cartoon bees on them, but that’s not going to do much against the cold. He’s not even wearing shoes.
he managed to get so much lint on it in such a short amount of time, but he sees a truly horrifying amount on Meg’s lint roller.
Claire smiles for a second. “Maybe I’m just tired. And I hate my current foster family because the dad’s a drunk and the mom’s an asshole.”
After presents, everyone pitches in to make breakfast. Castiel feeds Pumpkin in her new bowl with the cartoon bees that Dean bought her. Sam makes hot chocolate and coffee. Castiel and Jack make peppermint pancakes. Dean and Eileen make eggs and bacon and French toast.
And now, Dean sits beside Castiel in the Dean Cave and asks, “Hey, you wanna watch this documentary I found about bees?”
Dean laughs and hugs Castiel tighter. “You’re such a shit. And I love you so much. You’re so…so inquisitive. You ask questions too and you don’t settle for injustice. You call anyone out on their bullshit—myself included—and I’m a better person for it. You love fiercely, but you’re so gentle. The way you hold me in your arms is just,” Dean’s voice cracks. “There are no words.” Dean laughs but it’s uneven. “You’ve got the writer fresh out of words. You’re so kind and endearing. You’re such a dork and I love you for it. I love that you wear your bee outfits and despite all the shit you went through because of your father, you’re unapologetically you. Most days. I know you have bad days too. But man, you’re so fucking brave. You’re probably the best person I’ve ever met—but don’t tell Charlie I said that.”
Dean nods along as Cas talks even though he doesn’t exactly have much to say on the subject of sunrises.
Castiel gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom. When he gets to the bathroom entrance, he turns to look at Dean and asks, “Will you
Castiel wakes up to the smell of pancakes. He pats the space beside him in bed; the bedding is cold. Dean must have been gone for a while…which explains why Castiel smells pancakes.
“I know, it’s not fair. And I hate that I’m doing this to you. But, if I have to be stuck in time somewhere, then selfishly, I’d rather be stuck with you. Dean said I’m allowed to be selfish sometimes.” Castiel tilts his head to the side. “Granted, he was talking about the tv when he said that, but I think it applies to other circumstances.”
Dean puts the bowl down and reaches over to grab something, but he hits the bowl which falls over and the batter spills all over Dean. “Shit,” Dean whispers. Then he looks at Castiel and says, “See? We all screw up in the kitchen sometimes.”
Dean feels cold. Cas found the Queen tape. If Cas found it this easily, his dad might too. Dad doesn’t like musicians who are well…like Dean. No Queen, no Little Richard, no David Bowie, no Tracy Chapman, no Judas Priest, and no Melissa Ethridge. Dean has successfully kept a stash of tapes of anyone his dad won’t approve of hidden away since he was sixteen. Not even Sam knows about it. But Cas found this one so quickly. Too quickly.
“Yeah, I’ll try a cup.” He grins at Sammy. “Can I use the Batman mug?” He tries to look and sound and sign in an excited manner. He really doesn’t want to spoil the fun. It’s Christmas Eve and Cas wanted to do matching Christmas pajamas with everyone later. It’ll be pointless if they’re not happy whilst wearing said pajamas.
It does not help that Castiel brilliantly decided an hour ago that he would listen to the song “Do You Really Wanna Know?” by Sea Girls on repeat. That was a mistake because when Dean sent Castiel a text fifteen minutes ago, all Castiel could do was wonder if Dean really
Dean feels warm all over from Cas’s rendition of “You’re My Best Friend” by Queen. Dean hugs Cas tighter and says, “I’m never gonna get over you singin’ Queen songs to me.”
And now Dean is sitting in front of Cas—who looks so tired despite being an angelic being who isn’t supposed to need sleep—and Cas is close enough to touch and that’s all Dean wants to do: touch him, hold him, hell, Dean just wants to hug the guy at this point. Or…maybe touch pinkies, touch hands, hold hands. Maybe kiss…if Dean’s really lucky.
Dean’s not sure why Sammy looks ready to cry, but he tries to ignore it. He can’t do anything about it now. He also can’t do anything about the recurring images of his mom from when he was little that are playing in his head. They’re mostly from when he was five and Mom still smiled at him. They’re getting blurry…too much time has passed.
Castiel sends Dean the picture of the grumpy bumblebee he took a picture of in August. It’s his favorite bumblebee picture.
“Yeah but, I mean, won’t all the stuff happen once I meet you in 2008? I mean, at least I’ll believe then and you’ll get sent back home that day instead of waiting until 2021.”
Castiel’s phone buzzes and the email notification pops up. It’s the email he uses to contact Gabriel. Castiel opens up the email and sees that Gabriel has put a million dollars into Castiel’s secret bank account where he puts the money he makes from working at the Rec.
. Meg refuses to explain to Castiel how she knows Castiel’s new roommate, Crowley, and why she hates his guts. Castiel can’t piece that story together.
Castiel looks up at his father who is staring down at him, telling him all the reasons why what Dean and Castiel share is wrong. He’s telling Castiel about his investigation into Dean Winchester and how he knows all about Dean’s past. Father proceeds to describe the reasons why he believes Dean Winchester is trash.
Dean keeps thinking about that prayer as he wanders Purgatory, searching for Cas. He needs to find him. He’s not leaving without him.
“The way I see it, I don’t have enough info to make a judgement call on that. It sounds like you didn’t have a choice—or maybe you did, but the people above you forced your hand somehow. Or maybe you did it on purpose, but you clearly regret it now. And this happened years ago for you so why would I be pissed about something another version of myself forgave years ago? Assuming I actually believe you.”
“I’ve got you. You’re safe now. You’re with us. Sammy’s gonna be real happy to see you too—and Eileen and Jody and Donna and the girls. Everyone’s gonna be so happy you’re back, Cas. They love you. We all do.” Dean says. “It’s
Although…sometimes…when he’s alone, Dean can’t help but think that they would’ve been better off without their dad. Then Dean feels guilty for even
Castiel pulls up Spotify and chooses a playlist at random. “Longshot” by Catfish and the Bottleman plays first.
It’s really not the time, but Dean can’t help but yawn. He doesn’t mean to. He’s just so sleepy and warm and safe.
Cas tilts his head to the side and then nods. “Yes, I would like to sample some of the pie. You can have some of the cake too.”
Dean chuckles and gestures to his rug on the floor. It’s the perfect size for their impromptu picnic.
“Oh. Thank you, Dean.” Cas accepts the hoody and puts it on. He struggles to maneuver it to avoid his staples.
It’s definitely not to get to Dean’s dad. Dad talks a big game, but Dean has gone on hunts with his dad’s so-called hunting buddies and Dean knows full well that most of them can’t stand the man. A lot of the other hunters don’t even think Dean’s dad is any good at hunting. Dean would never tell anyone else that, but it’s true.
He takes a detour to the Sunken Garden. It’s too nice out here to go inside. Plus, he can sleep all day tomorrow because he doesn’t have any Friday classes.
Dean’s still not sure why he even wanted to go today. Closure? To see his mom? Those two things sound like terrible reasons to take a two-day road-trip.
“Dad,” Jack’s voice cracks as he hugs him for a moment and then says, “It’s hard to keep this open. We need to go.”
Dean tries to ignore the way his heart jumps. His dad always said that his mom fell for him because he was cute and knew all the words to Led Zeppelin. Well…Dean’s cute and he knows all the words to Led Zeppelin’s albums and Cas liked the tape and thinks Led Zeppelin is—nope. Don’t go there. The end of the friggin’ world is not the time to see if Cas feels the same way. It’s just not.
“I’ve got him,” Cas breathes, a hand coming up to cup the back of Dean’s head. Their foreheads knock together, then come to rest, touching. “I’ve got Dijwar trapped in my dreams.”
Dean quickly calculates out the day of the week. He curses. “I missed a video call from my brother,” he explains when Castiel alerts on his swearing. He starts typing out an explanation text for Sam, when his laptop screen lights up with an abrupt message indicating an incoming call.
Bart approaches Dean once the meeting has finished. He swaggers over with an insufferable grin plastered on his face, and Dean can already tell he’s going to hate what’s coming for him.
Dean doubts Castiel even knows enough about legacy to be advising on BEAU. It hardly feels like he’s been here more than a month, although he has. Regardless, it seems like Adler is more than happy to believe Castiel is handling legacy like an old pro, despite what practical efforts might have to say about that.
He hasn’t responded to any of Castiel’s messages, not since their Friday ended on such a sour note. The foul taste of it swept through his entire weekend, rotting any sweet thing Dean tried to do for himself. By time Monday came around, Dean could hardly drag himself out of bed, knowing his time with Castiel had a countdown on it.
“Last file’s been converted,” Dean calls over his shoulder. After a couple minutes spent sanity testing the legacy application, he updates the work order status, moving its assignee over to Anael. He updates their messenger app for good measure. “Done. Now to wait and see what Jo says.”
“Come on,” Castiel says, tugging gently on the belt loops of Dean’s jeans. “I have so much I want to show you.”
“I know,” Sam breathes out, harsh and reprimanding. “I didn’t want to bother you guys, but me and the girls are having trouble.”
The first touch of their mouths comes as a gentle graze of lips. Dean’s breath hitches, pulling back, disbelieving, but he cannot stop himself from pressing in again. Castiel’s mouth touches his, firmer this time, more assured. Dean tilts his head, adjusting the angle, leaning in to the hand Castiel has moved to cup his face.
Dean stills. He steps closer, exiting the orbital path he’s been pacing. “You got shot, Cas. Some idiot you were with figured silver buckshot would take the wolves out quick, whether or not you were in the line of fire.”
Dean curses, whipping around in time to see MC Joyce round the corner of the pergola, hands folded in front of her, an over-wide smile fixed in place.
“Alright, c’mon.” Dean tapped his knuckles against Castiel’s side. “Get dressed. We got about twenty miles to figure out how to explain to Sam how the cursed relic’s gone and the car now reeks of sex.”
Anael reviews a disappointingly short list of angels. “Akobel, I suppose. He’s well-suited toward compassion.”
Eventually, Dean nods. He wouldn’t dare argue with that. “So we’ll see him when we see him. That’s fine by me.”
Castiel sighs. “I don’t know. I should have. But you were already—acting like I was dead to you. I didn’t want to add more fuel to the fire.”
Dean can’t think of that. Can’t think of how broken Charlie had become once she let love back into her heart. Can’t think of how Sam’s voice broke as he held Eileen’s dropped phone and said:
“Wait, wait.” Dean held up a hand, laughing, as he pushed himself up the bed. “So all this time, you weren’t ditching me. You actually want to be my mate?”
“You were taking a long time.” Cas frowned at Dean, squinting out from beneath his hood. “You’re injured. Did something happen?”
Damnit. For once, the offer actually sounds tempting. Dean grimaces. “Can’t. Sam’s been checking in nightly ever since he found out I was sick.” He huffs out a laugh. “Think the kid’s forgotten which one of us is the older brother.”
“It’s done, Cas,” Dean mumbles half-heartedly. “Whatever the GMs think, there’s nothing I can do to make it change.”
Sam is breathing hard beside him, a cut on his head freely flowing. Dean himself doesn’t know what kind of wounds he’s sporting, but the rusty handprint on his shoulder is still intact so he counts himself okay.
Dean picks up a brush and a bucket of paint and gets back to warding, Jack following behind him like a wary dog looking for commands.
The corner of Dean’s mouth curls. “Brace yourself. These files are twenty-some thousand lines apiece. It’ll take about an hour each to edit and compress.” He glances at the time. “Production is in five hours,” he adds, perhaps unnecessarily.
The following morning, Dean wakes to an empty room, an empty bed. A note on the nightstand says the gang’s out on a breakfast run. Dean pushes through his routine and dresses perfunctorily, biding his time as the percolator stretches. The bathroom is damp with a recent shower, stuffy with the scent of Dean’s own aftershave. He digs through his bags but never finds his favorite shirt. He ends up picking out a black henley and tossing layers atop it instead.
A swarm of familiar faces pour down the stairs, over the railings. Angels with their weapons out; demons with their hands and faces twisted into claws and fangs.
Castiel doesn’t ask where Dean is taking him. He gets the impression — seeing how Dean’s meandering retelling skipped critical points, between Jack’s birth and his disappearance to the apocalypse world — that maybe these are things Dean has deemed important for Castiel to recall for himself. That maybe what’s coming is meant to help him remember all the rest.
Dean doesn’t know how to do this. They aren’t friends, but… “Still. Thanks.” He holds out his hand without really thinking about it.
Hours later, while Claire and Patience are busy summarizing what went missing from their notes, and Sam has reneged on his promise to play buffer and is focusing on the skogsra instead, Dean ends up the only one available to drive Cas out to the perimeter. Dean motions Cas out the door and keeps his mouth shut despite his displeasure at the task, preferring that the girls remain in the dark about the daytime drama currently unfolding. He’s not sure how Claire would take it anyway, knowing that Dean’s miffed the guy who looks like her dad isn’t willing to jump his bones.
A couple pillows are stacked at the foot of the sofa, resting atop a blanket that has been folded messily into squares. Behind the sofa lies a breakfast bar with two chairs tucked beneath it, beyond which is a modest-sized kitchen, furnished in dark metallic shades.
The faint mumblings of his hatred for Benadryl are cute; the coughing he expels straight into Castiel’s shirt collar are not.
The ruffled top of Cas’ head moved around in its nest. One hand came out. An elbow dug down, helping Cas sit upright. The bowl was taken up, balanced carefully on the blanket mounds atop his stomach. Dean watched from the corner of his eye as Cas took a few cautious bites, his generous mouth pursing as he ate.
Dean eats his jerky on the road, humming tunelessly along with the radio. Castiel peels his oranges in long, spiralling lines. He props the peel up on his thigh, and tucks stray pieces of whiteflesh inside the hollow sphere.The wedges burst brightly on his tongue.
