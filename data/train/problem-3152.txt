[30.3., 23:35] Castiel: Saturday night. I'm not gonna make you go Thursday and Friday. I might sneak out for those though
"Oh fuck babe. I swear I planned on cuddling." Dean moans and throws his head back to give Castiel better access.
[13.12., 19:53] Castiel: Mmmh, it would be nice to nib on your but while you finger your tight virhin hole
Christmas eve is busy and not much time for texting. But an unexpected gift and cuddles make an appearance.
[7.12., 14:23] Castiel: You wouldn't have had to tell her about your new found sexuality, you wouldn't have had to mention me.
"I called Jack this morning to invite them to breakfast. Guess what! He didn't want to. Because "we have the house to ourselves and after last night's shit show we deserve it." So . What the fuck happened to giving them the talk? Because Jack didn't want to tell me anything besides that it was a slide show."
Dean looks at Claire. "Sweety. I think Santana needs to go potty. Would you take her for me please?"
"I ... I'm not even sure myself. I thought you might not want to leave your car here, so I walked here..."
"Well, since you haven't been with anyone else since we've met, or so I would hope, being the only one goes hand in hand with being the first one."
They all pile into Gabriel's car and Dean has to climb into the back seat. He is shivering and can hardly feel his fingers.
"Its a lot of people. . . Like a lot but I want to at least check on Sam and Charlie. But I don't think I want to stay. That ok?"
They find what they are looking for quickly. Dean gets more and more gropy the closer they get to the exit.
"Fuck babe, I'd love to but I did not bring lube or condoms and I don't want to leave or cave." Dean moans.
They head to bed and Dean waits for Cas to snuggle closer so he can wrap him in his arms just like requested.
[5.1., 09:26] Dean: I spent all morning sorting books. I have to redo our finances from the date we hired Balthazar.
He returns a few minutes later. Castiel is still in bed. "Coffee is going. Let's go shower?" He holds out his hand.
[13.12., 16:50] Castiel: I have a faint memory of dad taking me to get our tree. I got to chose and he'd take any tree i wanted. Gabriel says we had the ugliest tree that year, but dad loved it because i had apparently told him every tree has the right to be a Christmas tree.
It takes 40 min but she gently knocks on the door, giving them time to cover up. She wrinkles her nose at the smell of sweat and sex in the room and opens a window before she leaves.
"We're getting pruney. "Dean says as he looks at Cas fingers. "We should get out. But it's warm and you're naked and slippery."
Cas takes a deep breath and clenches his jaw. He takes two long strides and stands in front of John before his fist connects with John's jaw.
Heat is pooling in Dean's stomach and his balls draw in tight. He can feel his orgasm building. He needs Cas to say it. He needs him to allow him.
"Yeah. Behind the shy accountant is a very strong character that could very easily bring me to my knees."
After breakfast he sits down in the living room and works on Benny's drawings while Dean focuses on his stream.
"Yes!" Dean moans louder than he meant to.  Pressing his face into the pillow, he waits for Cas to push in.
Dean takes everything out of the fridge and directs Sam and Castiel to make the salad while he preheats the oven and slices bread and spreads fresh garlic on it.
"Yes. He sorted the papers on the desk and tried something with the program... now these need to be resorted." He points at the stack of tickets. "And I need to find out what he did on the computer cause it's not doing its thing."
"Hmmmm. Tricky. Normal people don't inquire about their siblings sex life.... Tell her that unless it's been used you'll help her?"
Cas switches off the TV, takes off his shirt and lays it with his pants then puts the lights out and goes upstairs to the bedroom.
"Gabe." Dean calls out. "Cas is showering. He was covered in oil." He points to the back where the showers are.
"No, it's not uncomfortable like that. I am a bit worried about sitting for so long. We did a bunch of moving around today so I am not sure what to expect."
Dean kisses Cas cheek and gets up to make breakfast. A few minutes later he comes back upstairs and hands him  a cup of coffee. "Want to hide in bed all day and I bring you food here?"
" I really enjoyed it too. And then everything was fine until this morning when I got up and doubt settled in.
They walk to the bedroom together. Dean does a quick clean up while Cas undresses and then waits in bed for him to finish.
"Goth phase?" Benny perks up. "I'll need to see pictures." Garth nods. Before Cas can answer, the music starts and a woman comes out and starts dancing. Dean's mouth falls open.
"I'm not complaining but if you are massaging my shoulders and neck, why'd I have to take my pants off? Hmmm?" Dean chuckles.
Dean runs upstairs and packs their clothes and toiletries. Lube and toys go in the bag too. Not because he plans on using it but if the police come back, he'd hate to have it found.
"Long and boring. God soooo boring. But tomorrow attendance isn't. Anatomy and I think I'll just stay home and study here."
Dean leaves Cas in bed and heads to the bathroom. He turns on the shower and takes his clothes off, biting back a groan when he takes his pants and underwear off. His dick slaps onto his stomach, red and leaking from the last hour of rubbing down his naked boyfriend. He's about to step into the shower and jerk off when he stops. 'Fuck. ' He thinks to himself. 'I promised Cas to tell him when I jerk off.'
Donna nods.  " I like it.  But impractical for fixing cars or general day to day life but it brings out his eyes.  Good job. "
Dean eats his pizza and drinks his beer slowly. By the time he finishes it his body is ready to fall asleep standing up.
[2.12., 18:12] Dean: Everything kinda.  I like buying old cook books and recipes in thrift stores and cook my way through them.
[15.12., 21:07] Dean: Well I hope next time I meet him he won't be telling at me so we can compare strange knowledge
"I'll try." Cas stays in the tub a little longer, then gets out to dry off, dress in sweatpants and head for dinner.
Dean gets up and washes his hands and face. Then he grabs a washcloth and small towel. He comes back to the bedroom and stares at the bed. "I wish you could stay there all day till I am back from work." He sighs.
Even Santana and Lucifer seem to sense a change of pace and stay close to each other, curled into one pile.
Food and drinks arrive at the same time and after all the pizza has been eaten and a nice dent has been made into the beer, they all sit together and make plans for Dean's place.
"You've met him alone, let me do the same please." Sam asks and Dean nods. "I'll be waiting here till he shows up. "
"She said there's nothing to feel wrong about. We have a strong emotional bond, so I fit right into the demisexual definition, she said." Cas says while he files the papers away.
She stares at the last few messages from this morning. Innocent enough but Dean had already told her how not innocent it was the night before.
"I am not saying that God is a magical being. And the big bang is real. But what's so wrong about there being some purpose in the primordial chaos? What's wrong about believing, hoping, that we exist for a reason, not just some weird will of nature? I believe that there's someone who loves us all, who loves us even if everyone else has turned away from us. That there is love that wants to build us up when we're at our lowest."
"I feel like it though, I hurt you and not only did I hurt you, I even made you think it's because I don't accept your no."
[12.2., 13:53] Dean: Ok. Cool. Just let me know when you get there? I might stay longer at work . Roads are gonna freeze tonight for sure and Benny and Garth wanted to go to dinner but Garth is on call till 7.
By the time they make it back to Castiel's Street, it's pouring down. Dean starts running, still holding on to Cas hand and by the time they make it to the front door both are out of breath and laughing.
[31.3., 11:11] Castiel: Going well. Started on sketches for the mural. Waiting for Charlie to come pick up hers
"I do if I want to be successful with you in my life. Can we just agree that we both should have done stuff differently.  I should have been less of a cold hermit and you should have spoken up sooner? I'd like to try and get over this and restart tomorrow. Please."
Dean's eyes widen and he has a big smile on his face. He makes grabby hands at Cas like a kid in a candy store.
"Would you like to come over Friday and have a look at the place? We can have dinner, you, Jack, Dean and me."
[1.2., 10:36] Gabriel: Brother. You only left your house for shopping and spent all your time with that cat of yours. Getting you to come over for dinner was a struggle. Now look at you. Dates.. outside. Thinking of a career change. I think you are good for him because I know you. If you actually are his friends and family have to decide.
"You underestimate me." Dean laughs and licks a long stroke over Castiel's neck. He smacks his lips. "You taste like winter and cold. Yummy"
"I... i thought it'd be fun to shock you and your nerd friend. I might have forgotten that I had already told you otherwise."
Dean sighs and pulls Cas in for a hug. "It may not be a solved case,  but knowing we can be home soon makes me feel so much better. "
"Do I look like I'm not?" Gabriel asks. "Cas, you're hurting and the only remedy there is is Dean's love. Don't throw it away. If you do feel overwhelmed hide in your studio, but stay with Dean, kiddo."
"I'll miss your chest hair." He mumbles and kisses his way down to Cas collarbone and nibbles there before he moves on to the chest. He licks and kisses across the pecs and takes one nipple carefully between his teeth.
[26.4., 09:43] Dean: She grumbled something about her idiot son and then gave us a pop quiz. Kicked out a few students that took to long to grab their pencils…
"Check the cupboard for a thermos. Pretty sure Sam made coffee before he left." Dean calls after him."
"Thank you for coming over. Next time you come here we'll be just family and do game night. We totally should do that sometime." Gabriel smiles and hugs Dean goodbye "Oh my God!!! Who owns that Barbie car!!!" Gabriel shrieks looking over Dean's shoulder.
Dean grins and wiggles his eyebrows. "You gonna undress for me so I can watch you paint half naked?"
Drool is running down Deans Chin but his head is quiet. He is surrounded by Cas smell and taste. He loves it. He moans muffled by cock and grips Castiel's ass hard.
Dean moans and is about to wrap Castiel up in his arms to pull him closer when Sam knocks on the door. "Guys, I am home. It's Wednesday. Please."
"Yeah. I like how it feels. You look amazing in it and I got permission to touch and kiss. I like this. Sir."
Dean steps inside and closes the door behind himself without untangling from Castiel. It makes Cas smile.
"Hmm what? OK. Yeah I am up. I am up. Let's go." Dean stumbles while trying to get up and lands in Cas arms. "Hi."
Dean looks at Castiel with sad eyes. "I never wanted a partner of mine to feel like they had to do anything they didn't want to... it was my most important rule. Consent. Enthusiastic consent and I don't know why I didn't make sure I had that from you. I am sorry. "
Dean shakes his head. "I have no idea what to do. We didn't argue.  I just." He leans over to grab a beer. " you religious man?"
"That there's a damn huge variety." Cas tells him. "Also, that public opinion is mostly just scratching the surface. And most of all that 50 Shades is not a book about BDSM but about domestic abuse and rape."
"We should take a quick nap after breakfast in bed and then head out again. The drive home will take a while." Dean says.
[4.12., 06:39] Dean: And careful consideration I'd like to a: ignore those last 2 ish hours happened
Castiel sets up his easel and a comfortable chair and together they drag the old chaise lounge sofa from the garage in front of the windows.
"Hey." Cas chuckles. He takes hold of Dean’s shoulders and flips them over so he's kneeling over Dean’s chest.
Dean is moving his hips,  humping Cas when he wakes up.  He rolls onto his back and wraps his fingers tight around the base of his cock to stop himself from coming and groans.
Sam laughs. "I cleaned his litter box and picked her shit up in the backyard. It's only fair for them to like me."
Once they drop the left over paint with the neighbour, Dean finds a piece of plywood large enough and covers his kitchen window until he can find the time to fix it properly. As he screws in the last screw he looks to Cas who is holding the supplies for him. "At least with the extra hours I have been working, this doesn't rip too big of a hole into my budget."
"Ohhh. I .... I like the pictures. " Dean says. "Also shows me exactly what you like to look at on my body."
"Good. Almost done guys. Next up we have fingering. Same as before. Read up then ask questions. I'd appreciate it if you could ask Cas some too since he is the one with the most experience here."
Dean pulls out his computer and shoots an email to his teachers before grabbing a cup and adding a teabag. "Fine. Let's be adults over this." He hip checks Cas gently and smiles.
"No, sir. We also have this one here in hot pink and neon orange. It's unusual but we got all the rainbow colors in support of pride. My boss is showing his support to his eldest child. Kinda sweet if you ignore the insane parts." Mike laughs nervously.
"Are you? Good I mean? I was worried about you." Dean steps closer to Cas and wraps his arms around his middle.
[6.12., 20:15] Castiel: Well, Gabriel did most of the talking when he'd just called me back and he apologized profoundly and says he'll do whatever he can to make it up to us
"Anyways. We got all his school stuff and most of his clothes. He is staying at the guestroom far away from Jack's"
Dean follows Cas into the bedroom. He sits down on the bed and waits. Cas goes to the closet and gets a dress shirt and black slacks.
"I love you too. Thank you for today." Dean whispers and gently kisses Cas innocently. "Let me get in first and you sit in front of me?"
Cas moves his fingers and spreads them just a little. He pushes in deep enough to hit Dean's sweet spot.
Dean pats the mattress next to him. "Join me? I brought my computer for some mindless Netflix to keep your mind off whatever had you in that nightmare."
Dean points at the bag Cas brought. "Take that with you please. Cas went out of his way to get it for you guys."
Gabriel looks at him. "It's pretty early... what do you mean 'isn't able? It's the mom thing isn't it?"
[27.1., 10:39] Castiel: Cas huffs and gets up. He paces a few times up and down his office then he heads out, clocks out and locks himself in a meeting room to call Dean.
[2.1., 20:36] Dean: Let's keep bedroom activities aside seeing as you guys are related but I want to get him to naturally build more cuss words into normal conversations.
After they put away leftovers and clean up the mess Dean asks Cas to help him prepare for the Picnic.
"I.. I don't know. I wanna go and I am excited but I also feel bad for leaving Jack behind and I kinda wanna wait another year and work and make money but it feels stupid to do that for your first boyfriend cause everyone says first relationships don't last but what if I want to try? Long distance is gonna kill this faster than me trying to stay another year but I don't want him to feel like I am doing this for him but I kinda am but not in a way he should feel guilty about. And I know how much it costs and I know Charly helped make a lot of things easier already but I'd feel better if I could save up money first and pay my share but everyone is gonna think I stayed for Jack when that's not even the full reason even though it would be nice to go together and he refuses to tell me where he is applying at and it drives me nuts and we have been arguing and ... I don't know. Help."
"Sorry for messing with your mailman. But the look on his face was worth it. You'll be the main topic of his work stories now. "
[3.2., 15:27] Castiel: Oh she would probably have a field day if me and Dean came in for the same reason.
Dean looks at Sam.  "Ok, I bring you there and pick you up at around 9. OK? Tomorrow is school and I tend to be in bed by 10 usually. I chill with Cas while you are there. Oh and this weekend we are gonna have a talk. A sex talk. Either just you and me or all 4 of us together I haven't decided yet but it's happening. I am usually either at Castiel's place or he is here so if I am gonna leave the house to you on the weekend, I know you'll have him here and we need to make sure you guys are good and safe."
Dean goes to get dressed. "If I go for like 30 min to an hour, think we can snuggle then without you losing too much time for the drawing?"
Dean is hiding half in the fridge, bent over looking for food. His stomach demands something but he can't decide. He hasnt noticed Castiel so he keeps muttering into the fridge.
Dean nods. "I've been staying in the library after work and before classes. I didn't want to wake you up and cause you to little sleep. I may fear your wrath about sleep."
They make sure their alarms are set properly and have back up alarms as well. Cas falls asleep on top of Dean's chest.
Gabriel nods. "Sounds great. Now let's move. I am gonna use you being here for some free labor.  We need to move the hives into the barn."
"Same. I might go bother Jimmy and see if I can help. I'd love to see how far they've come as well."
The rest of the evening goes smoothly. Dean and Cas get to cuddle on the couch while everyone is watching a Christmas miracle on TV.
After breakfast they get to work making cookie dough for 3 different cookies and Dean gets started on the roast.
Dean's jaw is aching and he has a hard time keeping up the suction but he pushes through. He wants Cas to come into his mouth.
[7.12., 11:23] Dean: I have a reputation to uphold and don't want to become the laughing stock of this town
She is lucky and impatiently waits for an answer from Castiel, randomly touching the screen to keep the phone from locking her out.
"Just a few years. Trying to come up with cash to keep me and my son afloat. Hmm. Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned my kid at the first conversation."
After putting out food and handing out snuggles for their babies, they find themselves in bed. Cas on his back and Dean with his head on his chest.
Time flies by and when Dean opens his eyes again, the sun is setting outside, his jaw aches and he is drooling lightly.  He taps Cas on his leg and whines.
Castiel takes the tea bags from the cups and puts them in the trash and carefully takes the cups upstairs.
Sunday finds them sleeping in and waking up to an empty house. The note on the table reads that they either went to work (Donna) or to the farmers market ( Gabriel and Claire). Santana has been kidnapped to the market by Claire and Lucifer is sleeping in the bay window with no care for anything.
https://64.media.tumblr.com/782dafb52314eb5150ad3cf867df5678/300b5cc84bd16e80-53/s500x750/d557a281da6d311e62788384599fda874338296e.jpg
Claire nods and whispers loud enough for Dean to hear. "Mom found girls underwear in the laundry and was arguing with dad but he said it is yours."
[3.2., 15:07] Dean: I call her. I can't find shit on borderline dependency but codependency is plenty
"Charlie and Bennie seem to approve of you. Just, be careful with Bennie. He's a flirt. Sometimes doesn't know the boundaries but he's a good guy."
"You.... you made him say you look sinfull on your knees?" Dean giggles and tries to catch his breath.
"I'm not. But I don't want to get into that right now, if that's OK. I'd rather finish breakfast with you and then finish up Picnic stuff for later."
He gets to one of the windows and peaks inside. Santana and Lucifer seem to be asleep in the nest and he can see Sam in the kitchen making sandwiches.
"Back to the roots, babe. Texting. I'll be on you all day." Dean presses on last kiss to Castiel's lips and then heads out with his bag and dog.
"You said high-school rules.  If we keep going I'll come and that's very much not high-school rules. I am under the impression that we are just making out?"
Deans fingers spasm on Cas back when he bites down on a piece of skin, worrying it between his teeth.
He gets up and presses a kiss to the top of Cas head before he turns around and walks into the house.
"Yeah but Sam is really looking forward to having them. I am pretty sure Claire already offered to help too."
"I want to taste you so bad.  God if we had the time... so many things we could do... " Dean moans and sucks on the head of Cas cock through the lace.
"Hands, mouth or myself but fuck I wanna come. You look so fucking pretty on your knees in front of me."
"Ohhh, yes." Dean digs through the nightstand drawer. "Apple. Fine by me." He wipes his hands and uses the new lube to coat himself and Cas. He slips one finger in again and massages Cas prostate before he take a careful lick. "Not bad."
Dean turns to Gabriel.  "Shit, I don't think he has clean clothes. Uhm... see that door? Second to the left. My locker is the one at the end. Grab a clean overall and bring it to him? Showers are through the other door."
Dean comes home in a slightly better mood then the day before. He has to go bags in his hand and sets them down on the counter.
"Did? Did you treat me in a way that made me feel unsafe or scared enough to use my safe word? You respect me and what I like and don't like. You wouldn't go against my will. I said a lot of things while I could but red wasn't on my mind. You are nothing like him. Nothing you hear me."
Dean pees and washes his hands and face.  He sniffs himself and shudders. "I need a shower." He slowly walks back into the bedroom and sees Castiel missing.  He decides to go downstairs.
"I hope it works out." Sam says nervously. "What if I burn the house down while making food. Again."
"I hope I can do that, Dean. I've never been in charge of my relationships that freaking much. It seems like such a huge responsibility."
Dean hugs him. "You said yourself you miss texting. I do too. It was fun and thrilling. Not that it's boring now. That's not what I mean. It's just something that defined our relationship and now it's kinda gone."
"Okay. Like I told Cassy, I can't make him not move in. He's terribly in love with you. He trusts you and he's told me that both Jodi and his therapist approved. So, yes, okay. Do it."
Dean and Cas meet in front of Missouri's office and have just enough time for a.cup of coffee together
"If you want, sure. But we don't have plans this weekend. So you can leave him and the puppy here with us?"
[11.1., 15:41] Castiel: I've often wondered what it's like, but am too chicken shit to just turn up at one of those events not knowing anyone and not knowing what I'm supposed to do.
[15.12., 20:54] Dean: You might be shy and a bit oblivious about sexual things but you are very confident in your underwear choices
He places his hands on his knees. "You're such a teasing brat." Cas sighs. I wanted to spoil you today, but look at me now: desperately, aching hard because my boyfriend can't eat..."
"We can stay here too. I didn't mean to imply that I want you naked for sex. I like feeling your skin. Or do you mean for the plans tomorrow?"
Dean holds on to Cas' hip with his free hand and makes sure Cas doesn't go too deep. On one particular fast thrust in and out Dean loses focus for a split second and his finger slips into Cas.
Deans collapsed forward, ass in the air for Cas to keep fucking while he keeps up the steam of filth coming from his mouth.
Cas leaves as quietly as possible to let Dean have the few more minutes of sleep he can have, but Dean wakes up when the bed dips. He opens his eyes and looks at Cas' back.
"You didn't answer my question. Looking at how quickly you pulled up the shorts. It begs to question what else are you into?"
"I'm sorry." He apologizes breathless. He unclenches his fingers from Castiel's shoulder and pets weakly at his arm.
[13.12., 17:15] Castiel: No, I did like it. It was like I was involved but didn't have to have sex. That was nice.
Dean snuggled up to Castiel. Gabe and Donna are wrapped up on the other side and Claire is on the floor with Santana and lucifer. Halfway through the movie Dean looks down and snorts. Claire has fallen asleep with the dog in her arms and Lucifer on her back.
It's been a while. We noticed that since it's evolved from a just texting fic, days stretch out a lot. We have decided to not stress out and will just post whenever we feel like we wrote a good chunk but we are aiming for once a week or every 2.
They head for a late lunch consisting of burgers and fries and take a walk through the park to wind down.
https://64.media.tumblr.com/433b4852167f3b8b784c081096e87a2b/1d7d17fcc6c030b4-38/s1280x1920/6633e2f03e9c3a358c7a2d072b516a250e7c4850.jpg
"Because I don't like the new situation. I should be happy for you and for Sam, but I feel anything but happy."
Cas moves faster. Skin slapping. Fucking into Dean  harder than he had planned to but the tight heat surrounding him and the stream of filth falling fromhis boyfriend's mouth are driving him on.
Cas watches Dean get into his car and sighs lightly. He watches him drive down the road and once he can't see him anymore, goes back in the house.
[8.12., 21:38] Dean: And no I tried them on. The only thing holding them up is the waistband elastic
[13.12., 18:09] Dean : Our conversation has been very much leading into sexting territory but I am not even sure if you would instigate something like that
"Fine, but I'm gonna keep him longer then as well. You can pick him up and stay for dinner if you want. Haven't seen you in a while any way."
Cas smirks and pulls one of the blankets over Dean and himself. He puts his head on Dean's chest and goes to sleep himself.
"I miss you so bad it hurts. I'm so scared of losing you to your ambition. Not that ambition is bad. But it's keeping you from me and I'm being very selfish here."
Cas chuckles. "You're awesome." He affectionately runs his fingers through Dean's hair. "You look so pretty down there."
Dean smiles sadly. "I still feel bad that you felt like you needed to do something you didn't really want to. I am sorry. I promise I will try better."
They do dishes together once done eating and Dean turns to Cas. " movie and snuggles? I can put the cage back on. "
"Don't worry. I'll hook you up. I come by tomorrow again. Now. Where is Dean hiding the dog food? Princess is being moody."
While Dean takes care of the messy sheets Cas goes to the kitchen making coffee and starting to make cookie dough.
"God you're so sexy. I love when you let go." Dean moans and rubs himself against Cas back. "Look how much I am enjoying that plug.  It's hitting just the right spot. Watch Angel. I am about to come."
Satisfied with Cas at least trying to draw, Dean jerks himself faster and tries to keep his head still.
"I've told you many times that your art is too good to be just a hobby."Gabe says, strangely serious for once. "I agree with Dean that you should do it full time but I understand your need for financial security and freedom. I say take the plunge and go part time at the firm. Keep the shop hours and make beautiful things. And for the love of God let me start paying you for your work for me."
[28.1., 07:43] Dean: It was nothing. I wasn't gonna let anything bad happen. Sorry if I cut into couple time though
Dropping his head on the table, Dean groans. "I know. Doesn't mean I like this. Is this why you behaved so strangely today?"
Soon after they've finished their cake they excuse themselves and say goodbye to Gabriel's friends. Gabriel comes with them to the door.
[5.12., 19:33] Dean: Because I am confused and that stresses me out and that makes me do stupid shit like tonight where I over react to silly shit and then my brother worries and I have nobody else to talk to cause benni ignores the big gau freak out we had and charly would push me to explore this and its scary
[3.12., 08:25] Castiel: Kale, avocado, beans, tomatoes cucumber, cottage cheese, cheese... a lot and yes I got everything
Dean grabs the cat and goes up to their bedroom. It's been a lot of people and he just needs some quiet. Santana follows him and the 3 of them lay in bed, the pets on top of Dean and he scratches them while he has his eyes closed
[16.2., 18:42] Sam: Enjoy the ride. Make sure he drinks. He won't eat. He will cuddle and sleep. That's it. He is boring but at least he doesn't whine. His talking is funny as heck tho
They spend a few more hours in the studio before Dean yawns for the 5th time in a row and calls it a day.
Dean is looking out the window. "Its icy as fuck today. I am so glad we aren't going anywhere. I hope Charlie makes it here safely."
"He is kind. And I don't mean that in general. I was so sick and he took care of me. He cares about others, making sure they are fine."
"How can a couple consultant suggest that the couple separate?" Cas muses scratching Lucifer's ears.
As soon as Dean realises where his fingers are, he moans and stops moving, waiting for Cas' reaction.
[28.1., 12:17] Anael: I am going to need more details to this story.  What exactly did he say in what context
Cas heads over to him, his beer and a bright and colorful looking cocktail in his hands."Here." He hands him the beer.
[8.12., 12:58] Castiel: I feel a little bit drained after dumping all my shit on you. Which I'm still sorry for.
"That sounds amazing. Maybe for another time though. Tonight I'd like to just feel you." Dean answers before he licks across the head of Castiel's cock.
"No, it was. I just really didn't expect that much enthusiasm. And, now, like the useless asshole i am i killed it."
Dean looks down. " I don't think that's going to happen tonight. I am sorry. I shouldn't have stopped you earlier. "
Cas' first impulse is to call out "busy" but then he takes a deep breath and gets over to the door and opens it. "Yeah?"
"Castiel. They are your friends they don't seem like they would treat you like charity." Donna agrees.
[3.3., 13:52] Castiel: Oh, I like the plaid thong. The fabric feels nice beneath my lips. Not as nice as lace, but very nice.
"Not so bad yourself there babe." Dean answers. " By the way, it's gotten dark outside. I have no idea how long we've been in here but the day is almost over."
Dean nods. "I am sorry. I let myself fall into that sub head space without checking back if you where up for it. I just assumed."
[28.12., 18:03] Castiel: But he's angry and I'm stupid to think i had a chance. He was too good to be true
"Yes. I get that. I do. I don't ever want to see him hurt. I will do everything I can to make sure he will never ever have to be in pain like this again. I'd never touch him in this way, shit man, I am the submissive in this relationship. Do you get that? He is in charge.  Everything he wants. Sex? Yes. I will kneel and I will do what he asks of me. He says stop, we stop. Don't you get it? He is in charge. He is so strong to be here and do what he does. We worked and are working hard to stay together. Deal with our problems  and make it. And then assholes like you come along and try to break it. "
Dean smiles and gently pulls Cas up. "Not touching you is really hard." He says before kissing him gently and running his hands all over Castiel's back and arms.
"Its ok." Dean trudges into the bathroom and gets ready. Afterwards he falls onto the bed. "Help me undress? Please? I didn't think this through."
Castiel showers and prepares himself. He inserts a small plug with a bow sticking out into his ass. Back in the bedroom, he puts towels on the bed and then lays onto his stomach waiting for Dean.
"It stems from times when people were stricter about Lent to have all the things you abstained from blessed. There's the ham standing for the meat you forwent and the honey and chocolate eggs for the sweet things." Cas explains "and then of course there's also symbolism like the bread. The wheat grains have to 'die' to become bread. And the eggs that symbolize new life."
Big spoon ( Cas) and little spoon ( Dean) roles are silently arranged and after setting alarms for the next day they snuggle in.
[15.2., 10:09] Gabriel: Hey! Thank you. How are you? I heard about the tragic but very much welcomed death of your "car".
He has an email waiting that their ordered material will arrive in 30 min so he gets to making coffee and some breakfast. 'Cas will probably be in a grumpy mood once he gets woken up by the delivery people.'He thinks to himself.
"Well shit,  we got more done in an hour then I managed yesterday. Now I feel stupid. Maybe I should quit college and hire you as my accountant for my car shop."
Dean sits up gently and Castiel’s sketchbook catches his eye. He leans over and looks at the last page Cas was using.
"I ... no. We never. I knew she wanted kids, that's why I wanted out and did it in such a shit way. If she was pregnant I didn't know, she knew I wasn't ready and didn't want to have kids then."
"They aren't till spring so I have some time to prepare and I still have my books. Charlie can probably help me get stuff from the later semesters to see that I have everything covered."
"Ultimate happiness?  I'll try my best. So, codependency issues? How did you figure that one out? And if you say Google I will throw something at you."
"Awe. I am sorry. I didn't want to disturb you. I promise my plan was to wake you up now that I am clean. I need good luck kisses."
Cas cries out. "If you found g-spots just as well, your straight encounters must've been happy girls." He half whispers.
"It's hard to explain. I mean, I'm still, what was it? Demi-sexual? But it's not... these days, I like it more when the mood hits. I look forward to being intimate with you."
Charly manages to put Dean into bed and convinces him to nap. He has exhausted himself emotionally even if he doesn't admit it to himself.
Dean stands there stiffly waiting to see what happens next. He holds his arms tight to his body and keeps his eyes trained forward.
You ask to touch me. But touching you has only been me asking you if I could  you haven't shown or mentioned any want to be touched in any shape or form."
Once he hits the highway and the sun has warmed up a little bit, he rolls down his window, turns the music up and grabs Cas hand.
"Theodicy. The question of  how there can be a loving God with all the misery in the world. Lots of philosophers have devoted themselves to that topic."
"Ok." Dean lifts his hips and wiggles out of his pants and underwear. He kicks off his socks too and Cas copies him.
"I'm in my thirties, Dean." Cas shrugs. "Do you have any idea how many weird looks I've gotten at the office in my twenties?"
Food is good but conversation is stilted with Sam and Jack still feeling off after the talk at the clinic. It takes a burger and 2 milkshakes each for them to finally lose up and start acting normal.
"I should send him a good night text like we always do. I haven't went to sleep without hearing it or reading it in months."
Dean spots Sam and walks over to him. He wishes Jack a happy Easter and pulls Sam to the side. They are talking animatedly.
[22.2., 11:48] Dean: Almost done with school  I will definitely need help with the make up work so I don't get lost
"We went to therapy and made plans for Sam's future. Adulted . What plans do you have for me?" Dean grins. "Are you staying after all?"
Dean changes into soft pajamas and a soft shirt to comfort himself and cleans up around the house. He starts laundry and keeps checking his phone but there is nothing from Cas.
Dean heads to the store and grabs stuff for stew and fresh bread. He heads back home quickly and gets to making the bread dough as it has to sit a while. Cas is still drawing in his little corner and Dean is not sure he even saw him come in.
[28.1., 10:26] Donna: Castiel, how are you dealing with the new situation. Gabe said you felt awkward about Sam living with Dean.
"Don't be such a teenager please. We left respectfully on your birthday and will text before we even leave the house to come over. Do we have a deal?"
"I did nothing. He is at his b.. best friends house. I told him to go there as soon as I heard you are back. Now fuck off."
Cas suggests they watch in the bedroom, fully expecting Dean to fall asleep again and Dean reluctantly agrees and follows him up the stairs.
"Look. Four fingers and moaning for you and just for you. I wanted you to come and fuck me so bad. I almost messaged you."
"Dammit Gabriel, you're one of the strongest advocates of my right to have a no accepted as a no. Why does that only gave to be in my sex life? Can't that be the same about a blanket fort?"
"I am 100% certain you are not an asshole. " Dean answers and quietly adds: "You are nothing like Arthur either."
"I haven't gotten any complaints." Dean smirks and licks over Cas limp cock. "Think you can get hard again?"
Dean shakes his head. "After all the anger management classes, I decided against it. No need to risk anything."
"I don't want to quickly come before the day starts, sir. I want come with your cock inside of me. I want to be fucked please. "
Dean rucks the shirt up, pulls it over Castiel's head and throws it somewhere behind him. He lets his hand wander over Castiel's skin, scratching lightly through the hair that's slowly been growing back.
Zeke and his family are the last to arrive and Dean shows them the garden as well as introducing them to everyone.
Dean smiles. "Good. I liked watching you react. I like when you lose yourself. It looked like you couldn't help yourself   but to jerk off."
"Then do it. Stay, work, save money have time with Jack and most importantly have time for yourself."
Dean stops at the grocery store and the pharmacy and picks up his pills before he heads home. Rufus had told him to stay home after Missouri left and going to work would only result in Rufus driving Dean home again.
"Donna? Is it really okay if we stay here? Aren't we putting Claire in danger if we're really being watched?"
"Hmmm. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I took your job offer knowing there'd be travels, so yeah.... I mean, it's a little short notice and shit timing, but saying no would be moronic."
[8.12., 15:27] Dean: And I'm scared that if we finally see each other I will have made it all up in my mind
He drives them to the nearest Walmart and parks close to the entrance. "I ... this is torture. I love it." He smiles. " but no worries. No floaty thoughts."
[29.1., 09:41] Castiel: I really should become a stay at home artist. Just so i can sleep in every morning...

[22.1., 15:02] Castiel: Because by the time I'd get there you're gone and Wednesdays you have school in the afternoon now
Dean hears the car arrive and goes to greet him. "Hey Cas. Come on I show you where you can put your stuff and introduce you to Rufus."
"No. I promised I am coming. So I am. I ...I am... I am really nervous. And scared." Dean answers quietly.
Cup in hand he walks upstairs and sits on the side of the bed. He cards his fingers gently through Cas's hair.
Sam smiles. "I haven't been interrupted like that as much as you guys. I am sure practice makes for being more relaxed. Good night Castiel. "
"Oh, yes, hair day. If we like it, will you teach Dad so he can do it when you're not here?" Claire asks.
"Because you don't believe me. Because you doubt everything I do for you because you think I don't want to do it but I do. I wanted you."
"Fuck right there.  Don't move." Deans cock between them is  leaving a wet trail on both their bodies. "I am gonna come again. Touch me. Fuck please touch me."
Dean nods and snuggles deeper into the nest. "I got emails back from my professors. I am good for today, they accepted my homework and sent me the stuff they are teaching for the rest of the week. I think they decided I should stay home. "
"Really? Fuck." Dean feeds his cock into Cas' mouth. "Oh god. Sir. Pinch me if it's too much please."
The night from Thursday to Friday, Dean is restless and doesn't sleep well. He finally gives up around 4.30 in the morning and heads downstairs to leave Cas a few more hours of peaceful sleep while he goes over his notes one more time.
Dean parks the car in front of Cas's house. "Did you leave them there?  I can see if I can get them clean but no guarantee. "
"You left to clear your head of church talk? Look, I know you don't come from a religious background and I understand that that makes it hard to understand our belief. But you fucking left him behind feeling bad about himself, about his believes? You're such a fucking moron!" Gabe groans angrily.
[28.1., 11:06] Gabriel: Yeah. How's my brother taking it? Donna didn't do too well when I moved him in.
[13.12., 12:40] Castiel: Hmmm... well, thank you. I will. I'll change now and enjoy my food. What did you get there?
[13.12., 16:42] Castiel: I actually have those two from Yankee candle cause I love thise scents so much and they captured them perfectly
"The dude said to get a rental and have them bill them." Dean points out. "We can look online and make sure you got a car by Monday."
"Shhh." Dean chuckles. "Stop being such a bitch. He sucks and we know that. We got the law tentatively on or side. Please shut up right now."
Dean doesn't move from his seat in the kitchen until his phone alarm goes off to let him know he has to go to work.
"Honey I am home!" Dean yells when he walks into his house but Cas doesn't hear him in the winter garden with his music on.
Dean, still on all four, drops his front and rests his weight on his shoulders, his head to the side and ass up in the air facing Castiel.
"Oh, good. I should see her too. It still sucks that everything was so great yesterday and now I feel like thrown back by years."
"Noooo. Come back! Don't leave me Darling." Dean wails dramatically and falls to his knees reaching for Cas.
Dean clears his throat. "Ok then. Next slide. Hand jobs. Pretty self explanatory I think. Any questions?"
"I have my safeword and I am not tied down. .. I wouldn't mind that but I know you don't like that. I'd tell you if I didn't like something."
He wraps his leg around Cas hips. That move puts his cock in the V of his boyfriend's hip. He can feel Cas hard and hot on his own hips. He moves his hips slightly and kneads the ass in his hands.
Dean chuckles and sucks a mark onto Cas' collarbone. He runs his hands to Cas satin covered ass and squeezes.
"I am just exhausted. I wanna curl up and sleep. Staying in bed for school has my body thinking it's weekend."
They are led to a small table in the back away from the busy to go counter.  It's the only table with a vase and a rose on it.
Dean makes himself busy in the kitchen and comes back a few min later with a plate filled with cut up vegetables and sandwiches with different toppings.
"So, those things you want us to write down tonight, how many, how detailed? How should that be done?" Castiel asks.
Dean leads him outside and shows him the patch. "Now. What flowers do I need to plant so that you can watch bees from the studio?"
Dean's hands are grasping at the other man's back. Running up and down. He wants to grab his boyfriend's ass but is afraid to make the move so he doesn't ruin the mood.
"Yeah, it was. I kind of enjoyed it too. Apart from you not being there I could actually imagine going to bee fairs more often."
Dean pulls on Cas' hips to put him flat on the bed once he is shirtless. He straddles his lap and leans down. "This ok?"
"And you. Or us . It's ok." Dean follows him and gently pushes him onto the bed. "You need sleep after the exciting day you had and I plan on not letting go of you until I have to."
He turns them around, lifts Castiel onto the counter and stands between Cas' legs. His hands drift over the sleeves of the robe up to the shoulders, down the back. He rests his hands on Castiel's thighs.
[26.1., 10:36] Dean: The bet I have with him. I think you cussing when talking to him will be enough
Dean hollows out his back, pushing his ass further out. He had imagined what it would feel like having someone else touch him there but this was so much better. He pushes back towards Cas finger, trying to beg for Cas to push more.
Pushing his fingers underneath the fabric, Dean rubs the skin under Cas balls with his thumb while his index finger pushes against Cas hole.
[28.12., 18:12] Dean: Listen bud. I am probably not the person you want to talk to right now but I am all you got right now.
Dean kneels on the bed behind Castiel and presses kisses to his neck while mumbling:"Good morning Angel. Wakey wakey."
Dean puts his hands on Castiel and strokes his back and chest. Everywhere he can reach. "Why am I kneeling?"
Dean drives back with Lucifer after having tricked him into his transport box with goodies. He has Cas sketchbook with him and the canvas he has been working on.
"I ... I didn't exactly want to stop, but I didn't want to ... i wanted your input, i wanted snuggly sex, but you didn't want to think and you wanted more, so i gave you that."
"I think it will be fine. Give me your shirt?" Dean holds out his hand. "I am gonna put it in his bed so he has something that smells like you."
"You can hide them all under your work clothes. Sorry I didn't ask before I marked you." Dean looks at his work and runs his fingers over the marks.
"Ok. Deal. I'll get the paperwork ready. Do I need both of you to sign or is it just you on the deed?"
[13.1., 10:02] Dean: Did you quit your job? Cause you make it sound like you quit and work at the garage?
"Thank you for giving me attention. I am sorry I was annoying. I am thrilled to see what you are making me."
[27.4., 08:41] Castiel: She went straight to the couch, laid on it stretched out and won't move anymore. She's a dead, exhausted princess now…
"Yes. It was. It really was. And it is also huge that you're offering me to be your partner. I'm 90% certain I want to do that. You have earned way more than just a few brownie points and I'm very sorry I act like a stubborn child. I'm sorry."
"Let's eat." Duma says putting a hot casserole dish on the table. Elizabeth comes crawling out of her play tent and climbs on her chair.
"Thank you guys. I am sorry he made your work harder. I'll talk to him. Just, don't be mean to him please. He was very upset over messing up and getting yelled at."
"Don't be nervous babe. I am very much looking forward to this with you." He grabs Castiel's hand and heads down the road.
Cas leans up to lick the head of Dean’s cock. He runs his tongue over the vein, then closes his lips around Dean's cock
"Good morning. I take it I disturbed those two by snuggling you?" Dean asks while pointing at the pets still on the bed.
Dean smiles sadly. "Same." He takes a deep breath. "But I'd rather have him there then with John... or worse, the foster care system."
[20.1., 11:33] Dean: Because I didn't call her when I spiraled last night but burdened you. She specifically told me to call her after our appointment
Cas chuckles and Charlie goes back to the kitchen. "Alright Sam  Dean  is still in crazy dream land. Message me if you need something, sweety."
"It's totally fine to feel confused. Don't worry about it. And you can always just go by queer and use the rainbow flag. Don't pressure yourself to fit into one or the other."
[12.1., 09:03] Castiel: I will check with my head of department and with HR if I'm allowed side jobs...
"Cas! That's not the point. The point is that I already know waaaaay too much about you two and I really just didn't need to know that too."
Dean smiles into the kiss and moves his hand to stroke over Castiel's chest. "You waxed again. You are all smooth."
"We'll ask him tomorrow? See what furniture you want from your place here and what he can use. And he'll need a ceiling for sure."
"Once either one of you is this happy to see me, you'll be greeted like this as well." Dean gets up and ruffles Sam's hair.
Dean grabs Cas's face gently with one hand and pulls him close for a gentle kiss. "You two getting along means a lot to me. Thank you for coming back and trying."
Cas kisses the top of his head when the plate is empty. "You got to come back to planet earth, boy. Dinner is finished."
Castiel takes his hand and kisses his cheek. "So. The stuff to do is those calls, right? We can do that wrapped in blankets cuddling on the bed, can't we?"
Want to join us for dinner and a movie at the retro diner Sunday? And do you have Benny's number? Could you ask him?
[20.1., 09:37] Castiel: I don't remember,  i think i only wanted to know what to expect at my appointment.
Castiel’s hips buck and his back arches. His hand pushes just enough for Dean to be pushed down further and he moans loudly.
Dean looks out into the garage and checks if anyone is there. When he sees nobody he slips off his chair and kneels next to Cas on the floor and puts his head on his lap.
After Dean is securely put away, Charly runs into the kitchen in the hope that Dean's screen is not locked yet.
https://64.media.tumblr.com/68521d2098d2b1fe5cbe6800e126963b/300b5cc84bd16e80-2a/s1280x1920/ca7c77545de5bab6d5d056f390db1f1d3b5a076c.jpg
The lasagne is done first and they have dinner while the pie bakes. Dean keeps looking longingly towards the kitchen.
"I thought we're talking about me, not you. You're absolutely Hufflepuff with Gryffindor tendencies."
"Thank you for coming over today.  I think getting my head screwed on right this morning was needed."
"Okay." Cas agrees, he chooses some of his drawings and paintings and places the orders at his top 2 printers choices.
Dean hugs him tight.  "Don't be scared of weather or not or sex life is enough. If I jerk off alone for the rest of my life,  that's OK as long as I get to spend it with you. "
Cas drives them to the restaurant. After he parks he gets out and runs to the other side so he can open the door for Dean. "Awwwwe thank you babe."
"Clair knows how to handle a gun and how to handle herself. My house is set up with an alarm system that calls the police right away. Don't worry Cas."
"Oh please. Like I didn't just freak out over nothing myself. I'd love to have kids. Adopted or biological.  Mine or yours. I don't care. But not right now. Another plus side of us both being men is that we do get to plan this out . No sneaky or accidental babies." He carefully kisses Cas cheek. "We can have all the baby making fun without the fear of making a baby."
Cas stretches before turning around and curling back up again. Dean watches him with a smile and gently kisses him between the shoulders.
The sun is setting by the time they enter Zurich and the sky is a dark purple once they check in to their motel for the night.
In the bedroom Dean is putting the last finishing touches on the nest when Castiel walks in. " Hey Angel. What do you think?"
"Your Castiel?" Zeke raises his eyebrow. "Is something wrong?" He asks a little worried about their relationship status.
Dean pulls back and kisses Cas gently. "My time to apologize for being sensitive?  It's just a couple books and a movie but... I'd love to watch the movies with you. Now, what house are you?"
"We didn't have that. We went from texting to sexting to meeting and falling in love.  Show me your moves?"
"Fine. . . Thank you for attending for me. Please take the time away to think this over. I don't want to argue. I don't like it. "
Dean sighs. "I need to know you're sure. I... I can't. I am sorry." He shuffles out of bed. "I... it's not that I don't want you... I do." He looks down to his dick. "Clearly. But... I... I am nervous that this is just because I got turned on..."
"Uh..." Castiel makes and looks at Dean. "I - uh... think - I think we're... we're probably this uncomfortable because it's-" he pauses.
Dean moans and moves his hips faster while traveling his hands to Cas cock, rubbing his hand over the fabric. "Feel this? Do you like it?"
[22.1., 12:05] Castiel: That's what I am not certain of yet. It's either us + 4 or + 5 people. Though i don't know if the 5th has a +1
They spend a long time outside and manage to build 2 snowmen side by side in Castiel's front yard. Complete with old hats and potatoes for eyes because who still had coal in their house. Dean tries exactly once to stuff some snow into the back of Cas' shirt but the man sees him approach and levels him with a stare.
Castiel smiles softly. They had mostly taken turns bringing in breakfast or had gone to some diner. He had enjoyed their trip a lot.
Dean jumps at the first sound of the bells and squints his eyes as the I side of the church becomes brighter.
"It's okay, I didn't expect you to know. It's not like we kept in touch much after. I'm from another county, I went to the East coast for college."
"I've been watching you, yes. I've brought your coffee in a thermos, didn't know how long you'd sleep."
He walks forward slowly but he is focused on Castiel and walks straight past Gabriel who is just staring at him.
Dean keeps waking up because Castiel is thrashing and whimpering. He trys to calm him down by running his hand through his hair gently. Castiel whimpers.
"Or us." Cas scoops some pasta on Dean’s plate. "If we're not careful we ... I don't even know what'll happen to us."
"I'm making scrambled eggs." Cas tells him as he sets a plate of cut fruits and veggies in front of Dean.
Dean groans his way into being awake like he does almost every morning.  He also likes to wrap himself around the warm body next to him in order to avoid getting up. This time his movements cause a yelp and a hiss. Startled he sits up and looks at 2 matching sets of eyes throwing him judgemental looks.
[5.7., 11:45] Dean: Don't. . . We are off for today. Just come home please. We have an appointment with Dr. Mills tomorrow. I am on my way to see Missouri.
"Dean!" Rufus calls him. "Think you got the time for an oil change and teaching the owner how to do basic car care checks?" Dean looks at him confused. "Uhm yeah. Sure. I need about one hour to finish this up if you want to pencil them in?"
"Hold on. " Dean takes out several ribbons and digs to the bottom of the box. "Ha! Found it." He sits back and turns to Cas.  "How about this." He holds up a small leather bracelet. "If you are up for being in charge you wear this. If I don't see it on you, I won't try to ... you know."
Dean is frantic. He is excited and scared. Cas in his bed sounds great in theory but he never shared a bed with a man. He picks up a few stray things from the floor before he puts on pajama pants and his softest shirt.  He lays nervously in bed when he hears a car pull up to the house. It takes a few minutes for him to hear the door open and close and he listens carefully to the steps making it slowly to his bedroom. When Cas opens the door he is backlit by the Christmas lights and truly does look like an angel. Just a very sleepy one. Dean holds open the blanket and when Cas finally climbs into bed he shuffles closer. They look at each other for a few minutes until Cas takes Dean's hand and turns around, wrapping Dean's arm around him and pressing his back to Dean.
"I want to see if I can become friends with the idea of bees and maybe later down the line you could set up a hive here?"
Cas frowns. Dean raises his hand slowly and moves some hair out of Cas's face. "I love you. I don't think I want to know how your exes have reacted to fights but I am not going anywhere."
"We're just cuddling. We don't bother getting dressed. You don't even care that I'm still half hard..."
"You like the thought of torturing me?" Dean chuckles and then moans when cas hits his prostate again.
[2.12., 12:42] Dean: I am sorry. I thought that was the point of 20 questions. To get to know someone
"John didn't really give us much of a choice.... anyways. You look good tonight. Of course I had to get close."
"You look so sexy with your shirt open." Dean rasps and leans forward to kiss Cas neck. Cas tilts his head so Dean has more skin to access.
"I ... one sec." Dean grabs Cas hips and pulls him closer. He pushes his lace covered, hard cock into Cas crack and moves his hips. "Oh god this feels amazing."
Dean sprints off to the bedroom. He takes a few minutes to calm down and stop his cock from trying to get hard.
Cas sighs. "I don't know. I was really angry, and he was very disappointed and ... things were crap the last time we texted."
"Hey Gabe. How are you? Yes everything is alright. Pretty awesome actually. I... no we have a favor to ask."
"I... I never thought I could have this. Pretty underwear was this forbidden thing... and now. I love you so much."
Dean opens his eyes and feels someone's warm breath in his neck. He thinks it could be Charly but she'd be all over him octopus style. He's learned that the hard way through many movie nights.
"Uhm... as embarrassed as I am about my freak out, I'd like to not be alone. I know the meds are not a quick fix but I'd like you to stay with me till I have them. Maybe next week we try that homework?"
https://64.media.tumblr.com/f6c5086a11bc44703dc34a161738915a/36d6c62629a8bba5-f7/s1280x1920/83bcec5eb994aead4b2fc7179aaf279125b9eaeb.jpg
"Ah, I see. Well, Mr Novak, I can have your car towed to the station and have it checked for fowl play, if you like?" Donna suggests while Gabe heads to safe Cas.
Dean sits down on the floor next to Castiel and pets his dog. "So, we established that we are not breaking up. What was up today? Where was your head?"
"Ok. Calm down. He didn't sound upset and I am sure they would have woken us at the first sign of Gabe needing them if they wanted to.
"This is a set up. This was all planned and all of you have set me up! What do you want? Are you after money? I knew that filthy fag bitch wouldn't keep his mouth shut about the inheritance. "
Cas had been back in the kitchen decorating the cookies he had made. He hurries to the window and looks outside. "DEAN!!!!" he yells and runs out the door in just his sweatpants, shirt and house slippers.
"I didn't want you. You could have been so much better but you had to turn out a failure. " Michael spits angrily.
"Come." Ezekiel says and leads them into the dining room where his wife is putting finishing touches on the table.
"Is he coming alone or bringing his family babe? If he brings his daughter we should set up the pool again. She liked it and it's gonna be hot today. And what time?"
Dean doubles his efforts. He wiggles his finger deeper and sucks cas cock harder. He fights against Cas pulling him off.
Gabriel sighs. "I can't stop you from making your own decisions. I am unhappy with this. Very. I hope everything goes well but his police record worries me. Please be careful."
"I love you. Oh God I love you." Dean widens his knees to have more leverage and turns them around so Cas is on top. "Come on babe. Make yourself get off."
Cas holds onto him tight. "I was so scared and disgusted with myself, but I... for you Dean. You do anything for me, so I want to give back."
Cas gets the spare key and lets himself inside. He takes a deep breth before he goes upstairs. He feels like a creepy asshole sneaking into his boyfriend's house.
[22.12., 09:03] Castiel: You should've told md earlier, tgan I'd have taken your dog on my morning run with me, so you could stay in bed.
"Of course. You can have your old room if that's OK. Kinda like to keep Jack's room open even if he isn't here much anymore."
The cats tail is puffed up as he walks through the house checking everything out. Santana follows him in respectful distance after she got swatted once in the beginning.
[28.1., 10:38] Donna: He just moved you in. There was no place for you to go and we needed you to have a home.
"I am sorry you felt rejected. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I was busy being down on myself."
[3.12., 20:01] Dean: Why is it ok for men to fuck around but as soon as a woman does it its all like " ohhhh, she's a loose woman."
[30.3., 11:09] Dean: How's your day. I finished school and now I am at the shop. My tow truck duty starts at 4
They get dressed quickly and head over to Charlie's place. They can here the music two streets over.
"Uhm... Dean?" Gabriel comes over with a new can of coke. "Have you guys had any contact at all today?"
Gabriel shakes his head. "You guys... anyways. I got a load of veggies in the kitchen and was wondering if Dean would like to figure something out or if I should make dinner today."
[8.12., 09:57] Dean: However, not my point.  So you and your ex lived together. Is she your only ex?
Dean whines.  "I... uhm... are you coming to the shop today? We could stay late... until everyone is gone... I could blow you under the desk."
Garth leaves at 5 and says goodbye to the both of them. Next up Rufus leaves just shortly after 5. Dean checks that he screwed on everything correctly and closes the hood of the car he was working on. He walks to the office and knocks.
Dean walks into his house. Sam is home but in his room. He left some soup in the kitchen but Dean isn't feeling like food at all. He goes upstairs to his bedroom and changes into the softest underwear and pajamas he owns and dons on fuzzy socks before he goes back to the kitchen to check on Cas.
"Oh god. That was not a nightmare moan. Nevermind. Glad you feel better." They can hear Sam's quick steps down the hallway.
"Can.... can I take of my panties? I don't want to mess them up. I... I want . I want to be naked... naked with you" Dean moans and grabs onto Cas ass.
Dean does. Sucking the fingers like its Cas cock. Running his tongue around the tips and boping his head. He's breathing harshly as his hips keep moving up towards Castiel's, seeking friction.
"Yes. Yes it is. But I'm not selling my house. Sam is going to live there. And if things go sour I can kick him out and go back, right? Right?"
"That went better than expected. We owe Charlie a lot." Dean says and looks at Sam in the mirror. "How are you holding up Sammy? "
Dean wakes up with a start from a nightmare and reaches for Castiel. His pillow is cold to the touch. Dean's heart starts beating faster and he looks around the bedroom. The house is quiet and he starts to worry.
[13.12., 16:45] Dean : One of my few memories of my mom is buying seasonal candles after the seasons
[15.12., 23:13] Dean: And I am sure popular shit only goes over your head because its been just you and lucy for so long
With his plaid thong his ass is hanging out the back . Castiel gets up to help Dean stand up steady.
"I need to know what to avoid or how to behave do you don't do anything just for me, forget  about yourself. Please. How did you sound to yourself?"
Castiel hears and recognizes thd sound way earlier than Gabriel. "Time for lunch, brother!" He calls out.
[4.2., 09:07] Castiel: I don't know how to price!!! It's always been a hobby, not something to make a living.
"So do I." Castiel agrees. The thought that it's not a recent picture makes him feel a little better.
"No. But we both know we're fucked up in one way or another. I think the sex part would be funny cause it's not a big deal and would ease her into the mess that is our combined issues."
" uhm ... they are from my first order... I am pretty sure you picked them out." Dean pulls up his pants over his ass and settles the waistband on his hips. "Actually I think you said you'd prefer to see these on me then the plaid ones."
Gabriel swallows. "Donna didn't know I stole your file. She's furious and I am in deep shit for risking her job."
[31.3., 12:09] Dean: The second one is on my couch when you got us off despite Sam being in the house
Gabe shakes his head. " You have every right to be mad at me. Lord knows I am beyond proud of you for actually holding a grudge.  It just sucks that it's me. "
Cas licks Dean's dick clean before he stands up. "Yes, I'd love a hug very much. Would you like to be little spoon tonight?"
Castiel bites his lips at their combined weight that puts additional pressure on his bladder, but the sight is way too adorable to shoo them off.
The pets sleeping in the guys bed means that Dean gets woken up by a grumpy, food demanding cat right in his face.
He dials her number and when she answers he breaks down. Everything spills out of him. The entire month and what happened. Cas exes. The dirty messages the kisses the sex but vaguely and everything on his mind all the way to now. It's been an hour and Dean is still talking. Babbling about everything and nothing.
Cas thrusts harder. "So close. So very close. Oh God Dea-" Cas grabs Dean's hand and squeezes as he comes.
"Did you ... did you read up on this stuff? I didn't expect anything like this to happen and ... you seemed prepared."
[3.12., 13:28] Dean: No? If comments like this make you uncomfortable let me know and I won't make them.
Lisa dances towards their table and towards Castiel. She waves and winks at him before blowing a kiss and dancing to the other side of the stage.
"Why would you hide your Potter knowledge?" Dean looks hurt. "Like why would you hide it from me? Like this? "
"Noooo. You can be both of our friend. I talked him into doing art for living. I can't take you away from him."
"Ok." Dean pulls on the plug again and adds some more lube on it. He rubs his finger through it and then along the rim before he gently pushes the plug back in along with his finger.
'Hmmm. Yeah." Dean says, running his hands over the globes. His hands skim under the shirt and touch the skin of Cas back. "It feels... so nice."
[17.2., 10:31] Gabriel: I don't think he would freak. I think knowing he has said it to you and you still being around and kicking might help him.
[9.3., 13:28] Dean: Hey babe. I poked my head into the studio but you were busy. Don't forget Benny today over arting
"It symbolizes Christ. And God. All the Great deeds God has done for his people are connected to the symbolism of light."
"Yessss. Oh my god thank you. " Dean takes the mug and wraps his hands around it.  "You are the best.  Thank you. "
Dean is in the kitchen making breakfast and writing a list for what they'll need for their party in a few hours. He waiting for Cas to wake up by himself because he is less grumpy when he doesn't get woken up by an alarm.
Dean helps him out the car and closes the door for him. They walk up to the house and Dean stops at the front door.
It's been so long... we've had plans for this. Wanted to flesh out the road trip... but life... I am sorry.
Dean pushes his pants down and holds on to Castiel's waist. His cock slots between Cas' ass cheeks. He slides through the crack and he fucks up into the feeling.
"Good. I am noisy but waiting.... I know I am loud after waiting." He strokes once and shakes. Oh God I am so close already."
"Nah. I think he likes you finally joking along. Careful, he might start getting mouthy with you now just to see."
"Yeah. Getting yelled at together does sound better." He reaches for Cas ' hand. I call her Monday and ask. ok?"
"I am so very glad to be home." Dean smiles. He gently pulls on Castiel's tie. "I like this. You look so sexy in this."
Dean is calm. Too riled up to feel anything besides the need to protect Castiel.  He does hope Donna sent one of the nicer ones.
It's ok. We can have another smaller thing here? Maybe in combination with a graduation thing for Sam and his moving in party?"
After going to bed so early Cas wakes up hellish early, but he's too uneasy to stay in bed. He slips out, grabs his book and goes downstairs. He gets busy making pizza dough then goes for his morning run while the dough sits.
[1.2., 10:10] Gabriel: He is. Thats why I asked him to design my stuff for me. Let me see if he will talk to me.
Dean rests.  His eyes are unfocused but he listens to what's playing on TV and he enjoys the feeling in his mouth.  It's nice that Cas doesn't get horny like Dean does.  This gives him more time to enjoy the soft cock in his mouth.  He gently moves his tongue over it, feeling the skin shift.
Dean looks at Cas and takes a minute to register what he told him to do. After a long few seconds he nods and scrambles up to his knees. "Where and how do you want me?"
"We know John is a scumbag but this... knowing he cheated on her while my mom was pregnant. I can't help but wonder if that's what was the final straw. "
Dean sets up his books and notes at the kitchen table to be close to the coffee maker and starts going through and sorting information.
Sam answers him back and lets him know that he'll try and stay with Jack that night but will need to go home and grab stuff. Dean is chewing on his lip. He can't ditch classes and he can't ditch out of work today. He wants to be with Sam just in case.
Dean lays down in a pile of blankets and wiggles around to get comfortable. 9nce he is happy he grabs Castiel and pulls him on top of him and wraps his arms and legs around him. "Squid hug." He tells him
"Yeah... that's the kind of customer who's car I'd like to be bent over by the way." Dean laughs. "That douchbag smelled homophobic."
Dean smiles sleepily and waits for Cas to join him under the blankets.  Once he has him, Dean wraps himself around Cas and closes his eyes. "
Dean waves. "Hey Gabe.  Seen my dog around? I think she's attached to either my brother or your son?"
Cas is still asleep having drifted off himself. Dean decides to stay snuggled up but moves to a dry spot on his boyfriend's chest. He reaches for the remote and restarts their episode and turns the volume down.
Sweat is running down Dean's face, small droplets glistening in the sunlight streaming into the window. His body shaking with strain. Holding back. He wants to take it slow, take Cas apart.
"But you like me in my pretties and I think you very much like that you are the one that gave me that push to let myself like it."
Dean paces the floor in front of the arrival gates and keeps glancing into the doors every time they open.
"Hi." Dean reaches behind himself and holds Cas cock steady. He sinks slowly onto it and moans loudly. "Fuck you are so big."
Dean has set up a small picnic. He picked up snacks and drinks and brought out his small warm blanket he has in his car for emergencies.
This is the mother of all trigger warnings for mentions of suicide and method of. Dean is talking about his mothers death.
While at Charlie's house, Dean and her are making plans for Castiel's exes. She was able to find a lot of dirt on Arthur and they narrow it down to have the IRS look into him and if that doesn't work they will find something else. They can't decide on what to do to Meg, seeing as she has a child, they don't want to ruin the kids life. After about an hour Dean grabs Santana and heads out.
Dean hums and moans around Cas and gently fucks his finger in and out, making sure to hit the spot everytime.
She nods her head. "But mom and dad said I am not allowed to say anything because I am to young to understand. " she pouts.
Dean shuffles closer to Cas' cock. "Thank you. Can you make sure the alarm is set? I might just fall asleep if you let me."
"Good. I have a few more things. Uhm... you completely undressed... can I put food wherever I want."
"Yeah. But, hear me out.  After all the shit in your life, you're actually starting fresh. Job you love with your art. You've been stupidly successful with that. Loving boyfriend you want to move in with. And possibility to work with your brother, who loves you no matter what and working with bees."
He comes back and hands Dean the dessert and one spoon. "For date you only need one." He says and sends Dean back.
"Yes. Told him he needs to be more mature about sex and use headphones or play music. It's not like we are at each other every hour. He can deal. In exchange I said we wouldn't show up unannounced anymore."
[31.3., 21:38] Dean: Yes. I can't stop thinking about how the cum dripped out of you. I want to feel that
Dean moves his tongue against the vein on Cas cock and swallows around him, pulling everything he learned in the past few weeks from his brain, trying to make Cas come.
Dean snorts. "I see we both like dramatics. Well I like you a lot and I am not breaking up with you."
Garth high fives him and laughs. "I see you tomorrow man. Just like, take it slow tonight or you won't be sitting at all."
Cas cringes. "Oh shit, Dean. I'm so sorry I wasn't there!" Cas clings to him. "I didn't mean to scare you!!!"
"I like ... biting and some pain. I'd like to get more into restraining but Cas isn't really fond of it so oh well. He lets me do other stuff."
Dean smiles. "Last night sucked and not in a fun way. But seeing you sexually frustrated  is interesting."
Dean moans. He kisses down Castiel's body, leaving small bite marks in his way.  He nuzzles Cas lace covered cock and sucks on the small wet spot covering the tip.
Dean shuffles in place and reaches for the lube Cas left on the pillow. He slicks up 3 fingers and reaches behind himself closing his eyes. His mouth falls open and a small moan slips out as he enters himself with one finger.
"I'm not happy with it.  So many loops and the back is terrible.  Let's not even talk about the blood stains. "
Dean helps Castiel downstairs and wraps him up in the blankets he left out the night before. "Stay here. I bring you breakfast."
Dean opens the door and waits to let Castiel pass before he locks it twice and puts the deadbolt on. He checks all his downstairs windows and the back door before he comes back and takes his jacket off.
"Ok." Dean lifts Castiel's head and presses a kiss to his lips. "Then let's finish up so we can get the day started and the boring adulting stuff over with.
Castiel keeps kissing his way lower on Dean's body. He licks his Adam's apple, the dip on his chest, licks and sucks each nipple determined.
"No worries. We always love having you two. Now. Spit out what's up please. You look like you are about to explode by holding back telling me something. Are you pregnant? Is Dean? What's up."
[11.2., 15:09] Castiel: Yes. Unless you'd rather I wasn't. If you need a day to yourself i get out of there before you're home
"I think I am the lucky one here. Got you. The cute dog and a pretty likeable cat." Dean grins and kisses Castiel.
Dean looks hopeful. "Are you done painting? I don't want you to fall behind with Charlie's painting."
Cas is slightly worried about Dean's mood, but he's too frustrated himself, though he wouldn't admit it.
Dean sends him upstairs with an arm full of candles and a lighter. "I'll follow you in a minute. I need to check your kitchen."
Dean grabs Cas' hands and moves them away from the chocolate. He wiggles closer to Cas and pushes them up with his legs just to put Cas down in the middle of their nest. He stays in a plank over Cas and looks at him.
"I don't want you to think that you have to decline everything I offer just because I *need* less sex than you."
[22.1., 09:22] Castiel: I'll tell Missouri my brother forces me to sex and is no better than my exes…
" You didn't do anything wrong. I feel like I went too far. I made a mistake and now I feel like there is this tension here and I don't know why but something is up and it's driving me nuts."
"Ohhh I see you took the shiny and soft requirement for the dress code seriously. I like this." Dean strokes over Cas's negligee.
[23.12., 00:54] Castiel: Well, some of them do. And other real men don't. And other real mean like both
Dean loses himself in Castiel's voice and the sweet tangy flavor of the pie. His brain goes quiet finally and he focuses only on Cas' voice and touch.

[3.12., 21:55] Castiel: If it makes you feel better, i tried on my sisters panties and bras as a kid
[2.12., 19:30] Dean: Idk man. Feels like something one should ask early so this information doesn't come out down the road as like a huge deal, ruining lifes
Cas licks over the spot. He nuzzles around the edge of the lacey fabric, then covers Dean's stomach in soft little kisses.
Cas laughs into the kiss and grabs Deans hands, pinning them over Dean's head to the couch. He now laying on top of Dean in the V oh his legs.
Dean wets his fingers with some saliva and goes back to massaging Cas entrance,  slowly and gently pressing more firmly until the tip of his finger enters. Castiel cries out and bucks hard into Dean's mouth.
[3.12., 13:15] Dean: Real stiffs drink it either black or with so much added flavor that its not even coffee anymore
[20.1., 09:36] Dean: I think for the rest of this semester.  We will see. I just feel sorry for the other students that take more classes and had to rearrange everything.
The pressure makes Dean smile and he looks at Cas. They turn onto Castiel's Road when he raises their clasped hands and presses a kiss to his boyfriends fingers.
"I am gonna disagree with you there Honey." Dean smiles. "Go make food before it gets even colder and I lose you to hypothermia. Dorothy and I will set the table and start drinking."
"I won't be all over you because I don't know mine yet and it is really fucking late. Are yours good?"
"No. You go shower, I'll make you breakfast." Castiel grins. "I missed breakfast with you. This is gonna be awesome."
Cas mirrors him and lays an arm over Dean's back. "I'd really like to feel you, to make love to you."
"He's like a brother to me. I wouldn't touch him and he knows that. Its like you and Cas in a bed together."
" We are getting up earlier. Either you sit in here where you are right now or you join me in the shower tomorrow morning. You can help, you can watch. I don't care. "
Benny and Dean shake hands. "Cas is gonna be very happy about it. You made him uncomfortable enough that you almost lost his business. "
[3.12., 21:39] Dean: http://www.xvideos.com/video29753995/perverted_bisexual_threesomes_riley_nixon_charlotte_sartre_candice_dare
Dean wraps his arms around Cas from behind. "You gonna tell me where Jack's room is so I can wake them up?"
"Listen please. I will text or call you if we are not in the same place and I want to jerk off and you join, listen or suggest shit. I will let you know if I go have to cool down or jerk off when we are together. I will involve you however much you want. Join l, watch... whatever. But you don't get to try and hide how upset you are from me. Please. I want to know what's going on."
Dean sounds small while he's trying to explain himself. His face is bright red and he feels small and powerless.
"I have my first final Friday. Last day of work is tomorrow. Rufus wants me to concentrate on college."
"I wanna go get ice cream. I wanna shove this in Gabriel's face and say see how good Dean is for me? But I don't want to get dressed."
"Fucking away problems instead of talking doesn't work. I just want to make sure this here is happening because we both want to not because you are worried still."
"Mmmmh. I feel like this is way more for me than you. Doesn't seem fair." He says but his relaxed position shows he doesn't mind.
Dean chuckles and lays back. He wiggles his pants down to his knees without dislodging Cas from his lap and kicks them off.
[26.12., 09:48] Dean: I haven't even touched it. But just seeing it turned me on like a teenager finding porn for the first time
Gabriel shrugs. "Angry wasn't an emotion I saw on you. Sad, scared, depressed, rarely happy. But not angry. You stopped showing that."
"Wait , you didn't actually come inside cause I had fallen into my drug coma. It was when you came over to clean my kitchen."
Cas gasps. "Oh shit!" He scratches his neck in frustration. "I haven't had mental health days for ages. Wait, shouldn't you be at work too?"
"Ok... we need to talk this out more. Because I don't like feeling left hanging and I don't want to upset you by asking."
"You're not so bad yourself. " Dean answers and goes from Cas hair down to his neck and caresses the skin there.
[1.2., 10:20] Gabriel:  he mentioned a decision struggle you may be facing. I am offering an open ear.
[2.12., 21:48] Dean: Business administration,  data analytics, financial management and precision systems maintenance
Dean rubs his face. "Babe, I can't look at lace without thinking of you. The feeling of my silky boxers reminds me of your robe. When your face is scratchy I remember how it feels on  the inside of my thighs.  You have been in every fantasy since we started sexting."
[22.1., 12:02] Castiel: Hmmm.... then maybe I'll start by telling you the size and then you decide if you want to know more.
"It's getting late. Let's sleep. I'd rather wake you up with a blowjob than fall asleep riding you." Cas winks.
He reaches behind himself and grabs Cas ass, stopping him from pulling out. "Wait just a bit." He shudders. "We need to get tested.  I want to feel you come inside me."
Dean laughs once he makes it outside. He collects everything in a cooler. "Anything else while I am out here?"
Cas puts the tray on the nightstand  and hands Dean pills and a bottle of water. "Take these please."
Castiel is out of bed the second his alarm goes off and heads down to make coffee and sandwiches. He's done and ready to go by the time Dean comes downstairs, He quickly kisses him goodbye and heads off to work.
Dean runs his hand down Cas back to his ass and pulls him close. "I don't think I'd get a lot done with you naked in bed with me."
[22.12., 21:48] Dean: But if you look out your window, that faint red glow in the distance is my face
"You should stay here, Cas, get some sleep, enjoy his presence. You do love him and want to be with him."
Dean looks at Cas. "Please, please let me explain Angel.  I swear on my mom it is not what it looked like."
Dean thinks. "Your smile. And your brain because you managed to help me with homework so I understood it right away."
Dean wraps his arms around Cas and holds him close. He runs his hands over his back and kisses him deeply.
"No, no chains. No whips. Maybe some spanking... someday. But right now I like following orders I guess. Kneeling, not just for blow jobs, but just because. Often times it doesn't end in sex either. It's just nice."
"We should go home." Dean shudders. "Your bedroom sounds and bedroom questions should stay private."
[27.4., 15:43] Dean: I have no answer.  But I told him to just call the shop and ask for me next time.  And that I'd like to know bee facts.
Dr Mills smiles. "That's not an escalation. Seeking help when you can't do it yourself and acknowledging that you do need outside help is a good thing."
"Let's go pay then. Do you need anything else? I saw some sunflower things that you put water in to feed insects and birds."
Tuesday morning has Dean waking up just as exhausted as he went to bed. He groans and turns his arm off. "I don't want to."
[29.5., 12:21] Charlie: Do says if I want to have a dog I need to know how to take care of them first.
"Dorothy works part time delivering pizza. We could ask her to bring it to the bedroom?" Dean smirks.
"Yes. I am still in shock. I didn't even know he was into guys, let alone Benny or the whole poly thing."
Dean snorts. "No. We are not sleeping with jizz drying in our pants. Come on. Up. Bedroom. Fresh pants or no pants and I spoon you there."
"Jack said it's odd that I don't have something to identify with. But I am pretty happy with just the label as his boyfriend."
"You said it needs kisses. I am just trying to help." Dean smirks. "But at least it doesn't seem to hurt anymore. That's good."
[3.2., 08:59] Benny: Look. I am happy for you. I'm happy for him. But to make him work from your house is a little mad
"But I'm glad you did. I wanted to know and I'm glad I do. I'm not freaked that you like it, I'm only sorry that I might not be able to give you that."
"Then explain please. Cause I am not lieing when I say I can do this, but I have no idea what I am doing here."
Gabriel brings him the glass and sits down next to him. "Ok. Now speak. What about becoming a full time artist scares you?"
"I liked your... forceful way I guess. Knowing Sam could have walked in and you not caring made everything happen pretty fast for me  ... maybe.. maybe next time we talk about it first? But you.. last nights you... I liked that. A lot. Just.. I need you you after something like this. I hate this feeling today."
"You two! Listen! Grip Strength. Lubrication.  Talk to each other about what you like and what works and what doesn't. Jerk off in front of each other in a show and tell kinda way."
"Yeah? Like the point isn't to make you come. You could want to but yeah. It's just what the name says. "
"Thank you." Dean smiles tired and goes to take a quick shower. He starts the water for the tub before he showers so it's ready for them. Thankfully he upgraded his plumbing system the year before so that works out nicely.
He moves his free hand to his hole and starts massaging the pucker while he stares into his boyfriend's eyes.
Dean sinks in his chair and hides his face. "Remember the one I cheated on to break up with instead of manning up? That's her."
[5.1., 11:10] Dean: I always thought my dick size is pretty average.... really big aren't the words anyone ever used to describe it
"You are too tall to sneak through the house. We talk about you coming home late tomorrow." He yells out to Sam.
Dean is knee deep in his project car again. His first restoration car for a customer and he gets to use it for credits at school. He's determined to bring it back to look brand new.
"But... no. You gave me everything. Commands, demands, praise, just the right amount of pain.... and the comment about punishment...." Dean groans. "I love you."
Dean takes her to the back yard and she goes and pees in his flower bed. After some sniffing a cold gust of wind hits her and she runs back inside. Cas chuckles.
[28.12., 18:32] Dean: And then how bad he felt because he thought he needed to offer you something you clearly didn't want
The doorbell rings and Dean goes to pay for the food. He brings the pizza to the table and sets out paper plates and napkins.
The next time he wakes up he is shaking less but everything hurts on his way to the bathroom. He checks his medicine cabinet and finds nothing besides a few band aids. Dejectedly he makes his way back to bed and checks his phone.
Benny and Garth chuckle next to them. "Go sweetheart. I'd love to see that too but you can always flirt with me if you want."
"I am proud of you." Dean kisses Cas neck.  "You must have been so scared yesterday but you didn't let him put you down. You stayed right there and acted like he didn't matter to you. That was amazing."
Dean swings his leg over Cas' body and sits down on the swell of his ass. He takes a deep breath.'stop it. This isn't sexy. ' He tells himself in his mind and pours the oil into his hands to warm up before he spreads it over Cas's shoulders and back.
Dean swallows as much as he can but some ends up dribbling down his chin. He carefully moves his finger out of Cas. He gives the cock in his mouth a last suck and kiss, then let's it fall from his lips.
Dean shakes his head. He wants to see how Cas will react to him refusing the instruction but he is also very keyed up and worries that he will shoot his load to soon.
Dean spreads his legs and pulls his knees closer to himself. He puts his arms back behind his head and watches Cas.
Dean holds his own but looks down, repressing a moan that comes out as a whine, when Cas licks over his fingers.
After Parking Baby and getting back into Cas' car, Dean looks over. "Missouri told me she liked my socks. " He grins. "She told me I should be proud of myself no matter how deep in the closet I think I still am."
Someone vandalised my house, with the boys inside. Sprayed slurs on my door, ripped out plants and broke a window. The boys are fine but scared. They called Donna already. I'll head over there now. Sorry to ditch on market shopping."
"Yesterday, at your session did you have to tell her things about our sexual life? Anything I should know for my session?"
Dean let's the hot water run over him while he leans on Cas. "Thank you. For helping and being here. I am sorry I am sick."
Cas moans softly. Dean whines in the back of his throat and licks into Cas mouth. Panting harshly. Cas opens his mouth a little more for Dean.
Dean grabs Cas hand and puts it up to his face. "You still got some juice here." He says and takes 2 of Cas fingers into his mouth, sucking and licking at the digits.
Dean heads back slowly and sits back down in the grass. Closer then where he had started but still out of the main flight path.
"Yeah. I get that. Let's see. Do you think Gabe would mind if we locked the door? I think I'd feel better if it was locked."
Dean leans over the bed and kisses him gently. "I'll see you later angel. Have a good day doing art."
Dean's eyes are wet and he looks absolutely destroyed. "I always said I wouldn't hit you... now look at me... I am so sorry."
"Wanna go hide from the world for tonight and maybe tomorrow? We could go to the farmers Market Sunday?"
"Most of these pants is ripped anyways. Just slice me out. Maybe uhm... start at the butt and gently slice down? I am not a.
"Maybe. But imagine walking into the shop and finding me bent over a car. And you'd just pull down my pants to find me prepared and you could fuck me right then and there. Fast and hard because anyone could come in and catch us." Dean growls and reaches for Castiel's cock.
Missouri and Dean spend just over one hour talking but at the end Dean does feel better and promises to come in for a prescription to go back on anti anxiety meds.
"Fuck." He mutters as he crawls out of the fort and Dean can hear him running upstairs - after yelling "one minute!" at whomever's at the door -to put on sweat pants and a t shirt then he runs back down and opens the door.
"Oh my god. I... I feel like an idiot." He laughs. "I felt so horrible for wanting that. And even more so for asking you. Thinking you'd hate it."
A few hours later the house is clean and the garden set up. Food is ready and they are sitting on the couch waiting for Ezekiel to arrive.
"Ok that's fair. I've been disappointed by rejection before. More importantly. You stopped. You stopped touching me when I said to. You didn't push or try to convince me to change my mind about the blow job."
Dean showers and puts on a nice pair of panties. He wraps the kitchen apron around himself and opens the fridge. It's not as bad  as he expected and he has it cleaned out quickly.
"If a scene helps. I like submitting because it takes me out of the responsibility. Do you think dominating would help you? Feeling in control... having power over whatever happens?"
Dean shakes his head. "You didn't say anything. Please. I need you to tell me stuff like this. We could have had cuddly, slow sex. I was very much in a mindset that wanted nothing more than to please you with whatever you wanted."
"Yeah... yeah, that would be good. Charlie, I'm so sorry you got dragged in this. Dorothy must be worried!"
Castiel licks Dean's length from the base to the top teasingly slow and with just the tip of his tongue.
"Come on dude, everything is OK. Now you know for next time. Don't be so harsh on yourself. " Dean hugs him with one arm. "How about some mindless TV?"
Back home they take care to feed the animals and scrounge up leftovers for themself.  Settled at the table they eat dinner. "What's on your mind Babe? You look like you are thinking very hard." Deans wonders.
Castiel spends a long time on his shoulders and loosens up each side with slow, even motions, kneading the muscles until Dean is pliant
They sit across from each other while they eat and Dean keeps glancing at Castiel, trying to be subtle. Castiel smiles softly whenever he catches Dean's glance.
"Gentlemen, follow me please." Mike, according to his name tag, says. "Mr. Novak did not specify a vehicle so we got to choose within the insurance price range." He stops in front of a lime green VW Beetle.
"I just spent several hours either thinking you don't want me anymore or freaking out that I could have broken this myself by thinking with my dick. Maybe I just want to hold you."
[31.3., 22:38] Dean: Shit. I am so messy. Everything is wet, babe. Did you come? Did you think of filling me up and come?
"Looks like it. But they took Santana. Not sure if they did to have company or to have a reason not to help out as much." Dean grins
"I'd like to see your face but there is nothing waiting in the office that I can't handle. I let you know if we need you?"
Dean nods and gets out of the car. He waits for Cas to catch up to him and they walk inside together.
Dean leans back against the pillows and takes his cup. "Cuddle up and choose something to watch please."
" It's usually just Sam and me making sure John either doesn't drink to much or keeping him out of the house after its too late."
They do make him sing the entire song and at the end his shirt is covered in drool and melted peanut butter. Dean attempts to kiss Cas but gets shot down immediately.
Together they fill the dishwasher and Cas turns it on. Dean drags him to the bedroom and closes the door behind them so Lucifer doesn't come strolling in. He walks up to Castiel and plays with the hem of his shirt. "Can I take this off?"
Dean snuggles up to Cas and whispers in his ear. "It also means we can keep making out in bed and it stays pg13."
He slowly opens the door to the bedroom and walks inside. The door to the bathroom is not closed all the way and he can hear castiel in the shower.
"Hmmm you and Frank are on good terms. Ask him if they want to order with us? We can sound proof the studio and bedroom and he, you know, do his bedroom."
Dean helps Castiel stand up and calls in to work. Garth tells him to take the day off as not much is going on and they'll survive without him.
They head up to the bedroom and get ready for bed. Both knowing they won't get up later to brush their teeth.
"Hey. How are you feeling? Good enough to go plants shopping? Fair warning, you are gonna have to keep them alive. I don't do well with plants."
Dean only half focuses on classes and avoids Charlie all day as she looks concerned and like she wants to talk to him. He just wants to go back home and sleep. Work is boring but all stuff he can do while his brain is running in circles.

"I promise I'll do better. And I...  we can ... we've never watched any Harry Potter together, Dean."
He pulls Cas closer. "Have I given you any indication that I expect more from you? Oh my god. Do you feel pressured by me into doing stuff you don't want to?"
Dean follows him down the stairs and while Cas feeds their pets, he makes coffee for the both of them.
Dean smiles and grabs the belt loops of Cas pants and pulls him closer before leaning forward and kissing him.
Dean presses a kiss to Cas's soapy shoulder and makes a face. "Yuck... I should have rinsed you first."
"I started on the slide show. I finish it tomorrow. I can add you to it so you can look it over?  I don't think my brain can function anymore."
"Take your hat please. " Dean says and waits for Cas before he grabs his hand and leads him to the car.
Dean feeds Cas the last bit of banana and sets the plate aside. "Pets are fed. Gabriel left a note. He took Santana outside with him . Lucy is sitting in the kitchen window staring down birds. What do you wanna do? Should we put the couch back together or you wanna stay in the nest for longer?"
"Think you can focus on drawing?" Dean asks as he sinks to his knees and kisses Castiel's stomach on his way down. He runs his hands up and down his legs and plays with the waistband. "Can I?"
Castiel takes a piece of salmon and lets it fall apart on his tongue, getting the most of its taste. "Mmmmh, it's good. The fish has just the right texture. A little heavy on the herbs, but you can still taste the fish itself good enough. Well done, Babe."
Dean is so deep in his studies, he doesn't notice how time goes by and suddenly it's almost 11am. He needs to be in class in 15 minutes. Hastily he packs up his stuff and runs out as quietly as possible.  He has to make his way across campus and arrives just in time.
They kiss gently at first, gradually becoming more and more passionate.  Castiel ends up on top of Dean sucking a mark into Dean's neck to match the one Dean gave him not 10 minutes ago.
Castiel chuckles and tries harder to push the pants down. Dean wiggles his hips to help along but he loses his balance and topples forward. He tries to catch himself but goes down like a log. On his way down they hear a rip.
[7.12., 22:08] Castiel: I really understand your worrying, i do understand that it is a lot to process. Believe me. I do understand. And I... I am very sorry i went all bitchy on you and didn't talk to you.
"I... the enthusiasm and how quickly you agreed. Do you have anything you want to do involving me and the car ?"
Dean has been watching Castiel walking through the house practically giddy.  Selling his first artwork puts a smile on Castiel's face like he hasn't seen before.
"Awesome." Dean whispers to himself and starts slowly dragging the pants down. " ohhh. Green. So pretty babe."
Cas puts his hands on Dean's hips and pulks him close. "No... you're way too gorgeous for what I've brought you." He muses. "You should go get your shower. And if you allow me, I'd like to take care of this." He traces the outline of Dean’s dick.
" I love tacos but they are messy as hell to eat." Dean says while he swipes some stray salsa from Cas' face.
Dean snuggles closer. "I will do my very best not to complain. But I need you to know, I like the reminders every time I sit down. It's like reliving the moment."
"Probably. I just don't want to. You're warm and smell good. " Dean nibbles on Castiel's ear." You taste good too."
Castiel jumps, too surprised to hear Dean's voice. "Uh, yeah. We won't be too long. You'll get bbq and fireworks, no worries."
"Sure, Sweetheart." Castiel smiles. "Now go inside and make us tea while I go look at what you should wear for the night."
Deans body locks up tight and he bites into Castiel's shoulder instead of screaming out his orgasm. His hips move against Castiel and his hands are gripping his back.
"Uhm. I am happy. I can't wait for Cas to move in. My house is a bit bigger than his so there is plenty of space. I am trying to have places for him to use just for himself. I usually ask if I can be in the studio with him because it's his you know. I dont think it's gonna turn sour and I'd never hurt you."
He crawls into the nest to Castiel. "I still have no idea what's actually happening tomorrow. So it will still be a surprise."
They rearrange the furniture in the living room, creating quite a lot of space right near the large windows. Cas brings out some sheer curtains that block people from looking inside but let almost all the daylight in. Some shelves get put into the bedroom and basement for now.
[27.1., 22:14] Dean: Ok. I'll make a list tomorrow and we can go over it?  I'd like to get sam supplies as well to keep in his room
He sneaks out of the bed and after a quick trip to the bathroom, he heads to the kitchen for coffee. Figuring it would be better to wake Castiel up with a cup in hand.
Car loaded up with enough food for the week and a few alcoholic drinks for new years eve, they stop for a late lunch at the diner on their way home.
Adam turns up a few minutes later. Dean greets him and then leaves. He hands Sam more money for food for the both of them and a cab home later.
Better late then never huh? Not gonna lie. Trying to sum up days isn't going as smoothly. Too much stuff we want to include that was and is important to us.
Cas swears and hits the wheel frustrated. All his good mood from waking up with Dean, getting coffee and breakfast, seeping frim him as his car sputters and doesn't start.
"Yeah, what he said." Cas nods. "You didn't give me a home. You may have given me a roof and a bed, but ... even living with Uncle Zach had been more of a home than living with you."
Cas watches Dean, fingers carding through his hair and he hopes with all his heart that Dean will sleep peaceful.
"Hungry? Top one is yours. I'm on the bottom. Feel free to start eating while i put the groceries away."
Dean sneaks up behind him and wraps his arms around him. "I can't wait to show you how not boring the bedroom is." He whispers in Cas ear and nips it.
Dean looks down sheepishly. " I have an appointment with Missouri today. I'll go to my classes and then go see her."
"I didn't go grocery shopping. Cas has been painting all day and is at the garage now and we are hungry. "
Dr. Mills sits back and watches them. "Mr. Novak. Why are you moving away from Mr. Winchester after he confesses something this personal?"
"He's a good kid. And I am so glad he didn't misunderstand my intentions. That would've sucked. Nothing worse than being kicked out by your own family."
Dean takes Castiel's hand and slots their fingers together. "A similar reason for your aversion to jizz on faces I guess. Cause you seem to like it just fine on other parts."
" I am worried. Angel I am scared shitless that I'll touch you and you coil back. I am scared that something I do will trigger something and I lose you.
"Have a year to myself and work. I've been in school for so long, and while I like school, I'd like to have a break before I commit to college."
"But i wanted to taste myself there." Castiel apologizes as he feeds his cock into Dean's mouth and moves his hips again.
"So?" Dean asks and plays with the waistband of the panties and kisses Cas dick through the panties.
[31.3., 20:00] Dean: What should I have for dinner? Santana is having chicken. At least that's what the picture claims.
Donna is staying late at work, now that there is some more to go off so it's just the 3 men and Claire. She takes the news Ok but does get misty eyed. After some hugs and promises of her being allowed to dog sit, that clears up quickly.
Dean runs his hand up and down Castiel's chest. "You meant to spend the rest of the day making out? Or did you just want to tempt me with your neck?"
Cas is deep asleep, having expected to be on their way home. Dean hopes he isn't angry with him. But he has plans.
"I've been in bed with you almost a week. Not all of my dreams where nonsense and you are naked on top of me. Needy... I told you."
He gets into his car and drives. Without noticing, he ends up at Gabriel's house and stares at the building. Trying to either talk himself out of going in or hyping himself up. He's not sure.
[8.12., 21:00] Castiel: Is there anything I can help with without you having to share company secrets?
They stayed silent while finishing their food and once the waiter moves the empty plates and they are left alone again, Dean speaks up."When is your birthday?"
"Maybe one day I can. But I need to learn to trust too. Right now the thought hits too close to home and bad memories. Things I wouldn't want others to endure."
Dean stops  pacing and looks at Cas. "Left out?  Ok. I can work with that." He grabs his phone and sets his alarm for 30 min earlier and does the same to Castiel's.
[2.12., 19:26] Castiel: If I was married with kids, would I spend Friday night alone with my Lucifer?
"US happy and relaxed. Babe. Us. Not just me." Dean smiles and grabs his hand. "Let's go get food and maybe you even stay awake now for me to have someone to talk to. We are just a few hours away from Zurich. "
He slips out to start the coffee maker and for a quick stop in the bathroom to freshen up. When he is done, he grabs 2 cups of coffee and sneaks back into the bedroom. Cas' coffee he puts on his nightstand and his own on his side.
Dean follows Cas outside and grabs the flowers from the car and hands them to him. "This might be your date but I will forever be the guy that gets you flowers."
"No, Dean. ... Dean! It can't only be you who accepts his partner's needs. I gotta accept your needs too, Babe!"
Finally Dean gives up. He throws himself onto the bed, looking up at the ceiling. "Ok. No more please. That last one almost gave me a cramp."
"Yes, sweet boy." Castiel smiles and kisses Dean's ass, then bites it gently. He kneels up and positions behind Dean. He takes the lube and uses it generously.
Halfway through the movie Dean grabs Cas hand on his bulge.  "Stop. Timeout."he moans and a shiver goes through his body.
"Shhhh! Shut that kind of talk right now. You're an amazing man. You do so very much for everyone. You make great meals and I'm looking forward to eating red pancakes."
"Ok. I think we are having two different conversations here. I will be staying home in the morning to study as attendance isn't mandatory. Anatomy was  the wrong word because my mind was in the gutter when I looked at you all sweaty and happy covered with charcoal dust."
Dean frowns. " If you are still not at normal temperature today, you shouldn't be going to work Babe."
Dean grabs the dog and sneaks out of bed. "You need to go out baby?" He whispers and closes the bedroom door behind him.
Dean climbs onto the couch on his knees. He rests his arms on top of the back. He feels exposed and nervous and his dick makes it known. His erection has gone down but his balls are still tight. He wants this. Has imagined this happening several times but he didn't think it would happen tonight.
Dean takes a shuddering breath and kneels on the carpet in front of castiel. He looks nervous. "I need to say a few things and I need you to let me finish before you say anything else."
[7.1., 12:33] Castiel: I know that right now, I'm happy to have you just jerk off. I can even see myself watching you doing so.
When Dean comes back he stands behind the couch and puts his hands on Cas's shoulders. "Wanna go lay down together for a little bit?"
Gabe carefully looks up. "Oh hey. Way less skin than I imagined I'd walk into. Here. I brought ice cream."
Dean shakes his head. "You don't have to. I... I don't want you to do it just for me. If that wasn't the plan, then it's not the plan"
"He's very protective. He saves me. I'm not saying he's sweeping me off my feet and carrying me out of burning buildings, but he's there, he's giving me strength by his presence."
It only takes them a few hours and all cars to haul Castiel's stuff to Dean's place and unpack there.
"Photographs. Of us. In the bedroom." Cas is putting their pets in their carrier boxes, phone on speaker mode
Castiel stares when Dean goes down on his knee. His breathing becomes faster, nervous, panicky. But he listens to Dean, doesn't interrupt him. And the more he listens to Dean, the more he calms down and instead feels his eyes fill with tears.
"Oh my god. You giggled. That's amazing. I have to find more ways to get that sound out of you." Dean laughs."Hey, are you ticklish? "
Dean shivers at Cas tone of voice and moans.  He wiggles further down the bed until he has his head resting on the pillows. He grabs Cas hips and pulls him forward. Dean sticks out his tongue and licks over the wet tip, tasting Castiel.
"Neither are you. I am pretty sure that's team work." Dean grins. "But we are both willing to work on this so I am sure we can do it."
"Can ... can I come Cas! Sir please!" Dean is begging. His balls are drawn tight to his body and he feels like he is about to explode.
Dean nods. "That's why it's Important to normalize it. Just imagine how not awkward you'd feel if it was as normal as going to the dentist."
Dean sighs. "Cas. If you tell me now that you don't want to have sex ever again, I wouldn't leave you or kick you out. You tell me no more blow jobs and that's fine... anything really. Just tell me what you guys talked about that made you so upset please. I love you and I want to make sure that look never comes across your few again." Dean reaches for Castiel's hand.
"Looks like we got an audience." Dean points out and gives the cat some scratches when he is close enough.
A few minutes later, right before Dean gives up and walks back to his table, the door opens again and Lisa comes out.
"Oh, Sweetheart, you are most definitely appreciated. Much more than that. You're such a caring person."
"So what do you want to do? What are we gonna do?" Dean stirs his soup. "My first reaction is to change the therapist to be honest."
"Angel?" He asks through the door before opening it. "How much more gay does it make me if I say I like the make up?"
"I love that you're taking care of me. You're so good at it. And i love that you care, that you're willing to commit yourself to the torture of romcoms and regency novels. You're by far the best person in my life apart from my siblings."
[5.12., 19:37] Castiel: It hurts, I will admit that. I was ready to forget about last night. But you opened the wound.
"Shit. Hold still please. I don't want to hurt you." Dean pants and fucks Cas face rubbing his cheeks with his thumbs.
Cas calls to order them all burgers. "What are we doing til they arrive? Anyone have math homework?" Cas grins.
Deans phone ringing is what wakes them up in the morning. Dean groans and blindly reaches for it on the nightstand.
Dean looks over. "Yeah. As long as you are not being a dick to him. " He takes Castiel's hand. "Was that the only thing that bothered you?"
Dean cleans up everything he can find but keeps the last bit of cum in his mouth and moves up to kiss Castiel.
"Remember how Gabriel greeted you Monday? At least in your dream world you weren't as freaked out by it as you were then."
Gabe shakes his head. "Put him up in the guestroom. You guys are here with 2 cars just stay the night."
"I know you don't like it. Let me enjoy the prickly side of having a boyfriend. It felt amazing on my skin this morning."
Castiel gets up. "Yes. I think I'll swing by anyway, I feel bad for accepting the job and then just not coming anymore because of some stupid fever."
Dean throws on some shorts and a clean shirt and heads out to lunch. He is the first to arrive and waits for Cas and Ezekiel outside.
[4.12., 10:33] Castiel: I don't care what you read there about me. But if Dean doesn't want you to read it, then don't. For him
"And what came up that made you look like I killed lucifer?" Dean steps closer and stops. "Cas... there.... there are bees.  I... I am in front of a hive... what do I do?" He whispers panicked.
"Of course. He'll love that. I'm sorry, I didn't know his friends were gonna be here. Sorry they made you nervous."
[12.2., 12:19] Dean: But this being a small town, they won't get that fixed until some time next week. Which means no leaving the house till work for me
Dean wakes slowly to something warm on his chest. Castiel has rolled over at some point in the night and is laying across his chest. His breath puffs onto Dean.
They hear scrambling coming from upstairs and soon after Jack's comes down, bright red face and out of breath.
Dean kisses him quickly and sends him off to work. "Go. I'll play house spouse and finish cleaning and make dinner."
Dean steps closer. "Stay like this?" He runs his hands up Cas legs and kisses his way down from the bottom of Cas spine to his cheeks.
How should I put it? I had an interesting phone call last night." She looks at Dean. "You have dangerous, helpful friends."
"Shit. I still need to clean it too. I just left. Fuck. I think I stained my fluffy rug" Dean says looking sad.
[17.2., 18:06] Castiel: Charlie, i feel so bad for this, but I'm talking to dreaming Dean and it is hilarious 🙈
"You want to fuck me babe? Look how desperate I am in the video for you. I just came and I just keep going, I am gonna come again. listen how much I want you." Dean growls into Cas ear.
Dean grabs plates from the cupboards and adds the food. He carries them over to the table and hands one to Cas.  "Let me grab silverware."
"Me too. I... I don't want you to feel like a guest.  This is your house too. So get comfortable please."
[3.2., 07:41] Castiel: I will need an actual workspace now, not just the kitchen table when I feel like it…
Dean changes the topic and starts the car back up heading towards their motel for the next 2 days. "I'll need a few hours of sleep and then we can see if there is anything else here besides that thing." He nods towards the eiffel tower'
"Make sure my hands are free and I can tap your hip? And I almost came from blowing you, I didn't need much. " Dean blushes darker. " as was obvious by me coming on your ass."
Dean stares after Cas as he leaves the room. He gets up from the couch, wraps the blanket around him and follows his boyfriend into the bedroom.
"Oh yes. Oh you're beautiful, my boy. So beautiful." Cas praises. He runs his hand up the back of Dean’s thighs, over the perfect globes of his ass and up his hips and waist to his chest. "Yes, so beautiful."
The corners of Cas' mouth quirk up. "Oooooh! That sounds amazing. But you didn't have to ban them. I liked us all being together in the house."
Frank comes back and hands them a business card. "Here. I got this from one of our regulars at the club. Queer friendly construction company. Maybe they can help you guys."
"Where are you running? And yes you can. Oh, and Donna might have a therapist for us. I'm gonna google her and let you know."
"I'm still hoping she doesn't recognise me. So I'd prefer not to." Dean whispers and Benny laughs. "Brother, she just waved at me. I am pretty sure you are busted. The looks she's throwing you are not friendly. I think she may still be mad."
"Its not you. I'm just bitchy. I am sorry. Thank you for not wanting to wake me up and still making sure I don't wake up alone. It's very sweet."
They prepare enough pancakes to carry them through the day and enough coffee to last for a while, so they settle back in their nest with those and some bottles of water, so they wouldn't live on coffee alone.
Dean blushes. He finally opens his eyes and looks right at Cas dick. He snorts."This can't have been comfortable for sleeping." He points at the waistband. "But I am impressed that you can have your cock in my mouth and not get hard. I think I'd get hard before I am even in your mouth."
Dean walks around the front and grabs his hand. Together they join Donna.  She instructs Sam to stay in the car and walks up the pathway to the front door. Cas squeezes Dean's hand.
Dean watches Sam go to the front with Jack and looks over to Cas. "You don't have to stay back here with me."
"Can I grab your ass? That's it. I want to hold on to your ass. It was so tempting to touch when I gave you the massage and oh god I just want to feel you move."
"Yes! Oh god yes!" Dean lets himself fall forward. His shoulders and head on a pillow and his ass high up turned towards Cas. " Please! "
Dean is kneeling next to the easle, eyes downward. His head perks up barely visible when he hears castiel enter.
Gabriel gets into Michael's face. "No, I gave him a home and treated him like the family he is. You kicked him to the curb like a puppy that didn't follow your commands. You are sick Michael. Our parents would be ashamed to see what you have turned into. It's disgusting.'
Sunday is spent having a lazy breakfast picnic in Castiel's back yard, dressed warmly and wrapped in blankets until the sun warms up some more.
"Oh! Oh no. Not My Girl!" Gabe gasps." Do you know how much kleenex we used between Cassy, An and me when we watched that one! Bad throwback, Dean, bad throwback."
They spend 1hour talking designs and to Cas shame, googling what cars Benny wants to have drawn. They agree to 3 poster size prints drawn in colored pencil and watercolors for 120 each.
He's done everything wrong. Everything. Starting with ever asking Dean to come to church with him. And then he reacted poorly, sourly like a pouty child when Dean bid him good night.
"What the fuck du you mean, Dean? I seriously don't understand. You feel that last night was a mistake? What have I done wrong? Was it too early for me to touch you? What have I done to you? What? Please tell me so I can not make the same mistake ."
"Nice to meet you, Dean." She says then offers her hand to Cas. "And you must be Castiel. Zeke has talked a lot about you lately."
[3.12., 10:52] Dean: One i had to get up in the middle of the night just to get kidnapped to a farmers market 65miles away just so my brother, formerly known as straight,  can go buy honey from the cute guy he has been seeing around on his market trips. Then it turns out that said boy is actually related to the man I have been messaging because the hot brunette apparently thought I was not good enough.
"Both. I don't care. I can chill here for a week and do nothing or go somewhere. As long as there's you."
"Okay, yes." Castiel smiles and steps out of the shower. He wraps himself in a towel and hands one to Dean.
Dean kneels down in front of Cas. "Angel... I am feeling terrible and I want to feel useful. I... I like doing things for you. Doing things you want me to. Not just sex wise. So please, please tell me at least if hot or cold. "
"Stop it. Stop getting down on yourself. You've never had to deal with being told no. You had no idea how it would feel. It's ok. You did the right thing and stopped. That's all that matters." Dean whispers into Castiel's skin and finishes it up with sucking a small bruise behind Cas' ear.
Castiel is washing up dishes. He had been thinking about just making himself a sandwich and let Dean take care of himself. But no matter how annoyed he was lately about barely seeing him, he still loved Dean more than anything or anyone really, so he did cook a full dinner, hoping against all hope that they'd have dinner together again for once. He'd given up texting Dean during the day a few days ago, so he hadn't even noticed it had stayed turned off.
[3.2., 09:51] Benny: How are you feeling? I mean, you were definitely happy, when I saw you last, but apart from that? I've never seen you do anything remotely relationship-y and now look at you thinking about halfway moving him in…
"Oh you are sexy... very sexy. And you turn me on but it's not your fault like in a bad way. I will get horny because of you but that doesn't mean you are at fault. God that's so hard to explain."
"Oh god. Yes, tomorrow is Friday. I swear. I am so glad this is all over for now. I was losing my mind."
Friday starts similarly to Thursday with Cas sneaking out and Dean sleeping in till he has to go to work. Garth helps him decide on an outfit for church the next day and they talk about what Dean could make for dinner since fish is a broad spectrum.
