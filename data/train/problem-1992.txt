lemme know if anyone is interested in a third chapter at the hospital, with actual dialogue from john lmao.
He had appeared at the end of the aisle as John was debating over wholemeal or white bread. He was in the same red shirt, Belstaff, and scarf as he had been at the crime scene only two days earlier. As soon as John spotted Sherlock, Sherlock started walking - prowling - towards him, and John almost wanted to flinch back, to get away from the fake Sherlock his mind had conjured up, but there was another person in the aisle with him, and he didn’t want to scare her away by flinching away from nothing, so instead he just turned back to the bread. Wholemeal was more expensive, but it was supposed to be healthier.
a (more than one) man for him, and another filled with domestic moments, reading with his head on Sherlock’s lap as he solves cold cases, typing up an old case as Sherlock plays a gentle tune on his violin, snipping about how
The words were clearly an invitation to try his hand at some of Sherlock’s deducing skills, and that was much easier than thinking about what Sherlock was doing there, slipping so seamlessly back into John’s life without creating a single ripple, if the ignorance of the people around him was any indication, so John turned his eyes to the crime scene, and began muttering what Sherlock would have proudly proclaimed. “No sign of forced entry on the door, yet there are no witnesses - this was done either before opening time or after closing time by someone the victim knew, further proved by the fact that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the forehead: he would have had time to look at his attacker, even fight them, but there’s no signs of a stuggle-” John bent down, stared intensely at the man’s nails. “-and no skin under his fingertips. He’s not been here long - ice from what he was holding hasn’t melted - so it was before opening time, and-”
Sentiment was a funny thing. Right now, though, it was overwhelming, all negative, all bad, all fear and anger and worry and-
He let Sherlock go after only a second, shoving him back down with a, “Shit, I’m sorry, I should have-”
Sherlock didn’t expect it to be unlocked, and he was right. The door stubbornly stayed shut. Lestrade had taken all of Sherlock’s duplicates in his last drugs bust (unfortunately - perhaps this experience would convince the DI to allow him at least one. In case of emergencies, of course), so it was with little regret that Sherlock hefted his hammer (taken casually from Mrs. Hudson’s rather sizeable cupboard of tools), walked over to the passenger’s side (it wouldn’t do to have to waste time cleaning out glass cuts from Lestrade, which he would only do for Lestrade’s help and not because of any
In any case, because John isn’t predictable, it’s hard to figure out what exactly John would consider romantic. Sherlock had once read that scattering rose petals on the bed would be both romantic and seductive, but John had grumbled at the sight and immediately had started to clean it up before Sherlock had revealed his intentions. On the other hand, John was very pleased when Sherlock had applied his knowledge of chemicals to food and had cooked them dinner, even without the candles.
It takes a few seconds for John to catch up with the change back to the everyday living topic, his mind set on a cuppa after Mike explained their joint destination. “Yeah, like that’s gonna happen.” He barely manages to contain the scoff from his statement, but there is a bit more good humor in it than had been there previously.
He thought about the layout of the flat, his chair and Sherlock’s, one worn and yet comfortable, with the sleeker one of larger dimensions across from it. Sherlock had already moved in when John arrived, but now he considered that Sherlock had possibly hoped so much that he would take the lodging, that’d set up the ideal chairs, the plaid throw for John’s aching leg, the pillow with its flag of England for the man that had served his country.
When their eyes met, John thought he might go down through the very floor, for his vision had a whole galaxy stirring in his irises, the colors never quieting to just a basic one or two. The bowed-mouth had started to curve a little at the corners, but then the eyes suddenly opened more widely, and the vision darted off into the back room where the decorations were being stored.
“Oh, yes.” No distance at all for the shop keeper, gathering the bowl to then hand to John, and waiting until the doctor had it fitted near his hip before he offered him the glass of scotch. Once John had the glass in hand, he did notice that Sherlock took a moment to stare at the bowl, almost wrenching the focus of a defeat-filled pair of kaleidoscope eyes from that circle to the credits going across the screen. John didn’t say anything about it, but it wasn’t hard for him to imagine Sherlock there instead, nestled against John’s side, and readying for further enlightenment on the things the doctor enjoyed. Plain enough that was what had been tracking through Sherlock’s mind, but he’d see how the viewing went before considering it further.
From the stone edifice outside with the lions rampant, to the paneled alcoves and grand staircase they had all passed to access an unlikely elevator, John could tell the residence was no simple home. Paintings hung on the wall, some of the portraits in gilt frames dating back to possibly the seventeenth-century, an occasional shape of face or unusual eye color leaving no doubt the home belonged to the Holmes family. Ornamental carvings and everything highly polished, he didn’t contemplate the amount of staff it would take to keep the place in working order, because he was too intent on watching the medical staff that went into full action once they entered the suite for Sherlock.
“This isn’t Hitchcock, in fact it’s a lot more recent than his films, but I think you might like figuring out the plot on this one. I’ll refrain from showing you the back of the DVD box, so you can make your own deductions.” Those creases were along his eyes again, and he was picking up one of the camo throws to toss over his feet, which he stretched out onto the coffee table. “Hand me the bowl, and a glass of the scotch?” No embarrassment for either of them this way, because he was comfortable, and Sherlock could do something for him–which seemed to be the young man’s primary interest.
The decision to search the internet for information about Sherlock had already led John to the shop’s website, where John quickly read through the About page, which really did turn out to be more about the shop than the owner. In fact, the owner’s first name wasn’t even listed, leaving John to wonder if Sherlock just really wanted his privacy or it belonged to someone else. To John at least, there seemed to be an incongruity with Sherlock’s appearance, his obvious intelligence, and working in a shop. His instincts told him there was a story to it all, and until he’d been shot at least, his instincts had generally served him well.
have to do with math, it is hard to equivocate his intelligent to even a goldfish, because even a goldfish can do more than open its mouth and eyes dumbly when confronted with even a modicum of intelligence.
she’s the fastest out of all of them, this will just help her prove it. The wind flies through her mousy brown hair, the stands falling out of her ponytail and she races to the end. She’s almost there, she can see the end of the road come closer and closer-
He had dismissed the thought immediately, only for Moriarty to confirm it when Sherlock checked his mobile, Lestrade reading over (around) his shoulder.
Sherlock’s jaw snapped shut with an audible click. The flat stayed silent up until John left the flat, something he was in equal parts hateful and thankful for.
, so when Sebastian decides to torment Sherlock, there is little he can do against Sebastion and the rest of his blank-eyed lackeys.
“Sherlock, the ambulance!” Lestrade called from behind him, and Sherlock resisted the urge to snap back that, yes, he could
“Yes, John,” Mr. Holmes says, and his tone and the look in his eyes is suddenly very different. He looks just as fond as Doctor Watson did on the day he patched James up. He’s smiling more openly now, and it looks a lot happier than it did a couple seconds ago. Angie likes this face more than Mr. Holmes’s usual face, the scary one. “It is his birthday tomorrow, and I have heard that giving flowers to your loved ones is romantic, so I have been getting him flowers all this week, because I am not sure which ones he will like, so, in order to get more data, I have given him one of each flower each day, so I can get him a big bouquet of his favourite on his birthday.”
His first prediction is already coming true, as Sebastian reaches his hand forward, fingers already curling around his bicep in an attempt to keep him still, when a, “Hey!” comes from down the hall.
“What?” Sherlock snapped, after a moment of silence (he didn’t like all the new, odd feelings that came with John being hurt and Sherlock being useless and John about to die when John needed to live or else Sherlock would have to go back to the way things were and Sherlock didn’t
Speaking of harsh words - Angie gasps along with all of her friends at the word ‘prat’. “You shouldn’t say that word, mister,” she says. Her mother has always told her to not use that word, along with many other words. They were rude.
Angie kinda wants a lolly, but she definitely isn’t going to ask for one. Doctor Watson picks up on it anyway, and pulls three more out of his box. “You’re welcome - do you want one too?”
Sherlock debated not telling him what it was, but eventually he would need the Yard (not their help, but their resources) to help find John. “It’s John’s,” he said stiffly, watching as Lestrade’s eye widened.
Sherlock tried to make himself move back, but strangely enough, his body, which he was usually in complete and total control of, refused to cooperate. Instead of letting go of the scarves and backing away enough to let the paramedics haul John onto a stretcher, he stayed kneeling over John, hands still pressing desperately into his stomach, eyes locked onto his eyelids, where Sherlock could see his eyes moving wildly (and his mouth, moving silently and saying nothing, but Sherlock could tell that the word John was mouthing over and over was
“From Mr. Poppon’s, yes,” and then, anticipating John’s next question, “one of the young girls down the street gave them to me after speaking to me the day before. She was scared of me, along with her friends, before, and were making a conscious effort to avoid me. However, after speaking to me for exactly four minutes and 23 seconds, they changed their minds. Children are curious creatures.”
any mistakes about carbon monoxide, fire, and murder in general are mine even though I did do some research into this one.
John had left to go out for drinks with Lestrade (at approximately 9:42pm - it was currently 12:00am. John probably wouldn’t be back for another 30 to 55 minutes, depending on how nice it was outside).
“Yeah, detectives are so cool! I didn’t know Mister Holmes was a detective!” James says, much louder than Safaa. James is usually much louder than everyone else.
Sherlock didn’t wait for him to complete his sentence before this time yanking John back down to meet his lips. Later, John would probably be mad and upset and
“-Sherlock?” John said quietly, loud enough for Sherlock to hear but not loud enough for anyone else to hear - why wasn’t anyone else seeing Sherlock, anyway? The doctor side of him was screaming something at him, but he couldn’t muster up enough energy to care when Sherlock was right there, in front of him.
Sherlock didn’t know how long he stood, staring at his hands, but the angle of the light had shifted when someone spoke, taking Sherlock’s attention away from the now-dried blood on his hands. “Sherlock,” and it was Lestrade again, who was no longer with the man (who had seemingly left, now that the police had arrived, without his scarf, which he would check in on John for, although Sherlock couldn’t be sure whether or not it was really for John or whether it was just for the scarf without having spoken to the man).
John watched as Sherlock seemed to fade away the further and further he got from John, and as he walked out of the building, he disappeared completely, wisps of smoke flying away no matter how hard John tried to grasp on, try to keep his Sherlock with him, alive and well. But he wasn’t alive, and he wasn’t well, and the Sherlock he had seen, well-
(John couldn’t die, not when Sherlock needed him, if only to have someone to speak to during crime scenes instead of a skull. There was an odd tightness in his chest and an odd buzz in the back of his mind Sherlock identified as fear and worry but were of secondary importance when it came to John, bleeding out in front of him and staining Sherlock’s hands red even through the scarves.)
“Sherlock!” Lestrade said, looking at him, concerned (quick glance at the time, 00:13 - he had been staring at the jumper for upwards of two minutes - sloppy, sloppy). “You okay, mate? You-”
but it really doesn’t seem that way. The years since he met Sherlock have passed in a blur. Sometimes it feels as if he has lived two separate lives, one filled with adrenaline rushes and gunfire, running towards danger and watching crimson decorate the edges of his vision, worrying for and about Sherlock,
“Doctor Watson,” Angie says quietly to James, who looked confused. James nods, saying back much louder, “The doctor who helped me?”
“Quite,” Sherlock drawls, giving John a smirk of his own, then heading to the kitchen to do what is usually John’s job. “Tea?”
“Hey, freak!” Sherlock rolls his eyes and keeps walking - after the first three times Sebastian had used the same nickname, it had lost its already minimal sting. “You, freak!”
Doctor Watson wipes both of his knees with the cloth quickly, and James is sniffling again at the end of it, but he hasn’t broken into tears. “There, sorry about that. We have to make sure nothing bad gets into your cut, just in case.” Then out of his box comes two big bandages, big enough that they’ll probably cover the entire cut! They each have one big smiley face in the center. Doctor Watson sticks them onto each knee, and then stands up with another smile, reaching into his black box
(except they’re not really hearts, because hearts don’t look like that. Sherlock had tried to explain this to the two girls opposite Sherlock and John at the table, Larissa and Ally, as Ally drew a heart, clearly for her mum on her birthday. He had even shown them a picture from his book, but this had only frightened them, and John had told him to put the book away before they got in trouble). It’s for some holiday called
It’s not James, it’s Mr. Holmes. He stares at her for a couple seconds, and Angie stares back. She had been trying to hold her breath earlier, but couldn’t do it for more than a couple seconds at a time. Now, however, she’s doing it effortlessly, as though if she stays still enough, Mr. Holmes won’t see her. It’s painfully obvious that he does, however, and his blue eyes are scarier than the black that he usually wears, staring into hers as if he can read her mind. He probably can, and she tries not to think about how scary she thinks he is, but ends up only thinking about it more.
He looks stunned, staring at the flowers in confusion for a couple moments. Angie starts to feel that she has done something wrong, and is about to pull the flowers back and apologize, when Mr. Holmes reaches out to take the flowers from her hands. “Oh,” he says, and then again, “oh. Thank you. John’s expressions over the past week did indicate that he would prefer multiple flowers to only one. I have not yet tested colour scheme, but he does like it when I wear a purple shirt, so this will be excellent. Thank you very much.”
Sherlock jumped out of the cab before it even came to a complete stop, throwing money at the cabbie without checking the bill number, racing to where he knew Lestrade left his car every day without fail. Sure enough, the car was still there. Sherlock tried to peer in the windows as he ran closer and closer, but the tint proved too much for even his eyes, and so instead he only ran faster, grabbing the handle and yanking.
“I am - and I have,” Sherlock had murmured after a split second. “Moriarty is losing his touch. This is obvious, too obvious. We will have John back in only a few more hours, if that.” Before Lestrade could even ask what was so obvious about the little information they had been given, Sherlock had already whipped out his phone, sent Moriarty the answer.
The mediocre Indian place he sometimes stopped by on his way to and from the clinic was surrounded by yellow tape, and, curious and a bit worried for the nice man, barely out of his teens, that always greeted him at the front by name, John ducked under the yellow tape. He nodded at the officers around the perimeter that he recognized - and that recognized him and let him pass without complaint, thankfully - and made his way through the sea of people to get inside.
He was picked up outside the clinic by a taxi, then taken to a warehouse on Whitechapel and was dumped on Kent and Albany moments ago. -MH
It was easy to give into his mind’s longing for having Sherlock back. It was easy to pretend that it really was Sherlock sitting across from him as he read the paper, easy to pretend it was Sherlock running his mouth as he made tea, easy to pretend that Sherlock had never really left at all. It was much easier to pretend than to try to fight his mind.
It’s very obvious that Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson like each other very much. Also, Doctor Watson makes Mr. Holmes look not as mean, which Angie appreciates. Why is Mr. Holmes wanting to give Doctor Watson flowers so bad? Flowers always make her mum and dad happy.
intelligent than Sebastian Wilkes. Sherlock knows he is doing better than the rest of the school in math (obvious, he doesn’t need to take a peek at his report card to know that despite what Sebastian thinks) but when it comes to anything that
Fake-Sherlock kept talking and asking and just being there, and wouldn’t go away, and it grated on John’s nerves and his sanity more and more until-
Angie stands up and moves back to go stand with the rest of her friends behind who she now knows is Doctor Watson, and watches as he pulls out a small white packet, ripping off the top and pulling out a white cloth-looking-thing. It smells like a doctor’s office.
Unfortunately, Sherlock (and John, of course) seems to be the only one that realizes that Sebastian has not yet evolved from
There was only one person that always showed up as Unknown Number, but he had been dead for years now, ever since he had shot himself moments before Sherlock had jumped. He didn’t want to believe it, but when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. And if Sherlock had faked his death, didn’t it make sense that Moriarty must have done the same? (Sherlock would be the first to admit that he admired the man’s intellect - he hated the man himself, ever since their first meeting (he liked to think that their first meeting, the day he started to hate the man, and the day he had threatened John had coincided as a coincidence, and not that he hated the man
“I don’t know if you can hear me. I don’t know if they can, for that matter, but it doesn’t matter what they hear. I love you. I think you know that. I…I hope you know that. Maybe you don’t. Maybe I’ve been too caught up in my own misery, and haven’t looked after you as I should have, but…Well, that’s going to change. If you want it to. If you don’t want Victor or well…” He honestly didn’t know how to end that part of his thoughts, didn’t think being grim would accomplish anything at all, but not knowing what to say instead. So, he squeezed the long pale fingers clasped in his own, brushed his lips against the knuckles, and pressed his eyes shut to temporarily block out the sight in front of them. “Pull through…for me. Just, please.” Whispered, this much, and he waited.
“Here we are.” Mike isn’t answering him, but John reroutes, wondering at the identity of this other person, and scanning the outside window display. A neon pink sign reads: The Study. The odd discrepancy between the formal name and the design of the sign, throw John for bit of a loop, and he hastily runs his eyes along the rest before noticing there isn’t anything else to see. Streamlined, and after a delay out on the pavement where John vacillates about going in, he follows Mike.
“You must be Dr. Watson. Please…come in. I’ve been doing some baking, and I’ll be right up with some muffins and tea, but Sherlock is already upstairs.” She’d said this all in a flurry, with hardly a breath taken, and drawn to one side so John could come through into the entryway. True to her words, there was flour on her hands, and she didn’t offer either of them to shake with John.
Not resigned, but knowing it would come to nothing right now, he turned away from the glass. The reflection just caught the swirl of something, and he saw him. It was the upsweep of curls off the crown of his head, a light breeze defying the heat, though a pool of sweat gathering at the gape threatened to plaster down the ones closest to his skin. John’s mouth watered.
Gauging what next to do, because the shop floor was carpeted beyond where he was currently laid out, John edged backward. Careful of the underside of the counter, so he didn’t slam his head into the hinged surface, he sat back into the quiet space with the counter to his back. There was sweat pooling under the collar of his coat, but he hadn’t felt this alive in months, if one didn’t take into consideration when he was with Sherlock. Denim-colored eyes turned, ran their line of sight down the length of the rest of the counter, because if he could manage it, that counter would take him all the way to the wall and within just a few feet of Sherlock. Too big a risk, and Sherlock still wouldn’t be able to see him from where he was standing. New plan…
“Sherlock, please, Dr. Watson.” Sherlock was still dressed in one of his immaculate suits, his hair tamed by product, but only just. The curls were moving slightly as he shifted backward, having come up in front of John in an almost crowding manner. His face made a series of expression changes too fast for John to read, but then he spun about and extended his hands outward to encompass the living room area of the flat. “So, this is…it.” He didn’t stop there though, and in what seemed to John like an anxious way, Sherlock gestured toward a worn-in damask chair of red, which sat across from a streamlined one of black leather and chrome. “I thought…that is…” There was a pillow with the British flag on it, which he lifted off the chair, his arms rounding over the opposite side of it as he pressed the pillow close to his chest.
The popcorn had been substantially depleted by the time they’d gotten halfway through the movie, but John wasn’t about to ask Sherlock to make more or otherwise upset their nest. He’d moved the bowl onto the floor near his feet, done the same with his empty glass, and remained steadfast as Sherlock would leap up in exasperation, falter, then collapse like a marionette with each change in the plot line.
Something in his chest pulled, and he laid his hand across the place of spasm. The trouble was, John wanted to say, "Trevor, be damned," but the other blonde had been kind and supportive as far as John could tell. It was an awkward situation at best, and at worst, tearing him inside. He'd have to accept that if Sherlock wanted to remain with Trevor, then John would need a new place to live, and he'd have to recover a second time in a beige bedsit. In some ways, the wound this time would be more horrible than the war injury had been. What phantom pain would crop up this time, where no actual physical injury could be seen? Would he bother allowing a healing time or just take matters into his own hands, as he’d come close to doing several times before meeting Sherlock?
Miserable, Sherlock threw his phone at the chair by his wardrobe, then tossed himself into the pillows and throws littering his bed. They smelled of John, and he began raking them around his head and shoulders, desperate for just that small comfort. His knees were pulling up, his feet brushing against one another, and for the second time he found himself sobbing into his bed over the doctor he was unlikely to have.
Sherlock had done it himself, from memory. It was just lines and shading, but had it possessed the sandy blonde hair and dark blues eyes of the actual individual, it could scarcely be more important to the creator. His young man, as Mrs. Hudson had called him. Wearing his smart uniform from his time serving Nelson, and all the medals from his time in service to the crown. Sherlock had been twelve when he drew it, had met the man only a few times, but the soldier had never been forgotten. Five years.
In this, John let him, “I have some Bonds films, a few horror movies, some Hitchcock, things like that. Do you like horror movies?” Wasn’t sure Sherlock would go in for that sort of thing, but the younger man nodded a little.
Two days had become three, one of the other doctors out on maternity leave. John will still living in the bedsit, and out of plastic bags with plastic cutlery. Day by day, things were becoming less and less solid to him. Boring blurs, all of it.
Sherlock had been looking down by this time, and the groan almost made every circuit in his brain shut down. He had his own fork in hand, which wavered none too steadily, his tongue wetting his lips as he picked at his food to distract himself more than to get anything actually on the tines. “I hope…you like it.”
“Of course, different things…work on different people, but…yes.” Sherlock still wasn’t making eye contact, but he wasn’t leaving John’s side either, and it took the doctor standing up and turning off the television for the mood to lift.
Trying the back door, he found it unlocked, and his hand was already circling the gun to gently draw it out of the pocket. A thumb flipped the safety off, and he didn’t extend his arm all the way as he pushed the door open just enough to gain access to the stockroom. Letting his eyes adjust to the dim interior, he didn’t move further inside, and he was listening.
John was floored now, eyes widely opened, and quickly glancing between the two men in front of him. Mycroft and Trevor, a couple. Not Sherlock and Trevor. There had never been a Sherlock and Trevor. There would never be a Sherlock and Trevor.
It was a strange answer, and John almost said something about the thumbs comment, but the sudden shift in Sherlock’s manner drew an adjustment from John. He’d been on a battlefield with men similar in age to Sherlock, young men trying to come across as braver than they were, guarding their faltering dignity as much as any station where they had been assigned. A situation of two men in shared territory, but it didn’t matter that he’d not been the first one there to stake a claim. If he was correct, he’d have an entirely different stake to claim anyway. “Right, well. As long as I don’t have to worry about fingernails in my fry up, we should be fine.” He smiled, making sure it was pleasant and his posture was still easy, but there was a definite bit of steel in his eyes.
It’s only then that Mike quits his perusal of the goods in front of him, but it’s to Sherlock that he looks, and addresses his comment. “Old buddy of mine, John Watson.” There’s that pleasant smile on his face, but he continues with the shopping part of this expedition. “I’d like to see the rest. Not sure if this isn’t a bit too modern for Milly.”
Righting himself in the bed, he gave a glance over his bedraggled clothing, the usual perfect lines all creased and beyond correction from just his hands alone. Quietly, oh so quietly, he went through his clothing, pulling out a pair of dark purple pants, the softest t-shirt he owned because he was fond of the color being cadet blue, striped pajamas bottoms to add to the illusion of more height, and his darker blue dressing gown. He changed quickly, then made progress just as quietly into the living room, padding lightly on his bare feet.
Seeing this, John sat back down, but maintained hold of Sherlock's hand. Still being direct, he looked again to Mycroft and Trevor. "He needs rest, and you can explain to me later how these two ended up being shot by two Americans in a tea shop of all places." He didn't say it, but the Get Out was more or less implied, and he nodded toward the door in case his tone of voice somehow wasn't enough.
The bedroom had been given full-length windows, running wall to wall, the frames painted light grey against the darker paper of Prussian blue. Only one had been allowed to go without the windows, and that contained a double mirror flanked by walls papered in a light dove, the mirror on a track that meant it could slide over, revealing the bulletin surface behind it. An option for placing notes such as how the darker cobalt of John’s eyes had hints of grey and even brown threaded through, a combination Sherlock had never seen in anyone else. As well, there was a space for how the light from the windows in the main room had picked up all the different colors in John’s hair, too many for even Sherlock to count. It would necessitate further study, though as he rolled his forehead against the sheets, his mind stuttered on the one notable feature missing from the bedroom space–an actual bed. Curling even more tightly in on himself, the sheets went from cool to damp, a few tears leaking out of the corner of the young man’s eyes no matter how much he was trying to stop them. “There won’t be one. There just…it was stupid, stupid, stupid.”
“I’m here. I know you probably can’t hear me, but I’m here, and…Christ, Sherlock…Don’t you go out on me, not like this. There is so much…I have to tell you, and I know there is something someone isn’t saying, but don’t think about that right now. I want you to…fuck…No, I mean I want you to wake up, because we need to talk. About this. About us. About Victor.” It was all coming out in a spew, and had he cared right then, John might have been more self conscious about airing all this in front of the two that were working on Sherlock. But, he didn’t care. At least, not about them.
“I’mnotstoppingyou.” Sherlock said it so fast, the words just snowballed onto one another, and he turned just a bit more toward John. That he was also stripping off his glove, impossible to miss.
John’s are very different, the cobalt threaded with a darker grey shifting restlessly, and his throat constricts. “I got shot.” It’s a balmy afternoon, not hot in the least, but his thin plaid shirt and medium weight jacket both suddenly feel like too much. There’s a rolling back of his shoulders, tightening them.
“Correct. But, it’s not as simple as all that.” The ending had been somewhat ambiguous, pieces that the dying young man should not have been able to see, but were nonetheless present in the narrative. Pieces that had slipped through his consciousness from what the people surrounding him in last moments, had been able to process. Sherlock was silent when the movie drew to a close.
Night had fallen outside, and since the kitchen light had been likewise shut off before the movie, only the light from the television was there to illuminate the features of his fairer companion. The colors running through his eyes were so absorbing to John, that the doctor only barely paid attention to the middle of the movie, and by the end Sherlock had managed to pop up and down so many times that his throws, pillows, and he were all much closer to John’s end of the sofa, than they had been at the beginning. The credits were rolling before the normally very observant Sherlock noticed his new proximity to the doctor, resulting in his hastily gathering his objects of softness, and edging backward to the opposite side.
“So, I have to ask…smiley face and there…are those bullet holes in the wall, Sherlock?” John had a piece of buttered bread halfway to his mouth, hand suspended in time, as he changed perspective from the wall to Sherlock.
The front section of the shop is composed of tables covered in linen and understated damask cloths, matching napkins with silver, gold, and wooden rings set at each of the four stations. There isn’t a doily or slip of lace to be found. John realizes the tables are set at even intervals, giving the clientele enough room to move about, but still maintain a look of subdued sophistication. Each table has its own special set of china and tea ware, but the sets are unlike anything he’s seen before.
John moved out of the bedsit on the 30th. Officially, he’d decided well before that, but he didn’t want to leave the landlord in a lurch.
John wasn’t at all sure he understood the situation, but after only a short pause, he was working his way up the seventeen stairs to the open door of the flat in question. “Mr. Holmes?” Wrap of knuckles to let Sherlock know he was there, and he heard the sound of bare feet on the hardwood, Sherlock appearing from around the corner to his left.
“How did he go from being in an aquarium in one frame, to being outside their apartment in the next one, but still underwater?”
“To ensure that I am carrying on the legacy! Yes, I know.” Sherlock was taking rapid breaths, so angry that his face was blotching, a very marked difference than its normal shade of milky white that half the mommas and daughters in the county envied him for possessing. The pheromones in the air were getting to him, but he wanted – no needed- to continue. His future happiness depended upon it.
His head was starting to hurt, but the tears were still collecting on his cheeks, and he hauled himself up onto the window seat to look down at the fountain that was coursing over in the courtyard below. The Eros statue that composed the central piece was as erect as ever, gathering moss at an atrocious rate, now that the estate was down to just two men to tend the grounds.
Turning around to where Mike is, John is cut short by the owner’s appearance, and that voice. Somewhere around six feet in height, and probably not much over twenty, the man behind the counter is nothing like John would have expected. His tailored black suit and blush-colored shirt say custom, but he isn’t wearing a tie or cufflinks, and there is somehow an effortless effect about it. The fingers that carefully set out the first of Mike’s choices are slim and elegant, obviously manicured. With the set down on the counter, his hands remain aloft, wrists turned in an outward gesture, and his fingertips partially bent as if he is about to change the position of the wares in front of him. The right hand lifts toward his lips, which John realizes consist of a ridiculously defined cupid’s bow at the top, and rounded fullness at the bottom. His hair is a maintained halo of dusky black curls, slightly too long for fashion, but in combination with his creamy complexion gives him the appearance of a classic statue. The young man’s eyes slant, and whereas John initially thinks they are also grey, he takes an unconscious step or two forward and sees that they’re in fact practically opalescent, caught in a shift from grey to green to blue and flecked here and there with amber. Set above the most sculpted cheekbones John can imagine ever seeing, the dense lashes around them flicker, offsetting the lightness of their irises behind him. Focus darting John’s direction now, the tap of a fingertip against that bottom lip ends quickly, the man’s head tilting to the side as he regards John.
“I’m sorry?” John isn’t a stupid man, but his brain hasn’t had time to catch up with what is going on, and he noticeably checks Mike for explanation or introduction before turning his eyes back to the shop owner.
“Do you...That is, we’re home...and I...” Sherlock took the cup and the bell, but didn’t seem to know what to do with either of them. Leaning forward, past John, he looked questioningly toward the doctor. John nodded, not sure what was going on precisely, and Sherlock set both of them down. “Sir, can we be...us? I mean, can...” He huffed, not knowing what to say or how to get the words out.
“I heard you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at. What happened?” Behind the lenses of his tortoiseshell glasses, Mike’s eyes are still a placid blue, reflecting the calmness of a man that is content with his lot in life.
“Yes, my dog bit him, but he hasn’t held it against me.” He jostled Sherlock with a press of his knuckles to the slighter man’s upper arm, then carried on with equal energy. “Turns out we’re both in chemistry, so we’ve been running around ever since.” He twisted about then, arm circling the other young man’s shoulder, tugging Sherlock toward him. “Anyway, we’re late…Come on, ‘Lock. If we don’t leave in the next five minutes, we’ll miss the opening.” Popping up to his feet then, he nodded to John. “A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Watson.” He waved lightly, then pointed down the stairs. “I’ll catch a cab, ‘Lock.” Off he ran, not waiting to catch whatever John or Sherlock said, the door downstairs heard slamming in a way that left a strained silence in its wake.
“Hello, there. Dozed off, did I?” He still sounded drowsy, but he was smiling well enough, and then studying Sherlock’s expression like one might read a beloved book. He could tell the younger man didn’t quite know what to say yet, as he only received a tentative nod in response, so he filled in the blanks for Sherlock. “Guess my bones do need a better surface, if I’m to get up tomorrow, and find that job.”
“Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.” John’s eyes were surveying the room, the various layers of clutter and boxes, and he looked into the kitchen briefly. A microscope on the table, more clutter, more boxes, but it had all the amenities his kitchenette did not have. Focus shifting to the chair when Sherlock pulled the pillow out of it, he quickly assessed it, then lifted his eyes to Sherlock’s. “This could be very nice. Very nice indeed.” Clearly, Sherlock was ill at ease, and not sure how to go further with the conversation. Making sure his eyes were portraying the same warmth that was spreading itself through his chest, John smiled reassuringly to the younger man, then seated himself in the older piece of furniture. “Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out … Oh.”
“Not a word.” Mike murmurs at first, delivers a quick appraisal to the two others, then taps the Eden pattern to give the owner his decision on the available sets that he’s seen thus far. “Anything more?”
“First of all, breathe Sherlock. You’re doing fine, and the meal was amazing.” The creases that formed near John’s indigo-colored eyes might have done more to cause the relaxing of Sherlock’s than the words, but time would tell. He certainly had no intentions of racing off, and not learning all he could about his remarkable young man.
Checking his phone to see if he’d somehow missed a text from the shop keeper, despite knowing he hadn’t since he’d checked it half a minute before, he started going through his texts and touched on the number for Wendy. Ringing on the other end, and he wasn’t even really sure what all he said by way of explanation, but here he was now dressed for a date he’d cancelled. Trying Sherlock’s number, it didn’t even ring. Went to voicemail, which had not been set up, so he texted him one more time.
“You know that’s not true. You know it. Fix this…” Sherlock pressed his eyes tightly shut, almost choking on what came out of his mouth after, but he had to get his brother to understand. “You know this is different. Please…please, Mycroft. I need him to know. I need…him.” John wasn’t just a diversion, wasn’t just a lark.
“I cancelled. I don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong, but it just seems like something isn’t right. Sherlock always replies.” Forcing his fingers straight, John sat down in his chair, where they just resumed that curling on the arm.
“Christ.” Giving up on sleep, he limped the few steps to the desk, and took his laptop off the top of the stack boxed to his side. Sitting down, he booted it up, and stared at the blog that was basically an empty slate in front of him. Just a smattering of entries, him noting that nothing ever happened to him, a comment from military buddy Bill, two from his own his sister, Harry, and one from his therapist to ask why he missed an appointment. His fingers curled and flexed over the keyboard, and although nothing immediately sprang to mind as correct for making accessible to the public, he did input a short entry so he could say he’d done it.
He did see Sherlock veer out from his bedroom, rather than the bathroom, on his return. No explanation, but he had a wariness in his eyes that said he was well aware John had seen, and that there might be something requested. Nestling back onto his pile with his bum, scooting and getting where and how he wanted to be, Sherlock’s knees pulled up toward his chest, one after the other. The whole time, he kept his eyes on John, even when he dragged his second throw up over his shoulders high enough that he was just hair and eyes.
It is imperative you respond at once, regardless of your feelings towards me currently, to confirm your safety. -SH
“Well-” John struggles to find the words. “Yeah, but like, you get to make sure they know. Or tell people that. Don’t know. You know?”
It wasn’t formatted as a file for a case normally was - instead it, there were only three lines typed in a neat font Sherlock could probably identify on the spot, on blank paper Sherlock probably knew the brand of, inside a manilla folder Sherlock could probably trace back to a specific store. It seemed to be more of a short story blurb than anything, but the name of the victim combined with the “case” was anything but entertaining.
He didn’t answer, and instead he turned to Sherlock, eyes questioning, searching for an explanation, but found none. Sherlock, instead, stood up, saying, “Good, John, but not good enough. I can tell you what you missed, which was almost everything, while we go find the killer. Come along!”
Sherlock was acutely aware of the chill stinging at his cheeks as he burst out of the police car, not bothering to close the door or wait for the DI as scanned the area, located John (and the person lying next to him: not the person who took him, is using his scarf to stem the wound, middle-class businessman trying to get home to his heavily pregnant wife, called the police immediately and just hung up) and ran over to him, pushing the startled man, who had just opened his mouth to no doubt asks some inane question, to the side.
Ada surveys the kids and the bikes, still splayed out on the road where they had stopped (Angie, now that James isn’t hurt anymore, sees that her bike is clearly in front of all the others - she would have won) and starts, “I think-”

He is also somewhat comforted by the fact that very rarely do high school relationships last (although that is immediately nulled by knowing that John is bound to settle down with someone eventually, if not his high school sweetheart, then another women that Sherlock will have to share John with).
This was what he had been trying to tell himself, that the reason no one but him had reacted to Sherlock was because he really was the only one who could
A bouquet he had been gifted by a young girl that had been scared of him only the day before. Children were curious like that, he supposed. They were more tolerable than adults, anyway, who were so very concerned about social niceties and the
“But- with what?” Lestrade said, haltingly, probably surprised by Sherlock’s complete 180 in actions and emotions.
Usually, Sherlock finds it mind-numbingly easy to ignore what everyone else is doing, even/especially his mum and dad, like when he refused to dress up for Halloween (until John came over, excited, and persuaded Sherlock that trick or treating would be fun), or when he found the Easter egg hunts to be too easy and sat up in his room (until John came up to his room, and Sherlock found that dazzling him with instantly finding the hiding locations to be suitable entertainment), or even something as mundane as using an umbrella when it’s raining (unless John is walking with him, because then he starts to shiver and it’s
James rings the doorbell, and they wait for the footsteps and the door to open, like they have been hearing for the past hour or so. Nothing happens. James rings the doorbell again, and they wait another couple seconds, before Safaa turns back around, the least patient of the bunch. “There’s no one home,” she sighs.
way to do things. Chidlren might have a much lower intellect, but they were much more bearable to be around. And this particular one had given him a gift, something he was much more used to after years of knowing John, but still always managed to surprise him (only a little bit, though, because he was Sherlock Holmes, and almost nothing surprised him). It was sentiment, most likely, but of what kind he couldn’t tell.
Clearly, Mr. Holmes is not her mum, because he does answer. “Because he thinks that women should not marry women and men should not marry men.”
, instead only seeming to make him more determined to have John’s attention. John wondered wryly why his mind hated him, why it was so determined to rub in John’s face that Sherlock was gone and was never coming back. “Did you figure it out?” fake-Sherlock asked from somewhere above his shoulder.
When she gets home that day, it’s to a bright bouquet of flowers, and she thinks of Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson again. They should be able to get flowers, too. So she asks her mum if she can give Mr. Holmes the flowers tomorrow, and explains what Mr. Holmes told her. At first, her mum wears the predictable pinched face, but then it smooths out into a smile. “Of course,” she says. “I’ll bring you tomorrow.”
Doctor Watson coughs awkwardly. “Ah, yes, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t.” Mrs. Adelaide tuts, but for some reason, she is smiling.
James doesn’t understand immediately like Angie does, however. “Husband? But then . . . who’s the wife?”
“Don’t point, honey,” her mum says first, and so Angie drops her arm obediently. Only then do her mother’s eyes stray to the two men, and she smiles as she watches the two of them walk. “Doctor Watson and Mr. Holmes? Yes, they’re married.”
“Shoot himself, yes, but he’s still alive, as am I. Don’t look so surprised, Lestrade, it’s not a good look on you, only Ander-” and again, Sherlock cursed Moriarty for being such a
Sherlock's fingers had tightened noticeably against the mobile before suddenly relaxing as he locked it and thrust it into his coat pocket. “Move,” he snapped at Lestrade, no different than any other case, and Lestrade, knowing that getting insulted would only take up more valuable time (which seemed to be a lot more valuable, now that they were apparently on the clock) and energy, moved to the side. Sherlock bent down to peer inside the car, before calling over his shoulder, “Open all the doors. Check inside the car for anything out of the ordinary. This is my first clue, and since you offered no help, there must be something in here that wasn’t there before.”
, and he could practically say Sherlock’s next words with him. “The intelligence and dignity of Scotland Yard decrease exponentially every day. This case is mind-numbingly clear - to anyone that has a mind, of course. Can’t you see, John? What happened?”
Sherlock doesn’t know. It still doesn’t make sense, but most things everyone else does don’t. What is making even less sense is that John seems more embarrassed than usual. He’s stammering more than usual, too. This isn’t his John, but Sherlock doesn’t get a chance to ask (or deduce, like his annoying, unfortunately smarter big brother always tells him to do), because the teacher tells them it’s time to leave at that moment, and John, who clearly still hasn’t finished his heart, says, “Oh no!” as he hurriedly cleans up and carefully puts his heart away.
Sherlock's voice was dim and scratchy, but John heard him without a problem, and his lips went from tightly thinned to turning into a glowing smile. The lines about his eyes didn't diminish, but the look of anger, fear, and determination became one of simply determination laced with utmost affection. "There we are then. We'll go back home when you're well, and be together. We can sort out the how and whats then, but I want you to rest, and recover." Inflection was everything, and John had his most direct voice in play now, not missing the slight enlarging of Sherlock's pupils as he heard it.
John saw the wince for what it was, though the doctor was not sure why it had happened exactly. He let Sherlock go about the final actions to prep for the meal, then slid his arms apart to go toward the younger man. His gait wasn’t totally steady, but there were creases near his eyes as they warmly looked up at Sherlock, John taking one of his hands to lead him away from the stove. Sherlock was obviously puzzled, and the hand he still had made a fluttering gesture at the food. “But, it will get cold…and the kettle…” Now, he did look at John, but didn’t have more than a moment or two before a sturdy arm was around his waist, and he was being danced slowly backward from the kitchen. “I…oh.” His kaleidoscope eyes were changing colors, widening, the pupils also dilating.
Trevor outright grinned, but did wait until Mycroft had cleared his throat, and accepted the course change for what it was. "Very well. I've had the room next door made up for your use Dr. Watson, and will send for whatever belongings you wish to have for the next few days. Sherlock is likely in no danger now, but the doctor on my staff would like to keep him here at least until Friday to make certain." He started to turn away, drawing Trevor along behind him, but looked back toward John before the doctor could do anything else. "Welcome to the family, John."
The owner of the shop doesn’t bother with the other items, balancing the saucer with its matching cup on the very tips of his fingers, and lightly conveying the set back to the unseen room where he keeps his stock. Mike doesn’t attempt to strike up anymore conversation with John, who is now shifting from side to side, trying to keep his physical and mental balance on par with one another–and not having much luck with either.
Mycroft was just about to start up once more, when Sherlock reached to save his precious book with a look of apologetic horror, and then rose to race past him to the door that led to the hallway. It slammed behind the younger man, and his older brother lifted the letter he had received only that morning. “If you had only let me explain…” Shaking his head, Mycroft circled back behind his desk, and sat down on the slightly cracked leather, lifting his quill to sketch out his reply.
“My…My…let him be. He’s…he loves him. Tell him. Your fault. All…tell him.” Victor got this much out, before fear, exhaustion, and blood loss sent him under. He was on a stretcher and being wheeled out as the team pulled John off from his tending Sherlock, and the army doctor strained to get to his feet, leveling a quite direct expression at Mycroft.
In the back of his mind, John knew Mycroft must have been in a second ambulance with Victor, but he was concentrating on the curly-haired body in front of him, whispering encouraging things while simultaneously trying not to be in the way of the staff as they provided oxygen and checked Sherlock’s information in some database John would wonder about later before starting an IV of fluids and pain medication.
“I don’t know what you normally do after eating dinner, when you eat dinner…” He kept his tone light, and he noticed a heightened shift in Sherlock’s alertness that told him he was on the right track. “…but I usually read or watch some crap telly. Still, I have some films on DVD, if you’d be interested in some popcorn, and making an evening of it.”
“Why do you want flowers so bad, Mister?” James says, at the same time Angie asks, “Why not? Mr. Poppon likes everyone.”
“I do,” Sherlock said, glaring at Lestrade pointedly, hoping he’d get the point (Lestrade was of above-average intelligence, which of course meant that he was still an idiot, but he was . . . bearable).
She looks disappointed, as do James and Safaa, and Angie herself. Pirates are cooler than detectives in her opinion, but detectives are cool too, and she’d like to hear some detective stories. Maybe when they come back, she consoles herself, but until then, there’s more candy to be had.
It looks like Mr. Holmes is done with talking to them, though, because he stands up and says, “I think today I will try lilies. Good-bye.”
His hands immediately went to work at the fabric on Lestrade’s face. “What did you see?” Sherlock said (resisted the urge to ask if he was okay: what would that do? He had no physical injuries, and it was likely not in the top ten most traumatic things that had happened to the DI).
Angie runs towards the flowerbed, making sure to hide on the opposite end of where Mr. Holmes is. The flowers are very tall, and if everyone thinks Mr. Holmes really is all that mean, they probably won’t check near him - it’s a perfect hiding spot, as long as Mr. Holmes doesn’t come any closer. She hears James hit
John, finally, made a sound, but instead of any words, it was just a brief cry of pain as Sherlock pressed even harder on the wound (Sherlock felt the strange urge to apologize, but John wouldn’t hear it, or understand it, so why-?)
“John!” she says, voice annoyingly high-pitched as she lays a kiss on John’s lips. John laughs into her lips and deepens the kiss, but only for a second, before pulling back and smiling at her.
Despite what his head said, though, John knew that that was Sherlock, had seen this same picture so many times with so many different bodies, Sherlock’s exact stance burned into his mind, and knew that
Exactly 23 seconds later (Sherlock hated to be wrong, but every second counted when it contributed to John Watson’s life) the ambulance pulled up and the men and women inside burst out, only one stopping to speak to Lestrade while the rest immediately ran to John, as they should.
Unfortunately, before he knew it, the day was over and evening was near, and it was time to head back to the flat and face Sherlock, who would surely continue to try and persuade John that he was real, that he was back and there to stay. Maybe he should turn in early, he mused, walking up the seventeen steps. It was hours before he usually headed upstairs, but if it meant he didn’t have to hear what he
“Uh- hello,” James squeaks. Angie can see past James to where Safaa and Ada are hanging back, Ada looking nervous and Safaa laughing at James’s misfortune. “Sorry, we won’t disturb you anymore!”
Sherlock had mentioned what was going on - Sherlock and Moriarty (who had survived? He shouldn’t have been as surprised as he was, given that Sherlock had survived as well, but surely shooting yourself in the head was harder to fake) were playing a
Sure enough, when Sherlock turns around, John is glaring at the group of figures around him. He isn’t a very intimidating figure, considering he hasn’t grown nearly as much as Sherlock has, and is left at an unfortunate 1.7 meters. What is intimidating is his glare, promising fierce retribution to the one who dares lay a finger on Sherlock, and after what had happened last time, everyone knows that John can and will follow through on that threat, no matter how much trouble he ends up in afterwards.
Safaa is the bravest out of all of them, and stands up to say, “James fell off his bike and hurt his knees!”
Normal, comfortable, and completely fake. But if he stopped to think about it, it would burn, burn him from the inside out, so he didn’t stop, didn’t think about it. He had a piece of Sherlock back, and that was enough.
John collapses back on the couch where he had been seated, picks his book up again and chuckles when Sherlock’s head returns to his lap, bumping against John’s hand like a cat asking to be pet. That is, of course, what Sherlock is asking for, so he uses the hand not holding the book to run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, curls that have managed to stay inky black even as John’s own hair grays. Sherlock hums, pleased, and closes his eyes.
It sounds terribly mundane when he puts it on paper. But it will not be mundane, because he will be with John, and John is the opposite is mundane. There really are no words to describe John. He is still as much of a marvel as he was ten years ago.
“First clue?” Lestrade had read the text, knew that this was all a game to Moriarty, but even Sherlock seemed to be accepting this as a scavenger hunt, a series of puzzles with John as the prize. Lestrade had known that Sherlock liked to play murder - how many times had he heard him cry “the game is on!” before dramatically bursting out of a crime scene, bloody Belstaff fluttering behind him? - but even now, with John’s life on the line, he was treating this just like any other case?
Sherlock doesn’t bother responding, as his next words should be more than enough explanation for his mood. He holds out the bouquet (a beautiful thing, with all types of flowers but mainly lillies, with all sorts of colours, but mainly purple) and smiles. “Happy birthday, John.”
Sherlock had never done that before, but there was a first time for everything, he thought. “Sherlock?”
He had finally fallen back on flowers, something he had been hesitant to use ever since the rose petal debacle, since it wasn’t clear on whether or not John had disliked the petals, or if he just wasn’t a fan of flowers in general. He had been very receptive to the singular flower Sherlock had been offering him for the past week, however, so Sherlock wasn’t all too concerned about the bouquet he now held in his hands.
“First F in chemistry. Needed someone to take it out on,” Sherlock says, likewise not pretending that he doesn’t know.
scary,” Safaa disagrees, but Angie can see why people say that. His dark coat and scarf make him look very tall, and he almost never smiles, making him look very scary. Angie wonders how John met him, since they seem to be so very different.
They aren’t particularly interesting by themselves - one is rather short, blond, and is always wearing some sort of jumper. His cozy look fits in perfectly with the rest of the town, and he usually flashes her a kind smile whenever he catches her looking at him. The other is very tall, and his hair is dark and curly. He doesn’t smile when he’s by himself, and he looks kinda mean - but together, they are. They look at each other like her mum and dad look at each other, like they love each other. The tall one even smiles when they’re together.
“Yes, Moriarty has John,” Sherlock said, moving on Lestrade’s hands. It was a metal chain that seemed familiar, just as the jumper had.
They are still John and Sherlock, and they are still very much in love, even if they are not London’s crime-fighting duo anymore.
John doesn’t know when they decided to retire, when they decided that they’d had their fill of danger and instead of murky London and chasing killers through alleyways and stopping criminals obsessed with being the next big game for Sherlock Holmes, they’d rather have bees and a dog and fresh air and
“Oh no, what happened?” comes a voice from behind them, and they all turn to the source. Coming out of the house is the man Angie recognizes as either Doctor Watson or Mr. Holmes - whichever one of the two was the blond one.
- phone himself, then. He sent one last look at his microscope, then stood up, ignoring the protest of his muscles after moving them from the position they had been in for five hours. He snatched his phone up from the desktop, glaring at the screen as he read the number.
Jafar only looks more nervous that he already was, and Angie doesn’t know if she’s allowed to say anything to him. Her mum had always told her not to talk to strangers, but Doctor Watson or Mr. Holmes wasn’t really a stranger, if she (kind of) knew his name?
Thankfully, it wasn’t the cheerful man, but someone who looked similar enough to him that they could be brothers.
not sure how much I liked this one? but hey I actually have the rest of this planned out so I might as well release the next ones too.
Angie and Jafar follow suit - most people answer the door on the first ring anyway, if they don’t answer on the second, they’re probably not there. Ada does the same, and James waits only a couple seconds more before also joining them, saying, “But everyone’s home on Halloween!”
It was best to rip off the bandage fast, John thought, and so with quick assured steps he made his way to Sherlock and reached a hand out - Sherlock flinched as if John was going to strike him - and laid a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. It was warm and solid beneath him.
Angie had never met two men that were married and in love, but the way they make each other smile it must be true, so Angie shrugs and turns back to looking for other kids.
“We’re supposed to solve it?” he had asked, feeling foolish. If this was a game, it was obviously meant for only Sherlock to play - he was nothing more than a puppet here. He was a game piece, if he had been used to deliver the first clue, although he was only glad that he wasn’t in John’s position, as the final prize that he was sure Moriarty did not mean for Sherlock to win.
“Donovan,” came another voice from across the room, this one Greg’s, who shot Sally a warning look before turning to John. “John, how’ve you been? I haven’t seen you at a crime scene, since, well . . .” He trailed off awkwardly, and John wanted to ask him what he was talking about, why did he still look so sad and so awkward when Sherlock was right there, right in front of the body?
friend, and Sherlock can always drag John away from the other kids if he really needs to. Today, though, John is being particularly stubborn about staying where he is, and he isn’t even talking to anyone this time.
“G-good morning, John.” He paused, as if he was waiting for something. Separating his fingers from their steepled position, he rested them on the chair and looked up at John expectantly.
Lestrade did, and thankfully did explain, glaring all the while (although the effect was dampened considerably by the underlying hints of concern, but for what? Sherlock was fine). “I was wrapping up the paperwork for the last case - plenty of it, thanks to you - and packed up and left at about 11:58. I only stopped by the car to grab my apartment keys, although I was sure that I had them with me when I was doing the papers-” (He probably had, this was just a tactic to snatch him) “-when the door closed behind me and locked, and someone cocked a gun right by my ear. Let him do this-” he wiggled his hands and feet (which weren’t bound with the same metal, as Sherlock had thought, and instead were just duct tape. He started to tear the tape off as Lestrade continued) “-and then he called you. Held out a piece of paper with my lines, I recited them, and then he wrapped whatever that is-” he tilted his head at the
The biggest help Lestrade had been all day, Sherlock thought, taking a couple seconds to convince his feet to move (his pants let was still stained with the same awful, awful color Sherlock’s hands were stained with. It would give him a good excuse to burn the pants rather than admit that he never wanted another reminder of this awful day again).
“It’s not a waste of time!” John gets loud very suddenly, and everyone is looking at him. John doesn’t like people looking at him, Sherlock knows, and right on cue, he blushes a brilliant red as he notices. Sherlock wants to tell John that it doesn’t matter what all these people think, has told him before, but John persists in his embarrassment. Soon enough, everyone looks away, and John continues, quieter this time. “It’s not a waste. You get to tell all the people you like that you like them. Like family, and friends. And, other people. That you like.”
He carefully picked up the items, turning to Lestrade with a blank face, now that Lestrade was untied and standing up, and said in his trademark cool voice, “They are. Moriarty has him. Earlier, he sent me these-” he gave Lestrade a brief flash of his phone for him to see the text messages, “and now we have to find him.”
The only time he mustered up the strength to fight his mind was when Sherlock tried to convince him he wasn’t a figment of his imagination, because while he knew that he already wasn’t completely sane, what with seeing Sherlock everywhere he went, but if he started to believe that Sherlock was still alive, he would spiral down a rabbit hole he couldn’t climb out of
“We’re going to need you to move,” one of the women hovering over him said as the rest of the paramedics spread out around John, one (wedding ring not on his finger but a clear line where it used to be. It was on a chain around his neck: widower. With two cats, and likely a fish) even gently easing Sherlock’s fingers off of John so the rest could haul him away.
But someone’s already in the flowers. It’s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, his long limbs tucked compactly together as he squats down. He seems to be surveying the flowers in front of him, and as Angie watches, he picks three or four of the lilies and turns his attentions to the roses.
He flounces into the room like normal, eyes automatically searching for John. They do not have much time before the teacher unpleasantly forces them quiet and into their seats. Sherlock would have no problem giving it to him during class, really, but John would, of course, prefer that they break no rules.
Below it was a picture of the charred apartment. It was a studio apartment, although there was no furniture to identify the space, only what could vaguely be identified as former countertops and maybe a stove. A single red light, presumably from a fire alarm, from what Lestrade could see in the grainy photo, illuminated the space with help from the camera flash.
It was Greg, who looked much more awkward that he usually did, leaning on the wall outside. “Oh, uh, John,” he said, clearing his throat. “Sorry to interrupt, just wanted to see how it was going- how you were taking, uh, everything.”
), punctuated by the noise of the last piece of tape ripping off of Lestrade’s trousers. There was nothing - nothing in that explanation that could help him. Sherlock had always known Lestrade was unobservant, just as everyone else was, but even now, when Sherlock needed him most, he couldn’t have tried to observe
something. Be quieter, be nicer, be dumber, be smarter. With John, there isn’t any of that. John is the only one to accept Sherlock for Sherlock, and he can just . . . be. If it were up to Sherlock, he would be content to just
Sherlock preens as he always does when John compliments him - it’s been a little more than a decade since the first murmured
She’s shocked out of her trance by James pushing aside the flowers she had been hiding in, triumphantly crying, “Gotcha!” before letting out an audible gasp as he sees who is sharing Angie’s hiding spot with her.
Even as much as he thinks of 221B, even as much as he thinks about the men they used to be, flying through life, gun in hand, adrenaline high and in Sherlock’s case, so very clever, he knows he would never go back, now. Those years had been some of the best years of their lives, danger at every corner, but those years didn’t have to compete against where they were now.
John didn’t pick up on the exchange for a split second, but when it did, it hit him all at once- Greg had heard Sherlock- it wasn’t all in his head- if it wasn’t in his head then that meant Sherlock had- Sherlock was-
“Yeah, thanks.” There is the telltale sound of John settling into his armchair by the fireplace. From here, they will probably settle down for a relatively quiet evening. Sherlock will play his violin - he has been composing lately - and John will likely read the book he has been reading for the past two days. He is almost finished, and after that he might persuade Sherlock to walk around down the small streets with him, partly just to walk, partly to keep an eye out for any trouble (John has been restless lately, it might be time to call up Lestrade to see if he has any good cases for them). When they come back, he will check out the bees once more before they head to bed, John asking Sherlock to
Sherlock was in the same place he had left him, of course, but he immediately stood as soon as John walked in. “John!”
Sherlock didn’t like being ignored, and said louder, “John? John, come on, this is petty, I haven’t done anything. John?”
Angie asks her mum about it, one day. They are in the park, and while scanning the area for other kids her age, Angie spots the two men, walking together. The shorter one says something that makes the taller throw his head back and laugh. The blond’s eyes sparkle as he watches him laugh, before joining him in his laughter. “mummy,” she says, tugging her mum’s trouser leg. She points to the two men. “Are they in love?”
Today is no different. Sebastian had only just received his first failing chemistry grade (again, obvious) and had decided to take it out on Sherlock. Although Sherlock is still quite a bit taller than him, he is not taller than either of his friends, and he is definitely outnumbered. Still, he can give as good as he gets, especially since Sebastian’s verbal jabs leave something to be desired, even if his (mainly his goons’, really) punches do not.
Safaa drops down on James’s other side, pats his back and repeats, “It’s okay,” over and over again. James’s cries get quieter, but they don’t stop.
Sherlock Holmes is seven years old. His best friend, John Watson, is also seven years old, although he is exactly five months and three days older than Sherlock. That’s okay, though, because Sherlock is much smarter than John. He tells this to John all the time (usually when he’s explaining something that John doesn’t understand to him), but John doesn’t seem to mind. The other kids call him mean names when Sherlock does that. John never has.
John is also Sherlock’s only friend, but Sherlock is not John’s only friend. This isn’t usually an issue, because Sherlock is John’s
The glare fell off his face and was replaced by a slightly more confused frown (not completely confused - Sherlock Holmes didn’t get confused - but uncertain). He rarely got ‘unknown number’ texts, especially since caller ID numbers started displaying the phone number of those he hadn’t contacted before.
Angie marvels at how loud they are, to be heard all the way outside the house. Apparently Doctor Watson is just as loud, because he yells back, “Hold on, you prat! I’m busy, I’ll be right back!” The words are harsh, but the tone is anything but, sounding almost fond.
I sacrificed my search history to plan this out hopefully once I complete this it's as good as it sounds on the outline. rest assured, it's a bad outline because most of my writing is v e r  y improvised.
to be able to settle down with someone. But right now, John finds that bees and a dog and curling up with Sherlock on the sofa and listening to him criticize cop shows and dramas is much more enticing than running after London’s newest thief or murderer.
“Case file. Again,” Lestrade had heard him mutter. He’d found it - and was probably going to rush off with it, leaving Lestrade in the dust to desperately try and catch up and Sherlock solved the case on his own. Not this time - Lestrade liked John, they went out for drinks every couple weeks, and he would be damned if he didn’t at least try to help. Not to mention, he was sure Sherlock was affected by this more than he let on, and he would be there for Sherlock if he needed him (as unlikely as it was to happen - Sherlock would probably admit to being an idiot before he admitted he needed help, or even showed it to any degree).
Carbon monoxide poisoning? Now that Sherlock had mentioned it, he didn’t need Sherlock to explain it to him (he doubted Sherlock would have anyway, as absorbed in this new game as he was) - the red light must have been from a carbon monoxide monitor.
Now was not the time to ask him (for the 87th time), so instead, Sherlock greeted John with a kiss. John smiled against his lips, pulling away after a couple seconds. “You’re very forward today.”
Sherlock turned his gaze on him, and Lestrade stuttered for a moment, pausing in what he was going to say, before letting out a heavy sigh.
(and he sounded like John, romanticizing everything, but that really was the best way to explain it) as he realized what that meant. Moriarty had promised to burn the heart out of Sherlock by attacking the one thing that proved Sherlock had one.
To Angie’s relief, he turns his piercing gaze off of her, but lands it on James instead, whose face has changed from gleeful to looking like a deer in headlights. Instead of keeping up the stare like he had with her, though, he maneuvers his face into a smile, and says, “Hello.”
“Cool,” Ada says quietly, looking at Doctor Watson nervously. Angie knows that she doesn’t like new people - it had taken them forever to befriend her, and only recently has she stopped being so nervous around them. She tried to communicate to Ada that Doctor Watson is nice, but she doesn’t think the point gets across very well.
“John!” Sherlock had hissed at him, intent on complaining, but John had simply ignored him as he picked up construction paper and coloured pencils.
Jafar, meanwhile, is standing, and he turns to Ada on his side and says loudly enough for them all to hear, “What do we do?!”
Moriarty’s reply came quick and it lead to where he was now. A cold fear had his heart in a tight grip and he raced over to the other side of the car and threw himself in the driver’s seat even before Sherlock had barked at him to
Sherlock huffed again as he went downstairs again, peering up at his mummy through his curls and saying, “I need construction paper, Mummy. And colours.”
They had decided the easiest way to start was to count down at the same time, and they do that, chorusing. “Three . . . two . . . one!” Angie is off in a flash - she
Sherlock read and reread the messages - it was clear Moriarty had somehow, inexplicably, survived the gun to the face, but that puzzle was for another day - trying to deduce anything, anything at all, about what game Moriarty was playing this time. There was always a first clue, or a first move, that Moriarty had to make or give, but he hadn’t left . . . anything. There was no secret code in the words, nothing that Sherlock could use to-
) and so instead averts his eyes and ears. Thankfully, Veronica leaves quickly, this time with just a kiss to John’s cheek, and the two of them are alone again (as they should be).
“Here!” she thrusts them into his face. She has to use two hands because the bouquet is too big for her hands. “My dad got these for my mum, and my mum said I could give them to you so you can give them to Doctor Watson!”
She goes to bed vibrating with excitement, and has to remind her mum no less than three times the next day, but they are finally at the park. Mr. Holmes is not there yet, but Angie knows he will be, so she claims the empty swings while she waits. Her mother tells her they’ll only wait for ten minutes, but Angie knows that Mr. Holmes will come soon, and he does, heading straight for the flower bed. Angie waits for the swing to slow before grabbing the flowers from her mother and running towards Mr. Holmes.
Already, Lestrade was feeling overwhelmed, and that wasn’t something he admitted easily, especially in the presence of Sherlock. Even following Sherlock for the short time that he had, had him privy to a glimpse of the minds of two geniuses - even if one was a notorious criminal - and the games the two played, how they danced around each other and how Moriarty almost
“John, phone,” Sherlock called, not looking up from the microscope (in which he was studying fingernails that were the equivalent of Petri dishes when it came to the number of bacteria on them - delightful) but holding out one hand.
If this jumper was here, though . . . Sherlock suddenly felt cold fingers wrap around his stomach and
“He’s scary, and everyone says he’s really mean,” Ada adds, the last one to lose. Jafar and James have already claimed their prize, pumping their legs to get higher and higher.
Sherlock turned around, a familiar glint in his eyes. Sherlock had many different glints and shimmers and twinkles in his eyes, and John knew every one of them. This was his
“Sherlock really did teach you a thing or two about deductions, huh?” someone said from behind him, and John cut himself off abruptly to spin around and come face to face with Sally, who was looking equal parts annoyed and disappointed. John hadn’t known anyone had been listening to him. “I thought I told you to get a hobby before he could infect you, too.”
Not light, but adoring, the nearly frantic kiss that Sherlock set to John’s lips. It grew more fevered, and John wound his arms around the detective, the ring box still in his hand behind Sherlock’s back. The detective pressed himself more securely against John, trying to leave no space between them, his head turning slightly so could John could shower kisses along the long slope of his neck, and then find his lips again. Sherlock made a sound like a whimper into John’s mouth, then ripped himself away, and forced his hand forward. “Put it on John, put it on.”
“It’s fine. I don’t mind. Another?” John’s voice had taken on a different timbre at the late stage of the hour, and the credits were rolling as Sherlock uncoiled from a newly protective posture with his pillow shield back in place. Like an unwound clock, the younger man loosened, agile limbs splaying as he looked to the television, then back at the doctor.
“Well, after the wedding, I thought you might. I genuinely prefer to text, but for you, I would have made an exception.” The smile had gone, but the vision was still plainly interested, and John didn’t know what to make of that.
John wet his lips, clamping down on the bottom one with his teeth, considering exactly what the message said outright, and if there was possibly some subtext beneath it. Not “someone young, from university” didn’t discount someone young that wasn’t there. Sherlock likely could have placed an ad or found someone else in his age group, so it didn’t seem that it was only the university part that he was avoiding. John was still contemplating this when the next message came through.
The two older men shared a nod of mutual respect, because though John would no doubt be angry again at Mycroft soon enough, right now he was just too grateful and excited to waste time on the other emotion. Mycroft departed with Trevor, and John let his eyes settle on the form of Sherlock, with his flickering eyelids. He knew Sherlock wasn't asleep yet, but he said nothing further, simply covering the dark-haired young man's hand with his other, so that most of Sherlock's hand was contained in John's capable ones.
Slightly shorter chapter this time. Headache all last week, and Friday evening I found out my apt complex messed up my lease agreement, so it needs to be sorted. Preparing though for a good chapter of Sherlock and John spending some further quality time, and John changing things up a bit.
It was a pleasure watching Sherlock at work. The movements, his long arms and torso extended as he spread out the duvet, then thought better of it, draping it along the back of the sofa instead. For just a moment he was spread, arms to each side, his cheek turned to press into the midway point so the air trapped beneath would be pushed out to the ends and possibly just to feel the comforting softness against his face. Smoothing, his musician’s fingers getting rid of creases and folds, the dressing gown was caressing his sides and drifting over his lean hips as he spread the duvet, curls without any product bouncing at the back of his head, the flex of his toes that John was learning came with concentration. The four throws he’d drawn out of storage were shaken loose, two each for he and John, but he let John’s stay folded while his own were coiled and fluffed. Loosening his frame, it could only be said that he snuggled down into the throws then, pulling a pillow onto his lap, his chin resting just over the edge as he drew up his knees.
That further sent Sherlock into his exploration, and he started slotting details into his Mind Palace, adding another leather club chair to the area already outfitted for John, and the formative stages of another room that carried the leather perfume through tools such as a crop, a small flogger, and straps for the bed that still had not been set in the bedroom. Shutting down anything further, his body beginning to very much betray his state, he forced an evenness to his breath before resting his hand on John’s bicep to give it a firm squeeze.
John cut him off at that, waving his hand to show he didn’t require an explanation. “It’s fine, Sherlock. It’s all fine.” Grasping the cane by curved handle, he also stood up, but didn’t linger to regard the younger man. Stepping to the side, he aimed the end of the cane toward the door. “You better get a move on.” He coughed once, then went on. “I’ll just go clear out my things, and see you tomorrow. Enjoy your evening.” Probably a bit too pointed, the way he didn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes, the hand not on his cane curling into a fist by his thigh.
Forty minutes later, John was standing in front of a black door with the plate numbers displaying 221B. Bit odd that, but he lifted the knocker, and waited to see who would be inviting him. The door revealed an older woman in a plum-colored dress, her face showing lines that spoke of years of laughs and deep thought, the lines now transforming as she smiled at John.
"Yes, Sir." No need to pretend anything else, not even in front of Mycroft and Trevor, similar relationships being as they were. For the first time in awhile, Sherlock looked at peace, though his eyes shut as he followed the orders.
It’s then that Mike swivels a look John’s direction, a smile playing along the sides of his mouth that John can’t read. “I dunno – get a flat share or something?”
"Well, you’re the second person to say that to me today.” Mike is slowing his pace, but he isn’t turning to face John or make any sign that they are about to part ways.
“I don’t care what you were saying, don’t you understand that?” Sherlock was almost grabbing at his riot of dark curls, ones he kept unfashionably long despite the preferred current styles sported by young men his age that were attempting to be The Beau or Admiral. “No! I won’t. I won’t, damn you!” To this point, Sherlock had been holding a book of poetry, the volume he had been enjoying when Mycroft invaded the territory and the demands. Now, the same volume tumbled to the floor, spine so soft from the book being opened over the year, that the whole thing was splayed –very much like Sherlock- to Mycroft’s eagle eyes.
It seemed as though it took forever, and when they pulled up to the location, John didn’t try to bolt out of the ambulance first. Staying back, he let the doors swing wide, and Sherlock be pulled out with the stretcher safely meeting the ground before he hopped out behind him. He touched to his side, aware that he’d left his gun back at the shop, and lifted his gaze to see that they were not in fact at a local hospital.
“Yes, tomorrow...then.” Sherlock is almost whispering at this point, and he’s pushing his hands into his trouser pockets, either trying to keep them from shaking or trying to appear more casual than John is guessing he actually is. Like a flash though, he leans to the left, opening the door for John. He still looks self conscious, and is avoiding direct eye contact, but John is smiling even more now.
“John, hello.” Mike sounded cheery, and had he been in a better mood, John would have asked himself for the thousandth time how it was that the other man usually seemed in such good spirits, no matter the time of day or situation.
Still nothing, and after a few more moments of this, John left his place to make good on his words. When he did reach his room though, he left the door open, making it possible to hear if Sherlock called out in need of him or at least left his bedroom during the course of the evening. The directions had been given, and if Sherlock was awake to hear them, John was fairly certain the younger man would not disappoint.
Sherlock almost stumbled with the speed with which he rose, smiling timidly, but with such enthusiasm that John almost didn’t know what to make of it. What had he done to deserve this gorgeous, warm-hearted soul? He watched as Sherlock picked the tea back up, and hastened out of the living room to do as he’d been directed.
“Oh.” Sherlock seemed startled, shaking fingers putting his cup and saucer on the round table to his left, then resting them at the top of each thigh. “I wouldn’t want you to…pay me back, Dr. Watson. The room would have needed…a few things, no matter the tenant.” He didn’t seem to know how to go on, and a head tilt was paired with his shifting back on the chair slightly, an attempt at comfort that didn’t naturally pair with the part of lips that were not summoning anything else to add.
Bearing a tray, the good woman placed it gingerly on the side table by the only comfortable chair in the room. “I expect he’s told you then?” Liberties taken by the oldest confidante, she didn’t stay silent or try to pretend everything was all roses. Preparing the tea as Sherlock liked it, and resting a couple of biscuits on the saucer besides, she extended the balm to the restless young man.
His friend was rewarded with an expulsion of breath and sedate nod of head from John, whose fingers were clenching on his own fine china, forcibly undone so he didn't snap the delicate piece of crystalline blue with gold etching. Extending the cup out to Mike, and clearing his throat, John made ready to go back to his own job site. "Thanks, Mike. I will take it under advisement." A bitter slant to his smile at first, but he made it warmer, handing the cup to the other doctor. "Give this back to him when you go in, yeah? I have an appointment with a pair of swollen tonsils in about fifteen minutes." He still used his cane, and once Mike took the cup from him, John was limping down the sidewalk toward the clinic. He didn't see the younger man on the other side of the teashop glass watching him, the confusion going through the blue-green eyes or downward pull of the cupid's-bow lips that had been keeping him awake some nights well after he went upstairs to his all-but-vacant bedroom.
“Uh, yes. Thanks. Mrs. Hudson, is it?” Had to be, but better to ask, just in case there was another woman about the place on a regular basis.
At first, there was nothing. Another man would have stopped the manner of stealth John was utilizing, but he would rather look back and consider his actions too careful than have something go critically wrong, and regret it later. John had had enough of regrets, especially where Sherlock was concerned. A silence that seemed impenetrable, one that dragged on for several minutes, was all that met him. John was just about to proceed into the main part of the shop, taking one cautious step after another, when he heard it.
It suited both men well, and made it possible for John to watch Sherlock further as he used his intellect and quiet charisma to entrance customers of all kinds, deducing what tastes they preferred, what sorts of lines they wanted on their dishware, and how much of everything they would need, before they'd even made it well into the shop. John couldn't help but notice that Sherlock was much more confident around these people, that he maintained a reserved politeness with them, and his voice never stuck in his throat, his eyes never dropped away in confusion or display over a stumbled phrase, because he was seldom wrong in his assessments. At first, it had been a troubling thing for John, because although he was silently pleased that Sherlock was fine around others, it did concern him that perhaps they'd never reach that level of ease. By the second week, however, he was considering himself fortunate, in that the young man he saw with the public was just doing his job, using the diversion for what it was, and that only John seemed to be able to engender any real warmth into the protective layer.
“Hmm, yes. So, you’ve said.” Doubt rang heavily in her tone, but she looked as sympathetic as before. Not that her sympathy could fix the situation of the family finances or the young man’s heart, but he had it anyway. “Drink your cuppa, and I will come back later to help you.”
John sat up now, raking a hand through his short hair, and swearing to himself. It wasn’t just Sherlock that had expected his arrival, but a lady as well. After weighing this new information against the likelihood he might make a fool of himself in front of them both, John forced his misgivings to the back of his mind, and sorted his hair with a few more quick skims of his fingers through the strands.
Having closed the paper when the younger man began to speak, the end of his comments had John not bothering to reign in the look of surprise it brought on, and he licked his tongue at the corner of his mouth before drawing the paper from the marginally trembling fingers holding it. Sherlock’s hand danced backward, as if the paper had been on fire, but he didn’t leave. John set eyes on the list, going over the various notations that Sherlock had also put to the side of each one, as well as the ranking system he’d created. Still, not trying to read more into than he should, John nodded once as he lifted his eyes to Sherlock. “Thank you, Sherlock. I appreciate it.” There was a pause, and he wagered the younger man knew it all already, but he didn’t want the conversation to just end. “Got my things sorted here, so I can set out first thing in the morning. Seems you put a good deal of thought into this, and the rankings will help me, no doubt. The locum suggestion, that’s a good one. Ease these old bones into the fray again, hmmm?”
The air is cooler than outdoors, and John stops a few steps offside from the entrance. Despite the improvement in the temperature, he has to take a moment to just breathe. Once he’s got his bearings, his eyes make another brief surveillance of the interior, then he takes his phone from his pocket to check the time. He keeps it loosely in his grasp, turning it over and over, a gesture of restless uncertainty more than a need to keep the piece of technology available.
The shorter of Sebstian’s minions - the one on the right stopping his path - is already shrinking back, the memory of what John had already done to him making him reluctant for a repeat performance. Sherlock resists the urge to laugh, but he does allow a thin smile. Sebastian releases him roughly, shoving Sherlock away as he glares right back at John.
“I really am getting old, huh?” John says, words conflicting his happy tone and smile as he takes the flowers from Sherlock. “They’re beautiful, thank you. Is this what the past days were about, then?”
anyway I don't like this one but that's what happens when you don't sleep the night before ig. hopefully it was only a weirdly muddled stream of consciousness for me bc everything's kinda fuzzy rn.
“You weren’t disturbing me. I was just looking for flowers. Your game was rather harmless to my concentration, because although children are rather loud usually, hide and seek requires you to be mildly silent. You are a lot more tolerable than most adults, in any case,” Mr. Holmes says. Angie doesn’t understand half the words he said, and James looks like he didn’t either, but she did understand the first part, and Angie knows that there is a far better place to get flowers than from the ground in the park. There is a flower shop not very far from here, and all of Mr. Victor Poppon’s flowers smell and look pretty.
“Mr. Victor Poppon has nice flowers!” Angie tells him. Mr. Holmes has lived here longer than she, but perhaps he still doesn’t know about it? “You can get flowers from there. There are a lot more of them there, too!”
Once he was at the clinic, he let himself slip into his doctor mindset, vanquishing all thoughts of Sherlock from his mind. Sherlock had never appeared in the clinic before, thankfully, and it offered John a much-needed respite from . . . everything. He couldn’t let his mind go completely numb, of course, but he definitely didn’t have to think of Sherlock, and he barely got enough time between patients for his mind to stray to him either.
Sherlock looked down at his hands. Crimson, just like John had been covered in. Crimson that had come from John.
When the urge does hit, as it sometimes does, they find that Sherlock isn’t as fast as he used to be, find that John’s punches don’t land as hard as they used to. With age comes difference, after all, and even after dealing with the elderly for years as a doctor, John hadn’t expected it to catch up with him so soon. Some things still haven’t changed, though. John’s marksmanship is still as accurate as ever, and Sherlock’s mind hasn’t diminished in the slightest.
He shifted his eyes from John’s face (twisted up, eyes closed, and mouth moving soundlessly: delirious) to stare at his stomach, the source of all the crimson (wound stemming from: 6 centimeters above right hip, stab wound from a right hand, stabber about 1.8 meters) and ripped his own scarf off his neck and placed it next to the one already there (the man’s further proving his middle-class status. He was currently speaking to Lestrade, pointing at John and at Sherlock), and pushed down. “Come on John, stay with me.”
A detective? Angie supposes she can see that - he’s dark and mysterious, like all the detectives on the TV shows her parents like are.
His anger melted and was replaced by a concentrated intensity as soon as Lestrade’s first words came out, stiff and solid and definitely not of his own volition. There was a silence at the beginning (two people breathing - one Lestrade, one likely threatening Lestrade. He was a smoker) before Lestrade started to speak. “Got my messages, handsome?” he practically recited (no echo, no background noise or chatter, clear rumble of air conditioning and engine - in his car). “Come on over and collect your first clue.”
Sherlock has known, ever since he had spent time around more than just Mycroft and their parents, that everyone is an idiot. After he had moved past thinking he was an idiot compared to Mycroft, it was easy to realize that whatever the intelligence gap was between Mycroft and himself, the gap was upwards of ten times larger between Sherlock and the rest of the idiots that contaminated the planet.
“That’s what he wants us to find out, but as even your remarkably basic mind can likely comprehend, it isn’t going to be good.” The glovebox, after Sherlock had thrown everything out of it, closed with a slam and promptly fell back open. He sifted through the items before pausing on one.
Mycroft was right. Especially now - sentiment was a disadvantage, and would only hinder him now, would only hinder him from getting to John. He couldn’t let any of this get the better of him (worry about Lestrade: rash actions, destruction of evidence. Fear for John: carelessness, time-wasting, sloppiness. Sentiment was already hurting him, already keeping him from John, with his beautiful eyes and beautiful smile and-)
thanks for the 100 kudos?? i thought this was one of my worse-written (esp sherlock) fics so this was a surprise lmao. consider checking out some of my other works & have a great rest of the day! :D
“Go away! You’re not him, so go away!” John glared at fake-Sherlock, who stepped back, face impassive in the way John knew meant that he was trying hide his hurt, before just . . . disappearing. John was left glaring at nothing, alone in a Tesco’s bread aisle, with the women to his left shooting him nervous side-eye looks before scuttling away.
Disappointed that she won’t be able to win the race, she grabs her bike, sweet in mouth, and heads back with her friends, only barely catching the second thanks Mrs. Adelaide gives Doctor Watson.
“Thank you for the concern, Geoff, now leave,” Sherlock called from inside the house. John fought to not turn around and reprimand him, and instead wondered how he was supposed to answer that.
Sherlock cleared his throat again from behind him. “John, I know my return has been quite a shock for you, but if you could say something-”
Sherlock stiffly rose to his feet once it was clear he could either move or be moved (or watch John as he was carted away and be helpless and useless and all the things Sherlock Holmes was
“John,” he said to John’s prone figure laying on the ground (his knees, as close as possible to John without touching him, suddenly were wet as he kneeled in a pool of John’s blood, blood that should have been inside his body but- (unimportant, cease train of thought)). “John!”
wear this same, soft, oatmeal-coloured jumped, to crime scenes, in the flat, on dates? (Blond hairs on the neckline, small tear at the hem from being snagged on one of Sherlock’s sharper experiments, and distinct smell of John all further proved his conclusion.)
John hums his acknowledgment, already grasping for a vase to put the flowers in, before pausing and taking another look at the flowers. “Wait, these didn’t come from the garden. Are these-?”
Angie remembers this - Doctor John Watson, and Sherlock must be Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The ones that were in love just like her mum and dad were in love. That would explain the fondness - whenever her mum yells at someone, it’s usually over the phone, and it isn’t nearly as soft-sounding as Doctor Watson’s tone.
Lestrade hated it when people called Sherlock inhumane or a machine. He had seen Sherlock at his lowest - doped up on drugs, rocking back and forth in an alley, covered in sick and mud and dirt and tears, muttering nonsensically - and knew Sherlock definitely felt more than he let on. His earlier outburst was clear proof of that, but suddenly, Sherlock was just as cold and closed off as he was for every other case.
“For God’s sake Sherlock, I just wanted to make sure John hadn’t killed you, even if you would have deserved it,” Greg huffed as John thought. “And it’s Greg!”
“There must be something about the number three,” stated Sherlock, sounding slightly more confident. “Everyone always gives up after three.”
They were all so invested in this discussion, they missed Sherlock's eyes flickering open, and John was actually surprised when he felt the long fingers of the violinist slide into his own. That hand could have easily encased his own, but Sherlock had chosen to be the one covered by John's smaller, heavier hand. "I do. Want you, in that way. He knows it."
Clearly, this had been unexpected, and Sherlock eyes shifted into the greener range while the pupils dilated. Moving though too, once he’d knew he had permission, and the young man pushed his two pillows and extra throw toward the doctor’s leg. He sorted one pillow along John’s hip, put a throw over just his own feet, kept the one over his shoulders while allowing his head to finally escape, and rested his cheek on the solid firmness of John’s leg. The second pillow he kept as his shield to the rest of the room, his legs drawing up, and his feet doing more of that brushing together they seem to do when he was anxious or otherwise unwell. “Thank you.” It was a whisper at most, but John rested his hand on Sherlock’s head, touching the menu button the remote with the other.
“I had a case." There was a pause, and then the vision had more to say to him. "You never called. I thought you’d at least try.” It almost sounded like a demand, but there was a touch of offended hurt behind the words, too. The vision, his vision, was hurt that Plain John Watson hadn’t called.
“I don’t own it. I mean…My older brother, Mycroft, he owns it.” Rolling pressed lips against one another, he took a deep breath, blanching as he explained further. “He thought I needed a diversion, something besides my education, to keep me out of trouble. I mean…I play the violin, and I…well, I do other things, but he thought it wasn’t enough.”
“After my class is over” Sherlock had mentioned to John, leaving the former army doctor to consider over the course of the remaining evening, and all the next day, what course it was, and exactly how old his potential flatmate really was. Thanks to the confession from Mike after they’d left the shop, John felt he had a reasonably accurate read on the younger man, and it wasn’t as if John didn’t have his own store of experience to use in matters such as understanding communication complexity.
The truth was, and Sherlock was acutely aware of it, he didn’t know how to go about being able to let the older man know just how much he already wanted to be his, how a craving had settled in under his ribcage that set his heart pounding, and made everything below his waistline alternately either tight and warm or too loose and prone to buckling. Even now, he could feel his increased pulse again, his breathing becoming a forced thing, and a raw edge sending spikes of electricity up his spine.
Clearing his throat, he used a solid nod, sipping at the hot liquid in a test. It was just as he liked it, and he started to ask how Sherlock had ascertained that, but decided to leave it for now. “Now, that is how you make tea. Thank you, Sherlock. And…yes…the room is perfect.” Before giving Sherlock a chance to answer, he did have one question. “Do I have Mrs. Hudson or you to thank for the linens?”
Point coming across, Sherlock’s pupils dilated, a deer in the headlights expression transforming him yet again. “I understand.” He nipped at his lower lip with his teeth, and touched at the collar of his pale lilac shirt, his neck exposed where the upper buttons had been left undone. It was a fashion he seemed to prefer, if this occasion and the one in the shop, were anything to go by. Gaining some courage from just a glance at the now cold cup of tea, he darted eyes back to John. “I can cook. I mean…Mrs. Hudson says I eat like a bird…which really doesn’t make any sense, because everyone knows birds eat a great deal, but well…I don’t eat very much, and sometimes I…Well, but I will make sure there is dinner waiting every night. For when…for when you come home from work.” He looked a bit deflated in how that had all tumbled from his lips, and they were parted when he stopped, but he was risking meeting John’s eyes again in what was obviously an attempt at approval.
John hadn’t thought of his mother’s set in ages, and thinning his lips out, he swallows thickly, taking a few more steps to his left. His hand is clenching, but he wills it to relax, and looks over the floor to ceiling shelves of equally distinctive design. They form open-fronted boxes, and are made of teak or an equally dark wood, the crown moldings and hardwood floor beneath his feet, matching the scheme. Square black canisters with every conceivable type of tea are set on the niches, the lids are round with a border of a thin stripe of pink, and each one has a hand-written label that resembles parchment. A wooden sign designates sections of black tea, green tea, white tea, the whole lot. It mirrors the counter in length, and John can’t imagine even him ever needing that much tea in one lifetime. He hears a door open behind him, but he’s still figuring out exactly how many different types of tea are being sold, finally just multiplying the number of columns and rows that make up the shelving unit.
No time to think about it, John was brushing the matted curls off Sherlock’s forehead, unable to lift the whole onto his lap where he knelt down. A good amount of red was running in a stream from just over Sherlock’s left ear, and John was assessing the damage.
They continued, and Sherlock watched as a woman lived with a dog that was supposedly put down when the suicidal young man had been a child. She lived in a house with an empty refrigerator, and toward the end, the scenes had been played over and over with subtle differences in each replay.
While this is going on, and not sure what else to do, John shifts a glance offside to the area behind where the tables were set. A grouping of settee and two clubs chairs around a coffee table, the items upholstered in black leather, piping the same shade of pink as on the tea canisters. There is a partially unfinished look about it, but John can’t quite figure out what is going on there, so he decides to try Mike again.
“That’s better.” John slid the ring onto Sherlock’s finger, and rose up just enough to give the detective a chaste kiss. “Happy Valentine’s Day, love.”
Mycroft picked up where Trevor, who now clasped his lover's hand in his own, continued the explanation as he ought. "But, with my rising position in the government, and Sherlock's need for someone to make sure he stayed clean, I needed assistance. So, I devised the plan that Trevor and Sherlock should pose as a couple, until such time as I was certain Sherlock was off the sweeties, and Trevor would be safe after his graduation. They were in the same program, and got along so well, that it was never really an issue." He didn't sound annoyed that it now was, but he was finally leveling his gaze pointedly at John.
The vision touched his hand to his brow line, blocking out the sun, then rapidly turned the direction opposite to hasten down the alley nearest him. One minute stretched into two, then five, then ten. He did not reappear.
“Yes, I think…That is, dancing is…good.” Sherlock managed eye contact for a few seconds, then darted his gaze elsewhere, biting on his bottom lip as John watched the various transitions on his face. He was fairly sure he could feel his own heart pounding, but John didn’t seem to be aware of the situation, because he only nodded and continued turning Sherlock about the floor until the opus ended. They were both a bit out of breath, some reasons shared, and John didn’t let Sherlock go immediately. In point of fact, it almost seemed more an afterthought as he cleared his throat, then stepped back from the shyly smiling young man in front of him.
He and Sherlock had just solved a case, because it turned out the florist gig had been a front for the consulting detective’s real work. After a short movie attempt, Lestrade had texted with a level eight, and they’d thrown off the blankets and pillows to race to the scene.
Harry and Clara’s wedding. John had no real interest in the festivities side of things, having just made it back from Afghanistan, if being a wounded man with no promising future in sight could be said to “make it back”. Harry had insisted that John be her Best Man, which while he still had to use his cane to be in the wedding procession, was better than trying to walk the bride down the aisle.
